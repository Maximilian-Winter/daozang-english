**Method for Absorbing the Qi of the Five Stars of the Five Directions**

The radiance of the sun and moon is called "light"; the essence of the stars is called "luminosity." Together, they are the Seven Luminaries; collectively, they are the Three Luminaries. The Luminaries are the images of bright essence. By aligning with these images, one embraces brightness and absorbs luminosity, attaining longevity and immortality. Such a person is called a "Child of the Three Luminaries," ascending into emptiness and entering the Luminaries, becoming one with the Perfected, transforming freely, and merging with the True. This is a secret of the Supreme Sages—guard it well and do not transmit it recklessly.

Conduct this practice on the first nine days of the first, fourth, seventh, and tenth months (the four *meng* months of the year) at dawn; on the nineteenth day of the second, fifth, eighth, and eleventh months (the four *zhong* months) at noon; and on the twenty-ninth day of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months (the four *ji* months) at midnight. Perform it once at dawn, noon, and midnight, and again at midnight until dawn, and dawn until noon. In a year, this amounts to thirty-six repetitions, corresponding to the three hundred and sixty degrees of the celestial cycle. The surplus of five represents the overflow of qi.

On the appointed days and hours, enter a purified chamber with solemn reverence. Burn incense, concentrate the mind, close the eyes, and hold the breath. Knock the teeth nine times, and visualize the divine lords of the Nine Star Palaces, majestic and dignified, surrounded by their retinues.

1. The first, the Yang Brightness Divine Person, exhales a light of blue qi.
2. The second, the Yin Essence Divine Person, exhales a light of black qi.
3. The third, the Perfected Person Divine Person, exhales a light of yellow qi.
4. The fourth, the Profound Darkness Divine Person, exhales a light of red qi.
5. The fifth, the Cinnabar Prime Divine Person, exhales a light of white qi.
6. The sixth, the Northern Culmen Divine Person, exhales a light of green qi.
7. The seventh, the Celestial Pass Divine Person, exhales a light of crimson qi.
8. The eighth, the Assistant Star Divine Person, exhales a light of azure qi.
9. The ninth, the Adjuvant Star Divine Person, exhales a light of dark qi.

Each of the nine qi descends from its star into the practitioner’s mouth in sequence. Inhale deeply, swallowing the qi without limit, then exhale the old qi gently. Gradually absorb the nine-colored new qi, swallowing them completely. Knock the teeth nine times, and proceed with sitting, lying, walking, or resting as usual. After nine years of this practice, the Nine August Divine Lords will descend to transmit their secrets. You will attain longevity and immortality, ascend to the Three Heavens, befriend the host of Perfected, and merge with the Dao.

**Method for Absorbing the Qi of the Five Stars of the Five Directions**
- **South:** Fire Star (Mars)
- **East:** Year Star (Jupiter) ● **Center:** Quelling Star (Saturn) ●
- **West:** Grand White Star (Venus)
- **North:** Celestial Star (Mercury)

On the days of the Five Kings and during the hours of the Six *Ding*, enter a purified chamber with solemn reverence. Burn incense, concentrate the mind, close the eyes, and hold the breath. Knock the teeth twenty-five times, swallow saliva twenty-five times, calm the heart, and regulate the breath. Sit upright and still, visualizing the Year Star’s blue qi, the Fire Star’s red qi, the Grand White Star’s white qi, the Celestial Star’s black qi, and the Quelling Star’s yellow qi, each in their respective directions. The qi should be vibrant and shimmering, swirling and intertwining, blending the five colors into a radiant brilliance that crowns the heavens and fills the earth, suffusing the four directions. It should illuminate the practitioner’s body, inside and out, until the body grows warm and fragrant.

Face the direction of the ruling star and first swallow its qi, then proceed to absorb the qi in the order of generation. Repeat this cycle until complete. The number of swallows corresponds to the ruling star: nine for the East, eight for the South, three for the intermediate directions, six for the West, and five for the North. Once finished, knock the teeth twenty-five times and swallow saliva twenty-five times. After five years of practice, the Five Emperors will guide you to wander and feast in the Jade Capital, and you will forever become a Perfected Person.

**General Precepts for Absorbing the Qi of the Sun, Moon, Northern Dipper, and Five Stars:**
Do not speak excessively. Do not over-exert yourself. Do not indulge in laziness. Do not succumb to joy or anger. Do not raise your voice. Do not pry into others’ affairs. Do not seek favor from superiors or inferiors. Do not isolate yourself or stand apart. Do not mingle with the unworthy. Do not claim to possess the Dao. Do not disclose your methods. Do not impatiently seek quick results. Do not doubt the divine. Do not abandon yourself to pursue external things. Do not manipulate things to suit yourself. Do not betray the Two Images. Do not defy the Three Honored Ones.

Even if you observe other precepts and study various disciplines, without adhering to these principles, the Mysterious Spirits will not take pity, nor will they descend to aid you. No effects will manifest, and no attainment will be achieved. The resources for attaining the Dao lie in these secrets. Companions on the path of higher learning must earnestly uphold and practice them.

Those who revere the Three Luminaries are called Disciples of the Three Luminaries. After guiding three others across, entrust the teachings to a master or friend. Thereafter, in transmission, one may be called a Master of the Three Luminaries, a Teacher, or a Perfected Person, as designated by one’s master or recommended by peers. Without formal petition and approval, one must not presumptuously adopt such titles. Those who arrogantly claim grand names for personal gain will face severe penalties and deep retribution, with no pardon even after three reprieves. If transgressions occur, promptly repent and face the Azure Lad to rectify past errors. Follow the master’s instructions and do not repeat the offense; three offenses will nullify all prior merit. Even repeated apologies will only compound the labor and increase the sin. Those who study with diligence must exercise utmost caution.

For those who receive the Dao, the greatest treasure lies in immortality. Through effective cultivation, one secures longevity, and with unbroken continuity of life, one becomes a True Sage. The foundation of sageliness lies in transforming others through practice, and through teaching, one revives the lost. Those who remain deluded and refuse to follow are pitied without abandonment. Turning delusion toward rectitude, one comforts them with even greater diligence.

Those who show kindness reward the compliant without growing weary or disdainful; those who grieve for the disobedient harbor no anger or resentment. When reproaching with stern words, first examine their hearts: if receptive, feign goodness to move them; if resistant, conceal displeasure to pacify them. Pacify without breeding resentment, for resentment only deepens their faults. Persuade them often, ensuring their progress—regression brings ease and forfeits fortune. To cultivate alone yields no merit, and virtue cannot be perfected.

In the Great Antiquity, affairs were few, transgressions rare; no merit was needed for redemption. Through focused contemplation and stillness, with no exchange between self and others, all attained the True Dao. Since the Middle Antiquity, affairs have multiplied, grievances accumulated—urgent merit must be established. Sacrifice the self to save others, uphold the Dao, recite scriptures, and follow the master without negligence. Devote day and night with single-mindedness, toil with body and heart without shirking labor. The peril of evil is as startling as plunging into boiling water; the eagerness for goodness is as urgent as thirst driving one to drink.

When the world is obstructed, temporarily preserve independence; when the world flows freely, extend boundless aid. If peril cannot be averted, depart in leisure, yet sorrow lingers in the heart, and remembrance never ceases. For those in decline who can be saved, exert tireless effort—restrain and guide, give and take, expand and contract as circumstances demand. Joy and anger, reward and punishment, demotion and promotion—all must align with the times. The flow of time has its favor and disfavor; the sagely and true have their actions and retreats. Without utmost refinement, none can comprehend this.

The shallow and unlearned falsely claim truth, forcing minor practices into grand ones. Unaware of obstruction or opportunity, they act recklessly, seeking merit where none can be established. Disaster strikes unperceived, and success turns to failure. Some persist unrepentant, turning calamity into fortune; others repent too late, with no chance for recovery. The cycle of the Five Sufferings is profoundly grievous.

Those who aspire to higher learning must scrutinize these truths. In transforming self and others, one must assess capacity—do not expect a mosquito to bear a mountain. Do not wait for failure to awaken. Each method, great or small, possesses its subtleties; cultivate according to ability and sequence, always following the master’s instructions, never relying on one’s own inclinations. The heart is like a monkey or an ape, or like a flickering flame—uncontrollable, ungraspable. Without a master, how can it be corrected? Yet correction also depends on the self. Half lies with the self, half with the master; when the two halves unite, truth is achieved. Without the self, even a master cannot transform; without a master, even the self cannot evolve.

Transformation and change mean abandoning the old for the new, forsaking evil for goodness, refining falsity into truth. The merit of a true master and the virtue of true substance, when harmonized, endure eternally, merging with the Dao.

Those who aspire to study the Dao yet feel shame in learning from a master, who steal scriptures, purchase precepts and commandments, yet fail to grasp their profound meanings and act at will—even if they do not follow sacred texts but follow their nature to do good, their goodness, though genuine, remains incomplete. Partial goodness cannot constitute great virtue. Demons come to corrupt them, leading them into heretical factions, forever severed from the Dao. They labor under the name of learning yet gain no true attainment—this, too, is lamentable.

Such individuals must swiftly repent; early awakening allows salvation, but delay makes success difficult. Learners must reflect on themselves and others. Though others are hard to know, one can discern them through method: observe their conduct and demeanor, examine their inner and outer selves. Heart and body can be understood, truth and falsity can be clarified. Dispel falsity, reward truth—then merit and virtue will manifest.
