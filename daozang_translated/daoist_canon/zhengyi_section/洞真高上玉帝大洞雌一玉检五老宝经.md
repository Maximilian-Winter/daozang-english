**The Supreme Cavernous Perfection Jade Emperor’s Great Cavern Feminine Unity Jade-Inscribed Precious Scripture of the Five Elders**
Composed by the Central Yellow Elder Lord

The *Great Cavern Feminine Unity Jade-Inscribed Precious Scripture of the Five Elders* of the Supreme Cavernous Perfection Jade Emperor supplicates the Twelve Mysterious Mothers, the Eight Intervals, and the Nine Revolutions of the Five Transformations of Feminine and Masculine.

The *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfection Scripture* of the Central Yellow Elder Lord are secretly enshrined in the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, within the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Mystery Numinous Terrace. Purple clouds form its tablets, inscribing its text; azure and verdant hues compose its characters, recording its chapters. The Supreme Primeval Emperor, born of the Upper Origin’s transformations, governs the Middle Seven Nines, ensuring eternal command. Below, He oversees the divine statutes, presiding over the myriad spirits. Feminine and masculine revolve in union, their radiance suffusing the Jade Purity. Vast and boundless, profound and obscure, this is the Supreme Luminous Perfection.

Those who guard this scripture are twenty-seven Jade Maidens, ever tending the incense. Those who attend and protect it are twenty-nine Jade Lads, perpetually treasuring its numinous text. Together, the Jade Lads and Maidens number fifty-six, sworn to prevent its leakage, to safeguard the true scripture, to record merits and illuminate virtue, and to diligently avert calamities.

Beyond the radiance of the divine light, all is adorned with luminous dawns to mark their authenticity. Thus, jade blossoms embellish the forms of the Jade Maidens, and golden dawns crown the visages of the Jade Lads. They drift ethereally above the Nine Mysteries, their brilliance resplendent within the chambers of accumulated resonance. They align with the Six Heavens, their grace profound and serene, their brocade capes streaming with bells, their azure feathered skirts in flight. Girded with primordial talismans, their heads adorned with dawn crowns, they guard those who embody the scripture and assist in the cultivation of perfected beings.

Those who possess this scripture must practice its text. They must constantly dwell in secluded chambers, scattering incense and sweeping away dust. Their spirits nest in the obscure groves, far removed from the human realm. In profound stillness, they relinquish worldly affairs, shedding burdens to embrace the true. Their hearts expand, forgetting strife; they yield to the cavernous root. Alone in secluded chambers, they abstain from grains and pungent flavors, savoring blandness to ascend the heavens. They spit forth saliva to harmonize their fluids, casting off duality to contemplate the Three Hun. Through prolonged austerities, they fast past noon, enduring three years of rigorous purification before being deemed worthy to receive and recite the *Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*.

All must adhere to the covenantal rites; none may transmit it lightly. Those who recklessly leak or profane it shall incur misfortune upon themselves. Those who rashly break their vows shall forfeit longevity. This precious scripture of the Nine Heavens is forbidden by the Four Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who recklessly transmit it to unworthy recipients or fail to scrutinize the recipient’s character shall be deemed guilty of profaning the celestial treasure, offending the Supreme Mystery. The myriad spirits shall denounce them, and the thousand numina shall bring afflictions. Their transgressions shall be reported to the Supreme, their lives erased by the Lord of Emperors. Their bodies shall bear the judgments of the netherworld, their forms severed from the dust. In death, they shall become lowly ghosts, dredging rivers and filling mountains. Even their parents in life and death shall incur guilt in the earthly prisons, suffering torment under the Three Officials. Madness, mutilation, and decay shall be their lot, their calamities vast and obscure.

Calamities arise invariably from reckless and perilous speech, while blessings manifest from the accumulation of goodness. As the body is reflected in the mirror and the echo resounds in the deep valley, the distant responds to the near, and the far must answer the close. There is no remoteness without correspondence, no proximity without verification. Heaven’s retribution is swift though not hasty; the fruition of resonance arrives without movement. How can one not be cautious?

The Supreme’s statutes decree: Those who transmit celestial scriptures and thereby bring misfortune upon their ancestors shall be doubly punished for their reckless speech, to prevent the violation of the covenantal oath.

This scripture is the transformation of the Jade Purity Emperor Lord, the sudden and fleeting convergence of the Cavernous Union, the Supreme Mystery of the Three Primes and the Supreme Ultimate Perfected. It comprises:

1. **The Way of Seven Transformations**: The root of the Great One’s spontaneous generation as the Infant and Elder Brother, and the chapter of the Vast Florescence Lord’s myriad transformations.

Thus, in a glance, the myriad things are illuminated by the Supreme Mystery. In an instant, the celestial pivot turns in harmony. The Infant returns to spontaneous generation, the Muddy Pellet is preserved and stabilized. Leftward, the Nine Heavens revolve; rightward, the Seven Luminaries invert. The Seven Luminaries move with the radiance—this is called the Seven Transformations.

**Feminine Unity in Radiant Union**: The Emperor Lord internally stabilizes. The Five Spirits and Eight Intervals face the Mysterious Mother to the south. Rightward, the Eight Qi revolve, encompassing the myriad transformations. In flight, they disperse, the Great Primeval Infant and Youth. The Nine Perfected receive the qi, the Mysterious Father to the north. Their bodies soar in unison with the heavens, descending into the dawn void.

Those who contemplate the Nine Meditations shall see their golden forms gleam in the Eastern Florescence, their jade bodies shed at the Emperor’s Gate. Their spirits ascend the Five Elders, leaping through the Three Origins. Numinous feathers unfurl in the void, their qi congealing into auspicious clouds. They may generate water and fire from their bodies, emit light for ten thousand fathoms, bear luminous treasures upon their necks, and float through the Nine Dawns. Their forms divide and their radiance scatters, attaining the rank of Supreme Perfected.

Thus, those who attain this Way become Perfected Ones of the Numinous Sovereign; those who lose it descend into the springs of the Nine Earths. The secrets of this Way are the great marvels of the Cavernous Numinous.

Moreover, **Feminine and Masculine Merge as One**: The Emperor Lord transforms subtly. The Great One preserves the spirit; the Mysterious Mother nurtures the infant. Three, Five, Seven, Nine—Nine Revolutions align in splendor. The primordial resonance radiates, marked by the Vast Florescence. This is the attainment of dwelling in the true.

Truly, it is difficult to seek externally; one must inwardly contemplate, dispelling obstructions to achieve profound harmony.

Therefore, immortality may be sought, yet the utmost difficulty lies in perfecting essence. The Perfected may be seen, yet the greatest challenge is in cultivating will and nature. The myriad spirits may be commanded, yet the essential difficulty is in purity and stillness.

Thus, the Great One Emperor Lord uses the Purple Chamber for primordial union; the Mysterious Father and Mysterious Mother employ the Three Terraces as their numinous illumination. The Eight Primes conceal the mystery, with true contemplation as their highest principle. Secret words are the inner scripture of the Nine Perfected; divine methods regard refined contemplation as their deepest essence. The Returned Youth attains the true to achieve numinosity; the Great Cavern regards the Supreme as its primordial origin. The Great Elixir takes the Feminine Unity and Three Primes as its inner essence; the Elder Lord honors spontaneity as the dawn’s veneration. The Supreme venerates the Vast Florescence as the mysterious essence; the Yellow Elder regards will and nature as the root of the Dao. The White Prime enters the true through purity and stillness. The Perfected descend through qi’s convergence; the essentials of immortality are fulfilled through essence’s resonance.

Thus the Feminine Unity ascends to the Muddy Pellet; the Imperial Lord guards the Six Palaces. The Great Cavern is chanted in the chamber of stillness; the Eight Tones disperse through the Nine Orifices. The Seven Examinations receive wisdom from the Womb Immortal, gaining celestial blessings through divine methods. They celebrate the Mysterious Father in the Numinous Capital and congratulate the Mysterious Mother in the Jade Chamber. Accumulated resonance arises within a single inch; scales transform and flourish upon the cloudy peaks. Radiant is the gaze across the Nine Mornings; the body ascends the flowery chariot. How profound! Such blessings cannot be measured.

These are the noble practices of the precious esoterica. Should you contemplate and enact them, you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight. To read the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, one must first read the *Twelve Vows of the Supreme Imperial Lord and the Eight Gates amid the Practices of the Jade Clarity Mysterious Mother*, and next the *Scripture of the Five Spirits of the Central Yellow Elder’s Grotto Chamber*. Only after three years may one receive and read the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*. This is to guide and draw forth the divine fluids, to penetrate the numinous source, to secure and fortify the Purple Chamber, to purify and illumine the Muddy Pellet, to nurture and preserve the Great One, to open and release the Three Barriers, to guard and stabilize the Seven Revolutions, to congeal and harmonize the primordial spirit, to blend and transform the Three and Five, and to encompass the myriad transformations of the Nine Mysteries.

Through revolving cultivation of the womb qi, the gaze meets the Great Vastness. In tranquil communion with the hidden numina, the spirit coils within the empty void. The Twelve Vows accompany one from birth; the practices of the Eight Gates contain the true and roam freely. What the Yellow Elder guards and what the Supreme inscribes—this is called the Feminine Unity, the inception of the Grotto Chamber. To read it ten thousand times is also to attain the Dao of immortality. Yet one has not yet transcended the luminous and floated in the void, nor soared with reins unbound, leaping through the Three Mysteries. One has not yet commanded the chariot of the Eight Effulgences to traverse the Nine Mornings of the clouds, nor ascended into Jade Clarity to become a High Perfected.

Only by reading the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* may one achieve such ascent. Yet those who practice the Feminine Unity must diligently and earnestly resonate, refining the true to its subtlest essence. Only after three years may one receive and read the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*. One must first guard the Great One, blending and uniting with the Imperial Lord, transforming the feminine and masculine, and contemplating the principles of the Nine Perfected. Next, one chants the Great Vows, linking the Twelve, and then sings the verses between the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother. Following this, one reads the *Hidden Mystery of the Great Elixir’s Grotto Chamber* to establish immortality, which is called "certain transcendence."

Those referred to as "Primal Lords" are all feminine spirits. The Feminine Unity, the Three Primes of the Grotto Chamber, and the Three Primal Ladies are such. One must first contemplate the Three Primes of the Grotto Chamber for three years before receiving and reading the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*. The *Great Cavern* is called a true scripture precisely because contemplating the Three Primal Ladies is difficult. Those who can subtly refine their essence and resonate to the utmost, who can contemplate and perceive the Three Prime Ladies, have fulfilled the Dao of the Perfected.

The White Prime Lady is the mother of the Right White Prime Lord. Should you contemplate her with utmost precision, the Dao of transcendence is achieved. The Yellow Prime Lady is the mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord. Should you perceive her, you shall live ten thousand years; beyond ten thousand years, you shall ascend the Three Mysteries. The Purple Prime Lady is the mother of the Left Vast Florescence. If, while contemplating the Grotto Chamber, you suddenly perceive the Three Primal Ladies, you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, wearing the tinkling bells and tiger talismans, roaming the Upper Clarity.

The *Hidden Book of the Great Elixir* regards the Three Primes as the utmost essence—this is what it means. The Three Prime Ladies of the Grotto Chamber are the mothers of the White Prime, Vast Florescence, and Yellow Elder Lords, and thus are called the Three Prime Ladies; they are all women. These three women share one mother, who is called the Grand Prime Three Primal Lady. The Grand Prime Three Primal Lady is truly a single woman. This one woman gave birth to three daughters, hence they are called the Three Prime Ladies.

According to this, the Vast Florescence, Yellow Elder, and White Prime Lords are the children of the Three Prime Three Primal Ladies and thus the grandchildren of the Grand Prime Three Primal Lady. They coalesced from empty wombs, born upon flowery radiance, and were also born in the Heaven of the Nine Mysteries of the Jeweled Prime and Jade Sovereign of the Supreme Clarity. They descended into the Grotto Chamber and ascended together with one’s own body. Their three male lords reside in the Flowery Chamber of the Upper Primordial Void—namely, the White Prime, Vast Florescence, and Yellow Elder, all of whom are men. They received life from the Void Perfected, forming the shapes of the three males, endowed with the numinous harmony and jade dawn’s primordial qi. Thus they coalesced and were born from the void, becoming human—not formed through the union of yin and yang.

Moreover, the White Prime, Vast Florescence, and Central Yellow Elder are also titles of the offices of the Perfected in the Heaven of Upper Clarity. There are also true transcendents whose essence has attained the scriptures and positions, corresponding to these titles, not all of whom were born from the void. Among the various heavens, all also have such beings.

Those who are born from the void are nearly the wondrous prime essences of the cavern’s mystery, uniting with the true and flourishing in radiance. Their bodies equal the vast brilliance; their spirits pervade the Nine Mysteries. Through resonance, they suddenly come into being, harmonizing their qi with the cloudy void. Their numinous radiance fans upward, transforming the myriad directions. Thus, before breath takes form, they respond to things upon contact. Where resonance reaches, heaven and earth descend in exchange.

If the heart is not unified, a hundred concerns converge; if the spirit is not subtle, the qi is not true. If thought does not resonate, the Dao does not abide; if essence is not secure, one drifts far from the Dao. Do not look upon corpses or blood, nor let death and injury disturb life. Do not harbor defilement in the heart. Do not indulge in unchaste conduct; do not intoxicate the Dao. Do not let the five flavors overflow; do not engage with duplicity. Do not seek life through deviance; do not entertain demonic trials. Do not regard ghosts as numinous; do not advance through glory and emolument. Do not let adornments overflow; do not treasure wealth. Do not act unjustly; do not delight in the mundane. Do not contend for worldly rank; do not let competition disrupt the true. Do not let the ears be swayed by sounds; do not be burdened by filth and turbidity. When true transcendents depart from your courtyard, contemplate without resonance—it is truly because the body is not refined. Should you comprehend the precepts of the *Great Cavern*, the myriad spirits will dissolve and attain tranquility.

The things one ought not to do are indeed many. Yet if one must sever the reins and roam the empty vastness, nest the heart in the Cavern’s gate, embody the serene and the pure, and guard the spirit in the hidden origin; if one must bow one’s head before the window of the scripture master and beseech the opening of the Gate of Profound Mystery—then the strong shall surely weaken, the rigid shall surely break. Only then will Heaven’s sincerity lie open beyond all bounds, and the Cavern’s depths exude fragrance without end. Yet those who attain this naturally are few, and to study and practice it is difficult.

Should you resolve to embody the feminine One and delve into the *Great Cavern*, do not forget these words. The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* does not exist in the world below, upon the earth, or even among the Five Peaks in heaven. The Perfected of the Upper Clarity treasure and guard it most closely. Only after three years of austere fasting may one be permitted to read it. Should one recite the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* in its thirty-nine chapters ten thousand times, the Central Yellow Elder Lord will memorialize on high, and the Most High shall command the cinnabar-gale chariot with its green canopy. The Nine Numinous Envoys and the Great One Who Oversees Destiny shall come to welcome you. Then the Five Elders shall flank your carriage, the Eight Winds shall fan your wings, divine lightning shall lead the way, and jade blossoms shall support the wheels. You may then ride the clouds and mount the dragon, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, proceeding to the Palace of the Three Primes in the Great Simplicity to receive the scripture.

Those who master the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* shall ever ride the yellow and white twin clouds, commanding thirty-two jade maidens and thirty-two jade lads. They shall bear the azure-furred tally, mount azure radiance dragons, wear the talisman of the divine tiger, and don the lotus crown. Clad in purple embroidered robes and vermilion flying skirts, they shall shake resounding streamer bells and strike jade chimes. The Jade Perfected shall reveal the moon-bright mirror, and the Golden Immortals shall bear the Nine Profound Chapters. Purple canopies shall shade the four directions, and flowered banners shall encircle the wheels. They shall also bear the nine red-spotted patterns to seal mountains and summon clouds. At dawn, they ascend the Golden Hall of the Great Ultimate; at dusk, they wander the Mystic Center of Mount Taihua. Inscribing golden script, they become lofty Perfected, wielding the scriptures of the immortals and commanding the myriad spirits. Their rank shall be Left Minister of the Great Ultimate and King of the Lesser Existence, attending the imperial throne within and feasting in the Golden Court without.

Should they fully practice the alignment of brilliance, condense radiance into luminous essence, let qi roam the Eight Purities, and embody the jade dawn; should they chant the Three and Five, harmonize with the Nine Perfected, conceal the great light’s splendor, and soar with the Jade Mystery; should they uphold the dispelling of demons and master the tiger-patterned writ—then they may harness the Three Origins, inscribe the jade Perfected, turn their carriage toward the cold blossoms, and array the ranks of the lofty Perfected. Their rank shall be Left and Right Immortal Lords of the Great Ultimate, commanding the Five Offices and the Three Heavenly Immortal Officials, with jade lads and maidens attending in due measure.

According to the statutes of the Jade Emperor, when opening the scripture, one must first dismiss attendants, wash hands, feet, face, and eyes, and only then may one gaze upon it. One should also constantly burn incense to the left and right, signifying the loftiness of numinous virtue. Store it in a separate case to distinguish it from the gates of all other wonders. Thus, harmonious tones arise in chanting, startling the Eight Profounds into clarity; qi ascends to the pure heavens, moistening the Nine Fordings. They summon the hidden splendor of the numinous radiance, polishing the decayed and aged to endure forever.

When the subtle voice is sung, incense smoke scatters in the void, moving the Supreme August of the Formless and penetrating the Original Perfected of the Great Simplicity. Luminous qi revolves ninefold, spirit and essence traverse the eight meridians. Great blessings are bestowed upon the mysterious lineage, and primordial felicity spreads to the closest kin. Thus, both the living and the dead benefit, as seven generations are fanned above. Transformed at the Southern Ford, ancestors and forebears are eternally preserved. The body abides in the cinnabar palace, determining the immortal embryo of rebirth.

Great indeed is this wondrous scripture, its numinous chapters vast and profound, its profundity and marvel beyond measure. Its chapters and titles are listed below; let the student take note.

**Jade Scripture Formula of the Central Yellow Elder Lord**
To receive the formula of the *Great Cavern* is to master the *Supreme Wish of the Feminine and Masculine Transformations of the Cavern’s First One*, the *Hidden Book of Golden Radiance of the Eight Chambers of the Mysterious Mother*, which is the forbidden scripture held in the embrace of the Nine Heavenly Lords. When transmitting it to a disciple, one must first perform a hundred days of fasting before and after the transmission, followed by another hundred days of pure fasting, only then may it be conferred. For the middle fasting, seventy days; for the lesser, thirty-nine days. Austerity must accompany the transmission.

Should one transmit it without discerning the recipient’s worth, or confer it without fasting, the scripture master shall die, and the recipient shall lose both eyes. Should the fasting lack rigor, the scripture master shall fall ill, and the recipient shall lose the power of speech. The weight of this rests upon the scripture master; do not treat it lightly. Calamity befalls the disciple; guard your eyes and mouth. Transgressions bring grave misfortune to seven generations, and suffering binds the living to the hidden ancestors.

Should one receive this scripture, transmit it, and practice it, one must not transgress or grow lax. In the three fasts, serve the master as one would a sovereign or father. Dwell in a secluded chamber in a quiet grove, as if in solitude without others. Preserve the Five Spirits in the purple chamber as if the true numina were present. Do not receive it from anyone other than one’s sovereign, master, father, son, or brother—this demonstrates the proper use of the numinous and the difficulty of violating its prohibitions. Do not enter the chambers of anyone other than one’s sovereign, master, father, son, or brother—this shows the narrowness of one’s steps and the embrace of the hidden and unified. Do not wear the garments of anyone other than one’s sovereign, master, father, son, or brother—this shows the restraint of celestial kinship and the self-regulation of abundance.

Refine the wondrous awakening of celestial essence, sever all attachments to worldly thoughts, and let supreme conduct be revealed through hardship. Erase all traces as if merging with the shadowless, suffice with three meals from mountain streams, and let secret sincerity be manifest near and far. Then shall one swiftly ascend to the chamber of the Five Elders, and virtue shall rise to the Three Clarities. Preserve inner concentration in luminous jade, so that robes and headscarves remain unstained. Contemplate the Three Origins in the mud-pill palace, guard the Nine Perfected in the bodily abode, exhale and inhale the Five Radiance, and breathe the jade liquid. Morning and evening, seek immortality in the empty cavern; in sleep and waking, invoke the spirit in the great desert. Be diligent without weariness, assiduous without rest. Only such a person may begin to seek the gates of the *Great Cavern* and partake in the wondrous contemplation of the Dao.

Those who uphold it ascend to the Three Mornings and wander the Nine Empyreans; those who defy it sink into the Three Paths and enter the Nine Netherworlds. In transmission, the scriptures and precepts must be revealed anew—never bestowed all at once. First, impart the method and precepts, instructing the disciple to practice visualization, refine the Five Forms, contemplate the Purple Chamber, purge impurities to purify the subtle, and steadfastly guard the One with unwavering devotion, morning and evening invoking the numinous.

Thus, the Great Elixir conceals its mystery, known as the *Scripture of Golden Florescence*. The Three Origins and Jade Mornings are called the Essence of the Feminine One. After three years of cultivating and preserving the Feminine One, one may then receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern*. Even with this precept alone, its practice ensures transcendence—there is no need to await the full transmission of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*.

For those who wish to traverse the Five Peaks, observe the myriad mountains, preserve their form and halt the whitening of hair, and extend their years through kalpas—yet do not seek to soar far from the world—on the days of the Grand Year’s cyclical return, the Eight Nodal Festivals, they may simply recite the *Hidden Invocation of Jade Clarity* and inwardly visualize the Hundred Spirits once, without the labor of reciting the Jade Scripture. After a hundred recitations, qi ascends to the Morning Empyreans, and the Hundred Spirits coil within. After a thousand recitations, the Three Origins descend, and one’s name is inscribed in the Emperor’s register, eternally preserving the longevity of sun, moon, heaven, and earth. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is perfected: one rides clouds and mounts dragons, roaming the Great Void, commanding the host of immortals.

This Dao is lofty and wondrous—it is not transmitted to the unworthy. When sincerity in visualization is profound, aligning with the true and facing the numinous, the Three Origins manifest. Upon obtaining this scripture, the Mystic Numinous descends to bestow it; the Yellow and Venerable reveal its talismans, the Five Elders scatter blossoms, and one receives it in the void—then ascends to the Great Nonbeing.

The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* is also called the *Scripture of the Great Dao and Virtue of the Nine Heavens and Supreme Perfected*. Its composition originates from the Mystic Subtlety, compiled by the Primordial Celestial Worthy of the Ten Directions through the circulation of qi. The Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Celestial King and, together, inscribed it in the Northern Primordial Heaven, in the land of Naxie, on the Mountain of the Spirit-Bound and Feathered People, within the Grotto of the Master. In the midst of the void, they gathered the qi of the Nine Mysteries and Orthodox Unity, binding it to transmit to the Central Yellow Venerable of the Eight Perfected of Highest Clarity, instructing those destined to become Perfected Ones and ascend to the Three Mornings. Thus, its text is rare in the world, and few obtain it.

The Jade Lads and Jade Maidens bear upon their faces the radiance of Jade Florescence and Golden Mornings, their forms illumined by effulgent light. Those lacking this cannot don the Moon Canopy to ascend the Great Existence, nor may they pluck the hidden blossoms of the magic mushrooms, nor ride the whirlwind’s chariot, grasp the reins of the Green Canopy, and ascend to the Nine Empyreans. One must diligently contemplate with arduous effort, refining and discerning the subtle numinous—only then will the Dao draw near, and the Hundred Perfected come to aid. Those who cannot embrace a heart of utmost conduct and seek the profound in bitter solitude will only reproach themselves—what can they hope for?

The scriptures of the Great Cavern are the wondrous precepts of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Golden Writ of the Supreme Primordial Sovereign of Grand Simplicity. The Central Yellow Venerable concealed and guarded these scriptures, so the world knows them not. Only in the Great Mystery are there golden pavilions and jade names, vermilion tablets and purple slips; in the Three Origins, the Hidden Records of the Conjoined Mornings; in the Cinnabar Terrace, the Yellow-Writ People—those destined to become Perfected Ones—may receive them. After ten thousand recitations of this scripture, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight, mounts Highest Clarity, receives the writ in the Supreme Ultimate, and is appointed as a High Immortal of the Left Minister.

Yet even those who possess this scripture but do not recite it—the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity erases their death records at the outset of receiving the scripture, establishes their true register at the beginning of the purification rite, inscribes their name in the Eastern Florescence, petitions the Supreme, and seals their record in the Tortoise Terrace. The myriad spirits and thousand gods will address the adept as the Grand Master of the Great Mystery, their rank corresponding to the Immortal Earl of Supreme Clarity. With this, one may traverse the world without hindrance. The conduct of immortals ever harmonizes with fortune and auspiciousness.

When entering deep valleys, remote marshes, or mountains and rivers teeming with venomous beasts, stone toxins, dragons, and malevolent spirits—where temple shrines harbor fierce ghosts—face north and recite the titles of the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* three times, then conclude by knocking the teeth thirty-nine times. Thus, mountain spirits and all harm dare not assail you.

Further, face north and invoke:
*"The Nine Divinities of the Supreme, the Eight Numinous arrayed in majesty—I am the Left Minister of the Great Ultimate of the Lesser Existence and True Morning. Formerly, I received the oral precepts of my divine teacher, the method to slay demons, and the* Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*. To my left, the Dragon and Tiger repel misfortune; to my right, the Fire Armor and Golden Blade. Before and behind, guardian soldiers descend to dispel inauspiciousness. Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend me, burning incense. Let the mountain spirits and temple wardens swiftly come to receive and greet me, submitting as decreed by the supreme law of the Great Cavern."*
Conclude by knocking the teeth twenty-seven times. This is the method of invoking the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* before receiving it.

Once the scripture is obtained, when traversing the netherworld or encountering mountain spirits and malevolent ghosts, none dare approach. One may command the myriad spirits, summon dragons and clouds, roam the most remote and mysterious peaks—all mountain deities will come to receive you, and there will be no obstruction.

Moreover, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens ever attend the scripture and guard its bearer. In all movements, comings, and goings, wherever one turns, constantly visualize and inwardly recite. With each hand, stroke the heart and invoke:
*"The* Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign, binds souls and restrains spirits—all myriad spirits come to attend."*
Then, with the hand, stroke the Cavern Chamber fourteen times, and secretly invoke:
*"The Three Lords of the Upper Origin, the Purple Canopy and Flourishing Morning, the Jade Lad guards my spirit, the Jade Maiden pacifies my soul. The Five Viscera and Hundred Spirits nurture my body, granting longevity to heaven and earth. Ascend as a High Immortal, the sun and moon submit, the Seven Stars preserve my truth. The Supreme receives the writ, the Three Florescence secure my destiny."*

When the incantation is complete, strike the teeth three times to dispel the fierce *qi* of both inner and outer realms.

Those referred to as "Later Sages" are all sovereigns who attained the Dao in later ages. Only those who align with the *Golden Writ of the Great Cavern*, harmonize with the True One of the Supreme Sovereign, array the Three Origins in radiant display, equal the numinous powers of the Most High, match the luminaries at dawn, and balance the Seven Subtleties in purity may be called Later Sages. Merely reciting this scripture allows one to ride clouds and mount dragons, assuming the rank of Perfected Duke or Minister, repose in the Nine Mysteries, and roar defiance to the Eight Directions. One may soar with plumes through the Broad Cold, or dance wheels across the Void Unison—thus becoming a Perfected One, though not yet a Later Sage. Yet through prolonged fasting and ascetic practice of this *Cavern Scripture*, one naturally attains the long life of divine immortals.

If one possesses this scripture but does not maintain prolonged fasting or meditative contemplation, mingling instead with worldly conduct, one may still achieve hidden preservation as a Lesser Immortal, undergo corpse-liberation at noon, or pass beyond the Great Yin to become a ruler of the underworld. Alternatively, one may leave behind a bone embryo and undergo transformation in the Southern Palace. Those destined by their innate register to receive this scripture are certain to become Immortal Lords.

When immortals depart this world, some vanish without trace, inwardly tending to external affairs; others unbind their swords to substitute forms, leaving only a staff and their body, drifting like mist and clouds, extending their spirit to lodge in the mysterious. Among the drifting multitudes, few discern the threads of their departure. If one dwells in renowned mountains and the Five Peaks, refining contemplation over time, or severs worldly dust for ages in the human realm; if celestial perfected ones bestow scriptures, or high immortals transmit teachings; if the Five Spirits are moved, or the Three Origins reveal signs—then through secret seeking and silent enlightenment, one attains serene joy within the heart, the body perfected and concealed in the numinous chariot. Suddenly, one ascends the jeweled carriage, transcending to soar upon the wheel of empty space. Gazing upward, the vast emptiness fans open; feet dangle above the Five Peaks; hands grasp bright auroras; *qi* refines and blessings coalesce. In the span of waking and sleeping, one traverses ninety thousand *li*.

Thus, the ascent of those who attain the Dao cannot be recorded by ordinary means—how subtle and profound! It is not merely a matter of disbelief.

The *Cavern Scripture* is precious: the one who possesses it is the master, and the one who receives it is the disciple. With a cinnabar heart and utmost devotion, uphold it without fail. The recipient must not privately disclose its contents; any disclosure will surely incur loss in the unseen realm. For each scripture shared, one Jade Lad and one Jade Maiden are diminished. The celestial statutes have been fixed since the Great Beginning. Disclosing to two people prevents one from becoming a Perfected One; disclosing to three prevents one from becoming an immortal. If shared with those who do not believe in the Dao and virtue, the Jade Lad and Jade Maiden will report to the Most High Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign, causing the disciple to lose the Dao, perish, and lose the scripture unawares. It may vanish through mountain fires, burning houses, windblades, banditry, or other calamities. The disciple becomes a lesser ghost, and the seven generations of ancestors suffer punishment—how lamentable!

When reading the Hidden Writ of the Lord Emperor or practicing the *Three Primordials of the Cavern Chamber* and the *Feminine One*, always keep a bright mirror—six, five, or four *cun* in diameter, made of copper or iron—clear and free of blemishes. Hang it above the sleeping place to harmonize the Three Spirits and restrain the myriad evils.

The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* is the jade formula of celestial perfected ones, the original text of golden writ and jade characters. Those who attain it walk the empty mystery, soar on clouds, and ride the void, ascending to supplement the ranks of high immortals—these are the long-lived, flying adepts.

The *Great Possession* is the Purple Palace of the Nine Heavens, hence its name. The *Lesser Possession* is the foremost of the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens of Clear Emptiness, the numinous palace of the Cavern Mystery’s hidden essence and the Primordial Dawn. Within the *Great* and *Lesser Possessions*, divine scriptures and sacred texts are not always complete. Only on the western Tortoise Mountain, above the Jade Terrace of the Accumulated Stones, within the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber, are the *Eight Primordials of the Great Cavern* and the *Feathered Chapters of the High Mystery* fully preserved. Only those destined for the Dao, whose innate register marks them as Perfected Ones, may receive them. Upon receiving them, one may ride clouds and mount dragons, commanding the myriad spirits.

Among a million aspiring immortals, not one may glimpse even the titles of these texts. The Golden Gates of Heaven, the Azure Bureaus of the Square Cauldrons, and the Earthly Offices all inscribe the registers before birth, determining who may receive and hear them. Those who attain them become companions and teachers of true immortals.

To summon the *Controller of Destiny* and the *Recorder of Lives*, remove one’s own name and that of those one cherishes from the registers of death, and petition the Three Officials to erase the names of worldly transgressions—further, to revise the ledgers of mortal lives in Mount Tai—there is the method of the *Seven Revolutions of the Cavern*. First read the *Scripture of the Supreme Ultimate*, then the *Scripture of True Yang*, then the *Scripture of the Great One*, then the *Scripture of the Nine Elders*, then the *Scripture of the Azure Lad*, then the *Scripture of the Later Sage Lord Li*, and finally the *Scripture of the Lesser Possession*. Upon completion, one may perform five transformations and seven revolutions in a month. A *revolution* means reading seven times, called a *passage*; five passages in a month are called *five transformations*. The *Cavern Scripture* has its own text—one must not overdo it.

To summon the Recorder, gather the Three Officials, remove the registers of death, and command them at will: after one passage of seven revolutions, the Recorder will arrive immediately. When performing the rite, one should also invoke divine beings to inspire and enlighten the disciple’s heart.

After the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, there are the *Three Lifts of the Square-Zhang Thunder-Spirit Talismans*, each character a *zhang* in size, written in cinnabar on mountain stones to summon the Northern Emperor, the Controller of Destiny, the Perfected Ones of the Five Peaks, and the Three Officials of Mount Tai. The disciple should sit upon this talisman, face north, and perform one passage of the *Seven Revolutions of the Cavern Scripture*. Then the myriad spirits will arrive immediately to address matters of life and death, and the erasure of registers. One should refer to oneself as the *Great Cavern Grandee*, the Master of the Most High.

This talisman is one talisman, also called the *Three Perfected Numinous Talismans*. There are separate annotations and oral instructions for it. One should use colored silk as its base, each side a *zhang* in length, filling it entirely with cinnabar script. The scroll may be rolled to any size as desired. It should always be kept within one’s bedding. By sitting or lying upon this talisman while reciting the *Cavern Scripture*, visualizing the *Emperor One*, one may conduct the affairs of the *Great Cavern*.

Another method is to sit or lie upon the talisman, with a space of three *chi* on each side to contain the talismanic script—it need not be strictly a *zhang* in size.

The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* itself contains the *Scripture of the Golden Elixir of the Jade Hall Immortal Mother of the Western Flower*, which may be purified and compounded in a fasting retreat. Once the elixir is completed and ingested, one may return to the human realm, partake of food, and move among the mundane world, thus attaining the rank of a true immortal and concealing one’s transformations across the eight directions.

If one recites the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* without ingesting this elixir, upon completing ten thousand recitations, one will immediately ascend to heaven upon clouds, no longer able to remain in the world or delight in the mortal realm.

If one ingests this elixir after three hundred days, one may wander the world for long ages.

Those who obtain the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* have already been tested by the *Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate* and passed, thus gaining access to this scripture. They need not wait for ten thousand recitations to be tested.

By thoroughly mastering the scripture and annotating its true essence, one may attain the ranks of *Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate* and *Immortal Minister*, ascend to the *Nine Heavens*, and serve the *Three Primordial Lords of the Dawn*.

Among the inner true ranks of the *Great Cavern*, there is the method of the *Yellow Tranquility Inner Invocation*, which states: *Yellow Tranquility* is the wandering spirit of the *Gate of Life*, who constantly accompanies the *Great Lord Peach Vitality* into the *Yellow Chamber*. It resides one *cun* above the center of the breasts.

At dusk, one should knock the teeth thirty-four times, rub both breasts with the hands, and swallow saliva seven times, then invoke:

*Great Lord Peach Vitality, born of the inner dawn of the womb,
Adorned with pearl robes and jade bells, dispersing qi from the seven sources,
Crowned with a purple canopy of blossoms, standing directly at the Gate of Life,
Supporting the body and pacifying the spirit, refining and gathering the three hun,
Achieving long life and riding the light, ascending to immortality in broad daylight,
True Person of the Yellow Chamber, clad in yellow essence,
Harmonizing the true flowing qi, circulating it throughout the body,
Summoning the hun and restraining the po, ensuring enduring life,
Drawing left and restraining right, concealing the body in yellow numinosity,
Then mounting the cloud chariot, ascending to the Supreme Clarity.*

After the invocation, one’s hun and po will be calm and settled, and auspicious signs will frequently manifest.

The *Supreme Simplicity Scripture of the Upper Numinosity* states: Those permitted to receive the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* may transmit it three times within five hundred years; beyond this, it may not be transmitted again. If one reverses the womb-casket and departs, erasing traces and leaving the world, the transmission may be entrusted at the moment of final deliverance. If no suitable recipient exists, both the transmitter and the text will return to the *Chamber of Great Yin*. If transmitted to an unworthy person, even between father and son, it violates the netherworld’s judgment, bringing calamity upon seven generations. Be cautious!

**The Great Cyclic Return of the Five Penetrations of the Supreme One Emperor Lord**

The *Twelve Vows of the Supreme One Great Cyclic Return Five Penetrations Emperor Lord* and the *Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother’s Movement* involve eight positions for the qi of sacrificial wine and dried meat. During invocations, if these rare fruits are absent, the offering is incomplete; if present, they should be presented.

The reason for this is to announce to the luminous dawn of the *Nine Heavens* and to demonstrate the summoning of spirits through the qi of sacrificial wine. It is also to employ the qi of the sun’s brilliance and the moon’s radiance, reflecting upon the *Eastern Well*.

On the ninth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the seventh day of the third month, the sixth day of the fourth month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the fourth day of the sixth month, the third day of the seventh month, the second day of the eighth month, the first day of the ninth month, the tenth day of the tenth month, the eleventh day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month—conduct the rites within a secluded chamber. Do not harbor impure qi, nor tread upon defiled ground.

The *Great Cyclic Return of the Golden Flower and Supreme Cavern Dao* is never transmitted to those unworthy of immortality. The Way of the Five Star Immortal Hall is termed the *Jiao* ritual; its minor details are passed orally, and its recorded secrets must not be lightly inscribed.

**The Eight Gates and Twelve Vows of the Supreme Cavern Golden Flower Jade August Lord**

The *Twelve Vows of the Emperor Lord* are titled:
Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth, Vow to Wind, Vow to Cloud, Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang, Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Supreme Non-Being, Vow to the Great Emptiness, Vow to the Great Possession, Vow to Self-Generation, Vow to Spirit-Generation.

The *Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother* are titled:
May the Mysterious Mother be born with me amidst the qi of life,
May she abide with me between the sun and moon,
May she protect me within the Nine Heavens,
May she dine with me in the realm of spontaneity,
May she drink with me from the Gourd River,
May she rest with me in the Jade Reality,
May she slumber with me in the Immortal Hall,
May she wander with me through the Three Mysteries.

The *Twelve Vows of the Nine Heavens Emperor Lord* and the *Eight Gates of the Nine Numinous Mysterious Mother*, when invoked through the *Great Cyclic Return of the Five Penetrations*, dispel worldly calamities, bestow blessings upon the seven ancestors, and enable one’s body to attain immortality.

In the stillness of the secluded chamber, scatter incense and align the smoke, then recite the *Supreme Cavern Golden Flower Jade Scripture*:

Northern Culmen Heavenly Sovereign,
Supreme One Emperor Lord,
Jade Clarity and Purple Emptiness,
Dual Radiance shining perfectly,
The unsurpassed Great Dao,
The Three Primordials of Supreme Simplicity,
Four Directions and Five Elders,
Six Canopies and Seven Dawns,
Eight Superiors and Nine Numinous Ones,
Concealed Dao and Cyclic Return,
Mysterious Mother and Five Penetrations,
Golden Flower High Immortals,
Life-Commanding Heavenly Masters,
Great Spirits of Generation,
Qi of the Supreme Tenuity,
Invoked for this *Jiao* rite.

Above, vow to the Nine Mysteries,
Guard the po and support the hun,
Brighten the primordial qi of True Reality,
All converging within the body.
Look up to summon the supreme,
The Five Penetrations Great Immortals,
Look down to reach the lowest,
Concealed Dao and Cyclic Return.
Sins accumulated over seven generations,
Now dissolved and scattered,
Receive blessings in the Southern Palace,
Sprinkle incense at the Eight Gates.

Vow to Heaven, Vow to Earth, Vow to Wind, Vow to Cloud—
Four vows as one,
Registering eternal life,
Heaven’s canopy nurturing the root of the embryo,
Earth aiding the luminous essence,
Divine winds fanning eight directions,
Scenic clouds flowing abundantly.
I and the Emperor Lord,
Together soaring to the Upper Clarity,
Gazing upon the Northern Mystery,
Loosening the sash in the Jade Court,
Celebrating the seven ancestors,
Mysterious tally yielding purity,
The four vows reaching fulfillment,
Lifespan equaling the sun’s decline.

The middle four vows govern the Emperor’s scriptures:
Vow to Yin, Vow to Yang, Vow to the Great Void, Vow to the Supreme Non-Being.
The Three and Five luminous spirits,
Dwelling in the Seven and Nine,
The Emperor Lord’s primordial father,
Determining life’s inception.
The Jade Sovereign commands the chariot,
Ever abiding in my dwelling.
Within, store the Purple Chamber,
Mud-Pill Palace and Peach Health,
Consolidate yin and secure the blood,
The hun born of the Great Yang.
Spiritual void reflecting radiance,
Supreme Non-Being treading longevity,
The Nine Qi of Emptiness,
Adorning my yellow robes.
Seven tallies conferring blessings,
Receiving immortality in the Southern Palace.

The lower four vows:
Eternal life in the Immortal Palace,
Thus the Vow to the Great Emptiness and Vow to the Great Possession,
Spirit abiding in the Nine Heavens,
Form dwelling in the True Realm.
The Emperor Lord in harmonious union,
Wandering with the seven ancestors,
Misfortune departing my chamber,
Fortune coming to my grasp,
Evil words vanishing,
Auspicious words flourishing.
Further, the Vow to Self-Generation—
Heaven and Earth as father,
Further, the Vow to Spirit-Generation—
Harmonious qi as mother.
The Cyclic Return of the Five Penetrations,
Pardoning and cleansing transgressions,
Blessings crowning seven generations,
Surpassing life’s limits eternally.

Vows uttered to the August Sovereign,
The Emperor Lord in harmonious chant,
Chanting voices soaring to the clouds,
Eight echoes resounding myriad times,
Spiritual missives borne in reverse,
A thousand perfected ones reciting in unison,
From kalpa to kalpa,
Meeting the twelvefold celebration.

Great is the Emperor Lord’s grace,
Myriad blessings mirrored in the Cyclic Return.

Further, the Eight Gates of the Mysterious Mother,
Creating the eightfold chant of the spirit,
Nine Numinous Ones gazing in unison.

The first vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she be born with me amidst the qi of life,
Enabling the Purple Radiance to illuminate the void,
Heavenly and human tallying in accord,
Flying immortals ascending on wings,
And I with them,
Heavenly music delighting the heart,
Liberated from a hundred sorrows,
Seven Mysteries rejoicing,
Upheld by the Upper Numinous Ones.

The second vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she abide with me between the sun and moon,
At the juncture of the Three Lights,
The Great Emperor’s chariot procession,
Azure pennants and green canopies,
Floral chariots and embroidered robes,
Broidered garments and jade belts,
Escorting the Five Elders,
Together attending the Four Great Ones,
Entering the feast in the Floral Dawn,
Gazing beyond the Eight Extremities.

The third vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she protect me within the Nine Heavens,
Thus consolidating True Radiance,
Cultivating the heart within,
Qi overflowing the spiritual root,
Inspiring myriad spirits,
Body ascending the Nine Empyreans,
Tallying blessings in the profound mystery,
Loosening the sash in the Void Union,
Guiding the wheel of the Dawn Heaven,
Auspiciously bestowing upon seven generations,
Reborn as human,
I safeguard the Supreme Perfected,
Lifespan equaling the sun.

The fourth vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she dine with me in the realm of spontaneity,
Forever departing the Three Paths,
Eternally meeting in spontaneity,
Jade grains and golden elixir,
Purple rays concealed within,
Gathering left and right,
Night-glowing phoenix embryos,
Tiger froth and cloud jades,
Jasper frost and rare flavors,
One taste and the body ascends,
Brushing the Great Void.

The fifth vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she drink with me from the Gourd River,
Where flowing springs cascade myriad cliffs,
Both clear and sweet,
Eddying waters of Jade Clarity,
Spiritual waves of azure blue,
Pouring upward to the Absolute Empyrean,
Flowing into the Spirit Hall,
Transverse waves surging,
Fanning the Great Void,
Floating and roaming in vast clarity,
Drinking and rinsing at Eastern Meng,
Scooping high the rosy dawn,
Marvelous joy in the azure waves,
Seven tallies attaining immortality,
Abundant blessings overflowing,
Body pledged to the Nine Rivers,
All directions attaining well-being.

The sixth vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she rest with me in the Jade Reality,
Vast the upper seat,
Moistening the distant Empyrean clarity,
Five Elders arrayed in the chamber,
Jade Flower announcing the numinous,
Western Jade soaring chariots,
Wandering through the void in flowing carriages,
Resting with me in the Nine Mysteries’ court,
Celebrating the seven ancestors,
Receiving the embryo and rebirth,
Body coiled in the Jasper Palace,
Spirit nesting in perfect clarity.

The seventh vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she rest with me in the Immortal’s Hall,
In the secluded numinous chamber,
Mysterious blossoms arrayed on all sides,
Crimson halls phoenix-wrought,
Luminous radiance illuminating the carriage,
Golden lungs and jade couches,
Purple curtains and dragon gates,
Above sits the Mysterious Sovereign,
At the center the Heavenly Perfected,
I dwell at her left,
Entwined in tender embrace,
Great blessings through seven trials,
Receiving the scripture and rebirth as immortal.

The eighth vow to the Mysterious Mother:
May she wander with me through the Three Mysteries,
Guiding reins across the great desert,
Turning carriages through the Three Mysteries,
The Five Elders supporting the axle,
The Jade Mother at her side,
Dancing wheels on the divine mound,
Halting chariots in the Nine Heavens,
The Supreme Script fixed,
Invested as Perfected,
Feminine unity merging ninefold,
From billions to thousands,
Penetrating the Eight Resonances of the Cavern Scripture,
Seven ancestors attaining immortality,
From kalpa to kalpa,
Ever meeting in the Eight Intervals.

Where lie the Eight Intervals?
Eternally within my karmic affinity,
The Five Elders descend with blessings,
Virtue and power flourishing,
Myriad qi ascending,
Together guarding the Mud Pill Palace.

The vows now complete,
Sun and moon sharing the same span,
The profound subtlety of the Supreme Dao,
Vast and voidly mysterious,
The Mysterious Mother’s movement and stillness,
Within the Eight Gates.

The adept in a separate chamber,
Must constantly recite this scripture,
Not forgetting for even a moment,
This is the Inner Vow of the Lord of Emperors,
Who opens the Eight Auspicious Gates.

Now the immortals of the Five Peaks,
And the divine maidens of the Sacred Land,
Still pour jade nectar and gather rare fruits,
Uttering great vows,
Declaring the Eight Intervals,
Paying homage to the Primordial Simplicity,
Honoring the Three Origins,
Aspiring to the Rosy Dawn,
Becoming Jade Perfected,
Delivering seven generations,
Entering the Broad Cold Palace—
How could the vulgar and base of the mundane world,
The petty and lowly of the Five Turbidities,
Compare to them?
How can one abandon cultivation,
Or hear and not act?

Though form and spirit be refined,
They suffer through endless rebirths,
And if the seven generations bear sins
That remain unresolved,
One too will have no hope of immortality.
Thus must one invoke great vows,
Declare the Eight Intervals,
To dissolve accumulated knots.

When the seven ancestors receive blessings,
The adept may then escape death.
To escape death
Is the fundamental principle of attaining the Dao,
The root origin of becoming immortal.
Those who aspire to this practice,
How can they not strive for eternal existence?

**Central Yellow Elder Lord’s Great Cinnabar: The Cavern Chamber’s Inner Scripture Method**

Heaven possesses divine palaces,
The Supreme Mystery’s cinnabar and numinous,
The Emperor’s Gate at the center,
Gazing upon the Mud Pill Palace,
The spirit named Bo Tao,
Who is the Great Lord,
Stabilizing life and supporting destiny,
Living for billions of years.

Vast is the Supreme Chamber,
Jade chamber and cloud court,
The three barriers and fetal qi,
Uniting with the Emperor’s numen,
Forming the Cavern Kunlun,
Lofty and unshaken,
Where immortals reside,
In golden halls and jade cities.

The nine qi separate and merge,
Clouds and rain in dark obscurity,
Square yet round,
Within three inches,
The flower canopy’s radiant glow,
Reaching the dawn and arraying stars,
Yellow gates and purple portals,
Utmost in mysterious essence,
Above piercing the Empyrean,
Below illuminating the Nine Numinous,
Left connecting the Azure Palace,
Right flanking the Vast Clarity,
Golden terrace and Eight Simplicities,
Transforming myriad forms,
Jade body overflowing,
Jasper liquid born of itself.

The Six Harmonies’ secluded gates,
The Eight Passes meeting the scripture,
Within dwells the Supreme Perfected,
Beyond naming,
Subtle and wondrous within the formless,
Named "Non-Flourishing,"
Reflecting the Seven Luminaries,
The origin of primordial elements,
On the left the Divine Lord’s Son,
On the right the White Prime Lord,
Also called Cavern Yang,
Directly within the Jade Chamber,
Who are their parents?
First born of the void.

Yellow essence and mysterious simplicity,
The Supreme Four Illuminations,
The Limitless High Perfected,
In the Crimson Court of the Dawn,
Flowered crown and purple canopy,
Adorned with flowing golden bells,
Dragon robes and tiger belts,
Reciting the Cavern Real Scripture.

Wandering the Nine Heavens,
Loftily bearing the Seven Numinous,
Riding the flowing carriages of the Cavern Void,
Reins of the Supreme Empyrean’s round chariot,
Exiting to feast within the Yellow Chamber,
Entering to ascend the Eastern Dawn’s terrace,
Playing beneath the Cinnabar Field,
Resting amidst the soaring azure mists,
Above communicating with the Supreme Subtlety,
Dwelling with the Emperor,
At times entering the Cavern Mystery,
All Perfected supporting the axle,
Together meeting in the Six Harmonies,
Guarding the Gate of Destiny,
Broidered cloaks and feathered robes,
Flying cinnabar and embroidered skirts,
Body bearing tiger scriptures,
Head wrapped in dawn crowns,
Dragon talismans subduing demons,
Golden writs summoning spirits,
Merging light and escaping form,
Controlling the po and refining the hun.

The Bright Hall square and upright,
At times wandering the Seven Gates,
Piercing the Yellow Tranquility,
Stirring the Numinous Pass,
Calling yin and summoning yang,
The origin of the mysterious void,
Commanding the Six Dings,
Before the Emperor,
The three qi flowing and spreading,
Heaven’s form complete,
Chaos as one radiance,
Transforming myriad ends,
Returning to the primordial yang,
Paying homage to the Cavern Canon,
The Three Subtleties wondrous,
The chamber as the Perfected Capital,
Visualizing the Three Simplicities,
Treading the numinous and soaring,
Resting in the southern Crimson Palace,
Grasping the northern Eternal Yang,
The mysterious balance of vast resonance,
Phoenixes singing and beasts leaping,
Deeply exhaling—how subtle!
Existing before the origin,
Only contemplating the Three Treasures:
Non-Flourishing and White Prime,
The Central Yellow Elder,
The Supreme Perfected.
If you behold them,
You will ascend at dawn as the white sun.

The Supreme Unity commands the tally,
Ten Absolute Flower Banners,
Twenty-Four Perfected,
Flying through the Eight Dawns,
Essence penetrating spirit and sight,
Numinous banners arrayed in profusion,
Yin qi forming rain,
Yang qi forming clouds,
The three qi merging and transforming,
The Celestial Stem revolving wheels,
Piercing the Six Harmonies,
Illuminating the Seven Gates,
Dispersing yang to summon tigers,
Drawing yin to summon dragons,
Flowing lightning and falling comets,
Moving with radiant thunder and wind,
Before girded with Fire Armor,
Behind sounding Heavenly Bells,
Purple and emerald ascending,
Tossing bells to the eight directions,
Flying nets and feathered patterns,
Wandering the immortal palaces,
White Prime grasping the po,
Non-Flourishing lifting the hun,
The Central Yellow Elder
Supporting my body and spirit,
I then ascend to heaven,
Becoming a true immortal.

Upon completing the recitation, inwardly visualize,
Constantly contemplating the Three Origins,
Where the Three Simplicities reside,
The root of attaining the Dao.
After ten thousand repetitions,
Undying divine immortal,
The Cavern Chamber complete,
Guard against reckless transmission.

Always recite the scripture three times,
Close the eyes and hold the breath,
Visualize the Bright Hall Palace,
Left the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber,
Right the Yellow Gate and Purple Portal.
Next visualize the Cavern Chamber Palace,
Above the golden chamber and purple canopy,
Left the Non-Flourishing Lord,
Right the White Prime Lord,
Both wearing purple flowered crowns,
Dragon skirts and phoenix cloaks,
The Central Yellow Elder Lord,
Like a newborn infant,
Clothed in yellow embroidered robes,
The three spirits seated together facing outward.

Invoke the names of the spirits thrice, saying:
Left, the Divine Lord Non-Flourishing, Master Youth;
Right, the Cavern Yang Lord of White Prime;
Center, the Yellow Elder Lord Bo Tao.

Next visualize the Three Palaces,
Each with the Three Simplicities’ qi in the Mud Pill,
Where the Three Spirits of the Northern Dipper’s Cover reside,
Their vestments as in the *Method of Guarding the One*.
Invoke their names thrice.

Next visualize the Great Lord of the Life Gate,
Directly at the navel’s center,
Wearing a purple support crown,
Crimson feathered cloak,
And flying cinnabar skirt.
Invoke thrice, saying:
*"Great Lord of the Life Gate, Child Dao Kang He Jing Yan."*
Swallow saliva fifty times.
After ten thousand repetitions, immortality is attained.

The *Talisman of the Cavern Spirit’s Expulsion of Demons*
is inscribed upon the altar of worship.

*The Hidden Court Rites of the Great Simplicity Perfected for Ascending as an Immortal*

Those who receive the supreme esoterica of the Great Cavern,
Practice the *Feminine One*,
And recite the *Great Elixir’s Hidden Mystery, Jade Dawn, Golden Flower Scripture*
Shall, each month, secretly pay homage to the Three Origins’ Lords of Great Simplicity.
On the tenth day of the first month,
Ninth day of the second month,
Eighth day of the third month,
Seventh day of the fourth month,
Sixth day of the fifth month,
Fifth day of the sixth month,
Fourth day of the seventh month,
Third day of the eighth month,
Second day of the ninth month,
Eleventh day of the tenth month,
Twelfth day of the eleventh month,
And thirteenth day of the twelfth month,
At night in a quiet chamber,
Burn incense and face north.
Visualize the Three Origins’ Lords in the heart,
Bow twice, then sit or lie as desired.
Kneel and pray with utmost sincerity, saying:

*"Reverently I invoke the Supreme Great Dao,
The Lofty Void, Jade Dawn, Great Simplicity,
Purple Palace’s Three Origins’ Emperor Lords—
Central Yellow Elder, Non-Flourishing, White Prime—
Jade Sovereign Great Emperor,
Five Elders of High Perfection,
Supreme Ultimate’s August Essence,
Mysterious August Jade Lord.
I, so-and-so, am a disciple of the Great Cavern’s Three Luminaries.
On this auspicious night,
When the Celestial Pass opens ninefold,
I humbly present myself before the Supreme Great Simplicity,
The Three Origins’ Three Simplicities’ Lords,
And the Jade Sovereign Perfected Lord,
Beseeching eternal life and deliverance from the world,
Boundless longevity of countless years,
To ascend in the morning’s radiant chariot,
Green canopy and dragon-drawn carriage,
To the Purple Court,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
Attended by the Four Luminaries’ Great Simplicity Emperor Lords."*

Conclude by bowing thrice in the heart,
Then look up and swallow nine times.
This practice must be maintained constantly,
And kept secret from others.

This is the Dao of the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One’s concealed audience with the Three Origins by day and nocturnal veneration of vows. Formerly, Chang An Jizhongzi, knowing no other path and practicing no great elixir arts, chanced upon this method of concealed audience with the Three Origins. After thirty years of steadfast practice, he ascended on clouds and rode the whirlwind to the Dark Continent. Immortals such as Wang Lübing, Zhao Shuangcheng, Fan Shuyou, Guan Ping’a, Li Mingxian, and Yan Ansheng all attained this Dao, ascending to the chambers of Kunlun, some dwelling in the Divine Continent, others in the Dark Palace.

The Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Simplicity are women. Their virtue conceals the Void; their spirits soar above the Supreme. They instruct and regulate the celestial perfected, governing and ordering the myriad qi. Their accumulated resonance is like jade chimes; their emptiness gives birth to the dawn of the skies. They weave mist and scatter radiance, their Dao towering over jade perfected.

When the Three Origins Lords set forth on their journey, the sun and moon incline their brilliance, ranks of torches uproot their roots, the eight winds pierce the waves, and the whirlwind seethes in the hidden source. Their radiance spans ninety thousand leagues; the high skies dance with the morning. Crimson clouds unfold in profusion; yellow clouds coil ninefold. Then the Five Elders clear the path, the Great Emperor supports the carriage, the Western August One bears the tally, and the Eastern Florescence raises the banner. The Nine Heavens bow in reverence; the Supreme Void stirs with mist. Hidden qi shrouds the depths; the Eight Effulgences join the dust. They gaze upon the Net of the Supreme and survey the hundred circuits below.

Great indeed is the August One—she is called the Lord of the Three Origins of Supreme Simplicity. At night, in a secluded chamber, one must constantly visualize the Three Origins Lords descending into one’s room. Bowing in the heart and speaking in the heart without ceasing, all aspirations will be fulfilled, and every affair will harmonize. This is the essential method for perfected ones to attain immortality.

The Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Simplicity wear robes of purple qi and floating cloud brocade, skirts of nine-colored dragon-feather brocade. They don crowns of treasured jade and morning-supporting plumes, their waists girded with fire-bells of flowing gold, tiger tallies, and dragon-script seals. Seated amidst the Great Void, beneath their knees ever swirl clouds of cinnabar, green, and azure—three hues of simplicity—dense and enveloping their true forms.

The Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Simplicity chant:
*"The Supreme Void links Jade Purity,
Three Luminaries pierce the heights.
Eight Effulgences turn the divine wind,
Scattering clouds and veiling flying spirits.
The wheel of perfection hurls through the empty cavern,
Golden radiance crowns the celestial essence.
Jade splendor binds the Five Elders,
Purple mist propels the dawn chariot.
Riding qi, they sway the Dark Chamber,
Yielding and following, transcending all paths.
Golden visage shines with ninefold clouds,
Jade form leaps in the cold court.
Youthful boys return to childlike gaze,
Aged elders revert to infancy.
The Imperial One solidifies the Mud Pill,
Nine Perfected guard Yellow Tranquility.
Gaze beyond ten thousand kalpas,
Equal to the Nine Heavens’ collapse."*

Bow in the heart, swallow saliva thrice, and conclude. When visualizing, recite this chant. This composition is said to be a hymn of the Jade Purity Upper Palace, harmonizing the qi of form and soul. When visualizing the Three Origins Lords, first arrange the hair into a three-cornered topknot of flowing clouds, letting the rest hang loose to the waist, with the topknot supporting the morning-supporting crown. If your visualization is sincere, you may behold them in the Purple Chamber or at your side. Soon after, the Jade Maidens of Supreme Simplicity and the Perfected Ones of the Three Chambers will descend to you.

To practice this Dao, one must always sleep alone in a separate chamber, avoiding the presence of others in all matters—not merely this one. The Perfected of Supreme Simplicity teach beginners the method to dispel nightmares:

If afflicted by frequent nightmares, know that they arise from three sources: first, the demon of the po; second, the trial of the heart; third, the corpse-thief. There is a method to suppress and dissolve them. Upon awakening from a nightmare, sit up immediately. With the second finger of the left hand, press the philtrum twenty-one times, and click the teeth twenty-one times, then softly intone:

*"O Perfected of the Great Cavern, ever refining the Three Hun,
Constantly guarding the Seven Po.
First Hun, swiftly guard the Seven Po;
Second Hun, swiftly guard the Mud Pill;
Third Hun, guard the heart’s regulation.
Hasten to invoke the Lords of the Three Origins of Supreme Simplicity:
I have just encountered an inauspicious dream—
The Seven Po and roaming corpse have conspired,
Source of ten thousand evils.
Urgent! Summon Peach-Kang to protect my life,
Report to the Imperial Lord,
The Five Elders and Nine Perfected,
All guarding the Yellow Gate of the body’s gates.
Divine Master and Purple Gate General,
Grasping axes and holding bells,
Dissolve the evil tide,
Transform misfortune into fortune,
Severing all ties with life and death."*

Conclude, then lie down again. The bells will yield a favorable response. The qi that generated the nightmare will be sealed beneath the Three Passes. After three years, dreams will arise only from resonance, and all will be as clearly seen as if foretelling the future. No more nightmares will occur, nor will inauspicious thoughts arise.

If one encounters a propitious dream—a fortunate omen—one should inwardly rejoice, for it is a sign of auspicious resonance. Upon waking, rub the eyes fourteen times: swiftly close the eyes, and with both palms, rub outward from the inner corners. Click the teeth fourteen times, then softly intone:

*"O Supreme High Essence,
Three and Five Elixir Spirits,
Crimson Palace bright and clear,
Auspicious resonance conveys its message.
Three Origins guard the po,
Celestial August One transmits the scripture.
All aspirations harmonize,
Flying immortals ascend to Jade Purity,
Ever meeting with Jade Perfected
In the Purple Court."*

Conclude. This is a secret formula of the Great Cavern, transmitted to those newly entering the stream. On the nights of the second day of the second month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the tenth day of the tenth month, one should visualize the secrets of the Cavern in the bedchamber, remaining alone and sleepless—this is auspicious. On such nights, the Jade Lads guarding the scriptures and the Jade Maidens attending the texts will report to the Three Origins and the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate’s Canonical Prohibitions, jointly observing your conduct in the chamber. On these nights, one must burn incense, focus the mind, and await their presence. Whether sitting or lying down, visualize and recite the Cavern scriptures, contemplate the Perfected, and visualize the Purple Chamber. Practice the feminine unity, acting with intent. On such nights, one must not engage in other affairs, for that is not the way of seeking the Dao.

If one practices purification on these days, it is all the more excellent—not merely keeping vigil through the night. From the very beginning of receiving the Cavern scriptures, one should always cultivate this.

**The Jade Dawn Luminous Mirror, Golden Flower Cavern Chamber, Feminine Unity, and Five Elders Treasured Scripture Method**

This scripture is also called *The Three Origins Jade Dawn Scripture* or *The Feminine Unity Hidden Mystery Scripture*, all of which are constantly visualized and cultivated by the lofty immortals of heaven. Thus, they move the Three Primes, accumulate and congeal the numinous origin, giving rise to the Three Perfected. Riding the clouds and driving the dawn, they merge with the radiant brilliance, inwardly forging the hidden root, transforming into women. Their bodies possess awe-inspiring spirit, ascending into the void, entering non-being. Between their brows resides the Five Elders’ treasured numen—hence they are called the Feminine Unity.

The Feminine Unity Cavern Chamber Three Primes Lofty Perfected Lord is the child of the Supreme Prime Three Origins Lord, whose spirit pervades the Nine Empyreans, penetrating the Dragon Mystery with unobstructed clarity. Scattering blossoms in the Jade Void, nurturing the numinous essence in the womb of spirit-fluid, their divine *qi* flows through luminous radiance, while pure effulgence flourishes between their sides. Three daughters were born together, named the Three Primes Perfected Lords.

The Three Primes Perfected Lords are the daughters of the Supreme Prime Three Origins Lord:
- The Purple Prime Left Perfected Lord,
- The Yellow Prime Central Perfected Lord,
- The White Prime Right Perfected Lord.

The White Prime Right Perfected Lord is the mother of the White Prime Cavern Yang Lord and the child of the Supreme Prime Three Origins Lord. The White Prime Perfected Lord’s name is *Qiming Xiaoren*, with the style *Jinmen Shang*. She arose from the accumulation of mysterious resonance, harmonizing *qi* in the hidden beginning, congealing the five treasures of the Dao, receiving conception in the emptiness of space, and taking form as a woman. Her appearance is ever like that of an infant, wearing above a dragon-patterned white brocade mantle and below a white brocade flying-flower skirt. Upon her head rests the Purple Flower Dawn Infant Crown, and at her waist hangs the divine gold Two Tigers Talisman. In her left hand she holds a flowing-gold fire bell, and in her right, *The Supreme Wisdom Scripture*. From the mouth of the White Prime Perfected Lord, white *qi* is constantly exhaled, coiling around the body of the one in visualization—this is called the Jade Dawn White Treasure, the *qi* of the living soul that suffuses me, enabling me to become an immortal and never die.

The Yellow Prime Central Perfected Lord is the mother of the Central Yellow Elder Lord and the child of the Supreme Prime Three Origins Lord. The Yellow Prime Perfected Lord’s name is *Yuanhua Huangren*, with the style *Taizhang Shang*. She arose from the accumulation of the great void’s embryo, the empty resonance of the hollow cavern, congealing and scattering blossoms, nurturing the mystery within, and taking birth as a woman, named the Yellow Prime Lofty Perfected Lord. Her luminous form possesses the substance of yellow gold, her appearance like that of an infant. Above, she wears a yellow brocade cloud mantle; below, a yellow gauze flying-flower skirt. Upon her head rests the Purple Flower Hibiscus Crown, and at her waist hangs the divine gold Two Tigers Talisman. In her left hand she holds a flowing-gold fire bell, and in her right, *The Great Cavern True Scripture*. From the mouth of the Yellow Prime Perfected Lord, yellow *qi* is constantly exhaled, coiling around the body of the one in visualization—this is called the Jade Dawn Yellow Treasure, the Great Numen. The *qi* of the five viscera suffuses me, enabling me to become a flying immortal and ascend to heaven.

The Purple Prime Left Perfected Lord is the mother of the Peerless Prime Lord and the child of the Supreme Prime Three Origins Lord. The Purple Prime Perfected Lord’s name is *Yiyu Yuanren*, with the style *Anlai Shang*. She arose from the effulgent dawn entwining the radiant clouds, the net of the great void congealing, the empty womb shining in the void, following the *qi* to nurture blossoms. Accumulating the essence of the uppermost purity, she thus formed a female body, her spirit-mirror reflecting the eight directions, her appearance youthful like an infant. Above, she wears a tiger-patterned purple brocade mantle; below, a purple dragon-patterned skirt. Upon her head rests the Purple Dawn Hibiscus Crown, and she bears the Purple Dawn Double Pearl Canopy. At her waist hang flowing-gold fire bells, and she also wears the divine gold and moon-bright Two Tigers Talismans. In her left hand she holds *The Supreme Scripture for Dispelling Demons*, and in her right, the *Golden Perfection Jade Radiance Chapter*. From the mouth of the Purple Prime Left Perfected Lord, purple *qi* is constantly exhaled, coiling around the body of the one in visualization—this is called the Jade Dawn Purple Treasure, the Life Embryo Flowing Rosy Clouds. It suffuses my body, enabling me to ascend at dawn in broad daylight and enter the Jade Purity Upper Palace.

The Golden Flower is the location of the Feminine Unity Cavern Chamber. Have the practitioner face south, then from between the brows proceed straight north, entering one *cun* deep to reach the Hall of Luminosity, two *cun* deep to reach the Cavern Chamber, three *cun* deep to reach the Cinnabar Field, four *cun* deep to reach the Flowing Pearl, and five *cun* deep to reach the Golden Flower Feminine Unity Cavern Chamber Palace—also called the Three Origins Five Elders Treasure Palace. When visualizing the Feminine Unity, blend the feminine and masculine, always situating them within this palace, making it one *cun* square. At the center of this square, there is a perfect circle like a ring, all resplendent with vermilion radiance.

Proceeding straight north five *cun* deep, one reaches the space behind the neck, arriving at the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber Palace, which is one *cun* square. The practitioner should regularly, on the eight solar terms, the new and full moons, their own life-destiny day, the great cyclical return days of the Five Penetrations, and the days of retiring to court the Supreme Prime, use the time of living *qi* to enter the chamber in purity and stillness. Closing the eyes in visualization, one suddenly sees within the Golden Flower Palace a golden hall and jade chamber, existing within the square *cun*. Though its breadth and narrowness are indistinct, it is not constrained by the square *cun*—all adapts to the mind’s intent, forming in an instant.

Within the chamber stands a purple jade couch, nine feet square and three feet high, upon which the Three Primes Lofty Perfected Lords sit together, facing outward. To the left is the Purple Prime Perfected Lord *Anlai Shang*, to the right the White Prime Perfected Lord *Jinmen Shang*, and in the center the Yellow Prime Perfected Lord *Taizhang Shang*. Behind the neck of the Purple Prime Perfected Lord is borne the Purple Dawn Double Pearl Canopy. Visualize their attire and colors as described above. Behind the necks of the Three Primes Lords, each emits a treasured solar *qi*, a nine-colored halo of radiance that illumines the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber.

After a long while, the Three Origins Lords exhale *qi* as described above, the three *qi* merging and coiling together. Suddenly, they transform into a sun-disc, nine *cun* in diameter, residing within the Golden Flower Cavern Chamber, its light brilliant and dazzling. In an instant, the misty *qi* of the sun shines into the Mud Pill Palace, glowing a pure crimson. Within the sun, the Three Primes Lords suddenly embrace one another, transforming their forms to the size of mustard seeds. Together, they enter and fill my mouth, and I perceive the dense, misty *qi*.

After a long while, once more close the eyes and swallow the saliva, inhaling the solar *qi* twenty-seven times. Then visualize the solar *qi* entering the bodies of the Three Primes Lords, penetrating my heart, descending to the navel, and illuminating the entire body inside and out—limbs, trunk, and the five viscera—until a cool, extraordinary sensation arises. This is the bathing of the soul-form, the refining of the Great Simplicity.

When this is wholly accomplished, it is called "The Three Primes’ Feminine Unity Refining the True Flower of Radiance," or "The Jade Dawn’s Three Primes Riding the Sun to Bathe the Form." Once the visualization of the Feminine Unity is complete, proceed in sequence, further visualizing the Lord Emperors and the Five Spirits.

Within the Purple Chamber of the Six Harmonies where they dwell, each exhales purple *qi* to bathe my five viscera, dense and resplendent as the sun at its rising, illuminating the abdomen within and penetrating every joint—alternatively, the hundred bone-joints. Then the five viscera each generate five-colored flowers, shaped like lotuses.

Suddenly, the Three Primes Lords appear seated together within the heart-flower. Suddenly, the Lord Emperor of the Great One appears seated within the liver-flower. Suddenly, the White Prime, the Peerless, and the Yellow Elder Lords appear seated together within the lung-flower. Suddenly, the Lords of Life-Destiny and Peach Vitality appear seated together within the spleen-flower. Suddenly, the Dark Father and Dark Mother appear seated together within the kidney-flower.

With eyes closed, contemplate this for a long while until complete, then knock the teeth thirty-four times and softly intone:

The Most High Jade Dawn, the Nine Subtle Guides of Smoke, the Five Elders Scatter Radiance, the Eight Numinous Life-Gates, the Three Primes’ Precious Qi, the Supreme Mystery Jade Dawn, the Golden Flower Feminine Chamber—within it lies the Purple Prime, blending and transforming the seven nines. Above, the Emperor Lord is drawn forth; the solar qi flows through form, bathing and nourishing the ten thousand spirits. Their countenances are those of infants and qi-children; upon their heads they bear the supporting crowns. Dragon robes and green canopies, brocade capes with tiger patterns—above, they summon the numinous talismans, calling and guiding the hun and po. They nourish me, they give me life, that they may abide with me forever. Turning back, their brilliance shines clearly, securing and fortifying the Mud-Pellet Palace. The peerless Three Qi enter the void and emerge as cinnabar, ever accompanying the Purple Prime, together arrayed as Jade Transcendents.

Again, intone:
The Yellow Qi undergoes nine transformations, the Central Prime Lord—lofty emptiness, unsullied and upright, hollow and peerless, without source. Yellow brocade cloud-robes, flying dragon patterned skirts, hands holding the Cavern Scripture, waist girded with Tiger Perfected. Presiding over the numinous Dao, pacing the Five Ford-Crossings, at ease in the Golden Chamber, refining and tempering the Heavenly Transcendent. Arrayed in the Five Flowers, jade radiance illumines the carriage. Then together they ascend the void, driving the white sun at dawn. Tempering the radiance of the Three-Fives, the seventy thousand spirits, the Three Mysteries and Six Palaces—may the Emperor Lord ever abide. Solar essence bathes the form, the Round Treasure entwines and coils, forever inscribed in the Jade Clarity, bound to the Emperor by affinity.

Again, intone:
The Vast Numinous emerges upright, the White Prime Lord—Most High Divine Essence, responsive to the Eight Gates. Dragon robes and tiger belts, Yellow Dawn flowered crowns. Governing the Emperor’s Register, overseeing the Jade Chapters. The great fusion of feminine and masculine, myriad transformations by the tens of thousands—beginning without end, longevity like the turning wheel. Each seated within the viscera-flowers, the Five Elders and Eight Interstices. Circulating through the Purple Chamber, driving the radiance in flight and revolution. Above, arriving at the Nine Clarities; in the center, gazing upon the Yang Barrier; next, roaming the Yellow Chamber; below, resting at the Gate of Destiny. The Great Tenuous shines with radiance, the Three Primes generate the void. May they journey with me, ever guarding without end.

When the Feminine One’s affair is complete, the spirit returns to the Golden Flower Cavern-Chamber.

During the performance of this visualization, one may lie or sit, or place the hands upon the knees—alternatively, rest the hands, or sit with knees drawn up. Follow what is comfortable, do as is convenient.

Generally, facing one’s natal direction is best. It is essential not to rush, but to engage in tranquil contemplation.

When you visualize the essence of the Feminine One in the Golden Flower Cavern-Chamber, you should always sleep and reside in a separate room, not mingling clothing or utensils. Avoid weeping and wailing, lest the qi of the Golden Chamber be lost. Also, avoid the sound of weeping and wailing, lest the Three Primes be disturbed and troubled. Further, avoid the impurity of coffins and corpses, lest the spirits be moved and fail to arise. Also, avoid visiting the homes of the dead or treading upon the foul qi of corpses. If one wears clothing not of the same kind or treads upon qi not of the same nature, the Three Officials will be moved and scattered, the Womb Spirit submerged and lost. The five pungent plants are the axes that fell the viscera; wine and lust are the blades that destroy the body. If you contemplate the Feminine One, you must be deeply cautious and must not transgress. Those who transgress will be darkly examined by the Supreme Mystery.

The bed on which you sleep should be elevated with thick bedding, not close to the ground, to avoid the fumigation of noxious qi and the Five Poisons. Always raise a foot of smoke to shield your hun and spirit. If the hun and spirit are stifled and disordered, visualization will not be responsive—this applies to the refined contemplation of the Feminine One. Therefore, in the Golden Flower Cavern-Chamber, the Three Primes’ Jade Couch is elevated to about three feet.

The *Washing of the Real Cavern Scripture: Method for Visualizing the Five Spirits of the Supreme One Emperor Lord*

The Scripture says: First visualize the Supreme One. The Supreme One is the essence of the womb and embryo, the master of transformation. The hun and po are born from the Womb Spirit; the life-qi emerges from the Embryo Palace. Transforming and uniting with the Emperor Lord, they blend and become human. Thus, the Supreme One spirit is the mother of life; the Emperor Lord, the father of life. The Supreme One is named Wu You Shou, styled Gui Hui Chang; also called Jie Ming, and Ji Lei. These are the true names and styles from the *Three Primes Cavern Mystery Inner Treasure Scripture*. The names in external manuals and miscellaneous notes are all false and unreal. These names and styles must not be revealed to others. Those who know them for themselves will attain long life without death, ward off the ten thousand calamities, and be able to summon divine transcendents and Jade Maidens to descend to them.

Every evening, visualize the Supreme One within the Sixfold Harmony Palace of your own body, or visualize the Supreme One to your left or right, seated or reclining, facing or turning away—present in all directions. Always visualize at the time of the generative qi. When complete, recite the incantation:

Essence of the Supreme One, arising from the Supreme Clarity. Hun and po receive transformation, form and shadow become numinous. Governing the hundred spirits, restraining the Three Yangs. Emperor Lord of the Mysterious Smoke, uniting with the Real, Hui Chang. Within, it secures the essence-qi; without, it repels disasters and misfortunes. Removing from the register of death, extending life forever. Clothing and age change without constancy. Governance lies in the Sixfold Harmony, circling the Crimson Palace. Below, reaching the Cavern Gate; above, arriving at the Mysterious Region. Blending the Three-Fives, roaming and resting in the Heavenly Capital. Calling and drawing the sun and moon, transforming the masculine and feminine. Summoning and commanding the talismanic registers, the sac of the womb and embryo, the mandate of life and death—the Supreme One supports and guides.

Visualize the Supreme One with a form identical to your own, clothing also the same. Therefore, your body should always be purified and cultivated to seek the meeting of radiance with the Supreme One. Among the items in your clothing, not one should be lent to those of different qi. Matters such as these must all be approached with caution.

If you cannot practice grain avoidance through diet and refine the Real through contemplation, you should at least abstain from all rank and foul meats, bloody foods, and pungent vegetables—completely prohibit them. If you can do so, you will gradually improve and may extend the span of your life.

The Left Peerless Duke is the master of consolidating essence and securing spirit, the spirit of the upper qi of the Three Primes. Consolidating essence arises from celestial essence; the essence born returns to the Three Qi. Thus, the Peerless Duke constantly commands the talismanic mandate of spirit and essence. Named Xuan Chong Shu, styled He Fu Zi; also called Yuan Su Jun and Shen Gong Zi. He always resides within the Jade Chamber of the Upper Clarity. Every evening, visualize him. When complete, recite the incantation:

The Most High Jade Perfection, linked with imperial essence,
The heroic qi of the Three Primes, the Great Mystery’s purple star,
Emerging bright from the Nine Heavens, five radiances kindling mist,
Within the golden chamber of the Yellow Gate dwells the great spirit,
Grasping firm the flowing bell, his head crowned with a floral coronet,
Purple canopy swirling in the whirlwind, dragon robes with tiger patterns,
His countenance like an infant’s, the Four Numinous in perfect balance,
Exiting cinnabar and entering emptiness, uniting form with the Lord of Emperors,
Summoning yin and calling forth yang, the celestial Dao holds truth—
Named Xuan Chong Shu, styled the Peerless Lord,
Pervading the Nine Paths, dispersing and transforming the Five Constants,
Gathering essence to give me life, abiding with me forever.

The Right White Prime Lord, also called the Lord of the Grotto Chamber,
Presides over the qi of the hun and po souls, inspects and governs the spirit-fluid’s numen.
Thus, the hun and po are born in the Palace of the Nine Numinous,
The spirit-fluid circulates through the truth of the Three Qi.
Therefore, the one who governs them is styled the White Prime Lord of the Grotto Yang,
Holder of the talismanic mandate for the hun and po souls.
The White Prime Lord is named Yu Ling Biao, styled Xuan Yi Jue,
Also called Zhu Jing and Qi Cheng.
He governs within the Jade Hall of the Upper Clarity.
Every evening, visualize him. When complete, recite the incantation:

Supreme spirit-essence, exalted in the Nine Palaces,
The Three Qi congeal and transform, aligned with the Gate of Spirit,
Dragon robes and tiger sashes, restoring life and returning the hun soul,
Waist girded with jade scriptures, crowned with the radiant dawn coronet,
Holding registers and talismans, breathing the undifferentiated,
Named Yu Ling, styled White Prime,
Accompanying me on our journey, ascending to the Yang Barrier,
Pervading the Nine Clarities, within the Six Harmonies,
Nurturing essence and fluid, the Upper Prime of the Mud-Pill Palace,
The hundred spirits escort and attend, each guarding its precious palace.
When the inspection is complete, return to rest in the Yellow Chamber.

The Central Controller of Destiny Lord, also called the Lifespan-Regulating Venerable,
Oversees the root of one’s birth-year, governs the records of longevity and early death.
The Great One transforms the hun soul, and the talismans are arrayed before the Controller of Destiny,
Merging and uniting to face the Lord of the Hun Emperor.
The spirit of the Controller of Destiny presides over the register of lifespan’s authority,
The appointed term of long or short.
Thus, merging with the Great One, the register is followed—
Hence, he is called the Venerable.
Named Li Ming Chu, styled Xuan Du Qing,
Also called Shen Zong and Ling Hua.
By day, he governs the Palace of the Dark Ultimate, traversing the chambers of yin,
Exiting and entering between the two gates of the spirit hut.
By night, he governs within the Dark Chamber, below the Earth Gate,
Above the Palace of the Six Harmonies, within a single boundary.
The Yin Chamber is the two nostrils.
The Controller of Destiny enters and exits through the nostrils,
Not between the eyebrows.
By night, he resides in the Dark Chamber, within the Jade Stem,
The Earth Gate also within the scrotum.
For women visualizing this, place him within the northern extreme of the yin gate.
Every evening, visualize him. When complete, recite the incantation:

The hun of the August One, transformed into nine names,
Merging with the Three Perfected, transfiguring the imperial court of radiance,
The Dark Ultimate and Dark Gate, within them the celestial numen,
Pervading the seven revolutions, the hundred spirits unite,
Holding tallies and grasping calculations, the essence of the Controller of Destiny,
Dragon robes and tiger skirts, crowned with the Seven Stars’ kerchief,
Constantly preserve my self, securely abide my form,
Styled the Venerable, named Li Ming,
Ascending to the talismanic mandate, granting me long life,
The Three Primes and Six Palaces, the myriad passes harmonized,
Governing and guiding the numinous qi, merging with my destiny,
The dragon wheel circling, together ascending the Great Clarity,
Equal in radiance to sun and moon, profound and obscure,
Inscribing lifespan in azure and green, heaven and earth unshaken.

The Peach Lord of the Gate of Destiny governs the mandate of received qi,
This is the lord of the primal qi.
Returning essence to spirit, transforming white to azure,
Aligning with the compass and square, life arises from the primordial darkness,
The resource of heaven and earth, the numinous origin of yin and yang,
The treasure of the Golden Gate and Jade Pass, the chamber’s portal—
All are governed by the qi of the Peach Lord.
Thus, when the Great One returns the radiance, the Lord of Emperors unites the hun soul.
Returning radiance means together merging with the cavernous to undergo myriad transformations;
Uniting the hun soul means transforming essence-fluid to give life.
The inception of essence’s transformation is initiated by the Peach Lord,
Distinguishing the signs of male and female.
The Peach Lord is named Hai Dao Kang, styled He Jing Yan,
Also called Ming Wang and Bao Gen.
By day, he governs within the Five Cities of the Golden Gate,
The Gate of Destiny within the navel, the palace of the Lower Cinnabar Field.
By night, he governs within the Six Harmonies, to the right of the Great One.
Every evening, visualize him. When complete, recite the incantation:

Mystic origin congeals essence, empty qi merges with mist,
The knot of the womb and placenta, the intimacy of yin and yang,
The Three Qi of the Most High descend into my body,
The hundred joints receive the numinous, the myriad spirits each arrayed,
Chaos merged into one, named the Peach Lord,
His form like a newborn, radiant and soaring to heaven,
Clothed in five colors, adorned with phoenix patterns,
Holding the spirit talisman, uniting the hun of the Emperor,
Girded with tiger-script sash, crimson kerchief and cinnabar coronet,
Golden bed and jade couch, aligned with the Gate of Destiny,
Mouth absorbing essence-qi, strengthening my bones and sinews,
To the right, a spirit maiden holding a vermilion banner,
To the left, a jade youth recording the Emperor’s words,
Yang qi moves left, merging and transforming before division,
Yin qi circles right, flowing through seven revolutions,
Descending to the lowest depths, ascending to the Mud-Pill,
Constantly roaming the Nine Palaces, exiting and entering the Dark Gate,
Refining and tempering the po and hun souls between the Six Palaces,
Recording and leading the myriad spirits, ascending as immortals with me.

The method of the Three and Five merging to transform and give life to the Five Spirits.
These Five Spirits receive the great numen of the Five Qi,
Corresponding to the origin of the mysterious mandate.
Above, they give life to emptiness; below, they bind the singular body.
The life within the body depends on the Five Spirits for its arising.
You should visualize and invoke them every evening.
If unable to recite from memory, you may practice by following the text during the day,
Not necessarily at midnight, but when the qi of life is active.
The three hun souls are born from the Five Spirits,
The Three Perfected emerge from the Five Numinous—
This is called the method of merging the Three and Five.
Those who practice it attain long life and do not die.

Grasping this Dao, daily observe the Hall of Light, traverse the Purple Palace of the Spirits, and give life to the Three and Five—this is the practice of ascending to the Upper Origin to attend the Celestial Womb. Even those who have already attained immortality should still practice it to achieve everlasting life.

When engaging in visualization, sit or recline as you wish. If sitting, it is best to face your natal direction. If unable to visualize all Five Spirits at once, you may first invoke two, then three, cycling through them in sequence, beginning with the Great One.

When concentrating in visualization, you must be in a place of purity and stillness—within a secluded chamber or amidst mountain forests—where no human voices reach you and no impure qi is present.

The Master says: Only after completing the method of visualizing the Five Spirits may you proceed to the practice of embracing the Great Cavern’s Feminine One, invoking and drawing in the sun and moon, and mastering the Dao of transforming the feminine and masculine.

**The Dao of the Great Cavern’s Feminine One Emperor Invoking and Drawing the Sun and Moon**

After invoking the Five Spirits, next visualize your entire body entering the Purple Chamber, seated facing south. Then visualize to your left the image of the sun, nine inches in diameter, and to your right the image of the moon, one foot in diameter. These sun and moon images reside in an empty chamber, positioned before your ears.

Next, visualize your left hand cradling the sun and your right hand cradling the moon. Turn your face toward the sun and inhale its red light fourteen times with your mouth. Then turn your face toward the moon and inhale its white light eighteen times.

Suddenly, the Emperor of the Great One descends from the void before you, accompanied by the Five Emperor Lords, each holding your talisman—one inch long and five fen wide—and casting it into the sun’s image. The talisman merges with the sun, rising in smoke like burning kindling. The Great One holds your register—one inch wide and five fen long—and casts it into the moon’s image. The register merges with the moon, rising in smoke like misty clouds. Visualize your name, surname, and native place inscribed upon the talisman and register.

Next, visualize the two images of the sun and moon suddenly merging into a single luminous pearl, the size of a chicken’s egg, golden within and radiant without, utterly transparent. Open your mouth, take the pearl, and swallow it. Feel it settle in your heart. After a long while, recite the incantation:

*"The Three Non-Existences rise in the high dawn,
The Two Effulgences are clear and bright.
Invoking and drawing the sun and moon,
Liberating from life and death.
The Celestial Womb unbinds and scatters,
Eight vapors and Three Courts.
Talismans and registers shine together,
Radiant and round with numinous light.
Swallowing the luminous pearl,
Ingesting the essence of the supreme spirit.
Pervading within and without,
All spirits attain eternal peace."*

This concludes the Dao of invoking and drawing the essence of the sun and moon, and the method of talismans and registers entering the effulgence.

**Next, practice the Dao of the Great Cavern’s Feminine One Transforming the Feminine and Masculine to Ascend as a Supreme Immortal.**

**The Dao of the Great Cavern’s Feminine One Emperor Transforming the Feminine and Masculine**

After completing the invocation of the sun and moon, next visualize yourself seated upright in the Golden Flower Chamber of the Feminine One, facing north upon a purple jade couch. Then visualize the Three Primordial Non-Existent Ladies—three maidens—standing before you in the empty void, facing you. Next, visualize the Three Non-Existent Ladies of the Grand Primordium—a single maiden—seated above your head, also facing north.

Then visualize the Five Spirits—the Great One, Non-Shadow, White Prime, Controller of Destiny, and Peach Radiance Lords—standing behind the Three Primordial Non-Existent Ladies. Next, visualize the Emperor Lord coming to sit before you, facing you. Then visualize the Mysterious Father and Mysterious Mother seated upon your knees, the Mysterious Father on the left and the Mysterious Mother on the right, their faces turned toward each other.

Next, visualize the Youthful Essence of the Lesser Canopy of the Grand Tenuity standing in the void before your eyes. Then visualize within the Emperor Lord’s Mud-Pill Palace the Darkly Profound Mysterious Lord of the Great One standing in the void before your mouth.

At this moment, there are five female spirits and nine male spirits, collectively called the Three, Five, Seven, and Nine—ascending to the Gate of the Mysterious at this time. Then, the five maidens and nine youths, all naked and unclothed, appear like newborn infants. From their mouths, they exhale white qi, intertwining and enveloping your entire body in a dense, misty embrace.

After a long while, the five maidens, nine youths, and your entire body merge together, transforming into a single sphere of white qi, round and radiant like the sun. In an instant, the round luminous white qi suddenly changes into two small children—one boy and one girl—appearing like newborn infants, delicate and tender.

The boy is named the Perfected of the Nine Origins, the girl the Soul of the August Supreme. The boy’s name is *Restraining Control*, his style *Three Yangs*; the girl’s name is *Supreme Return*, her style *Child of the Emperor*.

Next, visualize the boy *Restraining Control* and the girl *Supreme Return* each standing within the sun and moon—the boy in the sun, the girl in the moon. The sun and moon hang in the August Heaven, the sun in the east, the moon in the west.

At that moment, in a state of profound indistinction, you suddenly realize your body no longer exists—you have already transformed into the white qi from before.

Then, visualize hearing the boy *Restraining Control* within the sun chanting:

*"Restraining Control, Three Yangs,
Perfected of the Nine Origins—
This is my name.
The sun binds my body,
Master of talismans and registers,
Kin to Heaven.
Merging feminine and masculine,
Spirits and immortals entwined."*

Next, visualize hearing the girl *Supreme Return* within the moon chanting:

*"Supreme Return, August Perfected,
Soul of the August One—
This is my name.
The moon binds my essence,
Master of talismans and registers,
Now within the Great Brilliance.
Kin to the Mysterious Golden Chamber of Great Brilliance,
Life spans ten thousand myriad ages.
Merging feminine and masculine,
Naked in the Flowery Court.
Primordial qi transforms in dense clouds,
Male and female receive life.
Forever safeguarding the master,
Together ascending the immortal court."*

After the two children finish chanting, you gradually regain awareness of your own body and begin to visualize once more.

Thus concludes the method of transforming the feminine and masculine, merging male and female. Then, sit again with eyes closed, knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and recite the incantation:

The Perfected of the Nine Heavens,
The Perfected possess Three Courts—
One becomes the Three Fields.
Within the cloudy mist of the Golden Chamber,
Dwell the Five Spirits,
Binding and restraining mighty power,
Transforming the hidden and obscure.
Encircling the Mysterious Mirror,
Weaving through the warp of Heaven’s scriptures,
Three and Five return in reversal,
Merging with the Great Brilliance.
Yang qi flows and moistens,
Transforming into the Nameless.
With me, together as immortals,
Ascending to the Divine Court.
Sun and moon gaze upon each other,
The Three Lights merge in form,
Transcending the Eight Extremities.
A crown of Heavenly Essence adorns the head,
Turning left and glancing right,
Hands grasping the Seven Stars,
Concealing the body in the Grand Tenuity,
Primal qi of the Origin conjoined.

Finished, then open the eyes slightly and softly recite:
The Perfected possess Three Fields,
The saliva of the Two Children,
The Cloud Chamber and Golden Chamber,
Where feminine and masculine follow,
Within dwell the Five Spirits,
The path of merging traversed,
Binding and restraining mighty power,
The hall of the Perfected Immortals.
Transforming the hidden and obscure,
The body ascends to Jade Purity.
Encircling the Mysterious Mirror,
The Eight Interstices celebrate above.
Weaving through the warp of Heaven’s scriptures,
Twelve vows fulfilled,
Three and Five return in reversal,
The tube of Seven and Nine,
Merging with the Great Brilliance,
Reaching the Yellow Tranquility.
Yang qi flows and moistens,
The Lord Emperor submits and conceals,
Transforming into the Primal Name,
Great transformation refines the form.
With me, together as immortals,
The radiant essence comes to welcome,
Ascending to the Divine Court.
The Ten Directions stretch boundless,
Sun and moon gaze upon each other,
Shedding the body to preserve the child,
The Three Lights merge in form,
The spirit of the Supreme August,
Transcending the Eight Extremities.
The Three Primes’ embryonic breathing,
A crown of Heavenly Essence adorns the head,
Able to die, able to live,
Turning left and glancing right,
Both form and spirit transcend,
Hands grasping the Seven Stars,
Rinsing and drinking from the Divine Vessel,
Concealing the body in the Grand Tenuity,
The Two Radiant Ones shine together,
Primal qi of the Origin conjoined,
Myriad spirits revere virtue.

Finished, this is the Way of transforming the feminine and masculine, the great merging of the August One.

If unable to recite these words from memory, read them softly according to the text.

After reading, visualize the Five Spirits each seated in their palaces. The Five Spirits all open their mouths to exhale purple qi, entwining around my body, sensing the dense and flourishing purple qi, both inner and outer merging in darkness, hands and feet no longer visible—then cease.

Next, visualize the sun and moon emerging from between my left and right cheeks, the sun on the left and the moon on the right, their two lights illuminating brilliantly. Thus, the purple qi suddenly halts.

Then, visualize the sun entering my mouth, and consume it, tasting its sooty flavor, swallowing qi nine times before stopping.

Next, visualize the moon entering my navel, below the Gate of Life, illuminating the chamber of yin.

Then, visualize myself grasping the handle of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, wearing it as I walk, entering the Purple Chamber of the Grand Tenuity Palace to meet the Lord Emperor.

The Lord Emperor says: *"You have attained divine immortality, you have attained longevity. I bestow upon you the Jade Talisman of the Upper Clarity, inscribed in the Heaven of Great Abundance."*

I bow twice and say: *"I beseech concealment in the Grand Tenuity, merging radiance with the Supreme One, to stand in attendance beside the Lord Emperor, circling the numinous chamber."*

Visualize the Lord Emperor summoning the Supreme One to stand before him. I enter the mouth of the Supreme One, merging form into one radiance, becoming one body with the Supreme One.

After a long while, all is complete. This is called merging with the Great Brilliance, transforming into the Nameless and Obscure, sun and moon gazing upon each other, hands grasping the Seven Stars, sharing form with the Supreme One, concealing the body in the Divine Court.

**The Five Elders and the Feminine One: The Method of Unbinding the Embryonic Knots to Ascend as an Immortal**

This method is practiced on one’s natal day or during the Eight Seasonal Festivals. First, visualize the Purple Chamber and the Golden Flower’s Grotto Chamber.

After completing the practice, next visualize the Purple Prime Origin Sovereign, and orally invoke the names of the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Upper Radiance and the Eight Spirits, all assembling in the Purple Chamber.

Then visualize the Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign, and orally invoke the names of the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Middle Radiance and the Eight Spirits, all assembling in the Crimson Palace.

Then visualize the White Prime Origin Sovereign, and orally invoke the names of the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Lower Radiance and the Eight Spirits, all assembling in the Gate of Life and the Navel Palace.

Next, visualize the Lord Emperor entering the Palace of Ultimate Yin—the Palace of Ultimate Yin is the space between the two testicles in the scrotum.

Then, visualize the Lord Emperor holding three red silk cords, tying knots like bowstrings, each knot resembling a pellet. Each tying forms eight knots, totaling twenty-four knots, divided into segments of red silk.

Visualize the Lord Emperor bestowing one set of eight knots to the Purple Prime Origin Sovereign, another set to the Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign, and the last set to the White Prime Origin Sovereign. The Three Prime Origin Sovereigns each pass their knots to the Three and Eight Radiant Perfected, who each untie one knot. Visualize the twenty-four knots all scattering and unraveling.

After completing this, visualize the scattered knots transforming into a great fire, burning my entire body, both inside and out, like glowing charcoal, brightly illuminating everything. After a long while, all is complete.

The purpose of this fire is that within the human body, there are twenty-four major embryonic knots, and within the blood and phlegm, finer knots totaling one hundred and twenty, dispersed among the flesh, blood, and the Nine Passages. Thus, this fire is used to burn, disperse, and eradicate them, melting and untying them with blazing flames.

After visualizing the fire burning the body, next visualize the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars lying horizontally on the tongue in my mouth.

Then visualize the Supreme One standing with feet on the first star at the Dipper’s head. Next, visualize the Lord of Non-Flourishing standing on the second star, the White Prime Lord standing on the third star, the Lord of Destiny standing on the fourth star, and the Lord of Peach Health standing on the fifth star.

The Five Spirits, all naked and unclothed, appear like embryonic infants. The Five Spirits each exhale qi of five colors, fumigating the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, filling my mouth. The five-colored qi rises to fumigate the Celestial Quarters—the Celestial Quarters are the qi children of my two eyes.

Suddenly, the Purple Prime Origin Sovereign is seen sitting within the pupil of my left eye. Suddenly, the White Prime Origin Sovereign is seen sitting within the pupil of my right eye. Suddenly, the Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign is seen sitting between my eyebrows on the forehead above the nose.

The Three Prime Origin Sovereigns, all naked and unclothed, each inhale the five-colored qi to satiate themselves. The Purple Prime Origin Sovereign holds in his left hand the Five Talismans of my life; the White Prime Origin Sovereign holds in his right hand the Five Registers of my life; the Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign embraces my Three Hun. The Three Hun are three persons, shaped like me, each one foot and eight inches in length. The Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign sits upright between my eyebrows on the forehead above the nose, facing outward and chanting:

*"May the Three Origins long abide,
Within the Celestial Quarters’ embrace.
The Jade Clarity Emperor Lord
Determines the register, renews the beginning.
Life knows no end,
The Five Spirits’ support."*

Thus concluded. In an instant, all merges and transforms—all the spirits’ forms and my body together coalesce into a single sun, suspended in the eastern sky, one or two *zhang* above the earth, like the sun at its first rising. Radiant and resplendent, its brilliance illuminates the world below, luminous and dazzling. Then I perceive the voices of the Supreme Prime Three Origin Sovereigns within the sun, chanting:

*"Within the five qi’s blend we merge,
Together ride the sun’s chariot bright.
Gazing beyond the Nine Heavens’ veil,
Exhaling, inhaling the seven spirits’ essence.
Wandering within the Nine Mysteries’ bound,
Seated or rising, rosy clouds arise.
The Three Origins abide in the Celestial Quarters,
The pupils’ gaze shines clear and bright.
Gazing upon countless eons,
Surveying the courts of Bo and Shi.
The Five Talismans entrusted to the Emperor’s Son,
Returning above to the Radiant Infant’s embrace.
Awaiting the Jade Perfected Stair,
Hand in hand, ascending kalpas’ span."*

Thus concluded. After a long while, my body feels hazy and indistinct, unaware of how it is so, yet so it is; unaware of how I hear, yet I hear. Then I slightly open my eyes, click my teeth five times, and with the third finger of my left hand, press the *renzhong* point beneath my nose seven times. With the third finger of my right hand, I press between my eyebrows nine times. This is the method of "reversing the reins" of three, five, seven, and nine, sealing and controlling the gates of the hundred spirits, causing the hundred spirits to pacify my palace chambers, the Three Perfected to secure my unified body, the Five Spirits to guard my talismans and life, and the Emperor Lord to oversee my myriad passes. When this is completed, I again invoke:

*"Three and five oppose,
Heaven renews, earth begins.
I possess Five Spirits,
Above returning to the Emperor’s Son.
The Three Origins long abide
Within the Celestial Quarters’ embrace.
Five colors interflow,
Square and round, the Primal Axis.
Externally repelling the hundred ills,
Internally restraining Bo and Shi.
The Three Perfected assist me,
The Five Spirits protect me.
Treading upon the *Kui* and *Gang*,
May I not die."*

The invocation concluded, I visualize the Great One seated within the Six Harmonies Palace, thus uniting my form with his luminous presence. Then I release my fingers from the pressed points, cover my mouth with both hands, and softly invoke:

*"The Great One commands all spirits:
Hold fast to the gates of yin and yang.
Do not recklessly leave your palaces,
But receive control from the Emperor Lord,
First as the Emperor Lord’s law,
Second as the Nine Heavens’ decree."*

This is the great transformation of the Three Origins and Five Qi, untying the knots—feminine unity, naked form, merging with the Eight Effulgences. Those who know the Dao but do not understand the transformation of feminine and masculine, using feminine unity to untie the knots, will never attain life.

**The Great Cavern’s Method for Nurturing the Emperor Lord, Great One, Hundred Spirits, and Upper Immortals**

The Dao of nurturing the hundred spirits and untying the knots of feminine and masculine states: Within my body are twelve fetal knots of death and twelve stagnant blood knots of death, totaling twenty-four knots. The upper knots reside within the Muddy Pellet, the middle knots within the Five Viscera, and the lower knots within the Bladder. Knots lie within the nodes, and nodes lie within the knots; knots and nodes resemble one another, and are also called the Twenty-Four Knots. Those who do not know how to untie and release these knots will not escape death. Those who are constantly able to untie them attain long life and enduring vision. Those who are constantly able to nurture the hundred spirits will surely attain immortality, and their bodies will daily generate the radiance of the sun and moon.

I regularly, on my life-day, or the eight seasonal nodes, or the new and full moon days, at the time of *shengxi*, sit upright facing my life-direction. I clasp my hands, compose my heart, and visualize the Golden Flower’s Cavern Chamber—the Feminine Unity Palace—wherein sit the Three Prime High Sovereigns, the Emperor Lord, the Mysterious Father, the Mysterious Mother, four maidens, and two youths, totaling six persons, all seated upon a jade couch. I visualize the Purple Prime Origin Sovereign summoning Yuan Ying to stand before him, and Yuan Ying, the Noble Son, calling forth the Twenty-Four Perfected Upper Effulgence Eight Spirits to arrive and stand behind the Noble Son. I visualize the Yellow Prime Origin Sovereign summoning the Central Yellow Elder Lord to stand before him, and the Yellow Elder Lord calling forth the Twenty-Four Perfected Middle Effulgence Eight Spirits to stand behind the Yellow Elder Lord. I visualize the White Prime Origin Sovereign summoning the Right White Prime Lord to stand before him, and the White Prime Lord calling forth the Twenty-Four Perfected Lower Eight Effulgence Spirits to stand behind the White Prime Lord. I visualize the Emperor Lord summoning my body, and my body standing before the Emperor Lord. I visualize the Mysterious Father holding my Five Talismans and the Mysterious Mother holding my Five Registers. I visualize my left eye as the sun and my right eye as the moon; the two luminaries’ light merges within my divine court, then ascends into the Hall of Light, transforming and generating Yellow Essence. Yellow Essence, also called Yellow Water Moon Radiance, is pure yellow, like the color of yellow gold, shaped like a water bubble, and its taste is sweet as honey. Sensing the sweetness of Yellow Essence flowing into my mouth, I swallow nine times. Concluded, I swallow nine more times, raising my head to feed the Emperor Lord. At that time, the Great One stands beside the Emperor Lord; the Emperor Lord receives my nine swallows, then himself swallows nine times to feed the Great One. The Great One receives the feeding, then himself swallows nine times to feed the Mysterious Father. The Mysterious Father receives the feeding, then himself swallows nine times to feed the Mysterious Mother. The Mysterious Mother receives the feeding. At that time, I visualize the Lord of Destiny and the Lord of Peach Health standing opposite each other beside the Mysterious Mother, and the Mysterious Mother herself swallows nine times to feed the Lord of Destiny.

The Lord of Destiny receives the feeding, concluded. The Lord of Destiny himself swallows nine times to feed the Lord of Peach Health. The Lord of Peach Health receives the feeding, concluded. Thus, the feeding of those who received the Yellow Essence’s blossom is complete.

Then I sense that all who received the feeding of Moon Essence—those who partook—find their bodies transformed into golden hues, my own form likewise, all radiant and gleaming. Again, I visualize the Three Primordial Highest Lords, whose mouths each contain the Revolving Water Jade Essence, also called Round Luminous White Blossom or Sun Essence. Its form resembles surging water, its color like white jade, its taste like honey.

I visualize the Purple Primordial Lord, who swallows nine times to feed my mouth. Concluded, the Purple Primordial Lord herself swallows nine times to feed the Lord of Non-Essence, who receives the feeding. Then I visualize the Yellow Primordial Lord, who swallows nine times to feed my mouth. Concluded, the Yellow Primordial Lord herself swallows nine times to feed the Yellow Old Lord. Then I visualize the White Primordial Lord, who swallows nine times to feed my mouth. Concluded, the White Primordial Lord herself swallows nine times to feed the Right White Primordial Lord, who receives the feeding.

Thus, those who received the feeding of Revolving Water Jade Essence find their forms transformed into white jade hues, my own body likewise, luminous and resplendent. The feeding of all those visualized is complete. Again, I visualize the twenty-four gods’ knotted nodes.

Suddenly, I see within the Golden Blossom Chamber that the Three Primordial Highest Lords each exhale a flame from their mouths—three flames in total—to burn the three sections of knotted nodes in my body. I sense the blazing fire arising in the Chamber of the Feminine One, and the knotted nodes dispersing within the Palace of Golden Blossom. Thus, those who received nourishment are sated, and those whose deadly knots dissolved are now divine immortals.

After a long while, all is complete. Swiftly, I close my eyes and softly invoke:
*"At the Gate of Profoundest Mystery,
Within dwells Heaven’s Spirit,
Ever present in my self,
Securely preserving my form.
The hundred gods receive feeding,
All gather in the divine court.
Sun and Moon’s essence,
Reverses aging to infancy.
The Five Talismans, the Five Registers,
The Supreme records my name.
The knots of the Golden Chamber dissolve,
To live long with the Emperor."*

This is the Dao of feeding the hundred gods and untying the knots of the Feminine and Masculine. This method is transmitted once every four thousand years, and only after three hundred days of purification may one receive it.

*The Scripture of the Great Cavern’s Feminine One and the Supreme Ultimate Emperor’s Governance over the Five Viscera*

The Perfected One of the Supreme Ultimate and Golden Blossom inscribed this scripture in the Heaven of Great Tenuity, upon the eastern wall of the Purple Tenuity Palace’s Mysterious Jade Hall. Its text reads:

*"The five qi arise from different directions,
Essence-light unites with form.
Some end in death,
Some begin in life.
The ten thousand kinds return to their root,
The thousand threads revert to darkness.
The Dao’s qi pervades and floats,
Mists and clouds surge and flow.
Alas, my body—
Without the true, it cannot be perfected.
Why not gather the Black Cloud Herb’s dark waves,
And the Sweet Dew’s blossoming essence?
Combine them with the Five Lights and Seven Whites’ numinous greens,
And harmonize with the White Primordial’s Flying Dragon.
Bathe at dawn’s first light,
Align the heart toward the east.
Concentrate essence, steel the soul.
The Five Lords of the Emperor—
Bow twice, pay homage to the divine.
Secure the five directions,
To live as long as heaven and earth.
Enter and exit in free flow,
Each resting in its proper place,
To make the five viscera bloom with blossoms."*

This is the Great Script of the Eight Assemblies’ Intertwining Dragons, not something worldly scholars may comprehend. The Perfected One of Great Tenuity revealed and distinguished its characters, received and practiced it, seeking its explication from the Supreme Ultimate Emperor.

The *Black Cloud Herb’s dark waves* refers to the rich essence of black sesame, also called *Mystic Water’s Clarity*. The *Sweet Dew’s blossoming essence* is honey. The *Five Lights and Seven Whites’ numinous greens* are garlic chives. The *White Primordial’s Flying Dragon* is white quartz.

The method: Cultivate garlic chives, and for five years, do not uproot them—only tend and nurture them. After five years, harvest them for medicine, calling them the *Five Lights and Seven Whites’ Numinous Greens*. Select ten pounds of the finest, plump garlic chives, one *hu* and five *dou* of black sesame essence, five *dou* of honey as congealed as snow, thirty-six *hu* of pure water from the secluded springs of high mountains’ dark cliffs, and five pieces of white quartz, flawlessly white and without blemish.

First, polish them on a whetstone, shaping them into perfect spheres like small sparrow eggs—the smaller, the more lustrous. Refine them into pearl-like forms, ensuring no trace of the whetstone remains. Begin a purification fast of one hundred sixty days. On the ninth day of the ninth month, construct a foundation of rammed earth two feet high, build a stove-house, then construct the stove with its opening facing west—the house’s door likewise opens to the west.

Obtain a new, large iron cauldron and place it upon the stove. On the ninth day of the ninth month, at the *shen* and *you* hours, kneel before the stove’s opening, facing east. First, place one stone into the cauldron and invoke:
*"Stone of the Azure Emperor,
Three Primordial Lords,
Supreme One, Lord of Destiny,
Mysterious Mother who governs the soul,
Strengthen the bones, secure the liver,
Guard and nourish the liver’s spirit.
Let the liver bloom above,
That the liver may endure forever."*

Next, place the right stone into the cauldron and invoke:
*"Stone of the White Emperor,
Where the Supreme One rests,
Mysterious Father who governs essence,
Mysterious Mother who secures the lungs,
Guard and nourish the lung’s spirit,
That it may never decay or fail.
Let the lungs bloom above,
For a thousand myriad ages."*

Next, place one stone into the cauldron and invoke:
*"Stone of the Vermilion Emperor,
In harmony with the Emperor Lord’s voice,
Mysterious Mother who governs the blood,
Peach Health who secures the heart,
Guard and nourish the heart’s spirit,
That it may never turn to ash or sink.
Let the heart bloom above,
Blossoming in the Jade Forest."*

Next, place one stone into the cauldron and invoke:
*"Stone of the Yellow Emperor,
In unity with the Old Lord’s might,
Supreme Ultimate Emperor Lord,
Who governs the soul and secures the spleen,
Guard and nourish the spleen’s spirit,
That it may never collapse or crumble.
Let the spleen bloom above,
To soar at dawn’s white sun."*

Next, place one stone into the cauldron and invoke:

*"Stone of the Black Emperor,
In accord with the Supreme Ultimate’s reckoning,
Mysterious Father and Mysterious Mother,
Who govern the fluids and transform the primal chaos,
Guard and nourish the kidney’s spirit,
That it may never decay or fall into disorder.
Let the kidneys bloom above,
And the highest aspiration be attained."*

When placing the stones, hold the breath for five cycles of inhalation and exhalation before casting each one. Once all five stones are added, rise and bow twice toward the stove. Then take five *jin* of scallion whites, layer them carefully over the five stones, and pour honey to cover the scallions. Next, add one *hu* and five *dou* of refined fat to cover the honey, ensuring the fat fills the cauldron to the proper depth. Then gradually add water, leaving the cauldron partially filled, and float a wooden lid atop it. Begin the fire at dawn on the tenth day of the ninth month, using straight-grained, well-dried firewood—avoid rotten wood or impure bark. Maintain a gentle simmer, preventing violent boiling. Frequently check and adjust the flame. First, observe the fat’s level; if the water boils away, replenish it until forty-six *hu* of water are exhausted. Once the water is gone, continue simmering until the fat reduces by two *cun*, as gauged by a measuring stick. When complete, let the mixture cool in the cauldron, remove the embers, seal the lid tightly, and carefully retrieve the five stones.

At dawn, bow twice toward each of the five directions. Then kneel and consume the refined fat mixed with east-flowing water, swallowing it along with the stone fragments so they pass down the throat. When ingesting the stones, handle them as carefully as when first placing them in the cauldron—examining each one or two before consumption. Bow twice again and invoke:

*"The Great Yin refines the body’s form,
Surpassing even the Nine-Turned Elixir.
Radiant countenance, dignified and solemn,
The face shines with golden numinous light.
The Five Stones unite with celestial perfection,
The Supreme Unity guards the spirit’s gate.
Ascend to the Great Ultimate’s threshold,
Receive the script to become an immortal."*

This is the *Esoteric Record of the Nine Mysteries Dao Lord, Successor to the Great Cavern’s Golden Flower and Feminine Unity*, the *Precious Scripture of the Five Elders in Purple Writ*, the *Method of the Five-Stone Jade-Stem Elixir and Mysterious Fat*—all bound by covenant with blue-gold, sworn upon one’s parents, and tested against the seven ancestors in the nether realm, forming an eternal and unbreakable pact. To disseminate this scripture is to defy Heaven; to conceal it is to attain immortality. If one defies Heaven, how can they seek life? Upon death, they will become a lowly ghost, suffering for seven generations in hell—what face will they have to confront this? The method of the covenant is recorded in the *Thirty-Nine Jade Formulas of the Great Cavern Jade Scripture*.

**The Golden Elixir Method of the Western Florescence Jade Hall Immortal Mother**

First, purify oneself for thirty-nine days, then compound this elixir at noon on the seventh day of the seventh month. Take two *dou* of congealed white honey, three *jin* of true cinnabar—pure, luminous, and bearing white efflorescence—and three *jin* of finely ground mica. Mix these three ingredients thoroughly, place them in a bronze vessel, and cover it. Set the vessel afloat in a large cauldron of boiling water. Heat the cauldron with mulberry firewood until the honey and medicine dry within the bronze vessel. Remove the vessel, let it cool for three days, then dry it in the sun. Pound the mixture into powder, return it to the bronze vessel, and seal the lid tightly. Place the vessel in a steamer over the stove and heat it with mulberry firewood for thirty days—steaming continuously during daylight but not at night. Afterward, remove the elixir, dry it on a raised rack in the sun, then pound it thirty thousand times and sift it finely. Return the powder to the vessel, seal it as before, and float it in boiling water for three days and nights. When complete, it is called the *Immortal Elixir Golden Elixir*, also known as the *Queen Mother of the West’s Elixir for Halting Aging and Restoring Black Hair*.

Cool it for three days, dry it in the sun, pound it another thirty thousand times, and sift it finely. Mix with congealed white honey and form into pills the size of small beans. Take thirty pills at dawn each day. With continuous use, one attains longevity and immortality, the complexion remaining youthful like a maiden’s. If one studies the *Great Cavern True Scripture* and also consumes this elixir, they may wander the world endlessly. This elixir has no restrictions—eat and drink as you please. One may dwell among people, moving freely in the mundane world, unnoticed. This is the true immortal’s harmonious concealment, hidden and transformed across the eight directions.

**The Great Cavern’s Highest Jade Emperor’s Feminine Unity Jade Inscription and Precious Scripture of the Five Elders is now complete.**
