**First Lot** (Most Auspicious)
Dragon’s stratagems and leopard’s tactics brew wondrous schemes;
When meeting a bright era, present your plans.
The world’s ways are stormy, full of bold might—
Best to ponder rise and fall in stillness deep.

**Second Lot** (Supreme Auspiciousness)
Auspicious dreams first portend blessings bright;
Seek their meaning with care, weigh them aright.
If a son fails the mulberry-bow’s ambition grand,
A noble post may yet come with jade in hand.

**Third Lot** (Middle)
When the Green Emperor reigns in season’s due,
Red blooms and pale greens sigh on branches’ view.
If the Western Wind stirs in Shanglin’s night,
Does the traveler afar know wrong from right?

**Fourth Lot** (Lower)
Barbarian strife brings all to naught;
Their kindness and rites revert to what once was taught.
Zou Yang languishes in prison, his fate unknown—
Who will present the plea of Lady Ti Ying’s tone?

**Fifth Lot** (Greatly Auspicious)
Stroll the path ahead, rein your steed with ease;
Best to cross the river with boat and oars at peace.
Tonight the bright moon fills the wheel entire,
Ten thousand li of cloud-lanes stretch ‘neath heaven’s spire.

**Sixth Lot** (Greatly Auspicious)
A single current surges, eastward bound;
The world now gazes at the vast expanse profound.
West Mountain’s hounds bark idly ‘neath moon and breeze—
From here, the path to azure clouds finds ease.

**Seventh Lot** (Lower)
A frail, ailing frame defies all cure;
Hold back the finest remedies, their power unsure.
When Rabbit meets Ram, fortune shall arise—
Lest joy turn to grief before your eyes.

**Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)
Lose an ox, a horse—no cause for woe;
Why fret over trifles in life’s ebb and flow?
When spring begins or winter’s end draws near,
Let not the fair one seek her fortune by the roadside clear.

**Ninth Lot** (Lower)
Thin clouds and lingering mist yet veil the sky;
East, west, south, north—no path runs high.
Cast your lot where life first took its root,
As autumn’s leaf drifts past the crow and goose.

**Tenth Lot** (Middle)
News fills the hall—no need for more;
False words may come—dismiss their lore.
A man’s marriage shall end in joy untold,
Yet doubt unresolved may mar the tale foretold.

**Eleventh Lot** (Most Auspicious)
Red-sealed decrees arrive, their clay broken wide;
Ten thousand li of azure clouds swell with pride.
The osprey soars—good tidings fill the air—
Linger not ‘neath mountain groves or forests fair.

**Twelfth Lot** (Middle-Lower)
The frozen vale revives with spring’s return,
No need for idle blooms to blame the breeze’s turn.
Beyond the thaw, a message spreads its cheer—
Blue-green branches burst with life sincere.

**Thirteenth Lot** (Middle-Fair)
Perch fat, wine fine—autumn’s call draws near;
A thousand acres of waves—can the hook cast here?
The gulls betray the scheme, their flight in vain;
How bear the moon’s full glow upon the homebound main?

**Fourteenth Lot** (Upper)
I am strong, they weak—plant the banner low;
Speak not of injustice to those who go.
Though rain clears and clouds disperse, the storm may stay,
Yet spring’s first breeze will make all clear as day.

**Fifteenth Lot** (Lower)
Why measure thrice when once will do?
Wings stretch toward the southern sky’s bright hue.
Suddenly, a hindrance blocks the way—
Even if it succeeds, it may not stay.

**Sixteenth Lot** (Lower)
A soldier wanders far at heaven’s edge;
The Tiger watches from the northeast’s ledge.
Eyes strain, the soul dissolves—no word is sent;
A branch of pear blossoms weeps in rain’s lament.

**Seventeenth Lot** (Middle-Lower)
The Vermilion Bird rules the south’s domain,
No need to ask of descendants’ bane.
Where waves are calm, step forth with care;
Beware the sting of wasp and ginger’s snare.

**Eighteenth Lot** (Middle)
A noble guest at Dragon Gate brings joy anew,
Heaven’s thoroughfare awaits—climb high, pursue.
If asked to praise or clear the path ahead,
The hare’s meager skill sighs at firewood’s thread.

**Nineteenth Lot** (Middle)
Ten thousand shifts on branches never cease;
Vows ‘twixt sworn siblings breed enmity’s increase.
Best to swiftly mend past wrongs with haste,
Bow to Buddha, seek the gods—then fears erase.

**Twentieth Lot** (Auspicious)
Peach and plum in noble gardens fade,
Their dew-kissed toil no longer charms the glade.
A single note of wind and cloud strikes true—
Speak not of brocade robes and homecoming’s hue.

**Twenty-First Lot** (Middle)
Why crave wealth and gain with greed untold?
Sweet words may deceive—do not take their gold.
All merchants thrive on profit’s tide,
Joyful hues bloom in the southeast’s pride.

**Twenty-Second Lot** (Auspicious)
Carriages and riders come and go,
Idle blooms and cold buds urge them so.
Without the east wind’s gentlest touch,
They steal to the wall’s top ‘neath midnight’s hush.

**Twenty-Third Lot** (Lower)
Not that a heart’s hard to find,
Yet oxen laden with books leave none behind.
Fate’s threads will clarify in time’s embrace—
Who in woods and springs finds a kindred grace?

**Twenty-Fourth Lot** (Auspicious)
Lofty horns rise above the flock,
Yet incense’s scent still fails to shock.
When cassia seeds spread fragrance true,
A name by the sun’s side shall shine anew.

**Twenty-Fifth Lot** (Lower)
Above, it feeds on withered earth; below, the yellow springs;
Two cranes soar high, each to its own dreams.
Two rivers flow—no trace of man is seen;
The world’s perils outstrip mountain, stream.

**Twenty-Sixth Lot** (Middle)
Hearts in harmony, joy in accord,
Jade candles and willows bright—blessings poured.
Rejoice! No thief like Zhi haunts your door,
Three stars at dusk—what more could one implore?

**Twenty-Seventh Lot** (Lower)
Fate is harsh, the body frail—autumn’s toll;
Ghosts and gods conspire in shadows’ scroll.
‘Neath wind and moon, ‘midst flowers and wine,
Lest fleeting joy turn sorrow’s sign.

**Twenty-Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)
Limited vision fails to grasp creation’s art,
Heaven’s craft exceeds what mortals start.
A game of chess—this world’s affairs unfold;
Dragons and snakes on eastern walls take flight untold.

**Twenty-Ninth Lot** (Upper-Middle)
The beached fish, its tail crimson, yearns for the stream’s flow,
A thread of life barely holds—its end seems near, though.
Wait for the Yu Gate’s triple surge to rise,
Then pearls shall not be cast in darkness’ guise.

**Thirtieth Lot** (Upper)
Cold and heat, chill and flame—mankind grows weary,
Painting snakes, severing cranes—truth grows dreary.
Yet let no delay bar your gate’s way,
For spring’s breeze from the brush commands creation’s sway.

**Thirty-First Lot** (Upper)
Why question grief or right and wrong?
Observe the workings of mankind to glimpse Heaven’s plan.
From the depths of hardship, joy oft springs anew—
A lone lamp’s flicker rises to brighter flame again.

**Thirty-Second Lot** (Lower)
Jade and stone lie undistinguished on Kun Mountain’s height,
While earthen pots and basins clamor, grating to the ear.
When small departs and great arrives, the time is not yet right—
Cease your hundred schemes, your toil and wearying care.

**Thirty-Third Lot** (Lower)
Sweet and bitter—how oft have you tasted each in turn?
A life’s six decades pass beneath the wheeling stars.
Anxious heart like one drunk on the world’s illusions,
Why rush and strive, when all is but empty haste?

**Thirty-Fourth Lot** (Lower)
Heaven and earth, how oft do they meet and part?
Alone you stand, poised to prop up what’s frail.
Broken boughs, snapped legs—these fates may not be barred,
Yet the fire burns itself, heedless of its own bale.

**Thirty-Fifth Lot** (Middle)
Sudden winds stir waves where once the ground was still,
And human affairs grow tangled, loud, and rife.
Like salt and plum entrusted to a master’s skill,
The five flavors blend in one harmonious life.

**Thirty-Sixth Lot** (Upper-Middle)
Barred by distance, letters fail to reach their mark,
Spring returns to grass and tree, yet light remains dim.
The western mountain’s sun sinks, leaving lingering dark,
But beyond the heavens, a traveler comes home to him.

**Thirty-Seventh Lot** (Middle)
When water fills the boat, it shifts in but a breath,
A lone return unsettles, breeding doubt anew.
The traveler waits with purpose for the moon’s bright sheen—
Why ask the purple fungus when meeting is due?

**Thirty-Eighth Lot** (Middle-Lower)
A black cloud rises at the lifting of your gaze,
Seeking fame at heaven’s edge, yet fame eludes your grasp.
Knock upon the Yellow Bell to sound its fullest praise—
Then fair winds shall bear you to Penglai’s isles at last.

**Thirty-Ninth Lot** (Middle)
The river flows west—where is the boat you seek?
How long must you wait for merit’s work to cease?
Beside you, others whisper tidings to and fro—
Watch the arrow pierce the clouds this autumn’s lease.

**Fortieth Lot** (Lower)
Greed for wealth and gain knows no bound,
Yet the northwest wind rises—how to cross the stream?
The pearl’s true price demands a patient hand;
Life is but a dream that drifts to Nanke’s dream.

**Forty-First Lot** (Lower)
A branch of red and purple asks of fragrant bloom,
Petal by petal, idle flowers drift on the tide.
Do orioles and swallows harbor no intent?
Refrain from speaking of right and wrong outside.

**Forty-Second Lot** (Middle)
Chrysanthemums wither, autumn wanes, all things decay,
Chasing old regrets and joys that slipped away.
The black pearl emerges from the sea, its luster veiled,
Pointing eastward where the sun hangs like a cap at day’s fray.

**Forty-Third Lot** (Middle-Lower)
The azure bird soars into clouds, yet does not return,
Trust lingers in the misty, indistinct, and far.
The sun sets o’er the Qin tower, thirty thousand li away—
Beyond the white-clouded hills, green mountains are.

**Forty-Fourth Lot** (Middle)
Sorrow and joy, two hands that clasp and lift,
Ten thousand matters press—what can one do but strive?
Time is as fragile as an egg beneath a wing,
Yet watch: the final path may lead to open drive.

**Forty-Fifth Lot** (Middle)
Old gives way to new as yang’s light draws near,
The traveler at heaven’s edge gains wealth most rare.
Turn your head—Lord Yi is but a hand’s span clear,
Green toil is vain; cast doubt aside, beware.

**Forty-Sixth Lot** (Middle)
Fame and fortune’s chance meets three lifetimes’ thread,
A roc’s ten-thousand-mile journey lies flat in your palm.
Ox and horse tread separate paths, yet fall behind instead—
Like one in the depths of the Kan, proceed with calm.

**Forty-Seventh Lot** (Lower)
Thick clouds emerge from the hollow, yet find no rest,
How long detained before the green hills rise in view?
A mantis strikes the chariot, clashing in vain contest,
Stirring but empty fame in the world’s review.

**Forty-Eighth Lot** (Lower)
The world’s ways are childish, beyond all debate,
Yet when affairs reach their end, roots reappear.
Guard well the clothes within the bamboo chest of fate—
Do not share your soul’s counsel with ghosts or fear.

**Forty-Ninth Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)
The farmer’s fields know no year without harvest’s yield,
Though times may shift, we ask the ancient sky.
The Jade Candle shines bright, fish dream in the field—
Autumn brings profit, a thousandfold high.

**Fiftieth Lot** (Upper-Upper, Most Auspicious)
Stand briefly by the river’s edge to shun the storm,
Heaven’s will aligns with man—what more could you implore?
Wait till spring’s warm waves surge through ten thousand gates,
Then ride the raft straight to the River of Stars’ shore.

**Fifty-First Lot** (Lower)
Old affections fade, never like the new,
Fifty years and ten more pass in fleeting flight.
All matters are decided in the heart’s own view—
Building by the roadside is not worth the fight.

**Fifty-Second Lot** (Middle-Lower)
The lone lamp’s wick is trimmed, yet sleep will not descend,
Wiping tears, emotions linger close at hand.
A message from afar—ten thousand li between—
Yet dawn brings the magpie’s call, a sign so grand.

**Fifty-Third Lot** (Upper, Auspicious)
The times are harmonious, the year abundant, the world serene,
From this point, your homeland heralds peace and bliss.
The gods rejoice, the people cheer—a fortune is foreseen,
A hundred years of heart’s desires near completion’s kiss.
