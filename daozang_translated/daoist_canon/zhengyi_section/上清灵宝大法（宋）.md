**The Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual, Scroll 1**
*Transmitted by the Perfected of Mystic Subtlety, the Radiant and Salvific Master Xiao Quan-Zhen to Wang Qi-Zhen, Disciple of the Supreme Purity Three Caverns and Successor in the Numinous Treasure Lineage*

**Chapter on Establishing the Foundations and Clarifying the Principles**

**General Preface**

The Master said: The *Numinous Treasure Great Ritual* (Lingbao Da Fa) encompasses the Three Caverns, unifying the myriad methods. It is the teaching expounded by the Most High Great Luo Heaven’s Yuanshi Tianzun, transmitted by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord, the Five Venerable Sovereigns, the Lofty Perfected, the Marvelously Practiced Immortals, the Ten Directions’ Divine Kings, and the Supreme Perfected Deities. Later, the Mysterious Primordial Golden Portal’s Li, the True Celestial Emperor, descended into the world to propagate the teaching and deliver beings, whereupon it was heard among mortals.

This comprises the thirty-six divisions of the revered scriptures, totaling eighteen thousand chapters—the root and wellspring of all Daoist traditions, profound and recondite, unified with the myriad methods.

Moreover, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign possessed the *Eight Clarities*, *Five Translations*, *Seven Scriptures*, *Eight Latitudes*, *Ten Mysteries*, and *Forty-Seven Chapters*, which together form a single corpus. In their subtlety, they exhaustively elucidate all principles.

The *Eight Clarities* emulate Heaven’s opening of the eight faculties to illuminate the obscure. The *Five Translations* model the five kalpas of transformation, generating the Five Phases, whereby qi first configures the scriptures of the world. The *Seven Scriptures* draw forth the pathways of the Great Dao. The *Eight Latitudes* demarcate the boundaries of the teaching. The *Ten Mysteries* refer to the Ten Profound Principles. The *Forty-Seven Chapters* expound the origins, developments, and essential frameworks. Together, they form a single corpus, fully unfolding the profound and abstruse purport. In their meticulous detail, they establish categories and gates, pivoting as one.

**The Eight Clarities**

1. **Clarifying the Primordial Ancestral Qi and Its Initial Transformation into Jade Script**
   According to the *Numinous Treasure Jade Script Inner Sound Scripture*: Prior to the Three Qi, after the primordial chaos, within it the true essence congealed, subsequently generating the Primordial Qi. Within the Primordial Darkness, there was a spirit called Yuanshi Tianwang. Its qi coalesced, co-emerging with the Primordial Beginning, flowing and transforming to form efflorescence—neither form nor appearance, now expanding, now contracting. By the *Yan Kang* kalpa, one qi divided into two qi: the Void and the Natural, whence arose the Beginning Qi. The two qi intertwined, condensing into the Great Void, pervading the boundless. The script measured one *zhang* square, with eight corners, trailing radiance—its principle unfathomable. One qi congealed, enfolding the Jade Script. By the *Long Han* kalpa, Yuanshi Tianwang apportioned the two qi, and as chaos parted, light emerged: the qi ascended, clarified, and settled to form Heaven; the qi descended, accumulated, and stagnated to form Earth. From the division and union of the two qi, a harmonizing qi arose at the center, called the Mysterious Unity Qi, also known as the Great Brahma Qi. By the *Chi Ming* kalpa, Yuanshi unfolded the diagram, wherein a true yang qi transformed into the Fire of the Cavernous Yang. Yuanshi wielded the Cavernous Yang Fire to smelt and blend the Three Qi, harmonizing the Jade Script into Red Script. Thus, the kalpa was named *Chi Ming* (Red Clarity), and the script was called the *Red Book Jade Script*—such is the principle.

2. **Clarifying the Generation and Nurturance of Chaos, the Forging of Myriad Forms**
   Since chaos split open, the Three Qi formed script, refined by fire into Red Script. The luminous qi’s essence became the sun; the numinous qi’s essence became the moon. The residual light dispersed, dividing into the Three Clarities’ sages and the Three Images. The spirits of the Three Qi, from this point onward, gave rise to all forms—none but the Three Qi of the Mysterious Primordial Beginning.

3. **Clarifying the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual as the Naturally Arising Diagram and Book, Encompassing All Phenomena and Serving as the Pivot of the Three Powers**
   By the *Kai Huang* kalpa, the five kalpas had fully unfolded, the Five Phases fully manifested, and the various Perfected and Immortals were generated. Within the five kalpas, the true essence of the Mysterious Center was produced, and within the essence, the spirit—all named the *Shang Huang* (Supreme Sovereigns). Thus, the kalpa was named *Shang Huang*. During the five kalpas, the upright qi of the Five Phases flowed and spread, taking form: now gathering, now dispersing; now rolling, now unfurling; now embodying clouds, mist, fire, and haze; now resembling stars, constellations, gold, and jade. They formed creatures—worms, fish, dragons, birds—all emerging from the Red Book Jade Script, naturally dividing and generating the scriptures of the Three Caverns and Four Thorns, the Dragon Embryo Stone Scenery, the myriad talismans, and the three divisions’ thousand-fold diagrams. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign and the Supreme Perfected Jade Consort transcribed these texts, compiling them into registers to rectify the root of generation and transformation, to encompass the origin of all phenomena, to mold the mechanism of all beings, and to serve as the pivot for the production of immortals and Perfected—such is the principle.

4. **Clarifying the Great Ritual as the Ancestral Teaching of the Three Caverns, Giving Birth to All Sages**
   After the five kalpas unfolded, the upper realms became profoundly mysterious: the Jade Purity Cavern-Real, the Supreme Purity Cavern-Perfected, and the Great Purity Cavern-Spiritual. The scriptures of the Three Caverns and the four auxiliary talismans all arose from the Red Book Jade Script, receiving the qi of the Numinous Treasure to take form. Formerly, Yuanshi Tianzun commanded the thirty-nine emperors of the Supreme Sovereigns and the nine heavens’ celestial emperors to each record incantations, forming the *Great Cavern’s* thirty-nine chapters, elucidating the body of the five kalpas’ chaotic transformation and expounding the method of harmonizing the Three Qi into one. These were entrusted to the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Subsequently, across the various heavens, the thirty-six divisions of the revered scriptures were expounded. Later, during the era of the Three Sovereigns, the Golden Portal’s Later Sage, the Mysterious Primordial Lord Lao, descended to transform the world. During the time of Shennong, he descended as Yu Mozi, tasting the hundred herbs, distinguishing the five grains, and expounding the *Scripture of Longevity*. During the time of Fuxi, he descended as Tian Yezi, rectifying the eight directions, unfolding yin and yang, and expounding the *Numinous Treasure Primordial Yang Scripture*. During the time of Zhu Rong, he descended as Yu Huazi, resolving the Three Bonds and aligning the Seven Governances, and expounding the *Numinous Treasure Five Stars’ Chaotic Constant Scripture*. During the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended as Guang Chengzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Daoist Sincerity Scripture*. During the time of Shaohao, he descended as Sui Yingzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Primordial Treasury Scripture*.

During the time of Gaoxin, he was known as Yuanyangzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Subtle Words Scripture*. During the time of Emperor Yao, he was known as Wuchengzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Governance Scripture*. During the time of Emperor Shun, he was known as Yinshouzi and expounded the *Great Clarity Scripture* and the *Numinous Treasure Red Writ Scripture*. During the time of Yu of Xia, he was known as Zhenyuzi and expounded the *Five Chapters of True Writ Scripture* and the *Dragon’s Pride Scripture*. During the Zhou dynasty, he was known as Guoshuzi and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Red Essence Scripture*, the *Two Chapters of the Dao and Virtue*, and the *Numinous Treasure Eight Mights’ Subjugation of Demons Scripture*. During the reign of King Hao, he was known as the Left Elder Immortal of the Great Ultimate and expounded the *Numinous Treasure Sacrificial Scripture for Ghosts* and the *Karmic Retribution Scripture*. In the Han era, he was named Master Red Pine and once expounded the *Three Ones Scripture*. By the first year of Yongshou during the reign of Emperor Huan, the teachings of the Orthodox Unity, Great Clarity, and Cavern Spirit descended to the human realm. During the reign of Emperor Wu, he was named Ah Shanggong and expounded the *Chapters of the Dao and Virtue*. The Queen Mother of the West, bearing the mandate of the Primordial Beginning, expounded the *Numinous Treasure Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures*, completing the sacred texts of the world.

By the eleventh year of Yonghe in the Jin dynasty, the teachings of the Jade Clarity Cavern True descended to the human realm, and thus the Three Caverns were fully revealed. Through the great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure, all the sages were born and transformed.

**First Principle:** It clarifies the human body, modeling the Primordial Beginning’s creation of the chaotic state to generate the sacred embryo of the Dharma-body. When father and mother unite in essence, a single point of harmonious qi is contained; the two blacks divide and split, first giving rise to the kidneys. The three blacks separate and initiate, giving rise to the spirit-palace—the heart. The four qi merge, and the flower-canopy takes form. The five qi open their radiance, like a flower with five petals, and thus the five viscera are complete. This is like the image of three movements reaching the five kalpas. The two qi divide and judge: above, they give rise to the Mud Pill, and below, they give rise to the Mysterious Valley—the Water Palace. The three qi refine with fire: above, they give rise to the sun and moon, like the two eyes, illuminating the entire body, as if manifesting the ten thousand images. The principle of the human body is identical to this.

**Second Principle:** The external division of the body must recognize the ancestral qi of the Numinous Treasure. Entering sand, it becomes gold; entering stone, it becomes jade. Birds give rise to simurghs and phoenixes; beasts give rise to dark dragons. Plants and trees give rise to numinous mushrooms; the five grains contain auspicious omens. When qi scatters, it becomes harmonious winds; when qi ascends, it becomes auspicious clouds; when qi descends, it becomes sweet dew. Entering water, it gives rise to night-glowing pearls; dwelling in humans, it gives rise to sages and worthies. This is the ancestral qi, the essence of the Great Harmony and the Supreme One, the chief of all spirits. Since the Great Treasure possesses this substance, like the division of the human form, it enters the central cinnabar valley of the Great Floating Li Land. Completing the nine transformations and dividing into five changes, it forms the Dharma-body—this is the ten traversals of the Primordial Beginning, where withered bones are revived.

**Sixth Principle:** It clarifies the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning, which existed before formlessness. By comparison, it descends in substance to become qi, transforming and giving birth to the ten thousand treasures. What form does it take in the present world? Gathering this qi and consuming it leads to transcendence and ascent as a perfected one—this is precisely the qi of the Numinous Treasure. Even the ten thousand kinds possess it, such as dragon pearls, tiger treasures, ox bezoars, and crow cinnabar. The flowing essence, jade radiance, and elixir are also of this kind. The qi of the Numinous Treasure: in heaven and earth, it is like the sun at high noon; in the body, it is the initial union of spirit and qi. Thus, the Perfected One of the Supreme One said:
*"Always at the Great Ultimate, grasp the pivot of the mechanism,
In movement and stillness, the spirit-pearl descends behind the curtain.
From this, the Numinous Treasure is born in the Mysterious Valley,
When the millet-pearl is empty, one sings and chants in joy."*
This is it. Those who obtain and consume it will surely ascend to the rank of perfected ones, for even lesser immortals cannot attain this wisp of floss.

**Seventh Principle:** It clarifies the great Dao within the great Dharma of nurturing beings and turning back the numinous, which is the way of ascending at dawn. Next, reciting and chanting the methods of longevity, deliverance from the world, corpse-liberation, and attainment of the Dao, as well as the myriad methods contained in the scriptures. The *Numinous Treasure Scripture* expounds the purport of the Celestial Worthy of the Primordial Beginning speaking the scriptures in the heavens—this is the constant principle. Above, there is the way of refining the true within, causing flesh and bones to fly together; in the middle, there is the method of longevity, deliverance from the world, and corpse-liberation; below, there is the teaching of ascending to the ancestors and delivering the mysterious. In its greatness, it protects and stabilizes heaven and earth, rectifies the degrees of celestial lodgings, and has the power to heal disasters and repel demons. In its smallness, it has the efficacy to cure deep illnesses and revive the dead. In its brightness, it possesses the numinous power to whistle and summon wind and thunder, transforming naturally. In its subtlety, it has the texts to summon and employ ghosts and spirits, penetrating and perceiving the ten heavens. Thus, it is said to contain the myriad methods.

**Eighth Principle:** It clarifies that the great Dharma has three ranks, which must perfect the sagely and true immortal Dao. If one thoroughly fathoms the mysterious and investigates the subtle, practicing the ten superior ways of the upper rank, with merits and virtues complete, one will ascend in broad daylight. For those who engage in supplementary cultivation, obtaining one method saves one, achieving longevity and deliverance from the world, becoming the chief of immortals in the earthly grotto-heavens. If one reverently pays homage morning and evening, offering devotion and service, one will surely attain the immortal state of corpse-liberation, becoming a scattered immortal of the Ten Continents and Three Islands.

The Master said: *"The eight clarifications can open wisdom, and the five translations begin to complete the sacred texts."*

**First Translation:**
The translator says:

The jade script emerged before the void of non-being, concealed within the hollow emptiness, known as the Great Brahma Jade Script. When the Crimson Clarity unfolded its chart, fire refined it into writing, becoming the Crimson-Written Jade Script. The Primordial Beginning, through the divine might of Great Permeation, expanded the Five Scripts to give rise to the numinous, unfolding the esoteric to establish the great Daoist teachings.

**Second Translation**
The translator says:
After the fire refined it into writing, following the Crimson Script, each character spanned a zhang in size, with human and horned radiance trailing downward, covering the myriad heavens and casting its shade upon the Western Primordium. As the root of the Nine Heavens and the flowing force of clouds, its jade brilliance and golden essence shone resplendently across the great firmament. The Primordial Beginning commanded the Perfected Sovereigns of Heaven to transcribe its script in full, naming it the Eight Might Dragon Script, also called the Eight Assemblies of the Myriad Heavens. It is concealed within the Seven Jeweled Jade Terrace of the Supreme Clarity Mystic Capital’s Golden Gate, as well as the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace, the Orchid Chamber’s Golden Abode, the Eastern and Western Flowery Halls, and the Nine Heavens’ Grand Auroral Repository.

**Third Translation**
The translator says:
The Primordial Heavenly Honored One serves as the patriarch of Daoist methods, while the Jade Dawn Dao Lord acts as the master of the Numinous Treasure teachings.

The compilation of these five sacred scriptures of Numinous Treasure, the Jade Characters of the Thirty-Two Heavens forming the canon, is titled *The Luminous Chapters of Cloud Seal Script*. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted them to the Yellow Emperor, while the Dragon Might Master imparted the *Five Talismans of Numinous Treasure* to Great Yu. The Most High and Later Sages bestowed the *Venerable Scripture of Numinous Treasure* upon the hundred generations of emperors—all contained within the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, without further translation. When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao at Mount Emei, he beheld the Perfected Sovereigns in person and received their teachings anew. Later, Master Left of the Azure Heavens, through the True Master Xu of the Supreme Ultimate, disseminated and propagated them, likewise without retranslating or reinterpreting.

**Fourth Translation**
The translator says:
In the first year of the *Yuanfeng* reign of the Han, on the seventh day of the seventh month, the Queen Mother of the West descended and conferred these scriptures and methods upon Emperor Wu of Han. The Emperor did not comprehend the language of the Great Brahmā. The Queen Mother replied: "The Primordial Beginning is a being of the Great Canopy Heaven, while the Dao Lord is a being of the Western Jade Realm of Śinā—even their speech differs from that of the Divine Continent, let alone the language of the Great Brahmā." Thereupon, she transcribed them in writing, transforming the celestial jade characters into contemporary script. Within the rituals of the Great Brahmā’s language—its vestments and regalia, palace names, diagrams, seals, cyclical signs, hexagrams, qi phases, altar designs, and great methods—along with the practices of the various ranks and the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures, all were adapted to the written language of the Han era, becoming the authoritative speech of past and present.

**Fifth Translation**
The translator says:
After the Perfected Sovereigns of Heaven transcribed the script in full, it was established as the correct pronunciation. The Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct compiled the great methods of talismanic script for cultivation and application. The Perfected Ones of True Radiance, Yu Luoqiao, and Resplendent Luminous Sound gathered the talismans and diagrams of the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures to form the *Precious Register of the Central Alliance*. The texts of the Thirty-Six Divisions of True Scriptures became the *Great Method of Numinous Treasure*, thus spreading through the ages. Master Left of the Azure Heavens transmitted the scriptures, registers, and esoteric methods to the True Master Xu of the Supreme Ultimate. The Master bequeathed them to the Perfected One Yang of Supreme Clarity, who synthesized the methods of the two ranks—*Supreme Clarity Cavern Mystery* and *Jade Clarity Cavern Truth*—whereupon divine scriptures gradually emerged in later generations.

Here ends the first scroll of the *Great Method of Supreme Clarity and Numinous Treasure*.
Preface to the *Great Method of Supreme Clarity and Numinous Treasure*.

**Ancient Preface**

In ancient times, our Primordial Master, the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning, moved by great compassion, broadly delivered all beings, saving them across kalpas. He established the teaching prior to Heaven, responding to circumstances without constraint, his transformative influence flowing through form beyond the Three Realms and Nine Springs, unbound by the human world or what lies beyond appearances.

In the pristine age of Dragon Han, he taught the Great Vehicle. By the time of Yan Kang, when the primordial unity had dispersed, he bestowed the Middle Method. The Great Vehicle is non-action, non-affair, letting things follow their natural course. The Middle Method involves rest and effort, guiding beings according to their capacities.

After the Kaihuang era, when the Red Clarity returned, customs grew shallow and turbid. People deceived their true simplicity, abandoned their roots, drowned in deluded nature, and lost their original emotions. They turned away from the mysterious workings of wondrous being and forsook the profound principles of spontaneity. Thus, beneath the Fangzhu Terrace, empty names filled the green bamboo slips. Within the Dengdu Terrace, the titles of black texts multiplied. Those who sank into perdition crowded the roads at dawn, while those who ascended to transcendence stood shoulder to shoulder across millennia. The great brush of sagely compassion swiftly opened the path to deliverance.

Thus, the Three Primes establish the standards of sincerity, and the Four Poles illuminate the statutes. The scriptures of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, the registers hidden in earth and stored in heaven, the precepts of the *Nüqing* and *Xuandu*, the texts of the Eight Jades and Nine Tripods, the writings of the Golden Perfected and Eight Poles, the talismans of phoenix qi and dragon scripts, the methods of yielding gold, flowing water, and jade, the talismans of *Kaiming* and *Zhenling*, the texts of the Five Elders’ strategems, the registers of ascending to perfection through the Eight Seas, the writs of the Great Kalpa and Vast Perfection, the chapters of the *Lingbao* for summoning dragons, the sections of the *Zhengyi* for saving the world, the seals of the *Dongshen* for opening mountains, the formulas of the *Shangqing* Eight Effulgences, the verses of the *Xuanzhen* and *Qusu*, the diagrams of the *Taiping* Left and Right, the ranks of the *Dongxuan* wisdom, the arts of riding the void and treading emptiness, the manifestations of grasping the Dipper and seizing the *Kui*—

Some restrain the body and mind, some dissolve transgressions and impurities, some swallow awns and ingest effulgences, some refine qi and nurture the primordial embryo, some seal mountains and summon clouds, some sit in forgetfulness and cast off illumination. They open myriad paths to draw in and guide, extending manifold methods to uplift and support, desiring that all beings clinging to consciousness and harboring life may ascend to the shore of the Dao. How could this be limited to those who wear stars as hairpins and gird themselves with the moon, alone ascending to the courts of immortality?

Hence, the three-chapter and five-section rituals emerged, along with the *Hetu* altar methods, the formulas for bowing in submission and presenting memorials, and the offices of the wind-borne courier steeds. For all who dwell in the world and have matters to memorialize, the lords of the sun and moon, the true officials of the local domains, ride those courier dragons and make their petitions heard at the heavenly gates. Though the heavenly palaces are distant and the earthly realms humble, response follows upon perception, swift as a flicker of light. Thus, the great Dao saves all beings, leaving nothing—great or small—unattended. For seeking blessings and praying for perfection, the fasting methods are paramount.

There are twenty-seven grades of fasting, all detailed in the Three Caverns scriptures, each cavern comprising nine ranks of fasts. Among them, the Inner Yellow Register Fast is renowned for its far-reaching blessings, broadly rescuing those in the Three Paths. The time of karmic retribution arrives as swiftly as an echo follows a sound, and its efficacy has been verified throughout the ages by countless individuals. Yet, utmost sincerity is foremost, the radiance of dragons supreme, and the purity of incense smoke secondary. Should any aspect be lacking, it becomes a blemish upon the fast. Those who cultivate and uphold these practices—how could they not be cautious?

Moreover, the methods of the Yellow Register deliver and save in abundance. When ruler and subject practice together, the blessings extend to all—humans and heavens alike. According to their undertakings, the principles and approaches are manifold. The scriptures further state: The teachings of the Three Caverns spread and fill the human realm. Practicing the Dao and observing fasts, teachings are established in accordance with what is fitting. Between the human world and the heavens above, these have long been in circulation. Should emperors, kings, lords, common folk, or any beings upon the land encounter disasters and calamities that must be dispelled, they may summon Daoist masters and female officials, whether many or few, to erect jade altars, hang silken canopies, scatter flowers, burn incense, light lamps to illumine the night, perform the ritual circumambulations, and offer repentance. Through the six periods of day and night, they labor without ceasing, and spiritual responses are swiftly obtained, with blessings and virtues universally bestowed.

The scriptures say: The Yellow Register is foremost in delivering the countless generations of ancestors, the departed of past and present, those trapped in the Three Paths, sunk in the hells for ten thousand kalpas, enabling them to transcend suffering, ascend to heaven, and rescue the hidden souls. This scripture may be practiced in accordance with the world’s needs, whether for three days, seven days, one period, or nine periods. Memorials are presented, and sincerity is swiftly conveyed to heaven—none fail to reach their destination.

Furthermore, the *Lingbao* is the root and origin of the great Dao, the wondrous transformation of the Primordial Beginning. It emerges from the void, naturally evolving through kalpas, subtly aligning with yin and yang, dividing and shaping creation. It safeguards the imperial mandate, protects the people of heaven, holds the reins of the celestial pivot, and expands the profound mystery. It encompasses the great demonic methods of the Five Emperors, summons the offices of the myriad heavens and primal unities, delivers the living and the dead, and governs the Three Realms. Its talismans are inscribed according to the celestial qi, its hidden chapters unfold profound meanings. It is concealed within the Palace of the Elixir Pearl, forbidden in the divine precincts of the Flowery Hall. Revered by all heavens, it is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. Those who follow its luminous statutes conduct themselves with proper measure. Without the great fortune of past lives, how could one casually encounter it? To meet and cultivate it is a rare convergence. Through it, one may summon numinous darkness at the Three Passes, gather precious blossoms at the Nine Gates. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one is ranked among the immortal elders, reviving the dead and restoring the body, returning to truth and regaining the root. Revered by humans and heavens, its transformations are boundless. It summons the perfected and calls forth the numinous, pervading the Three Ways—truly the most exalted of the myriad methods for delivering beings, the majestic and vast Brahman.

Thus, this preface is respectfully composed. Mysterious Preface.

At the Primordial Beginning of kalpas, it is the root and origin of Heaven and Earth. The Numinous Treasure unfolds its chart, mastering the pivot of yin and yang. It expounds the principle of the sun and moon’s transformations, governs the mechanism of stars’ measured courses, subtly gathers the wandering net, and uplifts the zi and wu. It restores the creative workings of the Five Phases, pursues the three qi’s primordial radiance, advances and retreats with Qian and Kun, soars and revolves with Li and Kan. It seizes the dragon and tames the tiger, reins the phoenix and rides the simurgh, feasting at dawn on the blossoms of the Purple Court, supping at dusk on the nectar of Azure Flower. Refining the form with flowing fire, irrigating the substance with the Jade Pond’s waters, six dragons dance in the layered skies, nine qi seethe and boil in the jade crucible. The Dao gives me life—things have no fixed nature.

Abandoning things and releasing form, qi and spirit merge and truth becomes luminous. Releasing passions and nurturing vastness, essence and blood flow and qi naturally congeals. The true fire soars high, flying to support the bright sun of Mount Fuqiu. Water and metal are restrained, flourishing the toad of the Jade Palace. Eight simurghs cry in unison, praising the elegant melody of the empty song. Nine phoenixes sing together, raising the profound sound of the Ten Absolutes. Looking up and down at the numinous mound, the perfected of the ten directions gather of themselves. Attending audience before the Most High, the feathered and winged hosts of the myriad spirits soar in their chariots. A grain of millet hangs high, its transformations unfathomable. Embracing the obscure and dim, the countless multitudes all return. When the turbid and contentious rush forward, the thousand spirits and myriad qi scatter entirely.

Gathering qi makes treasure; assembling spirit makes numen. Qian is firm and purely yang; Kun is yielding and of yin substance. The qi of spontaneity is formless and nameless. Above, it reaches the Nine Pures, where it borrows the name of “mysterious darkness.” Below, it penetrates the Nine Earths, where it takes names distinguished by form. Thus we know: dim and distant, indistinct and vague, still and unmoving, yet responsive when stimulated and thus communicating. The two qi revolve, moving with Heaven and Earth in timely response. The Three Fields connect with the wondrous, moved by yin and yang’s revolutions. No need for other applications—why seek ease for oneself?

Abiding in spirit and knocking the teeth awaken the initial truth of entering the Dao’s gate. Refining qi and inscribing talismans clarify the scholar’s rule of observance. To swallow the Nine Revolutions’ elixir, one must create in accord with the four seasons. Circulating the Zhou Tian, uniting water and fire, smelting metal and casting the crucible, refining stone to mend the mysterious—stealing the sun and moon’s essence, binding the spirit-perfected’s lead and mercury. First clarify the zi and wu, then distinguish water and metal. Advancing and retreating, drawing and adding, know the time and adapt to the season. Warmth, nurturing, and refinement must be without error. Do not kill the good for desire and greed, do not envy and steal with lust. Distance hatred and leave resentment; transform bone to kinship. Deliver gods and humans, expound teachings to the mortal world. Penetrate the mysterious and investigate the subtle, all chapters reveal profound wisdom. Bind demons and repel afflictions, severing the source of the six roots’ obstructions. Abandon the false and follow the true, extinguishing the gateway of the five sufferings’ transmigration.

Binding the hun-soul and restraining the po-soul,
nurturing the dark to conceal the spirit,
the body radiates light,
the form leaves no trace.

Unsealing the Three Luminaries,
separation and union arise naturally.
Lofty and serene, the Yu Luo soars,
through ten thousand kalpas the Xiao Tai crowns the peaks.
Ascending the Golden Portals,
roaming the jade mountains’ transcendent realms.
Riding the jasper wheels,
the Ten Qi manifest in spontaneous flight.
Guiding the green ranks,
the Five Elders of the heavens bow in reverence.

Swiftly erasing the causes of karmic ledgers,
severing the roots of evil paths.
Wondrous indeed this Dharma—
thus it ranks among the scriptures,
awakening the lost and benighted,
rescuing those yet unenlightened.

Long ago, I encountered the Pure Subtlety Venerable,
who taught me the art of exhaling and inhaling the Two Qi.
Next, I met the Jade Emperor of the Mysterious August,
who bestowed upon me the oral instructions of the Golden Elixir.
I grasped the celestial numbers of Heaven and Earth’s inception,
comprehended the mechanisms of yin and yang’s generation and destruction.
The hundred flowers and myriad herbs
all guard their roots and secure their stems.
Rare birds and strange beasts
all embrace the One and contain the Primordial.

Thus I know that inverting the Five Phases
and overturning the Four Images,
stealing the qi of the Primordial One’s flight into mystery,
preserving the essence of the true and wondrous body,
erecting the precious tripod on Kongtong,
flying golden essence within the numinous cavern,
conjoining the inner and outer water and fire,
uniting the upper and lower measures,
the primordial qi circulates in full,
stirring the Primordial Yellow to make the Mysterious Pearl radiant.
Encompassing the cosmos,
containing the Golden Elixir to provide inexhaustible resources.

Know then that Heaven and Earth alone are supreme,
their transformations formless and without substance.
The wondrous Dao of Qian and Kun,
the beginningless and endless cycle of life and death.
The Dao is not to be sought afar—
it lies not beyond door and window.
Few draw near to it,
many keep their distance.
Abandoning the root to chase illusory truth,
they willingly forget the springs and soil in delight.
Mistaking the perverse for the upright,
they vainly endure summer and winter in passage.

Stillness generates strength,
tranquility prompts profound reflection.
The Seven Emotions fan the flames,
severing the intestines and transforming yin—life and destiny hang in peril.
The Six Desires entice and ensnare,
scattering essence and dissolving form—spirit and qi vanish.
The Five Viscera tremble,
the Nine Orifices open and close—
none discern the origin of life and destiny.
Odd and even pair,
yet how can one fathom creation’s workings?
How could one discern the mysterious mechanism?

I invoke great compassion,
wishing to uplift the immortal disciples.
Gathering this spirit and qi,
I compile it under the title *Mysterious Chapters*.
Thus it is named the *Lingbao’s Guide and Snare*,
corresponding to the inner Dharma of the true scriptures.
Entrusted to the wondrous practice,
it emerges to deliver beings across the world,
manifesting in the ten directions under myriad names.
Compiled into scriptures,
filling the Ganges’ sands—
each phrase is profound,
every passage is the Dao.

Grasping this wondrous principle,
one is born and dies yet abides with the Dao.
Comprehending this true mechanism,
separation and union occur naturally—
coming and going leave no attainment.
Those who encounter it possess immortal bones from past lives,
those who practice it accumulate blessings through generations.
Those who err and fall among humans and heavens,
fearing they may stray from the path of awakening,
are guided to clarity and perfection,
attaining realization of the Dharma gate,
practicing the secret treasury of the Dao.

Thus the preface concludes in earnest.

*Shangqing Lingbao Great Dharma, Scroll the Second*
*Dongwei Gaoshi Kaiguang Jiu Ku Zhenren Xiao Quanzhen*
*Transmitted to the Shangqing Three Caverns Disciple, Lingbao Preceptor Wang Qizhen*
*Compiled and Applied: The Seven Scriptures*

The Master said: The methods of practice and application comprise the Seven Scriptures.

First: Penetrating vision of the hundred spirits. One ingests the *Hunyuan Jade Tablet* and recites the *High Mystery Inner Taboo Names*, practicing the *Yuanshi Inner Contemplation* of the Dao. If unable to perform this, one should practice the *Inner Vision of the Hidden Treasury* instead.

Second: Consulting the Dipper, severing the registers of death, and inscribing life in the Southern Bureau—what is called "the Northern Dipper casts down death, the Southern Dipper raises up life."

Third: Audience at the Origin.

Fourth: Dividing the spirit to govern affairs.

Fifth: Establishing a celestial abode in the Immortal Bureaus.

Sixth: Liberating the mysterious ancestors and entrusting governance to the Southern Palace.

Seventh: Selecting and responding to the mysterious summons.

**Ingesting the Jade Tablet and Penetrating Vision of Hidden Scripts**
The Master said: The nine grades of scriptures of the *Three Caverns of Shangqing* are divided into the *Four Auxiliaries*, comprising ten thousand scrolls. Only the *Three Stages of Lingbao* possess residual divine chapters, which prioritize the salvation of the dead and deliverance of the living. Those who serve the Perfected below often begin with diligence, yet ultimately fail to persist. This is due to the obscurity of worldly roots and the darkness of consciousness—where the six wisdoms remain unopened, one is deluded by the six heavens’ demons, and the four perverse influences arise wantonly, manifesting myriad transformations, unable to attain penetrating clarity.

Thus, among the scriptures of the Three Caverns, the highest is called *Dongzhen* ("Cavern of Perfection"). For ordinary practitioners of perfection, it unifies form and spirit, allowing the eyes to behold the Perfected and merge with the Dao in harmony. As for the middle and lower *Dongxuan* ("Cavern of Mystery") and *Dongshen* ("Cavern of Spirit"), they are the origin of the ten thousand methods and the root of the six penetrations. Therefore, the Heavenly Worthy verifies the *Eye of Dao-Wisdom* and the *Eye of Truth*, while the Perfected establishes the *Dharma Eye* and the *Eye of Compassion*. Thus, observing the Three Realms is like holding them in the palm of one’s hand.

The Heavenly Worthy established methods to illuminate inner contemplation, externally manifesting *penetrating vision* to reflect the *Eye of Dao-Wisdom*. *Compassionate vision*, *penetrating vision*, and *distant observation* embody the *Eye of Dharma-Compassion*. Therefore, in the Three Caverns, all who study *Dongzhen* must first *penetrate and see the Perfected* before attaining perfection. As for *Dongshen*, one must *witness the spirit-Perfected with the eyes* before achieving spirit-communion and becoming a spirit-immortal.

Among the ten thousand methods of the Three Caverns, none do not first require the self-clarity of the Three Caverns before one can communicate with spirits, and the numinous descends into the body—extending to *Dongshen*, *Dongyuan* ("Cavern of Abyss"), and *Dongling* ("Cavern of Numinosity"). The *Eight Histories of the Great Cavern*, the *Six Ding*, the *Spirit-Flight Six Jia*, and the *Luminous Cavern Vision* all establish methods for *communicating with the eyes*.

For male practitioners, lewdness; for female practitioners, perversity—when the six roots do not contend, one dissipates true *qi* and vainly hopes for *Dongshen*. Those of pure yang do not conceal their spirit-immortality, while those of pure yin manifest only as ghosts—this is the true secret.

The *Jade Tablet*, the ancestral scroll of the first method, when cultivated for a hundred days, causes true immortals to manifest their traces. Seeing them, one may command their service, summon celestial Perfected, and when merits and virtues are complete, ascend in broad daylight across the Three Caverns. Without this *Jade Tablet*, all efforts are in vain, and one will never attain penetrating clarity.

Formerly, this was not transmitted to the lower world. Because the *Lingbao* teachings spread and demonic perversities emerged from the yin, it was used to *penetrate and prevent* their *crooked mouths and hidden forms*, shielding Daoist practitioners from delusion. The *Jade Tablet* contains the *Inner Taboo Names* of the highest Perfected. Practicing it according to the method ensures swift attainment of perfection.

For transmission, choose the days of the *Three Origins*, the *Ten Upright Days*, or the *Eight Nodal Days*. Provide two jade tablets, nine taels of gold, a thousand feet of white silk, and a hundred thousand in alms-wealth to pledge alliance with the Three Officials. The master must not transmit without such a pledge. Should one recklessly divulge the celestial treasure, the master will punish them with the *Wind Blade’s Trial*. If the disciple practices yet fails to achieve anything, their lifespan will be reduced by a twelve-year cycle.

Assess the disciple’s capacity—whether abundant or modest—without misjudging their worth. Do not transmit to the unworthy, lest it be leaked to the undaoistic. The penalty for this is the same.

The Master says: Whenever receiving and upholding this method, on New Year’s Day, enter the oratory, face north, and set up an incense table. Arrange cinnabar and realgar, then use light yellow paper to inscribe the High Mystery’s Inner Taboo Names according to the prescribed form. Upon completion, bow twice, then store them in a clean casket, marking each with a secret seal to prevent confusion.

On the *jiazi* day, swallow the Three Heavens’ Hidden Taboo Names, the Heaven and Earth Jade Characters, the Three Rivers’ Taboo Names, and the Supreme Deity’s Inner Taboo Names.
On the *jiayin* day, swallow the Seven Luminaries’, Southern and Northern Dippers’, Three Terraces’, and Central Dipper’s Inner Taboo Names.

On the *jiashen* day, swallow the Divine Tiger’s, Divine Officials’, and Mysterious Maiden’s Inner Consorts’ Taboo Names.
On the *jiaxu* day, swallow the Thunder Deities’ Inner Taboo Names.

Whenever preparing to swallow a talisman, one must arrange incense, fire, a water vessel, a small sword, an emperor’s bell, and washing implements the night before, ensuring everything is complete to avoid last-minute deficiencies. Retire at the proper hour, then rise between the *zi* and *chou* hours to perform the ritual. Don proper attire, wash and rinse, then enter the oratory. Light incense and candles, draw a cup of well-flower water, and place it before the sacred images. Next, take the jade tablet containing the Inner Taboo Talismans and arrange them on the altar. Step back, enter the chamber, and pay homage to the Perfected. Clasp the Jade Purity Mudra with both hands and pace the Dipper to the sacred space. In spring and summer, begin pacing from *Kui*; in autumn and winter, from *Pou*. Offer incense at *Kui*, gaze toward the Heavenly Gate, and bow nine times. Kneel lengthily, secretly memorialize the Upper Grotto, and silently recite a petition, burning it in the censer. Bow twice again, clasp the Jade Purity Mudra with both hands, face north, and consecrate the water before swallowing the talisman according to the following method.

**Secret Memorial to the Perfected**
On this day, month, and year of the current Great Year, your subordinate [Name], humbly burns incense and reverently memorializes the Three Clarities’ Supreme Deities, the Jade Emperor, the Purple Tenuity Great Emperor, the Sun and Moon, the Five Stars, the Southern Asterisms and Northern Dipper, the Three Terraces’ Star Lords, the Three Heavens’ Perfected, the Four Saintly Marshals, the Five Marchmounts’ Five Emperors, the Seven Stellar Consorts, the Southern Prosperity Elder, the Six Ding Jade Maidens, the Six Jia Divine Lords, the Thunder Deities and Rain Department, the Divine Tiger Great Saint Envoys, the Four Upright Merit Officers, the Four Upright Divine Generals, the Grotto-Observing Divine Generals, and the Penetrating Vision Lads.

Your subordinate, in accordance with the *Lingbao* Great Law’s *Hunyuan* Jade Tablet and *Shangqing* Hidden Writings, on each *liu jia* day, combines and swallows the Perfected Ones’ Inner Taboo Names, Jade Characters, and Hidden Names in purification and ingestion, beseeching the Grotto-Observing Divine Perfected to command and employ immortal spirits, pursue souls, and seize *po*. Humbly hoping the Perfected’s compassion will not deem this petition presumptuous or offensive, permit your subordinate to ingest and uphold these talismans.

Now, on this *jiazi* day, I reverently follow the prescribed form to swallow the Perfected One’s Jade Character and Hidden Taboo Name. I pray for the descent of the true and proper Dao *qi* to irrigate my Dharma Eye, enabling me to penetrate and observe the hundred spirits, command the thousand Perfected, summon the Six Jia on my left, call the Six Ding on my right, establish traveling offices, foreknow the yet-unmanifest, embody water and fire, and transform without limit.

Your subordinate, unable to bear the weight of this prayer, prostrates in hope of your grace.

Upon concluding the prayer, burn the silent petition in the censer and bow nine times. Next, with the left hand, form the Five Marchmounts Mudra, securing it at the Central Marchmount. Offer incense, then with the right hand, pass the water over the incense. Grasp the emperor’s bell with the left hand and shake it seven times. With the right hand, pour the water seven times into the cup while reciting the incantation seven times.

**Pouring Water at the Northern *Kui* Incantation**
*Kui* manifests numinosity, *Kui* manifests sageliness.
Encountering baleful *qi*, it must respond with swift seizure.

Recite the incantation seven times, then draw seven breaths of northern *qi* and blow them into the water.

Next, form the Five Marchmounts Mudra, hold the water, wield the sword, and recite the following incantation.

**Great One Divine Incantation**
Reverently invoke the Great One Heavenly Perfected, the Primordial Heavenly Perfected, the True Immortals and True Persons, who correspond above to the Qian position.
The Six Ding spirits on the left, the Six Jia armies on the right,
Receive the Heavenly Heart on my behalf and universally save the myriad spirits.
Great One Divine Incantation, Southern Fire Wheel.
Expel evil, dispel illness, seize the water, and command.

Upon concluding the incantation, visualize the sun within the water, then recite the incantation seven times. Draw one breath each of southern and northern *qi*, blow them into the water, and with both hands, pass the water over the incense while reciting the incantation.

**Qianyuan Incantation**
Qianyuan, origination, prosperity, perseverance—
Sun and moon illuminate me.
Divine spring enters the five viscera,
The six bowels attain peace.
Immortals together ascend in transformation,
Soaring to pay homage in the Supreme Clarity.

Recite this incantation seven times, draw seven breaths of *qi* from the Heavenly Gate, blow them into the water, then release the water. Next, with both hands, begin at *zi* and trace the circuit: first form the mudra and flick the water, then circle through the twelve branches while reciting the following incantation.

**Five Peaks Upholding the Body Incantation**
The Five Peaks uphold the body,
Heaven and Earth share the same life.
Sun and moon revolve in motion,
Corresponding to the Five Phases.
Perfected Ones of the Celestial Circuit,
Jade names distinctly inscribed.
Each descends with true *qi*,
Irrigating the root of the womb.
Spirit clear, *qi* radiant,
Penetrating the profound darkness.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Bow twice, stand in *ding* position, hold the talisman, and examine each character line by line. Draw *qi* and swallow it.

**Method for Drawing Qi**
The disciple reverently follows the Great Law: on any day of the Six Jia, ingest the true *qi* of the various Perfected Ones.

Draw Heavenly *qi*—face *qian* and inhale.
Draw Earthly *qi*—face *kun* and inhale.
Draw Solar *qi*—face east and inhale.
Draw Lunar *qi*—face west and inhale.
Draw Five Planets’ *qi*—inhale once from each of the five directions.
Draw Three Sovereigns’ Brahman *qi*—inhale thrice from *zi*, *shen*, and *yin*.
Draw Southern Dipper *qi*—inhale six times from the south.
Draw Northern Dipper *qi*—inhale seven times from the north.
Draw Three Terraces *qi*—inhale thrice above the head of the Northern Dipper.
Draw Hidden *qi* of the Three Heavens’ Perfected Ones—inhale thrice from the Heavenly Gate.
Draw *qi* of the Three Masters who deliver my spirit—inhale thrice from the northwest.
Draw Wondrous *qi* of the Five Peaks upholding the body—inhale once from each of the five directions.
Draw *qi* of the Three Paths’ General Controller—inhale thrice from the south, the Northern Yin Heavenly Gate.
Draw Gentle true *qi* of the Six Ding—inhale once from each *ding* cyclical direction.
Draw Martial *qi* of the Six Jia—inhale once from each *jia* cyclical direction.
Draw Transformative *qi* of the Great One—inhale twice from the *yin* direction of the Great One.
Draw True *qi* of the Seven Yin Divine Tigers—inhale from the northwest.

Draw True *qi* of the Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Woman—inhale thrice from the southwest.
Draw *qi* of the Thunder and Rain Division—inhale eleven times from the *xun* direction.

Upon completing the inhalation of *qi*, recite the following incantation:
Heaven is my canopy, Earth my support.
Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are my garments.
I conceal myself within the Three Realms,
At the center of the Great Void.
*Qian* cannot encroach, the branches cannot harm.
Now let Heaven and Earth be unable to perceive my substance,
Sun and moon unable to perceive my form,
Ghosts and spirits unable to perceive my body.
I traverse the Great Emptiness,
Emerging from darkness, entering obscurity.
A thousand evils, ten thousand perversities,
Demonic calamities contrary to the Dao—
Those who encounter me die,
Those who meet me perish.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon concluding the incantation, draw *qi* from the ten directions, form the Ten Thousand Seals mudra, and flick it into the water. Then face the Heavenly Gate, visualize yourself as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, silently recite the hidden jade talisman’s name, take the jade talisman with your left hand, and swallow it with water. Inhale three mouthfuls of water, then spray the remaining water toward the Heavenly Gate.

After swallowing the talisman, next take the Seven-Character Divine Tiger Jade Talisman into your left hand. With your right hand, form the Five Peaks and Three Paths mudra, stopping at the Central Peak to stabilize it. Recite the incantation:
Command the transformation of the primordial *hun* and *po* stars,
Let the flying testes descend with true *qi* into my body.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!

Upon concluding the incantation, draw one breath of *qi* from each of the five directions, intending to infuse it into the water. Visualize the Seven Yin Ladies descending with dark radiance *qi* into the water. With your left hand, cast the jade talisman into your mouth, and with your right hand, take water to send it down. Then inhale the remaining water, spray it toward the Ghost Gate, shout the command to seize, bow twice, and withdraw. Set aside the water and sword, then draw one breath of *qi* from the Ghost Gate, hold your breath, and in a quiet chamber, face south and sit upright to practice the Primordial Internal Contemplation.

**Three Paths and Five Peaks Mudra**
For the Five Peaks mudra: cross the left and right hands with palms facing upward, interlocking the little fingers and ring fingers. Hook the left and right middle fingers with the opposite little fingers. Hook the left and right third fingers with the opposite ring fingers, extending them straight alongside the middle fingers. Raise the thumbs to support the middle fingers.

**Primordial Internal Contemplation**
The master says: When practicing this method, sit upright facing south in a quiet chamber, burn incense, and place a mirror before you. Draw one breath of *qi* from the Ghost Gate and blow it into the mirror. Then close the chamber and practice Primordial Internal Contemplation, which must be performed while sitting upright.

First gather the *qi* of the hexagrams, then visualize the five viscera:
The heart is like a lotus bud, like red *gaoying*, within the lungs below.
The lungs are like a flowery canopy, like white *gaoying*.
The liver is like a golden bell, eight-petaled, on the left, like purple *gaoying*. The gallbladder is like a strung pearl, its color like blue-green *gaoying*.
The spleen is like an overturned plate, like yellow-purple *gaoying*, covering the Great Granary below, which is yellow.
The kidneys are one and six, before the stomach, directly opposite the cinnabar field behind the navel, five-colored with central yellow, one *cun* and two *fen* in size, arranged like the hexagrams in the color of true cinnabar.

**Internal Contemplation Diagram**
On yang days: first take six sets of six breaths (thirty-six breaths) to form one yang line. Repeat this to complete six lines, forming *Qian* and *Kun*. Then take four sets of six breaths (twenty-four breaths) to transform the odd yang into an even yin line. Repeat this to complete six lines, forming the *Kun* hexagram.

On yin days: first take four sets of six breaths (twenty-four breaths) to form one yin line. Repeat this to complete six lines, forming the *Kun* hexagram. Then take six sets of six breaths (thirty-six breaths) to transform the even yin into an odd yang line. Repeat this to complete six lines, transforming into *Qian* and *Kun*.

**Alternative Method**
Yang Day Cavern-Viewing Hexagram *Qi* Method

**Yin Day Hexagram Qi Method**
Again visualize as before to form the *Kun* hexagram. Without drawing breath, from below ascend upward, swish and swallow twenty-four breaths, dividing them into six mouthfuls to swallow. Let the fluid descend naturally to form one yang line.

Upon completing this, once more settle the mind and calm the thoughts, closing the *qi* for a long while. Allow the spirit to congeal and *qi* to emerge, then perform mutual exchange and guiding exercises two or three times to ensure the *qi* flows freely between above and below. Next, regulate the breath and practice the method of thorough visualization.

**Perceiving the Hundred Spirits**
The Master says: When first practicing this method, silently invoke the hundred spirits. After the morning audience with the Perfected, observe your true form appearing in the mirror. Only then face the mirror to summon the celestial deities, earthly spirits, Jade Maidens, Jade Lads, Merit Officers, talisman clerks, and attending servants.

**Method of Stealth, Stealth, Stealth, and *Gou***
First recite the water incantation, wash the ears and eyes before and behind, then practice penetrating vision.

**Azure Mystery Water Incantation**
Reverently invite the Azure Maiden, the Spirit-Responsive Perfected Youth, to ascend and descend with the primordial life mandate.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Azure Mystery Heavenly Worthy commands.*

This is the Jade Purity mudra. Hold it over the water’s surface, face east, and recite the incantation nine times. Draw the eastern *qi* nine times, combine it with the mudra, and flick it into the water. Then raise the Jade Purity mudra and wash the ears and eyes with the middle finger.

**Ear and Eye Washing Incantation**
Azure Youths, carry out the decree for your servant.
*Swiftly, swiftly, open my spirit’s passage, divine objects, observe people, and respond to the numinous.*

Upon completion, gaze sharply into the mirror.

**Great Incantation of the Numinous Treasure Jade Mirror**
Reddish haze, ink-black, grinding the true, *walà*, Numinous Treasure.
*Xingsheng turns, Duli shifts, Kehan the Sage, Gongdu’s wish.*
*Xingsheng turns, Duli shifts, Kehan the Bright, Gongdu fulfills. Cut the corners true, gather souls and seize.*
*Gongdu gathers souls and seizes.*

Summon the swift messengers of the eight directions, celestial deities, earthly spirits, and the myriad spirits to assemble as one.

*By the decree of the Conjoined Brightness Heavenly Emperor, by the decree of Heaven and Earth, seize.*

This method: first form the Three Coatings and Five Peaks mudra with both hands, recite the incantation, draw the *qi* of the five directions, and blow it into the mirror. Next, blow toward the Ghost Gate, inhale the *qi* of the Ghost Gate, and blow toward the southeast. Recite the incantation again, inhale the southeastern *qi*, and blow it into the mirror. Then blow toward the Heaven Gate once more, recite the incantation again, inhale the *qi* of the Heaven Gate, and blow it into the mirror.

**Incantation:**
Reverently invite the great deities of the eight trigrams—*Qian*, *Kan*, *Gen*, *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Li*, *Kun*, and *Dui*—to gather and seize the wayward and demonic spirits from the eight directions, causing them to manifest their forms within my mirror.
*Swiftly, swiftly, seize.*

This method: with a brush, mark one point from *Qian* to *Dui*, eight points in total. Draw the directional *qi* and blow it to illuminate the ghostly beings of the Three Realms and the hundred spirits of the ten directions, revealing their forms. For matters unknown, close the eyes briefly, blow *qi* into the mirror, and upon closing the eyes, the vision will appear. Practicing this daily, all ghosts and demons will naturally reveal their true forms without concealment.

Recite again:
*Xingsheng turns, Duli shifts, Kehan the Bright, Gongdu fulfills. Cut the corners true.*
*Gather souls and seize.*
*Gongdu gathers souls and seizes.*

Upon completing the incantation, draw the *qi* of the eight directions and blow it into the mirror. With daily devotion, the spirit-*qi* will naturally manifest beings without further effort.

This method: face the Heaven Gate, recite the incantation, inhale *qi* and blow it toward the ten directions. Recite the incantation again, inhale the *qi* of the ten directions, and blow it into the mirror.

**Incantation to Summon Spirits into the Mirror**
Heaven and earth ascend and descend, the two *qi* intermingle.
The two *qi* of yin and yang, sun and moon conjoin in brightness.
I now decree and summon the penetrating vision spirits, the divine beings of heaven above and below, yin and yang, to appear in their true forms within my precious mirror.

This method: raise the *Qian*-*Kun* talisman, face east, and draw one mouthful each of southeastern and northwestern *qi*, blowing it toward the mirror’s surface—this is called the Upper Mystery *qi* blow.

**Incantation for Sharply Gazing at Celestial Deities in the Mirror**
From whence do I derive this power, to sharply gaze at celestial deities in the mirror?
Yin and yang harmonize and align, the imperial mandate manifests the body.

**Holding the Numinous Treasure Mirror**
Black crow of the eastern sun, vermilion Thearch spirit.
No coercive force can compel—
the Three Origins naturally return to the mirror.

Sun and moon stir the wheel of intent;
within the realm, all numinous officials—
or as some say, celestial and terrestrial deities—
swiftly manifest their forms at will.

This method: blow southeastern *qi* onto the mirror’s surface.

**Method for Penetrating Vision**
First inscribe the central section of jade characters and swallow them. If unclear, further inscribe the names of the thirty-two heavens and swallow them. Morning and evening, recite one scroll of the *Huangting Neijing Jing*. Once at dawn and once at dusk, in a quiet, dim chamber, use the second finger of both hands to press the four directions above the eyes, then trace the circular light nine times.

**Incantation:**
The circular light scatters and divides,
crimson, clear, and purple clouds.
The Three *Qi* linger and protect,
preserving your bodily root.
Piercing vision of a hundred spirits,
penetrating sight of ten thousand deities.
The pupil-child within the eye
clearly beholds the worthy perfected.
If there be communion with the numinous,
together we ascend to the Upper Clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances.

After reciting the incantation, press the hands to the eyes and brows, nine times each.

**Method for Shifting Scenery and Communicating Light**
Divine light, divine light,
illuminating the eight directions.
Above, it connects with sun and moon;
below, it pierces the frigid regions.
East, south, west, north—
universally shining upon the ten thousand states.
Celestial deities and perfected immortals,
scenery, mountains, and rivers,
seas, rivers, and springs,
ghosts and beings of the hidden depths—
wherever the Three Lights shine,
nothing remains concealed.
The divine light mirror seizes all,
no obstruction, not even a hair’s breadth.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes of the Three Realms of Upper Clarity.

This method: visualize the eastern sun, western moon, and Northern Dipper. Recite the incantation once, draw *qi*, and blow onto the mirror or the center of the palm. First anoint with sesame oil, then raise the intention to illuminate.

**Incantation for Intent**
□□ facing the Most High,
dispatching the radiant true body.
If the intent of the ordinary mind does not arrive,
the pupil-child will not descend.
First recite the incantation, then with the left hand trace from *mao* to *wu*, pressing firmly, and call: "Divine generals, swiftly come to attend the origin."
Draw three mouthfuls of southern *qi* and direct them to the place, commanding the pupil-child to look. If a divine person arrives, all will manifest their forms.

Recite the incantation again:
□□ bestows the true method,
the ten thousand spirits all return in full.
If the descending pupil-child is not believed,
silently blow upon the household—
even small children will see and manifest as such.

**Numinous Treasure Jade Mirror for Penetrating Subtle Mysteries**
Red apricot, *mao* ink-black,
*li* grind true,
*dui* stocking wax,
*chou* numinous treasure.
Central revival engenders transformation,
*chen* solitary servant shifts,
*mao* may be Han brightness,
*yin* merit all accomplished.
Two fingers press beneath the thumb’s nail.

Cut the corner straight,
two fingers press the center of the thumb.

Thumb presses the center.
Merit all gathers the hun and seizes.
Swift messengers of the eight directions,
celestial deities and earthly spirits,
the ten thousand spirits return as one—
unite with the luminous Heavenly Thearch of the sun,
unite with the mandate of heaven and earth to seize.

This method: face the ghost gate and recite the incantation once. Draw *qi* from the eight directions and blow onto the banner—it will naturally grow heavy. Do this three times. First form the Three Crossings and Five Sufferings mudra, recite the incantation, draw southeastern *qi*, and blow onto the mirror. With a brush, begin at the *qian* direction and mark eight points.

**Incantation:**
Reverently summon the great deities of the eight trigrams—*qian*, *kan*, *gen*, *zhen*, *xun*, *li*, *kun*, *dui*—to swiftly descend.

This method: draw *qi* from the eight directions and blow. A thousand eyes behold as one; sun and moon receive and uphold. Those who do not expend spirit-*qi* will naturally manifest their forms within.

**Incantation for Manifesting Forms**
Reverently summon the Great Heaven of Primordial Origin above,
the Perfected of the Left Mystery,
the Perfected of the Right Mystery.
Hear your disciple’s summons:
illuminate the golden essence,
open the jade portal.
Seize and manifest the soul of the departed *so-and-so*,
the spirit of *so-and-so*—
swiftly manifest the form.

This method: press the center of the middle finger, recite the incantation once, draw northern *qi*, blow onto water, sip a mouthful, and spray toward the ghost gate. Visualize drawing *qi* and blowing onto the banner. Recite "no concealment permitted" thirty-six times.

**Shifting Scenery and Communicating Light**
The ordinances of the Primordial Origin,
the edict of the Lord of the Dao.

**Summoning the Radiant Lads**
Summon the Lad of Sunlight, the Lad of Moonlight, the Lad of Starlight, the Lad of Cavernous Yang, the Lad of Luminous Dawn. Mobilize the mysterious Dipper of the Three Lights, the mysterious essence of sun and moon, transforming them into the sixfold divine radiance of universal penetration. Shine through and illumine the ten directions of the world, where myriad scenes and a thousand Perfected Ones shift to manifest before one’s eyes—divining persons, foretelling objects, revealing the unmanifest and the yet-to-come, communicating with spirits and invoking numinous response.

**Method:** Draw *qi* from the midst of the Three Lights and blow onto a brush, or use a finger to inscribe a talisman in the palm. The brush should be dipped in cinnabar; the finger, in hempseed oil. After inscribing, blow *qi* and recite the incantation again. Recite the incantation, draw *qi*, and blow—repeat this three times. A streak of fire will appear, penetrating and illuminating the netherworld and events yet to unfold.

**The Celestial Bureau’s Cavernous Mystery Mirror**
Red haze, black ink, grind the true, wrap in wax, *Lingbao*.

**Incantation:** In midair, trace with the left hand the Heart Seal of one’s original master. With the right hand, gather it from the void into the palm, then blow the *qi* of the five directions seven times. Press down—repeat this three times until the three colors of blue, yellow, and white appear.

Recite again:
Reverently summon the talismanic envoys of descending Perfection and summoning numina—hasten to descend, true *qi* alight upon the eyes, by edict.

Draw the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate and blow—behold the talismans of Descending Perfection and Summoning Numinous Spirits, their cinnabar hues manifesting in the palm.

Recite again:
Divine winds stir and blow, jade scripts resound like chimes.

Blow the *qi* of the southeast—behold the two talismans swaying.

Recite again:
Reverently summon the Lad of the Dao Who Opens the East, the Lad of the Dao Who Opens the South, the Lad of the Dao Who Opens the West, the Lad of the Dao Who Opens the North, the Lad of the Dao Who Opens the Center—hasten to descend with me.

Draw the *qi* of the five directions and blow—behold the Lads of the Five Directions. Only then may each be summoned, pursued, and made to descend, to be employed according to the method.

**The Cavernous Mystery Mirror of Numinous Treasure** further states: Summon spirits into the mirror. Heaven and Earth descend their *qi*, sun and moon conjoin their light. Above in the heavens, below on the earth, *so-and-so* from *such-and-such* place manifests in form.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the ordinances and edicts.

Draw the *qi* of Heaven and Earth and blow as in the usual method.

**Method for Expediting the Passage of Departed Souls**
The master says: When approaching the altar to subdue demonic and wayward spirits, one must ensure that both the living and the dead receive benefit and deliverance. First, break open the prison.

**Incantation for Breaking Open the Prison**
Primordial Origin of the Primordial Above, Lord of the Dao on High. Instruct your servant to wield the talisman, illuminating and breaking open the dark prison, that the sin-laden souls may depart and be freed.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the ordinances and edicts.

This incantation is from the *Scripture of Ninefold Pure Brahmanic Chanting*. Face the Heavenly Gate, recite silently nine times, blow *qi* onto the departed soul—thus the soul-spirit shall be released from suffering.

Next, employ the refinement of Water and Fire.

**Incantation for Water Refinement**
Withered, revive; extinguished, live again. Attain rebirth in the heavens, receive anew the Great Numen. Through the kalpas of the Nine Heavens, return and repeat the womb’s infancy. Filth and karmic burdens dissolve and vanish—ascend in broad daylight, reborn.

**Method:** Take a vessel of water, face north, and knock the teeth nine times. Visualize three Jade Lads and seven Jade Maidens. Spit seven mouthfuls of saliva, recite the incantation seven times, and sprinkle the departed soul.

**Incantation for Fire Refinement**
Sunlight and moonlight, lingering in Cavernous Yang. Flowing fire enters the vessel, refining and transforming yin’s baleful radiance. Corporeal filth vanishes, the myriad *qi* harmonize in well-being. Transcend the five sufferings, ascend and soar to the celestial halls.

**Method:** Take a vessel of fire, face south, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize as before, exhale *qi* three times, and blow nine times. Take the true form of Deng Mountain and reduce it to ash. Burn the Primordial Talismanic Mandate of the True Form of Deng Metropolis to subdue demons and carry out the rites. Protect and recommend the departed soul, that it may be ranked in the Southern Palace. The embers of Deng Metropolis extinguish, the Three Officials relax their punishments. Bonds, fetters, and karmic obstructions are absolved—receive transformation and be reborn. Refined according to rank, ascend to the courts of blessedness.

When the incantation is complete, press the tongue against the upper palate. Visualize the body as the primordial Celestial Worthy of Numinous Treasure upon the crown of the head, silently recite the hidden words once, and envision golden radiance filling the mouth. With both hands form the Mudra of Jade Purity, then scatter the ash toward the northeast. Release the mudra, and the soul shall immediately ascend to the Vermilion Palace, where, refined according to rank, it returns to life in the courts of blessedness.

**Section on the Weaving of Scriptural and Ritual Practice**

**Method of Penetrating Vision**
To enter the chamber: regulate the breath and sit within the layered halls. This means one has already taken a seat before the peachwood altar table. Suspend a mirror above the altar, with a basin of water before the mirror’s surface. The yang spirit resides in the mirror, the yin spirit in the water.

The Perfected of Numinous Treasure, divine so-and-so, swiftly manifest your form here.

**Urgent as the statutes command!**

**Method for the Placard of the Chamber**
The Chamber of Divine Tiger Penetrating Vision—may the attending officials, soldiers, *gongcao* messengers, and jade maidens of this chamber, who await the dawn’s audience and the cessation of routine duties, swiftly assemble here in clear manifestation to guard and attend, heeding the summons of this chamber.

To the right, prepare a placard, inscribed on both sides:
*Today, enter the chamber. Today, do not enter the chamber.*

**Method for the Silent Memorial of Penetrating Vision**
[Your] subordinate, the Dharma-ranked [disciple] of [such-and-such] surname, prostrates and bows twice, respectfully memorializing:

I humbly reflect that, though born in the lower realms, I early planted good affinities, received the numinous scriptures, and gained access to the Dao’s domain. Presumptuously holding office in the Three Caverns’ Dharma duties, I strive to deliver the dead and ferry the living, to cleanse the dust-rooted defilements, to concentrate my thoughts on the supreme Dao, and to cultivate refinement from beginning to end, upholding the precepts without lapse.

Yet, with my defiled, ordinary frame, I have not fathomed the profound principle of the Primordial Origin. My ears and eyes are blocked, my body and mind benighted—how could I clearly perceive spirits and gods, or penetrate the hidden and manifest?

Yesterday, by the grace of my initiation master [so-and-so], I received the transmission of the *Numinous Treasure Great Rites* and the *Hundred Million Characters of Penetrating Vision* from the *Jade Tablet of the Primordial Origin*. Today, on this [such-and-such] day, I reverently swallow the inner secret name in accordance with the method, to achieve penetrating vision of the true numina.

I humbly beseech the ancestral masters, the Three Treasures, and the divine numina of the Emperors on High to pardon my transgressions of irreverence and offense, and to grant the marvel of their transformative refinement. May they specially bestow the true, living *qi* of rectitude, the luminous wisdom of the Great Dao, the salvific grace of the Three Treasures, and the sixfold penetrating *qi* of the perfected, flowing into the fields of my body.

Within, may they scour the dust from the mirror of my heart; without, may they dispel the filth from my ears and eyes. May they open the radiance of my viscera, dissolve the yin stagnation of the hundred passages, subdue and vanquish demonic calamities and karmic obstructions, and sever the knotted roots of the womb’s origin.

Thus may I, having swallowed the inner secret divine script, instantly illuminate the ten directions, sit in contemplation of the Three Realms, penetrate the hidden and manifest, clearly perceive spirits and gods, deliver the dead and aid the living, cultivate the true and study the Dao. Whatever I desire or turn toward, may no wish go unfulfilled.

May this assist the flourishing of the true wind and exalt the mysterious transformation on high. I dare not lightly divulge or neglect [these teachings], nor betray the Dao or my master. Should I violate this covenant, I willingly submit to the mysterious statutes.

Your subordinate prostrates and secretly presents this memorial of the heart, one document, respectfully addressed to the throne of the Most August Three Treasures before the gates of the Three Heavens.

Your subordinate, unable to contain his fervent entreaty, is overwhelmed with awe and trepidation.

[Seal] the inner [memorial] with the Six *Ding*.

The Master said: On the sixth day of each month at the hour of *wu* (noon), take six characters of the true secret names of the Six *Ding* in cinnabar script on yellow silk, facing the direction of the current ten-day period as the head, and arrange the rest in order. Draw in *qi* and distribute them. Form every two characters into one talisman, making three talismans in total. On the seventh day at the first watch of *chou* (1–3 a.m.), upon waking, put on your clothes, face the *Ding* direction, and take one talisman to form into a pellet. Recite its name and swallow it with pure water. At the appointed time, when you first hear a sound like someone stirring, swiftly face the original direction, draw in *qi* six times, and swallow it. The same applies to the middle seventh day and the last three ten-day periods. After practicing this method for a full month, whenever you have any matter, face the direction of the current ten-day period, recite the names, draw in *qi*, and swallow it. Close your eyes for a long while, and the Six *Ding* will report to your heart-spirit. Whatever arises in your mind or is spoken will all be future events, with no failure to manifest. If malevolent ghosts or spirits trouble you, use the same method, and the Six Spirits will reveal the cause of the ghostly affliction. Even the colors of clothing, the number of people, and all details will be verified.

**Externally Aligning the Six Jia**
The Master said: On each *Jia* day of the month at the hour of *mao* (5–7 a.m.), write the names of the Six *Jia* in cinnabar on white silk, face the direction of the current ten-day period, and swallow it with westward-flowing water. If the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, stars) are not visible, use well water. Afterward, clench your fists firmly, sit upright, and strike the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times. Knock your teeth twenty-four times, interlock your hands in the *xiangyi* mudra, perform the Crane’s Peck six times, and rotate the Three Passes nine times. Separate your hands to part the water at the nape. Visualize the *qi* field below the navel as a radiant sun, blazing like fire throughout your body, both inside and out, glowing red. Recite the names thirty-six times, draw in *qi*, and blow it over your body. Constantly visualize the Six Spirits attending you. The Six *Jia* will reveal future events in dreams before they occur. The Six *Jia* will always guard your form, and over time, you will see them and command them at will. For minor malevolent spirits causing harm, write their talismans in cinnabar, burn them with gold coins in fire, and the Six Generals will immediately dispatch them into the sea.

**Harmonizing Memorials and Petitions**
The Master said: On the day before the last day of the year, bathe and change clothes in advance. At dawn the next day, sit upright in a secluded chamber, face the Gate of Heaven, and recite the hidden secret names of the Three Heavens—*yong*, *liu*, *jing*—continuously for twelve hours, completing a total of three hundred thousand recitations. On New Year’s Day, maintain silence for the entire day. Thereafter, whenever reciting memorials, petitions, or invocations, perform the method once: draw in eastern *qi* and blow it onto the text, and it will immediately reach its destination, receiving a mysterious response. It is also said: On the last day of each month, recite one hundred thousand times, and memorials will swiftly reach the Three Heavens.

**Urgent Relief from Distress**
The Master said: On the eight solar terms, observe a pure fast. At the end of *xu* (7–9 p.m.) and the beginning of *hai* (9–11 p.m.), enter a quiet chamber, sit upright, and recite the inner secret names of the Three Heavens, guarding the center and reciting the *Biao De Pan Lei* one hundred thousand times. When encountering tigers, wolves, or poisonous creatures, hold your breath for seven cycles, recite the names thirty-two times, and all toxins will subside and cause no harm. It is also said: On the first day of each month, recite ten thousand times. After three months, this will respond to all disasters and urgent distress. Silently recite thirty-two times, and disasters will naturally dissolve.

**Guarding the Body with the Five Peaks**
The Master said: On the ninth day after the Beginning of Spring, the third day after the Beginning of Summer, the seventh day after the Beginning of Autumn, and the fifth day after the Beginning of Winter, on the day when earth *qi* flourishes, face each direction at the hours of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, *you*, *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*, and knock your teeth according to the number of the direction. Visualize the lords, officials, and officers of the Eastern Peak leading the Four Peaks before you. Recite the Five Peaks incantation, chant the names of the Five Peaks, draw in the *qi* of the five directions, and swallow it. After a year of practice, when seeking matters or fearing urgent distress—such as traveling through mountains or crossing waters—first knock your teeth five times, recite the names, draw in the *qi* of the five directions, and swallow it. Then blow over your body and distribute the *qi* to the directions. You will escape distress, and all your endeavors will be supremely auspicious and as you wish.

**Penetrating Wisdom and Myriad Insights**
The Master said: On the fifth day of the fifth month, write the secret names of the Northern Dipper in cinnabar without counting the number, wrap them nine times in red silk, place them in a green bamboo tube, seal it tightly with paper, and secure it in the handle of a hawk’s perch. Retrieve it when fully prepared. Consume one dose per day, and you will recite ten thousand words, gaining penetrating wisdom and insight. Alternatively, on the seventh day of the first ten-day period, write on yellow silk with cinnabar, wrap it seven times in *tengpao*, and take one pill per day, swallowing it with pure water. After forty-nine days, you will foreknow all matters, your wisdom will commune with the divine, and you will recite ten thousand words daily without forgetting. It is also said: On the night of the seventh day of the first ten-day period, take one grain of frankincense and one grain of cinnabar the size of a bean, soak them in a bowl of westward-flowing water or well water, and add the cinnabar-written Dipper name to the water. Face east, recite the *Qingtong Fengming* incantation, chew the frankincense and cinnabar finely, and swallow them with the water. Then face north, recite the Dipper name and the incantation: *"Northern Dipper, Supreme Unity Divine Youth, one inhalation brings a hundred responses."* Recite seven times, form the Dipper talisman into a pellet, and swallow it with water. Next, recite the incantation: *"Divine Youth of Azure Radiance, spirit light mysteriously bright."* Recite nine times, draw in eastern *qi*, and blow it into the remaining water to wash your eyes. On the eighth day, omit the frankincense and cinnabar, using only the Dipper name and reciting the three previous incantations to consecrate the water for washing your eyes. When someone submits a petition, use only the first three incantations, draw in eastern *qi* and swallow it, close the door briefly, and whatever arises in your mind or is spoken will all align with the petitioner’s intent. Keep this secret.

**Daily Talisman Ingestion Practice**
The Master said: Write one *bao* (precious) character in cinnabar on yellow paper, totaling twenty-one strokes. Recite the incantation *"Qin Jing Quan Shou Mo Qi Kui Zhi Pi Ze Zhi Po"* (twenty-one characters), one incantation per stroke as you write. Swallow one talisman daily, visualizing the *ling* (spirit) character in your heart and the *bao* (precious) character on your head.

The Master said: For all injuries from poisonous substances, as well as paralysis, swelling, cinnabar tumors, and ailments of the five viscera and six bowels, write the Four Upright Yin-Yang taboo names on the afflicted area, either ingesting them internally or applying them externally. No more than three characters are needed before recovery is achieved.

The Master said: For all illnesses, write the Southern Dipper taboo names and ingest them. Write in cinnabar on yellow paper.

**Five Peaks Pacifying and Stabilizing Talismans**
The Master said: When writing talismans, first recite the *Kuicheng* incantation, form the *chen* mudra, draw in *Kuicheng qi*, and blow it onto the inkstone. Next, recite the *Qianyuan* incantation to infuse the brush, then recite the *Taiyi* incantation and blow onto the ink. After a while, grind the ink forty-nine times in alternating directions, draw in southeastern *qi*, and blow it onto the inkstone. Then recite the *Five Peaks Upholding the Body* incantation, form the mudra with the middle finger, blow onto the paper, and write the talisman in cinnabar. Silently recite the incantation once more, draw in northwestern *qi*, release the mudra into the talisman, seal and imprint it according to the method, and have the patient carry the talisman while burning it with prayers. When it is consumed in the flames, a response will manifest. The *Fuzheng* talisman is practiced in the same manner.

**Shangqing Wondrous Conduct Perfected One’s Year-Breaking Talismans**
Heaven and Earth taboo names, Sun and Moon taboo names, Five Stars taboo names, Four Upright taboo names, Six Ding taboo names on yang days, Six Jia taboo names on yin days.

Dao Treasures, Dharma Treasures, and the sacred decrees of Zhenwu, the Celestial Marshal, and the Great Generals of the Luo Heaven are invoked: *"We respectfully summon [Name] Spirit to act in accordance with the decree."*

On the day of the year, month, day, and hour, the proclamation is issued.
The Dharma position: [Surname] [Given Name], acting in accordance.

**Five Peaks Pacifying and Stabilizing Talisman**
The Master said: For all malevolent spirits, demonic entities, haunted altars, inauspicious temples, cursed lands, water demons, flood dragons, and jade serpents, write in cinnabar on a large stone and sink it, or bury it in place.

The Five Peaks stabilize the five directions: Heaven corresponds to the northwest, Earth to the southwest, and Humanity to the southeast. The *Gongdu* is in the northeast. When writing, form the mudra of the Five Peaks and Three Passes, draw in their *qi*, and blow it onto the talisman.

**Nine Palaces Revealing Ghosts**
The Divine Master said: If a disciple lacks steadfast power and encounters all manner of unruly ghosts and spirits, they may rely on the Nine Palaces method. Men begin at the *Li* Palace, moving counterclockwise each year, initially skipping the second palace and starting at the *Kan* Palace. Each year, they move counterclockwise, skipping *Gen*, and always passing through one yang palace per year. Determine the palace based on the year, then proceed to the month within the year, the day within the month, and the hour within the day. Further subdivide by the hour to identify the time of illness, transgression, or ghostly manifestation. The year’s branch, month’s branch, day’s branch, and direction will reveal the nature of the ghost or spirit.

*Qian* governs heavy-headedness, difficulty lifting the body, cold and pain in both feet—afflictions caused by a yang person. If a lingering illness leads to death, the spirit sinks in the northwest. If there are vows or pledges involving banners and incense, the *Kan* Palace brings mental confusion and lethargy, with dark-clad spirits or wayward souls. Abdominal rumbling, water swelling, or limb distension may occur, with drowned spirits struggling to speak. Wandering in the due north may cause strange dreams and sorrowful sighs. A single ghost, whether yin or yang, requires careful questioning to uncover the cause.

*Gen* affects the heart and flanks with fullness, throat obstruction, raving speech, and erratic behavior, with uncontrollable grief and laughter. Groups of eight ghosts often haunt temples or improperly tended graves. Stone and metal spirits may also appear in the northeast—examine their forms closely.

*Zhen* brings jaundice and pestilence, alternating chills and fever spreading to the limbs, loss of appetite, cursing, and offenses against heavenly decrees. Ghosts of those executed, killed by epidemics, or clad in blue-green may follow, with red and yellow female ghosts appearing. Danger looms within three days.

*Xun* causes delirious speech, blindness, and riddles that cannot be deciphered. Ancestral spirits may speak in hushed tones, while external curses often come from women. Ghosts seize the hun and po souls, causing day and night groaning. Only through purification and seeking the Great Dao can health and peace be restored.

*Li* brings misfortune in the due south, with paralysis, pain, burns, and sores. Overheating and jaundice may occur, with blood ghosts and those who died in childbirth. Those who perished from slander or violent deaths, or who haunt their relatives, are yang spirits. Face the fire position to confront these malevolent ghosts and reveal their actions.

*Kun* affects the spleen and stomach, causing dysentery and bodily weakness. Chronic conditions are difficult to cure, as lingering corpses reside in the southwest. Disturbing the earth may offend the yearly *sha*, manifesting strange lights. Ancestral mothers and drowned spirits may follow, drawn by improper burials.

*Dui* brings consumption, convulsions, wheezing, coughing, and foot ailments. Burials that bring misfortune or injuries from punishments may cause recurring afflictions. Seeking merit through misguided rituals or ancient artifacts near the home may invite three accompanying ghosts, leading to grievances and retribution.

The Master said: This method, practiced with purification and ingestion, refines the self into truth. When the cycle is complete, the technique of penetrating vision becomes fixed. The gaze is like seeing through a dark window or piercing a mouse’s hole, discerning objects a hundred paces away in the mist. With eyes closed for a long time, focus the vision. If the mind wanders even slightly, the eye’s spirit will stray, and the luminous perception will fade. Initially, it appears as a thin mist, then as scattered colored lights. After twenty-eight days, it resembles shadows; after thirty-five days, it gradually clarifies; after forty-nine days, forms and attire become visible; after ninety days, voices and sounds can be heard; and after a hundred days, one may command immortals and spirits. Above all, maintain purity and stillness. If unable to practice this, proceed with the *Inner Vision of the Central Repository* method.

The Dao of the Numinous Treasure has three levels: the highest is the *Emperor One and Returning Wind* Dao; the middle is the *Central Principle of Five Qi Harmonization*, bestowed upon the Five Emperors; the lowest is the *Ten Transformations of Returning Spirit* scripture, entrusted to the various Perfected Ones. Beyond these three, the remaining methods serve to aid the living and deliver the dead, summoning the true and invoking the numinous. Those who study the highest Dao and aspire to immortality will find all essentials within these texts.

**Inner Vision of the Central Repository**
The Master said: If one cannot enter seclusion for a hundred days, on a *liu jia* day at dawn, face south and sit upright. Write the inner taboo names in black ink on white silk, place them in a clean vase, and add soil from the six directions of the current ten-day period, each in its corresponding position, covering the taboo names in the vase. Place the vase in the *jia* direction and seal it according to the method.

Then sit upright, circling the Five Peaks and Three Paths mudra once with both hands, recite the incantation once, and inhale the qi of the six directions to swallow it. Next, recite the prayer again and inhale the qi of the *jia* direction to swallow it. By noon, impurities will be cleansed, and verification achieved. After ten days of stabilization, on the following *jia* day, take the previous jade tablet and burn it, mixing the ashes with dark mystery water to ingest. Discard the soil from the prior ten-day period into flowing water. Rewrite the jade tablet and again place soil in the vase as before. Then perform the mudra circuit and recite the incantation. After completing sixty *jia* days, inner vision will reveal the five viscera, and with eyes closed, one may commune with spirits and penetrate the numinous. If one violates the precepts through sexual indulgence, all prior efforts will be lost, and lifespan will be shortened by one hundred twenty years.

**Aligning with the Dipper**
The Master said: The method of aligning with the Dipper requires selecting a site unpolluted by birth or death defilements. Construct a frame resembling a bamboo trellis, upon which place a carpenter’s square to model the Dipper’s form. At the crucial juncture of the square, suspend eight bright mirrors so their light shines downward, following the Dipper’s configuration to point toward the earth’s directions. Below, use white chalk to draw the Dipper’s shape upon the stars, placing a lamp on the ground so its light aligns with the mirrors’ reflection. With seven feet of red silk, inscribe the inner names of the Seven Stars and bind it beneath the forehead. Don pure garments, wield a sword, and arrange all according to the diagram. The Perfected Master should choose a time after clear skies and rain for optimal effect.

When aligning with the Dipper, begin at the Dipper’s handle intersecting *qian*, stepping to each star while reciting the incantation forty-nine times. Then observe the convergence of the Three Luminaries, inhale their qi, and swallow it with water. Cast the cup, inhale water to spray at the Ghost Gate, shout the command, and strike the cup with the sword—forty-nine times in total. After the incantation, proceed to the second star, repeating this for all seven stars. Upon returning to the Dipper’s mouth, meditate in stillness for a long while, settle the spirit, and bow seven times. Gazing into the Dipper’s mouth, if two stars appear and one is discerned, the register of death will be severed and altered. That night, celestial Perfected Ones, the Three Realms, and ten thousand spirits will all descend to the seat, awaiting the Dipper’s report while lying in repose.

**Dipper-Aligning Talisman**
This talisman is inscribed in cinnabar on seven feet of crimson silk. When aligning with the Dipper, bind it to the back of the head with the talisman facing outward.

**Dipper-Aligning Incantation**
Dwelling in the mundane, petty persons seek the Dao and yearn for the numinous.
Ever beholding your august presence, we pray for long life.
Supreme Jade Emperor, Purple Tenuity Emperor Lord:
The Three Terraces gave me birth, the Three Terraces nurtured me, the Three Terraces protected me.
□□□□□□□.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Moreover, within the incantation, the Great Dipper’s mighty *Kui* governs and oversees all spirits. At its center dwell the exalted sages, the two august stellar lords. Now I align with the Dipper, praying to behold its true form. May the register of death be severed, the roots of evil extirpated. May I ascend through the Five Portals, my name inscribed in Jade Clarity. May decline and illness be cut off, the tomb’s baleful influence severed, sparing both body and soul. In the Northern Capital, sins are erased; in the Southern Bureau, long life is recorded. A hundred demons come to receive their charge; once the task is complete, they report to the Most Exalted. The Great Emperor confers the merit; the Jade Emperor commands its execution. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the statutes and ordinances of the Three Heavens’ Mysterious Capital.

**Visualizing the Spirit and Aligning with the Dipper**
The master says: If a woman or one whose *qi* and blood are weak and feeble cannot stand for long, they should project the spirits of the Two Perfected Ones and visualize their soul aligning with the Dipper. If unable to physically pace the Dipper’s stars, on the twenty-first day of the month at the *hai* hour’s end, enter the oratory, face north, and prepare a mat. Place incense atop the head, and visualize the spirit’s intent following the incense smoke directly toward the Dipper. Envision the Seven Stars gleaming brightly in the Northern Dipper all at once. After a long while, knock the teeth seven times and recite the incantation according to the Dipper’s sequence. Once complete, lie down upon the mat in the oratory. Again visualize the Dipper’s two august stellar lords, their radiance shining brilliantly—this very night, there shall be a wondrous response. If no sign is perceived, wait for the next auspicious day, follow the method to align with the Dipper, and await the response before proceeding. If after seven attempts no sign appears, further alignment is forbidden, for one’s karmic transgressions are too grave to sever or alter the register of death. The adept must cultivate purity and precision, awaiting the numinous response as proof of efficacy. This method is the warp and weft of summoning the numinous, the oral transmission for recitation and practice. It should be performed in seclusion, with the mouth closed.

After aligning with the Dipper for seven days, do not return to the mundane chamber, lest others’ fear disrupt the transformative *qi*. Only after completing the Dipper alignment may one select a day for the **Audience with the Origin**.

**Audience with the Origin**
At the time of the Audience, face east, adjust robes and cap, and sit upright in the oratory. Use a mirror to reflect your form, visualizing your own image. Do this for seven days until the visualized form is as clear and vivid as your reflection. At midnight, envision your form within the Mud Pill; at noon, visualize it residing in the heart; at the *bu* hour, visualize it in the lower *dantian*. After seven days and nights, the distinctions between above and below will be clear. That night, report to the Gate of Heaven and memorialize the Three Heavens’ Jade Emperor, the Eastern and Western *qi*, the Queen Mother of the West, and the Azure Lord. Only then may the Audience with the Origin begin.

The method is as follows: At midnight, the *zi* hour, enter the oratory. Invoke and summon the divine messengers of the Dao, the Ten Heavenly Receivers, the Jade Maidens, the Flying Celestial Heralds, the two officials of the Upper Bureaus, the Direct Envoys of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Attendant Messengers, the Yin-Yang Divine Scribes, the Chariot Officers of the Scarlet Talismans, the Wind-Riding Couriers, the Post-Horse Memorial Officers, the Flying Dragon Riders, the Spirit-Gathering and Spirit-Feeding Officers, the *Qi*-Gathering and *Qi*-Feeding Officers, the Demon-Gathering and Demon-Feeding Officers, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Memorial Scribes, the Lords of the *Jiazi* Cycle, the Jade Script Divine Messengers, the Demon-Discerning Jade Maidens, the Incense-Bearing Jade Maidens, the Heavenly Cavalry, the Celestial *Ding* Warriors, the Central Administrative Immortals, the Duty-Holding Jade Maidens, the Golden Lads, the Dragon-Riding Couriers, the Phoenix Chariots, the Purple Feathered Canopies of Lingzhi, the *Ding* Warriors’ Aides—all arrayed before you, each distinct and clear.

Then, clasp the **Ascension and Wind-Presenting Talisman** in hand, wear the **Jade Clarity Audience with the Origin Talisman** at the waist, and place the **Heaven-Ascending Unification Great Contract** upon the crown of the head. Next, sit upright, press the tongue to the upper palate, and visualize the Three Primordial Officials within the Three *Qi*. Within the Three *Qi* dwell the Perfected Ones, identical to your own form. First, hold the breath for twelve cycles, visualizing the Perfected One within the lower primordial white *qi* ascending into the heart to merge with the Perfected One within the yellow *qi*, becoming one. Then, hold the breath for nine cycles, visualizing the Perfected One within the central yellow-white *qi*, along with the *qi*, ascending into the Mud Pill to merge with the Perfected One within the blue-green *qi*, becoming one. The Perfected One wears a black cap and blue-green robes, adorned with the Five Peaks and Four Waterways.

Next, the left eye emits red *qi*, the right eye emits white *qi*; the two *qi* intertwine, forming a sphere of true *qi* that transforms into a chariot. Before you appears a cinnabar-jade feathered brush, shaped like a great chariot. Hold the breath for twenty-seven cycles, visualizing the Perfected One emerging from the crown of the head to board the chariot. The heart’s form vanishes, as if in a dream. Mounting the purple *qi* and golden light, gradually ascend, accompanied by divine spirits, until reaching the Wind-Presenting Realm. There, behold the Wind-Presenting Officers riding celestial beasts, wielding instruments. The adept draws the Wind-Presenting Talisman before the chariot. After a long while, the Wind-Presenting Chariot’s spirit guides the chariot through the Wind-Presenting Realm, swirling like dense clouds, circling nine times before emerging.

Upon reaching the Stellar Realm, the sun and moon’s yellow path shines like a long rainbow, flanked by jeweled flowers and treasure trees resembling pine and cedar with blue-green leaves, yellow-red blossoms, and crimson fruits. When the wind stirs, they naturally produce the sound of gold and jade. In the distance, jade towers and golden palaces float amidst clouds of treasure—all are the abodes of stellar officials and immortals. At times, immortals’ disciples ride carriages, phoenixes, cranes, or dragons, or mount clouds. The adept must cover their face and yield the path.

After half an hour, the chariot ascends the ten-thousand-mile rainbow road. Amidst faint purple clouds appears the Gate of Heaven, where celestial attendants stand guard—only the divine guardians within the gate are formidable. Opposite the Gate of Heaven lies the realm of the Desire Realm’s Demon King, the Heaven of Desire within the Grand Clarity. Beyond this point, present the Great Contract to the guarding deities, enter the Gate of Heaven, and proceed at will to the Audience.

**Ascension and Wind-Presenting Talisman**
**Three Heavens’ Audience with the Origin Talisman**

A nine-inch green silk talisman inscribed in cinnabar and encased in a yellow pouch is to be worn. **Great Contract for Ascending to Heaven and Uniting with the Dao**

**Dividing the Spirit to Govern Affairs**
The Master says: Once the Audience with the Origin is complete, one learns the celestial bureau and office to which they are assigned. Three days prior, notify the deities under one’s governance, and select a day to divide the spirit and attend to affairs. The etiquette for paying respects is somewhat akin to worldly protocol—submit name tablets and titles in advance. On the appointed day, follow the same rites as the Audience with the Origin, inspecting the divine attendants and their regalia. Place the seal before oneself, along with the contract and bamboo slips. After a long while, the spirits of one’s assigned realm will arrive to escort them. Proceed as before, merging the spirit and departing, naturally riding a chariot to the office to assume duties. Each day after the Audience with the Origin, one must attend to governance. If circumstances prevent attendance, petition the Three Heavens and the governing bureau for leave. Should there be reprimands, the Three Heavens may obstruct, and the bureau spirits will return. If one is yet unable to govern the mysterious bureau, establish a Daoist abode, cultivate in seclusion, and divide the spirit to attend to affairs.

**Establishing a Daoist Abode**
The Master says: Those who receive and practice the Great Daoist Law should revere the secluded chamber where the abode is founded. Establish the celestial bureau at the front and honor the Most High Sage at the rear. This is called a *jing* bureau. Each day after the Audience with the Origin, dismiss the celestial assembly and enter the *jing* to attend to affairs. All governance is conducted within the *jing*. All officials of the Numinous Treasure and Cavernous Mystery belong to the Inner Forbidden Bureau of the Queen Mother of the West’s Primordial Void. Once you hold a celestial rank, petition the Heavenly Mechanism Central Ministry to establish an abode here. Also institute the Offices of Ceremony, Command, and Guard, left and right bureaus. Bestow celestial robes, including a thirty-two-strip azure cloak with black trim, vermilion shoes, and a crown. The *Three Powers Harmonious Crown* uses two layers of five-colored silk, embroidered with the true forms of the Five Peaks. All in the Queen Mother’s palace wear this attire. It may not be used except during the Audience with the Origin or governance. When merits are fulfilled and the spirit is welcomed, ascend to the celestial abode, descend to pay respects to the Youthful Origin, receive the scriptures, and become an immortal official of the Three Realms.

**Deliverance of Ancestral Spirits**
The Master says: Only after mastering the preceding Five Scriptures may one deliver ancestral spirits, entrusting their governance to Nanchang. The methods are contained in the *Numinous Treasure Yellow Register Retreat Rites* and need not be repeated here. If one observes the five abstinences during the Upper Prime and single-mindedly performs deliverance, reciting scriptures and presenting talismans, the merit is profound—no need to await grand retreat merits. If one commits grave transgressions, ancestors may fall into ghostly realms. With merit, they ascend to the Azure Yang Immortal Realm. Reflect carefully on this.

**Selection for Mysterious Promotion**
The Master says: The Way of Mysterious Promotion comprises twenty-four ranks of the Great Dao’s orthodox laws, governed by the Jade Bureau of the Supreme Emperor. These are overseen by the Southern Bureau of the Fire Mansion and the Heavenly Mechanism Inner Ministry. The presiding deities are the Heavenly Emperor of Primordial Illumination, the Left Minister of Pacified Elevation, the Great Lord Jade Infant of the Primordial Void, and the Central Yellow Elder, Master of Teachings. The Supreme Emperor’s Bureau of Promotion issues this edict:

*"The Crimson Radiance of the Primordial Heaven governs the teachings of the Three Realms. I oversee this—who among you has lofty aspirations? Among the myriad beings, only the Central Harmony Bureau, the Sole Office of a Hundred Million, and the Great Lord of the Primordial Void of Mysterious Promotion propagate the teachings, conferring the twenty-four ranks of celestial offices. Without established merit and virtue, one cannot respond to the true."*

The Master says: Though one may possess the qualities for a divine rank, without merit or conduct, their name cannot be recorded on the Cinnabar Terrace. Promotions and demotions are uncertain, rewards and punishments untimely. Yet with a single selection, one may attain the title of Perfected. The Twenty-Four Ranks of the Jade Bureau are as follows:

The Master said: Of the twenty-four ranks of Jade Bureaus above, some have both scriptures and methods descended into the world; some have neither scriptures nor methods descended; some have methods descended but not the scriptures; and some have scriptures descended but not the methods. Yet when observing the Cavern-Heavens and aligning with the Dipper, harmonizing the primordial and dividing the spirits, administering affairs in the immortal offices, or establishing domains to deliver the ancestors of the mysterious lineage, one must select and respond to the mysterious summons, memorialize the Three Heavens, and entreat the descent of the true transmitted scriptures and methods. Only then, having taken charge of a Jade Bureau and received the Heavenly commission to govern its office—achieving great merit surpassing all others—may one ascend to the rank of Perfected.

**The Eight Latitudes of Cultivation and Recitation**
The Master said: The regulations for cultivation and recitation contain eight secret principles of the Latitudes. Should even one be divulged, the rest lose their numinosity. If treated with carelessness, one’s immortal aspirations shall forever be lost.

Should one’s body alone swiftly incur leprosy and sores, the Mysterious Ancestors shall swiftly dispatch the Fire Officials. The adept must seal these principles within the heart, enduring the approach of axe, drill, boiling water, or flame—preferring to tread willingly into them rather than utter a word in careless speech. Though such calamity befalls the body, the Great One, the Five Elders, and the hundred spirits shall instantly transform into luminous clouds to welcome the adept’s spirit into the Upper Clarity.

Should the adept doubt these words and dare to leak them, observe the response of the Upper Mystery: disasters near and far shall strike the one who divulges the Latitudes, annihilating their clan and subjecting them to a hundred generations of wind and blade—all to be witnessed in an instant.

**First: The Latitude of the Jeweled Pearl’s Mysterious Transformation**
The Master said: What is the Latitude of the Jeweled Pearl’s Mysterious Transformation? It is the Great One containing blossoms, the Jade Dew congealing into pearls. When the adept visualizes and recites this, ascension to Perfection is achieved before ten thousand repetitions. Within the heart dwells the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; within the dewdrop appears one’s own form, like a blossom cradling dew.

**Second: The Latitude of the Lion’s Majestic Spirit**
The Master said: The Latitude of the Lion’s Majestic Spirit is the Solar Controller of Destiny transforming and giving life, descending and then ascending. When the adept visualizes and recites this ten thousand times, they shall ride clouds and mount dragons, ascending to the Great Void in broad daylight. Atop the head dwells the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; within the heart stands the lion, and the adept, riding the lion, takes its place within the heart, descending into the Five-Colored Cinnabar Field.

**Third: The Latitude of the Wondrous Chariot of the Upper Palace**
The Master said: The Latitude of the Wondrous Chariot of the Upper Palace is the division of the Emperor’s Palace into the Three Origins, where merit is perfected. When the adept visualizes and recites this ten thousand times, the entire body ascends as an immortal. Within the Nine Palaces of the head, the Upper Four Palaces and Lower Five Palaces contain one’s own form in the second palace of the Upper Four. After four thousand repetitions, merit is fulfilled.

**Fourth: The Latitude of Central Prohibition and Realization of Perfection**
The Master said: The Latitude of Central Prohibition and Realization of Perfection is sitting within the Cinnabar Terrace, where the Central Prohibition perfects the Realized One—sixty accumulated merits equaling those of the Nine Perfected. Within the heart’s Cinnabar Chamber dwells one’s own form. Recite this three thousand times.

**Fifth: The Latitude of the Lower Origin’s Initial Study**
The Master said: The Latitude of the Lower Origin’s Initial Study is the secret resolve within the Cinnabar Valley, where the spirit is preserved, and the three thousand deeds are recorded in the Jade Perfected’s register. Within the Lower Cinnabar Valley dwells one’s own form. Recite this three thousand times.

**Sixth: The Latitude of Instantaneous Response and Divine Penetration**
The Master said: The Latitude of Instantaneous Response and Divine Penetration is the Three Qi generating the Three, uniting above with the Three Heavens, crafting the adept’s body to divide into forms across the Ten Heavens—equal in stature to the Great Marshal, with natural dignity and bearing, seated upon a lion amidst the empty mystery of the Solar Radiance Jeweled Pearl. The Five-Zhang Ancestral Origin encircles tenfold, responding with wondrous transformations. Within the Three Qi dwell the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions; the Primordial One sits upon the lion within the sun, five zhang above the earth.

**Seventh: The Latitude of the Jade Tone and Myriad Spirits**
Internally ingest and externally recite the twenty-two tones. Visualize the Jade Worthy and the Nine Sovereign Lords of Mud, recite the Jade Chapters, and bow in reverence to the Primordial Lord. After ten thousand repetitions, no merit shall remain unfulfilled. Across the Four Directions and Thirty-Two Heavens, within the Mud-Pill Palace dwells the Primordial Heavenly Worthy; within the heart appears one’s own form, offering homage.

**Eighth: The Latitude of the Three Realms’ Summoning of Spirits**
The Master said: The Latitude of the Three Realms’ Summoning of Spirits is the Three Realms and Three Origins—after a hundred thousand repetitions, the Three Realms may be delivered, and the immortal unites with the cloud chariot.
- **Upper Realm**: Upon the Azure Cloud Qi, within the Upper Cinnabar Field, one’s own form appears. Five thousand repetitions for the Upper Origin.
- **Middle Realm**: Within the Yellow Cloud of the Celestial Valley Qi, in the Middle Cinnabar Field, one’s own form appears. One thousand repetitions for the Middle Origin.
- **Lower Realm**: Within the White Cloud of the Spirit Valley Qi, in the Lower Cinnabar Field, one’s own form appears. One hundred repetitions for the Lower Origin.

The Master said: The true statutes of the Eight Latitudes grant ascension to immortality upon mastering even one Latitude—provided it is wielded as effortlessly as a palm directing fingers. Yet to leak even one Latitude is to dash all hopes of flight, sinking instead into the abyss of the non-Dao. The adept must thoroughly comprehend and investigate these principles, refraining from reckless discussion or disclosure. Practice diligently, and the Perfected of the Three Heavens shall await your ascension.

*Here ends Scroll Three of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Upper Clarity.
Scroll Four of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Upper Clarity.*

The Venerable Master of Subtle Illumination, the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering, Ning Quanzhen, transmitted this to the Disciples of the Three Caverns of the Upper Clarity who receive the teachings of the Numinous Treasure, the Lineage Master Wang Qizhen, compiler.

**The Ten Mysteries of Cultivation and Application**

The Master said: The Ten Mysteries are what are called the Ten Profound Essentials.

1. **Supreme Samādhi of Spirit Radiance**
2. **The Millet Pearl Entering the Wondrous**
3. **The Central Regulation of the Five Qi**
4. **The Ten Revolutions Returning the Spirit**

These four mysteries each possess the hymns and taboo names of the host of Perfected Ones.

5. **Exhaling and Inhaling the True Qi**
6. **The Hidden Taboo of the Mysterious Perfected**, wherein the primordial qi binds the embryo palace of refinement. The measured breaths of inches and spans have already been expounded in the *Illustrated Principles*.

7. **The Embryo’s Transformation of Corporeal Form**, clarifying the firing times of the Cavernous Yang and the great reckoning of the Celestial Cycle, refining the jade script within to generate and transform the embryonic immortal.

8. **The Primal Spirit’s Supernatural Penetration**, responding to and manifesting merit and power.

9. **Yin Elixir and Yang Elixir**, the flowing essence and jade radiance. These already possess established methods.

10. **The Great Practice of Brahmā Qi**, which is one’s own primordial qi.

To fathom these profound mysteries is to attain limitless ascension; to comprehend their principles is to find the origin of spirit immortality.

**The Supreme Samādhi of Spirit Radiance**

The Scripture states: For seven days and seven nights, the sun, moon, and stars of all heavens, the jade armillary and jade balance, simultaneously halt their revolutions. The spirit winds fall silent, mountains and seas conceal their clouds, the sky is free of drifting veils, the four qi shine brightly and clearly. The lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees of the realm are leveled as one, no longer possessing high or low, and the earth transforms entirely into azure jade, without any other color. The host of Perfected Ones attend in assembly, while the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning floats suspended in the void above a five-colored lion.

The Master said: This describes the wondrous application and supernatural penetration of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, the workings of his transformative mechanism and responsive resonance. Though it speaks of seven days and seven nights during which the sun, moon, and stars halt their revolutions, how then is day distinguished from night? The reckoning of seven days and seven nights is not limited to this alone. In the Jade Clarity, there is the Floating Black Soil, and there are transformations of such awe-inspiring divine efficacy as those spoken of by the Dao Lord of the myriad heavens. In that instant of response, the ten thousand heavens of the Three Realms and all directions are likewise affected. This subtle and wondrous sagely response is the external transformation of the Celestial Venerable. The sun and moon do not move, the stars do not revolve, the jade armillary and jade balance halt their revolutions, and day and night are no longer manifest. Yet in truth, the inner workings of his sovereign function have never ceased for even a moment. Thus, the seven days and seven nights of the Luminous Dawn are not the same as the seven days and seven nights spoken of in the Jade Capital’s scriptural teachings, nor are they comparable to the seven days and seven nights of the human world. To speak of one realm is to encompass all heavens and all lands; thus, it is said to be the land of one realm. When leveled as one, it universally unites the ten thousand transformations, and the divine transformation extends everywhere without exception. Thus, it is said there is no longer high or low.

From the inner perspective: the sun and moon of the heavens do not blink, the stars do not circulate their qi, the jade armillary and jade balance do not cease their revolutions, the spirit winds are silent without exhalation or inhalation, the mountains and seas conceal their clouds without the morning exchange of yin and yang, the sky is free of drifting veils without inner or outer obstruction, the four qi shine clearly and brightly, and inner and outer, above and below are as one. The land of one realm is like one’s own body; the mountains, rivers, forests, and trees are like the four limbs, the hundred vessels, the hair and pores, the nine orifices, the skin and flesh, the constructive and defensive qi, the spirit chamber, and the bones and joints. The earth transforming entirely into azure jade is entry into the realm of Daoist samādhi.

The Master said: From the inner perspective, this is the Supreme Samādhi of Spirit Radiance, wherein one lucidly perceives the Jade Clarity realm. With the merit of seven days and seven nights—seven days and seven nights—the sun and moon halt their revolutions, the two eyes do not blink, neither closed in darkness nor inwardly directed, nor gazing outward. For seven days and seven nights, one sustains prolonged vision, halting the blinking of the eyes, illuminating the three regions, and penetrating inner and outer with clarity. The qi of one’s body circulates at dawn through the hundred joints and meridians, the yin and yang, the constructive and defensive qi, all connected to the breath and vessels of the three regions. These breath vessels are the jade armillary and jade balance of one’s own body. The four extremities correspond to the jade armillary, and the three regions respond to the jade balance. When the jade armillary does not revolve, the sun and moon pause in their course, and the stars halt their revolutions. When the four extremities do not reach, the three regions do not breathe, and the qi and blood of the entire body cease their circulation.

First, one must achieve the silence of the spirit winds, without the sound of exhalation or inhalation, and the concealment of mountains in clouds, without the obscuring realm of deluded thoughts. In clarity and stillness, the sky is free of drifting veils, and naturally, the four qi—warmth, coolness, cold, and heat—shine brightly and clearly, all things sharing a single hue. Moreover, the inner and outer of one’s body are like azure jade, without a speck of dust. Gradually, the hundred Perfected guard the Gate of Death, and the ten thousand Perfected attend one’s corporeal form, enabling the body to ascend into the void. After a hundred days, the spirit merges with the wondrous Dao; after a thousand days, one ascends in broad daylight.

The Celestial Venerable floating in the void is one’s own spirit residing in the Jade Clarity Palace, also called the Palace of the Jade Emperor. The Scripture states: "One’s own body possesses the Celestial Venerable; why gaze upward to the heavens?" The *Hymn of the Primordial Perfected* also says: "Though the Celestial Venerable is distant and wondrous, he descends near to the Mud Pill Palace." The palaces and chambers are all adorned with the seven treasures, naturally distinguishing their forms.

The five qi ascend to the Crimson Palace, and through the wondrous transformation of numinous power, they coalesce to form a lion. The Celestial Venerable sits upon it, descending into the Cinnabar Field. To the left is blue-green, to the right is white, in front is red, behind is black, and in the center is yellow—hence the designation of five colors. The mysterious seat floats in the void, responding to transformations of being and non-being, truth and resonance.

For seven days and seven nights, one lucidly perceives the Celestial Venerable of the Jade Clarity. At this time, the Supreme Samādhi of Spirit Radiance ascends to the utmost wondrous, and with merit complete and encounter perfected, one may immediately rise lightly into the air through the power of effort. Within samādhi, one undergoes demonic trials—water, fire, blades, weapons, royal laws, and ten thousand kinds—all reporting even the slightest infraction, yet none can grasp the principle of the Dao. Beyond the seven days and seven nights, what one sees pertains to future events. Should one speak of it, all prior merit is lost, and the hope of immortality vanishes. How could one not guard one’s words?

The Perfected of the Great Unity hymned:
*In the murky depths, without intent,*
*The Great Abyss conceals its form.*

Amidst the azure vastness, all merges as one—existence congeals into spirit. Light as a swan’s feather, unmoved, within and without hold fast to purity. The tortoise devours the crimson serpent, knitting the essence of true radiance. Sun and moon grow dim, the jade pivot does not rise. White rainbows and azure mists intertwine, weaving back and forth.

After seven days, through spiritual potency, one beholds the Jade Clarity of one’s own accord.

One inhalation, one exhalation—three inches, four arrivals, together making six inches and one arrival, totaling fifteen parts. They weave heaven and earth, spanning fifteen in length and breadth. Thus the Supreme Lord entrusted this to the Yellow Emperor as the River Chart’s numbers.

With each inhalation, the pulse stirs twice; with each exhalation, the pulse stirs twice. When breath settles into stillness, the pulse stirs five times, and with a great sigh, six inches move once. One inch per breath, the pulse traverses six inches.

The method of the Great Samādhi of Spirit Radiance begins with settling the heart. The heart is the dwelling of the hundred spirits, the palace of the five senses. When the heart’s sovereign is profoundly still, then sounds, sights, wealth, and profit cannot disturb it. By this, the Dao is not far off.

Though many in this age admire the Dao, few truly attain it. Though their initial resolve may be earnest, those who grow lax do so because their hearts are not settled. The method of settling the heart lies in severing the Three Corpses, expelling the Six Bandits, commanding demons to eradicate the roots of harm to the Dao, and stilling qi to achieve the wondrous entry into spirit.

Stillness brings samādhi; samādhi brings response. Spirit radiance wells forth within, sun and moon shine with clarity. One qi abides constantly, the ten thousand spirits do not scatter. Lucidly, one beholds the realm of the Jade Clarity.

The method states: The adept severs thought, clarifies the heart, and concentrates the spirit upon the Dao. Circulating the crimson qi of the Crimson Palace, it descends to the Mysterious Spring, ascends to the heart’s blood, and the two qi of kidney essence intermingle. Released into the Cinnabar Field, they gestate and give birth to an infant, which gradually grows into the form of a true person.

Next, circulating the azure qi from the liver like clouds, it descends to shroud the true person, who is clad in azure robes, an azure jade crown, and an azure jade tablet, their countenance joyful and harmonious.

Then, from the Fire Pool of the heart, a fire dragon leaps forth, bearing the true person aloft on five-colored clouds of qi. Ascending the Great Bridge of the Spine, it rises straight to the Mud Pill, merging with the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning as one body. The golden towers and jade halls, the dharma throne and jeweled canopies—all are perfectly arrayed.

In an instant, the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning enacts the Dao of generation: from the One comes the Two, from the Two comes the Three. From this, a hundred treasures radiate forth, giving birth to the myriad heavens, the jade maidens, and the lords of the palaces, all standing in solemn array.

The Celestial Venerable enters stillness, then emits a single beam of precious light, illuminating the Northern Yin. All is transformed into a hue of azure jade, from above to below, the light shining with perfect clarity.

The Celestial Venerable commands the flying celestial officials, the celestial lictors, and the mighty celestial warriors. Bearing golden jade tablets and golden script with decrees, they proceed directly to the Twelve River Sources of the Northern Feng. There, they purge filth and impurity, beseech the extinction of the Three Evils, and sever the earth’s roots.

From Kun to Gen, from Gen to Kun, from Chen to Xu—marking Xu, Hai, Zi, and Dui, then Zhong and Zhen, Mao. Visualize the liver emitting a single strand of azure qi, sweeping away all roots and enabling the flight past the Five Corpses. Then mark Shen, You, Yin, Si, and Hai.

Following the mudra, summon the spirit officials to open the Five Gates, purifying desire, lust, love, and greed.

The Celestial Venerable visualizes the entire body suffused with radiant brilliance, as in the realm of Crimson Clarity. Again, the Celestial Venerable commands the demon kings, celestial lictors, mighty celestial warriors, and flying celestial kings to descend directly to the Northern Feng and call forth the names of the Three Corpses. Three figures emerge, and the Great God of Cast Fire hurls flames into the blazing cavern, incinerating them until all is pure and clear.

Next, call forth the names of the Seven Po. Seven figures in white emerge from the lungs. Then call forth the names of the Three Hun. Three figures in azure emerge from the liver. Together, they enter the Fire Pool for refinement, transforming into infants with luminous jade bodies, their forms adorned with crimson patterns and net-like tracery, each stationed in their respective palace.

The Celestial Venerable then descends to dwell in the realm of Crimson Clarity, sitting in perfect stillness. The lords of the palaces disperse with the light, leaving nothing behind. The body shines with utter clarity; inner thoughts do not stray outward, nor do outer thoughts intrude. This is the true realm of the Dao.

Guard and practice this, and the Dao of the Great Samādhi of Spirit Radiance may be attained.

Each day at dawn, the adept sits in stillness and silence, settling the heart with utmost reverence, free from inner or outer distractions. First, purify body and speech, then visualize as described above.

Next, knock the teeth thirty-six times, stirring the Flower Pool to irrigate the Five Sprouts. Generate a mouthful of numinous fluid and swallow it into the Abyss of Primordial Origin.

With the left hand, form the mudra of the Twelve Branches, flying the Zi-Wu Dipper to ascend to the Mud Pill. With the right hand, form the mudra of the Twelve Branches’ eyes, flying the Zi-Wu Dipper through the Cavern of the Cinnabar Qi Pillow. Raise the head, eyes fixed upward toward the sun and moon, directly drawing in the qi of the Great Yang and swallowing it into the Crimson Palace.

Maintain even qi without ascent or descent, gaze fixed without blinking. The suns and moons of the myriad heavens halt their movement. Within the primordial qi of the chaotic center, named the Constellations, qi ceases its circulation.

Cross the ten fingers over the heart, circulating the pulse without cease. Press the tongue to the upper palate, close the teeth, and generate saliva. Spirit and wind grow silent.

Swallow the qi, descending it to the Cinnabar Field, where mountains and seas store clouds. Close the eyes, disregarding outer thoughts. Within and without, nothing exists; the heavens are free of floating haze.

Circulate the qi once more, pervading the four limbs, within and without, above and below as one. Four qi grow bright and clear.

Sit upright, the body unmoving, like the land of a kingdom. With the entire body, stir and circulate the joints, within and without, above and below. Banish all stray thoughts—mountains, rivers, forests, and trees—all level as one, without height or depth.

Sit evenly, the heart directed in devotion. Visualize the form of one’s body and its earth transformed entirely into azure jade. This is the realm of samādhi in the Dao.

When the circulation is complete, lie down to rest and descend from the seat.

*The Diagram of the Great Samādhi of Spirit Radiance*
A person sits upright within a circular radiance, the body enveloped in five-colored light.

The Oral Instructions state:
Align the ears with the shoulders, the nose with the navel. Gather the six senses, concentrate the spirit in the eyes. Neither external nor internal—observe the radiance of the spirit.
After three days, within the secluded chamber, a single point of spirit-light appears. Diligently stabilize the spirit.
After four days, it gradually brightens and expands, filling the chamber with spirit-light. Within this samādhi, all things become as if non-existent.
After seven days, all true spirits and ghostly beings are seen, entering the Dao of penetrating vision.
With forty-five days of guest and host in full vigor, each governs its portion.

To practice the Dao of penetrating vision, one must uphold the two grades of precepts and conduct.
After three years of great samādhi, facing the Three Pure Ones, the Heavenly Worthy bestows a celestial writ. Ascending in broad daylight, one is appointed a Heavenly Perfected.
Without upholding virtue and precepts, wisdom does not arise, and the path of the Great Vehicle remains inaccessible.
Those of wondrous ability, in perfect union with the utmost subtlety, ascend into Jade Clarity.

This Dao does not distinguish between delivering beings, aiding the living, or subduing evil. For morning and evening practice, preserving the body and guarding life, dispelling calamities and chronic afflictions—this Dao must be cultivated.
Only at the hours of dawn and midnight, when the spirit is clear and the qi fresh, when the myriad spirits gather as one, and the obscure and manifest become thoroughly illuminated—only then may this practice be undertaken. This is the wondrous workings of the body’s diurnal and nocturnal transformations, transmitted from the lineage master to the Mystic Master, the August Personage, passed down orally to deliver beings.

Should one fail to sit in accord, one’s celestial rank is forfeited in vain. The celestial and terrestrial bureaus will bear no record of one’s immortal register.

The Scripture states:
When the ten recitations are complete, the Great Perfected of the Ten Directions and the boundless Heavenly Realized Ones assemble as one. The men and women of a kingdom turn their hearts in reverence, coming forth like fine rain or dense mist—so numerous they cannot be counted. Half the land of the kingdom sinks beneath their weight, beyond all restraint.

Thereupon, the Primordial Beginning suspends a precious pearl, large as a millet grain, in the void five measures above the earth. The Primordial Beginning leads the Great Perfected, the Heavenly Realized Ones, the exalted sages, the Perfected of wondrous conduct, and the innumerable hosts—all enter into the precious pearl. Gazing upward, the heavenly beings see only a shimmering radiance entering through the pearl’s opening. Once within, they know not where they are.

The people of the kingdom disperse, and the land returns to levelness, no longer slanted or sunken.

The Master explains:
When the recitation of the scripture is complete after ten cycles, the boundless Great Perfected of the Ten Directions and the Heavenly Realized Ones arrive as one, summoning the protective power of the Ten Grades of Wisdom. The scripture’s blessings manifest as auspicious responses, and the entire kingdom is shielded and delivered, all attaining longevity. Thus, they turn their hearts in reverence, the whole kingdom coming forth.

The recitation of the scripture is said to be like fine rain or dense mist—its number beyond reckoning. The "innumerable hosts" refers to the myriad heavens, where a single kingdom gathers in the Great Floating Black Soil. The land cannot bear the weight. The scripture’s power and virtue, along with the vast multitude, cause the earth to narrow and sink. Though half the kingdom is already pressed down, the influx cannot be halted.

Thus, the Heavenly Venerable enacts the wondrous and great transformation, suspending a single treasure-pearl, vast as a millet grain, within the boundless void—its tethering strand beyond all reckoning. Five *zhang* above the earth, it floats beyond the realm of turbid hues. It draws forth the Heavenly Perfected of the Great Upper Origin, the Nine Grades of Perfected Beings; the lofty and revered Sagely Worthies of the Middle Origin, the Nine Grades of Sages; and the Wondrous-Practiced Realized Ones of the Lower Origin, the Nine Grades of Immortals. A thousand chariots and ten thousand riders follow the Heavenly Venerable’s ascent, all entering together into the treasure-pearl.

All celestial beings who are not Heavenly Perfected, Sagely Worthies, or Realized Ones cannot follow the mechanism of effortless transformation and thus cannot enter the marvel of the suspended millet-pearl, able only to gaze upward in reverence. They see them surge forth and enter through the pearl’s mouth, yet know not where they go.

Consider how even lesser immortals of lower rank possess the marvel of mustard-seed containing Mount Sumeru, or the realm of heaven and earth suspended within a gourd. How much more, then, does the Great Sagely Heavenly Venerable, in unfolding and proclaiming the great teaching, manifest divine transformations!

The treasure-pearl, vast as a millet grain, is already subtle and wondrous. Yet, suspended five *zhang* above the earth within the boundless void, even heavenly spirits lack the luminous wisdom to perceive it. How much more so for those who witness its mouth—truly, it is the Heavenly Venerable drawing forth the Sagely Perfected into the wondrous realm of being and non-being.

At the moment they follow the Heavenly Venerable into the treasure-pearl, the celestial beings gazing upward see its mouth. Once all have entered, the celestial beings can no longer perceive the interior of the pearl or its wondrous transformations. Thus, the people of the kingdom disperse, and the earth returns to levelness, no longer slanted or sunken.

This is the realm of scripture-recitation at that time—the marvel of the Heavenly Venerable’s treasure-pearl. Speaking in terms of the Great Dao, the divine power of the Dao is vast beyond all containment, subtle beyond all entry. When gathered, it transforms into the boundless multitudes, all attaining the marvel of a mustard seed or a hair’s tip. Such is its gathering. When dispersed, it arises from non-being, pervading the myriad heavens and kingdoms, multiplying into countless forms, omnipresent and all-pervading. Such is its dispersal.

Suspended five *zhang* above the earth, it transcends the five desires, five dusts, five aggregates, five hues, five fragrances, five sounds, and five turbidities, existing beyond the reckoning of the five phases. Thus, it enters the marvel of the void-suspended.

The millet grain is the chief of the five grains. The kingdom is likened to a single body. The slanting and sinking signify the Dao’s partiality and constraint, its oneness not yet complete, thus unable to embody the wondrous transformation of the profound and mysterious.

The celestial beings are the myriad spirits; the Sagely Worthies, Heavenly Perfected, and Wondrous-Practiced Realized Ones are the spirits of the Three Origins. The Heavenly Venerable is the master of the body.

Speaking of the wondrous inner realm of the Dao, this is the secret of the Jade Clarity treasure-pearl’s divine transformation and the embryo-immortal. Speaking in terms of the great method, it is the practice of grain-refusal to cure illness. Speaking in terms of recitation and cultivation, it is the ritual of numinous and wondrous transformation, the means of dispelling calamity and summoning fortune.

The Master says: After nine revolutions and ten recitations, the workings of merit are complete, and one attains the marvel of entering non-being from being, the wondrousness of the void-suspended millet-pearl. First, the yang essence is summoned; then, the yin radiance is called forth. Like fine rain or dense mist, they enter the body. The primordial *qi* of the ancestral origin is fully replete, and the tenfold divine transformations revolve. The primordial *qi* of the original valley returns as one, and all *qi* follow in unison, transforming into the mysterious cinnabar of the millet-pearl, which settles within the numinous palace of the Yellow Court. The elixir completed, it pierces the sun; partaking of it, one instantly mounts the cloud-chariot, ascending to Jade Clarity to take the rank of Realized One.

The *Taixuan* Realized One intones:
*Divine gaze like heaven, in resonance with the Great Mystery.*
*Three days of yang unite; seven dawns complete the yin.*
*Thirteen in the Kun position; eighteen revolve Qian.*
*New moon and crescent bear the talisman; eight eights form the arc.*
*On the twenty-third night, yin and yang merge at their origin.*
*This is called the Constant Dao, the meeting of the Three Fields.*
*If a single speck is stained, the unbroken continuity is lost.*

*The Diagram of the Millet-Pearl Entering the Marvelous*
*The Diagram of the Heavenly Venerable’s Wondrous Transformation*

Within the center, the Five Qi are ordered.

The Scripture states:
*Primal Cavern, Jade Calendar—*
*Dragon Han extends its prosperity.*
*Boundless kalpas drift in primordial chaos,*
*Above, no returning hues; below, no returning abyss.*
*Wind and marsh pervade the void;*
*Vajra rides the heavens.*
*From heaven above to heaven below,*
*No darkness, no obscurity,*
*No form, no shadow,*
*No limit, no end.*
*The vast Brahmanic expanse, vast and lightless,*
*Scarlet radiance unfurls the chart—*
*Celestial revolutions move of themselves.*
*The Primal Beginning settles and stabilizes,*
*Unfolding the Five Scriptures.*
*Scarlet script on jade, eight mighty dragon glyphs*
*Preserve and regulate the kalpic cycles,*
*Ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.*

The Brahmanic qi spreads and fills the cosmos;
Myriad patterns unfold.
The Primal Net flows and evolves,
Thirty-two heavens in ceaseless revolution,
Colorless wheels turning through the ten directions.
The Dipper revolves, the Winnowing Basket traces,
Circling back through the Five Constants.
Thirty-five divisions gather the qi of the Upper Origin.
Eight luminous scenes merge in darkness;
Qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries.
Within the Mystery, the Great August One,
The Highest Perfected of the Celestial Emperor.
Floating upon the radiance of the Great Rosy Clouds,
They chant and intone the Cavernous Chapters.
Golden perfection shines resplendent,
Its echoes flowing through the cloudy encampments.
Jade tones gather qi;
Spiritual winds amass mist.
The Purple Void flourishes in elegance,
Assisting and sheltering the myriad immortals.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—
Naturally, they attain perfection.
Within the perfected dwells the spirit,
The Great Lord of Longevity.
The Lordless Lad,
The White Prime Honored Spirit,
The Great One Who Oversees Destiny,
Peach and Health united in extension.
Grasping talismans, holding registers,
They safeguard life and root its essence.
Ascending to the Upper Clarity,
They enter and exit the Flowery Chamber.
Within the Eight Obscurities,
In the subtlest of subtleties,
They descend to guard the human body,
The Mud-Pill Palace and the Crimson Palace.
Within the center, the Five Qi are ordered,
Merging and uniting the hundred spirits.

The Master says:
*This is the Heavenly Worthy’s discourse on the origins of the Dao’s creation and the cosmos’s unfolding—the beginning of the Five Kalpas’ generation.*

The Scripture states:
*From heaven above to heaven below,*
*No darkness, no obscurity,*
*No form, no shadow,*
*No limit, no end.*
*The vast Brahmanic expanse, vast and lightless.*

The Master says:
*This clarifies the fundamental nature of the Great Dao’s origin and end.*

The Scripture states:
*Scarlet radiance unfurls the chart—*
*Celestial revolutions move of themselves.*
*The Primal Beginning settles and stabilizes,*
*Unfolding the Five Scriptures.*
*Scarlet script on jade, eight mighty dragon glyphs*
*Preserve and regulate the kalpic cycles,*
*Ensuring heaven’s eternal endurance.*

The Master says:
*After the Heavenly Worthy’s Five Kalpas of secluded transformation, the fire of the Cavernous Yang is smelted to forge the scriptures. The kalpa is named Scarlet Radiance. Settling and stabilizing the Five Directions, it ensures heaven’s eternal endurance. This is the Dao by which the Five Thearchs nurture beings, entrusted to the Five Elders and the various perfected—it is the Middle-Grade Dao.*

The Scripture states:
*Myriad patterns unfold;*
*The Primal Net flows and evolves.*
*Thirty-two heavens in ceaseless revolution,*
*Colorless wheels turning through the ten directions.*
*The Dipper revolves, the Winnowing Basket traces,*
*Circling back through the Five Constants.*
*Thirty-five divisions gather the qi of the Upper Origin.*

The Master says:
*After the kalpa unfolds, only the patterns of the myriad dharmas are established. Their transformative functions converge in the Upper Origin.*

The Scripture states:
*Eight luminous scenes merge in darkness;*
*Qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries.*
*Within the Mystery, the Great August One,*
*The Highest Perfected of the Celestial Emperor.*
*Floating upon the radiance of the Great Rosy Clouds,*
*They chant and intone the Cavernous Chapters.*
*Golden perfection shines resplendent,*
*Its echoes flowing through the cloudy encampments.*
*Jade tones gather qi;*
*Spiritual winds amass mist.*
*The Purple Void flourishes in elegance,*
*Assisting and sheltering the myriad immortals.*

The Master says:
*The preceding clarifies the fundamental nature of the cosmos’s Great Dao; next is expounded the Dao of the inner landscape of the human body. The Eight Luminous Scenes and the Three Sections’ Twenty-Four Spirits are the chiefs of the myriad immortals, the lords of the host of spirits. The Great August One within the Mystery is the Queen Mother of the West of the Primordial Origin. This is the Great Cavern’s Mystery within Mystery, the subtlety within subtlety—the supreme of the supreme Dao. Those who understand become divine immortals; cultivating it, they attain the rank of Highest Perfected.*

The Scripture states:
*A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—*
*Naturally, they attain perfection.*
*Within the perfected dwells the spirit,*
*The Great Lord of Longevity.*
*The Lordless Lad,*
*The White Prime Honored Spirit,*
*The Great One Who Oversees Destiny,*
*Peach and Health united in extension.*
*Grasping talismans, holding registers,*
*They safeguard life and root its essence,*
*Ascending to the Upper Clarity.*

The Master says:
*This is precisely the Dao of the Five Spirits merging within the Great Cavern’s myriad transformations—entrusted to the Jade Dawn’s Upper-Grade practitioners.*

The Scripture states:
*They enter and exit the Flowery Chamber,*
*Within the Eight Obscurities,*
*In the subtlest of subtleties.*
*Descending to guard the human body,*
*The Mud-Pill Palace and the Crimson Palace.*
*Within the center, the Five Qi are ordered,*
*Merging and uniting the hundred spirits.*

The Master says:
*The Great One embraces the flower like a lotus. The Eight Obscurities and the subtlest of subtleties compare to the warp and weft of the Five Qi. All arise from the Three Offices merging the hundred spirits, presiding over the Five Spirits’ transformations.*

The Oral Transmission states:
*This is the first of these two chapters—the treasure within the numinous, the Upper-Grade Dao. As the Jade Dawn Dao Lord has said: "Receiving the Primal Beginning’s boundless deliverance of beings, this is the Upper-Grade Dao."*
*Creation and transformation are not external to the body; their root is likened to the Three Heavens. The Thirty-Nine August Emperors of the Highest Sovereign, the Supreme Perfected of the Nine Empyreans, the myriad emperors of the cosmos, the limitless Highest Perfected—all revere and pay homage, attending within the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Golden Portal’s Seven-Treasure Jeweled Terrace. Spirit consorts attend with incense; perfected ones keep watch. Once every forty thousand kalpas, it is transmitted. To recklessly divulge this Dao is to be stricken from the Jade Clarity’s register; nine generations of ancestors will sink into the prison of fiery torment, the body enduring forever the trials of the wind-blade. For endless kalpas, there will be no redemption; for seven dark lineages, there will be the retribution of leprosy and insect afflictions. Unless one has already attained the rank of Perfected, there is no precept by which it may be transmitted. To mistakenly reveal a single word is to incur eternal suffering. Unless taught by a sage of the Supreme Mystery, how could a minor immortal of the Celestial Perfected ever come to understand it?*

The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct intones:
*One qi pays homage, entering the Eight Obscurities.*
*Heaven’s gate and earth’s portal—*
*Opening and closing, blocking and flowing.*
*Life’s root lies in the Great Tenuity,*
*The luminous beam of the ancestral qi.*
*Heaven enters to act as yang;*
*Heaven opens in yin.*
*Earth leaks to become the perfected;*
*Receiving and expelling, right and wrong.*
*Water and fire arrive together;*
*The hundred spirits turn eastward.*
*Returning to the Valley Chamber,*
*Reckless divulgence brings collapse.*

*The Diagram of the Great One Embracing the Flower*
*The Eight Meridians of the Heart Envelope, ascending to connect with the Nine Hues, internally containing the Five Colors. The Great One embraces the flower like a white lotus, branching to connect with the Nine Cauldrons’ tranquility.*

*The Diagram of the Five Spirits Merging*
*Ten Revolutions Returning the Numinous*

The Scripture states:
*Ten Revolutions Returning the Numinous—*
*The myriad qi ascend as immortals.*

The Master said: The Way of Ten Revolutions is the Way of the Five Phases’ generation and completion. The method of Ten Revolutions is that of the Heavenly Worthy’s tenfold recitation of the scripture—its divine transformations embody this principle.

The Scripture states: *All perfected beings attend the assembly.*
The Master said: When the true ones of the body gather, this saying may be discussed.

The Scripture states: *When the Primordial Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture once, all the great sages of the heavens simultaneously praised its goodness. At that time, all the deaf and ailing in the land had their ears opened and regained hearing.*
The Master said: When the true ones gather in constant goodness, the Water number generates the One, and all under heaven receive its grace. Water ascends to the imperial court, flowing through mountains and valleys, bathing the kidneys to augment wisdom, opening deaf ears, and restoring hearing to the ailing. Yet when the Supreme Way speaks of it, the deluded do not understand. Those with true illness beyond sound do not hear; even the fire of silent clarity is called deafness. Only by obtaining the true One of Water, letting wisdom flow and ascend to wisdom, do the ears open and hear together.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited twice, the blind regained their sight.*
The Master said: The eyes are the masters of the body’s luminosity, the root of the sun and moon’s essence. They are the windows for seeking the true and the numinous source for perceiving the Way. In the *Supreme Way’s Forbidden Scripture*, the sun and moon are foremost—light is fire. The central pupil is the origin of Mars, the sun and moon dividing their radiance. Fire’s generating number is two; the true Water of Heaven One bathes and generates the root of the primordial beginning. The Supreme Mystery’s true fire soars and flies within the heart, thus restoring light and returning brightness, connecting with the three luminaries’ splendor—this is how the blind regain their sight. Moreover, the root of generation and transformation is the *jia*; when the two kidneys’ *xu* and *hai* elements split open, Water ascends to the origin, the three pupils congeal above, the heart generates fire-vision, the three lights merge, and the two pupils govern the eyes’ light—this is called *xuyuan*. Even color-blindness in the Supreme Way follows this pattern.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited three times, the mute could speak.*
The Master said: This is the generating number of Wood. Speaking in terms of the Supreme Way, things generate the Five Phases, and one color contains five hues; yin and yang mutually reverse and conceal their functions. As for the mute, in ordinary terms, the lungs govern sound. According to the Five Constants, speech is born of Metal, and Metal governs voice. Thus, when the Heavenly Worthy recites three times, the divine transformation of Wood’s generating number resides in the West. The true body of Metal, summoned by Wood, reverses and transforms divinely—this is how the mute can speak.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited four times, the lame, the paralyzed, and those with chronic accumulations all rose and walked.*
The Master said: This is the generating number of Metal. The lame and paralyzed suffer from hemiplegia, withered muscles and blood, and contracted limbs—these are the afflictions of paralysis, lameness, and stiffness. Chronic accumulations refer to long-standing, incurable illnesses passed down through generations. These are precisely conditions where sinews and vessels are stiff, blood networks obstructed, and flow impeded—all belonging to the Wood vessel’s liver qi and the utmost of the network vessels, corresponding to the number four. Is this not what the divine immortals call the method of reversing the Five Phases’ generation and completion? Speaking in terms of the Supreme Way, the illnesses of the Dharma-body thrive when Metal and Wood interact, but perish when Metal and Wood are properly employed. Just as Water and Fire mutually depend, Metal and Wood mutually cherish—thus, the four recitations, Metal’s generating number, complete Wood’s divine transformation. This is the meaning.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited five times, long-standing chronic illnesses all restored their forms.*
The Master said: This is the generating number of Earth. The body’s muscles, blood, and form all belong to Earth. The five recitations restore form through the Five Phases’ body. Thus, the blind, deaf, mute, lame, paralyzed, chronically ill, and those with long-standing ailments all recover at once, restoring their forms and wholeness—this is the generating number of the Five Phases.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited six times, white hair turned black, and fallen teeth regrew.*
The Master said: This is the completing number of Water.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited seven times, the old regained their youth, and the young grew stronger.*
The Master said: This is the completing number of Fire. The body’s inner light generates, and the five viscera’s splendor manifests externally. The old regain their youth, and the young gain enhanced appearance and strength—all through the power of Water and Fire.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited eight times, pregnant women and creatures with wombs, whether born or unborn, all achieved generation and completion.*
The Master said: This is the completing number of Wood. The qi of generation nurtures all things, enabling their birth and completion. The sacred embryo congeals the numinous, free from all depletion. The eight qi flourish and coalesce, dividing forms and transforming embryos, free from all depletion—this is governed by Wood’s generative qi.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited nine times, the earth’s treasuries opened, and gold and jade revealed their forms.*
The Master said: The sacred embryo’s nine revolutions are the completing number of Metal. Forms cannot conceal the radiance of Metal’s light; jade’s splendor illuminates the entire body. This is what is called a golden countenance and jade visage, skin like jasper and nectar like jade, bathing and irrigating the whole body. Exhaling and inhaling animate all things, instantly generating gold and jade; blowing qi forms gold, and spitting on the ground creates treasures. A hundred lights and a thousand hues interlace within and without, connected by the Five Phases’ completed functions of gold and jade, giving rise to the sacred embryo’s divided forms.

The Scripture states: *When the scripture was recited ten times, withered bones revived and all rose as complete humans.*
The Master said: This is the completing number of Earth. This is what is called *Ten Revolutions Returning the Numinous, the myriad qi ascending as immortals*—restoring the skeleton, reviving the dead, transforming withered bones into immortals, and reviving them as complete humans. These ten recitations trace their origin to the Five Phases’ generating numbers and conclude with the Five Phases’ completing numbers. Understanding this Way leads to longevity; cultivating it leads to immortality, shedding the husk and ascending in flight—this is its ultimate achievement. If merit is perfected and conduct fulfilled, one ascends to the rank of high perfected. Eighty-one days make one revolution; eight hundred days, the Lesser Vehicle; three thousand days, the Greater Vehicle. Departing not from these words, they produce all divine immortals. Though the paths of the myriad methods differ, their affairs converge in one principle.

The True Master said: The oral instructions are exhausted in this text—this is the lesser Way, transmitted to the perfected.

The Dharma-Empty Perfected One intoned:
*From one to ten, the Five Phases are the root.*
*Yin and yang revolve in cycles,*
*Entering and exiting the sacred gate.*

The sun ascends Mount Fusang, the moon sinks into the Dark Abyss.
The myriad spirits pay homage to the True; they attain union with the Great Primal.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in statute and decree!*

**Exhaling and inhaling the true qi:**
The Scripture states: Draw qi thirty-two times.
The Master said: The true qi of the Numinous Treasure is the true Dao-qi of the thirty-two heavens. Without absorbing this qi, inner cultivation lacks the foundation for achievement, and external practice yields no responsive verification. Then one merely walks the upper path as an empty corpse, or recites sacred chapters as a lower ghost—all efforts are in vain.

**Qi of the heavens:**
Great Yellow Heaven’s yellow qi,
Great Bright Heaven’s green qi,
Clear Bright Heaven’s blue-green qi,
Mysterious Womb Heaven’s red qi,
Primal Bright Heaven’s azure qi,
Upper Bright Heaven’s black qi,
Void-Nothing Heaven’s jade-green qi,
Great Ultimate Heaven’s purple qi.

The Master said: Step the *gang* of Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall, and draw qi—then the Heavenly Lords of the eight heavens dispatch perfected immortals as attendants and guards. They penetrate and observe the affairs of the eight heavens, and wherever one goes, there is no obstruction.

Bright Crimson Heaven’s white qi,
Mysterious Bright Heaven’s green qi,
Radiant Bright Heaven’s yellow qi,
Bamboo Fall Heaven’s blue-green qi,
Void-Origin Heaven’s red qi,
Contemplative Bright Heaven’s azure qi,
Mysterious Bright Heaven’s black qi,
Great Resplendent Heaven’s jade-green qi.

The Master said: Step the *gang* of Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket, and draw qi according to its color—then the Heavenly Lords of the eight heavens dispatch perfected immortals as attendants and guards. They penetrate and observe the affairs of the eight heavens, and wherever one goes, there is no obstruction.

Primal Load Heaven’s purple qi,
Great Peace Heaven’s white qi,
Manifest Stability Heaven’s yellow qi,
Beginning Yellow Heaven’s green qi,
Great August Heaven’s blue-green qi,
Thought-Free Heaven’s red qi,
Upper Divination Heaven’s azure qi,
Ultimate Void Heaven’s black qi.

The Master said: Step the *gang* of Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wing, and Axletree, and draw qi according to its color—then the Heavenly Lords of the eight heavens dispatch perfected immortals as attendants and guards. They penetrate and observe the affairs of the eight heavens, and wherever one goes, there is no obstruction.

Luminous Court Heaven’s jade-green qi,
Abyssal Passage Heaven’s purple qi,
Great Script Heaven’s white qi,
Great Simplicity Heaven’s yellow qi,
Great Void Heaven’s green qi,
Great Liberation Heaven’s blue-green qi,
Dragon Transformation Heaven’s red qi,
Great Ultimate Heaven’s azure qi.

The Master said: Step the *gang* of Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, and Orion, and draw qi according to its color—then the Heavenly Lords of the eight heavens dispatch perfected immortals as attendants and guards. They penetrate and observe the affairs of the eight heavens, and wherever one goes, there is no obstruction.

**Method of absorbing qi:**
The oral instructions state: For absorbing the qi of the thirty-two heavens, first knock the teeth nine times. From the Heavenly Gate, enter the Upper Primal Net-Streaming Diagram, proceeding to the twenty-eight lunar lodges and stepping through them. For each heaven, visualize the golden towers and jade halls, where the Heavenly Thearch sits enthroned, crowned and robed in the color of that heaven. From his mouth descends qi of the corresponding color, like fine threads or luxuriant mist, spreading over your body. Inhale it according to the prescribed number, drawing it into your body. For any prayers or petitions, silently present them in the *gang*-wind of the Thearch’s Mysterious Governance. Immediately await the responsive communion from the four directions and the Brahma Heavens of the Dipper’s *gang*. Always align with the lodges of the day for absorption, and practice concurrently across the four heavens.

The Master said: This Dao is the chart first revealed by the Primordial Beginning, the hidden and arcane Way of the Jade Maiden of Mysterious Perfection.

From the *jia-zi* day, the *Tun* hexagram stands at the head, with Water ☵ above and Thunder ☳ below. The yang lines number thirty-six breaths, the yin lines twenty-four breaths. One exhalation measures three inches, one inhalation three inches—this constitutes one breath. When the pulse arrives four times, each arrival spans one inch and five *fen*, so four arrivals make six inches.

The true *qi* of old yang, with doubled exhalation and inhalation, counts thirty-two. At twenty-eight counts, the accelerated practice of sixty hours binds the primordial *qi* into the true script within the Cinnabar Valley, naturally forming jade-like radiant patterns, dragon scripts with eightfold brilliance. Refined with the true fire of pure yang, it becomes the Red Writ.

To know this Dao, consult the Chart of the Primordial August One of Mount Tortoise—this is the method for ascending in broad daylight. Without comprehending its profound principles, follow the recitation practices and ingest it for a year; naturally, you will attain spiritual communion. Await the descent of the Mysterious Perfection to bestow guidance.

**Embryonic Transformation and Corporeal Refinement**
The August Person’s Teachings state: The sagely embryo of the Primordial Beginning has a ten-month process of bodily formation and a Way of seven heads and five roots.

The Scripture says:
- **Supreme Wondrous Head**: Fifteen years.
- **Peerless Conduct Head**: Twenty-five years.
- **Ānāpāna Head**: Thirty-five years.
- **Prolonged Clarity Head**: Forty-five years.
- **Bent Head**: Fifty-five years.
- **Three Realms Bowing Head**: Sixty-five years.
- **Host of Demons Bound Head**: Seventy-five years.

The Master said: The *Supreme Wondrous Head* does not require nine years of practice. The *Peerless Conduct Head* may attain perfection in seven years. The *Ānāpāna Head* ascends in nine years. The *Prolonged Clarity Head* completes its cycle in twelve years, with spirit fully realized. The *Bent Head* achieves liberation through *shi-jie* in eighteen years. At sixty-five, one becomes an immortal of Earth and Water, their name recorded in the Celestial Register—hence the *Three Realms Bowing Head*. At seventy-five, one attains longevity and transcends the world, free from demonic trials—hence the *Host of Demons Bound Head*. Those who extend their years beyond this also bind the host of demons.

The Scripture says: The *upper colorless root* is the Celestial Root. Sever the Earthly Root to preserve the Life Root and eradicate the Evil Root.

The Master said: The *upper colorless root* signifies the purification of all sensory defilements, entering the state of formlessness and non-action—this is the Celestial Root. Without attaining this root, first sever the Earthly Root to eliminate karmic burdens and suffering debts, thereby preserving the Life Root. Both paths prioritize the eradication of the Evil Root.

It is also said: The *upper follows the Celestial Root*, the *middle follows the Earthly Root*, while the *color root* is eliminated, and the *secondary mind-root* is extinguished.

The Master said: Only after mastering the Way of the sagely embryo’s seven heads and five roots may one enter the embryonic transformation of the Primordial Beginning.

The sagely embryo of the Primordial Beginning arises after the Red Writ and before the Azure Vault, born in the Great Floating Li Soil. The eight vessels of the heart’s pericardium correspond externally to the nine colors. Refined in the Nine Cauldrons, preceding the seven heads and five roots, the Red Writ and Azure Vault, when Heaven and Earth emerge from numeration, lie in the breath before inhalation and exhalation.

Once the mechanism of breath is established, it governs the ebb and flow of *qi*. Day and night comprise 3,500 breaths, each breath marked by four pulse arrivals within inhalation and exhalation. One exhalation spans three inches, one inhalation three inches—thus, each breath cycle encompasses six inches of egress and ingress. Each pulse arrival measures one inch and five *fen*, totaling fifteen *fen*—the great number of yin and yang.

The body of Heaven and Earth follows the ratio of three to two. When the true *qi* enters the Nine Cauldrons, it circulates mercury and absorbs lead, forging the sagely embryo of the Primordial Beginning.

Each hour, the *qi* extends 6,750 inches. Over twelve hours, it spans 81,000 inches, totaling 8,100 feet—810 *zhang* of true *qi*—constituting the twelve hours. Each hour is divided into eight *ke* and twenty *fen*, totaling ninety-six *ke* in twelve hours. The trigrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* occupy four *ke*, making one hundred *ke* in all. Each hour is fixed at 1,150 breaths, totaling 13,800 breaths in twelve hours. Each breath regulates one *zhu* of fire; twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*, and 384 *zhu* constitute one *jin* of fire. With 13,500 breaths, the true fire amounts to 315 *jin*, two *liang*, and a half—eight yin and eight yang.

Thus, when the revolutions of Heaven and Earth are fixed, human *qi* and blood circulate through the body in a day and night, with one hundred *ke*. Each *ke* contains sixty *fen*, and one hour—eight *ke* and twenty *fen*—yields 360 breaths. With each inhalation and exhalation, Heaven and Earth traverse sixty *li*. In one day and night, they travel 961,500 *li*. The celestial sphere spans 365 degrees, twenty-five *fen*, and a half, totaling 182 degrees, seventy-five *fen*, seventy-five *miao*. Each degree measures 1,464 *li*, six *cun*, and twenty-eight constellations revolve in harmony with Heaven and Earth, advancing with the Dipper and retreating with the Winnowing Basket.

Each *ke*, Heaven and Earth traverse 10,800 *li*. Each *ke* has sixty *fen*, and each *fen* six breaths. In one hour, Heaven and Earth travel 84,004 *li*, while the *qi* extends 6,750 inches. Over twelve hours, the *qi* traverses 700,890 inches in total.

As Heaven and Earth move, *qi* and blood flow; as yin and yang revolve, *ying* and *wei* circulate. When the sun and moon conjoin, the inner *qi* converges, and from this convergence, the supreme treasure is born. When the supreme treasure gathers, the Great Elixir forms, and the sagely embryo congeals.

The pathways of leakage are assailed by the Eight Evils. The foundation of elixir transformation lies in the union of the Ten Celestial Stems, aligned with the Nine Cauldrons and harmonized with the Nine Colors, perfected through the Nine Revolutions.

**Chart of the Eight Vessels of the Heart’s Pericardium in the Primordial Inner Contemplation**
**Primordial Spiritual Penetration**
The Scripture says: Those who penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle can master its chapters. Let scholars of the highest learning recite it; let students recite it.

Here is the translation:

---

**General Precepts (Two Items):**
For offerings and reverent rites, recite this scripture ten times.

**General Precepts (Two Items):**
Let scholars of the highest learning cultivate and recite it; let the people of the world receive and recite it.

**General Precepts (Two Items):**

Those who know its sound and can fast and recite it shall recite it. *(Two Items)*

The Master says: The above thirty-eight items are all the original, inherent, and wondrous merits of the Primordial Dao, beyond all conception. Should even one item be lacking, the response will fail to manifest, and one cannot be deemed a Perfected Person.

**Mysterious Responses in Cultivation and Recitation**
The Master says: To know the merits of reciting this scripture, align with the Supreme Mystery—there are one hundred and fifty kinds of mysterious responses. Once these responses arise, the day of ascending as an immortal and soaring into the void is near. If no mysterious response occurs, one should repent and purify the will, awaiting the auspicious signs of the mysterious response.

The myriad heavens chant from afar; the ten thousand emperors offer rites.
Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks conceal their clouds.
The sun and moon pause in their radiance; the celestial pivots cease their turning.
All demons bind their forms; ghostly spirits lose their clarity.
The dead return to life; white bones become human.

**Ten Auspicious Signs of the Supreme Sages:**
The Five Emperors stand in attendance; the Three Realms bow in reverence.
Demon spirits lose their sight; ghostly apparitions vanish.
Those on the verge of death are delivered; those who have perished are restored to life.

**Six Auspicious Signs of the Aspiring Learner:**
Earth deities are subdued and commanded; demonic spirits are bound and restrained.
Death is averted, and life alone remains.

**Three Auspicious Signs of the Student:**
---

Gates and households flourish, generation after generation thriving and prosperous,
bound to good karmic conditions—ten thousand calamities cannot assail them,
and divine spirits guard their doors.

**Five Auspicious Signs of the Devout:**
All heavens arrive in unison; the suffering souls of countless ancestors,
trapped in darkness, are immediately delivered and ascend to the Crimson Palace.
After nine years of refinement, they are transformed and reborn,
becoming noble persons. Those who diligently study and master the scriptures,
fulfilling their merit and perfecting their virtue, all attain immortality,
soaring to the Golden Gates and roaming the Jade Capital.

**For the Advanced Learner** who cultivates and recites this scripture:
all are immediately delivered and ascend to the Southern Palace.

**For the Common Reciter:**
life is prolonged, and years extended. Thereafter, all attain the Way of *shijie*,
where the soul briefly dissolves, escaping the underworld’s torments,
and swiftly regains form, roaming the vast heavens.

**Ten Auspicious Signs of the Ordinary Reciter:**
freed from earthly servitude, they ascend to the Southern Palace.

**Two Auspicious Signs of Recitation in the First Month:**
the body attains immortality; the heavens inscribe their names,
recorded on yellow registers and white tablets, erasing death and granting life.

**Three Auspicious Signs of Recitation in the Seventh Month.**

To stabilize and secure the nation’s destiny, safeguard the heavens’ eternal endurance, ensure dynastic succession without end, and perpetually reign as sovereign—thus pacifying the realm and bringing the people to proclaim great peace.

**Recitation in the Tenth Month:** Six Auspicious Signs.
The Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

**Recitation on the Eight Festivals:** One Auspicious Sign.
The soul and spirit become pure and upright; the myriad *qi* endure forever. Unafflicted by suffering, the body radiates light. The Three Realms attend as guards; the Five Emperors oversee reception. Myriad spirits pay homage; names are inscribed in the heavens. When merit is fulfilled and virtue perfected, one ascends to the Supreme Clarity.

**Recitation on One’s Natal Day:** Ten Auspicious Signs.
With eyes closed in serene contemplation, the body sits amid clouds of blue, yellow, and white *qi*. Within and without, all is shrouded in mist. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, and White Crane array themselves to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate the chamber, its interior suffused with radiance. A circular halo emerges from the crown, its light pervading the ten directions.

**Recitation Within the Chamber:** Nine Auspicious Signs.
The Three and Five Merit Officers, Attendant Envoys of the Left and Right, Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Fragrance Officials of the Appointed Day—all are summoned by the Mystic Register.

**Recitation of the Mystic Chapters Ten Thousand Times:** Fourteen Auspicious Signs.
The revolutions of heaven and earth also know decline and end. The sun, moon, and five planets likewise wax and wane. Even the most sagely and divine may experience repose or adversity. Those of lesser learning may also suffer illness or harm.

**Prayer and Exorcism:** Four Auspicious Signs.
If the learner’s Dao is shallow or their immortal rank incomplete, their destined time of dissolution may arrive. Passing through the Great Yin, at the moment of transition, fellow learners and perfected beings may burn incense and recite the scripture ten times on their behalf. By thus delivering the corporeal form according to the method, the soul and spirit ascend directly to the Southern Palace. According to the measure of their cultivated merit, they are reborn after a calculated span, their transmigration unceasing, and so attain immortality.

**Refinement of the Corpse in the Great Yin:** Three Auspicious Signs.
When the revolutions of heaven and earth draw to a close, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the stellar lodges fall into disorder and the sun and moon lose their proper course, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the four seasons lose their order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When pestilence spreads and the multitudes perish, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture. When teachers or companions pass away, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scripture.

**Purification Rites and Daoist Practices:** Ten Auspicious Signs.
The heavens record names; myriad spirits stand guard. For the distinguished perfected, this ensures attainment as a minister of the Golden Gates and a sage sovereign. The heavens meticulously record the merits and transgressions of all, without the slightest error. Even the Demon Kings of the Celestial Center will advocate for one’s attainment of the Dao.

**Cultivation of Merit:** Five Auspicious Signs.
The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings descend to observe the practitioner, recording their diligent merit and submitting it to the heavens. Myriad spirits pay homage; earthly deities stand at the gates. The Great Merit Demon Kings advocate for one’s ascent as an immortal.

**Recitation with True Understanding:** Six Auspicious Signs.
Nothing is not averted, nothing is not exorcised, nothing is not delivered, nothing is not accomplished—for this is the natural sound of the Celestial Perfected. Thus, recitation summons the Flying Heavenly Ones to descend and observe; the Supreme Emperor sings from afar. Myriad spirits pay homage; the Three Realms attend in reverence. All demonic hordes bow their heads; ghostly spirits perish of their own accord. The resonant chime of jade rings forth; the ten directions grow solemn and clear. Rivers and seas fall silent; mountains and peaks swallow their mists. Myriad spirits tremble and submit; immortals are gathered in assembly. The heavens are free of impurity; the earth is cleansed of demonic dust. Profound wisdom illumines the depths; the vastness of the Mysterious is utterly profound.

**Twenty-Four Auspicious Signs.**
Expounding the scripture once: all Celestial Great Sages simultaneously proclaim its virtue; in one nation, the deaf and ailing regain their hearing.
Expounding the scripture twice: the blind recover their sight.
Expounding the scripture thrice: the mute regain speech.
Expounding the scripture four times: the lame, the chronically ill, and the bedridden all rise and walk.
Expounding the scripture five times: those afflicted by long-standing and intractable illnesses instantly regain their form.
Expounding the scripture six times: white hair returns to black; fallen teeth regrow.
Expounding the scripture seven times: the aged regain their youth; the young grow strong.
Expounding the scripture eight times: pregnant women, birds, and beasts—whether their offspring are born or unborn—all attain proper development.
Expounding the scripture nine times: the earth’s treasuries open, revealing gold and jade.
Expounding the scripture ten times: withered bones revive, rising as fully formed humans.

**Ten Auspicious Signs of Inward Recitation:** The birth of the sagely embryo of the Primordial Beginning.

**Yin Elixir and Yang Elixir**
The scripture states: *Flowing essence and jade radiance, five colors flourishing in abundance.*
The scripture states: *The body radiates light.*
The scripture states: *The wondrous head of the highest rank, ten recitations deliver humanity. A hundred demons conceal their traces; separation and union arise naturally. The Crimson Text of the Primordial Chaos, the peerless Supreme Perfected.*

In the primordial kalpas of the Primordial Beginning, the myriad heavens were brought forth. The Three Luminaries were revealed—this is the root of heaven. Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is the body. The Five Scripts unfold and expand, universally nurturing the divine spirits. Without scripture, there is no illumination; without scripture, there is no clarity; without scripture, there is no establishment; without scripture, there is no accomplishment; without scripture, there is no deliverance; without scripture, there is no birth.

The scripture states: *Jade essence and evergreen mulberry, transcending the void to attain immortality.*
The master says: *Flowing essence and jade radiance are the Numinous Treasures of Heaven. They may be refined and ingested to commune with the Perfected.* Thus, the Celestial Perfected Sovereign declares: *Before the Great Void, there was not a single thing.* The Primordial Heavenly Worthy emerged within the Three *Qi*, smelting the Crimson Text of the Primordial Chaos to forge the jade characters. The Three Luminaries were revealed, universally nurturing the divine spirits. Though we know of these today, comparing them to the era before the Primordial Beginning, the *qi* that gave birth to the Numinous Treasures may be gathered again, refined into an elixir, and ingested to attain perfection.

The method states: *Upon a high mountain’s sheer cliff, where no human treads, in a place where the sun and moon’s light converges, establish a secluded chamber. Its shape should be round above and square below, with a diameter of eight feet and sides of ten feet, raised five feet above the ground. Bore thirty-two apertures, arranging them in the pattern of the Twenty-Eight Constellations, like windows to admit the sunlight.*

Begin on the day when the sun aligns with the Horn Star. Use a vessel of the Seven Treasures, five inches in diameter, filled with westward-flowing water, to receive the descending sunlight. After forty-five days, five-colored flowing essence-sand will congeal within the water. Collect and ingest it, and your face will radiate a flowing purple light, enabling communion with the divine and attainment of perfection.

To refine the Great Elixir of the Numinous Treasure, place thirty-two vessels beneath the thirty-two apertures. On the day when the sun aligns with each constellation, gather the corresponding directional water and infuse it with the Four Springs—comprising rain, dew, frost, and snow. Let the sun illuminate and the moon bathe the water; after forty-five days, floating sand will form upon its surface, shimmering with luminous brilliance. Guard its purity diligently, allowing no dust to obscure it. Then, arrange the altar furnace with eight gates and commence the firing. Forge a crucible from twelve taels of gold and a cauldron from twenty-four taels of iron. Use a yang-burning mirror to kindle the flame and tend it day and night. Open the furnace once every forty-five days, and at that time, anoint it with moonlight to condense the white blossom within. When one catty has accumulated, add twenty-four *zhū* each of the Riverbank Maiden’s cinnabar-mountain white soul and the Crimson Mound’s vermilion child, placing them within the crucible and sealing it with the numinous elixir. Refine with yin and yang fire for seven periods, causing the essence to ascend to the lid. When it increases to one catty, proceed to the Nine Revolutions. After nine years, it will naturally congeal within the womb-chamber, forming a crimson fruit with a vermilion stem—a single grain of which, when swallowed, instantly transforms one into a flying immortal.

Every forty-five days constitutes one bathing cycle. As for the Way of the Golden Elixir, the firing of the jade characters resides within the cinnabar valley. On one’s life-destiny day, follow the method to circulate through the apertures and ingest the essence of the sun and moon. This belongs to the rank of the True *Qi* Canon. When merit fills both inner and outer realms, one may ascend to the Jade Clarity on the appointed day. The Jade Birth is the essence of jade light, descending to nurture the Fusang Tree, enabling transcendence across the empty realms. This is also the wondrous purport of the Three Luminaries within the Great Cavern. Only after the elixir is completed and the world is saved may it be consumed.

The Master says: The crimson text descends in flight, the Great One contains its bloom—like the lotus as the origin, with a hundred flowers following. It is also called the Numinous Treasure Pearl-Light Elixir, capable of curing all illnesses, reviving the dead, and, with prolonged ingestion, ensuring longevity. It is most potent when gathered on *bǐng-dīng*, *xū-hài*, *chén-sì* days and hours: with the left hand, pluck thirty-two unopened white lotuses; with the right, thirty-two red lotuses. Dry them over fire until brittle, then incinerate them to ash. Next, on the third day of the third month, the seventh day of the seventh month, and the ninth day of the ninth month, gather one catty each of a hundred flowers as companions. Then add five *liǎng* each of nine-jointed sweetflag, ginseng, rehmannia, asparagus, atractylodes, dried ginger, and sesame. Grind them together, blending with the hundred-flower nectar into a paste, and form into pills the size of soybeans. Take five to seven pills with ash-free wine. The gathering and blending are accompanied by invocations, as detailed in the recitation canon. Consuming one pill daily grants foresight after a hundred days, freedom from illness after a year, and immortality. After a thousand days, the Five Spirits will be fulfilled, and eternal life instantly attained.

The *Dà Xíng Fàn Qì* Scripture states: The Eight Luminaries merge in darkness, *qi* enters the profound mystery, within which abides the Supreme Emperor, the Lofty Perfected. The Master says: This is the primordial *qi* of the Queen Mother of the West’s Eight Luminaries, also called the Cinnabar Sovereign Lord. It is the supreme Dao of the Highest Rank, by which all true immortals of the Three Realms refine the great Brahman within the human body, aligning above with celestial transcendence. Thus, the breath of inhalation and exhalation—when the *qi* circulates within the body and unites with the Great Yang—refines the great medicine. This is the true path of cultivation and the stairway to the Dao.

The Scripture says: The Great Brahman *Qi* pervades the cosmos, the boundless Brahman of the primordial chaos, the formless realm of Brahman conduct. The Master says: Humans are born from the boundless Brahman of the primordial chaos yet die through the boundless Brahman of the turbid ford. If one seeks to master the Great Brahman *Qi*, first cultivate the twelve kinds of Brahman conduct, then distinguish the Brahman *qi*. The origin of Brahman *qi* is the Queen Mother. This is also the supreme Dao of the Great Cavern.

Humans are endowed with *qi* at birth, which also marks the beginning of their allotted span. The breath of inhalation and exhalation manifests in the three regions and four extremities of the pulse. Each exhalation measures three inches, each inhalation three inches—measured by the celestial balance, aligning with the Great Yang. One day and night comprise one hundred *kè*, totaling six thousand divisions. Each *kè* contains sixty *fēn*, each *shí* (two-hour period) eight *kè*, and twenty *fēn*, totaling one hundred forty *fēn*. In a day and night, there are thirteen thousand five hundred breaths. Each *kè* contains three hundred sixty breaths. With each inhalation and exhalation, the pulse travels six inches, and the Great Yang traverses sixty *lǐ*. In a day and night, the Great Yang travels a total of nine million six hundred fifteen thousand *lǐ*, circling the heavens and illuminating three hundred sixty-five degrees and twenty-five and a half *fēn*. Each day it advances one and a half degrees, completing a celestial cycle of one hundred eighty-two degrees, sixty-two *fēn*, seventy-five *miǎo*. Each degree measures one thousand four hundred sixty-four *lǐ*, six *cùn*, and four *fēn*. The twenty-eight constellations progress through their encircling degrees, while the great Dao’s Brahman *qi* flows endlessly, revolving the Dipper and traversing the Winnowing Basket, cycling through the Five Constants.

As the Great Yang’s true *qi* flows one hundred eight thousand *lǐ* each *kè*, and each *kè* contains sixty *fēn* and three hundred sixty-two breaths, the Great Yang’s flowing light advances three hundred sixty *lǐ* per *fēn*. Each *shí*, the Great Yang’s flowing true light travels eighty-six thousand four hundred *lǐ*, while its *qi* permeates six thousand seven hundred fifty *cùn*. Over twelve *shí*, the total *qi* and blood circulate seven hundred eight thousand ninety *cùn*. As the sun and moon conjoin, yin and yang intermingle; as the sun and moon move, the defensive and constructive *qi* circulate—thus the great medicine is completed herein.

Within the ancient crucible of the Nine *Qi*, a small child gathers. Each day and night, the Brahman *qi* ascends in audience. If even a trace of dust-like thought arises, the Great Brahman *Qi* is lost, failing to pervade the body—then death ensues, for this is the foremost gateway to mortality.

Here the root of the Nine *Qi* resides—the profound abode of true earth—located in the northwest quadrant, between *xū* and *hài*, bordering the Jade Purity realm and connecting to the Mud Pill Palace. To the south, it joins the Crimson Palace of Yang Permeation; above, it links to the lung *qi*; below, it reaches the inner gate, the portal of sun and moon, the cinnabar chamber where gold and mercury conjoin. To the north lies the inner kidney, spanning three *cùn*, flanked by twelve divine chambers, wherein dwells the sovereign of Brahman *qi*—the solitary true mother.

**Chart of the Western Tortoise Mountain**
The Western Tortoise Mountain, also called Dragon Mountain, signifies the Dao of wood. The Metal Mother resides there, embodying the essence of metal. It is the root of the Nine Heavens and the foundation of the nine palaces within humans. The nexus of yellow *qi*’s profound abode, the palace of Brahman *qi*, the true seat of earth. In the celestial northwest, between *hài* and *zǐ*, lies the birthroot of the infant. Spanning myriad leagues in circumference, its bounds are immeasurable, transcending all conventional measures. Its height borders the Jade Purity realm, ascending to the brain. Its meridians connect to the Jade Emperor’s Palace; to the southeast, it adjoins the Divine Tiger Gate, linking to the lung *qi*, and further communicates with the great stomach. To the northwest, it intersects the Cold Cavern, exchanging *qi* with the kidney palace’s hidden chamber. At its southern extreme, Cavern Yang harmonizes with the heart; to the north, it points to the Curved Array, treading the Central August Palace. Above, it fills the twenty-four nodes of Jade Capital, the twelve-storied tower. Extending thirty thousand *lǐ* in breadth, it is the convergence of the Three *Qi*. Gold surges forth as walls, jade coalesces as gates—this is the palace of true earth and jade liquid. Golden terraces and jade halls mirror the prior discourse. The twelve divine chambers encompass the Seven Governors, Nine Palaces, and Three Fields. As stated before, above flows the essence of the Purple Palace’s Golden Flower Hall, flanked by five apertures—the gateway where the essences of the five viscera gather. Naturally arising purple *qi* clouds intertwine with nine-colored phoenix patterns, cascading like silk through the four limbs and eight vessels, the five viscera and six bowels, where crimson blossoms and purple essences internally generate the Five Non-Beings. Its cliffs birth purple cassia groves and jade forests, coral branches and jade roots; the hanging groves bear fruit—crimson children and white rings—where flawless *qi* engenders these treasures. Three flowers radiate upon the vermilion landscape; reversed fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. Inward vision connects the Three Illuminations; five aromas arise from the Five *Qi*. Eight *qi* stir as jade flutes sing in the void—sound without instrument within.

**The Flow of the Primordial Net**
The Master said: The Primordial Net is the path of primordial *qi*, the root of the Nine Heavens. From a celestial perspective, it lies in the northwest quadrant, bordering the Jade Purity realm. To the southeast, it joins the rosy clouds of Yang Permeation, ascending to the Divine Tiger Gate of the Pure Palace. To the northwest, it spans the wilds of the Cold Valley, ascending to the Golden Portal of the Immortals’ Court. At its southern extreme, it reaches the land of Great Cinnabar and Floating Blackness, where *qi* harmonizes with the radiance of Cavern Yang. To the north, it aligns with the Curved Array, intersecting the *qi* of the Flower Canopy, treading the central expanse of Broad Mound, directly filling Jade Capital. Eight winds converge—this is the Western Tortoise Mountain, the numinous root of heaven.

The Master said: To examine the Primordial Net is to scrutinize the celestial root and pivot, the warp of *qi*, the origin of the Dao’s source. Before the Dao’s division, the Primordial Net was already established—this is the great form of heaven and earth, the subtle axis of wondrous *qi*. It weaves through the thirty-two heavens, threading the twenty-eight constellations’ divisions. That which ascends is called the Dao; that which flows forth is called the teaching. Practiced internally, it aligns with the body; applied externally, it revolves with method. This is the natural pattern of heaven and earth, the embodiment and function of the human form.

Moreover, the illusory human body, formed from impure and turbid matter—once the embryo stirs, the three hairs serve no purpose. A thing of dust and decay, only our singular spirit shares a beginning and end with heaven and earth, equally endowed with ancestral *qi*. Thus, the head is round like heaven, the feet square like earth; the eyes resemble sun and moon, the body mirrors *qián* and *kūn*. The *qi* and breath circulate in accord with heaven’s measures. If one cultivates this to correspond with that, one may endure with heaven, transcending without perishing.

The deluded fail to awaken to its truth, fail to examine its function, and claim the body contains heaven and earth, requiring no external pursuit—this is erroneous. The methods of internal alchemy branch into three thousand six hundred side paths, but only the golden elixir’s true formula remains essential. At its inception, one pursues the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unites the three natures in the Primordial Palace. In its completion, the yin soul vanishes without trace, the yang spirit merges with the Dao. According to the weight of merit and the rank of one’s endowment, one is appointed to the immortal bureaucracy, receives scriptures in the grotto heavens. Yet one cannot assert that within the body lies heaven and earth while outside, none exist; that within are spirit and form while outside, no spirits or gods. Grasping a fragment of technique, one presumes internality precludes externality—how grievously mistaken!

In recent times, such claims persist, yet they are fallacious. The regret lies in not encountering the Master’s intent, groping blindly without grasping the essentials. Neither wholly internal nor exclusively external, one fabricates a doctrine of neither within nor without—this strays even further from principle.

Behold the azure vault above—this is heaven. The sun, moon, and stars are heaven’s patterns. The boundless and unfathomable—this is earth. Mountains, rivers, and peaks are earth’s principles. The human body, with its four limbs and five constituents, is but one thing among heaven and earth, yet its nature surpasses all things. You bear heaven and tread earth—can you truly say there is no heaven or earth beyond? The discourse on the Primordial Net’s form reveals heaven’s constancy. Next, it describes the human body, modeling itself on heaven and earth, aligning with yin and yang—speaking of its resemblance.

Heaven is firm and ceaseless in its movement, thus heaven and earth endure. If one unites with the Dao and clarifies the spirit, one too may avoid perishing.

This is not the heavens existing independently within the body, nor is it purely internal or external—such misconceptions would mislead later generations. Thus, it must be clearly distinguished.

The Primordial Net is the essential path for ascending the spirit, the supreme vista of the celestial stages. Once the source of the Dao is discerned, the divine heavens reside above the hollows of Mount Kongtong, beyond words or perception. Those who awaken to its truth cultivate truth through truth, and external truth naturally responds. Those who recognize its subtlety attain subtlety through subtlety, and external subtlety naturally manifests.

As for the celestial deities’ forms, the position of the Primordial Net—whether distant or near—can be known. Within humans, the Primordial Net’s *qi* opens and unblocks the bones and meridians, ascending to the crown of the head, just as the Primordial Net’s path exists in the heavens. The human *hun* and *po* reside within the body as *qi* does in heaven: those who understand their egress and ingress achieve longevity and flight, while those who do not remain common and ignorant. It is like seeking an audience with the ruler without studying the arts or knowing the ranks of officialdom.

When primordial *qi* fuses and gathers, it nourishes the *hun* and *po*, giving rise to true essence. This true essence roots in the right kidney, which is the Gate of Life, located at the hollow of the spine. Below it lies a great bone, its marrow piercing the coccyx; this cavity is called the "Tortoise Tail," and its deity is the Queen Mother, who faces south to govern. As the Emperor faces this direction, it is called the "Western Tortoise Mountain"—a metaphor Daoists employ. It is also named the "Golden Palace" for its western location.

To the right is the Golden Palace; to the left is the Jade Chamber, signifying jade within the mountain, moistened by wood and residing in the east. It is also the source of Jade Water, the transformation of yang essence, where essence congeals—named "Pure Radiance." This is where the Primordial Net’s *qi* originates.

The Precious Diagram’s high terrace arises within this "Lush Rosy Cloud Terrace," directly aligned with the heart’s abode, called the "Spirit Terrace." Above the Upper Clarity’s realm, at the border of Great Clarity, lies below the heart. The heart’s suspended root descends to the liver. Below the liver’s two divisions reside the seven stars of the Northern Dipper. Its *qi* reaches the heart, its origin ascending to the tongue’s underside, named the "Bubbling Spring." Its *qi* descends to the right kidney’s *qi*. When the kidney’s *qi* leaks, the Bubbling Spring’s *qi* cannot be restrained—this is called "crossing blades." "Crossing blades" refers to the Dipper’s *Gang* star and the fierce *Taipiao*’s domain, a realm of stern severity, the abode of the Desire Realm’s deities.

Those who know this Dao press the tongue to the upper palate, guiding *qi* upward along the spine to connect with the head. The head’s summit is the vital path to the Jade Capital, where the Western Tortoise borders the Jade Capital. Yet people, unaware, mistakenly place the Western Tortoise behind the brain. In truth, the Western Tortoise lies four thousand myriad layers from the Jade Capital’s *qi*, centrally positioned. Its *qi* ascends directly to heaven, first reaching the lowest Fire Star. The heart, belonging to fire, rises to resonate with it. The sun, moon, and Fire Star align, thus traversing the sun and moon within the body, where the two breasts correspond to the heart.

The two breasts are the eyes’ root. Humans’ breasts store essence to nourish the eyes. Thus, in old age, when *qi* wanes and eyes dim, the breasts yield no milk, and the kidneys lack essence. The Winnowing Basket and Dipper lie in the heavens’ northeast, serving as the celestial pivot—this is the *Gen* trigram’s domain. In humans, this corresponds to the right shoulder’s "Shoulder Well" point. The body’s blood, *qi*, and vessels begin on the right, just as heaven’s course begins in the northwest. Proceeding west to the Ox Mansion completes heaven’s affairs, yet generation has not yet arisen. Thus, creation begins here, re-entering the Fire Star.

Though human *qi* completes one cycle, its ebb and flow depend on this—re-entering the heart. The heart’s course follows fire, wood, water, and metal. The great decline follows the heart, liver, kidneys, and lungs—these are the *qi* transport points along the spine. Observing the spine’s points reveals their positions above, below, left, and right. Pursuing their subtlety, one finds the throat’s circuit connecting to the crown gate, embodying the mystery of mysteries, ineffable and unnameable.

The formless realm lies below the heart, within the hollows of Mount Kongtong, to the left of the Dipper’s bowl. From the Dipper’s mouth, pressing the tongue to the upper palate—called the "Celestial Bridge"—one transcends Upper Clarity to reach Jade Clarity. Thus, the Jade Clarity’s realm is the head, the Upper Clarity’s realm is the Crimson Palace, the Great Clarity’s realm is the Cinnabar Field, and the heart is the Spirit Terrace—its principles now evident.

Here, one guards. Guarding resides in the heart. Here, one pays homage. Homage resides in the head. The Three Flowers’ separation thus reveals a wondrous court. The celestial heavens’ convergence of the "Peerless White Prime" occurs in the heart, naturally forming the true, meeting in the head. Practicing the Numinous Treasure’s Dao within the body culminates here. No further expression is possible.

The Primordial Net’s flow in heaven was previously described. Its embodiment in the human body is recorded here. Scholars must deeply understand why this body is so noble: it can match heaven and earth, refine form and spirit, and unite with the numinous and subtle. Daoists employ metaphors based on phenomena, modeling heaven and earth to establish names. From the cultivated body, one establishes methods of action, progressing from action to non-action, from form to formlessness. Only then does one’s lifespan equal heaven and earth, merging with the Dao in truth. This begins within the body but does not end there.

**Primordial Net Flow Diagram**
According to the *Declarations of the Perfected*, the various perfected ones’ Five Star Diagram is arranged facing south. With Venus in the west and Jupiter in the east, it is thus applied.

The Five Stars conceal and reveal, shifting unpredictably in their courses, unlike the Northern Dipper whose pattern remains constant. Thus, one first establishes position according to the Five Directions, not following the stars’ transient locations.

**Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Righteous Steps**
Totaling one hundred seventy-eight steps. The formula states: First, one must visualize one’s own spirit ascending from the Yellow Court, riding five-colored clouds directly through the Jade Tower to the Mud Pill Palace. Stepping through the Seven Stars, one follows each star upward, feeling the body rise far above the earth into the celestial clouds and qi. Then, moving horizontally across the Seven Stars, one turns the body to enter the Dipper’s mouth, taking six cumulative steps. Visualizing the body facing south with its back to the north, proceed to Mars, envisioning red. Passing Mars, move eastward, visualizing passage through the Sun Palace in red. After the Sun Palace, proceed westward, visualizing passage through the Moon Palace in white. From the Moon Palace, move southwest, turning left seven times, then exit northward. Traverse the celestial stars of the southeast, reaching the northeast corner, then retrace the steps, circling the stars of the four directions: north, west, south, and east.

Upon completion, return to the northeast corner, face east, and circle once around the Chief Star. Then exit, moving toward Mars, pass the west to see Venus in white. From Venus, proceed northward to Mercury in black. From Mercury, pass eastward to Jupiter in blue-green. From Jupiter, return to Mercury’s palace, then west past Venus, heading straight to the Central Palace of Saturn in yellow. From Saturn, return to Venus and Mercury, reaching Jupiter’s palace. Gazing northwest, ride the clouds upward to behold the Golden Towers.

The formula states: Pay homage to the Thirty-Two Heavens, beginning with the Supreme Yellow Emperor’s Layered Heaven and ending with the Level Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven. Then return to pay homage to the Twenty-Eight Constellations, one Dipper per constellation, starting from the Winnowing Basket and circling back to the Dipper, then facing the Dipper’s handle to depart. Pay homage to the Five Stars according to the prescribed form.

Ascend the spirit to the celestial realm, entering the Northern Dipper’s midst. The Three Terraces’ six stars form a canopy overhead as one steps through one Dipper’s seat. Next, take six steps corresponding to the Three Terraces to exit. Circle left forty-nine steps, encountering Mars. Then proceed east eighty-one steps to the Great Sun, paying homage to the Filial Dao Immortal King. Turn right sixty-four steps, entering the Dipper from the north to reach the Great Yin, paying homage to the Filial Dao Luminous King. Turn left to exit, then left again, and right again, seven cycles within the formless realm. Steadfastly visualize the perfected immortals coming and going, traversing the Ten Directions’ Twenty-Eight Constellations and Thirty-Two Heavens. Each constellation’s Righteous Steps number twelve; returning, the total is three hundred thirty-six steps. At the Winnowing Basket’s Righteous Steps, face directly back toward the Northern Dipper’s great handle. Turn right, facing south for forty-nine steps, re-enter Mars, and pass through the Great Yin. Thirty-six steps to pay homage to Mercury, then eastward to the side of the Great Sun. Turn right sixty-four steps, completing the Wood phase in the east, facing to pay homage to Jupiter, then return to proceed. Borrowing Mercury’s Righteous Steps, exit beside the Great Yin. Eighty-one steps complete the Metal phase; face west to pay homage to Venus. Proceed east to the Dipper’s mouth, thirty-five steps to enter the center and pay homage to Saturn. Reverse course to re-enter Venus and Mercury’s lodges, then gaze directly north toward the Jade Capital’s Golden Towers. Proceeding step by step, bow twice and kneel, praying:

“Your subordinate, [Name], by fortunate karmic affinity, has encountered the true wind. Entering stillness to concentrate the spirit, I reverently approach the celestial towers. The body beyond the body ventures to reach the Jade Capital. I am overwhelmed with awe, gazing toward the heavens and longing for the sagely presence.”

Bow twice again and continue:

“This subordinate’s mortal bones are stubborn and coarse, inherently difficult to ascend. By the grace of my teacher’s instruction, I dare to let my spirit fly. Unafraid of punishment, I boldly disclose the cinnabar script. [Recite the matter at hand.] I am utterly devoted to beseeching favor, awaiting your command.”

Bow twice, retreat, and return along the original path, guiding the spirit back into the top of the head. Pray:

“Now I pay homage to the true, ascending to meet the azure clouds. May the divine beings seal my form and close my debts. Lift me away, secret and efficacious.”

The above **Primordial Net Flow Diagram** embodies the wondrous practices of the celestial Brahma conduct. It begins with flying the spirit to tread the Dipper and concludes with paying homage to the Emperor and facing the origin. If one can practice with focused intention and precise execution, entering and exiting with familiarity, maintaining unwavering concentration, one may present memorials and conduct affairs, command ghosts and spirits, and ultimately shed the mortal shell to ascend as a perfected being, merging with the myriad qi. The methods of refining form and facing the origin begin here.

On the Three Origins, Eight Nodal Days, and days of Jiazi and Gengshen, enter the oratory, burn incense, sit facing north, close the eyes, still the thoughts, and concentrate the spirit. With qi and breath flowing gently and the spirit-wind undisturbed, raise the body from the crown like a cicada shedding its shell, ascending into the empty void. Proceed according to the method. From subtlety to manifestation, from visualization to realization, it rests with the practitioner.

*Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual*, Scroll Four concludes.
*Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual*, Scroll Five.

The Venerable Master of Subtle Mysteries, Illuminator and Savior of Suffering, Perfected Xiao Quan-Zhen, transmitted to the disciples of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity and the Numinous Treasure lineage, Preceptor Wang Qi-Zhen, compiler of *The Gate of Refining and Regulating Breath*.

**Internal Audience of the Three Luminaries at the Golden Palaces**

The Master said: When practicing the great method, if one has not yet penetrated the celestial perfected, and the majestic transformation remains incomplete, demonic trials will assail, the spirits will not revere, and what is summoned will not respond—then one should practice the Dao of internally audienceing the Three Luminaries and flying as an immortal with a divided form.

The method is to perform the audience at the four hours of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei. First, visualize within the heart the Central Origin Controller of Destiny, whose name is Mysterious Firmness, who is the Supreme One of the Central Ultimate. Below, he resides in the Jade Hall Palace within the spleen, also called the Jade Chamber, which is the reclining abode of the Supreme One. He governs the nurturing of the adept’s entire bodily true form and qi-essence.

At the four hours, knock the teeth five times, visualize yellow qi filling the spleen, and upon the spleen, a true person like an infant, clad in yellow robes. Call upon him, saying: *"Supreme One of the Central Ultimate, Mysterious Firmness, Perfected Sovereign, I desire to attain the Dao of the Yellow Court of the True Person and the Immortal."* Call five times, then lie down, close the eyes for fifty breaths—this is the Elder of the Controller of Destiny of the Central Origin, who transforms below into the Supreme One, the Emperor, the father of the celestial deities of the Nine Heavens. He governs the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate. Those who know him will not descend into the earthly prisons; jade lads and jade maidens attend him, and he commands the myriad spirits.

Regularly at the four hours of Yin, Mao, Wu, and Shen, audience the Supreme One of the Upper Origin, titled the Old Man of the Southern Ultimate, who resides below in the Palace of the Supreme One. He governs the adept’s hun-soul, po-soul, womb spirit, life qi, and the father of the fetal palace. At these four hours, knock the teeth nine times, visualize a true person one inch above the head, named the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate, also called the Palace of the Supreme One. Visualize red and yellow qi filling the palace, and within the qi, a true person like a youth, clad in crimson robes. Call upon him, saying: *"Supreme One of the Southern Ultimate, Primordial First, Perfected Sovereign, I desire to attain the Dao of the divine elixir, longevity, and immortality."* Call nine times, then lie down, close the eyes for fifty breaths, and recite for ninety breaths before stopping. Those who practice this will prolong their years without dying, may transform into immortals, dispel demonic trials, and summon true immortals.

Regularly at the four hours of Zi, Hai, Si, and You, audience the Mysterious Origin Dao-Mother of the Lower Origin, who resides below in the Palace of the Dual Union—the kidneys. Opposite the Southern Ultimate above, it is thus called the Northern Ultimate. She governs the adept’s essence-qi, life and death, and is the mother of the talismanic registers. At these four hours, knock the teeth four times, visualize within the kidneys white qi, and within the qi, a divine tortoise. Upon the tortoise is the Mysterious Woman, clad in azure and white, like a maiden. To her left is the Controller of Destiny, clad in azure robes and a celestial crown; to her right is the Recorder of Deeds, clad in white robes and a celestial crown. Call upon her, saying: *"Mysterious Origin of the Lower Origin, Northern Ultimate Dao-Mother, named Mysterious Wonder, I desire to obtain the golden liquor and jade spring to drink and consume. I beseech you to command the Recorder of Deeds and the Controller of Destiny to erase my name from the register of death and inscribe me for long life, to command the Six Ding and Jade Maidens, and to establish a traveling kitchen."* Call four times, then lie down, close the eyes, and recite for forty breaths before stopping.

If this is practiced without fail at the proper times, over days and months, the responses will be boundless. After nine years, one may be appointed as an immortal minister of the Supreme Ultimate. After one year, there will be signs, and one may command spirits and deities, with every desire answered. Constantly maintain mindfulness, guard the mouth, and one may attain immortality on the appointed day. This is the practice of the Three August Emperors of the Cavernous Mystery, the secret mechanism of the Numinous Treasure, and must be performed with an oath to heaven and a vow to the master. One should wear the Five Directions’ Inner Sounds and Jade Characters, cultivate according to the method, and enter the subtle to attain the wondrous. Keep this secret.

**Internal Recitation of the Cavernous Chapters**

The Master said: The root of the Thirty-Two Heavens lies in the Primordial Record of the Western Origin Tortoise Mountain, which contains the *Cinnabar-Yellow Flying Mystery Purple Text* and the *Empty Cavern Numinous Chapters*. Thus, the chapter of the Form Realm’s Demon Kings states: *"I possess the Cavernous Chapters,"* which is precisely this text.

The *Flying Mystery Purple Text* says:
*The Flying Mystery Purple Qi congeals the root of spirit,
The net of jade numinosity binds the myriad spirits.
In the void, it surges and coalesces naturally,
Above, there are layered twelve transmissions.
Jade towers towering, radiant with luminous clouds,
Flowing essence and purple palaces girded with golden portals.
Jasper terraces gleaming, encircled by eight soaring,
Within, the Azure Gold Ninefold Immortals reside.
The Cinnabar August True Mother, named Essence-Prolonger,
Wears a cap of flying azure feathers at dawn.
In hand, she grasps a jade scepter and holds the numinous cord,
Five-colored life-demons face the imperial honored one.
Grasping the talismanic registers at the Gate of Life,
She chews the sun and moon, sips the liquor-spring.
The Net of Separation emits radiance, refining the five souls,
Internally replete, externally overflowing, the Crimson Palace rejoices.
Golden light shining, the form becomes perfectly round,
From the new moon, it enters the golden hue, turbid and indistinct.
Only the Enlightened One understands these words,
On the fifth and tenth days of the moon, the essence of the Northern Origin.
One may see the Flowery Canopy leading the Immortal Lords,
The purple qi revolving leftward, linked with the Dipper.
Passing through the four and seven, entering the Golden Gate,
This is where the Cinnabar August One reviews the myriad immortals.
Those who clearly understand this secret and apply diligent effort,
Should visualize the subtle scenes and contemplate them in detail.
When the wondrous vision responds and the essential text is attained,
In three years, one may securely preserve long life.
In nine years, one may ride the void and attain feathered skirts,
Lightly soaring in phoenix robes to ascend Dragon Mountain,
Looking up and down to the Ninefold Numinous Ones to pay homage at the Jade Dawn.*

For those who cultivate this Dao, from the first to the twelfth month of the year, each month select the third, fifth, ninth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days—five times in a month. On these days, purify with a fast, and after midnight, recite the *Flying Mystery Purple Text* once. Gaze upward toward the Golden Gate in the west. If in the mortal realm the sky is overcast and without light, perform this within the chamber: silently recite and internally visualize according to the method, imagining purple clouds revolving leftward from the Golden Gate, passing through the Dipper and Ladle, circling the Northern Dipper, and finally returning above the Golden Gate. Ensure each detail is clear.

After visualization, bow four times toward the purple clouds at the heart, knock the teeth three times, and raise the heart in prayer, saying: *"The night sky is bright and clear, the hidden and void reveal the true."*

The drifting clouds linger, golden radiance spreads in four directions.
The Cinnabar Emperor scatters his brilliance, the numinous flies as a purple disk.
On this night, the pure chamber unfolds the ranks of immortals.
Fulfill my highest aspiration, the body aligns with nature’s spontaneity.
Bind life to the moon’s essence, preserve the root of years and days.
The Three Spirits merge with the light, the light halts at Dragon Mountain.
In the secret night, I humbly petition—let it be as these words declare.

After the prayer, draw with mouth and nose the qi of the sun, moon, and purple clouds into the body, swallowing saliva twenty-eight times to conclude.
Visualize the body transforming into the Jade Void Emperor, encircled by the twenty-eight lunar mansions and starry constellations.
Practice this for three years, and during nightly repose, divine transcendents will descend to your chamber.
Your body will be suffused with purple clouds, illuminating your entire form, while the names of the Nine Heavens are inscribed in jade script upon the Jade Clarity.
After nine years, you will directly attain the rank of upper immortal.
This is the boundless merit of delivering beings—how noble is the Dao of immortality!
Let those who study the Dao exert themselves in its practice, lest they defile the numinous treasure of the Way, for then both the hidden and manifest realms will rely upon them.

The Master said: The heavens possess the qi of purple clouds, which intermingles with the sun, moon, five planets, and Northern Dipper. In every region and kingdom, there are those who align with the Dao and rulers who attain immortality.
When you perceive the sign of purple clouds, perform the rites as prescribed.
You need not wait for a fixed day—apply diligent mindfulness, and when the clouds descend, you will ascend to meet them.
Moreover, when purple clouds and yellow qi, luminous and drifting, linger over cliffs and valleys like a mat or canopy—whether crimson, white, yellow, azure, purple, or scarlet, or clouds of five colors with radiant halos and cinnabar auroras—these are the celestial lords and supreme deities traversing the mountains and valleys, where those who have attained the Dao reside.
You should hasten to such places to cultivate and refine yourself. If you gaze upward and behold a perfected one, prostrate yourself at once, burn incense, bow twice, and declare your heart’s vow. Persist in this practice, and you will soon behold the countenance of the imperial deity and swiftly ascend in flight.
Guard this knowledge within your heart; do not lightly reveal it to others.
If the Dao is divulged, its numinosity scatters, and immortality will never be attained.
Take as your model the Three Masters of Wen Shi, who served the Sage of the Golden Portals—let this be your standard. Strive to practice it.

It is said:
Within the true resides the divine—
The Great Lord of Longevity,
The Primordial Radiance Lord,
The White Prime Honored Spirit,
The Great One Who Oversees Destiny,
Peach and Health in harmonious extension.

The Master said: Within these two chapters lies the Dao of the Great Cavern, the forbidden scriptures of the upper Way. The *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected* speaks solely of the Great Lord of Longevity, who transforms the myriad spirits.
When a person is born, the qi of the Supreme Subtlety descends to generate life, shaping form and shedding the womb.
From birth onward, thirty-six thousand spirits are complete, and one’s lifespan extends to thirty-six thousand days. When the spirits are exhausted and return to the Supreme Subtlety, one becomes a ghost.
The day of the ghost is the day of return.
Yet the transgressions of a lifetime deplete qi and scatter spirits, hastening one’s descent into the realm of death. Thus, some die young in swaddling, their spirits incomplete.
When spirits are incomplete, the body is not firm. Moreover, minor sins deduct a single count, and the Northern Dipper seizes the three-eyed spirit.
Great evil erases a year’s count, and thirty-six thousand spirits and qi are reclaimed.
A small good deed adds a single count, extending life by three days and replenishing spirits.
A great merit adds a year to one’s lifespan, extending it by three hundred sixty days and summoning spirits to descend.
Thus, the waxing and waning of life depend on these seven spirits—the yin spirits of the Northern Dipper, also called the Mysterious Cinnabar Great One, which are likewise among the forbidden scriptures of the upper Way.
If you master this Dao, you will replenish spirits and extend life, enduring for ten thousand kalpas.

The *Hymn of the Primordial Honored Lord of Longevity* says:
In the middle origin, the Dipper governs souls and spirits,
The Primordial Mysterious Great One, the seven yin spirits.
Wielding the numinous banner, they command the hundred spirits,
Bestowing and seizing, judging good and evil, shaping increase and decrease.
One count removes three days of life,
One year removes three hundred sixty.
Those who know how to move the seven numinous powers
Ascend into the Mysterious Heavens, opening the seven gates.
The three hun-souls dance and merge into one form,
The hundred spirits rejoice and return to the boundless.
How to attain this Dao? Where does it reside?
From the primordial valley, fire arises, and the seven spirits take flight.
They enter the body, opening the Mysterious Pass.
Bow twice, strike the breast, and traverse heaven and earth.
Return to the origin, expel evil and rebellion, erase the name of death,
Summon spirits, extend life’s count, and preserve life’s completion.
You may divide your form into billions,
Or reverse your bones to attain celestial immortality.
Silently, within and without, shun all things taboo—
When the ape and horse die, yin returns to yang.
This Dao is secret—do not recklessly transmit it.
Guard it for a billion kalpas, and you will endure forever.
Inscribe it in metal, swear an oath, and present it to the Three Heavens.
If lightly divulged, you will be eternally sealed at the river’s source.
Simply guard your heart, making it firm as stone,
And in a hundred days, your spirits will be complete, and the root of life activated.

**Summoning and Offering to the Spirits of the Body**

The Master said: The master of the body’s duality resides in spirit and qi.
When spirit and qi harmonize, one communicates with the true and reaches the numinous.
If spirit transforms and qi withers, how can prayers be answered?
Moreover, the *Five Numinous Talismans of the Body’s Spirits* and the *Secret Sequence* contain the method for summoning spirits—the foremost of the ten thousand Daoist arts, the precursor to all practices. You should put it into action.
The method: On the day of your birth (jiazi), your life’s origin, and on the second, sixteenth, and last days of the month—five times a month—enter the oratory. Prepare the foods and drinks you favor, along with pure wine and fruits, as offerings.
First, face east and sit upright. Collect the mind, regulate the breath, and concentrate the spirit. After a moment, offer incense three times and knock the teeth twenty-four times.

Recite:
The Perfected of the Cinnabar Heaven,
The Perfected of the Great One,
The Perfected of Peach and Health,
The Tamed Light of the Womb—
The Perfected One,
The Perfected of the Hidden Essence,

The Radiance of the eyes,

The Cinnabar Vermilion of the mouth,
The Cinnabar Emperor of the tongue,
The Guardians of the teeth,
The Mighty Tiger of the throat,

The Joyous One of the heart,
The Watchful One of the liver...

Call their names three times, then recite:
You who emerge from within my body, each take your place before, behind, left, and right, returning to your proper positions. Today is an auspicious day for offering; you may freely partake in food and drink, feasting to your fill and contentment.

After the recitation, visualize the spirits—over a hundred—each resembling yourself, bowing and yielding. The practitioner then partakes of the food and drink, consuming as much as desired, with moderation as the principle.

Again recite:
Now that you are drunk and sated, rejoicing without end, come whenever summoned on auspicious days. On ordinary days, do not depart from me. Foretell all future fortunes and misfortunes before they befall. Know that as long as my body endures, so too shall you. When I am joyful, you share in my joy; when I grieve, you share in my sorrow. Should there be immortal medicines, bring them to me that I may consume them, granting us all eternal life, transformation through ten thousand kalpas, and fulfillment of our pact. Then return to your stations within my body, each to your domain.

Hasten, as the law commands!

The Master says: By sitting in awareness of what is yet to come, one may achieve liberation through the corpse, ascend to the origin, and attain transcendence. This is the foundation. After ten offerings, the practitioner shall receive instruction. After a hundred offerings, one may attain immortality, with golden elixirs, divine mushrooms, and all manner of sustenance made whole.

To reveal even a single word of this is to forfeit a decade of life. Should one fail to achieve efficacy, take heed and do not transmit it recklessly.

**Method for Unbinding Knots and Sealing Dead Gates**

The Master says: The true qi within the human body harmonizes with the qi of the myriad heavens. Born of the womb, one also receives perverse qi, which mingles with the upright without distinction. Thus, within the human body lie twelve knots and thirty-nine dead gates. First, unbind the twelve knots and seal the thirty-nine dead gates, so that one’s true qi may ascend and commune with heaven.

The method for unbinding knots involves reciting the *Scripture for Unbinding Knots*, invoking the qi of the Dao Father and Dao Mother. Begin by unbinding the knots of the lower cinnabar field, then the middle, and finally the upper. The method for sealing dead gates involves reciting the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture*, invoking the upright qi of the thirty-six heavens. Starting from the lower cinnabar field, ascend through the middle to the upper, sequentially invoking the true qi of each heaven to merge with the thirty-nine upright qi of the heavens. Gathered into one body, this is called the Imperial Unity—none other than the true nature of the person, returning to the Yellow Court.

When reciting the scripture, first visualize white qi, then purple qi, emanating from the centers of both palms, both soles, and the navel, swirling around the body and filling the chamber. After encircling the heavens once, it returns to the body, merging with the sun and moon.

The Master said: The three cinnabar fields of a person each contain true earth. Whenever after the hour of *zi*, gather the true qi of the left and right kidneys within the lower cinnabar field’s primordial elixir. Visualize it as five-colored, coiling ninefold, with true nature contained at its center. Employ the method of ten revolutions with intention, sending it upward along the ram’s horns path to reach directly the mud-pill palace. There, the true qi merges, then descends from the jade tower, lingering in the Yellow Court to blend with the heart’s qi. Again, circulate it upward along the spine, tracing the mud-pill palace once more, then descend back to the Yellow Court. Visualize in the Yellow Court a Heavenly Venerable in your own likeness, who imbibes this true qi. From the hours of *zi* and *wu*, perform this method thrice. After the hour of *wu*, instead use the heart’s fire to descend into the Yellow Court, imagining the Heavenly Venerable seated amidst great flames, serene and unmoving, in accordance with the method of sitting in forgetfulness.

**Method of Returning the Breath**
With every exhalation rising from the cinnabar field, visualize the breath received into the Yellow Court, where the Heavenly Venerable swallows it. With every inhalation entering through the nose, likewise visualize the breath received into the Yellow Court, where the Heavenly Venerable swallows it. For all matters of aiding the living and delivering the dead, or any action undertaken, the Heavenly Venerable emerges from the Yellow Court to reside in the mud-pill palace, uniting the qi of the five viscera, all within the Primordial Palace.

**Silent Audience and Refining the Crown**
The Master said: At the three hours of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu* each day, enter stillness. First, refine the crown with the hand seal to open the Heavenly Gate, then transform the spirit. This is the oral transmission of ascent personally bestowed by the Primordial Beginning upon the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct and the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. Keep it secret.

*Jin-yin-zha-chou, jin-chen-zha-mao, da-zhong-li-zhong-shang-quan.*

At noon, emerge—this is governed by the left year. Next, raise both hands in the *jing* mudra, visualize the body as the Perfected White Crane Immortal, and by this method, perceive the Heavenly Gate opening. A white crane arrives; visualize the self mounting the crane and ascending lightly until reaching the summit of the Three Heavens, where the Primordial Beginning’s crown radiates nine-colored golden light, pouring into one’s own crown. Then imagine the myriad apertures of the body streaming with light, illuminating the ten directions of the world. When complete, remount the crane and return to one’s abode. This is the secret oral transmission of the Numinous Treasure received from the Primordial Beginning. When making petitions, prostrate before the royal steps to present them; when submitting memorials, follow this same method.

**The Method of Audience with the Origin**
It is said: When dwelling in peace with no affairs at hand, remain in a quiet chamber, burn incense, and concentrate the spirit so that it does not leave the body—only then may one take flight to attend the Origin. The method of audience with the Origin: visualize the Upper, Middle, and Lower Cinnabar Fields, each with its Heavenly Venerable. Then visualize the Heavenly Venerables of the Middle and Lower Fields, riding five-colored clouds of *qi* together with one’s own spirit from the Yellow Court, ascending through the Crimson Tower until reaching the Mud-Pill Palace. Visualize the three venerables seated in the Jade Bureau, while the self kneels lengthily before them to present matters. When finished, visualize the three venerables from the three realms riding three-colored clouds of *qi* to the Mud-Pill Palace, merging with the Heavenly Venerables of one’s own three fields to form three venerables. Then visualize these three venerables uniting as one, riding five-colored clouds of *qi* to descend through the Crimson Tower and enter the Yellow Court to reside, after which perform the stabilization method.

**True Stillness**
The Master said: The Dao of observing the mind requires inwardly observing the mind until the mind is no-mind. Externally observe the form until the form is no-form. Observe distant things until things are no-things. When these three are realized, only emptiness is seen. Observe emptiness until emptiness is no-emptiness. When the object of emptiness is gone, even no-emptiness is no more. When no-emptiness is no more, there is only profound and constant stillness. Stillness without object—how could desire arise? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness. Responding to things with true constancy, attaining the nature with true constancy, constantly responding and constantly still, one is constantly pure and still. One who can be thus will find the body attaining emptiness and nothingness, the nature returning to the Supreme Ultimate, and may then interact with things and benefit others, transcending the subtle to enter sagehood. This is the correct Dao, and its practice is essential. From this path, one proceeds from non-being into being, practicing the method of merging with the sun and moon, nurturing the sacred embryo to completion. In dreams and waking, there is no difference. Only then may one practice the great *Dong* method of revolving the wind, attaining a sagely body of health and freedom, able to roam the myriad heavens at will and pay homage at the Golden Towers of Emptiness and Nothingness.

**The Method of Sleeping at Night**
The Master said: When retiring, first stretch out the hands and feet and lie supine. Then visualize the five viscera, and afterward visualize the Heavenly Venerable seated serenely in the Yellow Court, radiating great light that illuminates the ten directions. At this moment, forget body and mind, and turn attention inward to observe the original spirit from one’s initial birth—how it congealed, how it daily employed and directed the body, how it lodged within, and how it will one day depart. Ponder this deeply. At first, the spirit’s awareness may be dim, but after a short while, the mind’s ground becomes suddenly clear, sensing the four *qi* at peace, the sun and moon casting their light in dual illumination within the Mysterious Palace. The visualized Heavenly Venerable sits distinctly, without a trace of dust or obscurity. One may hear the wondrous music of the immortal palaces and witness all manner of marvelous and extraordinary sights in the world. However, one must not cling to appearances, lest the spirit drift and wander—this is the clarity of one’s original nature, what the scriptures call “perceiving the Jade Clarity realm in profound stillness.” One must continue practicing the method of merging the sun and moon daily to nurture the original nature, valuing the strength of the yang spirit, which enables instantaneous travel over ten thousand miles. When initial desires arise, one must firmly stabilize body and mind, lest instability lead to madness.

**The Method of Substituting Form to Avert Calamity and Achieve Corpse Liberation at Life’s End**
The Master said: The Dao of the Numinous Treasure possesses a spirit-summoning staff to command the ghostly deities of the Six Heavens and direct the myriad numina of the Three Realms. The method for crafting the staff: select a pure and numinous altar in a blessed mountain, auspicious land, or sacred precinct. On a propitious day, take a sweet bamboo stalk facing the sun, six feet in length with twelve nodes. Choose an *jia-wu*, *bing-wu*, or *ding-mao* day, or the third day of the third month, fifth day of the fifth month, seventh day of the seventh month, or ninth day of the ninth month. On the third node from the top, slightly curve the right side, and on the curved indentation, carve the sun and moon above and the Dipper below. Open a cavity at the top and insert the talisman of the Central Guardian Scribe. Below the second node, open four cavities on the four sides and insert the talismans of the Four Directional Guardian Scribes, sealing them with wax. On the lower portion, carve the names of the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, who respond to transformations across kalpas. When complete, make a yellow silk bag to hold the staff, its length matching the staff. Beginning on the first day, recite the incantation facing the five directions at the corresponding days and hours, drawing in the *qi* of the five directions with breaths. Each night, perform visualization; after a year, when the *qi* is sufficient, the staff may be employed.

Another method: The staff is five feet five inches long with nine nodes. Curve the left side of the second node, and below the third node, open cavities on four sides to insert the talismans of the names of the Five Peaks, filling the interior with the *Middle Chapter of the Numinous Writ*. If used for personal cultivation, insert the Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure into the staff. Another method uses a straight staff without curves.

The method of receiving and maintaining the staff: Keep it with you at all times when sitting, lying, rising, or resting. If there is a place where it cannot be carried, place it in a clean location. After long maintenance, pointing the staff at the heavens will cause celestial deities to pay homage; pointing it at the earth will cause earthly spirits to send off and welcome. Pointing it at the northeast will cause myriad ghosts to bind themselves; pointing it to break open hells will cause the dead to return to life. Whatever calamity or misfortune it points to will collapse and vanish at its command.

With prolonged and devoted practice, the qi stirs deeply—discard your garments and cover the bamboo, and you may conceal your form to enter and exit unseen.

When using the staff to break open hells, suspend a small yellow pennant beneath the second node, seven inches in length. Upon the pennant, inscribe the talisman of the Ten Directions’ Savior Heavenly Worthy and the Ten Celestial Transmutations Talisman. For other applications, such as regular carrying and maintenance, remove the pennant.

For all acts of spiritual work, strike the teeth thirty-six times in succession. Visualize the five Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, each clad in the color of their respective direction, along with the Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors, who attend with staffs and banners, their five-colored radiance streaming upon the staff. Recite the subtle incantation:

On the Mountain of the Great Yang,
The primordial essence of the Original Beginning.
Heaven unfolds, earth extends,
Sweet bamboo channels the numinous.
Direct Talismans and guardian officers,
Divisions of divine soldiers stand guard.
Five hues flow and gleam,
Crimson robes and golden tassels.
Assisting the Two Perfected,
Exiting darkness, entering shadow.
Summoning heaven, heaven bows;
Commanding earth, earth welcomes.
Pointing at ghosts, ghosts perish;
Demons and malevolent spirits bind themselves.
Numinous talisman, divine staff,
Mighty dominion over the ten thousand directions.
With me they complete,
With me they arise.
After ten thousand kalpas,
They take my form in my stead.
This is the Fivefold Liberation,
Ascending as an immortal to the Upper Clarity.
By the talisman’s decree and command,
None dare disobey.

After reciting the incantation, draw in the true qi of the five directions, swallowing thirty-six times to conclude. Alternatively, on the Three Primes, the eight solar terms, one’s birth date, or other auspicious days, perform the practice with reverence: burn incense, bow in homage, and recite the mantra. With daily devotion, undiminished spirit, and unwavering focus, the divine perfected will manifest in form, and the staff shall bear one aloft in flight. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, the staff may temporarily assume one’s form—suddenly, in the blink of an eye, one becomes a perfected immortal.

The Way of the Fivefold Liberation is the true void of the Five Phases, seizing the balance of the Northern Dipper, escaping the calamity of death, achieving liberation through the corpse, and ascending as a spirit to the Upper Clarity.

Here ends *The Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites, Scroll Five*.
*Scroll Six of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites*
Compiled by Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity, Ordained Master of the Numinous Treasure Tradition, under the transmission of Master Xiao Quan-Zhen, the Illuminating and Salvific Perfected of the Cavernous Subtlety, High Daoist of the Luminous Dawn

At that time, during the Primordial Radiance Era, the Most High commanded the Heavenly August Person to transmit the True Rites of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, pacifying the myriad heavens, establishing the texts of Qian and Kun, regulating the stars, sun, and moon, and founding the ten thousand heavens. All the myriad sages and the myriad kinds of beings received the formation of the Most High’s Numinous Treasure and the true *qi* of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, thereby attaining generation and completion. Each followed its inherent nature to receive its name.

This rite can deliver the myriad spirits of heaven and earth, as well as all Perfected and Sages who attain the Dao, for all receive the great *qi* of the True Rites of the Inner Sounds and the Great Brahma, thereby accomplishing the Great Dao. Scholars who practice this will all attain the Dao of ascension, for all Great Sages achieve sageliness through the True Rites of the Inner Sounds.

The Master said: In heaven above and earth below, those who obtain this sound can dispel all, exorcise all, deliver all, and accomplish all. This is the natural sound of the Heavenly Perfected, called the True Rites of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens, which naturally establishes heaven and earth, Qian and Kun. If one encounters this rite, one must align above with earth, harmonize within with humanity, and further ensure that one’s actions are square and round, words do not harm beings, and one constantly practices the Dao of self-denial to save others. Only then can one practice the True Rites of the Inner Sounds of the Heavens and naturally attain the Dao of ascending to heaven. It is said that the August Lords of the Heavens, the various Kings, and the myriad Sages all achieve the ranks of Transcendent Officials through this rite. The True Rite is wondrous and weighty; the heavens unite in its merit. The heavens deliver beings, and this treasure is not transmitted lightly. In the world below, it is called the Rite of Inner Sounds, for the Primordial Heavenly Worthy transmits it to the world once every forty thousand kalpas. These eight characters of sound are the ancestral models of the heavens. It is said that this sound is the Dao of ascending to heaven, the root of entering sageliness, the gate of longevity, and the path to the heavens above. If one encounters this sound even once in ten thousand kalpas, one’s body attains the Dao and ascends to heaven, and one can further deliver the nine ancestors and seven generations, all attaining the Dao of divine transcendence. It is said that all Sages and Perfected, both in heaven and on earth, achieve the Dao of High Perfection through this rite. Thus, it is said: This sound delivers countless beings, serving as the ancestral root of the myriad Dao. Those who attain the Dao and become Perfected are as numerous as raindrops and mist; their merits and calculations are beyond reckoning. This rite has descended to the world once every four million years since ancient times. Those who encounter it traverse the Three Realms alone, ascend through the Golden Gate, and share the same lifespan as heaven.

In cultivating the Great Dao, one must always practice compassion to save all beings. Let beings be without attachment, purify the heart, be upright and solemn, free from deceit or crookedness. Cleanse the self and fast the mind, constantly contemplate all virtues. In speech with others, always be humble and harmonious. Your actions should align with heaven and earth, your words should not harm *qi*. Do not consume meat or fresh delicacies, nor take the lives of beings. Regard others’ lives as your own, others’ faults as your own, and others’ transgressions as if pondering the names of your parents.

Only when encountering such a person may one transmit the Inner Sounds of the Heavens and the method of ascending. For this method is most divine and sacred, transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas. Those who encounter it in this world are those with the innate capacity to ascend to heaven. By forgetting the self and wearing these sounds, one will naturally ascend to the Upper Clarity, with the myriad spirits in attendance, earth spirits guarding the gate, one’s name inscribed in the Upper Clarity. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one will ascend to heaven in broad daylight. Guard this secret, be cautious, and do not transmit it to the unworthy.

**The Five Sprouts True Writ**
The Master said: The Numinous Treasure possesses the Five Directions’ True Talismans of the Crimson Writ of Ancestral *Qi*, the Numinous Treasure of Heaven. Within the human body, they govern the inner growth of the five-colored numinous mushrooms and externally summon the cloud sprouts of the five directions to harmonize *qi*, which are the true fluids and true waters. In heaven, they are the Five Venerable Thearchs; in the scriptures, they coalesce *qi* into writ, known as the Five Sprouts True Writ. In the five directions, they are the Five Thearchs; in the celestial patterns, they are the Five Stars; in terrestrial principles, they are the Five Peaks; in affairs, they are the Five Constants; in things, they are the Five Phases; and within the human body, they are the Five Viscera. In practicing the Dao of the Numinous Treasure and the method of the Grotto Chamber, one ingests the life-*qi* of the Five Directions’ true and upright to refine the mortal body. How wondrous!

**The Green Sprout True Writ** – twelve characters
**The Crimson Sprout True Writ** – twelve characters

**The White Sprout True Writ** – twelve characters
**The Black Sprout True Writ** – twelve characters
**The Yellow Sprout True Writ** – sixteen characters

The Five *Qi* and Five Sprout True Writs above are to be inscribed in cinnabar upon two tablets of gold-lacquered black radiance, then employed in the practice of invoking *qi*. After completing the morning audience and reciting the Grotto Chapters internally, they may be put to use. The method requires facing the direction, knocking the teeth, and swallowing saliva thrice; the heart bows in three prostrations. Emit the true ascent upon the rainbow of a hundred flowers, where cinnabar-red spirits welcome you. With the tongue, lick and dissolve the five-colored darkness, swallowing it into the Double Towers, sending it to the Crimson Palace. There it transforms into brocade-like patterns of the Five Directions, interweaving into talismans. The Five Sprout primordial *qi* is the embryonic body of numinous fluid. This is the ancestral *qi* of the Numinous Treasure within the body—scholars ought to practice it diligently.

**Wearing the True Writs**
The Master said: The method of internal refinement with the Five Sprouts invokes the Five Thearchs and Five Numinous Ones to descend in truth, and by wearing the True Writs, their spirits reside within the Five Viscera to summon the essence of the Five Sprouts.

Regularly at the *Lichun* day’s cockcrow, enter the chamber, face east, and bow nine times. Sit upright, knock the teeth nine times, and visualize the Eastern Azure Thearch, Numinous Might Spirit, who governs spring and presides over the east’s generative *qi*. His body is nine inches tall, crowned with azure jade, clad in nine-*qi* azure feathered robes. He rides a chariot drawn by green dragons, bearing a banner of *xu* and *hu*, accompanied by ninety myriad officials of *jia-yi* and Hu Elder, descending in an instant. They transform and generate azure *qi*, like clouds pouring over one’s body, entering through one’s mouth and descending directly into the Liver Palace. Next, visualize Jupiter blazing brightly in the east, illuminating one’s body. Open the mouth, recite the incantation nine times, draw in nine breaths of eastern *qi*, swallow saliva, and ingest the Eastern True Writ of twelve characters.

**Incantation:**

His body is three inches tall, crowned with vermilion jade, clad in three-*qi* crimson feathered robes. He rides a chariot drawn by cinnabar dragons, bearing a jade banner of *cai* and *xu*, accompanied by thirty myriad officials of *bing-ding* and Yue Elder, descending in an instant to illuminate one’s body. Next, visualize Mars blazing brightly in the south, illuminating one’s form.

Eternally enjoying boundless bliss.
Body generates water and fire,
Transforming in a hundred ways.

Always at the *liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) day’s hour of the cock’s crow, face west and bow seven times. Sit upright, click the teeth seven times, and visualize the White Thearch of the West, Bai Zhaoju, who governs autumn and presides over the *qi* of generation in the west. His body stands seven inches tall, crowned with a white jade coronet, clad in a robe of sevenfold white *qi* and feathered raiment. He rides a jade chariot drawn by white dragons, bearing a plain banner, and is attended by seventy myriad officials of Geng-Xin and the Mysterious Elders. In an instant, they descend, transforming into white *qi* like clouds that suddenly envelop one’s body, entering through the mouth and descending straight into the Lung Palace.

Next, visualize the Metal Star blazing bright in the west, illuminating one’s body. Then open the eyes, recite the incantation seven times, draw in seven breaths of western *qi*, swallow saliva, and ingest the Western True Writ of twelve characters.

**Incantation:**
Seven gates of golden clouds,
Resplendent and luminous in the Western Flower.
Within abides the Plain Thearch,
The abode of the Primordial Origin.
Riding a chariot of white dragons,

The Supreme Thearch of the Nine Heavens bestows
Jade blossoms upon me.
Preserving years and halting whitening,
A visage of flourishing splendor.
Abiding as long as heaven and earth,
In harmony with the Three Luminaries.
Always at the *lidong* (Beginning of Winter) day’s hour of the cock’s crow, enter the chamber, face north, and bow five times. Sit upright, click the teeth five times, and visualize the Black Thearch of the North, Xu Guangji, who governs winter and presides over the *qi* of generation in the north. His body stands five inches tall, crowned with a dark jade coronet, clad in a robe of fivefold dark *qi* and feathered raiment. He rides a jade chariot drawn by black dragons, bearing a black banner, and is attended by fifty myriad officials of Ren-Gui and the Qiang Elders. In a moment, they descend, generating black *qi* like clouds, resembling the light of shooting stars that envelop one’s body, entering through the mouth and descending straight into the Kidney Palace.

Next, visualize the Water Star blazing bright in the north, illuminating one’s body. Then open the eyes, recite the incantation five times, draw in five breaths of northern *qi*, swallow saliva, and ingest the Northern True Writ of twelve characters.

**Incantation:**

In an instant, they descend, transforming into yellow *qi* like clouds that envelop one’s body, entering through the mouth and descending straight into the Spleen Palace.

Next, visualize the Earth Star shining at the center, illuminating one’s body. Then close the eyes, recite the incantation twelve times, draw in twelve breaths of central *qi*, swallow saliva, and ingest the Central True Writ of sixteen characters.

**Incantation:**

Revolving and roaming the turning jade.
Radiant and bright as the Seven Stars,
Streaming light and scattering brilliance.
Jade blossoms and fragrant mushrooms,
Overflowing and flying in all four directions.
Irrigating my body,
The Spleen Palace shines and opens.
Nurturing sprouts and feasting on essence,
The myriad spirits all return.
Restraining the hun and controlling the po,
Refining the Eight Powers of immortality.
Within and without, thoroughly purified,
Ever-living and unaging.
Communing with the true and reaching the numinous,
Ascending into the Grand Tenuity.

**Method for Ingesting the Cloud-Liquid of Numinous Mushrooms**
The Master said: In spring and summer, first ingest the cloud-liquid, then the primordial *qi*. In autumn and winter, first ingest the primordial *qi*, then the cloud-liquid.

For regular practice, at the hour of the cock’s crow when yang light first divides, face the southeast, and click the teeth according to the number of each direction: nine for the east, three for the south, seven for the west, five for the north, and twelve for the center. Rub the palms together until warm, then wipe the face and eyes. Recite the incantation according to the number of each direction, beginning from the east and circling once. Then sequentially drink and ingest the true liquid of the Five Sprouts.

The Five Sprouts are as follows:

**Eastern Green Sprout:**
Green sprout of the east,
Purple clouds streaming auroras.
Ingest the green sprout,
Drinking the dawn’s blossom.
The green sprout is the liver; the dawn’s blossom is the root of the upper teeth.
Use the tongue to stroke the inside of the upper teeth, lick the lips three times, rinse the mouth until the Jade Spring fills it, and swallow nine times. Then draw in nine breaths of green *qi* to settle within the liver.

**Southern Vermilion Cinnabar:**
Vermilion cinnabar, radiant and wandering.
Ingest the vermilion cinnabar,
Drinking from the Cinnabar Pool.
The vermilion cinnabar is the heart; the Cinnabar Pool is the root of the lower teeth.
Use the tongue to stir the inside of the lower teeth, lick the lips three times, rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills it, and swallow three times. Then draw in three breaths of red *qi* to settle within the heart.

**Western Luminous Stone:**
Luminous stone of the west,
Resplendent and complete in numinous essence.
Ingest the luminous stone,
Drinking the numinous liquid.
The luminous stone is the lung; the numinous liquid is the essence of the lips’ exterior.
Use the tongue to stroke the outside of the upper teeth, lick the lips three times, rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills the river, and swallow seven times. Then draw in seven breaths of white *qi* to settle within the lung.

**Northern Mysterious Nourishment:**
Mysterious nourishment of the north,
Dark pearls moistening and enriching.
Ingest the mysterious nourishment,
Drinking the Jade Syrup.
The mysterious nourishment is the kidney; the Jade Syrup is the tongue.
Use the tongue to stroke the inside of the lower teeth, lick the lips three times, rinse the mouth until the Jade Mushroom fills it, inhale and exhale, then swallow five times.

Then draw in five breaths of black *qi* through the nose and swallow them to settle within the kidney.

**Central Mysterious Nourishment of Wu-Earth and Ji-Earth:**
Lofty and towering, the Great Mount,
Ingesting *qi* to guard essence,
Drinking the Sweet Spring.
One name is Jade Bloom, another Golden Root,
Or gazing upward at the Great Mount.
Wu-Earth and Ji-Earth are the spleen; the Great Mount is the forehead.
Use the tongue to stroke the inside and outside of the upper and lower teeth, lick the lips three times, rinse the mouth until the Jade Spring fills it, and swallow twelve times. Then draw in twelve breaths of yellow *qi* to settle within the spleen.

When this is complete, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow *qi* thirty-five times, and recite the unifying incantation. The incantation says:
*"White jade flows in succession,
The source spring surges like jade syrup.
Drink it to attain long life,
And extend your lifespan."*
After reciting the incantation, use the tongue to stroke the center of the upper and lower teeth, allowing the Jade Mushroom to fill the mouth, and swallow three times. Draw in *qi* twenty-five times, swallowing it to the fullest extent, and the Dao is complete.

This method is practiced at midnight (*zi* hour) and dawn (*yin* hour). At other times—*mao*, *you*, *wu*, *shen*, *si*, *hai*, and the four earthly branches—only ingest one *Lingya* Jade Liquid.

**Method for Ingesting Primordial *Qi*:**
Whenever ingesting primordial *qi*, close the mouth.
Curl the tongue, draw in *qi* through the nose until the mouth is full, then puff the cheeks and swallow.
At midnight: eighty-one swallows.
At dawn: sixty-four swallows.
At mealtime: forty-nine swallows.
At noon: thirty-six swallows.
At dusk: twenty-five swallows.
At twilight: sixteen swallows.
At other times: twenty-four swallows.
Practicing this method for a hundred days can transform the bones and alter one’s form. After a year, natural clarity of vision returns, aging is reversed, and one may ascend on clouds to become an immortal, awaiting with ease.

After ingesting *qi* and swallowing saliva at each appointed time, write the *Yuying* Spirit-Transformation Talisman nine times on bamboo membrane with cinnabar, swallow it with saliva, and visualize one’s spirit as an infant within the cinnabar field. After two years, it resides in the heart; after three years, in the *Niwan* palace. Practice this alongside the previous internal audience method.

After three years, one may divide their form at will, with boundless subtle wonders and limitless adaptability. The natural *qi* and fluids will follow and circulate accordingly. Beyond three years, fire responds and water attends, aligning with heaven and earth in yin and yang, and with the sun and moon in creation. After nine years, the Five Elders descend to welcome the adept’s ascent to heaven in broad daylight.

The Master says: Within heaven and earth, the sage attains the Dao, the worthy attains its methods, and the wise attain its protection—all through the convergence of heaven and earth’s essence to perfect their truth. Thus, the Dao cannot be sought through words, its methods cannot be sought through emotion, nor its protection through intent. All things follow heaven and earth’s transformations to return to spontaneity.

*Illuminating the Three Luminaries*
The Master says: The Numinous Treasure contains the method of *Illuminating the Three Luminaries*. At sunrise, the adept should calm their heart, face the sun, and recite the *Yuyi* incantation:

Incantation:
*"Sun soul, vermilion radiance,
Shining unity veiled in emerald light."*

Vermilion Lads Returning Radiance, Dark Flame Whirlwind Manifests.
Upon completing the incantation, draw the sun’s purple rays through the nose, swallowing eighty-one times.

At moonrise, calm the heart, face the moon, and recite the *Jielin* incantation:

Incantation:
*"Moon soul, misty and vast,
Fragrant splendor veiled in desolation.
Gentle void, numinous orchid,
Lush blossoms entwine and rise.
Pure gold, limpid and bright,
Fiery countenance, towering and radiant."*

Upon completion, draw the moon’s yellow-hued *qi* through the nose, swallowing one hundred twenty times.

At the first night’s *xu*-end hour, gaze upward toward the Dipper’s pivot and recite the Northern Dipper’s secret name:
*[Seven characters obscured.]*
Upon completion, draw the Northern Dipper’s seven stars’ golden light through the mouth, swallowing forty-nine times.

Next, ingest the *Zhongyuan Three Luminaries Primordial Illumination True Talisman*, inscribed in cinnabar on bamboo membrane, forming nine strokes, and swallow with saliva.
Ingesting the solar talisman is forbidden after noon; the lunar talisman is forbidden before the first quarter and after the last quarter; the Dipper talisman is forbidden on *chen* and *xu* days.

By ingesting these Three Luminaries’ true *qi*, one may return essence to restore the embryo, immediately reverse aging to regain youth, exhale and blow away myriad illnesses at will, and cure them. All demons bow in submission, jade maidens attend the body. Without awaiting ascension, after three years of practice, one receives the scripture and becomes a *Three Luminaries Perfected*.

**Zhongyuan Three Luminaries Mystic Illumination True Talisman**
The Master says: The Three Luminaries Talismans are the true *qi* of the Three Lights, the orthodox Dao of Supreme Clarity. All are inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper.
Men ingest the *Yuyi* Talisman; women ingest the *Jielin* Talisman. Those afflicted by malevolent spirits take the *Zhongyuan* Dipper form. In critical conditions, combine the three talismans into one and swallow; immediately, metal generates form, flesh is restored, complexion renewed, and bones transformed. With prolonged ingestion, one attains longevity and may also ascend in flight.

**Yuyi Talisman**
Visualize a square-round form with nine rays of purple light.
Left: nine coils of the sun soul’s vermilion radiance, *Li* *qi* at the upper joint of the middle finger.

**Jielin Talisman**
Visualize a square-round form with ten rays of white light.
Right: ten coils of the moon soul’s misty vastness, *Qian* *qi* at the upper joint of the fourth finger.

**Zhongyuan Dipper Form**
*[Seven characters obscured.]* From *xu* to *chen*, trace the governing luminaries; winter solstice at *xu*, summer solstice at *hai*.

**Combined Form**
The Greater Yang and Greater Yin, along with detailed stellar calculations, follow the days’ progression as recorded in the almanac.

**Refining and Ingesting the Three Luminaries**

The Master said: At sunrise, form the Jade Emperor mudra with both hands, join palms, and face the sun while reciting the Solar Lord Incantation:

*Incantation:*
Spirit of Yuyi, true essence of the *Li* Palace.
Irrigate and ingest the nine rays—*Qian*’s origin, upright and flourishing.

After reciting, inhale *qi* through the nose nine times, swallowing and directing it with intent to the Cinnabar Prime, repeating two nines, three nines, up to nine nines—eighty-one cycles. Then pray:

*Oṃ yu-pan-li yu zhen-yuan hui.*
*Vajra-[...]-ra-yung-[...]-li svāhā.*

After reciting, ingest *qi* as before.

At moonrise, form the Jade Emperor mudra with both hands, join palms, and face the moon while reciting the Lunar Lady Incantation:

*Incantation:*
Lady Jielin, true essence of the *Kan* position.
Round radiance of eight rays—auspicious, primal, and prosperous.

After reciting, inhale *qi* through the nose eight times, swallowing and directing it with intent to the Cinnabar Prime, repeating eight eights—sixty-four cycles. Then recite:

*Oṃ jie-heng-[...]-heng-[...]-lang.*
*Vajra ming-ra-[...]-ra svāhā.*

After reciting, ingest *qi* as before. Perform this only from the ninth day after the waxing crescent to the sixteenth or seventeenth day after the waning crescent.

At starlight, form the Jade Emperor mudra with both hands, join palms, and face the direction of the Celestial Pivot while reciting the Celestial Pivot Incantation:

*Incantation:*
*Oṃ* spirit of the Dipper, true essence of the Northern Culmen.
Flowing radiance of seven rays—*hūṃ*, roaring, congealing power.

After reciting, inhale *qi* through the nose seven times, swallowing and directing it with intent to the Cinnabar Prime, repeating seven sevens—forty-nine cycles. Then recite:

*Oṃ hūṃ hūṃ mi-li nu-na po-lo xiu-li ti-cha-li hūṃ.*

After reciting, ingest *qi* as before. Perform this only during the *xu* and *hai* hours; at other times, do not practice. This method refines the Three Luminaries into form. On overcast or rainy days, it cannot be performed.

Upon completing the ingestion of the Three Luminaries, strike the teeth nine times and withdraw.

**Ingesting the Three Luminaries Talisman**

The Master said: On every third seventh day, form the Dipper mudra with both hands, face the Heavenly Gate, pace the Northern Dipper’s *qi* path, turn to face south, and ingest the Three Luminaries Talisman. Recite the Three Secret Names of the Supreme Emperor:

*Mysterious Concealed Qi, Heaven’s Mandate Endures, Mortals Ever Peaceful.*

After reciting, bow twice, swallow the talisman with fresh water, bow again, and recite the General Incantation:

*Incantation:*
Ancestral Dao, Mysterious True, resplendent and majestic divine.
Yuyi restores essence; Mars commands form.
Vermilion brightness harmonizes Yang—governing, prohibiting, mighty spirit.
Radiant luminaries, ancestral soaring—Emperor’s doubled brilliance.
*Wu-Ji*’s flourishing glory, Central Star’s guardian.
Sweep away perverse *qi*, shatter and dissolve wanton essence.
Seas encountering it boil; metals, melt.
Woods, reduced to ash; fires, extinguished to void.
Lord of the Eternal *Li*, commanding and seizing flying traces.
*Mi-li nu-na, oṃ oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*
Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea, encompassing and deploying nets.
*Mi-li nu-na, oṃ oṃ hūṃ hūṃ.*

After reciting, visualize the *qi* of the Three Luminaries irrigating the Three Fields. This incantation is also used for the Nine Talismans.

**Jade Tone’s Qi-Seizing Numinous Writ**

Ancestral Dao, Mysterious True, majestic and resplendent divine.
Yuyi restores essence; Mars commands form.
Vermilion brightness harmonizes Yang—governing, prohibiting, mighty spirit.
Radiant luminaries, ancestral soaring—Emperor’s doubled brilliance.
*Wu-Ji*’s flourishing glory, Central Star’s guardian.
Sweep away perverse darkness, shatter and dissolve wanton essence.
Seas encountering it boil; metals, melt.
Woods, reduced to ash; fires, extinguished to void.
Lord of the Eternal *Li*, commanding and seizing flying traces.

**Jade Tone’s Qi-Seizing Numinous Writ (continued)**

Mired in confusion, *nuna* weeps and wails.
The Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea spreads his net wide.
Mired in confusion, *nuna*—*om*, *om*, *hum*, *hum*.

The Master says: At sunrise, face the sun. First visualize the five viscera clearly, then silently recite the numinous verses of the Jade Tone. Seize *qi* and blow it once, then turn your mouth toward the sunlight and resist swallowing nine times. Recite the verses again, close your eyes, and draw a long breath through the nose, silently counting nine swallows. Visualize the sun’s nine rays of purple light descending into the cinnabar field, taking the form of the sun. The more repetitions performed before noon, the greater the merit—this practice must not be done after noon.

Until the third night, when the moon first appears, follow the method for drawing lunar *qi*: close your eyes, inhale through the nose, and swallow ten times. Visualize the moon’s ten rays of white light descending into the cinnabar field, where it merges halfway with the sun’s form. After the twenty-third day, do not draw it again.

Lunar *qi* is equal to solar *qi*, totaling ten thousand repetitions. In spring, first draw the virtue of Wood; in summer, the virtue of Fire; in autumn, the virtue of Metal; in winter, the virtue of Water. During the four seasons’ earthly ascendance, draw the *qi* of each direction’s color, also totaling ten thousand repetitions.

Every five days in a month, follow the method of the Cavernous Chapters to draw the purple *qi* from the Dipper ten thousand times—this is called the "Outer Attendant’s Eight-Jewel Elixir." At one thousand repetitions, divine light appears and vanishes in the night moon. At two thousand, the body radiates light. At three thousand, the entire chamber is illuminated. At four thousand, old ailments, new illnesses, scars, and lingering roots all vanish, and one’s complexion reverts to that of an infant. At five thousand, the Earth Bureau erases one’s name from the register of death, and the Jade Clarity records one as a student of the Dao, with a hundred spirits in attendance. At six thousand, the entire body shines with penetrating light, allowing fine script to be read at night from a hundred paces; ghosts and spirits cannot hide, and the future is foreknown. At seven thousand, breath can revive the dead. At eight thousand, exhaled commands transform the Five Metals into supreme treasures, their light forming perfect spheres. At nine thousand, the elixir matures like the sun, the face takes on a golden countenance, the bones exude five fragrances, and the Three Heavens register one as an immortal. At ten thousand, the Dao is perfected, and one ascends as a Perfected Person.

**Inner Audience at the Three Heavens’ Golden Palaces: Invoking Perfected Ones and Summoning Spirits**

The Master says: The great method encompasses the Dao of invoking Perfected Ones and summoning spirits, the subtleties of *qi*-induced generation and transformation, and the transformations of Perfected and numinous beings ascending and descending. Through breath and seated practice, one commands the service of countless Perfected Immortals, with nothing beyond reach. First, one transforms the inner self, then directs the myriad realms, moving in harmony with nature, illuminating the Three Luminaries. The great circulation of Brahmanic *qi* pervades the ten directions, forging the mysterious and entering the wondrous—truly, this is the boundless expanse above the Great Veil, the Dao of the Ten Revolutions of Returning Spirit.

To seek this Dao externally is like climbing a tree to catch a fish—vainly expending spirit and *qi*. Those who study immortality must refine within and temper without, aiding the manifest and delivering the hidden, beginning with this practice. One must petition for descent, conducting an inner audience at the Three Luminaries’ celestial palaces, flying to the Perfected to pay homage to the Emperor—this is the functional application of uniting spirit with the Dao.

For the sake of state and people, to pray for blessings and dispel misfortune, to refine and transform yin souls, to perform the great *Huanglu* fast, to present memorials and submit petitions, to register and beseech divine favor—one must inwardly recite the mysterious repayment, lest one fall from the great affinity.

The method of application: After bathing and entering the oratory, regulate spirit and rectify *qi*, whether sitting or kneeling. First, refine the Six Palaces within, then open the Eight Gates above, circulate the Three Palaces in the center, and connect below to the inner portals. Order the Five *Qi*, harmonizing the hundred spirits. Next, ascend the rainbow’s golden bridge to reach the Dipper within the Central Heaven. From the Central Heaven, ascend the bridge directly to the Three Heavens, or pay homage to the Three Treasures and the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Emperor. The Three Officials, Five Masters, Grand Unity, and Southern Culmen’s Venerable Master—all employ this method to manifest the mysterious repayment.

The Dao of the Numinous Treasure primarily relies on refining and reciting with spirit and *qi* to pay homage, enabling the adept to rank among the immortal officials and attend the Perfected in the Golden Palace. If recklessly misapplied, it will merely mislead the living and the dead, shorten one’s lifespan, and incur punishment. The mysterious statutes are fixed, and violating the prohibitions invites transmission.

The method states: Circulate the Perfected from the Cinnabar Palace to the Crimson Palace, then ascend to the Hall of Light, gazing upward at the Three Heavens. Ascend and transform, beginning with the Eastern Qingwei Heaven, and present the memorial according to the method, returning to the myriad spirits. First, silently recite the *Secret Chapters of the Jade Clarity’s Descent of the Perfected and Audience at the Origin*, then ingest the true talismans of the Three Heavens and Three Realms. Next, recite the *Secret Chapters of the Inner Audience at the Golden Palace*.

**Secret Chapters of the Jade Clarity’s Descent of the Perfected and Audience at the Origin**
The talismans of the Supreme Clarity summon the myriad spirits.
Numinous light illuminates universally, the Three Realms are pervaded with clarity.
The jade talismans descend in flight, harmonizing with the imperial court.
Your servant now petitions, ascending to the Jade Clarity.
Clouds and mist ascend in flight, ceaselessly, moment by moment.
Directly ascending the Jade Palace, merging with the Dao.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Clarity’s Supreme Emperor decrees!*

The *Ten Heavens’ Formula* emerges from the Supreme Clarity, circulating and transforming to invoke the Perfected and summon the Numinous Treasure talismans. Flying smoke scatters like brocade, penetrating the Three Heavens above and below, forming a seven-jeweled golden tower and jade hall, resplendently arrayed and reflected before one’s eyes. Again, from the Three Palaces, issue the Jade Clarity’s formula. In the censer, the myriad hosts descend together.

**Secret Chapters of the Inner Audience at the Three Heavens’ Golden Palace**
The Supreme Unity of the Upper Origin guards the Muddy Pellet.
The Director of Destinies of the Middle Origin sits securely in the Crimson Palace.
The Peach and Health of the Lower Origin, in the Palace of Life, hold the registers.
The Noble Youth of Primordial Brilliance, the Venerable White Prime.
At the first recitation of the jade verses, the myriad spirits attend in welcome.
The ancestral *qi* of the Jade Clarity merges with the Dao and becomes true.
The Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy descends the Dao and flies the spirit.
Ascending and transforming, subtly penetrating, directly paying homage to the Jade Emperor’s court.
The left and right attendants and guards stride into the imperial court.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Clarity’s Supreme Emperor decrees!*

After reciting the secret incantation, swallow saliva three times. From both armpits, emit and circulate spirit to unite with the Dao. Golden light bursts forth from the two palaces, infusing the talismans of the Three Realms. With the tongue, guide the gaze to receive *qi* and ingest the talismans.

**Ingesting the Talismans of the Three Realms**
The spirit and *qi* are pure, ascending to receive the Three Clarities.
The Six Dings and Six Jias wield merciless swords of authority.

The Great Dao is spontaneous, delivering and ferrying all beings.
The jade talismans infuse the brush, paying homage to the Perfected.
A thousand evils lie hidden, ten thousand demons shatter their forms.
Fire bells and celestial stems, White Beasts and Golden Essences.
Circulating in guard, valiantly presiding over the Three Clarities.
The Jade Talismans of the Supreme Emperor descend to pacify the body.
Wicked demons and treacherous fiends—where the Dao’s *qi* abides, they endure no longer.
Transforming and ascending, ascending to the imperial court.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Supreme Emperor decrees!*

Form the Ten Heavens mudra with both hands, blow and disperse the ancestral *qi*, roll the talisman with the tongue, moisten with saliva, and swallow. Soaring and transforming, ascend through the thirty-two heavens; upon descending the seat, receive the Perfected.
**Incantation for Receiving the Perfected**
Heavenly spirits of the Nine Palaces, Great One guards the chamber.
A hundred spirits assume their stations, soul and spirit secure in well-being.
Long life and enduring vision, radiant as the sun and moon.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees command!*

This incantation was proclaimed by the Golden Mouth; the August One inscribed it to transmit to the humble. One must follow its instructions in practice to seek the mysterious reward. If one cultivates and petitions on one’s own, the hundred spirits merge in harmony, illuminating the ten directions. No calamities shall approach, and divine luminaries shall guard the gate.

You should refine your conduct to summon the Perfected and ascend the Dao. When practicing, first form the Jade Clarity mudra with the right hand and the Five Peaks mudra with the left.
Red apricot, black ink of *mao*, true grind of *wu*, intestines of *you*, Numinous Treasure of *zi*. The Chinese responds to transformation.

Silently recite three times, then expel the five directions’ blackness—do not release *qi*, but press it down with the *qi* of the five directions. If one’s learning lacks sincerity, the Five Peaks will test the practitioner. Be cautious, be cautious.

**Green Emperor’s Talisman for Guarding the Hun-Soul**
**Incantation:**
Master of the Five Phases, Celestial Controller of the Nine Heavens.
Verdant Yang’s creation, resplendent and radiant.
Flying clouds form the script, wind-horses soar in obedience.
Mists and vapors waft auspiciously, nurturing the Yang spring.
Wood Palace’s great kindness, guarding and protecting the liver’s *hun*.
This talisman shields the three *hun* of those who attain the Dao, enabling their spiritual communion and clarity.

**Incantation:**
Reverently summon the liver as the Azure Palace’s Lord of Non-Being, Ruler of the *Hun*, essence of Lesser Yang and Wood, the reverse of Jupiter’s star. Receive and transform it within the body to generate the liver. The three *hun* reside therein, with nine wood spirits and nine thousand divine officials. Swiftly descend true *qi* to nourish and defend the skin, governing every hair.

**Incantation for Treating Liver Ailments Where the *Hun* Does Not Attach to the Body**
The Green Emperor guards the *hun*, securing and presiding over the Three Palaces.
Inscribe in green on yellow paper, with *zhen* script, eastern *qi*. Swallow and wear it; avoid sour and pungent flavors for nine days.

On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), receive this. If to be swallowed, inscribe upon three sheets of bamboo membrane. If to be worn, inscribe upon white silk.

**Hymn of the Azure Emperor’s Talisman**
Facing east, bow twice with hands clasped:
Azure Emperor, Jade Sovereign Lord.
Divine winds stir the sacred keys,
Nurturing all things in primal spring.
Cloud-dragons harness the solemn chariot,
Jade guards escort the jasper wheel.
Withered sprouts awash in bounty,
Great kindness spreads without exception.
Myriad immortals chant the Dao,
In intricate counsel admonishing gods and men.
The root of the heart, deluded, clings fast—
Yet all bow beneath vast benevolence.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Emperor for Nurturing *Qi***

**Incantation:**
Five *qi* revolve and traverse,
All lungs interpenetrate.
The sun moves the dark pearl,
Light courses through the radiant peak.
The Three Palaces ascend and descend,
Endlessly circulating.
Resplendent solar essence,
Giving rise to the ten thousand things.
The Purple Chamber merges as one,
Nine *hun* refined to purity.
Clad in vermilion, cinnabar begins;
Xiaoren’s terrace commences.
Flowing through blood and *qi*,
Returning to the womb’s fiery court.

This talisman governs fire and nurtures primordial *qi*.
The Yellow Emperor said: “Raging fire consumes, gentle fire generates *qi*; warmth must come first for nurturance.”

**Incantation:**
Reverently summon the heart as the Crimson Palace’s Supreme Unity, Controller of Destiny, essence of Greater Yang and Fire, the *qi* of Mars. Receive and transform it within the body to generate the left heart. To its left dwells the Jade Youth, to its right the Jade Maiden; three fire spirits and three thousand attending officials reside therein, governing its domain, nourishing and defending the palaces and organs, presiding over *hun* and *po*.

**Incantation for Treating Heart Ailments Where *Qi* is Insufficient**
The Vermilion Emperor nurtures *qi*,
All spirits return to the body.

Inscribe in vermilion on black paper, with *wu* script, southern *qi*. Swallow and wear it; avoid bitter flavors for three days, and recovery will follow.

On the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer), receive this. If to be swallowed, inscribe upon two sheets of bamboo membrane. If to be worn, inscribe upon yellow silk.

**Hymn of the Vermilion Emperor’s Talisman**
The grand scene unfolds the jade pivot,
The cavernous hall opens its golden eaves.
The soaring forest shades the jasper steps,
Crimson simurghs tread upon pearls.
The treasure chamber, named for its exquisite beauty,
Is where the radiant gods reside.
Wandering freely along cloud-kissed paths,
The gaze lingers upon the true capital.
The celestial sun never sets,
Thick mist veils the azure hut.
Heaven’s seal is unsealed,
Cypress tablets array the sacred writ.
The wind of virtue plants the mysterious transformation,
Yin and Xin surely abound.

**Talisman of the White Emperor for Attending the *Po***

**Incantation:**

**White Qi** blends with primordial chaos,
Spirits of the Three Qi.
Exhaling azure into the profound,
Pervading my body with luminous clarity.
The fleeting sun and ephemeral mayfly—
Yin souls return to Yang.
The Seven Corpses desiccate and refine,
Myriad spirits attend in welcome.
Golden qi scatters its radiance,
Preserving my purity and numinous essence.

This talisman attends the Seven *Po* of those who attain the Dao,
Preventing their dispersal and disorder,
Sealing off the demonic paths.

**Incantation:**
Solemnly summon the lungs as the White Palace of the White Prime Numinous *Po* Lord,
The qi of Lesser Yin Metal Essence and Venus,
To be received and transformed within the body to generate the lungs.
The Seven *Po* reside therein,
Seven Metal Spirits,
With seven thousand attending officers,
Governing the body,
Nourishing defense, sinews, and bones,
Presiding over the teeth.

**Incantation for Treating Lung Disease and *Hun* Madness:**
The White Emperor attends the *Po*,
Refining and restraining yin evil.
*Dui* script, Western qi—blow upon the talisman.
To be swallowed or worn,
Abstain from bitter foods for seven days,
From pungent foods for three days,
Whereupon the *Po* revives and the lungs find peace.
Receive this on the day of *Lixia* (Beginning of Autumn).
When swallowing, inscribe upon four sheets of bamboo membrane.
When wearing, inscribe upon purple silk.

**Hymn of the White Emperor’s Talisman:**
The Six *Jia* embrace the Golden Gate,
The Seven Governors guard the numinous altar.
Tossed bells cast fiery transformations,
Mighty swords and giant dragon banners.
Imploring the White Numinous Perfected,
What audacious force dares transgress?
Forever restraining demonic ghosts,
The frigid winds of the empyrean descend.
Once baleful qi is stilled,
The myriad heavens swiftly find peace.
The true companions bear great shelter,
Kneeling in gratitude, they sing and rejoice.

**Black Emperor’s Talisman for Circulating Blood**

**Incantation:**
Primordial essence of primordial chaos,
Celestial transformations in flux.
Qi congeals in vast obscurity,
True origin diffused and boundless.
Penetrating the Three Palaces,
The Black Emperor of resplendent jade.
Commanding soaring dragons,
Surging through the formless and subtle,
The ultimate Dao eludes finality.

This talisman nurtures those who attain the Dao,
Ensuring the free flow of blood vessels,
And flourishing vitality throughout the body.
The Black Emperor is the Supreme Dark Water Emperor,
And water within the human body is blood.

**Incantation:**
Solemnly summon the kidneys as the Dark Palace of the Peach Blossom Union Essence Lord,
The qi of Greater Yin Water Essence and Mercury,
To be received and transformed within the body to generate the kidneys.
The Jade Lad to the left, the Jade Maiden to the right,
Residing therein.
Five Water Spirits,
With five thousand attending officers,
Presiding within,
Nourishing defense, bones, and blood,
Governing the generation of essence.

**Incantation for Treating Kidney Disease and Blood Insufficiency:**
The Black Emperor circulates blood,
Kidney water pure and still.
*Kan* script, Northern qi—
To be swallowed or worn,
Abstain from sour foods for five days,
Whereupon blood flourishes and kidney disease finds peace.
Receive this on the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter).
When swallowing, inscribe upon one sheet of bamboo membrane;
When wearing, inscribe upon green silk.

**Hymn of the Black Emperor’s Talisman:**
The formless governs all things,
Abyssal—heart of the Supreme Emperor.
The Dao neither opens nor unfolds;
Its wondrous transformative mechanism runs deep.
Lest your leaks remain unstaunched,
Let not yin thoughts steep and overflow.
The ceaseless turning of boundless waves,
The bitter Dao leads one astray.
Ten thousand years of vigilance,
Yet in a single day, one may plunge into the depths.
Without the surge, one falls into demonic realms,
Where calamity and retribution cannot be borne.

**Yellow Emperor’s Central Sovereign Talisman**

**Incantation:**

At the primal depths of primordial obscurity,
The myriad patterns unfold in full array.
The Three Heavens hold great abundance,
Governing all within the Central Land.
The circular image resides in the Yellow Palace,
Where the imperial lineage endures without end.
As the three yang forces arise,
Leisure and joy belong to yang spring.

This talisman guards the Central Talisman,
Commanding the ten thousand mechanisms.
If applied to the individual body:
The liver stores the *hun*,
The lungs store the *po*,
The Crimson Palace and Cinnabar Field—
Where the two *qi* intertwine in union—
The red descends no more,
The mysterious spring ascends,
The heart stores blood,
The kidneys store essence,
The two *qi* revolve in alternation,
Mutually generating and nourishing.
Within the Yellow Court,
The spirit and intent reside.

**Incantation:**
With reverence, I summon the Spleen Spirit,
Eternal Transformer of the Yellow Court,
Essence of earth *qi*,
Absorbed into the transforming body,
To give life where the spleen resides.
Twelve earth spirits,
Leading a retinue of twelve thousand luminous attendants,
Thirty-six thousand spirits of the pore-orifices,
Absorbing the myriad *qi* for eternal preservation.
The hundred spirits merge in unity,
Inward and outward in profound obscurity,
Returning to the womb, reborn as an infant,
Ascending to pay homage to the Imperial Lord.

**Incantation for Treating Spleen Disease, Forgetfulness, Loss of Spirit, Emaciation, and Disturbed Appetite:**
The Yellow Emperor, Central Sovereign,
Over whom no spirit transcends.
Central script, upper *qi*—swallow or wear.
Avoid sour foods for twelve days;
On the fifteenth day, peace is restored!
When *qi* flourishes, spleen disease is cured.
Receive this on the day when earth prevails.
If swallowing, inscribe upon five sheets of bamboo membrane.
If wearing, inscribe in yellow upon crimson silk.

**Hymn of the Yellow Emperor’s Talisman:**
The myriad heavens bow to the Central Pivot,
Guiding the jade root of transformation.
The subtle mechanism spans countless kalpas,
Illuminating and opening the four gates.
Great abundance merges with the imperial true,
Binding and governing the stellar spirits.
Without the imperial Dao, nothing moves;
By its power, all directions are sustained.
Wrath and fury bring the frost of autumn,
Harmony and joy make springtime yang.
Grasping the primal record of generation,
I look up in reverence, bearing the boundless.

**Eighty-One Chapters of the Mysterious Secret Essence: Returning to the Origin and Revering the Supreme Arcana**

For all who study immortality and seek the Daoist arts: if the spirit does not return to its root, it will not be numinous; if *qi* does not return to its origin, there will be no treasure. The method possesses the *qi* of the Five Talismans and Five Numinous Ones, which can purge the five viscera of filth and turbidity, purifying body and mind. Thereafter, meditate upon the Dao and contemplate the True—naturally, awakening will arise, and divine transformations will be unfathomable.

One should distance oneself from sensual distractions, uphold loyalty and filial piety within the household, and aid beings for the benefit of others. The method employs Five Talismans, inscribed in vermilion upon five squares of colored silk, each half an inch in size. At dawn, enter the oratory, burn incense, and ingest the *qi* of the Five Numinous Talismans, mixed with well-flower water, facing the five directions. After seven days of ingestion, one may freely summon the Eighty-One Heavenly Officers and employ the Eighty-One Chapters of Universal Salvation. Submit flying memorials to the Emperor, deliver all wandering souls, and by this method, transcend the ghosts of the Nine Provinces. Whether praying for rain or seeking clear skies, healing the sick or expelling demons, none shall fail to respond.

**Five Numinous True Talismans**
*Red Apricot, Ink Black, Grind the True, Stocking Wax, Numinous Treasure*

**General Incantation:**
Nine Radiances, Three *Qi*,
Seven Governors, Five Constants.
The August Central Sovereign,
Descends to the Primordial Yang.

**Eighty-One Chapters, General Invocation:**
First, approach the seat of the Eight Assemblies and Nine Radiances.
Naturally, the script forms—
the myriad spirits all conceal themselves.

Visualize within the cinnabar field a chaotic brilliance of nine lights, shimmering and soaring, returning to the root of life. After a long while, ascend to the Eight Effulgences; *qi* enters the Profound Mystery, and within the Mystery, the Supreme August One welcomes the assembly of the myriad perfected. As thoughts arise, prayers are answered, and all spirits are universally summoned.

**Eighty-One Character Secret Incantation:**
*Lan Ming Chou Xuan, A Luo Long Zhan.*

**Invocation of the Mystic Essence:**

*Xu Yan Tan □, bearing aloft the floating treasure-banner.*
*Li Chan Tan Bo, Brahmā of the sprouting sky.*
*Chou Duo Shan You, radiant departure and exalted ascent.*
*Huo Lou Yi Miao, Fan Xian’s steadfast primacy.*
*Zhu Luo Qie Qie, Fu Li’s mighty chant.*
*Samādhi’s wondrous discernment, Kun’s covering and Dao’s Qian.*
*Crimson brilliance wheeling □, vanquishing demons and self-purifying.*
*Yin Wen Da Li, Lu Yu’s fragrant immersion.*
*The scripture of the Nine Qi, the edict of the ascending immortals.*

The foregoing all derive from the *Central Void of the Numinous Treasure*. In all practices, visualize the primordial qi of the Original Beginning, recite the Eighty-One Character [Incantation] in the heart, then apply the talismans as needed.

The Dao’s arcane and recondite purport is the root of the myriad methods. To attain it, one must be devoted to *guarding the One*; to enact it, one must rely on *spiritual efficacy*. When spiritual efficacy is fully realized, there is nothing it cannot accomplish. Guarding the spirit, the spirit becomes numinous; qi gathers, treasures abound. When spirit and qi are stabilized, inner and outer radiance shines, responses are unimpeded, and one attains the celestial perfected. Within the perfected dwells the spirit—*the Great Lord of Longevity*. When the perfected and the spirit resonate, one ascends to the imperial court, one’s name is inscribed in the jade registers, and for ten thousand kalpas, one enjoys felicity and glory.

To know this and advance in the Dao is to have the wondrous principle spontaneously illumined. To know this and grow remiss is to have one’s form extinguished for all generations. To treat it lightly, to leak or slight it, is to bring punishment upon the seven ancestors. Beware, beware—the celestial statutes are not lenient.

□□□□□□□□. *Northern qi.*

**Method for Ingesting Talismans with Corresponding Directions and Incantations:**
One nine concealed in Kan,
Two nine in Kun’s domain,
Three nine emerges from Xuan Zhen,
Four nine shines in Xun’s flame,
Five nine resides in the central position,
Six nine meets Qian’s realm,
Seven nine stands atop Dui,
Eight nine harms the Ghost Gate,
Nine nine ascends to Li’s radiance—
The spirit’s journey unites with the Jade Emperor.

The above incantations follow the directions; ingest the nine talismans, altering the qi incantations for each direction while visualizing the qi’s color of the respective direction, forming a red-orange mass the size of a tangerine, and drawing it into the cinnabar field.

**Secret Incantation for Entering Stillness:**
Primal Yellow circulates qi, eradicating all evil traces.
By the mighty decree of the Most High, peace is bestowed upon the Peach Lord.
The Seven Numinous Ones govern in stillness, their luminous script resplendent in the Yellow Center.
Wu and Ji form the canopy, the Infant Messenger establishes communication.
All meridians merge, all orifices unite in harmony.
The spirit roams the Great Desert—my life knows no end.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the Primordial Beginning.

Whenever refining the spirit, enter stillness, burn incense, and recite the incantation seven times in secret.

**Petition for Descent Incantation:**
*Ling Chou Mo Yin □ Mao Le Chen Ni Si.*
Five Spirits Incantation—blow upon the paper.

**Incantation for Receiving Spirits into the Five Palaces:**
Within the Five Primordial Essence Palaces of the Primordial Emperor, all are as one.
The left eye is the Great Yang.
Seal the tongue to the left.
Visualize the Great Yang, direct the gaze to emit liver qi, merging it into azure mist-qi, and receive it into the liver palace.
The right eye is the Great Yin.
Seal the tongue below.
Visualize the right eye to emit lung qi, merging it into white mist-qi, and receive it into the lung palace.

**Heavenly Canopy Heavenly Fire Urgent Seal**
**Golden Wheel Demon-Subduing Seal Formula**

From *you* to *mao*, seal the fingers firmly. The space between the brows is the Heavenly Manifestation. Seal the tongue to the tip. Visualize the Heavenly Manifestation, directing the mind’s intent from spleen toward kidney. Crimson, yellow, and violet qi emerge from the nose, merging into azure, yellow, and white qi, gathering between the brows to form a single five-colored pearl. From the mud-palace, with spirit, welcome the precious pearl into the abdomen and swallow it. Naturally, the five viscera radiate light, and true fire burns away the foul qi within the body. Then behold the Dharma-body like an infant.

**Incantation:**
*Om Haṃ Da Svāhā.*

Seal at *sì*. The incantation reads:
Azure essence, Yang spirit,
Great White of *geng* and *xin*.
Flaming Crimson Emperor,
Lord of *ren* and *gui*.
Bestow upon my *wu* and *ji*,
Unite with my bodily form.
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
Qi-body attains numinous communion.
Long life and enduring vision,
May I ascend in flight.

Swiftly as the Primordial Beginning’s decree!

Next, visualize the true qi of the Five Directions merging with the five viscera, entering through the crown of the head, traversing the Five Palaces, transforming into a red tangerine, and receiving it into the cinnabar field—swallow the talisman.

**Universal Summons of the Myriad Spirits Incantation:**
By the Primordial Beginning’s decree, the Dao Lord’s kalpic script,
The Three Luminaries’ mysterious Dipper, the essence of sun and moon,
Sixfold divine radiance, elevenfold directional transformations—
I now summon [Name], hasten to descend and commune with the numinous.
Swiftly arrive before the altar, transmit the divine command.

Seal of Jade Purity. When summoning the Five Peaks, seal the Five Spirits. Visualize freely, and the deities of the ten directions will arrive at once—whether as the sound of pines in the ear or conveyed through a youthful messenger, not one will be absent. Guard this secret.

**The Twenty-Four Jade Contracts of the Numinous Treasure for Opening Heaven**
The Master says: A *contract* is a bond, the celestial covenant. The Heavenly Worthy bestows edicts upon the children destined for immortality, first granting jade contracts to await their ascension, passing through the gates of heaven. These jade contracts are distributed among the heavenly palaces, just as earthly offices govern their jurisdictions—each has its constraints, and none may casually approach. Thus, the heavens establish these jade contracts to bestow upon those who study the Dao. Should one’s allotted years expire and the body return to Great Peace, possessing this jade contract allows direct passage to their destined abode. Upholding the celestial edict, soaring beyond the earthly realm, one relies on this contract to traverse the fierce winds. With the left *she* and right *ji* assisting the adept’s ascent to perfection, all depends on the jade contract. Without having personally attained the Dipper’s rank, none may lightly receive it. Violators face heavenly execution. Be vigilant.

The Nine Heavens Jade Contract, also called the Great One Contract—used for opening the gates of heaven, transcending life and death, guiding souls in ascension, and approaching the Nine Heavens, Ten Heavens, Thirty-Two Heavens, the celestial bureaus, the Heavenly Masters, and the Three Generals of the Heavenly Gates.

On the day of returning to the True, they may be worn for use, thereby ensuring swift return to one’s original abode without hindrance or obstruction. Should one encounter the issuance of official documents or dispatches from the aforementioned palaces, they may also be employed. For such purposes, use lightweight paper, ground mica as powder, and cinnabar of the eight celestial stems. Invoke the hand-seals of the Supreme Thearch and inscribe the text. Draw *qi* from the southeast and blow upon it, then cut the paper down the middle into two pieces. Affix the left piece to the head of the official document, rendering seals unnecessary. Burn the right piece to ash and mix it with fragrant water from the southeast, then consume it—none shall fail to reach its destination.

*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Seven (conclusion)
*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Eight

**The Gate of Purificatory Prohibitions**
The Master said: In the practice of the Great Daoist Rites, observe the auspicious days of the heavens and maintain a pure fast. Thus shall the Celestial Emperor inscribe your name, and the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors ascend together to the Southern Palace. Your person shall remain pure and fortunate, attaining longevity and immortality. When merit is fulfilled and perfection achieved, blessings shall extend to your lineage. All wishes shall be granted, spirits and ghosts bow in reverence, and the myriad perfected beings shall gather before you.

**The Three Primes**
The fifteenth day of the first month, the fifteenth day of the seventh month, and the fifteenth day of the tenth month.

**Assemblies of the Three**
The seventh day of the first month: the Heavenly Bureau convenes its Promotion and Reward Assembly.
The seventh day of the seventh month: the Earthly Prison holds its Grand Celebration of Life.
The fifth day of the tenth month: the Watery Bureau establishes its Grand Assembly of Life.
The aforementioned Three Primes and Three Assemblies are all days of universal deliverance and karmic assessment.

**The Five Laba Festivals**
The first day of the first month: Heavenly Laba.
The fifth day of the fifth month: Earthly Laba.
The seventh day of the seventh month: Moral Laba.
The first day of the tenth month: Popular Yearly Laba.
Within the twelfth month: the Obstructing Laba day is designated as the Laba for kings and lords, corresponding to the Five Tombs of the *Nayin* system.
On all Laba days, in accordance with the *Sutra on the Profound Kindness of Parents* as expounded by the Heavenly Worthy, one should observe a pure fast, make offerings to departed ancestors, recite scriptures, perform the Dao, and deliver the deceased—thus earning the name of a filial child. To make offerings on other days is to engage in wanton sacrifice; if the deceased are not venerated, the blessings sought will not be attained.

**Days of the Lesser Three Assemblies**
*Gengshen* day: the Corpse Spirit reports one’s transgressions.
*Jiazi* day: the Great Unity reviews the registers of gods and spirits.
One’s *benming* day: the hundred spirits gather before one’s person to tally merits and deeds.

**The Eight Seasonal Nodes**
*Lichun*, *Chunfen*, *Lixia*, *Xiazhi*, *Liqiu*, *Qiufen*, *Lidong*, *Dongzhi*.
On these days, the perfected beings of the eight directions assemble to assess sins, blessings, merits, and transgressions in the Eight Radiant Palace of the Upper Prime. As stated in the *Declarations of the Perfected*: on these days, one should maintain a pure fast and cultivate goodness within the bounds of the Dao. On the day of *Qiufen*, one need not offer apologies. One must not indulge in anger, strife, or the exercise of punitive authority, for these are the greatest taboos of heaven and humanity.

**Days of Seasonal Assemblies**
*Jiawu*: Heavenly Seasonal Assembly.
*Jiashen*: Earthly Seasonal Assembly.
*Jiachen*: Four Seasons’ Assembly.
*Jiazi*: Human Seasonal Assembly.
*Jiaxu*: Five Agents’ Assembly.
*Bingwu*: Heavenly Assembly.
*Renwu*: Earthly Assembly.
*Gengwu*: Solar Assembly.
*Gengshen*: Lunar Assembly.
*Xinyou*: Stellar Assembly.
*Dingmao*: Assembly of Immortals and Perfected Beings.
The third day: Dipper’s Assembly.
One’s birthday: Assembly of One’s Life-Spirit.
On the aforementioned assembly days, it is fitting to perform offerings, invoke blessings, and recite scriptures, for the perfected will descend and respond with favor.

**The Five Mao Days**
*Yimao*, *Dingmao*, *Jimao*, *Xinmao*, *Guimao*.
On all *mao* days, one should receive the fast, enter the chamber facing east, bow in reverence, and cultivate the spirit while nurturing *qi*, awaiting the response of the divine. One may also express one’s intentions, and through consistent practice, the Jade Maidens will descend with talismans.

**Days of the Descent of the Heavenly Worthies and Lords of Qi**
The first day: the Heavenly Worthy of the East descends with the Nine Lords of *Qi*.
The eighth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the South descends with the Three Lords of *Qi*.
The fourteenth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the West descends with the Seven Lords of *Qi*.
The fifteenth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the North descends with the Five Lords of *Qi*.
The eighteenth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Northeast descends with the Lord of Brahmanic *Qi*.
The twenty-third day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Southeast descends with the Lord of Brahmanic *Qi*.
The twenty-fourth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Southwest descends with the Lord of Brahmanic *Qi*.
The twenty-eighth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Northwest descends with the Lord of Brahmanic *Qi*.
The twenty-ninth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Upper Realm descends with the Lord of Primordial *Qi*.
The thirtieth day: the Heavenly Worthy of the Lower Realm descends with the Ninefold Sovereign Lords.
In shorter months, subtract three days.

**Days of the Descent of the Various Perfected Beings**
The first day: the Northern Dipper descends from the Northwest.
The eighth day: the Lunar Slayer Lord of the Northern Dipper descends.
The fourteenth day: the Envoy of the Great Unity descends from the Northeast.
The fifteenth day: the Three Officials descend.
The eighteenth day: the Great Unity descends from the Southeast.
The twenty-third day: the Eight Divine Envoys of the Great Unity descend from the South.
The twenty-fourth day: the Northern Culmen descends from the Southwest.
The twenty-eighth day: the Great Unity descends from the West.
The twenty-ninth day: the Central Great Unity descends from the Lower Realm.
The thirtieth day: the Great Unity descends from the Upper Realm.
The above is drawn from the *Sutra on Karmic Retribution and Causation*; on these days, it is fitting to make offerings to the perfected spirits.

**The Four Commencement Days**
The first day of the first month, the first day of the fourth month, the first day of the seventh month, and the first day of the tenth month.

**Days of the Solar and Lunar Phases**
The first day: dawn.
The fifteenth day: full moon.
Alternatively, the fourteenth or sixteenth day may also be used for morning observances.

**Days When the Supreme Great Dao Lord Ascends the Jade Radiance Chamber**
The fourth day of the first month, the eighth day of the second month, the fifteenth day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, the ninth day of the fifth month, the sixth day of the sixth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the eighth day of the eighth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the third day of the eleventh month, and the twelfth day of the twelfth month.
On these days, the Supreme Great Dao Lord ascends the Jade Radiance Chamber to survey the four quarters of the world. Those of resolute aspiration who have forgotten their origins and wandered afar may, on these days at sunrise, face north and bow twice. They may also present their original vows within the oratory, swallowing saliva thirty-six times. It is also said that the Azure Lad of the Eastern Sea regularly ascends the Eastern Florescence Terrace on *dingmao* days to survey the four directions. On such days, facing the rising sun while performing this practice allows one to absorb solar essence.

**Days of Avoidance and Prohibition**
The ninth day of the third month, the second day of the sixth month, the sixth day of the ninth month, and the third day of the twelfth month.
On these days, one should enter the chamber and avoid contact with women. If the Six Corpses become disordered, they will stir the hidden blood, causing chaos and dissipation. The Three Spirits will lose their guard, the spirit will wither, and *qi* will depart, leading to death over time. Thus, these days are to be avoided—not merely to curb licentiousness, but to protect the women’s quarters.
The women’s quarters are in *shen*; the men’s quarters are in *yin*. *Yin* and *shen* mutually punish, and this punishment brings harm. On these days, the male and female Three Corpses emerge from the red pupils of the eyes: the female corpse beckons to the male, and the male corpse beckons to the female. Disaster and harm come and go, the spirit is lost, and purity is defiled. Though one may not perceive it, the signs manifest outwardly. The harm arises from the Three Corpses battling within the eyes, causing blood to flow into the Muddy Pellet.

On these days, even the most beloved concubine or cherished daughter-in-law must not face one another. My former master cultivated only this Dao and ascended as an immortal. Moreover, those who are not kin and lack intent—such as the immortal Liu Yao’s wife and daughter, who received this oral transmission—are no exception.

Another passage states: On *jiayin* and *gengshen* days, the corpse-spirits vie in chaos, and the spirit becomes restless and defiled. One must not share a mat with a spouse nor engage in conversation or meeting. Instead, maintain purity and vigilance, abstaining from all desires.

- Second month: ninth day, and *xinhai* (some say *xinmao*).

**Selecting Hours by Monthly Governors**
Heavenly Stem, Great Unity, Victorious Light, Small Auspice, Transmission, Following Chief, River Chief, Ascending Brightness, Divine Marshal, Great Auspice, Merit Officer, Great Assault.

On yang days, begin with *Great Auspice* and proceed in order; on yin days, begin with *Small Auspice* and proceed in reverse. All commence from the earthly branch of the day.

**Void Days**
- *Jia* and *ji* days: *shen* and *you*.
- *Yi* and *geng* days: *wu* and *wei*.
- *Bing* and *xin* days: *chen* and *si*.
- *Ding* and *ren* days: *yin* and *mao*.
- *Wu* and *gui* days: *zi*, *chou*, *xu*, and *hai*.

**Hours of Heavenly Gate’s Opening and Closing**
On yang days: opens during yin hours, closes during yang hours. The six yang hours are *zi*, *yin*, *chen*, *wu*, *shen*, and *xu*.
On yin days: opens during yang hours, closes during yin hours. The six yin hours are *chou*, *mao*, *si*, *wei*, *you*, and *hai*.

The above hours are selected for submitting memorials when the gate is open.

According to ancient regulations, the days of fasting and taboos are scattered across scriptures and precepts, impossible to enumerate fully. Here, only those essential to practice are briefly listed. For setting up altars to pray for blessings, ascending the platform to initiate affairs, submitting memorials, confessing transgressions, or expressing gratitude, one may conduct rituals on these days. Even without supplications, using these guidelines to regulate conduct, eliminate wrongdoing, and reduce faults can aid cultivation. Matters one must not engage in, foods one must not consume, and actions that disturb the spirit or defile the body—how can these not be avoided?

If one abides in the realm of virtue and Dao, dwelling in the land of tranquility and emptiness, never forgetting even in dreams or haste, then every moment becomes a fast, and no day is bound by restrictions. Yet if one neglects self-cultivation, fails to regulate conduct, transgresses the registers of the Dao, and violates taboos, the Three Officials will examine and punish, the Five Emperors will censure faults, nine generations will share the guilt, and the individual will bear the consequences. The Dao is not unkind—beware of this.

**Four Grades of Fasting**
1. **Mind Fasting**: Diligently uphold the celestial precepts, aligning heart and intent, harmonizing inner and outer conduct. Without thought, desire, worry, or fear, sit in effortless forgetfulness. Virtue aligns with the perfected, and the Dao accords with the immortal standard.
2. **Regular Fasting**: Abstain from pungent foods and impurities, forsaking meat and desire.
3. **Pure Fasting**: Abstain from the five grains, sever worldly affairs, dwell in mountains and rivers, drink primordial *qi*, uphold precepts, forget sensory roots, dissolve the womb and placenta, and cut off friendships.
4. **Perpetual Fasting**: Uphold the above three fasts for one or two months, one or two years, or even twenty years—from initial resolve to ascension.

**Five Pungent Foods to Avoid**
Scallions, leeks, garlic, chives, and coriander.

According to *The Supreme Code of the Mysterious Capital’s Judgment of Sins*: Consuming the five pungent foods while reciting scriptures ranks as the foremost transgression among precepts. Cultivating and chanting while violating this offends the divine, defiles the sacred realm, and incurs the retribution of the "heart-piercing serpent hell." Generally, these foods are intensely pungent and foul; their odor lingers for days after consumption. Even in conversation, others find it repulsive—how much more so when facing the true and practicing the Dao? Additionally, foods resembling scallions, such as *xie* and *lei*, must also be avoided.

**Three Forbidden Meats**
- Wild geese: Heaven’s taboo.
- Dogs: Earth’s taboo.
- Carp, eels, and turtles: Water’s taboo.

The code states: Consuming the three taboo meats forever extinguishes the hope of immortality. Other creatures like eels and turtles, with their strong fishy odors, are also unsuitable. Furthermore, the meat of the six livestock, fowl, embryos, and eggs must not be eaten, as doing so harms life and severs destiny. Pork and dog meat are especially forbidden.

Not only does violating the precepts and prohibitions of the fast break one’s virtue and obstruct its fullness, but it also bars the gates of Heaven, preventing one’s memorials from ascending and one’s petitions from reaching the Supreme Mystery. Only in the case of illness may Daoist practitioners consume dairy, dried venison, elk, goose, duck, and dried fish—though even then, abstaining is preferable.

**Restrictions and Prohibitions**
The Master said: The essentials of the great Daoist law comprise three *ju* (stations), four *bao* (recompenses), seven *jin* (prohibitions), and five *ji* (taboos). If scholars observe these without transgression, they may enter the threshold of the Mystery Gate.

**Three Stations**
1. **Reciting incantations**: These are the secret words of High Heaven. The host of perfected beings and myriad spirits respond to the invocation and descend with the qi.
2. **Drawing talismans**: These are the celestial covenants of High Heaven. The host of perfected beings are summoned and descend.
3. **Performing rituals**: Those who preside over the bureaus of the immortal courts command their own hosts of perfected beings and spirits, each fulfilling their duties. They come when called and depart when sent, without need of talismans or incantations.

**Four Recompenses**
1. **Wisdom recompense**: Wisdom and insight grow daily.
2. **Spirit recompense**: The spirit becomes luminous and penetrating.
3. **Intent recompense**: The mind transcends the ordinary.
4. **Immortal recompense**: One attains the recompense of immortality.

**Seven Prohibitions**
1. **Prohibit the mouth**: If the mouth refrains from cursing, reviling, or speaking defiled words, incantations will communicate with the spirits.
2. **Prohibit the eyes**: If the eyes do not gaze upon filth or impurity, they may perceive the true spirits.
3. **Prohibit the ears**: If the ears do not listen to lewd sounds, they may hear the eight directions of wisdom.
4. **Prohibit the hands**: If the hands do not touch defiled objects, the mudras may connect with the divine.
5. **Prohibit the feet**: If the feet do not tread upon defiled or evil places, one may step upon the *gang* and ascend in flight.
6. **Prohibit the mind**: If the mind does not entertain defiled thoughts, it may summon and attract the true spirits.
7. **Prohibit the thoughts**: If thoughts do not arise in disorder, concentration may invoke the divine luminaries.

**Five Taboos**
1. **Avoid holding infants or nursing children**: This renders ritual power ineffective.
2. **Avoid frivolous conduct with women**: Such behavior often invites demonic interference.
3. **Avoid rage and defiance**: The divine and true spirits will only withdraw.
4. **Avoid partiality in merit**: Without impartial virtue, one’s name will not appear in the immortal registers.
5. **Avoid irreverence and doubt**: This allows the heterodox to mingle with the orthodox.

**Precepts and Prohibitions**
The Master said: In all fasting, purification, and audience rites with the perfected, one must follow the prescribed forms. At all times, one should examine and discipline one’s conduct, cultivating virtue and refining one’s nature. Only then may one’s sincerity ascend and communicate with the heavens. To indulge in delusion and transgression brings calamity upon the seven ancestors. Be ever vigilant.

**The Ten Supreme Precepts**
1. Maintain an impartial mind; do not deceive yourself.
2. Serve your lord and master with loyalty; honor heaven and earth, and revere your parents with filial piety.
3. Extend compassion and benevolence to all beings; live in frugality and temperance.
4. Maintain purity and uprightness; do not engage in factionalism.
5. Reverently follow the supreme Dao and deeply believe in self-cultivation.
6. Respect the spirits and gods; do not treat them with contempt.
7. In all clothing and sustenance, recognize the primordial ancestral *qi* of the Origin; do not entertain extraneous thoughts.
8. Use lye and water to cleanse impurities; do not indulge in adornment.
9. Recite with the mouth and prostrate with the heart; do not exhaust the body.
10. Enter the great stillness for seven days, and the divine radiance will become serene; thus, one may behold the Jade Pure Realm.

**The Twelve Great Precepts**
1. **The Virtue of Non-Killing**: Whether through mental intent, verbal suggestion, physical action, encouragement, instruction, or inducement, to cause the death of any sentient being is called killing.
2. **The Virtue of Non-Harm**: Secret plotting, slander, flattery, deceit, entrapment, cruel and unlawful methods—any act that harms sentient beings is called harm.
3. **The Virtue of Non-Envy**: Harboring resentment, scheming, exploiting circumstances to spread falsehoods, wishing misfortune upon others, devising means to seize their possessions—any act that envies and harms sentient beings is called envy.
4. **The Virtue of Non-Jealousy**: Secretly manipulating personal connections, desiring to surpass others, fantasizing about their appearance or possessions, scheming to remove or harm them—any act of resentment toward sentient beings is called jealousy.
5. **The Virtue of Non-Lust**: Whether through desire for beauty or wealth, impure intentions, illicit relations with kin, incestuous transgressions, or private infatuations—regardless of appearance, all such acts are called lust.
6. **The Virtue of Non-Stealing**: Breaching walls, altering marks, breaking seals, tampering with locks or signatures, concealing with private intent, borrowing without repayment, deceitful appropriation—all such acts are called stealing.
7. **The Virtue of Non-Greed**: Unrestrained desire, measuring the breadth of one’s capacity, coveting all things as if they were one’s own, insatiable craving, endlessly pursuing without regard for one’s allotted share—all such acts are called greed.
8. **The Virtue of Non-Desire**: The mind-monkey plays tricks, the intent-horse gallops wildly, the six senses churn, giving rise to the seven emotions; infatuation breeds attachment, and desire takes root—all such acts are called desire.
9. **The Virtue of Non-Hatred**: Partiality, attachment, discrimination between fragrance and stench, purity and filth, high and low, noble and base—failing to treat all equally is called hatred.
10. **The Virtue of Non-Deceit**: Doubtful hesitation, excess or deficiency, cunning and deceit, obstruction and frustration—all such acts are called deceit.
11. **The Virtue of Unadorned Speech**: Let words be free of embellishment.
12. **The Virtue of Harmonious Speech**: Let speech be free of malicious tones.

In practicing the Way of Great Stillness, one should observe the mind within stillness until the mind itself is forgotten—this is the true mind. Observe the form until form itself is forgotten—this is the true form. When both mind and form are forgotten, one naturally enters the formless Dao, which is the method of ascending in broad daylight.

**The Nine Wondrous Precepts of the Perfected**
1. Be respectful and yielding; honor and nurture your parents.
2. Be diligent and loyal to your lord and sovereign.
3. Do not kill; extend compassion to save all beings.
4. Do not commit lust; maintain integrity in conduct.
5. Do not steal; yield to righteousness and diminish the self.
6. Do not harbor anger; do not oppress others with fury.
7. Do not deceive; do not flatter, betray, or harm the virtuous.
8. Do not be arrogant; do not disdain the utmost truth.
9. Do not waver; uphold the precepts with single-minded devotion.

Those who wish to revere the supreme Dao, deliver the living, transcend the dead, subdue malevolent demons, and command the myriad spirits must receive the above precepts. First, one must surrender body and life to the Three Supreme Treasures, never following false teachers, deceptive influences, or the delusive and heretical teachings of demonic cults—nor engaging in practices akin to sorcery.

**Taking Refuge in the Three Treasures**
First, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Dao.
Second, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Scriptures.
Third, take refuge in the Supreme Treasure of the Masters.

The above precepts were all proclaimed by the Golden Mouth. If received without transgression, the heavens rejoice, all demonic trials are dispelled, and one attains the realization of flying immortality. Should one violate them, the Earth Bureau will report the offense, the Three Officials will investigate, and the Five Emperors will record the transgression. Minor offenses reduce one’s allotted lifespan; moderate offenses subject the living soul to examination; grave offenses forfeit merit and lead to retribution, shortening life and diminishing fortune, demoting one’s rank among the immortals. If the violation was not intentional, repentance is still permitted. However, after the Autumn Equinox offering, no further transgressions are forgiven. Should one again violate the precepts, there will be no absolution.

If one suddenly feels the spirit and mind distracted, the body heavy and feverish, the limbs oppressed and restless, or the senses dull and unsettled, one must immediately confess and repent. Threefold transgressions will not be pardoned. These are the precepts to be observed.

**The Dharma Gate of Liberation**

The Scripture states: The Dao of immortals values life and delivers boundless beings. Above, the Eight Gates are opened, and the celestial methods are transmitted—prohibitions of transgressions and blessings, karmic causes and conditions from past lives.

**The Eighteen Articles of the Gate of Transgressions:**
The body incurs calamity, which extends to nine generations of ancestors. One is bound to serve as a ghostly official, executed with metal and iron, subjected to the Great Heavenly Punishment of Jiutian, dismembered by the spirits of slaughter, beheaded a thousand thousand times, disfigured ten thousand ten thousand times. One falls into hell, bringing disaster to seven generations of ancestors—heads bound, self-destruction, bound and sent away, beheaded, fettered, forms constrained, spirits extinguished, eyes lost.

**The Sixty-Two Articles of the Gate of Blessings:**
The deaf regain hearing, the blind see clearly, the mute speak, the bedridden rise and walk, chronic illnesses are restored to health, white hair turns black, lost teeth regrow, the old become youthful and strong. All attain vitality, gold and jade manifest in form, withered bones become human again, and one’s full lifespan is preserved. True Persons recite the scriptures.

**The Sole Ascent to the Jade Capital**

This scripture is not transmitted to the lower world. It contains the secret celestial texts of the Upper Heavens, revered by all heavens. Its words are not of this mundane realm; it is conferred with oaths to the Ten Heavens and entrusted as a treasure of the Upper Heavens. Concealed within the Mystic Capital, its language is not of this world—transmitted but once in forty thousand kalpas, a chapter of natural spontaneity.

**The Gate of Precepts**
**The Precept Against Transforming Alien Bones into Kin.** Twelve Articles.
**Offering Gold and Treasures to Demonstrate Sincerity; Careless Leaking and Contempt.** Four Articles.
**The Practice of the Dao.** One Article.

**The Gate of Past Lives**
When a nation embraces the Dao with utmost sincerity, it flourishes through generations.

**The Gate of Causes and Conditions**
Those who honor, revere, and make offerings with devotion shall attain deliverance across lifetimes. Reverence and offerings create good causes and conditions.

**The Mystic Statutes and Regulations**
The Master said: "Merits and transgressions, sins and blessings—great ones alter lifespan, while minor ones hasten or prolong one’s years. There are three ranks and nine grades, all recorded in the Celestial Prohibitions of the Great Mystic Capital. All should adhere to them.

**Upper Rank, Upper Grade:** Removes and adds three *ji* (thirty-six years).
**Upper Rank, Middle Grade:** Removes and adds two *ji* (twenty-four years).
**Upper Rank, Lower Grade:** Removes and adds one *ji* (twelve years).
**Middle Rank, Upper Grade:** Removes and adds ten years.
**Middle Rank, Middle Grade:** Removes and adds nine years.
**Middle Rank, Lower Grade:** Removes and adds seven years.
**Lower Rank, Upper Grade:** Removes and adds half a *ji* (six years).
**Lower Rank, Middle Grade:** Removes and adds five years.
**Lower Rank, Lower Grade:** Removes and adds three years.

**Upper Rank, Upper Grade:** Reduces or increases two hundred and forty *suan* (years of fate).
**Upper Rank, Middle Grade:** Reduces or increases one hundred and twenty *suan*.
**Upper Rank, Lower Grade:** Reduces or increases one hundred *suan*.
**Middle Rank, Upper Grade:** Reduces or increases ninety *suan*.
**Middle Rank, Middle Grade:** Reduces or increases fifty *suan*.
**Middle Rank, Lower Grade:** Reduces or increases forty *suan*.
**Lower Rank, Upper Grade:** Reduces or increases thirty *suan*.
**Lower Rank, Middle Grade:** Reduces or increases twenty *suan*.
**Lower Rank, Lower Grade:** Reduces or increases ten *suan*.

The Master said: "For minor good and evil deeds, there are further reductions or increases, from ten *suan* down to one.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate and Mystic Potential said: "One who cultivates upper-rank merits must not presume upon upper-rank, upper-grade transgressions.

For minor good deeds, ensure they are recorded daily.
For minor evil deeds, ensure they are dissolved daily.
Accumulate minor good deeds to form great merit;
Dissolve minor evils to achieve great goodness.
Upper-rank merits are difficult to cultivate;
Upper-grade transgressions are unforgivable.
Scholars who recite these shall enjoy mountains of blessings.
Those who disdain them shall suffer ten thousand kalpas of torment."

**Mystic Statutes, Upper Rank, Upper Grade**
Rebellion, treachery, defiance, and conspiracy.
The *Laws of the Mystic Capital* state: "Assassinating rulers or fathers, poisoning masters or elders, disrupting the moral principles of heaven, earth, and the Five Constants. Striking or defying rulers, masters, or parents; harboring anger, destruction, or betrayal toward masters, parents, or elders; abandoning rectitude for heresy; pledging faith to demonic sorcerers; committing incest with kin; colluding with the six relations; plotting murder—all such deeds erase one’s name from the registers of immortals, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. They burden nine generations of ancestors above, nine generations of descendants below, and oneself in the present, subjecting one to eternal trials by wind and blade. Unforgiven for ten thousand kalpas, one is reborn as a beast, never to receive human form again, forever barred from the hope of immortality. Lifespan is reduced by three *ji*."

**Upper Rank, Middle Grade**
Careless leaking, contempt, destruction, and plunder.
The *Laws of the Mystic Capital* state: "Disrespecting rulers, masters, or parents; the Three Treasures, sacred images, or divine texts; failing to observe time limits and recklessly divulging the Three Treasures, the Three Caverns’ secret scriptures, esoteric methods, registers, talismans, and diagrams; leaking the taboo names of heaven, earth, and the Five Agents; the unmanifested secrets of divine immortals, celestial mechanisms, and the taboos of fortune and misfortune; disrespecting rulers, masters, or parents; defiling or destroying the Three Treasures, sacred images, rulers, masters, parents, or any permanent property; assaulting, cursing, plotting harm, or murdering those who uphold the Dao, virtue, the Five Constants, or the six relations; sabotaging teachings; lacking faith; feigning devotion while slandering in secret, or professing loyalty while betraying in private; altering one’s resolve; seizing through force or deceit; plundering the sacred texts of the Three Treasures, rulers, masters, parents, or the belongings of the Seven Virtues—all such deeds erase one’s name from the ranks of immortals, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. They burden seven generations of ancestors, nine generations of descendants, and oneself in the present. Upon death, one enters eternal darkness, suffering the torments of the Three Wretched Realms. Unforgiven for a thousand kalpas, one is reborn as a loathsome insect, never to receive human form again. Lifespan is reduced by two *ji*."

**Upper Rank, Lower Grade**
Killing, debauchery, and theft.
The *Laws of the Mystic Capital* state: "Slaying all living beings, entrapping all sentient life; indulging in lust without restraint, engaging in improper conjugal relations; stealing all manner of things—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. They burden ancestors, descendants, and oneself in the present. Upon death, one sinks into hell, unforgiven even after three pardons. In this life, one bears the marks of blindness, deafness, muteness, madness, and incurable illness. Lifespan is reduced by one *ji*."

**Middle Rank, Upper Grade**
Breaking fasts, violating precepts, greed, jealousy, and hatred.
The *Laws of the Mystic Capital* state: "Consuming the five pungent vegetables, the three detestable meats, or excessive alcohol; deliberately craving the flesh of the six livestock, fowl, or insects; breaking fasts for private desires; eating impure foods; entering fasts with anger or joy; meting out rewards and punishments without restraint; deceitfully seeking food; insatiable in desires; restless and never content; envying those superior to oneself; resenting those inferior; despising the good; wishing others ill; harboring malice and hatred; unable to overcome others yet constantly scheming—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank by three grades, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. Lifespan is reduced by nine years, fasts are suspended for six years, and one year is required to atone. One hundred and twenty merits are needed to redeem the sin."

**Middle Rank, Middle Grade**
Cunning, flattery, deceit, evil speech, and vulgarity.
The *Laws of the Mystic Capital* state: "A hundred crooked schemes, endless suspicions; acting on whims, flattering superiors while neglecting inferiors; momentary sycophancy, a hundred deceptions; false speech, roaring in anger; self-aggrandizement, abandoning rectitude for heresy; unable to discern truth from falsehood; favoring the crooked and despising the upright; nitpicking and dissecting; debating right and wrong, truth and falsehood; in movement, stillness, sitting, and lying—pursuing ostentation; unable to return to simplicity and plainness; defiling the purity of the Five Agents; engaging in impure, lewd speech and all manner of vulgarities; cursing and swearing at heaven, earth, wind, rain, the Five Agents, and spirits; uttering all manner of evil incantations—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank by two grades, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. Lifespan is reduced by five years, and two hundred and forty *suan* are deducted. Two hundred days of fasts are suspended, and ninety merits are required to atone for the sin."

**Middle Grade, Lower Rank**
Stealing, deceiving, and obscuring the truth with intent toward all manner of evil.
*The Statutes of Xuandu* state: Secretly taking others’ belongings, refusing to repay debts, borrowing without returning, seizing opportunities to conceal, using cunning to claim lost items, turning public matters to private gain, feigning auspiciousness or refinement, taking what is superficial or substantial, passing off falsehood as truth, employing illusions to deceive, acting arrogantly toward gods and humans, deceiving both heart and spirits, indulging in secret misdeeds, obscuring the Three Luminaries, Heaven, Earth, and the virtuous—all such thoughts and intentions to commit evil demote one’s immortal rank by one grade, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. Lifespan is reduced by three years and one hundred twenty *suan* are deducted. One hundred days of fasts are suspended, and fifty merits are required to atone for the sin.

**Lower Grade, Upper Rank**
*The Statutes of Xuandu* state: Disdaining and wasting the Five Grains, discarding kindness and benevolence, breaking oaths and vows, defiling silk and cloth, lacking trust and righteousness, lacking benevolence and compassion, devoid of humility, without thoughts of rescue, making no firm promises, lacking harmony and affection—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank by three grades, nullify merits, and ruin deeds. One year of fasts is suspended, seventy days of penance are required, and thirty merits are needed to atone for the sin.

**Lower Grade, Middle Rank**
*The Statutes of Xuandu* state: Disparaging the orphaned, impoverished, elderly, and young; failing to aid Daoist recluses in mountain forests or the cold-dwelling; neglecting to repair or complete unfinished meritorious works; refusing to assist the virtuous in times of illness, hunger, or need; destroying mountains and graves for personal comfort; using power to coerce; failing to save those in peril; felling thriving trees and plants; turning existence into nonexistence; deceiving others with obscured intentions; divining omens from Heaven, Earth, stars, and celestial anomalies; encroaching upon the authority of kings and nobles; using cunning to ensnare living beings; being remiss in service to superiors; failing in care for subordinates; appropriating incense and flowers for personal use; lacking devotion in cultivation—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank by two grades, nullify merits, and ruin deeds for half a year. Fifty days of fasts are suspended, and twenty merits are required to atone for the sin.

**Lower Grade, Lower Rank**
*The Statutes of Xuandu* state: Falsely speaking in the name of celestial officials or divine spirits, fabricating one’s own virtue to seek blessings, intimidating the common folk, revealing the secrets of Daoist practices to gain recognition, altering seals, letters, talismans, or documents, prying into others’ private affairs, breaking seals or locks, recording minor transgressions, trampling or pressing down upon tiny creatures, cursing and humiliating the lowly, shouting while drunk, forcing labor upon the cold and hungry, making vows without fulfilling them, poisoning or destroying the Five Agents, stirring up disputes, indulging in refined foods, whipping and tormenting livestock, caging birds and insects, using impure incense and fire, performing rituals carelessly, conducting unclean jiao sacrifices, handling memorials and petitions with negligence, showing disrespect to superiors, violating ritual propriety—all such deeds demote one’s immortal rank by one grade, nullify merits, and ruin deeds for ninety days. One month of fasts is suspended, and ten merits are required to atone for the sin.

**Six Prohibitions for Cultivating the Dao**
Approaching corpses, attending funerals, visiting new mothers, places of execution, slaughterhouses, and houses of debauchery.

The above places must not be entered. As the *Oral Instructions of Li Shaojun* states: "Those who seek immortality as Daoists must not see the corpses of the dead, for this severely damages the spirit and qi. Only when a ruler, teacher, or parent’s love leaves no choice may one attend. Thus, when a Daoist passes away, they do not serve kings or lords—this would be lacking in loyalty. To dwell alone in solitude would be lacking in companionship. Only for one’s parents, teachers, or masters may one not avoid attending their funerals, expressing the utmost grief, sparing no injury to one’s own life. If one is harmed for this reason, it is no true harm. I keep this secret and transmit it orally."

The Supreme Lord’s *Hidden Way of Gazing at Life and Concealing the Court of Primordial Origin*:
On one’s natal day, face the direction of one’s natal sign, knock the teeth three times, and mentally perform two bows. Recite the incantation:
*"The Great One gathers life, the Three Blacks unite with the True. The embryo proclaims the Upper Radiance, the Mother is Mysterious, the Father is Primordial. They give birth to my five viscera, gather my spirit. Below, they irrigate with Jade Liquid; above, they ascend to the Muddy Pellet. At dusk, refine the seven po; at dawn, harmonize the three hun. On the right, the Jade Flower; on the left, the Golden Dawn’s whistle. Let me become a divine immortal, command spirits and employ gods. Ever preserve uprightness and integrity, soaring through the Ten Heavens."*
After the incantation, mentally bow to the four directions, knock the teeth three times, and swallow saliva three times. If practiced regularly, the hun and po will be guarded, and one will attain long life as a divine immortal.

Another method:
Those who study the Dao must first restrain the hun and po and eliminate the corpse-demons. On the days of the new and full moon, the days of *gengshen* and *jiayin*, purify oneself, enter the chamber, bathe to cleanse the dust, sit upright on the mat, and remain awake—this is the mark of true goodness. With cinnabar, mark beneath the left eye; with realgar, mark beneath the right nostril, letting a small portion enter the valley (the philtrum). Before marking, knock the teeth three times and recite the incantation:
*"The Upper Radiance flies and coils, cinnabar and yellow scatter like mist. Qi seizes the numinous and evil, corpse-filth sinks and vanishes. Harmonize the hun, refine the po, unite with the Great Spirit. Let me not die, live ten thousand years eternally □. Keen of sight and hearing, ever prosperous and upright."*
After the incantation, knock the teeth three times again and swallow saliva three times. With the second finger of the right hand, pinch the right nostril; with the second finger of the left hand, pinch beneath the right eye. Do this seven times each, pressing firmly without lifting the hands. These two places are the gateways through which the seven po and wandering corpses roam, the bridges by which essence-thieves and evil spirits cross. Thus, receiving the essence of cinnabar and realgar seals the path of corpse-demons, while the fragrance of the Two Radiance repels licentious chaos. This is the supreme method of the Great Ultimate. Regular practice harmonizes the hun and po, scatters corpse-filth, and leads to long life as a divine immortal with penetrating qi and clear vision. After three years of practice, lustful thoughts vanish. This is the method of the Supreme Numinous Perfected.

**Method for Purifying Filth**
Whenever one treads upon defiled or impure places, one must bathe to dissolve the contamination. Thus, the various methods of the Three Clarities and the descents of immortals include the *Refined Essence for Refining Corpses*. The method uses ten ounces of *xin* leaves and four ounces of peach branches (with the white bark peeled off), placed in a clean, empty vessel. Add one *hu* and two *dou* of clear water, boil until it rises once, then let it cool to a suitable temperature to bathe the body. All filth will be swept away, and it will also cure damp impediment, sores, and itching. Bamboo is hollow and white within; peach repels evil and breaks filth, thus dissolving the turbidity within the body. When heavenly beings descend, they never fail to use this method. As for the common world’s talismanic waters, incantations for rinsing, and minor arts of a *sheng* or *he*, none compare to this formula. If one prefers a milder version, simply refrain from using this water to wash the hair—it remains truly wondrous.

**Talisman of the Perfected Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity for Dispelling Filth**
This talisman is also called the *Talisman for Seizing Filth*. Carve it on a catalpa wood tablet, shaped like an audience tablet but slightly smaller. Keep it pure at all times. When consuming meat or treading upon filth, or when urgently performing rituals without time to bathe, first boil seven *ge* of *maoxiang* (sweetgrass) decoction, rinse the mouth, then dab seven drops on the palms of both hands. Rub the eyes with both hands and recite the incantation:
*"Accumulated filth follows the water’s flow, all departs through the divine intelligence. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statute decrees."*
Next, before the sacred altar, burn incense, knock the teeth forty-nine times, hold the tablet, and face the *Talisman for Seizing Filth* toward the mouth. Bow and exhale onto the talisman while reciting the incantation:
*"Filth departs, upright qi enters; upright qi abides, filth departs. The thirty-six aversions, the thirty-six filths—may the divine talisman seize them all. The Crimson Palace is serene and unified, the divine gate is bright and clear."*
After the incantation, set down the tablet, turn around, form the *Gedou* mudra, step the Dipper to the *gang* (celestial pivot), inhale a breath of qi, release the mudra, and proceed with the next step. This is an emergency method. If ascending the altar to present memorials, where the matter is more solemn, one must still follow the ritual of bathing.

**Method for Dispelling Childbirth Filth**
Generally, Daoists residing in jade palaces must avoid all childbirth entirely. For lay practitioners of the Dao, only the birth of a child cannot be avoided due to its moral significance. After a full month, one may dispel the filth and enter the oratory, following the previous methods. In all other cases, avoidance and abstention are required; violations will incur punishment.

**Temporary Leave for Attending Funerals**
Whenever a practitioner encounters a major funeral or the passing of parents or teachers, they must submit a report to the Three Heavenly Gates, sending a document to the attending officials. They must close the oratory and refrain from burning incense or performing rituals. If the matter is urgent and there is no time to draft a document, they may notify the attending officials, the Merit Officer, and the Local Earth God, submitting a petition to the Supreme Mystery. For major funerals, the mourning period is three years and twenty-seven months, not counting intercalary months—this is the system of mourning attire. Daoists only avoid the filth of corpses; once the body is encoffined and the filthy qi is blocked, after one hundred days, they may take temporary leave, dispel the filth, enter the oratory, and resume morning rituals while observing the mourning period for the full three years. □ The old ritual prescribed only one year of mourning, which does not conform to the limits of mourning attire and should not result in the neglect of morning rituals for an entire year. If the coffin has not been interred and one remains by its side, regardless of the time limit, one must not enter the oratory.

For one-year mourning, after one month, the filth-dispelling petition shall be submitted as prescribed.

For one-year mourning where one does not attend the corpse, as well as for nine-month mourning and below where one does not attend the corpse, after three days, one may take temporary leave, dispel the filth, and enter the oratory. Beyond the periods of one-year and nine-month mourning, one need not attend the corpse—avoidance is permissible.

Condolence visits must not be neglected; immediately after, one shall dispel the filth, bathe, and submit a report to the relevant authorities to resume the duties of the divine officers, all in accordance with standard ritual.

**Talisman for Encountering Filth When Entering or Exiting: Return to the Altar and Purify the Body**

Within the Cavern’s Profound Void,
Radiant shines the Supreme Mystery.
The Three Clarities’ Jade Decree illumines the Nine Crossroads,
The mighty spirits of the Eight Directions make me thus by nature.
The Numinous Treasure Talisman universally proclaims to the Nine Heavens:
*Qian-da-na, Dong-luo-gang, Supreme Mystery—*
Slay demons, bind evil, annihilate ten thousand ghosts.
The Central Mountain’s Original Beginning Divine Incantation, Jade Text:
Mystic water washes away filth, repels ghosts, and extends years.
Marching through the Five Peaks and Eight Seas, all take heed.
Demon kings bow their heads, guarding my chariot.
Malevolent filth is swept clean, the Dao’s qi ever abides.

Burn the talisman and recite the Jade Emperor’s Incantation:
Divine spirits, celestial perfected,
Royal fluid, profound nectar.
Upper Clarity’s Flowery Chamber,
Original Beginning, Venerable Lord.
Exquisitely entering the Great Radiance,
Illuminating the profound script.
Seven spirits, flying springs,
Receive smoke at Northern Feng.
I hold the rank of Upper King,
Repelling and uniting demon hordes.
Eight Mighties spew fire,
Reverently purifying your honored spirits.
Thousands upon thousands banish filth,
Malevolence no longer remains.
Myriad upon myriad demon kings,
Preserve life and protect the body.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

Recite the Jade Emperor’s Incantation thrice with the mudra, drawing the qi of the Heavenly Gate. For all altar constructions, sprinkle the altar twice in a circuit.

Whenever attending a mourning household and encountering defiling filth or childbirth, return to the altar and hastily inscribe this talisman. Burn it to ash, mix with pure water, infuse the water with the eastern qi, and consume it.

**Talisman for Ritual Purification and Bathing**

Supreme Numinous Water,
True qi flows unobstructed.
Yin and yang unite in clarity,
Divine candles illumine all sides.
Foul vapors purified,
The doomed and lifeless vanish.
The Three Corpses are stilled,
Longevity and eternal life arise—
The Dao harmonizes with the Perfected.

Recite the bathing incantation thrice, exhale thrice, and stir the water while reciting the stirring incantation:
Golden liquor, jade fluid,
Wash and cleanse the body’s form.
Mystic water purges filth,
Purifying the original spirit.
Seven numina guard and attend,
Myriad qi unfold in array.
Aspiring to purity and emptiness,
Manifesting the images of profound clarity.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance.

**The Rituals of the Nine Morning Repentance and Petition**

**Hair-Combing Incantation**
Mystic blossom of the Mud-Pill Palace,
Preserve essence and ensure its eternal abode.
Left, the Hidden Sun; right, the Root of the Moon.
The Six Harmonies refine and purify,
A hundred spirits receive grace.

Upon reciting this incantation, swallow saliva thrice. Comb the hair toward the auspicious direction. By practicing this regularly, hair will not fall. Comb frequently, taking many strokes without causing pain; one may also have an attendant comb the hair. Thus, blood and fluids flow unobstructed, and hair roots remain firm.

**Bathing Incantation**
Heaven and Earth unfold in clarity,
The Four Great Elements endure as constants.
Mystic water purifies filth,
Dispelling misfortune and ill omens.
Twin youths guard the gate,
Seven Perfected Ones settle in the chamber.
Divine fluid refines and washes,
Myriad qi merge in harmony.
Within and without, integrity is preserved,
Safeguarding this golden robe.

**Headgear and Sash Incantation**
Today is an auspicious and joyous day,
Aligning with the Emperor’s grace.
Dust and defilement are cleansed,
Corpse impurities sink and vanish.
Sins, grime, karmic obstacles—
Inside and out, all is purged and pure.
Inhaling the sun, absorbing the moon,
Treading the Nine Mornings.
Revolving around the Three Terraces,
Circulating through the Five Stars.
Adorning talismans and insignia,
Phoenix robes and tiger skirts.
Holding the profound scripture,
Chanting the numinous verses of the Cavernous Mystery.
Voices resound to the Great Empyrean,
The Five Emperors turn their chariots.
Bestowing upon me the feathered writ,
Ascending to the Supreme Clarity.

**Incantation for Consuming Elixirs and Medicinal Decoctions**
Reverently invoke the Five Elders of the Five Directions,
Summon the celestial physicians and officials of Bian Que,
Fifty each.
May this servant, upon consuming the medicine,
Be freed from illness,
And may illness depart from the body.
Riding the *kui* and mounting the *gang*,
Ascending through the Ten Heavens,
Counted among the Nine Earths,
Life and fortune flourish together,
Achieving immortality and never dying,
Merging with the Dao.

Upon reciting this incantation, face east and consume the medicine.

**General Conduct in Cultivating the Dao**
In practicing this Dao, recite the profound scriptures,
Conduct oneself with refined elegance,
And move in accordance with dignified ritual.
If one acts recklessly or crudely,
Ghosts and spirits will mock,
And the Three Offices will record transgressions,
Noting every deviation from the rules.
Thus, the precepts of fasting and abstinence are set forth for the adept.

To be called a Daoist,
One must adhere to the model of Daoists.
To be called a Perfected One,
One must conform to the standards of the Perfected—
How much more so for a disciple?

**Incantation Before Eating**
The hundred grains and five vermilions
Flow into the intestines and stomach.
The Five Viscera are at peace,
Corpse demons and evil perish.
The Seven Ancestors rest in tranquility,
Achieving long life and eternal vision.

Upon reciting this incantation, knock the teeth thirty-two times, swallow saliva nine times, and then eat.
One should eat before noon,
And avoid eating after the hour of *you*.
Before noon is the time when celestial beings eat;
After *you* is the time of demonic offerings.
Also, do not speak of death while eating,
Lest illness arise.
Do not leave food exposed for long,
Lest malevolent qi approach.
Thus, the Perfected Ones, in cutting off grains and entering the mountains,
Seek the essentials of ascending to immortality.

**Incantation Before Removing Clothes for Sleep**
Receive the mandate of the Great Emperor,
Ascend to the Nine Palaces.
A hundred spirits settle into their positions,
Arrayed to attend the Divine Lords.
Soul and spirit harmonize and refine,
The Five Viscera flourish in splendor.
The hundred limbs are infused with mystery,
The seven fluids brim with numinosity.
Fire and bells intertwine in radiance,
Exterminating ghosts and dispelling misfortune.
May the divine immortals above
Ever live without end.

Upon reciting this incantation, remove clothes and lie down.

**Incantation Before Sleeping**
Heaven has the Nine Stars,
Earth has the Nine Palaces.
The hundred joints of my body
Are accompanied by myriad spirits.
The Three Corpses hide in concealment,
The Five Viscera flow in circulation.
The Three Fields and four limbs
Move and rest in centeredness.
Dragon and Tiger, the Eight Trigrams,
Attend my jade countenance.
Ghosts, demons, and ten thousand spirits,
Do not disturb the true palace.

Knock the teeth twenty-four times, recite the incantation, and knock the teeth again as before.
When lying down, do not open the mouth,
Avoid sleeping on the back like a corpse,
Do not lend clothing, ritual robes, utensils, or vessels to others,
And do not practice qi absorption, guard the Three Ones, or recite profound scriptures—these are especially forbidden.

**Incantation for Knocking on the Door Before Entering the Latrine**
Left, the Spirit of Virtue; right, the Spirit of Purity.
On the left, the Earth-Controlling Lady;
On the right, the Six *Ding* dispel filth.
Remove my name from the register of the dead,
Inscribe my name in the register of the living.

Before entering the latrine, knock on the door three times. Upon reciting the incantation, knock the teeth three times. Do not spit, do not face north, do not look up at the Three Luminaries, and do not allow men and women to enter together—all these invite misfortune.

**Incantation Before Leaving the House**
Emerging from yin into yang,
The Four Paths open in clarity.
Eight spirits and Six *Ding*
Follow me in integrity and uprightness.
Sun and moon flank and assist,
My head bears the Seven Stars.

Knock the teeth seven times, visualize the Seven Stars upon the head, and let the *gang* star point forward.

**Method for Burning Incense**
Whenever entering the oratory to burn incense,
Focus the mind and concentrate the intention.
Visualize the incense smoke,
Do not look back upon exiting the door,
Nor turn to look behind.
When performing rituals, do not speak to others,
Keep the feet together when stepping over the threshold,
And do not hold the incense in the mouth.
Do not use hearth fire to burn incense,
Nor hearth ashes for incense residue—
These contain the dung of hidden dragons,
A great taboo in the Dao.

Instead, use pine or cypress branches and leaves,
Burn them to ash,
And store the ash in the incense burner.
Avoid using pungent vegetables, rank grasses,
Or materials infested with insects, fur, or shells,
Lest they defile the Supreme Perfected.

The Grand Immortal of the Supreme Ultimate often uses the ashes of willow, bamboo, pine, or cypress,
Mixed with mallow or hibiscus leaves and pounded into cakes,
With a small amount of spikenard added.
This mixture is free from impurities,
Burns well,
And lasts long without scattering ash.
Use more for a strong flame,
Less for a prolonged burn.

The Immortals often take ancient rattan roots,
Wash them in flowing water,
Dry them in the sun,
And pound them together with costus root and figwort.
Burning this dispels filth, conveys sincerity,
Summons the Perfected, and invites immortals.
Other pungent or acrid qi should not be used.

Incense must be burned with a strong flame,
So that the smoke rises in a single plume,
And sincerity ascends directly.
Do not let the smoke linger or scatter.
When reciting scriptures, the smoke may be continuous and unbroken.
The key is to hold the breath,
Silently pray with nasal exhalation,
And bow with controlled breathing.
In the principle of bowing with the heart,
Lest the Nine Palaces tilt,
One must align the body with the mind’s submission.

**For Receiving and Reciting Divine Scriptures, Seeking Forgiveness, and Praying for Blessings**
Perform incense rituals at midday during the Three Morning Audiences,
And during the Six Divine Hours of the Supreme Mystery.

The Three Morning Audiences occur at sunrise, midday, and sunset. The Six Divine Hours are midnight, dawn, mealtime, midday, late afternoon, and dusk—these being the six yang hours. If encountering *wuchen* or *wuxu* days, or during fierce winds, violent rain, or great thunder and lightning, one should temporarily cease and wait until the celestial *qi* settles before resuming morning cultivation.

**Entering the Oratory for Audience with the Origin**
The Master said: The oratory must be free from worldly filth and untouched by secular affairs. When establishing an altar, model it after heaven and earth, adapting to the household’s means and the dwelling’s size. Arrange the sacred ranks, face the imperial palace in reverence, maintain solemnity within and without, and purify both body and mind. Through steadfast gaze, commune with the perfected spirits; within the vast primordial chaos, unite with the supreme Dao. This is not merely an empty title to deceive the world.

In temples and monasteries, set up the positions of the Three Realms and the Most High Gods of the various heavens. If residing in a layman’s home, establish the Three Treasures at the center and array the host of immortals to the sides. During morning audiences, face the imperial palace in silent contemplation.

At dawn, calm the spirit and settle the mind. Don your cap and robes, then stand outside the door, visualize the gods of the body arrayed in order, strike the teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

**Incantation:**
*"Great luminous spirit, ninefold verdant radiance,
Morning glow conceals its splendor, refining the five gods.
Palace chariots traverse the six directions, the seven spirits harmonized.
Knots unravel, brilliance scatters, the womb’s root purified.
Strike the teeth nine times."*

Enter the room, turn to the left of the earth’s gate, strike the teeth three times, and recite the secret incantation:

**Morning Entry Incantation:**
*"Four Brightnesses’ merit officers, messengers conveying truth,
Jade lads transmitting words, handmaidens of the oratory,
Convey my words to the altar’s true gods.
Primordial *qi* of the Upper Origin, descend and enter my body."*

After the incantation, form the Jade Clarity mudra, inhale the eastern *qi*, and visualize one merit officer, one messenger, two jade maidens, and one handmaiden of the oratory.

**Night Entry Incantation:**
*"Four Brightnesses’ merit officers, Dragon-Tiger messengers,
Primordial *qi* of the Orthodox Unity, handmaidens of the oratory.
For nighttime petitions, may all be illuminated.
Lads of the Upper Origin, maidens attend me.
Together we enter the altar hall, conveying my words,
That all may ascend and be heard."*

After the incantation, visualize one merit officer, two Dragon-Tiger messengers, one handmaiden of the oratory, one Illuminating Lad, and one Maiden of the Supreme Mystery—a total of six.

Upon entering, visualize the incense officials and messengers, the Two Lords of Dragon and Tiger, the Golden Lad attending incense, and the Jade Maiden transmitting words, flanking the incense table. The sun and moon stand nine inches from the face, the Northern Dipper crowns the head, the *piao* star faces forward, and the three *qi* billow thickly, enveloping the body.

Then hold the breath, settle the spirit, bow with the heart toward the mat, or hold the tablet and bow three times. Strike the teeth nine times and recite the secret incantation:

**Incantation:**
*"Mysterious true Seven Stars, august lords of the luminous soul,
Radiance flows inward, permeating the Dipper’s spirit.
The Three Terraces gleam, the seven fluids entwine.
The golden register guards the tiger, defending the gate of life.
Divine transformation pervades the numinous, the Purple Court governs the wheel."*

After the incantation, present your intentions with focused sincerity. The Nine Gods will descend to the imperial seat, and resonance will surely be attained.

**Silent Memorial:**
*"Your humble servant [Name], in his appointed rank, respectfully memorializes the sacred ranks."*

Deep in my thoughts, I recall how I early entered the Mystic Pass and gained audience with the wondrous Dao. Ashamed that I lack the Ten Virtues to aid the Six Penetrations, I have failed to stir the numinous powers to gratitude and, in my actions, lightly transgressed the precepts. My efforts begin with zeal but end in slackness; my words align with my heart in appearance but not in truth. My conduct is flawed, my burning of incense and cultivation lack discipline. I fear that the Six Palaces will inscribe my transgressions in their luminous records, and the Three Corpses will secretly memorialize my faults and offenses.

On this auspicious day, I humbly offer repentance and gratitude, praying that you will take pity on my ignorance and specially grant me absolution. May the profound merit accumulate through three thousand deeds, and the elixir swiftly reach completion through nine refinements. May the celestial bureaus record my goodness, and the registers of the dead erase my misfortunes. May I obtain the Golden Writ of the Eight Effulgences to refine my qi and cultivate the true, and the Jade Script of the Five Texts to attain the power of long life and enduring vision. May the Dharma remain peaceful, calamities and declines be washed away, the myriad spirits be subdued, and the hordes of demons not intrude. May I establish merit in propagating the teachings and guide the people to support the world. Above, I repay the virtue of my sovereign, teachers, and parents; below, I succor the spirits of the unseen and the stagnant. May the true Dao endure forever, and both form and spirit attain perfection.

I, your humble servant, am overwhelmed with trepidation and awe. Thus, I respectfully speak.

**Morning Departure Incantation:**
*"Emerging from yin into yang, the myriad spirits open the way."*

When the memorial is complete, request the closure of the Yellow Chamber. The Jade Maidens attend in stillness, fully prepared within the numinous palace.

**Night Departure Incantation:**
*"Mysterious and supreme, the Great Yin; the eight windows open with clarity. What has been presented is conveyed by the Maiden of the Way. When the matter is complete and all return to their positions, the myriad spirits withdraw in tranquility."*

After the incantation, depart from the chamber. Within the oratory, sit and concentrate, recalling the practices and secret methods you have mastered in daily cultivation—this is especially excellent. If integrating other methods with their own rituals, follow the original procedures.

**Repentance and Atonement for Transgressions**
The essence of cultivating the true lies first in minimizing faults. If one does not reform from transgressions, the Dao remains distant. Even if one’s practice has not yet ascended to the highest stages of the Way, if conduct is unchecked, how can one subdue ghosts and spirits? How much less can one present memorials, bow in reverence, and deliver the unseen and the manifest? The bureaus of merit and transgression miss nothing, not even the slightest detail.

Xu Yuanzhen of the Jin dynasty retreated into the mountains and forests, diligently cultivating the Dao with wholehearted devotion. Gradually, he entered the ranks of the true, yet the Three Officials dispatched Zhou Fang and others to present him with the vermilion tablets of his transgressions, saying: *"Those who aspire to study the Dao and long for life, who are registered among the immortals, whose profound hearts dwell in the distant, and who revere the lofty spirits, must first attain worldly merit, avoid entanglement in misfortune, let hidden virtue take root, and let benevolence ascend. Only then may they ascend to the true and seek immortality, their names recorded in the Azure Palace."*

From this, it is clear that those who have not yet reached Xu Yuanzhen’s level must surely recognize the need to minimize faults and cultivate themselves. In upholding the Dharma and practicing the teachings, in seeking immortality and studying the Dao, one must repent past transgressions and accumulate future merit.

Thus, the *Treatise on the Mystic Principles* states: *"To correct a fault and not repeat it is merit; to establish a practice and not grow weary is called daily renewing one’s virtue. Heaven will bless such a one."* If one merely speaks of prayer and gratitude while the heart remains unexamined, repeating past transgressions in future actions, adorning the exterior while corrupting the interior, then one’s efforts—whether gazing at the stars, bowing to the moon, observing fasts, upholding precepts, burning incense, or reciting scriptures—will be in vain.

Some boast grand words to deceive the world, claiming that if sins are not accumulated and evil not committed, there is no need for repentance or adherence to the teachings. Such extreme and forced rhetoric, whether excessive or insufficient, is not the Middle Way. One should repent wholeheartedly, recognize faults with certainty, follow the scriptures and teachings, and practice according to the established formats. Thus, one may erase the records of transgressions from the bureaus of the Three Officials and the Five Emperors, and inscribe one’s name in the realms of the Ten Poles and Nine Empyreans. By establishing merit without slackness, ascending in immortal flight is assured. There is no self-obstruction; those with aspiration often succeed.

**Rite of Atonement**
Except for the day after the Autumn Equinox, regularly perform this rite on the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, one’s birthday, the days of *jiǎzǐ* and *gēngshēn*, and other auspicious occasions. Enter the oratory or a pure place in a temple, mountain, or marsh. Burn incense and single-mindedly reflect on past faults.

First, sit silently beside the altar, deeply contemplating all actions and transgressions. Trembling with reverence, rise, adjust your attire, and compose your bearing. Ascend the altar, make your declaration, and perform the ritual. Enter the chamber, recite the incantation, and offer incense according to the proper method. Follow the usual audience rites: in the morning, begin with the East; at noon, with the South; at night, with the North. Perform repentance and atonement for the five directions, adhering to the established ritual format.

After the third offering of incense, bow according to the natural audience protocol. This matter values secrecy, and solitary practice is preferred over complexity. Thus, only the texts for atonement in the four directions are compiled here, with adjustments made as needed.

**Burning Incense and Making Offerings**
The Nine Pure Upper Saints and the myriad spirits of the Three Realms, grant your assent to my words.

On this auspicious day, I purify my heart, repent my transgressions, and bow in prayer for grace. First, I extend my wishes for the imperial dynasty, the altars of soil and grain, the ancestral spirits, and the luminous chariots of the Nine Empyreans, that they bestow blessings for ten thousand generations.

May the present emperor’s foundation endure forever, his reign prosper and flourish. May his sacred longevity parallel heaven and earth, and his virtue and teachings equal creation. May all directions turn toward goodness, the hundred grains ripen in abundance, and all beings with awareness and knowledge awaken to the true Dao. May all, without limit or boundary, ascend together to the realm of glory and joy. May the great transformation flourish, and the true Dharma never decline.

I dare to express my humble wishes, reverently addressing the imperial majesty.

I, your humble servant, am overwhelmed with trepidation and awe. Thus, I respectfully speak.

I, [Name], with sincere devotion, take refuge in the Eastern Azure, Western White, Southern Vermilion, Northern Dark, the four directions and above and below, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions and the Numinous Treasure, the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Emperors, the Star Lords of the Twenty-Eight Constellations encircling heaven, the celestial perfected and upper saints, the True Lords of the Five Peaks, the mountains, rivers, seas, grotto-heavens, blessed lands, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

First facing north, then bowing three times toward the north, kneel in reverence.

In my duly ordained ritual capacity, I, [Name], with wholehearted devotion, surrender body, spirit, and life to the Northern and Northeastern Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Eight Heavenly Lords of the North; the Perfected, Upper Saints, True Persons, and Immortals of the North; the Seven Star Lords of Dipper, Ox, Girl, Void, Danger, House, and Wall; the True Lord Black Emperor of Northern Peak Mount Heng; the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the North; its mountains, rivers, and seas; all true numina; and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Northern Realm.

I have heard that the Great Dao, in its boundless compassion, has revealed the path of repentance for past transgressions. The Perfected and Upper Saints, in their transformative wisdom, have specially opened the means to petition for absolution. Reflecting upon my own foolish and ignorant mortal form, I recognize that by virtue of karmic conditions accumulated in past lives, I have presumptuously encountered the flourishing of the Dao and been graced by the true wind, daring to stand among the ranks of the ordained. Unworthily, I have inherited the lineage of the Mysterious Origin. Yet I have failed to establish merit or benefit the world, and deeply fear that my conduct has strayed from the Way. Moreover, I dread that my myriad ancestors and countless forebears, those who have passed away in times past, as well as my own self across a thousand lives and myriad kalpas—spanning past existences and the present incarnation—have amassed transgressions as deep as the rivers and seas. These are bound within the celestial and terrestrial registers, recorded in the palaces of sun, moon, and stars, never to be pardoned, never to be released, forever subject to divine censure and obstructing the accumulation of good merit. Today, I humbly present this confession and earnestly beseech forgiveness. May the nine generations of my ancestors and the seven lineages of my forebears, along with this present self across ten thousand kalpas and a thousand lives—even unto this day—have all their towering sins dissolved like ice beneath the blazing sun. May the roots of evil be forever severed, and the foundations of goodness be nurtured and strengthened. May I swiftly fulfill my vows and aspirations, encountering the perfected ones. May my living kin and departed family—both ordained and lay—be granted joy in their spiritual rebirth, attaining union with the Dao and becoming true. May all sentient beings be blessed with fortune and together receive the great transformation.

I, your humble servant, am overwhelmed with trepidation and awe. Thus, I respectfully speak.

Next, repent toward the East, South, West, and Center, following the same form as above, altering only the names of the sacred ranks therein.

I, [Name], with wholehearted devotion, surrender body, spirit, and life to the Eastern and Southeastern Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Eight Heavenly Lords of the East; the Perfected, Upper Saints, True Persons, and Immortals of the East; the Seven Star Lords of Horn, Neck, Root, Chamber, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket; the True Lord Bluegreen Emperor of Eastern Peak Mount Tai; the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the East; its mountains, rivers, and seas; all true numina; and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Eastern Realm.

To the Southern and Southwestern Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Eight Heavenly Lords of the South; the Perfected, Upper Saints, True Persons, and Immortals of the South; the Seven Star Lords of Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wings, and Axletree; the True Lord Red Emperor of Southern Peak Mount Heng; the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the South; its mountains, rivers, and seas; all true numina; and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Southern Realm.

To the Western and Northwestern Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Eight Heavenly Lords of the West; the Perfected, Upper Saints, True Persons, and Immortals of the West; the Seven Star Lords of Straddler, Harvester, Stomach, Hairy Head, Net, Turtle Beak, and Three Stars; the True Lord White Emperor of Western Peak Mount Hua; the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the West; its mountains, rivers, and seas; all true numina; and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Western Realm.

To the Upper and Lower Boundless Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy; the Thirty-Six Heavenly Lords of the Three Luminaries, Nine Empyreans, Great Canopy, and Boundless Realms; the Five Elder Thearchs; the celestial bureaus and sovereigns; the innumerable Perfected; the true numina of the Ten Dark Realms of Fengdu; the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns; the True Lord Yellow Emperor of Central Peak Mount Song; the grotto-heavens and blessed lands of the Center; its mountains, rivers, and seas; all divine immortals and spirit officials; and the divine immortals and spirit officials of the Upper and Lower Realms.

Three prostrations to the Boundless Supreme Great Dao.

The Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures. The ancestral masters of Dao attainment, past and present.

Again, your servant [Name] respectfully reaffirms his sincerity, humbly invoking the Boundless Supreme Dao, the August Perfected of the Highest Realms, the majestic numina of the Three Realms, and the host of sages of the Ten Directions. On this day of entering the oratory to present offerings to the True, to confess transgressions and seek forgiveness, I humbly receive the great grace of boundless mercy. May my offenses be erased from the records of the Nether Courts, my name elevated in the registers of immortality, my studies free from demonic trials, and my merits perfected in completion.

How dare I not deeply reflect upon past errors, redouble my resolve, and vow to propagate the Great Teaching? May all beings be universally delivered, the Ten Directions benefited, and the blessings extended to the nine generations of ancestors.

Your servant’s heart is overwhelmed with awe and reverence. Thus, I respectfully speak.

Next, exit the chamber as usual.

This is the residual meaning of the *Natural Audience of the Numinous Treasure*. If one wishes to perform this monthly, the later form should be used, wherein only a general confession is made.

**Daily Natural Audience Rite**
First, enter the chamber, compose the spirit, and quiet the thoughts until inner and outer are luminously clear. Then engage in visualization and, having conveyed the intent to the sages, recite the prayer:

Your servant has heard that when the primordial qi first unfolded its radiance, it grasped the transformative mechanism in the boundless; when the Three Heavens inaugurated their course, they unfurled the mysterious pattern in the vast chaos. The five thousand four hundred sections of scripture were spread below to the dusty world; the thirty-six heavens’ Brahman qi governs above as the great principle. Impartial in bestowing fortune and misfortune, it determines the waxing and waning of all things by fixed reckoning. Transmitting the dharma records, it opens the path of deliverance for humans and devas. The Dao emerged at Crane Cry Mountain, where the Orthodox Unity expounded the essence of cultivating truth. Its merit was proclaimed in the Dragon Han era, when the Primal Origin established the gate of world-transcendence. The Great Dao is beyond naming, yet pure sincerity may reach it.

On this auspicious day of confessing transgressions and presenting offerings to the True, may the Golden Lads proclaim the mandate, the Jade Maidens attend to the incense, and the supplication ascend to the court of wondrous being, directly entering the realm of emptiness and nonbeing. May the seven chariots and eight reins float upon the vast qi through the void; may the Three Realms and Ten Directions be illuminated by numinous radiance, dispelling all defilements.

Your servant, a humble scholar at the threshold of the mysterious pass, newly enrolled in the register of the red tally, has yet to penetrate the subtleties of the profound. Having transgressed the precepts and statutes, I now reverently follow the canonical rites and specially present this confession.

May the August Ones of the Golden Towers and the Sacred Ones of the Jade Capital universally bestow their sagely blessings to wash away my deep transgressions. Grant me renewal, permit me to advance, secretly send down the qi of the Supreme Mystery, and conjoin it to form this body of Numinous Treasure. May I realize the true and constant, eternally dwell in the tranquil shade, and extend my merit to the hidden and manifest. May kindness reach both foes and kin.

May my progress in the Dao be free from demonic hindrances, and may I attain long life and enduring vision.

Your servant’s heart is overwhelmed with awe and reverence. Thus, I respectfully speak.

Kneeling in prolonged repentance.

Your devoted servant, with wholehearted sincerity, surrenders body, spirit, and life to the Three Pure Ones, sovereigns of transformation; to the Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure in the ten directions; and to the host of sages within the *Scripture of Limitless Salvation*.

I reflect again upon my offenses: from kalpas past to this present life, through the three karmic actions and six senses, the five passions and seven desires—my transgressions inscribed in the Black Register, recorded by the statutes of the Mystery. Today, before the radiant and exalted, I humbly offer this confession and repentance. May grace flow to these decayed bones, may the True Bureau bestow life, may my name be erased from the ledger of evil, and may the characters of meritorious deeds be inscribed. May the knots of the primordial womb be untied, the mind’s realm remain unstained, wisdom and insight attain perfection, and demonic obstructions dissolve. Thus may I, though unworthy, slightly aid the transformations of the Mystery, and above, praise the true wind. After attaining the Dao, may I ascend into the formless.

I make ten great vows:

To the Three Pure August Emperors, the Three Primordial Ladies of the Plain, the Most High and Lofty Spirits, and the Great Gods of the Immortal Capital:

On this auspicious day, I declare my aspirations:

First, to soar through the heavens as an immortal of long life;
Second, to harmonize heaven and earth with the radiant winds and clouds;
Third, that the Five Peaks may endure with this body forever;
Fourth, that the seven generations of ancestors be freed from karmic entanglements;
Fifth, that the August Lord sever the bonds of the primordial womb;
Sixth, that in life after life, wisdom and insight unfold;
Seventh, to extinguish malevolent ghosts and harm, cutting down the Six Heavens;
Eighth, to open and penetrate the hidden and reach the numinous;
Ninth, that at this assembly, all may be as spoken;
Tenth, to ascend as a flying immortal and attend the Three Primes.

Bowing again, I dedicate these merits.

I prostrate to the Lord of the Numinous Treasure, the Empty and Mysterious;
To the True Daoist Master of Limitless Salvation;
Whose qi embraces heaven and earth, yet bears no name of virtue;
Whose dharma pervades yin and yang, yet transcends thought and knowledge.
Responding to conditions, transforming to save the multitudes,
Surpassing the Three Realms and the ten directions.

O towering, peerless mountain of merit and virtue,
My heart turns to you, thought after thought, without cease.

Though I, unworthy and foolish, bear this great dharma,
I hope above to dispel the calamities and kalpic destinies of heaven,
And below, to deliver the multitudes of this floating world.
To turn death into life and restore the body,
To heal illness, dispel misfortune, and uphold the upright.
When merit is complete and conduct perfected,
May the Golden Liquid Elixir swiftly form.
When the heart is enlightened and the spirit numinous,
May the Jade Emperor’s decree be swiftly received.

Your servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion.
Thus, I respectfully speak.

Then, departing the chamber as usual.

**Ritual for Worshipping and Invoking the Northern Apex**

It is heard that before the Great Ultimate divided, it embraced the Three Powers and encompassed the primordial qi. Once the Two Modes were distinguished, they harmonized the Seven Governors and balanced the Four Seasons. The Dipper’s pivot turns at the center of heaven, while constellations spread beyond the celestial forms, each assigned to unfold transformation, establishing the pole and upholding heaven. The Eight Kings serve as the origin of the ten thousand beings; the Seven Sages act as the ancestors of all living things. They govern the qi of the seventy-two seasonal nodes and direct the offices of the twenty-eight lunar lodges, revolving the Dipper’s enclosure and circling the earth’s axis. As a chariot, they regulate the cosmic order; as the Northern Apex, they govern the cosmos. Their tongue and throat administer decrees; their pivot and mechanism hold sway. Wherever the pointer stars indicate, the Four Seas know the seasons. When the qi of the Big Dipper shines, the Eight Directions all receive blessings. The Three Terraces align in radiance; the Nine Qi share the same light. They grasp the celestial armillary and balance, determining fortune and misfortune among humankind. Emperor Ming of Han beheld their sagely image; Heavenly Master Zhang received the true scriptures. They established the Mysterious Teachings in the dusty world, liberating beings from the snares of mundane existence. How much more do all things, moving and still, depend on them for life and growth!

Today, your servant reverently performs the Great Rite, vowing to deliver the living and the dead. Without drawing upon the revolutions of the Two Dippers and the transformative workings of Kan and Li, the Great Dao cannot be achieved, nor the Mysterious Barrier entered. Thus, on this auspicious occasion of the descending stars, I offer this earnest prayer. May the Seven Stars deign to look upon me, their cloud chariots briefly descending from the celestial sphere. May the Two Emperors graciously descend, their majestic presence alighting upon the altar’s tranquility. Inscribe my name in the register of the living; strike it from the ledger of the dead. May the true qi of the Seven Primes ever fill me; may the spirit-lords of the five viscera each be preserved. May I swiftly awaken to the principle of true constancy and receive the compassion of the supreme Dao.

Your servant’s heart is overwhelmed with fervent devotion. Thus, I respectfully speak.

**Talisman for Summoning Xuanwu**
The pure practices of all heavens encircle the ten directions. The boundless great spirits all issue from my body. Wherever this saving talisman arrives, it merges with the Mysterious Darkness. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and ordinances.

**Talisman for Summoning the Northern Dipper**
Let the jade armillary and balance halt their turning. Holding the talisman and grasping the register, all assemble before the Emperor. A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—naturally they attain reality. Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Great Statutes and Ordinances of the Numinous Treasure.

*Here ends Scroll Nine of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Purity*
*Scroll Ten of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Purity*

**The Three Realms’ Governance: The Sovereign of the Mysterious Heavens**
*Transmitted by Dongwei Gaoshi, Illuminating and Salvific Perfected One Ning Quanzhen, to Wang Qizhen, Lineal Master of the Lingbao Tradition and Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity*

The Mysterious Master declared:
The lofty perfected and exalted sages collectively record the mysteries of the boundless heavens. In their wondrous existence and wondrous non-existence, they remain unfathomable. Only with the emergence of scriptures is their mechanism gradually revealed. The orthodox regulations of the Three Caverns are profound in principle.

After the Great Tang, scriptures and decrees scattered and were lost. Later generations patched and supplemented them, mingling the authentic with the spurious. Only those of discernment can distinguish the subtle and profound, barely grasping even a ten-thousandth part.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning is the most revered of the Nine Sages, the source of all transformations. The mysterious qi of the Dao arises from spontaneity and non-being, beyond all comparison or conjecture. Dispersed, it becomes qi; gathered, it takes form. Within it dwells spirit, forcibly named the Celestial Venerable—hence the title *Celestial King of Primordial Beginning*. This is the exalted Dao of Supreme Purity, the Supreme August One of the Jade Registers, who dwells in the Sagely Realm of Jade Purity and governs the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Metropolis.

The Celestial Venerable of Numinous Treasure is the progenitor of the Nine Perfected, the lofty sage of Supreme Purity, the primordial qi of the Dao. In terms of teachings, the Primordial Beginning corresponds to the Cavern of Perfection; from here, it diverges into the Cavern of Mystery. The *Dao of Salvation for Humankind in the Highest Grade of Numinous Treasure*, received by the Jade Dawn, is the disciple of the Primordial Beginning, the patriarch of Supreme Purity, and the Supreme August One of Grand Purity. This is the *Celestial Venerable of the Mysterious August Jade Dawn*, who dwells in the True Realm of Supreme Purity and governs the Jeweled Palace of Liao Yang in the Golden Gates.

The Celestial Venerable of Dao and Virtue is the master of the Nine Immortals’ teachings, the primordial qi of the Dao’s inception. In terms of teachings, from the Primordial Beginning to this point is the Cavern of Divinity, known as the *Celestial King of Grand Purity, the Mysterious August Dao Lord of the Golden Gates, the Posterior Sage*. He receives the decrees of the Primordial August and the Void August, proclaims the texts of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, responds to circumstances in all directions, expounds the teachings, and transmits the scriptures. Revered through the ages, he is venerated by all under heaven. Since the era of the Three Sovereigns, he has proclaimed the scriptures of Numinous Treasure, delivering countless beings across the ages. Celestial and human ranks honor him, and the Dual August Ones confer upon him the title *Supreme Venerable Lord Lao*, who dwells in the Immortal Realm of Grand Purity.

The August Emperor of the Vast Heavens is the emperor of all heavens, the king of immortals and perfected beings, the lord of sagely venerables. He holds authority over the ascent and descent of the myriad heavens and the mechanism of all beings’ generation and completion. The Three Caverns and Four Supplements are the standards of the scriptures of prohibitions. The Great Brahma is supremely wondrous, the divine might of non-action. He is the August Emperor of the Three Realms, the myriad deities, and the immortals and perfected beings of the Three Caverns. From the celestial progeny of the Three Qi and the imperial lineage of the Three Treasures, he transcends beyond heaven and earth, generating the myriad things yet not governing them.

When the Three Powers first took form, qi clarified and ascended, accumulating yang to become heaven. As the source of the myriad phenomena, how could it lack a ruler? Thus, in terms of form and image, it is called *Heaven*; in terms of governance, it is called *Emperor*. Hence, he is titled *August Emperor of the Jade Perfection, the Mysterious Heavens, the Most Sagely Jade Sovereign*. The scriptures state: *The realm of the Jade Perfection, the colorless heaven, is the practice of Brahma*. Born through transformation from the mysterious qi, he dwells below the Great Net and above Supreme Purity, governing the four kinds of Brahma heavens and presiding over the Three Realms. This is the Heavenly Lord, a title reluctantly bestowed out of necessity. He governs the Jade Purity Palace of the Grand Tenuity.

Such phrases as *the Celestial Venerable of the Unsurpassed Heaven of Maitreya* are expressions of reverence in the Daoist tradition. The titles *Supreme One Who Opens Heaven and Grasps the Talisman to Govern the Calendar* and the like are honorifics bestowed by the emperors of the Great Song.

The Celestial Venerable of Salvation through the Great One arises from the Primordial Qi of the First Azure, a manifestation of the Primordial Beginning. He is the teacher of the Nine Sages, Nine Perfected, and Nine Immortals, governing the primordial qi of universal salvation. He is titled *Celestial Venerable of Salvation through the Great One, the August Emperor of the Azure Mystery, the Primordial August Sovereign of the World of Everlasting Joy in the Eastern Ultimate’s Azure Palace*. He administers the ten directions and responds to transformations across kalpas. The Celestial Venerable is not a perfected one of cultivated attainment but a royal descendant of the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, a divine manifestation of the mysterious qi. He governs the Left Bureau of the Azure Mystery.

The Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen is the imperial throne within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. According to the *Treatise on Astronomy*, the Southern Culmen sinks thirty-six degrees into the earth, while the Northern Culmen rises thirty-six degrees above it. The heavens tilt, half emerging above the earth and half encircling it. The myriad stars and qi all revolve leftward, with the Southern and Northern Culmina as their pivot, the only fixed points—thus enabling the heavens’ rotation. Though people perceive it in the north, it truly resides at the center of the heavens, serving as the ancestral lord of the myriad stars and the secondary lord of the Three Realms, subordinate only to the August Emperor of the Vast Heavens. It corresponds to the primordial qi and is titled *Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen and Purple Tenuity*, governing the Purple Tenuity Palace at the Center of Heaven. Some claim the Great Emperor of Purple Tenuity is the great deity of all heavens, the emperor of the myriad deities and spirits of the Three Realms, deceiving the mortal world and profaning the supreme mystery—such errors must be vigorously corrected.

The Great Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign is the star to the left of the Northern Culmen’s imperial throne, its form linked and slightly curved like a hook, named *Curved Array*. Below it lies a great star, positioned at its center—this is the Great Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign. He governs the myriad stars and is the emperor of all celestial bodies and constellations, equal in rank to the Northern Culmen. While the Northern Culmen serves as the pivot, the Celestial Sovereign revolves with the heavens, corresponding to the qi of primordial beginning. Below the Three Qi and above the myriad heavens, within the Three Realms, none fail to revere these Three Emperors. He governs the Jeweled Palace of the Curved Array. Some speak of the *Great Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign in the Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity*—this is even more deceptive. The present Celestial Sovereign is the one below the Curved Array within the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. Thus, it may be called the Purple Tenuity Enclosure or the Palace of the Curved Array. The *Upper Palace of Purple Tenuity* refers to the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, not the Purple Tenuity Enclosure. A single character’s difference carries grave consequences.

During the Great Tang, the Venerable Lord Lao was honored as the *August Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign and Sagely Ancestor*—a temporary ritual of ancestral veneration by the Tang house, unrelated to the Celestial Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity Enclosure.

Do not recklessly invoke names and titles without examining past and present—this is a matter for careful discernment.

The *August Celestial Venerable, Great Emperor of Life-Preservation and Sagely Ancestor*, according to ancient texts, was originally the *True Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Command*. On the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month in the first year of *Great Central Auspiciousness* under the reign of Emperor Zhenzong of the Great Song, he descended into the *Hall of Extended Grace*. Six perfected beings stood in attendance to his left and right, declaring themselves the primal ancestors of the Zhao lineage.

At the time, Wang Qinruo served as chief minister. He promptly issued an imperial edict conferring the exalted title: *High Dao, Supreme Numinous One of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Command, August Celestial Venerable, Great Emperor of Life-Preservation and Sagely Ancestor*. The consort of the Life-Command was also honored as the *Sagely Ancestral Mother*, receiving the exalted title *Great Sage Empress of the Primordial Heaven*.

From then on, he was ranked among the celestial emperors, occupying the highest of the nine positions. The realm had no choice but to comply with the imperial decree.

Some claim the *Yellow Dragon’s Unified Qi, Life-Commanding and Life-Preserving Celestial Venerable* is the sovereign of immortals and transcendent beings, the august one of emperors, kings, and feudal lords. What proof supports this? Before the *True Temple* era, before the Sagely Ancestor’s descent, who then was the august one of emperors, kings, and feudal lords?

The gentleman, in matters he does not understand, how can he speak with certainty, leading later scholars astray and leaving endless ridicule?

The Master said: Who does not know that the Three Clarities and Three Realms’ Celestial Venerables are the Primordial, Mysterious, and Originative Three Qi? Yet when qi gathers, it takes form; when it scatters, it returns to qi—this is the source of the myriad transformations, the ancestor of the Three Powers, the root of Heaven and Earth. It cannot be named, nor can it be discussed.

When the Crimson Clarity inaugurated the kalpa and the Great Dao radiated its light, whether through fire refining the firmament or the August Person wielding the brush, true scriptures descended to the world, and the Three Caverns were proclaimed. Thus arose the divisions of *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), and *Dongshen* (Cavern of Divinity), and the designations of *Heavenly Treasure*, *Numinous Treasure*, and *Divine Treasure*. After the Middle Antiquity, rituals and laws were established, each of the Three Caverns possessing its own scriptural catalog—hence the term *Three Vehicles and Nine Grades*.

The Dao’s obscurity lies in its ineffability; thus, teachings were founded to reveal its function. Some, however, recount it thus: *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning) is the ancestor within the Dao, the patriarch of the *Lingbao* (Numinous Treasure) tradition; *Daojun* (Dao Lord) is the ancestor within the Dharma, the master of the lineage; *Laojun* (Lord Lao) is the ancestor within the teachings, the true master. The *Savior from Suffering Celestial Venerable* and the Ten Celestial Venerables are termed *Mystic Masters*. Alas! The Three Caverns and Four Supplements are the source of Dharma records; the Nine Grades and Three Vehicles interpenetrate. To claim that the Three Clarities each govern one division—this obstructs principle. If so, would not the propagation of teachings to deliver beings be erroneous?

The *Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Celestial Venerable* presides over the salvation of the living and the dead from the sufferings of the Three Realms, governing the Ten Heavens. The *August Lord of Eastern Florescence* is the one who bestows scriptures upon male and female perfected immortals, the master who instructs the *Life-Commanding* sovereign, ruling the *Palace of Square Cauldrons* in the Eastern Florescence. The *August Mother of Supreme Mystery of the Western Origin* is the sovereign who registers male immortals, female immortals, and perfected persons, ruling the *Tortoise Terrace of Western Numinosity*. The *Scriptural Masters of the Numinous Treasure* may receive exalted scriptures to oversee prohibitions, manifesting texts in response to kalpas to deliver beings—such is *Yu Luoqiao Perfected*. The *Register Masters of the Numinous Treasure* may govern the statutes of divine writ, presiding over the recording of merits to elevate ranks, bestowing talismans and immortality to deliver beings—such is *Zhen Dingguang Perfected*. The *Deliverance Masters of the Numinous Treasure* may follow primordial statutes to expound teachings, proclaiming the mysterious norms to accord with the true, responding to conditions and transforming accordingly—such is *Guang Miaoyin Perfected*. The latter three perfected beings jointly administer the three offices, collectively overseeing the thirty-six divisions of exalted scriptures, talismans, and charts, compiling the *Central Alliance’s Treasure Declarations*, which flow into the mortal realm to ferry celestial and human beings. These were entrusted to *Xu Laile*, the *Perfected of the Great Ultimate*, who transmitted them to *Ge Xuan*, the *Immortal Elder of the Great Ultimate*. Later generations, unaware of the truth, have seen genuine transmission continue unbroken.

Those like *Bao Nanhai* and *Feng Qingniu*, though they received talismans and charts, were not within the purview of the Three Masters. In the Jin dynasty, *Yang Yuan* and *Lord Xu* obtained the *Golden Writ of the Numinous Treasure*, which was bestowed upon them by the *Upper Perfected Wei Yuanjun*. Moreover, *Xu Miaoji Perfected Lord* received teachings from *Chenmu* and *Filial Dao Mingwang*—all within the purview of the *Mystic Masters*. Later scholars, inheriting teachings from their masters, each recognize their lineage and know their masters.

The *Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm* arose after *Yuanshi* established the teachings. By the first year of the *Upper Sovereign* kalpa, the five kalpas unfolded simultaneously, the Five Phases attained completion, and the Five Qi were fully endowed. From this, the various perfected beings and immortals were transformed, responding within the five kalpas to generate the essence of the Mystic Realm, and the mystic within the essence—all were the *Upper Sovereign*, hence the kalpa was named *Upper Sovereign*. Within the five kalpas, the *Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm* was transformed, receiving the quintessence of the Five Qi. Together with the *Heavenly Perfected August Person*, they assembled clouds into chapters, and from the dragon’s embryo and stone’s radiance emerged myriad talismanic writings. The three divisions and ten sections were all established as canonical texts, and only then did the *Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm* found the teachings.

*Yuanshi* transformed and gave birth to the heavens in the *Ancestral Kalpa*. The *Ancestral Kalpa* comprises the *Dragon Han*, *Yan Kang*, *Crimson Clarity*, *Inaugural Sovereign*, and *Upper Sovereign* kalpas. The *Great Veil Heaven* is the abode of the formless, encompassing Heaven and Earth, boundless and inexhaustible. The scriptures say: "Above, there is no further ancestor; only the Dao is its body." Within the five kalpas, Heaven and Earth were transformed. From the *Great Veil’s* single qi, the Three Heavens were born—these are the realms of the Three Clarities. From the Three Heavens’ qi descended to generate the Nine Heavens:

First, the *Boundless Heaven of No Shadow and Utmost Singularity*;
Second, the *Heaven of Supreme Goodness and Boundless Longevity*;
Third, the *Heaven of Cavernous Emptiness and Utmost Extension*;
Fourth, the *Heaven of Jade Void and Primordial Cavernous Stillness*;
Fifth, the *Heaven of Cavernous Extremity and Boundless Unarrogant Joy*;
Sixth, the *Heaven of Utmost Primordial Radiance and Cavernous Subtlety, Responsive to Sound*;
Seventh, the *Heaven of Supreme Namelessness and Mystic Treasure*;
Eighth, the *Heaven of the Great Ultimate and Boundless Cavernous Seclusion*;
Ninth, the *Heaven of Primordial Cavern and Harmonious Response*.

Each of the nine heavens further generates three heavens, totaling thirty-six heavens—these are what the scriptures call the heavens of *Upper Clarity*. The lofty and formless are all termed *Upper Clarity*, not merely designating a single realm.

Next, the *Seed People* were divided into the Three Realms and the Thirty-Two Heavens, governing the four directions, situated below the Nine Heavens and above the Three Luminaries. Palaces and chambers are apportioned with graded hierarchies, descending to connect with the constellations, their primordial qi interlinked, giving birth to and transforming the myriad things, refining and completing the ten thousand categories.

Beyond these lie the *Eight Poles and Eight Heavens*, and the *Outer Demon Heaven*, situated below the Thirty-Two Heavens and beyond the Three Luminaries. The *Eight Poles and Eight Directions*, from the *Heaven of Pure Tenuity* to the *Outer Brahma Heaven*, total eighty. Their palaces and towers are formed from natural qi. Thus, the *Vacuous Sovereign* appointed each with an *Imperial Lord*, assisted by *Heavenly Ministers*, and provided them with officials and subordinates, dividing among them the people and creatures. Together with the *Great Veil’s* single qi, they constitute the Eighty-One Heavens.

As the Dao’s qi descended, the Nine Earths were generated:

First, the *Earth of Colored Moisture*, named *Primordial Virtue*, its qi above blue and within yellow—governed by the *Minister of Primordial Earth*.
Second, the *Earth of Rigid Color and Moisture*, named *August Virtue*, its qi pervading—governed by the *Assistant Minister of Primordial Court*.

Third, the *Earth of Stone-Fat Color and Moisture*, named *Imperial Virtue*, its qi pervading with dark green—governed by the *Dragon-Mouth Earth Dragon*.
Fourth, the *Earth of Moisture*, named *Kingly Virtue*, its qi pervading with yellow—governed by the *Primordial Heart Earth Grand General*.
Fifth, the *Earth of Golden Millet Moisture*, named *Human Virtue*, its qi pervading with red—governed by the *Primordial Blessing Earth Magistrate*.
Sixth, the *Earth of Metal-Rigid Iron Moisture*, named *Water Virtue*, its qi pervading with white—governed by the *Primordial Bone Earth Elder*.
Seventh, the *Earth of Water-Restrained Moisture*, named *Village Virtue*, its qi pervading with purple—governed by the *First Earth Parents*.
Eighth, the *Earth of Great Wind Moisture*, named *Returning Virtue*, its qi pervading with blue-green—governed by the *Progenitor Earth Ancestral Minister*.
Ninth, the *Earth of Abyssal Depth and Colorless Network*, named *Flourishing Virtue*, its qi pervading with boundless hue—governed by the *Xuan-Progenitor Earth Subordinate of the Two Thousand Stone*.

These are called the *Nine Ramparts*, each rampart containing one layer of earth, water, and wind, stacked in sequence. Thus, the *Vacuous Sovereign* further appointed the *Four Earth Sovereign Lords* to jointly oversee the palaces, their assistance and descent equal, modeled after the heavens above. In all, thirty-six *Earth Sovereign Lords*, corresponding to the thirty-six emperors of the nine-tiered heavens.

Beneath the Nine Ramparts lies the vast and boundless *Obdurate Void*, enclosed by *Wind Moisture*. This *Wind Moisture* is the qi of the *Primordial Brahma Wind*. Harder than true metal, it is also called *Rigid Wind*. It upholds the Nine Ramparts, bearing all heavens aloft, floating high and hollow, suspended without fall, connecting above to the *Great Veil*—for it is the qi of the Dao. Thus, the scripture states: *"Wind Moisture pervades the void, the Metal-Rigid bears the heavens."*

As the *Three Caverns* intermingle and transform, the *Nine Qi* blend and arise, floating upon the *Grand Primal*, emptying into the *Four Voids*. In their vastness of form and image, only the Dao can encompass them.

The Five Kalpas are named:
*Primordial Progenitor Kalpa*
*Vast and Boundless Kalpa*

The Five Kalpas are further named:
*Dragon Han*
*Yan Kang*
*Yi Ming*
*Kai Huang*
*Shang Huang*

From these arise the manifold heavens, within the primordial chaos:
The *Great Veil’s* Two Realms,
The Nine Tiers and Thirty-Six Heavens,
The Jade Purity Realm’s Twelve Heavens,
The Highest Purity Realm’s Twelve Heavens,
The Supreme Purity Realm’s Twelve Heavens.

The *Seed People* dwell within the Three Realms and Thirty-Two Heavens.
The Thirty-Two Heavens correspond to the qi of the constellations.
To the right lie the twenty-eight heavens of the four directions,
each heaven aligned with the qi of one constellation.
The four heavens of the four cardinal interstices each correspond to one constellation,
while the qi of the *Brahma Heavens* descends and intermingles in equal measure.
The heaven of the northeast overlaps the constellation of the northwest,
for the birth of the supreme turns and ascends like the spiral of a ram’s horn.
Though the flow of principle’s current shares the same purport,
confusion arises from the cardinal and intercardinal directions—
thus this diagram is made to clarify.

The *Three Luminaries*:
The thirty-five divisions gather the primordial qi in the *Upper Mystery*.
The Seven Lords of the Northern Dipper,
together with the twenty-eight constellations of the four directions,
form thirty-five divisions,
collecting the primordial qi in the highest heaven to govern creation.

The Northern Dipper is the *Central Dipper*.
The *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* in the *Records of the Grand Historian* states:
“The Dipper is the Emperor’s chariot,
revolving through the center of heaven,
overseeing the four quarters,
dividing yin and yang,
establishing the four seasons,
harmonizing the Five Phases,
shifting the nodes and degrees,
and settling all affairs.”
Beyond the Eight Extremes lies the *Brahma Heaven*.

Within the realm lie immortal domains—
the Five Sacred Peaks, Three Isles, and Ten Continents of *Shenzhou*—
all beneath the *Three Luminaries*,
above the great earth,
amidst the vast seas.

The peaks are called *zhen* ("pillars"), for the earth’s profound virtue bears all things without shifting.
The Five Sacred Peaks, Three Isles, and Ten Continents are the abodes of immortals and sages.
*Shenzhou* is the Middle Kingdom, where the sovereign resides,
the greatest of all lands within the realm.
Its people cultivate the true Dao and ascend to become *xianzhen* (immortal perfected).
Above lie the Ten Great Grotto-Heavens, Thirty-Six Lesser Grotto-Heavens, and Seventy-Two Blessed Lands,
all governed by immortal officials.

Within the Grotto-Heavens stand Five Mountains, also called the Five Sacred Peaks,
serving as the pillars of the Middle Kingdom—lesser lands are not enumerated among them.

The *Nine Ramparts of the Grotto Abyss*:
The *Eight Mighty Beasts*—
dragon, *lin*, tiger, leopard, lion, cinnabar serpent, celestial steed, and fierce beasts.

The *Eight Sceneries*—
sun, moon, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, and the Five Dippers of the stars.

The *Eight Obscurities*—
eastern extremity, southeastern extremity, southern extremity, southwestern extremity,
western extremity, northwestern extremity, northern extremity, northeastern extremity.

The *Eight Gates*—
Eastern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Southeastern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Southern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Southwestern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Western Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Northwestern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Northern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven,
Northeastern Gate of the Dharma Wheel of Heaven.

The *Thirty-Two Heavens* in Summary:
The Master states:
From *Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven* to *Shangming Qiyao Moye Heaven*—
these six heavens comprise the *Realm of Desire*.
From *Xuwu Yueheng Heaven* to *Wuji Tanshi Heaven*—
these eighteen heavens comprise the *Realm of Form*.
From *Haoting Xiaodu Heaven* to *Taisu Xiule Jin Shang Heaven*—
these four heavens comprise the *Formless Realm*, collectively known as the *Three Realms*.
From *Taixu Wushang Changrong Heaven* to *Taiji Pingyu Jiayi Heaven*—
these four heavens are the heavens of the *Seed People*.

This scripture is now examined and divided into twelve matters:
1. Heavenly names and kalpas—names established at the primordial division.
2. Imperial titles—titles bestowed by the *Yuanshi* (Primordial Beginning).
3. Imperial taboos—the names of the Heavenly Emperors.
4. The Heavenly Emperor’s governance—the office overseeing the Dao.
5. The palace of residence.
6. The domain of rule.
7. The *qi* of the constellations—descending through the twenty-eight lodges.
8. The name of the *qi*—the designation of the primordial *qi* received.
9. The color of the *qi*—the hues of the nine *qi* dividing the directions.
10. The *Great Brahma Hidden Speech*—the inner sound, compiled by the *Dao Lord*.
11. The boundaries—ascension and descent between upper and lower realms.
12. The number of heavenly citizens—their lifespans.

This diagram is the essence of the most precious scriptures;
those who recite and uphold it should study it in detail and practice accordingly.

**Offices of the Resplendent Transcendent Administrations of All Heavens**

The Master said: Within the Jade Clarity, there reside the Resplendent Heavenly Generals and Great Divinities, all under the command of the Jade Clarity Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery. Equal in merit to the Three Heavens’ Great Marshals of Lofty Numen, they style themselves the Jade Clarity Numinous Treasure Resplendent Office. They assist and protect the Jade Clarity, transform kalpas and renew epochs, extinguish demons and sweep away disasters, deliver the disciples of immortal study, inspect and regulate the Three Realms, expel malevolent spirits, strictly govern the Northern Feng, restrain and command spectral beings, search out demonic encampments, and purify the Dao-qi, preparing the seed-people of later generations to behold the Sagely Lord of Great Peace—all these are the divine powers of support and sweeping eradication.

Within the Jade Clarity exists the Heaven-Ascension Certificate, bestowed upon those who attain the Dao and ascend as immortals. When the Heavenly Worthy grants the certificate, it is also conferred upon suffering souls to be delivered, enabling them to proceed to the Southern Palace. Without this certificate, the gatekeepers of Heaven will bar their way and forbid their advance. Only by seeking and obtaining the certificate can one traverse the passes of all heavens, so that the gates of Heaven impose no hindrance.

Those who petition the Heavens to eradicate the Three Evils do so because, internally, the Three Karmic Actions summon them, while externally, the Three Poisons engender transgressions, leading to their fall into the Three Evil Paths of ghosts, beasts, and hells. Yet once they receive deliverance in the Jade Clarity today, they ascend according to their celestial stems, belonging to the Thirty-Two Heavens. As master and disciple traverse the passes, they petition for the eradication of the Three Evils: internally, they eliminate the Three Karmic Actions of body, mind, and speech; externally, they sever the Three Poisons of greed, hatred, and delusion. Thus, hells have no cause for their descent, ghosts no means of entry, and beasts no path of transformation. Even after receiving deliverance and eradicating the Three Evils, if the internal and external karmic poisons of the Three Evils remain unremoved, they still cannot escape falling.

When a person is born, above lie twelve joints, the roots of dead qi transmitted by parents. In the center are twelve knots, the roots of dead qi inherent in the body. Below are twelve wombs, the roots of dead qi passed to descendants. All these harbor hells. Therefore, when receiving talismans, one must also sever them: internally, eliminate the thirty-six roots; externally, restrain the six roots from evil destinies. Once the earthly roots are severed, debts sealed, and forms enclosed, one soars through the Five Gates, gains inscription in the Great Mystery, and under the surveillance of demon kings, ascends the gates of Heaven. On this day of ascending the Jade Clarity with flesh and bone together, the decree of deliverance is fulfilled.

The aforementioned Divine Duke receives the mandate of sweeping eradication. This Divine Duke is the minister Ma Zu of the Earthly Sovereign, the heir of the Great Thearch’s Horned Dragon, and the father of the celestial gods of the lunar lodges. His rank is Jade Clarity Divine Duke, Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery, styled Ma Long, with the personal name Kuo Yi. Whenever one wishes to employ him, summon him with the Resplendent Talisman of Myriad Divinities, and he will descend in accordance with the command. The numinous officials of the passes of all heavens number one hundred and twenty.

The Incense Officers are the descendants of the Three Sovereigns, serving the sixty *jia-zi* days. There are thirty-two of them, who straighten the fragrant *qi*, disperse filth, and summon the true—fulfilling their duties to pacify the root of life, transformed from the *qi* of the Six *Jia*.

Though the myriad spirits are not limited to thirty-two persons, for memorials and summons, only the celestial numbers of the four directions are employed—thirty-two persons. Each heaven has two Three-Five Merit Officers, one Left Attendant Envoy, one Right Attendant Envoy, one Incense-Bearing Golden Lad, one Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden, one Direct Attendant for each of the Five Thearchs, and one Daily Incense Officer. Each heaven thus totals twelve persons, and the thirty-two heavens collectively comprise three hundred sixty persons. Each of these—one Merit Officer and two others—refers to one for each of the Three Heavens and Five Thearchs, corresponding above to the twelve hundred official lords and harmonizing below with the thirty-six thousand spiritual *qi*.

The Master states: Within the Jade Clarity’s Numinous Void Palace and the Numinous Treasure’s Celestial Immortals’ Inner Court, there are bureaus of transcendent officials apportioned to serve the celestial officials. Their commands all descend from the Highest Clarity.

Ghosts and spirits preside over the hidden darkness, fundamentally beyond the comprehension of worldly people. Yet practitioners must somewhat grasp the correct principles of heaven and earth and roughly understand the origins and development of the teachings. Without knowledge of past and present or examination of the scriptures, how can one recklessly conjecture and mislead later learners? Is this not grievous?

Moreover, in matters of memorials and petitions, what is sought must have a basis to be spoken of. One should observe the forty-nine ranks of methods, wherein the Three Realm Lords are regarded as the Three Masters, the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy as the True Master—also called the Mysterious Master—differing somewhat from the old ways.

Moreover, there exist designations such as the *Office of Bestowed Transcendents*, the *Office of Radiant Transcendents*, and the *Office of Transcendents Revered by the Three Realms*, each derived from a single sentence in the scriptures to form a bureau. For instance, the prohibition against "detaining or coercing ghostly multitudes" refers to souls destined for deliverance, who, having departed the hidden darkness, must not again be subjected to detention or coercion among ghostly throngs—this merely extends the meaning of the preceding text. Yet now, a single sentence is arbitrarily taken to establish an office.

Another example is the phrase "nothing it does not repel," which describes the efficacy of the middle section of the text. Yet without careful consideration of the scriptural intent, it too is appropriated as an office. Such fragmentation of passages and disruption of sentences utterly lacks coherence or principle. Given that the *Three Caverns* and *Four Supplements* comprise tens of thousands of scrolls, if every phrase were thus extracted to name a bureau, would this not be excessive?

Wang Shengqing’s *Comprehensive Examination of the Lingbao Great Rites* contains many corrections, yet in this regard, he failed to excise these errors, which is deeply regrettable. Since these designations have long circulated among the various schools, they must now be preserved as they stand. Among them, only the *Office of Radiant Transcendents* retains some semblance of coherence, though upon closer examination, it merely extols the might and virtue of demonic kings. Other offices, such as the *Bureau of Ritual Offerings* or the *Bureau of Descending Sages*, are likewise unsound.

From ancient times to the present, the transmitted registers of the *Luo Tian* rites for invoking the sages have been comprehensive and complete, yet they contain no such bureaus. The *Celestial Pivot Institute* resides beneath the *Three Celestial Gates*, as detailed in the *Rituals for Memorial Petitions*. It is properly called the *Southern Culmen Celestial Pivot Institute*. The *Northern Culmen* marks the center of heaven, and only beyond it does one reach the *Celestial Gates*. The *Southern Culmen*, by contrast, descends thirty-six degrees into the earthly portal, directly opposing the *Northern Culmen*. Yet now, these are confused and inverted, ignorant of north and south. How can petitions submitted through such error not be contrary to the Dao?

Therefore, this text first expounds the *Mysterious Vault’s Sovereign*, clarifying the source of the *Three Qi*. It then severs these from the *Three Realms’ Offices and Bureaus*, providing a complete register for memorials and petitions. Whether aiding the living or delivering the deceased, all may be referenced accordingly.

Though the *Transcendent Offices and Mysterious Bureaus* are not entirely abolished, they must not be employed in perpetuation of error. One must weigh them carefully and act in accordance with principle.

*Shangqing Lingbao Great Rites*, Scroll Ten, concludes.
*Shangqing Lingbao Great Rites*, Scroll Eleven, begins.

The Venerable Master of Subtle Mysteries, Radiant Light Savior of Suffering Perfected One Ning Quanzhen, bestows upon the Shangqing Three Caverns Disciple, Lingbao Preceptor and Lineage Master Wang Qizhen:

**Gate of Descending Perfected Ones and Summoning Spirits**

The Master states: The *Celestial Sovereign’s Descending Perfected Talisman* and the *Vacuous Sovereign’s Summoning Spirits Talisman* are the *Flying Mystery Qi* of the Three Heavens, natural scriptures for summoning the myriad spirits of the Three Origins. Disciples who hold office in the pure celestial ranks and govern the numinous void’s true grades—should they wish to descend the hundred Perfected Ones and command the thousand spirits—must use a cyan silk cloth seven feet and two inches in length, inscribing at its center the *Descending Perfected Talisman* in vermilion and the *Summoning Spirits Talisman* in flying yellow script, then place it within the oratory. Spread a mat of yellow brocade or yellow silk for the offering rite. After a hundred days, the *Descending Perfected and Summoning Spirits Envoys*—jade maidens and golden lads, three each—will descend in response to the rite, standing guard over the true scriptures. All the thousand Perfected Ones and myriad spirits summoned will descend into the chamber.

If one’s learning is not sincere and steadfast, the Five Marchmounts will test them. To lightly reveal these secrets is to render the summons inefficacious. When invoking the Perfected Ones, spirits, and deities of the Three Heavens, all must arrive before the talismans; without the divine scriptures, it is a false summons. Even with utmost devotion and exhaustive effort, not a single spirit will descend. Should any appear, they are often demonic trials.

Recipients must adhere to the statutes of the *Mystic Capital’s Regulations*: prepare three plain silks, measure them by the year’s span, and present them to a master versed in the scriptures. The talismans are drawn in the air and memorized by heart, never recorded in writing, lest ghosts, spirits, birds, or beasts steal and leak them.

Within these two talismans are twelve talisman officials who oversee the altar. When establishing an altar with these talismans, they transform the space into the realm of the *Golden Gates’ Brahmanic Practices*, enabling the performance of rites and transformations. Only then does one proceed to the inner audience of the Three Heavens’ Golden Gates, practicing the Dao of *Descending Perfected Ones and Summoning Spirits*. When inscribing, use the *Jade Purity Mudra*, inhale the *Heavenly □ Gate Qi* three times, and blow it onto the talismanic script to complete it.

Fire is hurled a thousand miles; the flowing bells surge in eight directions.
Should any dare to resist or obstruct the Highest Perfected,
they shall be struck down by blades of iron, punished by the mighty Queen of Heaven.
The souls of demons shall be butchered; wind and fire shall not cease.
A thousand thousand heads severed, ten thousand ten thousand forms destroyed.
No demon shall trespass, no ghost shall manifest as a specter.
The Three Officials and Northern Fengdu shall inspect the ghostly encampments,
permitting no concealment—swift as the golden horse’s course.
Universally proclaimed without end, let all spirits heed.
The Five Emperors of the Three Realms, declare this to the Highest Clarity.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Dawn Dao Lord commands by the Celestial Emperor’s decree!*

**General Incantation for Summoning Myriad Spirits**
Resplendent and numinous, *qi* transforms into true spirits.
The August Emperor of the Void unites the *qi*, universally descending to the celestial court.
The spirits respond to the *qi*, the *qi* merges with true essence.
Hasten to answer my summons, hasten to heed my voice.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Clarity Celestial Emperor decrees!*

**Prayer Incantation**
Within the golden gates and jade chambers, the Great Brahma of the vaulted heavens,
hearing this proclamation, swiftly come in resonance.
Drums and banners descend from the Milky Way,
riding the wind, driving the *qi*, arriving from the floating void.
The cinnabar palace of the mud-pill, the jade chamber and golden hall,
the Three Departments and Eight Luminaries, the hundred spirits of the four limbs—
arise in grandeur, arrive in solemn procession.
In solemn union, they array themselves upon the altar,
receiving the Jade Clarity’s command, responding with auspicious radiance.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Celestial Emperor decrees!*

This method follows the Three Heavens and Ten Heavens’ esoteric techniques, employing breath and exhalation.
When summoning the Radiant Host, inscribe the Three Heavens’ true forms with your gaze toward the Celestial Gate,
inhale into the Three Palaces, and transform them into the Three Clarities.
Visualize yourself assuming the form of the Divine Lord—
wearing the Jade Clarity’s Great Receiving Cap of gold and kingfisher feathers,
a robe of crimson radiance with flying sleeves, a grand sash, vermilion shoes, and a crimson skirt,
seated amidst clouds of three hues.
In your right hand, cast the Seven Stars of the Dipper to form the Purple Tenuity Seal;
in your left, cast the Three Fires to hold the Jade Clarity mudra.
Knock your teeth nine times, recite the incantation, then knock them twenty-seven times.
Proceed to summon according to the matter at hand.
For all divine mudras, follow the matter at hand, matching the *qi* with breaths and gestures—
grasp firmly, never superficially, and let no person or beast witness.
Employ the *qi* of the northwest, and the summoned shall arrive at once.
Upon completion, swiftly bid them return to their domains.

**Incantation for Summoning the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs**
Hongxing, Mohei, Mozhen, Walà, Lingbao.

For this method, hold the Jade Clarity mudra in your left hand while inscribing the Jade Clarity’s true form in the air with your right.
Recite the incantation, inhale the *qi* of the five directions, and hold your breath.
With your left hand, enclose the true form, then exhale with an open mouth.
Recite the incantation again, raise the Five Peaks mudra, and draw the *qi* of the five directions to blow upon it.
This is the general esoteric technique for entering the altar and summoning the Perfected.
All other methods derive from this—only when the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens appear may you summon the remaining Perfected.

Should one deviate even slightly from this incantation, the summons will go unanswered.

**Esoteric Incantation for Summoning the Celestial Clerks**
"Supreme Mysterious Origin, Most High Dao Lord, summon forth from within this servant’s body the Three and Five Celestial Clerks, the Attendant Officials of Left and Right, the Courier Dragon Riders, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting and Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Incense-Officials of the Day—thirty-two of each—let them emerge.
Let those who emerge be clad in solemn attire, their robes and sashes adorned with hanging tassels, their dignity and bearing impeccable. Let them stand in attendance before, behind, and to the left and right of this servant, heeding this servant’s instructions, conveying and fulfilling this sincere command, ascending to serve the Three Heavens.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Most Honored Decree of the Primordial Celestial Thearch commands."

Recite this incantation in a soft voice, so that outsiders may not understand. If not during the extended fasts of the first, seventh, or tenth months, simply state: "On this auspicious and fasted day, this servant, [insert name], humbly petitions for [state purpose]," speaking directly as the matter requires. If making a petition on the same day, conclude with: "Supreme Mysterious Origin, halt." Swiftly, swiftly, as the Most Honored Decree of the Primordial Celestial Thearch commands.

For this method, form the Upper Clarity mudra with both hands, visualize the true form of Jade Clarity in your gaze, inhale through the mouth, recite the incantation, draw the *qi* of the Qian direction, and swallow it. Envision it residing in the Upper Cinnabar Field, the Central Crimson Palace, and the Lower Gate of Life. Mounting the *qi* of the Three Pristine Ones, emerge and stand facing the west, then proceed with the matter at hand as required.

**General Invocation for Summoning the Celestial Clerks**
"In the heavens above, Jade Clarity presides.
Within the Great Vault of the Mysterious, the Palace of the Great Mystery is born.
Therein dwell the Imperial Lords and the Jade Mother of Numinous Emptiness.
They govern the chanting and recitation, the jade texts and golden talismans.
They oversee the celestial prohibitions, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens.
They examine and discern demons, governing the hundred clerks.
They ascend to the Three Heavens, forming the Bureau of Manifestations.
They transmit and proclaim decrees, rescuing from illness and suffering.
They guard and protect the Dao, binding and restraining demonic insults.
They traverse the myriad heavens, delivering the living and transcending the dead.
They resolve calamities and shatter monstrosities, communicating with the Purple Palace.
By the command of the Ten Heavens, summon those who preside.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees of the Primordial Celestial Thearch command."

The method on the right inscribes the True Forms of the Three Heavens. At the direction of the Heavenly Gate, visualize them in three colors. First, form the Jade Clarity mudra with the left hand and the Highest Clarity mudra with the right, strike the teeth nine times, and with eyes closed, trace the talismans while reciting the Three Heavens’ secret names: *Hong, Liu, Jing*. Heaven, Earth, Humanity—within these, the virtue of defense is established. Draw in the breath through the mouth, guiding it into the Three Palaces, and visualize the body assuming the form of the Divine Lord. Silently recite the incantation once, then draw in the qi of the ten directions and blow it toward the east, south, west, and north. When complete, summon and invoke the celestial bureaus of the myriad heavens, the mysterious offices of the spirit administrators, using the Great Incantation of the General Petition—no other text is required. Do not recklessly recite it, lest you confuse the celestial bureaus.

**Incantation to Summon the Celestial Officials**
In the highest heavens, Jade Clarity is the origin. The Three Qi of Numinous Treasure govern the three provinces’ pivotal offices. The Celestial Thearch presides over them, the celestial bureaus’ life-palace. Each has its appointed duty, assisting the Jade Statutes below. Ranked by grade and arranged by position, each office has its place. At the first summons, descend; at the first command, obey the Heavenly Seal. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.

**Incantation to Summon the Divine Lads**
With reverence, I invoke the twelve divine lads beneath the Jade Clarity of Numinous Treasure, known as the Jade Radiance. By imperial decree, hasten to descend. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.

**Incantation to Summon the Jade Maidens**
With reverence, I invoke the yin of supple origins, the Nine Numinous and Nine Perfected, called the Jade Maidens, clad in phoenix robes and light skirts. By the command of the True King, hasten to the altar court. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.

**Incantation to Summon the Merit Officers**
The mysterious bureaus’ jade texts appoint the merit officers. They uphold Jade Clarity and memorialize the Three Heavens. Hearing my summons, hasten to the altar court. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.

**Incantation to Summon the Thunder Gods**
Southern Controller of the Fire Palace, Lord Han of the Upper Palace. Dragon-circled Rain Division, thunder’s divine court. Masters of the five directions’ lightning, the thunderclap’s Ding spirits. Receiving the command of the direct talisman, summoned by the Mysterious Numinous. By the Celestial Venerable’s decree, wind and fire cease not. Swiftly ride the ten directions, bringing the Dharma rain and compassionate clouds. Swift thunder searches out dragons, fierce lightning and fire bells. Sweep away inauspiciousness, shatter demonic hordes. The celestial prisons seize the monstrous; swiftly descend, true spirits. Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes and decrees command.

**True Form of the Three Heavens’ Celestial Thearch Heart Seal**
The master says: Numinous Treasure possesses the True Forms of the Three Heavens’ Celestial Thearchs. For all adepts who receive and uphold the great method, at dawn each day, take four pieces of bamboo membrane, inscribe them according to their respective colors, and swallow them. Thereafter, govern the unseen and manifest realms—none shall fail to respond. After three years of this practice, one may seal and command mountains and rivers, summon and bind true spirits, and govern the Six Heavens, calling to account the palaces of the yin. After seven years, one may sit and manifest the traveling kitchen; a thousand true spirits and ten thousand numinous beings shall attend and guard the body. After nine years, when merit is complete, one shall ascend in flight to Highest Clarity.

**True Form of the Qingwei Heaven**
Inscribe in blue-green.

**True Form of the Yu-Yu Heaven**
Inscribe in yellow.

**True Form of the Great Red Heaven**
Inscribe in white.

**True Form of the Five Numinous Dark Elder, Northern Thearch**
Inscribe in black.

**True Talismans of the Three Heavens and Three Realms**
The Master said: Within the *Lingbao Scripture of Salvation for the Limitless*, there resides the supreme Dao. By refining the body internally and absorbing the correct *qi* externally, one’s name is inscribed in Jade Clarity, and one is ranked among the Perfected. One may dispel demonic trials, revive the dead, and restore the skeleton—such merit and virtue penetrate between Heaven and Earth.

This Dao is most sacred, most wondrous, most numinous, and most revered. It takes the Terrace of Supreme Mystery as its administrative center, the Bureau of Celestial Mechanisms as its inner sanctuary, and the Upper Court of the Celestial Pivot as the master of its teachings. The Perfected Lord of Wondrous Salvation and Divine Merit serves as the first scriptural master of the Celestial Pivot Court.

In former times, the Thearch bestowed these true talismans of the Three Realms to govern the essentials of the Celestial Pivot. They enable the Dao to command the Northern Palace, oversee the Yellow Court, pacify the spirits, nurture the true, dispel calamities, and still misfortunes—assisting the gateway of salvation and honoring the primordial virtue of the scriptural masters. Today, within the Southern Upper Fire Palace of the Celestial Pivot Court, these talismans are stored.

The Three Realms’ Talismans originated at the dawn of the Five Kalpas of the Supreme Three Heavens, when the true essence of the Three *Qi* and the numinous emptiness of wondrous *qi* coalesced into true script, the natural sounds of all heavens, and the root and origin of the Great Dao. They may be used to summon and command spirits, or swallowed to attain perfection, responding to all affairs with resonance.

Originally, these were not transmitted to the lower world, but passed down through oral instruction and heart-to-heart transmission by the Perfected. Those who receive this script are born with the bones of the Dao. Diligently practicing it, one shall attain divine transcendence. If one observes prolonged abstinence in mountain forests or pure halls, recites and practices the true teachings of the Eight Latitudes, cultivates the wondrous applications of the Seven Scriptures, and swallows the true talismans, then after eighty-one days, the Three Corpses shall perish of themselves, grain *qi* shall naturally arise, the body shall become light and strong, the face shall radiate jade-like luminosity, and the form shall gleam with golden luster—unlike the *qi* of medicinal stones or saliva, for this is the true *qi* of nature. One shall attain longevity and transcend the world, forever free from decline and decay. With prolonged ingestion, one shall surely ascend as an immortal.

When inscribing, recite the Three Realms’ incantations, and with the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, write in cinnabar on bamboo membrane and swallow it. This can also cure a thousand calamities: for minor matters, use only the Supreme Clarity talisman; for major affairs, employ all three talismans together.

Alternatively, inscribe the talisman in cinnabar on an iron plate, nine inches long and five inches wide, and submerge it in clear spring water. Let the afflicted drink the water, and the effect shall be immediate. Or, write nine cinnabar lines on green bamboo leaves and place them by flowing water; drinking this can cure epidemics—its efficacy is beyond description.

*Received by Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns, Leader of the Numinous Treasure Tradition*

**Gate of Establishing Merit and Founding Virtue**
The Master said: For establishing merit and founding virtue, each has its corresponding fast. If Heaven and Earth are obstructed and nearing their end, perform the *Lingbao Golden Register Fast*. If the stars and constellations are in disarray, the sun and moon eclipsed or dimmed, perform the *Celestial Thearch Nine Luminaries Fast*. If the four seasons lose their order and yin-yang fall out of harmony, perform the *Five Thearchs Nurturing Creatures Fast*. If warfare arises on all sides, perform the *Great One Sagely Perfected Fast*. If pestilence spreads, perform the *Longevity and Life-Preservation Fast*. For praying for rain or clearing skies, perform the *Five Spirits Fast of Deep Abysses and Caverns*. If a teacher or friend has passed away, perform the *Yellow Register Fast of Compassion*.

**Nine Kinds of Yin Merit**
The Scripture says: *Stars and constellations in disarray*—this refers to the Five Planets encroaching, the Nine Luminaries deviating from their paths, ominous comets appearing in the wilds, conjunctions occurring out of sequence, and the constant order being disrupted. *Sun and moon losing their brightness*—this refers to the sun appearing green and dim, the sun’s course going astray, or phenomena such as eclipses, halos, and coronas. *Four seasons losing their order*—this refers to spring exhibiting autumnal signs, summer frosts, or winter thunder.

**Yin-Yang Imbalance**
This refers to untimely rain or drought, or irregularities in the seasonal *qi* and climate.

**Calamity Befalling the Sovereign**
This refers to rebellious ministers and treacherous subjects usurping power, coercing the royal mandate, or disrupting governance through discord and misrule.

**Warfare Raging on All Fronts**
This refers to the eight directions remaining unenlightened, border tribes invading, traitorous generals and rebellious ministers launching unjust campaigns, or armies trampling the land, causing men and women to grieve and mutually oppress one another.

**Pestilence and Poison Spreading**
This refers to seasonal epidemics ravaging cities and towns, unpropitiated ghosts riding the *qi* to bring harm, or demonic influences—such as wild specters, malevolent spirits, vicious beasts, and venomous creatures—causing chaos and injury.

**Mass Death and Injury Among the People**
This refers to cold winds and malevolent *qi* assailing the populace, landslides and sinkholes, fire and water clashing, or disasters from rivers, seas, mountains, and streams—such as harmful creatures, misfortunes, ghostly consumption, corpse-transmitted illnesses, *gu* poison, plagues, and virulent toxins—leading to officials and commoners dying prematurely or perishing violently.

**Passing of Teachers and Friends**
Those who share the same studies are disciples; anyone possessing even a single virtue worthy of emulation may be called a teacher. Those who study together in the same court are friends. For all who transmit the Dao, inherit the teachings, share the same aspirations, and belong to the same school—whose bonds are as close as kin and whose affections transcend life and death—after their passing, one should exhaust all efforts in posthumous cultivation, adapting to the circumstances as appropriate.

These are the fundamental purposes of performing fasts, burning incense, and reciting scriptures, collectively known as the **Nine Kinds of Yin Merit**. For major matters, one should establish a *Lingbao* Mystic Altar; for minor matters, a Three Dawns Minor Altar. When a teacher or friend has passed, the scale of recitation and construction should be measured accordingly, following the *Yellow Register* protocols. For all other cases, altars are erected in accordance with this method: nine tripods are arranged, the symbols of the Three Dawns are buried, and the ritual is conducted with meticulous care. The severity of calamities is assessed, the altar and its attendants are purified, and fine musical instruments are prepared. The five types of disasters are recorded in detail, and the petition is presented to the lofty perfected beings of the respective domain. When sincerity aligns with Heaven, the Five Merits are accomplished, and ascension is attained—this is the essence of Yin Merit. Secrecy is paramount; if the details are divulged, the merit will not be recorded.

---

**Altar Construction Method**
The Scripture states: Choose a site where *qi* is vibrant, free from filth, debris, or impurities, and select land untouched by death, warfare, execution grounds, or slaughterhouses. Construct a three-tiered altar.

For a Three Dawns Altar, each tier should be one *chi* in height. The top tier is two *chi* wide, the middle tier three *chi*, and the base tier six *chi*. Each tier is arranged according to the matter at hand, with the respective sacred positions of the deities. The top tier is secured with talismans.

On the top tier, bury the images of the Three Dawns at a depth of nine *cun*: the sun to the right, the moon to the left, and the Five Planets in their respective directions. On the middle tier, arrange the nine tripods according to the eight directions, with one central tripod placed in the *kun* position.

**Tripod Construction Method**
In ancient times, tripods were cast from gold, silver, bronze, or iron. Alternatively, new and clean earthenware vessels may be fired in the shape of tripods, each fitted with a lid. The exterior of each vessel is inscribed in vermilion with the name of the respective tripod. Inside, the names of the Nine Provinces are written in *qi*, distributed according to their directions. First, inscribe the numbers of the *Hetu* in vermilion, then place the tripod atop the inscription, with its name facing outward. Ensure it is level and stable, without tilting.

In advance, memorialize the Supreme Emperor and submit a petition to the altar, invoking the associated perfected spirits. Dispatch a document to the local earth gods to guard and protect the altar’s sanctity.

During the ritual, draw pure spring water from the nine directions and fill the nine tripods. The ritual master orally presents the matter at hand, then covers the tripods with their lids. A separate pure mat is set up, furnished with fine music, ritual implements, seasonal flowers, fresh fruits, incense, and lamps, all arranged according to protocol.

Next, assemble virtuous practitioners of pure cultivation, regardless of number, to jointly perform the fast. Purify the altar, banish impurities, and proceed with utmost sincerity, adhering strictly to ancient rites. Burn incense during the six periods of the day and recite the scriptures ten times, ensuring that one’s sincere heart ascends to Heaven while the celestial essence descends. This is not the same as ordinary worldly recitations.

If the participants are not virtuous—if their minds wander to worldly concerns while their mouths recite sacred texts—even if they accumulate vast quantities, it will be of no benefit. Once the merit is accomplished and virtue perfected, the lids of the nine tripods are lifted for inspection. If the water remains as clear as before, it is the natural course of things. If there is slight turbidity or other unusual signs, it indicates calamities or anomalies, all of which are omens. By analyzing these according to the prescribed method, one may discern the disasters afflicting the corresponding regions. If the calamity cannot be fully resolved, additional rites for disaster mitigation must be performed.

**Nine Palaces’ Disaster-Averting Rites for the Eight Solar Terms**

The Master says: The **Southern Supreme Palace**, governed by **Han the Controller**, holds the **Nine Palaces’ Celestial Stars**, which descend to the Nine Lands, executing Heaven’s mandate to oversee calamities and anomalies. Each solar term governs disasters and *qi*; each year governs its division; every five days, they inspect and regulate; each day, they issue transformative decrees.

- **Kan Palace (Northern Depths’ Spirit)**: The **Mystic Abyss’s** deity, the **Great Unity Star**. Governs warfare, river floods, grain scarcity, and armed conflict.
- **Li Palace (Southern Flame’s Spirit)**: The **Cinnabar Blaze’s** deity, the **Celestial Unity Star**. Governs fire, drought, withered grass, scorching yang excess, parched grain, and famine.
- **Central Palace (Profound Transformation’s Spirit)**: The **Celestial Treasury Star**. Governs harmful earth *qi*, land fissures, earthquakes, epidemics, and the people’s toil.
- **Qian Palace (Flying Clouds’ Spirit)**: The **Azure Dragon Star**. Governs frost, cold, floods, and minor warfare.
- **Gen Palace (Accumulated Yin’s Spirit)**: The **Great Yin Star**. Governs prolonged yin, fog, haze, and the dimming of sun and moon.
- **Zhen Palace (Yellow Dragon’s Spirit)**: The **Xuanyuan Star**. Governs violent thunder, fierce winds, bitter rains, encampment inundations, widespread illness, and heavy frost.
- **Xun Palace (Ethereal Mist’s Spirit)**: The **Beckoning Star**. Governs sudden hailstorms, damaging winds, and locust plagues.
- **Kun Palace (Primal Earth’s Spirit)**: The **Shepherd Star**. Governs excessive earthworks, sudden cold, frost, freezing fog, and the destruction of flora.
- **Dui Palace (Golden Radiance’s Spirit)**: The **Xianchi Star**. Governs frost, the ruin of the Five Grains, and the rise of bandits and rebels.

The above Nine Stars, obeying the Southern Supreme’s command, each govern a solar term’s disasters, issuing decrees of misfortune. Patrolling the Nine Provinces, they often clash with restraining palaces, disrupting the four seasons’ balance and causing yin-yang disharmony.

Moreover, the **Three Clarities’ Long Officers** and the **Great Unity Divine Lord** specifically oversee warfare, drought, stagnation, and epidemic toxins. Furthermore, the **Purple Tenuity’s Supreme Palace’s Heavenly Emperor’s Mystic Bureau’s Azure Net Perfected**, who governs karmic destinies, the progression of the Seven Governors, and the reckoning of lower kalpas’ national and popular calamities, as well as solar and lunar eclipses, the Five Stars’ anomalies, orbital deviations, premature deaths, earthquakes, ominous comets, baleful stars, and strange *qi*, also presides over the Nine Lands’ fortunes and misfortunes.

**Disaster-Averting Method**: Follow the Nine Palaces’ governance and the Eight Solar Terms’ directional application.

Begin on the **Winter Solstice**, facing east, and recite the scripture ten times to dispel the Nine Lands’ disasters from the Winter Solstice to the **Start of Spring** (a span of forty-five days). Then, starting from **Kan’s First Palace**, face north and recite while circling to **Li’s Ninth Palace**, completing nine recitations. Turn once more to the east, completing ten recitations to dissolve the disasters of **Kan Palace’s** northern direction. Thus, one solar term entails twenty scripture recitations.

For the **Start of Spring**, face east and recite ten times to dispel the Nine Lands’ disasters from the Start of Spring to the **Spring Equinox** (forty-five days). Then, beginning at **Gen’s Eighth Palace**, face northeast and recite while circling to **Dui’s Seventh Palace**, completing nine recitations. Turn once more to the east, completing ten recitations to dissolve **Gen Palace’s** northeastern disasters. The remaining terms follow this pattern, adhering to the Nine Palaces’ sequence.

Upon completing the recitations, visualize the **Jade Maidens and Jade Lads** attending the scripture, enacting its intent. For each province, contemplate the **Primordial Beginning’s** tenfold, dual-cycle elucidation of the scripture in detail, ensuring all from the **First Azure** onward attain deliverance. Each thought and contemplation must be earnest.

**Eight Solar Terms’ Nine Palaces Diagram**
**Altar Rite for Dissolving and Dispelling Disasters**

The Master said: All the fortunes and misfortunes of the Nine Lands are predetermined by the Supreme Emperor during the Grand Assembly of the Lower Prime in the tenth month each year. By the time of the Winter Solstice in the eleventh month, when the first yang qi responds, fortunes and misfortunes rise and recede with the qi, accumulating in accordance with their destined measures. If not immediately manifest, they will emerge after the first day of the first month, also reported in accordance with their destined measures. Those not fated to encounter them must await the exhaustion of those whose measures are fulfilled before fortunes and misfortunes arise. Yet the world below remains benighted, unaware of escape. Since we uphold the Cavernous Mystery’s immortal precepts, we do not wait until calamity strikes to dissolve it. Instead, after the Lower Prime, we perform meritorious deeds to save the world, assist the state, and pacify the people. Select nine fellow practitioners of the highest attainment. At a purified site, construct the **Altar of the Three Heavens’ Aggregate Qi**, with three tiers. The upper tier models Heaven, the middle tier embodies humanity, and the lower tier represents Earth. Build it according to the prescribed system.

The upper tier is circular, nine *chi* in diameter and three *chi* in height. The middle tier is octagonal, with each side measuring one *zhang*, two *chi*, and four *cun* in length and breadth, and two *chi* and four *cun* in height. The lower tier is square, fifteen *chi* and five *cun* on each side, and three *chi* and six *cun* in height. Alternatively, the upper tier may be circular, five *chi* in diameter and nine *cun* in height; the middle tier octagonal, seven *chi* and two *cun* in length and breadth; and the lower tier square, nine *chi* on each side and one *chi* in height.

On the upper tier, fashion a golden image of the sun, nine *fen* in diameter, and a jade image of the moon, ten *fen* in diameter. From the five stones and quartz, craft the Five Stars, each the size of a pellet. Bury the sun’s image at the *mao* position and the moon’s image at the *you* position, both adjacent to the altar’s edge. Bury the Five Stars—east, south, west, north, and center—within the upper tier, three *cun* apart from the sun and moon, each one *cun* deep. Then erect a soaring pillar at the altar’s center, three *chi* and two *cun* tall. At every eight *cun*, affix a celestial disk, forming three layers. The lowest layer supports a Dipper-shaped stand, resembling a right-angled lamp frame.

The upper tier is coated with pale azure-colored clay. With cinnabar, inscribe the forms of the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ *gang* along its perimeter. The middle tier is coated with yellow clay, and around its edge, inscribe the **Five Meritorious Talismans of the Numinous Treasure**, marking only the four cardinal and four intermediate directions. Next, inscribe the **Great Brahma’s Hidden Language of Radiant Jade Characters**, evenly distributed across the four directions. Below, write the names of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors. Then, arrange nine precious tripods—or substitute with earthenware or stone vessels—at the eight directions, with the central vessel placed at the *kun* position.

Draw water from a deep, ever-flowing spring and fill the nine tripods. Before adding the water, the nine officiants face the nine directions, holding brushes. They visualize the myriad beings, mountains, rivers, and cities across ten thousand *li*, drawing qi into their brushes and contemplating the qi of the nine directions. For example, at the *li* palace, one draws nine breaths of qi. After charging the brush with qi, they inscribe the names of the Nine Wilds in black ink within the tripods. Boil the nine-directional waters, pour them into the vessels until level, and cover them. Place lamps beside them and incense burners before them. Behind the tripods, erect tablets inscribed with the positions of the **Nine Qi Elders**.

The lower tier is coated with fresh white clay. Open eight gates around its perimeter, along with the **Heavenly Gate** and **Earthly Portal**. Paint the Eight Trigrams, the Four Seas and Five Peaks—with the Central Peak facing the *kun* direction—and the Nine Provinces’ astrological divisions, arranging them according to the diagram. Once complete, arrange the sacred ranks across the three tiers and three wheels, ensuring all conform to ritual propriety.

When the appointed time arrives, enter the altar at the *zi* and *wu* hours. Spread tables, mats, and cushions at the eight directions. Eight like-minded practitioners each oversee one direction, while the High Merit Officer takes a separate elevated seat above the **Earthly Portal**, facing the **Heavenly Gate** to preside over the Nine Palaces. Once this is established, proceed with the six daily incense offerings. Each practitioner recites the **Great Scripture of the Numinous Writ** once, then all chant it together, completing ten full recitations. Each must inwardly contemplate the scripture’s methods, applying intent to their actions. This continues for a full day and night, completing the six periods.

At the *hai* hour, enter the altar and open the vessels. There, the fortunes and misfortunes of the Nine Lands will be revealed. Repeat the ritual as before. At the next *hai* hour, inspect the vessels again. If the water and inscriptions appear unchanged, conclude the altar rites, hold a thanksgiving offering, and perform rituals to eliminate disasters, deliver from calamities, and dispel misfortunes—all following this method. This is the **Great Crimson Golden Code**; do not alter it arbitrarily with personal whims, lest your efforts prove futile.

**Three Heavens Qi-Converging Altar**
**Ritual for Dispelling and Deliverance from Water and Drought Calamities**

The Master says: When heavenly qi descends and earthly qi does not ascend, then scorching fire reaches its extreme, and the drought demon brings disaster by blocking the yang. When earthly qi ascends, then excessive yin water overflows, and flooding causes harm. For yin virtue, one need not await entreaty; for yang merit, there is earnest governance. Erecting a *gui* altar invokes the rains; establishing a *bing* altar halts the downpours. Petitioning the Sun Valley and memorializing the Fire Emperor, holding the Dragon Officials accountable and praying to the Three Officials—when the allotted limit is reached, one pays homage at the Jade Palace; when talismans descend, one summons thunder with an official dispatch. The Ding and Jia spirits render service; the Supreme One lends aid. The Dipper’s splendor crushes demons; governance dispatches and rectifies. The Four Maidens are assigned to their posts, harmonizing and gathering the obscured. When merit is accomplished, a hundred million receive blessings; when virtue precedes, the myriad things flourish. Reporting merit and acknowledging transgressions, the officials advance in rank, each listed in the registers of the Heavenly Immortals, their virtue surpassing that of the divine lords.

Those who act negligently without merit shall be punished with reduced lifespan and demoted rank. All must adhere to these precepts and not be remiss.

The formula states: For rain, heavenly qi descends and earthly qi ascends; when yin and yang harmonize, rain falls. For drought, heavenly qi descends, but yang qi operates alone, and earthly qi does not ascend; when yin and yang fail to harmonize, scorching yang blazes fiercely, and fire drought brings disaster. Moreover, if local rulers are cruel and tyrannical, harboring resentment and corrupting rectitude, this often causes such calamities. If earthly qi surges upward, yin qi invades yang, and heavenly qi does not descend, then excessive yin rains pour ceaselessly, and flooding causes harm. Furthermore, if those who govern the people plot in darkness, administer punishments and virtues unjustly, and secretly harm the loyal and good, they invite this disaster.

Since you, the officiant, hold the office of Perfected One, you must personally perform yin merit, secretly making intercessions for the people. If you receive petitions seeking aid, this is called yang virtue. For praying for rain, establish a *gui*-character altar. For dispelling clear skies, erect a *bing*-*ding* altar. Great merit takes three days, middling merit seven days, and lesser merit nine days; the response determines the allotted time. First, establish the altar, observe purification, and recite the *True Scripture of the Cavern Abyss Dragon Text*. Notify the Earth Deities to command the rain-bringing dragons, the Sun Valley Spirit Kings, and the Water Officials in charge of life. Next, memorialize the Great Emperor of the Supporting Canopy, submit to the Heavenly Bureaus, then have the spirits pay homage at the Golden Palace. Present a memorial to request the mandate, entrusting the Supreme One Primordial Lady, the Six Ding and Six Jia, the Samādhi Fire Casket to restrain water demons, and the Han Controller of Thunder to eliminate harmful influences. Crimson-feathered fans dispel clouds, and black talismans summon rain. Call forth dragons to move thunder, recite incantations to spread blessings, and have the Lake and Sea Spirit Maidens part the obscurity and divide the light. The Great Harmony Sea Consorts harmonize above and below; swift thunder and preceding winds issue commands, ensuring either clear skies or rain. If thunder rumbles before rain, the air remains stifling and unharmonized, and the downpour is yet to come.

When merit is accomplished, it is not by one’s own virtue; sincerity resonates with Heaven and Earth. The Supreme Mystery does not bend to things; one must align virtue with the talismans.

It is also said: When miscellaneous categories are trivial and the cold and heat lose their proper seasons, Heaven and Earth contain and sustain, yet locusts multiply, devouring the hundred grains. Epidemics and pestilences spread, harming the common people. Summer frosts, winter thunder, autumnal blossoms, spring’s failure to nurture, rainbows piercing the sky, great hail and bitter rains, fierce winds and swift thunder damage the multitude of beings. Waters spawn dragons and mirages; lands roam tigers and rhinoceroses. Long vipers and swarming rats, monstrous demons and malevolent curses—petition the Fire Bureau to rescue the realm, and invoke the Five Emperors to nurture the beings. In the western autumn, govern poisonous insects, bind locusts, and restrain snakes and tigers. The following day, eliminate pestilence and preserve life; the Heavenly Officials govern plagues and save from suffering. Jade texts suppress long dragons; golden writings dissolve malevolent curses. Though not of the highest rank, they assist divine merit; borrowing the middle chapters enhances their power. Responding to supplications, one ascends through inspiration and obtains grace, bringing fortune to the primordial ancestors.

It is also said: The Primordial Ancestral Dao divided and descended into kinds. From the qi of the Three Primes, it transformed the five phases’ upright qi of the Highest Perfected, the hundred spirits’ fierce and ardent qi, the Six Ding’s gentle and harmonious qi, and the Six Jia’s balanced and harmonious qi.

The qi of the common people and the utmost yin gives rise to the qi of ghostly essences and miscellaneous kinds, and to the qi of birds, beasts, and minor creatures—such are the kinds that produce insects. In the measures of the four seasons, the Five Emperors nurture all things. For instance, in spring, the Azure Emperor governs with harmonious qi. By the fourth month, the Vermilion Emperor takes command, transforming harmony into warmth. If the Azure Emperor fails to withdraw the spring mandate, then mild cold and weak qi prevail, and the five grains and hundred fruits fail to ripen, while misty qi breeds pestilence. Or if the Vermilion Emperor encroaches upon the mandate, then swift thunder and fierce winds arise, water spirits bring disaster, harming the myriad things, and the people suffer from heat, pestilence, paralysis, scabies, dysentery, and toxins.

In summer, the Vermilion Emperor governs with the fire mandate, bringing all things to maturity. By the seventh month, the White Emperor takes command, transforming warmth into cold. If the Vermilion Emperor fails to withdraw the summer mandate, then scorching yang dries up the waters, rainbows, hail, and thunderstorms bring bitter rain and violent winds, harming grasses and trees, while venomous snakes and evil creatures emerge from the mountains and wilds. If the White Emperor encroaches upon the mandate, then summer brings frost and sleet, grasses and trees wither and die, the hundred grains fail to ripen, and the people suffer from coughs.

In autumn, the White Emperor governs with the killing mandate, ripening all things. By the tenth month, the Black Emperor takes command, transforming coolness into cold. If the White Emperor fails to withdraw the autumn mandate, then autumnal qi causes flowers to bloom, tigers and leopards bring disaster, rats devour the five grains, and the people suffer from sores and pain. Or if the Black Emperor encroaches upon the mandate, then mountains and rivers overflow, the seas split, and the earth quakes; the hundred grains fail to grow, birds and beasts die of themselves, the land lies barren, and famine and disease arise together.

In winter, the Black Emperor governs with the cold mandate. By the first month, the Azure Emperor takes command, transforming cold into harmony. If the Black Emperor fails to withdraw the winter mandate and the Azure Emperor fails to take command, then rain worms split trees, the old and young perish suddenly, and the people suffer from great pestilence in spring. Or if the Azure Emperor encroaches upon the mandate, then a hundred flowers bloom prematurely, bearing blossoms but no fruit, waters bring forth dragons and mirages, and the people suffer sudden death.

Moreover, the four seasons and four qi are assisted by the virtue of earth. If their measures are lost, then yin and yang fall out of balance, and the hundred disasters and myriad harms arise accordingly. All these are under the jurisdiction of the Southern Prosperity Upper Office and the Han Bureau of the Fire Prefecture, governed by the Venerable Lord Han, styled "The Permissible Han." He is subject to the Five Emperors in nurturing all things, ensuring the proper alignment of celestial lodges, regulating the Great Dipper, and harmonizing the seven luminaries.

For any such disasters, one must petition the Venerable Lord and swear alliance with the Five Emperors. Locusts, tigers, and rhinoceroses are governed by the Lord of the Western Marchmount. Pestilence falls under the jurisdiction of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Mystery Prefecture, the Great Clarity Jade Bureau, the Longevity and Life-Preservation Prefecture, and the Great One Primordial Life Prefecture, administered by the Offices of the Following Heaven. Jade texts and golden talismans issue from the Jade Bureau, presided over by the Jade Emperor’s Bureau. All these must be supplemented by reciting the Middle Chapters ten thousand times and the Supreme Scripture for the Salvation of Humanity ten times. Thus may dire calamities be healed throughout the four quarters and demonic afflictions be eradicated in the eight directions. Accumulating such mysterious merit brings blessing not only to oneself but also to the nine generations of ancestors.

It is also said: The long-officiating lords of the Three Clarities and the gods of the Great One command the armies of the regions and states, specializing in quelling rebellions, floods, and fires. Moreover, the gods of the Heavenly One possess nine qi and extraordinary generals, who govern the nine wilds, known as the Noble Ones. They also oversee warfare, drought, stagnation, thunder, wind, yin pestilence, and the regions they reach, where rebellious ministers and traitorous sons give rise to arms. The Sage of Eastern Florescence, an emanation of the Primordial Beginning, may govern these. The thirty-two celestial jade scripts of the true writ may suppress them. The Ten Virtues may exorcise them, and the Nine Rites may atone for them, bringing about great peace.

It is further said: When the military movements of the Great One and the shifts of the nine gods arise, warfare erupts, officials and commoners flee in disarray, corpses fill the mountains and wilds, the strong oppress the weak, blood flows through the suburbs and cities, the dead lie exposed, men wail and women weep—how may such disasters be resolved? One must invoke the Primordial Beginning’s emanation, the Eastern Ultimate Great One, the Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering, and spread the thirty-two celestial jade scripts of the true writ in the high mountains, deep valleys, and great rivers. Then, prepare the Nine Rites to exorcise and resolve the calamity. Next, practice the Ten Virtues, repent, and renew oneself. Thus shall weapons be laid down, great peace swiftly appear, and lasting security be preserved.

The Nine Rites:
- Armored horses, bows and arrows
- A white horse
- A sacrificial ox with bloodletting
- A pyre of firewood
- Clear spring water and fresh fruit
- Exotic flowers and renowned incense
- The five grains
- The five metals
- The five silks (including brocade and embroidery)

The Ten Virtues:
- Pardon those sentenced to death
- Pardon orphans and remnants
- Discipline body and mind
- Practice moderation and self-respect in rites
- Forsake extravagance and frugal eating
- Renew all governance
- Reduce superfluous offices
- Banish feminine allure from the household
- Reward the unrecognized
- Surely replace harm with clarity

**Ritual for Exorcising Drought and Praying for Rain (Altar Method)**

The master says: First, select a pure site and construct a *gui*-character altar in the usual manner, without regard to size. Remove the northwest and northeast corners of the upper tier, add separate vertical paths to the left and right of the middle tier, and remove the southeast and southwest corners of the lower tier. In urgent cases, black mud may be used to mark a *gui*-character shape on the ground. Arrange the offerings at the northern side of the altar. Ascend the altar at the six hours, reciting the Great Brahma Concealed Words or the Scripture of the Cavernous Abyss, and summon the dragons with incantations and prayers. The ritual lasts nineteen days.

For the first three days:
- On the first day, notify the Earth Spirit and the dragon officials responsible for rain, as well as the King of the Bright Valley and the Water Bureau, the Bureau of Destiny, and the Bureau of Life. The document should be titled "The Great Dharma Bureau of the Numinous Treasure," with the Water Bureau strictly supervised. The notification format includes a petition. If no petition is available, write the causes of the drought instead; the rest follows below. First, dispatch a functionary to deliver it, awaiting a response.
- On the second day, petition the Great Emperor of Fusang, notifying the Three Origins Water Bureau, the Eastern Sea Penglai General Water Inspectorate, and the Taihua Capital Province, dispatching as before. If no response is received, prepare a memorial to the Jade Emperor, submitting a petition to the Three Heavens, beseeching the divine court of the Golden Gates to issue an imperial decree to the Water Bureau.

Next, inscribe an iron tablet with vermilion for the Dragon-Summoning Talisman and with black for the Rain-Inducing Talisman, then cast it into rivers or seas. First, notify the Five Thunder Messengers, the Ding-Jia deities, the Wind Earl, and the Rain Master, and forward the dispatch to the City Gods, the Dragon Gods of the Nine Rivers, the Four Seas, and the lakes and marshes, imposing a deadline for rainfall to ensure sufficiency. If no response comes within three days, proceed to the intermediate ritual, setting a seven-day term with a two-day limit, following the previous procedures. If still no response, proceed to the lesser ritual, setting a nine-day term with a three-day limit, again following the previous procedures. Should nineteen days pass without any divine response, no further supplications are permitted. First, this may be due to celestial decree and punitive drought; second, the practitioner may lack virtue and conduct; third, sincerity may be insufficient. Moreover, the Most High ever benevolently saves all beings, and thus grants no more than three deadlines—surely answering the urgent pleas of the people below. Any violation shall be investigated by the Three Officials, resulting in demotion and penalized merit. If a response is received, perform a thanksgiving offering to express gratitude for heavenly grace and report the efficacy of the office.

**Kui-Water Altar of Luminous Clarity**
**Three Heavens Dragon-Summoning Rain-Inducing Talisman**
**Three Heavens Qi-Harmonizing True Rain-Inducing Talisman**

When casting the talisman, aim it toward a dragon pool or cave. Hold the talisman in the left hand and a sword in the right, take three steps in the Ding-Direction, and recite:
*"By the mandate of the Three Heavens’ talisman, summon the dragon to bring rain.
The Heavenly Ding stand before, the Wind Earl presides over the summoning.
The Jade Path is sealed, yin and yang obstructed.
Let the two qi ascend and descend, flying through the sky to bring rain.
The on-duty Dragon God shall obey the talisman’s command.
Should any dare disobey, the Water Official shall swiftly report.
The Supreme Clarity’s Heavenly Ding shall slay your form.
By the Jade Clarity’s numinous mandate, you must heed and obey."*

After casting the talisman, retreat swiftly, lest thunder and water startle the practitioner.

The iron tablet for the talisman should be one foot and two inches long and four inches wide. Inscribe the Dragon-Summoning Talisman in vermilion on the front and the Rain-Inducing Talisman in black on the back.

**Altar Ritual for Clearing Skies and Halting Rain**
The Master says: At a pure, open site beneath a canopy, construct a Bing-Ding altar in the usual manner. The upper tier remains unchanged; the middle tier is divided into two paths, and the lower tier is marked with a single vertical path. Alternatively, apply red clay to the ground to form a Bing-Ding altar, and use crimson silk to make fans. Inscribe the Clearing Talisman in vermilion on the fans and place them in the eight directions. Petition the Water Officials and the Divine King of Yang Valley, notifying the Dragon Gods who govern rain. On the second day, present a memorial to halt the rain. If no response comes, petition the Celestial Court of the Emperor on High, beseeching the descent of the Primordial Lady of Grand Unity, the Ding-Jia deities, to deploy the Samādhi Fire Casket, gather and restrain the water qi, sever water demons, and restore the balance of yin and yang. Perform incense offerings and recite the Great Brahmanic Hidden Mantra for six periods. Upon success and divine response, perform a thanksgiving offering to express gratitude for heavenly grace.

**Yang Valley Bing-Ding Altar**
**Three Heavens Jade Path-Separating Clearing Talisman**

The Master says: When prolonged rain causes dual-water disasters, erect an oilcloth canopy over the exposed altar. Fashion eight fans from swan or egret feathers, inscribe the Jade Path Talisman in yellow upon them, and place them in the eight directions. Within an hour, the rain will clear, and the Three Heavens will be distinct. Place the talisman and recite:
*"Metal and water engender one another, yet turn to mutual punishment."*

The qi of fire and earth overpower and harm form.
By the command of Han Controller, the Three Luminaries shine brightly.
Yin and yang are divided and governed, communicating with the Purple Court.
The Primordial Beginning of the Great Dao: wù, yǐ, bǐng, dīng.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in statute and decree!

**Petition for Rain: Ritual Format for Invoking Officials**

A registered disciple of the [Master’s] Register, under the governance of Celestial Master [Name] of [Oratory], [Rank] Ordained Ritual Master [Name], prostrates with reverent awe, bows deeply, and respectfully submits this memorial:

In accordance with the scriptural protocols, [I], [Name], have encountered this turning of the cosmic cycle and received the transmission of the Master’s Dao, assisting the state and sustaining destiny. Recently, cold and heat have fallen out of balance, allowing demonic afflictions to flourish. Since the first yang [season], severe drought has persisted without rain, causing the people to neglect farming and crops to wither. For the sake of the common folk, I humbly beseech the parting of clouds and the descent of rain to moisten all things and restore growth.

In strict adherence to the *Lingbao* Great Rites, I present this petition for Your celestial consideration. I respectfully invoke the **Great Unity Straight Talisman**, the Envoys of the Five Thunders, the Jade Maidens of the Six Dīng, the Great Spirits of the Six Jiǎ, the Jade Maiden of the River Center, the Divine King of Yáng Valley, the Jade Maiden of Pénglái, the Jade Maiden of the Lakes, and all those who may descend at this moment. By imperial decree, I command the Divine King of the Yáng Valley Water Bureau at Fúsāng, the Grand Overseer of Waters at Pénglái, the Water Officials of Destiny, the Four Seas and Nine Rivers, the Three Primordial Water Bureaus, this year’s appointed Rain Dragon Spirits, the Lords of Wind and Rain, the Duke of Thunder and Mother of Lightning, and the Earth Controllers of the Nine Lands. May they dispatch their subordinates to the designated territories, lead the local water and rain dragon spirits, swiftly harmonize yin and yang, raise clouds and spread mist, and bestow sweet rains. May the mists and rains be ample and sufficient to relieve the scorched and parched.

Should any perverse qi or malevolent forces obstruct the true qi, I beseech the thunderous might to strike them down, upholding celestial law and preventing interference with the rains. With compassion, O Most High, I distinguish my plea in sorrow.

Through the agency of the Direct Envoys of the Two Offices, the Merit Officers of the Orthodox Unity, the Left and Right Attendant Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Messengers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Just Wind Courier Officers, the Post-Horse Memorial Officers, the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, and all other officials, I, [Name], reverently submit this petition in one sealed document to the [Oratory] of [Name]. I await the divine response.

Memorial for Clearing Skies—Format for Petitioning the Divine Offices.
Petition-Officer of the Dharma Rank, as above, respectfully states.

Your servant respectfully examines the documents: at this juncture of fate, I have been fortunate to receive the transmission of the Dao and assist the state in sustaining the Mandate. Recently, the seasons have fallen out of balance—since summer and autumn, yin qi has spread unchecked, ceaseless in its dominion. Torrential rains have swelled into vast floods, rivers and streams overflowing their banks, the myriad commoners bereft of livelihood, fields and seedlings swept away, the court and the realm plunged into distress.

Your servant, in accordance with the *Lingbao* Great Dharma, respectfully submits this memorial to make known these circumstances, humbly beseeching divine intervention to resolve them.

Your servant now reverently petitions the Jade Maidens of the River Center, the Jade Maidens of the Sea, the Jade Maidens of the Lakes, the Water Officials on duty, and the bureaus of the Three Origins’ Water Offices. To the dragon deities governing the waters of the Jiang, He, Huai, and Du Rivers, the springs, streams, and ravines; to the thunder gods, rain masters, and Wind Earls of the Thunder and Rain Division; and to the dragon deities and rain masters who have dispensed rain this year—may they swiftly gather the clouds and restrain the mists, apportion yin and yang, cease the rains and unveil the light, each returning to their respective domains as a sign of their efficacy.

With profound reverence, I implore the Most High to distinguish and heed this plea.

Your foolish servant, acting through the duty officers of the Two Palaces, the *Zhengyi* Merit Registrars, the Left and Right Palace Envoys, the yin-yang divine messengers, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Officers, the Just Wind Courier Officers, the Memorial-Presenting Steed Officers, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, now respectfully submits this memorial on behalf of [Name] to the [Name] Office.

Awaiting the divine response with utmost deference.

Your servant [Name], with awe and trepidation, bows his head to the ground, prostrates himself, and respectfully submits this memorial for consideration.

*(Three lines left blank)*

As in the second chapter, so too here: invoke the Primordial Lady of the Great Unity, the Six Ding Jade Maidens, the Six Jia Mighty Spirits, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, and the Celestial Strongmen, that they may descend as one, swiftly gather the water-qi, sever and subdue the water demons, unblock the springs, open the jade pathways, and reveal the Three Luminaries as a sign of their efficacy.

**Nine Kinds of Yin Merit for Exorcism and Pacification: Ritual Recitation Formulas**
The Master says: When the celestial cycles are disordered, inscribe the Dragon-Phoenix Qi Script in plain script upon purple silk and place it upon a renowned mountain. Recite this scripture to exorcise the affliction.

When the constellations deviate from their courses and the sun and moon lose their proper times, inscribe the Five Elders’ Red Script and Jade Characters of the True Writ in cinnabar upon yellow silk, place it upon a renowned mountain, and recite this scripture to exorcise the affliction.

When the four seasons lose their proper order and yin and yang fall out of harmony, inscribe the Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech and Correct Sound Chapter in cinnabar upon green silk, place it within village altars, ancestral temples, or renowned mountains, and recite it to exorcise the affliction.

When the sovereign faces calamity and warfare erupts on all sides, inscribe the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Secret Taboos in cinnabar upon yellow silk, wear it upon the body, and recite it to exorcise the affliction.

When plague and pestilence spread and the people suffer death and injury, inscribe the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Correct Sound Chapter in cinnabar upon green silk, wear it upon the body, and recite it to exorcise the affliction.

When a master or friend’s life is imperiled, inscribe the Great Brahma’s Hidden Speech and Boundless Inner Sound in cinnabar upon yellow silk and burn it to transmit the merit.

The Jade Scripts for exorcism, pacification, and wearing are all found in the *Gate of Exorcism, Pacification, and Talismanic Wearing*. In all applications, visualize oneself as the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, insert the middle finger into the center, draw the Three Qi of the Heavenly Gate, and inscribe the talisman while facing south. If one can perform the fast according to the preceding method, recite with utmost sincerity, inscribe talismans, and chant invocations, then the names of the adept will be recorded in the registers of the heavens, the ten thousand spirits will attend and guard, and one will be deemed a minister of the Golden Towers. The Demon Kings will protect and recommend them.

**Methods for Exorcising Disasters and Transcending Calamities**
The Master says: When the sun and moon are eclipsed, mountains and rivers quake and collapse, plagues spread, yin and yang lose their rhythm, cold and heat arrive out of season, the adept should enter a quiet chamber, sit upright, recite the Great Brahma’s Correct Sound Chapter, and wear the Great Brahma’s Thunder-Spirit Talisman to repel the ten thousand disasters, summon harmonious qi, protect the adept’s body, and bring peace to the land.

The method requires inscribing the talisman in cinnabar upon yellow silk and wearing it, thereby invoking the Five Thearchs, befriending the ten thousand sages, ascending the celestial terrace to achieve transcendence, and enabling the Dharma-body to become a Perfected Person, thus averting calamities and disasters. When inscribing, visualize oneself as the Dao Lord, form the Upper Clarity Mudra, draw the Nine Empyrean’s Correct Qi with the brush, knock the teeth three times, and silently chant the incantation while writing:

*Brahma-qi pervades the cosmos, the Great Brahma radiates light.
Spreading as true writ, the mysterious response attends the dawn.
Flourishing blossoms gleam, once more guarding the Central Yellow.
Stirring the demonic hordes, the Northern Dipper illumines the ridgepole.
Guiding and restoring the flowing Brahma, the Dark Might governs the law.
The Great Thunder-Spirit Sound harmonizes yin and yang.
Commanding the ten thousand spirits, returning to the true constant.
Rectifying and defending against the demonic hordes, my position is supreme.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Numinous Treasure’s Ordinance!*

**The Great Brahma’s Thunder-Spirit Talisman**
*Above, the Eight Gates open; the Flying Heavenly Dharma-Wheel.
The Three Radiances escape form, turning death into life.
Circulating qi through the Yellow Center, the Three Fields naturally ascend.
Encircling the ten directions, transcending fate to return to youth.
The Five Phases follow their sequence, the Four Qi ever abundant.
The Primordial Qi shines forth, the luminous scene boundless.
Brahma-jewels entwine the rosy clouds, the Cinnabar Dragon soars.
The hundred spirits merge as one, the Dark Youth is nurtured.
The Flower Sovereign governs all, receiving the mandate of the Mysterious Ancestry.
Resplendent and majestic, its merit equal to the vast heavens.
The ten thousand qi ascend as immortals, the Dipper’s stars merge in brilliance.
Returning to my primordial chaos, boundless through a hundred million kalpas.
The Jade Edict pacifies and stabilizes, the Direct Talisman resides within.
Illuminating and harmonizing the Two Registers, uniting with the Primordial Merit.*

**The Great Brahma’s Flight Through the Void**
The Master says: When cultivators encounter the Three Origins, the Eight Nodal Days, or their own life-destiny days; when the sovereign faces calamity, famine strikes out of season, or the Dharma-body is afflicted by illness, the Five Sounds’ curses, the direct gaze of baleful stars, or the encroachment of malevolent influences; when the people suffer unresolved grievances, men and women fail to bear children, or fierce and violent spirits lurk in the mountains and forests; or when aerial, subterranean, or mid-air spirits, demonic entities, or monstrous calamities prove difficult to remedy—then one should practice the Way of Flight Through the Void, prostrate oneself in submission with a memorial from the heart, tread the Dipper’s path and the Winnowing Basket’s might, perform the Kan-Li intercourse of qi, silently pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Supreme Thearch, and contemplate the principle of the Mud-Pellet Palace. When one’s understanding penetrates the profound and obscure, ghosts and spirits will tremble and submit, the ten thousand qi will endure forever, suffering will not be endured, the body will radiate light, the ten thousand qi will ascend as immortals, disasters will be averted, and calamities dispelled—this is what is called the Supreme Wondrous Way.

On the day of the fast, at the hour of *yin* on the day of *yin*, enter the chamber and sit upright. Form the Numinous Treasure Mudra with both hands and press them upon the left and right knees. Calm the mind and settle the spirit, ensuring that inner thoughts do not stray outward and outer thoughts do not intrude inward. Visualize the five viscera and six bowels, both inside and out, as crystal-clear. Envision the sun on the left and the moon on the right, nine inches from the face, and above the crown, a five-colored circular image emerging, within which a precious pearl spins in the void.

Next, visualize the Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs, each riding a five-colored, eight-scene chariot, arriving from their respective directions and converging above the crown. From each, five-colored true breaths emerge, intertwining like silk, and ten thousand strands of precious light merge with one’s true qi. After completing the visualization, strike the Dharma-drum twenty-four times to gather the twenty-four qi. Feel the adept’s lower cinnabar field’s mysterious qi spiraling upward, intermingling within the heart, gently coiling and ascending from between the eyebrows to the hairline, where it transforms into twenty-four spirits.

Next, visualize behind the spine a pair of palaces, like halls of lapis lazuli, within which a water-crystal precious pearl radiates light inside and out. From the tailgate, the Kidney Origin’s inverted azure-green spring surges upward to the Mud-Pellet Palace.

Within the palace, sun and moon illumine one another, forming a terrace of golden and azure radiance. Above it, the Primordial Azure Emperor descends in five hues—purple, yellow, white, azure, and green—directly entering the adept’s crown gate, coalescing into a jeweled terrace. Next, visualize the adept’s true qi transforming into an immortal, seated upon the terrace. As the ten thousand qi converge, the body sits amidst a hundredfold radiance of precious light, perceiving the inner and outer realms of the ten directions and three worlds as though they were before one’s eyes.

Then silently recite the sixty-four phrases of the Great Brahma Concealed Speech. For each phrase, from *zi* to *hai* through the twelve palaces, draw in qi and exhale it upon the body. At the four phrases corresponding to *kan*, *li*, *qian*, and *kun*, strike the teeth thirty-six times. Visualize the qi of the Three Purities and Northern Mystery intertwining, with sun and moon exchanging light. Draw in qi, rinse the mouth with saliva, and swallow it nine times while reciting the incantation:

**Incantation:**
*Mystic yellow and plain brilliance, resplendent and luminous the Purple Tenuity.*
*Primordial Azure and jade-like Brahma, interlacing golden mushrooms gleam.*
*Emerging from origin into emptiness, profound and serene the Gate of Gen.*
*Congealing into a numinous embryo, transforming into an infant.*
*Flaring and casting tinkling bells, lushly blooming in verdant beauty.*
*Myriad heavens arrayed in support, afar they reveal their robed presence.*
*Three Fields overflowing and full, auspicious light soaring like rainbows.*
*Yellow and Old transform into immortals, transcending suffering and calamity.*
*Non-action the highest benevolence, with the Dao unblemished.*

Upon completing the incantation, ingest the preceding talisman, turn the body, and exit the chamber—do not glance back or to the sides. Practicing thus for sixty-four days will cause the ten thousand spirits to tremble and submit, summoning the assembly of immortals. The heavens will be free of impurity, the earth purged of malevolent dust, and profound wisdom will pervade clarity, allowing one to enter the Mysterious of the Mysterious and attain the boundless scriptures of the Great Cavern.

**Method for Dispelling Water Monsters**
The Master said: When dark clouds surge violently, appearing reddish-yellow, and qi erupts like smoke, it foretells hail, fierce thunder, and water monsters stirring mischief. If over rivers or seas, black qi and dark clouds arise, great winds may damage things. First, pace the Fire Chime Mudra and hasten the Four Mountains Mudra. From *xu* to *dou*, then to *chen*, trace the talismanic script with the nails. Assume the Upper Clarity Mudra to stabilize it, then mark it with cinnabar. Next, bind it thrice with red silk, stabilize it, face south, and visualize the Primordial Heavenly Worthy in the Mud-Pellet Palace. Silently recite the Concealed Speech ten times, then shift to the Jade Clarity Mudra. Face south, visualize the three rays of Mars like fire, draw them in through the nose, and hold the breath for three cycles while secretly reciting the incantation:

**Incantation:**
*Red, yellow, black—triple wisdom’s numen, the Primordial Worthy’s decree topples water spirits.*

After reciting, exhale toward the cloud’s head thrice, and the water spirits will fall to earth, sparing all from wind and thunder’s harm. If violent winds and torrential rains snap trees and hurl stones, invoke the Heavenly Sovereign Seal: with the left hand’s second finger, press the base of the thumb, then use the thumb to press the middle crease. Silently visualize the cause of the wind’s cessation, recite the incantation, and draw in the northwest qi to exhale it while inscribing the following talisman on tile or stone. Then recite a second talisman, inscribe the Heart Seal, release the mudra, and place the talisman at the Celestial Gate’s direction—the wind will immediately cease.

**Wind-Cessation Talisman**
First inscribe: [symbol]
Then complete: [symbol]
Next inscribe the True Form Heart Seal.

**Incantation to Cease Wind:**
*The Dao’s Dao wholly belongs to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy.*
*Though brushed aside by decrees, it abides above the Celestial Gate.*

The Master said: When crossing rivers or seas and encountering raging waves threatening to capsize the vessel, inscribe the Sea-Pacifying Talisman. Visualize the Dipper’s mouth covering the head, the Big Dipper’s handle pointing forward toward the nose’s tip and the vessel’s bow. Gaze directly at the vessel’s bow while reciting the Disaster-Dispelling Incantation seven times, then the Wave-Ceasing Incantation once. Cast the Sea-Pacifying Talisman, recite the Pacifying Incantation once more, and exhale upon the body—the wind and waves will subside.

**Disaster-Dispelling Incantation:**
*Rolling mists, rolling mists, River Earl leads ahead to halt dragons.*
*Ten thousand disasters vanish, skies clear and bright.*
*Hasten as the Primordial Thearch’s decree!*

**Wave-Ceasing Incantation:**
*Water spirits, wave spirits, Feng Yi their master.*
*Lord Zixu, waves still and waters calm.*
*Heavenly immortals, earthly gods, the Jade Emperor sets forth.*
*Dragons crouch, tigers hide, water officials obey the decree—we remain unharmed.*
*Hasten as the statutes command!*

**Sea-Pacifying Talisman**

**Pacifying Incantation:**
*The Primordial One pacifies and stabilizes, unfolding the Five Chapters.*
*Red-script jade characters, Eight Might Dragons eternal.*
*Preserving and controlling kalpas, ensuring heaven’s enduring existence.*
*Hasten as the Primordial Thearch’s decree!*

**Six Ding Talisman to Slay Water Monsters**
Inscribe this talisman on a square brick. First recite the Cinnabar Ink Brush Incantation:

**Incantation:**
*Supreme Mystery’s killing qi, cinnabar’s flowing light.*
*Entering within, ten thousand evils perish.*
*Hasten as the Numinous Treasure Talisman’s decree!*

This incantation applies to all talismans: recite it first, then inscribe the talisman, and finally recite the prayer incantation:

**Incantation:**
*Six Ding Great Spirits, Six Ding Jade Maidens.*
*Bearing heaven’s talismanic decree, execute and slay monstrous beings.*
*Gouge out eyes, sever claws, take brains, rupture bellies.*
*Hasten as the Numinous Treasure Talisman’s decree!*

Assume the Jade Clarity Mudra, draw in the qi of the *ding* direction of the current ten-day period, exhale it, and cast it forth.

---

**Method for Eliminating Fire Demons**
The Master said: Heaven-born ghostly beings become drought’s harbingers. Heaven-born errant forms are called fire demons. When clouds blaze with crimson haze, qi swells with scorching heat, and winds roar like galloping horses, fire disasters arise. Invoke the *Kan* talisman, ink it, bind it five times with black silk, face north, and visualize five verdant qi in the water *chen* direction. Draw them in through the nose, hold the breath for five cycles, and recite the incantation:

**Incantation:**
*Child of Metal, announce to the child of Water: fire overcomes its mother.*
*Mother and child, hasten to rescue! Swiftly fly, sprinkle to form rivers, pools, seas, and lakes—homesteads’ fires quenched, smoke dissolved.*
*Crimson demonic essence, buried ten thousand feet deep.*
*Hasten as the Primordial Thearch’s statutes!*

Recite the incantation five times, exhale toward the fire demon’s direction, and the blazing calamity will cease, the fire demon perishing and falling. **Method for Extinguishing Fire Harm**
The Master said: When the world harbors mad spirits, they must be eradicated by classification.

For those who die yet retain their numinous essence, they become *gui* (ghosts). When creatures become possessed, they are *jing* (spirits). When the divine turns unruly, it is *xie* (malevolence). When the four births give rise to calamity, they are *yao* (demons). When violent killings manifest transformations, they are *guai* (monstrosities). Some may be mountain ogres, celestial foxes, great pythons, or long dragons, harming living beings. One must establish the **Altar of the Three Heavens’ Serene Qi**, constructed with cold ash, three feet high and three feet six inches square on each side. Two persons shall each hold a *hu* of ash, beginning from the *qian* direction to spread it, dividing into left and right altars, each encircling once. It is also said: the altar’s face should be six feet wide. Outside the altar, arrange seven piles of fire and eight jars of water. At the appointed time, ascend the altar six times daily, wield the sword, and recite the **Divine Duke’s Sweeping Incantation**:

**Incantation:**
*Thirty-two Heavens, thirty-two Emperors.*
*All heavens’ hidden taboos, all heavens’ hidden names.*
*Empty and cavernous within the heavens, the natural numinous script.*
*All heavens’ hidden rhymes, the heavens’ sounds.*
*The heavens’ honored ones, the heavens’ gods,*
*The heavens’ great demons, the heavens’ numina.*
*Nine harmonies and ten unions, transforming into the Upper Clarity.*
*Boundless mysteries, unfathomable in depth.*
*Spread and descend, divine perfected ones, universally delivering heaven and humanity.*
*Today, joyously receiving deliverance, passing through the gates of all heavens,*
*Beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, severing the roots of the earth,*
*Flying through the Five Passes, names recorded in the Great Mystery.*
*Demon kings oversee the reckoning, primordial constraints at the Heavenly Gate.*
*The Eastern Dipper records fate, the Western Dipper inscribes names,*
*The Northern Dipper brings death, the Southern Dipper bestows life,*
*The Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.*
*The Azure Emperor guards the soul, the White Emperor attends the po,*
*The Vermilion Emperor nurtures qi, the Black Emperor circulates blood,*
*The Yellow Emperor rules the center, myriad gods transcend the primordial.*
*Azure Heaven’s Demon King, Bayuan Choubo.*
*Vermilion Heaven’s Demon King, bearing the heavens and shouldering stones.*
*White Heaven’s Demon King, six-eyed mountain reverser.*
*Black Heaven’s Demon King, Jianchou Langfu.*
*Yellow Heaven’s Demon King, crosswise bearing the heavens’ might.*
*The Five Emperors’ Great Demons, ancestors of all gods.*
*Flying and drumming in procession, commanding ghostly legions.*
*Brandishing banners and drumming rhythms, roaming and observing the great void.*
*Self-proclaimed resplendent, all heavens unite in merit.*
*Ascending to deliver humanity, sternly restraining the Northern Zheng.*
*The Divine Duke receives the mandate, universally sweeping away misfortune.*
*Eight Mighties spew venom, fierce steeds spread forth.*
*Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard, the Great Marshal wields the sword.*
*Hurl fire ten thousand leagues, streaming bells in eight directions.*
*Dare to resist or obstruct the perfected ones?*
*Behead with metal and iron, the Great Queen inflicts celestial punishment.*
*Slaughter and dismember ghostly souls, wind and fire unceasing,*
*Severing a thousand thousand heads, annihilating ten thousand ten thousand forms.*
*Demons dare not offend, ghosts dare not be demonic.*
*The Three Officials of the Northern Zheng, clearly inspecting ghostly encampments,*
*Permitting no concealment, the Golden Horse relays the decree.*
*Universally proclaiming without end, all gods heed the command,*
*The Three Realms’ Five Emperors, reporting to the Upper Clarity.*
*If this is not accomplished within seven days, the harm shall be eradicated by heavenly gods,*
*Cast into the altar, severed with the sword, and discarded into flowing water.*
*For minor demons and petty spirits, water and fire need not be employed.*
*Merely inscribe the characters *yan* and *you* in ash upon the altar,*
*And six times daily circumambulate the altar, reciting the Sweeping Incantation.*
*Within three days, the demon shall also be imprisoned within the altar, manifesting its form and traces.*
*Then invoke the altar’s divine officers to dispatch it to the Northern Heavens for punishment.*
*For felling monstrous trees or unorthodox shrines, encircle them with ash,*
*Inscribe the Sweeping Incantation, place it in the southeast,*
*And secretly recite it ten times. Draw the qi of the Heavenly Gate,*
*And execute the Jade Clarity mudra. Within ten days,*
*The heavenly thunder shall strike and fell them.*
*For watercourses or spring sources, inscribe the incantation upon stone and sink it,*
*Reciting as before. Within seven days, dragons and aquatic monsters shall be expelled.*
*Further strike them with talismans, and the response shall be immediate.*
*Constructing the altar with earth is superior to drawing it on level ground.*
*In urgent cases, the altar need not be established.*
*The Master said: *Yan* is the courtyard that binds ghosts. *You* is the chamber that restrains ghosts.*
*Together, they restrain and control ghostly spirits.*
*With two *dou* of ash and the Jade Clarity mudra of both hands,*
*Use the second finger to inscribe them, without need for written memorials.*
*Or write the two talismans in cinnabar on yellow paper,*
*Place them at the center of the ash, and the demonic spirits shall naturally be subdued within.*
*Cast them into water to form a water prison, or burn them in fire to form a fire prison—*
*Transformations are at one’s discretion.*
**Altar of the Three Heavens’ Serene Qi**
**Courtyard for Binding Ghosts**

**Courtyard of Binding Ghosts: "Yan"**
**Chamber of Restraining Ghosts: "You"**

The *Yan* character forms the courtyard that binds ghosts.
The *You* character forms the prison incantation that restrains ghosts.
When ghostly and demonic forces encroach upon the true,
Their crimes violate the statutes of *Yan* and *You*.
Heavenly soldiers of Jade Clarity,
Seize and imprison them within.
Transformations arise naturally—
Let none be allowed to linger.

*Hasten! Hasten! As the Lingbao Ordinance commands.*

The method above employs the Jade Clarity mudra, the eastern *qi*, and the breath blown upon the talisman and into the prison.

**Three Heavens Locust-Driving Method**

The Master said: To drive away locusts, take eight peachwood boards, each two feet and four inches long and three inches wide. Inscribe eight cinnabar *Zhu Hu* talismans with realgar. Offer three portions each of tea, wine, fruit, silk, and colored fabrics in sacrifice to the Vastly Responsive Crimson Thearch of the Southern Direction, the True Lord, and the *Zhu Hu* Envoy. This envoy stands three hundred thousand *zhang* tall, with crimson eyes and scorched hair, clad in a crimson robe and scarlet skirt. His vermilion crown and red shoes bear him aloft on a ten-thousand-*zhang* blaze of fire, wielding a Samādhi fire-wheel. He rides the *qi* of the Vermilion Yang and the Vermilion Bird, with ten thousand birds following in his wake.

Recite the invocation:
*By command of the Primordial Beginning’s teachings and the Crimson Script of the Jade Thearch, drive out insect pests and sever the roots of locusts and borers.*
*I now summon you—execute this without delay.*
*Parents and progeny of locusts,*
*Hasten far away, tarry not!*
*Should a single insect disobey,*
*All shall be reduced to fine dust.*

After the invocation, draw in *qi* and blow it upon the talismans, then drive them into the eight directions, burying them over a foot deep. The locusts shall perish at once, ensuring abundant harvests and accomplishing the work of aiding the world.

**Locust-Driving Vermilion Lake Talisman**
**Six Jia Pest-Expelling Talisman**

*Incantation:*

Above the world, eight thousand celestial beings;
Below, the Four Generals who uphold the earth.
The Three-Five officers and soldiers expel malevolent ghosts;
The Four-Six youths guard your body.
To your left, the Azure Dragon; to your right, the White Tiger.
Above, the Vermilion Bird; below, the Dark Warrior.
Before you, the Merit Clerk; behind, the Registrar.
Should any spiteful specter return to its origin,
If it lingers but a moment—let the Heavenly Axe descend.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Thearch decrees!*

Inscribe this talisman in vermilion upon yellow paper. With the Yuqing mudra, draw the *qi* of the current *jia* direction of the旬 and blow upon it. Use one talisman as a body amulet, burn another in the central courtyard, and a third reduced to ash—mix with water and sprinkle within the chamber. For the fourth, boil with seven black plums and a three-inch piece of licorice, then consume the decoction. All spiteful objects shall be vomited forth.

**Altar Rite for Expelling Spirits and Removing Harm**
The Master says: In the lower regions of mountains and rivers, within seas and rivers, cities and villages, among the spirits of trees, stones, birds, and beasts, the unbalanced gods of the Five Phases, the fierce and malevolent ghosts of the underworld, the specters of *chimei* and spiteful *ya*, the restless dead who feed on blood in Fengdu—these recklessly stir up calamity and harm living beings. Some ally with the *yin* of the north, binding ancestral spirits; others transform into relatives, instigating lawsuits in the underworld courts, spreading fire and harm, extending their afflictions to the living—none of which can be resolved.

Choose a pure chamber or a secluded, quiet place in the wilderness. Take clean earth to construct the **Three Dawns Mysterious Pivot Altar**, three tiers high, each tier one foot in height. The top tier, two feet wide, shall be the central Imperial Palace, where the North Pole Great Emperor and the Heavenly Thearch Great Emperor are enshrined. The middle tier, three feet wide, shall array the Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper, the Six Officers of the Southern Dipper, and the Three Terraces of the Sun and Moon—all arranged according to their stellar forms, with lamps lit accordingly. The bottom tier, six feet wide, shall list the Three Origin Generals, the Twelve Branch Deities, the Year Star, the *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo* Envoys, the Four Duty Clerks, and the Local Earth God. Before them, set up the ritual table, inscribing the taboo names of the Northern and Southern Dippers upon the lamps, extending to the table below.

Follow the rites to petition and disclose hidden transgressions, repenting one’s faults, harmonizing fate, and dispelling calamities. When the human path is solemn and pure, ghostly and demonic forces will subside. If constructing an earthen altar is not feasible, use white chalk to draw three tiers upon the ground and proceed according to the rites.

**Three Dawns Mysterious Pivot Altar**
**Altar Rite for Dispelling Calamities and Resolving Adversity**
The Master says: For all great calamities, disasters, and misfortunes, one must follow the Great Crimson Metal Canon, constructing the **Three Heavens General Qi Altar**—its form described previously. For minor adversities, establish the **Life-Transformation Altar**, five feet high with a circular surface nine feet in diameter. Erect a standard pole atop it, bearing a celestial disk, and place nine Dipper lamps. If unable to build an earthen altar, use white chalk or a blade to draw a circle, placing the Dipper lamps upon a table or stool to symbolize the celestial disk and the form of the Dipper. Adhering precisely to the form is especially efficacious.

Next, prepare cold water, seasonal flowers, fine incense, choice fruits, and pure wine—each in nine portions. Paint nine cloud-horses, the horses in galloping posture, the clouds in soaring form. In the blank spaces, write the native place and name of the afflicted, along with the causes of their suffering, and petition for deliverance, that they may pass through their trials, attain eternal life, and inscribe the year, month, day, and hour. On each cloud-horse, write the name of one star. On the saddle of each, inscribe the Dipper talismans from the *Dipper Scripture* in vermilion. For each star, prepare one petition in the usual form. At the time of burning, also paint six cloud-horses, inscribing the Southern Dipper talismans from the *Dipper Scripture*, following the same form.

Additionally, inscribe three **Three Heavens Life-Nurturing Talismans** in vermilion. Have the afflicted person use one to write their lifelong secrets and the causes of their hidden transgressions in a sealed document, along with nine strings of gold coins, and burn them with the cloud-horses. Take another talisman, burn it to ash, and consume it. Wear the third upon the crown of the head, perform ninety-eight prostrations, and all calamities shall be resolved, restoring life at once.

**Three Heavens Life-Nurturing Talisman** (also called **Harmonizing Fate Talisman**)
Below the talisman, write: "[Name] was born in the year, month, day, and hour of [date], under the governance of [specific star] of the Northern Dipper, which oversees their lifelong transgressions." Write freely, petitioning for forgiveness. Respectfully invoke the Five Star Spirit-Responding Emperor Lords to harmonize [Name]’s fate.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Heavenly Worthy decrees, by the command of the Original Master Perfected Lord!*
Inscribe in vermilion, recite the incantation seven times, and blow the *qi* of the Northern Dipper’s *wu* and the native star upon it.

**Flying Dipper Rite**
**Secret Petition to the Flying Spirits**
The mudra states: First, step into the Dipper, entering from the handle. Return to the handle, covering the body. Step into the Dipper’s mouth again, bow three times. On the third bow, prostrate and visualize the body as follows: From the lower cinnabar field, a white-robed figure enters; from the Crimson Palace, a green-robed figure enters; from the Mud Pill Palace, a purple-robed figure enters. Conclude by visualizing the *qi* of the five viscera in their five colors. Ride this *qi* with your spirit, using the tongue as the Immortal’s Bridge, like a long rainbow, faintly visible. After a long while, it gradually becomes distinct. Before you appears a pool of water, upon which you see a bridge leading straight into the Dipper’s mouth. Ride the *qi* onto the bridge, entering the Dipper’s mouth. There, you see radiant light, like the moon. Within it stands a jade palace with golden steps. Silently call the Four Duty Envoys and state your purpose. See the envoys enter the Dipper and petition each stellar palace in turn. Then, the *Qingyang* and *Tuoluo* Envoys descend to inspect the ritual altar and report back to the stellar palace. The Dipper’s reporting officers lead the petitioner to present their case, and upon receiving the decree’s grace, bow and return. Again, visualize as before and proceed to the Southern Dipper to present your case. Then, see the Fire Chime Great General and the Six Star Youths descend, inspecting as before.

After a long while, purple clouds and rare fragrances appear, or crimson light enters the chamber—this marks the descent of the Two Dippers. Taboo for filial sons, women, chickens, dogs, monks, and nuns to witness. Burn the talisman over the lamp.

Southern Dipper Talisman. See *The Dipper Classic*.
Northern Dipper Talisman. See *The Dipper Classic*.

**Altar Setup for Prayers, Exorcisms, Stabilizations, and Thanksgivings**
The Master says: For prayers, exorcisms, stabilizations, and thanksgivings, one must establish a *xuantan* (Mystic Altar), following the same form as the Yellow Register’s *Lingbao Xuantan* for delivering the deceased. Though the purposes differ, the rituals and standards remain the same, including the opening of Heaven’s Gate and Earth’s Door. However, for exorcism and stabilization rites, add the Twelve Branch Deities, twelve mirrors and swords, and forty-four streamers of five-colored silk—eight of each of the four colors for the four directions, and twelve yellow ones for the center. Arrange forty-nine lamps for the Five Directions, the Eight Trigrams, the Nine Palaces, the Twelve Lineage Deities, the Twelve Branch Great Deities, the Three Terraces, and the Nine Dawns. These methods have long been practiced in the world.

**Lingbao Xuantan**
**Fire Chime Method for Warding Off Evil and Curing Disasters**
The Master says: In the Southern Palace resides the Han Controller of the Fire Bureau, where the *Red Script of Inevitable Blazing Fire* is kept, along with the Golden True Spirit Seal. This seal gathers the radiant *qi* of cinnabar clouds, condensing the mysterious script of the Three Luminaries. Named the *Cinnabar Heaven Flowing Gold Fire Chime Spirit Seal*, its cinnabar brilliance reflects the sun, and its golden fire blazes with splendor. It summons dragons and calls forth thunder, refines souls to ascend as immortals, vanquishes water monsters, dispels yin specters, cures disasters and plagues, delivers from calamities and wards off illness. It burns away the Six Uglies and subdues the Five Demons.

Attending the seal are three thousand *qi*-bearing Cinnabar Radiance Upper Officials, six hundred Fire Chime Great Generals, and one hundred twenty Golden Light Spirit Lads. When the seal is invoked, its radiance follows its command, for it is the general decree of the Dipper’s Red Emperor and the Fire Chime of Lord Han, hidden within the Cinnabar Flame Bureau and the Terrace of Brilliance. Inscribed with crimson jade script and sealed with the *Primordial Illumination of the Numinous Void*, it is bestowed upon the officials of the Southern Palace every three hundred years to assist in transforming and enacting merit in the Lower Realm. Those who receive it must keep it in their hearts and never reveal it to the unworthy. Those who recklessly disclose it will be punished by the Left Bureau.

**Method for Crafting the Fire Chime Seal**
The Master says: To craft the seal, choose a *bing* or *ding* day, selecting wood of the Fire Phase in the *Na Yin* system. Use a branch from a divine peach tree in a numinous place, facing south, and have a craftsman carve it. The seal should be two *cun* and one *fen* square, with a thickness of seven *fen*. After carving, bury it in a clean place at the southeast corner, seven *cun* deep. Daily, bring incense to the burial site, burn it, and perform three bows without reciting any invocation before withdrawing. After seven days, retrieve the seal, wash off the soil with flowing water, bathe it in fragrant water, and fill its grooves with true cinnabar. Perform the ritual offering as prescribed. Store it constantly in a yellow brocade pouch lined with green cinnabar, ensuring it is not soiled by dust or violated by impure *qi*. Violations will prevent the assisting spirits from descending, rendering one’s devoted efforts futile.

**Method for Receiving and Holding the Spirit Seal**
The Formula says: To receive and hold the seal, place the seal charm behind your elbow. On a *ding* day at the *ding* hour, face the *ding* direction, step the Fire Chime *Gang*, and visualize the true forms of six Jade Maidens.

The Incantation says: [Text missing]... *command*.

[...] *command*. Draw in and gather. Visualize entering the seal. Swiftly as the Fire Chime *Gang* gathers.

Recite the incantation six times. With each recitation, draw *qi* and exhale onto the seal. For seven days, abstain from meat and all pungent or rank foods. On the seventh day’s completion, at the *jia* day’s *jia* hour, face the *jia* direction, step the Fire Chime *Gang*, and visualize the true forms of six *Jia* Spirit Generals.

The Incantation says: [...] *command*. Draw in and settle. Enter the seal and stabilize. Swiftly as the Fire Chime *Gang* gathers.

Recite the incantation six times. With each recitation, draw *qi* and blow onto the seal. For two days, abstain from the five pungent vegetables, fruits, and oils. On the second day’s completion, on the *bing* day, face the *bing* direction, step the Fire Chime *Cheng*, turn toward the sun, and knock the teeth nine times. Visualize the sunlight covering the seal’s grooves, coiling ninefold.

The Incantation says:
Oh, Radiant Youth, summon the luminous *Yu Yi*.
The Red Emperor floats in the cavernous void, the Southern Gate spouts brilliance.
Jade eyes gleam, myriad evils disperse.
I follow my master’s command, daring not delay.
Ninefold light *qi* entwines, *Ding* and *Jia* spirits attend.
By the Primal August’s oral *command*, yin *qi* dissolves into mist.

Recite the incantation eighty-one times, draw *qi* eighty-one times, and spray onto the seal. At the *chen* day’s *xu* hour, step the Fire Chime *Gang*, face the Dipper, knock the teeth seven times, and look upward to invoke.

The Incantation says:
*Tuo Luo Yu Miao*, pure light of the Dipper’s dawn.
Divine Youth of the Great One, Sovereign of the *Kui Gang*.
Mysterious *qi* of the Primal August nurtures the seal to connect with the true.
Utmost numinous, utmost sacred—defy evil and it must respond.
Fire Chime and golden light, rebuke and sever demonic *qi*.
*Kui* radiance and *Gang* *qi* shatter ten thousand ills.
One seal brings fortune, primal, prosperous, and steadfast.

Recite the incantation forty-nine times, draw *qi* forty-nine times, and blow onto the seal. Thus concludes the ritual offering; store the seal.

**Method for Using the Seal**
For sealing mountains, summoning spirits, issuing orders to dragons, severing demonic influences, subduing waters, crossing waves, curing epidemics, and dispelling afflictions: with both hands, form the Fire Chime mudra, step the Fire Chime *Gang*, face south, and visualize the heart’s fire intertwining like silk, entering the seal’s grooves in a ninefold coil, as if enveloped in a net of crimson light.

Upon completion, knock the teeth nine times and invoke:
I, [Name], humbly petition the Supreme Lord of the Southern Primordial *Qi*, the Venerable Perfected of Longevity, the Great Divinity Han Jun Sima. May you bestow the true *qi* into my seal. As the *qi* descends, may the golden true and jade radiance, the Eight Luminaries’ great spirits, the Fire Chime generals, the Illuminating Divine Youths, the Three *Qi*’s superior officers, and Wen Xiu Shu Guang follow the seal’s command. Manifest celestial might, incinerate and expel demonic ills. Cast forth fire to strike, let the ringing chime pursue. Wind rages, fire strikes—whatever the seal imprints shall be steadfast and prosperous. By the Jade Emperor’s supreme decree, the divine lords shall execute. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Fire Chime’s law commands.

After the invocation, draw the Upper Official’s true *qi* into the mouth and spread it over the seal before imprinting. Whether imprinting on sand, stone, sinking it in water or earth, inscribing silk to swallow or wear, sealing clay, or stamping afflicted areas, no more than three applications are needed for a cure. Beware of impure *qi* contaminating the seal; contamination will shatter its power and render it ineffectual.

**Fire Chime Spirit Seal of Flowing Gold**
**Fire Chime *Gang***
Use the Fire Chime mudra: press the left hand’s middle finger to the *Li* trigram, then hook beneath *Jia* into the seal.

**Fire Chime Seal Method for Healing Illnesses**
The Formula says: For ailments of cold *qi*, painful *qi*, and the like, the left hand forms the *Zhao Li* mudra (also called the Solar Lord mudra). Many texts use *chen* as the solar mudra, unaware that *chen* represents the Celestial Pivot. Heaven’s yellow *qi* and yang essence nurture the soul through the luminous *San Qi*, hence the *Li* mudra is the Solar Lord mudra. The right hand holds the seal, ensuring movements are deliberate and unhurried, lest the spirit *qi* become frivolous, inviting mockery from shamans and the vulgar.

Proceed two steps toward the afflicted area, the seal’s inscription facing it. Invoke the Supreme Lord of the Primordial *Qi*, the Venerable Perfected of Longevity, and the minor affliction of [Name], humbly requesting true *qi*. Solemnly summon the Flying Chime of the Crimson Realm’s Imperial Lord, the attending officer Wen Xiu Shu, and the radiant seal that vanquishes demons.

Next, draw the sun’s rays into the body and mind, merging them as one. Exhale through the nose, threading the seal’s *qi* to envelop the afflicted area in three coils before ceasing.

Inscribe this talisman in vermilion on yellow paper, using the Three Clarities’ mudra and the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate. Blow the incantation, then draw the *qi* of the Five Directions and blow it.

*Shangqing Lingbao Great Method, Scroll Twelve, Complete*
*Shangqing Lingbao Great Method, Scroll Thirteen*

**The Gate of Subduing Demons and Subjugating Spirits**
*Compiled by Master Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Shangqing and Successor of the Lingbao Teachings, as transmitted by the Illuminating and Salvific Perfected Ning Quanzhen, the Reclusive High Scholar of the Subtle Grotto*

The Master said: The Great Method of Lingbao is the root and origin of Heaven and Earth, the wondrous *qi* of the Primordial Beginning. Phoenix scripts and dragon charts coalesce into true writ, while numinous sounds and Sanskrit chants become incantations. The Primordial Beginning Emperor manifested the formless principle, transmitting its essential mechanism to the Dao Lord to deliver and rescue the deluded masses, expounding and propagating the supreme Dao. These are no ordinary words of the mundane world, but rather the hidden mysteries of the various heavens.

The superior practitioner who cultivates this may ascend to tread upon the Jade Capital. The middling practitioner may relocate to dwell in the immortal chambers. The inferior practitioner may abide in the world and prolong their years. Yet the foolish and vulgar of this degenerate age, shallow in fortune and meager in karmic affinity, how could they fathom its profundities?

Moreover, the ancestral transmitted texts were all composed by those great alchemists among the immortals who accumulated merit and amassed virtuous deeds. Those who encountered its essential wonders and met with true masters were granted seals, mudras, talismans, and charts without exception. Some obtained its guiding threads through dream visions, while others received its essential purport from divine beings. Once their minds opened and spirits awakened, their wisdom renewed daily. Upon perceiving its wondrous sounds, they penetrated the obscure and grasped the principles, summoning spirits and calling generals who appeared before their very eyes. The Three Realms revered and obeyed, while the celestial heavens admired and looked up to them—such were those who transformed through the Dao and delivered the dead through virtue.

Later scholars, however, often failed to encounter their proper masters. Some transmitted it through fragments of written text, while others obtained it through recitation, visualization, and contemplation of scriptures and mudras. When they chanced upon essential texts, they claimed ultimate attainment, boasting of their own correctness and clinging stubbornly to delusion. For their conduct was shallow, their virtue slight, their fortune thin, and their karmic affinity weak. Some acquired texts adorned with ornate rhetoric, while others received talismanic charts and diagrams with incomplete incantations and indistinct talismanic forms. Errors in practice and inaccuracies in visualization and invocation led to the inability of celestial perfected beings to assist them. All turned from the true to the false, and when the myriad demons tested them, many came to resent the Dao.

Little did they know that the secret texts of Lingbao possess a coherent order in every method. Talismans have their esoteric techniques, incantations their hidden chapters. There are secret texts for subduing demons and suppressing evil, and heart-seals for emerging from death and entering life. Wearing talismans on the arm and sealing with mudras, presenting petitions and covenant talismans, proclamations and circular charts, vows to subdue demons and precepts—those who obtain these ascend to the supreme Dao, soaring to meet the Mysterious Origin. They deliver the souls of the dead in an instant and revive withered bones with a breath. City gods, earth deities, and local spirits all come under their command, while wind, rain, thunder, and lightning all fall within their domain of control.

Practitioners of the Dao must first master the methods of control and restraint. There are ten kinds of demons, as detailed below. Scholars should deeply cultivate and penetrate these teachings, lest they be tested by demons—only then can the Dao be accomplished.

**Guard this well. Discerning the Control of the Ten Demons**

1. **Celestial Demons**
2. **Terrestrial Demons**
3. **Human Demons**
4. **Ghost Demons**
5. **Spirit Demons**
6. **Yang Demons**
7. **Yin Demons**
8. **Disease Demons**
9. **Baleful Demons**
10. **Environmental Demons**

**Celestial Demons** afflict those who cultivate in mountains and forests. Even a single fleeting thought may invite demonic ruin, preventing attainment of perfection. For instance, when refining the great elixir and entering seclusion to practice, one might suddenly perceive apparitions—forms and shadows, banners and canopies, flowers and strange fragrances, auspicious clouds—or hear celestial music. These are the trials of celestial demons. One should burn incense, wear the *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* and the *Jade Talisman for Dispelling Demons of the Five Emperors*, placing them before the altar. With the left hand, summon the middle finger’s center, and with the right hand, wield the *Great Demon-Sealing Seal of the Five Emperors*. Transform into the Primordial Beginning and illuminate the demon with the seal—it will retreat of its own accord.

**Terrestrial Demons** test practitioners who transform spirits, pace the stars, inscribe talismans, and consecrate water. Any impure thought during these acts invites their trials. For example, when attempting visualization, the mind may wander; when pacing the stars and forming mudras, inscribing talismans, or reciting incantations, one’s focus may falter. One might see forms without discerning their names, or spirits may possess the body without communicating clearly. They resist the Daoist methods, slander the numinous texts—these are not mere malevolent ghosts but the trials of terrestrial demons. One should employ the *Five Directions’ Protective Barrier of the Numinous Empyrean Jade Clarity Perfected King* and burn it.

**Human Demons** afflict all practitioners. When dwelling in mountains or entering chambers to inscribe talismans, recite incantations, form mudras, and practice, just as one is about to apply the method, a single deviant thought may arise. One might be disturbed by vulgar chatter, chickens, dogs, women, monks, nuns, or laypeople, leading to confusion of the dharmic body, impure visualization, and ineffective talismanic water. These are the trials of human demons. One should use the *Seal of the Hundred Spirits’ Union*, place it upon the altar, swiftly inscribe the four characters "束缚魔灵" (*Subdue and Bind Demon Spirits*), seal it with the imprint, and burn it in the incense. With the *zi* and *hai* characters on the left and right, recite the summoning sounds of the *Three Ranks of Demon Kings*—the demon will retreat.

**Ghost Demons** test practitioners who venture into the wilds and establish altars upon burial grounds. A single momentary lapse may lead to frequent nightmares, empty houses echoing with sounds, animals manifesting forms, insects and snakes appearing as omens, disrupting the true method and wantonly destroying the numinous altar. These are the trials of ghost demons. One should place the *Seal of the Lord of the Cold Luminosity Method* upon the altar, inscribe the four characters "元始安鎮" (*Primordial Beginning Pacifies and Guards*), seal it with the imprint, and affix it to the altar. Then recite the *Two Chapters of the Numinous Writ of Cold Luminosity*—the demon will retreat.

**Spirit Demons** test practitioners who drive away evil and dismantle temples. A single moment of recklessness may invite their trials. They may manifest forms, hurl stones, or employ myriad deceptive tactics—stealing ritual implements from the altar, pilfering elixirs and secret texts, harassing and disturbing the dharmic body without respite. These are the trials of spirit demons. One should wear the *Two Seals of the Northern Deng* upon the arm, and summon the *Multitude of Perfected of the Mysterious Range* to subdue them.

Still inscribe the eight characters "Divine Lord Receives Mandate to Universally Sweep Away Inauspiciousness" and affix them to the four sides of the altar. Then burn the *Thirty-Two Heavens’ Hidden Taboo Chapters* before the chamber to dispatch them—the demon will retreat.

**Yang Demons** test practitioners who, in their inner cultivation, seek to deliver beings from life and death. A single impure thought may stir the four desires, clinging to attachments, entangling in right and wrong—these are the trials of yang demons. One should rectify the mind and silently recite the *Nine Invocations of the Heavenly Rite to Subdue Demons and Extinguish Evil*, strike the teeth thrice, inscribe the eight characters "Eight Luminaries Darkly Merge Qi to Enter the Mysterious Mystery," burn and ingest them, wear the *Five Directions’ Jade Writs to Restrain Demons*, recite the *Five Directions’ Demon-Restraining Mantras*, and perform the *Circuit of the Dipper and Step of the Winnowing Basket Mudra*—the demon will retreat. This belongs to the *Luminous Purity Method*.

**Yin Demons** test mountain-dwelling practitioners who study secret texts and engage in visualization. A single errant thought may summon mournful songs and clamorous winds across the wilds, giving rise to inverted perceptions. Upon venturing forth, one may encounter monks or nuns who cast defiling influences, disrupting one’s divine radiance—these are the trials of yin demons. One should strike the teeth seven times, execute the *Noon Mudra*, visualize the *Primordial Yuan Qi* pouring into the body, ingest the eight characters "Five Elders Unlock the Gates as the Multitude of Immortals Flanks the Chariot," seal them with the *Five Thearchs’ Great Demon Seal*, and wear the *Jade Registers of the Five Offices of Youthful Simplicity*. Recite the *Lower Chapter of the Numinous Writ*, burn the *Dragon Script and Phoenix Qi Writ*—the demon will retreat.

**Illness Demons** test practitioners whose single deviant thought disrupts the harmony of the Four Great Elements, whose diet is irregular, whose response to cold and heat is imbalanced, giving rise to ailments that impair their practice. Place the *Five Talismans to Dissolve Demons* within the chamber, use the *Five Thearchs’ Great Demon Seal*, recite the *Two Chapters of the Numinous Writ of Cold Luminosity*, ingest the eight characters "Eight Luminaries Darkly Merge Qi to Enter the Mysterious Mystery," along with the *Cold Luminosity Longevity Talisman*, wear the *Jade Calendar Chapter of the Primordial Grotto*, strike the teeth to gather the spirits, confess sins while burning incense, and recite the *Cloud Petition and Precious Canopy Ritual Texts*. Summon the yin and yang spirits to harmonize—the demon will retreat.

**Spectral Demons** abound in mountains and forests. When entering a retreat for cultivation, a single impure thought may attract foxes, mountain spirits, stone specters, and malevolent sprites who, fearing the practitioner’s attainment of the Dao, transform into alluring apparitions seeking shelter and sustenance. They may sing lewd verses or manifest in seductive forms. Advanced practitioners guard against them with unshakable resolve, recite the *Three Chapters of the Demon King*, and trace the *Mudra of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Kings* in rotation. Illuminate them with the *Seal of the Heavenly Treasure Lord*, burn the *Five Thearchs’ Great Demon Talismans* before the chamber, then burn incense, ascend the seat, and recite the *Dharma Discourses of the Three Caverns of the Numinous Treasure*—the demon will retreat, never to return. Offering them a measure of grain is especially effective.

**Environmental Demons** test practitioners during their practice, whether on the road or in another chamber, by manifesting objects to provoke thoughts of greed or delusion. Hearing foul sounds or seeing improper sights—even within one’s own chamber—are trials of environmental demons. One should rectify the mind, concentrate the spirit, and abide in the true nature of the Great Void, inwardly and outwardly pure, free from attachments. Visualize a luminous pearl within the emptiness, its radiance resplendent, drawing homage from the ten directions. Ingest the *Secret Taboos of the Various Heavens*, recite the *Precious Scripture of Cold Luminosity* once through, and wear the *Nine Elders’ Demon-Subduing Seal of Supreme Purity*—the demon will retreat.

**Wisdom Mantra of the Golden Portal Primordial Dao Lord to Annihilate Ninety-Six Heterodoxies and One Hundred Eighty Heavenly Demons**

Heaven and earth’s miscellaneous qi
Give birth to all manner of specters and evils.
Ever with the Orthodox Dao,
Dispel and banish their miasmic influences.

First, contemplate:
I have no ledger of merits or demerits.
All dharmas are empty,
No mutual transformation.
The One True Realm—
Flying demons and ghosts.
Know their dwelling place,
Truly know the expedient means.
Provisional emptiness and existence
Are the nature of dharma and principle.
Serene and ever-abiding,
Without coming or going.
First, know reality.
Second, know demons.
Third, eliminate appearances.
Fourth, discern emptiness.
*Qian*, *Kun*, *Li*, *Zhen*—
Evil cannot encroach upon the upright.
Those who confront the martial,
All array themselves before the ranks.
Hasten! As the statutes command.

For this method, first strike the teeth twelve times and silently recite the mantra without regard to the number of repetitions. The demons will promptly generate wholesome thoughts and prostrate at the seat. If one wishes to eradicate them, recite extensively—the rest will flee and dissolve in accordance with the mantra.

**The Gate of Subjugation, Exorcism, and Control**
**The Five Scrolls Unfolded**

The Master said: The Five Scrolls are the primordial, spontaneously arisen flying essences of the Most High Lord of the Dao, the purest *qi* of the Void and Primordial Chaos, congealed into jade scriptures and enshrined above the Great Veil. In the first year of the Highest Sovereign, when stars and constellations clashed and baleful astral influences descended, trespassing upon the Three Heavens, the Perfected of True Brahma was commanded to bear the Five Scrolls and bestow them upon the Five Emperors, thereby anchoring them at the Celestial Origin to govern the celestial administration. The Perfected of True Suchness was then commanded to fast and bear the Five Scrolls, bestowing them upon the Five Marchmounts to stabilize the terrestrial order and subdue the single *qi* of the earth. The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct was further commanded to entrust them to the masters of the sacred mountains, that they might await those who attain the Dao, propagate the teachings, and deliver beings from the cycle of birth and death.

The power of the *qi* of the Five Scrolls is vast: above, it dissolves celestial calamities; in the middle, it stabilizes the fortunes of the state; below, it delivers the people. When summoning the Five Emperors of the Three Realms and establishing altars and terraces, one should choose an auspicious day, inscribe the texts in evergreen cinnabar on plain silk, and display them in the five directions—thus do the myriad spirits tremble and submit, and the host of immortals assemble. This can be used to avert and transcend misfortune.

In the method of the Five Refining of the Living Corpse, they are burned for use. If a living person undergoes refinement, wearing them upon the body ensures transcendence of the world and perpetual freedom from disaster. After the body’s passing, the earthly officials will receive and escort them, sparing them the trials of hell, allowing them to regain form and wander the vastness of the Great Void. If a suffering soul undergoes refinement and encounters these texts, their body will be suffused with sacred radiance, forever severing delusion and offering a path to escape the wheel of rebirth.

For those who practice the Numinous Treasure teachings and dwell in the mountains to cultivate and refine, constantly wearing these scrolls—or enshrining them in secluded valleys—will ensure that demons dare not approach, evil dare not encroach, and the body is revered by the myriad heavens. Divine luminaries will guard the gates, inner and outer brilliance will prevail, and no calamity will intrude. Truly, this is the means to preserve and control the kalpa, ensuring the heavens endure forever.

**Method for Inscribing the Talismans**
The method states: When inscribing, first purify a chamber, face east, bow twice, and kneel upright. Visualize oneself as the Most High Lord of the Dao, attended by myriad spirits, the body radiant with light. Gather the *qi* of the five directions in their five colors, grasp the Jade Purity mudra, draw nine breaths of *qi* through the nose into the mouth, swallow nine times, and circulate the *qi* of the cinnabar field upward to strike the Mud Pill Palace, suffusing the entire body and permeating the hundred apertures. Release a great radiance to illuminate all heavens and earths, the sun, moon, and constellations.

Then recite the secret incantation twelve times, draw *qi* into the brush, rise, bow again, take up the brush, and strike the teeth thirty-two times. Face east and inscribe. Upon completion, overlay the talisman with the forms of the stars and constellations, visualizing the radiance of the celestial bodies and the *qi* of the Five Scrolls intermingling within and without. Then store them away. When using them, face the Gate of Heaven, burn incense, bow twice, kneel upright, and silently report to the Most High Lord of the Dao, stating the purpose. Only then retrieve and employ them—there will be no failure. Guard this secret with utmost care.

**Secret Incantation for Inscribing the Five Scrolls**
*"Convergence of the Imperial Honored Ones, eight revolutions and nine births.
Jade Dawn and Golden Flower, the Perfected unfold the teachings.
Flying gales and jade chariots, the Great Simplicity governs truth.
Numinous Treasure and Heavenly Root, the Six Harmonies penetrate the numinous.
The Five Scrolls, spontaneously formed, compose the true script.
I now inscribe the talismans, the Most High apportions the *qi*.
The myriad spirits harmonize, all assembling in the imperial court."*

**Here ends Scroll Fourteen of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual**
**Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual**

Transmitted by the Cavernous Subtlety’s Eminent Master, Radiant Light Deliverance-from-Suffering Perfected One Ning Quanzhen to the Supreme Purity Three Caverns’ Disciple, Numinous Treasure Lineage Preceptor Wang Qizhen

**The Gate of Subjugation, Exorcism, and Control**
**The Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern**

The Master said: The Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern, wondrous transformation of the Supreme Ultimate, was once bestowed by the Heavenly Perfected August One upon the Jade Ascension’s Soaring Victory Heaven, where the Void Thearch Celestial Worthy received the Numinous Treasure Great Ritual and conferred it upon the Eastern Florescence’s Supreme Minister, Cavern Spirit Grand Master, who governed the registers of the Lower Origin’s living beings.

The Left Bureau and all the Transcendent Officials declared: The Nine Empyreans’ total incantation and the Eight Thearchs’ celestial governance cannot subdue and transform the Nine Yangs nor illuminate the path to salvation without the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern. Thus:

- **Divine Empyrean Jade Purity Void Thearch Heaven** arises from the overflowing luminous effulgence of the Nine Yangs’ pure and void incantation’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Cinnabar Empyrean Southern Culmen Jade Writ Heaven** arises from the overflowing cinnabar numinous wondrous effulgence of the Cavern Yang’s true primordial incantation’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Azure Empyrean Supreme Void True Culmen Heaven** arises from the overflowing vast numinous great effulgence of the Upper Yang’s primordial true and unified *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Jade Empyrean Jade Numinous Plain Effulgence Heaven** arises from the overflowing jade numinous plain effulgence of the pure Yang’s ultimate true primordial unity’s void, forming its celestial realm.
- **Supreme Empyrean Supreme Numinous True Primordial Heaven** arises from the overflowing supreme numinous cavernous effulgence of the Three Yangs’ Nine Perfected Great Unity’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Jasper Empyrean Plain Numinous Luminous Primordial Heaven** arises from the overflowing plain numinous luminous effulgence of the Six Yangs’ cavernous true and ultimate unity’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Purple Empyrean Primordial Numinous Supreme Culmen Heaven** arises from the overflowing primordial numinous purple effulgence of the pure Yang’s wondrous true Heavenly Unity’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Scenic Empyrean Wondrous Numinous Treasure Effulgence Heaven** arises from the overflowing wondrous numinous treasure effulgence of the Scenic Yang’s true essence and void unity’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.
- **Azure Empyrean Jade Effulgence Primordial Culmen Heaven** arises from the overflowing azure numinous jade effulgence of the primordial Yang’s celestial true and pure unity’s *qi*, forming its celestial realm.

These Nine Empyreans and Nine Heavens are all opened and transformed by the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern. Radiant and resplendent, wondrously incantatory, their pure flourishing purple cinnabar becomes the celestial seal-script of the true writ, the essence of the Upper Numinous.

Thus, the Crimson Writ transforms the Chaotic Cavern, and the Chaotic Cavern transforms the Primordial Net, encompassing the Way of the Heavenly Origin’s Nine *Qi*. Descending further, it permeates the Nine Causes, reaching the Eight Incantatory True Jade Palace—all likewise transformed by this writ.

Within the Great Cinnabar Heaven lies the Crimson Thearch’s Palace, the Abandoned Worthies’ World of the Brahmā Treasure’s Cinnabar Numinosity, all governed by the Crimson Thearch Lord. Within it are the Vermilion Mound’s Prefecture, the Flowing Fire’s Court, the Great Blaze’s Palace, the Crimson Clarity’s Hall, the Cinnabar Mound’s Fire Pool, and the Primordial Beginning Celestial Worthy’s crucible of true writs—all transformations of the Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern.

**Jade Seal-Script of Seventy-Two Characters**
**The Crimson Writ of the Chaotic Cavern**

The Primordial Beginning initiates the Great Mystery, inaugurating the numinous from the Void’s utmost limit—formless, a single *qi* flows into shape, transforming to give birth to the Two Radiances and Five Wefts, congealing essence and merging naturally. Ever eradicating knotted fetters, it gathers the true and spreads radiance, resplendent and blazing. With *yi*-clarity and scorching flame, it holds fast to vast clarity, aligning the Seven Epochs in perfect harmony. The master Lu Hao of the Cinnabar Heaven shines with crystalline brilliance, refining and delivering the vermilion mist to scatter luminous glory. The Three Florets luxuriate in splendor, their radiance illuminating the Thearch’s dawn.

**Jade Writs of the Primordial Cavern’s Celestial Calendar**

The Master said: In former times, at the Chaotic Cavern’s Qi Ford, the Great Brahmā’s Net of Heaven remained undivided, yin and yang shrouded in darkness, intermingled. The Three Causes revolved ninefold, six transformations and seven cycles unfolded—then the Primordial Beginning first took form, and the Five Kalpas began their transformation. Thereupon, the Primordial Dawn Lord of the Brahmā Origin was commanded to inscribe the celestial cycles of the Five Kalpas. Thus, the *Primordial Cavern* names the ancestral *qi*, and the *Celestial Calendar* records the kalpic revolutions of the Heavenly Origin. Riding five cycles to return to the One, from the One *qi* transformations diverged, and the Three Causes became nine.

Like dragons or serpents, they coiled through the Nine Paths, boundless and infinite, encompassing the primordial *qi* of the Nine Yangs. The Most High, through the ninefold revolution of the Brahmā, three and five riding the Primordial, combined forty-two *qi* to inaugurate the ancestral *qi* of the Azure Heaven’s Origin. The Eastern Beginning Azure’s Origin corresponds to the inception of the Nine Yangs’ Wooden Thearch—thus the East receives nine *qi* to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Dragon Han*. Next, the Nine Causes reiterated, replete with yang *qi*, unfolding the Crimson Writs. Streaming light scattered and descended, five times revealing the cinnabar charts. The Most High, with three riding five, thrice revolved the vermilion essence, combining twenty-four *qi* to open the ancestral *qi* of the Southern Cinnabar Heaven’s One. Illuminating the Southern Vermilion Light’s Origin, it corresponds to the inception of the Three Yangs’ Fiery Thearch—thus the South receives three *qi* to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Crimson Clarity*.

Next, the Nine Causes accumulated anew, the Central Yellow transforming the Origin. The celestial wefts coiled and enveloped the Brahmā Origin, opening the ancestral *qi* of the Central August Heaven’s One. Illuminating the Central Numinous Yellow Floret’s radiance, it corresponds to the inception of the Five Yangs’ Earthen Lord—thus the Center receives twelve *qi* to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Highest Thearch*. Next, the Nine Origins reiterated, the Pale Radiance inaugurated yang, the Seven Luminaries blazed with Brahmā splendor, and the Five Wefts rode the heavens. The Most High, with seven, five, and three riding together, combined thirty-six *qi* to open the ancestral *qi* of the Pale Numinous Heaven’s Origin. Illuminating the Western Floret’s resplendent pale radiance, it corresponds to the inception of the Seven Yangs’ Metallic Thearch—thus the West receives seven *qi* to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Prolonged Prosperity*.

Next, the Nine Causes completed their cycle, chaotic transformation returning to the root. A single *qi* inaugurated luminosity. The Most High, with two and five riding thirteen accumulations of primordial yang, combined thirty *qi* to open the ancestral *qi* of the Northern Mysterious Heaven’s Origin. Illuminating the Dark and Lofty’s supreme radiance, it corresponds to the inception of the One Yang’s Watery Thearch—thus the North receives five *qi* to divide the celestial realm, its kalpa named *Inaugural Thearch*. Thus, with the Five Kalpas complete, the Vast Heaven took form. A single *qi* merged with the Dao, eight realms streamed with light, three accumulations and nine ridings opened radiance in the eight directions. The Eight Thearchs manifested their forms, and the Nine Empyreans diverged in transformation.

Therefore, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to inscribe with the *Jade Calendar* the origins of the Primordial Cavern’s chaotic transformation, the root of kalpic revolutions and cyclical returns, the division of celestial realms, and the congealing of the Cavern’s true yang *qi* into the *Jade Calendar*. Therewith, it records the path of the Heavenly Perfected and Heavenly People’s kalpic merits and ascendant progress, clarifying the nine grades of the Nine Sages.

**Jade Seal-Script of Sixty-Four Characters**
**True Yang’s Inaugural Transformation, Brahmā *Qi* Flowing Unhindered**

Above stands the Golden Portal, eastward lies the Jade Treasury. The five scriptures congeal in splendor, the nine voids scatter radiance—subtle *qi* arises naturally, its profound mysteries unfathomable. The Three Spirits share a single thread, the myriad sages disperse from one source. Those who examine and ascend the highest studies inscribe true merit, their spirits in perfect accord, merging with the Dao as one. Securely enshrined in the Thearch’s Register, it endures for kalpas without end.

**Forty Characters of the Northern Kaihuang Era’s Mysterious High Jade Calendar’s Treasured Chapter**
*Inaugurating the Primordial Yang Heaven’s Primordial Brahmā-Chaos *Qi***
Five *qi* align with primordial wonder, all heavens merge in grand obscurity. Stellar essence soars on feathered *qi*, jade maidens scatter blossoms—azure, purple, and cinnabar seals. Celestial treasures’ mysterious light chills the Thearch’s court, myriad demons revere the supreme transformation. Ten thousand lands are preserved in peace, the five scriptures unfold in vast expanse.

The Master said: In the Crimson Clarity’s unfolding of the Chart, the revolutions proceed by nature; the Primordial Beginning abides in stillness, scattering the five scriptures. Crimson-script jade characters, eight mighty dragon scripts, preserve and regulate the kalpic revolutions, ensuring the heavens endure forever.

This is the Great Brahmā-Ancestral *Qi* of the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy, which transforms and gives birth to jade characters, issuing forth the scripture to deliver humanity. As for *The Central Scripture of the Numinous Book*, being termed "central" at the outset of the unfolding Chart, it is the *qi* of harmonious equilibrium that fuses and forms the scripture. Thus, the Luminous King of Filial Dao presides over it by day. The five *qi* divide and array the five positions, whereupon the five scriptures of crimson-script jade characters scatter forth—hence the Five Elder Thearchs preside over them.

The reason the central scripture is placed at the end is to adopt the meaning of "the head below in the generation of beings." Thus, the Crimson Scripture precedes it, while the true writ and esoteric incantations emerge from ancient books. Later scholars found them difficult to practice, so the Most High inscribed brushstrokes to resolve obscurities, unfolding the subtle and wondrous primordial phrases of the ancient text. The Heavenly Worthies of all heavens intone the jade sounds; the ten directions chant afar. The heavens above establish rites, and gods and demons submit in reverence. Thus, heaven is perfected and earth established, the myriad perfected ones unfurl, spirits are pacified and numina settled, the multitudes of people are born and nurtured, the revolutions of destiny are guided and guarded, and the heavens endure forever.

Above, it governs the celestial mechanisms; in the center, it examines the five numina; below, it commands the earthly registers. It whistles forth the mandate to the River Source, moves and employs yin and yang, summons spirits and dispatches immortals. This is the writ of utmost perfection, wondrously responsive by nature. It causes the heavens to rise in clarity, the earth to stand firm in peace, the Five Marchmounts to be preserved and guarded, and the myriad beings to thrive—truly its efficacy is boundless.

Those who study the immortal arts should, at the beginning of the new year, inscribe in vermilion on yellow silk and wear it when paying homage to the perfected. Then they will command demons and ensure promotion, traverse and shatter barriers, with numinous mysteries beyond measure. If delivering the souls of the deceased below, one should open and burn it during seasonal sacrifices, whereupon all will behold the true light, transform and be born in the realm of celestial immortals, and forever sever the path of rebirth.

### **Rites of Suppression, Subjugation, and Control**
**Method for Employing the Vermilion Writ**

It is said: Whenever employing the Vermilion Writ, one must first submit a petition.

In ancient times, those who cultivated the true used the Five Chapters to suppress, subjugate, and control, or cast them into renowned mountains and cavernous abysses to erase their names from the ledgers of sin and inscribe them upon the Nine Heavens—this is precisely that method.

**For casting petitions:**
When petitioning the Great Thearch of the Water Palace to erase one’s name from the ledgers of sin, use a silverwood tablet inscribed in cinnabar, placed in a blue silk pouch bound with green thread. Affix a golden dragon strip and nine golden knobs, then enclose it in a casket and cast it into the abyss of the Three Rivers.

When petitioning the numinous mountains of the Five Peaks, also use a silverwood tablet inscribed in cinnabar with dragon knobs, following the same method, and bury it upon the peak corresponding to one’s life destiny or in a blessed land or renowned mountain.

When petitioning the Earth Thearch of the Nine Lands, follow the same form and bury it in the central palace of one’s dwelling.

**When casting petitions:**
Kindle the incense burner and invoke the sacred, recite the incantation and cast the petition, then close the burner according to the rite. Place the text in the five directions, and the immortal officials of the Five Peaks will arrive. If one observes a hundred-day fast with unbroken concentrated thought, the celestial perfected will descend. Merely wearing this text upon one’s person also grants liberation through simulated death.

Inscribing it in cinnabar upon five-colored stone will cause calamities to vanish and malevolence to dissolve.

If unable to reach the proper peaks, one may select mountains in the four directions of one’s dwelling to represent the Five Peaks, with the direction of one’s life destiny serving as the life peak. By taking their symbolic forms, one may summon the numinous and manifest the spirit—there is nowhere they will not be present.

Thus, when the Brahma-qi unfolds and radiance emerges, the charts for saving the world are revealed. Without script, there is no illumination; without script, there is no clarity; without script, there is no establishment; without script, there is no completion; without script, there is no salvation; without script, there is no generation. Therefore, the hundred demons conceal their rhymes, and separation and union occur naturally. By employing them to govern affairs, one adapts the script to the matter at hand.

Thus, the secret seal scripts within the Vermilion Writ of Jade Script may all be separated and combined for use.

**Upon completing the inscription of the tablet:**
Inscribe at the top the method, position, name, and the year, month, day, and hour of one’s life destiny. State one’s vows to the spirits and immortals for the Way of eternal life without death.

If petitioning the Water Palace, append the following:
*"The Nine Palace Water Thearchs, the Twelve River Sources, the Jiang, He, Huai, and Ze, the great spirits of Qi and Ling—pray erase my name from the ledgers of sin and report it to the Nine Heavens. Hasten to the Water Thearch’s palace-source, conveyed by golden dragon post."*

The beginning follows the same form, while the end is written separately, noting the year, month, day, and hour of the Grand Year and the location of the petition.

Inscribe the true script upon the tablet, then write the petition text on the yang-facing side, sealing it with the proper method’s seal.

**When casting the petition:**
Face north, knock the teeth three times, and read the petition text. Upon completion, hold the tablet and recite the incantation according to the rite.

**Incantation for Petitioning the Water Palace:**

**When casting a petition to the earth in the central courtyard:**
Face the *ren* direction, knock the teeth twelve times, read the petition, then hold the tablet and recite the incantation according to the rite.

**Incantation for Petitioning the Earth Palace:**
*"Heaven and earth unfold, the nine qi divide their numinosity.
Three Origins’ cavernous palaces, the ten directions solemn and clear.
Five Elder Thearchs, open the true and govern life.
Cinnabar script of Vermilion Writ, Original Beginning’s Supreme Purity.
Universally proclaimed to the world below, the numinous spirits of the Nine Lands.
Today, I make this supplication, the myriad spirits determine life.
My vows to me and my immortals—immediately attain ascension."*

With reverence, present jade and stone to the Earth Palace of the Great Thearch.
Erase transgressions and penalties, submit the petition to the Upper Palace.
Inscribed in the registers of Huaqing, swiftly attain transcendence.
Heaven and earth share numinosity, the nine generations of kin.
Rotten bones renewed in glory, the soul ascends to the Southern Palace,
ascending to the Transcendent’s Transformative Court.
Today, proclaim this decree—may the myriad spirits all heed.
With golden seals, pledge utmost sincerity.
As petitioned, may it be conveyed by golden dragon post.

**Rite for Presenting Petitions to the Sacred Peaks of the Five Marchmounts**
On one’s *benming* day, the *jiazi* day, or the day of *Lichun*, inscribe the eastern vermilion script, beginning with the nine *qi* of the East and concluding with *surging qi to ascend as transcendent*, totaling twenty-four characters.
On the day of *Lixia*, inscribe the southern vermilion script, beginning from the South and concluding with *responding to the Grand Yang*, totaling thirty-two characters.

After nine years, the transcendents’ envoys of the Five Directions will arrive—Green Waist, Vermilion Jade Tablet, Yellow Silk, Supreme Simplicity, and the Jade Maidens of Great Mystery—all manifesting in person.
When presenting the petition, knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious and exalted numinous ones, the revered divinities of the Original Beginning.

After reciting the incantation and reading the tablet, cast it from the summit of a sheer cliff, then scatter incense upon the sacred peak. Knock the teeth twice more and, facing one’s *benming* direction, recite:

*"The Original Beginning oversees and reflects—my transcendent name is inscribed.
The Three Offices and Nine Palaces—transgressions forever erased.
Scatter incense to the Five Thearchs, pledge alliance to the Great Void.
As petitioned, dwell for ten thousand kalpas."*

**Rite for Pacifying the Stellar Lodges and Averting Celestial Calamities**
The vermilion scripts of the Five Directions each govern the summoning of their directional stellar officials, the divisions of celestial patterns, and celestial calamities.
To pacify them, proceed according to the direction and release their influence.
For the East: begin with Jupiter and conclude with *sweeping away calamitous assemblies*, totaling thirty-two characters. Write in vermilion on green paper, expose it in the central courtyard for nine days and nights, then burn it according to the rite. Scatter the ashes amid green smoke and inscribe the text on green stone for burial.
For the South: begin with Mars and conclude with *rectifying the Dao’s courier paths*, totaling thirty-two characters. Write in vermilion on green paper, expose it in the central courtyard for three days and nights, then burn it according to the rite. Inscribe the text on red stone for burial.
For the Center: begin with Saturn and conclude with *golden horse courier transmission*, totaling forty characters. Write in vermilion on green paper, expose it in the central courtyard for twelve days and nights, then burn it according to the rite. Inscribe the text on yellow stone for burial.
For the West: begin with Venus and conclude with *receiving the tally from Northern Primordial*, totaling twenty-four characters. Write in vermilion on green paper, expose it in the central courtyard for seven days and nights, then burn it according to the rite. Inscribe the text on white stone for burial.
For the North: begin with the Northern Asterism and conclude with *illuminating the Dao’s radiant movement*, totaling thirty-two characters. Write in vermilion on green paper, expose it in the central courtyard for five days and nights, then burn it according to the rite. Inscribe the text on black stone for burial.
In all cases, face the southeast, loosen the hair, knock the teeth twelve times, and recite the incantation:

*"The Original Beginning in the heavens above, the Three Luminaries exaltedly bright.
Revolving radiance illumines, the four directions resplendently clear.
Where the celestial revolutions clash, sparks of yang as streaming stars.
The Five Realms in disarray, the Three Flows lose tranquility.
The Five Celestial Dipper governs the stellar lodges, the Seven Mansions numinously bright.
True Lords and Great Constellations—his name-taboo is Jade Essence.
When the Human Thearch arose, his style was Nurturing Infant.
Mastering the Mysterious Pass, revolving the myriad heavens.
Today’s guest calamity—solemnly report the inauspicious.
With reverence, present the true writ, vermilion script to the Upper Ridge.
Loosen the hair to confess transgressions, bare the cinnabar sincerity.
May the Mysterious One deign to inspect, restore the celestial canon.
Qi shall not cross transversely, calamities shall not arise transversely.
Burn the numinous writ, scatter the smoke in the Jade Court.
The Upper Luminaries oversee and illuminate, universally proclaim to the myriad spirits.
The Three Passes’ qi purified, the Nine Perfected’s calamities extinguished.
Yin and yang harmonized, the land at great peace.
With reverence, by golden dragon, swiftly conveyed by courier."*

After reciting the incantation, expose the true writ in the central courtyard, following the respective direction. Seal it with the golden dragon script and burn it on the appointed day. Also, inscribe the text on stone of the directional color and bury it, using lamps for illumination and patterned silk as a token of pacification.

**Rite for Subduing Demons**
Those who receive the superior methods should first subdue demons, that spirit and essence may naturally attain clarity.
For the East: begin with *Eastern Mountain* and conclude with *delaying*, inscribing thirty characters in vermilion on a green wooden tablet.
For the South: begin with *subduing the North* and conclude with *shattering destruction*, inscribing twenty-two characters in yellow on a red wooden tablet.

For the North: begin with *Northern Mountain* and conclude with *annihilating destruction*, inscribing twenty-four characters in white on a black wooden tablet. All incantations are to be recited facing the northeast.

For the East: nine repetitions; for the South: three repetitions; for the Center: twelve repetitions; for the West: seven repetitions; for the North: five repetitions. Each is accompanied by thirty-six strikes of the teeth, nine breaths held in qi, and the incantation recited while looking upward:

The Three Origins unfold clarity,
Revolving the celestial constancy.
As the reckoning of fate reaches its end,
A hundred and six ride the firmament.
At the great kalpa’s convergence,
Myriad demons contend in their courses.
The Northern Deng, unbound,
Wander in reckless pursuit of their origin.
Hordes of demons rise in wantonness,
Wielding perverse light of heaven.
The Thearch issues his decree,
Proclaiming universally to the ten directions.
He expounds the celestial measures,
Unfolding the teachings of the law.
The true Dao governs the people,
Sweeping away all inauspiciousness.
What petty demons dare
Gather in throngs to assemble?
The vermilion script of jade writ
Seizes and subdues the demonic realms.
The Three Officials of Northern Deng
Flee in haste to transmit their lives.
A thousand demons are bound in brilliance,
Ten thousand ghosts surrender their forms.
Flowing bells interweave their radiance,
Stirring the qi of the Great Yang.
Golden tigers patrol the four bounds,
Heavenly soldiers assist in their demise.
Great and small alike arrive,
None may conceal or hide.
What the Primordial Beginning has proclaimed,
Is memorialized and presented on high.

Summoning the Celestial Water Dragons, the Water-Stilling and Water-Crossing Rites

Whenever the great kalpic disasters arise between Heaven and Earth, with floods surging in all four directions, this talisman may be employed to avert and halt them. Alternatively, it may command the dragons to open waterways and forge paths, enabling one to cross safely. If inscribed for the East, begin from "Below Governs" and end at "Unceasing," totaling thirty-two characters. Write in yellow on blue paper and cast it into the water. If inscribed for the South, begin from "Southern River" and end at "Not Following," totaling forty-eight characters. For the Center, begin from "Central Mountain" and end at "Universally Heard," totaling forty-eight characters. For the West, begin from "Western Mountain" and end at "Postal Relay," totaling forty-eight characters. For the North, begin from "Nine Rivers" and end at "Wind-Driven," totaling twenty-four characters. Follow the prescribed method in each case.

At the time of use, knock the teeth five times, hold the breath for twenty-five cycles, and visualize a fire arising from the heart within the body, ascending through the crown to burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and even one’s own form in the four directions into ashes. All transforms into a single soaring path, entering the realm above the azure smoke, leaving nothing behind. Envision the great waters surging and sweeping across the world, while one’s own body metamorphoses into a dragon, flowing with the current.

Then knock the teeth twenty-five times and recite the incantation:

The Primordial Beginning revolves the numinous,
Illuminating the Nine Origins.
Heaven turns and Earth shifts,
The Three Qi circulate in transmission.
The Five Phases press upon one another,
Operating the mechanisms of kalpic measure.
Yin and Yang clash in opposition,
Forming calamitous collisions.
When the great kalpa reaches its end,
The demonic vapors are swept away.
The Nine Rivers receive their counterparts,
Mighty torrents surge through the streams.
The Water Mother lingers,
Birds and crows gather in flocks.
Sun and Moon meet in darkness,
The Three Luminaries halt their gates.
The chosen seed of the Upper Realm—
I, your servant, array the jade script of the dragons.
Abandoning evil and esteeming goodness,
The clear and turbid are forever divided.
I am bound to the Thearch’s decree,
My name inscribed in the Nine Heavens.
When the four great disasters converge,
The vermilion script subdues them.
On this day, the mandate is proclaimed,
All spirits hear it in unison.
Sun, Moon, and Five Planets
Illuminate my soul.
The numinous mountains of the Five Peaks
Float and ferry my body.
O Primordial River Water Bureau,
Great Spirits of the Qi-Ling,
Open and clear the waterways,
Unblock and ease the river fords.
Dragons reflect the talisman,
Seizing mountains and dispatching clouds.
Bear me, ferry me,
Swiftly racing in the four directions.
Vermilion script and crimson characters,
The true writ of the Primordial Beginning.
The golden dragon’s postal route
Proceeds without delay.
Swiftly submit and present it,
Ascending to report before the Thearch.

Upon completing the incantation, draw in the qi twenty-five times and swallow it. In an instant, water spirits will open the path—if in the mountains, the mountains will float; if in the water, the waters will part of their own accord. Thus, one may encounter peril and yet deliver oneself in the blink of an eye.

When commanderies and states suffer from flood disasters, one may also establish a fast, concentrate the mind, and perform this rite. At the beginning of the kalpas, the Heavenly Worthy, through the operation of the primordial qi and true essence, transformed and gave birth to the numinous script to regulate the kalpic cycles, protect the state, and pacify the people. Those with good karmic affinities from past lives may encounter this scripture. The people of antiquity were simple and honest, embracing simplicity and merging with the Dao. Without observing fasts or precepts, they performed the rite and received immediate response. In this degenerate age, human hearts are scattered and corrupted; few uphold the orthodox, while many deviate from the true. To practice this method, one must follow the writ of the Three Origins, establish a fast, perform the Dao, concentrate the mind, and inwardly align with the sagely ones to achieve resonance. Otherwise, demonic trials may interfere, rendering the effort futile.

Select those of purity and integrity, retreat to a place free from worldly dust, and perform the rite at famous mountains and numinous sites to seek communion and response. Thus may the great Dao’s compassion in salvation and deliverance, the Most High’s grace in rescuing beings, be made manifest. Those who propagate transformation, take heed!

The Numinous Writ of the Thirty-Two Heavens

The Master said: The thirty-two celestial jade characters are the qi of the Great Brahma’s cloud-seal, forming script in the void. They constitute the *Central Chapter of the Numinous Writ* of the Primordial Beginning, the esoteric language of the Great Brahma. The Great Brahma is the Heaven within Heavens. The esoteric language is the secret sound of the heavens. Beginning with the Heaven of Grand Tenuity, each heaven comprises eight characters, all concealing the true names of the hidden and numinous. Now, transgressing the prohibitions, I shall briefly reveal their mysteries: for instance, "Guanyin" is the inner name of the Heaven of Imperial Splendor; "Wuhe" is the name of the gate through which the Sun and Moon enter and exit; "Yuanzhen" is the name of the Lords of the Northern and Southern Dippers; "Dongfu" is the name of the Red Thearch; "Kuoyi" is the name of the Divine Duke, the Northern Thearch; "Tuoluo" is the name of the two youths within the Dipper; "Xuyuan" is the name of the two youths of the Sun and Moon; "Ling" is the name of the Elder Han; "Miaomang" is the inner name of the Ghost Thearch of the Northern Heaven. The remaining names belong to the Thearchs and Divine Kings of the thirty-two heavens. These are the secret instructions bestowed by the Most High Lord of the Jade Dawn upon the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the subtleties of cultivation.

Thus, following the sixty-four hexagrams, the phrases are composed to correspond to the number of the Central Yellow. Practitioners should choose a day when fire flourishes in the bing and ding stems, face the southeast, set up an incense table, bow twice, and inscribe the writ on yellow silk. Whether enshrined or worn, it will cause the myriad spirits to tremble and submit, summoning and gathering the true primordial qi to harmonize the Three Fields. Furthermore, on one’s own fate day, the gengshen day, the jiazi day, the eight solar terms, or the auspicious day of the Grand Year Star, ingesting it will summon the true and evoke the numinous, daily generating the light of wisdom and spirit. The hundred spirits will respond in brilliance, and the flying immortals will ascend to the Great Void. Ten thousand disasters will not intrude, and divine spirits will provide protection, enabling one to command and dispatch them, to attend audiences and pay homage. Truly, there is nothing it does not repel, nothing it does not avert.

For averting, enshrining, and delivering the living and the dead, inscribe in vermilion on blue silk and place it in the five directions, then inscribe a comprehensive version on yellow silk and place it in the center. On the day of dispersing the altar, place the five-directional talismans in the five directions and burn them in the azure smoke, allowing the wind to scatter them in the ten directions. Thus, whatever is summoned or treated will unfailingly respond—this is the boundless sound of the Great Brahma.

First, one must memorialize the Three Heavens, requesting the descent of the inner recitation of the cavernous chapters. Employ them according to the matter at hand, and the mysterious resonance will immediately manifest.

The Jade Scripts of the Eight Heavens of the Eastern Direction
Each phrase aligns with one hexagram: Yu, Sui, Gu, Lin, Guan, Shi, Ke, Ben, Bo, Fu, Wuwang, Daxu, Yi, Daguo, Kan, and Li—sixteen hexagrams in all.

The Jade Scripts of the Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction
Each phrase aligns with one hexagram: Weiji, Qian, Kun, Zhun, Meng, Xu, Song, Shi, Bi, Xiaoxu, Lü, Tai, Pi, Tongren, Dayou, and Qian—sixteen hexagrams in all. When inscribing, invoke the *Zi* script, draw the qi of the Eight Heavens of the Northern Direction, face north, and recite the incantation:
*"Yuanhuang bao yao, yan ling yu dan, bo sang jing yu, yu chen zong xuan, dong miao zong ming she."*

**Gate of Subjugation and Averting Calamities**

**Chapter of the Great Brahmā True Sound**
The Master said: The Great Brahmā True Sound is formed from the primordial spontaneous flying-wheel qi of the Originator. Those who recite it may subdue the myriad spirits and deliver beings from the Five Sufferings. The adept who performs this ritual on a *bing*-day of the sixth celestial stem should face east, write in cinnabar on yellow silk, and wear it upon the body. Thus may they restrain the demon Wei and dispel the ten thousand calamities. At that time, visualize oneself as the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure, form the Mudrā of Supreme Purity, and draw the primordial ancestral qi into the brush to inscribe it.

**Seal-Script Secret Incantation**
Wheel of the Originator, knit into Brahmā’s net.
Spontaneously numinous and wondrous, without beginning or end.
Profound and boundless, the Way’s vast plan—seize and scatter its loftiness.
Luminous and distant, the spirits’ clarity—peaks and paths attain wisdom.
Transcend the limitless.
Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Ordinance of the First Precepts of Numinous Treasure!

The *Liujin Yanyu Fengqi Longwen* Register: One Hundred Sixty Writings

The Master said: The writings of *Longwen* and *Fengqi* are all texts of the *Three Heavens’ Jade-Flowing Gold*, which may be assembled into talismans or gathered into characters. Once they govern the ranks of the Perfected, no affair remains unexamined. Incantations and talismans are thus inscribed, yet they must not be casually diverted to other uses. The Three Officials oversee scrutiny, and any matter equates to disclosure—Heaven’s prohibition guards them in secrecy.

*Pentad Peak Mountains’ True Forms Diagram*

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate states: The *Original Beginning’s Forbidden Writ* says: "In all transmissions of the essential marrow of the Numinous Treasure and the Numinous Void, one must recognize the forms of the Five Marchmounts. Without this knowledge, the study of the Dao will yield no accomplishment, one cannot aspire to transcendence, the hun-soul and spirit will sink into obscurity, and the supreme Dao will be difficult to attain. Those who study the Dao should diagram these forms and place them in a purified chamber, so that demonic trials do not arise, the myriad ghosts vanish without trace, and the hidden depths open to prosperity. This text is recorded in the ritual registers to rectify the celestial and terrestrial divisions of humankind."

The Master says: "The black represents the mountain forms. The red marks the sources of waters. The yellow dots are the mouths of grotto-heavens. When drawn small, they depict hills and minor ridges; when rendered as caverns, they show the ancestral forms of peaks and valleys—thus height and depth follow the natural contours, while length and brevity capture their likeness. Households possessing this diagram will also have virtuous guardians, and malevolent ghosts and calamities will self-destruct. If a superior adept wears it, the ten thousand spirits will come to pay homage."

The Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai, spans two thousand *li* in circumference, lying within the borders of Langye, and commands ninety thousand transcendents. The Southern Marchmount, Mount Heng, spans two thousand *li* in circumference, situated east of the Changsha border, and commands seven thousand seven hundred transcendents. The Central Marchmount, Mount Song, spans one thousand *li* in circumference, lying within the Luoyang border, and commands thirty thousand divine youths and transcendence maidens. The Western Marchmount, Mount Hua, spans four thousand *li* in circumference, elongated from north to south, situated east of the Changping border, and commands seven thousand transcendents and jade maidens. The Northern Marchmount, Mount Heng, spans three thousand *li* in circumference, lying within the Changzhou border, and commands twenty thousand transcendence youths and jade maidens.

The veins of mountains and the courses of springs, their sources and flows, were once transmitted by the Queen Mother of the West to Emperor Wu of Han, who passed them on as forbidden restrictions. Their regulations are solemn and weighty—this must not be lightly divulged.

The True Forms of the Five Marchmounts:
The Eastern Marchmount, Numinous Might Ascending...

The Western Marchmount, White Beckoning Rule;
The Southern Marchmount, Crimson Blazing Wrath;
The Northern Marchmount, Leaf of Radiant Record;
The Central Marchmount, Axis of Containment.

The True Forms of the Lesser Five Marchmounts:
The True Form of the Eastern Marchmount, Mount Tai;
The True Form of the Western Marchmount, Mount Hua;
The True Form of the Southern Marchmount, Mount Heng;
The True Form of the Northern Marchmount, Mount Heng;
The True Form of the Central Marchmount, Mount Song;
The True Form of Mount Fengdu.

According to the *Yuan Shi Liu Tian Zhi Mo Jing* (*Scripture of the Primordial Beginning on the Six Heavens’ System of Demon Regulation*), those who transmit the Dao of Supreme Clarity’s Great Cavern, as well as the essentials of the Three Caverns and the Three Perfected Great Methods, yet remain ignorant of the True Form of Mount Fengdu, will find their seven ancestors unable to forever depart the offices of ghostly bureaucracy, nor their corpse-blood cleansed of defilement at the Gate of the Womb.

It is further stated: The Jade Registers of the Six Heavens are to be inscribed upon stone and placed within the palace foundations of the Mysterious Hall Terrace, where suffering souls receive deliverance in the Vermilion Numinosity. When scholars carry these upon their person or place them within their oratory chambers, the ten thousand ghosts vanish without trace, and the dark nether realms open to peace.

This scripture is preserved in the Northern Watchtower of Supreme Clarity, serving to rectify the divisions of the Six Heavens’ axis. When delivering the deceased, one may inscribe the True Form in cinnabar, write the proclamation in ink along with the deceased’s name, then burn and scatter the ashes to the wind. Thereupon, the Northern Emperor shall unbind them, the Three Officials release their knots, and they ascend to the Northern Hall.

**Incantation for Burning Ashes to Deliver the Deceased:**
By the Talismanic Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, demons are regulated and obey.
The deceased soul is safeguarded and recommended, delivered to the Southern Palace for ranking.
The embers of Mount Fengdu disperse; the Three Officials release the form.
Scattered are the bonds of karmic closure; transformation and rebirth are received.
Refined and delivered according to rank, they ascend to the Court of Blessings.

Upon reciting this incantation, press the tongue against the upper palate, visualize the self as the Primordial Beginning, silently intone the hidden words once, and imagine golden light filling the mouth. With both hands forming the Jade Clarity mudra, blow toward the northeast, then release the mudra. The soul shall immediately ascend to the Vermilion Palace, undergo refinement according to rank, and return reborn to the Court of Blessings.

**True Form Diagram of Mount Fengdu**

**Proclamation for Delivering the Deceased:**
Herewith bestowed upon the deceased [Name], to be treasured as a personal talisman forever.
It is humbly hoped that upon reverent reception, the suffering soul shall receive deliverance, be recorded in the Vermilion Numinosity, and all proceed as commanded, transmitted by wind and fire couriers.

**Twelve Dao Pronouncements and Seven Qi Talismans**

Transmitted by the Recondite Eminence, Illuminator and Savior of Suffering Perfected Lord Ning Quanzhen to Lingbao Preceptor Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity

**Section on Scripture Verses and Talismanic Script**

**The Twelve Dao Pronouncements and Seven Qi Talismans**

The Master said: The *Dao Pronouncements* are the decrees of the Primordial Beginning and the foremost among all scriptures. Their twelve divisions correspond to the months of the year, capable of curing myriad illnesses, assembling a thousand spirits, and summoning harmonious qi into the field of the body.

**First Dao Pronouncement:**
Once, in the Azure Heaven of the Beginning, amidst the celestial hymns of the Azure Vault, upon the Great Floating Li Earth, the middle finger inscribed the central script. Inhaling the Yellow Qi of the Center into the mouth, it connected with the qi of the Three Fields, pouring and coalescing into form.

**Second Dao Pronouncement:**
At that time, the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy recited the scripture once, and the boundless, immeasurable hosts of the Perfected Great Spirits of the Eastern Direction—innumerable as the floating clouds—arrived from the void. Pressing the mudra of the Ten Directions, one may subdue fierce demons.

**Third Dao Pronouncement:**
All that the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy uttered in the scripture are the inner names of the Celestial Emperors of the various heavens, the hidden rhymes of their sounds, as well as the secret taboos of demon kings and the concealed names of the hundred spirits. Inscribe the *Zi* script, writing the talismanic names of the heavens, and employ them in esoteric incantations.

**Fourth Dao Pronouncement:**
Upon reciting this scripture ten times, all the heavens shall arrive. Pressing the middle finger, summon the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings and Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions for deliverance and other purposes.

**Fifth Dao Pronouncement:**
In the first month, maintain a prolonged fast and chant this scripture. Pressing the middle finger, when reciting the scripture, first ingest the qi accordingly.

**Sixth Dao Pronouncement:**
On the day of performing the Dao rituals, pressing the middle finger, ascend the altar, pay homage, and employ them for curing illness, subduing demons, and wearing as talismans.

**Seventh Dao Pronouncement:**
These two chapters are the esoteric sounds of the Celestial Emperors and the concealed utterances of the demon kings. Pressing the four fingers upward, when inscribing jade characters, first ingest the qi.

**Eighth Dao Pronouncement:**
As the revolutions of heaven and earth extend to universal deliverance without end, press the thumb in the center. Employ them according to the scriptural verses as needed.

**Ninth Dao Pronouncement:**
Though the study of the Dao be shallow, one may yet attain immortality. Pressing the middle finger, wear them when entering or exiting, and the myriad demons shall not dare to intrude.

**Tenth Dao Pronouncement:**
When the revolutions of heaven and earth reach their end, universal deliverance shall extend to heaven and humanity. Pressing the mudra of *zi*, *wu*, and *wei*, one may avert calamities, dispel misfortunes, and safeguard life.

**Eleventh Dao Pronouncement:**
Whoever possesses this scripture shall attain the utmost clarity and profundity. Pressing the middle finger, one may summon the great demons of the Three Realms and ensure promotion to immortality.

**Twelfth Dao Pronouncement:**
These are the great Brahmanic esoteric utterances of the heavens, the boundless sounds. At the hours of *yin*, *shen*, *si*, and *hai*, they may be used to transmit memorials to the heavens. Wearing them enables one to traverse the fierce winds and vast qi, entering directly into the Celestial Pass.

Inscribe the four characters in vermilion on yellow paper to subdue ghosts, avert earthly misfortunes, and absorb the Lingbao qi. One breath inscribes them, and twelve breaths complete the talisman.

Inscribe the four characters in vermilion on yellow paper. Wearing them assembles the myriad spirits, subdues dragons and tigers, averts earthly misfortunes, and pacifies inauspicious dwellings. One breath and six strokes complete it.

**Talisman of the Two Characters "Primordial Beginning"**

The Master said: *Primordial Beginning* is the honorific title of the Heavenly Worthy. There are twelve titles. What are they? The reason is that Lord Lao manifested in twelve transformations, and the Primordial Beginning likewise manifested in twelve transformations. Thus, the twelve qi of the center correspond to the Primordial Beginning’s deliverance of humanity. They may be employed according to the scriptural verses to aid the living, deliver the dead, and follow the mudras of the Celestial Emperors.

1. Primordial Beginning delivers the boundless, supreme grade of humanity.
2. The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy is about to expound this scripture.
3. The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy recites the scripture once.
4. The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy sits suspended in the empty void.
5. The Primordial Beginning suspends a precious pearl.

*Highest Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Law*, Scroll Nineteen.

The Cavernous Subtlety Perfected Master, Illuminating Light and Deliverance-from-Suffering True Person Ning Quanzhen transmitted to the Highest Clarity Three Caverns Disciple, Numinous Treasure Preceptor and Lineage Master Wang Qizhen, who compiled:

**Scripture, Verse, Talisman, and Book Section**

**Lofty**
**Highest Clarity**
**Numinous and Radiant**
**Compassionate Song Resounding in the Great Void**

I only wish for the Dao of immortality to be fulfilled,
Not for the human path to prevail.

In the Northern Capital’s Yellow Springs and Crooked Bureau,
Amidst the myriad ghostly throngs,
They seek only to cut short human fate,
To sever the gate of human life.

Ah, the people chant the Cavernous Chapter,
To subdue the Northern Fengdu,
To bind and dispatch demonic spirits,
To behead the six ghostly legions with the blade’s edge.

The qi of all heavens surges and billows,
While my Dao daily ascends in glory.

The above seventy characters possess the power to expel malevolent spirits and deliver from calamity. Whenever a household suffers persistent harm from violent or pernicious forces that resist repeated exorcisms, take one *you*-day talisman, inscribe it in cinnabar upon a sheet of yellow paper as written here, or draft a **Memorial to the Ten Directions’ Divine Kings**, attaching this talisman to its front. Submit the memorial in tandem to the sacred peaks and waterways, entrusting it to the solemn rites of temple altars, city gods, marshals, and scribes, who shall jointly apprehend and transmit the decree, adjusting the severity of the dispatch as warranted. If the affliction concerns kin or ancestral ties, or involves those who seek retribution against the household, exercise further discretion—this method must not be employed lightly.

**Memorial to the Divine Kings (Format):**
From the **Bureau of Numinous Treasure Great Rites**, to the **Flying Heavenly Divine King of [such-and-such] Direction**, together with all subordinate officers and soldiers:

Upon reviewing the submitted petition and verifying the circumstances, it is confirmed that a malevolent spirit below has wrought harm. Having already memorialized the Supreme Emperor and issued the sacred writ, we now dispatch this urgent decree.

Upon receipt, immediately mobilize the celestial troops under your command and descend in full force. Proceed directly to the site of the disturbance, seize the treasonous and un-Dao-like malefactor causing harm below, and without regard to rank or station, escort them to the Heavenly Prison to be punished according to celestial law. Thus shall the imperial subjects enjoy peace, and the Dao and its methods flourish.

This decree is to be executed with utmost haste.

**Respectful Memorial.**

To the right: **Eastern Direction** – **Azure Emperor’s** Guardians of the Celestial Patterns, nine in number. Inscribed in azure on black.
To the right: **Southern Direction** – **Vermilion Emperor’s** Guardians of the Celestial Patterns, three in number. Inscribed in cinnabar on azure.
To the right: **Western Direction** – **White Emperor’s** Guardians of the Celestial Patterns, seven in number. Inscribed in white on yellow.
To the right: **Northern Direction** – **Black Emperor’s** Guardians of the Celestial Patterns, five in number. Inscribed in black on white.
To the right: **Central Direction** – **Yellow Emperor’s** Guardians of the Celestial Patterns, twelve in number. Inscribed in yellow on vermilion.

The five talismans above are to be placed within the nine-jointed **Divine Penetration Staff**.

**Daily Duty Celestial Officers**, thirty-two each day:
- **Eastern Direction** (nine *qi*): Celestial Pattern Officers, Flying Celestial Memorial Officers, Transmitting Speech Memorial Officers, Flying Dragon Mount Officers.
- **Southern Direction** (three *qi*): Celestial Pattern Officers, Flying Celestial Memorial Officers, Transmitting Speech Memorial Officers, Flying Dragon Mount Officers.
- **Western Direction** (seven *qi*): Celestial Pattern Officers, Flying Celestial Memorial Officers, Transmitting Speech Memorial Officers, Flying Dragon Mount Officers.
- **Northern Direction** (five *qi*): Celestial Pattern Officers, Flying Celestial Memorial Officers, Transmitting Speech Memorial Officers, Flying Dragon Mount Officers.

The above officers descend in accordance with the duty day. For example, on the day of **Taihuang Huangzeng Heaven**, the *hai* day is used. If the branch is summoned first, the stem is employed; if the stem is summoned first, the branch is used instead.

The Master states: The twenty-eight constellations may also be used to summon officers on duty days. For major affairs, a single **Brahmā Heaven** is employed together.

This refers to: **Eastern Direction** (nine *qi*), **Southern Direction** (three *qi*), **Western Direction** (seven *qi*), **Northern Direction** (five *qi*), and the four corners (one *qi* each).

The Master states: The **Flying Celestial Divine Kings** of the ten directions possess the greatest majesty and virtue, their sagely transformation beyond measure. At the dawn of the **Red Clarity Kalpa**, within the **Floating Black Realm**, on the day of unfolding charts and reviewing records, they received the august command of the **Primordial Originator** to oversee all registers of the three realms and ten directions, assessing transgressions and blessings, recording merits and faults, measuring ranks, and classifying beings. Each is attended by officers and soldiers. Whenever one approaches the origin, the Divine Kings open the path and lead the way. For major affairs, the Divine Kings are summoned; for minor matters, only their envoys suffice.

Disciples who revere and honor them may, when aiding the living or delivering the dead, dispatch Flying Celestial Envoys and officers to memorialize the Divine Kings and request salvation. Inscribe their names in vermilion, annotate the matter below, wear or burn the talisman for protection—all shall receive divine response. The methods of summoning and wearing are detailed in secret instructions. Each summoning follows a duty day: from the first to the tenth day, each direction is assigned one day; on the eleventh day, the cycle repeats as before. The sequence begins with the **Eastern Direction** on the first day, proceeding in order. If the month has only twenty-nine days, the final day combines the upper and lower directions. The following month begins anew.

Choose an auspicious day to craft a **Nine Palaces Plate** from ancient maple wood, six inches square, inscribed with the **Nine Palaces** and **Eight Trigrams**. Position the upper and lower directions at the central palace, painted with three plain colors, and arrange accordingly. Carve **Divine King Position Tablets** from wood, one inch in size. Beginning on the first day, summon the Divine King of the day’s duty. For any deliverance, inscribe the matter in vermilion, cast it toward the direction of the duty day, and the response shall arrive instantly. Thus, there is nothing that cannot be governed, nothing that cannot be subdued, no summons that goes unanswered, and no deliverance that fails.

the Twelve River Sources.
Release the ancestors,

swiftly erase their ledgers of transgressions,
extinguish their roots of evil,
lest they be detained or coerced into ghostly throngs.
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command,

deliver them to the Southern Palace for refinement.

transforming into immortals.
Those who receive deliverance in life
shall endure through kalpas.
Through kalpas they transmigrate,
their years equaling Heaven’s.
Forever delivered from the Three Ways, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties,
they transcend the Three Realms,
roaming carefree in the Supreme Clarity.

Recite this incantation with the Jade Clarity mudra and eastern qi.

**Incantation for Pacifying the Earth When Building a Dwelling**
For seven days and nights,
the sun, moon, and starry hosts of all heavens,
the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance,
halt their revolutions in unison.
Divine winds fall silent,
mountains and seas conceal their clouds.
Heaven is free of drifting veils,
the four qi shine clear and bright.
A nation’s lands, mountains, rivers, forests, and trees
are leveled as one,
no longer high or low.
The earth becomes azure jade,
uniform in color,
with all perfected ones in attendance.

Recite these fifteen lines whenever moving earth.
Step the *ding* *Gang* seven times,
take a handful of earth from the prosperous direction,
face north, form the Jade Clarity mudra,
chant seven times,
draw in the northwest qi and blow upon the earth,
then place it at the construction site as an offering.
Afterward, mix it with water and apply it to the central courtyard—
all myriad slayings and thousand monstrosities shall retreat.

If a household suffers from earth-related disturbances and restlessness, follow the method to consecrate earth, mix it with water, and sprinkle it throughout the home.

**Yuandong Incantation for Water**
Water of the Yuandong Jade Calendar,
Dragon Han’s Yan Kang era.
In the boundless kalpas,
amidst primordial chaos—
above, no returning hues;
below, no returning abyss.
Wind and marsh pierce the void,
Vajra ascends the heavens.
Between heaven above and heaven below,
no darkness, no obscurity,
no form, no shadow,
no limit, no end.
The vast expanse of the Great Brahma,
boundless and lightless.
When the Crimson Clarity unfurled its chart,
the cosmos moved by its own nature.

These sixteen lines: draw flowing water from the east and place it in a vessel. Visualize the Divine as the Numinous Treasure Perfected, the Three Clarities dwelling within the Three Fields, the sun to the left and moon to the right, the Five Stars stationed in the five directions, the Five Emperors attending the water, the Five Stars and sun and moon casting their radiance into the water, the Five Numinous Spirits guarding the water, Jade Lads and Jade Maidens standing to either side. Point the Dipper’s Handle at the water, then knock the teeth thirty-two times and chant the incantation thirty-two times. Draw the qi of the five directions into the water—even if stored through the height of summer, it will remain free of insects or filth. For treating illness, it may be used to swallow talismans, or to cook congee or decoct medicine. When epidemics spread, consecrate this water and sprinkle it with a willow branch throughout the area—the pestilential toxins will disperse, and recovery will be swift.

Severing a thousand thousand heads,
shearing ten thousand ten thousand forms.

inspect the ghostly encampments.
No refuge shall be granted,
the Golden Horse relays the decree.
Proclaimed without end,
all spirits heed the summons.
The Three Realms and Five Emperors,
in ranks, report to the Upper Clarity.

**Method:** Form the Jade Clarity mudra. For all talismans used to treat the body’s malevolent qi, employ the qi of the north to govern it.

**Incantation for Dispersing Qi**
Within the true resides the divine,
the Great Lord of Longevity.
The Lord of Wu Ying,
the Venerable White Prime.
The Great One, Controller of Destiny,
Peach and Plum unite in extension.
Holding talismans and grasping records,
they safeguard life and root its essence.
Ascending to the Upper Clarity,
entering and exiting the Flowery Chamber.
Within the Eight Obscurities,
in the subtlest of realms.
Below, they guard the human body,
the Muddy Pellet and Crimson Palace.
Within, they harmonize the five qi,
uniting the hundred spirits.
Ten revolutions restore the numinous,

These eighteen lines: Form the Jade Clarity mudra, knock the teeth three times, chant the incantation three times, blow the northern qi upon the afflicted body, then inhale the qi and rub the painful area—peace will be restored.

**Incantation for Harmonizing All Matters**
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
naturally attain the true.

**Method:** For all harmonizations, hold water and face north, chant the incantation seven times, then blow the southern qi upon the water. Recite the matter in your heart seven times, spray toward the direction, and harmony will be achieved.

**Incantation for Treating Eye Ailments**
All heavens’ sun, moon, and starry hosts,
the revolving jade mechanism halts in unison.
Divine winds fall silent,
mountains and seas conceal their clouds.
Heaven is free of drifting veils,
the four qi shine clear and bright.

These seven lines: Take a piece of pure earth, face southeast, chant the incantation nine times, blow upon the earth, and use the consecrated water to wash the eyes—redness will immediately subside. For all eye ailments, use talismanic water.

**Incantation for Treating Epidemics**
Expel the demonic essences,
sever the heads of the Six Ghostly Blades.
The qi of all heavens surges,
my Dao daily ascends in glory.

These four lines: When entering a plague-stricken household to treat illness, use this to consecrate water and disperse qi.

**Incantation for Millet**
Thus did the Primordial Beginning suspend a precious pearl,
as large as a grain of millet,
within the empty mystery,
five measures above the earth.
The Primordial Beginning ascended and guided
the Heavenly Perfected, Great Spirits,
the Most High and Venerable,
the Perfected of Wondrous Conduct,
the boundless and utmost true Great Spirits of the ten directions,
countless multitudes,
all entering the pearl.
Heavenly beings gazed upward—
they saw only a shimmering haze,
entering through the pearl’s mouth,
and once inside, knew not where they were.
The people of the land dispersed,
the earth returned to levelness,
no longer slanted or sunken.
Within the pearl,
the Primordial Beginning expounded the complete scripture.
The Perfected oversaw the deliverance,
bestowing it upon me.
At that moment,
joy and celebration were beyond words.
The ritual matters were roughly complete,
the myriad heavens resumed their positions,
and in an instant,
all was silent, without lingering echo.
At that time, the heavenly beings who encountered the scriptural Dharma
were universally delivered,
preserving their allotted years,
free from harm.
The lands turned in reverence,
all embraced virtuous hearts—
no killing, no harm,
no envy, no jealousy,
no lewdness, no theft,
no greed, no desire,
no hatred, no resentment.
Words were free of embellishment,
speech free of evil sounds.
United in compassion and love,
even those of different bones became kin.
The land was at peace, the people prosperous,
rejoicing in great tranquility.
When the scripture first emerged as teaching,
a nation followed the Dao.
Those who held sincere devotion,
honored and revered it,
all attained deliverance across the ages.

**Method:** Hold red millet in the left hand, regardless of quantity. Form the Jade Clarity mudra with the right hand. Beginning with the east and proceeding to the lower direction, chant the incantation ten times for each direction. Visualize the Heavenly Perfected and Great Spirits of each direction, the Flying Heavenly Spirits and Divine Kings, a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, all entering the millet. Chant a total of one hundred times for the ten directions. Draw the northwest qi and blow it upon the millet to treat all illnesses.

**Incantation for Numinous Treasure Water**
Heavenly Perfected, Heavenly Ford,
numinous essence, divine clarity.
Chant once to sever ghosts,
forever banish demonic essences.

The Celestial Stem’s true qi,
slays and exterminates perverse pestilence.
The water of true yang,
forever banishes ten thousand leagues away.

**Method:** With the left hand, form the Invocation mudra and hold the water. With the right hand, form the Jade Clarity mudra and point at the water. First chant the preceding incantation seven times, then chant the following incantation three times. Draw the southeast qi into the water, then trace the mudra within the water. Divine officials will attend the water as it flows.

**Numinous Treasure Needle**
Use a divine peach branch, five inches long, as the needle. Form the Jade Clarity mudra and blow the qi of the five directions upon the needle. Insert the needle into the afflicted area, then instruct the patient to inhale three times and cough three times before withdrawing the needle.

**Recitation of the Numinous Writ**
For all major matters of healing, visualize the body as the Primordial Beginning, seated upon a five-colored lion. Further visualize within the crown the Primordial Beginning, golden countenance and jade visage. Then, with the left hand form the Jade Clarity mudra and with the right the Upper Clarity mudra. Silently recite without regard to the number of repetitions. Draw the southeast qi and blow it into all talismanic water, using it as desired.

For all talismans, aside from their specific incantations, employ this invocation. From the main scripture, various incantations are briefly extracted. For all talismans, use their respective incantations and mudras, or employ specialized incense invocations as needed. Upon completion, recite the middle section while forming the Jade Clarity mudra. First draw the southeast qi and blow it, then recite the Great Jade Clarity Incantation and draw the northwest qi to blow it.

**Incantation:**
The thirty-two heavens,
the thirty-two emperors.

The myriad heavens conceal their secrets,
the myriad heavens veil their names.
Within the heavens, emptiness and cavernous void,
the spontaneous numinous scripture.
The myriad heavens conceal their tones,

the honor within the heavens,
the spirits within the heavens,
the great demons within the heavens,
the numina within the heavens.
Nine harmonies and ten unions,
transforming into the Upper Clarity.

profound and unfathomable.
Dispersing and descending, the divine perfected,

Today, joyously celebrating the reception of deliverance,
passing through the gates of the myriad heavens,
entreat the eradication of the three evils,
severing the roots of the earthly realm,

names recorded in the Great Mystery.
The Demon Kings oversee and raise,

Hurling fire for ten thousand leagues,
streaming bells to the eight directions.
Dare any obstruct or resist the perfected?
Golden axes execute in advance,

wind and fire never cease.

The Three Realms and Five Thearchs,
declare to the Upper Clarity.

*Concluding the Twenty-Third Scroll of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Upper Clarity*
*Beginning the Twenty-Fourth Scroll of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of the Upper Clarity*

The Illuminating and Merciful Perfected Lord Ning Quanzhen of the Cavernous Subtlety, Initiate of the Three Caverns of the Upper Clarity, bestows upon the Numinous Treasure Lineage Master Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Dao

*Section on Ritual Recitation and Invocatory Procedures*

The scripture states: The sagely perfected who have attained the status of Perfected Ones penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle. This passage is not for recitation by ordinary worldly persons. Those who penetrate the mysterious and fathom the subtle, fully grasping its chapters, shall obtain the ten grades of merit and virtue.

For the most devoted scholars—those who recite and attain mastery—six grades of merit and virtue are conferred. For scholars of the worldly path who recite, three grades of merit and virtue are granted.

In reverent offering and solemn veneration, all scholars who perform these meritorious deeds shall obtain the five grades of blessed reward.

For those who recite this scripture—even the already perfected—it is said that the natural karmic retribution of merit and virtue shall deliver ten thousand generations of suffering ancestors, ascending them to the Vermilion Palace, where they shall be ranked according to the standards of the Vermilion Mound. After nine years, they shall be reborn, transformed, and attain noble status. When the merit of one’s own person is fulfilled, they shall ascend to the Golden Towers of the Upper Clarity and wander in revelry through the Jade Capital.

As for those who have merely attained learning, they may only deliver themselves, ascending to the Southern Palace, yet their merit cannot extend to their ancestors.

For worldly persons who recite, they may only prolong their lives and achieve liberation through the dissolution of the corpse, returning their form to the Great Void. They shall not attain the blessing of ascending to the Vermilion Mound, nor shall their ancestors be reborn and transformed.

The Song of the Demon Kings—recited a hundred times, one ascends to the Southern Palace; a thousand times, the Demon Kings come to escort; ten thousand times, one ascends to the Great Void. These are the hymns of the Three Realms, not mere refined texts.

Those who hear the numinous sound—whose hearts and forms return to faith, listening sincerely to the recitation—shall obtain the nine grades of blessed reward.

Those who perform these meritorious deeds—who resolve to conduct purification rites, burn incense, and recite the scriptures—shall obtain the three grades of blessed reward.

For the most devoted scholars who perform these meritorious deeds, they shall assuredly attain the status of ministers to the Later Sagely Thearchs of the Upper Clarity in the Golden Towers.

Those who comprehend its sound—the middle section—shall, by equalizing the power of its words, obtain the eight grades of blessed reward.

This sound—the sound of the middle section—possesses the four immeasurable and majestic spiritual powers of exorcism, deliverance, and perfection. Those who recite it shall obtain sixteen grades of auspicious response.

To pledge with golden treasures and a sincere heart, swearing an oath to Heaven, transmission follows the Twofold Dependence upon the Mysterious Regulations, once every forty thousand kalpas. To truly offer golden treasures and a sincere heart, one must adhere to the ancient statutes and proclaim the oath before the Ten Heavens.

These three clauses pertain to the procedures of transmission and reception, the statutes of the Upper Heavens, established once every forty thousand kalpas, in accordance with the ancient kalpic regulations. Since the Yellow Thearch received the Chart, Great Yu received the Talisman, and Gaoxin received the Heavenly Scriptures, down to the teachings bestowed by the Great Ultimate, how could there have been forty thousand kalpas? According to the new statutes revealed by the Celestial Matriarch upon her descent into the world, the teachings are transmitted once every four hundred years, with a forty-year period for transmission to a qualified recipient, and then another four hundred years before the next transmission. Altogether, no more than seven transmissions may occur. If a perfected one appears within four years, a single transmission of the three clauses may be permitted. These are the statutes governing the transmission and reception of the two great chapters of the Dharma and the forms of scripture recitation.

*Regulations for Extended Purification and Recitation*

The Dao states: During the extended purification of the first month, recite and intone this scripture on behalf of the departed souls of former generations, severing their bonds to earthly servitude and delivering them to the Southern Palace.

The first month is the month of the Upper Prime, when the Heavenly Officials convene, and the Earthly and Water Officials gather at the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Upper Prime to review all meritorious deeds, record names, and confer ranks and rewards.

Servitude entails the three paths of toil: the Heavenly Path of thunderous nets and lightning servitude, which is the labor of the Heavenly Officials; the Earthly Path of bearing sand and carrying stones, which is the labor of the Earthly Officials; and the Watery Path of drawing waves from the Milky Way, which is the labor of the Water Officials. There are also those conscripted as ghostly officials—sweeping the Five Marchmounts, laboring in the Prisons of Fengdu, or constructing embankments along the rivers and mountains—these are the servitudes of ghostly officials. Fearing that the departed souls of former generations may suffer these various paths of servitude, it is fitting in this month to undertake extended purification and recite the scriptures, delivering their souls to the Southern Palace.

During the extended purification of the seventh month, recite and intone this scripture to attain divine transcendence and immortality, with one’s name inscribed in the registers of the various heavens—the Yellow Register and the White Tablet—erasing death and inscribing life.

The seventh month is the month of the Middle Prime, when the Earthly Officials convene, and the Heavenly and Water Officials gather at the Solar Torch Palace of the Middle Prime to review merits and transgressions, recording names and celebrating the Assembly of the Middle Prime of Life. The Yellow Register is the Golden Register of Heaven, where the names of the living are inscribed. The White Tablet is the register of the dead. The so-called Golden Tablet records the names of the living, while the White Tablet erases the names of the dead. The transgressions of divine transcendents are recorded in the Cinnabar Tablets of the ledgers of sins, while the deaths of worldly persons are recorded in the Black Ledgers, all of which belong to the registers of the dead. Therefore, it is fitting in this month to undertake extended purification and recitation to deliver oneself, with one’s name inscribed in the registers of the various heavens, proclaiming life in the Yellow Register and the White Tablet, erasing one’s name from the death registers of the Northern Capital, inscribing life, and attaining divine transcendence and immortality.

During the extended purification of the tenth month, recite and intone this scripture on behalf of the king, the thearch, the lord, ministers, fathers, and sons, to pacify and secure the royal destiny, preserving the eternal endurance of Heaven, ensuring the dynasty’s perpetuity, and that they may forever remain as rulers of men.

The tenth month is the month of the Lower Prime, when the Water Officials convene, and the Heavenly and Earthly Officials, along with the true sages, immortals, and numinous spirits of all heavens, earths, and waters, the stellar bureaus, and the lords and masters of ghosts and spirits, universally review all merits, transgressions, good, and evil at the Tail Gate of the Eastern Ultimate, the source of the flowing waters, in the Clear and Cold Mansion. This is the month of the Universal Review and the Great Assembly of Established Life. It is fitting to undertake extended purification and recite the scriptures on behalf of the king, the thearch, the lord, ministers, fathers, and sons, ensuring the perpetuity of their lineage and their eternal rule as lords of men. By performing these meritorious deeds, the various heavens shall protect and commend them, recording their virtuous accomplishments.

The Master said: In the world, when lawsuits entangle the living, it is because the departed ancestors have brought suit in the courts of the unseen, dragging the living into their plight. This disrupts the reckoning of fate and brings misfortune, extending even to descendants. As a disciple of the Dao, one should first, during the Upper Prime, deliver the seven ancestors and nine lineages, severing the bonds of karmic retribution and ascending to the Southern Palace. Next, during the Middle Prime, deliver oneself—erasing the register of death, inscribing the ledger of life, and recording one’s name in the heavens—to attain the immortal Dao. Only then, during the Lower Prime, may one pray for the peace of the kingdom and the sacred mandate of the thearch, and, in accordance with the method, stabilize the afflicted regions by invoking the thirty-two celestial jade scripts of the heavens to secure those directions. This summons the harmonious qi of the various heavens, bringing the people to acclaim the Great Peace.

If a practitioner of immortality dies before achieving liberation, they remain bound in servitude to the Three Bureaus, their karmic debt extending to themselves, their name inscribed in the Black Register. Without their own immortal name recorded, how can they find leisure to perform meritorious deeds for the kingdom and the people? Therefore, at the beginning of each of the Three Primes—from Upper to Middle to Lower—one must practice the Dao and recite the scriptures to avoid transgressing the statutes and regulations.

On the days of the Eight Nodal Points, reciting this scripture enables one to become a Perfected of the Nine Palaces. The Eight Nodal Points are the four *li* (Beginnings of the Seasons), the two *zhi* (Solstices), and the two *fen* (Equinoxes). On these days, one should face the corresponding direction and recite the scripture to dispel and avert the calamities of the preceding half-season, as well as to pacify the nine provinces, mitigating disasters of flood, fire, blade, drought, and famine. By performing these meritorious deeds, one may attain the rank of Perfected of the Nine Palaces.

On one’s *benming* (natal destiny day), reciting this scripture purifies the hun-soul and spirit, ensuring the eternal preservation of the myriad qi. One avoids suffering and affliction, the body radiates light, the Three Realms provide guardianship, the Five Thearchs dispatch their attendants, and the myriad spirits pay homage. One’s name is inscribed in the heavens, and upon the fulfillment of merit and virtue, one ascends to the Highest Clarity.

The *benming* is the day of one’s original generation and transformation, revered by the various heavens. Yet in this Lower Prime, born into the world of the Five Turbidities, the five emotions assail one another, the six desires bind one, the seven *po* prevail, and the three *hun* weep in sorrow. Spirit and qi are both lost, the empty corpse moves, and the hundred demons vie for dominance. Moreover, the three *hun* are inherently linked to the Three Terraces, governing the qi of the Great Mystery’s generative mansion. By nature, they delight in wandering and soaring through the Three Realms. Upon encountering the root of life, they establish the *benming* and return to the body. If one recites the scriptures on this day, one can restrain the *hun* and *po*, thus purifying and settling the spirit, preserving the myriad qi without dissipation. Evil is kept at bay, the body radiates light, and the deities of the Three Realms stand guard, while the numinous officials of the Five Thearchs receive one.

Yet recitation alone is not sufficient. On this day, one may also practice the various methods of the *Great Cavern*, the supreme Dao of Highest Clarity, and the arts of nourishing life. All such practices make this an auspicious day, free from the trials of demonic testing. By accumulating such merit, the myriad spirits pay homage, and one’s name is inscribed in the heavens. When merit and virtue are complete, the *hun* ascends to Highest Clarity.

As for the Three Clarities: above the Four Brahmā Heavens lies the Heaven of the Nine Immortals, governed by the Palace of the Great Ultimate, where the Twelve Heavens of the Grand Clarity are inhabited by the Nine Immortals and ruled by the Nine Elders, with the Golden Portals of the Later Sages as their seat. This is the domain of the Lord of the Morning Dao. Above this are the Twelve Heavens of Highest Clarity, inhabited by the Nine Perfected, governed by the Lord of the Jade Dawn. Above that are the Twelve Heavens of the Great Peerless Jade Clarity, inhabited by the Nine Sages, ruled by the Primordial Beginning. This is the Heaven within Heaven, comprising the Thirty-Six Heavens. Highest Clarity lies above the Grand Clarity and below the Jade Clarity.

In the first month, recite the scripture for *Longevity and Enduring Vision*, the *Jade Talisman of the Great Tenuity*, the *Mysterious Pearl of the Jade Tablet*. The qi descends into the Three Fields, the hundred spirits stand in attendance, and the myriad sages approach the throne. The flying Brahmā net-wheel connects the hidden and the numinous.
*Right Talisman*: Wear this in the first month to summon the qi of the True Fire of Eastern Florescence, which enters the body, granting longevity and enduring vision, with boundless post-celestial potential.

In the seventh month, recite the scripture for *Longevity and Enduring Vision*, the *Mysterious Register of the Nine Immortals*, the *Golden Tablet of the Dragon Script*. It illumines the Great Mystery, the myriad thearchs offer rites, the Five Phases revolve, and the Golden Cavern and Jade Chamber receive the mandate to prolong life.
*Right Talisman*: Wear this in the seventh month to summon the qi of the Numinous True Mother’s *tang*-colored essence, which enters the body to generate the qi of metal, wood, and earth, granting longevity and enduring vision. With prolonged practice, the body ascends to Highest Clarity.

In the tenth month, recite the scripture for *Longevity and Enduring Vision*, the *Precious Register of the Jade Thearch*. The true origin disperses and spreads, brightly illuminating the nine thoroughfares. The spirit transforms upon the Thearch’s terrace, the Brahmā resonance fills the Great Void, and one circulates through the Six Directions, with the true qi secretly aiding.
*Right Talisman*: Wear this in the tenth month to summon the qi of the Five Lords of the Five Qi of the Northern Direction and the myriad worthies, which enters the body to generate the qi of water and wood, granting longevity and enduring vision with boundless post-celestial potential.

On the Eight Nodal Points, recite the scripture for *Longevity and the Great Thearch’s Enduring Vision*. The true qi forms a net, the empty ascends to the Mysterious Flower, the Three Passes are unobstructed, the Eight Effulgences are arrayed, and one merges with the sun to become a Perfected.
*Right Talisman*: Wear this on the Eight Nodal Points to summon the qi of the Yellow Thearch, Lord of the Gathering of Plans, which enters the body to generate the qi of earth and fire, granting longevity and causing the spirits to attend the Jade Perfected.

On one’s *benming*, recite the scripture of the *Precious Register of the Descent of the Perfected of the Jade Clarity of the Divine Empyrean*. The fetal immortal ascends to the upper effulgence, refining the essence-spirit. The left commands the Jade Flower, the right whistles to the Golden Dawn. One commands spirits and employs deities, ever preserving integrity and uprightness.
*Above Talismans*: Inscribe these on plain silk with cinnabar, practice them in secret, and do not speak of them to others. On the birthday of a cultivator of the true, face southeast, burn them in fire, and ingest them with pure water.

The Three Bureaus’ secret recitation:
The Master said: The supreme method of delivering beings emits a luxuriant radiance, dispelling celestial disasters above and averting terrestrial calamities below, aiding the myriad beings externally while refining the hundred spirits internally. The gateway to its practice begins with single-minded devotion. The method of recitation prioritizes focused contemplation. Thus, one harmonizes breath and qi, modulates the voice to be harmonious and flowing, visualizes the lushness of the three qi, and gathers the forest of the hundred spirits. This refines the self within and nurtures beings without.

The essence of recitation and cultivation: Enter the oratory, burn incense, settle the mind, and harmonize the qi. Withdraw the radiance to manifest internally, free from the intrusion of myriad thoughts. Sit upright without leaning or slouching, ensuring the path of the ox-cart remains unobstructed and the qi of the dragon and tiger flows ceaselessly. Only then may one recite the scriptures, each with its proper focus.

There are recitations of the spirit, the heart, and the qi—beyond these lies the recitation of intent. For the rulers of heaven, earth, and state, and for celestial phenomena, employ the recitation of the spirit. To avert calamities and perform supplications for others, use the recitation of the heart. To deliver all departed souls, apply the recitation of qi. For urgent matters, retire to a secluded chamber, silently recite the divine texts, and proceed with the ritual. From beginning to end, maintain proper visualization.

Recite the preface once, then pause. From the scripture’s opening, recite ten times as one cycle. Upon completion, submit the memorial in secret to the celestial bureaus, and ascend the spirits from the dwelling.

The oral instructions state:
In the first month, it is the Upper Prime; the practice resides in the Upper Palace. Visualize your infant self within the cinnabar field, ascending with the three-colored cloud-qi to return and abide in the Upper Palace. The sixth month follows the same method.
In the seventh month, it is the Middle Prime; the practice resides in the Middle Palace. Visualize the infant self within the middle field.
In the tenth month, it is the Lower Prime; the practice resides in the Lower Palace. Visualize the infant self within the lower field. The twelfth month follows the same method.
For prayers and averting misfortune, use the Upper Palace. For refining qi, use the Lower Palace. For delivering departed souls, use the Middle Palace.

When performing the nine kinds of yin merits, dispelling calamities, or establishing merit for one’s own deliverance, visualize yourself as the Primordial Beginning, seated upon a five-colored lion suspended in empty space, dwelling within the radiance of the sun. Each time you recite scriptures for others, visualize the Primordial Beginning in the Mud-Pill Palace of the upper field descending into the Crimson Palace, and gather the yang soul of the supplicant to receive the scriptures. As the Primordial Beginning bestows the scriptures, it is akin to the Lord of the Dao. When reciting, first perform the stabilizing method, then listen with focused attention as the Heavenly Worthy recites the scriptures, their resonant voice like a bell sounding into the lower cinnabar field. Recite three thousand times in the qi-field, three thousand times in the middle field, and four thousand times in the upper field, completing ten thousand cycles of merit.

**On the Practice of the Dao and Recitation**
The Scripture states: On the day of practice, one must bathe with fragrant water, fast, and enter the chamber.

The Master said: The "day of practice" refers to the appointed day for reciting scriptures, when one must bathe with fragrant water.

**Method for Bathing with Five-Fragrance Decoction**
Use:
- *Qingmuxiang* (Aucklandia root),
- *Baizhi* (Angelica dahurica),
- *Chenxiang* (Aquilaria),
- *Baitanxiang* (Sandalwood),
- *Gansong* (Nardostachys).

Take twenty-four *zhū* of each, grind and sift, then boil in one *dàn* of east-flowing spring water until it reaches a rolling boil.

Regarding *Qingmuxiang*, the *Great Possession of the Three Marvels Scripture* of the Celestial Mother states: It is the pure fragrance of the five seasons, dispelling the filth of the dusty world. When sincerely offered to the Supreme Mystery, burning it opens the path through the dust and filth, spanning five *zhàng* to connect with the celestial realms.

**Oral Instructions:**
Place the five-fragrance decoction in a vessel. First disrobe, burn incense, and sit to the left. Visualize the radiant essence of the sun and moon, their five-colored lights intertwining and entering the decoction. Next, visualize five colored immortals and five jade maidens arriving from the five directions, burning incense, scattering flowers, and holding towels and water at your sides. Stir the decoction thirty-two times with a ladle and recite the incantation:
*"Five-fragrance mysterious water, essence of sun and moon,
Purify and refine the body, dispel the turbid and retain the clear.
The dust of the corpse falls away, foul qi is swept clean.
The root of the fetal knot scatters, soaring through empty space,
Ascending into the Supreme Clarity."*

Upon finishing, click the teeth together and recite again:
*"Primordial true fluid, refining qi to quicken the spirit.
Bathed in the azure blossom, reciting the cavernous scriptures.
May my seven ancestors ascend as immortals,
As I soar into the Supreme Clarity."*

After reciting, click the teeth thirty-two times. First, drink a vessel of the decoction, adjusting its temperature to suit. Then, use another vessel to wash the hair. Begin by reciting the hair-unbinding incantation:
*"The divine palace shakes the heavens, black clouds disperse.
Molten gold and fire bells gleam boundlessly.
Grant me passage to the true, roaming the celestial realms,
Delivering boundless beings, summoning the immortal fate."*

After unbinding the hair, recite the hair-washing incantation:
*"Essence of sun and moon, flowing crystals in the Mud-Pill Palace.
Nourishing the nine palaces, the hundred spirits rejoice in awe.
The corpse’s residue vanishes, the true master gazes below.
Bestowed the divine tiger, I become an imperial guest."*

Upon finishing, recite the disrobing incantation:
*"Five Bushels array my robes, dragon and tiger attend the true.
The Three Luminaries shine brightly, ascending to the Jade Capital.
Disrobing to become immortal, grant me eternal life."*

After disrobing, recite the bathing incantation:
*"Jade spring of the Celestial Pond, bathe my form.
Internally refine the five viscera, externally open the nine gates.
Dispel the black and unblock the paths, cleansing the corpse’s filth.
Ten thousand recitations ensure my ascent to the imperial court."*

Upon completing the bath, recite the crown-donning incantation:
*"Azure clouds layer the mystery, granting me passage to the true.
The crown and topknot summon immortals, the five qi gather the true.
Divine radiance shines forth, ascending to the imperial court."*

After donning the crown, recite the clothing incantation:
*"Divine lads attend my robes, jade maidens burn incense.
Ascending to bow in the scripture chamber, jade tones resound.
Deliver my seven ancestors, wash away misfortune.
Prolong life and preserve existence, cloud-rooted treasure nectar."*

Recite the decoction-drinking incantation:
*"The Yellow Spirit guards the pass, the Azure Emperor protects the soul.
Heavenly hounds roar, myriad demons lose their essence,
The corpse’s blood is cleansed, the green worms vanish.
The seven *po* are refined and transformed, purple clouds arise.
Roaming and feasting in the Great Mystery, high immortals ride alongside."*

**Protocol for Entering the Chamber to Cultivate and Recite**
The Scripture states: Upon entering the chamber, face east, click the teeth thirty-two times to ascend to the thirty-two heavens, and bow thirty-two times with the heart. Close the eyes, still the thoughts, and visualize the body seated amidst the azure, yellow, and white cloud-qi, shrouded in mist within and without. A green dragon and white tiger, vermilion bird and dark warrior, lions and white cranes array to the left and right. The sun and moon illuminate brilliantly, suffusing the chamber with radiance. A circular image emerges from the nape, its light shining in all directions. Maintain this visualization with utmost clarity.

As stated in the *Scripture of Salvation* annotated by the Daoist Sovereign Emperor: Facing east is because the mortal realm gazes toward the Dark Capital, where the Jade Dawn resides in the east. Moreover, the Primordial Azure lies in the northeast, and the east is the source of generative qi. Thus, when performing the Dao or entering the chamber, one turns to face it to summon and extend the numinous qi.

The method of clicking the teeth: the left is the Heavenly Bell, used to strike down demonic spirits; the right is the Heavenly Chime, used to gather the hundred spirits; the center is the Heavenly Drum, used to summon the perfected sages. When entering the chamber to recite scriptures, contemplating the true and invoking the Dao, one clicks the teeth thirty-two times and bows thirty-two times with the heart. Internally, this exhausts one’s sincerity; externally, it corresponds to the numerological pattern. Internally, it gathers the divine spirits; externally, it extinguishes malevolent essences. Laterally, it encompasses the perfect principle; upward, it reaches the lofty perfected. Practicing and preserving this superior method leaves nothing unaddressed.

The method of bowing with the heart: one should visualize the Celestial Palace and its Emperor, who descends to pour down the qi of the Heavenly Perfected, like the radiance of jade clouds, entering one’s body. Swallowing and circulating it throughout, the act of bowing with the heart moves the spirits through sincerity. When devotion reaches its utmost, this is called "bowing with the heart surpassing bowing with the form." It is also said that in cultivating the superior Dao, one need only bow with the heart, thus avoiding disturbance to the brain palace—this is the meaning here.

The primary purpose is to summon forth the divine envoys within one’s body, such as the Merit Officers and Messengers, all transformed by the Dao-qi within oneself and in communion with the Dao. When one circulates the utmost true, the summons elicits wondrous response, transmitting the message to the celestial realms, penetrating one’s will and intent to harmonize with the Great Dao.

**Internal Practices for Cultivation and Recitation**
The Master states: For all cultivation and recitation, first bathe and change garments as before. After concentrating the spirit and contemplating the Dao, before entering the oratory chamber, first click the teeth and recite the *Entering the Chamber Spell*:

*"Fourfold Luminous Merit Officers, Dragon-Tiger Messengers, Orthodox One’s Generative Qi, Handmaidens of the Oratory—may the Radiant Youth and the Supreme Maiden enter the Yellow Chamber, convey my entreaty, and ensure it is heard above. Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance!"*

Next, step forward with the right foot, approach the scripture stand, light incense facing east, click the teeth nine times, and recite the *Heart Incense Spell*:

*"The Dao unites with the heart; faith is conveyed through incense. Holding the jade censer, the heart abides before the Emperor. The True Sovereign gazes below; the immortal sashes descend to the hall. Let my petition be transmitted, reaching the profound mystery."*

Then, sit upright and first recite the *Purification of the Mouth Spell*:

*"Cinnabar Mouth Spirit, expel filth and dispel miasma. Tongue Spirit of Rectitude, link life and nourish the spirit. Thousand-Teeth Spirit of the Net, repel evil and guard the true. Throat Spirit of the Mighty Tiger, qi-spirit guides the fluids. Heart Spirit of the Cinnabar Origin, let me commune with the true. Contemplate the spirit, refine the fluids, and the upright qi will ever abide."*

Next, recite the *Purification of the Body Spell*:

*"Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, pacify this bodily form. May the disciple’s soul and ethereal soul, the five viscera’s mysteries, be shrouded in darkness. Green Dragon and White Tiger, arrayed in splendid ranks; Vermilion Bird and Dark Warrior, guarding this bodily form."*

Then recite the additional spell:

*"I wash my body with the sun, refine my form with the moon. Immortals assist me; Jade Maidens protect my form. The twenty-eight constellations unite with me. A thousand evils and ten thousand afflictions are dispelled by the spell and purified."*

Next, close the eyes and still the heart, visualizing the Green Dragon of the east, whose mouth exhales the white qi of moon essence and kidney water, as if bathing the body in the great sea, washing away the impurities of the five viscera. After a long while, descend the true fire from the south, merging with the red qi of solar essence at the heart. The fire burns the body and the oratory, inside and out, leaving not a trace of smoke or filth. One then perceives a great wind blowing away all dust and grime. Visualize an infant within the cinnabar field, ascending from the earthly gate, pacing the Dipper, mounting the altar, and merging with one’s body.

Silently recite the *Purification of Heaven and Earth Spell*.

Within the cavern’s mysterious void, radiant and vast is the Great Origin.
The mighty spirits of the eight directions render me natural.
The talismanic commands of the Numinous Treasure universally proclaim to the Nine Heavens:
*Qianluo Danna*, the cavern’s mighty *gang*, the Supreme Mystery.
They sever demons and bind evil, slaying a thousand ghosts.
The Central Mountain’s divine spell, the Primordial Jade Script of Yuanshi.
Recite it once, and demons retreat while years extend.
Treading the Five Peaks, the Eight Seas take heed.
The Demon Kings bow their heads, attending my chamber.
Malevolence and filth dissolve, the Dao’s *qi* ever abides.

Gently inhale the true *qi* of the four directions, lightly blow it over the body, then visualize heaven and earth purified.
Next, envision the infant transforming into my form, becoming the True Person of Original Destiny—crowned, robed, and shod in the colors of my natal year’s *nayin* element.
Once the visualization is settled, gather the spirit and take one’s seat.
Then, imagine one’s own dignified bearing, and with the heart, pay homage to the ten directions, beginning in the east. For each direction, bow once in the heart.
Afterward, sit upright facing east and silently recite the *Mystic Essence of the Scripture’s Opening*:

Cloud-script fills the Great Void, at the dawn of kalpas.
Now distant, now near, now sinking, now floating.
Wandering the five directions, over a *zhang* and more.
The Heavenly True Sovereign took brush in hand and inscribed,
expounding the cavern’s chapters, then writing the numinous talismans.
Yuanshi descended, the true scriptures unfurled.
Luminous in presence, obscure in absence.
Sinking illness heals itself; worldly toil may be floated away.
The dark realms find solace, and thus one ascends to the Immortal Capital.

Then, recite the scripture’s preface from the beginning, up to the passage on the recipient’s body.
Visualize the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Directions and Five Emperors—twenty-four for each direction, totaling one hundred twenty—descending to attend beside the scripture table.
Next, recite up to the passage on ascending to the Upper Clarity.

The method states:
Close the eyes and silently contemplate the Thirty-Two Heavens, beginning at the northern quadrant with the Great Yellow Sovereign’s *Huangzeng* Heaven.
Proceed eastward into the south, circling through the four directions, each with eight heavens, situated within the Azure Empyrean and amid purple clouds.
Envision the eight eastern heavens positioned above the left ear’s tendon,
the eight western heavens above the right ear’s tendon,
the eight southern heavens before the forehead,
and the eight northern heavens behind the head,
each heaven layered with clouds of various hues.
Within each celestial palace’s towering halls, visualize the Emperor seated in solemn dignity.

The eight eastern heavens: azure crowns, azure banners, azure robes, azure skirts—beginning in the north and proceeding south.
The eight southern heavens: azure crowns, crimson banners, vermilion robes, yellow skirts—beginning in the west and proceeding east.
The eight western heavens: azure crowns, golden banners, white robes, white skirts, swaying—beginning in the south and proceeding west.
The eight northern heavens: azure crowns, white banners, vermilion skirts, black robes—beginning in the west and proceeding east.
Each is arrayed with attendants in formation.

Next, visualize the spirits beginning from the Great August Heaven. For each heaven, first silently knock the teeth together once, allowing the resonance to correspond to that heaven. Silently recite the Emperor’s taboo name, directing the mind’s sincerity upward to be heard in that heaven. Bow once in the heart, without moving the body, letting the mind’s reverence manifest as if the body were prostrating.

Circulate through the ten directions, completing thirty-two cycles. Then, circulate and transform the qi: from the upper cinnabar field at the Hall of Impression, emit the dark azure *xuanwu* qi; from the middle cinnabar field at the heart, emit the yellow *yuan* qi; from the lower cinnabar field below the navel, emit the white *shi* qi. Initially, they emerge like threads, gradually thickening until they merge with the external eastern azure qi, southern vermilion qi, western white boundary, and northern black qi, descending from each direction to blend with the *xuan*, *yuan*, and *shi* qi, forming clouds of three-colored qi.

First, they intertwine around the body’s form; next, they suffuse the entire chamber and the seat where one sits, leaving no space untouched. The practitioner’s body sits amidst a radiance of a hundred treasures, the qi of clouds penetrating through the entire body, filling the five viscera within and without with lush abundance. The qi swirls around the chamber, then extends outward to envelop one direction. The practitioner swallows saliva three times and sends forth a breath of qi, both entering the cinnabar palace, where they transform into a golden beam of three colors, piercing straight through the Mud Pill and dispersing to circulate and emanate. A single perfected one ascends to pay homage, while the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor sits majestically at the center. One breath transforms into Jade Dawn on the left, another breath transforms into the Venerable Lord on the right—all distinctly clear.

After a long while, the vision merges with heaven and earth.

Next, circulate the left hand’s Jade Purity mudra, extending it to the *chen* line. Direct the liver’s qi: one text says from the left eye, another from the left ear. It emerges as the Azure Dragon, attending on the left. One version states that the qi ascends with a blue-robed perfected one riding upon it, ascending to pay homage to the Three Heavens.

Next, direct the white qi from the lungs: one text says from the nose, another from the right ear. It emerges as the White Tiger, guarding the right. One version states that the qi ascends with a white-robed perfected one riding upon it, ascending to pay homage to the Three Heavens.

Next, direct the red qi from the heart: one text says from the mouth, another from the crown of the head. It emerges as the Vermilion Bird, leading the way. One version states that the qi bears a ruler in courtly attire, holding a jade tablet, ascending to pay homage to the Three Heavens.

Next, direct the black qi from the kidneys: one text says from the ears, another from the feet. It emerges as the Dark Warrior, following behind. One version states that the qi ascends with a black-robed perfected one, ascending to pay homage to the Three Heavens.

Next, direct the yellow qi from the spleen, emerging from the lower cinnabar field below the navel as a lion standing below, while the cinnabar field above bears the perfected one aloft, head raised to ascend and pay homage. One text says twelve emerge from the root of the tongue, arrayed to the left, right, and front. Another says the azure qi from the gallbladder emerges from the right eye to transform.

Next, circulate the white qi from the Abyssal Mystery Palace at the navel. With the left hand, trace the twelve qi mudras, returning to the *wu* position to manifest thirty-six auspicious cranes arrayed in the four directions. One text says nine emerge from the Mud Pill, stationed beyond the lion.

Next, with both hands, trace the mudras of the *si*, *wu*, and *wei* palaces at the celestial court above. Raise the eyes to the heavens, and the radiance of the sun and moon, the golden and plain qi, flashes forth six cranes, which disperse before the two eyebrows at the celestial court above, riding the qi as they float.

Next, visualize the Six Harmonies mansion behind the eyebrows in the two small cavities. The sun and moon emerge there: the sun with nine rays of purple and red, the moon with ten rays of yellow and white, nine inches from the face, illuminating the chamber with a brilliance like gold and jade.

Next, visualize the radiance of the sun and moon pouring into the nose, entering the Golden Flower Palace four inches behind the brain. Then, from the Purple Tenuity Jade Pillow Palace, the light congeals into a luminous sphere, emitting from the nape of the neck a nine-colored circular image, its rays like rainbows, as large as a chariot wheel, illuminating the ten directions. Visualize each detail clearly.

When this is complete, silently recite the secret incantation: *Tanluo Yuluo*. "Silently" means the words do not pass the lips, and the ears do not hear the sound.

Next, move the mouth slightly to vocalize the sound, uttering: *Wushang Xuanyuan yunyun*. When reaching the section on "opening the petition," state one’s position and silently present the petition, expressing all that the heart desires. For example, if today is an auspicious day for prolonged fasting, state accordingly. If not fasting, proceed according to the day’s practice, such as "purifying the hall to cultivate the scripture." If practicing the Dao of the Three Caverns’ covenant, state "cultivating the practice." If regularly reciting scriptures, state "purifying the hall to recite scriptures," or "for the immeasurable deliverance of beings," or "universal deliverance of the living and the dead," using "immeasurable" as appropriate. If for a specific matter, state "for such-and-such a matter," concluding with "your servant, so-and-so." If it is not fitting to name oneself, simply state "your servant, reciting the scripture for rebirth," or if performing divination for another, state "on behalf of so-and-so." If reciting for oneself or another according to the text, follow the principle of circulating through ten cycles.

When the petition is complete, state: "May the prayer ascend to the presence of the Most Revered Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor in the thirty-two heavens above the Primordial August Upper Realm." One version states that from here, one may also ascend to pay homage to the Three Heavens or the Nine Heavens.

For each of the thirty-two breaths drawn, begin again from the Supreme Yellow Emperor Layered Heaven, visualizing the descent of true qi like the radiance of jade and rosy clouds, pouring down to bathe the practitioner’s body, which is absorbed and swallowed through the nose.

For the qi of the eight eastern heavens, visualize it entering the liver, gallbladder, sinews, and vessels, where its essence transforms into the Lord of Primordial Flower, residing in the liver.

For the qi of the eight southern heavens, visualize it entering the heart and pericardium’s divine palace, where its essence transforms into the Lord of Life Mandate, residing in the heart.

For the qi of the eight western heavens, visualize it entering the lungs, spleen, and stomach, where its essence transforms into the Venerable White Prime Spirit, residing in the lungs.

For the qi of the eight northern heavens, visualize it entering the kidneys and bones, where its essence transforms into the Lord of Peach Vitality, residing below the navel.

After circulating the qi through the ten directions, visualize the perfected one within the cinnabar field, reciting the scripture in a soft voice. For the first recitation, begin with "Once, in the Primordial Azure Heaven..." and continue to the end of the preface, concluding the visualization. Next, begin reciting from the *Primordial Beginning Cavern Mystery* and continue to the end of the scripture.

For every ten recitations, perform one visualization, taking ten recitations as one *pass*, and ten *passes* as one *cycle*. Once ten *passes* are complete, visualize the spirits entering their respective palaces according to the prescribed method.

The Master said: The methods of scripture recitation each have their own focus. There are *mind invocations*, *soft invocations*, and *silent invocations*. Thus, *mind invocation* means visualizing the spirit within the heart and invoking with intent; *soft invocation* means reciting in a voice audible only to oneself; *silent invocation* means merely mouthing the words so that others cannot hear. There are also *spirit recitation*, *heart recitation*, and *qi recitation*—these correspond to the upper, middle, and lower cinnabar fields. Beyond these, there is *intent recitation*, each varying according to the weight of the matter, distinguishing between inner and outer recitation. When reciting, do so in a low voice; when chanting, intone clearly. Swallow saliva once every ten words to nourish the qi and moisten the inner palaces. Tap the teeth once every hundred words to gather the perfected and harmonize the spirits, externally preserving the body from becoming an empty husk devoid of spirit. If a single character is mispronounced, recite the preceding thirty characters again. If a character is skipped, recite the preceding fifty characters again before continuing. Do not rise or move until two chapters are completed. After ten recitations, perform one visualization; at the end of a chapter, one may rest and take nourishment. Whenever resting or taking nourishment, immediately resume visualization as before. Do not allow the mind to wander into confusion or vulgar thoughts, nor let intent stray from the supreme Dao, the lofty sagely, and the true method. The heart must revere the scriptures of the Three Treasures, the Lords, the Masters, and the parents; the will must honor the *Emerald Jade Flower Precious Chapters*; the body must pay homage with incense, morning and evening devotions, bowing, and kneeling. If the mouth recites while the heart wanders, if form and voice diverge from intent, if one merely chants for merit or seeks swift completion for the sake of numbers, if characters are mispronounced or scriptures recited carelessly, how can ten thousand recitations bring one to ride the clouds and plow the heavens? Even a hundred million recitations will only sink one deeper into the mire, rendering the practice an empty husk. Those who fault the Dao as empty words do not realize their own failure to attain it. One must receive instruction from a master and recite in accordance with heavenly principles. If after ten thousand recitations one does not ascend to the Great Void, the fault lies with the practitioner’s own deception, and no immortal or perfected rank will be attained. Disciples who receive and recite these scriptures must strive diligently, avoiding the transgressions of careless recitation and reckless disclosure. To violate these is to lack the Dao and compassion. Heaven has its clear statutes; the spirits dare not show partiality.

When the scripture has been recited ten times, click the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, bow to the ten directions with the heart, then rise facing south and descend from the seat. Next, stand facing east, bow three times with the heart, close the eyes, and silently pray:
*"Your servant So-and-So respectfully recites the Golden Writ and Jade Scripture. Ten cycles now complete, I beseech the dragon palanquin’s descent. Heavenly spirits descend, dispatching the Six Dings. Nine ancestors ascend in flight; I soar to Highest Clarity."*

Next, close the eyes, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva ten times, then turn north, bow three times with the heart, and silently intone:
*"Supreme August Perfected, enable my ascent to perfection. Purified fast, refined through ablutions, I chant and sing the Golden Writ. Seven Mysteries dispersed, I ascend to the Great Void. Prolong years and abide forever, inscribe my name in the Registers."*

Close the eyes, click the teeth nine times, swallow saliva ten times, then turn east and silently intone:
*"Your servant has now completed the scripture recitation. The Three and Five Functionaries of the Office who emerged from my body, the attendants to my left and right, the Incense-Bearing Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, the Fragrance Palace of the Day—thirty-two each—return now into my body. Reenter your palaces and chambers; let no disorder arise. When next summoned, return as before, in accordance with precedent."*

With focused intent, return to the palace. Having done so, click the teeth three times and swallow saliva thrice. Offer incense, close the eyes, and silently intone:
*"The sacred hosts who came to hear and guard the scripture—scatter from the altar, dissolve the assembly, and return each to your posts. Let the divine winds fall silent, mountains and seas grow solemn and clear. A thousand evils hide in submission; a hundred spirits shield this form."*

Visualize the perfected saints of the ten directions ascending upon clouds, beginning with the east. For each direction, click the teeth three times, bow in reverence thrice, then draw in the three-colored cloud-qi through the nose, absorbing it into the five viscera.

Next, gather the spirits: first the Vermilion Bird, then the Azure Dragon, third the White Tiger, fourth the Dark Warrior, fifth the Lion, sixth the White Crane. Finally, inhale once to draw all in, guiding the perfected into the muddy pellet, imagining them restored to their original positions. Swallow saliva thrice to conclude.

**Closing Qi Incantation**
*"The nine palaces of celestial numen,
The Great One guards the chamber.
A hundred spirits merge in harmony,
Soul and spirit rest in health.
Long life and enduring vision,
Sun and moon share their radiance."*

For audience, recitation, ascent, and descent in the precious realm:

**Secret Formula**
The nine-colored circular image is the inner vision of the Primordial Beginning. When empowered, its colors manifest. Five-colored lions transform the five viscera; five-colored radiant filaments coalesce into a jade-green hue. Swallow saliva once, and auspicious qi congeals into five-colored lions, standing within the lower cinnabar field.

The heart is the crimson palace atop a lotus; the perfected is the Primordial Heavenly Worthy within the body, suspended in empty floating. Thus the perfected rides the flower, seated upon the lion—this is the Dao.

**Recitation of Inner Sound Secrets**
As the *Scripture of Numinous Treasure Jade Characters* states: For every recitation of the middle section of the Numinous Writ, each direction has its method of invocation and visualization.

When reciting the sixty-four characters of the east, *Zhilou Ahui*, click the teeth nine times and envision nine-colored dragons guiding before and behind, nine layers of azure clouds enveloping the body.

**Eastern Secret Incantation**
*"In the radiance of the Crimson Dawn, the chart unfolds,
Nine qi return to perfection.
Mastering the primordial gate,
Great Azure Emperor Divine.
Flowing transformation beyond the nine realms,
Entwining my form.
Numinous sounds of eight writings,
Sixty-four chapters.
Penetrating heaven and earth,
Uniting with me in transcendence.
Summoning dragon chariots,
Ascending to the imperial axis."*

After the incantation, draw qi and swallow nine times. Practicing this for nine years, the eight heavens each send eight Azure Waist Jade Maidens and eight Azure Splendor Jade Lads to attend the body, bestowing the essence of nine azure sprouts. The spirit’s light shines through, revealing the void. After ten thousand recitations, the Dao is complete, enabling flight. Seven ancestors share the blessing, all ascending to the Southern Palace.

When reciting the southern *Nanyan Dongfu*, click the teeth three times and envision the Vermilion Bird and phoenix soaring before and behind, three layers of crimson clouds covering the body.

**Southern Secret Incantation**
*"Three qi linger and return,
Numinous phoenixes crimson in flight.
Jade sounds of eight characters,
Resplendent in the Purple Tenuity.
Auspicious day of great celebration,
My Dao opens wide.
Crimson nectar nourishes,
I gaze up and absorb the divine radiance.
Body born of water and fire,
Crimson mantle and feathered robe.
Ascending empty space, stepping in flight,
Feet tread the phoenix ladder.
Circulating through the eight heavens,
Seven ancestors follow.
After the incantation, draw qi and swallow three times. Practicing this for three years, the eight heavens each send eight Great Cinnabar Jade Maidens and eight Great Yang Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of three crimson qi and white radiance, enduring for ten thousand kalpas without decline. Seven ancestors transcend and ascend, entering the Hall of Blessings, returning to the womb of immortals—thus attaining long life.

When reciting the western *Daoli Chanyou*, click the teeth seven times. Envision the White Tiger and lion guiding left and right, seven layers of white clouds covering the body.

**Western Secret Incantation**
*"Seven qi of golden numen,
Eight heavenly honored deities.
White Tiger steers the chariot,
Lions bear the axle.
Seven blacks entwine,
Refining me into transcendence.
Body ascends in golden light,
Illuminating white clouds.
Inner and outer transform,
Ascending through the golden gate.
Seven ancestors emerge from night,
Nine dark realms’ souls return.
Opening salvation for kalpas,
Abiding with the turning of fate."*

After the incantation, draw qi and swallow seven times. Practicing this for seven years, the eight heavens each send eight White Numen Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the fragrance of seven primordial whites, halting aging and preserving the world. For ten thousand kalpas, the face remains youthful. Blessings extend to seven ancestors, ascending to the Southern Palace, returning to the womb for rebirth—generation after generation, an immortal household.

When reciting the northern *Juewu Ziyu*, click the teeth five times. Envision flying dragons and the Dark Warrior, their feathered canopies lush and dense, covering the body left and right. Divine lads and jade maidens in feathered robes and flying garments attend the form.

**Northern Secret Incantation**
*"Dark heavens linger,
Flowing light ascends to the Upper Clarity.
Great Possession initiates the turning,
Eight characters exalted and bright.
Flying darkness stills the void,
Yin spontaneously generates.
Five qi entwine,
Irrigating my form.
Crowned and girded in the northern solitude,
Receiving refinement and awaiting transformation.
Kidney palace opens to the north,
Inner and outer radiance refined.
Flying through the three realms,
Roaming and feasting in the Purple Court.
Seven ancestors share the celebration,
Joyful in kalpa’s age.
Within the forest of seven treasures,
Returning to the womb for rebirth.
Emerging from eternal night,
Name recorded in the Southern Palace.
Yellow registers and white tablets,
Generation after generation, immortal birth."*

After the incantation, draw qi and swallow five times. Practicing this for five years, the eight heavens each send eight Great Primordial Jade Lads to attend the body, descending the essence of five numinous nourishments, restoring years and preserving radiance, safeguarding life in the Three Clarities. Blessings extend to nine ancestors—generation after generation, immortal birth.

**The four inner sounds of the directions:** If one can recite them according to the secret, there is nothing they cannot repel, nothing they cannot exorcise, nothing they cannot deliver, nothing they cannot accomplish. Soaring through heaven to behold the vistas, the Celestial Thearch sings from afar. Ten thousand spirits pay homage, the three realms attend in reverence, subduing and commanding all spirits. The ten directions grow solemn and clear; the Dao is complete, merits fulfilled—one serves the three realms.

**Inner Recitation**
The master says: In all practices of recitation—delivering from distress, dispelling calamities, subduing and rescuing, incanting over objects, crushing malevolent spirits, exorcising and suppressing inauspicious omens, repelling and expelling strange lights, summoning dragons to govern rain, praying for clear skies and luminous vision, halting floods and extinguishing fires, eliminating plagues and removing harm, issuing talismans and consecrating water, restraining venomous beasts, seeking transcendence—cultivate the seven classics and eight wefts.

Invocation of the Perfected and summoning of spirits both require the secret recitation of the *Divine Scripture*. After ten thousand repetitions, whatever one desires shall swiftly manifest through numinous efficacy. Upon reaching one hundred thousand repetitions, one attains spontaneity in sitting meditation, and transformation knows no bounds. In times of great need, one may inscribe cryptic words, burn them, and scatter the ashes, or write them upon cliffs and boulders in mountain valleys, bury them in the earth, or submerge them in water. For gathering immortal medicines to cure illness, this *Divine Scripture* is employed—those who recite and uphold it follow the oral instructions.

Recite to the White Prime Honored Deity one thousand times,
to the Great One one thousand times,
to the Controller of Destinies one thousand times,
to Peach Vitality one thousand times,
to the Radiant Lordling one thousand times.

Here ends the twenty-fourth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Highest Clarity*.
The twenty-fifth scroll of the *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Highest Clarity*.

Transmitted by the Cavernous Subtlety Adept, the Illuminating and Salvific Perfected, Ning Quanzhen, to the disciple of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity, Ling Mai, who received the teachings from his preceptor, Wang Qizhen.

**Classification of Scripture Passages**
The master says: The *Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure* contain sixty-four sentences of *Great Brahmā* cryptic speech, corresponding to the numbers of the *Sūtra of the Sun*. They emerged before heaven and earth, prior to the hexagrams, embodying the ancient and present symbols of yin and yang. When the *Great Brahmā* unfolded the chart, at the inception of numbers, the Primal Mother of Kun was already revealed, binding and covering, while the nine suns guided Qian, and the names of the two hexagrams were established.

By the time of Emperor Wu of Han, the Queen Mother of the West descended to transmit this scripture, revealing the secret words of the unfolding chart to manifest the symbols of the sixty-four hexagrams, which permeate the sixty cyclical years. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li emerge beyond the bounds of the sixty cyclical years, unbound by the limits of the celestial stems and earthly branches. Within this scripture, there is only one woman, whose name contains the character for "fire" but lacks the character for "water." There is, however, the character for "spring," signifying true water. Its principles are profoundly subtle. Thus, the inception of numbers arises before the existence of heaven and earth. The breath of inhalation and exhalation harmonizes with yin and yang, constituting the breath within the ceaseless breath. Where breath settles, the myriad convergences pay homage; the eight obscure and subtle meridians. Where the meridians settle, one breath encompasses four audiences: one exhalation issues commands, one inhalation pays homage, one exhalation spans three inches, one inhalation spans three inches. The progenitor of the three qi, the great circulation of *Brahmā* qi. One audience comprises fifteen divisions. The nine and six of heaven and earth, yin and yang interweaving, great numbers may be deduced from this to reach lengths of feet. Thus, accumulating divisions forms inches, piling inches makes feet, and feet compose yards. Hence, the finger serves as an inch, the forearm as a foot, manifesting in physical form. Thereafter, the standards of pitch pipes, calendars, measurements, weights, the five planets, seven luminaries, eight trigrams, nine palaces, twenty-four solar terms, and seventy-two pentads all arise from this. The sages took these as models, crafting instruments and establishing the myriad patterns. Truly, within emptiness lies treasure—this is the transformation of the primordial unity of qi.

Within this scripture, the myriad rites are complete, such as the cinnabar of yin and yang, celestial patterns and prohibitions, divination of fortune and misfortune, observation of shadows to foretell the future, and the safeguards of knowing what is to come—all are concealed herein. It further elucidates the primordial qi, the mother of the great Dao, the methods of returning to the essence of lead and mercury, the root of the three qi in the Western Prime, the secret name of the Primal Mother of Kun and the mysteries of the Dark Obscurity, the great cavern’s revolving winds to escape death, the Dao of blending and attaining perfection, extending to the salvation of the living and deliverance of the dead, summoning the Perfected and invoking spirits, blessing the state and pacifying families, prospering the times and enriching all things, quelling and protecting, repenting and beseeching—nothing is left unaddressed.

Additionally, it includes the implements of ritual and music, the forms, names, robes, colors, weapons, and measures for demons and spirits, the Dao of the five constants and the protocols of posture and movement—all were prepared in the primordial era, as spoken by the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. Thus, the Dao Lord arranged and compiled them, and they were inscribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. In the middle antiquity, the Confucians established the teachings of governing the world, solely emphasizing benevolence and righteousness, benefiting only one school, and the great Dao was thereby concealed. Little did they know that its source lay in the primordial era. Originally arising from one source, it branched into ten thousand streams. Colors return to the colorless, and the hundred rivers merge back into the sea, ultimately reverting to the Primordial Ancestor.

Those who comprehend this scripture become teachers of emperors and kings; those who penetrate its mysteries become Heavenly Perfected. In accordance with the esoteric regulations, it is transmitted to celestial beings once every forty thousand kalpas. Formerly, the Queen Mother of the West of the Sacred Realm translated celestial symbols into worldly script and transmitted them to Emperor Wu of Han, employing them to establish instruments, model the myriad things, and transmit them to the human world. The scripture contains forty-seven categories, universally following the instructions of the sages, all determined by the ancient rituals. Today, following the Han system, we may clarify the primordial qi of the Primordial Ancestor.

**Preface to the Scripture’s Categories**
Burying gold and jade to stabilize the Five Peaks,
casting dragon and jade into the abysses of the sea,
casting the nine tripods to pacify the nine provinces.
The above three items serve as examples for emperors to practice the Dao and secure the nation’s fortune.

When the revolutions of heaven and earth end, the stars and constellations fall into disorder, the sun and moon lose their clarity, the four seasons deviate from their courses, and yin and yang fall out of harmony.
The above five items serve as examples for dispelling celestial disasters.

Curing illness—following the rites to restore harmony.
Dissolving poison—dispelling and averting the baleful qi of regional calamities.
Delivering the corpse—employing the nine refinements to ascend.
The above three items serve as examples for averting poison and harm.

Ascending to the Vermilion Palace,
soaring to the Golden Gates,
flying to the Southern Palace,
feasting in the Jade Capital,
roaming the Great Void,
ascending to the Southern Palace,
soaring to Highest Clarity,
wandering freely in Highest Clarity,
ascending to the Southern Palace by rank,
being named to ascend to the Southern Palace,
soaring through the Great Void,
the soul ascending to the Vermilion Mound,
roaming the Three Realms.
The above thirteen items serve as examples of ascension.

All attain longevity, preserving their allotted years.
All achieve deliverance from the world, enduring through kalpas.
Lineages flourish, ancestors receive deliverance.
One thereby attains immortality, prolonging life and years,
achieving liberation through simulated death,
becoming a Perfected of the Nine Palaces,
ensuring the nation’s peace,
ascending to the rank of Immortal Elder,
the Demon Kings respecting one’s form,
refining the body in the Great Yin.

As a minister of the Golden Gates to the Sagely Lord,
receiving the homage of the myriad spirits,
recommended by the Demon Kings.

The above seventeen items serve as examples of meritorious responses to virtue.

Presenting golden treasures and sincere devotion,
pledging oaths to the Ten Heavens.

The above one item serves as an example of transmission and ordination.

According to ancient texts, one offers gold and treasures,
devotes the heart, and pledges oaths to Heaven for transmission.
Following the Mysterious Regulations, transmission occurs once every forty thousand kalpas.
Again, one pledges oaths to the Ten Heavens before transmission.
Divided into three clauses, as in the scripture’s preface, it states that what the Upper Heavens treasure is not transmitted to the lower world.
When a scholar examines gold and treasures, devotes the heart, and pledges oaths to Heaven for transmission, this is deemed proper for the recipient.
Within the scripture, it states: following the Mysterious Regulations, transmission occurs once every forty thousand kalpas.
If a perfected person examines gold and treasures with a sincere heart, adheres to the old statutes, and pledges oaths to the Ten Heavens, only then is the transmission bestowed.
This precisely describes the standard for transmission and ordination.
It should not be separately listed; thus, only one clause is retained.

The body incurs calamity,
calamity extends to the nine ancestors,
leaking and negligence lead to descent into hell.

The above three items serve as examples of offenses and their consequences.

The scripture states that those who recite without fasting, bathing, or burning incense incur the sin of calamity.
If one lightly violates the regulations and prohibitions, recklessly discloses secrets to the uninitiated, leaks the Mysterious Mysteries, fails to adhere to the time limits, receives transmission without fasting or pledging oaths, divulges secret prohibitions, or shares them with the unworthy, showing disrespect and disbelief in the Mysterious Texts—all fall under the middle category, with calamity extending to the nine ancestors.
If one leaks or neglects these matters without regard, cunningly seeks novelties, debates the sacred canon, slanders the Mysterious Texts, or steals celestial treasures—all fall under this clause, with misfortune extending to the seven ancestors and their forebears.

**Malevolent Categories**
Those of evil kind: inherently fierce, their voices harsh, their foul qi yet unspent, their bodies not yet penetrated by true reality. Evil roots, the Three Evils, those who obstruct others—severing the Gate of Life in men, poisonous malice, death followed by further harm.

The deaf find their ears opened as one; the blind see moonlight; the benighted awaken. The lame, long afflicted, recover; chronic illnesses and hernias fade. White hair darkens, fallen teeth regrow.

The Ritual Kind
Summoning the ten directions, one first approaches the seat. The host of perfected beings attends the seat, the mysterious seat floating upon five-colored lions in the void. None but bows in devotion, turning their hearts in reverence. The Primordial Beginning ascends and guides, expounding the scripture until its completion. The host of perfected beings oversees deliverance. When this scripture is expounded, it circles the ten directions. The whole earth turns in reverence, venerating and honoring with rites. The myriad spirits establish rituals, the Five Emperors stand guard, the Three Realms prostrate. Divine luminaries protect the gates, precious gold and jewels pledge allegiance to Heaven in transmission. The divine script protects the body of the scripture’s recipient. Kings, emperors, lords, ministers, fathers, and sons—the Three Realms stand guard, the Five Emperors receive, the myriad spirits pay homage. The message ascends to the Thirty-Two Heavens. On the day of practicing the Dao, one must bathe in fragrant waters, fast, enter the chamber, face east, and click the teeth. With heartfelt prostration, eyes closed in still contemplation, the body sits amidst three-colored clouds, arrayed to left and right. Sun and moon illuminate, a circular radiance arises from the nape, its light suffusing the ten directions. Thus clearly and secretly, one summons forth the minister within the body, opening the gates of speech to ascend directly to the throne. Drawing qi thirty-two times, facing east to recite the scripture. Today, the celestial registers descend, the heavenly courts draw near. All ride flying clouds, escorting the imperial chariot, raising nine-colored standards to open the way. Flanking the imperial axle, they turn their radiance to guide the return, arriving together before the Emperor. The guards of form and soul array their words in the Supreme Clarity. Demon kings safeguard and receive, demon kings revere the form, attendants escort and welcome. Pledging sincerity, swearing oaths to the Ten Heavens, with unified hearts they fast, burning incense in the six periods, reciting the scripture ten times. For this, they burn incense, recite the scripture ten times to deliver corpse forms according to the law. They must also fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures to perform these meritorious deeds for the Emperor of Heaven and Earth and the multitudes. On days of disaster, they resolve to fast, burn incense, and recite scriptures. The myriad spirits stand guard, protecting their bodies. Those who fast and recite will dispatch flying heavenly gods and kings to observe below. The myriad spirits pay homage, earthly deities attend the gates, recommending them as exalted immortals. Flying gods descend to observe, the Supreme Emperor sings from afar. The Three Realms attend the imperial chariot, the myriad spirits tremble and submit, offering reverent veneration.

**Loyalty Categories**
Throughout the realm, men and women alike incline their hearts; all who incline their hearts in reverence turn to cultivate virtuous minds. With unified compassion, even those of different lineages become kin. The nation is at peace, the people prosper, and all rejoice in great tranquility. When the entire realm, guided by the Dao, nurtures resolve, it serves as the foundation for kings, emperors, and lords—securing the nation’s destiny and preserving heaven’s eternal endurance. As the land is stabilized, the people praise its peace; the calamities of the kalpa are restrained, ensuring heaven’s perpetual existence.

When heaven and earth reach their end, when the sun, moon, and five planets wane and wax, the sagely and divine intervene to avert their decline. If heaven and earth approach their end, if the constellations stray from their courses and the sun and moon lose their proper times, if the four seasons fall into disorder and yin and yang fail to harmonize—then the ruler faces disaster, and warfare arises on all sides. When pestilence and poison spread, the multitudes perish and suffer. By burning incense and reciting scriptures, one may dispel celestial calamities to protect and stabilize the emperor, and below, ward off harm to deliver the people. For the lords of heaven and earth and the multitudes, when disaster strikes, they must resolve to perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

**Filial Piety Categories**
The suffering souls of countless generations of ancestors ascend to the Vermilion Palace. The departed spirits of past ages, bound to earthly toil, are delivered to the Southern Palace. Seven generations of ancestors ascend, forever freed from the offices of ghosts. For fathers and sons, the sufferings of ancestors and kin across eons are dissolved; their names are stricken from the ledgers of sin, and their evil roots eradicated. Even for departed teachers and friends, one should perform purification rites, burn incense, and recite scriptures.

**Literary Categories**
Divine texts—*Yellow Registers*, *White Tallies*, names inscribed in heaven, the *Chaotic Crimson Writ*, the *Five Scriptures* that expand the cosmos. If the primordial text lacks radiance, if it is not luminous, not established, not perfected, not delivered, not brought forth—today, the records are examined, scrolls and registers held, and a universal proclamation is made to the Three Realms. Swiftly, the ledgers of sin are expunged. By the *Mandate of the Primordial Beginning*, the text ascends to heaven; the divine lords receive their charge. The *Five Chapters* are disseminated, the *Crimson Writ* in jade characters, the *Eight Might Dragon Scripts*—thus the *Cavern Texts* are composed. A covenant is proclaimed to the Ten Heavens, recording the merits and transgressions of humanity. The *Central Chapter of the Numinous Book of the Primordial Beginning*—once its words were inscribed, its labors and merits recorded, and a memorial was presented to the heavens.

Those who comprehend this scripture become teachers to emperors and kings; those who penetrate its mysteries become celestial perfected.

**Volume Twenty-Five of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual Concludes**
**Volume Twenty-Six of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Ritual**

*Transmitted by Dongwei Gaoshi Kaiguang Jiuku Zhenren Ning Quanzhen to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity and Successor in the Teaching of the Numinous Treasure*

**Chapter on the Exegesis of the Scripture’s Essence**

The Master said: Of the three hundred and sixty categories of scriptures expounded by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, thirty-six are revered as the foremost. Yet all trace their origin to this single scripture, the ancestral source of the ten thousand methods. It encompasses the utmost of *Dongzhen* (Cavern of Perfection), penetrates *Dongxuan* (Cavern of Mystery), and embraces *Dongshen* (Cavern of Divinity)—hence it is called the *Great Ritual*.

**The Descent of the Luminous Pearl**

In ancient times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy expounded this scripture in the Azure Beginning Heaven and bestowed it upon the Dao Lord. Later, in the Heaven of Great Cinnabar, he conferred it in the voice of the Great Brahmā. After the Dao Lord compiled it, the heavens treasured it, secreting it within the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Jade Capital in the Mysterious Metropolis. Its transmission was most solemn, reserved for the sagely alone.

Later, the Queen Mother of the West petitioned the Heavenly Emperor to descend it for the salvation of the *jiashen* calamity, entrusting it to the adepts of cultivation. Thus it remained in the mortal realm.

This scripture comprises the esoteric hymns of the Heavenly Thearchs and the concealed chants of the Numinous Demon Kings. Within it are expounded the kalpas of heaven and earth, the names of the myriad spirits, the intercourse of yin and yang, and the generation and transformation of primordial *qi*. Its meanings cannot be fully exhausted; those who attain the Dao will naturally fathom its depths.

The heavens transmit it but once every forty thousand kalpas, and even then, only once every forty years. To leak or profane it brings misfortune upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude in the nether darkness. How could one not be cautious?

**The Origin of the Inner Sound**

Once, the Heavenly Worthy was seated in the Xiangling Lodge of the Vermilion Clarity World. At that time, clouds and mist surged thickly for three days and nights, and the gloom of yin did not disperse. The Five Elder Thearchs petitioned the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "Never before have we witnessed such a sight during your teachings. When you expound the Dao, mountains and seas fall silent, and heaven and earth grow solemn and clear. Yet today, this murky darkness has left heaven and earth in dread. We are perplexed and dare not presume the cause."

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Today, the numinous portents of the myriad heavens arise spontaneously. The Jade Script shines resplendently, veiling heaven and earth, compelling all in attendance to close their eyes in reverence. Suddenly, the Brahmā *qi* of the heavens manifested, dispelling the gloom. Five-colored radiance illuminated the ten directions, and sacred writings—each character a *zhang* in size—appeared in the void. Their brilliance dazzled the eyes, their eight corners trailing beams of light, too resplendent to behold directly."

The Heavenly Worthy proclaimed to the assembled spirits: "These eight scrolls of numinous script bear no fixed form; their purport is profound and abstruse. None among you can fathom their depths." He then commanded the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to transcribe the characters and elucidate their sounds, bestowing them upon the Dao Lord. In total, there were two hundred and fifty-six characters. The Dao Lord arranged them into text, forming the *Great Brahmā Hidden Speech*, which he appended to the two chapters.

The Sovereign had once descended upon Mount Emei during the reign of the Yellow Emperor, transmitting the Method of the Three Ones and Five Sprouts, before ascending once more to heaven.

**Division of the Scripture’s Beginning, End, and Sections**

The Heavenly Worthy’s two chapters of scripture are bookended by prefaces, as are the *Great Brahmā Hidden Speech* before and after—all composed by the Dao Lord. Here, we separate the beginning and end, dividing the sections and organizing the characters and titles according to the repository text, totaling four thousand five hundred and seventy-four characters.

**Preface to the Two Chapters of the Supreme Purity Dao Lord**

**Postface to the Great Brahmā Hidden Speech**

**The Jade Dawn’s Illumination: Ten Recitations of the Scripture**

When the scripture is recited, it summons the hosts of the ten directions—those of the Primordial Ultimate and Primordial Measure—and the lands and peoples of the ten quarters come to hear the Dharma, their responses manifesting instantly.

**First Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the East arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Antai Tangxiang* in the *Nashan* world. The deaf regain their hearing.

**Second Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the South arrive floating through the void. The domain of *Wanli* in the *Benxian* world. The blind regain their sight.

**Third Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the West arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Futang Yuanxian* in the *Xing* world. The mute regain their speech.

**Fourth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the North arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Yuzhi Yeqing* in the *Leng* world. The lame and chronically ill rise and walk.

**Fifth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Northeast arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Fuji Xiang* in the *Chang’an* world. Chronic ailments and afflictions instantly restore their forms.

**Sixth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Southeast arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Yuanfutian* in the *Yongxian* world. White hair returns to black; fallen teeth regrow.

**Seventh Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Southwest arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Yanfu Xiang* in the *Ranjing* world. The aged regain their youth; the young grow strong.

**Eighth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Northwest arrive floating through the void. The realm of *Fude Ye* in the *Yanxian* world. Barren women conceive; birds and beasts bear young. All that is born or unborn attains completion.

**Ninth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Upper Realm arrive floating through the void. The palaces and towers of the *Yizhu* heavens.

**Tenth Recitation:** The perfected great spirits of the Lower Realm arrive floating through the void. The *Dongyuan* Nine Ramparts, the true traversal of the *Youfan* Four Sounds, the Thirty-Six Palaces of Heaven and Earth. Withered bones revive; all rise as whole persons.

**Preface to the Mysteries**
The Master said: The Dao speaks of the supreme and boundless upper grade, which is the great *Donghui* cyclonic fusion, the uppermost Dao of the *Duren* scripture. Of old, the *Shiqing* Heaven was the *Yulong Tengsheng* Heaven. *Dafuli* is the inner taboo name of the Heavenly Emperor. *Biluo* is the pulse of the *Shiqing* Heaven, like the meridians of a single body. The *Yuchen* Dao Lord first uttered these words, thus it is called the *Preface to the Mysteries*.

**Initiating the Kalpa**
The Master said: The Primordial Beginning summons the ten directions, meaning that when it is time to expound, at this kalpic turning, the charts are revealed and the teachings emerge, thus this scripture is spoken. First, the ten directions are summoned, as in the ten revolutions of the *Dadong*, calling the ten directions thrice, summoning the immortal officials as designated, calling the Three Officials of the Five Peaks. The Primordial Beginning Emperor expounds the scripture, thus it is called *Initiating the Kalpa*.

**True Response**
The Master said: When first approaching the throne, until the five colors surge and billow, this is the divine palace of the ten directions in the *Dadong* realm, the natural truth. Following the Heavenly Worthy’s summons, they respond and come to the assembly of *Dafuli*, ascending the *Jieren* Jeweled Terrace to hear the proclaimed scriptural Dharma, thus it is called *True Response*.

**Attaining the Ultimate**
The Master said: For seven days and seven nights, until the host of perfected ones attend the throne, this is the inner workings of the celestial mechanism, dividing the sevenfold cycle of day and night. The outer manifestation of numinous power produces the auspicious sign of the wheel halting for a time. Speaking inwardly, in the settled contemplation of seven days, one forgets day and night, observing the mind as the primordial mind, thereby perceiving the true primordial mind. Observing form as primordial form, one recognizes the original true form. When mind and form are wholly primordial, one naturally enters the Dao of primordial form, clearly beholding the sacred realm of *Yuqing*, the way of ascending in broad daylight, the method of entering samādhi. Those who have lost their original rank are thus called *Attaining the Ultimate*.

**Returning to the Origin**
The Master said: The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy on the mysterious throne, until all attain long life—this is the Dao of the Primordial Beginning Emperor expounding the scripture, the tenfold revolution of the Dharma, established in the generative numbers, completed in the consummative numbers of the Five Phases. Those who practice this Dao ascend in broad daylight, riding dragons and cranes to reach *Yuqing*, receiving the scriptures and becoming immortal lords. Clarifying this Dao ensures long life without death; applying this Dao verifies these ten great merits. The *mysterious throne* is the seat of the Dharmakāya. The *lion* is the numinous power of the Primordial Beginning. Speaking inwardly, the six qi and eight obscurities converge upon the heart, transforming into a lion within the lower cinnabar field. Thus, to the left is azure, to the right is white, in front is red, behind is black, and at the center is yellow, forming the image of the five-colored lion. Having fully realized the original rank, it is thus called *completing the Five Phases*, which is named *Returning to the Origin*.

**Mystery and Origin**
The Master said: The Dao speaks until *rejoicing in great peace*. This follows the auspicious responses of the Five Phases’ generation and completion, the ten revolutions of salvation, summoning the ten directions and the ten ranks of great spirits, all arriving simultaneously. Due to their towering merit and virtue, which cannot be measured, there arise transformations sweeping through nations and concerns of widespread peril. Thus, a single precious pearl is suspended, distinguishing the refinement and coarseness of the Dao’s grades, corresponding to the profundity or shallowness of the mysterious. Heavenly and mortal beings gaze upward but cannot fathom the subtlety of the millet-like pearl. The perfected and sages, following the transformations, all ascend into the depths of the *Naxuan*. Having received salvation, the Dao Lords and heavenly beings preserve their original years, all practicing the twelve virtuous minds, thereby aligning with the Dao of universal compassion and love, transforming alien bones into kin. Prior to this, when the men and women of a nation wholeheartedly turned in reverence, the heavenly beings of the ten directions entered the land of *Dafuli*. The *millet* is the chief of the five grains and the youngest of the myriad numbers, hence it is the origin of mysterious transformation, designating the chapters and grades.

**Expounding the Brahma**
The Master said: When the scripture first emerged as a teaching, until all attain salvation and deliverance—after the universal salvation of heavenly and mortal beings, the scriptural Dharma flows forth, emerging as teachings to deliver people. In any nation where the scripture is heard, even those who have not received the teachings but nurture a sincere aspiration for learning, and who initiate the sincerity of the great Dao, practicing the middle way and revering the four matters, attaining even one aspect, all achieve salvation and deliverance. The myriad heavens each practice the fourfold Brahma conduct, thus it is called *Yin Brahma*.

**Proclaiming the Secrets**
The Master said: The Dao speaks until *words beyond the world’s common speech*.

**The Secrets Proclaimed**
The two preceding chapters from the scriptures spoken by the Heavenly Worthy contain the inner names of the hundred spirits of the Great Cavern, as well as the inner taboos of the Heavenly Emperor, or the hidden names of demon kings and the hundred numina—thus they are called *Proclaiming the Secrets*.

**The Supreme Sages**
The Master said: The supreme sages have already become perfected persons, even to the point of transforming white bones into living beings. These are the great celestial perfected deities who have attained the status of the Three Clarities, responding to their inner virtue. Having penetrated the mysteries and investigated the subtleties, they fully grasp the scripture’s chapters and thus comprehend the secret taboos of the Great Cavern. Only then do the myriad heavens chant from afar, and the ten thousand emperors perform rites of reverence. Below the sun and moon, there is also the method of *great concentration*. Within concentration, one sees all the primordial Dao spirits, ghosts, demons, and essences manifest in bodily form, which may be commanded or questioned. If the power of concentration is not yet perfected, one cannot control or master them, and must rely on the *Nine Palaces’ Cavern-Viewing Method*.

**The Devoted Learners**
The Master said: The devoted learners cannot be reborn again. These devoted learners are attended by the Five Emperors, revered by the Three Realms, and joined by the distant chants of the myriad heavens and the rites of the ten thousand emperors—such cannot be spoken of in the same breath. Even those who save and deliver the dying, transforming white bones into living beings, cannot ascend by degrees to achieve such effects. Moreover, learners can only subdue and bind earthbound spirits and demonic essences, merely averting death, but cannot be reborn.

**Exhorting the Dao**
The Master said: To recite these chapters lightly is merely to have divine spirits guard one’s gate. If one has not received transmission from a master, nor observed fasting, bathing, and purification, and still neglects the visualization of inner cultivation, treating the rituals as common speech and mixing them with vulgar words, one will incur misfortune upon oneself. It would be better not to recite them at all—seeking blessings to avoid calamity, making offerings and revering the honored, one may thereby obtain auspiciousness. Thus it is called *Exhorting the Dao*.

**Praising the Mysteries**
The Master said: This scripture is most venerable and wondrous; its virtue and power are beyond compare. Within the Cavern of Mystery, this scripture wondrously enters the Dao of the Great Cavern, thus it is exalted above the Three Caverns and surpasses the mysteries of all teachings, uniquely traversing the Jade Capital. Above the Great Luo Heaven lies the Mountain of the Jade Capital, where golden towers, seven-jeweled jade terraces, and the Purple Tenuity’s upper palace stand. There are thirty-six Jade Capital Halls, each with eaves spanning ten thousand leagues, encircling an area of five thousand five hundred leagues. At its center lies the Upper Palace of the Jade Void, where the Radiant Sovereign of Numinous Treasure, the Perfected Lord of the Dao, uniquely presides over this scripture. The ten thousand perfected and ten thousand sages pay homage thrice daily, making it the source of the myriad Dao. Majestic is this mysterious scripture, the supreme great Brahma—its primordial virtue is matchless, its primordial power unrivaled. Thus it is called *Praising the Mysteries*.

**Cultivating and Reciting**
The Master said: The Dao speaks: In all recitation... to roam and feast in the Jade Capital. The Master instructed those who have received the scripture: If one does not cultivate and uphold it but merely recites the scripture ten times, this mysterious response arises for the sake of one’s ancestors. All beings are born with an indestructible numinous nature, eternally cycling through kalpas, whether born in the four continents, the six paths, manifesting among the four kinds of birth, or dwelling within the Three Realms. All sentient beings are our fathers and mothers. Therefore, learners possess two great virtues: first, compassion—refraining from killing or harming, lest they mistakenly injure their sovereigns, teachers, or parents from past kalpas; second, purity—refraining from lust and desire, lest they defile or offend the three teachers of transformation, the Dharma-body of those who have left the household life, or their sovereigns, teachers, and parents from past kalpas. Thus, when learners cultivate and recite, they should first repay the countless generations of ancestors, delivering the suffering souls of the hidden departed, who then ascend to the Vermilion Palace. Those who undergo the refining disciplines of the Vermilion Mound’s ranks—those who achieve liberation of the corpse in broad daylight, or those who reverse their forms in the Great Yin—are refined for seven years to attain the rank of immortals. Their descendants are delivered to the Azure Palace, and the souls they uplift to the Vermilion Palace are refined for nine years, reborn as noble persons. If their spiritual nature is unobscured and they diligently study the scripture, their merit complete and virtue perfected, they all become immortals, ascending to the Golden Towers of the Upper Clarity Heaven, permitted to roam and feast in the Great Luo’s Jade Capital. Those who diligently study the scripture have not obscured their spiritual nature from past lives, and their merit surpasses that of mere reciters. Even if they are not noble persons, they will surely achieve liberation of the corpse within nine years. If they pursue fame and nobility, they will ascend through the Nine Passes in nine years to become renowned and noble. Those whose dull natures are bound by karma and whose merit is consumed often fall back into suffering souls. How can they compare to the pure and humble learners, whose lives are guided by diligent study, free from karmic obstacles, and who are certain to attain the Dao and ascend as immortals?

**The Advanced Learners**
The Master said: The advanced learners... roam the great void. The preceding refers to those who have received and recited the scripture, penetrating the mysteries and investigating the subtleties. This refers to advanced learners who both cultivate and recite, yet cannot deliver their countless generations of ancestors, only attaining deliverance for themselves. They ascend to the Southern Palace, becoming scholars in the world. Those who approach a master to receive and recite the scripture may extend their years and live long, and when their destined cycles come to an end, they all achieve the Dao of liberation of the corpse. Their souls are not extinguished, nor do they pass through hell, but immediately regain their forms and roam the great void. The methods of liberation of the corpse include the *Great Cavern’s Five Stones’ Life-Securing Method*: when the body decays and rots, the five viscera regenerate on their own. When the allotted years are fulfilled, the Great One unites with the spirit, and one is reborn with the body of a true immortal, receiving the scripture and ascending the Dao. Dwelling in the cavern heavens, their merit and virtue complete, they are appointed to the rank of high perfected. There is also the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*, the Dao of the Great Lord of Longevity who guards the primal unity: when the physical form perishes, the body is entrusted to the heavy Yin, the spirit guards the hundred passes, and the five viscera regenerate on their own. When the allotted years are fulfilled, spirit and form unite, and one ascends to the Ten Heavens, receiving the scripture and attaining rank. On the day their merit is complete, they are appointed as perfected persons. There are also those who wear the precepts of the Nine Perfected on their bodies, reflect the talismans of the Golden Register in their hearts, receive the mysterious scriptures, their merit manifest in the Three Heavens, their virtue harmonizing with the Five Constants. Their spirit and qi are inwardly whole, but if their merit and virtue are not yet complete and their destined cycles return them to darkness, they are still ranked: those who achieve liberation in broad daylight are foremost, those who do so at midnight are next.

Those whose complexion remains unchanged, whose nails do not turn pale, and whose eyes do not darken are the immortals of corpse-liberation. Their ethereal souls temporarily dissolve, their lives pass through the Great Yin, and their forms return to the Palace of Vermilion Clarity. They do not traverse hell but roam the vast heavens, traversing the Ten Heavens, receiving the scriptures and ascending the Dao. When their merit is complete and the Dao fulfilled—after thirty, seventy, or one hundred twenty years—they, prompted by others, awaken the Dark Palace. Spirit and form unite, and they ascend to the Three Heavens, where they are ranked and appointed as perfected immortals according to their grade.

There are also the supreme sages and lofty perfected who, having enlightened the world to its true nature, ascend in secret to the Highest Clarity, leaving behind their caps and swords. Those below the Great Clarity who rely on talismans, elixirs, or methods of the Eighth Rank—such as miscellaneous arts for resolving calamities, evading the world, or substituting forms with staffs and sandals—cannot return to their former homes. They are inevitably seized by the Three Offices and do not share the same rank as the previous four grades of corpse-liberation immortals.

**Expounding the Subtle Chapter**
The Master said: This scripture is subtle and wondrous, bestowing grace upon life and death. It speaks of the highest perfected sages who receive deliverance and preserve the cosmic order, ensuring the heavens endure forever. It extends to all heavenly beings, preserving their allotted years, and none fail to receive deliverance. In clarity, it can deliver beings beyond measure; in obscurity, it can rescue the dead and liberate the departed. Thus, it bestows grace upon life and death, expounding the most subtle wonders among all scriptures. Each must abide by the regulations of their original rank.

**Pledging the Covenant Chapter**
The Master said: What heaven treasures most is the perpetual servitude of ghost officials. If a person of attainment offers gold and treasures, pledges sincerity, and swears an oath to heaven before transmitting this scripture, and should they lightly disclose or profane it, calamity will extend to their nine generations. Moreover, all worldly people are bound by the prohibition against transmission. This is a treasured scripture of heaven, concealed in the Mysterious Capital. If one carelessly profanes it, the consequences will not merely afflict nine generations. They will be consigned to the perpetual servitude of ghost officials, including those of the Northern Bureau, the Three Offices that govern ghostly servitude. Previously, careless recitation brought harm to oneself; now, careless transmission brings harm to one’s ancestors. Only by keeping the covenant, sealing one’s lips, and practicing in accordance with the regulations can one ascend the ladder to perfected attainment.

**Mysterious Bureau Chapter**
The Master said: Those who serve the scriptures of the Five Emperors, down to those who receive the scriptures in their own bodies...

The Master said: When a covenant master transmits the scriptures, the Five Emperors each dispatch twenty-four jade lads and jade maidens to encamp and guard the sacred writ, preside over the prohibition, burn incense, and protect the body of the recipient. Should one disclose it to a single person, one jade lad or maiden is punished, and the matter is promptly reported to the Five Emperors, who memorialize the Most High. These are the spirits of the Five Phases, the four seasons, the Nine Palaces, and the twenty-four qi—totaling two hundred forty in all—who attend and guard the Five Emperors. Without a covenant master to transmit the scriptures, how could there be the regulations for encampment, guardianship, and prohibition?

**Three Origins Chapter**
The Master said: The Dao speaks of ascending to fly and rise to the Upper Clarity. The first month’s Upper Origin is fitting for delivering the souls of past generations. The seventh month’s Middle Origin is for delivering oneself. The tenth month’s Lower Origin is for pacifying the state and securing the people. On the eight nodal days, one dispels the disasters of the nine lands and averts the calamities of the eight nodes. Reciting and chanting toward their directions, aligning with the palaces and establishing the pointer, one’s merit is recorded by the Five Emperors, and one’s virtue transforms the nine lands—thus attaining the rank of Perfected of the Nine Palaces. This is precisely: three on the left, seven on the right, nine worn on the crown, one trodden beneath; two and four form the shoulders, six and eight the feet; the body abides in the Central Palace, securing the five. This is the Dao of the Nine Origins of the Upper Clarity, the Vast and Unobstructed. On the day of one’s original destiny, the day of the inception of one’s primal qi, reciting and chanting stabilizes the hun-soul and restrains the po-soul, preserves life and pacifies the person, clarifies and rectifies the five viscera, and gathers the myriad qi into the body. Next, on the day of one’s counterpart destiny, reciting twice ensures one escapes suffering and affliction, the body radiates light, and practicing this merit summons the attendants of the Three Realms, the Five Emperors to receive one, and the myriad spirits to pay homage—one’s name is inscribed in the heavens above. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one ascends to fly and rise to the Upper Clarity. Now, the day of one’s original birth—for example, if it is a *jiazi* day, then the *jiawu* day is the day of one’s counterpart destiny. The Upper Clarity lies above the Four Brahmā Heavens, within the Three Clarities. The first is the Great Clarity, twelve heavens where the Nine Immortals dwell. Above it is the Upper Clarity, twelve heavens where the Nine Perfected dwell. Highest is the Jade Clarity, twelve heavens where the Nine Sages dwell—thirty-six heavens in all. The Upper Clarity resides above the Great Clarity and below the Jade Clarity.

**Practicing the Dao Chapter**
The Master said: The Dao speaks of the day for practicing the Dao... so clearly distinguished.

The methods include visualization incantations and oral formulas, all detailed in this section.

The Three Qi are: Mysterious Qi (azure), Primordial Qi (yellow), and Original Qi (white)—these are the Three Qi. From the One Qi arise the Three Qi; from the Three Qi arise the Nine Qi; from the Nine Qi arise the Ten Thousand Qi. The lord of the Three Qi, the honored of the One Qi, is the Primordial Celestial Worthy. The ancestor of the Nine Qi is the Azure Lad Dao Lord. The mother of the Ten Thousand Qi is the Queen Mother of the West. Humans dwell within the Three Qi, transforming and responding to the gods of the Three Ones—the perfect and constant supreme Dao, the root and origin of the Ten Thousand Qi.

**Secret Incantations Chapter**
The Master said: "Primordial Supreme Mysterious Origin, when present, face east to recite the scriptures. For petitions to the Great Clarity, address only the Five Numinous Venerable Lords to summon forth the gods of one’s body. For petitions to the Upper Clarity, address only the True Primordial Teaching Master, the Most High Lord Lao. For petitions to the Jade Clarity, address only the Most High Dao Lord. The meaning of the petition and scripture recitation to summon forth the gods of one’s body has already been detailed in this section. Facing east to recite scriptures is because the east is the direction of longevity, revered by all the heavens. All talismans and sacred writings of the Numinous Treasure should be inscribed facing east, drawing forth the qi of the Thirty-Two Heavens to spread it—divine efficacy will arrive instantly. All those who practice the Dao must begin and end facing east."

**Cavernous Mystery Chapter**
The Master said: "Primordial Cavernous Mystery, reaching to the union and separation of the natural... These twenty-four characters form the opening of the *Cavernous Mystery* original chapter. *Primordial* is the ancestor of the Ten Thousand Dao. *Origin* is the origin of the multitude of qi. *Cavernous* is divine and numinous response. *Mystery* is transformation and radiance beyond measure. *Numinous* is the fulfillment of all prayers. *Treasure* is the root of immortals and sages. These six characters are the ancestor of the Ten Thousand Dao, the origin of the multitude of qi, returning to the Great Cavern—divine and numinous response, transformation and radiance beyond measure, the fulfillment of prayers and transformation into treasure, thus forming the wondrous beginning of the highest grade. The *Ten Recitations for Deliverance* have already clarified this section. The purport of this chapter lies in the hidden rhymes of the Hundred Demons, sometimes separated, sometimes united, neither forcibly harmonized nor regulated by tonal patterns, but arising naturally of themselves. The Hundred Demons are the kings of the Great Demon Lords of the Nine Empyreans, who attend upon the Celestial Worthy Primordial Origin. They are the descendants of the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Qi Imperial Lineage: the Jade Clarity King of the Divine Empyrean, the Purple Empyrean Jade Clarity Demon-Quelling King, the Vermilion Empyrean Central Ultimate Radiance-Preserving King, the Azure Empyrean Jade Clarity Cavernous Brightness Womb King; next, the Jade Empyrean Wondrous Transformation King; then the Kings of the Great Empyrean, Scenic Empyrean, Azure Empyrean, and Jade Empyrean—all emperors of the Great Demons. Following them are the Great Demons of the Nine Heavens, the Great Demons of the Three Heavens, the Great Demons of the Three Realms, the Great Demons of the Three Clarities, the Great Demons of the Five Emperors, the Great Demons of the Five Heavens, the Demon Kings of all the heavens, and the Demon Lords of the Brahmā Heavens. Then come the demons of the Three Ministries of Heavenly Ministers and the Great Mystery, as well as non-demons, numinous demons, controlling demons, divine demons, and so forth—down to the hidden rhymes of the Great Demons of the Six Heavens, all contained within this second chapter. With the rhymes of the Hundred Demons of the Cavernous Mystery, separated and united naturally to form the chapter, profound and unfathomable, only the Primordial Origin fully comprehends it to expound these two chapters. The *Ten Recitations for Deliverance* is thus also called *Cavernous Mystery*. Those who respond to deliverance universally receive it. What follows is the solemn proclamation of the decrees of all the heavens."

**Universal Proclamation Chapter**
The Master said: "Universally proclaim to the Three Realms, reaching to the coercion and reunion with ghostly fetters. The Three Realms are: the Upper Primordial Realm of the Ultimate Divine Land, the Middle Yellow Springs Court, and the Lower Northern Capital of Luo and Deng. The Three Officials are: the Upper Primordial Heavenly Official of the Purple Tenuity Palace, the Middle Earthly Official of the Azure Florescence Terrace, and the Lower Water Official of the Clear and Cold Palace. The Nine Bureaus are: one official with three bureaus, dividing the registers of water and fire for examination—thus, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus. The Twelve River Sources are the twelve terrestrial divisions, each with a watercourse source, flowing into the Primordial Ultimate Mixed Sea and returning to the source of the Draining Waters. The deliverance of ancestors and forebears, extending to karmic kin of countless kalpas, swiftly erases the ledgers of sins, extinguishes evil roots, preventing further confinement, allowing moment-by-moment ascension, avoiding coercion and reunion with ghostly fetters. The Twelve River Sources drain into the Celestial River, the source of the Eastern Well. The sun, moon, and eight luminaries refine and forge the Golden Immortals. The Eastern Well’s Yellow Waters govern the Flowering Spirit Pool, where bathing renews one’s radiance. This is detailed in the *Scripture of the Three Dao Following the Upper Clarity*. This is also the place for refining and delivering the hun and shen. The preceding forty-eight characters are the proclamation to the Three Realms."

**Talismanic Decree Chapter**
The Master said: "The Primordial Talismanic Decree, reaching to wandering carefree in the Upper Clarity. The Three Paths are the karmic retributions of hell, hungry ghosts, and animals. There are also the labors of the Heavenly, Earthly, and Water Officials. The Five Sufferings are: sorrow, illness, death, the grave, and severance. There are also water, fire, wind, the blade, royal law, famine, and pestilence. There are also boiling cauldrons, furnaces, slaughter, icy pools, and torture. There are also the Five Suffering Entanglements of form, desire, emotion, love, and nobility. The Three Paths and Five Sufferings together form the Eight Difficulties. The sixty-four characters are the Primordial Talismanic Decree. The two kinds of talismanic proclamations are found in the Yellow Register Retreat Methods."

**Sacred Taboo Chapter**
The Master said: "In the heavens of the Upper Clarity, reaching to the Brahmā conduct."

The Brahmā-conduct is the Dao within the Dao, the Heaven within Heaven, the Mystery within Mystery, the true emptiness of the primordial obstruction. Above the Three Realms and below the Jade Clarity, above the Upper Clarity, there is the Heavenly Emperor named the Jade True Heavenly Emperor, who is the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Supreme Emperor of the Lofty Dark Vault, governing the realm of the formless Brahmā-conduct—this is the celestial realm of the Seed People.

Below this are the thirty-two heavens, where the emperors’ tabooed names and hidden titles, the concealed rhymes of jade tones, are spoken of as the Heavenly Worthies’ secret taboos, or the hidden sounds of heavenly demons, or the inner names of luminous gods, or the wondrous tones of celestial spirits. Their subtlety is unfathomable, their mystery unplumbed. Nine harmonies enable transformation; ten unions enable transmutation. The primordial exhausts divine response; the boundless holds profound principles. Mysterious transformations and wondrous changes occur in the Upper Clarity—hence it is called the Sacred Taboo.

Moreover, the celestial decrees of this Heavenly Emperor are inscribed as contracts to deliver boundless beings.

**Receiving Deliverance Chapter**
The Master said: "Today is a joyous celebration, reaching the Gate of Heaven."
These twenty-eight characters form the great contract for announcing at the Gate of Heaven. When the delivered souls receive the Heavenly Worthy’s contract and talismanic decree, they announce to the demon kings of the Three Realms, ensuring their passage to the Gate of Heaven without hindrance.

The thirty-two Heavenly Emperors’ contracts for ascending to heaven conceal within them the Jade Emperor’s inner text, including the sixty-eight characters of the Human Sovereign’s script, totaling three hundred thirty-nine characters.

**Five Phases Chapter**
The Master said: "The Eastern Dipper records destiny... to the primordial surpassing of the myriad spirits."
All arise from the Red Clarity, emerge from the Five Kalpas, and govern the Five Directions to deliver heavenly and human beings.

**Guarding the True Chapter**
The Master said: "Green Heaven Demon King... to the ranks proclaimed in the Upper Clarity."
These are the commands for support, sweeping, and purging, ordering demon-slaying spirits to serve as vanguards—all are the resplendent great spirits of the Jade Clarity. The Divine Duke is the Supreme Minister of the Great Mystery.

These thirty-two characters are the mandate the Divine Duke received from the Primordial Beginning, and may also serve as the incantation of the Thunder Spirit. When one feels fear or timidity, knock the teeth thirty-two times, visualize oneself as the Divine Duke, and recite it ten times—then the myriad demons will flee, and a thousand specters will vanish.

**Jade Calendar Chapter**
The Master said: "Primordial Cavern Jade Calendar... to the natural operation of deliverance."
This is the essential form of the Great Cavern’s true text. The Jade Calendar records the unfolding of the Five Kalpas and the transitions of billions of kalpas.

The Great Cavern is the Primal Cavern. During the Dragon Han and Yan Kang kalpas, the Great Cavern remained undivided. Above were thirty-six qi, below thirty-six marshes—all were the qi of metal, water, fierce winds, and Brahmā marshes, without color or light. By the Red Clarity kalpa, the Primordial Beginning opened the chart, and the movements responded to the unfolding. Calculations extended, and forms naturally divided, giving rise to the true text of the Red Script.

"Deliverance" means one degree per day. "Kalpa" refers to the great and small kalpic cycles. A small kalpa occurs when yang reaches its ninth extreme and generates yin, or yin reaches its hundred-sixth extreme and generates yang, with water disasters and fire calamities alternating to renew beings. A great kalpa occurs when the Jade Clarity Heaven’s Wan Chang Terrace—a hundred-jeweled jade platform, ninety thousand *li* high and sixty thousand *li* wide—receives the first degree of the sun and moon’s emergence each day. Heavenly beings ascend the terrace, chant the Cavern Chapter, gather the morning essence of the sun and moon, pluck branches of azure celestial jewels to brush the light of the sun and moon, and collect the finest mustard-seed pearls of azure celestial essence, casting them into the Western Primordial City. When the robes of the heavenly beings are brushed clean of all jewels, azure essence, and mustard-seed pearls, filling the Western City, one kalpa is complete. At this time, heaven and earth clash, water, fire, and wind disasters purge the filth across the sky, and all below the Three Realms is destroyed. The Dragon Gate converges, the Raven Mother delivers the kalpa’s passage, and the Seed People descend to assist the Sagely Lord of Great Peace.

From the Yan Kang and Dragon Han kalpas to the opening of the Red Clarity’s chart, billions of kalpas have passed.

**Red Script Chapter**
The Master said: "Primal Cavern Red Script... to the primordial text unborn."
Since the jade characters arose before the Great Brahmā, until the Red Clarity’s chart opened, they became the Red Script. Before enlightenment, they were concealed within the Primal Cavern—also called the sixty-four characters of the Red Script, illuminated in the marsh’s register. In inner contemplation, they are the Dao of the Great Cavern’s jade characters merging. They are also lost within inner practices and not further expounded.

**Great Brahmā Chapter**

The Master said: "This is the Great Brahmā, extending to the vast array of pure radiance. The Great Brahmā is the essence of the Great Cavern. Above all heavens, there is the Heavenly Emperor of the Great Luo, with Yu Luo Xiao Terrace, formed of seven treasures within the empty mystery. The terrace has nine tiers, towering into the vastness of the firmament, standing atop the Jade Mountain’s peak in the White Jade Capital. Its height reaches the utmost primordial above—this is the Mystic Capital governed by the Primordial Lord of Jade Clarity in the Great Luo. Its kalpas stretch boundlessly, beyond perception, neither existing nor absent, without fixed location. Above are the Three Flowers Hall, the Departure Palace, the Palace of Great Possession, and the Palace of Wondrous Courts, golden towers and jade chambers, the vast array of upper halls, and the two pure radiant pools. Speaking inwardly, these are the nine palaces of the mud-pill. The Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Primordial Lord dwells, aligns with the nine palaces spoken of in the Highest Clarity—this is precisely the Dao of the inner audience with the Primordial Lord."

**Qi of the Brahmā Chapter**
The Master said: "The great practice of Brahmā qi reaches the immeasurable salvation of beings. This is the secret essence of the Great Cavern, circulating through the ten directions, also the tenfold salvation of beings, the root of the five phases’ generation and completion. Within it is the divine power of salvation and immortality, the August One, the Venerable Sovereign. The Lord of Longevity at the Southern Culmen, the Supreme One, the Red Child, divides his form into the Nine Perfected. The Marshal of Salvation, the great spirit, is the spirit of the Great One. The Elder Han, who cherishes life, is the True Person Elder within the heart. The Supervisors of Fate and Records in the Southern Upper, along with the Lord of Turning Bones and Reviving the Dead, reside in the Lower Primordial, extending life and increasing destiny to guard the Elder in the Middle Primordial, while the Lord of Salvation from Calamity and Ascension assists the One in the Upper Primordial. All gather qi from the Nine Heavens, and the Nine Heavens gather qi in the Supreme Tenuity. The qi of the Supreme Tenuity’s Brahmā is the qi of the Highest Mystic Cavern, the mist that dispels negativity. Entering the adept’s body, it immediately brings immortality. Practicing for three years, one attains the Dao. This has already been lost within the original scripture."

**Summoning the Perfected Chapter**
The Master said: "Today’s collation and recording extend to the strict examination of all heavens. At the beginning of the Red Clarity kalpa, within the Primordial Azure Heaven, in the Great Floating Li Land, on the day of opening the collation charts and records, the divine kings and great sages of all heavens presided over their celestial registers, descending to the imperial terrace to weigh the gravity of sins and blessings, recording the depth of merits and transgressions. In Jade Clarity, there is the Eight Sceneries Hidden Mystery Luo Chart; in Highest Clarity, the Twenty-Four Qi Eight Sceneries Mystery Chart—all charts opened by the Primordial Lord, along with the primordial charts of the heavens’ Brahmā qi. The records are: the Upper Primordial’s golden record script, the Middle Primordial’s jade record script, and the Lower Primordial’s yellow record script. There are also the Jade Clarity Flying Transformation Mystery Record Treasure Chart, the Highest Clarity Azure Perfected Purple Record Dawn Chart, and all heavens below the Grand Clarity possess their own charts and records, numbering in the billions, impossible to enumerate fully. All proceed to the presence of the Primordial Lord of the Dao to be collated. These ten directions’ great sages hold exalted ranks, equal in station to the Lord of the Dao, yet serve under the Primordial Lord. The five-colored mystery dragons are not forms with appearance but transform through the qi of the five phases’ supreme mystery. The nine-colored nodes are azure, yellow, red, white, dark green, jade green, green, crimson, and purple—nine-colored feathers forming the nodes. The ten divine silken cords are formed within the five divine brocades, serving as the divine cords. Flying clouds are the light, pure, soaring, and efflorescent rosy clouds, riding the cinnabar jade chariot and azure jasper brush. Above is the canopy of five-colored mystery feathers, below the forest of hundred-word jasper and jade. Some ride the vermilion phoenix with trailing banners, or guide the five-colored mystery dragons. The Five Elders open the path, the Wei Immortals adorn the shafts. Inclining their light, they descend and turn their chariots to the terrace, overseeing the multitudes of perfected in all heavens, universally collating the salvation of beings. Those who hold records and grasp registers are the prime ministers of all heavens, presiding over collation. The one who determines ranks is the Elder Han, Supervisor of Affairs. The overseers of beings’ salvation, the great spirits of the Nine Heavens, all proceed to the presence of the Primordial Lord of the Dao. According to their ranks, the thirty-six qi descend, and below are the thirty-six marshes—all qi of metal, water, firm winds, and Brahmā marshes, without color or light. At the Red Clarity kalpa, the Primordial Lord opened the charts, responding to the movement and beginning the reckoning. The degrees of salvation naturally divide forms, and only then do the true texts of the Red Script appear. Salvation occurs once daily. A kalpa is the great or small cycle of kalpic destiny. A small kalpa occurs when yang reaches its ninth extremity and generates yin, or yin reaches its hundred-sixth extremity and generates yang, with water disasters and fire calamities alternating, renewing all beings. The great kalpa occurs when in the Jade Clarity Heaven there is the Wan Chang Terrace, made of a hundred treasures and jade stones, nine myriad miles high and six myriad miles wide. Each dawn, as the sun and moon first rise, the heavenly people ascend the terrace, singing the Cavern Hymns and gathering the morning blossoms of the sun and moon, plucking branches of empty azure treasure to brush the light of the sun and moon, taking the finest mustard-seed pearls of empty azure and casting them into the Western Primordial City. When the people’s garments are brushed clean of treasure stones, empty azure, and mustard-seed pearls, filling the Western City, this constitutes one kalpa. At this time, heaven and earth clash, water, fire, and wind disasters sweep away filth across the sky, and all below the Three Realms are destroyed. The Dragon Gate converges, the Raven Mother delivers the kalpa’s passage, and the Seed People descend to assist the Sagely Lord of Great Peace. From the Yan Kang and Dragon Han kalpas to the opening of the Red Clarity’s chart, billions of kalpas have passed."

**Flowing Transformation Chapter**
The Master said: "Since the Primordial Lord’s pacification and stabilization, the myriad patterns have unfolded. From the beginning of the chart’s opening, the Primordial Lord’s five true texts of the Red Script descended to pacify and stabilize the five directions, commanding the Five Emperors to govern and transform, nurturing beings, stabilizing and aiding salvation, preserving heaven’s eternal existence. Even through kalpic destiny, it remains uncorrupted. The Three Strategies endure as before, with the qi of the Great Brahmā’s jade characters pervading all heavens. From this, the myriad patterns of the Three Realms unfold. The above sixty-four characters, together with these thirty-two characters, are the ultimate will of heaven and earth, the Brahmā sounds of the Numinous Treasure, the original scripture of the Mystic Cavern. For pacification, exorcism, and governance, use them at will to immediately obtain numinous response."

With the heart dwelling on the Primordial Lord and the mouth reciting this chapter, the qi summons the northwest—this is the mudra of the Jade Purity. The *Dark Texts of Delusion* are now transcended.

**Ascent to the Primordial Chapter**
The Master said: The Primordial Net unfolds, its qi entering the Mysterious of Mysteries. The Primordial Net is the guiding principle of the Primordial Cavern, the axis of the Primal Chaos. It flows through the thirty-two heavens, revolving through the five-colored realms, circling the ten directions, beginning anew after completion. From the Dipper’s leftward revolution through the degrees of the Winnowing Basket, it traces the divisions of the sun and moon, accomplishing the great transformation of the Five Emperors. In thirty-five divisions—thirty-two heavens and three heavens—its qi converges. Within the unfolding of the Upper Primordial, it revolves through the Primordial-Colored Realm, darkly uniting with the qi of the Jade Purity’s Eight Luminaries Heaven, entering the Heaven within Heaven, the Mysterious within the Mysterious.

Speaking inwardly, the Primordial Net of the body is the Mud-Pill Palace. Day and night, it circulates qi and blood, completing its cycle through the body, converging in the Upper Primordial. The Three Divisions, Eight Luminaries, and twenty-four qi—revolving through the Jade Purity Palace and the Mud-Pill Palace—unite the true feminine and true masculine with the Eight Luminaries, totaling thirty-two qi. The Three Primordials and Three Qi converge in the Upper Primordial’s Mysterious Palace, descending to connect with the pericardium’s eight vessels, darkly uniting with the Lower Primordial’s Eight Luminaries.

There exists the *Chart of the Mysterious Net*, which explores the way of ingesting the flowing qi of heaven, fully expounded in this section. To contract the Mysterious is the method.

**Contracting the Mysterious Chapter**
The Master said: Within the Mysterious dwells the Supreme August, extending to assist the ten thousand immortals. The Supreme August within the Mysterious is the Queen Mother, mother of the myriad qi of the Lower Primordial, the divine spirit of eternal life. She is the Dao Lord of the Supreme Emperor, the sacred perfected of the Supreme August, dwelling in the Great Rosy Cloud Palace of the Western Primordial. She chants the empty and cavernous numinous chapters, ceaselessly generating the myriad qi. In her left hand, she grasps the Golden Perfected Jade Radiance; in her right, she brandishes the Flowing Gold Fire Bell. Its resonance flows through the thirty-five heavens, its sound responding to the cloud encampments of the Heaven within Heaven. The jade tones gather the Upper Primordial’s qi; the numinous winds assemble the smoke of the *pifei*. The purple luminaries flourish in the Great Void, and the ten thousand immortals assist and attend in homage—this is the great esoteric method of the *Great Cavern’s Revolving Wind and Primal Union*.

The *cloud encampments* are not camps of gathered clouds but the encampments of revolving and instantaneous movement. The marvel lies in the sixteen characters: *Golden Perfected shining bright, its resonance flows through the cloud encampments; jade tones gather qi, numinous winds assemble smoke.* These are the great prohibitions of the heavens, not to be lightly revealed. They are concealed within the opening chapter of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, awaiting the worthy to seek and examine them, thereby contracting the true Mysterious.

**Perfection of the True Chapter**

The Master said: A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions—this is the ultimate safeguard of life and the root of generation. With this esoteric method, blend and merge one thousand times, totaling ten thousand repetitions, and you shall naturally attain perfection. Within perfection dwells the spirit, the Lord of Longevity, foremost among the Nine Perfected.

The Noble Youth of Primordial Florescence is the spirit of the liver, governing the *hun*. The Venerable White Prime is the spirit of the lungs, governing the *po*. The Supreme Unity is the Lord of Life, master of qi; Peach Radiance and Union of Longevity govern essence. Together, they hold the five talismans and five registers of your destiny, preserving the root of your life’s origin. When the five spirits merge, the hundred spirits transform.

**Chapter of the Flowering Salutation**

The Master said: Ascend to the Supreme Clarity, where the myriad qi unite as immortals. Supreme Clarity is the flowering chamber of the heart. The Supreme Unity contains the lotus, its form naturally arising. The Primordial Sovereign of the Supreme Unity resides there, like the heart of a lotus bud—unopened cinnabar blossom. The eight hidden meridians converge in this place, all gathering within the heart. Within the subtlest of subtleties, the primordial qi flows, circulating through the wellspring’s source. Like the veins of plants and trees, these are the pathways of the body’s crimson script and blood vessels, the encampments of its defense.

The governance of the five qi within is the refinement of the five spirits’ wondrous qi at the Central Origin. The five spirits unify the eight hidden blood vessels in profound union. When the hundred spirits revolve ten times in their numinous return, the myriad qi unite as immortals.

Within the heart’s center lies water, called *spirit-water*. Drink of it, and demons and spirits shall behold you as the crimson sun. These seven spirits are the Mysterious Cinnabar of the Supreme Unity, the gods of the Central Dipper: Yang Brightness. The Noble Youth of Primordial Florescence is the Supreme Unity of the Northern Culmen. Within the human body, they are the original form of the Yellow Supreme Emperor. The Lord of Longevity is Yang Brightness. The Noble Youth of Non-Florescence is Yin Essence. The Venerable White Prime is the Supreme Unity of the Northern Culmen. The Perfected One, the Lifespan Lord, is the Ninth Cinnabar and Primordial Cinnabar; Peach Radiance is the Great Lord; Mysterious Darkness. The Great Spirit of Union and Longevity is the Radiant Light.

**Chapter of the Three Realms**

The Master said: The Dao of immortality values life, ascending to the midst of soaring emptiness. The Desire Realm lies lowest, its domain the Six Heavens. Those who cultivate three hundred virtuous deeds may be reborn in the Form Realm. Those who maintain the Three Pure Practices—purifying body, mind, and speech—may be reborn in the Formless Realm. Those who purify the three karmas and remain unstained by the six senses may be reborn in this heaven. If both dust and karma are purified, one is born among the Seed People. Beyond this lies the attainment of the natural origin, the realm of the Great Cavern.

The *Song of the Three Realms* is the melody sung by the Demon King as he soars through the void, following the Jade Clarity. *A-da* is the Demon King’s self-designation.

**Chapter of Reverent Form**

The Master said: The Demon King reveres form, extending to the seven ancestral elders. This refers to the cessation of the *Song of the Three Realms*, which is not part of the two canonical chapters. From *Demon King* to *regeneration*, these thirty-two characters are admonitions to restrain earthly attachments, urging scholars of the recitation to show reverence.

**Chapter of Heavenly Treasure**

The Master said: The Dao declares that what heaven treasures is not transmitted to the lower world. According to the Mysterious Regulations, the Heavenly Perfected are transmitted once every forty thousand kalpas. If one pledges gold and treasures with a sincere heart, following the ancient statutes and swearing oaths before the Ten Heavens, only then may transmission be granted.

The ancient statutes decree that the Perfected and the ordinary have ranks. After forty thousand kalpas, the Perfected One, in accordance with the Crimson Palace’s immortal statutes and the Great Perfected’s alliance rituals, may transmit once every forty years.

**Chapter of Universal Salvation**

The Master said: The Dao speaks of heaven and earth, extending to the universal salvation of the primordial limit. This refers to the dissolution of all inauspiciousness through boundless scriptures, universally saving the limitless.

**Chapter of Yin Refinement**

The Master said: Those who study the Dao superficially must refine the corpse’s form to attain immortality. As described in the preceding *Chapter of Learning*, the method of refining and transforming the corpse’s form derives from the *Scripture of the Five Refinements of the Numinous Treasure for Generating the Corpse*, specifically the *Chapter of the Nine Refinements for Life and Transformation*, clarifying its essentials in the *Section on Ascension and Salvation*.

**Chapter of Preservation and Pacification**

The Master said: The Dao speaks of heaven and earth, extending to the universal salvation of heaven and humanity. This method of preservation and pacification has been lost in the various sections.

**Chapter of the Utmost Words**

The Master said: The Dao declares that whoever possesses this scripture shall attain immeasurable merit and virtue, boundless mysterious transformation, and responsive retribution of sin and blessing. The common person, ignorant of its reality, must diligently practice, while the superior person deeply comprehends its profound principles. Only on the day of attaining the Dao shall one fully understand the scripture’s most wondrous words and the true efficacy of its numinous responses.

**Chapter of the Great Cavern**

The Master said: This is the middle section. The sounds of the Great Brahma’s jade script in all heavens, the hidden language of the thirty-two heavens’ primordial measure—these are the ancestral qi of the Primordial Beginning, the forbidden chapters within the *Numinous Writ*, composed by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. Within it lies the secret taboo of the Great Cavern’s recollection, the sounds of the five kalpas’ unfolding diagrams, drawn from the *Scripture of the Jade Characters of the Inner Sounds of All Heavens*. Its hidden mysteries point to profound depths; you may examine them in detail. Take care never to reveal them to the ears and eyes of the unworthy, lest you evade heaven’s decree. Practice it in silence.

**Chapter of the Mysterious Response**

The Master said: Those who know its sounds shall attain the Mysterious Response by reciting them alone.

**Chapter of the Sovereign**

The Master said: The *Supreme Wondrous Scripture of the Primordial Measure for Salvation of Humanity* consists entirely of titles designated by the Dao Lord. This chapter is the internal title given by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. The four lines of *Supreme Wondrous* to *Naturally* (sixteen characters in total) summarize the scripture’s central purpose and great meaning. The assembled perfected ones also say that the five directional true writs are concealed within this scripture.

From *Merging the Cavern* to *Salvation of Humanity* is the main text spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. From *Now* to *All Heavens* records the instructions for salvation received by the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. From *Universally Proclaiming* to *Supreme Clarity* contains the commands and divine works bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, as recorded by the Dao Lord. From *Supreme Clarity* to *Brahma Conduct* is also the main text spoken by the Primordial Beginning.

From *Thirty-Two Heavens* to *Receiving Salvation* records the Dao Lord’s account of his own salvation on that day, his words of self-congratulation. From *Passing the Barriers* to *Gate of Heaven* contains the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s passage through the barriers, as recorded by the Dao Lord. From *Binding the Dipper* to *Demonic Spirits* recounts the Dao Lord’s proclamation of the deeds of support, defense, and sweeping away, the awe-inspiring power of the Great Gods of Jade Clarity. From *Three Officials* to *Supreme Clarity* is the talisman of command received on that day by the Divine Duke, the Supreme Perfected, the Grand Minister of the Great Mystery, and the Five Numinous Northern Thearch, the words bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, as recorded by the Dao Lord. From *Primal Net* to *Gate of Life* is the main text spoken by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy. From *Within It* to *Lofty Perfected* contains the Dao Lord’s transmission of the Great Cavern’s instructions. The *Hymns of the Three Realms* were composed by the Demon Kings and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. The *Hidden Sayings, Middle Section* is the Dao Lord’s arrangement of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s main text. From *Above These Three Realms* to *Utmost Profound Mystery* was all spoken by the Dao Lord and transcribed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign. From *Decree to Govern Earth* to the *Thirty-Two Characters of Renewed Life* is the Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s decree, also recorded by the Dao Lord.

The second chapter begins at *Primordial Cavern’s Mysterious* and continues to *Proclaiming to Supreme Clarity*, forming the first section. From *Primordial Cavern’s Jade Register* to *Parting from the Highest Perfected* is the second section. The *Hymns of the Three Realms* do not belong to these two sections but were composed by the Demon Kings. The remainder, being the words of the Dao, were recorded by the Dao Lord and do not pertain to the purport of these two sections.

**Gate of Immortal Ranks**
**Discourse on the Grades of Immortals**

The Master said: Male immortals of the highest rank are called Heavenly Worthies; female immortals of the highest rank are called Primordial Ladies. If form and spirit have not yet attained sublime refinement and still retain the fleshly corpse, they shall not be granted such titles.

For those with a physical body—once perfected—the great merit requires three years, middle merit seven years, and lesser merit nine years for one promotion. For those in the primordial body, all ascend once every seven hundred years.

First, one is examined for office in the Nether Bureau; next, one enters the Water Officials as master of mountains and rivers; then the Earth Officials as master of serene abodes and blessed lands; then as master of grotto-heavens; then as immortal officer of the Ten Continents and Three Islands; and gradually advances into the Heavenly Bureaus.

For those who perform merit in the world, establishing great virtue and great merit to transform others, with both inner and outer merits complete, the place where the spirits are welcomed and offices conferred is the Great Yin’s refinement of the corpse. When the years of cultivation are fulfilled, they merge with the immortal form and ascend in flight.

If merit and virtue are incomplete in inner and outer cultivation, one’s spirit is dispatched to govern affairs, establishing a residence in the Nether Bureaus of Heaven, Earth, and Water.

To enter these mysterious ranks and pure grades, one must receive the Dipper’s scriptures, erase the name of death, and ascend to the Southern Bureau. When merit rectifies corruption, one ascends into the immortal ranks. After comparing years of cultivation, promotion within the immortal grades is also permitted.

Those who presumptuously overstep will be strictly investigated by the Three Officials—how can one not guard against this? Offenders will be demoted in rank, have years of cultivation revoked, and be penalized with additional merit tasks. One must be reverent and cautious.

Contemplative Radiance Dharma-Enforcing Perfected Stewards.

The above ten ranks are comparable to the heavenly chancellors. All require fifty rectifications of corruption for one promotion; forty rectifications grant entry into the above ten Perfected Steward ranks. From here onward, one enters the Form Realm of Heaven.

Grand Splendor Dharma-Enforcing Immortal Stewards, Upper Immortals, Perfected Stewards.

The above ten ranks require ninety rectifications of corruption to enter the Immortal Steward ranks, one hundred to enter Upper Immortal, and one hundred twenty to enter Perfected Steward. Gradually, one enters the ranks of Perfected Ones, all specially conferred by the Celestial Emperor. Concurrently, all heavenly, earthly, and aquatic immortal offices are also specially conferred. Next, one enters the inner ministries of the Heavenly Mechanism, the Heavenly Mechanism General Ministry, and the Grand Mystery General Ministry.

For each rectification of corruption, a memorial must be submitted to the Heavenly Ministries, where it is examined by demon officials. If not verified by the Demon Bureau, the merit of numinous demons is assessed. The Demon-Restraining Bureau recommends, and the Three Officials and Five Emperors memorialize to the various heavens. Only after a formal report is made can one ascend in rank; demotion follows the same procedure.

Without penetrating the hundred spirits and achieving spiritual communion with the heavenly bureaus, the mysteries cannot be fully understood. There are separate celestial immortal ranks and divine courts where golden tablets are issued daily from the Jade Capital. Only after being granted robes, establishing a residence, paying homage to the Primordial, receiving the Dipper’s scriptures, and inspecting the grotto-vision—with the great stabilization of the seven scriptures’ merit complete—can one fully comprehend the supreme mysteries of the Highest Mystery.

**Discourse on the Testing and Recording of Offices and Ranks**

It is said: The scriptural records of the Three Caverns are transmitted in accordance with the cosmic rhythm. Thus, the *Dongzhen* section has the *Shangqing Grand Grotto Returning Chariot to Complete the Dao Record*, one rank. Those who wear it are called Disciples of the Grand Grotto of Highest Clarity. If one does not wear the record but enters the chamber to recite the *Grand Grotto Scripture* and practices its great functions, one is only addressed as "Minor Servant So-and-So."

The *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Grand Grotto* belong to the *Dongzhen* section, not to be confused with those who mistakenly refer to passages from the *Scripture of Salvation* as the *Dongjing*. Moreover, the original ranks and petitions of the Grand Grotto’s fundamental system were established in primordial antiquity; it was only in later ages that people began compiling the *Grand Grotto* methods, though these ultimately diverge from the ancient texts.

The *Dongshen* section flourished during the Eastern Han, where all ranks below the *Mengwei Record*—along with miscellaneous registers—were consolidated under the *Zhengyi* Altar. The *Tianxin* and *Wulei* methods, as well as talismanic and prohibitive arts, were all subsumed within it. This need not be elaborated further.

Within the *Dongxuan* section, there is the *Zhongmeng Secret Record of the Numinous Treasure*, followed by the *Zixu Yangguang Record*, with only the *Great Method of the Numinous Treasure* attached to it. Those who wear the record but do not practice are merely called "Record Ranks." Once one has performed the *Great Method of the Numinous Treasure*, and the ritual methods derive from it, one inevitably engages with the world and interacts with beings, adapting rites to circumstances. Thus, ranks emerge, and names are reluctantly assigned to align with the demands of the age. When memorials are presented and petitions submitted, their *qi* is unified; when deliverance is extended to the hidden and manifest, titles are conferred accordingly. If one’s practice contradicts the record, one risks becoming a laughingstock among spirits and gods.

Lin Shichen once said: "Thus, five ranks of immortal offices are established to facilitate their application." From this foundation, one cultivates without cease, accumulating merit and refining *qi*, merging with the Dao and attaining spirithood. Good deeds resound in the Mystic Capital, immortal names are inscribed in the Golden Towers, and heaven bestows true offices upon the world. These are tasked with propagating the Dao and transforming the age, bestowing feathered canopies upon the azure heavens. When summoned to ascend, their affairs align with past and present—such outcomes arise from virtue, not from presumptuously claiming lofty ranks and grand titles.

Some practice the scriptures and methods of the *Numinous Treasure* yet seek divergent paths; others perform the *Pure Brightness* method to supplement alternate ranks—both are incorrect. All should wear the *Zhongmeng Record* and fulfill their original office.

As for the previously mentioned *Tai Shang* Enforcer, who heads the ranks, this office indeed exists. However, *Tai Shang* refers to the spirit of the Primordial Void. It is also said that *Tai Shang* denotes the utmost greatness, while *Shang* signifies supreme reverence. It is further said that beyond the utmost greatness and unfathomable height lies the *Tai Shang*. It is also said that nothing surpasses the *Tai Shang*. Thus, the Dao is called the *Tai Shang Yuanji Great Dao*; beyond this, the term *Tai Shang* should not be applied. In Daoist scriptures, it may stand alone as a title of the utmost honor, akin to the most exalted of worldly designations. Can a ruler’s title be appropriated for a subject’s rank? In the secular realm, all official ranks from the first grade upward derive from the sovereign; would one prefix a title with "Emperor So-and-So" or "Son of Heaven Such-and-Such"? Moreover, the opening of register scrolls from the ancestral altars all bear the title *Tai Shang So-and-So Record*, for the talismans within originate from the *Tai Shang*. When practitioners issue talismanic decrees, they are called *Tai Shang So-and-So Talisman*—this is appropriate for talismans and records but not for ranks and titles. Since records derive from the *Tai Shang*, and ranks are based on records, one cannot prefix *Tai Shang* to a title. Thus, *Tai Shang Enforcer Perfected* is somewhat incongruous.

In secular memorials, terms like "Ancestral Temple" or "Emperor" are centered and set apart. Official ranks of ministers may include "Before the Throne" or palace names, with a space left blank, yet none prefix their titles with "Emperor" or "Son of Heaven." How can one presume to prefix *Tai Shang* to a rank? Would this bring you peace?

A rank is the position one attains. To be called *Disciple of Such-and-Such Record* or *Officer of Such-and-Such Method* means one wears this record and practices this method—one cannot claim *Tai Shang* as one’s own title.

Some argue that the *Southern Bureau Enforcer* is a title for those who practice the scriptural methods, and that other *Numinous Treasure* methods do not use the *Southern Bureau* designation. Yet they fail to recognize that the scriptural methods are the foundational practice. Today, in ritual and offering halls, when issuing talismanic decrees, bestowing true certificates, or enacting canonical protocols, all derive from the scriptural methods. Those ignorant of their origins mistakenly claim that the *Numinous Treasure* methods used in worldly rituals differ from the scriptural methods—how shallow their understanding!

Since the inception of the *Numinous Treasure* methods, the original rank of *Tai Shang Enforcer* has never been adopted by discerning scholars across the realm. Recently, some have taken titles like *Lineage Master*, *Enforcer Perfected Administrator*, or falsely established "retreat names" as designations—are these not delusory and presumptuous?

In recent times, the scriptural methods have proliferated ranks, such as the eight grades of immortal offices, six categories of martial ranks, and various hierarchical arrangements—these have grown increasingly elaborate and should not be cited or employed. One cannot, simply because they are recorded in the scriptural methods, casually assume and confuse the celestial order.

Some call themselves *Disciples of the Numinous Treasure Zhongmeng* and claim to practice the *Great Method of the Numinous Treasure*. If one does not thoroughly understand the *Zhongmeng*, then the *Numinous Treasure Record* is irrelevant. The *Southern Bureau Enforcer* is an ancient office of the *Numinous Treasure*; the Highest Heavenly Emperor is well aware of this. To wear this record and assume this office is to rightfully perform its duties—no further petitions to the ranks are necessary. This is a rigid and unyielding view.

Thus, the revered master bestowed the four ranks of the *Southern Bureau*, each prefixed with "Immortal," yet still deemed them unworthy. He then petitioned the Supreme Mystery to specially designate the *Dianzhe* as the first rank. Moreover, the *Dianzhe* office exists in other methods, though it was not previously established in the *Numinous Treasure* tradition. The four ranks cannot be abolished, as they await those who attain perfection and achieve the Dao.

**Five Ranks of the Southern Bureau**
*Southern Bureau Enforcer Dianzhe*
*Southern Bureau Enforcer Immortal Officer*
*Southern Bureau Enforcer Immortal Official*
*Southern Bureau Enforcer Perfected*
*Southern Bureau Enforcer Perfected Official*

*Seal Scripts, Regulations, and Standards*

The discussion turns to the proper seals for this method. The Master states: A seal is a token of trust. Its use lies in sealing objects and documents, serving as the credential of those who govern. *The Han Officials’ Etiquette* states: Kings and marquises use *xi* (imperial seals), while nobles from the rank of marquis to officials of the middle second grade use *zhang* (seals); all others use *yin* (ordinary seals). These are the seals of the mundane world.

In the flourishing age of high antiquity, humans and spirits each remained in their proper places, and yin and yang did not transgress their bounds. Thus, the application of the Dao was seen only in the cultivation of truth and refinement of the fundamental, leading to lightness of body and ascension in flight. From the middle antiquity onward, reverence for the true declined daily, the orthodox Dao grew obscure, and deceit and falsehood ran rampant. High and low were overturned, and so methods were introduced to remedy these ills: manifestos to convey sincerity, and seals bestowed as tokens of trust. Thus, the meaning of using seals became nearly identical to worldly conventions—an adaptation of the Dao’s workings to the exigencies of the times.

However, those whose titles resemble those of mundane offices must not employ the same graphs; those who borrow ordinary seal scripts must not use them in bureau affairs; those who presume to encroach upon the offices of the celestial perfected must not employ them beyond their proper rank; and those who indulge in excessive complexity must not invoke the great methods of the *Numinous Treasure*. Since ancient times, only the seal of the *Southern Bureau under the Three Heavens’ Gate* has been used. In recent times, as authentic seal scripts have become scarce, and the four characters “under the Three Heavens’ Gate” are not to be used in the human world, omitting them would render the seal incomplete. Therefore, in accordance with this method, only the seal of the *Numinous Treasure Great Method Bureau* is employed.

Now that one has advanced to the rank of *Dongxuan* and bears the *Middle Alliance Register*, practicing the *Numinous Treasure* method, one’s office carries great weight. Apart from memorials submitted in worship, all documents—whether upward petitions, downward official communications, notices, proclamations, talismans, or records—addressed to the bureaus of the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the netherworld offices of the Nine Provinces and Four Seas, the cavern-heavens of the Nine Earths’ profound yin, or the celestial and terrestrial administrations under their jurisdiction—must bear the seal of the *Numinous Treasure Great Method Bureau*, for it is the true token of the Enforcer’s authority. How could any other seal suffice? All formal documents and their envelopes must uniformly employ this seal. Only memorials and their cases may use the *General Memorial Seal*. When dispatching official notices or documents, the seal of one’s own office is used.

**On the Seal of the Numinous Treasure Great Method Bureau**
From the Zhou and Qin dynasties to the present, measurements have varied. There are the Zhou foot, the millet foot, the Han foot, the Later Zhou foot, and in the present dynasty, the cloth-and-silk foot and the provincial foot. In the Jiang-Huai region, there is the Huai foot—each differing in length. The seal of the Enforcer of this method should measure two *cun* and five *fen* in diameter, according to the Zhou foot. Often, method texts specify seal diameters in *cun* and *fen* without clarifying the length of the foot. Later scholars who seek to emulate antiquity may uniformly adopt the Zhou foot.

**On the General Memorial Seal**

**On the Ranks of the Cavernous Perfection and the Dao of Jade Purity**
The teachings of the Cavernous Perfection (Dongzhen) and the Dao of Jade Purity (Yuqing) emerged during the Jin dynasty’s Yonghe era through the Seven Perfected—Three Mao, Two Xu, and Yang Jiang—who transmitted the formats for memorials and petitions to the celestial courts. The teachings of the Cavernous Mystery (Dongxuan) and the Numinous Treasure (Lingbao) trace back to the era of the Three Sovereigns and the Kalpa of Crimson Clarity, where such practices were already established. The formats for memorials and petitions derive from the *Scripture of the Five Refinements for Animating the Corpse* and the *Original Conduct of the Five Elders*. As the Jade Dawn (Yuchen) was a disciple of the Primordial Beginning (Yuanshi), this seal serves to convey sincerity to the ancestral masters. Those not ordained in this method may not borrow its use.

When performing the memorial rites of the Cavernous Mystery, two sheets of paper are affixed before and after the petition, inscribed with talismans according to the prescribed form. The Orthodox Unity (Zhengyi) memorial seals and the Twelve Minor Seals are not employed; only the *General Memorial Seal* is used above the date. The seal’s inscription reads: *"Triple Heaven’s Covenant of Unification"*—a text also found in the *Divine Empyrean Registers*. Later generations, seeing this seal recorded therein, have mistakenly attributed it to the Jade Purity and the Cavernous Perfection department. Yet before the rise of the Divine Empyrean teachings, the Cavernous Mystery memorial rites of the Five Dynasties and earlier all employed this seal. It is, in fact, the text of the *Lingbao Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven*, albeit with its lower portion omitted. The living use it as proof when submitting memorials to the celestial courts.

When the *General Memorial Seal* is used for Cavernous Mystery petitions, it remains part of the original Numinous Treasure canon. Moreover, the *Great Charter for Ascending to Heaven* has always belonged to the Cavernous Mystery department. When issued to the deceased, the characters *"Summon the Soul"* are added beneath the *"Ninefold Mystery Envoys"*. For the living, the lower portion is omitted. How, then, could it be claimed as belonging to the Cavernous Perfection? The Divine Empyrean encompasses the myriad methods of the Celestial Altar, all fundamentally rooted in the Numinous Treasure. Its three talismans are also included in the registers for practical use, yet nowhere is this seal designated as unrelated to the Cavernous Mystery.

In the present dynasty, the Daoist master Wang Shengqing recompiled the *Great Methods of the Numinous Treasure*, adhering to the ancient methods of Master Chen and other traditions, which many have since followed. The original seal measured two *cun* and four *fen* in diameter by the Zhou foot. If the *Seal of the Enforcer* employs the Zhou foot, this seal should likewise follow the Zhou foot; if the cloth-and-silk foot is used, it should match accordingly. Deviating from the ancient foot risks censure by the Three Officials.

**On the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital Seal**
The Dao of the Grand Purity and Orthodox Unity was bestowed by the Mysterious Origin and Later Sage upon the Orthodox Unity Celestial Master, complete with rites for submitting memorials. The *Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital Seal* is used because the Grand Purity shares its origins with the Eight Elders, who revere the Most High as their master. Thus, when disciples petition their master, they bow twice at the beginning of the memorial, affixing the *Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital Seal*, and conclude with the *Twelve Minor Seals* at the *"Year of the Great Yin"* section.

**The Twelve Minor Seals**
- *Bow Twice*
- *To the Jade August One*
- *For Your Attention* (placed to the side)
- *Beginning of the Memorial*
- *To the Grand Purity* (top)
- *End of the Memorial*
- *Your Servant [Surname]*
- *To the Grand Purity* (side)
- *Year of the Great Yin*
- *Mystic Capital*
- *For Your Attention*
- *Waist Seal*

Each of the twelve seals measures one *cun* and two *fen* in length, eight *fen* in width, with thickness unrestricted.

**On the Yellow Spirit Transcendent Memorial Seal**
The *Essentials of Orthodox Unity* records a single seal named the *Yellow Spirit Transcendent Memorial*, slightly larger in diameter, used primarily for emitting *qi* to treat illnesses. According to the present standard, it measures one *cun* and eight *fen* in diameter by the Zhou foot. Following ancient script, two seals are used for urgent petitions to the Celestial Emperor when the formal memorial is not prostrated.

**Dao Lord’s Jade Seal**
This seal is employed in transmitting the Dao, receiving teachings, and seeking investiture. Ancestral masters use it in their memorials.

**Crimson Seal of the Chaotic Abyss** | **Jade-Character Crimson Script Seal** | **Eight Might Dragon Script Seal**
The preceding three seals are used universally for imprinting talismans, swallowing, wearing, or affixing for protection.

**Middle Section of the Numinous Script Seal**
This seal is used to disseminate the true script and safeguard mountains, rivers, lands, and waters.

**Primordial Beginning’s Mandate Seal**
This seal imprints the yellow registers and white tablets for the Primordial Beginning’s mandates.

**Seal of the Three Heavens and the Most High**
This seal serves as the contract of the central alliance and the general memorial of the Numinous Treasure. It may be used universally for submitting petitions, decrees, memorials, and dispatches, as well as for imprinting talismans, treating illnesses, and expelling malevolent forces. It measures two *cun* and seven *fen* in length and three *cun* and four *fen* in width.

**Seal of the Numinous Treasure Mystic Altar** | **Jade Memorial of the Three Flying Mystic Qi** | **Seal for Dispatching the Nine Spirits’ Flying Petitions** | **Seal of the Great Mystic Capital Province** | **Seal of the Grand Marshal Overseer** | **Divine Tiger Virile Left Seal** | **Divine Tiger Feminine Right Seal** | **General Command Seal** | **Thorn Chamber Seal**

**On the Use of Seals**

It must be stated that the Dao of the Numinous Treasure emerges from before the Ultimate Non-Being, while its methods arose only after the Middle Antiquity. When Master Ge of Eastern Wu received the scriptures from the Perfected Xu Laile, the methods were still incomplete. During the Jin dynasty, Xu Jianyang encountered the Divine Mother Chen, who transmitted the teachings of the Filial Dao Bright King of the Lunar Palace, and only then did the regulations and ranks become manifest. The present designation of the "Pure Brightness Abbey" is incorrect, for the Numinous Treasure admits no dual Dao.

By the end of the Jin and Song dynasties, fasting and cultivation had flourished, and documents and dispatches had grown increasingly numerous—thus, seal scripts became indispensable. The Celestial Master of Han employed only the *Yangping Governance Unity Seal* to achieve ascension. Xu Jianyang, having received the *Bronze Talisman and Iron Charter* and the *Golden Elixir Treasured Scripture*, along with the teachings of the Filial Dao Bright King, followed the Dao of the Numinous Treasure, which likewise did not require many seals. Yet through these, he elevated his entire household to transcendence and took his place among the lofty heavens. Even among those perfected adepts and exalted immortals who attained the Dao, some did not rely on seals to benefit the world and bring peace to the age. Thus, the weight of the method does not lie in the number of seals.

Later practitioners, however, fell short of the profound mysteries of the ancients, and their seals multiplied a hundredfold. In recent times, those performing Numinous Treasure rites often do not use the seals of their proper offices for memorials and documents, instead employing the *Jade Memorial of the Three Flying Mystic Qi* to dispatch them—a practice never seen in the ancient methods of the Numinous Treasure. Moreover, in the issuance of talismans and proclamations, they use the *Seal of the Three Heavens and the Most High*. Yet the descent of talismanic script originates from the Supreme Mystery; when inscribed by human hands and presented to heaven for enactment, it suffices. There is no need to append official titles to the talisman’s end, for what role does the *Three Heavens and the Most High* play therein? The Three Heavens and the Most High are not to be used as seal inscriptions.

Furthermore, the method includes a *Jade Seal of the Dao Lord*, which is also improper. In the secular realm, the Son of Heaven and feudal lords use the term *xi* (imperial seal), so for the Dao Lord to be called a *seal* is inappropriate. Jade seals are termed *jade xi*; for instance, the ancient Son of Heaven possessed eight *xi*, and the Qin dynasty’s Li Si inscribed the *Transmitted Treasure of the Realm* with the words, *"The August Emperor receives the Mandate; may his prosperity endure for ten thousand generations."* The imperial seal transmitted by the sagely dynasty bears the inscription, *"The Emperor reverently receives the Heavenly Mandate’s Treasure."* Even the Celestial Master’s jade seal is simply called the *Yangping Governance Merit Seal*. From antiquity to the present, no one has ever self-styled a *jade seal* within the seal’s inscription. The Dao Lord is the ruler of the celestial center, akin to the Son of Heaven in the mortal realm—how could his ministers presume to use his seal? Moreover, when ministers submit memorials to their sovereign, would they dare to affix the sovereign’s seal? Such a thing is unthinkable.

Additionally, seals such as the *Crimson Script of the Primal Chaos Seal*, the *Numinous Writ Central Scroll Seal*, and the *Eight Might Dragon Script Seals*—and others of their kind—all take four characters from the scriptures as a single seal. For example, *"Severely Command the Northern Deng"* or *"Clearly Inspect the Ghostly Encampment"*—adding the word *"seal"* and arranging them in three lines—take eight characters from the scriptures as a single seal. If this logic were followed, the *Celestial Script Salvation of Humanity Scripture* could yield a seal for every character from beginning to end, an innumerable multitude.

There are also those who style themselves the *Altar of Mystic Communication with the Numinous* or the *Numinous Treasure Mystic Altar*, not only usurping celestial protocol but also violating the statutes of the yang principle. The Three Mao Mountains of Jinling are the ancestral altar of the Great Cavern tradition; Hefu Mountain by the Linjiang River is the ancestral altar of the Numinous Treasure tradition; and Longhu Mountain in Xinzhou is the ancestral altar of the Orthodox Unity tradition. These are the sacred sites where the Three Caverns’ sagely masters transmitted the true teachings and presided over the canon, revered by successive dynasties. If commoners conduct fasting rites, they may temporarily erect an altar, but once the ritual is complete, it is dismantled. How could one arbitrarily establish a name for a private dwelling?

Those who attain the subtleties of *Mystic Communication* could discern the great fortunes and calamities of the world, the auspices and disasters of the celestial divisions, and the cycles of destiny’s rise and fall. Yet such knowledge is forbidden by secular law. Without sufficient merit and cultivation, one must not indulge in such reckless presumption.

There are also the *Bureau of the Nine Spirits’ Flying Petitions* and the *Seal of the Nine Spirits’ Flying Petitions*. The term *"flying petitions"* refers to the act of pacing the stars to invoke the Nine Spirits—it is merely the name of a ritual step in memorializing. There is no such bureau in heaven, nor such a seal in the world. From the Orthodox Unity to the Cavern Mystery traditions, all may submit memorials according to their proper offices. The Orthodox Unity ritualists use the *Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital Seal*, while the Cavern Mystery ritualists use the *General Memorial Seal*. There are no alternative doctrines; why, then, would one need to fabricate an additional title or craft a special seal to submit a memorial?

In secular terms, officials from the *shoucuo* rank upward may submit memorials to the court, merely inscribing their current office as their title. They do not establish a separate rank for memorial submissions beyond their proper office. According to ancient texts and master transmissions, one need only append a single title: for all memorials, dispatches, talismans, and documents, the *Seal of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Bureau* is used. For memorial submissions, only the *General Memorial Seal* is employed. In urgent petitions, the *Yellow Spirit Transcendent Memorial Seal* is used. For other matters, such as summoning souls, the *Divine Tiger Seal* is employed.

In all rituals—whether setting up offerings, conducting fasts, praying for rain or sunshine, summoning spirits, capturing ghosts, healing illnesses, investigating malevolent influences, delivering the deceased, or saving the living—the twenty-seven grades of fasts and forty-two types of offerings, along with all worldly practices within the Numinous Treasure’s purview, are encompassed by the use of these four seals alone. There is nothing they cannot accomplish.

When performing the *Heart of Heaven* rites and conducting the *Northern Dipper Offering*, one follows the proper method of the tradition: the *Exorcism Bureau Seal* is used for those who have advanced to the Cavern Mystery rank. For the *Northern Dipper Offering* in the Cavern Mystery tradition, the *Seal of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma Bureau* suffices. The principle is exhaustive. When merit is perfected and the Cavern Vision is fully realized, when one’s conduct is exalted and spirits are commanded to serve, there is no need to proliferate seals further.

Beyond the Numinous Treasure, those who practice other methods follow their respective regulations and use their corresponding seals.

The submission of talismanic memorials and official documents may likewise employ only the seals of the Numinous Treasure’s proper offices.

For the Supreme Clarity Cavern Realms possess no system of memorials or ritual forms, while the Numinous Treasure stands as the supreme rank of the Middle Vehicle. All methods below the Orthodox Unity tradition may not transcend the Numinous Treasure. Thus, though various miscellaneous seals have circulated for so long that they cannot be abruptly abolished, they are now preserved together. Scholars devoted to antiquity and refinement shall discern for themselves.

**Ritual for Consecrating Seals**
The Master declares: The seal-charters are the numinous writ of the Three Heavens, the talismanic covenants of the exalted perfected. When activated, Jade Maidens attend as guards; when employed, spirit-officials enforce their authority. Matters proceed according to the seal’s function—no transgression is permitted.

For the ritual of seal consecration, prepare twelve portions each of jujube decoction and pure tea, twelve bright lamps, and twelve sets of spirit-money and paper horses. Arrange these before the Gate of Heaven. At the hour when the stellar lodges shine clearly, the Dharma Master dons ritual vestments and cap, purifies the mind, and offers incense. Joining the middle fingers of both hands, he gathers the qi of the ten directions and blows it upon himself, transforming into the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. Upon his head rests the Seven Mornings Jade Canopy Crown of Interlocking Harmony; his body is clad in a robe of azure feathers and flying clouds, crimson slippers, and a scarlet skirt. At his waist hangs the Numinous Treasure Sword of the Three Realms; upon his back rests the Five-Colored Circular Symbol. Standing in the *ding* position and facing south, he paces the Eight Trigrams in homage to Heaven, then turns to face the Gate of Heaven. Bowing thrice, he rises and silently memorializes the Supreme Emperor, stating the number of seals to be transmitted and the chosen day for the ritual consecration.

He invokes the Three Worthies to deign to gaze upon him, beseeching them to bestow the Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin and infuse them into the seals. He commands twenty-four Golden Lads and Jade Maidens to serve as attendants, enabling him to employ the seals with numinous efficacy. Whatever responses manifest, the sagely beings of the ten directions shall bear witness.

Upon completing the memorial, he bows thrice again, draws in the three qi of the Gate of Heaven, and blows them into the seals. Kneeling upright, he takes each seal in turn, traces the *Great Execution Talisman* with both hands, and raises it to his forehead to empower it.

**Empowerment Incantation for the Seal**
The Elixir of Enspirited Cinnabar shines,
The numinous plain commands the Mysterious Heaven.
The majestic form of Mysterious Heaven abides,
Its radiant yin aspect embracing the Great Transformation.
The Pivot of the Square Mysterious responds to the vast,
The settled ministers endure in blessed flourishing.

After reciting the incantation, he draws in three breaths of qi, blows them forth, flicks the Jade Clarity Mudra, and recites the *Numinous Writ* once more before placing the seals in their casket.

**Method for Employing the Seal**
With the left hand forming the *zi* mudra, recite the incantation:

**Ritual for Offering to Cinnabar, Ink, Brush, and Inkstone**
The method states: On a day governed by the Six Ding or Six Jia spirits, prepare twelve brushes, twelve sticks of ink, twelve ounces of cinnabar (or less if poor), and two inkstones. On a *jiǎzǐ* day, face the Celestial Gate and arrange them upon the table. Offer twelve cups of jujube broth and one incense burner, ensuring no one disturbs the ritual.

The officiant forms the *zi* mudra with the left hand and the *wu* mudra with the right, crossing them at the mouth.

**Prayer:**
Your servant now, in accordance with the prescribed form, has prepared brushes, ink, cinnabar, and inkstones, arranging them beneath the Celestial Gate. Reverently, I invoke the numinous officials of the *Lingbao* scriptural departments, the immortals of the celestial bureaus, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, the generals, officers, and soldiers—may each infuse these implements with their transforming true *qi*, so that when I employ them, they respond at will with divine efficacy.

**Incantation for Offering to the Brush**
Oṃ ā nà fǎ yán mó yí ā yǎng mì luó pú tí pó lóu sà luó fàn nà zǒng jiān guǐ shén shè.

After reciting the incantation, flick the mudra, draw in twelve breaths from the Celestial Gate, and blow them into the brush. Inscribe the talisman within the brush shaft, reciting:
The divine brush, numinous and bright,
Moves by the Mandate of the Supreme.
The Upper Realm receives its command,
All spirits heed with reverence.
Inscribed talismans and registers,
Penetrate the profound and obscure.
Within the Mysterious, the Great Sovereign,

For this method, press the middle of the middle finger, inscribe ten talismans, write them on red paper, and distribute them to the ten directions. For each talisman, burn yellow paper money while reciting:
A thousand harmonies, ten thousand unions,
Merge with the hundred spirits.
Divine Lords receive the Mandate,
Overseeing all numinous beings.
All demons bow their heads,
All spirits submit in reverence.
Guard the true and secure destiny,
To deliver the multitudes.
In life and death, they rely upon it,
Its blessings are boundless.
Merits and transgressions are never lost,
Protect and exalt your being.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the *Lingbao* Law commands!

**The Twenty-Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Purity Lingbao Great Law Concludes**

**The Twenty-Eighth Scroll of the Supreme Purity Lingbao Great Law**
Transmitted by Dongwei Gaoshi, Kaiguang Jiuku Zhenren Ning Quanzhen, to the Supreme Purity Three Caverns Disciple, Lingbao Lineage Master Wang Qizhen

**Chapter on Transmission Rituals and Standards**
The Master said: The *Lingbao* Great Law is the supreme Dao of the Three Caverns and Three Ranks, the numinous chapters of ten thousand, a hundred, and a thousand scrolls. Those who receive it are not distinguished by immortality or mortality, but rather by having scriptures to serve as their teacher. Those who transmit it do not select by nobility or baseness, but rather by having seekers to serve as their disciples.

According to the *Xuan Du Ding Lu*, the transmission of the forty thousand decrees is not based on the rank of the lower terrestrial realm, but rather on the time limits of the Three Heavens. This is to prevent its leakage to unworthy persons. If one possesses the talent of an immortal, why should it be limited to the transmission of forty thousand decrees at a time?

The statutes of the Divine Continent forbid the release of its texts for four hundred years, though it permits a perfected person to transmit them to one person every forty years. Within four hundred years, no more than seven persons may receive them. However, one must be cautious, for if later learners who transmit and practice it are numerous, they may betray the Dao, forsake their teachers, violate their vows, fail to comprehend the profound principles, mock and misuse the Daoist methods, carelessly leak secrets, and offend against the Mysterious Mandate. Not only will they ruin the sacred teachings, but they will also betray their teachers and masters. Their ranks will be demoted, and they will ultimately find it difficult to return to the Upper Palaces. Moreover, those without the proper bone constitution will implicate their immortal ancestors—this cannot be ignored.

There are also reckless and arrogant masters who happen upon these texts. Outwardly, they display lofty virtue and purity, but inwardly, they covet wealth and goods. Without discerning the worthy and wise, they indiscriminately teach the unworthy, thereby confusing the sacred teachings. This causes the Three Officials to wield their brushes and the Four Departments to record transgressions, leading to a dissonance between the Dao’s wonders and the numinous mysteries, rendering them as empty as the void.

Yet the Upper Mysterious Ones, who cherish life and abhor killing, universally deliver the submerged and lost. They extend the boundless decree of delivering all beings and guide later learners. Thus, they have established separate transmission standards to ensure harmony and yang light prevail, preventing the rise of yin and killing. Disciples should adhere to these, assist in propagating the Mysterious Transformation, so that all under heaven embrace virtue and together attain the fruit of the Great Luo.

The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate said: Since receiving the decree of old, I have fully experienced transformations, whether in wealth or poverty, nobility or lowliness, without exception. In the transmission between teacher and disciple, every word and phrase must be free of true or false distinctions. If one takes the false as true, one naturally obtains a true response. If one takes the true as false, the true is lost of itself, and the distinction between true and false arises. Thus it is said: The myriad methods arise from the distinction between true and false; the cinnabar palace is disturbed by qi, and the ten thousand decrees become obscure. If one’s heart is devoted to the true and dismisses the false, one immediately attains the wondrous fruit of true response.

The Perfected of Brahma-void said: At the beginning of transmission, the principles of pledging the heart and swearing the covenant are established because learners of the Dao are shallow and superficial, lacking pure and sincere resolve. Thus, there are standards for pledging with gold and treasures, valuing the Dao over wealth. Yet some lose the true transmission due to excessive attachment to wealth, while others, obsessed with profit, measure it in ounces and grains, thereby losing the proper recipient. Those who inherit the Dharma in this manner are not genuine, their original hearts eroded. Though divine retribution has not yet arrived, how can they escape the punishment of spirits and gods?

The Master said: In the standards of transmission, one must carefully select the recipient. Their inner spirit must be firm, their virtue and dignity solemn, their words and deeds trustworthy, and they must be compassionate, loyal, and filial. They must be frugal, upright in conduct, their hearts sincere and upright, and their aspirations long for the subtle and formless. Only such a person is fit to practice the supreme methods and deliver the living and the dead.

If one harbors secret schemes to harm others, their words and deeds are flawed, loyalty and filial piety are absent, their hearts and conduct are wicked and deceitful, they are cunning and fraudulent, lacking inner virtue and outer dignity—then they are persons of shallow blessings and deep wickedness. Or if they come from families of executioners, soldiers, or those who inflict punishment and death in the three paths, how can they comprehend the gods and spirits of heaven and earth? One must discern the wise from the foolish, distinguish the constitution of immortals, and only then may they receive the words, take the oath, follow the time limits of the Mysterious Statutes, prepare the words of the heart’s chapter, and obtain the oral command of the Great Marshal—who is none other than the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. Next, seek the endorsement of the lineage master, who shares the altar with the master of transmission, and report to the Three Heavens’ ministers, submitting to the Three Officials’ offices to receive a favorable response. Only then, choose an auspicious day and transmit according to the statutes, swearing an oath to heaven.

It is also said: Generally, a master who receives and upholds the Dharma may transmit it to five persons after practicing for half a cycle (six years). After a full cycle (twelve years), they may transmit it tenfold compared to other methods—this must be strictly observed.

**Pledging the Heart and Swearing to Heaven**
The Scripture says: The noble person treasures gold and treasures, pledging their heart and swearing to heaven before transmission. It also says: If a perfected person pledges their heart, they must follow the old standards and report the oath to the Ten Heavens before transmission. This is how one pledges the heart and honors the Dao.

The standards for reporting the oath are as follows: If feudal lords, dukes, or ministers wish to save the world, aid the endangered, and secure the nation’s destiny by receiving this great Dharma, they should offer one hundred twenty taels of fine gold, thirty-six bolts each of five-colored silks and gauzes, twelve taels each of cinnabar and green silk, one hundred twenty *dan* of rice as a pledge, one hundred twenty strings of cash, and thirty-six catties of incense for the oath.

If scholars or commoners wish to deliver the living and the dead, ascend their immortal ancestors, they should offer thirty-six taels of fine gold, ten bolts each of five-colored silks and gauzes, nine taels each of cinnabar and green silk, twelve *dan* of rice as a pledge, twelve strings of cash, and six catties of incense for the oath.

If one retreats to the mountains and forests, practices austerities in secluded valleys, and cultivates the Dao, they should offer nine taels of fine gold, one bolt of purple silk, one tael each of green silk and cinnabar, and one catty of incense for the oath. One hundred sheets of paper may substitute for silk and cloth, and one set each of five-direction brushes and ink may substitute for cash and rice.

Should those of insufficient means to practice the Dao still offer two-thirds of these requirements, yet nothing may be omitted. For those of meager circumstances dwelling in cold seclusion, they may shear their hair in place of gold, petitioning the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors of the Celestial Courts to swear alliance with the Ten Heavens. Alternatively, offer five-colored cloth measuring three feet and six inches as a token of sincerity. Or, pierce the flesh to draw blood in substitution, presenting it to the Five Emperors as a pledge of devotion, thereby bestowing it upon the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens. Green silk may serve in place of shorn hair, and cinnabar in place of drawn blood.

Though clear pledges and trustworthy offerings now exist, few indeed are those who would shear their hair or pierce their flesh. Yet the essence of sincerity lies in severing a portion of one’s own flesh, cutting the sacred treasures of the Nine Heavens, heedless of shame or pain, to forge bonds of ten thousand karmic blessings, thereby revealing the purity of one’s heart. Swear never to transmit this recklessly or with negligence. Truly, such a one is the rightful recipient—what need has he for worldly wealth?

For this method is concealed within the Upper Heavens, its prohibitions most severe. Even celestial beings, when journeying to the Mystic Capital’s Upper Palace to receive transmission, must still offer gold and treasures—thus may it not be lightly divulged. If a Dao-practitioner seeks to transmit the dharma, the master must memorialize the Celestial Court in full detail, following the prescribed rites for transmission. All requisite items for transmission must not be concealed out of selfishness.

Should a disciple outwardly惜财货而轻道, inwardly惜肤而耻痛, and thus fail to sincerely pledge, the Dao will not take root, and the divine immortals will not attend the scriptures. After transmission, both master and disciple will be assailed by a hundred demons, incurring profound misfortune, burdening their ancestors, and betraying the Mystic. Beware this most earnestly.

If one adheres to the regulations, all heavens will rejoice, the myriad demons will be bound, and the host of spirits will pay homage. When the altar is opened and the transmission conferred, the assembled perfected ones will oversee the rite, bestowing it upon the recipient. The Dao and its methods will flourish, the hundred demons will retreat into silence, and the natural ebb and flow of separation and union will prevail. Summon the sages, gather the perfected, deliver the living, ferry the dead, accumulate merit, and amass virtue—success will be achieved in no time.

The recipient of this dharma must be loyal and filial to sovereign, master, parents, and teachers; compassionate toward the suffering souls of the netherworld; devoted in heart to the Three Treasures; pure and steadfast in self-cultivation; containing brilliance in silent recognition; practicing hidden virtues in secret; maintaining single-minded focus from beginning to end; and never forgetting the subtle words of the master. Be sincere, earnest, and unwavering in observance.

In official rank or salary, one may serve the sovereign and support kin; dwelling in mountains and forests, one need not shun refining body and spirit; delighting in rivers and lakes, one may roam freely without remorse; tending fields, one may not neglect plowing, planting, and harvest; concealed among merchants and traders, one may not hinder commerce and enterprise; hidden among physicians, diviners, artisans, and craftsmen, one may not suppress skill and mastery in one’s craft. Concealed in obscurity, one will surely succeed; flaunting brilliance, one will surely fall.

If one disdains superiors and neglects inferiors, flatters and follows power, schemes with cunning, is frivolous and easily wearied, debates trivialities, is arrogant toward all, pursues ostentation and profit, spreads idle praise, indulges in lust, drunkenness, greed, and anger, or fails to establish resolve and conduct—such a one is unfit. If one adheres to the teachings and precepts, one may securely ascend, and the ranks of immortality may be attained.

This is the teaching of my school, not to be shown to the uninitiated. Strive to uphold it with care, and comprehend it clearly in full.

The Master said: For all who bow in reverence with the *Heart Chapter*, having already received the mandate of the Supreme Mystery, permission to transmit the precepts and confer ordination is granted. Again, employ the *Heart Chapter* to communicate below within the oratory, whether upon lofty mountains. The *Revealed Chapter* is divided into the *Ten Celestial Treasure Contracts*, the *Joint Office Contracts*, and the *Mystic Capital Oath Contracts*. Proclaim the covenant to the Ten Heavens, offering *Mystic Spring Lingzhi*, rare blossoms, precious fruits, and fragrant incense. Perform thirty-two prostrations to the Master as a token of gratitude for the endorsement, to assume the appointed office. All these are witnessed by the hundred spirits, who attend the Jade Steps of the divine court with luminous clarity. Only then may one enter the purport of the *Seven Scriptures*, and thereafter offer thanksgiving rites to all Masters.

If the *Heart Chapter* has been transmitted and the mandate of the Mystery permits ordination, establish the covenant and oath, complete the rites of reverence and division of the contract with the Master, and all may be permitted to become Masters of the Mystery within the Heavens, entering the Dao of the *Seven Scriptures*. Erect an altar for self-ordination, without necessarily relying on an ordaining Master to preside. Yet one must still engage a Master of the Scriptures in the world to reach the Master of the Mystery. There are no ordinations without the Master of the Scriptures, just as there are no accomplishments without the Master of the Mystery. The Master of the Scriptures and the Master of the Mystery are not distinct; should there be the slightest deviation in devotion, the two bureaus will memorialize and impeach, demoting the offender and deducting their allotted years.

The remainder follows the *Mystic Statutes and Immortal Registers*. Upon completion of the ordination, take nine inches of yellow silk, inscribe upon it the *Flowing Gold Refined Body Longevity Spirit Talisman* in cinnabar, and on the reverse, the *Nine Precepts*. Enclose it in a crimson pouch and suspend it before the heart. Uphold the *Nine Perfected Great Precepts*, receive and practice the *Ten Precepts of the Dharma Office*, the *Twelve Practices of Heavenly Beings*, and recite the *Divine Book Hymn Chapters* ten thousand times. Only then may one enter the *Seven Scriptures*, and afterward hold the *Eight Wefts*, inevitably attaining the rank of Perfected. Even if merits are incomplete and one enters the underworld, one may temporarily escape to the Great Yin, achieve liberation through *corpse-transcendence*, and ascend to the Immortal Palaces.

Should any master grow lax after initial diligence, carelessly divulge esoteric scriptures, recklessly transmit them to the unworthy, or commit acts of disloyalty, unfiliality, inhumanity, or injustice; should they show arrogance or negligence toward the Perfected, or transgress the precepts and prohibitions—then for such offenses, I willingly offer my life in atonement to the Three Officials, extending calamity to my seven generations, in strict accordance with the statutes of the Mysterious Code.

I, [Name], now present this petition, with [Name] as my recommending master and [Name] as my supervising master.

The above is respectfully submitted as stated. Should any discrepancy arise, I willingly submit to the celestial decree.

Respectfully submitted on [Year] [Month] [Day] by [Name], holding the rank of [Title].

**Petition Format**
[Title] [Name] of this petition.
[Name]’s native place: [State] [County] [Precinct] [Jing], presently of upright conduct. Age: [Number] years. Born on [Month] [Day] [Hour], under the governance of the [Specific] Star Lord of the Northern Dipper.

I humbly reflect that, having long basked in the subtle blessings of the Mysterious Gate, I bear talismans and registers to guard my life and secure my person, and have received scriptures and Dharma to inherit the tradition and propagate its teachings. Yet my cultivation remains incomplete, and I am ashamed of my lack of merit in benefiting others. Ignorant and unenlightened, I fear my understanding of the profound mysteries remains shallow. My virtue is meager, and I have only sullied...

**Petition for Transmission of the Great Dao**

Having purified body and mind through fasting and ablutions, and bearing offerings of incense and faith, I personally approach the altar of my Preceptor [Name], Master of Transmission, to humbly petition for the conferral of the **Great Rites of Supreme Clarity and Numinous Treasure (Shangqing Lingbao)**, including its scriptures, esoteric oral instructions, talismanic diagrams, and seals—all as one transmission.

I vow to uphold and practice these rites, universally aiding the living and the dead, refining body and spirit, safeguarding family and state, promoting benefit and eradicating harm, establishing virtue and merit. I dare not resent the Dao or fault my master, nor slacken in diligence from beginning to end. Should I leak secret texts or recklessly reveal them to the unworthy, may calamity flow upon my person, misfortune extend to my seven generations, and may I, upon the wind’s touch or blade’s edge, be examined and forever forfeit my place among humanity.

This petition is respectfully submitted and prostrated before the altar of my Preceptor, the **Three Caverns’ Patriarch and Perfected [Name]**.

I humbly implore the merciful favor of my Master to deign approval, and to specially memorialize the **Celestial Court (Tian Ting)**, that transmission may proceed in accordance with the ordained statutes. I await the **Dharma Decree** in reverence.

[Year] [Month] [Day], [Title] [Name] of this petition.

**Memorial to the Jade Clarity [Heaven]**
[Title] [Name], humble servant of the minor office.

This servant, undeterred by the risk of punishment, presumptuously presumes upon the **Celestial Audience (Tian Ting)**, fully aware of my transgression, and first begs for leniency.

This servant’s wisdom and discernment are common and mediocre, my karmic conduct shallow and meager. Unversed in the profound mysteries, how could I presume to guide others? Yet by the grace of the **Most High (Taishang)**, who has established the statutes...

The sacred writ having descended into the world, permission is granted to draw in later disciples, that they may inherit and uphold the ancestral **Dao**-wind. The petition thus presented cannot be suppressed or rejected. With due reverence, I have divined this month’s [Day] as auspicious to proceed at [Location], daring to transgress the prohibitions and swear alliance before Heaven. I shall present the transcribed petition to seek the **Mandate**, and on [Day] shall reverently adhere to the ordained statutes to open the altar and transmit the precepts. Following the **Master’s** model, I shall confer the sacred writ, sever the contract, divide the ring, and establish the covenant with oaths. Through the night, I shall conduct a pure **jiao** offering of [Number] ranks, to give thanks above for the **Celestial Grace**, and to memorialize the promotion of [Name and Title], as well as to petition for the name of the altar’s **Jing** sanctuary.

I further beseech the descent of the **Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin**, the wondrous radiance of the **Numinous Treasure**, to flow into the **Hun Yuan** spirit-chamber of [Name], that in his contemplation and practice, in his breath and cultivation, the profound talismans and mysterious workings may be mastered, and the **True Spirits** fully communicated. Thus shall there be none he cannot deliver, and nothing he cannot accomplish.

When the **jiao** offering reaches its appointed time, I shall reverently await the grace of the **Enlightened Light** to descend upon the altar, bearing witness to the rites performed.

This servant, of foolish and impure substance, has recklessly occupied a place among the immortal ranks, presuming upon the **August Majesty**—my crimes merit ten thousand punishments. Respectfully I present this memorial and prostrate myself in await of the **Decree of Command**.

Memorial to the Celestial Ministry, in accordance with the standard format:
The humble servant [Name] bows twice and respectfully declares:

Having reviewed the oath and memorial of the petitioner, whose sincerity is earnest and whose intent cannot justly be denied, this servant has respectfully chosen the ___ day of this month to adhere to the ritual statutes. Defying prohibitions, he has transcribed the sacred words, opened the altar for transmission, divided the jade ring and split the contract, and established the oath and covenant. By evening, a pure offering shall be prepared, and the Imperial Perfected shall be invited to witness and affirm the transmission, thereby fulfilling the earnest supplication.

All matters requiring submission for imperial consideration and celestial notification are hereby respectfully presented:

1. This servant petitions that upon the transmission of the Great Daoist Law to [Name], the Sagely Decree be graciously bestowed, proclaimed to the Mysterious Capital Bureau and the Three Offices with their Nine Departments, as well as to the Celestial Bureaus overseeing the registers of perfected beings and their affiliated true administrations. May they examine [Name]’s transgressions and errors from past lives and this existence, expunge them from the ledgers of sin, inscribe his name anew in the registers of the living, appoint him to a rank among the immortals, and record his name upon the cinnabar tablets. Thus may he slightly aid the Mysterious Transformation and exalt the true Daoist wind above.

2. This servant petitions that a memorial be transcribed and presented to the Golden Towers of the Three Heavens and the imperial courts of all celestial sovereigns, beseeching the issuance of an edict to be proclaimed throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, to all celestial bureaus and offices, the palaces of the Dipper and stellar abodes, the Three Origins and Nine Treasuries, the Five Marchmounts and Nine Ramparts, the Fengdu Underworld, the Water Palaces and river sources, the blessed grotto-heavens, the divine continents and their domains, the courts of the living and the administrations of the dead, and all places concerned. May it first be granted that [Name]’s nine generations of ancestors be absolved of their past transgressions and sins accumulated over many lives, their earthly servitude severed, and their spirits transferred to the Southern Palace. From this day forth, whenever the dharma-successor disciple [Name]—whether for himself or others—performs prayers, exorcisms, or supplications, delivers the living and transcends the dead, conducts purification rites and establishes merit, or dispatches talismans and summons, may all such acts proceed without obstruction or hindrance, achieving their intended efficacy.

3. This servant petitions that a Mysterious Decree be graciously bestowed, notifying the Jade Purity Numinous Void Palace, the Numinous Treasure Celestial Immortals’ Inner Court, and all subordinate bureaus and offices, to dispatch the Heavenly Perfected Lords of the Great Numinous Treasure Dao, the Ten-Thousand Bureau Wish-Fulfilling Great Generals, the radiant divine kings of all heavens, jade maidens and jade lads, numinous officials and marshals, scriptures, talismans, and the perfected spirits who have received appointments, as well as the Northern Dipper Mysterious Model Bureau, the Southern Prosperity Refinement Office, the Upper Clarity Yellow Registers Court, the Memorials and Petitions Department, and all their subordinate officials, generals, clerks, soldiers, merit-recording functionaries, direct messengers, earth gods, and other deities. May they divide their spirits and transform their qi, uniting as one to descend into the altar chamber of the dharma-successor disciple [Name], where they shall reside according to the seal’s authority, administer their offices, assist in the propagation of the Daoist teachings, and jointly accumulate hidden merit. Thus may [Name] commune with them through focused intention, respond to them through breath, transcend all without exception, and accomplish all without fail. May every prayer and entreaty manifest in clear resonance.

4. This servant petitions that, in accordance with ritual statutes, the requisite memorials

Decree issued, proclaimed throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, to the courts of Yang and the administrations of Yin, and all relevant offices:

From this day forth, in all matters—whether for self or others, in prayers and exorcisms, petitions and supplications, salvation of the living and deliverance of the dead, the performance of fasts and accumulation of merit—may responses manifest at the appointed time without fail.

Should they engage in the refinement of the Three Wonders, the harmonization of the Five Planets, the inscription of talismanic scripts, or the deliverance of the manifest and the hidden, may they be bestowed with the numinous roots of Yin and Yang, the true generative qi of Water and Fire, to irrigate the Three Fields. Thus may inhalation and exhalation align within and without, penetrating the profound and embracing the mysterious, guiding the mortal to sagehood, leaving none undelivered and nothing unaccomplished.

At the time of transmission and ordination, may they await with reverence the celestial grace, that the sacrificial rites be witnessed in clarity. [This servant] presumes upon the sacred majesty.

With trepidation and awe, this humble servant submits this petition for Your august consideration. Respectfully submitted.

Regarding the talismanic seals and scriptural offices [Your] subordinate has received, from this day forward, wherever petitions, talismans, or decrees are invoked, may they be duly observed and executed.

Yet [Your] subordinate fears that, being of mortal flesh and burdened by karmic obstructions, [he] has not yet fully grasped the profound mysteries of talismans or communicated with the true numina. Reverently, [he] beseeches the Jade Radiance’s true qi to irrigate [his] bodily fields, dissolve impure knots, and awaken the true mechanism.

In all encounters with saving the living and delivering the dead, refining form through qi, maintaining meditative focus, and aligning with the Dao, may nothing remain undelivered and nothing unaccomplished, thereby fulfilling [Your] subordinate’s earnest prayers and serving as a sign of efficacy.

May the secret and esoteric be revealed, the deluded and ignorant awakened, the transformative mechanism of the Dao expansively unfolded, and the silent accord of the heart’s prayers fulfilled.

Thus may this disciple’s innate nature and wisdom be illuminated, his mind’s ground made clear and bright, penetrating the wondrous and embracing the mysterious, carrying forth and propagating the teachings.

Dated: [Year] [Month] [Day]

Listed guarantors and supervising preceptors hold the same titles as before.

**Ring Formula**
The ring may be made of one tael and two mace of silver, inscribed with talismanic characters in cinnabar, with a central aperture. Two rings are used, bound together with blue silk, then severed with a knife at the altar. Master and disciple each retain one ring, storing them in a yellow silk pouch alongside the matching contract.

**Thought-Mystery Contract Formula**
In the [Year] of the Great Year [Celestial Stem-Branch], on the [Day] of the [Month] of [Dynasty], in the [State] of [Location], [Full Name], of [Place of Origin], this day respectfully pledges a golden treasure of sincerity. Following the standards of the Mystic Capital, they ally with the Ten Heavens, bowing in reverence.

Having received the transmission of the Shangqing Numinous Treasure scriptures, methods, memorials, and esoteric texts, they shall practice the Dao according to ritual, dispelling all inauspiciousness and universally delivering the boundless. On the day of receiving the Dao, their name is recorded in the Southern Palace; ten thousand spirits attend them. Their body transcends the Three Realms, their rank ascends to that of an immortal elder. The Demon Kings vouch for them, and the host of perfected beings supervises their transmission. The preceptor, in humble compliance with the great Dharma, invokes the divine perfected, delivering heaven and humanity. They dare not conceal or improperly transmit this teaching, swearing an oath by the Heaven within Heaven.

After receiving the Dharma, the disciple must not recklessly disclose it to the unworthy. Should they violate this sworn covenant, their body shall dwell in the demonic palace, their lifespan shortened, their years diminished. For ten thousand kalpas, they shall undergo trial, forever bound to the wheel of rebirth, with calamity extending to their seven generations.

Herein is established the covenant document as a surety.

The dharma-successor disciple [Name], aged [Age] in this life, born in the year [Year], month [Month], day [Day], hour [Hour], belongs to [Sacred Peak] and is summoned by the [Celestial Qi] Lord of [Heaven].

Reverently invoking:
The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning to deliver,
The Most High Dao Lord to deliver,
The Most High Lord Lao to deliver,
The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign to deliver,
The Perfected of Wondrous Conduct to deliver,
The Great Saints of the Myriad Heavens to deliver,
The Five Elder Thearchs to deliver,
The Flying Heavenly Divine Kings to deliver,
The Five Thearchs of the Great Demons to deliver,
The Three Officials and Five Masters to deliver,
The Starry Hosts of the Circumpolar Heavens to deliver.

On this day of joyous deliverance, [Name] passes through the gates of the myriad heavens, beseeching the eradication of the Three Ones’ evil, the severing of earthly roots, the transcendence of the Five Portals, and the inscription of their name in the Great Mystery. The Demon King of the First Heaven supervises their elevation, unbound by the gates of heaven.

The Eastern Dipper governs lifespan,
The Western Dipper records their name,
The Northern Dipper severs death,
The Southern Dipper bestows life,
The Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits in unison.

The Azure Thearch guards the hun-soul,
The White Thearch attends the po-soul,
The Vermilion Thearch nurtures the primordial qi,
The Black Thearch circulates the blood,
The Yellow Thearch presides at the center—
the myriad spirits cannot transgress.

The Five Thearchs of the Great Demons, ancestors of the myriad spirits, universally proclaim to the boundless: let the myriad spirits heed.

The Five Thearchs of the Three Realms declare before the Highest Clarity.

This covenant is entrusted to disciple [Name] to safeguard as a treasure of the body, enabling flight through the heavens below, distant acclamation by the Thearchs, homage from the myriad spirits, attendance by the Three Realms, submission of demonic hordes, self-annihilation of ghostly essences, prostration of the myriad numina, the summoning of immortal hosts, profound wisdom and luminous clarity, and the vast measure of the Mysterious Mystery.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes of the Great Dharma of the Numinous Treasure’s covenant transmission!

**Inscription:**
The Primordial Azure’s mystery transforms the myriad into form.
The mother’s blood, the father’s essence—
blood as lead, mercury as essence,
blood as qi, mercury as spirit.
Lead is yang, mercury is yin.
Lead and mercury become the gate of yin and yang,
the root of creation as sun and moon.
Mercury governs emotion, lead governs nature.
When spirit and nature are still, the earth abides eternally without turning;
when spirit is wild, lead descends and mercury departs from its root.
When nature is chaotic, mercury flees and lead loses its authenticity.
The myriad demons transform and arise in the Three Palaces.
When nature is restless and spirit scatters,
the Numinous Treasure is lost—how can one seek the true?
How may the myriad attain ascension?
Deeply investigate lead and mercury, discerning purity from turbidity,
proceeding step by step.
Master its diagram—this is the esoteric essence of cultivation.
Clarify its text—this is the gateway of the Great Dao.
Should one recklessly pair myriad unsuitable elements,
hoping for the Numinous Treasure elixir’s completion,
transformation of the embryo and spirit, and ascension in broad daylight,
even trial would prove difficult.
Should one recklessly disclose this to the unworthy,
the wind-knife shall immediately examine them,
and for ten thousand kalpas, there shall be no absolution.

This covenant is inscribed on catalpa wood, one foot and two inches in length, with an azure background and vermilion script for talismans and characters, stored in a yellow bag.

**The Master states:** The *Thought-Concealing Stabilizing Will Talisman* is the essential purport of the Great Dao, the supreme secret of the Numinous Treasure. Those who comprehend it attain longevity; those who cultivate it become immortals. Now, its outline is presented—disciples should examine it in detail.

**Covenant Agreement Form:**
This covenant is made of yellow silk, with vermilion talismans and ink script. At the time of transmission, it is reverently presented before the Perfected, then cut in half at the center. The master retains one half, the disciple the other, each stored in a yellow bag.

**Wooden Covenant Envelope Form:**
**Front:** The Dharma Rank of the Deliverance Master [Surname] [Seal]
(Three seals applied)
**Back:** *Thought-Concealing Covenant*
Issued to dharma-successor disciple [Surname] for safekeeping.

**Numinous Treasure Covenant Agreement for the Three Heavens Form**
**Numinous Treasure Official Position Covenant Form**
The two covenants above follow the form of the Ten Heavens Covenant below, written in the center, with identical left and right sides. The two covenants are placed in a single bag with a ring, the master and disciple each retaining one half.

**Numinous Treasure Covenant of the Ten Heavens Form:**
This Ten Heavens Covenant is made of yellow silk, nine inches in length, with seal script in vermilion and proclamation text in ink on both sides. In the center is the seal script for "[Celestial Qi] [Direction] Heavenly Venerable," changing according to the ten directions. There are ten in total, distributed facing the ten directions at the altar, each a separate covenant, sealed together in one bag.

**Seal Script for Each Direction Form**
**Immortal Proclamation Form**

**Proclamation of the Three Heavens Gate**

Of old, when chaos first divided, the Primordial Beginning unfolded its chart; the true writ shone resplendent in the Divine Empyrean, and jade characters spread forth across the Azure Vault. Divine spirits descended in substance, and precious qi gathered in form, embracing primordial qi within the Great Void, revolving yin and yang through cold and heat. They govern the Three Realms, restrain the myriad demons, their sacred tablets and jade tablets, their jasper cases and alchemical slips—scriptures esteemed as supreme, methods unrivaled in the Central Palace. They are the origin of all things, the ancestor of the mysterious mechanism, most revered among the heavens.

Through diligent toil may one hear of them; discerning the worthy from the foolish, we now follow the ancient statutes. We pledge before the Ten Heavens to present our oath, and transmit the precious gold and precious treasures in succession. To recklessly disclose secret texts brings calamity upon nine generations.

Today, on this day, so-and-so respectfully offers nine taels of superior gold, one bolt of purple damask, one tael of green silk, one catty of oath-incense, and steps forward to the altar. Bowing, I pray for myself, born in such-and-such a year, such-and-such a life-destiny, on such-and-such a month, day, and hour. Reflecting deeply, I, so-and-so, am of pure heart and steadfast intent, guarding the Dao with unwavering sincerity. In accordance with the Mysterious Statutes of the Most High, I now pledge and transmit the covenant.

Having received auspicious retribution, I am fittingly bestowed with immortal rank and commendation. I hereby recommend:

**Sponsoring Master:** The Ten Directions’ Most Perfected Flying Heavenly Divine Kings, Great Sages of Everlasting Life, Boundless Great Spirits.
**Supervising Master:** The Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, Perfected of Wondrous Conduct.
**Transmitting Master:** The Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables, Void Sovereign Dao Lords.
**Scripture Master:** The Nine Heavens’ Lofty and Illustrious Great Envoys, Perfected Lords of Divine Merit and Wondrous Aid.
**Register Master:** The Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, Perfected of Orthodox Unity and Serene Response.
**Transmitting Master:** The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, Void Sovereign Serene Elder Heavenly Venerable.

The Lord of the Eastern Dipper who Records Destiny grants transmission.
The Lord of the Southern Dipper who Bestows Life grants transmission.
The Lord of the Western Dipper who Records Names grants transmission.
The Lord of the Northern Dipper who Seals Death grants transmission.
The Lord of the Central Dipper, Great Luminary, grants transmission.

**Section on Transmission Procedures and Statutes**

The Master said: When opening the altar to transmit the Dharma, act according to one’s capacity. For those of ample means, one should submit petitions in advance, perform the evening rites of water consecration and altar prohibition, and conduct the overnight invocation rituals as in the fast. At dawn the following day, ascend the altar and perform the three daily audiences. By evening, conclude with the offering of the jiao ritual for transmission—this is most excellent. However, worldly custom often abbreviates the process, limiting it to the jiao alone, so the overnight invocations and morning audiences are seldom fully recorded.

The three-day liturgy of the Numinous Treasure Great Fast and Daoist arena may also be adapted as needed. Here, I shall briefly outline the jiao ritual for transmission, which is the rite of receiving the Dharma and giving thanks—distinct from the Yellow Register fast. Proceed according to its relative importance.

The Dharma Master kneels in reverence and summons the officials as prescribed.

Your servant humbly summons from within his body the Five Visceral Perfected Officials, the Merit Officers and Attendants, the Yin-Yang Merit Officers of Transformation and Transmission, the Officers of Disaster-Dispelling, Calamity-Scattering, and Misfortune-Resolving—twelve each. From this oratory, summon the Banner-Holding Supervisory General of Merit, the Direct Merit Officers, the Yin-Yang Divine Central Attendants—two each. Let all who are summoned don their regalia, take their stations, and encircle your servant’s body in formation.

The Gentlemen-Officers, Tiger Warriors, Inspectors of Treachery, Hook-Riding Cavalry, Chief Administrators, Archers, Celestial Soldiers, Officers of Rectification, Spirit-Feeding Officers, Poison-Collecting and Poison-Feeding Officers, Essence-Collecting and Essence-Feeding Officers, Evil-Collecting and Evil-Feeding Officers, Talisman-Breaking and Shrine-Destroying Officers, Officers of the Rigorous Wind and Mounted Couriers, Flying Dragon Cavalry, and all other officials shall assemble and station themselves to your servant’s left and right, front and rear, to receive your servant’s words and transmit them to the local earth gods, territorial deities, governing spirits of tranquil dwellings, renowned mountains, cavern-heavens, blessed lands, sea and mountain Tai Sui officials, and all divine officers and attendants within the Dharma.

With sincere devotion, your servant jointly petitions the Supreme August of the Primordial Form, Primordial Name, Void Primordial, and Self-So True Great Dao, the Supreme August of the Primordial Origin, before the Golden Gates and Jade Steps.

On the day your servant received the Dharma, he pledged to propagate it widely for the salvation of all beings, prioritizing the reception of others.

Now, with utmost reverence, this Dao-practitioner [Name] humbly presents a petition of advancement and obeisance, supplicating the Mysterious Response.

May all that your servant prays for be fulfilled, all that he petitions be answered, all that he condemns be repelled, and all that he averts be transcended. May the Merit-Officials, Generals, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers distinctly transmit and timely report these entreaties. Once the petitions are presented in full, may they return to your servant’s body and resume their stations within the palace chambers. When summoned again, may they arrive as before, in accordance with established protocol.

Invoking the Dharma rank, your servant, the humble and unworthy [Name], jointly and sincerely petitions the Jade Purity Sagely Realm’s Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the Highest Purity True Realm’s Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Great Purity Immortal Realm’s Dao and Virtue Heavenly Worthy, the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven, the Great Emperor of the Southern Culmen, the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of Purple Tenuity, the Earth Deities who Uphold Heaven and Emulate the Dao, the Divine Empyrean Jade Purity True King and Great Emperor of Longevity, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Culmen of Azure Radiance, the Highest Perfected of the Myriad Heavens, the Highest Perfected of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Milky Way, the Three Officials and Great Emperors, the Four Sagely Perfected Lords, the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma and Mysterious Center Great Dharma Master, the Tranquil Elder of the Three Heavens, the Perfected Lord of the Tranquil Response of the Three Heavens Great Dharma Master, the Three Perfected Lords of the Ancient Scriptures and Registers, the Perfected Lord of the Grand Ultimate Immortal Elder, the Perfected Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Merit and Wondrous Salvation, the Three Perfected Lords of the Yellow Register, the Divine Immortals of the Three Caverns and Four Supplements’ Scriptural Registers, the Perfected Lord of Floating Hill of the Thunder Bureau, the Perfected Lords and Immortals of the Dharma-Transmitting Masters, the Heavenly Immortals, Divine Officers, Generals, and Soldiers of the Dharma Registers, and all the August Perfected and Highest Perfected of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

May your vast compassion open the luminous mirror of discernment. Your servant has heard that the Primordial Form and Primordial Name are the wondrous traces of the Mysterious True. With light and image, they manifest the numinous mechanism of divine transformation. They preceded the formation of the cosmos and were the foundation of Heaven and Earth’s creation. From this single qi, the Three Powers were nurtured; all spirits were governed, and the myriad kinds were cultivated. Thus, the Primordial Net unfurled its mysteries, establishing the root and origin of ten thousand kalpas. The Great Brahma revealed its secrets, disclosing the esoteric scriptures of the Nine Purities. The Three Caverns spread forth, and the Nine Grades were proclaimed. These served to unfold the mechanism of transformation and to manifest the essentials of the Dao. Through the enlightenment of the revered masters, the teachings have been revered across past and present.

Your servant, though unworthy and base, has presumptuously joined the ranks of the ordained, recklessly presiding over the supreme teachings and gazing upon the sacred scriptures. It is fitting that he exert himself to propagate the Dharma, never daring to neglect his duties on account of others. Having purified himself to advance, he must open the path of diligent cultivation. The transmission is inexhaustible, fulfilling the intent of the Great Teaching’s completion. The standards of transmission are established, and it is proper to supplicate the Highest Perfected for their oversight and grace. Thus, he gazes toward the Purple Culmen to offer sincerity and bows toward the Azure Empyrean in reverence. Undeterred by the meagerness of his offerings, he dares to extend his plea to the august presence.

May five-colored auspicious clouds surround the flaming bells and flowing talismans. May the Three Flowers and Yellow Dao descend in the chariots of flying dragons and phoenixes. May the host of sages approach the throne, and the assembly of perfected take their places. As your servant and the hundred spirits tremble in awe, with a single-minded purity, they bow at the celestial steps to reverently welcome the sagely procession.

May the Perfected and August Ones descend to the altar. The first libation shall be offered. The Dharma office shall be solemnly proclaimed again.

Your servant, the humble and unworthy [Name], respectfully reiterates his petition to the Three Realms’ Highest Worthies, the Myriad Heavenly Thearchs, the Ten Directions’ Primordial Ultimate Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma’s successive generations of master perfected, and the August Perfected and Highest Perfected of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

Your servant has heard that the Dao’s essence is beyond words, and the teachings are established through scriptural precepts. Transformation is enacted through works, and salvation is extended through the Dharma’s thread. The Nine Grades and Three Vehicles are mutually interconnected. The Six Scripts and Eight Styles illuminate one another. Transmitted in the heavens, they become the path of myriad sages’ return. Descended to the human world, they open the gate for all beings’ cultivation and advancement. Without the good causes of past kalpas, how could one glimpse the true canon? Moreover, the teachings’ essentials are refined, and only then may one become a master. The will and thoughts must be pure and lofty to receive the Dharma. Establishing merit and accomplishing deeds glorifies the Mysterious Plan. Cultivating conduct and disciplining the self inwardly refines the mortal frame. The precepts are most weighty, and transmission is not to be taken lightly.

Your servant, by nature unworthy and lacking true understanding, knows not the truth of refining the Five Sprouts and Three Primes, nor can he escape the waves of the Six Desires and Seven Emotions. He ought to reflect upon himself—how could he instruct others? Yet, having sworn an oath and ascended the altar to receive his office, though he must not recklessly divulge the teachings, neither may he seal them away and lose the transmission. Moreover, moved by earnest entreaties and wishing to spread the transformation of the True and Perfected, how could he, on account of his own inadequacy, ultimately reject and sever the connection? Fortunate that the aspirant has resolve, he presumes to present this petition. Though he may be ignorant of the mechanisms of communion with the True and attainment of the Numinous, he dares not transmit treacherous or deceptive methods. Thus, he consults the ancient canons and unfolds the numinous precinct, awaiting the descent of the Highest Perfected and revering the presence of the August Worthy. Presumptuously, he lays bare his humble devotion and presents his petition to the august throne, solemnly proclaiming the words of transmission and advancement.

The proclamation of the petition shall be read aloud, and the offerings burned. As the words of the petition state, the sincerity is firm and earnest, and the circumstances warrant guidance. He dares not decline.

Your servant has heard that the Numinous Treasure’s divine chapters and Mysterious Upper Scriptures, from the inception of the Eternal Prosperity, are unfathomable in their origin. At the dawn of the Dragon Han, their wonders gradually manifested. They coalesced the jade qi of soaring mystery and formed the numinous sounds of hidden secrecy. They established the root and origin of the Five Peaks and spread through four translations. They pacify states and assist the governance of emperors, harmonize yin and yang, and aid the work of creation. The August Perfected and Highest Perfected all attain the Dao through them. How could the suffering souls of the departed not ascend and transcend by their power? They are the bridge for the myriad kinds and the model for all spirits. Though the transmission of these majestic canons is not to be taken lightly, their vast merit encompasses all without exception.

Again, your servant reflects that, though dull and unlearned, he has presumptuously occupied the seat of master and teacher. His successor, [Name], though base and common, has presumptuously received the office of the immortal and numinous.

The matter far exceeds my station, and in truth, I am ashamed at heart. Yet I humbly pray that Heaven’s creation may show compassion, and further hope that the grace of my master may shelter and nurture me. May I be permitted transmission and initiation, that I may ascend the ranks of the Perfected, be early recorded in the Mystic Capital, have all my transgressions erased from the Black Register, bypass demonic trials, and gradually enter the lineage of immortals. Yet the stains of my presumption are too many, and my capacity for reverence is all too meager. Once more I offer two libations to express my sincere devotion.

Your servants bow twice and perform the secondary offering with reverent ceremony. We invoke the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Ten Directions.

The Preceptor kneels and presents the petition, reciting:

I have heard that in the primordial kalpas of the Original Beginning, the myriad heavens were transformed into being. Hidden were the celestial hymns of the Azure Vault, and spread were the luxuriant blossoms of the Purple Void. The Three Luminaries were revealed to universally establish the divine and numinous. The Five Scriptures were disseminated to preserve and regulate the kalpic destinies. Seated upon a five-colored lion, the Heavenly Worthy expounded the Dharma to deliver beings. Abiding in the resplendent forest of the Seven Treasures, he transmitted the scriptures and entrusted the world. Myriad sages bowed their heads at the imperial dais, and hosts of Perfected attended the seat in reverence. All were the hidden and secret sounds of the heavens, not the common chants of the mundane world. The numinous wind filled the sacred flute, causing the sun and moon to halt their courses. The golden mouth broadly expounded, stilling the divine winds into silence. With a single utterance, the heavens acclaimed its goodness; with ten repetitions, withered bones became human. Thus, we know the wondrous Dao is unfathomable, and its mysterious power is measureless. Treasured by the heavens above, it is not transmitted to the world below. Only when encountered by a true person with a sincere heart is it received through covenants of gold and silk. Hosts of Perfected oversee the transmission, myriad sages attend the dais, the heavens ensure its proper transmission, and demon kings affirm its completion. Only then, in accordance with the Mystic Pattern, is one permitted to advance into the ranks of the pure.

Now, your disciple [Name] has stepped forward to the altar, holding sincerity in heart to receive the Dharma. I, your servant, early received my master’s decree and obtained the sacred texts. Their fundamental purpose is to deliver beings, and when encountering the truly worthy, they must not be concealed. When earnest supplications arise, I thus petition the Supreme Mystery. Already, auspicious responses have been received, and on this propitious day, the transmission of talismans, the bestowal of the Dharma, the conferral of precepts, and the empowerment of the Dharma-army are granted.

I humbly beseech the Numinous Treasure hosts of Perfected, the exalted sages of the Highest Void, to compassionately deliver beings and skillfully guide them. May your disciple [Name] transcend the dusty world, forever depart from illusion, purify the six senses, escape the turning of the eight difficulties, suddenly awaken to the Mystic Mechanism, and attain the wondrous practice of the Dao. May his merit and conduct flourish in the Three Thousands, summoning and gathering the hosts of immortals. May he command the demon kings of the Five Emperors and subdue the myriad spirits.

Your servant and disciple bow twice and recite the petition of commitment. After the recitation, the successor disciple bows twice, kneels, and addresses the assembly:

The successor of the Great Numinous Treasure Dharma, your humble servant [Name], with awe and trepidation, bows his head and prostrates himself, offering sincere reverence again. I respectfully invoke the August Thearchs of the Three Realms of the Golden Towers, the Heavenly Worthies of the Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions and the Primordial Ultimate, and the successive masters of the Numinous Treasure Great Dharma. May you grant compassion and deign to witness and record my plea.

Through a thousand lives, I have been fortunate to encounter, in this single day, the transmission of the Dharma and the succession of the lineage, advancing in rank and office. I vow to steadfastly uphold my pure resolve and never betray my heart. Should I violate this covenant, I willingly accept punishment. Today, with my preceptor, I divide the ring and break the contract, swearing an oath and drinking the cinnabar elixir. I humbly pray for your witness and permission to receive the transmission.

My heart is overwhelmed with earnest supplication. I bow twice and respectfully speak.

We invoke the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Measurelessness Who Delivers Beings.

The master and disciple return to their ranks and stand facing each other. The master begins the proclamation of the precepts, and the disciple faces upward, kneeling to receive them.

I reverently hear that the Dao of the Numinous Treasure and the lineage of the Mystic Mystery are wondrous beyond naming, measureless in delivering beings. Those who receive it surpass the merit of seven generations of ancestors; those who cultivate it ascend their forms beyond the Nine Heavens. It is the numinous pivot of the myriad Dharmas and the essence of the true teachings of the ten directions. Its virtue is supremely great, profound beyond measure. One must cultivate what ought to be cultivated and, moreover, uphold what must be upheld as precepts. If one maintains them without fail, the ranks of the true immortals may be attained.

Today, before the Three Worthies, we first clarify the Ten Precepts.

We invoke the *Gatha of the Root of Wisdom-Generating Precepts*.

The First Precept: Do not forget the Eight Poles.
Loyalty is the pole of reverence, filial piety the pole of compliance, fasting the pole of restraint, magnanimity the pole of breadth, generosity the pole of joy, forbearance the pole of harmony, and patience the pole of wisdom. Heaven takes the North Star as its pole, earth takes the mountains as its poles, and a house takes the ridgepole as its pole. Heaven, having poles, can gather the multitude of *qi*; earth, having poles, can gather the multitude of forms; a house, having a pole, can gather the multitude of timbers. Humans, too, are thus with the Eight Poles. Therefore, one can establish the multitude of virtues. When virtues are established, the Dao is complete. When the Dao is complete, what one hears and sees naturally becomes clear and expansive, and one’s responses naturally become harmonious and fitting. This is the foundation of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Second Precept: Do not forget the Mirroring Waters.
The mirror is an analogy for the heart; water is an analogy for nature. When the heart is bright, the myriad Dharmas are all illuminated; when nature is still, the five turbidities do not intrude. The Dao within humans is round and penetrating, not something that can be understood through obscuration or attained through restlessness. Entrusting oneself to the mirroring waters to awaken to the heart and nature—this is the essence of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Third Precept: Do not forget the Daily Record.
The Daily Record is used to examine and review good and evil. The afflictions of humans in the world are not knowing themselves, not hearing their faults, and not heeding advice—thus, there is no benefit. Now, by recording daily actions in the Daily Record, one must not leave anything unnoted, for all are one’s own transgressions. The value lies in reform. Thus, the Daily Record is an uninstructing teacher, a silent friend, an uncommanding lord and father, and an unenforced code of law. It must not be forgotten. This is the contemplation of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Fourth Precept: Do not forget the Pursuit of Deliverance and Pacification.
Moreover, of those to whom humans are close, none surpass their parents; of those they revere, none surpass their sovereign. To repay the virtue and kindness of parents and sovereigns is the pursuit of deliverance and pacification.

"Pursuit" refers to reciting scriptures and practicing disciplines, dedicating the merit to the departed ancestors and the six relations of one’s lineage to aid their journey in the netherworld. "Deliverance" refers to reciting scriptures and practicing disciplines, dedicating the merit to the living ancestors and the six relations to augment their fortune and lifespan. "Pacification" refers to reciting scriptures and practicing disciplines to extend blessings for the sovereign’s longevity, pacify the four directions, summon dragons to bring rain, expel demons and toxins, protect the people and all beings, and avert calamities caused by stellar influences—all of which are encompassed within this.

Whether dwelling at home and fulfilling the aspirations of ancestors, or serving in office and sharing the duties of the sovereign, one must act in every way that brings benefit and repays kindness. Even the falling leaves of a tree return to nourish its roots—this is the principle of returning to the root and restoring the mandate. The duty of humans to repay their origins and return to their beginnings must not be neglected. This is the proper way of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Fifth Precept: Do not forget the arts of healing and salvation, with compassion as the foremost priority.
For all who are ill, recite scriptures and employ talismans on their behalf, performing exorcisms with utmost sincerity, as if they were one’s most beloved children or parents. In every possible way, extend kindness and grace with wholehearted devotion. When governing as an official, ensure that all actions cultivate hidden merit, enacting policies with leniency and fairness, reflecting thrice before acting, and deliberating twice before moving. Whether repairing bridges, planting along roads, or undertaking any endeavor beneficial to the world, exert every effort to accomplish it.

Human compassion is like the root of a tree. A person devoid of benevolence falls short even of beasts. Consider how gibbons rescue elephants, how magpies battle serpents—such acts of deliverance from peril exist in the world. Reflect upon this: this is the reason for attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Sixth Precept: Do not forget the arts of refinement and cultivation.
Harmonize with Heaven and Earth, emulate the patterns of yin and yang, maintain purity of thought in every moment, and preserve integrity without lapse. Thus, one naturally transcends, transforming into the primordial unbounded state. Witness how silkworms, though initially earthbound, eventually take flight; how creatures of land and water ultimately roam freely. If even animals achieve this, how much more should humans? This is the method of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Seventh Precept: Do not forget firmness and purity.
Firmness entails steadfastness, refraining from improper conduct. Purity entails moral discipline, eschewing unwholesome sustenance. By not indulging in improper desires, one preserves the spirit and essence of the body. By not craving unwholesome food, one spares the lives of beings. Regard others’ wives and daughters as one’s own kin. Treat the lives of all beings as one’s own offspring. Thus, the spirit remains whole, and karmic adversaries diminish. This is the true practice of the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Eighth Precept: Do not forget frugality and restraint.
In all that one seeks, recognize that all things originate from the primordial transformation of the Black Mystery of the Original Beginning. After the turbid waters receded, no adornment was needed. Coarse grains suffice to sate hunger; no need for lavish feasts. This is the fortune of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Ninth Precept: Do not forget vows and pledges.
"Vows" are the aspirations one makes upon first entering the Dao. "Pledges" are the oaths sworn before Heaven and Earth after entering the Dao, overseen by the divine. One must not alter them midway. The precepts and disciplines must be upheld. This is the devotion of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

The Tenth Precept: Do not forget teachers and friends.
Teachers provide instruction; friends offer admonition. Instruction is like a father; admonition is like an elder brother. Who, then, are like father and brother? They must be revered and cherished, never abandoned. This is the foundation of attaining the Numinous Treasure’s deliverance of beings.

Uphold these precepts without the slightest lapse.

The ten precepts expounded above are transmitted and reverently bestowed by masters, elucidating the ancient scriptures. Scriptures are the mechanism and method of the Dao’s unfolding; precepts are the application of the scriptures’ essence. To follow the true teaching, diligent practice is paramount. Uphold and practice them without negligence. Countless ancestors, their souls awakened in the netherworld, will thereby receive deliverance and ascend to the Vermilion Palace. Only through unwavering cultivation and ceaseless study can one fulfill merit and perfect virtue, attaining immortality, ascending to the Golden Towers, and roaming the Jade Capital. Strive earnestly in this.

Next, the transmission of the scriptural text.

As the scripture states: Those of superior learning who study and recite this scripture, penetrating its profound mysteries, will attain flight to the Southern Palace, bypassing hell, and universally deliver boundless beings. All heavenly and mortal beings will receive blessings, immeasurable fortune, and grace in life and death. This scripture is treasured by Heaven and must not be transmitted to the lower world. Only those of utmost sincerity, offering gold and treasures, may swear an oath to Heaven and receive it. To treat it lightly or with disrespect brings calamity upon nine generations, condemning them to eternal servitude under ghostly officials.

The Five Emperors will assign twenty-four Jade Lads and twenty-four Jade Maidens to guard the sacred text and protect the body of the recipient. After receiving it, hold it in reverence and preserve it.

Next, the transmission of the esoteric methods.

At the origin, the Dao’s methods arise from spontaneity, its merits bestowed without dominion. Though named by force, it attains the most wondrous; though formless, it exhausts the transformations of primordial chaos. Behold the great Golden Writ of the Numinous Treasure’s great law—truly the mystery of the Primordial Beginning’s silence and non-being, the utmost emptiness’s profound quiescence. Its abyssal source cannot be fathomed; its wondrous principles cannot be exhausted. Secretly treasured in the Heaven of the Great Net’s Golden Gates, it imparts the decrees of the Floating Black Pearl. All heavens revere it; ten thousand sages guard and uphold it. Only those with good roots from former lives may glimpse its mysteries.

Now your disciple [Name], with reverent heart and bowed head, swears to receive the secret transmission, revealing it to the ten directions and pledging sincerity to the three realms. May I exhaust the utmost principles, embody the Dao, and deliver others. Humbly before the sacred presence, I receive and uphold the great law. I beseech the Elders of the Jade Capital and the Perfected of the Golden Gates to dispatch Jade Maidens bearing flying missives, presenting golden chapters for broad revelation. Command Golden Lads to proclaim virtue, unfolding the treasure steps for transmission. May your disciple’s soul and spirit be purified and upright, the ten thousand *qi* everlasting. May I avoid suffering and affliction, my body radiant with light. May the three realms provide escort, the Five Emperors oversee my reception, and ten thousand spirits pay homage. May my name be inscribed in Heaven, my merits complete and virtues perfected, ascending to the Highest Clarity. Receive and practice this, allowing no careless disclosure.

Next, the transmission of the Dharma seals.
At the origin, the Dharma has its steps and ranks, its offices and grades. Those who would issue commands must first bear the seal. Documents, memorials, and petitions rely on it for proclamation; summoning and directing depend on it to align with Heaven’s treasures. It must not be transmitted to the unworthy. Once entrusted as a token of faith and oath, it is conferred according to the regulations. Thus, troops follow the seal’s turn; generals obey the command’s course. In receiving and upholding it, one must await auspicious response.

Next, the transmission of the Dharma sword.
At the origin, to act on Heaven’s behalf, promulgate decrees, and display authority, one relies entirely on the divine edge of three feet to restrain the heterodox among the myriad demons. Its light soars through the seven luminaries; its might subdues the ten thousand spirits. Whatever is commanded, none fail to respond. I now entrust this to you—cherish and safeguard it well.

After each transmission is complete, master and disciple take up brushes to swear an oath.
The master intones: *Turn the brush to point at Heaven.*
The disciple says: *Above, I do not betray Heaven. If I betray Heaven, may my seven ancestors suffer punishment. If Heaven betrays me, may sun and moon lose their light.*
The master: *Turn the brush to point at Earth.*
The disciple: *Below, I do not betray Earth. If I betray Earth, may my body suffer the blade. If Earth betrays me, may grasses and trees not grow.*
The master: *Turn the brush to point at the heart.*
The disciple: *I do not betray my heart. If I betray my heart, may my household not prosper. If my heart betrays me, may the Dao’s transformations not proceed.*
Invoke: *The Perpetually Aiding Heavenly Worthy of the Dharma’s Karmic Bonds.*

Next, the division of the contract and ring.
The ring and contract serve to bind oaths to the Three Officials, pledge alliance to the ten heavens, and eternally affirm trust. The master must not conceal truth or reveal falsehood; the disciple must not rebel against the Dao or forsake the master. The divided ring ensures the oath never falters; the torn contract ensures the vow is never broken. From diligence to neglect, the Five Emperors record transgressions. With reverent devotion and refined cultivation, the nine heavens share in blessings. Receive this before the sacred, treasuring and upholding it for life.

The master holds the left side of the contract; the disciple holds the right. With a knife, they split it down the center, exchanging halves as a sworn covenant.
The disciple kneels and declares:
*Brush points to the Eastern Heaven of the Nine Qi, to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Perfected, Divine Immortals, Jade Maidens, Jade Lads, Divine Officials, and Immortal Soldiers. Today, rejoicing in this blessed transmission, I pass through the barriers of all heavens, beseeching the eradication of the three evils, the severing of earthly roots, and the flight through the five gates. May my name be listed in the Great Mystery; may the Demon Kings vouch for me; may my station be entrusted to the Jade Clarity. May the nine ancestors and seven generations be delivered from hell, all receiving transmission and ascending to the Southern Palace. May I transcend the three paths and five sufferings, the eight difficulties and nine calamities, the thousand disasters and ten thousand misfortunes. With merits complete and virtues perfected, may my mysterious master guide me, surpassing the three realms and roaming freely in the Highest Clarity. With inner cultivation and outer preparation, may I pass through the three realms and ascend to the rank of immortal. May all demonic trials be vanquished; may the Three Officials disperse their forms. May I command thunder and lightning with a whistle, summon wind and clouds with a breath, dispatch the celestial soldiers, and rebuke ghosts and spirits. May I summon a thousand Perfected, command ten thousand spirits, subdue evil poisons, deliver the living and the dead, restrain tigers and leopards, and slay demonic spirits. May I rescue epochs, stabilize kalpas, safeguard peace, assist Heaven’s transformations, aid the nation and save the people. May I harmonize the five *qi*, receive Heaven’s warp and weft, refine the inner to achieve Perfection, and effortlessly manifest the traveling kitchen. Wherever I go, may there be prosperity and uprightness. If I prove unworthy, may Heaven and Earth bear witness to my oath.*

*Today, I return my spirit, body, and life to the Three Treasures’ majesty. Should I harbor deviant intentions—beginning with diligence but ending in neglect, rebelling against the Dao or disdaining the Dharma, carelessly disclosing or disrespecting, defying the master’s instructions, lacking reverence or faith, disregarding time limits, transmitting to the unworthy, being disloyal or unfilial, indulging in licentious *qi* or discarding precepts, plotting harm, or willingly awaiting Heaven’s judgment—may my ancestors first fall, followed by my distant descendants, forever sinking into the Northern Darkness. May my person be punished according to the offense, my form tormented by wind and blade, thrice interrogated and reborn in a non-Daoist body, eternally barred from aspiring to immortality. I willingly accept this, making clear my betrayal of Heaven and Earth, rebellion against the Dao and master, and treacherous, evil heart. I dare not resent the Dao or blame the master.*

*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Numinous Treasure’s great Dharma and statutes!*

Next, the covenant is sworn with inscribed vows.

The Heavenly Official of the Upper Primordial, the Earthly Official of the Middle Primordial, the Aquatic Official of the Lower Primordial, the Celestial Emperors of the Four Quarters, the Five Emperors of the Five Directions, the sun, moon, and stars, the Perfected Ones of the Four Poles, the Three Masters who confer ordination, and the Witnesses of the Mysterium—after inscribing this covenant, I swear not to betray Heaven, not to betray Earth, not to betray my master. I shall be loyal to the state, filial to my parents, and compassionate toward all beings. For one kalpa, I shall relieve suffering and misfortune, using goodness to aid all things, and swear never to violate this pact.

Should I break this pact, I willingly await Heaven’s judgment, endure the trials of the Three Wretched Realms, and repay through the torments of the Five Sufferings.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees!

The master and disciple each hold one half of the jade ring, then sever a lock of blue-green silk with a blade to symbolize the cutting of hair. Next, they prick their fingers to drink the cinnabar elixir and swear the oath.

Cutting hair to swear before Heaven, pricking blood to seal the covenant, drinking the elixir to bind the vow—looking up, I invoke the Heavenly Worthies: may the Three Officials sponsor me, the Five Emperors bear witness, the Three Masters confer ordination, and the myriad heavens record my name. May the Northern Dipper release me from death, the Southern Dipper raise me to life, and the ten thousand Perfected receive my service. May the heavenly demons revere my form, and may the seven generations of my ancestors be refined in the Southern Palace. On the day my merit is fulfilled, I shall ascend to the Jade Purity.

Should I betray my heart and violate this oath, may I fail in my tasks and lack divine efficacy.

Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the statutes and decrees!

The master holds a vermilion cup and brush, declaring:
The transmission of ordination is now complete, the covenant sealed anew with blood—here, cinnabar replaces blood, each firming their resolve. Drink this elixir of radiance to commune with the Perfected and reach the numinous, to harmonize the five qi within and unite the hundred spirits. Ten revolutions return the spirit, and the myriad qi ascend as immortals together.

Next, the master exhales the cinnabar-water upon the disciple’s body, declaring:
First exhalation: may the Three Clarities’ exalted sages confer ordination.
Second exhalation: may the ten directions’ supreme sages confer ordination.
Third exhalation: may the Three Realms’ host of Perfected confer ordination.
Then the disciple drinks a mouthful of the cinnabar-water.

The master and disciple each store their half of the ring-token. The master again holds the ring-token and intones:
Heaven and Earth unite in trust, the ring-token serves as covenant.
Conduct with fidelity and filial piety, the heart pure and serene.
Compassion, kindness, reverence, and respect—words true, the body unsullied.
From beginning to end as one, the Dao unites with the divine.
Let no flattery or obsequiousness arise, nor greed or wrath.
To harm the body and break virtue is to defy the Three Realms.
Today we divide the ring-token, its meaning stronger than metal.

The master presents the divided ring-token to the disciple.
The ordination certificate is proclaimed.
Next, the immortal decree is conferred:
By long-accumulated fortune, you have encountered the true wind. Having embraced the numinous scriptures and steadfastly upheld your oath, it is fitting to bestow the immortal decree, that you may join the ranks of the pure. Hold fast to it, never forgetting cultivation and introspection.

The immortal decree is proclaimed.
Next, the talisman of authority is bestowed:
Having received Heaven’s favor and advanced in immortal rank, today we follow the mysterious statutes to confer the ritual implements. Those among you who serve as officials in the celestial bureaus shall, in the presence of the sacred, receive their charge, that the gods may divide their powers to govern. Thus, the talisman of office is granted to establish your authority.

After the talisman is proclaimed, the master intones:
The scriptures and methods of the Numinous Treasure are revered by the myriad heavens. Today, having received ordination, the Three Realms pay homage. The names of all are recorded in the heavens, ranked among the immortal elders. The Emperor Lords and Great Saints proclaim to the primordial bounds: measureless is the salvation of humanity, and our Dao flourishes.

The disciple receives the talisman and offers thanks, declaring:
This humble servant, dull of nature and base of endowment, has been graced with imperial favor and numbered among the true companions. Having sealed the covenant strong as metal and stone and embraced the subtle guidance of the scriptures, though by fortune’s turn, I am truly unworthy. How dare I not redouble my resolve, forever abiding in the mysterious model, to exalt the primordial transformation above and strive for the merit of saving the world? With utmost sincerity, I bow twice in profound gratitude.

The disciple performs the threefold obeisance.
The master again invokes the ritual statutes:
We humbly reaffirm our address to the Three Clarities’ Supreme Thearch, the myriad heavens’ Perfected, the Great Law’s founding master, the celestial officials and generals of the scriptures and registers, and the host of exalted Perfected of the Three Realms and ten directions.

We have heard that the Dao is magnified through people, and the law is transmitted by masters. Only through unbroken succession can the true wind flourish, and only through boundless dissemination can the great teaching expand. Guiding later learners, all beings with breath are led to fulfill the work of aiding and rectifying, broadening the path of salvation. This servant, of meager talent and shallow cultivation, has not met a perfected one nor fathomed the profound mysteries. Now, undeservingly entrusted with transmission, I am truly ashamed of my inadequacy. Yet, by the master’s grace in bestowing the statutes and permitting me to propagate them, we have sworn before Heaven, exchanged the talisman of authority, and presented offerings with reverence, roughly completing the rites. Mindful of our lack of full purity, we have surely offended the Perfected. We pray for boundless mercy to pardon our errors and omissions.

May this disciple soon ride the auspicious winds, swiftly awakening to the mysterious mechanism, advancing in cultivation to overcome demonic obstacles, and attaining harmony with the divine. May breath and response align, petitions silently reach the gods, and the merit of saving the living and delivering the dead accumulate, securing the wondrous depth of deep roots and firm stems.

Above, may the true wind shine forth and the supreme teaching spread. Sun bright, moon luminous, Heaven clear, Earth tranquil—may the Emperor’s longevity equal the enduring Southern Mountains, his great enterprise as steadfast as bedrock. May the ancestral temples be at peace, officials fulfill their duties, borders free of alarms, and the people live in harmony. Next, may the master who conferred the Dao, and the parents who gave life—those living receive blessings, those departed ascend as immortals. May those dwelling in valleys or mountains on rocks soon fulfill their vows, and all beings, whether walking, flying, or pecking, attain their destined flourishing.

We bow twice with reverence to present the final offering.
The dragon chariot memorial is proclaimed.
Next, the Dharma Master rises, assumes his role, and solemnly reaffirms:
Your humble servants, [names], humbly readdress the August One of the Golden Portal, the exalted saints of the Jade Vault, the revered masters transmitting ordination at this altar, and the host of Perfected and Saints of the Three Realms and ten directions.

We have heard that the Dao is empty yet responsive, and Heaven high yet heeds the lowly. Thus, at this altar of transmission, we have been blessed with your observant grace. Deeply ashamed of our repeated transgressions, we implore your forbearance. Now, the conferral of office is complete, the ritual offerings concluded. The immortal and the mortal part ways, the ceremonial retinue cannot linger. The clear processional music falls silent, returning to the jade capital’s ranks. The purple clouds withdraw their radiance—how can we gaze upon the jade chariot’s light? The Perfected return in glory to their domains, the officials and generals divide their powers to govern. Our longing and devotion redouble.

We, with the disciple, bow twice in utmost gratitude to express our reverence and farewell.
The Dharma assembly escorts the deities, burns the memorial, and concludes with the dedication of merit.
Thanks are offered to the officials and generals with the threefold presentation of documents.

In the hidden rhythms of the hundred demons, the natural separation and union unfold. The Three Radiances shine forth, pervading the great qi of Brahma. In the primordial Great Luo’s realm, the Primordial Beginning’s honored one resides. Bestowing the law to save humanity, the subtle wonder of returning form is revealed. Transmitting the scriptures to the world, the mysterious power to raise the dead is spread. Those who serve these scriptures are guarded by the eight directions’ mighty spirits. Those who protect this law are attended by the heavens’ exalted saints. The Five Emperors govern the great demons, the ten directions’ envoys oversee their duties. Now that the disciple has sworn the covenant and received transmission, the demon kings proclaim the Dao’s perfection.

Adhering to the celestial prohibitions, the open-air ritual is performed upon the sacred altar, summoning and commanding the ten directions, guiding the earth deities to their subtle wonders. Might equals that of heavenly governance, binding demons and ghosts with the true scriptures. In practicing this doctrine, the myriad saints descend to the hall; in reciting this scripture, all heavens assemble in unison. Those who assist my law emerge from non-being into being upon hearing the incantations. Those who aid my Dao, bearing the celestial mandates, deliver life and transcend death. Harmonizing the five qi, merging the hundred spirits as one.

Now, in strict accordance with the ritual covenant, we reverently present these offerings of fern and pondweed. We humbly beseech the solemn ranks of divine attendants to turn their gaze upon this rite, that the majestic processions may partake of these pure and abundant offerings. May the great teaching be expanded, and profound merit amassed—may the spirits witness this devotion.

We first offer this libation, holding in reverence the original scriptures of the Numinous Treasure, which contain the profound mysteries of the Double Mystery. The supreme and wondrous Dao is the root and origin of the great law. Some are disseminated among the mortal realm, while others are secretly preserved in the celestial treasuries. Those who honor and revere them attain the Dao; those who treat them lightly or with disdain invite calamity.

By virtue of karmic causes from past lives, I have reverently partaken in this great law. Having received transmission from my teacher, I now prepare these offerings in gratitude. Looking up to the sagely wisdom of the Most High, I pray that my humble offerings be witnessed. May the radiant majesty of the spirits respond to this plea, aiding the true teaching upon the sacred altar, their numinous presence resplendent. May the accumulation of hidden merit in the mortal world dispel the shame of my meager learning.

Though I rely on the teachings to uphold my practice, having encountered an enlightened master, it is only through divine power that I receive assistance. Severing the roots of misfortune by cutting off forms and beheading, clarifying commands by reverently upholding the essential principles, rescuing the hidden and aiding the manifest—nothing is left unaccomplished. In establishing virtue and merit, all requests are answered.

Let none grow lax or betray their sworn words. Facing the august presence, we reverently present the second offering.

The Dao cannot stand without humanity, nor can humanity proceed without the Dao. Thus, the Dao employs humanity to manifest, and humanity relies on the Dao to endure. Having been unworthily entrusted with these profound mysteries and presumptuously advanced upon the immortal ranks, I am ashamed of my lack of virtue and can only depend on the supreme spirits for support.

We humbly pray that the divine hosts be divided into ranks, jointly maintaining order upon the ritual altar, their banners arrayed in solemn formation, each securing peace within their domains. When names are called and summons issued, response is immediate. As the spirits move and qi is deployed, their numinous power blazes forth in brilliance. May they assist my Dao in establishing merit, guarding this covenant with vigilance. Above, may they aid the transformations of the Primordial Mystery, never forgetting the cultivation from beginning to end. With meritorious deeds accomplished, the ranks may advance in dignity.

Now, with words repeated and rites thrice performed, we do not stray from the sincerity of our hearts, trusting in the wisdom of the spirits’ discernment. We reverently present the final offering in gratitude for this majestic radiance.

*Here concludes the thirtieth scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Law.*
*Here begins the thirty-first scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Law.*

The Illuminating Master of Subtle Mysteries, the Perfected of Salvation from Suffering, Ning Quanzhen, transmitted this to the Disciples of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity, the Preceptors of the Lingbao Tradition, and the Heir of the Teaching, Wang Qizhen, who compiled it.

**Section on Diagrams of Ritual Altars for Fasting Rites**
**General Discourse on Fasting Rites**

The Master said: According to the *Precious Register of Qingwei*, it is said:
*"Virtuous deeds in the unseen realm elevate one’s ancestors,
While manifest virtue brings blessings to the self.
Why not establish merit to save those beyond inquiry?
Then the Heavenly Emperor shall naturally bestow upon you true perfection.
Rebellious ministers and traitorous offspring sink forever,
Yet even they may be transformed by extraordinary grace into insects.
After nine years, the Nine Heavens rejoice in celebration,
As one ascends by daylight upon clouds to the Jade Purity."*

Those "beyond inquiry" are the suffering souls of the hidden yin. For those who cultivate the profound principles of salvation and seek the essential path to transcendence, how can they not universally deliver these suffering souls of the unseen yin?

The esoteric purport of the trials in the hidden yin is fitting for each case. Across countless lifetimes, the four births and six destinies revolve endlessly in the cycle of birth and death. Without transcending the Three Realms and embodying the natural state, how can one escape the suffering of samsara?

Moreover, within the human realm, even the most civilized teachings of the Central Kingdom do not reach the lands untouched by the light of sun and moon. Yet all beings possessing the three karmas, six senses, and five encumbrances are born as humans, universally governed by the Northern Heaven. In the north, there are Three Offices, presided over by the Ghostly Officials—not the Pure Cold, Azure Radiance, or Purple Tenuity Offices. These Three Offices are solely responsible for the threefold karmic retribution. If bodily karma is grave, the Fire Office examines; if mental karma is grave, the Record Office examines; if verbal karma is grave, the Water Office examines. If all six senses and three karmas are grave, the Wind and Blade trial is imposed.

When a person is born, the father’s essence and mother’s blood coalesce into bone and flesh, forming the physical body. After ten months of gestation, the Great Tenuity descends qi to generate the spirit, and the wind-nature transforms into the soul and consciousness, completing the birth. If male, one holds rank among the Heavenly Worthies; if female, among the Primordial Ladies. Yet, entangled by the three karmas and six senses, when one’s allotted span ends, they return to emptiness, receiving retribution according to their deeds. The corpse decays into the earth, while the soul is bound in the nether realm. Unless one perished untimely in a past life, the local earth spirits and lords of the soil confine them in eternal night, with no hope of release. If their karmic debts are repaid, they descend directly to the Ghost Capital, remaining unredeemed for ten thousand kalpas. If sins outweigh merits, they endure the Five Sufferings before gradually finding a path to rebirth. If merits outweigh sins, they pass through one realm and swiftly attain the blessings of rebirth. If both sins and merits are scant, they are reborn according to their karma. If devoid of merit and burdened by great sin, they sink into hell for ten thousand kalpas. Those examined by the Fire Office face the retribution of copper pillars and iron statues, molten bronze and charcoal furnaces, fiery moats and celestial rivers, fire chariots and boiling cauldrons. Those examined by the Water Office endure icy pools and frigid ponds, vats of poison and filth. Those examined by the Record Office suffer the blows of metal hammers and iron rods. Those subjected to the Wind and Blade trial endure dismemberment, sawing, flying spears and drifting halberds, tongue-plowing, thunderous gales, blades converging from all directions, carving body and mind, knife mountains and sword forests, dismemberment, fire dogs and venomous serpents piercing flesh and bone, burning fat and grinding bones to powder, dying and reviving ten thousand times a day. As the karmic wind scatters them, they are instantly restored to form. If their sins are slight, their suffering ends, and they are reborn, though they may not regain human form, instead becoming lowly beings with incomplete features or born in the remote lands of the four barbarian tribes. If sins are heavy and karma light, they take the form of livestock. After ten lifetimes of the Five Sufferings, they may return to the human path. If sins are grave, after the Wind and Blade trial, their scattered souls drift in all directions, born through moisture and gestation into tiny insects, forever barred from regaining human form. Those whose sins are few but whose transgressions are notorious endure the Three Realms and Five Sufferings before entering the realm of hungry ghosts. After eons of rebirth, they are confined to the eternal night, bearing sand and stones, drawing from turbid waters, harnessing thunder and lightning. After their servitude, they are reborn as ghosts, suffering ugliness and deformity for countless kalpas in the eternal darkness.

Thus, Xin Xuanzi’s *Record of Dengdu* states: "There are womb-born ghosts," referring to this. Once born into the human world, all actions and conduct cultivate only sin. Intentions and emotional attachments become the roots of karma. Good deeds and virtuous karma seek retribution here and now; evil deeds and wicked karma seek retribution elsewhere. Losing human form leads to such realms, even unto Dengdu.

The Northern Emperor addressed the Supreme One, saying: "Having unfortunately served as an official in the netherworld for countless kalpas, I have never beheld the light—how much less so the lesser and sinful ghosts! Now, in accordance with the Most High’s compassionate teachings, I reveal these causes and conditions, that scholars may witness these sufferings and their significance. May they cherish the compassion of the Most High, awaken the wisdom of compassion, practice the Dharma gate of compassion, and realize the wondrous Dao of compassion. Then the suffering souls may receive the grace of compassion—how joyous would that be!"

Thus, the ancestral masters expounded this Dharma gate of salvation from suffering, composing myriad scrolls as vessels across the sea of suffering and pathways to perfection. For advanced scholars who awaken this compassionate mind, take heed not to neglect or slacken, lest their merit be lost and their efforts in vain.

The Master said: Above the Nine Purities lies the Supreme Great Luo, the Golden Portal of the Jade Capital. Within it are the covenants of the Perfected, sealed in the Jade Treasury—the Dharma gate of Lingbao for universally delivering the seen and unseen. Since the beginning of the Red Clarity’s unfolding, the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning expounded the sacred scriptures of salvation and absolution, forming covenants with all sages to vow across countless kalpas to deliver suffering souls. Hence, it is called the Covenant of the Perfected.

The canons of the Covenant of the Perfected comprise three grades: the upper contains the statutes of the Upper Prime Golden Register, the middle contains the statutes of the Middle Prime Jade Register, and the lower contains the methods of the Lower Prime Yellow Register.

In summation, this is called the Supreme Covenant of the Perfected within the Jade Treasury. The Yellow Register universally delivers the seen and unseen—an immeasurable great retreat. The method of its establishment begins with receiving the petition’s intent, then divining an auspicious site and time, proclaiming the retreat’s solemn decree, and assembling fellow disciples of shared aspiration to enter the oratory and face the retreat. They first announce to the Upper Heavens, then draft memorials to inform the Ten Heavens and Nine Earths, the Three Primes and Nine Provinces, ensuring none are left uninformed. They uphold the recitation of scripture titles, expound the liturgical protocols, burn incense and cultivate refinement, erect the altar and present memorials, distribute talismans and petition for mandates, summon and manifest the divine, awaiting resonance and communion. When merit extends to both the hidden and manifest, one’s name is inscribed in the Jade Clarity, and all under heaven embrace virtue—no merit surpasses this. One must follow the retreat’s sequential procedures with care, never recklessly disclosing them or confounding the Three Primes, for such transgressions are unforgivable. Should one encounter a Perfected who fails to propagate and transmit these teachings, obstructing the grace of the Dao, celestial judgment will swiftly descend. Disciples should carefully assess a candidate’s character and bone-signs before entrusting them.

**Seal of Faithful Trust**
The Master said: In ancient times, people were simple and sincere, embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue. They neither ate nor desired excessively, each content with their lot. With utmost sincerity alone, they could achieve resonance, requiring no wealth or treasures to harmonize with the celestial perfected. In this degenerate age, people are cunning and deceitful, coveting only wealth and goods, ignorant of karmic conditions. They scorn life and prize riches, ruining families and destroying nations, harboring myriad evils within while allying with wickedness without. They perish in succession, never awakening. For this reason, the teachings mandate dispersal: first, to prevent external strife, ensuring inner and outer tranquility, and dissolving all calamities. Thus, pledging trust and demonstrating sincerity begins with wealth. When wealth is offered, the heart follows, and sacred communion arises in accordance with one’s intent. The lofty heavens and profound earth, the mysterious sages and perfected immortals—none respond without trust, nor resonate without sincerity. The attainment of resonance and communion lies in the heart.

**Thirteen Golden Dragon Talismans:**
Ten talismans govern the ten directions, and three are submitted as the Three Memorials.

The Regulations state: Each weighs one tael and measures three cun and six fen. □For state use, employ the finest gold; for dukes, marquises, and high ministers, use secondary gold; commoners may use silver gilded with gold—all are universally applicable.

The dragon serves as the celestial courier of the lofty heavens. In transmitting messages and achieving resonance, the dragon’s steed takes precedence. Bearing the memorial, it soars to convey trust to the Three Offices; pledging oaths, it proclaims alliances to the ten poles. The method of securing trust begins with the dragon. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Yin Officials’ Bureau.

**Eleven Mirrors of Radiance:**
Ten segments govern the ten directions, and one segment, the trust-token, is placed at the center.

The Regulations state: The east features nine azure patterns; the south, three crimson patterns; the west, seven white patterns; the north, five black patterns; the upper realm, thirty-two jade-green patterns; the lower realm, thirty-two yellow patterns; the four corners, twelve yellow patterns each—totaling one hundred thirty-six across the ten directions. The state uses bolts of fabric; dukes and marquises, zhang; scholars and commoners, chi. The trust-token segment: the Son of Heaven and nobles use purple, while scholars and commoners use the color corresponding to their natal year’s sound. The length of fabric in bolts, zhang, or chi aligns with the years of the ritual’s sponsor, with one additional unit to signify the pledge of extended life.

The patterned silks manifest the colors of the Five Phases, symbolizing the qi of the ten directions, descending from the ten heavens, summoning the Five Emperors, and establishing resonance to petition for blessings and divine efficacy. These must not be omitted. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Celestial Officials’ Bureau of the Mysterious Capital.

**Ten Sets of Paper, Ink, Brush, and Inkstone:**
For the ten directions, twelve sheets of paper are allocated to each.

The Regulations state: When establishing a fast and performing the Dao, whether to deliver billions of ancestors and departed kin or to pray for blessings and dispel misfortunes, the Four Controllers, Five Emperors, and the Three Realms and Ten Directions record merits and adjudicate transgressions. Thus, paper and brush serve as the register for recording virtues, substantiating trust across the ten directions—these must not be omitted. If deficient, the Ten Heavens will not record merits, nor will the Nine Yins and Three Offices absolve transgressions. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Three Officials’ Bureau.

**Ten Trays of Incense and Flowers to Govern the Ten Directions:**
The Regulations state: Incense serves as the medium for resonance, dispelling impurities and banishing defilements. Flowers, with their fresh purity, symbolize auspiciousness and demonstrate sincerity, forming the foundation for invoking blessings and beseeching the perfected. Incense should be of the finest agarwood or sandalwood to descend the perfected; flowers should be fragrant and borne of living trees. If flowers are unavailable, five-colored silk may be cut and arranged to govern the ten directions—these must not be omitted. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Yin Officials’ Bureau.

**Two Hú and Four Dǒu of Rice (or One Hú and Two Dǒu):**
The Regulations state: Rice substantiates trust before the Celestial Officials, augmenting one’s rank and emoluments. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Celestial Officials’ Bureau.

**Two Dǒu and Four Shēng of Oil (or One Dǒu and Two Shēng):**
The Regulations state: Oil belongs to the yin category. Within yin, yang is born; thus, oil governs the Yin Officials to sustain the radiance of yang. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Yin Officials’ Bureau.

**One Hundred Twenty Jīn of Charcoal (or Twenty-Four Jīn, or Twelve Bundles):**
The Regulations state: Charcoal belongs to the yang category. Within yang, yin is born; thus, charcoal governs the Yang Officials to nourish yin qi. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Yang Officials’ Bureau.

**Twenty-Four Thousand Cash (Dukes and Marquises: Twenty-Four Strings; Scholars and Commoners: Twelve Strings, or Two Strings and Four Hundred, or One String and Two Hundred):**
The Regulations state: The twenty-four thousand cash substitute for the pledge of finest gold, substantiating sincerity across the Three Realms and proclaiming alliances to the Ten Heavens. Deficiencies are examined and attributed to the Celestial Officials’ Bureau of the Mysterious Capital.

**Thirteen Jade Discs:**
Ten for the ten directions, three for the dragon memorials.

The Regulations state: Jade possesses the virtue of purity and integrity, enabling resonance with the perfected immortals—thus, it serves as the token of trust. The ten directional discs are round with hollow centers, each two cun and four fen in diameter and two fen thick. The discs for the dragon memorials: the Celestial Official uses an azure disc, round with a hollow center; the Earth Official uses a yellow disc, square with a hollow center; the Water Official uses a black disc, hexagonal with a hollow center—each two cun and a half in diameter. For the three memorials, they are bound with golden dragons and azure silk cords, secured with golden clasps.

Azure silk replaces the cutting of hair, golden clasps replace the blood of sacrifice—thus are the Three Officials petitioned.

For omissions, refer to the Earth Official’s Nine Capitals Bureau.

**Three Catalpa Wood Tablets:**
The Regulations state: Tablets serve as records, chronicling the merits of the age and petitioning the covenants of the perfected immortals. They are square on all sides, each one chi and two cun in length, two cun and four fen in width, and two fen in thickness. For the state, they are made of jade. Jade possesses the nine virtues, embodying the trust of Heaven and Earth. For all others below, they are made of reed wood or birch.

The cinnabar boundary invokes the Five Phases; the cinnabar script records the state’s name, the year and cyclical signs, the location of the retreat, and the officiating master’s name. These are cast into renowned mountains and deep caverns, sacred springs and dragon lairs, or buried within the retreat altar. They petition the envoys of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, making clear the retreat’s purpose to be memorialized in the upper realms.

For omissions, refer to the Earth Official’s Nine Capitals Bureau.

**Twenty-Seven Golden Clasps:**
Nine are used for each tablet.
The Regulations state: Each is nine fen in diameter, round in shape like a ring. The state uses pure gold; ministers, officials, and commoners all use silver gilded with gold. Azure silk binds the dragon tablets, which are then cast. The use of nine clasps per tablet is prescribed in the *Lingbao Scriptures and Rituals*; the rest follow the *Guangcheng* regulations, which later generations dare not alter. Only the *Guangcheng* regulations specify the tablets: no talismans are inscribed, only true script on one side. In ritual methods, seal script may be used on one side, but whether to employ it or not is determined by reasoned deliberation.

**Chapter on Ritual Dignity**
The Master said: The Three Supreme Ones of the Great Highest dwell on the Jade Capital Mountain of the Mysterious Capital, within the Seven-Treasured Mysterious Terrace of the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace. The exalted sages of the ten directions, the loftiest and most revered, at the three hours of yin, wu, and xu each day, circumambulate in audience, bearing talismans and registers, raising standards and holding banners. They chant the cavernous scriptures, burn incense and scatter flowers, present the celestial music of *Jun Tian*, with phoenixes singing and dancing, the ten thousand perfected offering felicitations, and the Three Realms trembling in awe.

Today’s retreat rituals—ascending the altar to present memorials, pacing the void in circumambulation—are modeled after the Jade Capital of the Mysterious Capital. The forms of ritual dignity are all fully provided herein.

**A Pair of Flying Rainbow Banners:**
Resembling standards but without dragon or phoenix motifs, adorned with ribbons. Made of five-colored silk in three tiers, suspended from poles.

**A Pair of Vermilion Banners for Audience with the Origin:**
Pearl canopies with pearl nets, eight-angled and single-tiered, suspended from poles. The wooden core is flanked by a dragon on the left and a tiger on the right, with golden dragons holding the ribbons in their mouths.

**A Pair of Void-Dispersing Silk Nodes:**
Made of five-colored silk in five tiers, suspended from the tops of poles, with golden phoenixes holding the ribbons in their beaks.

**A Pair of Exquisite Treasure Screens:**
Adorned with pearls, brocade, and jade pendants, held by golden phoenixes, suspended from poles.

**A Pair of Five-Light Feather Fans:**
Carved from wood and decorated with gold and pigments. The upper part depicts the sun, moon, and stars; the center displays the Five Peaks; the lower part depicts the seas and mountains, mounted on vermilion poles.

**A Pair of Crane-Feather Fans:**
Carved from wood to resemble crane wings, mounted on vermilion poles.

**Lamps and Candles:**
During the pacing of the void and ritual recitations, lamps and candles are essential—not only for presenting memorials but also for dispelling misfortune. The scriptures and regulations specify varying quantities, but the key is to act according to one’s means. Alternatively, one may follow only what is recorded in the *Golden Register Tablets*: illuminating the myriad heavens, continuing brightness to dispel darkness, reaching down to the Nine Yous and hells, and shining up to the boundless halls of fortune. Among all meritorious deeds, this is the highest.

Some combine various fragrant oils with orchid unguents, ensuring all conform to ritual standards, thereby naturally invoking blessings. The purpose of lighting lamps is to continue brightness and illuminate the night. Once the sun has risen, the attendant should extinguish the lamps according to protocol. This practice remains unchanged today, and the use of lamps and candles should not be abolished.

**Chapter on Altar Canopies**
The Master said: To worship Heaven and Earth and commune with the perfected immortals, one must establish an altar to express utmost reverence. The altar formats for the Three Caverns’ retreat rituals vary in rank and differ in specifications, each detailed in their respective methods. Here, we focus solely on the *Yellow Register* retreat altar, thus not addressing others. The format is as follows.

**Format of the Lingbao Ascension and Salvation Mysterious Altar:**
According to the *Lower Prime Yellow Register Tablets* and the *Numinous Immortals’ Ranks*, the ritual for delivering salvation from karmic roots requires opening an altar on four sides in the central courtyard. Choose an auspicious site for its construction, ideally in grotto-heavens and blessed lands, renowned mountains and tranquil abodes, mysterious altars and Daoist monasteries—places untouched by battlefields, execution grounds, slaughterhouses, prisons, birthing chambers, tombs, or polluted and defiled grounds. Such a site is deemed auspicious.

The orientation must be precise, facing south with the back to the north. If the existing building’s foundation or orientation differs, determine the four directions based on true cardinal points, disregarding minor deviations or reversals. Under no circumstances should the building’s alignment dictate the altar’s orientation.

The method of constructing the altar may involve stacking precious bricks, laying patterned stones, temporarily assembling bamboo or wood, or building with rammed earth—whatever conforms to the prescribed standards to uphold the dignity of the morning memorial. Alternatively, one may erect a Heavenly Treasure Terrace, modeled after the upper realms. When conducting a retreat and pacing the void, the altar takes precedence, as if attending an audience at the Jade Capital Mountain.

The altar should be exposed to the Three Lights (sun, moon, and stars), with a bamboo or wooden frame and a thatched roof. At the altar’s center, an opening is made above to serve as a "heavenly well." A rain shelter may be prepared to guard against wind and rain, but it should not be used in clear weather.

Du Guangcheng stated: Ordinary sentiment favors an open altar, yet sincerity’s resonance transcends the Nine Heavens, while lack of devotion turns even jade steps into barriers. If the cinnabar prohibitions move the perfected immortals and one’s focused intent aligns with the divine, how can mere structures obstruct? After the altar is consecrated, one must not walk backward within it or allow outsiders to profane the sacred. The prohibitions are stringent.

Moreover, as weather is unpredictable, if wind and rain suddenly arise during a memorial presentation, disrupting the solemn and orderly proceedings, causing haste and disorder, the ritual’s beginning and end will be thrown into chaos, and reverence will be entirely lost.

Thus, the Confucians refrain from offering sacrifices when their attire is disordered or their demeanor improper, precisely to guard against such lapses. Judged by this standard, an altar enclosed within a hall allows for unbroken circumambulation from beginning to end, ensuring no breach of ritual decorum and naturally fostering resonance with the divine. The *Yellow Register Simplified Writs* states: The upper tier of the altar shall have four sides and four corners, with upper and lower directions, together forming ten gates, each two *zhang* and four *chi* in width. Beyond these ten gates, open the Heavenly Gate and Earthly Portal, the Sun Gate and Moon Gate, and at the four corners construct a single gate, each three *zhang* and two *chi* in width, called the Four-Boundary General Gates, where the Eight Trigrams inscribed plaques are placed. The scriptures record only two tiers, embodying the principle of modeling heaven and emulating earth. Now, according to the *Guangcheng Ritual Standards*, the altar is built with three tiers: the upper tier two *zhang* and four *chi* square, the middle tier three *zhang* and two *chi* square, and the lower tier four *zhang* square. Alternatively, if the upper tier is one *zhang* and eight *chi*, then the middle tier is two *zhang* and eight *chi*, and the lower tier’s perimeter is only three *chi* wide—this is also permissible. The middle tier must allow space for prostration and kneeling and thus cannot be too narrow. Each tier is typically two *chi* and three *cun* high, or one *chi* and two *cun*, one *chi* and five *cun*, or nine *cun* as a standard. If the terrain is cramped, one may deviate from the prescribed measurements, adjusting the altar’s size and height according to the available space and the hall’s dimensions. Alternatively, on level ground, an altar with only two tiers may suffice. Flexibility is key; one must not be rigid.

For the upper tier’s ten gates, use twenty long *zuan* and ten short *zuan*, along with ten gate plaques. For the middle tier’s western gate, use eight long *zuan* and twenty short *zuan*, with four gate plaques. For the lower tier’s eight gates, use sixteen long *zuan* and sixteen short *zuan*, with eight gate plaques. In total, the three tiers require forty-four long *zuan* and fifty-four short *zuan*. The long *zuan* extend one *zhang* and nine *chi* above ground, while the short ones are seven *chi* and six *cun* embedded in the earth, making ninety-eight *zuan* in all. The *Zhang Qingdu* ritual uses only sixty-four *zuan*, as it has only two tiers, with the Eight Trigrams *zuan* arranged outside the altar. The length of the *zuan* need not be fixed; it may vary according to the hall’s height. When arranging the *zuan*, adjust their spacing to suit the terrain, ensuring uniformity in density. The *zuan* are crafted from wood, lacquered in red, with carved plaques depicting lotus and flaming pearl motifs. The sides of the gates are engraved with images of the sun, moon, and auspicious clouds, all executed with precision. The twenty-two gate plaques are each three *cun* and three *fen* wide and two *cun* and four *fen* long, decorated in the five colors corresponding to their directions and inscribed with gate names.

Between every two *zuan* on all three tiers, mount a lamp holder and fashion five-colored lotus lamps, alternating them. When lit at night, these total ninety-eight lamps. The three tiers of *zuan* are bound with crimson or azure cords, wrapped three times. The first wrapping begins below the floral head of the long *zuan*, encircling the gates. The second wrapping begins below the floral head of the short *zuan*. The third wrapping is placed roughly two *chi* above the second, aligned in height. The second and third wrappings should not obstruct the gates. At the heads of the long *zuan*, cross the cords in a grid pattern and hang small floral branches and banners, alternating them uniformly across all three tiers.

The altar’s surface is covered with thirty-eight sets of woven mats. The outer two tiers are enclosed with twelve bolts of yellow cloth, arranged neatly and with meticulous care. Outside the upper tier’s gates, hang thirty-two Heavenly Banners, their colors corresponding to the directions. At the altar’s center, suspend three Heavenly Banners, and around it hang the Five Directions’ Guardian Spirit Banners. Within the altar, set up a canopy and throne, arranging the seats of the Three Supreme Lords of the Great Dao. Place the sacred scriptures at the center, and around them arrange the altars for the ten directions, each adorned with incense, flowers, and ritual offerings according to their respective directions. Additionally, set up two ritual tables, positioned only at the Heavenly Gate in the *qian* direction, with a single gate for entry and exit, symbolizing heaven. The middle tier is arranged with the positions of the six ranks of officials, with entry and exit restricted to the Earthly Portal in the *xun* direction of the southeast, symbolizing earth. All who ascend the altar to perform the fast and circumambulate must enter and exit through the Earthly Portal; no other gates may be used. The lower tier opens a single gate in the *li* direction for entry and exit. Outside the altar, arrange lamps according to the prescribed method. On the altar, display ritual talismans and standards corresponding to the directions.

Beyond the three tiers, erect floral pillars, each three *chi* or five *chi* high, to demarcate the purified space, with a single gate for entry and exit. The rest are cordoned off with azure cords. For each side of the altar, assign three attendants to maintain ritual decorum, totaling twelve. They must remain orderly and disciplined, without gaps or crowding. When performing the *Step of Emptiness* or circumambulation, they must follow the prescribed sequence. To the left and right of the altar, set up six tents and twelve elevated platforms for administrative duties. For minor fasts, one need not construct an altar with bells and chimes; the rituals may be conducted within the oratory.

Ascending the altar serves as a proxy for the Primordial Beginning’s responsive transformation; thus, one first establishes ritual decorum to govern the myriad heavens. According to the great ritual, the arrangement of gates, the illumination of the four directions, and the lamp diagrams are detailed below.

**Upper Tier: Ten Gates**

*Dao Portal Lamps:* 2
*Life Destiny Lamps:* 2 (aligned with the twelve earthly branches according to birth year)
*Current Age Lamps:* 7 (men begin at *yin*, women at *shen*)
*Grand Year Lamp:* 1 (aligned with the current year’s direction)
*Great Tomb Lamps:* 3 (*gong* and *yu* at *chen*; *shang* at *chou*; *jiao* at *wei*; *zhi* at *xu*)
*Lesser Tomb Lamps:* 5 (*gong* and *yu* at *xu*; *shang* at *wei*; *jiao* at *chou*; *zhi* at *chen*)
*Seven Ancestors Lamps:* 7 (southwest direction)
*Nine Dark Realms Lamps:* 9 (alternatively, arranged in eight directions with the center; northeast direction assigned to southwest; nine hell tablets erected above)
*Flanking Gate Lamps:* 2 (opposite the Dao Portal Lamps, placed to the left and right of the gate)
*Twenty-Four Qi Lamps:* 24 (southeast direction)
*Eight Trigrams Lamps:* 8 (arranged in eight directions, each with a tablet)
*Nine Palaces Lamps:* 9 (arranged in eight directions, center assigned to *kun*; aligned with the *Huoluo* Dipper’s nine palaces)
*Ten Directions Lamps:* 10 (arranged in ten directions)
*Twenty-Eight Constellations Lamps:* 28 (beginning at the east, arranged counterclockwise in each direction; seven constellations starting from *Jiao*)
*Thirty-Six Heavens Lamps:* 36 (above Heaven Gate)
*Five Peaks Lamps:* 5 (arranged in four directions, center assigned to the west)

The above lamps total sixteen types, comprising one hundred fifty-nine lamps, each placed according to its direction, as previously detailed. Each lamp is accompanied by a tablet inscribed with its name, such as *Dao Portal Lamp*, *Jiao Constellation Lamp*, *East Wind-Thunder Earth Prison Lamp*, *First Palace Lamp*, *East Direction Lamp*, *Eastern Peak Lamp*, and the like.

In this rite, the *Seven Ancestors Lamps* and *Nine Dark Realms Lamps* are lit in the central courtyard, which may obstruct ritual proceedings. Their directional placements have already been specified above. Additionally, the *Zhaitu Shixian* Altar Diagram by Master Tianju includes *Six Jia*, *Eight Solar Terms*, *Ten Directives*, *Five La*, *Sun Palace*, and *Moon Palace* lamps, though these lack canonical basis. The *Golden Register Simplified Texts* also omit their ritual invocations. Furthermore, the lamp arrangements for the *Five Peaks* and *Seven Ancestors* differ from those described here in bowl counts and diagrams. Rather than altering them, both versions are preserved for consideration by learned scholars.

If the *Twenty-Eight Constellations* lamps are lit according to their stellar configurations, the total reaches three hundred thirteen lamps. The scale should be adjusted according to one’s capacity. Generally, burning incense and lighting lamps are the foremost acts of merit in purification rites. Other matters may be expanded as needed, but these are not discussed here. Only the lamps mirroring heaven and earth should be arranged with utmost generosity.

With reverence, I have consulted astronomical texts to produce these diagrams. May they be carefully examined.

*Guangcheng* states: If the altar space is too narrow to arrange the lamps, they may be placed elsewhere while adhering to the ritual invocations.

**Left Canopy of the Mysterious Master (1):**
The Mysterious Master of Numinous Treasure serves as the Transformative Sovereign of the Three Heavens and the Preceptor of the Teaching’s Expansion. When conducting purification rites, one must first petition and invoke them to witness the merit of the rite. A canopy is erected, and a sacred image, table, and offerings of incense and flowers are arranged according to ritual propriety.

**Right Canopy of the Five Emperors (1):**
The Five Venerable Lords of Highest Sovereignty oversee the records of merit and transgression in heaven, verifying the merit of purification rites. According to ancient protocols, they were placed at the altars of the five directions. The *Guangcheng Rites* now prescribe their separate arrangement north of the Three Masters’ positions, opposite the Mysterious Master, with canopies, tables, and furnishings arranged according to ritual propriety.

**Left Canopy of the Heavenly Master (2):**
The Orthodox Heavenly Master of the One serves as the Dharma Sovereign of the Three Heavens and the Preceptor of Ritual Dispensation. For all purification rites, one must petition and invoke them to expound the teachings according to ritual propriety.

**Right Canopy of the Three Masters (2):**
The Three Masters of Scriptures and Ordinations serve as the Foundational Preceptors of Liberation, embodying the essence of sustaining mindfulness. Their teachings are expounded according to ritual propriety.

**Left Canopy of the Three Officials (3):**
The Three Officials oversee the records of the Three Primes’ examinations, verifying the merit of purification rites. Their teachings are expounded according to ritual propriety.

**Right Canopy of the Purification Overseer (3):**
The Purification Overseer presides over the Numinous Treasure purification rites, supervising the proceedings. Their teachings are expounded according to ritual propriety.

The six canopies above are arranged to the left and right before the Mysterious Altar in sequence. Additionally, there is the canopy for the *Three Masters of Orthodox Unity*, reflecting the reverence for ancestral preceptors at the Orthodox Unity ancestral altar of Mount Longhu. Master Tian, however, incorporated this canopy while placing the *Three Masters of Scriptures and Ordinations* above Heaven Gate, leading to the common but erroneous notion of the *Three Masters of Heaven Gate*. This is not part of the original canon. When conducting Numinous Treasure purification rites, one should adhere to the ancient protocols.

If the space is too narrow to accommodate six canopies, they may be consolidated into three canopies on the left, right, and center. Each canopy is divided into three sections with curtains, and three sets of incense, flowers, and tables are arranged within. All are positioned centrally for mutual veneration and ritual proceedings, with the center as the most honored, the left as secondary, and the right as tertiary.

May this be carefully examined in detail.

**Hall and Terrace Regulations**

The Master said: When establishing a grand purification rite, one must first erect the Twelve Halls and Terraces to summon and assemble the lofty immortals and true spirits, assigning each to their respective offices and sacred stations. The protocols for dispatching, invoking, and praying must be meticulously observed.

1. **Azure Flower Hall (Qinghua Tang)**
   At its center, install the positions of the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor and the Left and Right Perfected Ones. Above, place the *Chart of the Azure Vault and Empty Songs*. Each day, burn incense and recite three *Hymns of Salvation*, performing the Nine Morning Circuits in reverent procession.

   This hall must be established prior to the preliminary announcement to transmit the *Memorial for Heavenly Salvation*. Erect the Azure Mystery Banner here for ritual proceedings.

2. **Divine Tiger Hall (Shenhu Tang)**
   Following the preliminary announcement, select a chamber at the *Gen* (Northeast) gate. At its center, install the Divine Tiger Lady and her officials. To the left and right, establish the Yin and Yang altars. In the middle, facing upward, set the Eight Gates Summoning Terrace for souls, with the *Summoning Soul Tablets* placed on either side. All matters concerning the issuance of jade missives to summon the deceased are conducted here.

   Some refer to this as the *Mystic Portal of the Divine Tiger*.

3. **Censure Bureau (Jiucha Si)**
   At its center, install the positions of the Five Masters and the Three Officials. The Nine Morning Censures are conducted here.

   If the Six Canopies are already in place, this hall need not be established.

4. **Refinement Hall (Jingsi Tang)**
   Also called the *Hall of True Preservation* or *Hall of Silent Contemplation*.
   At its center, install the position of the Orthodox Unity Heavenly Master and the ancestral masters of the purification rites. A high seat and table are arranged, where the High Merit Master resides, with the six ranks of officials positioned in order. All morning and evening devotions, as well as entries and exits, occur within this chamber.

5. **Netherworld Officials’ Hall (Mingguan Tang)**
   At its center, install the positions of the Ten Kings of Mount Tai and Fengdu, along with all subordinate netherworld bureaus. Arrange them according to their ranks.

6. **Life-Monitoring Bureau (Jiansheng Si)**
   At its center, set the tables for the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Ones, above which the *True Writs of Life-Monitoring* are placed. Summoned souls are brought here for deliverance and healing.

7. **Celestial Physicians’ Hall and Purification Chamber (Tianyi Yuan Danghui Suo)**
   At its center, install the positions of the Celestial Physicians and all attendant transcendent officials, along with the purifying and drying immortals. Summoned souls receive medical treatment and ablutions here.

8. **Refinement-Receiving Bureau (Shoulian Si)**
   At its center, install the positions of the Supreme Emperor and the various honored ones. To the left and right, array the officials and officers of refinement. All rites of transformation and refinement are conducted here.

   If space is too narrow to establish this hall, proceed as scheduled, or arrange the positions of the refinement and deliverance officials to the left and right within the ritual arena, conducting rites at the center. Since the position of the Supreme Emperor is already present in the ritual arena, it need not be duplicated.

9. **Yellow Register Court (Huanglu Yuan)**
   At its center, install the tables for the Perfected Saints of the Yellow Register Court, above which the talismans of the Primordial Beginning and the Divine Empyrean Perfected Ones are placed. The deliverance of suffering souls is its primary function.

10. **Life-Receiving Bureau (Shousheng An)**
    At its center, install the table for the Sacred Position of Life-Receiving, above which the records of judged and destined souls—along with their ranks and destinies—are placed. This bureau is solely responsible for their registration.

11. **Five Paths General Prefecture (Wudao Dufu)**
    At its center, install the positions of the Five Paths deities, who govern the opening and closing of the earth’s gates and the salvation of all classes of wandering souls in the Five Paths.

12. **Memorial-Presenting Bureau (Tongzhang Si)**
    Install the positions of the spirit officials and officers of the *From-Chapter* here, arranging them according to rank. All presentations of memorials and petitions are conducted here.

**Auxiliary Stations**

- **Ritual Inspection Bureau (Ou Lin Suo)**
  Install the positions of the officials and officers of the master’s own methods and all received teachings, along with the attending officers, merit officials, and direct talismans. Arrange them as appropriate on the western side of the altar.

  Alternatively, this may serve as the *Local Domain Bureau* for the earth deity.

  As Du Yi stated: *"Through summons and presentations, resonance is conveyed to the Supreme Mystery."*
  When establishing a ritual arena, the earth deity is paramount. Its position should be set opposite the altar.

  Nowadays, it is also reasonable to include the city gods, local earth deities, and the Five Paths deities of the area in this *Local Domain Bureau*.

- **Nine Ancestors’ Hall as Deliverance Hall (Jiuzu Wei Zuo Shoudu Tang)**
  For the deliverance of the Nine Dark Realms and the purification of the Nine Ancestors, a position should be set opposite the altar. At its center, install the Nine Ancestors and the Seven Generations of kin, arranging them appropriately with offerings of food and drink, all according to protocol.

  As Du Yi stated: *"Establish it in the southeast."*

- **Universal Deliverance Hall (Pudu Tang)**
  Construct an outer enclosure with four gates, each marked with a placard: *Eastern Fragrant Realm*, *Southern Jambudvīpa*, *Western Godānīya*, and *Northern Uttarakuru*. Cover the roof with white cogon grass, and encircle the structure with green curtains. Building it near a wild riverbank is especially auspicious.

  Surround it with earthen walls, evenly painted with cinnabar. At its center, construct a two-tiered platform. On the upper tier, place a water basin containing an iron tablet inscribed with the *Luminous Chapter of the Terrace*. Install the positions of the Six Paths’ wandering souls. On all four sides, arrange offerings of food, wine, and fruit, with a central *Bushel of Nourishment*. Extensively prepare the *Nine Springs and Myriad Sands* for the ghostly multitudes to hasten their rites.

  Erect this on the *Shen* (Monkey) day and dismantle it on the day the altar is dispersed.

- **Retreat Chamber (Jingshi)**
  The place where the High Merit Master visualizes spirits, inscribes talismans, and writes registers. At its center, install the Perfected Sovereign of the Yellow Register and the transcendent officials of the register’s central canon. Arrange them appropriately. This chamber must be established after the preliminary announcement.

- **Scripture-Recitation Hall (Songjing Tang)**
  At its center, install the position of the Three Treasures. From the day of the preliminary announcement and the gathering of the alliance, the recitation of scriptures, mantras, and sacred titles, as well as the rites of repentance, are conducted here.

- **Soul-Gathering Prefecture (Juhun Fu)**
  At its center, install the positions of the Five Sovereigns of Universal Soul-Gathering, who are solely responsible for assembling the souls of the deceased and summoning the *qi* of the true and living.

**Protocol for Ritual Guards (Yiwei Zhang)**
The Master said: When establishing halls and terraces, the prohibitions and taboos are strict.

Fourteen talismanic seals shall be employed to guard the numinous spirits and pacify the four directions.

When inscribing them, recite two secret incantations, invoke the Jade Purity mudra, and draw the primordial azure, yellow, and white *qi* from the Gate of Heaven, then blow it upon the talismans. These may be transcribed onto boards and hung around the altar’s perimeter, or written and burned as needed.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Chariot and Green Palanquin**
With cinnabar ink and empowered brush, adorn and array the sacred emblems—radiant essences intermingling. The chariot and palanquin traverse the winds, their feathered canopies and jade wheels resplendent.

**Talisman of the Feathered Canopy of Primordial Origin**
The ancestral *qi* congeals, the root of chaos and beginning. Ten revolutions return the numinous, its brilliance unfurling.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Phoenix**
The vermilion phoenix harnesses the carriage, dispelling defilement and manifesting might. The Four Numinous Beasts quake in submission as it soars, its resplendent fan trailing.

**Talisman of the Mystic Dragon**
The five-hued mystic dragon leaps and treads the great void. With brush and inception, it commands the rushing surge, its ninefold hues arrayed in majesty.

**Talisman of the Nine-Colored Standard**
Its halberd gleams with precious light, transforming under the Empty Sovereign. Pure Yang coalesces into Sanskrit, its blossoms scattering across the purple hall.

**Talisman of the Ten Absolute Numinous Banners**
The whirlwind encampment surges, its precious light diffusing. Its radiance outshines the sun, and the myriad sages gaze in reverence.

**Talisman of the Nine Phoenixes in Unison**
The primordial *qi* disperses, vast as clouds and rosy dawn. The nine phoenixes chant in harmony.

**Talisman of the Eight Simurghs in Chorus**
The sevenfold *qi* swirls, encircling Kunlun. The eight simurghs sing as one.

**Talisman of the Five-Colored Lions**
The myriad defilements are crushed and subdued; the ten thousand beasts gaze in awe. It strides alone, fearless, its mighty presence universally bestowed. Immeasurable grace and boundless strength are dispensed, as it sits upright at the center, receiving the Dao in effortless serenity.

**Talisman of the Nine-Light White Cranes**
In accord with the Dao, it delights in radiance, its light illuminating the ten directions. Opening the light atop its crown, the feathered cranes soar, circling the distant Great Void, their whistles and chants heralding auspicious signs.

**Talisman of the Azure Dragon Attendant**
The Supreme Mystery and Luminance expound the Dharma in the forest of transcendence. The Three Realms attend in guard; the eight directions’ mighty spirits render me naturally empowered. Demonic spirits are bound, merging with the Dao in truth. Wondrous *qi* weaves to its end, transforming into dragon form.

**Talisman of the White Tiger’s Guardianship**
The sevenfold *qi* align in response; the great law harmonizes with the flourishing. The celestial patterns of the supreme Dharma congeal *qi* into form. The Five Emperors observe in unison, their jade tablets and primordial purity sealed. The White Tiger guards, the altar’s numinous splendor resplendent.

**Talisman of the Vermilion Bird’s Solar Essence**
The immortal Dao is naturally auspicious; the Highest Purity and numinous clarity ascend. Luminous *qi* soars in four directions, forging life in the Vermilion Mound. The solar *qi* gathers, its resplendent mystery blazing. The Vermilion Bird shields and upholds the eternal Dao.

**Talisman of the Dark Warrior’s Rear Guard**
Amidst the myriad transformations in the void, its towering might subdues the ten thousand heavens. Receiving the mandate of the Supreme Blade, its profound vastness unites the forms of tortoise and serpent.

**Talisman for Summoning the Five Directions’ Attendant Officers and Soldiers to Guard the Altar**
The Master said: These six talismans may summon the five directions’ fivefold numinous spirits, the attendant officers and soldiers of all heavens, and the five directions’ Celestial Emperors with their attendant green-clad officials and soldiers.

In all ritual procedures and recitations of incantations, visualize the various heavens of each direction descending in state, their golden light resplendent across the great void. The Celestial Emperors and their attendants descend through the air, their rare fragrance pervading the expanse. These may be transcribed onto boards and hung to guard the ritual altar.

**True Talisman of the Nine Numinous Wondrous Scenery of the Primordial Essence of the Beginning Light**
Inscribe this talisman in vermilion on blue paper, facing the east with the *qi* of Zhen, and burn it to summon the ninefold *qi* of the Azure Numinous heavens and their attendant officers and soldiers.

**Section on Ritual Altar Diagrams: Banners, Canopies, and Talismans**

The Master said: For every altar, each banner must bear one talisman, inscribed strictly according to the prescribed method. No other methods may be intermixed.

**Talismans for the Five Directions’ Protective Spirit Banners**
- **East**
- **South**
- **West**
- **North**
- **Center**

Inscribe these five talismans on the front of the banners for the five directions of the Mystic Altar. Only the southern talisman is written in black; the rest are in vermilion.

Recite the **Five Directions’ Protective Spirit Incantation** while inscribing, for this is the *qi* of the Ninefold Azure Heavens.

This talisman derives from *The Cavern Abyss Protective Spirit Incantation Register*.

**Talismans for the Five Directions’ Altar-Guarding**
- **Eastern Azure Emperor Incantation**
  Nine *qi* sprout in yang,
  Jade calendar’s dragon script.
  The Eight Trigrams spread without,
  One virtue hides within.
  Transformation arises from me,
  Death and decay reverse to auspice.

- **Southern Vermilion Emperor Incantation**
  Southern mound’s triple lights,
  *Qi* fills, radiance blazes.
  Nurturing and rectifying,
  No evil can withstand.
  Vermilion fire, stone fire—
  Commanded by me.

- **Western White Emperor Incantation**
  Great White’s flowing essence,
  Seven stars guard the numinous.
  Qian’s virtue inwardly preserved,
  Metal and fire cannot harm.
  What life cannot transform,
  White Prime employs its brightness.

- **Northern Black Emperor Incantation**
  Mystic virtue’s five numina,
  Salvation’s primordial unity.
  Embryonic essence joins demons,
  Inwardly pervading the seven.
  Yin fire inwardly revolves,
  Mystic virtue transforms to clarity.
  Drowning ghosts and bandits,
  Slay and extinguish evil spirits.

- **Central Yellow Emperor Incantation**
  Central Lord of all spirits,
  Twelve primordial perfected.
  Governing the four great,
  Primordial Jade Dawn.
  **Incantation**
  Mystic Emperor, High Perfected,
  Primordial Five Elders.
  Inscribe talismans, transmit teachings,
  Enable me to practice the Dao.
  Today is the time,
  Transmit the true, confer the Dao.
  *Establish the retreat* (amend to: *Establish the retreat and practice the Dao*).
  Summon spirits, bind demons,
  Disasters and calamities sweep away.
  Five Directions’ great spirits,
  Reverently submit to the Three Treasures.
  Those who follow me prosper,
  Ultimately attaining agelessness.
  Escape death, enter life,
  Flourishing yet unaging.
  Those who defy me perish,
  Living, they meet hardship;
  Dying, they descend to the Dark Capital,
  Tortured in hell.

Place the four directional talismans at the four gates, and the central talisman at the door of the retreat hall. Burn incense and pray:

*"Let the two Direct Talisman Officers of the [X] Emperor emerge. Today, the duty officer [Name] and his retinue of [Number] attendants, six dragons, each in strict attire, holding jade and bearing tablets, ascend to the imperial court. We submit this talisman to initiate the matter. From this moment until the Dao-practice concludes, ensure all is orderly and nothing is omitted."*

Proceed accordingly. Only in the last month of each season is the Yellow Emperor used; otherwise, follow the Five Emperors.

Alternatively, inscribe these five talismans on the reverse of the five directional banners.

Cai Zhixu and Lu Shizhong used these when borrowing land to establish altars.

*The Three Supreme Departments’ Talismans* call these the **Residence-Guarding Talismans**, inscribed on boards to guard the five directions. They originate from *The Lingbao Scripture of Ascending Mystery*.

**Three Heavens Banner**
**Thirty-Two Heavens Banner**

The Master said: Each banner should measure either three feet and two inches or two feet and four inches. The eastern banner has eight green heads, the southern eight red, the western eight white, and the northern eight black. Alternatively, following the method of *The Scripture of Salvation Through the Degrees of Humanity*, use the nine colors—yellow, green, blue, red, dark green, black, purple, and white—arranged in sequence from the Heaven of Supreme Sovereignty. This is also permissible.

On the front of the banner, inscribe the titles of the Heavenly Emperors; on the reverse, seal the talismans of the Thirty-Two Heavens. These originate from *The Great Kalpa Scripture of Numinous Treasure*, differing from the rites of *The Supreme Perfected Regulations for the Numinous Treasure Nine Heavens Life-Safeguarding and Destiny-Preserving Retreat*. The talismans of the Thirty-Two Heavens are found in the section on talismanic script in the scriptures.

**Azure Mystery Treasure Canopy**
The Master said: When making a preliminary announcement, first erect the Azure Mystery Canopy. The method requires azure silk measuring forty-nine feet. Construct a top crown to form a great treasure canopy, fashioned with eight corners, from which hang eight small banners. In the center, suspend a large banner to complete the treasure canopy, aligning it with the nine provinces’ astrological divisions. On the banner’s body, seal the Great Nine Dragons Talisman in realgar, with the legs spread apart. Seal the Azure Mystery Treasure Proclamation Talisman between the feet, and inscribe the intent of the retreat on the two hands. Hang it from a tall pole. This serves to communicate with Heaven, deliver the suffering, announce to the ten directions, and halt trials for the imprisoned.

Another method states: The Supreme Unity Treasure Banner is made of yellow silk and may also be inscribed with talismans following this pattern. The Nine Dragons Talisman and the Azure Palace Treasure Harmony are both found in the section on talismanic script in the retreat methods.

**Oath-Announcing Treasure Banner**
The Master said: When establishing a grand retreat, first erect the Oath-Announcing Banner. Make it of double-layered yellow silk, also forty-nine feet in length. On the banner’s body, seal the August Title of the Jade Emperor—*Jade Emperor, Great Heavenly Worthy, Mysterious Lofty High Sovereign*—in ten characters at the center, and inscribe the intent of the retreat on the two hands. Hang it from a tall pole in an open space before the altar. This announces to the boundless heavens, pledges alliance with the Three Realms, and pre-announces the retreat’s schedule, serving as a pledge for the period of merit-building. Thus, the hidden and obscure are made manifest, and gods and spirits gaze from afar, as the ritual objects and forms are displayed.

Another method: At the top, write: *“Your servant respectfully submits”* in five characters. On the body, inscribe: *“The Supreme, Boundless Dao; the Utmost True, Primordial Supreme; the Thirty-Six Sections of the Venerable Scriptures; the True Writ and Treasure Talismans of the Three Supreme Worthies; the Ten Directions’ Hosts of Sages; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Officials and Attendants of the Three Realms; all mighty numina—humbly beseech your radiant grace to witness this retreat’s affairs”*—forty-nine characters in total. On the two hands and feet, inscribe the ranks of the Dharma, adapting to the practitioner’s intent. The August Title of the Jade Emperor is found in the section on talismanic script in the retreat methods.

The Banner for Translocating Spirits and Returning to the Yellow Treasure

The Master says: When establishing the Nine Dark Prisons, one must first erect the Banner for Translocating Spirits and Returning to the Yellow, positioned to the east of the altar. The method employs white and yellow silk, layered together and fashioned into a banner forty-nine feet in length. Inscribe the talismans according to the prescribed form, then suspend it aloft where the wind may freely stir it. The lonely souls and suffering spirits of the Ten Directions and Nine Dark Realms, upon beholding this banner and the direction its tassels point, shall have their myriad torments dissolved and swiftly awaken to their virtuous nature. If they raise their voices in praise, the merit before humans and heavens shall be most profound, revering the precious treasure and venerating it to fulfill wondrous fruition.

Another method: On the two hands, inscribe the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, five on each side. Beneath the left hand, write *Savior of Suffering Perfected* and *Great Compassion Perfected*; beneath the right hand, write *Remover of Transgressions Perfected* and *Deliverer Perfected*. On the two feet, inscribe the *Sweet Dew Mantra*. The use remains the same.

*Delivering and Receiving the Born-Anew Spirits*
*Returning to Radiant Brilliance Banner*

The Master says: For all constructions of the Wheel Lamp of Returning Radiance, the Banner of Returning Radiance is always erected to the southeast of the wheel. The method requires crimson silk, thirty-six feet in length, doubled and fashioned, with cinnabar and orpiment ground together to inscribe the talismans on both front and back according to the prescribed pattern. On the front, either inscribe in seal script the ten characters of *Compassionate Transforming Lord, Treasure Banner, Welcoming and Guiding Heavenly Worthy*, and suspend it high in the void. When the dark and hidden souls of the ten directions behold this numinous banner, with a single thought of refuge, the winds arise, and the dust-labor of transgressive hindrances and grave offenses are all absolved and dissolved, allowing ascent to the Southern Palace.

The Master says: On the day of reestablishing the ritual arena, the Banner for Deliverance may be erected. The method requires yellow silk, doubled and fashioned, twenty-four feet in length, inscribed according to the prescribed pattern.

The Master says: At the banner’s head, inscribe the Inner Taboo Name of the Supreme Emperor; on the banner’s body, seal-script the eight characters of *The Six Jia Envoys Hold the Banner and Open the Way*; on the two hands, seal-script the *Empty Cavern Penetrating the Dark Mantra*; on the two feet, seal-script the four lines of the *Precept Scripture*.

**Prison Lamps Diagram Chapter**
Transmitted by Dongwei Gaoshi, Illuminating and Salvation-Aiding Perfected Lord Ning Quanzhen, to the Shangqing Three Caverns Disciple, Lingbao Preceptor and Lineage Master Wang Qizhen

The Master says: Whenever establishing a grand fast, one must break through darkness and continue illumination, open and release all prisons, and pardon all sinful souls. Arrange according to the diagrams and methods as prescribed below.

**Nine Goblets and Nine Mounds Lamp Diagram**
The Master says: For the salvation rite, lamps should be fashioned into a tree according to proper method. Beneath it, establish the Wheel of Heaven and Earth—round to symbolize Heaven, square to symbolize Earth. Divide the three luminaries to illuminate the nine mounds, array the eight extremities to center the August One. From the deceased’s initial passing through the seven sevens, ensure the lamp light continues unbroken to pierce the gates of darkness.

The method for constructing the lamp tree: Use catalpa wood to craft a single lamp tree, dividing its top into nine goblets, each holding one lamp. Below, form a three-tiered altar of pure earth, round above and square below. On the upper tier, place the lamp tree, from which hang nine-headed banners. On the middle tier, erect the Nine Qi Tablets and set nine lamps. On the lower tier, establish the Nine Mounds August Lords’ tablets and set nine lamps. The three tiers together hold twenty-seven lamps. Outside, arrange the Eight Trigrams and Eight Gates, lighting eight lamps to illuminate above the Nine Heavens, through the Nine Wilds, and below the Nine Mounds. The light converges into nine pathways, extending outward to the Eight Extremities, encircling the ten directions. In total, thirty-five lamps represent the thirty-five divisions of primordial qi, the method of the Supreme Mystery.

**Nine Qi Tablets**
1. Imperial Perfected Womb-Life, Primordial Unity’s Yellow-Expanse Qi
2. Imperial Perfected Embryo-Life, Cavernous Obscurity’s Purple-Chamber Qi
3. Imperial Perfected Soul-Life, Everlasting Numinous Bright Immortal Qi
4. Imperial Perfected Corpse-Life, Radiant Corpse’s Obscure-Expanse Qi
5. Imperial Perfected Viscera-Life, Five Immortals’ Central Numinous Qi
6. Imperial Perfected Spirit-Mansion Life, Lofty Perfected’s Pervasive Harmony Qi
7. Imperial Perfected Primordial-Mansion Life, Lofty Immortal’s Cavernous Summit Qi
8. Imperial Perfected Flower-Mansion Life, Perfected Numinous’ Transformative Coagulation Qi
9. Imperial Perfected Peak-Mansion Life, Spontaneous Mysterious Illumination Qi

**Nine Mounds Tablets**
1. First Mound: Cavernous Abyss Marshland Earth Sovereign
2. Second Mound: Vajra Marshland Earth Sovereign
3. Third Mound: Ochre-Colored Marshland Earth Sovereign
4. Fourth Mound: Lustrous Marshland Earth Sovereign
5. Fifth Mound: Golden Grain Marshland Earth Sovereign
6. Sixth Mound: Vajra Iron-Colored Marshland Earth Sovereign
7. Seventh Mound: Water-Restrained Marshland Earth Sovereign
8. Eighth Mound: Great Wind Marshland Earth Sovereign
9. Ninth Mound: Cavernous Abyss Colorless Marshland Earth Sovereign

**Nine Dark Prisons Diagram**
The Master says: Model Heaven and emulate Earth, forming the pattern with square and round.

**Nine Dark Ministries: Overseers of Sin and Judgment**

The Nine Dark Ministries govern transgressions and decrees, their jurisdiction encompassing the Luo and Deng regions, with their seat in the southeast at the *si* earthly branch. According to the statutes of the Supreme One and the Sacred Perfected, nine altars of sand and soil are constructed, each two feet square. The nine altars together form a single whole, totaling six feet in breadth, modeling Earth’s yin and embodying the extreme of the two-six configuration. Each altar is shaped with four corners and three bends, resembling the form of a prison. Within each prison, three lamps are lit, making twenty-seven lamps in total across the nine prisons. At the heart of each prison, a tablet is erected according to its directional alignment. On the front of each tablet is inscribed the *Breaking the Earth Prisons Talisman*—refer to the *Talisman Gate of the Purification Rites* for its form. On the reverse is written the prison’s name, and above each tablet hangs one of the nine banners. The design is detailed in the *Seal-Cover Chapter*. Additionally, nine yellow banners are prepared, each inscribed with the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Chapter Talisman*. When the nine prisons are broken, the nine banners are burned, and these yellow banners are then hung in their place. First, the *Yellow Banner for Guiding Spirits* is erected, allowing the dark souls to behold it, whereby all myriad sins are extinguished.

The Nine Dark Prisons reside in the central palace of the Eight Trigrams. According to the division of the Nine Provinces, each is overseen by its local earth deity. In Heaven, they correspond to the Nine Heavens; on Earth, to the Nine Palaces; and in transformation, they take the form of the Nine Dark Prisons. Though they bear nine names, all arise from a single *qi* and are summoned by a single thought. For every evil thought harbored by the deceased, the corresponding prison manifests, and retribution follows. Thus, the Most High, in boundless compassion, established these purification rites to deliver and uplift suffering souls—know well their origin:

1. **Dark Nether (幽冥)**: Transformed from the nine *qi* of the eastern *Zhen* trigram. All burgeoning life and stirring creatures await the awakening of wind and thunder, hence its name: *Wind and Thunder*.
2. **Dark Yin (幽阴)**: Transformed from the three *qi* of the southern *Li* trigram. Fire reaches its utmost yang, giving rise to the way of extreme yang generating yin, hence its name: *Fire’s Veil*.
3. **Dark Night (幽夜)**: Transformed from the seven *qi* of the western *Dui* trigram. The light of a single day vanishes at the *you* earthly branch, embodying the way of metal’s unyielding slaughter, hence its name: *Vajra*.
4. **Dark Feng (幽酆)**: Transformed from the five *qi* of the northern *Kan* trigram. The *qi* of the season and the number of water culminate at *zi*, where yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir, and water flourishes at *zi*, hence its name: *Bitter Cold*.
5. **Dark Capital (幽都)**: Transformed from the *fan qi* of the northeastern *Gen* trigram. The *qi* of the season arrives at *yin* and *gen*, embodying the principle of gentle warmth and generative bestowal, born of wood’s *qi*, hence its name: *Scalding Waters*.
6. **Dark Governance (幽治)**: Transformed from the *fan qi* of the southeastern *Xun* trigram. Fire reaches its zenith at *si*, where all things blaze with molten brilliance, hence its name: *Bronze Pillars*.
7. **Dark Barrier (幽关)**: Transformed from the *fan qi* of the southwestern *Kun* trigram. Metal’s *qi* brings the stern killing force of the southwest, and as it reaches the gateway of human life, it often gives rise to punitive and destructive intent, hence its name: *Slaughter and Dissection*.
8. **Dark Court (幽府)**: Transformed from the *fan qi* of the northwestern *Qian* trigram, embodying the turning wheel of Heaven, hence its name: *Fire Chariot*.
9. **Dark Prison (幽狱)**: Transformed from the central *qi*, governed by the Earth Sovereign of the central palace, serving as the overarching administration of the center, hence its name: *Universal Torment*.

The establishment of the Nine Prisons is fundamentally for the universal deliverance of the sunken and lost. If conducting a minor rite—without invoking blessings for the sovereign and the realm above, or delivering the nine ancestors and the six paths below, but merely liberating one or two souls—how could the Celestial Emperor issue a special pardon and open all nine prisons for the sake of a single individual? Such a notion defies reason. Though all earthly prisons may be broken and all dark souls delivered, if one’s intent lacks even the slightest merit of benefiting others, it contradicts the very purpose of this ritual. If the aim is solely to offer prayers, lighting lamps and reciting invocations—or performing rites like the *Nine Goblets of Lamps*—suffices. The *Breaking the Prisons* ritual need not be undertaken, lest one risk presumption and disrespect.

Yet, for filial children repaying their parents, sincerity and repentance of sins are enough—how could one assume their ancestors must have fallen into hell and thus perform this rite? Such reasoning is misplaced. If one truly wishes to proceed, one should provide *hulu* offerings to deliver the wandering souls as circumstances allow, building merit according to one’s capacity. Then, the *Breaking the Prisons* ritual may be performed without apprehension. For countless suffering souls, lost in the depths of delusion, a single misguided thought may consign them to these prisons forever. Without beseeching Heaven’s decree, enacting talismans, and breaking the prisons, how could they attain liberation? Thus, the ritual must be conducted according to the prescribed method.

**Returning Radiance Lamp Diagram**

The Master said: The *Alliance of the True* ritual canon contains the *Returning Radiance Descending Light* method, a rite for repentance and deliverance from the Five Accumulations and the Gates of Suffering. A wheel of catalpa wood is fashioned in the likeness of a chariot axle. On its upper tier, twelve lamps are lit; on the middle tier, sixteen; and on the lower tier, twenty-one—with the Five Accumulations and Gates of Suffering at the center, making forty-nine in total. Tablets are erected bearing the names of the various hells. Additionally, forty-nine small banners of yellow and white are made, their colors alternating as they are planted in sequence. First, the *Returning Radiance Banner* must be raised in the southeast of the wheel, aligning inner and outer correspondences, for the *Yellow Register’s* broad deliverance of imprisoned souls. By amassing this merit, one dedicates it to the deceased, enabling the light of the Three Luminaries to bend and illuminate the gates of the Nine Springs. Thus, iron cities melt away, blades and poisons lose their edge, suffering souls are delivered, and all behold the Three Lights, swiftly reborn among humans and devas. This is the original ritual method, long abandoned and unused. It should now follow the models of Cai Zhixu and Lu Shizhong: three concentric enclosures of sand are arranged, square without and round within, resembling a chariot wheel with a diameter of nine feet. The outer ring has twenty-four spokes, with twenty-four lamps lit and twenty-four hell tablets erected. The middle ring has fifteen spokes, with fifteen lamps lit and tablets for the Five Accumulations, Five Paths, and Five Gates of Suffering. The inner ring has nine spokes, with nine lamps lit and tablets for the Three Evil Gates, Three Corpse Paths, and Three Realms of Bondage. At the center, a single *Returning Radiance Spirit Banner* is planted, with one lamp lit. Again, forty-nine small banners of alternating yellow and white are made and arranged beside the lamps. Once the repentance lamps are completed, they are burned atop the lamps. **Chariot Axle Wheel Design**

**Returning Radiance Wheel Lamp**
**Diagram of the Twenty-Four Hells**

The Master said: According to the *Twenty-Four Precepts Scripture of the Perfected*, all who commit twenty-four kinds of transgressions in life shall undergo twenty-four retributions after death, transforming into twenty-four hells. These comprise the Three Ways and Five Sufferings, the realm of Eight Difficulties, and eight hells—together forming twenty-four hells, corresponding to the three divisions, eight luminaries, and twenty-four spirits within the human body. Most arise from worldly attachments to love and desire, harboring perverse intentions, knotting impurities, and failing to attain liberation. Thus, the covenants of the Perfected contain the *Returning Radiance* method, employing the yang-light to illuminate the dark paths, causing hell officials to cease their accusations and imprisoned sufferers to escape their torments.

**Diagram of the Blood Pool Lamp**
The Master said: South of the Great Iron Encirclement Mountain lies the Gorge Stone Hell. Its form is entirely black, flanked by flames, with a blood pool beneath, situated within a vast stone to the southeast. Broad above and tapering below, a fissure opens at its center, through which sinners pass, drenched in a hundred toxic medicinal brews that scour body and heart. This hell is called the Blood Pool, where women who died in childbirth sink for kalpas, their suffering beyond measure, their defilement extreme. Within dwell millions of ghostly soldiers who torment day and night—beings such as the Body-Flipping Great Spirit, the Corpse-Hurling Great Spirit, and the Heart-Eating, Brain-Devouring Ghost Kings.

**Diagram of the Fengdu Lamp**
**Diagram of the Five Paths Unblocking Lamp**

The Master said: When establishing a grand ritual fast, one must first unblock the roads and release the departed souls. The method employs five clay pedestals, each bearing a white banner, arranged according to the five directions. To the east stands the Flying Way Great Spirit; to the south, the Traversing Way Great Spirit; to the west, the Straight Way Great Spirit; to the north, the Obstructing Way Great Spirit; and at the center, the Capital Way Great Spirit.

**Diagram of the Thirty-Two Heavens Lamp**

The Master said: The lamp altar is constructed in three tiers. The upper tier represents the Four Formless Heavens, where the throne of the Formless Realm Demon King is established, and banners of the Ten Directions’ Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings are hung. The middle tier encompasses the Eighteen Heavens, where the throne of the Form Realm Demon King is set. The lower tier honors the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Worthies, where the throne of the Desire Realm Demon King is placed. At the altar’s heart stands a banner inscribed with the Great Demon King of the Three Realms.

The Master said: This diagram follows the primordial unity of the cosmic net’s unfolding. Above hang the banners of the Thirty-Two Heavens; externally, eight gates are opened, and the tablets of the Twenty-Eight Constellations are arrayed around the perimeter.

**Diagram of the Nine Heavens Lamp**

The Master said: The Nine Heavens Lamp is also called the Nine-Cup Lamp. If a lamp tree is not used, it may be laid out upon the ground. According to the *Cavern Scriptures*, the First Heaven resides at the center, directly above; the Second Heaven lies to the south; the Third to the southeast; the Fourth to the west; the Fifth to the northeast; the Sixth to the northwest; the Seventh to the north; the Eighth to the southwest; and the Ninth to the east. Nine qi tablets are also placed according to direction, with the banners of the Nine Heavens suspended above. The arrangement must adhere strictly to this diagram. Those who begin with the First Heaven in the northeast act contrary to principle—this must be carefully examined.

**The Mysterious and Venerable Gate of the Divine Tiger**

The Master said: The supreme Dao of the Numinous Treasure takes as its foremost duty the salvation of the hidden and the suffering in the nether realms. Through the accumulation of merit and the cultivation of conduct, one embodies the boundless compassion of the Primordial Beginning, whose essential aim is the deliverance of all beings.

Among all methods, the Gate of Summoning and Seizing is the most exalted. When the yin-corpses sink into the eternal night of the underworld, never to behold the light of the sun, one must perform the rites of deliverance and practice this great Dharma.

The Primordial Qi of the Origin, the Chaos Red Script, the Jade Tablets, and the Golden Talismans first gather the yin and yang, harmonizing the Four Images. Through the union of the feminine and masculine, Kan and Li, male and female are distinguished. Thus, the pure ascends and the turbid congeals, and the profound principle is awakened and illuminated. Then, with the Qi of the Northern Culmen, the Five Agents are set in motion. Only then may one approach the Mysterious Altar, settle and clarify the root-source, and attain a state of utter detachment. Ascending to the Southern Heaven, one refines the being with the Primordial Qi of the Three Heavens, thereby transforming and completing the person.

The Heavenly One of the Northern Foundation and the Purple Script of the Great One possess the Great Culmen Palace of the Central Dipper, overseen by the Seven Primes of the Dark and Mysterious Lady, also known as the deity presiding over the Mysterious Elixir of the Great One. Her station is exalted among the Nine Heavens, and she oversees all spirits, serving as the chief administrator of the nether bureaus in the great Dharma of summoning and seizing. All living beings in the Nine Earths, all souls and spirits in life and death, are governed by her.

For those in the Lower Realm whose destinies and lifespans are nearing their end, they fall under the jurisdiction of the Dark and Mysterious. Only when the Lady of the Dipper transmits the talismans to the Mountain Mansion may their souls be pursued and retrieved—this is the office of the Death Registry Bureau. Below her, seven Jade Maidens preside over life and death, each managing the records according to the determinations made at birth. All wandering souls and wayward spirits are under their command.

There are two Great Saints of the Divine Tiger, male and female, who govern the souls of kings, nobles, officials, and commoners throughout the world. Each is attended by twelve thousand spirit-officers who carry out their commands. Among them are three Messengers of Soul-Pursuit, who communicate the decrees of the Great One. Bearing the Jade Tablets of the Dark and Mysterious and the Uniting Talismans of the Great One, they ascend to all heavens and descend to the Three Primes, reaching every true office, the bureaus of water and fire, the courts that examine and punish the underworld, and the agencies that pursue and retrieve souls.

This Dao is not revealed to the mediocre. Since its emergence from the Bi-Lu Grotto, only the Perfected Liu obtained the supreme Dao, and Ye Jing attained the middle. Thus, this transmission is proclaimed. It is not to be compared with the great Dao of the Central Dipper’s Great Culmen, which pursues and seizes the souls of spirits—of ten thousand attempts, not one succeeds. Within it lies the method of summoning and commanding through universal seizing, where recitation in seated meditation may bring immediate results.

When practicing the ranks of the Divine Tiger, one must seek the great Dharma with precision, lest the nether realms be misled.

**The Mysterious Standards of the Five Dippers**

The Master said: The Lord of Life-Allotment of the Eastern Dipper is the palace of the Qi of Blue Yang’s generation, governed by the Heavenly Lord of the Nine Qi of the Blue Numinous Primordial Elder.

The Lord of Name-Recording of the Western Dipper is the palace of the White Numinous’ nurturing of simplicity, governed by the White Numinous Primordial Elder.

The Lord of Life-Generation of the Southern Dipper is the Great Abyss Palace of the Vermilion Flame and Cinnabar Numinous, governed by the Cinnabar Numinous Perfected Elder.

The Lord of Death-Falling of the Northern Dipper is the palace of the Dark and Extinguished Center Harmony, governed by the Five Numinous Mysterious Elder.

The Great Culmen of the Central Dipper is the palace that oversees all spirits, governed by the Yellow Numinous August Elder.

The Lord of Life-Allotment of the Eastern Dipper: When a person receives the One Qi and is born, the Five Thearchs oversee the life-monitoring and destiny-determining offices, fixing the allotment and inscribing the register. Greatness becomes longevity, and smallness becomes a lifespan. All people in the world are allotted one hundred and twenty years of life. Three days are counted as one *suan*, and one hundred and twenty *suan* are calculated as one year. One lifespan is one cycle, and twelve years make one thousand two hundred *suan*. If the life-monitoring office determines that one’s merit and virtue are great, a memorial is made to the sovereign to increase the allotment—greatly by three hundred and sixty *suan*, or minimally by one hundred and twenty *suan*. If the life-monitoring office determines that one’s sins and transgressions are full, the allotment is reduced. If the sins remain unexpiated, the allotment is erased, and the years are diminished or the lifespan shortened, each according to its degree, without the slightest discrepancy.

The Lord of Life-Allotment of the Eastern Dipper is overseen by the Star of the Responsible Wolf. The life chapters of men and women, their forms, virtues, and transgressions, are all recorded by the Lord of Name-Recording of the Western Dipper, overseen by the Star of the Giant Gate. The spirits are divided and descend as darkness, determining poverty, wealth, nobility, and lowliness, and transforming life in the Middle Kingdom—all are under the jurisdiction of the Lord of Life-Generation of the Southern Dipper, overseen by the Stars of Wealth and Literary Brilliance. The transgressions and sins of one’s life, the shortening of years and lifespan, and the permanent severance of destiny and fortune, leading to death and the long night, are all governed by the Lord of Death-Falling of the Northern Dipper, overseen by the Star of the Martial Brilliance.

From life to death, from the recording of names to the allotment of lifespans, from generation to falling, all are overseen by the Great Culmen of the Central Dipper, governed by the Star of the Ruinous Army and the Heavenly Manifestation. The Five Thearchs of the Mysterious Offices determine the destinies of the ten directions of the world and the souls of the four births and six destinies.

Thus, the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning established the Palace of the Mysterious Standards, where the Seven Primes Star Lords reside. Each is attended by Divine Tiger generals and officers, along with the Ladies of the Great One, who manage the seals of the Divine Tiger’s soul and spirit. Below them, the Jade Maiden Ladies oversee the registers, administer life and death, and govern the affairs of souls and spirits. If there is any disobedience or negligence, the Ladies of the Great One memorialize the Dipper Palace, which then flies a report to the Jade Emperor. Rewards and punishments are meted out with perfect impartiality, without the slightest partiality.

Those who practice these rites must not be ignorant of these matters.

**The Divine Tiger’s Offices**

The Seven Yin Ladies of the Northern Dipper’s Great One and Dark and Mysterious: the Dark and Mysterious Inner Consort Lady, the Purple Prime Lady of the Great One, the Heavenly One of the Northern Foundation Lady, the Jade Tablet Lady of the Divine Tiger, and the Primordial Divine Tiger Lady.

The Divine Tiger’s Seals
The Master says: For every Divine Tiger jade talisman, there must be a corresponding seal, which must be consecrated before use. A talisman without a seal is like an army without a general; a seal without a talisman is like a general without an army. Without both talisman and seal, the pacing of the stars and the summoning of spirits will lack efficacy. Thus, in the Lingbao rites, perfection is prized, and no one has heard of success when these are violated.

The Seals:
- Northern Dipper Dark and Vast Office Seal
- Male Left Seal
- Female Right Seal
- Divine Tiger Jade Tablet Seal
- Divine Tiger General Seizing Seal
- Great Dipper General Monitoring Seal

All the above seals are detailed in the section on Seal Scripts and Models.

The Rite of Consecrating the Seals
The Method says: Use tea, wine, and seasonal fruits in nine portions, arranged on the ninth auspicious day within a purified chamber, and consecrate them according to the ritual.

The Seal Consecration Incantation:
"Northern Foundation of Heaven’s One,
Purple Prime of the Great One.
Dark and Vast Northern Dipper,
Divine Tiger Dark Elder.
Great Saints of the Dipper,
Jade Maidens who pursue hun.
Ten Directions’ essence and light,
Descend with me in spirit.
With each breath and inhalation,
Enter my seal.
Emerge with the qi,
Move with the qi.
Transforming into millions,
Primal, prosperous, harmonious, steadfast.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Divine Tiger decrees!"

Recite this incantation fourteen times while facing north, then inhale twelve breaths and blow upon the seal. Visualize nine strands of purple-dark qi descending from beneath the Northern Dipper into the seal. Imagine all the generals following the incense smoke, riding the purple-dark qi, and entering the seal. Bow twice and recite the incantation again. Upon completion, pour wine over the seal, cover it with a clean basin, and burn four portions of spirit money atop the seal.

Next, store it in a clean place, encase it in a crimson pouch, and let no one see it—exposure will render it powerless. After twelve years, recarve it anew and submit a petition to replace it. Discard the old seal in a secluded cave or ravine where no one treads.

**Establishing the Yin and Yang Altar Formations**
The Master says: When establishing a grand ritual, select a room at the *gen* (northeast) door, set up the Hall of the Divine Tiger facing south, and arrange tables for the officials and generals with all requisite incense and flowers. Then, within the hall, construct the Yang Radiance Passage Altar on the left and the Yin Spirit Seizing Soul Altar on the right, each three feet and six inches in diameter, leveled and aligned. Place altar placards and the tablets of the Left and Right Wardens of the Underworld Prison. Enclose the entire chamber with white silk curtains to shield it from dust.

First, perform the ritual offering to the Primordial Jade Tablet according to protocol, then establish the altars. Prepare tea, wine, fruit, and fern shoots to sacrifice to the Divine Tiger officials and generals. Follow the prescribed steps: transform the spirit, pace the *wai* (zigzag), and proceed with the sequential summoning and sealing.

Draw upon the earth with a sword. Place the male left seal at the center of the Yang Altar and the female right seal at the center of the Yin Altar. On the central table, keep a single bright lamp burning. Affix the Guiding Youth Talisman and all Divine Tiger talismans. Fill two vessels with water and immerse one Divine Tiger Seizing Soul Talisman in each, placing them beneath the altar placards. Invoke the officials and generals to pursue the soul and manifest at the altar.

Next, take three Manifestation Talismans: burn one with the petition and underworld paper money, submerge one in water, and consume the last yourself. Hold the talisman water in your left hand, grasp the sword in your right, recite the *Tianyi Beizu* incantation seven times, and draw the *qi* of the Ghost Gate into the water. Sprinkle it over both altars, reserving the remainder on the table. Draw the curtains, seal the hall’s door, and forbid entry. Only when the appointed time for summoning arrives should the curtains be opened. Place banners to the left and right of the altars.

Use the Talismans of Manifestation, Dark Release, Communication, and Vision—burn them in water and sprinkle the mixture over the youth’s body. Instruct the youth to point out the signs. After a long while, faint traces may appear. If the bereaved’s devotion is sincere, the spirit’s form will manifest, and words may be exchanged as clearly as with the living. If the living weep in sorrow, the startled soul will flee far away. If the living rejoice, the spirit will fully appear. Beware of anger, for it is forbidden. Do not summon frivolously; no other prohibitions apply.

**Establishing the Eight Gates Summoning Soul Altar Formation**
The Master says: To summon a soul and manifest its form, set up eight gates in the center of the Divine Tiger Hall, with the Summoning Soul Altar positioned eight feet away. Alternatively, establish it in a clean, open space outdoors, spreading fine yellow earth four feet and nine inches wide. Encircle it with eight gates, bound by red silk cords twisted leftward, nine feet or fifteen feet long depending on the space. Use sixteen iron nails, each six inches long, to secure the gates. Place white placards at each gate inscribed with their names and the eight talismans.

Set a clean basin of immortal elixir broth at the altar’s center, immersing the *Tieji Tai Baoguang Zhang* (Iron Trace Terrace Treasure Light Chapter). Bind pure mallow stalks into a human figure, dressing it in the deceased’s former attire. Place the Great Brahma Concealed Script inside, crown it with the Great Ascension to Heaven Certificate, and suspend it from a scale’s hook so the mallow figure hovers three to five inches above the ground.

In advance, prepare a seven-foot-two-inch white silk banner for summoning the soul—one for a male spirit, one for a female, each three feet and six inches long. Attach them to an eight-foot-four-inch bamboo pole. Erect the male banner on the altar’s left (inscribed with *Tieji Tai*) and the female banner on the right (inscribed with *Baoguang Zhang*). Place the central summoning banners as needed.

When the time comes, have a young boy and girl hold the two banners at the ritual master’s sides. Follow the protocol to summon and sacrifice to the officials and generals, then invoke the deceased’s soul. The master, holding the banner in the right hand and forming the Summoning Soul mudra with the left, taps the teeth nine times, whistles three times to the left, and calls three times to the right. Chant the Summoning Soul Incantation and the Yin-Yang Dipper Chapter, then recite the Summoning Soul and Pursuing Soul incantations. Visualize the ritual in progress as the banner covers the mallow figure.

If the yin soul arrives, the banner will grow heavy, bending the bamboo pole until the mallow figure’s scale touches the ground. Then, guide the spirit to bathe, change clothes, face the true, and receive deliverance. If the refinement and deliverance have been long delayed, the deceased may fear the living’s yang *qi* and scatter the yin soul. Use the banner to gather it back to the Summoning Soul Altar, entering through the Gate of Death and closing it behind. Next, take the altar’s water and sprinkle it in all ten directions with a willow branch to fully restore the soul’s form, making its shadow manifest. When guiding the spirit for refinement and deliverance, open the Gate of Life and lead it out to the altar. This method aligns with the Great Yin Refinement and Deliverance protocol.

It is also said: When establishing the Divine Tiger Altar, one must use the *Five Scattered Chapters* to guard the five directions. Place the *Great Floating Li Earth Diagram* of the Supreme Emperor at the center—summoning will then be immediate. Without this text, the divine officials will lack the harmonizing light and cannot arrive. During the ritual, recite the *Three Chapters of the Demon King* and burn the *Red-Written Jade Characters* and *Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts* within the chamber. For the divine officials cannot be summoned without the true script of the Heavenly Primordial *qi* and the Jade Characters of the Celestial Origin. These two chapters are the supreme prohibitions of the Mystic Capital. The Primordial Beginning summons all the Heavenly Emperors and the myriad spirits of the Three Realms using these very chapters. All ten thousand sages, upon seeing this text, behold the jade light and arrive.

In practicing the supreme Dao of the Numinous Treasure, the key lies in refining *qi* and visualizing the spirit. Only when one’s true body aligns with the Primordial Beginning’s wisdom can enlightenment be attained. Without this, one labors in vain and risks divine punishment. Be vigilant.

The *Five Scattered Chapters*, the *Red-Written Jade Characters*, and the *Eight Mighty Dragon Scripts*—all are revealed within the *Gate of Suppression, Exorcism, and Subjugation*. Alongside these appear the *Yang Radiance Passage-Opening Altar Diagram* and the *Yin Spirit Subjugation Altar Diagram*.

The *Yang Radiance Altar* governs the salvation of the deceased, extending to the myriad ancestors—those long transformed and recently departed, all souls and consciousnesses.

The *Yin Spirit Subjugation Altar* governs the salvation of those who died from illness, violent misfortune, self-inflicted harm, or murder; those imprisoned, bound, or long confined in the Dark Bureau; and all souls of the Nine Netherworlds.

The *Eight Gates Summoning Altar*:
When the soul is summoned, open the Ghost Gate at the Human Gate and close it upon entry.

The *Eight Gates Placards and Talismans*:
Human Dao
Buddhist Dao
Immortal Dao
Earth Dao
Karmic Dao
Divine Dao
Ghost Dao
Animal Dao
These talismans are inscribed on yellow paper placards, each one foot and four inches in height. When the deceased touches this talisman, their soul enters the altar, and all present may witness their manifested traces.

The *Iron Trace Terrace Radiant Treasure Chapter*:
The radiance of the sun and moon illuminates the eight directions.

The *Iron Trace Golden Radiance Treasure Terrace Chapter*:
Mighty light blazes forth,
Dispelling yin and restoring yang.
Souls return to the yin,
Spirit *qi* permeates the eternal.
The Eight Gates traverse the netherworld, avoiding death and harm.
Summoned souls cannot conceal themselves.
This talisman is inscribed on a three-inch piece of yellow silk with cinnabar. Steep it in a decoction of *fuling*, *fushen*, *asparagus root*, *ginseng*, and *rehmannia*, each one *fen* in weight, then place it within the basin at the center of the Eight Gates Altar. After the summoning, sprinkle water upon the altar in the ten directions to restore the yellowed form, reviving the complete soul and manifesting its shadow—this is the treasure of ghosts and spirits.

Another method: Inscribe on green or white silk with cinnabar, seven inches in length and two inches and four *fen* in width, to summon the souls of those condemned to the Unrelenting Hell.

The *Two Altar Banners and Talismans*:
*Iron Trace Terrace Treasure Radiance Chapter*
These two talismans are inscribed with realgar and cinnabar on two banners, which are then erected on the left and right of the Eight Gates Altar. For yang persons, use the *Iron Trace* to summon; for yin persons, use the *Treasure Radiance*.

The *Jade Emperor’s Seal*, aligned with the Northern *qi*.

The *Summoning the Deceased Banner: Supreme Unity’s Return to True Form and Subjugation of Souls Talisman*:
Supreme Lady of the Primordial Beginning,
Purple *qi* traverses the celestial ford.
Gather essence and assemble souls—
Let the messengers appear and present themselves.
At the first summons of the true talisman,
Soul and spirit unite.
The *Scintillating Spirit* subdues the *Flying Poison*,
The *Fetal Light* and *Corpse Dog* devour the *Thief*,
The *Stinking Lung* and *Netherworld Essence* expel the *Sparrow Yin* and impurities.

The *Supreme Jade Edict*:
By the talisman’s union, traverse the netherworld.
Let the Subjugating Soul Messengers
Restore the original form,
Bind and restrain Fengdu,
Wind and fire cease not.
Through effortless transformation, the profound merit of the Great Dao is achieved.

The *Incantation*:
The Northern Emperor’s divine elixir,
All immortals pay homage to the sacred countenance.
May the records of Fengdu descend,
Good and evil repaid in cyclic return.
Suddenly, the suffering of hell is opened,
Sinful ghosts depart the Mountain of Knives.
I ask: what karmic deeds were committed,
That they never passed the gates of darkness?
Pity the lost and deluded children,
With no shore to cling to.
Thus, the true talisman’s essentials are expounded,
Proclaimed to save the world.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

This talisman follows the Northern Emperor’s seal, aligned with the Northern *qi*.

The *Great Conductor General’s Summoning Soul Talisman*:
*Terrace Radiance, Scintillating Spirit, Netherworld Essence*,
Support the infant, stabilize the *lan* vessel, refine the pure.
Transform the origin, unite the soul, let the stars fly and the marsh overflow.
Banner’s Apex Talisman:
Heavenly spirit, earthly essence, human hero, ghostly scintillation.
*Scintillating Spirit, Terrace Radiance, Netherworld Essence*,
*Corpse Dog* subdues the *Arrow*, *Sparrow Yin* devours the *Thief*,
*Flying Poison* expels impurities.
The Three *qi* transform and give life,
The Three Hun return to the spirit.
At the third summons, hasten to arrive,
Unbound by the *Scripture of Death*.
Yang descends, yin dissolves, ears and eyes open to clarity.
Deliverance from the Eastern Mountain—
*Origin, Prosperity, Harmony, Integrity.*

The Master says: The summoning soul banner may be made of double-layered white silk, three feet and six inches in length. Inscribe the talisman at the top of the front, and on the banner’s body, write in black seal script the *Supreme Unity’s Return to True Form Talisman*, then overlay it with a red-inked matching talisman, sealed with the *Jade Conductor’s Jade Seal*. Below the talisman, write the name of the deceased. At the feet, record the dates and times of birth and death. Let the Three Hun all attend, the Seven Po accompany; at the hands, write *Banner of the Transcended Spirit*, guiding the way. When the talismans align, the soul’s good thoughts remain unchanged.

On the reverse side, at the top, inscribe the forms of the sun, moon, and Dipper. On the body, write in seal script the *Great Conductor General’s Talisman*. At the hands, inscribe the two sages, their names filled with red. In the center, impress the *Great Conductor General’s Seal*. At the hands, write: *Fetal Light Prolongs Life*, *Scintillating Spirit Enhances Fortune*, *Netherworld Essence Averts Death*, *Corpse Dog*, *Hidden Corpse*, *Sparrow Yin*, *Thief Devourer*, *Flying Poison*, *Expel Impurities*, *Stinking Lung*. On the left hand, write: *Male Left Jade Ministry, Commander of the Three Hun and Hundred Nodes, Master Soul, Great Sage Wang Bo*. On the right hand, write: *Female Right Martial Phoenix Division, Guardian of the Seven Po and Blood Qi, Master Po, Great Sage Qiao*.*

**Divine Tiger Summoning Soul Secret Incantation**

The Yang spirit returns your remnants,
The Yin numen comes to my banner.
By the Northern Dipper’s *Tianpeng* decree,

And attain the ranks of immortals.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the statutes command.

**Divine Tiger Mysterious Range Gate**
**Summoning Generals and Ritual Procedures**

The Master says: For all summoning and dispatching rites, one must first cultivate inner refinement. Only then may one visualize the spirits, clasp the mudras, pace the Dipper, and gather the numina. Whether inscribing jade tablets with talismanic commands, issuing jade decrees, establishing the Yin and Yang altars, or summoning and capturing the souls of the deceased, one must first perform these preparations. Through such adaptability, efficacy may be achieved.

The method states: At the outset of summoning generals, first perform the standard purification of heart, mouth, and body. Next, visualize the body as withered wood. With the left and right hands forming the *Jade Clarity Mudra*, ignite the heart’s fire to blaze fiercely, reducing the wood to ashes. The left hand traces the *Wu* (Fire) trigram, the right the *Zi* (Water) trigram. Cross the hands at the waist, visualizing the true fire within the kidneys rotating like a wheel, merging with the heart’s fire. Invoke the *Xun* (Wind) to blow the ashes away entirely. Strike the teeth twelve times, face the Celestial Gate, and inhale the Primordial Ancestral *Qi* twelve times, holding the breath for a short while.

Visualize the Celestial Gate descending with purple clouds into the crown of the head. Envision the Central Palace emitting yellow and white energies that intertwine and merge with the purple clouds. Imagine oneself as the *Primordial Beginning*, then visualize the *Great One* descending from the void to stand before you, seated upon a nine-headed lion throne. Inhale the *Azure Mystery Qi* from the *Great One’s* crown, uniting it with the *Primordial Beginning’s* *qi*, transforming it into a radiant canopy of a hundred treasures enveloping the body. Visualize the Celestial Gate suffused with purple clouds and azure mists, from which emerge divine officials, tiger-nobles, jade maidens, and talismanic scribes, all bearing staffs and holding talismans.

Then, brush the sleeves and flick the fingers behind the ears and eyes. Complete the visualization, advance, burn incense, and strike the teeth twelve times. Press the tongue to the upper palate, circulate the *Flowery Pond* twice, then guide the lung’s *wu* (void) to pace the *Divine Tiger’s* tracks and the *Spiritual Vigor* of the Dipper, taking thirteen *Ding* steps. Cross the little and ring fingers, press the thumbs together against the middle phalanges of the middle fingers, and recite the *Secret Incantation of the Whistling Mandate for the Spirit Vigor*:

**Incantation:**
*Mysterious Range, Northern Chief,*
*Grasping life and death’s supreme Way,*
*Breath and root flourish my path.*
*Jade Tablet, Golden Tiger script—*
*All spirits heed, none dare disobey.*
*Should any defy my great Dao,*
*You shall be demoted, your Way unfulfilled.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the* Northern Chief Purple Tenuity Lady’s *Song and Statutes command.*

*Golden radiance revolves the seven circuits,*
*The flying divine tiger opens the nether pass.*
*Revolving the celestial constant, treading the mysterious firmament,*
*Returning purity to support the infant and stabilize the virtuous orchid.*

*Ascending brilliance, coiling around the destined web.*
*Harmonizing the seven luminaries into one household,*
*Separation and union naturally bear jade blossoms.*
*Swiftly, swiftly, as the* Central Dipper Great Sage *decrees.*

Visualize the *Divine Tiger* officials and generals riding the purple cloud-*qi* with the incense smoke, entering the seal. After the offering, store it in a crimson pouch. Turn to face north and recite:

**Oṃ kuśa luśi krodha lu [ ] śvaḥ!**

Form the *Left Dipper Seal* at the heart, the *Sword Mudra* at the waist. Visualize the body as the *Azure Mystery Jade Form*, strike the teeth three times, and loudly summon:

*Northern Chief Mysterious Range Prefecture,*
*Burn incense to summon the* Day Duty Merit Clerk—*hasten here!*

Recite the secret incantation, visualize their arrival, and proceed as usual. Once the *Merit Clerk* arrives, present this precious incense to summon the designated general. Then proceed with the invocation.

**Summoning Incantation:**
*Golden Gate’s luminous splendor,*
*Vast White’s seven negations.*
*Geng and Xin’s ancestral qi,*

*Hasten as the command is issued.*
*Divine Tiger’s arrival—*

*Zi-Wu Dipper, Dipper Qi.*

These three incantations are used for all talismanic burnings, general summons, prayers, issuances of jade tablets, and talismanic decrees.

**General Incantation:**
*Mysterious Heaven Jade Tablet,*

**Method of Whistling Mandate**

The method states: The Three Departments’ messengers reside in the *Abyssal Source Palace*, the chief prefecture of the Three Yin, governing the summoning of Yin-*qi*. The *Divine Tiger* dwells at the head of the Three Burners; the Seven Jade Maidens occupy the seven orifices; the *Yang Radiance* and *Yin Spirit* reside beneath the left and right eyes; the Two Sages dwell beneath the nostrils; the *Lucid Hun-Seeking Divine General* resides in the two kidneys; the *Divine Tiger* messengers and others all abide within the *Flowery Pond*. Through the seven revolutions of the numinous root, breath divides the *qi*, dispersing, ascending, and transforming to emerge before the altar.

With the divine officials and tiger messengers of the Dharma Department, merge into a single form, directing them at will—simply guide and summon them by riding the *qi*. Now, the *Whistling Mandate* emits the *qi* of heart and lungs, coalescing into Yin-wind and mysterious mist, flying forth to call the *Divine Tiger*. Thus, the heart perceives and form responds; all divine officials chant and whistle as they arrive.

**Issuing the Jade Tablet Rite**
Summon the generals as before, entering the ritual with three offerings. The text follows the *Purification Rites: Invocation and Prayer* section.

After the three libations, pray thus:
*"All who receive talismans and register records obey the statutes of the Most High. To gather souls and summon spirits, we follow the decrees of the Mysterious Master. May swift steeds and flying chariots hasten the journey of cultivation."*

Hold the *Great Unity Mysterious Prime Jade Tablet* and solemnly proclaim it.

**Proclaim the Jade Tablet**, then the *Pass Edict*,
and recite again the preceding incantations over the Jade Tablet.

**Incantation for Dispatching the Jade Tablet**
*"Great Unity Purple Prime Lord, Heavenly Unity Northern Mandate commands.
Divine Tiger’s halberd flies, the Dipper’s sway unites all.
Where the Jade Tablet reaches, where the Divine Tiger arrives,
the radiance of the ten directions is inhaled in one breath.
Hasten, hasten, as the law decrees!"*

Recite this seven times, then inhale the essence-*qi* of the ten directions and blow it forth.

*"Primal Beginning’s talismanic mandate summons the Mysterious Darkness.
Jade Maidens, Great Sages, Yin-spirits descend in power.
The Three *Hun* hasten here, the Seven *Po* do not tarry.
Yin-*qi* steals forth in silence, Yang-*qi* speeds its course.
The Three Offices and Northern Fengdu inspect the ghostly camps.
Transcend the Three Realms, roam freely in the Highest Clarity.
Hasten, hasten, as the Primal Lord of Heaven commands!"*

For the central text, with Northern *qi* and holding the Jade Tablet to dispatch the generals, proclaim loudly:

*"Hear now, Divine Tiger Great Sage, Jade Maidens of the Seven Bureaus, Messengers of the Three Departments, and Spirit Officials of the Soul-Gathering Ministry—attend to my words!
By imperial appointment, I hold the seal and insignia, embodying the Most High to aid transformation and deliver humanity, commanding the Divine Tiger to pursue souls and gather spirits.
Today, I follow the secret canon of the Golden Casket and issue the hidden writ of the Jade Tablet. My orders must be executed without delay.
Your numinous transformations are swift—hence, I rely on your aid to transmit them.
May you swiftly harness your chariots to float through the void, traversing heaven and earth, upholding the commands of the Supreme Mystery, and reaching every divine realm in the boundless expanse.
Verify names and pursue wandering souls, regardless of distance or depth, without obstruction or detention.
Let not a moment pass before they arrive in hesitation, manifesting clearly to awaken the deluded.
Guide them all to the purification altar, that they may personally receive the sagely grace.
I humbly await your luminous response—do not delay.
The Mysterious Edict is resplendent; the fiery decree is swift!"*

Step to the right into the Dipper’s mouth, facing southeast. Recite the incantation of the Supreme Unity’s Purple Prime Lady seven times, draw in the qi of the southeast, take it into the water, wield the sword, sip the water, and spray it forth.

Erect the yin and yang altars and perform the summoning ritual for the generals as before. Visualize the invocation of the sages, then proclaim in a loud voice:

The generals have arrived—hear my earnest prayer.
I, though unworthy, hold office in this great teaching, undeserving of my station.
The immortal ranks are entrusted with the authority of refining at Southern Prosperity, while the Northern Chief oversees the bureau of pursuit and capture.
The duties I bear must first be made clear in this proclamation.
Yesterday, so-and-so submitted a petition, and now, as the fast approaches its appointed time, the Mysterious Net is about to be raised.
I have repeatedly presented my memorials, seeking to bring prosperity to the hidden and submerged.
Thus, I establish the yang-altar to illuminate the yin spirits and summon the hosts of male souls and female souls.
Now, in accordance with the Mysterious Regulations, I recite the admonitions and invite the divine chariots to descend.

Relying solely on divine might, I command the pursuit and capture.
May you faithfully carry out the entrusted charge and greatly revive the ancestral teachings.
Pause briefly in your radiant presence to partake of this humble offering.

Next, perform the three-fold presentation as prescribed in the *Rituals of Fasting and Invocation*. Recite the scriptures and proclaim the petitions.

Then, with the left hand form the Six Sovereigns Mudra and with the right the Jade Purity Mudra. Using the middle finger, trace upon the earth according to the altar’s design.

**Tracing the Yang-Illuminating Altar, recite the Yang Dipper Chapter:**
The Five Phases create—then return to the Five Phases.
Three fingers descend—four great elements provisionally unite, yet revert to the Great Void.
Be it yin or yang, they follow the root and origin of heaven and earth.
When the four centers of heaven and earth darken, myriad ghosts lie hidden.
When the four above heaven and earth stir, myriad ghosts are scattered.
At the center, yin and yang revolve—spirits and ghosts prosper.
With the two below, summon these wandering souls to my altar.
With the two within, bestow upon them the sacred writ to return to the Supreme Clarity.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the decree of the Supreme Unity’s Dark and Mysterious Law commands.

At noon, exit the center. Upon completing the tracing, draw the qi of the Ghost Gate and blow it forth nine times, then flick the mudra.

**Tracing the Yin-Spirit Altar, recite the Yin Dipper Chapter:**
Yin and yang shift and turn—kalpas change and pass.
Within the Five Fingers, life and death cycle—who is wise, who is foolish?
Departing and returning, endless—such is the creation of the Supreme Mystery.
Those who have not escaped the Three Realms are bound by divine transformation.
At *yin*, the Eastern Dipper turns; at *you*, the Western Dipper revolves.
At *mao*, face south; at *zi*, proceed north.
At *wu*, yin spirits are vast and obscure; at *zi*, yang souls drift aimlessly.
When heaven and earth darken, myriad ghosts lie hidden.
Follow to *yin*—when heaven and earth stir, myriad ghosts are scattered.
Follow to *si*—yin and yang revolve, spirits and ghosts prosper.
Follow to the center—the Supreme Unity summons—why delay?
From *chen*, whether first or last, the law is constant.
Follow to *hai*—the Celestial One of the North blesses the Divine Tiger’s decree.
At *mao*, the Supreme Unity’s Purple Mystery manifests souls and spirits.
Summoned by this, the wandering hasten to my altar.
The Earth bestows upon you the sacred writ to return to the Supreme Clarity.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the Divine Tiger Lady of the Supreme Unity’s Dark and Mysterious Law commands, lead them upward and depart.

Upon completion, draw the qi of the Ghost Gate and blow it forth nine times, then flick the mudra. Next, wield the sword and face the two altars, reciting the incantation:

Yang illuminates and returns the soul—defying the scriptures of death.
Yin essence captures the spirit—restoring the corpse to transcend calamity.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the law commands.

**Incantation for Capturing Soul and Spirit to Proceed Together to the Altar and Manifest Traces:**
The light of the womb remains undimmed; the luminous spirit encamps the soul.
The hidden essence revives; the corpse-dog departs with treachery.
The crouching corpse is purged of evil; the sparrow’s yin is without blemish.
Swallowing the thief opens clarity; the venomous masses are unobstructed.
Purify filth without interference; close the foul lungs.
The yang soul returns to its origin—heaven and earth’s true qi gathers your form.
This is the Five Phases’ creation and true essence.
The myriad spirits of the five viscera forever preserve peace.
Yang soul and yin spirit, enter the form without exception.
With each breath, hasten to transform into truth.
At the first stroke of the sacred talisman, the altar manifests the soul’s presence.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the Divine Tiger Law of the Supreme Unity’s Dark and Mysterious commands.

**General Incantation for Summoning the Sinful Souls of Hell:**
The Three Treasures Lords of the Yellow and Old,
The purple clouds’ qi of the Upper Heaven—
Capture and restrain the souls of the Nine Dark Realms,
Boundless is the Great Mystery.
All become natural beings; hell holds no confinement.
Open the Gate of Radiant Light—awaken to the true Dao and unite.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the law commands.

**The Divine Tiger’s Seven Perfected Inner Scripture:**
The Jade Perfected’s Myriad Flowers Palace,
Where the High Immortals conceal the Emperor’s scriptures.
It governs the chart of the Nine Heavens’ surface,
Penetrating the observation of the Primal Honored One within.
Seven revolutions summon the myriad spirits;
The Five Peaks vow to come and welcome.
The Azure Dragon guards to the left;
The Vermilion Bird seizes the Dark and Obscure.
The Three Palaces summon the Demon Kings;
The Registrar examines their presentations.
The White Tiger assists to the left;
The Dark Warrior unravels entanglements.
Deliver from the depths of the Yellow Springs;
Record in the immortal books of the Supreme Clarity.
Release all enmities and dissolve grievances;
No ancient grudges remain unresolved.
Seven generations’ karmic knots are untied;
Lost essence and blood are restored.
Return to the Crimson Fire Chamber of the womb,
Reborn within the Grotto’s midst.
A hundred scribes guard the divine precincts,
Commanding the omens to preserve the Yellow Tranquility.
*Hasten! Hasten!* As the law commands.

This scripture, when recited in audience and devotion, dissolves completed karmic bonds, separates the departed, and guides men and women to rebirth.
Recite it seven times, alternately tracing the yin and yang Dippers.

**Ritual for Summoning Souls to the Altar:**
After tracing the altar as before, burn the Divine Tiger talismans—or employ other methods as needed—all to be applied here.
Command the officials and generals to swiftly capture and assemble the departed souls and hidden spirits, summoning them to the altar to manifest their traces.

**Summoning Incantation:**
The yang spirit returns with the wind’s birth;
The yin soul follows my banner.
Soul and spirit, heed the talisman’s call—
Hasten swiftly to the altar of the numinous banner!
The yang spirit returns to your remnant;
The yin soul comes to my banner.
The Northern Dipper’s Heavenly Vanguard decrees;
The Dark Warrior opens the gates of the hidden.
Let the three souls not scatter;
Let the seven spirits not waste away.
By the power of this golden talisman,
Capture you and bring you to the altar of the numinous banner!
May you receive the supreme Dao
And ascend to the ranks of immortals.

**Yang Hymn:**
The Five Phases create—then return to the Five Phases.
(See the tracing of the Yang-Illuminating Altar.)

**Secret Incantation:**
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng,
Inspecting the ghostly encampments—
No concealment is permitted.
The Golden Horse’s courier route proclaims boundlessly;
The myriad spirits all listen.
The Three Realms and Five Emperors,
Declare to the Supreme Clarity.

**Swiftly, swiftly—by the divine tiger’s law and command!**

**Yin Hymn:**
Yin and Yang revolve their courses;
The kalpas shift and change.
(See the tracing of the Yin-Spirit Altar.)

**Secret Incantation:**
By the Primordial One’s talismanic decree,
The hours and moments ascend and transform.
Let the dead souls receive refinement,
Transmuted into immortals, made human again.
No concealment is permitted—
The Golden Horse’s courier route proclaims boundlessly.
Surpass the Three Realms,
And roam freely in the Supreme Clarity.
**Swiftly, swiftly—by the divine tiger’s law and command!**

**General Invocation:**
Having ascended to the profound mysteries of the Supreme Dao,
We establish the Divine Tiger’s Numinous Bureau.
Having dispersed the writ among the divine perfected,
And issued the jade decrees for all to follow,
We humbly beseech the Great Sage Envoys,
The Jade Maidens, the officials and soldiers,
The divine troops of the Dharma departments,
And all the officers and generals of the various bureaus—
To proceed directly to the realms of the living and the courts of the dead,
To traverse freely the yin domains and yang palaces,
To thoroughly inspect the offices of measurement, restraint, and registration,
And to extend the governance of water, fire, wind, and blade.
Search out the roots and trace the bonds of the departed souls,
Pursue and gather the hidden spirits destined for reunion.
In the space between a breath and a blink,
Let them all manifest within the two altars.
We further command the Wardens of the Prisons,
The Gatherer-Souls Merit Officers,
To assemble and marshal them in good order,
Lest they clamor or fall into disorder.
If they bear grievances or debts,
Let these be resolved according to the matter at hand.
May they turn their thoughts and change their hearts,
Avoiding future entanglements in karmic opposition.
Thus may they approach the altar to receive deliverance,
Attain fruition, and ascend in rank—
Truly relying on the merit of your aid,
And together propagating the teachings of the Mysterious Origin.
Receive our earnest invocation,
And act in strict compliance.
Let no delay or disobedience
Hinder the work of liberation.
When the task is accomplished,
You shall be rewarded and honored as the law prescribes.
**Hasten, hasten!**

**Threefold Summons of the Departed Souls:**
According to the ritual, set up the banner and all talismanic decrees,
Seal the doors of the Divine Tiger’s Hall,
And each day burn and recite the talismans and proclamations,
Urging the pursuit of the souls until all have arrived at the altar and manifested.
Further instruct them to appear in dreams or through signs,
Making the auspicious response clear.
On the day the altar is opened, unseal the doors,
And within the hall, perform the summons anew,
Following the previous ritual sequence.

---

**The Primordial Jade Decree**
The Master says: The *Primordial Jade Decree* is the sacred covenant of the Jade Clarity’s Divine Tiger,
The esoteric mandate of the Three Sovereigns for summoning spirits,
A writ personally bestowed by the Primordial One,
Containing the Dao of reviving the dead and delivering humanity.
After the transmission of the *Flying Mystery* by the Lord of the Three Heavens’ Great Mystery Capital,
The divine text was left in the Bi-Lu Grotto of Mount Longhu.
During the Tang dynasty, the Heavenly Master Ye Jingneng
Was instructed by the Primordial Lady of the Great One, who said:
*“In the northern vault of the Mysterious Range at Longhu,
Seek the Western Bi-Lu.
By obtaining it, you shall summon souls and spirits to ascend to the High Clarity,
And your divine merit may serve as the teacher of emperors.”*
Later, Ye Jingneng followed the inscription and found it.
Moreover, the Perfected Lord Liu Gen,
The immortal Sun Deng,
And the Heavenly Master Liu Gang
All encountered it.
For those who practice this art:
Without the Jade Decree, the souls of the departed cannot be gathered,
And their deliverance will be difficult to accomplish.
This is like accepting wealth from a net of sins,
And sowing calamity in a field of blessings.
When submitting a petition to the courts of the underworld,
Use white silk three feet six inches long,
Or seven feet high by one foot two inches wide.
Back it with white paper,
Write the Jade Decree and proclamation in cinnabar on the front,
And the petition in ink on the reverse.
Also inscribe in ink the proper name of the deceased,
Their cause of death,
And their dates of birth and passing,
Aligning them beneath the star talisman corresponding to their life destiny.
For mass deliverances with many names,
Add the character “et al.” beneath the primary name,
While the rest are recorded in the ledger,
Attached to the front of the decree.
Seal it with the *Jade Chief Controller of the Great Emperor of the Vast Return of Brightness*.
Use blue paper for the inner and outer envelopes,
Inscribing them in cinnabar.
It is also said:
Seal it with the *General Inspector of Ghosts and Spirits* seal,
And adorn it with painted images of the Three Envoys.
Send it forth with the official dispatch,
Burning it amidst the blue smoke.
For rituals other than the universal deliverance of the Mysterious Altar,
Do not use it recklessly.
Otherwise, the Earth Bureau will immediately report to the Three Officials,
Swiftly petitioning the Supreme Mystery,
And you will be stripped of rank and penalized in merit—
This may be expected at once.

**Method:**
When inscribing, face east and set up the altar for the Lady of the Dark Mystery.
With the left hand, form the Divine Tiger mudra:
Press down the second and third fingers with the thumb,
Then grasp the second joint of the little finger with the thumb.
Knock the teeth nine times,
Summon the generals as before,
Draw the qi from the northwest into the brush,
And write.

**Yang-Day Jade Decree (Scattered Form):**
*By order of the Northern Chief Lord, I urgently summon the Six Jia Spirits.
The Mighty Left Pursuer of Souls, Commander of the Hundred Nodes,
Holding the Jade Decree, governs the karmic nature of the netherworld.
True essence descends with a single qi—good and evil are all made clear.
The Star Prime serves as the ghostly law—all spirits listen in reverence.
Regardless of guilt or innocence, kinship or estrangement,
The Black Law Lady captures souls and returns them to infancy.
Capture the souls and bring them to the altar—
Lord Bo, swiftly enact the numinous!

Then write in ink their dates of birth, death, month, day, and hour,
Or their burial or cremation details, in two columns.

**Yin-Day Jade Decree (Scattered Form):**
*By the karmic authority of the Mysterious Lady, I summon the Six Ding Spirits.
The Martial Right Phoenix Officer, the Reversed Life Controller of the Dark Bureau,
Obeying the Jade Decree, governs the karmic nature of the yin barrier.
The Heavenly One of the Northern Blessing—qi divides the paths of life and death clearly.
How dare the Three Realms defy? The Ten Directions all welcome.
Even eons of enmity and vengeance—upon the talisman’s arrival, all cease.
Listen, all spirits of myriad deaths—return to your roots!
Capture the souls and bring them to the altar—
The chief officer swiftly responds to the numinous!
[Gap] receive the altar’s command—act with utmost urgency!
Swiftly capture!*
*Support the infant, stabilize the destiny—
One character, one stroke.*

**Yin-Day Seven Stars’ Corresponding Talismans:**

Within the Three Realms and Nine Provinces, summon the departed spirit—
[Name] of the present offering, hasten, hasten!
By imperial decree, execute without delay.
Let no negligence occur.
Divine Tiger Officers—urgently bear the talisman and proclaim below to the presiding authorities.

**Full Form of the Jade Edict**
*Northern Dipper, Great Unity, Dark Mystery, Divine Tiger, Primordial Jade Edict.*

Inscribe the Jade Edict in seal script:
*"Heavenly Unity, Northern Blessing, Great Unity of Purple Origin, Northern Chief, Dark Model, Primordial Jade Edict—*
Proclaim below to the Three Realms and Ten Directions:
Heavenly Courts, Earthly Prisons, Mountains and Seas, Springs and Nether Passes,
Northern Capital of Luo Deng, Six Caves and Ten Palaces, Three Origins and Nine Bureaus,
One Hundred Twenty Offices, the Lands of Yu Jue, the Boundaries of Dark Yin,
All Great Hells, the Nine Provinces’ domains,
City Gods and Earth Deities, Village Boundaries and Wastelands,
Yellow Springs and Mugwort Hamlets, all who govern souls and spirits—
Wherever [the deceased] may pertain or belong—
Pursue and seize the aforementioned departed, [Name] et al.,
Depart swiftly from your jurisdiction, hasten to the Mysterious Altar,
Pay homage to the Supreme Emperor, and receive extraordinary grace."

Divine Tigers, execute the command—
All spirits, heed with reverence.
As the proclamation decrees, transmit by wind and fire courier.

Proclaimed on the [Day] of the [Month], [Year] of the Great Year, at [Hour].

Your subordinate [Name], with solemn reverence, respectfully seals anew:
*The Primordial Jade Edict of the Most High, Iron Charter for Summoning Souls.*

The Master instructs:
"For those who wish to universally deliver the violently deceased, the Iron Charter for Summoning Souls must be employed to gather them.
Within the Charter, *Fuying Zhaopan Landingshu* is the yin-name of the Seven Original True Lords; *Huayuan Yubai Xingfeize* is the inner taboo of the Lady of the Dipper.
Thus, the essence of the Northern Dipper revolves yin and yang, assembling their hun and po to restore the semblance of form and shadow—only then may they be gathered.
For the violently deceased, yin-qi entangles in confusion, the heart-spirit inverts in error, and the true origin is lost in delusion.
After sudden death, the yang-hun dissipates entirely, yin-qi obstructs the barrier, light remains unseen, the hun departs, and the po scatters.
Therefore, the Most High, in boundless compassion, established this Charter to gather them—this is called the *Numinous Treasure’s Limitless Deliverance of Humanity.*"

**Method of Use:**
Inscribe with realgar and cinnabar, writing the deceased’s name, dates of birth and death, and place of burial or cremation beneath their corresponding star.
For mass deliverance with many names, record them beneath the Jade Edict, omitting dates if unknown—but details must still be meticulously declared.
This is dispatched alongside the *Faith-Offering Silk, the Talisman, and the True Forms of the Three Envoys of the Jade Edict*, all to be burned together.

**Dispersed Form of the Iron Charter:**
*Boundless Canopy Upholds, Divine Tassels Self-Official, Soaring Life Self-Ascendant, Karma Beholds the Basin’s Foundation, Emerald Script Nine Orchids, Babbling Faults Resolved, Vast and Unfathomable, Azure Heavens Floating Li, Form Gathers the Supreme Mystery, Overseer of Highest Heaven, Evil Vanquished Without Rank, Radiant Luxuriance in Desolate Peaks, Flying Celestial Great Ugliness, Delivering the Dark and Silent—*

Then, inscribe one talisman below each half-figure in cinnabar, dispatching them together with the Jade Slip.

These seven talismans are inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, with the *Shangdi* hand seal and *qi* of the Heavenly Gate.
For any departed, even without knowing their birth or death year, month, day, or hour, these talismans may be used to pursue and seize them.
There is none who will not be known; it is essential that both yin and yang paths proceed together.

**Jade Maidens’ Yang Talismans**
When inscribing, first recite the Divine Tiger’s inner incantation, then write.

**First Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Second Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Third Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Fourth Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Fifth Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Sixth Jade Maiden Talisman**
**Seventh Jade Maiden Talisman**

These seven talismans are two *cun* and four *fen* in length, one *cun* and four *fen* in width, inscribed in cinnabar, with the *Shangdi* hand seal and *qi* of the Heavenly Gate.

Before the establishment of the purification fast, the ritual master shall each day at dawn face east to inscribe the talismans, forming the Seven Perfected Hand Seals. One talisman is to be ingested daily, following the sequence from the first to the seventh. They are to be taken with a decoction of *fuling* (Poria cocos) and cinnabar. For all summoning and recalling rituals, these talismans serve as the initial step.

**Summons of the Fifteen Envoys and the Seven Jade Maidens’ Talismanic Edict**
*Primordial qi, swiftly open the Earthly Prisons’ heavy bonds to rescue and deliver the departed souls of [Name] and others. By command of this talisman, all sins and transgressions—whether grave or minor—are to be expunged. Release them at once to appear before this altar. By imperial decree, hasten!*

*Year [Tai Sui]  Month  Day  Hour*
*Proclamation issued.*

**Ritual Rank**

If the departed soul fails to appear when summoned by talisman, it is often due to the weight of their karmic offenses and the severity of their sins, resulting in their imprisonment by the nether courts. The master must then ascend in spirit to petition the Celestial Emperor, presenting memorials and supplications to implore special mercy. Only then may the talismanic edict be employed to summon them. Internally, the master must recite the Cavernous Scriptures and perform the *Way of Total Dissolution of Heavy Yin*, causing the prisons of Fengdu to shatter, the boiling cauldrons to cease, and the freezing halls to suspend their torments. Thus, the suffering souls may be liberated and receive the merit of the fast. The *Way of the Divine Tiger* is thereby fulfilled.

**Supreme Clarity Numinous Treasure Great Rites, Scroll Thirty-Nine.**

**The Cavernous Subtlety Illustrious Master, Radiance-Initiating Salvation-from-Suffering Perfected Person Xiao Quanzhen,**
**Transmitted to the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns Disciple, Numinous Treasure Lineage Master Wang Qizhen,**
**Compiled for the Ritual Fasts, Talismanic Scripts, and Methods of Practice**

**The Master Instructs:**
For all talismanic scripture and matching talismanic commands, one must enter the oratory in accordance with the method, engage in visualization, and arrange within the chamber the Three Realms’ Imperial Masters, the Heavenly Perfected Sovereigns, the Yellow Register True Governors, and the talismanic green-script’s numinous officials. Prepare incense, flowers, a ritual table, brushes, inkstones, cinnabar, and ink—all requisites must be complete. First perform the inner refinement method.

---

**The Cavernous Yang Inner Refinement: Flying Spirit of the Eight Effulgences**
**Method:**
At the hour of the six yang, enter the chamber, sit upright, knock the teeth three times, hold the breath, and settle into stillness. Visualize the fire in the lower cinnabar field as the size of a pellet. Revolve it nine times to the left, ascending to the Crimson Palace, then gradually rise through the Twelve-Storied Tower to sit centered in the Mud-Pill Palace. Hold the sun in the left hand and the moon in the right, and intone the title: *Great Cavern Supreme Unity August Emperor*.

**Incantation:**
*May the spirit-soul be serene and upright,*
*May the myriad qi eternally abide.*
*Unmarred by vexations,*
*The body radiates light.*
*Guarded by the Three Realms,*
*Welcomed by the Five Emperors.*
*Myriad spirits pay homage,*
*My name inscribed in Supreme Clarity.*
*When merit is complete,*
*Ascend to Supreme Clarity in flight.*

Recite the incantation three times, then draw in the fire and swallow it three times.

**Further Incantation:**
*Refine the form with golden liquor,*
*Unite with the Dao in truth.*
*Illumine the Three Effulgences,*
*This is called the Heavenly Root.*
*No darkness, no limit,*
*No beginning, no end.*
*The Primal August Nine Shameful Ones,*
*The spirit-soul in the Crimson Palace.*
*Purple clouds take flight to heaven,*
*The body rides the six dragons.*
*Water above, fire below,*
*Flowing into the Three Palaces.*
*The spirit returns to Yang Brightness,*
*The Great Dao naturally opens.*

Recite the incantation three times, swallow saliva three times, and after a long while, a circular image will appear at the nape, its light illuminating the ten directions.

The *Supreme Mystery Primordial Most High Dao Lord* shall manifest the three qi’s true spirits from within the adept’s body: the Lords of Life, Records, Merit, and Execution, along with the Lords Taokang and Jingyan.

The adept now refines the true primordial, its light illuminating the Nine Heavens, sweeping away the yang essence, and penetrating the Nine Gates. This enables the dead souls to undergo refinement, return to the womb, and be reborn. For self-refinement, modify the phrase to: *Form and spirit both wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.* Draw in the fire qi and swallow it nine times.

For all talismanic writing, perform this method repeatedly over time, and the spirit-light will naturally appear.

---

**Talismanic Writing Formula**
**Method:**
For all talismanic writing, set up an incense table, face the Heavenly Gate, and arrange the requisite ritual implements before you. Visualize the cinnabar inkstone and water vessel as the sun and moon, the paper as a golden tablet, the brush as the Azure Dragon, the incense smoke as white clouds, and the talismanic scribe above them. The talismanic method’s Central Palace General and the Divine Maiden are arrayed to the left and right.

Once done, form the Dipper Mudra with the hands, visualize the Five Dippers coiling around the body, and pace the *Huoluo Dipper*. Insert the *Emperor’s Finger Seal*, visualize the body entering the Northern Dipper of the Three Terraces, and with both hands, trace the Dipper. Hold the ritual tablet upright, bow three times, and offer incense. Knock the teeth, kneel, and memorialize:

*Your subordinate, [Name], humbly burns incense and memorializes the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Golden Watchtower’s Seven Treasures Most Honored, the Eastern Ultimate Compassionate Father, the Sound-Responding and Response-Attending Supreme Unity Salvation-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthy, the Ten Directions’ Salvation-from-Suffering Heavenly Worthies, the Nine Dark Realms’ Deliverance-from-Sin Heavenly Worthy, the Nine Heavens’ Life-Engendering Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Imperial Lords, the Five Directions’ Five Elders’ Imperial Lords, the Sun Palace and Moon Mansion’s Two Luminaries’ Imperial Lords, the Southern Dipper’s Six Offices’ Star Lords of Pottery-Spirits, the Northern Dipper’s Seven Primes’ Star Lords of Casting-Souls, the Three Primes’ Three Grades’ Three Officials’ Great Emperors, the Numinous Treasure Initiation’s Five Masters’ Perfected Lords, the Heavenly Perfected Star Persons, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected Persons, the Southern Prosperity’s Upper and Lower Palace Masters of Refining the True Governors, and the Three Registers’ Court’s subordinate officials and all true governors within the received scriptures of the ritual methods.*

*I humbly beseech the Dao’s compassion to deign to peer down and discern. Your subordinate is a lowly ant, a humble blade of grass. By former good affinity, I have presumptuously practiced the Great Teaching. Deeply hoping to succor beings, I aspire to establish minor merit. Having received the petition, how could I dare to suppress or reject it? Your subordinate now memorializes on behalf of the fast’s sponsor, [Name], who has submitted a petition with sincere intent. Today, I reverently prepare the oratory, respectfully follow the Numinous Treasure fast’s methods, and write talismans, registers, and proclamations to await the appointed time, applying them according to the prescribed format. I reflect that your subordinate is foolish, ignorant, and defiled, having failed to reach the Mystery Primordial. I implore Heaven’s grace to deign to bestow compassion and pity.*

May the Great Dao bestow the wondrous radiance of the Ten Directions’ Orthodox Black, flowing into my body’s pores and heart’s orifices, into the vermilion and ink implements, so that knots may be untied, the womb-root purified, and through concentrated mindfulness, resonance achieved—true light emitted. With each stroke and each pore, may I unite with the Dao and the True. In all undertakings, may auspicious responses manifest, perfectly aligning with the mysteries of the Supreme Mystery and fulfilling the complete merit of salvation.

I, presumptuously daring the might of Heaven, await your command with utmost reverence and urgency.

Upon concluding the invocation, I visualize the Most High enthroned within the Heavenly Treasure Terrace, the true ranks arrayed in solemn order, as the Emperor commands the attending perfected to descend, bearing talismans and registers.

Then I behold the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, emitting great luminosity, descending through the void. Youths and maidens, bearing jeweled caskets within a radiance of a hundred treasures, approach the altar before me. The casket is opened, revealing a matching talisman, which merges with the one I have inscribed—its brilliance dazzling the eyes. My form transforms into the Left and Right Perfected of the Azure Mystery, attended by maidens.

Facing east within the oratory, I click my teeth thirty-two times, ascending through the thirty-two heavens, and bow in my heart thirty-two times. Closing my eyes in tranquil contemplation, I envision myself seated upon a cloud of azure, yellow, and white, the inner and outer enveloped in mist. Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, and Dark Warrior array themselves in the four quarters, while sun and moon illumine the chamber. Above my head arises a nine-colored orb, its light suffusing the ten directions.

Next, I invoke:
*"Most High Primordial, Supreme Dao Lord, summon forth from within my body the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attending Envoys, the Jade Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, the Direct Officers of the Day, and the Fragrant Palace Attendants—thirty-two each—to convey my words. On this auspicious day, I reverently establish a grand fast for [Name], to deliver [Name]. Inscribing talismans and registers, I rescue and deliver the souls of the departed. May my supplication ascend directly to the august presence of the Most High, the Primordial Celestial Venerable of the Thirty-Two Heavens."*

Then I draw qi thirty-two times and take my seat to inscribe the talisman.

**Talisman-Sanctioning Incantation**
Vast and boundless, the primordial darkness,
Red brilliance unfurls the chart, the course of nature.
The Primordial stabilizes and settles, unfolding the Five Scriptures.
Vermilion writings on jade, the Eight Might’s dragon scripts,
Preserve and govern the kalpas, ensuring Heaven’s eternal endurance.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Primordial’s boundless salvation decree!*

Exhale the qi of Jade Clarity once, then the qi of the southeast once, and the flourishing qi once. Recite the conjunction of the Radiant Heavenly Thearch and the Sun, and tap the brush three times.

The Eight Effulgences merge in darkness, qi enters the Mystery of Mysteries.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the Primordial’s boundless salvation decree!*

For this method, press the zi and chou positions in sequence to hai, then into the root of the middle finger, forming the mudra at the chou position.

**Jade Clarity Great Incantation**
Thirty-two heavens, thirty-two emperors,
The hidden names of the heavens, the hidden sounds of the heavens.
The empty void within Heaven, the natural numinous scripture,
The hidden rhythms of the heavens, the sounds within Heaven,
The venerables within Heaven, the spirits within Heaven,
The great demons within Heaven, the numina within Heaven.
Nine harmonies, ten unions—transforming into the Supreme Clarity.
The profound mysteries of the boundless, too deep to fathom.
The perfected and divine unfold, universally delivering heaven and humanity.
Today, joyously receiving deliverance, passing through the barriers of the heavens,
I beseech the eradication of the Three Evils, the severing of the earthly root,
And the flight through the Five Gates.
Names recorded in the Great Mystery, demon kings oversee the ascent,
Unrestrained at the gates of Heaven.
The Eastern Dipper governs destiny, the Western Dipper records names,
The Northern Dipper decrees death, the Southern Dipper bestows life,
The Central Dipper, the Great Chief, oversees all spirits.
The Azure Thearch guards the hun, the White Thearch attends the po,
The Vermilion Thearch nurtures qi, the Black Thearch circulates blood,
The Yellow Thearch presides at the center—none among the myriad spirits transgress.
The Azure Heaven Demon King, Bayuan Choubo.
The Vermilion Heaven Demon King, Fu Tian Dan Shi.
The White Heaven Demon King, Fan Shan Liu Mu.
The Black Heaven Demon King, Jian Chou Lang Fu.
The Yellow Heaven Demon King, Heng Tian Dan Li.
The Five Thearchs’ Great Demons, the ancestors of all spirits,
Soaring and drumming in procession, commanding ghostly legions.
With a single flourish of the banner and drum, they roam the great void,
Self-styled as the Illustrious and Victorious, their merit equaling the heavens.
Delivering humanity above, sternly governing the Northern Deng,
Divine merit receives the mandate, universally sweeping away inauspiciousness.
The Eight Might spew poison, fierce steeds charge on four sides,
Heavenly Ding advance as vanguard, great marshals wield banners,
Hurling fire for ten thousand leagues, the Eight Directions’ bells resound.
Dare any test or obstruct the perfected above?
Gold and iron strike first, the great Queen of Heaven executes punishment,
Slaughtering and dissecting ghostly shades—wind and fire never cease.
Severing heads by the thousands, shearing forms by the myriads,
Demons dare not transgress, ghosts dare not haunt.
The Three Officials of the Northern Feng inspect the ghostly camps,
Permitting no concealment, the golden horse relays the decree.
Universally creating the lifeless, all spirits heed,
The Three Realms and Five Thearchs, their words ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

For this method, use the northwest qi. All talismans are to be sanctioned with this.

**Deliverance and Seal-Sanctioning Incantation**
Swiftly erase the ledgers of sin, extinguish the roots of evil.
No restraint or coercion by ghostly throngs.
By the Primordial’s talismanic command, ascend as immortals at this very moment.

**Deliverance of Souls and Seal-Sanctioning Incantation**
Countless generations of ancestors, suffering shades of the netherworld,
All receive deliverance, ascending to the Vermilion Palace.

In general, when inscribing petitions, use esoteric language. Seal petitions with the four lines of the *Spreading Perfected and Divine*. For deliverance petitions, use the Yellow Register; for petitions severing death and bestowing life, use the White Petition.

**General Talisman Dispatch Incantation**
Universally proclaim to the Three Realms, the boundless divine lands,
The Yellow Springs’ courts, the Northern Capital of Fengdu.

The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources,
Resolve the bonds of ancestors, karmic kin of countless kalpas.
Swiftly erase the ledgers of sin, extinguish the roots of evil.
No restraint or coercion by ghostly throngs.

The Northern Capital’s Frigid Pool, its legions guard body and soul.
Subdue demons and sponsor promotion, deliver ranks to the Southern Palace.
Dead souls receive refinement, immortal transformation into human form.
Living beings receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas without end,
Revolving through kalpic cycles, their years equaling Heaven’s span.
Forever delivered from the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings and Eight Hardships,
Transcending the Three Realms, carefree in the Supreme Clarity.

This method employs the Jade Clarity mudra, Eastern qi.
Upon completing the talisman’s inscription, make a second petition.

The humble official [Name], with utmost sincerity, burns incense and reverently petitions
Before the Most High, Boundless Dao, the Golden Portal’s Seven Treasures, the Most Venerable Sacred Throne.
Humbly beseeching the Dao’s compassion to deign a penetrating gaze.
Hearing the Great Dao proclaim mercy, opening the Eight Gates to save the suffering.
The Perfected expound the teachings, unfolding the Three Registers to deliver humanity.
All who petition and perform rites shall surely receive salvation.
Your servant has diligently followed the fast’s methods, inscribing the Most High’s various true talismans.
Though I have conducted the rites according to the method, I still fear lapses in mindfulness, errors in incantations or mudras,
Or reliance on others’ hands, leading to omissions or mistakes in brushstrokes.
Or failing to grasp the profound principles, thus violating the mysterious regulations.
Again, I implore Heaven’s grace to descend and aid, allowing true qi to flow freely,
Infusing the inscribed talismans, mending deficiencies and completing them,
Making them radiant and soaring, all imbued with the light of merit and virtue,
Perfectly resonating with the mysteries of the Supreme Mystery.
As I issue proclamations, may all comply without fail,
Opening the path for sunken souls, liberating them from suffering.
Above, manifesting the virtue of cherishing life;
Below, fulfilling the sincerity of delivering the dead.
Your servant, daring to offend Heaven’s majesty, is overwhelmed with reverence.
Respectfully stated.

Three bows. Store the talisman in its casket.

For all ritual actions, pace the stars according to the matter at hand, then burn the talisman in the censer—its officers and generals will arrive immediately. This is the natural chapter formed by the Primordial Beginning’s ancestral *qi*, bestowed upon those who study the immortal arts; it is to be practiced in secrecy.

**Memorial Format**
Lingbao Great Dharma Bureau. The Most High descends in perfection; the talisman of the summoned spirit commands the summoning and seizing of the myriad spirits. Write the talisman here. Jade Clarity’s Primordial Azure, most urgent—swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning’s summoning of the myriad spirits and command to seize. Memorial submitted in the such-and-such year, such-and-such month, such-and-such day, such-and-such hour. The Dharma rank of so-and-so surname, receiving the edict and carrying it out.

**Incantation for Summoning the Two Generals**
The Nine Heavens have a mandate, announced above to Jade Clarity. Hasten the summoning of a thousand Perfected; all assemble in the Emperor’s court. The Supreme One gazes below; the Twin Emperors display their forms. They oversee the myriad evils, govern *qi*, and seize life. If there is any inauspiciousness, they test the divine luminaries. The Way of the Azure Emperor marshals the divine soldiers. The Seven Spirits hold the reins; the Heavenly Peng marches to the right. The divine sword leads the way; flames and fire bells flash forth. The command is issued to armored troops; the celestial soldiers and Heavenly Ding engage. Wind and fire join battle, vanquishing evil and strangling spirits. Above, they awe the Six Heavens; below, they seize the myriad spirits. Having awed and seized, the myriad malevolences are destroyed. The divine halberd sweeps like lightning; no life remains for demons and traitors. The Immortal Emperor holds the staff—who dares delay the command? Those who resist the staff and defy the order will have their forms destroyed. Each be vigilant, each be cautious, and preserve your yellow tranquility. The Nine Heavens’ edict commands; the myriad spirits respectfully listen. Respectfully summon such-and-such spirit to heed my instructions. Whoever dares defy my command defies Upper Clarity. Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning’s command and the myriad spirits’ law seize.

**Method for Visualization**
On the right: visualize the Heavenly Gate opening, yellow clouds swirling around. The two Perfected Persons stand within the clouds, holding jade tablets. Above them is a golden casket; they descend, inhale, and draw it into the talisman. Then, with the right hand, burn the talisman and blow upon the left.

All spirits heed and comply.

I act by the Supreme Edict—

**Nine Heavens’ Cloud Paths, Orthodox Unity Merit-Officer, swiftly manifest your True Form!**

This talisman, whenever transmitting documents,
Often encounters demonic deviance obstructing and intercepting.
First burn this talisman,
Then transform the documents.

Scorching and breaking the *Gang* winds—
No deviance dares offend,

Burn the demonic bodies into nonexistence.

This talisman, whenever transmitting documents,
Often encounters demonic deviance,
Fearing punishment and dreading the ritual master’s memorial,
They conspire to sink and conceal, preventing the transmission from reaching its destination.
Or when households encounter misfortune,
Defiling the documents,
Making it difficult to ascend and present.
Use this talisman to escort and protect,
Passing directly through the Heavenly Gate,
Enveloped in ten thousand *zhang* of True Fire burning the void.

**Dispatching *Gang* Wind Incantation**
Fire-Bell, Fire-Bell,
Assist my mighty numina.

**Supreme Opening Heaven Talisman**
**Heaven-Gate-Penetrating Talisman**
**Polaris-Wind-Passing Talisman**
**Memorial Text Formula**

To the right, the talismans summon the Perfected Messengers of the Central Realm, together with the Jade Maidens and Jade Lads, to ascend and memorialize before the Divine Officials, the Merit Registrars, and the Talisman Clerks. Herewith, they shall bear aloft the memorial documents and supplications, proceeding directly to the Three Heavens. As they traverse the Three Realms amid the polar winds and vast qi, the demonic gods of the Six Heavens and all lawless spirits shall not obstruct or intercept them.

It is commanded that the Orthodox Unity Merit Registrar, the Great General of Flowing Gold and Fire Bell, seize them and deliver them to the Heavenly Prison, where they shall be punished according to the law and duly executed.

This format is identical to the preceding one. If the former talismans are employed, this memorial text may be omitted. Otherwise, all four talismans may be inscribed at the forefront, and their use may be discretionary. The incantations and dispatching spells remain as before.

**Fasting Rites and Talisman Scripts Section**
**Four Courier Memorials**

The Master said: For every establishment of a Mystic Altar, one must set up the Four Courier Courts, dedicated solely to receiving and transmitting talismanic dispatches—this mirrors the post stations of the mortal realm.

The Four Couriers are: the Flood Dragon Courier, the Golden Dragon Courier, the Wind-Fire Courier, and the Golden Horse Courier. Each courier is governed by divine officers, appearing as mighty warriors bearing yellow command banners, awaiting deployment. They must be summoned through talismans inscribed according to the prescribed form before they may descend in response.

For the two dragon couriers, fresh and pure *jia* stalks should be bound to represent their true forms. Each courier officer wields a sword in the left hand and holds a banner in the right, upon which is inscribed *"Jade Emperor, Heavenly Worthy of Pardoning Sins."* On their backs, they bear the *"True Talisman of Azure Mystery, Savior from Suffering,"* shaped like a scroll tube. The bodies of the dragon couriers and the forms of the dragon-mouthed spirit scribes must be prepared with talismans according to the prescribed method, accompanied by invocations and praises.

The Flood Dragon Officer pertains to *yin*; when dispatched, it should be paired with the Earthly Office’s Merit Clerk to journey to the Five Peaks, Nine Netherworlds, Water Palaces, Thunder Bureaus, Plague Controllers, City Gods, Earth Deities, and prison cells—wherever souls in bondage may be rescued. The Golden Dragon Officer pertains to *yang*; when dispatched, it should be paired with the Yellow Register Institute’s Merit Clerk and talisman officers to journey to the Three Officials’ Heavenly Prisons, the Five Ladles’ Heavenly One Northern Dungeon, the iron-walled enclosures of Luo and Zheng, and all manner of hellish confines—wherever souls may be delivered. This is because *yin* and *yang* must each follow their kind.

Each of the Four Couriers has its own jurisdiction. The talismans for summoning the *jia* Dragon and Golden Dragon Officers have already been provided following the *"Longevity and Salvation from Suffering"* talisman. The rest are detailed below for your careful use.

**Wind-Fire Courier**

The Master said: The Wind-Fire Courier comprises one bureau, called the Fire Bureau. A Judgment Officer presides over it, overseeing both the Left Wind Courier and the Right Fire Courier. The Left is solely responsible for transmitting talismans, decrees, pardons, and documents from the Southern Bureau; the Right is solely responsible for transmitting talismans, edicts, and documents from the Northern Bureau. This Judgment Officer, then, governs the documents of both the Southern and Northern Bureaus. The Wind-Fire Bureau’s Judgment Officer is named Ma Sheng: his face is green, with three eyes; he wears a clustered golden net hat, a vermilion robe, golden armor, green boots, and red hair; he wields a sword and may transform into a being with three heads and nine eyes. Within the two couriers under his command, there are ten Judgment Officers each and three hundred courier clerks. All edicts, talismans, registers, and documents pass through the hands of the presiding officer for inspection and transmission. If any errors or discrepancies are found, they are detained at this courier station and cannot be forwarded; each is assigned to the appropriate prison for punishment. Whenever a fast is established, a formal document must first be submitted to petition for corrections. Then, using this talisman to dispatch a courier clerk will ensure transmission and evoke a manifest response. The talisman method provided hereafter is what people refer to as the Wind-Fire Courier Transmission—this is precisely what it means.

**Talisman for Summoning the Wind-Fire Courier Clerk**
This talisman is written in cinnabar on yellow paper. With the Jade Mudra and *qi* drawn from the northwest, recite the activation incantation to summon one Judgment Officer from the courier station to inspect and verify talismans and decrees. Immediately dispatch one courier clerk from this station; if any errors are found, they will be corrected at once, and the transmission will proceed swiftly.

**Golden Horse Courier**
The Master said: The Golden Horse Courier has a presiding officer who commands one hundred twenty courier clerks. All wear cloud-patterned hats, vermilion robes, and vermilion shoes, and ride flying horses. For all urgent talismans, decrees, and documents that must pass through the Three Officials, Five Masters, Nine Bureaus, Four Offices, the Luo and Zheng Northern Bureaus, the Three Realms, the myriad spirits’ records, and the camps of ghosts—wherever the proclamation is to be universally announced throughout the Three Realms—none may conceal or obstruct it. The edict is issued in an instant, and the divine power and might of the courier ensure that no barriers impede it. Wherever the command arrives, all spirits obey.

**Talisman for Summoning the Golden Horse Courier Clerk**
This talisman is written in cinnabar on yellow paper. With the Jade Mudra and *qi* drawn from the northwest, recite the activation incantation to employ the courier clerks. Burn the talisman at the ritual gate to dispatch one clerk to traverse the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, transmitting decrees and talismans, delivering the suffering souls of the underworld, and achieving the swiftest urgency—arriving in but a moment.

**General Incantation for Employing the Two Couriers**
Recite this incantation three times, with the Jade Mudra and *qi* drawn from the northwest:
*In vermilion script of jade, I reverently receive and obey the teaching.
Proclaiming to the myriad sages, hasten inspection and presentation.
I implore the immortal clerks: let wind and fire never cease.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and ordinances!*

**Jia-Long Identity Scroll**
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, I universally proclaim to the Three Officials:
The courier dragon of the Left transmits, aligning talismans to receive *qi*.
Soaring radiantly through the great void, the dead souls undergo refinement.
Once delivered without end, they ascend immediately—let none linger.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor commands!*

**Golden Dragon Identity Scroll**
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, I universally proclaim to Fengdu:
The courier dragon of the Right transmits, penetrating the dark paths of the underworld.
Exhausted souls receive deliverance, wandering carefree in the Void.
Today I dispatch you.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor saves!*

**Jia-Long Talisman of Summons**
O Jia-Long of the Earth Prison, true talisman of salvation from suffering,
Pursue and retrieve the departed souls, that they may swiftly depart Fengdu.
Come to pay homage before the Most High and ascend to the Heavenly Palace.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Purity statutes command!*

**Golden Dragon Talisman of Summons**
O Golden Dragon of the Fire Bureau, efficacious talisman of longevity,
Deliver the suffering souls, that they may directly exit the dark capital.
Beholding the light, they ascend to be reborn in the Southern Palace.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Purity statutes command!*

**Left Youth Talisman**
**Right Youth Talisman**
*Left Youth Banner Talisman* (Jade Purity Mudra, *qi* of the Heavenly Gate):
The divine roams carefree, its merit penetrating the Three Purities.
Below, it transmits talismanic decrees to refine the essence of suffering souls.
Carefree and joyous, they receive form in the Southern Prosperity.
Universally summoning the Three Realms, ceaselessly, moment by moment.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor commands!*

*Right Youth Banner Talisman* (Jade Purity Mudra, *qi* of the Heavenly Gate):
The Lord Emperor of the Dark Capital, with jade tablets and true jade,
Swift as thunder, wind, and lightning, clouds and dragons assist the spirits.
Above, it penetrates the Three Realms; below, it gazes upon the Wheel of Wind.
The Nine Dark Regions open for deliverance, and souls become human.

*Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor commands!*

**Chapter on Transforming the Ritual Space**
The Master said: Whenever a numinous altar is established, the world of dust is defiled and impure. Without the Dao of divine transformation, it is difficult to reach the imperial perfected ones. Therefore, one first employs talismans to summon and transform the space, then rolls up the curtain to present offerings and open the altar for the ritual. The following is the talisman for the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor’s transformation of the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers.

**Talisman for the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor’s Transformation of the Golden Gates and Jade Chambers**
(Jade Purity Mudra, *qi* of the East):
*Assembling and harmonizing Heaven and Earth,
Uniting with the sun and moon,
Auspicious clouds densely cover, and propitious *qi* swirls.
The Three Flowers depart at will,
The Five Luminances open the gates,
Jade chambers resound with wondrous tones,
Jade pavilions chant Brahmanic hymns.
The vast expanse holds no mirror, yet the forest of spirits is purified and clear.
The golden city gleams, the jade steps spiral,
The Great Floating Black Soil and the Azure Heavens sing in empty space.*

**Format for the Proclamation Document**
Write the talisman in cinnabar on yellow paper. The outer document may be permeable; write the proclamation in ink.

**Celestial Treasure Great Dharma Bureau**
Now, for the fast’s sponsor [Name], who establishes a numinous altar and conducts a fast to honor the Dao, I invite the descent of the Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens and the lofty perfected ones of the Ten Poles to transform and refine this dusty dwelling into the Black Soil.

*Write the talisman here:*

The Upper Capital of Jade Mountain, the wondrous court of Great Possession,
The Golden Gates and Jade Chambers—within them dwell the imperial perfected ones.

Holding the talismans and registers, all arrive at the numinous altar.
As each receives deliverance, they ascend to fly in the Upper Purity.

*Right: Reverently receive the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree and the Void Sovereign Dao Lord’s salvation below. At the site of the fast’s establishment, transform the numinous altar to become the Golden Gates. When the talisman arrives, obey and act accordingly.*

In the Primordial Azure, the Great Transformation unfolds,
Joyously uniting the Ten Heavens.

Spontaneously generating all existence.

**Chapter on Inviting the Light**

The Master says: To deliver and uplift the yin spirits,
One must obtain the method of Wisdom Light,
Thereby descending the wisdom of the Three Lights,
To connect with the light of mortal fire,
So as to illuminate and shatter the darkness,
And deliver those sunk in the netherworld.
Without this method,
It remains but the light of mortal fire,
Incapable of transcendence.

The method states: On the day of the proper fast at noon,
Face south toward the sun and burn incense.
Inhale qi and blow upon the brush,
Then inscribe twelve Wisdom Light talismans in cinnabar on nine-inch yellow paper.
Use the Jade Purity mudra and Eastern Qi.
Seal with wax to form a torch,
To be used for emitting the light of lamps.

---

**Jade Purity Wisdom Light Talisman**

Sun, moon, and stars’ light
Shatters the depths of the Yellow Springs.
The Primordial Beginning’s qi evolves the Three Lights,

Revolves the turning sphere.

Yang’s brilliance divides its splendor.
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom and grace,
Unfolds great compassion.
Today, in joyous celebration,
The Three Lights record the rites.
I now make my entreaty,
To open and reveal heaven’s mechanism.
Above, generate yang’s light,
Below, illuminate the dark paths.
Radiance emerges from dense yin,
Eternally freeing the souls of the netherworld.

*Swiftly, swiftly, by the Emperor’s statutes and decrees.*

**Upper Purity Wisdom Light Talisman**

The light of nine suns,
Stops at noon to shine brightly.
The essence of the Six Harmonies,
Returns to the ultimate yang.
The Primordial Beginning’s Wisdom Light,
Numinous Treasure’s Wisdom Light.
The Five Stars’ true qi,
The constellations’ radiant glow.
The sun is yang’s brilliance, qi piercing the pivot of authority,
The moon is the imperial flower, qi irrigating the Seven Origins.
The Jade Emperor’s qi,
The Jade Void’s qi,
The Jade Dawn’s qi.
The Three Terraces gleam,
The Heavenly Center is revered.
In the profound darkness of the netherworld,
Fengdu’s depths sink and decay.
The Three Paths suffer torment and punishment.
The Heavenly Worthy’s compassionate Wisdom Light,
Shatters the dense yin’s gloom and obscurity,
Illuminating like the sun and moon’s light.
Bathed in the grace of wisdom,
They ascend directly to the heavenly halls.

**Then recite the Upper Purity Talisman Incantation:**

The Three Lights’ clarity.
Sun and moon’s morning glory,
Starlight’s united brilliance.
The Three Flowers’ precious radiance,
Merges with the host of crystals.

Ever descending through the void,
Below, it illuminates the netherworld.

Piercing the Ten Directions.
The Three Paths cease their opposition,
The Five Sufferings halt their cycles.
The Flame Mountain’s fires extinguish,
Ice melts and snow dissolves.
Blades transform into jade trees,
Swords become forests of *jian* trees.
Iron cities crumble,
Souls ascend to the Jade Purity.
I now make my supplication above,
Praying for the gift of illumination.
The sun and moon’s spirit consorts,
The starlight’s true persons.
Twelve in number,
Bow their heads and obey.
Distribute the lamps’ light,
Illuminating the cold courts.

*Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and decrees.*

At one glimpse of radiance, ascend to the Celestial Hall.

Majestic and solemn.
Wisdom Light’s finest rays rescue and deliver from suffering and filth,
Solar Essence Fragrant Lamp, Lunar Essence Spirit Lamp—

A million demon kings bow in submission,

Dark souls rejoice, the Primal Spring scatters all before it.
Great One of the Central Dipper commands and gathers,
Light illumines the Eight Poles without bound.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and decrees.*

Now kindle the Supreme Purity Talisman’s incantation, the Three Treasures’ formula:
The Three Qi,
Vermilion Brightness unfolds the chart,
Moving and conveying by nature.
The Three Luminaries reveal,
Eons before time.
Today, great celebration—
Sunken souls receive refinement.
Deep gloom and dark obscurity,
Forever sealed in the Cold Spring.
Desiring to invoke gracious light,
Universally illumine the Nether Pass.
Ice’s cold warms, furnace’s embers cease their smoke.
Blade mountains and sword trees,
Forever severed from climbing and grasping.
Turned light in the Ten Directions,
Illuminating all heavens.

The Three Dawns shine as one,
Forever in the Primal Origin.
Luminous Youth,
Receiving grace, ascends to the Highest Source.
Three Lights’ Jade Maidens,
Request as spoken.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and decrees.*

**Acquiring the Great Solar Method**
Method states: At the hour of *wu*, first take the solar mirror’s fire,
Awaiting the sun’s illumination of the Southern Palace’s Flourishing Yang.
Recite the Solar Radiance Spirit Incantation, saying:
*"Brilliant is the Great Sun’s radiance,
Divine light penetrates the Three Purities.
Qi scatters within the Dark Wilderness,
Clouds and mist arise in the Purple Court.
Controlling and guiding, riding wind and rosy clouds,
Drifting and wafting, boundless and formless.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the statutes and decrees.*"*

Hold the incense powder in the *li* trigram of the face, grasp the mirror in the left hand and the talisman in the right, with the torch facing them. Silently recite the incantation, saying:
*"Solar soul, vermilion radiance,
Illuminates the green-shrouded glow.
Returning rosy clouds, crimson spirit,
Mysterious flames raise the image."*

Upon completion, use the solar-flame mirror to capture the sun’s brilliance. Dip the talisman-torch in oil, then touch it to the incense to light a single lamp before the Primordial Origin. For three days and nights, five days and nights, seven days and nights, or up to forty-nine days and nights, the flame must never be extinguished, even briefly. When the candle burns out, light another to continue. If the sky is overcast, use wood-fire instead.

This is called the *Central True Fire*, which can penetrate the Nine Netherworlds below and ascend its light to the Three Luminaries above, universally illuminating the Hall of Blessings.

**Jade Clarity’s Generative Transformation: Radiant Wisdom Talisman of the Three Lights’ Secret**
Compassionate treasure-script,
Jade peaks wafting mist.
Flowering lamps spread and scatter,
Universally illuminating the Nine Springs.
The Three Realms grow bright,
Radiance disperses through the Ten Heavens.
Profound darkness bathed in light,
Wisdom extends boundlessly.
Today is the great celebration,
Liberation from suffering, ascension to immortality.
The Dao generates the One Qi,
All things attain wholeness.
The Primordial Origin’s mighty script,
Generates transformation naturally.
*Swiftly, swiftly, by the Jade Clarity Highest Emperor’s decree.*

**Chapter on Awakening Yin and Summoning Yang**
The Master states: The method of the golden bell and jade chime is used to summon and gather the two spirits of yin and yang within oneself, harmonizing heaven and earth, dispelling impurities and defilements, assembling true numina, opening the ten directions, communicating the obscure and the luminous, pursuing and capturing souls, thoroughly collecting and delivering breaths, preventing reckless dissipation. These two spirits govern them.

Thus, at the beginning of altar-opening, one must sound the bell and chime, burn talismans to summon and gather them. The alternating sounds emerge and merge as one, thereby refining yin into yang and upholding pure sincerity. Without stray thoughts or disordered intent, one may then summon the spirits.

Modern people’s veneration of the golden bell and jade chime is not far from this.

The Yang Spirit is named *Lu Hui*, styled *Yan Ling*, eight feet and three inches tall, wearing a *Liang* crown and fiery robes, wielding a sword in his right hand. He presides over yang inquiries at spirit shrines, purifies heaven and earth’s defilements, and drives away the spirits of the hundred trees.

The Yin Spirit is named *Lu Tong*, styled *Yong Fu*, eight feet and three inches tall, wearing a *Liang* crown, white robes with wide sleeves, and wielding a sword while standing amidst qi and clouds. He presides over yin inquiries at the nether bureaus and various prisons, can purify the world’s defilements, and sever the torments of the yin realm.

**Talisman of the Great General Who Repels Wrongdoing**
**Talisman of the Great General Who Guards the Altar**
*(These two talismans derive from the Divine Empyrean Method.)*

**Chapter of the Twelve Palace Steps**

The Master said: To establish the Great Purification, one must first erect the Twelve Palace Steps to summon the exalted immortals and perfected spirits and conduct the ritual proceedings. The Twelve Palaces are as follows:

First, the Azure Radiance Hall, where for nine mornings the *Hymn of Salvation from Suffering* is chanted, the *Azure Heavens Void Song Talisman* is burned, and the *Seal of the Demon King* is worn.

Second, the Hall of the Divine Tiger, where each morning the talismans of the *Lord Overseer* and *Lord Scribe* are burned.

Third, the Bureau of Rectification, where for nine mornings impeachments are made and the *Talisman for Descending Perfection and Summoning Spirits* is burned.

**Three Hymns of Salvation from Suffering of the Azure Radiance**
I.
The Heavenly Worthy vows with great compassion,
Salvation everywhere transforms good causes.
The Five Marchmounts and Four Bureaus all receive decrees,
The Northern Bureau of Fengdu halts all punishments.
True talismans descend, all receive pardon,
Divine youths proclaim salvation for the guilty.
The Primordial Beginning’s transformed body is wondrous in function,
Delivering boundless beings, the Dao is then perfected.

II.
The Heavenly Worthy vows to deliver all beings,
Expounding the Dharma with solemn dignity in the Jeweled Grove.
Nine-headed lions manifest auspicious signs,
Wisdom’s light shines, dispelling layered darkness.
Blade mountains and sword trees all shatter and break,
Fire screens, wind, and thunder swiftly cease.
Great wisdom, great compassion, boundless power—
The Fengdu underworld all beholds and hears.

III.
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom saves yin spirits,
Salvation upon hearing cries breaks iron cities.
Vast deliverance, boundless, follows wishes to cross,
Radiant light universally illuminates the darkest depths.
Where wisdom’s wind blows, flames and smoke vanish,
When Dharma rain falls, sprouts flourish.
Boundless compassion perfects deliverance,
The departed all meet the Compassionate Worthy.

**Inconceivable merit and virtue.**

**Azure Heavens Void Song Talisman**
This talisman is drawn with both hands in the *chen* position, one stroke covering, one stroke facing upward, from the heart to the hairline. Close the eyes and visualize the body as the Primordial Beginning, bearing a halo, wielding a *ruyi*, the forehead radiating nine-colored light, which then transforms into a five-colored lion throne. Purple clouds cover the body, luminous and penetrating the ten directions. Upon coming to court, intone the *qi*, draw three breaths into the brush, form the *Ding* Mudra of the Supreme Emperor, stand facing east, and inscribe. Strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, then visualize the five viscera’s five-colored *qi* entering the talisman. This talisman, placed above the altar, can summon the perfected of the ten directions to descend and dispel defilements. It may also be recited over, burned, practiced, or swallowed.

**Seal of Pacification and Stabilization**
The Master said: In ancient times, when the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy had just divided the primordial chaos and the Three *Qi* unfolded the chart, the one *qi* of the Great Dao’s primordial essence transformed into the *Lingbao* Red Writ. It congealed into script, descended upon the five directions, pacified and stabilized heaven and earth, summoned and commanded true spirits, eliminated heavenly disasters above, protected and stabilized the emperor, warded off poison and harm below, delivered the myriad people, subdued gods and ghosts, and rescued the sunken and drowning—nothing it could not accomplish. Thus, when establishing a purification, one erects a canopy and unfurls the altar, modeling heaven and earth. The nine yang grounds are transformed into golden palaces and jade steps, where a thousand perfected and ten thousand sages assemble in mixed ranks. At that time, when east and west are not yet fixed and the circulation of *qi* is not yet settled, in the space between bowing and raising the head, it is as if turning the palm. One must then scatter the five directions’ jade scripts to summon and stabilize the divine perfected, pacify the five directions, repel and expel demonic vapors, purify the altar space, harmonize square and round, unite movement and stillness, and only then may one invite and receive the imperial perfected, awaiting the mysterious response.

**Method:** When erecting the altar, use the Red Writs of the Five Elders.
First, at dawn, use the *Hundun* Red Writ.
Second, at dawn, use the *Jade Writ for Restraining Demons* or the *Yuandong Jade Calendar Chapter*.
Third, at dawn, use the *Five Lingbao Talismans*.
For setting up the offering, use the *Great Brahma Concealed Language*.
When the affair is concluded, gather the talismans and burn them.
All follows the method of the *Jade Instructions*.

By command, peace and tranquility prevail.
*Swiftly, swiftly, as in statute and ordinance!*

The five talismans are inscribed in colors corresponding to their directions.
First, memorialize the Jade Clarity to request descent.
Invoke the Five Dragons of Golden Splendor and Yellow Mist,
With sun, moon, and stellar lodges all attending,
Transforming the five internal *qi* of five colors,
Converging to form jade towers and phoenix pavilions,
Towering and majestic in array.

**Memorializing the Court**
The master says: The sequence of the court procession,
From entering the oratory to ascending the altar,
Involves offering incense to the ten directions,
Revering the master, reciting incantations,
Kindling the censer, dispatching officials,
Commanding demons, and sealing the censer.
All must rely on talismanic contracts to communicate sincerity,
Thereby assuredly obtaining luminous response.

Heaven is clear, Earth is bright—

Malevolent demons and stale qi,
monstrous calamities, vanish and perish.
The Jade Clarity bears the mandate,
silently transforming the Mysterious Sovereign.
Severing the Six Heavens,
they flee in terror, lurking in concealment.

fierce steeds spread in four directions.
Heavenly Soldiers lead the vanguard,
Great Marshals wield their banners.
Fire is hurled for ten thousand leagues,
jingling bells resound in eight directions.
Should any dare to defy,
resisting the Perfected of the Highest Realm,

the Great Empress of the Rear inflicts punishment.
Dismembering ghostly specters,
wind and fire never cease.
Thousands upon thousands—heads severed,

With both hands, the Twenty-Four Qi—
the numinous *Gang* of the Great Demon-Subduing Formation—
at the moment of burning, visualize the Primordial Origin descending into the Void of the Mysterious,
recite the *Huangzhong* Qi Incantation of the Central Yellow.
Visualize the Primordial Origin descending in golden light,

*Transmitted by Master Xiao Quan-Zhen, the Perfected of Nocturnal Perfection, Opener of Luminous Radiance, Savior from Suffering, Cavernous Mystery Adept*

**Section on Ritual Methods and Talismanic Scripts: The Chapter of Illuminating Lamps**

The Master said: Reverently following the method of illuminating lamps from the *Upper Prime Simplified Writs*—

This method was revealed when the Perfected of Liberation besought the Primordial Celestial Worthy. The Celestial Worthy replied: *"The protocols for deliverance and salvation, the gates of transcendence and ascent—all are fully established within the scriptures of the Three Caverns. Now I shall proclaim for you their essential words: among all rites for salvation and deliverance of the deceased, illuminating lamps is supreme."*

The Five Directions and Eight Extremities, the earthly prisons and dark dungeons—these lie in the regions of utmost yin, the realms of eternal night. The souls of the dead are imprisoned and confined, cut off from the Three Luminaries. In their benighted state, they endure countless trials and torments. Therefore, fashion a lamp-tree from catalpa wood, its top branching into nine cups, each holding a lamp. Below, shape pure earth into a Heaven-and-Earth Wheel: the upper part round to symbolize Heaven, the lower square to symbolize Earth. At the upper tier, place the lamp-tree and suspend nine banners, each inscribed with the *Yin Talismans of the Nine Heavens*. With both hands, write the petition text.

At the middle tier, arrange nine lamps in a circular formation and erect nine tablets of the *Nine Qi*. At the lower tier, place nine lamps and erect nine tablets of the *Earth Sovereigns of the Nine Mounds*. Together, the three tiers comprise three nines—twenty-seven lamps. Beyond these, establish eight gates, each with a lamp, and erect the Eight Trigrams, totaling thirty-five lamps. These correspond to the thirty-five divisions of the primordial qi, the *Eight Radiant Scenes of the Upper Mystery*, merging with the qi to enter the Profound Darkness and ascend to illumine the Nine Heavens.

They regulate the upright qi of peace and harmony, stabilizing the movements of the stellar lodges. At the center, they illumine the Nine Wildernesses, sweeping away calamities from the Nine Lands. Below, they shine upon the Nine Netherworlds, the ninefold yin mounds of deepest darkness, piercing the nine paths of obscurity with light, dispelling gloom and illuminating the hidden. The eight outer gates mirror the Eight Extremities. From the day of death through the seven cycles of seven days, the lamp-light remains unbroken. When suffering souls behold this radiance, they are instantly liberated.

**The Precious Chapter of the Vermilion Radiance Jade Chronicle of the Numinous Treasure, Opening the Primordial Qi of the Three Yangs of the Heavenly Origin**

Through kalpas vast, the divine work unfolds,
Dragon scripts drift upon crimson clouds.
Eight Might surge like lightning’s flash,
Nine Phoenixes shatter demonic hordes.
Refined and delivered to the Moon Sovereign’s chamber,
Ascending in flight to the Primordial Worthy’s abode.
Everlasting, the radiance shines unceasing,
Auspicious blessings embrace the dawn’s splendor.

The four sides together span six feet, corresponding to the yin extreme of Earth’s two-six configuration. Each prison is fashioned with four corners and three bends, and within each prison, three lamps are lit, with talismans placed inside the lamps. At the center, a prison tablet is set, upon which talismans are inscribed. Above, nine banners are suspended, each inscribed with talismans according to the prescribed form.

It is further stated: On the front of the banner, inscribe the Heavenly Worthy of the respective direction; on the reverse, the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions. At the top of the talisman-banner, write the Nine Prisons Talisman; on the two sides, the Hell-Breaking Talisman and the invocation text; at the base, the talisman for the specific prison to which the petition is directed, secured with bamboo stalks.

Another form prescribes nine yellow banners, each inscribed with the *Qi*-Talismans of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Spirits. For each prison broken, one banner is burned. One banner of the Heavens is hung in its place, while at the center, a great banner is erected bearing the sacred title of the Azure Mystery. Let it flutter freely in the wind, and all sins shall be extinguished. This must be performed strictly according to the ritual method; no omission is permissible.

**The Radiant Return Chapter**
*Transmitted by Master Night-Perfected Quanzhen of the Cavernous Subtlety, Illuminator and Savior of Suffering, to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity and Successor in the Teaching of the Numinous Treasure*

The Master said: According to the *Scripture of the Twenty-Four Precepts*, all who live commit twenty-four kinds of sins, and thus after death receive retribution in twenty-four hells, passing through the realms of the Three Wretched Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties. Therefore, the Most High established the *Pattern of the Radiant Return and Descending Light*.

Before the establishment of the fast, erect the *Radiant Return Banner* in the southeast of the altar. Then, fashion a lamp-wheel from catalpa wood, shaped like a chariot axle, with three tiers and a central pillar. On the upper tier place twelve lamps, on the middle tier sixteen, and on the lower tier twenty-one, for a total of forty-nine. At the center, set up five tablets, each inscribed with the names of the various hells. Also prepare forty-nine small banners, alternating in yellow and white. On each banner, inscribe the title of the Heavenly Worthy according to the prescribed form, and at the top write the *Talisman for Shattering Fengdu*. It is fitting to invoke the talismanic commands in accordance with the ritual, widely enacting deliverance. Thus may the light of the Three Luminaries be turned back, obliquely illuminating the gates of the Nine Springs, so that myriad sins are extinguished and suffering souls receive salvation.

**On the Cultivation of the Dao**

Generally, those who cultivate the Dao may, on the days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, inscribe the **Five Afflictions Talisman** in cinnabar upon yellow paper and ingest it to expel the **Three Corpses** and dispel the **Five Afflictions**. They should recite the **Chapter of the Afflicted Spirits**. This hymn was composed by the **Dao Lord** during his journey through the Eight Gates, where he witnessed the dark prisons, layered barriers, and the **Three Rivers and Nine Streams**—the **Mountains of Knives** and **Forests of Swords**—where imprisoned hungry ghosts and punished dead souls were dragged through mire and ashes, their forms unrecognizable. Unable to bear the sight, he was moved to sorrow and thus composed this hymn.

**Chapter of the Afflicted Spirits**
Born into the realm of suffering spirits,
they revolve through the courts of the Five Paths.
The **Nine Dark Realms** unfold in endless night,
through kalpas without light.
Knife-mountains and sword-forests stand,
their poisoned blades jagged and grim.
No flocks of birds gather—
only the wails of afflicted souls are heard.
The whirling wind sways the long branches,
and once it reaches the cold courts, echoes resound.
Above, the **Mountain-Treading Ones** tread ceaselessly,
their steps unrelenting.
Hungry, they feed on spring’s bitter charcoal;
thirsty, they drink the essence of smelting fires.
Dragged through the boundless mire,
how could they know form or name?
Pity those who know not their fate—
how sorrowful, how grievous to the human heart.
Sin and fortune each arise from causes,
good and evil truly stem from the mind.
The wheel turns without end,
its echoes never ceasing.
The **Nine Dark Realms** hold records of existence and void,
through ten thousand kalpas, they seek one another.
The source of endless icy cold,
the long night shrouded in layered shadows.
No sight of virtue and power conjoined—
only the forest of destitute ghosts.
The Long River cannot be dammed,
as suffering souls cling to the axle and wail.
Their voices reach the edge of the sword-forest,
their lamentations fall upon the knife-peaks.
This form is no longer a form—
how painful, how grievous to the human breast.

The Master says: The Celestial Physician perfects the form, the Overseer of Life unties its knots. Yet how can one cleanse the filth and grime of the body? One must employ talismanic script to scour and purify, rendering the body luminous and immaculate before ascending the altar to receive the precepts.

**Bathing Chapter**
The Master says: Mortals in the world are stained by the six dusts, and upon death enter the dark yin. Moreover, with yin qi turbid and dense, layer upon layer of oppressive filth and obscuration arise, such that the singular nature is dulled by dust. Thus the Supreme Mystery bestows precious talismans, that the five fragrant [waters] may irrigate and purify the hun and shen, in hope of transcendent transformation.

**Petition for Resolving Grievances**

**The Master said:** In their worldly lives, people often harm others through restless minds, or incur karmic debts of life and wealth, accumulating manifold resentments and entanglements. This leads to unseen lawsuits and inextricable bonds, leaving no means of deliverance. Having received the grace of Heaven’s salvation and been guided in ritual offerings, though their grudges may not run deep, chance encounters may yet breed disorder. Therefore, in accordance with the rites of purification, employ talismanic scripts suited to the matter to resolve their grievances, turning their hearts toward the Dao, dissolving knots of enmity, and reconciling debts of hatred. Thus may all together ascend to the Land of Bliss.

**Chapter of the Blood Lake Pardon Talisman**
The master states: According to the *Lingbao Jade Register*, even the great and lesser Iron Enclosure Mountains may be reached by pardon. Only the Gorge Stone Prison, its form entirely black, flanked by flames and beneath it a blood lake, lies south of the Great Iron Enclosure Mountain at its southeastern edge—a vast stone, broad above and tapering below, split by a crevice through which the condemned pass. A hundred poisonous brews pour over their bodies and hearts, collectively named the Blood Lake Prison. It confines women who died in childbirth, doomed for kalpas to never glimpse light. Within, a million ghostly soldiers ceaselessly torment the condemned: the Body-Flipping Great Spirit, the Corpse-Hurling Great Spirit, the Heart-Eating and Brain-Devouring Ghost Kings. The filth, suffering, and misery therein are truly pitiable. For souls in such plight, employ separate methods for their deliverance.

Thus does the Most High descend teachings to specially deliver those who suffered death in childbirth—a method distinct from all others. Only in its observance may its boundless merit be fathomed.

By decree of the Primordial August One, the Terrace of Supreme Mystery is empowered to absolve. Reverently receiving the imperial mandate, we humbly submit this petition. We invoke the numinous presence of the Blood Lake deities, bidding them swiftly emerge from the hidden passes to attend this exclusive edict of pardon.

To the right, by the grace of the August Emperor, we address the multitudes of women in the Blood Lake—from kalpas past to this very day. Some have suffered the harm of filial punishment, a consequence of their former lives’ disobedience to parents. Both mother and child perished, bound in karmic enmity, their grievances entwined without release. Yet through the boundless compassion of the Primordial August One, special absolution is granted.

Let the departed, so-and-so, and all the ghostly multitudes of the Blood Lake heed this: resplendent shines the layered void, where Brahma’s net gathers in the azure heavens. The Nine Dragons of the Primordial Beginning draw the chariot, as the August Person reins the azure steeds. Divine radiance gathers the myriad perfected, while pearlescent light unfolds the vast emptiness. The *Lingbao Scriptures* are revealed, and blessings thereby summoned. The mysteries of the Cavernous Profound lie hidden in lofty majesty, as the jade tones of the Dao ripple through the clouds. Beyond measure is the virtue unthought, as the ocean of the Way surges in waves. The dharma’s meaning flows like a rivulet, releasing the captives of the Blood Lake’s prison. Guard firmly the Three Fields, refine the essence until it soars freely, and taste the jade-like numinous mushrooms. Then, at ease, ascend to the Jade Capital.

O great deities of the Blood Lake, illuminate this edict and carry it forth.

Proclaimed on the [day] of the [month] in the year of the [celestial stem-branch], at the hour of [time].

By the [rank] [name], this humble servant, in receipt of the decree, reverently executes the mandate.

The Cavernous Subtlety’s Eminent Adept, Illuminating and Salvific Master of Suffering, Ning Quanzhen, transmitted to the Upper Clarity Three Caverns disciple, Lingbao Preceptor and Lineage Master Wang Qizhen, the *Purificatory Rites and Talismanic Scripts Section*—*Chapter on Deliverance of the Departed*

The Master said: Whenever one undertakes the grand purificatory rite to universally deliver the shades of the netherworld, one must first memorialize the Supreme Mystery and perform the method of deliverance. This begins with the presentation of memorials and prostration of petitions, the issuance of pardons and bestowal of talismans, after which the altar rites may commence. Within the method, there are pardons and registers, tablets and proclamations, talismans and contracts—all to be presented and enacted in proper sequence.

Thus, at the time of preliminary announcement, one presents the *Memorial of Salvation from Suffering* and bestows the *Nine Dragon Talisman* and the *Proclamation of the Azure Palace*. Next, when presenting the *Memorial of the White Horse and Plain Carriage*, one issues the *Universal Announcement to the Three Realms*. When presenting the *Memorial of Breaking Fengdu and Opening the Dao of Karma*, one bestows the *Fengdu Redemption Proclamation*, the *Mandate of the Primordial Beginning’s Interlocking Talismans*, the *Talisman of the Most High’s Pardon and Salvation from Suffering*, the *Talisman for Breaking Hell*, the *Talisman for Deliverance of Shades*, the *Tablets of the Three Officials*, and the *Two Jade Tablets of the Nine Netherworlds*. Upon the completion of the rites at the appointed time, one presents the *Memorial for Opening the Path* and bestows the *Proclamation of the Jade Thearch* and the *Edict to Restrain Earth’s Lone Spirit*. After the purificatory rite is established, one presents the *Memorial for Bathing and Refinement of the Departed*, bestowing the *Proclamation of Golden Liquid Refinement of Form*, the *Proclamation of Thunder Script*, the *Register for Ascension to Heaven*, and the *Talisman of Longevity*. Next, when presenting the *Memorial for Ascending and Delivering the Departed*, one issues the *Announcement to the Passes of All Heavens*. All talismans and proclamations must be presented and enacted according to their categories; they must not be confused, and their sequence should be carefully considered.

Moreover, talismanic contracts are the true mandates of Heaven; when the shades of the netherworld receive them, none fail to comply. Now, according to the purificatory rites, the details are set forth below.

---

**The Most High’s Precious Register for Pardon and Ascension to Heaven**

The method states: First, within the oratory, calm the mind and sit in stillness, refining the inner qi according to the method. Once completed, ascend the altar, face north, and kneel in prostration. Silently memorialize the Lord of the Jade Dawn, the Star Lords of the Southern Dipper, and the various perfected ones of the southern heavens. Implore the descent of the edict of pardon for ascension to heaven, permitting the transcription of talismanic scripts and their bestowal according to the proper form. Recite the following invocation:

Upon completion, visualize nine prostrations, imagining the threefold golden radiance of the Heavenly Gate resplendent, within which stands a golden palace. Behold the Lord of the Jade Dawn, majestic and composed, with perfected attendants arrayed to left and right. Then silently perform nine prostrations. After a long while, perceive the compassionate countenance filled with joy, as jade lads and jade maidens bear a precious casket, descending from the radiance of a hundred treasures before the altar. The light shines like the sun, illuminating heaven and earth. Open the casket and unfold the precious register, matching the number requested for descent. Draw the register into the paper, merging them as one. Visualize the cinnabar brush and inkstone suffused with radiance. Then click the teeth three times, perform three prostrations, and withdraw. Sit upright to rest, allowing the spirit and qi to settle.

Next, with the left hand, form the Mudra of the Supervising Director by pressing the four fingers into the center of the palm. Hold the brush in the right hand, pass it through the incense, and recite the incantation:

*Supreme Mystery of the Primordial, Lord of the Most High Dao.*
*Command this servant to enact the talisman, illuminating and breaking the netherworld prisons.*
*Let the departed shades depart and behold the light.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the statutes and ordinances decree.*

Recite this incantation five thousand times, drawing the blue, yellow, and white qi of the Heavenly Gate into the brush and the cinnabar paper. First, inscribe the twenty-eight characters of the supreme talismanic script. Then, with the left hand, form the Mudra of the Southern Dipper, pressing the positions of *zi*, *chou*, *zhong*, *zhong*, *si*, *si*, *shang*, *shang*. Visualize the six stars like the rising sun, descending from the south in boundless radiance. Insert the mudra into the register, imagining the six stars’ light penetrating the register, merging with its six stars to become one, shining through to the reverse side.

Next, with the left hand, form the *Li* trigram mudra, drawing its light into the brush. First, inscribe the taboo names of the six stars:

*In the Palace of Li, the brilliance aligns with the sun and moon.*
*Governed by the Fire Thearch, endowed with the essence of yin and yang.*
*Exalted at the Southern Culmen, forging souls and casting spirits, might unparalleled.*
*Bending to pardon the shades of the Nine Netherworlds.*

Then, apply the true titles of the Six Palaces, circling each star six times:

*Perfected Lord of the Celestial Treasury, Controller of Destiny*
*Perfected Lord of the Celestial Minister, Keeper of the Register*
*Perfected Lord of the Great Beam, Extender of Longevity*
*Perfected Lord of the Celestial Lad, Increaser of Years*
*Perfected Lord of the Celestial Pivot, Deliverer from Calamity*
*Perfected Lord of the Celestial Mechanism, Bestower of Life*

Next, click the teeth twelve times, draw in qi, and invoke:

*Great Brahma qi, pervading the ten directions.*
*Within it, the divine power to deliver beings from death, ceaselessly saving the boundless.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the statutes and ordinances of the Thearch decree.*

Recite this incantation while tracing the stars’ alignment with the brush. When the brush and incantation are exhausted, blow qi and insert the mudra. Next, inscribe the four characters below, reciting *Oṃ hīṃ caṭ hriḥ* nine times. Form the central mudra, visualizing the golden light of the Heavenly Gate like a long rainbow entering the register, shining through to the reverse side, then begin writing.

Recite *Oṃ hīṃ caṭ hriḥ* as the incantation, without limit to the number of repetitions. Recite these four characters, circling each character four times, totaling sixteen circles. Lift the brush upward, then use another brush to cover the top. Recite the incantation:

*Mandate of the Primordial Beginning, timely ascension and promotion.*
*Let the departed shades receive deliverance and immediately ascend to heaven.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the statutes and ordinances of the Primordial Thearch decree.*

Draw in the golden light of the Heavenly Gate, form the Peach Mudra of Jade Clarity, and wield the brush. Visualize the golden light and Dao qi bursting forth from the mudra, the talisman’s golden radiance illuminating the ten directions, delivering the living and aiding the dead.

Write in concealment, reciting the *Incantation of the Most High’s Compassion* three times for each character. Additionally, there are the *Heaven-Covering* and *Earth-Supporting* strokes, which cap each character. Rotate the brush nine times over these two strokes, reciting:

*By the edict of the Most High, the Salvific Thearch of Suffering, I act.*

Insert the brush nine times, then draw in the qi of the Azure Mystery. The aforementioned four characters may be written in standard script, mirror script, or layered script—each has its explanation.

These are the secret taboo names of the Lord of the Jade Dawn. The Primordial Beginning is the teacher of the Lord of the Jade Dawn, hence the use of the Primordial Beginning’s statutes and ordinances. None who receive this fail to ascend to heaven, thus it is called the *Precious Register for Ascension to Heaven*. Upon completion of writing, recite the dedicatory incantation.

The Six Stars of the Southern Ascendant emerge from darkness into obscurity.
By imperial edict, I swiftly oversee the living spirits.
Once inscribed in the Southern Prosperity’s celestial register, the soul returns.
Hasten, hasten, as statute and ordinance command.

**General Incantation**
The Most High Dao Lord issues decree to Kunlun:
One divine talisman—liberate and deliver the dead souls.
Hasten, hasten, as statute and ordinance command.

This incantation is most efficacious when recited repeatedly without limit. Combine it with the preceding secret taboo names, and invoke with talisman and incantation. Then inhale the myriad golden rays of the Heavenly Gate into the register, piercing its central script. Visualize the starlight intertwining, radiant as the sun, luminous within and without, utterly transparent.

Next, offer incense, strike the teeth nine times, kneel and bow thrice, then petition once more for descent, employing the same visualization as before. When performing rites at the altar, follow the same invocation and visualization. Upon completion, burn the petition while visualizing the golden light within the register illuminating the ten directions and the nine depths of the Yellow Springs, resplendent without exception. All sinful souls behold this brilliance, escape suffering, and ascend to perfection.

**Register Formula**
The *Precious Register for Imperial Pardon and Ascension to Heaven* of the Supreme Primordial Most High.
Proclaimed to the wardens of the celestial prisons and earthly hells across the ten directions and three realms.

Deliverer of mortals from death, Divine Lord of the Southern Culmen and Everlasting Life,
Celestial Marshal of Salvation, Benevolent Lord Han, Venerable Master—

**Supreme**
**Primordial**
**Mystery**
**Jade**
**Dawn**
**Dao**
**Lord**
**Instructs**
**Your Servant**
**To Deploy the Talisman**
**To Shatter the Prisons of Darkness**
**And Liberate the Dead Souls**

**Urgent! Urgent!**
**As the Statutes of the Most High Command!**

By virtue of this decree, the duly ordained servant of the Dharma, [Name], submits this petition. Given the irrepressible plea herein, repeated memorials have been dispatched to the Celestial Court to seek the imperial will and issue its proclamation. Yet, fearing that the recommended departed souls, burdened by deep-rooted transgressions, may not yet qualify for pardon and remain bound in the nether bureaus, enduring suffering without deliverance—it is now beseeched that the *Precious Register for Imperial Pardon and Ascension to Heaven* of the Most High be proclaimed, to redeem and ransom the sinful souls, liberating them from the realms of suffering.

In accordance with this edict, the command is now issued:

**Right Decree:**
The *Precious Register for Imperial Pardon and Ascension to Heaven* of the Most High is hereby proclaimed to the ten directions and three realms—
to the celestial bureaus and earthly hells,
to the mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks,
to the depths of the Yellow Springs and the gates of darkness,
to the Northern Capital of Fengdu,
to the Six Caves and Ten Palaces,
to the Three Officials and Nine Courts,
to the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus,
to the desolate wastes and shadowed paths,
to all great earthly hells,
to the nine provinces and their domains,
to blessed lands and sacred mountains,
to city gods, earth deities, and local spirits,
to all places under the governance of divine beings and the records of immortal offices—
wherever sins are weighed and virtues examined,
wherever merits are assessed and transgressions scrutinized,
all wardens of celestial prisons and earthly hells shall receive and obey this talismanic command.

By this decree, the departed soul of [Name] and all souls to be delivered—
the lonely spirits of the nine provinces,
the imprisoned souls of the nether courts,
the suffering shades of the dark realms,
the sin-laden spirits enduring retribution—
for all transgressions committed in life through the three karmas and six senses,
for all afflictions of worldly toil,
for all debts of enmity and misfortune accrued after death,
whether by error or intent—
**all such sins are hereby pardoned.**

Whether they slew their lord or father, or failed in filial duty to their parents;
whether they slandered the Great Dao, turning from truth to falsehood;
whether they harmed their siblings or rebelled against their masters;
whether they conspired with kin to commit incest or violate blood ties;
whether they were bandits who took lives, or butchers who slaughtered the innocent;
whether they oppressed the weak or abused the lowly;
whether they feigned devotion to the Three Treasures while their hearts remained divided;
whether they disdained Dharma masters or defiled sacred texts;
whether they harbored malice, cruelty, or envy;
whether they sowed discord with slander or disrupted the virtuous;
whether they killed living beings in wanton sacrifice or exposed the Three Luminaries to defilement;
whether their sins arose from thought, speech, or deed—
whether committed by themselves or instigated in others—
**all transgressions accumulated over kalpas past, by the boundless mercy of the Most High, are now expunged from the ledgers of sin, their evil roots severed and obliterated. They shall not be detained.**

Forthwith, they shall depart the hells, forever escaping the shadows of the netherworld, and all shall attain the wondrous fruit.

Like those burdened with sand and stone, or those who draw from the boundless deep;
like those who command thunder and lightning, or who level mountains, pierce the earth, or channel the waters of heaven—
**all such toils and labors are hereby ended, and they shall dwell in eternal freedom.**

Henceforth, the aforementioned departed souls shall:
- refine their seven *qi* to achieve perfection,
- harmonize the six rites to traverse the void,
- restore the five spirits to continuity,
- draw strength from the two luminaries to sustain their decline,
- ascend the cosmic web and tread the heavens,
- soar through the cloud palaces,
- awaken to the origin of their embryonic form,
- conclude the kalpas of their dust-bound existence,
- nurture their essence within the golden city,
- condense their spirit within the jade cavern,
- cultivate their true *qi* within to become perfected beings.

Above, they shall ascend to the Great Void; below, they shall penetrate the depths of the Yellow Springs.
Within the cloud palaces and jeweled towers, their true souls shall dwell,
moving freely through the lands of blessing,
circling the gates of life,
chewing the sacred fungus,
sipping from the golden springs,
bathing in the flowing sweet dew,
filling their cinnabar fields with its abundance,
as the purple radiance of dawn illumines their path,
and the three *qi* condense into mist.
Within the jade chambers, they shall transform into immortals,
seated upon golden lotuses,
their true forms eclipsing the sun,
where kalpas become but years—
**all in accordance with this proclaimed command.**

Proclaimed on an auspicious day, month, and year, at a propitious hour.

The duly ordained servant of the Dharma, [Name], receives the decree and obeys.

**Celestial Pivot, Supreme Minister,**
**Celestial Mechanism, Inner Minister.**

**Grand Primordial Supreme Minister,**

To the wardens of the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, the celestial prisons, and the earthly hells:
The duly ordained servant of the Dharma, [Name], reverently seals this twice over.
This register is proclaimed to the netherworld courts, releasing and absolving the karmic offenses of the mortal realm.

The register is inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper, nine inches in height. The accompanying petition is written in large characters with ink on white paper. Both the inner and outer seals are inscribed in cinnabar on blue-green paper and presented after the *Pardon for the Netherworld* chapter at Fengdu.

**Pardon Document Formula:**
On this [day] of the present month, by command of the Jade Dawn Primordial August Sovereign of the Great Dao and the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, in response to the petition of the High Priest [Name], words are arrayed in order.
We beseech the descent of the *Most High Precious Register of the Pardon for Ascension to Heaven*, to illuminate the long night and absolve the sinful souls. Now, by the Most High’s decree, this proclamation is issued.

This register follows the previous format, inscribed in cinnabar on yellow paper. The pardon document is written in ink on yellow silk. Both the inner and outer seals are made of yellow paper, totaling twenty documents:
Nine for the Nine Provinces, ten for the Ten Directions, and one dedicated to the deliverance of the departed souls.
Once the names are recited and the documents burned, all ten thousand sins and thousand transgressions are absolved, and the souls undergo refinement for rebirth.

**Another Method:**
For the universal deliverance of all souls and the lonely spirits of the Six Paths, use yellow paper nine inches long and three inches wide. Inscribe the *Precious Register of the Pardon for Ascension to Heaven* as before, with a separate petition written in five columns. Issue as many copies as needed according to the number of names, following the refinement method of the Supreme Ultimate Immortal Elder.

**Memorandum Formula:**
*Grand Primordial Ministry.*

**Memorandum to He Duchengzi, Intendant of the Nine Dark Realms, for Imperial Decree Compliance:**

By this memorandum, the Ministry receives the August Emperor’s edict.

The four great illusions shape the fleshly body—how could it not perish? The primal unity gathers the confluence of form and qi—nothing surpasses the love of life. Thus, though the celestial patterns revolve in clarity, the benighted fail to bathe in the imperial wind’s grace. The Dark Capital’s black soil warns those who turn from rectitude toward depravity, while the Purple Tenuity of the Upper Palace awaits those who transcend the mundane to enter sageliness. Boundaries differ by nature, and paths diverge in error. Racing like a galloping horse after the monkey-mind, the seven emotions never return; drowning in the river of love, one sinks into the sea of suffering, depths plumbed for ten thousand kalpas. Such multitudes—how dim their plight! The thirty-six divisions of scriptural canons illuminate like lamps in a dark chamber; the hundred-twenty bureaus of office administer with the precision of a ruler’s measure. All serve to benefit beings, planting the seeds of goodness.

Now, the ordained [Name], having submitted a petition for this rite, hereby sponsors both kin and unrelated souls of past lives, aspiring to deliver the ten directions and universally aid the six paths. In repaying roots and returning to origins, one knows to serve Heaven with sincerity; in extending kindness to all, it is fitting to elevate these spirits as well. Thus, registers and talismans are issued to manifest grand favor and pacification.

**Exceptions:** Those who have offended Heaven, destroyed the Dao, betrayed their lord, or rebelled against kin shall not be pardoned.

**All others—whether in water or on land, manifest or hidden, old or recent, great or small—shall, in accordance with the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree, receive graded reductions or full pardons as follows:**

1. The souls specifically sponsored by the Ritual Officer [Name], who in life harbored wayward thoughts or committed errors in conduct, shall, by this decree, be promoted at once.
2. The souls jointly sponsored by the Ritual Officer [Name], having already benefited from repeated pardons and bearing no remaining offenses, shall, by this decree, be further elevated in immortal rank.
3. The ancestral kin sponsored by the Ritual Officer [Name], from great-grandparents down to nephews, including those who died without liberation or were reborn only to relapse into transmigration, shall, by this decree, be assessed and delivered to ascension.
4. All male and female souls universally delivered at the altar by the Ritual Officer [Name], regardless of distance, shall, by this decree, be pardoned of sins and reborn.
5. Those who abused power to harm others, provoked conflicts to kill the innocent, plundered wealth, poisoned with drugs, or violated human ethics by defiling the six relations shall, by this decree, receive a one-grade reduction in punishment.
6. Those who offended the Three Luminaries, cursed wind and rain, wantonly took lives, schemed in secret, harmed others, executed punishments unjustly, disobeyed their masters, killed without cause, or owed lives for debts shall, by this decree, have their offenses assessed for pardon or reduction.
7. All souls who died unjustly—whether by state law, celestial statutes, battle, drowning, falls, plagues, venom, childbirth, suicide, swallowing, contagion, terror, mutilation, bloodshed, or other incomplete forms—along with all other categories, named or unnamed, claimed or unclaimed, currently suffering in the lower realms, shall, by this decree, be released and delivered according to their station.
8. All flying, walking, or hidden creatures that were once human but have fallen into transmigration without regaining their true form shall, by this decree, be assessed and transformed.
9. Those in mountains, forests, or dusty caves who practiced the Dao, refined their forms, used talismans, medicines, or stones to save others, yet died before completing their merit shall, by this decree, be reported by their respective authorities for special ascension.
10. Loyal ministers, filial children, and deities of village shrines, mountain forests, or sacrificial temples who answered the people’s prayers and protected their blessings shall, by this decree, be permitted to have their cases reviewed for promotion.
11. All divine generals, officials, soldiers, and functionaries—including local earth gods—who served in the Yellow Register altars or assisted in ritual affairs, as well as those in the middle and lower realms assigned to bureaus, shall, by this decree, receive promotions.
12. All other offenses committed before dawn on the [day] of this month, whether discovered or not, adjudicated or not, are hereby pardoned.

Alas! The records of High Heaven are not silent—how could they fail to respond to the sins of the lower people? Let all take heed and fulfill their duties with care, for great responsibility accompanies this amnesty. Upon receipt of this decree, the authorities shall act accordingly.

**Memorandum:** The edict having arrived as above, make copies and distribute them to all relevant offices for immediate compliance. Those who disobey this command shall be judged by law.

**Memorandum issued.**

The Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau.

**Memorandum to the Nine Dark Realms’ Administrators and Prefect Qiao Youwen of the Edict Chancellery:**

To govern and nurture the multitudes of form, to extend the great foundation beyond kalpas—whether in the sunlit or shadowed realms, life and death lie under the sway of inexorable law. Among all beings, humans are most noble. Though endowed at birth with good and virtuous nature, they may yet allow their minds to drift toward brutishness. Pursuing the six passions, they accumulate the three karmic deeds; a single misguided thought may plunge them into the Nine Dark Realms. Heaven’s net is vast, its statutes stern. There they languish in evil prisons, bound in dark dungeons—unreached by pardon, untouched by mercy.

To manifest the Way of reward and punishment, We now bestow the virtue of deliverance. Extending the proclamation of the Great Teaching, We pity the multitudes mired in suffering. Without demotion or elevation, how could the work of creation be made manifest? We confer command upon the Mystery Capital, apportioning tokens to the local bureaus. Let all spirits heed with reverence, and let the responsible officers carry this out.

Accordingly, this Bureau, on the petition of High Merit Officer [Name], acting on behalf of Ritual Master [Name], reports the establishment of the Nine Dark Realms Grand Offering for Ascension, wherein Yang and Yin purification rites are performed to widely promote good fortune and universally deliver the submerged and lost. We humbly beseech Heaven’s grace to bestow deliverance from below.

**Memorandum of Edict Petition:**
By command of the Three Heavens’ Chancellery:

Great virtue arises from cherishing life, and so We broaden the grace that washes away transgressions. Sincerity can serve the Divine; thus We heed the plea to aid the multitudes. We issue this decree of magnanimity, spreading the radiant favor of imperial benevolence. Tokens are conferred upon local bureaus, and the morning stars all receive grace. Proclaim this first, and record it for posterity.

1. This amnesty applies from dawn of the [day] of this month backward. Excluded are those who have blasphemed Heaven or slandered the Sages, violated laws or statutes, rebelled against the Dao or disrupted order, or plotted murder—crimes so heinous that even the law cannot pardon them. All other offenses, whether already adjudicated or not, discovered or not, suffered or not, reported or not, shall, in accordance with the Primordial Mandate, be universally pardoned.

2. In all places where prisoners are held, those who have long endured severe punishment and sunk into evil destinies, though touched by grace, have not yet been cleansed by pardon. If they can repent and reform, turning from evil toward good, regardless of the weight of their sins, by this edict they shall be permitted to receive rebirth according to their rank.

3. To the Five Peaks and Great Rivers, the Nine Dark Realms’ Capital, the City Gods and Earth Deities, the Springs and Rivers’ Sources, all wild and desolate places, strange paths and foreign lands, the wandering lost souls, the countless lonely spirits, the nine schools and hundred clans, the four births and five destinies, those in the Blood Lake of sins, those who died untimely or by violence, the unsheltered and indescribable, those drifting in illusory regret or drowned in the River of Desire, those trapped in endless cycles—by this mandate, all shall be delivered and ascended.

4. In the thorny prisons of the Yang world, the judicial bureaus of prefectures and counties, the market and military offices, the battlefields and frontier forts—wherever the multitudes have been bound and executed, their cases concluded or not, where they have suffered punishment or perished in war, lingering unliberated—by this edict, all shall be granted deliverance.

5. To all wandering spirits, the Five Penetrations, and the beings of the wilds who rely on grasses and trees to disturb living beings, or who falsely claim to be demons seeking blood sacrifices, thus violating Heaven’s law and being seized by the Mysterious Bureau—if they acknowledge their faults and repent, they shall be pardoned according to the circumstances and released. Furthermore, let the local earth deities and spirit officials proclaim this, guiding them back to the correct path to await favor and pacification.

6. To all sacred altars and temples, the blood-offering deities who protect the people, uphold the land, expand the mountains and rivers, govern their sources, display meritorious deeds, and respond to the people’s prayers—by this edict, let each jurisdiction recommend them for reward according to precedent.

7. To all recluses in mountain forests, caves, and secluded valleys who seek the Dao, visit masters, cultivate truth, refine their nature, deliver the lost, aid the suffering, relieve the poor, align with Heaven’s will, and respond to human needs—including those of loyal, filial, brave, and benevolent character, who have widely accumulated hidden merit and are revered by all—though they may have lived long lives, if they have not yet ascended to the immortal realms, by this edict, let their affiliated offices thoroughly investigate and promptly submit their names for promotion according to the regulations.

8. To all who have diligently cultivated the Yellow Register rites and widely aided the boundless—let the Three Realms’ inspecting officials and the Yellow Register Bureau’s ascension officers record their merits, promote them through proper recommendation, and extend this grace to their ancestors, inner and outer clans, collateral relatives, and even unrelated departed spirits. All shall equally receive imperial favor and ascend to the Dao’s realm, unbound by earthly barriers, climbing the perilous immortal ranks.

9. To all generals and commanders serving at altars, officials performing their duties, and those guarding ritual altars and assisting the Dao’s teachings—who have received divine commissions and established merit in their tasks—let them be promoted one rank according to the Mysterious Statutes.

10. To all officials of the Three Origins and Nine Bureaus, the Five Peaks and Four Offices, Fengdu and the Nine Dark Realms, and those below the Springs’ Shoulders who oversee life, death, and criminal records, or who administer punishments—along with City Gods, Earth Deities, local earth officials, and the spirits of the earthly courier routes—let each be advanced one rank according to the Jade Regulations.

11. For all matters not fully enumerated in this amnesty, or where names and categories are too numerous, or where the law provides no clear precedent, let them be handled by analogy and released accordingly.

12. In all underworld bureaus, if any dare to reopen cases from before this amnesty to detain the departed, they shall be punished for their crimes.

Alas! Proclaiming the imperial mandate under Heaven’s light, all who are moved shall be reached. Blocking the gates of death and opening the doors of life, none shall remain undelivered.

Upon receipt of this amnesty, the responsible officers shall act accordingly.

**Memorandum:**
The edict having arrived as above, let the Nine Dark Realms’ Administrators swiftly make copies and distribute them to all relevant offices for immediate compliance.

**Memorandum.**

In the year of the Great Year Star, [year], [month], [day].
Officially submitted by the Dharma-ranked minister [surname] [given name], in accordance with the decree.

Enumerating the Eight Ministers of the Celestial Province:
The two characters of the imperial amnesty—
**Jade Clarity Supreme Lord** grants boundless deliverance;
**High Clarity Great Emperor** absolves enmity and grievance;
**Supreme Clarity Great Emperor** universally liberates the depths of the Yellow Springs;
**Jade Emperor Supreme Lord** pardons all transgressions and judgments.

The edicts of the myriad heavens descend—Mount Luo’s bonds are severed;
The Three Paths, Five Sufferings, Nine Dark Realms, and Feng Springs are all released, their karmic entanglements dissolved.

*Swiftly, as the Jade Clarity Supreme Lord decrees:*
Homeless wandering souls ascend to the Three Heavens;
All grievances and karmic knots are universally dissolved.
Boundless deliverance extends to the deepest yin, matching Heaven’s own span.

To the left, the sunken and fallen yin souls of men and women are pardoned;
To the right, the frozen citadels are opened, their gates proclaimed.
The icy citadels, furnaces, and snowy prisons of the Yellow Springs—
The sunlight’s radiance shatters their darkness, and all hasten to the Ten Heavens.

Those with merit and destiny ascend to the Three Heavens;
Those with wickedness and rebellion are pardoned by decree.
At this hour of the imperial command, they are raised and transferred—
From the Northern Capital’s Cold Pool, the guardians of forms and souls,
To the demon-subduing promotions and the ranks of deliverance in the Southern Palace’s Ten Heavens.

The edict of the Ten Heavens is proclaimed:
The winds and fires of the dark passes cease;
The furnaces of torment are stilled, their smoke extinguished.
None shall violate this decree.
The underworld bureaus shall act in unison, in accordance with the edict, to transfer the spirits.

*Swiftly, as the Primordial Supreme Lord decrees.*

The three palace talismans having been recited, the noon script issued, the brush laid down,
The Ten Heavens’ talisman is invoked, and the amnesty is reverently presented.

**Amnesty Document**
Memorandum of the Supreme Mystery Capital Province.

This province, in receipt of the vermilion-script decree from the Second Heavenly Gate,
In accordance with the memorial of the High Merit Master [name], submitted for the intended purpose,
Now acts by imperial mandate to execute Heaven’s will.

**Written Talisman:**
The Dao’s primordial talisman of command,
Transmitted since the Dragon Han kalpa,
Conceals its hidden rhymes and secret script.
From the Floating Black Heaven, it grants deliverance—
Restoring bones to life, transforming white skeletons into beings,
Refining qi to preserve the true,
Inscribing cinnabar characters in ordered ranks.

Yet from the suffering of sinking and drowning,
Clinging to worldly entanglements,
The clarity of stillness is gradually submerged into a sea of karma.
Through a thousand births and ten thousand deaths,
They endure retribution in the yin passes;
Across the ten lands and nine springs,
The long night remains unbroken.

Thus, the True Bureau’s memorials are submitted,
Praying for the universal bestowal of grace.
The Dao’s utmost compassion, deeply moved by pity,
Deems the petition fitting—
This amnesty is granted to demonstrate its vast benevolence.

Let this amnesty be proclaimed throughout Fengdu,
Where all deceased transgressors—
Whether they offended by violating heaven or betraying earth,
By failing in filial piety or loyalty,
By lacking benevolence or righteousness,
By intentional killing or accidental harm,
Or by the sins of the six passions and six desires—
Shall, regardless of severity, have their offenses absolved and expunged.
In accordance with the talismanic decree,
They shall depart the dark yin realms
And ascend to the realms of blessedness.

All sinful souls in the Nine Springs,
Suffering beings in the Three Wretched Paths,
Those who defied heaven or blasphemed the sacred,
Who erred through ignorance or willful wrong,
Who served as disloyal ministers or unfilial children,
Who wantonly took lives or secretly harmed others—
Their crimes, whether grave or slight,
Whether exposed or concealed,
Whether adjudicated or unresolved,
Are hereby pardoned and erased.

All other beings across the Six Paths and Four Modes of Birth,
All wandering, masterless souls,
Shall follow the verdant ascent to deliverance,
Seize fortune and rebirth,
Have their enmities dissolved,
And forever partake in ease and joy.

The attending spirit-officials, ritual overseers,
Minor functionaries, direct talisman-bearers, and duty clerks
Shall each be promoted one rank in nobility.
The wardens of Fengdu’s eternal night,
The Ox-Head jailers,
All great ghost-kings,
The Nine Yin Bureaus,
City gods and village altars,
And all officials and generals presently in service
Shall each advance one grade in rank.

Henceforth, whenever Yellow Register Grand Fasts are held
To deliver the suffering of the netherworld,
Let this decree descend and be enacted as it is today.
Let the amnesty circulate through the celestial realms,
Pervading the deepest springs.
Let none dare to raise matters predating this pardon—
Those who would punish the bearers of such sins
Shall themselves be subject to its enforcement.

Alas!
The numinous power of the Great Dao
Manifests through the divine and luminous.
Its utmost benevolence and virtue
Shall universally bathe even the darkest depths.
All sentient beings
Receive this primal bestowal—
Let none grow complacent
And thus incur reproach.

Let it be enacted.
Memorial received.

Let the amnesty decree proceed as before, and let Fengdu swiftly circulate and enact it in full. Furthermore, notify all subordinate offices accordingly. Upon receipt of this document, act in accordance with the imperial command.

**Decree issued.**
In the year of the Tai Sui, on the ___ day of the ___ month.

By the authority of the Dharma,
Minister [Name] receives and executes the edict.

**[List of Eight Celestial Offices]**

**Seal Formula:**
*Memorial of the Supreme Mystery Capital Province*
*To the Nine Dark Realms’ Administrators*

**Imperial Edict**
*From the Supreme Mystery Capital Province*
*To the Chancellery.*

Where doubt arises in matters of guilt, err on the side of leniency; where doubt arises in matters of merit, err on the side of generosity. Since the era of the ancient sovereigns, those who instructed the judicial officers took Yu Shun’s compassion as their model and embraced Gao Yao’s transcendent virtue. They held human life in the highest regard and wielded punishment with profound wisdom. When the people harmonized with the mean, governance naturally followed.

You, the officials and commoners who serve in the earthly bureaus, are summoned to assemble the ministers of the two or three ranks to adjudicate cases great and small. Yet even so, one fears that instructions may not have been clearly imparted, that old and new precedents may conflict, that the weight of punitive authority may be applied, and that the transformative power of life-bestowing virtue may remain unfathomed. Therefore, let all be granted amnesty, that renewal may be achieved. May those gathered before the palace gates hear the essentials of the Dao and its virtue.

You who uphold the law, embody my utmost intent. Let this edict be made known to all, that they may take heed.

In accordance with the petition of [Name], it is deeply feared that the departed souls, during their time among the living, accumulated transgressions, and after death, must now be bound in the dark night of the underworld. Though they have repeatedly been offered deliverance, it is feared they have not yet attained liberation. Therefore:

**One:** Perform the primary rite of deliverance for [Name].
**One:** Perform the supplementary rite of deliverance for [Name] and others.

**One:** Universally deliver the orphaned souls of the Five Clans, the multitudes of fallen officers and soldiers, the three *hun* and seven *po* of men, and the three *hun* and fourteen *po* of women. Proclaim this to the Court of Judgment.

By imperial decree, let all bureaus under the Three Realms responsible for examining and sentencing sinful souls now remit their offenses and swiftly dispatch the aforementioned departed souls of [Name] and others. By the [day] of this month, let them come before the altar to behold the Merciful Venerable One and personally receive liberation.

For the Primordial Celestial Worthy’s merit in delivering humanity is vast, and the winds and fires cease not. As decreed, this document is issued in accordance with the proper form.

**Document issued.**
In the year of *Tai Sui* [Year], [Month], [Day], [Hour], proclaimed.

**Dharma Position:** [Rank] Minister [Surname] [Name], in receipt of the edict, hereby executes the decree.
**Seal:** Minister of the Three Heavens, Upholder of the Dao, Orthodox Unity, Serene and Responsive Perfected Lord.
**Format:** Document of the Supreme Mystery Capital Bureau.

**To the Masters of Fengdu.**

The two documents—the Imperial Edict and the Amnesty Edict—are not recorded in the liturgical canons but were later composed by practitioners. Since they have long circulated among the various schools, they shall not be expunged but preserved as is. When employed, the preliminary announcement should be issued first, followed by the Amnesty Edict at the appointed time, to be proclaimed simultaneously with the imperial pardon.

Both the Edict and Amnesty shall be inscribed on large yellow paper in bold script. Characters, talismanic commands, seal scripts, and vermilion inscriptions within shall be accompanied by documents such as the *Petition for Amnesty*, *Dispatch for Amnesty*, and *Transmission of Amnesty*, as detailed in the *Chapter on Memorials and Memorialized Petitions*.

**The Nine-Dragon Mandate of the Eastern Ultimate Azure Mystery for Salvation from Suffering**

**The Master says:**
This text is the sagacious decree of the Supreme Heavenly Venerable, a sacred writ for absolving sins and delivering the afflicted.

**For all proclamations:**
Use yellow silk, nine inches in height, and inscribe the talisman in cinnabar. Seal the outer envelope with a permeable cover, also written in cinnabar on yellow silk.

**Another method:**
Use a catalpa wood tablet, nine inches in height, three inches and six fen in width, and three fen in thickness. Bind its head with azure, inscribe the talisman on the front, and write the proclamation on the reverse. Encase it in an azure paper cover, or use green silk with cinnabar script, sealing it as prescribed.

**The Rite states:**
When inscribing the talisman, face east in a purified space. Burn incense, bow nine times, and kneel to memorialize. Visualize the Supreme Unity enthroned within the Hundred Treasures Auspicious Light Palace of the Azure Palace, enveloped in nine-colored clouds and crimson plumes, adorned with azure floral dragon patterns. Upon His head rests the Jade Purity Treasure Crown. He rides a five-colored, nine-headed lion, which bears a seven-colored golden lotus throne. Flames issue from the lion’s mouth, filling the expanse, while the Supreme Unity manifests amidst the fire, radiating a nine-colored halo like a rainbow. A luminous orb crowns His head, resembling a sacred disk, and the white light of His brow shines like the blade of a sword.

Beneath the throne bloom two smaller lotuses, upon which the Supreme Unity’s feet rest. In His left hand, He holds a jade-green crystal treasure bell shaped like a tripod; in His right, a branch of malachite flowers. His form is golden, His countenance jade, His eyes filled with compassion and wisdom. To His left stands the Great Wisdom Perfected One; to His right, the Savior from Suffering Perfected One, attended by retinues. Vajra spirit-kings, celestial warriors, golden youths, jade maidens, and divine officials stand in attendance. The eighty-one divine lords of the Supreme Unity, along with the officers and soldiers of the Five Directions’ Supreme Unity, all serve as guardians.

The practitioner visualizes this clearly amidst the five-colored clouds, then silently memorializes the intent. Recite the sagacious title of the Supreme Unity eighty-one times. Envision the Supreme Unity commanding the Perfected Ones at His left and right to open the Nine-Light Treasure Repository of the Purple Yang Jade Casket, revealing dragon-script and phoenix-sigils to the practitioner. He also decrees the descent of the Nine-Dragon Messengers to accompany the practitioner.

After receiving the talisman, bow nine times. Visualize the Supreme Unity sprinkling sweet dew across the ten directions. For a long moment, heaven and earth shine with the radiance of a hundred treasures, and the practitioner’s form dissolves into emptiness. Then, dip the cinnabar brush, recite the Supreme Unity’s title nine times, and draw the eastern *qi* into the brush to inscribe the talisman. Upon completion, recite the sagacious title nine more times, make the Jade Purity mudra, and draw the eastern *qi* into the talisman.

Next, beneath the Heavenly Venerable’s title and rank on the proclamation, inscribe the Azure Mystery True Form Talisman for Shattering Fengdu. Recite the dispersal incantation over it. Then recite the titles of the Heavenly Venerables of the Ten Directions, nine times each—ninety recitations in total—and draw the ten *qi* to blow upon it. Recite the sagacious title nine more times, then draw the eastern *qi* to blow upon the incense, and dispatch the decree.

If proclaiming before the altar, follow the same visualization and descent procedures. Read the proclamation aloud, burn it, and invoke the Nine-Dragon Messengers to accompany the talisman on its journey.

**Primordial Beginning’s Talismanic Mandate, Golden Register’s White Document, Longevity and Salvation-from-Suffering Talismans**

The Master says: In the heavens of the Three Clarities abides the Primordial Alliance’s True Jade Casket. Now the jade document’s Salvation-from-Suffering True Talisman is the Primordial Beginning’s majestic decree, the Thearch’s gracious favor. Truly it is the medicinal remedy for rescuing the drowned, the awakening resonance for enlightening the benighted, the purifying rain for bathing body and mind, the sheltering clouds for covering all spirits, the illuminating torch for dispelling dark obscurity, the gateway for drawing forth the deceased.

Originally, when the Northern Thearch first presented it and the Void Sovereign expounded the teaching, the imperial grace bent low to broadly deliver those in the ceaseless hells. Summoning the concord of the Ten Heavens, it shattered the numinous script of the Nine Earths. Those who receive it swiftly emerge from the gloomy thoroughfare and immediately ascend to the celestial vastness. Those who uphold it restore their bones to life and are appointed as Perfected Ones. It delivers from the three disasters and nine calamities of the mortal world, eradicates a thousand sins and ten thousand karmic deeds in the Northern Capital—how could this be called a small benefit?

The Jade Strategy states: All beings inherit from the ancestral Great Origin; their numinous source is pure. From the void they receive qi, form their bodies, and accept spirit. Though they witness the dawn’s radiance, they cannot esteem themselves. Qi clings to things and falsely stirs worldly emotions. Spirits and ghosts scheme, the heart labors daily in folly, qi withers and spirit departs, making return to the original state difficult. The five encumbrances entangle them, and they suffer poison in the dark earth. Some dwell in the Five Marchmounts and great rivers, the Nine Springs’ capital courts, city gods’ temples, or the Yellow Springs’ river sources. Some rely on orphaned shade or cling to perverse objects, wandering in wild seclusion, attaching to shamans to stir demonic forces, grasping deluded thoughts, oblivious to past lives. Circumstances and karma confront them; form changes and spirit transmigrates. Heart and form unite, endlessly cycling—how vast is the human path, yet thus do they impoverish themselves.

The Supreme Thearch’s mercy is sevenfold, ever skillfully rescuing beings. He issues talismans to the hidden courts, extending grace at dawn. He stills the branding fires of the mountain of flames and releases the burden of past lives. The imperial waves bend low, refining and returning the person.

The August One says: When a person sinks into death, it is the doing of the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, governed by the Five Phases’ movements, thus entering the gate of the Five Sufferings’ wheel. Therefore, the Great Unity first casts the light of the Three Realms to shatter the Nine Dark Prisons. He inscribes the boundaries of the Nine Stars to purge corpse-filth. When the five viscera’s inner illumination shines like the sun, yin and yang return their hun and po.

Thus, he writes the qi of the Yang-Corpse Nether Performance, then arrays the stars of the Eight Trigrams. The numinous images divide forms; the Two Modes harmonize; the Three Qi flow and circulate to stabilize the Three Fields. The heart governs the Kan Rooster, ascending to pay homage to the Three Clarities. Then the Nine Palaces array, true qi fills and overflows, the myriad spirits respectfully listen, the Nine Darks crumble and collapse. Qi unites as one, returning the corpse to life—thus the writ is inscribed.

The August One says: When yin spirits, deluded and bound to the Three Wretched Paths, receive the Dao’s grace and are delivered, they must obtain the Elixir Heaven’s refining-form talisman to transform and generate precious radiance, transcending to the Yang Brightness’ realm. Cultivators should refine and borrow the light of the Two Unity Fields to connect with the Nine Heavens’ boundaries. Thus, yin relies on true yang, spirit unites with the Great Perfection, the turning wheel does not perish, and they attain immortality.

It is also said: When sinful souls are confined, all are under the Northern Dipper’s jurisdiction. Therefore, he writes the Primordial Upper Seven Origins and Nine Darks characters, blows the Three Lights’ qi to illuminate the Ten Directions, and the Three Terraces shine resplendently. Thus, he writes the numinous images’ light to illuminate the Eight Prisons. The Five Marchmounts’ Five Thearchs and the Great Spirits Who Oversee Life mobilize their numinosity. Next, he writes the concord of the sun and moon’s brightness, where the Three Lights shine. The Purple Tally marks their names; the Thearch holds the talisman to deliver their lives to the Flowery Court of Mount Tai. The Heavenly Origin’s qi pours into the Southern Dipper. The Three Officials receive the decree; beneath the Nine Earths, within the Nine Waters, in the Nine Yin’s realms—all behold the light.

The Master says: Without the profound covenant and wearing this numinous script while pure in the Nine Precepts, one may not proclaim the Salvation-from-Suffering Talisman. For dedicated deliverance, without the Seven Virtues and Nine Meritorious Deeds of a cultivator of the Perfected, one may not proclaim the Longevity Talisman. This is not a lapse in compassionate teaching but rather that the many sinful lower ghosts cannot presume upon imperial grace. This is like a prisoner in hell obtaining a false pardon, only to mislead the netherworld. Moreover, without loyalty, filial piety, integrity, health, benevolence, and compassion—without merit benefiting others—there is no standard for ascending to the Southern Palace. Though one may proclaim to the Earth Bureau, they only hold the white document and undergo transformation according to their karma. Without relying on the power of the Three Treasures, this document’s efficacy is not universal.

The Master says: Having already worn the Nine-Dragon Talisman’s precepts, you should align your heart with the Southern Prosperity’s Refining Perfection Register—this is the Longevity Talisman. It is the Highest Numinous Tally, the Purple Tenuity’s Treasure Script. Refine the document’s cinnabar script; luminous rosy clouds gather and condense. The spirit-light shines and scatters, summoning and descending the dawn’s radiance, preserving and refining the cinnabar heart, nurturing the red child.

For all recipients: choose an auspicious day in a yang month, prepare azure silk nine inches in height and two inches and five fen in width, and inscribe the talisman in cinnabar. Once the talisman is complete, arrange eight stacked altars, and with a square pouch one cun in size, suspend and wear it over the heart.

Each day after burning incense, step outside and face east. If encountering wind, rain, or darkness, proceed in a quiet place of rest. Collect your heart and empty your form, face east in a circular array, and draw in the red mist through the nose, permeating the entire body and the Three Palaces above and below. Not a speck of dust arises; maintain this focus for a long while. Then knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and softly recite the incantation:

*"The Controller of Destiny receives refinement,
The Ministerial Fire forms the Firmament.
The Ridgepole governs as Heaven’s Steward,
Penetrating perception responds to the blazing light.
Pivotal mechanisms assist and support,
Stars array in the mysterious script.
Nurturing essence, the Great Brightness,
The Red Script radiates brilliance.
Refining and transforming the spirit-tally,
Both inner and outer flourish.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees."*

After the incantation, knock the teeth three more times and swallow saliva three times to conclude. Practicing thus for three years, then applying the superior method, one will no longer suffer from fierce winds or hurricanes, and can master the inverted radiance of dawn’s glow, traverse the Purple Void, gaze upon the lofty clarity of spring, and walk the Jade Capital.

The Jade Tally states: "Yang months" refer to the six yang months—*zi, yin, chen, wu, shen,* and *xu*. "Auspicious days" refer to the yang days of *jia*. The "superior method" refers to the various methods above; one must first practice the tally for three years before undertaking the wearing of talismans, the salutation of the dawn’s radiance, and the burning of incense. "Stepping outside" means exiting the courtyard to perform the ritual, not following the *chao zhen* protocol of exiting through the *xun* gate. "Azure silk" must be bright and pure, not referring to white as plain; as in Daoist usage, *zi, qing,* and *jiang* are called the Three Purities.

The Jade Tally says: Those in the world who relieve the poor and destitute, deliver beings across heaven and earth, uphold precepts and cultivate harmony, and make offerings to the Three Treasures; or those who refine the true and nurture the spirit, yet whose merit remains insufficient when meeting their end and passing through the Great Yin—only these may petition for clemency, invoke the Talisman of Salvation from Suffering, then the Longevity Spirit-Tally, present the tally in the Imperial Hall, and refine the spirit in the Fire Palace. If sinful souls have no merit before heaven and earth, they may not recklessly receive the register of true refinement. Even to glimpse the divine radiance and be reborn in the yang realm is already fortunate.

It further states: If universally performing rites for the lonely souls of the Nine Dark Regions and the countless ancestors of the lineage, or conducting grand offerings to heaven and earth and returning to the command of the Mysterious True, the master should memorialize the Three Realms, report to the Mysterious Master, and notify the Earth Bureau before invoking the talisman.

The method states: For all deliverance rites, use *xiang* wood to make the tally, nine *cun* in length, two *cun* and four *fen* in width, and two *fen* in thickness. The Jade Tally says: two *cun* and five *fen* in width, four *fen* in thickness. *Xiang* wood is chosen for its fragrance, purity, and whiteness, symbolizing the image of living *qi*. The Jade Tally uses *zi* wood for the Talisman of Salvation from Suffering and *bai* wood for the Longevity Talisman. The nine-*cun* length derives from the Nine Dark Springs, ascending to heaven by riding the nine yang and nine *qi*. The width of two *cun* and four *fen* symbolizes the *qi* of the Three Divisions, Eight Sceneries, and Twenty-Four Spirits. The thickness of two *fen* embodies the complete balance of yin and yang, the principle of heaven and earth’s creation. The measurements should use the ancient jade ruler; compared to today’s *shuan* ruler, each *cun* should be increased by two *fen*.

The decree states: When inscribing the talisman, first burn incense in the oratory, present offerings, and sincerely recite the hidden chapters. Place the tally on the incense table facing east, then face northwest, kneel, and memorialize the Primordial Venerable. Visualize the Jade Form riding a five-colored lion, a hundred-jeweled golden terrace, and a lotus pedestal, externally radiating golden light, mouth emitting auspicious *qi*, descending into the cinnabar and onto the tally wood. Then rise, face east, form the *zhen* mudra, and recite the incantation:

*"Jade born of Long Sang,
Wu Kong ascends as immortal.
Cinnabar brilliance illuminates the wood,
Delivering souls to ascend heaven.
Black reflects the white tally,
Golden light arises naturally.
Eternally preserved,
Pacifying the cold springs.
Opening deliverance for lonely souls,
Eternally safeguarding the kalpas.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Sovereign’s statutes and decrees."*

After the incantation, draw in nine breaths of living *qi*, visualize them as sunlight, and blow them onto the tally. If many tallies are being delivered, stack them on the table, and as before, draw eighty-one breaths of *qi* and blow them onto the tallies. Visualize the sunlight pervading boundlessly, then dip the brush in cinnabar, form the Jade Clarity mudra, silently recite the Three Heavens’ hidden taboos, and invoke the clarity of *Hong Chengming* in heaven, earth, and humanity. Begin writing according to the dispersed form.

The decree states: When inscribing the Longevity Talisman, the protocol for memorializing is as above. However, choose a *jia* day or *yin* day, expose the inscribed tally overnight to invite descent and visitation before use.

The oral formula states:
*"Wood-head and metal-head auspicious,
Golden dragon delivers and benefits all.
Cinnabar light, fire’s dual motion,
Exposed overnight, piercing the spirit peak."*

"Wood-head" refers to *jia*; "metal-head" refers to *geng*. Thus, the *geng-chen* day is optimal.

The Jade Tally states: Inscribe the talisman on the front and the memorial text on the back, arranged in five rows. Older versions had six rows, the sixth being the memorial for the *shanghuang jia-shen* year’s cyclical movement, akin to today’s notation of the year’s *jia-zi* cycle. To follow the older version, include the year and month in six rows. However, as the celestial script lacks cyclical characters, and one dare not recklessly mix secular writing with the true brush, alternatively, shift the year and month to a single row below the memorial, written on the blue paper seal of the tally’s back. Use the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree to notify the ten directions of the boundless worlds, inscribed in two rows on the left and right of the address.

The method states: If the number of tallies for universal deliverance is too great to inscribe in time, use gold or silver leaf to create a stencil board of the talismanic script. According to the method, visualize and dip the brush, then apply the cinnabar through the stencil onto the white tally, ensuring efficiency and preventing exhaustion of spirit and mind. If like-minded practitioners can collaborate in inscribing, enduring labor to achieve the merit of deliverance, this surpasses the use of stencil boards. If even this is not feasible, carve the talismanic script into a printing block, use thin white paper, apply cinnabar to print, and paste it onto the tally.

Next, according to the method, visualize and dip the brush, then trace the talismanic apertures while reciting the incantation to infuse them with color—this may also serve as a substitute for manual inscription. If one carelessly prints and produces them without adhering to proper practice, such efforts are in vain.

The *Jade Register* states: For all those whose souls are granted special pardons or who receive the Longevity Spirit Talisman, one must seek the Celestial Seal to inscribe the names of the deceased. If delivering three or more individuals, write one representative name on the tally, while listing the remaining names in the petition to the Underworld Bureau—this document may use standard script of the mundane world. However, the Celestial Seal on the tally must not be arbitrarily replaced with ordinary writing, for it possesses a unique system of its own.

According to the *True Reports*, the Lady Wang of Purple Tenuity responded to Yang Siming’s inquiry on writing: "I shall explain the foundation of script. The Three Origins and Eight Convergences script was originally employed by the august Perfected Ones of the Supreme Ultimate and the pure immortals. The Cloud Seal and Radiant Light chapters—these are the characters seen in the talismanic writings of spirits and deities today. In the degenerate age of the later Hua dynasty, crafty and superficial practices arose, leading to the adoption of vulgar, corrupted, and licentious scripts. Abandoning the root to imitate the false is but the clamor of filth and the path to death. Why would a true immortal discard the original, orthodox script to wield such debased and disorderly characters?"

The forty-seven characters within the Longevity Talisman, along with the two talismanic proclamations, were originally said to be the Radiant Light chapters. Later generations, unaware of the distinction in the use of true script, directly substituted mundane writing—thus defiling the pristine elegance of the Perfected Ones’ script above and violating the prohibitions of the established forms below. Henceforth, one must consult the divine compositions recorded in the scriptures to verify the original seals.

The proclamation of the Salvation from Suffering Talisman now comprises ninety-eight characters, with seven additional characters to inscribe the name of the deceased. Each line contains twenty-one seal characters, arranged in five rows. The proclamation of the Longevity Talisman likewise comprises ninety-eight characters, with seven added to inscribe the name of the deceased. Each line contains twenty-two seal characters, arranged in five rows.

When recording the year and cyclical signs, the character *wei* (维) must not be used; such forms should be avoided, for in cases of extreme yin, its use resembles the imperial edicts of special pardons. No name of the deceased on the tally should exceed six characters. Exercise caution.

**Talismans of the Jiao-Dragon and Metal-Dragon Courier-Officials**

**The Master Speaks:**
The Terrace of Supreme Mystery’s Jiao-Dragon Courier-Officials number one hundred twenty thousand, charged with transmitting decrees through the Springs of Crooked Waters and illuminating to absolve sins. For every *Salvation-from-Suffering* talisman issued, one courier is dispatched to bear it. There are also two hundred fifty thousand Metal-Dragon Courier-Officials, who carry the Jade Emperor’s talismanic decrees to subdue demons and speed celestial missives. For every *Longevity* talisman issued, one courier is likewise dispatched. If both slips are to be conveyed, one must memorialize the Primordial August Jade Emperor, summoning these officials in proportion to the number of talismans issued. Since both couriers serve under the Heavenly Purity Bureau, one should first petition the Cinnabar Heavenly Palace of Primordial Radiance—or jointly petition the Four Sagely Palaces for their descent, which is also permissible. This is because the Heavenly Marshal governs the gathering of souls, while the Protector Sagely aids those submerged in suffering. However, these couriers resemble warriors in form; it is a common error among the laity to depict them as youths.

The scriptures state: If one receives and upholds the Golden Register’s White Slip, the Nine Perfected Wondrous Precepts, the Longevity Spirit-Talisman, the Salvation-from-Suffering True Talisman, the Life-Assessing Youths, the Guardians of Precepts and Might, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Six Offices’ Attendant-Officials, these will naturally follow the talismanic texts to shield and protect the deceased who receive the precepts. If one neglects to employ youths in the purification rites for the slips, this is indeed a lapse in transmission.

The *Jade Memorial* states: When dispatching the Jiao-Dragon and Metal-Dragon couriers, no written warrant is needed—only talisman transmits talisman. Yet, fearing that later disciples may lack depth in the Dao and fail to move the mysterious numina, one may draft a petition. The Duty-Day Merit-Officials should then be dispatched to verify and summon them. Alternatively, one may first summon the couriers with a talisman, then proclaim the Jade Slip, and afterward entrust the petition for their bearing. This method is also valid. The courier-talisman should be inscribed at the end of the petition, before the designated position. Carefully consider and execute this, that the mandate may reach the frigid bureaus.

If employing newly cut mugwort to bind the dragon-couriers in the likeness of warriors, place the talisman within their forms and have them bear the slip-text. A separate memorial should also be prepared, and the purification rites announced in advance. Without memorializing the Supreme Mystery to request the descent of couriers, recklessly issuing decrees is akin to a mortal amnesty—something no minister may arrogate to themselves.

**Talisman for Summoning the Jiao-Dragon Courier-Officials**
*Decree of the Supreme Mystery Terrace of the Great Dao*
Penetrating the Springs’ Yin, wisdom’s light pervades all;
In the darkest night, illumination shines.
Forever severed from the Five Sufferings, the roots of earth are cut.
How dare the Nine Dragons’ talismanic decree not comply?
Striding through the Five Portals, the Three Offices absolve and pardon.
The Jiao-Dragon dispatches its missive—upon arrival, swiftly pursue!
The deceased soul awakens to clarity, their spirit soars.
*Wind-Fire Law-Command, Luofeng swiftly obeys.*

This talisman is written in black on yellow paper. Clasp the Jade Emperor’s mudra, draw the Northern Culmen Star’s light through the nose, and encircle the brush to inscribe it. Visualize and burn it to summon the courier, who will then appear. The Northern Culmen Star is not the sixth star of the Dipper (Military Brilliance) but the Celestial Pivot to the right of the Heavenly Thearch, the North Star’s hub.

**The Master Speaks:**
The radiance of qi varies by kind, with purity and turbidity diverging. When drawing the qi of the Three Luminaries and Five Stars, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth. For the qi of vital clouds and mists, absorb it through the mouth in concert with the flame. During inhalation, ensure no sound reaches the ears—if heard, the qi’s radiance will not descend. Nor should one inhale too deeply, lest breath become labored and rhythm lost. The key lies in focused intent and silent recitation, guiding the qi to merge with spirit in the boundless void. Then, inhalation and intent will naturally summon and descend the qi.

**Summoning Incantation (Right Side)**
Summon one Jiao-Dragon Courier-Official from the Supreme Mystery Terrace to bear the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic decree and the *Salvation-from-Suffering* True Talisman, illuminating to absolve sins, as commanded.

**Talisman for Summoning the Metal-Dragon Courier-Officials**
*Decree of the Supreme Mystery Terrace of the Great Dao*
Piercing the hidden, traversing barriers, golden light illumines all;
The Yellow Springs are radiant, jade eyes refine the form.
The deceased soul, cleansed by the Yellow Flower, ascends through the Three Heavens.
True wind fans the compassionate clouds to embrace the body.
At the first proclamation of the decree, the Metal-Dragon bears the missive.
*Wind and fire intertwine—swiftly obey the law-command!*

This talisman is written in cinnabar on blue-green paper. Clasp the Jade mudra, draw the Supreme Thearch Star’s radiance through the nose, and encircle the brush to inscribe it. Burn and summon as before. When drawing qi, gaze southward: the Supreme Thearch Star lies above the Dipper’s head, between the Lower Terrace and the faint star toward the north. North of the Supreme Thearch are four stars arrayed like a military well; to the south lies the Lesser Brilliance, resembling the Primal Lodge. The Supreme Thearch is yellow and bright—know that it resides south of the Dipper’s *Xuanji* and *Tianxuan* stars. To capture the radiance of the North Star and Supreme Thearch, wait until nightfall when the stars are clear to obtain their true essence.

**Summoning Incantation (Right Side)**

If the talisman is issued first, use this incantation. It is unnecessary for the petition’s header. The petition’s format is detailed in the *Memorials and Memorialized Texts* section.

**Talismanic Scripts for Purification Rites**
**Jade Clarity Precious Register’s True Talisman for Shattering Hell**

The Master said: The *Jade Clarity Precious Register* is the majestic scripture of the Primordial Beginning, issued from the purple courts of the Ninefold Radiance. It is the universal salvific writ of the Numinous Treasure, serving as the covenant of the nether courts and the pact of the underworld officials. For its enactment, use catalpa wood to fashion a tablet, seven *cun*, three *fen*, and a half in length; three *cun* and six *fen* in width; and three *fen* in thickness. Inscribe the talisman on the front and the petition on the reverse, arranged in four lines, with the cyclical year and the ritual position in two lines, totaling six lines. Encase it in a blue paper wrapper, inscribed in vermilion, and present it according to the ritual protocol.

Alternatively, use yellow paper, nine *cun* or one *chi* in height, and two *chi* four *cun* or one *chi* eight *cun* in length. Write the talisman in vermilion and the petition in ink, then enclose it in a yellow paper cover with perforations, inscribed in black. Further encase it in a blue paper box, inscribed in vermilion. At the time of shattering the Nine Hells, invoke its descent, proclaim the petition, and burn it, visualizing its use as prescribed.

The ritual states: First, burn incense and kneel facing the Celestial Gate to present the memorial. The hand gesture is as follows: with the left hand, press the second finger against the base of the thumb, and the thumb against the third joint of the four fingers. Recite the incantation:

*"Most sagely divine beings, perfected as celestial immortals,
Descendants of the Three Sovereigns, grandchildren of the Most High.
Myriad ancestors, suffering souls in the dark abyss,
By the great law of the Heavenly Worthy, ten revolutions return the spirit.
The vermilion writ takes form, proclaimed to the nether springs.
With one descent of the jade script, the iron citadel is shattered.
The talisman’s light blazes forth, resplendent through the deepest shadows.
Blades transform into jeweled trees, swords become forests of *qian* blossoms.
Flaming fires birth lotuses, ice melts and snowy gates dissolve.
The Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties transcend all bounds.
Demon kings and underworld officials bow in reverence, escorting and receiving.
By the mandate of Jade Clarity’s primordial destiny, let it be thus obeyed.
Hasten, hasten, as by the decree of the Primordial Beginning Lord of Heaven!"*

After reciting the incantation once, draw the *qi* of the Celestial Gate into the brush and write, following the dispersed form of the talisman. Then recite the incantation again, exhale a breath of the Celestial Gate’s upright *qi* onto it, and recite once more, drawing a breath of southern *qi* into the talisman. Visualize a myriad *zhang* of golden light, blazing brighter than the sun.

Whenever proclaiming the petition at the altar, invoke its descent as before, visualize its use, recite the dispatch, and burn it in the raging flames.

Dispersed form:
*"Nine Springs’ frigid nights, kalpas of wheel-bound paths,
Gloomy valleys of dark yin—suddenly, radiant light shines.
Illuminating and shattering the Nine Ramparts, who dares disobey?
Reverently following the imperial mandate, vajra forces crush and destroy.
Wind and thunder disperse, fiery veils transform into pools.
The icy depths warm, universally sweeping without exception.
Chariots of fire cease their flames, cauldrons of boiling water halt their cooking.
Bronze pillars collapse, butchery and flaying cease.
By the Primordial Beginning’s decree, the talisman arrives swiftly—summon at once!
Souls depart Fengdu, spirits escape the Iron Enclosure.
Guilty or innocent, hasten to absolve all without exception.
The ten thousand spirits of the Three Realms attend and heed:
The Jade Clarity Precious Talisman shatters and opens the Nine Dark Realms,
The Fengdu Citadels of the Northern Netherworld—by decree, command, fire, and order!"*

Recite the *Precious Declarations of the Three Heavens* to save all you ghosts:
*"Barriers and locks, open swiftly; iron citadels, collapse and shatter.
Deliver the souls of the dark abyss, free them from their bonds.
Hasten, hasten, as by the decree of the Lord of Heaven!"*

*"Primordial Beginning Lord of Heaven, immeasurably delivering beings,
The numinous talisman descends, shattering prisons and opening gates.
All souls of the dark abyss behold the light,
Their sin registers erased, all ascend together.
Transformed into lotus blossoms, forever free from cries of suffering,
Their consciousness transcends, soaring to the Purple Court.
The Eight Gates open above, merging with the Dao.
The myriad spirits of the Three Realms all receive the mystery’s grace.
Messengers of the Three and Five, direct talisman functionaries,
Hearing my incantation, hasten to arrive now.
Bear the talismanic mandate, shatter and open the dark yin.
Hasten, hasten, as by the decree of the Lord of Heaven!"*

Incantation for dispatching to shatter the prisons:
*"Wind and thunder, fiery veils, bronze pillars, icy depths,
Universal sweeping, butchery and flaying, chariots of fire never cease.
Cauldrons of boiling water seethe, bodies charred and mangled,
Ten thousand deaths, ten thousand rebirths, suffering unbearably light.
Flying Celestial Great Sage, Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct,
Recite the numinous scripture, deliver from the dark abyss.
The Nine Dark Hells of the underworld, end suffering and cease torment.
Wielding the celestial talismanic mandate, inscribe names in Jade Clarity.
Oṃ sam mohanī, eradicate sins by command!
Oṃ sam mohanī.
Hasten, hasten, as by the statutes of the Most High’s mystery ordinances!"*

The *qi*-gesture is as before.

Petition:
*"The Jade Clarity Precious Register illuminates the Nine Springs,
The earth prisons collapse, the iron citadels open and proclaim.
By the Primordial Beginning’s talismanic mandate, at this hour ascend and depart,
To the frigid pools of the Northern Capital.
Escorting and protecting the departed souls of so-and-so,
Subduing demons and recommending promotion, their ranks bestowed in the Southern Palace.
Suffering souls undergo refinement, immortalized and reborn as humans.
Living beings receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas without end.
Transmigrating through kalpas, their years equal to heaven’s.
Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties,
Transcending the Three Realms, carefree in the Supreme Clarity,
All as commanded."*

Petition to shatter the prisons:
*"The Jade Clarity Precious Register’s True Talisman for Shattering Hell is proclaimed to the Northern Yin Fengdu, its inner and outer palace caverns, the Thirty-Six Prisons, the Avīci Hell, the Nine Dark Hells, the Twelve River Sources, the Spring Bends Water Prison, the great and small Iron Enclosures, the ten directions’ prison courts, the eternal dark gates, and the myriad spirits of the underworld—all heed the talismanic mandate!
The true writ blazes forth, illuminating the dark yin.
Torments of mud and ashes cease, interrogations and tortures halt.
Flaming fires extinguish their flames, ice melts and snowy gates dissolve.
Blades transform into jade trees, swords become forests of *qian* blossoms.
Swiftly erase the sin registers, eradicate the roots of evil.
Do not detain the departed souls of so-and-so or any imprisoned suffering souls.
By the merit of this true talisman’s deliverance from suffering, swiftly allow them to depart, behold the light, and ascend to the Southern Palace.
Reborn through transformation, all as commanded."*

**Method:**
At the time of burning, visualize yourself as the Great One. Clasp the upper joint of the middle finger, stand in the *ding* direction facing east, knock the teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:
*Azure Mystery Heavenly Worthy, by talisman deliver from suffering.
Liberate the dark shades, pardon the ghostly households.
According to their vows, ascend to Heaven, without hindrance.
By the Numinous Treasure’s Ordinance, open the earthly prisons.
Permit no delay—disobedience incurs your punishment.*

Next, make the mudra and draw in the nine *qi* of the east, then blow them forth.
*Oṃ mao hōng yín yín chǒu □ zhōng zhōng zhà zhōng shàng lī sì shàng dā xū hōng. Hài.*
*Primordial Talismanic Mandate.*

The Master said: The Primordial Heavenly Worthy, abiding in the Seven-Treasure Kāśyapa Grove, radiates great luminosity, illuminating heaven above and earth below. Therein are seen multitudes of sinful souls, who behold not the light, sunk in the mire of delusion, adrift upon the bitter sea, with no means of deliverance. Thus the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, descends with talismanic mandate to rescue and uplift these sinful souls, that they may ascend to the Dao-realm and forever escape their suffering imprisonment.

The adept who receives this method must purify the heart and cleanse the mind, meditate with utmost sincerity upon the supreme Dao, and in accordance with the ritual proceed with the proclamation—thus shall the dark shades be aided and delivered.

The Five Stars shine resplendent,
The first purity gleams with azure radiance.
The dead souls undergo refinement,
By the *Tai Shang Yuan Jing*.
Soul and spirit return to form,
Summoning the myriad *qi*.
Grasp the numinous mandate of truth—
The yellow *qi* abides at the center.
Transmuted into immortals,
Their years equal those of heaven.
Ranked in the Southern Palace,
Recite the incantation:

*Vast and luminous, purple orchid,
Supreme simplicity, lofty void.
Primordial perfection, mysterious dawn,
The three *qi* merge in purity.
The Eight Vistas of Jade Clarity
Illumine brightly the Nine Crossroads.
Wondrous awakening, transformative change,
The Azure Origin inaugurates the chart.
Responsive to karmic revolutions,
Dissolving demonic realms in the Jade Capital.
Refined as crystalline lingzhi,
Roaming freely in the imperial chariot.
The Three Clarities’ merciful amnesty
Shatters the darkness of the hidden paths.
The Five Peaks and Nine Netherworlds,
Even Fengdu’s unrelenting prisons.
Pāramitā’s cushion descends
To deliver the Three Realms of suffering.
The Five Torments and Eight Adversities,
All toils and afflictions are dispelled.
The underworld officials receive the mandate,
The Primordial True Talisman.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed—
Disobedience shall be punished.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Numinous Treasure’s Great Law commands,
To summon and deliver the lost souls by memorial.*

The Master says: The White Tablet of the Jade-Pure Three Heavens is the Jade Register of the Three Heavens, the divine script of the Most High. When proclaiming its enactment, one must fashion a tablet from wood, seven *cun* and three and a half *fen* in height, four and a half *cun* in width, and three *fen* in thickness.

Seal it externally with blue paper.

This talisman is exclusively for the deliverance of emperors, kings, empresses, consorts, dukes, and marquises. Only after the deceased has undergone three prior deliverances may it be employed.

The Dharma states: When inscribing the talisman, kneel facing the Heavenly Gate and silently petition the Three Heavens. Visualize the descent of the Three Pure *qi*, then silently invoke the hidden names of the Three Heavens, reciting: *Hong-ling-yun-gan-zhong-yi-qi* seven times. Draw *qi* into the brush and inscribe. Upon completion, recite the invocation nine more times, then draw three breaths of Pure *qi* and blow them onto the tablet. Execute the Jade-Pure Mudra.

*Three qi surge as mist,
Luminous qi soars in fourfold ascent.
The suffering souls of myriad ancestors,
Their forms having traversed the Great Yin,
Are refined and delivered by the reckoned day—
Thus attaining immortality.
Sins and blessings, prohibitions and karmic bonds,
All receive liberation;
The body is reborn upon reception of life.
The soul’s transient extinction yields immediate return to life.*

**Section on Fasting Rites, Talismanic Scripts, Memorial Tablets, and Dragon-Offering Petitions**

The Master said: The Primordial Beginning, in stabilizing and spreading the Five Scriptures, caused the Five Venerable Lords of the Dao to receive the Vermilion Writ of True Texts, securing the root of Heaven and the source of Earth, and descending to guard the Five Marchmounts, thereby establishing the Five Directions. This is truly the root and origin of the Numinous Treasure, the pivot of salvation for humanity. Those who study the Dao and seek immortality, transmitting the scriptures of the Central Alliance and wearing the registers of the Numinous Treasure, all inscribe the Vermilion Writ of True Texts upon wooden tablets, facing them to compose memorial petitions. These are cast into mountains and rivers or placed at residences, sealing covenants with the Three Realms and excising the roots of transgression. Offering dragon tablets and presenting petitions at the Five Marchmounts erases faults and dissolves errors—this is its fundamental purpose, as recorded in the Jade Scripts of True Texts and various scriptures.

The ritual statutes state: Whenever a grand Yellow Register fast is established and the altar rites conclude, tablets of mountain soil and water are used, accompanied by golden dragons, golden fasteners, and jade discs, to record and seal the merits of the fast and petition the Three Origins. This method truly originates from the Vermilion Writ of the Five Venerable Lords. Since Master Zhang Chengxian of the Tang dynasty compiled the *Ritual Statutes of the Shu Fast*, it has been explained in detail. When Du Guangcheng compiled the *Ritual Statutes of the Yellow Register Fast*, he exhaustively described the origins of the Vermilion Writ and the ceremonial forms of petition-offering, making it clear and unambiguous. In recent times, some inscribe a single talisman on each of the three tablets, with varying talismanic forms transmitted by different individuals. How could one abandon the original intent of petition-offering and proceed without the Vermilion Writ? Here, we briefly elucidate the incantations for the three tablets, clarifying their essentials.

The incantation for the mountain tablet states:
*"Mystic Above opens illumination,
Primordial Beginning oversees truth,
The Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,
command the Vermilion Script of Cinnabar Texts.
The origin of Heaven and Earth,
governs the Three Origins."*

The incantation for the water tablet states:
*"Primordial Beginning and the Five Venerable Lords,
Supreme Lords of the Dao,
Perfected Ones of the Ten Directions,
Transcendent Immortals of Great Splendor,
the Vermilion Script proclaims the mandate,
unheard in no hidden realm."*

The incantation for the earth tablet states:
*"Heaven and Earth unfold,
the Nine Qi divide their numen,
the Three Origins’ cavernous palaces,
the Ten Directions radiantly pure.
The Five Venerable Lords of the Dao,
open truth and govern life,
the Cinnabar Script of Vermilion Texts,
Highest Clarity of the Primordial Beginning."*

Examining the purport of the three incantations, they all clearly refer to the Vermilion Writ of the Five Venerable Lords. If replaced with other talismans, this would greatly contradict the original intent, and the incantations would no longer align. How could one fail to verify this? Now, following the scriptural intent, the Five Venerable Lords’ Vermilion Writ in Jade Script is inscribed on the reverse of the tablets. This is chosen for its meaning as a token of petition-offering, derived from the orthodox scriptures and not comparable to later private transmissions. Though various lineages may have their own traditions, this form must not be altered. Moreover, petition-offering directly concerns the offices of the Three Officials, where sin and fortune are determined—one must reflect carefully.

The Jade Scripts of the Vermilion Writ are already detailed in the *Section on Suppression and Control*. For convenience, the relevant portions are excerpted here and presented below, though some repetition is unavoidable. The three talismans, though not to be used, are also preserved to serve as evidence for advanced scholars.

**Instructions:**
A tablet is a record. It records the merits of the age and petitions the Supreme Perfected Ones. The upper and lower edges are each one foot two inches long, two inches four fen wide, and two fen thick. For the state, they are made of jade, for jade possesses the Nine Virtues and is the token of ritual propriety for Heaven and Earth. For all others, they are made of *huai* wood or cypress, with cinnabar borders representing the Five Phases. The country’s name, the year, the location of the fast, and the name of the High Merit Officer are inscribed in cinnabar. They are cast into famous mountains, cavern-heavens, numinous springs, and dragon lairs, or buried at the fast’s altar, petitioning the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water to manifest the fast’s merits and report the affair to the upper realms.

Each tablet is accompanied by a golden dragon. The dragon serves as the messenger bearing the tablet and petition to the offices of the Three Officials. Each tablet is also accompanied by a jade disc: the mountain tablet uses a green disc, circular with a hollow center; the earth tablet uses a yellow disc, square with a hollow center; the water tablet uses a dark disc, hexagonal with a hollow center. Each is two and a half inches in diameter. Additionally, twenty-seven golden fasteners are used, each nine fen in diameter, their outer edges rounded like rings. Nine fasteners are used per tablet, bound together with the dragon and disc using green silk. The green silk substitutes for cut hair, and the golden fasteners substitute for sacrificial blood, petitioning the Three Officials. Salvation in life and deliverance in death, cultivation of truth and study of the Dao—all follow the same principle. Only the texts and incantations differ; one must carefully examine and perform them to avoid error in the unseen and manifest realms.

**Gate of Ascent and Verification**

The Master says: Once the departed soul has completed its refinement, a certificate of ordination and talismanic writ shall be issued for its custody. This document is to be presented to the relevant authorities for verification and matching, so that the soul may be registered for rebirth. It serves as the imperial mandate and evidentiary proof for this world. Without it, the soul will face obstruction and detention at every passage, making transcendence difficult to achieve.

**Vermilion Mound True Talisman of the Great Unity for Saving the Living, Rescuing the Dead, Relieving Suffering, and Enabling Transcendence**

The Method states: When inscribing this talisman, first face east and burn incense. Kneel, bow three times, and memorialize, visualizing the Great Unity riding a nine-headed lion of five colors, its golden light flashing, mouth exhaling the *qi* of the Azure Mystery. After nine prostrations and the memorial, form the Jade Mudra, empower the brush, and recite the incantation:

*"Primal Thearch of the Jade Capital, spread forth the most efficacious Dharma.
The Dao’s methods bestow grace, conferring talismans for transcendence.
If transgressions exist, swiftly remove them.
Your jade words manifest—ten thousand spirits heed."*

Once the prayer is complete, draw the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate into the brush. Next, form the Mao Mudra, invoke the name of the Great Unity eighty-one times, and draw the *qi* from the Great Unity’s mouth into the paper and brush. Recite again:

*"By the decree of the Heavenly Worthy of Great Unity, Savior from Suffering."*

Repeat eighty-one times, drawing *qi* into the brush. Then, recite eighty-one times more, drawing the *qi* of the Azure Mystery, and inscribe the talisman as the *qi* flows.

**Jade Contract for Ascending to Heaven in Unison**

The Master says: The *Inner Writ of the Three Sovereigns* contains a *Board and Contract for Ascending to Heaven*. When attaining the Dao and ascending in flight, the Heavenly Worthy dispatches attendant perfected ones to bestow the contract, enabling flesh and bones to ascend together and pass through the Heavenly Gates. This practice is not permitted for unauthorized use in the mundane world.

This is the *Jade Contract in Unison of the Three Heavens*, the *Numinous Mandate of the Thearch* and *True Writ of the Jade Emperor*, bestowed upon scholar-practitioners of the living who pay homage to the origin and visit the perfected, as well as to liberate the souls of the dead. It refines the po in the Southern Palace, ensuring no obstruction at the Heavenly Gates.

The method employs a sheet of blue paper, folded into four gates. The contract text is inscribed in cinnabar on the front, while the memorial, year, cyclical signs, and Dharma rank are written on the back, arranged in five columns. It is placed in a crimson pouch, tied with a blue cord. If the practitioner’s heart is aligned, it should be worn over the heart. When liberating the dead or enabling transformation, it must be attached to the straw effigy for the Heavenly Gate officers to facilitate passage.

*"Three Heavens’ Void and Primal,

Only the "Passing through All Heavens" petition shall be written on blue-green paper; the rest shall be inscribed in ink on yellow paper. Bind the four petitions together with yellow paper, fashioning a large envelope to seal them.

**Decree to the Earth Deities**
Guarantor Petition
To the Ministry of the Supreme Mystery Capital:
Respectfully following the Dao’s decree.

Here the Decree commands the Earth Deities and their attendants to escort and receive the departed [Name] and their kin, extracting them from the Earth’s gates, forever freed from ghostly officials. Their souls shall cross the Vermilion Mound, undergo refinement, and be reborn—all in full accordance with the proclaimed command.

Issued on the [Day] of the [Month] in the year of the Great Year [Year], at the hour [Time].

The Dharma-rank official, your subject [Surname] [Name], respectfully receives the edict and carries it out.

**External Seal Formula**
*Petition for Ascension to Heaven: Document for the Ascension of the Departed [Name] and Kin*

[Title] [Surname] [Name] respectfully seals.

For the above formula, the four talismans shall be inscribed in vermilion on blue and white silk and affixed to the four cardinal decrees, issued in unison.

The **Primordial Beginning Talisman Mandate** is entrusted to the departed soul for safekeeping, to be held in conjunction with the decrees.

The **Four Cardinal Unison Contract** is also known as the *Golden Text Jade Contract*.

The Master says: This contract was bestowed by the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign upon the Supreme Mystery Perfected Lord, then transmitted to the Left Immortal Duke of the Great Ultimate. Later, the Green Ox Seal Lord passed it to Bao of the Southern Sea, whence it entered the world.

Use the Four Cardinal Unison Contract as prescribed: bind one portion in yellow silk, inscribed in vermilion, and deliver it to the Celestial Gate Scribe to be burned at the Heavenly Gate. Inscribe another portion in vermilion on white jade and cast it into the blessed lands of famous mountains, the grotto-heavens of cliffs and caves. A third portion, inscribed in vermilion on blue silk, is entrusted to the departed soul for safekeeping. The fourth portion shall be engraved on the back of a golden fish and cast into the waters.

The Three Officials’ Joint Contract and the Three Origins’ Unison Pact shall both record the purpose of the ritual and the name of the departed soul as the principal. The intent is that the departed, upon reaching the unison contract, shall undergo transformation according to their rank.

It is further said: Inscribe a sheet of yellow paper in vermilion, then divide it diagonally into four pieces. Affix one piece each to the four guarantor talismans: the eastern piece to the *Primordial Beginning Talisman Mandate*, the southern piece to the *Proclamation to the Three Realms*, the western piece to the *Passing through All Heavens*, and the northern piece to the *Decree to the Earth Deities*.

For edicts, follow the format of the guarantor petitions and the four talismans. Additionally, use blue and white silk to fashion a sealed envelope, inscribing it in vermilion, and employ it according to the prescribed method.

**Section on Ritual Methods and Talismanic Scripts**
**Left and Right Contracts for Ascension to Heaven in the Numinous Treasure Tradition**

The Master says: These contracts are the talismanic agreements of the Most High, the material proof for ascending to Heaven.

**Method of Preparation:**
Use double-sided azure paper, nine *cun* or one *chi* in height, and one *chi* six *cun* or one *chi* eight *cun* in length as the standard.

**Left Contract (Front Side):**
In the center, inscribe the Great Brahmā Hidden Script in a circular arrangement, with four phrases per line. The left contract, being an odd number, employs single characters. The petition text is written from the inside outward to both edges on the reverse side, following the prescribed script of the Three Sovereigns’ Inner Sounds and True Writ.

**Right Contract (Front Side):**
In the center, inscribe the names of the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors in a circular arrangement, with four phrases per line, totaling sixteen lines. The right contract, being an even number, employs paired characters. The petition text follows the same format as above, with the reverse side also inscribed with the True Writ.

After refinement and empowerment, sever the contracts at the center. Place the two right halves in a paulownia wood box or seal them with inner and outer layers of azure paper, then entrust them to the Heavenly Gate Officers for confidential submission alongside the petition and memorial.

The two left halves are distributed as follows: one half to the male soul’s principal recipient, and the other half to the female soul’s principal recipient, who shall keep them. Encase them in an azure paper envelope, attach them to the base of the banner, or place them within the *Shengtianju* (Ascension to Heaven Apparatus). If dedicating the ritual to a single individual, store the contract in an azure pouch and affix it to the left or right side of the straw effigy, then present it to the Heavenly Gate for verification.

For the two contracts, another method involves inscribing the hidden language of the thirty-two heavens at the front, arranged in sixteen lines, with the petition written afterward. This carries no fixed meaning and need not be rigidly adhered to.

With this contract, they ascend through Heaven’s Gate and are reborn in the Hall of Blessings.

**Seal Following the Right Contract**
We humbly submit: The Divine Empyrean’s sacred talismans descend from the Central Heaven. The Jade Tablet’s numinous script is bestowed from the Crimson Palace. Practicing them leads to transcendent ranks; wearing them achieves immortal stages. Moreover, the ancestral script of the Three Qi delivers lost souls from the dark night. The Nine Heavens’ precious register rescues suffering spirits from the garden’s gate. All who are destined to return to the mandate rely entirely on the gift of life. After the departed [Name] receives and upholds this, they become a people of the Great Dao, forever dwelling in the Hall of Blessings, attaining the fruit of non-action. Today, before the Yellow Altar, the transmission is bestowed for eternal observance. Upon receiving the talisman, execute it as decreed by the Mysterious Regulations.

**Right Petition**
The Dao is hidden and nameless, its rise and fall unfathomable. Qi congeals in form, cycling through life and death. Though principle remains unerring, karmic conditions bear witness. Now the departed [Name], their life ended on the nether path, their spirit scattered in the dark road, surely bore worldly transgressions and accumulated past misdeeds. Thus, the courts of Fengdu record their yang transgressions and yin merits, wielding the authority to examine the Three Paths and enforce the punishments of the Nine Hells. Their suffering is pitiable—how can it be absolved? Their consciousness is lost in confusion, difficult to transcend the gloom. Today, on this most auspicious occasion, the investigation is concluded, and their sins are released. Their soul departs the eternal night’s court, their evil roots’ suffering extinguished. Invested with the Yellow and the Dao, their life is transcended by talismanic decree. They penetrate the subtle and profound, ascend the wondrous Dao, as proclaimed in the decree.

Presiding over the Register: The True Lord of the Han Bureau of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace,
Conferring the Register: The Soul-Refining True Lord of the Southern Prosperity Upper Palace,
The Great Emperor of Longevity of the Southern Culmen.

The Yellow Register of the Numinous Treasure for Long Life and Deliverance of Destiny,
The Supreme Yellow Register of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery for Long Life and Deliverance of Destiny.

In the great Ming year [Year], under the Tai Sui of [Month], on the [Day] of the lunar month, [Native Place and Name] humbly petitions at the Yellow Altar to receive the transmission of the Supreme Yellow Register of the Numinous Treasure of the Cavernous Mystery for Long Life and Deliverance of Destiny, First Rank. Bestowed upon [Name]’s soul, this precious writ shall ferry them across the Three Realms and ascend them to the Nine Heavens.

As the scripture states:
In ancient times, the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, dwelling in the Three Yuan Palace of the Ninefold Clarity’s wondrous realm, expounded the most subtle and vast teachings with the assembly of great sages, enlightening humans and devas. He inscribed meritorious deeds in the Yellow Register, arranging golden tablets and jade slips before the Three Clarities, so that every hell might witness the ten directions. The Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering entered the Nine Dark Realms to deliver all from torment.

The Heavenly Worthy universally proclaimed to the four assemblies: “If you can receive and uphold the Golden Register and White Slips, the Ninefold Wondrous Precepts, the Talisman of Long Life, and the True Talisman of Salvation, you shall eradicate the great sins of the Nine Dark Realms and inscribe your names in the Nine Palaces. The Youth Who Surveys Destiny, the Guardian Spirits of the Precepts, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the functionaries of the Six Palaces shall follow the writ’s text to shelter and protect the departed souls who receive the precepts.”

Now I shall clearly expound the Ninefold Wondrous Precepts, the merits of upholding the Golden Register and White Slips, the deliverance from calamity and salvation from suffering—divine powers beyond comprehension.

The assembled spirits bow their heads, reverently receiving the sacred command.

The Heavenly Worthy declared:

First, the Nine Wondrous Precepts:
1. Reverence and deference—filial piety and care for parents.
2. Diligence and devotion—loyalty to the sovereign.
3. Non-killing—compassion and deliverance of all beings.
4. Non-lewdness—rectifying the body and dwelling in integrity.
5. Non-theft—extending righteousness and diminishing the self.
6. Non-anger—no cruelty or aggression toward others.
7. Non-deceit—no flattery, treachery, or harm to the good.
8. Non-arrogance—no contempt or disregard for the Perfect Truth.
9. Non-duality—devotion to the precepts with single-minded focus.

The Nine-Dragon Golden Register of the Azure Palace of the Eastern Ultimate, the True Talisman of Salvation of the Primordial Writ and the Golden Register with White Slips, is proclaimed to the boundless worlds of the ten directions, to the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Twenty Courts, the Examiners of the Five Emperors, the Nine Dark Hells, the Mighty Heavenly Enforcers, the Divine Soldiers of Punishment, the Recorders of Deeds and Lifespans, the Ministers of Merit and Execution, the Ox-Headed Wardens, and the Great Demons of the Three Realms.

Deliver the departed soul of so-and-so from transgression, liberate them from the hells, forever parting from eternal night to behold the light. All sins shall be swept away, all grievances dissolved. By the merit of this Nine-Dragon Talismanic Writ, ascend to the heavens above, all as proclaimed.

The One Hundred Twenty Court Officials.
The Register of Flowing Gold and Refined Truth of the Purple Tenuity Palace of Southern Prosperity.

The Primordial Writ, the Golden Register with White Slips, and the Talisman of Long Life are proclaimed to the Cinnabar Heavenly Realm of the South, the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion, the Supreme Palace of Southern Prosperity, the Great Lord of Long Life, the Lords Han and Sima, the Ministers of Lifespan and Records, the Venerable Spirits of Extended Longevity and Augmented Destiny, the Deliverers from Tribulation, the Great Spirits Who Revive the Dead and Oversee Birth.

Exalt the departed soul of so-and-so to ascend to the Flowing Fire Courtyard of the Vermilion Palace, where jade eyes refine the form and yellow blossoms purify the body. Their name shall be inscribed on the purple tablets, and they shall receive transformation and rebirth. By the merit of this Golden Register’s deliverance of life, they shall rise at every moment, all as proclaimed.

The Venerable Spirits Who Revive the Dead.
The Great Spirits Who Oversee Birth.

The soul of the departed so-and-so, having received deliverance, shall this day reverently approach the Altar of the Yellow Register Retreat to receive the Supreme Yellow Register of Long Life and Deliverance of Life, the peerless register of the Most High Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure.

Having received it in accordance with the rites, they shall forever serve in salvation, revered and upheld in both the human and heavenly realms, all in strict accordance with the Mysterious Statutes and Ordinances.

Issued on the [day] of the [month] of the [year] of the Great Year, at the Altar of the Yellow Register Retreat in [location].

Seal of the Master of Deliverance, [Dharma rank and name].
Endorsement of the Sponsoring Master.
Endorsement of the Supervising Master.

The Supreme Yellow Register of Long Life and Deliverance of Life of the Most High Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, is to be used solely for proper deliverance; no other purpose is permitted.

Inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk, with figures painted in colors, the client of the departed shall be duly noted—this is for the properly delivered. Next, the Flowing Fire Pavilion Talisman and the Fire-Refinement Talisman shall be applied, along with the dispersal of form.

Within the talismanic gate of the Fire-Refinement Pavilion, the figures represent the Fire-Refinement Talisman. Once the seal is affixed, it may be backed with green, purple, red, or yellow silk brocade, using a scripture ribbon and roller, all in accordance with the register style of the ancestral altar.

This follows the Yellow Register Rites of Cai Zhixu.

Another version from the Jade Hall calls it the Golden Register, inscribed in gold on green silk, with the rest following the same format.

The paper may be one foot and one inch in height, with two inches left blank at the top and one inch at the bottom, leaving two inches and nine fen for the inscription.

Here ends Scroll Forty-Eight of the *Great Methods of the Highest Clarity, Numinous Treasure*.
Here begins Scroll Forty-Nine of the *Great Methods of the Highest Clarity, Numinous Treasure*.

The Illustrious Perfected Ning Quanzhen of Radiant Salvation, Master of Mystic Subtlety, transmitted to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Highest Clarity and Successor in the Teaching of Numinous Treasure:

**Gate of Grand Refinement Talismans**

The Master said: In the nether realms, suffering souls and stagnant spirits, their forms defiled and impure, are bound fast within the gates of the Yellow Springs. Without the transformative power of Heaven and Earth’s true qi refining and delivering them, how could they ascend and transcend?

Thus, the Most High, in great compassion, transmitted the scriptures of Fire-Refinement and the methods of Yellow Flower Ablution. Those who practice these arts embody the primordial transformation-body of the Origin, gathering the mysterious and primordial qi of yin and yang, harmonizing the qi of the Three Fields. Borrowing the fire of the three qi of the Southern Quarter, they ascend and descend to purify the turbid, sever the ghostly portals, and wash away filth and grime. Thus, inner and outer become radiant and translucent, the hundred bones suffused with light, and only then may one attain the Dao of Non-Action.

Therefore, to summon the soul, one first employs the writings of the Northern Dipper to gather the hun and po, removing the portal of death. Thereafter, one uses the talismans of the Southern Culmen to oversee the register of rebirth. Thus, the Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper refine the hun and forge the po, enabling the return of form and the roaming of the Great Void. This is the supreme Dao of Numinous Treasure.

**Altars of Threefold Radiance Refinement**
**Altar of Southern Prosperity for Refinement and Deliverance**
**Altar of Ninefold Refinement for the Generation of Corporeal Forms**
**Altar of Numinous Treasure for the Refinement and Deliverance of Ascending Immortals**

**Formats for the Gate of Ascension and Refinement**

The Master said: For the Altar of Ascension and Refinement, and the refinement pool of water, one must construct a gate beside the pool. Inscribe five characters upon it, then use a talisman to pass through the Water Gate. Likewise, for the fire pool, construct a gate beside it, inscribe five characters upon it, and use a talisman to pass through the Fire Gate.

**Water Gate Talisman**
The right talisman is inscribed in yellow on blue-green silk, with the character *zi* facing north in black.

When passing through the gate to undergo refinement, one may summon the appropriate office, and the numinous will respond with resonance.

**Guardian Official of the Water Refinement Pool of the Upper Palace of Southern Prosperity**
Xiang Zhizhuang, styled Zhishi, stands six feet and two inches tall, clad in an embroidered robe of purple silk interwoven with blue-green, wielding an axe at the Water Gate.

**Summoning Incantation:**
By the decree of the Three Heavens,
Let the great spirit heed and attend.

To shatter the gate and refine the po, pass through the Water Gate.
By the stern command of Jade Clarity, swiftly refine the hidden spirits.
The divine officials, bearing the talisman, must not delay or linger.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor decrees.

**Fire Gate Talisman**
The right talisman is inscribed in black on red silk, with the character *wu* facing south in qi.

When passing through the gate, summon the appropriate office, and the spirits will transform, fierce and mighty, restoring the body to life.

**Guardian Official of the Fire Refinement Pool**
Lu Cun, styled Chenzi, stands six feet and two inches tall, clad in a red-embroidered robe with a yellow headscarf, wielding a sword at the Fire Gate.

**Summoning Incantation:**
By the command of the Great Emperor,
Let the messenger heed and attend.
Surpass the Fire Gate of souls,
Refine the po at the southern dyke.
Open the gate, unseal the Way,
Shatter the locks, spread wide the doors.
By the decree of Jade Clarity,
Dare any dare to disobey?
The divine officials, bearing the talisman,
Ascend and refine without action.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor decrees.

**Form for Water Pool and Fire Pond**
The Master says: When establishing a water pool, choose a *ren-gui* day, construct it of stone, square within and round without, with the center below forming the *Kan* trigram. Let it be five feet in diameter, carve the talisman within, and set up a placard inscribed *Flowing Torrent Pond* at the northeast corner.

When establishing a fire pool, choose a *bing-ding* day, have artisans carve it from stone, square within and round without, with the center below forming the *Li* trigram. Let it be three feet in diameter, set up a placard inscribed *Smelting Refinement Pool*, carve the talisman within, and place it at the southeast corner.

Above both pools, hang banners to guide the approaching souls. The Dharma Master shall establish them according to this form.

**Talisman for Flowing Torrent Water Pond**
**Talisman for Fire Pool**

**Banner Talisman for Flowing Torrent Water Pond**
*Great Supreme Three Perfected Ones, their qi conjoined and intermingled,
The Celestial River pours forth its irrigation,
Nine souls refine their forms,
Moon’s essence, yellow blossoms,
Three numina flow as clouds,
Divine souls and true po return to Jade Capital.

**Great Refinement Talismanic Gate**
**Taiyin Primordial Form Yin Refinement Method**

The Master said: The Primordial unites with qi, gathering to form the numinous.
Three Origins and nine numbers circulate through the twelve divisions.
In heaven, they correspond to the twelve celestial palaces and their domains;
in humans, to the twelve meridians and visceral systems,
aligning with the six yin and six yang to generate and complete the outer and inner forms.

Now, the refinement of the yin corpse transforms through qi-convergence and spirit-gathering,
forging the true radiance of life, penetrating the yang light,
so as not to fall into dark destinies but to ascend to the realm of the Dao.

Yet those whose souls remain unrefined—
even in the nether courts, the same applies.
One must perform the Nine Yang Refinement and Salvation,
reciting the twelve meridian true talismans,
burning them in the fire pool,
then invoking the twelve great generals’ true forms
to regenerate the five viscera and six bowels.

The method states:
Bind mugwort into a human shape, using the clothing the departed wore at life’s end.
First, inscribe and burn the twelve meridian talismans, distributing them among the five viscera and six bowels.
Then, in cinnabar, write the Jade Script true writ and affix it to the abdomen.
Also in cinnabar, write the *Great Great Contract for Ascension to Heaven*,
place it in a crimson silk pouch, and hang it from the collar.
Further, inscribe the *Numinous Treasure Five Talismans* and arrange them among the five viscera,
uniting my three sections and eight luminaries with the twenty-four true qi.

First, establish the altar and perform the Dao,
petitioning the Celestial Emperor,
notifying the Nine Dark Prisons and the Bureaus of the Dead,
dispatching the traveling officials to pursue and retrieve the departed soul.
When night falls, prepare the ritual regalia
and place the mugwort effigy at the Ghost Gate in the northeast wilderness.

The Dharma Master, at the Earth Gate,
transforms into the Nine Radiance Perfected Person,
paces the Dipper from head to tail,
gazes toward the Heavenly Gate, and summons the true qi.
A youth holds the soul-summoning banner at the Heavenly Gate,
while the Dharma Master gathers and commands the qi,
transmuting it to form the five viscera.
Then, the assembly recites the *Golden Watchtower Transformation Body Heavenly Worthy*,
and the youth circles, drawing the true qi downward to infuse the mugwort effigy,
completing the twelve qi.

Next, at the Human Gate,
visualize the mugwort effigy transforming into a human form.
The Dharma Master and assembly recite the central scripture in unison,
circling the effigy, sprinkling willow-branch purified water three times.
The assembly chants the *Step-in-Emptiness Invocation*,
raising the mugwort effigy to the altar’s base.
The Dharma Master then performs the refinement and salvation in sequence,
using the twelve Primordial Great General talismans
and the twelve meridian talismans in the Great Refinement.
This method, from the Yellow Register, may be used for up to three names.

**Primordial Twelve Great Generals Yin-Yang Twelve Meridian Talismans**

The Master said:
Thirty-six qi form the material basis of yin and yang;
thirty-six qi generate the meridians.
Thus, the thirty-six celestial circuits flow through the body,
uniting yin and yang, hun and po,
to form the infant and return to the womb, becoming human—
this is the Dao of one generating two, two generating three.

Within the talismans, each Great General commands one hundred twenty officers,
with one supreme commander overseeing each.
During refinement, burn the talismans to summon them,
using them to regenerate the five viscera and six bowels.
The yin and yang meridian talismans must be employed together.
Write them with realgar mixed with cinnabar on yellow silk,
focusing the mind, stabilizing the spirit, and embodying the true self.
Visualize the Three Luminaries’ scripts without distraction.

The method states:
First, enter a quiet chamber, burn incense,
and petition the Three Luminaries’ High Perfected, the Vermilion Numinous Great Emperor,
Lord Donghua and Queen Mother of the West,
presenting your sincere intentions.
Then summon the various Great Generals and spirit officials to descend.
Face southeast and inscribe according to the prescribed form.

**Upper Corpse Talisman**
*Incantation for the Upper Corpse:*
The Upper Corpse loves desire, self-styled Pengju.
Transformed into nine kinds, bird-headed with serpent’s body.
Chaotic and heartless, now sinking, now floating.
Greedy for flavors and splendor, self-indulgent in beauty.
It flees with human *hun* and *po*, oversees human faults.
It severs the root of life, scatters *qi*, and spirits wander.
Reckless in the Three Palaces, tiny worms without toil.
True Person of Jia-Yi, inscribe the numinous talisman.
Desire for sensuality is cut off, the path of death removed.
The Primordial Beginning has decreed: beseech the destruction of the corpse’s head.
The Three Terraces monitor the form—swiftly depart, Yuanliu!
Eradicate the root, sever the lineage, leave no remnant behind.
The deceased is refined in truth, the Three Palaces made clear and void.
The Five Emperors oversee, the Great One records the decree.
On an auspicious day, bathe and don cap and sash to perform the rites.
Soar through the celestial realms, streaming radiance in the jade chariot.
Pursue the light to the Upper Clarity, roam the void in flight.
All in accordance with the proclaimed command, ascend to Jade Capital.

**Middle Corpse Talisman**
*Incantation for the Middle Corpse:*
The Middle Corpse, Pengqi, is called the Central Yellow.
It dwells in desire, hiding within the belly.
Sinking and floating, transforming—its form has no constant shape.
It seizes human *hun* and *po*, fleeing to the Three Palaces.
The Red Child gallops, driving one to madness.
Desire and nature deplete the spirit—sin arises from tiny worms.
True Person of Jia-Yi, the Celestial Emperor has already summoned.
Adorn the body with jade talismans, jade script and golden seals.
Inscribe names on the Primordial Register—three desires are now extinguished.
The Primordial Beginning’s talismanic command: behead and destroy the corpse’s form.
Sever the root, cut off the lineage, let it not take flight.
The departed soul undergoes refinement, the Five Palaces cleansed and frozen.
True immortals settle in peace, light born within the viscera.
The Five Emperors oversee, the Great One arrays the ranks.
Bathe in the Middle Prime, don cap and robes.
Release the form, transform into radiance—streaming jade light.
Fly and ascend to the Upper Clarity, breathe the void of the Great Emptiness.
Ever preserve the natural, heaven and earth without end.
All in accordance with the proclaimed command, ascend to Jade Capital.

**Lower Corpse Talisman**
*Incantation for the Lower Corpse:*
The Lower Corpse, Pengjiao, glories in greed and desire.
White and chaotic, its body has no constant form.
It clings to human feet, delighting in stirring emotions.
Speaking of my gains and losses, it flees as *hun* and *ling*.
It disturbs the Three Palaces, the Red Child unsettled.
Greedy, desirous tiny worms feign readiness in the hidden depths.
True Person of Jia-Yi, the three refinements are now purified.
The gate of desire is sealed, no longer receiving demonic essence.
The Primordial Beginning’s urgent decree: the Three Terraces descend to the court.
Swiftly depart, Yuan Yin, along with your brothers!
Nine kinds of descendants—all beheaded at once.
The Five Emperors deliver truth, the Great One records names.
Bathe in the Lower Prime, don cap and feathered azure.
Pass beyond the Three Realms, drink the primordial essence above.
Release the form, vanish in transformation—streaming light to the Upper Clarity.
Step the void in flight, the Three Realms equally luminous.
All in accordance with the proclaimed command, ascend to Jade Capital.

**Ninefold Refinement of the Living Corpse Talisman Chapter**
The Master said: The method of Ninefold Refinement of the Living Corpse is the supreme Dao.
When a person first receives life, all emerge from the Void.
None fail to rely on past karma, meeting present conditions.
Taking the image of Heaven and Earth, embracing Sun and Moon,
Transforming yin and yang, spirit and consciousness coming and going—
Amidst the myriad transformations, the Three Burners congeal in secret,
The Nine Heavens darkly revolve. All are born through the harmonious union of the *qi* of the Nine Heavens’ generative spirits.
The first month: the *qi* of the Baoyu Shantian descends to form the embryo.
The second month: the *qi* of the Taishan Shantian descends to form the fetus.
The third month: the *qi* of the Fan Jian Tian descends to complete the *hun*.
The fourth month: the *qi* of the Jiran Tian descends to complete the *po*.
The fifth month: the *qi* of the Poluonimi Bujiaole Tian descends to transform the gallbladder.
The sixth month: the *qi* of the Dongxuan Tian Wujiang descends to transform the viscera.
The seventh month: the *qi* of the Mingqiao Linghua Tian descends to illuminate the orifices.
The eighth month: the *qi* of the Gaoxu Tian descends to attach the radiance.
The ninth month: the *qi* of the Yuanxiang Yuanjie Yuan’ai Tian descends to infuse the spirit.
Within the body, eighteen thousand spirits—inner and outer in harmony—
Thirty-six thousand spirits simultaneously generate the body.
Golden towers and jade chambers, purple portals arrayed in spirit,
Enveloping the body within and without, resonating in sound and spirit.
The Three Primes nurture, the Nine *Qi* shape the form,
Day and night unceasing, spreading transformation and change.
The Yellow Spirit receives the essence—thus one enters the womb.
In receiving life, none fail to be born through the *qi* of the Nine Heavens.
Now, gathering and transforming the *qi* of the Nine Heavens,
Spreading it across the Eight Directions—
The dead return to life, withered bones emit smoke,
Sins and burdens dissolve, the Nine Heavens merge as one.
The myriad spirits are complete, spirit and consciousness clear.
Then the *hun* alone transcends the Three Heavens,
Modeling Heaven and Earth, containing yin and exhaling yang,
Generating spirits and spreading transformation—each has its method and secret.
Through repeated refinement and transformation, one may ascend to the Primordial Beginning.
The method of Ninefold Refinement of the Living Corpse follows the count of one hundred and eight:
Thirty-six Heavens, thirty-six Primes of Chaos.
Taking the thirty-six within the deceased’s body—
One Primordial, Two Modes, Three Lights, Four Images,
Five Phases, Six Pitches, Seven Governors, Nine Palaces—
Together, one hundred and eight.

Thus follows the reckoning of Yang’s ninety-six cycles, gathering the qi of Heaven and Earth to regenerate and form the human. The qi of Heaven engenders the spirits; the qi of the Nine Spirits engenders the nine orifices. Above, they connect to the Gate of Heaven, their voices attaining spirit-completion, resonating with the Nine Heavens above. The Nine Qi emerge before the Great Void, concealed within the hollow emptiness—without light, without image, without form, without name. The Nine Non-Beings array the proper order: sun, moon, and starry constellations; yin and yang, the Five Phases; the peoples and all categories of beings—all receive life and formation.

The myriad transformations of Heaven and Earth, if not nurtured by the Three Origins, would not coalesce into form through the Nine Qi. Therefore, after nine months, when the spirits have spread and qi is full, the Five Spirits are complete, and the human body is formed. Thirty-six transformations are generated, corresponding above to the Thirty-Six Heavens and below to the Thirty-Six Earths—none is lacking. Excluding the two qi of sun and moon that overspread and illumine the ten thousand lands, this makes one hundred and six in total, which aligns with the calamity of Yang’s ninety-six cycles—the great term of *jiashen*.

Inscribe this talisman on yellow paper in cinnabar, using the Emperor’s Mudra, the Southern Qi, and blow it onto the Vermilion Numinous Fire Mansion Pavilion. On its bridge, also place a scroll of the *Nine Heavens’ Engendering Spirit Chapter*. When burning, silently intone:

Next, envision clouds rising to form this Great Dharma Bridge, imagining the scripture as a long bridge upon which the departed soul rides the yang light to ascend heaven.

**Guiding Soul Asterism**
**Delivering the Departed Asterism**

Upon completing the two asterisms, visualize oneself as the Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy. From the left eye, emit three streams of purple qi; from the right eye, five rays of rosy light, encircling the bridge three times.

Silent incantation:

Left and right, the sagely immortals.
Golden flight of the numinous millstone,
Deliver the departed to rebirth.
Lower Primordial’s living spirits,
Yin ministries’ wandering souls.
Instantly arrive at the Mystic Altar,
Guiding Generals to lead the way.
Jade-pillar immortals,
Three *hun* and seven *po*.
Guiding Generals,
Swiftly respond!
Able to speak and communicate,
Greatly bestowed by Heaven and Earth.
Rivers and sun-moon,
Eight seas and five gates.
All Heaven’s Great Sages,
Guide the soul to the Highest Mystery.
Hasten across the immortal bridge,
No lingering delay.

Then visualize the light of both eyes intersecting,
Drawing the departed soul to ascend the Dharma Bridge of Deliverance.

Another incantation:

Great Sages’ true numina.
Hasten to my altar below,
To guide and receive the departed soul.

Next, visualize true fire within the heart,
Issuing from the mouth for hundreds of yards,
Envisioning the departed riding the fire’s light to ascend the bridge,
Both hands forming the *Wu* mudra.

Incantation:

You have received the Register of the Great Mystery,
Eternal life and carefree wandering.
Holding the true talisman,
No passage through hell,
Wholeheartedly toward the Heavenly Emperor.
Decreed to swiftly transcend rebirth,
By the Heavenly Emperor’s command, so be it.

**Divine Kings’ Immortal Chariot Ritual**
The Master says: For all deliverance rites,
Use colored silk to fashion a purple chariot,
With two Divine Kings flanking it,
Five horses drawing it.
Place the departed’s tablet within the chariot,
After crossing the bridge, burn it.
Do not use the banner for summoning the dead,
For this banner was already burned during the deliverance rite.
Instead, replace it with a red banner,
Burn it at the Pool of Water.
Next, a yellow banner follows the chariot,
With a youth leading the way to cross the Heavenly Gate.
Then form the Five Emperors’ Mudra and burn it.

**Chariot-Burning Incantation**
By the Heavenly Worthy’s majestic power,
Deliver and save the souls of all beings.
Auspicious smoke seals the gates of death,
Fortunate clouds open the gates of life.
Return with the *qi* of Highest Heaven,
To restrain the *hun* of the Nine Heavens.
Harmoniously return to one body,
All becoming natural beings.
Able to ride the purple cloud chariot,
To ascend and pay homage to the Lord of Mud-Pill Palace.
The Three Realms’ primordial calamities are averted,
Forever escaping the ford of retribution.

**Sweet Dew Pool Talisman**
**Sweet Dew Divine Incantation**
Limpid, sweet dew,
Dripping, nectarous liquor.
For the virtuous, ghee and milk;
For the wicked, icy broth.
Nine Dark Realms’ soul-awareness,
Seven ancestors’ misfortunes dispelled.
The River of Love clears,
The Sea of Suffering shines.
Lonely souls do not drown,
Stagnant *po* remain unharmed.
By the Primordial True One’s decree,
Proclaimed to the ten directions.

Inscribe in cinnabar upon yellow silk with jade talismanic gestures. Before the Southern Palace, set a basin filled with water boiled from licorice, persimmon, and honey. Burn the talisman, invoke the incantation, and cast the ashes into the basin. First visualize the basin as a Frigid Pool; after burning the talisman and reciting the incantation, transform it in mind into Sweet Dew—this is called "shattering the Frigid Pool of Suffering to create the Sweet Dew Pool." Such is the ancestral method of the Numinous Treasure, bestowed by the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy upon Lady Wei of Southern Marchmount and Perfected Lord Xu for their practice. It delivers the souls within the pool, dissolving the sins of ten thousand kalpas.

**Prayer at the Pool’s Edge**
We bow in reverence: the round pool and square pond mirror the forms of Heaven and Earth. The Sweet Dew and Frigid Pool correspond to the omens of bliss and suffering. Thus, from Fengdu to the Yang Valley, waves ripple boundlessly; from the winding springs to the river’s source, depths stretch vast and wide. For the virtuous, it becomes ghee and honey; for the wicked, it turns to fire and scalding broth. Entering this River of Love, it is named the Sea of Desire. Yet if one clarifies the Five Turbidities, severs the Six Roots, retreats from the Ten Entanglements, and eliminates the Three Karmas, then one shall transform foul juices into Sweet Dew, convert the Frigid Pool into fragrant waters. The Nether Courts shall open in clarity, and sunken souls shall ascend in deliverance.

Today, we prepare the wondrous offerings of the Nine Dark Realms to rescue the numinous souls of the seven ancestors, universally aiding all sentient beings and universally bestowing upon the undeserving. Thus, we transform the waters of the Frigid Pool into the nectar of Sweet Dew, moistening the Nine Dark Realms and harmonizing the Ten Poles. Thereby, the *hun* and *shen* become pure, the *po* and consciousness revive, crossing the great Dharma Bridge to ascend the Crimson Mansion. We now invoke the empowering Sweet Dew Divine Incantation. Recite the incantation, burn the talisman, and visualize as before.

**Section on the Aims of Ritual Purification** – An Exegesis of the Numinous Treasure

The numinous pertains to yang: it has form yet lacks substance, unites with the Dao to attain truth, and takes shape above. In humans, it silently accords with the human spirit, transforming through thought in the heart—hence it is called *numinous*. The precious pertains to yin: it has both form and substance, transforms emptiness into solidity, and gathers form below. In humans, it nourishes the blood to form the body and congeals essence in the kidneys—hence it is called *precious*.

Thus, all things that come into being cannot but be born. For they are moved by the numinous to generate form; once form is complete, substance takes shape; once substance is formed, spirit arises—emerging from non-being into being. All things that come to an end cannot but perish. For as the precious scatters, substance withers; as substance withers, spirit departs; as spirit departs, form dissolves—passing from being into non-being.

The *Scripture of Virtue and Truth* states: From birth to death, the great transformation in humans encompasses four stages—infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated, the will unified, and harmony perfected; no external thing can harm it, and no virtue surpasses it. In youth and prime, blood and qi overflow, desires and thoughts arise in abundance; external things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts grow gentle, the body prepares for rest; no external thing takes precedence, and though one cannot fully preserve the wholeness of infancy, one may still compare favorably to the state of youth. In death, breath ceases, returning to the ultimate origin.

Thus, life arises from the numinous giving rise to the precious, while death results from the precious losing the numinous—this is the constant principle of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, the numinous and precious reside within the human body. As this scripture’s commentary states: "When the hundred spirits do not scatter, it is called *numinous*; when the singular qi is ever-present, it is called *precious*." If one can guard the spirit, nurture the qi, secure the precious, and refine the numinous, then at the time of dissolution, form and spirit transcend external things. Hence it is said: The Way of the divine immortals enables one to ascend the Nine Heavens and become a minister to the Jade Emperor.

**Secret Essentials for Harmonizing Heaven, Pacifying Earth, Protecting the State, and Securing the Family**
The *Aims* state: The Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure can, above, preserve the enduring existence of Heaven, avert the dimming of the sun and moon and the misalignment of the stars; below, they dispel calamities of the kalpa—war, fire, and flood—as well as the disasters of the yang-nine and bai-six, and remedy the monstrosities of mountains, rivers, pythons, and giant beasts. In their highest form, they encompass the inner refinement of truth and the Way of ascending with flesh and bone; at the intermediate level, they offer methods for achieving long life and transcending the world, as well as corpse-liberation; in their lesser applications, they possess the power to deliver the living and the dead, reviving corpses and restoring life. In the manifest realm, they command the winds and thunder, transforming through the numinous power of spontaneity; in the hidden realm, they summon and employ the myriad spirits, perceiving clearly the patterns of the Ten Heavens. Thus, the sages embody and constantly employ them, while the common people use them daily without awareness.

**Lineage Transmission**
The *Aims* state: The transmission of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure’s lineage was orally passed down from one perfected immortal to another after the five kalpas of primordial transformation, never committed to writing. For to reveal the workings of Heaven would invite celestial censure. As the saying goes: "Written texts are easily seen, but the lineage’s aims are rarely encountered." Those who meet with them in this age do so by virtue of past good deeds, and thus should cherish, revere, and honor them.

Jade Repository of Alliance in Perfection

**Principle States:**
On the day of receiving the precepts, within the oratory, one bows to the memorials of the Thirty-Two Heavens, bowing to one heaven each day, completing the thirty-two days. Thus is one made a Jade Repository of Alliance in Perfection. Having paid homage to the Thirty-Two Heavens in all four directions, one is then comparable to those bound by the Golden and Jade Repositories. The prohibitions of the Yellow Register are weighty; transgressions are examined without pardon. Hence, the Jade Repository. Like a repository of jade, it is to be treasured, cherished, and guarded.

**Thirty-Six Heavens Above**
**Principle States:**
When primal chaos first divided, the mysterious qi gave birth to the primordial, from one came two, and from two came the qi of origin, forming three qi. The Heaven of Pure Subtlety is the mysterious, the Heaven of Yu Remainder is the primordial, and the Heaven of Great Redness is the origin—one heaven giving rise to three heavens. Each heaven generates three qi, forming the Nine Heavens. The Heaven of Pure Subtlety gives rise to the Heavens of Yu Shan, Chan Shan, and Xu Yan; the Heaven of Yu Remainder gives rise to the Heavens of Dou Wei, Bu Jiao Le, and Ying Sheng; the Heaven of Great Redness gives rise to the Heavens of Fan Fu, Qing Ming, and Wu Xiang—these are the Nine Heavens. Each of the Nine Heavens generates three heavens, totaling twenty-seven heavens. Externally, excluding the Supreme August Yellow and Once-Heaven and the four formless heavens—Great Void, Great Release, Dragon Transformation, and Great Ultimate—these together form twenty-seven heavens. The Three Clarities and Three Heavens reside above the Nine Firmaments, constituting the Thirty-Six Heavens Above.

**Thirty-Six Earths Below**
**Principle States:**
Just as the heavens have the Nine Heavenly Lords, the earth has the Nine Mounds of Earthly Sovereigns. Each mound also possesses three qi—earth, water, and wind—each in one stratum, layered above and below. The first earth is called Moistened Hue, the second Glossy Hue, the third Stone-Fat Glossy Hue, the fourth Moist Gloss, the fifth Golden Millet Gloss, the sixth Adamantine Iron Gloss, the seventh Water-Restrained Gloss, the eighth Great Wind Gloss, and the ninth the Boundless Abyssal Formless Net Earth. Each of the nine mounds generates three qi, forming the Thirty-Six Earths Below. The thirty-six yang qi of the heavens above constitute the Thirty-Six Heavenly Lords, while the thirty-six yin qi of the earths below constitute the Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns. Beneath the nine mounds lie three qi—the qi of wind, marsh, and abyss—vast and unyielding emptiness enveloped by wind and marsh. This is the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s Brahman Wind, harder than true metal, also called the adamantine wind. It upholds the nine mounds, bearing all heavens, floating high yet not dispersing, suspended yet not falling, connecting above to the Great Network—such is the nature of the Dao.

**Illuminating the Three Treasures**
**Principle States:**
In the Great Rites of Numinous Treasure, what is revered is the Most High Boundless Great Dao, the Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures, and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious. These are called the Three Treasures. As set forth in the *Guangcheng Fast Regulations*, all directions adhere to this, comprising seventeen characters in total, without variation. Recently, some have presumptuously altered and added to these, incorporating them into the *Simplified Serenity Rituals*—this is incorrect.

**The Most High Boundless Great Dao**
**Principle States:**
The Boundless Great Dao, when the singular qi first divided, was transmitted by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Original Beginning to the Supreme Dao Lord, who then passed it to the Later Sage Lord Lao. The Primordial Beginning was the teacher of the Dao Lord, and the Dao Lord was the teacher of Lord Lao, who descended to propagate the teachings in the world—this is the Boundless Great Dao.

**The Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**
**Principle States:**
The Great Rites of Numinous Treasure constitute the ancestral teachings of the Three Caverns. After the opening of the five kalpas, the Jade Purity Cavern of Perfection, the Highest Purity Cavern of Mystery, and the Supreme Purity Cavern of Divinity, along with the Four Auxiliary Talismans and Registers, were all formed from the vermilion-script jade characters of incantations and scriptures. The *Great Cavern* in thirty-nine chapters elucidates the body of primal chaos from the opening of the five kalpas and expounds the method of harmonizing the three qi into one, bestowed upon the Jade Dawn Dao Lord. Subsequently, across the heavens, the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures of Numinous Treasure* were expounded, completing the scriptures of the world. In every land of the ten directions and the celestial offices therein, there exist the true writings and precious talismans of the *Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures*. The common saying refers to the twelve divisions of the *Cavern of Perfection*, the twelve divisions of the *Cavern of Mystery*, and the twelve divisions of the *Cavern of Divinity*, totaling thirty-six divisions. Yet few know that each has its own distinct titles.

*Scriptures of the Yellow Court*: one division, one hundred thousand scrolls

**The Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center**
The宗旨 states: After the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning established the teachings, in the first year of the Supreme Sovereign’s reign, the Five Kalpas unfolded simultaneously. The Five Phases took full form, the Five *qi* were complete, and the manifold Perfected Ones were transformed into being. The various immortals, arising within the Five Kalpas, were transformed from the essence of the Mysterious Center, and the essence within the Mysterious—all were of the Supreme Sovereign’s former kalpa, styled the Five Kalpas. From within them was transformed the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, who received the quintessence of the Five *qi*. Together with the Celestial Perfected Sovereign, they assembled the clouds into chapters, the dragon embryos and stone effulgences, the millions of talismanic writings, the Three Divisions and Ten Precepts—all became the orthodox texts. Thus did the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center first establish the teachings.

**Clarifying the Numbers of the Five Directions’ *Qi***
The East: nine *qi* of *renzi* Wood, the time-number of arising, reaching the ninth position of *gengshen*, where the yang spirits gather.
The South: three *qi* of *wuzi* Fire, the time-number of soaring flames, reaching the third position of *gengyin*, where the yang spirits gather.
The West: seven *qi* of *jiazi* Metal, the time-number of stern execution, reaching the seventh position of *gengwu*, where the yang spirits gather.
The North: five *qi* of *bingzi* Water, the time-number of the mysterious essence, reaching the fifth position of *gengchen*, where the yang spirits gather.
The Center: one *qi* of *gengzi* Earth, the time-number of profound humility, occupying the first position, where one *qi* of yang spirits gathers.

**Clarifying the Great Expansion Numbers of the Ten Directions**
East: nine *qi*; South: three *qi*; West: seven *qi*; North: five *qi*; Center: twelve *qi*. Excluding the void number of Earth, this refers to the lower direction.
Southeast: six *qi*; Southwest: two *qi*; Northeast: four *qi*; Northwest: eight *qi*; Upper Direction: one *qi*; Lower Direction: one *qi*. In total, eighty-five *qi*. Excluding the one *qi* of Heaven’s Origin, the two *qi* of the Sun and Moon, and the one *qi* of Earth’s Origin, this accords with the ninety-nine of the Central States, the yang number.

**Clarifying the Distribution of the Nine *Qi***
The *宗旨* states: The various methods record only the Five *qi*, according to the Five Directions and Five Thearchs’ kalpas. There are nine-colored circular images, yet without distinguishing the patterns of ingress, egress, and transformation, one cannot communicate with the Perfected or summon the spirits. Here, we provide diagrams and categories.

**Diagram of the Five *Qi* Transforming into Nine *Qi***
We humbly observe that the teachings of the August Void originated in primordial antiquity. The wondrous Dao opened its radiance, and divine texts descended into the world, sometimes manifesting in accordance with the times, their affairs transmitted through succession. From the middle antiquity onward, the canonical writings became vast and abundant. By the Jin and Song dynasties, Master Lu of Tranquil Simplicity first clarified the origins of transmission and descent, distinguishing the Three Caverns and Four Supplements, examining and collating the various canons, and compiling the liturgical rites. Thereafter, these were promulgated far and wide, the liturgical methods widely disseminated, the scriptural injunctions arranged in order, and the sequence established.

By the Tang, Zhang of Pure Capital and Myriad Blessings further edited and compiled, gradually refining the canonical models. After the mid-Tang, Master Du Guangting of Broad Accomplishment thoroughly investigated the thirty-six divisions of scriptures, collating and annotating the ancient and modern canons, exerting great effort in editing and proofreading. Thus, the liturgical methods reached their full fruition. Yet every single word and method, from beginning to end, derived from the scriptures’ authority—the twenty-four grades of ancient liturgy.

Master Guangting’s discourse states that the *Huanglu* [Yellow Register] encompasses both life and death, uniting the short-lived and the long-lived in shared fortune. From the state down to the common people, all may cultivate and uphold it. It is subordinate to the Middle Officials of the Lower Era, governing the myriad spirits, and is connected to the Nine Treasuries. Its merits and virtues are profound and weighty, benefiting both the living and the dead. Thus, he compiled forty fascicles of liturgical methods, titled *The Yellow Register Liturgical Canon*. In this way, the altar’s legacy and ritual forms, the morning and evening observances, all followed a single path from ancient times to the present. Its liturgical texts were solemn and well-ordered, its canonical models clear and flowing, elucidating ancient principles and illuminating future generations. The liturgical methods reached their ultimate refinement, beyond which nothing could be added.

In the first fascicle of this canon, the regulations for the Altar Officers state: The Dharma Master should bear the registers and insignia of the Three Caverns. Next, those bearing the registers of the Cavernous Mystery may perform the rites. For the liturgical methods derive from the *Lingbao* [Numinous Treasure] scriptures, belonging to the Cavernous Mystery division. From the announcement of the liturgy’s commencement to the concluding offerings, dispersal of the altar, and thanksgiving, all are fully provided in Guangting’s canon. In later generations, though the liturgical canons proliferated, drawing from the various scriptures of the Three Caverns, most derived from the Twelve Divisions of the Cavernous Mystery. If one performs liturgical affairs, talismans, incantations, memorials, and official documents not recorded in the canon, these have, since the Tang, been subsumed under the *Lingbao* Great Dharma. The foundational text of this Dharma centers on the first fascicle of the *Upper Grade of Salvation*, known as the *Great Dharma of the Upper Clarity and Numinous Treasure*. Though concise, its profundities are inexhaustible.

The scriptures say: When the stellar lodges are in disarray and the sun and moon lose their dusk, one should perform the liturgy, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When the ruler of the state faces calamity and warfare arises on all sides, one should perform the liturgy, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When pestilence spreads and the people perish in great numbers, one should perform the liturgy, burn incense, and recite the scriptures. When teachers and friends pass away, one should perform the liturgy, burn incense, and recite the scriptures.

In Guangting’s canon, the *Huanglu* rites are employed to eliminate disasters for the state, pray for blessings for the people, deliver teachers and friends, universally save the souls of the departed, petition for blessings from the Three Origins, and connect with the ascent of the Nine Ancestors. All these are called *Huanglu*. Each has its liturgical methods and rites, derived from the *Lingbao* scriptures. Thus, the origins and transmissions compiled herein relate to a vast number of scriptures, while the liturgical talismans and methods are all contained in this book.

The ancient methods of *Lingbao* begin with upholding the precepts and deeply comprehending the fundamental scriptures, refining *qi* through ingestion, preserving the spirit through inner cultivation, and gathering one’s radiance for internal alchemy. Only then may one save the world and deliver beings, assist the upright and expel the perverse, establish virtue and merit, and rescue the hidden and ferry the departed. At this stage, the liturgical rites must be performed—this is to fully manifest what one has cultivated and extend it to the world, following the proper sequence of application.

In the established canons of *Guangting*, the *Huanglu* rites hold the highest importance. The old methods of *Lingbao* are also all classified under *Huanglu* liturgical ranks.

The Mysterious Master said: "To deliver the seven ancestors and rescue those in the three wretched realms, the *Huanglu* Grand Rite is foremost. When intending to perform deliverance, one must first receive the petition from the sponsor of the rite, then carefully assess whether the person is filial, benevolent, loyal, upright, sincere, and earnest, whether they have taken refuge and hold faith in the liturgical methods, and whether they are fit to carry out the rites. Only then may their petition be accepted and their observance of the rite permitted. They should be instructed on the ritual implements and offerings required for the rite, so that these may be prepared in advance and nothing be lacking when the time comes.

Next, an auspicious site is chosen to establish the altar, preferably in grotto-heavens and blessed lands, famous mountains and pure abodes, sacred altars and Daoist temples, or serene residences. Sites that have witnessed warfare or battles, slaughterhouses, prisons, places of childbirth with blood pollution, tombs, or other defiled and inauspicious locations are to be avoided—only such are deemed auspicious.

Next, an auspicious day is divined for announcing the rite, preferably coinciding with the Three Origins, Eight Festivals, Five La Days, Ten Straight Days, or Three Assemblies. If the rite is dedicated specifically to delivering the mysterious ancestors, the days should align with the departed’s seventh seven-day period, hundredth day, major and minor anniversaries, distant death anniversaries, or birthdays. For universal deliverance, the days should coincide with *gengshen*, *jiazi*, the Four Beginnings, Ten Straight Days, Heavenly Grace, Heavenly Amnesty, or other highly auspicious days, ideally overlapping with festival days, La Days, or Assemblies. A single auspicious day alone is insufficient for initiating the rite.

The announcement of the rite marks the inception of intent, with petitions conveyed to the Three Origins, beginning from the chosen auspicious day. The sponsor brings the ritual offerings and submits a written petition to the masters’ gate, bowing to invite the liturgist. Once the master receives the petition, they lead the sponsor to the Dao altar, where reverent incense is burned to make the announcement. If there is a written petition, it is presented; the master then commands fellow disciples and like-minded practitioners to assemble. Fellow disciples refer to those who share the same path, altar, and teacher; like-minded practitioners are those who share the same aspirations to universally aid the living and the dead. If unsuitable persons are involved, harmonious *qi* will not arise, and the merit of the rite will be compromised.

From the day the rite is announced, the master, the sponsor, disciples, fellow disciples, and like-minded practitioners enter the pure chamber to face the rite, abstaining from external affairs. The duration may be a hundred days, ninety days, seventy days, forty-nine days, or thirty-two days, during which they focus single-mindedly on deliverance. The scale of the rite—whether grand or modest—is determined by the number of departed souls to be delivered, with all preparations made in full to avoid deficiencies when the time arrives.

An auspicious day is chosen to establish the sacred altar. At the center of the altar, the Three Treasures’ positions are set, adorned with canopies and precious coverings. The divine scriptures are placed in the middle, while within the inner altar, incense tables for the Ten Directions are arranged, with flowers, lamps, and ritual implements arranged according to the proper method. Diagrams show six tents positioned to the left and right before the altar. A model is placed in the center with the Nine Dark Realms’ spirit lamps, or above the Heavenly Gate. Around the altar’s perimeter, lamps are lit according to the method. Diagrams depict the southeast of the altar adorned with the Revolving Radiance Wheel Lamp, the northeast with the Nine Prisons Lamp, and the rear center with the ritual arena, where the Emperor’s throne is placed in the middle, flanked by ranks of left and right attendant sages, with incense, flowers, and ritual tables arranged properly. To the left front of the arena, a separate position is set for the Three Masters of Orthodox Unity. In the southeast of the altar, the Hall of Reception is established, facing the altar from afar, serving as the position for the sponsor’s nine *xuan* and seven ancestors. Additionally, twelve stepped platforms are erected to the left and right before the altar, each assigned to manage specific affairs.

Before the altar rites commence, memorials and petitions are presented within the ritual arena. Outside the altar, positions are set for the local earth god, the territorial deity, the attending officials, and the supervising altar spirits.

Thirty-two, twenty-four, or fourteen days prior—depending on the number of departed souls to be delivered—petitions are submitted to the celestial realms. A vermilion memorial invoking the Heavenly Savior is presented, establishing the Hall of Azure Radiance for Salvation. The Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands are proclaimed, and the Azure Mystery Precious Banner is erected. Models show the rites of covenant and alliance with the Three Clarities and Four Emperors, the Five Masters of the Eastern Ultimate, the Three Officials, the Three Bureaus of the Heavenly Pivot, the Ten Heavens of the Three Realms, the Five Marchmounts and Nine Provinces, the Nine Earths and Ten Paths, the Northern Capital’s Underworld Courts, the City Gods and Year Gods, the local earth deities, and other relevant offices. Petitions are issued to summon the attending merit officials, direct talismans, and local earth gods according to the proper method.

Next, a memorial invoking the White Horse and Plain Carriage is presented, and the Banner of Covenant is erected to inform the profound heavens. A model shows a separate space designated as the Scripture-Recitation Hall, where fellow disciples and like-minded practitioners gather to purify body and mind. Daily, they diligently recite the *Lingbao* scriptures, such as the *Upper Chapters on Delivering the People and Nurturing the Spirit*, the *Golden Register for Delivering Lives and Attaining the Dao to Save from Suffering*, and other scriptures. They perform the rites of repentance for the Nine Dark Realms and the Heavenly Court, recite the Sweet Dew Divine Mantra, and invoke the sacred titles of the Jade Emperor, the Azure Mystery, and the Lords of the Ten Directions, accumulating merit through repetition. The merit of printing and burning paper offerings is limited.

Ten, seven, or three days prior—depending on the circumstances—the Nine Clarities’ Supreme Emperor, the Eastern and Southern Ultimates, the True Kings of the Nine Dark Realms and Vermilion Mound Grotto-Abyss, the Lords of the Ten Directions and Five Elders, the Heavenly Worthies and Emperors of the Thirty-Two Heavens of the Nine Empyreans, the Wooden Duke and Metal Mother of the Shen Day Palace, the Nine Luminaries, the Five Dippers of the North, South, East, West, and Center, the Three Officials and Four Sages, the Five Masters, the Supervising Masters of Orthodox Unity, the Three Bureaus and Five Offices, the Northern and Southern Courts, the Upper Office of Nanchang, the Heavenly Bureaus of the Nine Heavens, the Heavenly Perfected and August Persons, the Flying Heavenly Spirit-Kings, the Perfected of the Ten Ultimates, the Perfected Immortals of Talismans, Methods, and Scriptural Registers, the Water Palaces of the Five Marchmounts and Four Waterways, the Fengdu Earthly Courts, the Nine Rivers and Nine Ramparts, the Grotto-Heaven Immortal Officials, the Year Gods, the City Gods of the respective prefectures, commanderies, and counties, the local territorial deities, the various Daoist and prison officials, the Nine Provinces’ earth gods, the Lord of the Yellow Springs, the water and land passes, the boundary deities of the Five Directions, the dark passes and hidden paths, the Great Gods of the Five Roads, the Fengdu Marchmounts and Waterways, the underworld clerks and officials, the supervising altar spirits, the attached officials and generals of the respective bureaus, the local earth gods and life-mandate officials—all relevant places are thoroughly and meticulously prepared.

Furthermore, memorials shall be submitted to the Supervisors of Waterways and Thunderous True Lords, and writs dispatched to the Year God Kings, the Wind and Rain Dragon Deities, the City Gods and Village Earth Gods, the Mountain Forest Chiefs and Han Immortals, as well as all local administrators of the Marchmounts, the Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands, and the various Celestial Immortal Bureaus. From each, divine soldiers shall be dispatched to guard the ritual altar, dispel inauspicious influences, prolong clear skies, prevent wind and rain or overcast conditions, and secure timely fair weather.

Local territorial deities shall be selected and commissioned to stand vigil at the altar, preventing misfortune and restraining evil, overseeing the covenant of the fast, and rebuking those who violate the Dao. Next, proceed to the Divine Tiger Hall’s Pass, summoning the Divine Tiger Officials, Generals, and the ranks of clerks and soldiers. Establish the Yin-Yang Dual Altars and the Eight-Gated Altar, issue jade writs, and include the souls of the deceased to be delivered. Present the writs to the Two Sagely Jade Maidens, the Messengers of the Three Departments, the Envoys of the Two Prisons, and the summoning officials. Charge them to bear the jade writs and, in advance, report to the Water and Earth Bureaus to trace the roots of the delivered souls, ensuring their presence at the altar to manifest karmic response and await the rites of the fast. Prepare and erect the standards for the Ascension of Spirits and the Return of Radiance, and once the writs have been duly submitted, proceed in order to inscribe and confer the talismans of liberation.

Seven days prior—or five, four, or three days before—the ritual arena shall witness the prostration and presentation of the *Precious Chapter for Dispelling Defilement to the Mysterious Heavens*. Following the prescribed rites, proceed day by day to present the *Chapter for Amnesty in Fengdu*, proclaim the *Edict of Amnesty from Fengdu*, the *Edict of Talismanic Mandate from the Primordial Beginning*, or the *Talisman of Salvation from Suffering* and the *Talisman for Delivering Souls from Darkness*, invoking the Dragon. In due course, present the *Precious Chapter for Opening the Roads*, proclaim the *Precious Edict of the Jade Emperor* and the *Edict for the Governance of Earthly Deities*, perform the *Rite for Opening the Five Paths*, and release the souls of the departed.

As the fast approaches its appointed time, present the *Precious Chapter for Purification and Alchemical Transformation*. One or two days prior, assemble the officials to ascend the altar and rehearse the dignified rites. On the day of the fast, at the hour of noon, the bell shall sound. The altar officials, fast officials, and ritual attendants shall invite the Dharma Master to the Hall of Serene Silence to assign roles, distribute written duties, and stand in order according to rank. The Dharma Master shall take his seat, while the sponsor performs the Nine Bows thrice repeated, kneels thrice, and offers words of entreaty thrice, beseeching the Master to ascend the altar. With formal assent, the Master is acclaimed and led to the high seat, where incense is offered, the seat consecrated, and the covenant initiated. Descending, the Master inscribes the covenant document, and the officiants, bearing the placard of dignified rites, lead the procession from the hall to the outer altar’s Earth Gate, where the altar is purified with consecrated water.

The Dharma Master, leading the assembled officials, each holding sprigs of purifying water, shall recite the incantations of Heaven and Earth, circumambulate the altar in order, and sprinkle it with purifying libations. Once the altar is ritually secured, proceed according to the prescribed rites. First, present the *Talisman of Inviting Light* to summon the Solar Fire, lighting the Primordial Beginning’s foremost candle. From beginning to end, the flame must be continuously maintained, never extinguished. Next, before the altar, erect six tents: the Tent of the Mysterious Master, the Tent of the Five Emperors, the Tent of the Heavenly Master, the Tent of the Three Masters, the Tent of the Three Officials, and the Tent of the Fast Overseers. In each, invite the sagely presences, offer libations, present memorials and petitions, read the covenant document, and advance the spirit money and horses, all to be consumed in the flames.

Proceed to establish the halls and steps for the various bureaus, following the prescribed texts, then return to the Hall of Serene Silence for a brief rest. Next, proceed to the Hall of the Underworld Officials, where offerings are set for the Ten Kings, and the rites for the Ten Kings are acclaimed. As dusk falls, the Dharma Master ascends the altar to distribute the lamps. Following the text, the lamp attendants light the lamps in proper order, ensuring they illuminate the interior and exterior completely, before retiring to the hall.

The following preparations shall mirror the previous: with dignified rites, the Dharma Master is respectfully invited to ascend the altar for the overnight invocation. Acclaimed and led from the hall, the procession pays homage to the six tents—first the Five Emperors, then the Three Masters, the Fast Overseers, the Three Officials, the Heavenly Master, and finally the Tent of the Mysterious Master. The officials stand in ordered ranks, while the sponsor offers incense and presents the petition box, conveying the intent of the fast. The Master receives the petition and, chanting praises and leading the procession, arrives at the outer gate of the ritual arena. The two ranks stand in order at the foot of the altar, where the Master offers incense and makes invocation. The chief attendant recites the petition to open the altar, which is then burned outside the altar. With the sounding of bells, jade chimes, and gongs, the Master kneels to present the *Scroll for Rolling Up the Curtain*, following the text to prostrate and present the *Memorial for Communicating with the True*. Ascending the altar according to the rites, the Master arrives at the Earth Gate, recites the secret incantation, and enters. The officials follow into the central altar, standing in order, while the Master alone ascends the inner altar. Offering incense and conducting the rites, the Master performs the overnight invocation, unfurling the true scriptures, proclaiming the petition to the Divine Officials, or presenting the *Words for Establishing the Altar*. The precepts are expounded, ranks conferred, prohibitions declared, and longings for return expressed. Errors are confessed and corrected, and the rites for honoring the lamps are performed.

The *Rite for the Salvation of Suffering Youths* is proclaimed, the *Nine Yang Talisman* invoked, and the lamps for the Nine Calamities and Nine Ramparts are repented before. The *Rite for Summoning Spirits to Bathe and Pay Homage* is performed, with incantations for the offering of food as prescribed. The *Rite of Tenfold Repentance* is proclaimed. On the first day of the main fast, the circuit of the Way is performed, paying homage to the six tents. Following the rites, the three daily circuits are conducted, incense offered for the Six Perfections, the scriptures recited ten times, and each morning the spirits are led to the altar’s base to pay homage to the Three Treasures, repenting and confessing transgressions. The incense burner is raised, the palace exited, and the souls led to the altar, where the great thanksgiving is completed and the spirits returned to their positions.

In the quiet of night, before the Emperor on High, the *Talisman and Edict for the Staff of Authority* is requested. Proceeding to the lamps of the Nine Prisons, the *True Talisman for Breaking Open Hell* is proclaimed, and the repentance before the lamps is performed according to the rites. The talisman is issued, and the staff wielded to break open the prisons—performing this at the first watch of the night is especially efficacious. The lamps of the Nine Dark Realms are honored, and at the Lamp of Returning Radiance, the *True Talisman for Delivering Souls from Darkness* is proclaimed, repenting before the lamps to break open the prisons.

If the summoning of souls and related rites were not performed on the first night, they shall be conducted on the night of the main fast. On the second day of the main fast, the three daily circuits of the Way are performed as on the first day. That night, at the lamps of Fengdu, the *Green Mystery Talisman for Breaking Fengdu* is proclaimed, and the repentance before the lamps is performed according to the rites. The *Universal Summons of the Nine Springs and Six Paths* is issued, calling forth the lonely souls, who are then bathed, clothed, and led to pay homage. Following the text, they are guided to the outer precincts, where the *Unobstructed Night Fast* is conducted.

The rites proceed with the untying of knots and the release of bonds, followed by the transmission of talismans and the conferral of precepts. The rites may then proceed directly to the refinement and deliverance of souls, or the souls may be led to the Hall of Gathered Spirits to await the refinement and transformation of the deceased. The outer precincts may also be burned in offering.

On the third day of the main fast, the circuits of the Way are performed thrice daily, as on the second day. Alternatively, during the evening audience, the circuits of the Way may be performed while presenting the *Green Petition* to beseech blessings. After the audience, the altar is ascended, and the *Precious Chapters for the Ascension and Deliverance of Departed Spirits* are presented. The announcement is made to the various passes of the heavens, and the lamps of the Thirty-Two Heavens are lit. In the stillness of night, the rites of refinement and transformation are solemnly performed to transmute the departed souls. Each is instructed in the wondrous precepts of the Nine Perfected, and the *Talisman of Longevity* is proclaimed. The *Ordinance of True Deliverance* is bestowed, and the yellow-robed investiture of the Dao is conferred, along with the *Register of Southern Florescence*, the *Ordinance of Longevity and the Yellow Register*, and other such documents. The *Dragon-Invoking Incantation* is recited to break the register, and the merit memorial is read aloud. The Three Corpses are severed, and the Five Passes are transcended. The rites proceed with the invocation at the Pavilion of Flowing Fire, the ascension upon the Dharma Bridge, and the presentation of documents to the guardian deities of the Heavenly Gates, who escort and protect the departed spirits as they ascend to the Crimson Palace.

The souls are then sent forth, the wooden tablets burned, and the outer precincts consumed in flames along with the scriptures, paper money, and other offerings. The *Grass-Dragon Lads* and other attendants perform the rite of releasing living beings. On the fourth day, at dawn, the memorials are prepared and the feast is set to invite the deities, though according to ancient rites, this may be omitted. The Three Treasures and the Supreme Emperor are petitioned, and the Three Officials are addressed. On the appointed day, the dragon tablets are distributed, and the rites proceed in due order: the altar is ascended, the *True Writs of the Five Directions* are invoked, and the memorials of merit and repentance are presented. The altar is then dismantled, the seats cleared, and the earth tablets and dragon tablets are cast. That night, within the ritual arena, the feast is held according to the rites. The *Green Petition* of gratitude is presented, and the memorials of merit—including the *Cart, Brush, Paper Money, and Horses*—are offered. The deities are sent forth from the altar, the six curtains are drawn back, and the memorial of gratitude is proclaimed. Next, the ritual master is approached to offer thanks, and the *Memorial of Gratitude to the Mysterious Master* is presented to conclude the altar rites. The precepts are returned, and the master’s duties are fulfilled. The banners are withdrawn, and the troops of the Eastern Peak and other realms are dismissed. The City God is memorialized to oversee the altar’s closure, and the ritual implements are returned. The merits are reported to the local earth deities and other officials, who are then dismissed according to their ranks. Finally, the brushes, horses, and other ritual items are burned, the ritual master and officials return to the oratory, the master is sent off with gratitude, and the disciples bow in thanks. The rites conclude with mutual congratulations on their completion.

On the appointed day, the dragon tablets and memorials are cast into the sacred springs of the grotto-heavens. When the merit is complete and the fruits are fulfilled, the Three Officials submit their recommendations, the Five Emperors record the names, and all the heavens rejoice. The merit extends to both the hidden and the manifest, and the departed ascend to the ranks of immortality.

According to ancient rites, after the presentation of the memorials and the casting of the tablets, the feast is held to welcome the deities. The deities are then sent forth from the altar, the banners are withdrawn, the master is sent off, the precepts are returned, and the duties concluded. The officials are dismissed, and the altar is dismantled. Such is the proper order of the rites, which must not be transgressed. Whether the rites span five, seven, nine, fourteen, or even forty-nine days—or as few as three days—every step must be followed meticulously, in strict accordance with the sequence. However, as the regulations of past and present often differ, there is no fixed standard to rely upon. Here, the essential principles of the fast are distilled, their rhythms and structures laid bare. Where they do not conflict with ancient precedents, they are to be followed in accordance with their meaning. To deviate from the proper sequence is not only to risk violating the statutes but also to invite the mockery of the underworld officials. The Three Officials will wield their brushes, the Four Departments will investigate, and all efforts will be in vain, labor without reward.

Moreover, the *Five Elders’ Original Practices* state that even those who have merely glimpsed the *Yellow Register* thrice will not fall into hell—how much more so for those who personally undertake the great teachings to universally deliver both the hidden and the manifest, even if their numbers do not exceed ten? In heaven above and earth below, among the immortals, spirits, and gods of the Three Realms, and all creatures that fly, crawl, or bear shells, none are beyond the reach of your virtue and power. The Demon Kings bow in reverence and submit their recommendations, the Supreme Emperor rejoices and celebrates, the Three Officials record your merit, and the Five Emperors list your deeds. The Patriarchs bestow imperial favors, and golden talismans fly to the celestial palaces. Clouds of cinnabar and radiance descend, the Seven Ancestors are rescued from the Northern Palace, and the Nine Lineages are delivered from the Register of the Dead. Your body and flesh are transformed into immortality, and both spirit and form ascend to the wondrous Dao. You swallow the golden elixir, wear the immortal registers, and ascend to the Three Heavens in broad daylight, accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders. According to your merit, you are granted the ranks of the Perfected: some attain the position of *Shangqing Perfected*, others the title of *Jade Clarity Immortal Elder*, or the office of *Left Minister of the Great Ultimate*, where they gain profound enlightenment and universally deliver all beings from the uninterrupted hells. Such is the fruition of merit and virtue. You must strive diligently and devote yourself wholeheartedly to the practice.

The *Two Rites of the Ten Kings and the Lads* are hereby made clear.

As the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* states: In the first month after a person begins to receive the embryo, it is called the "womb," and the first yang spirit descends to generate the first hun-soul. In the second month, it is called the "embryo," and the second yang spirit descends to form the second hun-soul. In the third month, the third yang spirit descends to complete the three hun-souls. Once the three hun-souls are whole, the seven po-souls emerge in the seventh month. By the ninth month, the spirit spreads and qi fills the body, voice and spirit are fully formed, and birth separates the form into a human being. At birth, the yang number is nine nines; at death, the yin number is seven sevens. When the seven sevens are complete, the seven po-souls all depart the body, ascending to the Heavenly Courts to report the person’s sins and blessings. After a hundred days, the cycle of yin and yang reaches its limit. When the first hun-soul departs, it is called "the end of weeping"; after three hundred and sixty days, the spirit and qi renew their movement. When the second hun-soul departs, after two years and seven hundred and twenty days, the spirit and qi complete their cycle and the wheel turns anew. When the third hun-soul departs, it is called "the great auspice," and after seven hundred and twenty days, the yin and yang spirits leave the corpse. This follows the seventy-two numbers, with yin and yang each comprising thirty-six. Yet people today merely sing beautiful songs, unaware of their origin or the merit and virtue they convey. The *Rites of the Lads* comprise ten sections, and the *Rites of the Ten Kings* include ten courts—how profound!

The method states: During the seven sevens and the hundred days, the lesser and greater auspices, one should seek repentance and remorse. By atoning for the transgressions and faults of the deceased, dissolving the sins of their former life, and performing various meritorious deeds, one broadly delivers the six paths and four births. Through the power of these meritorious deeds, the Black Register is burned, and the deceased is reborn into the human world.

**Refining the Form and Maintaining Practice**
If one wishes to enter the oratory to align the primordial, approach the altar to perform rites, fly the spirit to pay homage to the Emperor, or present petitions in mourning to refine and deliver the deceased souls, yet remains in a state of common impurity with a body mired in defilement and spirits in obscurity, how can one communicate with the Supreme Mystery, ascend to save the dark underworld, or perform deeds that benefit others? One must first refine and transform one’s own form according to the method before applying it. Only then can one perform audience rites and summon spirits, achieving success in all undertakings. Thus may the dark paths be opened and the departed souls be delivered. This method may be practiced during the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the four seasons, the days of *gengshen* and *jiazi*, one’s own life-destiny days, the last and first days of the lunar month, when ascending the altar to perform rites, or when entering defiled places.

The principle states: The method of refining the form begins by entering the oratory, burning incense, sitting upright, concentrating the spirit, and knocking the teeth thirty-six times. Calm the qi and visualize one’s body as withered wood, containing the five viscera, six bowels, large and small intestines, and the jade script of the hands. At noon, extract them, ignite the four mountain fires along with the wind, and imagine the firelight like red threads emerging from the heart to burn the withered wood and all objects in one’s dwelling. Next, exhale through the nose as if the wind scatters dust. Then visualize a great flood washing everything away until nothing remains. Next, contemplate the true qi of the five directions and five colors gradually descending into the Mysterious Valley, growing from small to large, coalescing into an infant. Within it, the five viscera and six bowels are fully formed, and as it grows, it becomes a Perfected One, clad in dignified attire. The sun is to the left and the moon to the right, removed from the corners of the eyes to illuminate both pupils with radiant light. Guide the Azure Dragon within the liver to emerge from the left ear, the White Tiger within the lungs to emerge from the right ear, the Vermilion Bird within the heart to emerge from the mouth, and the Dark Warrior within the kidneys to emerge from both feet, all arrayed clearly to the left and right. The Dipper’s mouth covers the head, and its handle points to the earth. Next, roll the tongue to the left nine times, swallow a mouthful of saliva, and visualize it as red cinnabar entering the abdomen. From the great vertebra at the nape, it rises above the neck, emitting nine-colored light that covers the head. Then press the central script, circulate the twelve palaces, open the eyes, rise, and approach the altar to perform the rites.

**Burning Incense**
Incense is not mere wood but the eight celestial incenses of the Supreme Perfection: the incense of the Dao, the incense of virtue, the incense of non-action, the incense of spontaneity, the incense of purity, the incense of wondrous penetration, the incense of numinous treasure and wisdom, and the incense that transcends the Three Realms.

The incense of the Dao is the pure incense of the heart. The incense of virtue is the spirit. The incense of non-action is the intent. The incense of purity is the body. When one’s heart, spirit, intent, and body are unified and undistracted, bowing and rising while contemplating above, one will surely reach the Supreme Clarity. To wash the body free of dust and make the *talu* (cinnabar field) clear is called spontaneity. When the spirit is not scattered and the intent commands the spirit, the heart focuses single-mindedly on serving the Azure Vault as if standing near the sovereign. If the body avoids defilement and the four incenses harmonize to return to the round image, how can one worry that prayers for blessings will go unanswered?

The incense of wondrous penetration is the circulation of the spirit to present memorials at the Golden Gates of the Three Heavens. The incense of numinous treasure and wisdom arises when the heart is settled and the spirit is whole, contemplating and moving the Three Realms so that the myriad spirits descend to the court—this is it. To transcend the Three Realms, one contemplates the Jade Capital externally, circulates the spirit to meet the Dao, and omits nothing. This summons the perfected beings of the eight directions, the radiant numinous treasure and wisdom—such is this Dao. It responds to the four blessings and applies to the self. Burning incense with fire embodies the pure sincerity of the Dao and non-action. Using fire to ignite fire expresses sincerity from the heart. May the ascending smoke communicate one’s wishes and invoke the response of the true and numinous.

At the outset of burning incense, the practitioner has fifteen incense talismans to be used according to the occasion, each with its own incantation and method.

**Inviting and Descending the Talismans and Declarations of the Perfected**
The principle states: Whenever one intends to issue talismans or declarations, since they are written by mortal hands, one must first invite their descent before they can be proclaimed. The method of invitation is as follows: Place the talisman or declaration before the altar of the Supreme Emperor. The practitioner burns incense, bows three times, kneels, and presents the memorial. With both hands, form the Ten Heavenly Mudras at the Heavenly Court above, then form the Mudra of Jade Clarity, gently knock the teeth seven times, and circulate the light of the sun and moon in the eyes. Direct it upward to the Heavenly Court, wheeling it to illuminate the practitioner’s body. Within the light of the sun and moon, visualize the Primordial Celestial August One, appearing as a round luminosity. Then emit the radiance from both ears, merging it with the light of the sun and moon.

Next, according to rank, the practitioner makes a formal memorial to the Primordial Celestial August One, earnestly stating the purpose of the retreat and entreating the opening of the Purple Yang Jade Writ to proclaim and descend the specific talisman, which is then bestowed for the practitioner’s proclamation and enactment. Whether for breaking open the dark prisons, refining the departed souls, summoning retrieval, or burning and transforming, the prayer is made as desired. Upon completing the invocation, the secret incantation is recited three times, silently without sound.

**Incantation for Inviting the Descent of the Void and Secret:**
*Supreme and Vast, the Great Possession,*
*Myriad spirits of Jade Clarity.*
*Cloud-light treasure talismans,*
*Universally descend upon the imperial court.*
*Hasten, hasten, as the Primordial Celestial August One commands!*

Visualize the Supreme Emperor emitting a ray of multicolored radiance, infusing the treasure talisman, piercing through it like cloud talismans and rosy clouds flowing with golden hues, resplendently illuminating all above. Again, form the Ten Heavenly Mudras, gathering and directing the qi above. Then form the Mudra of Jade Clarity, gazing with the eyes to draw in the qi, absorbing the august presence within the light of the sun and moon before oneself, merging it directly into one’s own form to become one. Only then knock the teeth three times, swallow the saliva once, and bestow the proclamation to the left and right for enactment.

**Incantation for Dispatch:**
Universally proclaim to the boundless divine realms of the Three Realms, the subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources. Liberate the ancestors and karmic kin of countless kalpas, swiftly expunge their sin registers, eradicate their evil roots. They must not be detained or forced into ghostly throngs. By the Primordial Celestial August One’s talismanic command, may they ascend at once. In the Northern Capital’s icy pools, may their forms and souls be guarded and escorted. Subdue demons, ensure their protection and promotion, and may they be graded in the Southern Palace. Let the dead souls undergo refinement, transforming into immortals and becoming human. May the living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas without end. Turning through kalpas, may they share the heavens’ longevity. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms, may they roam freely in the Supreme Clarity.

**Preparatory Announcement:**
The ritual code states: For all grand retreats, upon receiving the retreat sponsor’s petition—termed the vow of devotion—collecting alms to redeem the sins of the deceased and seeking compassionate deliverance, the practitioner enters the oratory chamber. There, they compose and write the *Memorial to the Celestial Realm for Salvation from Suffering*, following the prescribed form to ascend in spirit and make audience, praying in advance for grace and the cessation of bitterness.

Next, establish the *Hall of Salvation by Azure Radiance*, raise the *Azure Mystery Proclamation Banner of Alliance*, and announce the ninefold *Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands* to absolve the nine provinces and their corresponding celestial regions. Burn the *Memorial for Opening the Altar*, hang the *Great Placard* at the gate, and issue the *Preparatory Announcement Proclamation*. Dispatch the *Flying Dragon Rider-Officers* to inspect the empty void and respond to the numinous administrators. This constitutes the *Celestial Salvation from Suffering*, announcing in advance to the ten directions, halting the trials of the imprisoned as if suspending executions in the yang world.

Bow to present the *Memorial to the Celestial Realm for Salvation from Suffering* and proclaim the *Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands*.

**Incantation for Dispatch:**
Universally proclaim to the boundless divine realms of the Three Realms, the subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus, the Twelve River Sources. Liberate the ancestors and karmic kin of countless kalpas, swiftly expunge their sin registers, eradicate their evil roots. They must not be detained or forced into ghostly throngs. By the Primordial Celestial August One’s talismanic command, may they ascend at once. In the Northern Capital’s icy pools, may their forms and souls be guarded and escorted. Subdue demons, ensure their protection and promotion, and may they be graded in the Southern Palace. Let the dead souls undergo refinement, transforming into immortals and becoming human. May the living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas without end. Turning through kalpas, may they share the heavens’ longevity. Forever delivered from the Three Paths, Five Sufferings, and Eight Difficulties, transcending the Three Realms, may they roam freely in the Supreme Clarity.

Form the Jade Mudra, summon the eastern qi, and burn it with fire. Pray to the Nine Dragon Envoys to carry the talisman and proceed.

**Submission of the Preparatory Memorial:**
The retreat’s details are transcribed and presented to the Three Heavens, petitioning the vast and profound, allying with the Three Realms, universally proclaiming to the ten directions. Pray in advance for the imperial command, proclaiming it for nine nights, opening the gates of the netherworld, halting the trials of the imprisoned. The incantations and mudras for summoning and dispatching are employed as in the formal memorial.

**Bow to Present the Chapter of the Plain Chariot and White Horse**
Proclaim the *Universal Announcement to the Three Realms*.

**Incantation for Dispatching**

Proclaim universally to the boundless divine realms of the Three Realms, the subterranean courts of the Yellow Springs, the Northern Capital of Fengdu, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, and the Twelve River Sources. May the ancestors of countless kalpas and all karmic kin swiftly have their names expunged from the ledgers of sin and their evil roots eradicated. Let them not be detained or forced into the company of ghosts. By the primordial talismanic command, may they ascend at the appointed hour.

In the Cold Pool of the Northern Capital, may their forms and souls be guarded and escorted. Subdue demons, ensure their protection, and promote them to the Southern Palace. Let the dead souls undergo refinement, transforming into immortals. Let the living receive deliverance, enduring through kalpas, roaming with the heavens in eternal years. May they forever transcend the Three Paths, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Adversities, rising above the Three Realms to roam freely in the Supreme Clarity.

**Erecting the Alliance Banner**

The Dharma states: The Azure Mystery Treasure Banner is crafted from azure silk, inscribed with the Great Nine Dragon Talisman to form the banner. It has nine streamers at its base, eight encircling it, and one at its center, each inscribed with a Nine Dragon Talismanic Command. Once presented, it becomes a sacred standard.

According to the correspondences of the Nine Provinces, it is erected with due reverence. Coins and fruits are rolled within the banner and scattered in the ten directions. As mortal eyes may glimpse celestial perfected beings, the prohibition against carelessness is severe.

**Essential Instructions:**

Upon completing the preliminary announcement, the adept faces the Heavenly Gate, offers incense, and visualizes the Heavenly Gate with a thousand plain chariots and ten thousand white horses, accompanied by celestial perfected deities and great generals from the ten directions, floating in the void to witness the rites. The adept then petitions before the Heavenly Gate and scatters the banner as prescribed.

The site where the altar is established and the banner erected becomes the Palace of the Great Qi Water Office, pure and unobstructed, crowned with a canopy like a mushroom-shaped standard. The radiance of the sun and moon flows through, illuminating the water office. Within, a great banner transforms, its four sides stirred by divine winds, directly connecting to the canopy above.

Visualize a lotus within the waters, its fragrance inexhaustible, surrounded by golden light and auspicious clouds of Brahman qi. The streamers of the banner scatter in the ten directions like fine rain or dense mist. Beneath the canopy sits the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor, holding a branch to sprinkle the Dharma rain. Auspicious clouds ascend to receive the yin souls, who gather beneath the banner, awaiting the altar’s opening to pay homage to the Supreme Emperor and receive transformation for rebirth.

**Morning Memorial**

**Essential Instructions:**

Following the preliminary announcement, the adept proceeds to present the morning memorial at the Golden Gates of the Three Heavens, beseeching grace and petitioning for the command, prostrating before the gates to await the decree.

First, the adept’s true spirit transforms the four directions, gazing upon the jade-like forms. In an instant, two Jade Lads appear, bearing banners and scepters, holding luminous sun-like pearls whose radiance flashes and shines upon the adept. The Jade Morning Supreme One emits the light of his brow, mouth, and nose, merging with the pearl’s brilliance. The adept subtly draws this light with his eyes and nose until it reaches his face. The Jade Lads hold the pearl like a sun wheel, illuminating all without obstruction.

The pearl’s qi divides and arrays, swiftly entering the adept’s form like flowing gold. The adept gazes in reverence at the Jade Morning, bows twice, and retreats from the gates. The Jade Maidens, driving the sun, ascend with the adept’s body. The pearl’s golden light forms a circular wheel, its radiance illuminating the four directions above and below, penetrating even the darkest depths of the netherworld’s gates, turning all as bright as day.

The ghostly officials in the prisons bow their heads, touching their foreheads in homage, submitting to the Supreme One with joy and delight. This light opens the dark prisons, releasing all imprisoned souls, halting their trials, and freeing the yin souls from their torments.

Next, the Jade Maidens, bearing banners and scepters, drive the pearl’s circular light, illuminating all within and without. The banner revolves atop the wheel of light, and the Dharma rain of compassionate clouds sprinkles the dark prisons, transforming them into radiant clarity. Inside and out, all becomes a lotus realm, universally uplifted, with even the faintest light reaching all.

The adept, in accordance with the Dharma, absorbs the true qi and exits the chamber. That night, upon falling asleep, the outer bed transforms into a jade carriage, carrying the adept’s body amidst clouds, mist, the sun, moon, and stars, their brilliance resplendent and reflecting upon the adept.

Visualize one’s form as the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor, seated upon a nine-headed lion, holding a pure lapis lazuli vessel in the left hand and an empty azure jade branch in the right, sprinkling rare fragrances in the ten directions. From the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth, these flow boundlessly into the netherworld, bringing joy to all in the dark realms, who receive the sprinkled blessings and ascend.

This is the way of focused contemplation in the preliminary announcement to open prosperity and halt suffering.

**Bowing to Present the Chapter on Opening the Karma-Transforming Path of Fengdu**

Proclaim the **Amnesty: Talismanic Command of the Primordial Beginning**

By the talismanic command of the Primordial Beginning, ascend at the appointed hour.

**Incantation to the Dragon**

**Bowing to Present the Chapter on Opening the Path**

**Proclamation of the Jade Thearch’s Precious Edict**

The Supreme Peerless, the Boundless Heaven’s Mysterious Existence and Profound Truth—
its distant Purple Goldwatch, the Grand Tenuity’s Jade Clarity Palace,
the Limitless and Supreme, the Sacred and Vast Dharma-Light,
the Serene and Vast, the Unfathomable Origin—
encompasses the Ten Directions with its tranquil and constant Dao,
its vast and empty great spiritual potency:
the Jade Thearch, Great Heavenly Honored One, the Lofty Emperor of Mysterious Vault.

**Edict to Command Earth Spirits**

By edict, command the earth spirits:
attend and escort, deliver from the earth’s gates the Five Sufferings and Eight Adversities.
Let the seven generations of ancestors ascend and depart,
forever freed from the offices of ghosts.
May souls cross to the Vermilion Mound,
undergo refinement, and be reborn anew.
This is called boundless deliverance, universal salvation without end.

**Opening the Five Paths**

The ritual employs five mud seats, upon which five white banners are planted.
Bamboo stalks are affixed to the mud seats, and the banners inscribed with
*"Heavenly Honored One Who Opens the Paths."*
These are arranged within the five-direction lamp altars.
Further details are recorded in the ascent to the altar.

**Principle States:**
The adept faces the Heavenly Gate and performs three bows,
then kindles the lamps for opening the paths.
Holding the banners, they chant and intone while tracing the five directions with a ritual staff or sword.

Beginning in the east, they stand facing east in the *ding* position,
visualizing the Envoy of Grand Unity and the Five Thearchs’ Direct Attendants,
directing the qi of life to enter the eastern gate.
With the ritual staff, they trace and open the eastern path.
Proceeding thus to the south, west, north, and center—
this is the rite for opening the paths and releasing the departed souls.

**Section on the Principles of Ritual Purification**

**Main Petition for Opening the Purification Rite**
**Principle States:**
At the outset of sitting or standing in the oratory or Hall of Refined Contemplation, the adept steadies the will and concentrates the spirit, transforming the body into the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. With both hands, they form the Jade Clarity mudrā, close their eyes, and with the tongue, spray qi to either side, thereby manifesting two Perfected Ones—clad in azure robes, crowned, girded with plain skirts, and adorned with pendants—who stand at the adept’s left and right to jointly conduct the purification rites. In all actions and meditations, the two Perfected Ones divide the tasks.

First, the adept visualizes the myriad divine officials and generals of their own department, arrayed above and below the altar platform to receive commands, and proclaims the written memorials, talismanic decrees, and mandates. Next, with both hands, they form the Four Mountains and Circumambulating the Dipper mudrās, manifesting the Four Courier Courts below the altar, arranged as in the public administration of the mundane world. Crimson gates and courtyard dwellings appear, each with banner-bearing warriors attending to their duties. Urgent messengers, bearing yellow command banners and flags, stand ready to relay talismans, memorials, and proclamations, and to issue decrees. Upon receiving their orders, they mount the mists and speed away like shooting stars. All other matters proceed in accordance with this model.

The Golden Dragon Courier Court, the Reeds-and-Dragons Courier Court, the Wind-and-Fire Courier Court, and the Golden Horse Courier Court.

When the Ninefold Purity Supreme Lords ascend their thrones, they dwell above the myriad layers of the Dao’s qi in the realm of emptiness and non-being. One must not gaze directly upon them, for it is as when a worldly emperor ascends his hall—eight screens are held to veil him. Only after he has taken his seat are the screens drawn back to summon the ranks. Thus, one first performs the rites with the curtain lowered, envisioning the Supreme Lords ascending their thrones. Then, the documents are proclaimed, and only thereafter is the curtain rolled up.

The essential principle states: The officiant, arrayed in full dignity, approaches the earthly portal, envisioning the altar hall suffused with auspicious radiance, enveloping the ten directions. Next, facing the Heavenly Gate, they kneel to present their petition and engage in audience, imagining the divine perfected ones of the ten directions, the exalted sagely transcendents, and their thousand chariots and ten thousand riders escorting the Ninefold Purity’s imperial throne as it descends to the altar platform and ascends the hall. Then, the altar officials step forward in rank to proclaim the true memorial, while the officiant inwardly visualizes and presents the memorial in homage. Next, the ranks are divided, and the curtain is rolled up. The officiant offers incense and burns the Jade Steps talisman, then follows the ranks into the altar to conduct the rites.

**The Rite of the Golden Bell and Jade Chime**

The method of the golden bell and jade chime summons the yin and yang spirits within the high officiant’s body, harmonizing Heaven and Earth, dispelling defilement and impurity, gathering the true numina, opening the ten directions, bridging the hidden and the manifest, pursuing and capturing souls, regulating and assembling the breath of salvation—preventing reckless dissipation—all governed by these two spirits. Thus, at the outset of opening the altar, the bell and chime must be sounded to summon them.

Their alternating resonance—emerging in turn to merge as one—refines yin into yang. With unwavering sincerity and pure intent, free from stray thoughts or disordered will, one may summon the numinous. Some today speak of "offering to the golden bell and jade chime," yet they do not hasten to do so.

The yang spirit is named Lu Hui, styled Yanling, standing eight feet and three inches tall, wearing a Liang-dynasty cap and robes of raging flame, wielding a sword in his right hand. He presides over yang-world spirit shrines, purifying Heaven and Earth of impurity, and driving away the spirits of the hundred trees.

The yin spirit is named Lu Tong, styled Yongfu, standing eight feet and three inches tall, wearing a Liang-dynasty cap, plain robes, and wide sleeves, wielding a sword amidst the clouds of qi. He governs the netherworld’s underworld prisons and can also purify the world’s impurities, ending the torments of the yin realm.

It is said: The bell’s form is round above and inclined downward; its sound is clear and far-reaching. Its crown is coiled with dragons, and it is aligned with yang as the "golden bell." The chime’s form is round below and inclined upward; its sound is deep and heavy. Its base is a crouching tiger, and it is aligned with yin as the "jade chime." This reflects the primordial division of the undifferentiated: when humans emerged, the sounds of humanity became the harmony of the Three Powers, hence their exclusive use in the Daoist ritual arena.

When dragons rise, clouds gather; when tigers roar, winds rage. From the auspicious convergence of wind and cloud, the myriad sages all arrive. When dragon and tiger resonate together, the thousand spirits all descend.

The bell measures nine inches in diameter and one foot in height, the yang number embracing the yin calculation. The chime measures one foot in diameter and nine inches in height, the yin number embracing the yang calculation. When the jade mallet strikes the bell, its sound becomes clear and far-reaching through yin. When the metal striker hits the chime, its tone harmonizes through yang.

At the beginning of opening the altar, the golden bell is first sounded twenty-five times to summon the yang qi. The jade chime follows with thirty strikes to gather the yin qi. Then, the bell and chime alternate for thirty-six strikes, harmonizing yin and yang. The officiant visualizes the spirits and recites the incantations for summoning yin and yang, communicating with the true and reaching the numinous. Afterward, the golden bell sounds six more times, the yang position on the right, so that the tiger’s true qi of golden clouds fills the yin origin. The jade chime sounds nine more times, the yin position returning to the left, so that the dragon’s true qi of jade wind and scorching fire arises in the altar’s wood.

The golden bell sounds six more times, the yang position on the right. When proclaiming the liturgy, the bell is struck once between phrases; for major thanksgivings, it is struck once per phrase. The counting of yin and yang phrases follows this rule. When bowing, one must hear the bell’s sound; when rising, one listens for the chime’s resonance—this is the Way of ascent and descent. If the proclamation is not concluded, the sounds may disrupt the text. If officials are dismissed without the proper sounds, the spirits may become confused.

When the Daoist assembly approaches the altar, the bell’s sound comes first, called the "left compass." When the officiant approaches the hall, the chime responds, called the "right square." In all ritual matters, the bell precedes the chime to guide the assembly’s decorum. Thus, the sounds of the bell and chime arise from the left compass and right square.

The essential principle states: The officiant circulates the divine wind, silently invoking the auspicious qi. With eyes closed, they circulate the ears, nose, and tongue to emit the auspicious wind, receiving the divine wind of the Brahma void, like rippling water or shimmering light. First, strike the golden bell on the left thirty-six times to summon the mighty soldiers. Then, strike the jade chime on the right twenty-four times to gather the true numina. In the center, beat the ritual drum twelve times to announce to the Supreme Lords.

The silent incantation says:
*The host spirits arrayed within,
The mighty soldiers spread without.
Twin radiance enters the eyes,
The mouth emits numinous light.
The head bears the Seven Stars,
The feet tread the Dark Net.
The myriad spirits perish in the qi,
The thousand demons vanish of themselves.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by law!*

Next, summon the two spirits by burning the talismans for the yin and yang spirits and reciting the incantations to summon them. One must first sound the golden bell and jade chime within oneself, inwardly visualizing the two spirits within the body before they can be gathered.

The essential principle states: The yang spirit resides in the officiant’s hands, the spirit of the Three Yangs, an official of the Three Heavenly Gates. When summoned forth, first circulate it to the cinnabar palace in the upper chamber, then to the jade palace, intertwining the three colors of blue, red, and black jade. It emerges from the brain palace above, coalescing into a mushroom-cloud of auspicious vapor, receiving the qi of the cinnabar heavens, like mist and fog. Within, it transforms into soaring simurghs and dancing phoenixes, singing and arrayed in formation, ascending together to the side of the Heavenly Altar.

Next, circulate the qi to generate the True within the True. It emerges from the upper Mud Pill, ascending to the edge of the cinnabar heavens’ clouds and mist to pay homage to the Supreme Void Emperor, all appearing in unified vision. Only then is the golden bell sounded to complete the nine yang qi. Once stabilized, listen with the left ear: a hollow sound takes form, and one senses the bell’s resonant echoes within the cinnabar heavens, harmonizing with the mysterious altar, its hidden tones ringing clearly.

The Doctrine states: The Yin Spirit resides at the adept’s right hand, governing the Three Yin Palaces—she is the Jade Maiden of the Heavenly Gate where yin arises and Brahma-chants resound. Within the body, she is the single outflow of essence, qi, and spirit in transformation, ascending and spreading before one.

Next, visualize the Three Perfected Ones and Jade Maidens, each emitting the qi of Azure Mystery, coalescing into a dense vapor shaped like a lotus pond in full bloom. White qi, like swirling clouds and mist, intertwines with the qi of the Cinnabar Heavens, shrouding the Mysterious Altar, where the radiance of sun, moon, and stars faintly appears.

Then, visualize the Celestial Court and the two ears, left and right, along with the nostrils, each exhaling qi of manifold hues. Gradually ascending to the edge of the clouds and mist, they transform into the forms of dragon and tiger. Their eyes meet, and simurghs and phoenixes gather with harmonious cries as the Dragon and Tiger Spirit Lords array themselves above and below.

Only then is the jade chime struck to complete the count of nine yang qi. As the Yin Spirit is invoked in prostration, the adept’s eyes flicker open and shut, gazing faintly toward the celestial expanse. The ears perceive resonant echoes, and the chime’s reverberations descend to the Jade Altar, vibrating through the ten directions.

Next, the sounds of yin and yang intermingle and resonate. The clouds and vapor disperse, leaving not a trace of dust or shadow. A single strike shatters the primordial chaos, forging heaven and earth, their forms now distinct and luminous. From the four directions, divine winds arise, playing celestial music, while auspicious winds and propitious clouds coalesce. Beholding the heavenly melodies resounding within the Nine Void Realms, the Three Realms ascend in unison as the ten directions pay homage.

Here, the qi of heaven ascends, the qi of earth surges, and yin and yang divide to accomplish their great work, establishing the image of heaven and earth.

**Striking the Bell and Chime**
The *Ordinances of the Supreme Perfected* state: In practicing the supreme Dao, expounding scriptures, or conducting fasts and rites, one must first strike the bell and chime. This not only alerts the assembly but also stirs the host of spirits. Divine immortals and perfected beings attend in timely convergence, magnifying the Dao and harmonizing all things, their abundant virtue flowing in mutual accord. With focused mind and spirit, one perceives their presence.

When striking the mallet, begin softly and gradually increase in force, counting twelve, twenty-four, and thirty-six strokes. Holding the mallet for the bell and chime, first recite the invocation:
*"The round mallet awakens the ritual instrument,
Its flowing sound pervades the ten directions.
Below, it penetrates the long night;
Above, it resounds in the Jade Chamber.
The Nine Dark Realms hear and escape suffering,
The Seven Ancestors ascend to the Immortal Hall."*

First strike three times, emitting the sound of sprouting yang, for yang’s number arises from one and culminates in nine. Next, draw out nine strikes, evoking the resonance of jade and chalcedony.

The first three strikes ascend to the Three Heavens: Pure Tenuity, Yu-Yu, and Great Red. Another three strikes resonate with the Three Realms: Desire, Form, and Formlessness. A final three strikes awaken the Three Paths: Hell, Hungry Ghosts, and Animal Realms.

Conclude with twenty-seven strikes. Nine strikes summon the Dao Lords of the Nine Heavens; nine stir the Perfected Emperors of the Nine Palaces; and nine call forth the suffering souls of the Nine Dark Realms. Together, the thirty-six strikes ascend to the Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, resonate with the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures, and penetrate the Thirty-Six Hells below.

Failure to adhere to this method not only risks offending the unseen judges but also brings shame upon the assembly and disrupts the ritual’s rhythm. The *Mysterious Ordinances* decree: The responsibility lies with the director of chanting. If the director fails to announce the proceedings, both they and the offender shall be penalized with one catty of incense and twenty prostrations as restitution.

**Invoking the Light**
The Doctrine states: At noon on the day the altar is established, the adept inscribes two *Qingguang* talismans, wraps them in incense, faces the southern *li* direction, holds a mirror in the left hand and the talismans in the right, positioning them to face each other. Silently recite the incantation:
*"Essence of the sun, vermilion radiance,
Illuminating the green canopy.
Crimson youths of returning mist,
Mysterious flames and whirling images."*

Using a yang-sundial fire, ignite one talisman as a torch, dipping it in oil and lighting it over the incense. Then, light the candle before the Primordial Beginning. For three, five, or seven days and nights—up to forty-nine—it must never be extinguished. When the flame nears its end, relight it with another candle. If the sky is overcast, use fire kindled from wood.

Thus, the true fire of the sun’s center can descend to the Nine Dark Realms below and ascend to illuminate the Three Luminaries above, its radiance blessing the Felicitous Court.

---

**Dividing the Lamps**
To deliver and uplift yin spirits, the lamps that pierce the darkness of the unseen must be kindled with the method of *Wisdom Light*, for only then can the wisdom of the Three Luminaries descend to merge with the light of ordinary flame, enabling the summoning and salvation of souls. Without this method, the light remains mundane and incapable of transcendence.

The Doctrine states: At noon on the day of the main fast, the adept faces south, burns incense toward the sun, inhales qi, and exhales onto the brush. On a nine-inch yellow paper, inscribe twelve *Wisdom Light* talismans in cinnabar, using the Jade Clarity mudra and the qi of the eastern direction. Fashion a torch from [material] to ignite the lamp’s flame.

To light the three altars’ sacred lamps, first use the yang-sundial to await the sun’s presence in the southern palace, then recite the *Incantation of the Sun’s Radiant Spirit*:
*"O radiant sun,
Divine light penetrating the Three Clarities.
Qi disperses within the Mysterious Vastness,
Spiritual smoke arises in the Purple Court.
Guiding the winds and clouds,
Soaring beyond all form.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by the law!"*

After reciting, use the yang-sundial to capture the sun’s true qi and light a lamp before the Primordial Beginning.

The Doctrine states: As the adept circulates transformation within the Heavenly Altar, heaven and earth have divided, celestial music and dragon-tiger imagery have taken form, and yin and yang have manifested. Yet the dense yin remains imprisoned in darkness, unseen by the light.

The High Priest steps forward, approaches the Primordial Beginning, offers incense with three bows, and silently recites the *Hymn of the Bright Lamp*. Upon completion, one attendant stands to the left holding the lamp, another to the right holding incense. The High Priest, torch in hand, invokes the descent of the sacred light before the Primordial Beginning.

Visualize the Primordial Beginning granting assent. Envision golden light like the blazing sun melting metal, penetrating the talismanic script, suffusing it with a hundred hues of radiance. This light merges with the adept’s body, coalescing into a great solar orb. Golden light bursts forth, filling the altar inside and out. The High Priest circulates the qi of the Primordial Beginning’s Upper Palace, transforming it into a single vapor like a golden-green rainbow, ascending to the Cinnabar Heavens to merge with the qi atop the Primordial Beginning’s crown.

Exhaling golden light from the mouth, like the rising sun, it revolves downward to the altar, extending to the front of the Mysterious Realm, beneath the Supreme Void Emperor, where the light converges at the side.

Visualize the radiant treasure-light in motion, envisioning golden towers and vermilion gates, with dragons and tigers intertwining. As assent is granted to the petition, the shifting shadows of sun, moon, and stars stream into the treasure-light, blazing forth in resplendent revelation. The golden gates and vermilion palaces of the treasure-light pour forth, flooding the Celestial Altar with luminous brilliance.

Next, ignite the talismanic torch within the central lamp’s light, first circulating "One giving rise to Two, Two giving rise to Three." Then, the attendant of the lamp performs three bows and receives the flame from the master to light the lamp. The attendant of incense likewise performs three bows and, taking the talismanic torch, lights the lamps in all ten directions. Once the ranks have finished lighting, the Three Masters return, each performing three bows, and gather the remaining torches into one. The High Priest performs three bows and burns it in the censer before the Primordial Beginning.

Envision the Perfected Saints of all heavens jointly spreading auspicious light, bursting through the ten directions—inner and outer, above and below—illuminating mountains, forests, rivers, seas, official residences, household gates, the prisons of water and fire, the yin dungeons, the yang courts, and the earthly prisons. Above, it pierces the Nine Heavens; below, it shines upon the Nine Provinces and the Nine Earths. Wherever the deepest yin and utmost evil reside, all receive the treasure-light, penetrating and breaking through, transforming all into wondrous realms. Thus, at the site of the established retreat, both within and without, all beings and things abide within the treasure-light. The ten directions of the world are all thoroughly illuminated; even the darkest dungeons and hidden prisons are radiant with brilliance.

In an instant, the luminous qi gathers brightly within the treasure-light, suspended and floating above the Celestial Altar. Once the lamps and candles are dispersed and the ritual actions completed, slowly draw in the light with the nose and eyes, gently inhaling it into the form of the Perfected within. Return it to the Mud-Pill Palace atop the cinnabar chamber to receive the Perfected.

As the *Simplified Writs of the Three Primes* states: "The merit of the Celestial Capital’s ritual of kindling lamps can ascend to illuminate all heavens, descend to shine upon the deepest yin, and radiate across the eight directions. It aids the brilliance of the Three Mornings, dispels the calamities of the Nine Lands, reflects the wisdom-light of the Heavenly Worthies, and delivers the suffering souls of the deepest yin. With a single illumination of yang-light, myriad sorrows cease; iron cities crumble, and those touched by the light attain liberation."

Next, recite the extinguishing-lamp incantation to attain the Dao of "One giving rise to Three" and the method of returning to the root and restoring the mandate. "One giving rise to Three" refers to the attendants of the lamp and incense each holding a talisman, approaching the High Priest’s hand to divide the light before lighting.

**Incantation for the Jade Clarity’s Generative Dispersal of Wisdom-Light**
Compassionate treasure-script, jade peaks wreathed in mist.
Flowering lamps scatter, universally illuminating the Nine Springs.
The Three Realms grow bright; radiance disperses through the Ten Heavens.
The deepest darkness bathes in flame, beneficence extending boundlessly.
Today, in this great celebration, suffering is cast off and immortality ascends.
The Dao gives rise to the One qi, and the myriad things are brought to completion.
The mighty script of the Primordial Beginning generates transformation naturally.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Clarity’s Highest Emperor decrees!

**Three Lights Mantra.**
Upon completing the lamp-lighting, recite the Lamp Incantation:
The Most High scatters through the ten directions,
Flowering lamps convey sincerity.
All heavens shine resplendently,
Hell realms all grow bright.
My body, too, is luminous,
The five viscera blossom with splendor.
The fiery radiance illumines the Great Void,
Distant thoughts reach the Jade Capital.
Open and begin.

**Purpose Statement:**
To open the proceedings and memorialize the Supreme Emperor and the lofty perfected, one reports the sincerity of the fast. The officiant steps forth to request the water for purifying the altar, then enters the earthly portal to recite the secret incantation. Approaching the main censer, they offer incense thrice, burn the true summons talisman, and invoke the transformation of the thousand perfected and ten thousand sages. These ascend into the void to witness and examine the sincerity of the fast. The incantations and hand seals employed are the same as those used during the Three Audiences.

**Memorial Petition:**
**Purpose Statement:**
Once the opening is complete, the officiant follows the ranks to the master’s canopy, offers incense, and requests the master’s presence. Kneeling and bowing twice, they memorialize in secret, invoking the descent of the master’s true radiance and luminous grace to observe the fast. They then request the descent of the memorial petition, talismanic writ, and proclamation, which ally the Three Realms and universally announce to the ten directions.

**Submitting the Formal Memorial:**
**Purpose Statement:**
Whenever submitting a formal memorial or proclamation, one must summon and command the myriad spirits. First, transform one’s own form: burn incense, stand at the center, execute the Ten Heavens Hand Seal with both hands, raise it to the Heavenly Court, and flick it forth. Face forward, inhale a mouthful of qi, and distribute it to left and right. Transform the body into that of the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor, silently reciting the Transformation Incantation:

The Primordial Beginning’s supreme numen,
Ninefold rises in verdant splendor.
Paying homage, the form is concealed,
Bathed and refined to generate radiance.
The palace chariot spans the Six Harmonies,
Enabling my ascent in flight.
The seven spirits disperse and array,
Forever preserving distant years.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor decrees!

First, execute the Three Officials Hand Seal and flick it forth. Next, take the water vessel, inhale a mouthful of primordial qi, and exhale it into the right-side water, envisioning the pure mist-like qi flowing like fine rain or dense fog into the vessel, surging within. Then softly recite the *Purify Heaven and Earth Incantation*, sprinkling and purifying all around. Next, recite the *Emit the Aura Incantation* and step the *Aura of Summoning and Commanding Myriad Spirits*, pressing the Jade Purity Hand Seal before the heart. On yang days, begin with the left foot; on yin days, begin with the right.

**Aura of Summoning and Commanding Myriad Spirits**
*Emit the Aura Incantation*
The numinous treasures of the Supreme Sages,
Govern and move all immortal spirits.
The aura flies, stars gleam,
Paying homage at the imperial court.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Jade Purity Supreme Emperor decrees!

Upon completion, flick forth the Jade Purity Hand Seal. Then recite the *Five Emperors Pacify Spirits Incantation*:
The Azure Emperor guards the hun,
The White Emperor attends the po,

The Black Emperor circulates blood.
The Yellow Emperor presides at the center,
Ten thousand spirits do not transgress.
The numinous aura ascends in petition,

Press the hand seal of the current day to summon the Day’s Directing Merit Clerk to arrive first. At the Numinous Petition Great Dharma Bureau, burn incense and invoke the Day’s Directing Merit Clerk Messenger, commanding: "Hear this summons and swiftly attend the ritual altar."

Burn the Merit Clerk Talisman and recite the incantation:
Officers of the Mysterious Bureau, bearers of jade script, charged with merit,
Govern the Jade Purity, petitioning the Three Heavens.
By the Emperor’s decree, swiftly descend in divine radiance.
I solemnly summon the Merit Clerk of this day,
To act in accordance with the law:
Yang essence flies and gleams,
Radiance illumines the divine court.
With a single summoning breath,
Ascend to the cinnabar clouds.

**Summon the Day’s Decade Directing Merit Clerk Incantation**
Clerks and lords of the Jade Treasury,
Messengers of the yang essence and solar decade,
Hear the summons and swiftly proceed.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor decrees!

Flick forth the Bureau Clerk Hand Seal at the current decade and hour. Draw qi from the northwest, envisioning it descending from the Heavenly Gate upon cloud qi, arraying before the altar. Then command and proclaim the summoning of the Jade Maidens and Numinous Officers of the Celestial Receivers, along with all spirits of this bureau, to attend the altar.

Envision from the Cinnabar Palace a crimson mist and radiant splendor, like sunlight falling and illuminating, bursting through the pores like lapis lazuli. Rushing upward to the Twelve-Storied Tower, with the tongue, exhale a breath to form a solar orb before you, within which the myriad spirits brandish banners, beat drums, and wield staffs.

Recite again:

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Void Sovereign decrees.

**Middle Script**, eastern qi.

Swiftly, swiftly, as the Void Sovereign decrees.

**Middle Script**, Dipper qi.

Once the summons is complete, visualize in turn the transforming officers and generals arrayed to left and right, awaiting commands.

Next, offer incense and proclaim the intent, directing the presentation of tea and wine. After the three offerings and the proclamation of the petition are concluded, offer incense again, knock the forehead seven times, and with both hands execute the **Midnight-Noon Dipper Seal**. Envision the stars and constellations above and below, clouds and mist, golden light suffusing all, as if the starry heavens themselves manifest before you.

Then direct the dispatch of the officers, proclaiming and transmitting the memorial, ascending to the Imperial Court, announcing it universally to the ten directions and throughout the Three Realms. Visualize the officers bowing to receive the command and accepting the official document.

Next, recite the **Incantation to Dispatch the Officers**:
Vast and numinous, the myriad qi,
Govern the celestial bureaus.
Bearing this mission and dispatch,
From below they ascend on high.
At the Jade Steps of the Imperial Palace,
They transform and soar freely.
In reverence and response to the mysterious,
They harmonize with the Dao and ascend in audience.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor decrees.

After the incantation, spray water, and with both hands execute the **Ten Heavenly Seals**. Visualize the officers taking up the memorial, rushing upward and away, borne upon stars, constellations, clouds, mist, and golden light, ascending directly into the Heavenly Treasury. Spray water once more, entering straight through the Heavenly Gate to present the memorial and withdraw.

**Principal Directive**:
Once the memorial is presented, enter the oratory, settle the mind, and sit upright. With both hands, execute the **Ten Heavenly Seals** above the forehead. Swallow saliva three times, press the tongue to the upper palate, and circulate the qi from the **Twelve-Storied Tower**, exhaling a true breath to connect with the Heavenly Gate. Then **knead the Nine Palaces**, swallow saliva three more times, and circulate the light of the sun and moon to connect with the true persons, left and right officers, ascending into the realm of stars, constellations, light, and mist. Palaces and towers stand in solemn array before you. Bearing the memorial, ascend gradually.

Next, execute the **Thunder-Fire Seals** with the left and right hands, emitting the qi from the five viscera, striking forth as thunder, fire, lightning, and thunderbolts. Ascend directly to the Heavenly Treasury, breaking through and dispersing the demonic realms, the fierce winds, and the vast qi of the **Dipper’s Firmament**.

After a time, the officers and generals complete their presentation and descend. The practitioner guides them with the **Boundary-Directing Seal** at the waist, gathering them all into the **Upper Mud-Pill Palace**, returning them to the body. Seal the true, close the gates, swallow saliva once, and execute the **Midnight Seal** with the right hand. Then slowly rise from the seat.

This is the **Method for Transmitting and Activating the Upper Dao**.

**Erect the Banner**.

When establishing a grand fast, one must follow the prescribed forms: fashion the **Banner for Conveying the Spirits** from yellow silk, the **Banner of Returning Radiance** from red silk, and the **Banner of the Supreme One’s Precious Edict** from blue silk. Additionally, there are banners for deliverance and others, all to be made and erected according to the esoteric regulations, hung before the fast altar to flutter in the wind. Thus, the hidden souls of the ten directions may behold these numinous banners, and with a single thought of refuge, the great sins of kalpas past dissolve with the wind. Hell’s gates open in peace, and the spirits ascend to the Southern Palace.

**Incantation for Raising the Banner:**
The Yellow Register unfolds deliverance across the Three Realms and the Ten Directions.
The four births and six destinies together arrive at the Dao altar.
The spirits are conveyed, and the souls ascend—never forgotten through ten thousand kalpas.
The banner’s essence follows the wind in flight.
Wherever the wind reaches, each turns toward its direction.
From the Palace of Heavy Yin and the Land of Nine Nights,
Hell’s hungry ghosts and the boundless creatures of the lower realms
All attain liberation, ascending to Heaven’s halls.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Supreme Lord’s decree for the deliverance of the living commands.

**Principle:** When raising the various banners, one must visualize them as mushroom-shaped canopies and precious parasols, with auspicious winds from the four directions stirring and guiding the yin souls to the altar for deliverance.

**Invoking the Dragons:**
According to the regulations, two dragons and two youths are fashioned from *jiao* grass and placed before the altar. The *jiao* dragon stands on the left, the golden dragon on the right, while the two youths each hold a banner. Talismans are inscribed according to the prescribed forms and affixed to the bodies of the dragons and youths. These serve as couriers to proclaim the edicts, absolve sins, and convey the spirits. The front is called the *Jiao* Dragon Post and the Golden Dragon Post—this is the method.

**Principle:** The practitioner, with talismans and invocations, animates the *jiao* dragon. With the left hand, form the *chen* and *mao* seals, gather the eastern qi, and with a breath, infuse the dragon’s body. Then, with the left hand, trace from *zi* to *hai*, return to *si*, proceed to *shen*, and again return to *si*, inscribing the seal upon the dragon’s body. Visualize its scales, limbs, claws, and teeth fully formed. Sprinkle it with water and imagine the dragon in motion. Next, form the *wu* seal, gather the *namo* from the south, and blow it into the dragon’s body. Visualize crimson flames blazing, and see a jade maiden holding the Supreme Jade Talisman of Edicts and the Precious Writs of Pardon, descending through the air on clouds. Mounted upon the dragon, radiant with light, she comes to attend the Heavenly Altar of the Jade Emperor, awaiting the proclamation of the talismanic edicts. Upon receiving the decree, she swiftly mounts the dragon, riding the wind into the depths of Heavy Yin, penetrating the Nine Nights, and summoning the sinful souls. Visualize the four courier spirit-lords of the front, all assisting the *Jiao* Dragon Post scribes, bearing the Precious Talismans of Jade Clarity to proclaim the edicts of absolution.

**Principle:** Once the *jiao* dragon is animated, it bears the mandate to open the paths of the Nine Nights. Yet after the souls endure refinement, to which realm shall they return? Thus, the Golden Dragon Post scribe is invoked to convey the spirits.

The practitioner, with talismans and invocations, animates the golden dragon. With the left hand, gather *wu*, *wei*, and *si*, returning to *shen* to inscribe the seal. Gather the southeastern qi and blow it into the dragon’s body. Then inscribe the Four Gates Seal, circulating through the four gates to transform its scales, claws, horns, and limbs into full form. Invoke the harmony of yin and yang, and visualize golden light converging upon its body. Sprinkle it with water and imagine its form in motion. Next, visualize within the light a jade maiden, clad in cinnabar robes, holding a red lotus above the dragon’s head. Then imagine a pavilion transforming, like the Vermilion Mound Palace, suspended upon the dragon’s back. The dragon bears it in motion, returning to attend the Heavenly Altar. From the four posts, the spirit-lords and officials guide the dragon pavilion to stand below the altar. In the air, four maidens and four youths, each holding lotuses of their respective colors, support the dragon pavilion within their midst, yet they do not join the ranks of the celestial court. When the refinement and deliverance are complete, the practitioner performs the method of transformation and ascension to the Heavenly Bridge, linking it to the dragon pavilion. The jade maiden guides the souls to ascend into the Cinnabar Heaven’s realm, unrestrained by Heaven’s gates.

**Incantation for the *Jiao* Dragon:**
The Supreme Lord opens illumination, the Primordial Beginning oversees the true.
The Five Elder Thearchs and the Red Writs of Jade
Redeem all karmic roots of past sins.
All receive liberation; trials and torments cease.
Souls ascend to the Nine Heavens, spirits cross to the Vermilion Mound.
Today is most auspicious; the ten thousand spirits all heed.
The dragon bears the white writ, connecting the numinous of the hidden realms.
May the wish be fulfilled, swiftly transmitted by the wind and fire posts.

**Incantation for the Golden Dragon:**
The Primordial Beginning Thearch, the Red Writs of Jade,
Dissolve the knots of yin, attaining transcendence and truth.
The blade of the Southern Culmen, the spirit of the floating realm,
Refined by flowing fire, the dharma protects life.
The Vajra Youth and the cleansing of yin’s miasma,
Within and without, radiant and pure, the jade infant’s form.
Striding the Dhyāna Realm, the Cavern Yang’s court.
As the Golden Mouth Decree of the Primordial Beginning Thearch commands.

**Erecting the Six Pavilions:**
**Principle:** The practitioner, along with the altar officers and fast officers, exits the hall to erect the pavilions. Beginning with the **Mystery Master’s Pavilion**, the ranks arrange themselves to offer incense. Kneeling, they invite the master to present the memorial, review the documents, and read the covenant. They then offer paper money and horses, completing the burning. Next are the **Five Thearchs’ Pavilion**, the **Celestial Master’s Pavilion**, the **Three Masters’ Pavilion**, the **Three Officials’ Pavilion**, and the **Fast Supervisor’s Pavilion**. For each pavilion, they pay homage, concentrate their spirits in silent presentation, perform the transformation of the memorial, review the documents, and proceed as in the Mystery Master’s Pavilion. The order of the altar pavilions is detailed in the altar diagram.

**Mystery Master’s Pavilion (East 1):**
The **Mystery Master of Numinous Treasure** is the transformer of the Three Heavens, the teacher who expounds the teachings. When conducting fasts, one must first notify and invoke them to witness the fast’s merits. A tent is erected, and the sacred image and altar table are arranged according to the proper forms.

**Five Thearchs’ Pavilion (West 1):**
The **Five Elder Thearchs** preside over the records of merit and transgression in Heaven, bearing witness to the fast’s merits. In ancient fasts, they were placed upon altars in the five directions. According to the *Guangcheng Yiling*, a separate tent is erected north of the Three Masters’ position, with the sacred image and altar table arranged as prescribed.

**Celestial Master’s Pavilion (East 2 or West 2):**
The **Orthodox Celestial Master of the Correct Unity** is the master of the Three Heavens’ dharma, the teacher who transmits the methods. For all fasts and practices, one must notify and invoke them. A tent and altar table are arranged according to the proper forms.

**Three Masters’ Pavilion (West 2, or East 3):**
The **Three Masters of the Scriptures and Ordinances** serve as the founding masters of deliverance and the foremost of those who sustain mindfulness. Their tent and altar are arranged according to the proper forms.

**Three Officials’ Pavilion (East 3, or East 2):**
The **Three Great Officials** preside over the registers of the Three Primes’ examinations, bearing witness to the fast’s merits. Their tent and altar are arranged according to the proper forms.

**Fast-Overseeing Pavilion (West 3):**
The **Overseeing Dharma Master** is the principal supervisor of the Numinous Treasure fasts. Their tent and altar are arranged according to the proper forms when presiding over fasts.

The six pavilions are set up according to the available space, arrayed to the left and right of the Mystic Altar. According to ancient rites, the Five Thearchs were placed in the five directions upon altars. The *Guangcheng Ordinances* prescribe that a separate tent be erected north of the Three Masters’ position, facing the Mystic Master. Thus, the Mystic Master occupies East 1, the Five Thearchs West 1, the Celestial Master East 2, the Three Officials East 3, the Three Masters West 2, and the Fast-Overseeing Master West 3—all following the *Guangcheng* system. In ancient ordinances, the Three Masters of the Scriptures and Ordinances did not occupy the Heavenly Gate. There is also a **Pavilion for the Three Masters of the Orthodox Unity**, which honors the ancestral masters of the Dragon-Tiger Orthodox Unity lineage. Master Tian later adopted this practice, adding the pavilion for the Three Masters of the Orthodox Unity, thereby placing the Masters of the Scriptures and Ordinances at the Heavenly Gate—a departure from ancient ordinances. Moreover, the Numinous Treasure rites should adhere to the ancient system. In narrow spaces, it is not necessary to set up each pavilion individually. Instead, arrange one pavilion each to the east and west, then divide each into three sections, setting up three incense and flower altars as prescribed. When paying respects, all should proceed through the central path. In this arrangement, the eastern pavilion places the Mystic Master in the center, the Celestial Master to the left, and the Three Officials to the right. The western pavilion places the Five Thearchs in the center, the Three Masters to the left, and the Fast-Overseeing Master to the right. Since three pavilions are combined into one, the central position is the most honorable, with the left and right following in order.

**Oratory:**
This is where the High Merit performs rituals, writes talismans, and prepares registers. At its center are placed the Heavenly Perfected Sovereign, the Yellow Register True Lord, and the Register-Officials of the Talismanic Registers. The furnishings are arranged according to the proper forms, set up in advance on the day of the preliminary announcement.

**Sutra-Recitation Hall:**
At its center are established the positions of the Three Clarities and Three Treasures, with incense and flowers arranged as prescribed. During the fast, the altar officials lead daily recitations of scriptures, mantras, and sacred invocations here, concluding with the submission of memorials and repentance rites.

**Twelve Hall Terraces:**
When establishing a grand fast, one must first construct the Twelve Hall Terraces to summon the lofty immortals and perfected spirits, thereby conducting the fast’s affairs. The Twelve Halls are as follows:
1. **Hall of Azure Radiance**
2. **Hall of the Divine Tiger** (also called the **Hall of Gathering Souls**)
3. **Hall of Investigation**
4. **Hall of Concentrated Contemplation**
5. **Hall of the Underworld Officials**
6. **Bureau of Life-Monitoring**
7. **Hall of the Celestial Physicians and Purification Office**
8. **Bureau of Karmic Refinement**
9. **Court of the Yellow Register**
10. **Office of Rebirth**
11. **General Bureau of the Five Paths**
12. **Office of Memorial Transmission**

Additionally, there are the **Supervisory Office**, the **Altar-Monitoring Office**, the **Office of the Generals**, the **Hall of Ordination**, and the **Hall of Universal Deliverance**, each with its own generals, titles, and ritual procedures, all conducted in accordance with the prescribed forms. These serve as the administrative divisions.

**Hall of Azure Radiance and Salvation from Suffering:**
At the beginning of receiving petitions, one establishes the vow of sincerity, offering gold to redeem the sins of the deceased and beseeching deliverance. The High Merit prepares the petition, enters the oratory, and writes the *Memorial to the Heavenly Savior from Suffering*, following the method of submitting memorials by flying the spirit upward. This is done in advance to implore divine mercy. First, the **Hall of Azure Radiance** is established, with the **Azure Sovereign of the Primordial** at its center, and all offerings arranged as prescribed. Next, the **Azure Primordial Treasure Banner** is displayed—a banner of azure silk, forty-nine feet long, with nine streamers, each inscribed with the Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands. The central streamer is surrounded by eight others, forming a treasure banner. According to the nine provinces’ astrological divisions, the Flying Dragon Courier is dispatched to the void, where the spirit-officials observe and respond. Nine Dragon Talismanic Commands are burned to absolve the nine provinces. The *Memorial for Opening the Altar* is burned, the grand proclamation is hung at the gate, and the preliminary announcement is issued as prescribed. At the hall’s center is placed the *Chart of the Azure Vault and Empty Song*. Daily, incense is burned, and the *Hymn of Salvation from Suffering* is recited. On the appointed day, the altar is opened, and the nine periods of the day are observed with circumambulation and reverence. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, moved by compassion, responds to the cries and descends upon the Mystic Altar, bestowing the mind of salvation.

**Nine Morning Recitations of the Hymn of Salvation from Suffering**
**Burning the Talisman of the Azure Vault and Empty Song**
**Wearing the Seal of the Demon King**

**Three Hymns of the Azure Primordial’s Salvation from Suffering:**
1.
The Heavenly Worthy vows with great compassion,
Salvation spreads everywhere, transforming good causes.
The Five Marchmounts and Four Offices all receive commands,
The Fengdu Underworld and earthly prisons halt their punishments.
True talismans descend, and all receive absolution,
Divine youths proclaim the pardon of sinners.
The Primordial’s transformed body, true and wondrous,
Delivers countless beings, and the Dao is fulfilled.

2.
The Heavenly Worthy vows to deliver all beings,
Expounding the Dharma with solemnity, seated in the treasure grove.
Nine-headed lions manifest auspicious forms,
Wisdom’s light shines, dispelling dark shadows.
Swords and trees of blades are shattered,
Fire, mist, wind, and thunder all cease.
Great kindness and great compassion, boundless power—
The Fengdu Underworld and earthly prisons all behold and hear.

3.
The Heavenly Worthy’s wisdom saves the yin spirits,
Salvation responds to cries, breaking the iron city.
Vast aid knows no bounds, delivering as wished,
Radiant light universally illuminates the dark.
Where the benevolent wind blows, flames vanish,
When the Dharma rain falls, decay revives.
Boundless compassion fulfills salvation—
The departed souls all meet the Merciful Worthy.

**Hall of the Divine Tiger (Hall of Gathering Souls):**
When establishing a grand fast, after the preliminary announcement, during the review of memorials, or on the day of the fast’s commencement, a room is chosen at the *gen* (northeast) door in advance. The **Hall of the Divine Tiger and Gathering Souls** is established, with the sacred position of the Divine Tiger at its center, summoning the generals and officials, and arranging incense and flowers as prescribed. To the left and right of the hall, fresh soil is used to construct the **Altar of Yang Radiance and Passage** on the left and the **Altar of Yin Spirits and Soul-Gathering** on the right, each three feet and six inches square, leveled and smoothed evenly.

At the center of the altars, place the spirit tablet of the Prison Overseer. Then position the male and female seals respectively at the hearts of the Yang and Yin altars. Prepare jade tablets, memorials, official documents, and summonses. Also, depict the forms of the Three Envoys in color along with talismans. List the names of all the deceased souls to be delivered, ensuring each document is complete and prepared in advance. At the appointed time, proceed with the rites, visualizing the deities, pacing the stars to summon the generals, and inviting the sages to partake in the libations. Present the three offerings while reciting the jade tablets, talismans, and memorials. According to the prescribed form, trace the Yang and Yin altars with a sword.

At the center of the hall, establish the **Eight Gates Gathering Souls Altar**, spaced eight *chi* and one *ren* apart. At the heart of the altar, place a water basin in which the **Iron Trace Platform** and **Radiant Treasure Seal** are immersed. At its center, set the **Summoning the Departed Star Diagram**. To the left, erect the **Iron Trace Banner**, and to the right, the **Radiant Treasure Banner**. When summoning the yang deceased, use the Iron Trace Banner; for the yin deceased, use the Radiant Treasure Banner.

On the incense table, arrange pure water, incense, and flowers, along with the **Guiding Youth Talisman** and various **Divine Tiger Talismans**. Once the altar is established, dispatch the jade tablets and documents, burn the talismans, and visualize the commanding generals and officials gathering the souls to the altar, manifesting their traces in accordance with the original methods, incantations, and rituals. After dispatching the generals and officials, sprinkle water and burn the jade tablet envoys’ documents, along with paper money and horses.

Next, seal the hall’s doors, allowing no persons or objects to enter or exit. Outside the door, post notices to restrain the generals and officials until the appointed time for summoning the departed. Afterward, use the **Summoning Souls**, **Manifesting Forms**, **Communicating with the Hidden**, and **Conversing with the Departed** talismans. First, immerse them in west-flowing water within the altar, then retrieve the water to sprinkle the four sides of the altar. All souls will immediately manifest their true forms, communicating with the living as clearly as if in life. Do not weep in sorrow; if joyful, their forms will fully appear. They will bathe, attend the morning audience, receive offerings, listen to the precepts, and be transmitted talismans.

As the days of refinement and deliverance grow distant, the departed may fear the yang *qi* of the living, causing their yin souls to scatter. Again, use the banners to guide them back to the **Gathering Souls Altar**, entering through the **Gate of Death** and encountering deliverance, then exiting through the **Gate of Life**. The altar’s design, talismans, incantations, and rituals are all detailed in the *Divine Tiger Collection*.

**Bureau of Investigation and Correction**
This bureau is established to publicly display regulations, correct errors, and admonish the assembly of fast officials, ensuring they strictly adhere to the rules and do not obstruct the fast’s efficacy. At its center, set the positions of the **Five Masters** and **Three Officials**, with incense and flowers as offerings. On the day the fast begins, first establish this bureau. The officiant will pay respects, present libations, invite the sages, recite the memorial, and offer paper money and horses as prescribed.

**Nine Morning Sessions of Correction and Admonition**
Burn the **Descending Perfected Summoning Spirits Talisman**

**Hall of Concentration**
For all annual altar rites, this chamber takes precedence. Also called the **Hall of Serene Silence** or **Hall of Preserving the True**, it ensures the altar officials maintain solemn dignity, settle their spirits, and focus their minds. With a single thought, they cultivate the twofold purity, free from all delusions. They must not leave this hall even briefly when ascending or exiting the altar. At its center, set a high seat for the **Perfected Master**, with the positions of the **Fast’s Dharma Ancestors** arranged alongside. The high seat and desk are occupied by the **High Merit Official**, while the **Six Offices** and other officials line up on both sides. This hall should be established first.

**Hall of the Underworld Officials**
Before breaking the prisons in a grand fast, an offering for the underworld officials must be held, akin to the prison wardens of the yang world. First, establish this hall, with the **Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor** at its center. To the left and right, arrange the altars of **Mount Tai**, **Fengdu**, the **Ten Kings**, and the **Underworld Courts**, with incense and flowers as prescribed. At the appointed time, set up the altar and proceed according to the rituals.

**Bureau of Life Supervision**
For grand deliverance fasts, broadly aiding the submerged souls...

Among these, there may be those still living yet carrying unborn children, their fetal bonds unresolved, or where child and mother remain undivided—whether the child survives while the mother perishes, or both mother and child die together. For such as these, by what means may they attain liberation? First, a memorial must be presented to the **Great Emperor of Life and Spirit of the Nine Heavens**, and a petition submitted to the **Celestial Bureau of Life Supervision**, its immortal overseers. On the day the fast is properly established, the **Bureau of Life Supervision** shall be set up. The officiant shall first approach the bureau to request the summoning, invocation, and invocation rites. Only after the deceased have been summoned to the altar tent may the **Most Sacred Supervisors of Life** be invited to descend and oversee the altar for their deliverance. The **True Writ of the Supervisors of Life** shall be placed upon the bureau’s table, allowing the departed to behold it, whereupon their hundred bones shall naturally radiate light, dispelling the foul luminescence of corpse and impurity.

**Nine Morning Sessions:** Burn the **Talisman for the Already-Born and Not-Yet-Born**

**Hall of Purification**

For all souls receiving deliverance, those who perished in childbirth sink into the **Blood Lake**, their forms steeped in filth and defilement. Though they may, by the grace of Heaven’s mercy, receive a special pardon and proceed to the **Mystic Altar**, if the taint of blood remains unremoved, how can they receive deliverance? Moreover, among the multitudes of male and female souls, some may have suffered in life from illness—festering sores, suppurating wounds, or bloodshed from execution, suicide, blade or weapon, violent slaughter, mauling by tigers, or venomous snakebite. All such cases bear the mark of blood upon their bodies at death. Before they may approach the **Celestial Physicians** or the **Supervisors of Life**, purification must first be performed. It is fitting to first invite the descending officials and, at the appointed time, establish this bureau, inviting the sacred ones to station themselves, conduct invocations, and recite the scriptures. Once the summoned souls arrive at the bureau, talismans shall be burned and transformations enacted to cleanse the blood, after which the **Supervisors of Life** and **Celestial Physicians** may proceed with treatment.

**Hall of Celestial Physicians**

Among the souls to be verified, some may have suffered in life from various afflictions—blindness, deafness, muteness, lameness, paralysis, or contorted limbs—while others may have perished by execution, blade or weapon, drowning, fire, hanging, mauling by tigers or wolves, poisoning, lightning, judicial punishment, pitfalls, or dismemberment, their bodies left incomplete. Those who died in childbirth, their blood mingling with that of their unsevered child, must first have the **Celestial Physicians** invoked to descend and heal the departed souls. The officiant shall first establish the bureau’s tent and, in advance, invite the **Celestial Physicians** and their overseers to descend and take their place in the sacred bureau, installed according to the rites. Once the summoned souls arrive at the bureau, the officiant shall employ talismans and incantations, invoking the **Celestial Physicians** to restore them to wholeness, enabling them to return to their original state and proceed to the altar to attend the perfected ones and hear the Dharma.

**Bureau of Refining and Deliverance**

The ancient rites of **Guangcheng** lacked the ritual of refining and deliverance. In recent times, this practice has flourished. Some establish a separate refining and deliverance site, entirely unrelated to the ritual arena, while others conduct it before the **Supreme Emperor** within the arena itself. Alternatively, it may be performed facing the **Supreme Emperor**, with the banquet tables arranged opposite one another, merely adding the officials and generals of refining and deliverance. Since the **Nine Heavens** and other deities are already present in the ritual arena, they need not be separately installed. As there is no fixed form, the present practice shall follow the master’s teachings, arranging the positions of the refining and deliverance generals to the left and right within the ritual arena. Next, the offerings and rites for refining and deliverance shall be conducted, whether in a separate location or within the arena itself. The **Supreme Emperor’s** sacred seat shall be established in the center, and the officiant shall set it up according to the prescribed form. At the appointed time, the souls shall be guided to the bureau to undergo the great refinement of water and fire.

In ancient times, the rules for morning memorials emphasized the importance of the altar. Now that the altar is established for the rites, it is unfitting to set up a separate site. Even minor inconsistencies may hinder the process, and refining the yin souls of the departed is indeed a difficult matter. What is relied upon is the supplication to the true numina and the invocation of the **Two Qi**. Talismans serve as the token for summoning qi, while incantations are the celestial sounds. Only then may one’s own spirit and qi be mobilized, merging with the generative essence of the two images. Through refinement, the withered bones are transformed, and both form and spirit attain perfection. How could this be achieved by any other means? Such is the intent of this original rite.

First, establish this bureau, arranging the sacred ranks of the spirit-officials beneath the Three Heavenly Gates, and enshrine them according to ritual.
When ascending the altar to present memorials, first perform the libation for the spirit-officials at this bureau, then proceed with the submission.

**Bureau of Officials and Generals**

The completion of altar rites, the awe-inspiring solemnity of prohibitions, the presentation of memorials and submissions, the soaring of petitions to the heavens, the issuance of talismans and registers, the invocation of mandates and prayers for grace—all are executed by the officials and generals, along with all matters within and beyond the altar precincts.
Any transgressions, omens, or inauspicious events, as well as any hindrances to the harmonization of merit, are subject to their scrutiny.
First, establish the divine bureau, summoning and stationing the generals and clerks to oversee vigilantly, manifesting clear retribution. Through the passes, earnest prayers are conveyed, the sincerity of the fast is communicated, and the deceased spirits are guided to the altar to receive deliverance.
Upon completion, report the merits, and reward and dismiss according to protocol.

The above summons and invocations are to be employed together when submitting the principal memorial.

**Bureau for Supervising the Altar and Overseeing the Rites**
The site of the altar’s construction is invariably a mundane realm, where malevolent vapors and perverse qi may linger, along with those who disbelieve in the Great Dao—brutish and obstinate individuals who, with their meat and wine, clamor and violate the altar’s prohibitions. Who can guard against them?
At the outer gates to the left and right, arrange the altar precincts accordingly. Specifically, invite the majestic deities of the City God’s temple, along with the officials and generals appropriate to the high priest’s method, to jointly station and guard the altar, supervising the fast and its covenants, punishing negligence, expelling inauspicious influences, revering the imperial perfected ones, and bearing witness to the deliverance.
Thus, all who come and go will hold the rites in awe and admiration, ensuring no disruption to the fast’s merit.
Upon completion, report the merits according to protocol.

Arrange the altar’s position opposite the front of the altar, or to its west, enshrining the City God, the local earth god, and the deities of the local domain with incense and flowers, as prescribed.
Alternatively, combine them with the supervising officials and generals into a single bureau, adjusting the arrangement according to the space available.

Burn the *Talisman for Summoning the Earth God*

**Hall of Deliverance**
When the fast’s sponsor establishes the fast to deliver the Nine Dark Prisons, they must first purify their mysterious ancestors.
Opposite the altar, arrange the Nine Ancestors, the Seven Mysteries, and the deceased spirits to be delivered, preparing offerings for each in full.
The *Statutes and Ordinances of Du Guangcheng* are placed in the southeast, or in a separate chamber if preferred. Rigid adherence is not required.
After summoning the deceased to attend the perfected, guiding the spirits to receive food and precepts, and completing the refinement and deliverance, the rites may then be concluded.

**Hall of Universal Deliverance**
For the universal deliverance of dark souls, on the day of the *cui-shen* ritual, construct a reed enclosure with four gates, topped with white thatch and draped with blue curtains on all sides. Locations near the outskirts, wilderness, or water’s edge are particularly auspicious.
Form earthen walls on all four sides, evenly painted with cinnabar. Inside, build a two-tiered platform, placing ritual implements on the lower tier. At the center, set a water basin with an iron mirror or luminous treasure talisman submerged within. Place a measuring vessel in the middle, and arrange the positions of the six paths of lonely souls. At the four gates, lay out rice, food, wine, fruits, and viands in full.
The ritual’s purpose states: The master first purifies the reed enclosure, visualizing themselves as the Primordial Beginning, facing east, riding a purple cloud, inhaling the green qi, holding the Jade Clarity mudra, and wielding a banner. Thrice summon the *ding* stem’s *gang* alignment, recite the visualization, circumambulate the platform while chanting the *Dipper Chapter*, and guide the souls to circle the four gates three times for bathing and transformation of garments.
Then, proceed through the western gate, face the Heavenly Worthy, complete the prostration, and plant the banner at the center. Burn talismans to dispel defilement, summon generals to maintain order, and proceed with the ritual’s measurements, admonitions, and precepts.
The master silently circulates the Primordial Beginning’s three qi, weaving them into a misty union, as if with the radiance of gold and jade. Transform the offerings through visualization, and conclude according to the ritual’s protocol.
Do not yet transmit the talismans to send the spirits; instead, continue the inner offerings until the refinement and deliverance of the spirits commence, then return to the reed enclosure’s four gates to summon them forth.

**Section on the Principles of Ritual Purification: Preliminary Invocation and Altar Establishment**

Transmitted by the Perfected Adept of Profound Mystery, the Illuminating and Salvific Realized Person Ning Quanzhen; compiled by Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns and Master of the Numinous Treasure Lineage.

**Preliminary Invocation and Altar Establishment**

The *Preliminary Invocation* (宿启) is fundamentally the *Natural Audience* (自然朝), the ancestral rite of all purification ceremonies. At the inception of any purification rite, the *Natural Audience* must first be conducted. The *Audience* consists solely of kindling the incense burner to invoke the sages, offering obeisance to the directions, and performing repentance—three invocations and three prostrations. This is followed by the *Spreading of Declarations* (敷露), the recitation of vows and precepts, the *Supplementing of Offices* (补职), and the *Proclamation of Prohibitions* (宣禁). The present *Audience* is what the ritual codes term the *Submission to the Regulations* (馑依科法), and the *Preliminary Invocation* is precisely this.

The concluding line of the ritual code states: *"At dawn tomorrow, the Dao-circuits shall commence, and further invocations shall follow."* This signifies that the formal purification rite and Dao-circuits begin only the next morning. Since the rite is established on behalf of others, the intent of the purification must be announced to the true spirits in advance.

According to ancient codes, the *Preliminary Invocation* was always held at the *zi* hour (11 PM–1 AM) on the day the purification rite was to be established. However, in Lu Jianji’s *Numinous Treasure Rites for the Daoist’s Self-Cultivation and Alliance with the Perfected* (《灵宝道士自修盟真斋仪》), there is no *Preliminary Invocation*; instead, on the morning of the purification day, the precepts are recited, offices are supplemented, and the rite proceeds directly to the ascent of the altar and the Dao-circuits, followed by the verbal presentation of merits and petitions.

Furthermore, the *Zhengyi* scriptural codes state only: *"When establishing a purification rite, the Natural Audience must first be conducted,"* with no mention of the *Preliminary Invocation* or the dispersal of the altar. Zhang Ruohai of the *Cloud Radiance* lineage, unaware of the scriptural texts, presumptuously imposed his own views, penning nearly twenty spurious arguments that grossly contravene the teachings. As a result, later students, misled and errant, now recite precepts and supplement offices *before* the *Preliminary Invocation*, and only after receiving the tablets do they ascend the altar.

Du Guangcheng has rightly criticized this practice, noting that for grand purification rites, the sponsor must submit a petition in advance, which the High Merit Officer receives and memorializes, typically a month prior. Petitions and memorials are then presented in sequence, and talismanic decrees are issued. This is to conduct the affairs *before* supplementing offices—a reversal of proper order. How, then, can the High Merit Officer be permitted to supplement offices *before* the preliminary announcement?

A careful examination of the scriptural codes reveals that the *Supplementing of Offices* is intended for the Dao-circuits to be held the following morning. Thus, the *Preliminary Invocation* and altar establishment do not pertain to the formal purification rite. Moreover, in Lu Jianji’s *Numinous Treasure Rites: Illuminating Candles, Precepts, Penalties, and Vows* (《灵宝斋说光烛戒罚祝愿仪》), it is stated: *"First, the Preliminary Invocation is completed; next, the Ten Precepts are conferred, and offices are supplemented. The assembled officers kneel to receive their tablets, and the following day, the Dao-circuits proceed according to their designated roles. Then, the Thirty-Six Prohibitions are proclaimed, and the majestic ordinances are announced."* This clearly indicates that the recitation of precepts, supplementing of offices, and proclamation of prohibitions must occur *after* the *Preliminary Invocation*—a sequence explicitly prescribed in the codes and thus most appropriate.

From the Jin through the Tang dynasties, this tradition remained unaltered.

Now, Zhang Ruohai of the Cloud Radiance tradition has propagated reckless and unfounded doctrines, which some shallow scholars have taken as their source—this only reveals their failure to broadly examine the ancient codes as they truly are.

A single day of observance is called a *zhai-hui* (fasting assembly). Only when it extends to three days or more is it properly termed a *zhai* (fast). Some last seven or nine days, and the longest may span a full month. These durations are all recorded in the scriptural codes, as set forth in the *Scriptural Writings of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate*, which also prescribes the essentials of fasting, precepts, and majestic rites. The Celestial Master Lu culled the scriptural essentials to compile the *Rites of Fasting, Thanksgiving, Precepts, and Penalties*. Whether for the Three Registers or the Nine Dark Realms, whether for delivering the suffering from the mire of bitterness—whether three days, seven days, one watch, or nine watches—the categories may be numerous, but the ritual norms remain one. To trace the stream to its source, apart from the Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the Celestial Master Lu, to whom else could one turn?

In recent times, the rite of supplementing offices has seen the addition of superfluous procedures, such as the "upper and lower relinquishment discussions" and the phrase *"assigning so-and-so to the role of..."*—this has often obstructed the High Functionary’s duties. Moreover, how could such roles be filled by those who merely consume the offerings of the assembly? Furthermore, in the *Fasting Codes* compiled by Li Jingqi, on the day of altar construction, a *Natural Audience* is conducted in the afternoon, followed by the recitation of precepts, the return to the Mystic Master’s tent, the supplementing of offices, and the proclamation of prohibitions. Only then, at night, is the *Preliminary Invocation* performed according to the codes. This would mean conducting two *Natural Audiences* on the day of altar construction—is this not redundant?

Today, all such practices have been corrected to conform to the ancient codes: after the *Preliminary Invocation* and the *Three Rituals*, the *Exposition* is delivered, followed by the *Proclamation of Words*. Before the *Return to the Censer*, the recitation of precepts, supplementing of offices, and proclamation of prohibitions are carried out, aligning with the original codes of the Celestial Master Lu and avoiding adherence to vulgar customs.

**Preliminary Invocation and Altar Construction**
The guiding principle states: Before entering the altar tent, one must visualize oneself as the Azure Mystery Lord of the Nine Heavens, attended by jade lads and jade maidens, emerging from the Gates of Wondrous Mystery upon beams of light, bearing banners and staves and standing before the Dao. In the course of the ritual, one invokes the Nine Phoenix Officers of Destruction and Purification, who descend with sprays and exhalations, transforming the mundane into the sacred. At the Earth Portal, the altar is consecrated with water according to the method.

**Consecration of the Altar**
*Bowing and Submission of the Purification Memorial*
**Supplementing Offices**
The heavens possess six revolutions, corresponding to the establishment of the Six Offices. When constructing the fast and conducting the Dao-circuits, these six roles must be assigned to align with the lofty heavens.

**Ascending the Altar**
Whenever ascending the altar, one first offers incense at the Six Curtains. Next, two attendants—one bearing the hand censer and the other the chime—lead the way, guiding the Dharma Master to ascend the altar. The ritual assembly, in majestic array, divides into left and right ranks and stands in order before the altar.

The High Functionary ascends to the Outer Altar and stands outside the Earth Portal, reciting the secret incantation. Upon entering the portal to ascend the Middle Altar, the assembly follows. In common practice, the participants proceed in a circular procession, with the High Functionary trailing behind the assembly. Upon reaching the Xun Portal at the Outer Altar, the High Functionary moves ahead, entering the Earth Portal first, while the assembly halts. The High Functionary then steps aside to allow the others to pass—a most undignified arrangement.

Thus, the *Established Rites of the Jiang Clan* also states: *"Whenever ascending the altar, the High Functionary leads; when descending, the High Functionary follows."* This aligns with the ancient codes and is most fitting.

Once the High Functionary has entered the portal, the entire assembly enters the altar. The Chief Lector circles to the east of the Middle Altar and stands facing west, while the Six Offices remain at the west of the Middle Altar, facing east. The High Functionary, together with the fast officers, ascends through the Heavenly Gate to the Inner Altar and offers incense to the Ten Directions. By day, one begins with the east; by night, with the north. Next, incense is offered at the Imperial Table, and after the censer is lit, the secret incantation is recited while visualizing as prescribed.

After the fast officers have offered incense, they exit the Heavenly Gate, circumambulate leftward to the northwest of the Middle Altar, and stand. The High Functionary returns to his position, offers incense in the hand censer, recites the secret incantation, and proceeds according to the codes. Upon completing the *Return to the Censer*, the attendants with the hand censer and chime perform their duties first, followed by the assembly, while the High Functionary exits and enters the Inner Altar through the Heavenly Gate.

In recent times, some have entered both the Middle and Inner Altars through the Earth Portal and exited through the Heavenly Gate—this is incorrect. The ritual methods of Du Guangcheng and Lu Jianji both prescribe entering through the Earth Portal, ascending through the Heavenly Gate, and offering incense to the Ten Directions, a practice established since antiquity and not to be altered by vulgar custom. The Inner Altar models the heavens, and thus one must exit and enter through the Heavenly Gate.

**Sung Exhortation**
The guiding principle states: The Mystic Master stands at the front, dividing the ranks. The High Functionary offers incense, bows three times, kneels, and makes the announcement upon completing the fast. The incantation reads:

*"May the Master attain the Dao, and may I ascend in flight.
Deliver the seven ancestors and parents,
free them from the five sufferings and eight difficulties,
and swiftly ascend to the celestial halls,
where their names are inscribed in the registers of immortals."*

Another version reads:
*"May the Master attain the Dao, and may I become a flying immortal.
Deliver the mysterious ancestors,
dissolving their sins and sufferings.
Inscribe their names in the registers of immortals,
and ascend to the imperial court."*

The fast officer presents the document of words, and the petitioner kneels to receive it before announcing the fast. The Inspector of the Fast proclaims the office assignments, after which the Sung Exhortation begins. After offering incense at the corridor curtains, the petitioner goes outside the main gate to invoke the *Preliminary Invocation* and proclaim the *Memorial for the Preliminary Invocation*, then enters the portal.

The petitioner enters the Outer Altar first and stands outside the Earth Portal. The secret incantation reads:

*"Four Upper Merit Officers, Dragon-Tiger Envoys,
Primordial qi of the Orthodox Unity,
and the Serene Maidens of the Void—
when there are nighttime invocations,
may they be made clear.
May the youthful lads of the Upper Mystery
and the maidens serve as ministers,
all entering the Yellow Chamber within,
to convey the invocations and ensure they are heard above."*

*Jade Clarity Seal.*

The *Principles* state: When entering a portal, step first with the left foot, then the right; when exiting, step first with the right, then the left. One must visualize the Fragrant Officer Envoys, the Dragon and Tiger Lords of the Left and Right, and the various spirit-officials attendant upon incense. In the morning, one should also visualize the Four Luminous Merit Officers, one Communicating-with-Dao Envoys, two Jade Lads of Serene Attendants, and two Jade Maidens for Transmission, all arrayed to left and right. At night, one visualizes the Four Upper Merit Officers, the Serene Maidens, the Enlightening Lads, and the Upper Mystery Maidens, each one arrayed to left and right. "Entering the portal" refers to entering the Earth Portal. When ascending the altar, one stands to the left of the Earth Portal and recites the secret incantation in visualization. When exiting the portal, one visualizes the officials, generals, and jade maidens transmitting the sincerity of the fast, each dispersing in turn.

According to the *Scriptural Regulations of the Three Caverns*, the jade maidens entering and exiting portals all employ this incantation. Recently, some shallow-minded scholars, seeing that the *Essential Principles of the Orthodox Unity* use this incantation for morning and evening observances, have claimed that the methods of the *Cavernous Mystery* and the registers of the Dao should be altered accordingly—how mistaken they are!

**Offering Incense to the Ten Directions**
The *Principles* state: When the petitioner ascends the Heavenly Gate to enter the Inner Altar, one must first offer incense to the Ten Directions, beginning with the East by day and the North by night. When offering incense, bow while holding the ritual tablet, then light the incense and hold the memorial slip to announce one’s name. Bow again and silently recite one’s title and position, then place the memorial slip to the right of the spirit tablet. Next, proclaim the memorial document and burn it. Proceed thus for each direction. Only when establishing the altar is the memorial document used; otherwise, when ascending the altar, one holds the memorial slip, and when dispersing the altar, one holds the memorial of gratitude.

**Offering Incense at the Imperial Table**
The incense at the Imperial Table is offered before the central table in the presence of the Supreme Emperor. It is also called the *Cavern Table*—*cavern* meaning "to communicate," the place where incense is burned to reach the true and the numinous. In the ritual arena, it stands before the Jade Clarity; in the altar, it stands before the Three Treasures. The verse "Incense smoke rises from the Cavern Table" refers to this table.

The *Principles* state: When offering incense at the Cavern Table, one must first visualize the Three Treasures, then offer incense to the Ten Directions. First, visualize the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning seated directly upon the Yang Throne. Next, visualize the Most High Lord of the Dao to the left and the Most High Lord Lao to the right, each seated beside the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, their radiance brilliant and resplendent, all duly arrayed in proper attendance. Then visualize the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures to the left of the Three Worthies, with jade lads and maidens, immortal youths and kings, immortal lords and ministers in proper attendance. Next, visualize the Great Master of the Mystery-within-the-Mystery to the right of the Three Worthies, directly opposite the scriptures, with true attendants to left and right as prescribed.

For pure fasts, silently invoke the Celestial Worthies of Numinous Treasure of the Ten Directions. For yin fasts, invoke the Celestial Worthy of Great Unity Who Saves from Suffering.

The *Principles* state: The center of the altar is beneath the Golden Gate. Step forward with the left foot, and with the two-step Star Pearl Illuminating Pace, proceed to stand before the main incense burner and release the mudra.

**Star Pearl Illuminating Pace**
**Incantation for Treading the Pace:**
*"Jade Clarity’s crimson and plain,
Great Brahma’s flowing streams.
The primordial net unfurls,
Star pearls encircle all.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands!"*

With the left hand form the *zi* trigram, and from the center of the *wu* trigram, step forward, slightly opening both eyes like the sun and moon.

**Incantation for Offering Incense:**
*"Jade blossoms scatter radiance,
Nine qi congeal as mist.
Fragrant clouds densely woven,
Ascend straight to the Nine Heavens.
Golden Lad of Incense Attendants,
Jade Maiden of Transmission—
May it be heard before the Emperor,
Granting your servant long life.
For generations as divine immortals,
All petitions and vows,
May they be fulfilled as spoken!"*

Visualize the jade maidens, golden lads, dragons, and tigers beside the incense burner.

**Three Pinches of Incense:**
The first pinch of incense ascends to the Jade Clarity realm,
The second pinch of incense ascends to the Highest Clarity realm,
The third pinch of incense ascends to the Grand Clarity realm.
*"Numinous light and Brahma qi,
Descend and infuse your servant’s body.
Flying incense advances in offering,
Uniting with the Dao in the imperial court.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands!"*

With the left hand, form the Three Officials mudra.

The *Principles* state: Close your eyes and transform the altar maidens. Above, connect to the Yellow qi of the Heavenly Gate, intertwining like azure clouds and crystal, with the sun, moon, and stars exchanging radiance. Below, link to the center of the numinous altar, where mushroom canopies and flowered banners stand to left and right, silent and majestic. Transform the mind-palace to bloom open like a lotus, with one luminous scene at its center, a golden light suspended within.

Burn one *True Writ of Jade Script* in the main incense burner and recite the incantation:
*"Primordial qi of the Celestial Worthy,
Uniting with the numinous script.
No script is not delivered,
No script is not radiant.
Crimson writ on jade stalks,
Dragon scripts trailing brilliance.
Your servant now burns and transforms it,
Ascending to the Jade Chamber.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands!"*

With both hands, form the Jade Clarity mudra, and visualize the three-tiered Towering Golden Gate of Resplendent Light. Within it sits the Most High, ascending nine steps, the altar suffused with radiant qi. The petitioner’s heart pours forth sincerity, seeking grace and petitioning for the Mandate. The Emperor grants the request, and the altar ground becomes like the realm of Primordial Yang, utterly free of the slightest dust.

Jade maidens and golden lads transmit incense and present memorial slips, golden light arrayed in crossing patterns like woven threads. To the left, the Five Elders ride cinnabar chariots, flying through empty space to descend. To the right, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors arrive together in phoenix carriages, all bowing in homage to the Three True Ones. The Five Masters step forward to pay their respects, and the Three Officials and Four Saints all ride this light to descend upon the numinous altar. Then the Five Marchmounts, the Four Seas, and the hosts of perfected beings bow in homage to left and right. The city gods of the curtains and enclosures, the officials and generals of the Thunder Bureau, all guard and protect front and rear. Here, the sun, moon, and stars exchange radiance, moving to connect with the realm.

Burn the *True Talisman for Summoning the Numinous* in the main incense burner and recite the incantation:
*"Mandate of the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning,
Summoning the ten thousand numinous beings.
Numinous light universally illuminates,
The Three Realms are thoroughly bright.
Jade talismans fly down,
Uniting with the imperial court.
Grant your servant to present petitions,
Ascending to the Jade Clarity.
Clouds and mist fly in offering,
Unceasing, moment by moment.
Swiftly ascend the Jade Gate,
Uniting with the Dao in truth.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands!"*

*"Highest Clarity and Numinous Treasure,
Jade Clarity summons the numinous.
Divine light wondrously transforms,
Myriad millions arrive together.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands!"*

From the center, trace outward in a circle, then from the Central Palace upward to the Upper Palace, and trace the *wu* trigram out of the incense burner.

**General Summons of the Heavens Spell**

The Cavernous Mystery shines with primordial radiance,
The Three Qi form a straight path.
The Five Phases move in their course,
The Three Heavens revolve in motion.
Hasten, hasten to come,
All spirits heed the call.
Swiftly, swiftly,
As the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning commands.

With the Jade Clarity mudra, trace and break open the barrier;
Within the Dipper, the Three Lights,
The Five Directions descend their qi,
The Heavenly Perfected Maidens,
Incense-bearing and message-transmitting Maidens,
Dragon-Tiger Perfected Ones—
All stand before the imperial altar.

**Incense at the Primary Position**
This ritual protocol marks the beginning of the fast,
Where memorials to the court take precedence.
Following the protocol ensures no lapse in speech or conduct,
Thus the ritual text is established.
Stand upright with the jade tablet,
Do not hold the scroll—
Hence the ritual table is placed before the High Master’s standing position.
Most now use a single hibiscus-wood stand,
Just large enough to hold the ritual book,
While incense is offered from the hand censer with secret incantations.
Secret incantations mean reciting the words while the heart contemplates the audience with the Celestial Emperor.

Jiang’s *Established Rites* prescribes a separate incense burner on the ritual table,
With the censer placed to one side,
Intending to expand the ritual table.
Yet in practice, none follow this.
If the altar space is too narrow to accommodate the primary incense position,
One may revert to the ancient method of offering incense from the hand censer.

The *Principle* states:
The officiant retreats from the main censer to their position,
Bows thrice and kneels,
Holding the hand censer to offer incense three times,
Reciting the secret incantation:
The Dao is studied in the heart,
The heart conveys it through incense.
Holding the jade censer,
The heart dwells before the Emperor.
True numina gaze down,
Immortal lattices approach the hall.
Grant your servant to petition,
Ascending to the Nine Heavens.

Another incantation:
Emptiness manifests through form,
The heart transmits through incense.
What the heart conveys
Is neither fire nor smoke.
Grant your servant to petition,
Ascending to the Nine Heavens.
True numina are moved to respond,
Not requiring words to proclaim sincerity.
Secret incantations mean silently contemplating the audience with the Celestial Emperor,
Thus it is said: "Not requiring words to proclaim."
It is also said: This incantation comes from Yang Jie’s *Xuanhe Jinlu Rituals*.

**Each Pays Homage to the Masters with Contemplation as Prescribed**

To pay homage to the masters is to honor the Three Masters of the Scriptures, Registers, and Transmission.
Guangcheng said:
The *scriptures* (jing) are distant,
For the scriptures are the distant masters,
The teachers of the register masters.
Through the master’s transmission,
One does not forget the source.
The *registers* (lu) are the means,
For transmitting the true learning of the Dao,
Where master and disciple are interdependent—
The disciple of the scripture master,
The master of the transmission master.
*Transmission* (du) means advancement,
Advancing my mortal form,
Ascending to the ranks of the Dao,
From the mundane to the true—
All depends on the master,
One’s own master.
The Dao cannot be without a master,
For even the smallest method or mudra
Is none but the master’s transmission.
How much more so for wearing the scriptures and registers,
Conducting great rites,
Presiding over fasts and cultivations,
Delivering humans and heavens—
How could this be without a master?
In ancient times, when transmitting registers,
Those who already held registers served as masters.
In the middle ages, with the establishment of ancestral altars,
Private transmissions were forbidden,
Thus the transmission of scriptures and registers
Had to be conducted with the ancestral altar as the master.
If one inherits the Numinous Treasure tradition,
And petitions to receive the fast rituals,
One must contemplate and bow to the Three Masters
According to the method one has received.
Or, if one has received scriptures from a master outside the registers,
One should also contemplate and honor them.
But if, for the sake of receiving scriptures,
One neglects the master who transmitted the method,
This is impermissible.
The scriptures are the remnants of the Dao,
The methods are the application of the scriptures.
To regard only the transmission of scriptures as essential,
And not honor the master who transmits the method,
Would be partial indeed.
The registers arise from the scriptures;
Without the scriptures, there is no method.
Those who practice heterodox teachings or miscellaneous methods outside the true teaching
Are not included in the contemplations at the altar.

The *Principle* states:
The role of the *doujiang* (liturgist) is governed by the White Emperor of the West,
For metal governs sound,
And metal is the palace of solemn execution,
Thus they alone lead the chanting.
Whenever the chant is raised,
Each pays homage to the masters with contemplation as prescribed,
All officials hold their tablets upright in their hearts.
With focused gaze and concentrated mind,
Follow the text below to pay homage.

First, contemplate the direction where the scripture master resides—
The direction of their dwelling.
Contemplate their appearance, taboo name, and title,
Bow thrice in the heart, and pray:
May my master attain the immortal Dao,
Ascend to the lofty numina,
Deliver me and all beings,
All attaining the true Dao,
My own form ascending and being delivered.

Next, contemplate the direction where the register master resides,
Bow thrice in the heart, and pray:
May my master attain flying immortality,
Ascend to the lofty perfected.
Deliver my seven generations of ancestors,
That they may be born early in the heavens,
I attain the true Dao,
And ascend into the formless.

Next, contemplate the direction where the transmission master resides,
Bow thrice in the heart, and pray:
May my master attain ascension and deliverance,
Ascend to the lofty immortals.
Deliver me from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
My name entered in the immortal registers,
Forever becoming a perfected one.

Next, contemplate the descent of the Three Masters from the heavens,
And bow to them in the heart.
Contemplate golden light filling the chamber,
All transformed into the land of the Three Treasures,
Each adorned with haloed radiance,
Immortals and perfected ones of the ten directions arrayed in ranks.
The Scripture Master, the Perfected Yu Luoqiao,
From the Northwest Heavenly Gate,
Descends within the white qi to the altar.
The Register Master, the Perfected Zhen Dingguang,
From the Northwest Heavenly Gate,
Descends within the yellow qi to the altar.
The Transmission Master, the Perfected Guang Miaoyin,
From the Northwest Heavenly Gate,
Descends within the blue-green qi to the altar.

**Five Directions’ Guardian Spirits**

Contemplate the upright qi of the Five Directions—
Not the Three Pure Clouds.
The Three Names together generate the Nine Qi,
Which disperse into the ten thousand distinctions.
Divided into the great Five Qi,
In heaven they are the Five Stars,
On earth the Five Peaks,
In humans the Five Viscera,
In things the Five Phases,
In affairs the Five Constants.
Now, in the incantation, contemplate the descent of the upright qi of the Five Directions,
To repel demonic vapors,
And purify the altar space.

The blue-green qi of the East pertains to the liver,
Corresponding above to Jupiter,
Its season is spring,
Its emperor the Bluegreen Emperor.
All that pertains to wood
Is governed by the blue-green qi of the East.

The red qi of the South pertains to the heart,
Corresponding above to Mars,
Its season is summer,
Its emperor the Red Emperor.
All that pertains to fire
Is governed by the red qi of the South.

The white qi of the West pertains to the lungs,
Corresponding above to Venus,
Its season is autumn,
Its emperor the White Emperor.
All that pertains to metal
Is governed by the white qi of the West.

The black qi of the North pertains to the kidneys,
Corresponding above to Mercury,
Its season is winter,
Its emperor the Black Emperor.
All that pertains to water
Is governed by the black qi of the North.

The yellow qi of the Center pertains to the spleen,
Corresponding above to Saturn,
Its season is the four quarters,
Its emperor the Yellow Emperor.
All that pertains to earth
Is governed by the yellow qi of the Center.

Thus, the armies of the Five Directions and Five Emperors are presided over by these spirits.
The method of contemplating their descent is to visualize in an instant the qi of each direction following its color, with each containing historiographer-soldiers descending, responding to the incantation’s summons to guard and protect the ritual altar.

The essential instruction states: Close the eyes for a long while, inwardly envision the Five Viscera and Five Peaks, the Five Stars and Five Emperors arrayed in defense within the body.
Next, contemplate the blue-green, yellow, and white qi filling the numinous altar, the Four Numinous Beasts standing guard, the ten thousand spirits arrayed in solemn ranks. Inwardly visualize the golden light shining as a canopy, the entire body transformed into golden radiance.
First, let it emerge from the lungs to the nape of the neck, generating a circular halo that illuminates the body in all ten directions, revealing all within and without.

For the Eastern incantation, trace the *mao* talisman. Envision Jupiter’s Cavern Gate and Vermilion Terrace, located one inch behind the eyes, emitting the Ninefold Numinous Azure Jade Light to envelop the body.
Suddenly, it enters through the mouth and nose, pouring into the liver palace, gleaming like translucent azure beryl.

Next, envision the blue-green light filling the body, swirling within and without, shooting straight toward the East like a blue-green cloud covering the altar space.

For the Southern incantation, trace the *li* talisman. Envision Mars’ Jade Gate and Resplendent Chamber, located five *fen* within the eyes, emitting the Threefold Numinous Crimson Radiance to envelop the body.
Then it enters through the nose, pouring into the heart palace, glowing like the brilliance of the sun.

Next, envision the red qi filling the body, swirling within and without, shooting straight toward the South like a crimson cloud covering the altar space.

For the Western incantation, trace the *you* talisman. Envision Venus’ Jade Pendants and Purple Gate, located one inch between the brows, emitting the Sevenfold Numinous White Floral Qi to envelop the body.
Then it enters through the mouth and nose, pouring into the lung palace, shining like the luminous essence of the moon.

Next, envision the white light filling the body, swirling within and without, shooting straight toward the West like a white cloud covering the altar space.

For the Northern incantation, trace the *zi* talisman. Envision Mercury’s Imperial Homeland and Primordial Palace, located one inch within the hairline, emitting the Fivefold Numinous Amethyst Light to envelop the body.
Then it enters through the mouth and nose, pouring into the kidney palace, glowing like the radiance of amethyst.

Next, envision the purple light filling the body, swirling within and without, shooting straight toward the North like a purple cloud covering the altar space.

For the Central incantation, trace the *zhong* talisman. Envision Saturn’s Golden Chamber and Everlasting Valley, located two inches within the philtrum, emitting the Twelvefold Numinous Yellow Floral Light to envelop the body.
Then it enters through the mouth and nose, pouring into the spleen palace, gleaming like translucent yellow blossoms, luxuriant within.

Next, envision the yellow light filling the body, swirling within and without, shooting straight toward the Center like a yellow cloud covering the altar space.

Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.
Guangcheng said: The ritual drum rectifies the inner spirit-qi and extinguishes demonic numina; it is the first priority in all ritual affairs.
Whenever the cantor begins the chant, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times. If the drum is sounded during the visualization, not only does it disrupt the proper rhythm, but it also reveals ignorance of the visualization—how could one comprehend the celestial statutes?
Later students, unfamiliar with the dignified deportment, merely seek to imitate the conduct of senior masters. Yet by deviating from the ritual regulations, they falsely claim to meet the standards.
Thus, those who remain unenlightened and persist in delusion have long since made this a common practice, merely pursuing the recitation of ornate texts—this is decidedly incorrect.
The great ritual relies on precision and reverence. Focus the mind and concentrate the thoughts, prioritizing dignified conduct to ensure compliance with the standards.
If the ritual regulations are deficient and the mind is not applied, how can one align with the Dao?
Then the exalted perfected will not descend, and blessings will not arrive; instead, one will incur transgressions and reproach.
Those who seek to align with the Dao must adhere to the established procedures and verify the ritual measures.
Do not treat minor matters carelessly, for as the saying goes: a deviation of one *fen* leads to a loss of a thousand *li*.

The essential instruction states: Strike the left teeth as the Celestial Bell, the right teeth as the Celestial Chime, and the central teeth together as the Ritual Drum.
The striking serves as the rhythm.
The twenty-four strikes correspond to the three eights, summoning the twenty-four spirits of the Three Divisions and Eight Sceneries within the body, dispersing the perfected and true.

The proper method is to visualize the spirit-qi during the twenty-four drum strikes, so that the spirit-qi becomes clear and penetrates the Jade Clarity.
Envision the blue-green, yellow, and white qi within the body ascending from the cinnabar palace, passing through the Five Viscera, rising to the Muddy Pellet, and directly piercing the Heavenly Gate to merge with the Primordial Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin. They coalesce into a lapis lazuli treasure hall where the exalted sages reside at the center, with the perfected arrayed in ranks.

**Emit the furnace and summon the spirits**
Burn the talisman for dispersing the perfected and true spirits, and the talismans for summoning the incense officials.

The essential instruction states: The practitioner holds the hand censer, silently visualizing their body within the blue-green, yellow, and white qi clouds, surrounded by darkness within and without, the Four Numinous Beasts standing guard, and the ten thousand sages arrayed in solemn ranks.
Next, trace the *zhong* talisman and invoke the Supreme Three Heavens, so that they descend into the practitioner’s body in accordance with the ritual, summoning the spirits.
Summoning the spirits refers to summoning the incense officials, memorial officers, and the hundred spirits who guard the precincts—not the officials who present memorials or petitions.
For the spirit-qi and heaven and earth are one; wherever the thought reaches, the spirit follows the thought and goes. It permeates heaven as heaven, permeates earth as earth.
As the *Scripture of Salvation* states: "Above, it roams the Upper Clarity; below, it guards the human body."
Emit the furnace: externally, heat the incense to convey sincerity; internally, summon the officials to dispatch the spirits.
When inner and outer sincerity are complete, the spirits ascend to heaven and descend to earth without obstruction—this is called "communicating with the perfected and reaching the numinous."

Proclaim the Primordial Three Qi of the Supreme Three Heavens—Upper, Middle, and Lower—unto our bodies.

At the hours of *chou* and *yin*, the Three and Five Merit Officers; from *mao* to *chen*, another version states the Five Directions Formula, returning to the life-destined palace. The Left and Right Official Envoys; from *si* to *wu*, another version states *mao* and *you*. The Left and Right Incense-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders; from *wei* to *shen*. The Incense-Attending Golden Youth at *you*, another version states entering the center. The Word-Transmitting, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens at *xu*; the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans at *hai*, another version states the Five Directions returning to the center. The Day-Official Incense Officers, rotating from *chou* and *chen* to *wu*, each thirty-six in number, emerge.

Visualize the Courier Dragon Riders clad in red robes with black hems, along with the Merit Officers, Youths, and Incense Officials descending from the Heavenly Gate. Then visualize those within your own body emerging from the brain, each merging into one, proceeding to the altar to stand in attendance on the left and right, thirty-six on each side.

Release the talisman to open the earth-altar; at *xu*, return to the central text. Proceed before the throne, from the upper text to *wu*, emerging from the censer. Visualize the couriers all receiving the words, bearing the incense as they depart.

Next, silently recite the incantation:
*Within, there is luminosity; without, there is direction.
Inner and outer radiant, utterly without residue.
Abide in stillness to await it—thus its manifest form appears.*

The formula states:
*Atop the Mud-Pill Palace, lofty and exalted,
Encircling the mountain, the Nine Palaces arrayed.
The first peak, crimson light and purple mist,
Where the Jade Thearch and Heavenly Emperor reside.
At the sounding of jade chimes and golden bells,
Summon the myriad spirits to audience in the upper vault.
The Red Child of the Middle Realm transmits the imperial will,
Traversing all offices to attend in person.
The host of perfected, arrayed in ranks, must not hasten—
Swiftly pass the twelve-storied tower of layers.
Gaze upward at the celestial countenance, eyes conjoined,
Together extolling the imperial virtue and sacred merit.
Upright and reverent, in non-action’s pure and tranquil breeze,
The myriad people rely upon it, ever harmonious.
Sovereign and ministers rejoice in boundless longevity,
Forever preserving heaven and earth in undivided unity.*

**Emerging the Officials**
Emerging the officials refers to manifesting the true officials within the High Merit’s body. First, visualize a vermilion gate one foot and eight inches wide upon the forehead—the vermilion gate being the gate within the brain. The scribes and soldiers emerge from this gate, descending to array themselves before the altar.

Know that only when qi merges with qi, spirit with spirit, utterly without separation, may one enter its domain. Thus is attained the wondrous efficacy of the Numinous Treasure’s descent of the perfected. Lest this be lightly divulged, it must be secretly transmitted by one’s master.

First emerge the Three Generals and Four Numinous Spirits, escorting before and behind, left and right, then proceed to emerge the officials. These are employed when bowing and establishing the altar’s petitions; otherwise, they are not used.

The essential method states: The adept knocks the teeth twenty-four times, kneels lengthily, and first visualizes the Four Numinous Spirits emerging from the head to stand before, behind, left, and right. Next, visualize the sun, moon, and five stars covering the head, the Northern Dipper enveloping the form, and green qi from the liver filling the dark altar, radiant as sun and moon.

Next, visualize General Tang emerging from the left kidney, bearing the Jade Talisman of the Marshal; General Ge emerging from the right kidney, wielding the Great Halberd; General Zhou emerging from the heart, brandishing the Jade Axe of Command. Then visualize the Three Generals descending from the Heavenly Gate to merge with the spirits emerging from the body, all clad in cloud-patterned robes with wide sleeves, jade crowns upon their heads, standing before the altar. The soldiers, three hundred thousand in number, all clad in vermilion, resplendent, each emerge from their respective palaces to encircle the body. The nine Wood Officials emerge from the liver, bearing bows on the left; the three Fire Officials emerge from the heart, bearing spears on the front left.

The seven Metal Officials emerge from the lungs, bearing swords on the right. The five Water Officials emerge from the kidneys, wielding halberds at the rear. The twelve Earth Officials emerge from the spleen, holding spears on the front right. The Generals of the Five Virtues/Powers of the Four Directions emerge from the five viscera, clad in five-colored robes, their forms like jade spirits, arrayed in the four directions, issuing forth from their palaces according to the method.

**Summoning All Officials**
As previously visualized, once the invocation is complete, next form the Dipper mudrā and rise, then the mudrā of Returning to the Supreme Emperor. Proclaim the incantation to dispatch the ministers from within the body, reaching the Heavenly Ding Mighties. Visualize each in turn, summoning the spirits from within the body, imagining the officials and soldiers emerging from the brain to the left, right, front, and rear.

Next, trace from the center line to the root, circling the roots of the two fingers, then to the *si* line and flick. Then recite the incantation:

*"One body, empty and still—
what emerges, what enters?
This is the ritual form;
breath and exhalation reach it."*

**Summoning Each Official from the Body**
The Five True Officials of the Five Bodies emerge from the five viscera at the *mao* line. The Direct Envoys of the Upper Immortals and Upper Spirits emerge from the shoulders—or, some say, from the kidneys; others, from the cheeks—at the *you* line. The Direct Envoy of Merit, the Orthodox Unity Merit Envoy, emerge from both shoulders—or, some say, from the heart—at the *zi* line.

The Merit Envoy for Healing Illness emerges from the spleen. The Left and Right Official Envoys emerge from the spleen and lungs, bearing banners and staffs. *Wu* line. The Yin-Yang Divine Judgment Officials emerge from the heart and kidneys. *Chou* and *yin* lines.

What is called "emerging the officials" should be performed according to the ritual when establishing an altar and reciting petitions; otherwise, it is unnecessary. The same procedure applies to the first audience and the rite of gratitude.

**Proceeding According to the Ritual**
The officiant stands upright, holding the ritual jade tablet, visualizing themselves as a Perfected One, and declares the invocation to awaken the sacred. Next, they pay homage to the ten directions, beginning from this point.

Heaven engenders water, the primordial *qi* of Heaven, around which all stars gather toward the North—thus the rite commences here.

**Principle States:**
The officiant, together with the altar officials, offers incense to the ten directions. For each direction, incense is offered once, followed by a bow upon returning to position. After completing the bows, they kneel in prolonged repentance.

**Repentance**
*Principle States:* The officiant kneels before the incense burner in repentance. The altar officials, in conducting the fast and performing the Dao, may have transgressed prohibitions or violated ritual codes, accumulating various transgressions. Yet, with sincere devotion before the altar, may no demonic trials obstruct us, and may our prayers be answered. Next, they repent for the three karmic actions and six senses, as well as the sins accumulated by the deceased over lifetimes, praying for grace to deliver them and accomplish the ritual’s merit.

**Threefold Invocation of the Scriptures**
*Principle States:* Having completed repentance, it is proper to venerate the scriptures. Thus, they chant the *Three Invocations*, pacing the void while performing three bows.

**Veneration of the Three Treasures**
*Principle States:* Whenever venerating the Three Treasures, one concentrates the mind and performs three bows.

**Spreading the Revelation**
To establish a jade altar is to model Heaven and emulate Earth, arranging the sun, moon, and five planets, harmonizing yin and yang, aligning the celestial lodges, and erecting the altar’s boundary. The mortal realm is transformed into a golden palace with jade steps, where the myriad Perfected and Saints gather in assembly.

At the appointed time, when the directions are not yet fixed and the forms and *qi* remain unsettled, in the space between bowing and rising, it is as if the cosmos turns in the palm of one’s hand. One must then employ the twenty-eight constellations and the jade scripts of the five directions to summon and settle the divine Perfected, pacifying the five quarters, dispelling malevolent influences, and purifying the altar space. Only by harmonizing the square and the round, entering stillness and motion, can the Most Exalted reside in the mystery of the Dao’s transformation, and the sun and moon circulate in perfect order.

Just as the sovereign of the realm sits enthroned in the ninefold palace, with ministers attending to governance, so too, from the moment the altar is established, the left assembly begins its administration—this being the court where the masters and Perfected of the Three Heavens of Great Mystery convene.

**Spreading the True Writ** requires meticulous observance. There are four methods:
1. **Spreading and Settling:** Invoking the Five Celestial Thearchs and their divine soldiers to descend and pacify the altar. The *Five Chapters* are the primordial *qi* of the five directions, harmonizing yin and yang to guard the ritual space. One burns the *Five Thearchs’ Nurturing Life Talismans*, summoning the thirty-two Celestial Thearchs to deliver beings according to the directions and present memorials.
2. **Revelation:** Displaying silk banners, golden dragons, and jade tablets to manifest sincerity.
3. **Spreading the True Writ:** These are the treasured scripts of the Nine Heavens and the numinous essences of auspicious clouds. Written in talismanic script, they rectify the sun and moon when they lose their proper course, and in the center, they avert calamities and blessings for the people.
4. **The Five Chapters:** Composed of the *qi* of the Nine Heavens, the secret names of the myriad heavens, and the constellations of the celestial circuit. They harmonize the earth’s generative forces, transforming yin into yang. They can also deliver the souls languishing in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, elevating them all to the Crimson Mound—this is the perfection of the Four Symbols.

Yet today’s unlearned practitioners merely invoke the name *Spreading the Revelation*, considering the beauty of the chant and the recitation of the text sufficient, without deeper inquiry. They fail to grasp the true fruit of deliverance—is this not lamentable?

**Guang Cheng** states: In ancient times, when the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning first divided the undifferentiated, the Three *Qi* unfolded the cosmic pattern. From the primordial essence of the Great Dao and the true unity of *qi*, the *Numinous Treasure Red Writ* coalesced into script, descending upon the five directions to pacify and stabilize Heaven and Earth, summoning the Perfected Spirits. Thus, Heaven and Earth were settled, the sun and moon shone brightly, ghosts and spirits were delivered, and the people attained longevity. The transmission of the True Writ to the world averts celestial disasters, protects and stabilizes the sovereign, dispels poison and harm to deliver the people, subdues ghosts and spirits, and rescues the suffering souls of the dark realms—there is nothing it cannot accomplish.

The scriptures say: Without the Writ, there is no illumination; without the Writ, there is no clarity; without the Writ, there is no establishment; without the Writ, there is no completion; without the Writ, there is no deliverance; without the Writ, there is no life. It is also said: The *Red Writ of Jade Scripts* and the *Eight Might Dragon Scripts* safeguard the kalpas, ensuring Heaven’s eternal endurance. Such is the wondrous efficacy of the *Numinous Treasure Five Chapters True Writ*.

Thus, it can rectify the celestial divisions, harmonize yin and yang, deliver the wandering souls, protect the sovereign, rescue the drowning, bridge the dark and the bright, reconcile transgressions, avert death, prolong life, and alleviate the sufferings of life and death—there is no affliction it cannot remedy. Therefore, when establishing a fast, the True Writ and Jade Scripts are installed to pacify the five directions. Upon concluding the altar rites, the talismans are gathered and burned, their ashes scattered in the blue smoke—this follows the method of the Jade Seal.

If a scholar seeks immortality and self-deliverance, aspiring to ascend the ranks of immortals and forever escape the offices of the dead, they should inscribe the Writ on a jade tablet and cast it into a renowned mountain on the days of the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, or their own birth year and day. This erases the sins recorded in the ledgers of past lives, and their name is inscribed in Heaven. Upon completion, they pass through the myriad heavens thrice, and the Three Officials and Nine Bureaus record their meritorious deeds. They bid farewell to the heavens above, and the myriad spirits pay reverence, the Five Thearchs attend as guards, the Three Realms’ administrators welcome them, and the thousand demons and ten thousand spirits dare not intrude.

The scriptures say: With unwavering resolve, all aspirations are fulfilled. Seven generations of ancestors ascend to the celestial offices, and the blessings of life and death respond in kind.

**Establishing the Altar with the Five Elders’ Red Writ**
1. The *Primordial Undifferentiated Red Writ*
2. The *Jade Writ for Subduing Evil* or the *Primordial Undifferentiated Jade Calendar*
3. The *Numinous Treasure Five Talismans*
For grand offerings, employ the *Hidden Language of the Great Brahma*.

**Invoking the True Writ**
*Principle States:* When spreading the Jade Scripts of the five directions, one must first invoke their descent. Place the True Writ and ritual offerings upon the altar table. The officiant offers incense, performs three bows, and kneels to present the petition. They raise both hands, forming the *Ten Heavenly Seals* above the Celestial Court, then execute the *Jade Clarity Seal*, striking the teeth seven times. Their eyes radiate the light of the sun and moon, which soars to the Celestial Court above, wheeling to illuminate their body. Within this light, the Primordial Vacuous August One appears, as if within a halo of radiance.

Then emit the radiant light from both eyes, merging it with the light of the sun and moon.

Next, present the memorial, detailing the purificatory offerings, and beseech the opening of the Purple Yang Jade Envoy to proclaim and descend the True Script of the Jade Writs, entrusting them to the officiant for pacifying the ritual altar. Dispel the old *qi*, summon the true numina, and conclude the invocation as desired. Silently recite the secret incantation for invoking descent:

*"Supreme Great Possession,
Myriad Spirits of Jade Clarity.
Cloud-Light Treasure Script,
Universally descend to the Imperial Court.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial August Lord commands."*

Within the *qi* of the Ancestral Origin, visualize the August Lord emitting a beam of multicolored radiance, casting it upon the True Writ. Execute the *Jade Clarity Seal*, gaze upon the single *qi*, and draw in the Most Revered from within the light of the sun and moon, merging it with one’s own form. Then strike the teeth three times, swallow the saliva once, and pacify the directions accordingly.

**East:** Offer incense upon the eastern altar table, burn the *Azure Emperor’s Nurturing Life Talisman*, proclaim the eastern memorial, place the True Writ upon the table, and secure it with the *Golden Dragon Ritual Token*. Proclaim the Jade Script of the East. The officiant visualizes the *qi* of the liver issuing from the eyes, merging with the external *qi* to form an azure forest *qi*, coalescing into a cloud-forest jade palace where the Azure Emperor resides. The Eight Stellar Mansions of the East pay homage to his palace, stars and constellations gleaming brilliantly. A single beam of azure *qi* and golden light emerges, pointing toward the Southern Palace. The officiant draws the azure *qi* into the liver repository through the mouth.

**South:** Offer incense upon the southern altar table, burn the *Vermilion Emperor’s Nurturing Life Talisman*, proclaim the southern memorial, place the True Writ upon the table, and secure it with the *Golden Dragon Ritual Token*. Proclaim the Jade Script of the South. The officiant visualizes the *qi* of the heart issuing from the throat and tongue, merging with the external *qi* to form the *qi* of empty Brahman, coalescing into a palace where the Vermilion Emperor resides. The Eight Stellar Mansions of the South pay homage, stars and constellations gleaming brilliantly. Within, a single beam of crimson *qi* arcs and passes toward the West. The officiant draws the vermilion *qi* into the cinnabar repository through the nose.

**West:** Offer incense upon the western altar table, burn the *White Emperor’s Nurturing Life Talisman*, proclaim the western memorial, place the Writ upon the table, and secure it with the *Golden Dragon Ritual Token*. Proclaim the Jade Script of the West. The officiant visualizes the *qi* of the lungs issuing from the eyes, merging with the external *qi* to form a palace of crystal and lapis lazuli where the White Emperor resides. The Seven Stellar Mansions of the West pay homage, constellations interweaving their radiance. A beam of golden-white *qi* transforms and passes directly toward the North. The officiant draws the pristine *qi* into the lung repository through the nose.

**North:** Offer incense upon the northern altar table, burn the *Black Emperor’s Nurturing Life Talisman*, proclaim the northern memorial, place the True Writ upon the table, and secure it with the *Golden Dragon Ritual Token*. Proclaim the Jade Script of the North. The officiant visualizes the *qi* of the kidneys issuing from both ears, coiling and merging externally to form a palace where the Black Emperor resides. The Eight Stellar Mansions of the North stand in homage, constellations intermingling their radiance, spraying upward and downward to connect with the Central Palace. The officiant draws the preceding *qi* into the Mysterious Palace through the nose.

**Center:** Offer incense upon the central altar table, burn the *Yellow Emperor’s Nurturing Life Talisman*, proclaim the central memorial, place the True Writ upon the table, and secure it with the *Golden Dragon Ritual Token*. Proclaim the Jade Script of the Center. The officiant circulates the essence of the cinnabar palace, merging it with the *qi* of the spleen’s origin, spraying it from the mouth to coalesce externally into a triple palace and triple tower—upper, middle, and lower layers—where the Yellow Emperor resides. Within, yellow *qi* spreads to connect with the *qi* of the four directions. Five stars, resembling a chariot wheel, hang above, their starlight radiating to illuminate the officiant’s form. Drawing in the two *qi*, swallowing the saliva, and withdrawing, this is called *"The Five Emperors Mounting the Scenery and Riding the Clouds to Audience in the Great Lofty Realm."*

It is further said: Visualize the thirty-two Celestial Emperors and their armies of the four directions, along with the twenty-eight stellar lords of the lunar mansions, descending to the central palace of the ritual altar. Visualize the Yellow Celestial Emperor, the armies of the Three Heavens, the great spirits of the Three Heavens, the stellar lords of earthly virtue, the nine immortals and nine sages, golden lads and jade maidens descending to the ritual altar. Proclaim the memorial to the numinous officials of the ten directions, leaving it upon the table. Disperse the altar by burning the memorial according to the liturgy.

Alternatively, the *Memorial for Establishing the Altar* may be recited here. Step the *Ding* and *Jiang* pacing, visualize, and prostrate as prescribed.

**Delivering the Precepts**
*Principle States:* The Dharma Master turns once and stands facing east, chanting: *"All officials bow their heads to the ground, silently paying homage to the ten directions with three bows, beginning from the north."* The officials sit facing west toward the east. Disciples at the altar receive the precepts together. The Dharma Master pinches incense three times, delivers the precepts according to the liturgy, and upon completion, circulates and returns to the ranks.

**Appointing Offices**
The heavens have six revolutions, establishing the six offices in turn. When establishing purificatory rites and performing the Dao, the six offices must be assigned to summon the lofty heavens.

*Principle States:* The officiant, together with the six officers, approaches the curtain of the Mystic Master to offer incense, perform three bows, and kneel to draw lots and receive their offices. They silently visualize the Three Officials and Mystic Master, maintaining pure sincerity, proclaiming the precept clauses, and presenting the oath of alliance. From this point onward, all conduct must be reported to the *Jianzhai* (Inspector of Purificatory Rites). Perform three bows according to the liturgy and withdraw; the same applies upon return. No negligence is permitted.

**Proclaiming the Thirty-Six Prohibitions**
The officiant and all officials sit in order to proclaim the prohibitions. The *Jianzhai* receives the penalty slips and performs three bows.

**Presenting the Mystic Memorial**
The officiant visualizes as prescribed, arriving at the Three Heavenly Gates beneath the Terrace of Supreme Mystery, at the office of the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Center, and pays homage according to the liturgy. Upon being seated, visualize rising, contemplating the intent of the memorial, and submitting it for transcription and presentation. It is issued throughout the Three Realms. Offer thanks, exit the Three Heavenly Gates, and proceed according to the liturgy to return the office and restore the furnace. If the Mystic Memorial is not issued, conduct oneself with mindfulness and recite praises.

**Restoring the Furnace and Returning the Spirits**
Burn the *Inverted Light Returning Chariot Talisman*. The officiant holds the hand censer and proclaims to all numinous officials, rotating from *Zi* to *Hai* to enter the center. Execute the *Three Realms Seal* and strike it outward. Visualize the spirits entering, draw in the *qi*, and swallow it into the cinnabar field.

Silently recite the incantation:
*"From the five bodily palaces of my form, the true officials, functionaries, and generals have been summoned forth. Entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right return to the right."*

After the recalled spirits arrive, proceed as before. Visualize the Celestial Worthies, the perfected of the Three Realms, and their attendant officials ascending together into the empyrean. Only the scribes and soldiers of the Five Emperors remain to guard the altar precincts. Gather the spirits and return them through the Gate of the Brain, consolidating them into the Three Palaces to merge as one.

Descend through the Gate of Heaven, exit through the Portal of Earth.

**Incantation for Exiting the Portal at Night:**
*"Mystery generates the Great Yin; the eight windows open in clarity.
All petitions hitherto presented, the Maiden transmits the numinous.
Following the heart’s transformation, peace is established in the Yellow Court."*

Once the rites are complete and all return to their stations, the myriad spirits settle in tranquility. Visualize the officials, generals, and jade maidens conveying the sincerity of the offering, each dispersing to their respective places. Exit the altar and approach the curtain; the officiant offers incense at the curtain of the Mystic Master, kneels, and bows thrice to present gratitude and acknowledge transgressions. Rising, he corrects his errors, returns to the oratory to resume his position, and offers incense thrice while bowing. The Perfected Master and all officials return to their stations.

**The Fifty-Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites concludes here.**

**The Fifty-Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Purity Numinous Treasure Great Rites**
*Transmitted by Ning Quanzhen, Perfected of Radiant Salvation and Deliverance from Suffering, Illustrious Adept of the Cavernous Mystery, to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity and Successor in the Numinous Treasure Lineage and Teaching*

**Gate of the Purificatory Rites’ Fundamental Principles: The Three-Day Observance**

The Three-Day Observance draws its model from the Seven-Treasured Mystic Terrace of the Purple Tenuity Upper Palace within the Jade Capital of the Mystic Metropolis of the Jade Purity Heaven. Each day at the hours of *yin*, *wu*, and *xu*, the ritual drum is sounded, and the Celestial Thearchs and Perfected Divinities of the Heavens ascend to attend the Primordial Beginning. From the Heaven of Pure Tenuity downward, all proceed to the audience. The rites of the Three-Day Observance are founded upon this.

**Sequence of the Audience Rites**
First, the High Master offers incense to convey reverence and sincerity. Next, the furnace is kindled, and the intent of the retreat is announced, summoning the deities within the body and invoking the local earth spirits to proclaim the register. Each declares their ritual rank, and the names and titles of all officials are communicated. Together, they present their sincerity and petition the host of sages, declaring the purpose of the retreat and the reasons for conducting the rites.

Then, the *qingci* is recited to express the heartfelt devotion of the retreat officers. In performing meritorious deeds during the audience, one must first offer prayers for the universal felicity of the sovereign and the realm, extending blessings to the nine generations of ancestors. Next, prayers are made for the living—this is the meaning of the triple offering of incense. For the deceased, one considers the accumulated transgressions of their lifetime; for the living, one reflects on their past faults. If these are not confessed and resolved before the Ten Directions and the Three Realms, and if no plea is made to the celestial and terrestrial bureaus, then even with earnest supplication, how can transgressions be dissolved? How can the mysterious grace descend?

Thus, one pays homage to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, performing repentance in each quarter, beseeching the sun, moon, and stars, the mountains, rivers, and sacred peaks, to pardon offenses and expunge the records of sin. The officials of the Three Realms who oversee and examine these matters are none other than the assembled sagely hosts of the retreat.

**Order of Progression**
When the Hall of Refined Contemplation is established, the officiant and retreat officers offer incense and bow thrice to the Perfected Master. They proceed to the six canopies and the canopy of the Mystic Master, offering incense thrice with bows, kneeling to announce the retreat. Chanting and circumambulation follow, with incense offered at the corridor canopies. They assemble outside the main gate, ascend the outer altar, enter the Earth Gate, and proceed to the central altar.

**Morning Entry Incantation (identical for the noon rite):**
*"Four Luminants, Merit Officers,
Divine Messengers, Jade Lads who transmit words,
Jade Maidens who attend the oratory—
as ministers, they convey our entreaties.
The qi of Primordial Life enters my body,
ensuring that all I declare reaches the heavens above."*

Standing to the left of the Earth Gate, one recites the incantation in secret, executes the Jade Purity mudra, and visualizes the incense officials, the Dragon and Tiger Lords, the attending spirit-officials, the Four Luminants, the Divine Messengers—each one in attendance—along with the Jade Lads who transmit words and the Jade Maidens who attend the oratory, two of each, arrayed to left and right.

**Evening Entry Incantation:**
*"Four Superior Merit Officers,
Dragon and Tiger Messengers,
the Unadorned Maidens who attend the oratory—
when petitions are made at night, may all be illuminated.
The Lads of the Upper Mystery, the Maidens as ministers,
all enter the Yellow Chamber within,
conveying entreaties to open the gates above."*

As before, one visualizes the Four Superior Merit Officers and the Unadorned Maidens, along with one Lad and one Maiden.

Ascending the Heavenly Gate, one enters the inner altar and offers incense to the Ten Directions, beginning with the East. In each direction, one holds the petition tablet, states one’s title and name, and bows in person. At night, one begins with the North; at noon, with the South.

**Morning Contemplation**
At dawn, when the nocturnal *qi* has just withdrawn and the light of yang has yet to shine, the virtue of Wood flourishes, and the Azure *qi* arises spontaneously, corresponding to the Mystic *qi* above. The principle states: *"At dawn, when performing the Dao, contemplate the Azure Cloud-*qi* descending from above, then guide the liver-*qi* upward from the crown, merging and filling the altar space. Four-headed Azure Dragons stand before, four-headed Lions behind, dwelling within the Azure *qi*, guarding front and rear."* This aligns with the contemplative meaning in the scriptures.

The Azure Dragons and Lions, with eight heads in total, flank the high seat, stationed in the directions of *si*, *wei*, *chou*, and *hai*.

**Comprehensive Contemplation for the Three-Day Observance**

Next, visualize the Immortal Youth holding incense standing to the left in the east, and the Jade Maiden holding incense standing to the right in the west. The celestial immortals’ attendant officers and cavalry, clad in flying garments, are stationed at the eastern side of the Heavenly Gate. The terrestrial immortals’ attendant officers and cavalry, clad in military attire, are stationed at the Earthly Portal. The flying immortals’ attendant officers and cavalry, clad in feathered robes, are stationed at the western side of the Heavenly Gate. The solar officials and their troops, clad in red, are stationed at the Solar Gate. The lunar officials and their troops, clad in pale yellow, are stationed at the Lunar Gate. The stellar officials and their troops, clad in robes of varying colors corresponding to their directions, are stationed in the four quarters. The Five Emperors of the four cardinal and four seasonal directions, with their troops clad in robes of the five colors corresponding to the five directions, are each stationed in their respective positions, while the central position is occupied by the direction of the August Establishment. The aforementioned troops and cavalry each number nine hundred million myriad riders. The overseers of the fast, the officials of the Three Realms, and their subordinates are arrayed to the left and right, front and rear, encircling and covering the altar space and the site of the August Establishment, along with all figures within and without.

Next, close your eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera. The lungs have seven lobes, white in color, located below the throat. The heart resembles an unopened lotus, broader above and narrower below, of a purple-red hue, situated below the lungs. The liver has five lobes, of a purple-green color, located below the heart. The spleen is a murky yellow, like the color of gold dust, covering the upper part of the granary. The kidneys are two, of a purple-black color, positioned beside the spine at the waist. The Five Peaks and Five Mountains each reside in their respective domains—visualize them from afar.

Next, visualize the Southern Fire Star in the center of the forehead, the Earth Star to the north before the heart, the Water Star to the east between the knees, the Wood Star to the west of the left elbow, and the Metal Star at the right elbow. The Five Stars shine brilliantly in the five directions. Visualize the Five Emperors of the five directions each residing in their respective positions, with the central position occupied by the direction of the August Establishment. Each wears a crown and robes of their directional color, guarding the body within, illuminating and covering the entire form, which itself becomes golden in hue.

Guide the five *qi* from behind the lungs, flanking the kidneys, and gather them to emerge from the nose like clouds ascending to the crown, then draw in the *qi* of the four viscera. Next, raise them upward to envelop the entire body, filling the inner and outer altar space. A circular radiance emanates from the nape, like the light of the sun and moon, illuminating the ten directions and the body within, clearly revealing all within and without. As the body becomes light and buoyant, it is no longer a vessel of blood and flesh but transforms entirely into golden hue.

The aforementioned celestial, terrestrial, and flying immortals are the divine soldiers and cavalry of the summoned perfected beings. The Five Emperors are the Five Emperors of the five directions, governing the upright *qi* of the five directions and overseeing the seasonal sequences of the four times. They command the troops and cavalry, assisting and protecting the fast altar—this is their office. Thus, the scriptural officials, the Two Mysteries, the Three Origins, and the Four Beginnings are all deities of the seasonal nodes, corresponding internally and externally to this.

The visualized five viscera, Five Peaks, and Five Emperors are not external but internal, corresponding to the five viscera within the body—illustrated in the diagrams of the alchemical scriptures. The aforementioned troops of the Five Peaks refer to the deities of the mountains and waterways, dispatching soldiers to guard the altar grounds—these are external and not internal. All practices are thus a resonance of internal and external.

Here, the Five Emperors refer to the *qi* of the five viscera within the body. When the *qi* is numinous, it generates spirits, as in the *Dong Jing* (Cavern Scripture), where the Five Emperors appear in visualization—this is the case. Now, as the *Dong Jing* pertains to the Heavenly Treasure, while this method pertains to the Numinous Treasure, they are not conflated. The five viscera are detailed in the *Huangting Neijing* (Yellow Court Inner景)—this should be studied carefully.

When ascending the altar to perform the fast, one may begin with simpler methods. The principle states: After ascending the altar, first visualize the Three Supreme Ones in the Heavenly Treasure Terrace of the Jade Capital Mountain in the Mystic Capital. To the left are the thirty-six divisions of the sacred scriptures; to the right is the Great Master of the Mystic Law. They appear solemn, as if present in person, with the Ten Perfected and Five Emperors, along with a host of immortals, assisting and protecting in the manner of a court assembly. Next, visualize the Three Supreme Ones descending upon clouds, as when expounding the scriptures in the manner of a millet-grain pearl. Visualize the boundless and innumerable hosts of the perfected great spirits of the ten directions arriving suspended in the void, with dragons and tigers to the left and right, overseeing the fast and its affairs. The true numina of the Three Realms, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, encircle and attend the Three Supreme Ones. Myriad spirits stand guard, forming the assembly of the Mystic and Numinous Immortals. Proceeding in order, the three-day observance follows this pattern, though the *qi* visualized differs.

**Visualization for the Noon Observance**
At noon, when the sun is at its zenith and the yang *qi* is at its peak, the virtue of Earth flourishes across the four seasons, and the Radiance of *Li* arises in the south, corresponding above to the receptive *qi* of the Primordial. One must not exceed the central *qi* of the noon hour—descend from the altar after the fourth quarter of the hour between *si* (9–11 AM) and *wu* (11 AM–1 PM).

The principle states: At noon, when performing the Dao, contemplate the golden *qi* of the crimson clouds descending from above. Guide the red *qi* from the heart to emerge from the tongue like clouds, merging and covering the Mystic Altar. Above, it reaches the Muddy Pellet, where light and darkness intertwine. Four-headed Vermilion Birds stand within, and four-headed Phoenixes stand without. The myriad pipes of the celestial orchestra resound, dwelling within the crimson *qi*. The Vermilion Birds and Phoenixes, with eight heads in total, flank the high seat, stationed in the directions of *yin*, *chen*, *xu*, and *shen*.

Next, visualize the celestial, terrestrial, and flying immortals; the solar, lunar, and stellar officials; the troops of the Five Emperors; the Immortal Youth and Jade Maiden—all as in the morning visualization.

**Visualization for the Evening Observance**
For the evening observance, ascend the altar before sunset, while the *qi* is not yet fully yin. The white *qi* flourishes, corresponding above to the Initial *qi*, aligning with the visualization. Now, the Initial *qi* within the body pertains to the lower cinnabar field, and the lungs are the mother of water. The lung *qi* is abundant at dusk, as water is about to arise, thus the white *qi* of the lungs corresponds and merges above.

The principle states: At twilight, when performing the Dao, contemplate the white clouds and ethereal mists descending from above. Guide the white *qi* from the lungs to emerge from the nose like clouds, merging and filling the Mystic Altar. Four-headed White Tigers stand within, and four-headed Qilin stand without, dwelling within the white *qi* and guarding the four directions. The two beasts, with eight heads in total, are stationed in the directions of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*.

Next, visualize the immortal youths and jade maidens, along with the various officers and troops of the celestial host, following the same method as the morning audience visualization.

Ascend to the altar and preside over the incense burner.
The principle states: Entering the center of the altar is descending beneath the Golden Gate.

First advance the left foot, taking two steps upon the radiant Star Pearl *Gang*, arriving before the main incense burner. Release the Jade Clarity mudra.

*Gang* Steps
Recite the *Gang* Step Incantation:
*"Jade Clarity, Red Simplicity, the Great Brahma divides its flow.
The Primal Net unfurls, the Star Pearls encircle all.
Hasten! As the Primordial August Thearch commands."*

With the left hand form the *zi* character, draw straight through the center, then extend to *wu*. Slightly open both eyes, as the sun and moon part just enough.

Recite the Incense Offering Incantation:
*"Jade splendor scatters its light, the Nine *Qi* congeals as mist.
Fragrant clouds densely woven, ascending directly to the Nine Heavens.
The Incense-Bearing Golden Youth and the Message-Transmitting Jade Maiden,
Convey above to the Emperor’s presence, granting this servant longevity.
To become a divine immortal for all generations—
Whatever is petitioned, whatever is desired, may all be fulfilled as spoken."*

Visualize the Jade Maiden and Golden Youth, along with the Dragon and Tiger, beside the incense burner.

Recite the Three Pinches of Incense Incantation:
*"The first pinch of incense ascends to the Jade Clarity realm,
The second pinch of incense ascends to the Highest Clarity realm,
The third pinch of incense ascends to the Great Clarity realm.
Numinous light and Brahma *qi* descend and infuse this servant’s body.
Flying fragrance reaches the imperial court, uniting with the Dao in the Emperor’s presence.
Hasten! As the Primordial August Thearch commands."*

With the left hand form the Three Palaces mudra, and burn one scroll of Jade Script True Writ within the main incense burner.

Recite the Prayer Incantation:
*"Primal Ancestral *Qi*, uniting with the numinous script,
No writ remains untransmitted, no writ remains unillumined.
The Crimson Writ on Jade Tablets, Dragon Seal trailing its radiance—
This servant now burns and transforms it, ascending to pay homage in the Jade Chamber.
Hasten! As the Primordial August Thearch commands."*

With both hands form the Jade Clarity mudra, and circulate the Seven Treasures Golden Tower, above and below, within and without, gleaming like crystal. Within it, the August Sovereign of the Void sits enthroned in the Jade Chamber.

Draw forth with your own *qi* to connect with the Ancestral *Qi*, exhaling and dispersing it throughout the Mystic Altar. The sacred and the mundane merge into one realm, like crystal or lapis lazuli, golden light bursting forth to fill the altar.

Burn the Summoning Talisman of Descending Perfection in the main incense burner and recite the incantation:
*"The Talisman-Mandate of the Primordial Beginning summons the ten thousand spirits.
Numinous light universally illumines, the Three Realms become luminous.
The Jade Talisman flies down, uniting with the imperial court.
Grant this servant leave to present his petition, ascending to pay homage in the Jade Clarity.
Clouds and mist ascend in ceaseless offering, moment by moment without pause.
Directly ascending to the Jade Gate, merging with the Dao and becoming true.
Hasten! As the Primordial August Thearch commands."*

*"Highest Clarity, Numinous Treasure, Jade Void summons the spirits.
Divine light wondrously transforms, a hundred million arrive as one.
Hasten! As the Primordial August Thearch commands."*

Form the Ten Heavens mudra and trace outward, then circle back from the center to inscribe the *wu* character above the *qing* character, emerging from the incense burner. Visualize the talisman’s smoke transforming into a pattern of rosy clouds, interwoven and translucent, penetrating the Three Heavens above and below, manifesting as a Seven Treasures Golden Tower Jade Palace, suspended and reflected before your eyes.

Again form the Three Palaces mudra, and visualize the generation and transformation of the ten thousand spirits and the hundred million chariots, all arriving to pay homage to the August Sovereign. The August Sovereign emanates a single *qi* of golden light, like the sun’s brilliance descending directly before the main incense burner, forming a golden path of the Yellow Way.

If you wish to pay homage, from here guide your spirit to ascend and present your petition. Kneel before the incense burner, offer incense, and silently pay homage to the August Thearch.

Return to your original position, kneel three times, and with the incense burner in hand, offer incense three times.

Recite the Secret Incantation:
*"The Dao is studied through the heart, the heart transmits through incense.
Holding the jade incense burner, the heart dwells before the Emperor.
The true numen gazes downward, the immortal sieve approaches the hall.
Grant this servant leave to report, ascending directly to the Nine Heavens."*

All secret incantations are recited silently.

Guide your body to embody the Primordial Beginning, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and with the tongue stir the Flower Pool, swallowing the saliva again.

Emit a single *qi* from the Cinnabar Palace, surging upward through the root of the tongue, penetrating the Twelve-Storied Tower, ascending to the Mud Pill, and piercing through to the crown of the head.

Guide the Perfected of the Cinnabar Palace to ride this *qi* upward through the Tower, reaching the Mud Pill, and pay homage to the August Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Treasures.

Regard your body as a realm of golden light, with a hundred strands of radiance bursting forth from every pore, like the nine-colored light of the *Milo* net.

Next, upon the golden path of the Yellow Way, pay homage to the August Sovereign and silently present your petition. Do not stir the Flower Pool, nor make any sound.

Upon completing the petition, gaze afar at the compassionate countenance of the Primordial Beginning, joyful and reverent. Golden light and Brahma *qi* descend and infuse your body.

Only then stir the Flower Pool, swallow the saliva to receive the true *qi* in the Cinnabar Palace, hold the breath to conceal the spirit, and then open your eyes to behold the Mystic Altar. Rise and perform three bows to conclude the ritual.

Each pays homage to their master according to the prescribed visualization.

First, visualize the direction where the Scripture Master resides, and in the heart perform three bows. Pray:
*"May my master attain the immortal Dao, ascending to the Highest Numen.
For my sake, deliver all beings, that all may become true in the Dao, and my body ascend and be liberated."*

Next, visualize the direction where the Register Master resides, and in the heart perform three bows. Pray:
*"May my master attain flight as an immortal, ascending to the Highest Perfected.
For my sake, open the deliverance of the seven generations of ancestors and parents, that they may be reborn early in the Heavenly Palace. May I attain the true Dao and ascend into the formless."*

Next, visualize the direction where the Initiation Master resides, and in the heart perform three bows. Pray:
*"May my master attain deliverance, ascending to the Highest Immortal.
For my sake, open the deliverance from the Five Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, that my name may enter the immortal register and I forever become a Perfected."*

Next, visualize the Three Masters of the Upper Heavens—namely, the Three Perfected—descending from the Heavenly Gate with the blue, yellow, and white *qi*, arriving at the altar.

Recite the Five Directions Incantation:
Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the five viscera, the five stars, and the five emperors, all guarding within the body.

Next, visualize the blue, yellow, and white *qi* pervading the Mystic Altar, with the Four Numinous Beings as escorts and the ten thousand spirits arrayed in formation. Inwardly regard the golden light as a canopy, the entire body becoming golden in hue.

First, emanate from the lungs to the crown of the head, generating a circular halo that illuminates the body in all ten directions, clearly revealing all within and without.

(For detailed procedures, refer to the section on altar construction.)

Sound the ritual drum.
Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times in three sets of eight, summoning the twenty-four spirits of the three divisions and eight luminaries within the body.

Disseminate the divine perfected, externally dispelling demonic influences.

Visualize the spirit and *qi* as pure and solemn, penetrating the Jade Clarity. Guide the blue, yellow, and white *qi* within the body through the five viscera, ascending to the Mud Pill, where they merge with the Primordial Three *Qi* of the Heavenly Gate. Together, they coalesce into a lapis lazuli palace, wherein the August Saints reside at the center, with the attendant perfected arrayed in formation.

Refer to the preceding details.

**Initiating the Brazier and Manifesting the Spirits**
Burn the talisman for disseminating the divine perfected and the talismans for manifesting the spirits. Visualize the body enveloped within the Three *Qi* amidst clouds, both within and without shrouded in mist.

Press the central mark on the middle finger.
Invoke the Primordial Three *Qi* of the Upper Three Heavens—Mystic, Primordial, and Origin—to descend into the adept’s body.
From *chou* and *yin* to *shen* below.
At *sanwu*, *mao*, and *chen* on the left and right; at *si* and *wu* on the left and right, holding incense; at *wei* and *shen*, attendants transmit the words.
On the days governed by *you*, *xu*, the Five Emperors, and *hai*, when the cyclical signs reach *wu*, thirty-six spirits emerge in turn.

Visualize the mounted officials in red robes and black headbands, along with the lads of merit, incense officers, and others descending from the Heavenly Gate.
The courier and mounted scribes within the body emerge from the brain, joining the attendant spirits in formation.
Extend the mudras to the Earth Deity and the True Spirit, pressing *xu* to return to the central mark before the throne.
Raise the mudras to visualize the mounted officials receiving the decree, bearing incense as they depart.

**Secret Incantation**
Within, there is luminosity; without, there is direction.
Both within and without are radiant, leaving no residual image.
Abide in stillness and await its manifestation.

**First Audience: Manifesting the Officials**
The adept and the assembled officials each perform three bows and kneel, striking the teeth twenty-four times. The scribes and soldiers proceed with their duties.

First, visualize a vermilion gate, one foot and eight inches wide, at the forehead—this is the Gate of the Brain.
The scribes and soldiers enter and exit through this gate.
First, the Four Spirit Generals and the Three Marshals emerge, escorting front and back, left and right.
The sun, moon, and five planets hover above the head; the Northern Dipper covers the body. They emerge from the liver’s blue *qi*, filling the Mystic Altar with light bright as the sun and moon.

Form the Dipper-summoning mudra and the Return-to-the-Supreme mudra. Solemnly declare the departure of the spirits from the adept’s body to the Heavenly Ding and the Valiant Warriors. Visualize each spirit within the body emerging and arraying to the left and right.
Next, trace from the central mark to the root, circling the roots of the two fingers, then flick upward at *si* to signal.

Then, prostrate and recite the incantation:
*"The body is empty and quiescent—what departs, what enters?
It is made the standard; breath and exhalation reach it."*

Sound the ritual drum three times and swallow saliva three times.

**Manifesting the Officials on the First Morning of the Retreat**
This is done only on the first morning; it is unnecessary thereafter.
If submitting memorials, follow the same procedure for manifesting the officials.
For nine memorials, manifest the officials again on the ninth audience.
For thanksgiving offerings, manifest them after initiating the brazier in the offering rites.
For memorials during altar construction, manifest them during the altar rites.
Submitting memorials has its own ritual methods, unrelated to this.

**Proclaiming the Rites and Conducting the Ceremony**
The adept stands upright, holding the ritual tablet, visualizing the body as a perfected one, and proceeds according to the ritual position and prescribed rites.

**Proclaiming the Words**
As a general rule, the rites span seven days and nights.
The words proclaimed thrice daily are the words of address, not the blue memorials.
For yang offerings, they are for the living: repenting sins and averting calamities.
For yin offerings, they are for the deceased: cleansing transgressions and faults.
For the state, they beseech relief from drought, excessive rain, eclipses, locusts, or unforeseen dangers, or to confess the faults of high officials.

The adept offers incense thrice, kneels in silence, and presents the memorial. The officiants kneel before the brazier, while three, five, or nine repenters step forward, kneel before the throne, and proclaim the words of address.
When proclaiming the imperial titles of the Supreme Emperor, all perform obeisance.

**Offering Incense Thrice**
In all morning rites, the offering begins with prayers for the sovereign’s universal blessings, the ascent of the nine generations of ancestors, and then the living—this is the intent.

The incense attendants and officiants follow the rites, offering incense thrice, each performing three bows.

**Repenting to the Ten Directions**
The form for repenting to the directions follows the rites: for the deceased, one fears their accumulated sins in life; for yang offerings, one considers the living’s past transgressions.
If these offenses are recorded in the registers of the Ten Directions and Three Realms, or inscribed in the ledgers of Heavenly Offices and Earthly Prisons, no matter how earnestly one beseeches grace, how can the records of evil be erased or the Mystic Blessings descend?
Thus, one repents to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, confessing and seeking absolution for each direction, even to the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks, entreating the removal of transgressions and the erasure of sinful records.

The principle states: the assembly, led by the High Priest, offers incense to each direction, performs three bows, kneels in silence, and repents for the deceased, cleansing their faults.
The words of repentance follow the rites. The officiants hold the brazier and kneel for each direction as prescribed.

**Commanding the Demons**
Guang Cheng said: The *Ten Steps of Void* derive from the *Scripture of the Jade Capital of Mystic Metropolis on the Sacred Mountain of Lingbao*.
They are the hymns sung by the ten assemblies of sages as they circumambulate the Sacred Mountain of the Kingly Capital, praising the cultivation of the Dao.
The scripture states: When establishing a retreat and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Emperor-Kings arrive in jade chariots drawn by eight luminous clouds, with perfected ones and jade maidens holding flowered banners leading the way. Phoenixes sing behind, and the celestial music of the Azure Heavens resounds; white cranes and lions roar and chant. They burn incense, scatter flowers, and float through the air to witness the rites, observe the practices, and listen to the Dharma sounds.
Thus, regardless of whether the documents inviting their descent have arrived, one must perform the *Steps of Void*.
As they circumambulate, the great divine perfected of the heavens descend from near and far, floating through the air.
Therefore, one must first command the demons to purify the realm.

The method lies in the High Priest’s secret circulation of divine light. Reverently proclaiming the Dao’s decree, by the command of the Supreme, the High Priest summons the Northern Emperor to dispatch the Demon Kings, inspect and restrain fierce spirits, and sever the roots of evil.
Once the Jade Text descends, the Three Heavens radiate clarity, the true transformation flows, and the immortal Dao flourishes.
The demonic path vanishes, the *yin* *qi* scatters and falls, the Six Heavens’ movement ceases, and within the Six Directions, the Dao’s *qi* fills all, reaching the Nine Empyreans and pervading the myriad realms. Countless sages float through the air to witness the rites and listen to the Dharma sounds.
The ability to evoke such responses lies solely in the High Priest’s internal refinement: embryonic breathing, true stillness, and the luminous clarity of the Mud Pill. Thus, a single visualization radiates divine light.
Further empowered by the Supreme’s incantations and commands, the Demon Kings receive their orders, obey the Emperor’s decree, sweep the realm clean, and the assembled sages float through the air to listen to the *Steps of Void*.

Thus, this practice is not confined to a single altar, nor limited to the assembled sages who have entered the ritual space. This is why it is employed after the *Rites of the Four Directions* and *Repentance*, yet precedes the *Scattering Flowers* and *Steps of Void*.

It is said that commanding the demon kings was already recorded in ancient liturgical methods. Lu Jianji, Du Guangcheng, and others did not compile these, but all followed the ancient canons of the *Three Morning Command of Demons and Complete Steps of Void Sutra*, circling ten times in procession—there is no doubt of this. Jiang’s *Ready-Made Ritual* states that Zhao Daosheng’s *Yellow Register Ritual* commands demons only at the noon audience, following the *Zhenghe Golden Register*. Moreover, the *Jinlu Daoist Ritual* composed by imperial decree during the Xuanhe era commands demons and performs the *Steps of Void* across all three audiences, with the *Dispersing the Altar Rite* conducted only after the offering. This was compiled by Yang Jie. At that time, the Daoist teachings flourished, and the verification of ritual canons was meticulous, so the liturgical texts largely adhered to ancient methods.

Jiang further cites Zhang Qingdu, who said: Before the Heavenly Worthy expounded the scriptures, the demon kings of the myriad heavens roamed the great void, wielding power and spreading poison. After the Heavenly Worthy preached, the demon kings submitted to transformation. Once the multitude of demons relied upon the sagely transformation, they became the perfected and wondrously accomplished true persons of the Heavenly Worthies, driving their chariots ahead to sweep away dust and clear the path. Thus, when the assembled sages are about to proceed, they first command the demon kings to drive their chariots forward.

The scriptures say: "The demon kings respectfully receive their duties, and thus are able to attend the heavens." Therefore, in the *Steps of Void* within the ritual arena, one first visualizes and commands the demons. Now, examining this passage: Zhang Qingdu’s claim that after the scriptures were expounded, the demon kings submitted to transformation, and the divine lords received their commands to universally sweep away inauspiciousness—whenever the Heavenly Emperor is about to journey, the demon kings are commanded to lead the way—this is one interpretation. Yet to directly apply this meaning and cite it as evidence that commanding demons precedes the *Steps of Void* is not entirely reasonable.

If the Heavenly Emperor is about to journey, the demons should indeed be commanded first. However, when offering incense to the Ten Directions, one already visualizes the Three Worthies residing in the jeweled terrace. Moreover, during the *Invocation of the Sages* and *Declaration of Ritual Intent*, the *Rites of the Four Directions* and *Repentance* are all directed toward the Emperor, with the deities visualized within the altar for some time. The demon kings should have already cleared the dust and performed their duties at the moment the Emperor descends to the altar—why would they be commanded only when the *Steps of Void* is about to begin? Such reasoning is not sound.

Furthermore, Zhao Daosheng and others treat the command of demons as purely an internal visualization, as if the Most High does not emerge from the *Mud Pill*. Moreover, their notion that the multitude of perfected beings reside within the body, and that commanding demons operates within the corporeal frame, is akin to silently attending the Heavenly Emperor and presenting the ritual’s intent within the *Upper Field*—all of which misapprehend the scriptural intent, misidentify the fundamental source, and err gravely.

The nine palaces of the *Mud Pill* and the hundred spirits within the body—how could these be absent? From the Three Treasures of the *Heavenly*, *Numinous*, and *Divine* teachings, all include cultivation within the body, some focusing solely on the internal, others harmonizing internal and external. Seated in meditation within the chamber, refining form and spirit—this is the internal. Ascending the altar to pay homage, conducting seasonal rituals and offerings—this is the external, where reverence reaches the Heavenly Emperor. Submitting memorials and petitions, flying the spirit to meet the Emperor—this is the spirit leaving the body to ascend the high heavens. Paying homage to the perfected, repenting, performing the *Steps of the Way*, burning incense, ordering the five *qi* to purify the altar, uniting the three primal essences to visualize the Great Dao, commanding the demon kings to purify the Six Directions, invoking the Jade Capital to chant the *Steps of Void*—all are methods of resonance between internal and external, of mutual stimulation.

Yet how can commanding demons be entirely an internal practice? Some say: Yang is born at *zi*, yin at *wu*, and the cycle ends at *zi*. The *si* hour marks the extreme of the six yang, while the *wu* hour marks the birth of the first yin. As yin encroaches upon yang, the demon kings test the ritual arena, disturbing the Dharma body. When the sun resides in the *Li* palace—*Li* being empty at its center, a pure yang *qi*—yin intrudes at the juncture of yin and yang, hence commanding demons at the noon audience. This, too, lacks any basis and stems from rigid adherence to the internal, fabricating such explanations.

If the Three Pure Ones and Jade Emperor do not emerge from one’s body, and the thousand perfected and myriad spirits all reside within, why bother ascending the altar to establish the ritual, inscribing petitions, and arranging offerings? One could simply have the ritual officer address the words to one’s own awareness, and the *Mud Pill* would understand. If the liturgical texts and ritual petitions could all be dispensed with, this would utterly contradict the sagely masters’ intent in transmitting canons to save the world.

The twenty-seven ranks of rituals and forty-two grades of offerings each have their distinctions and hierarchies—how could one focus solely on internal cultivation and neglect the scriptures, registers, and concurrent practices? As for matching metal and wood, pairing *kan* and *li*, mercury congealing and lead solidifying, dragons descending and tigers subduing—these are internal practices, not external. Yet they are not the same as the grand liturgical canons for responding to the world, conducting rituals, and establishing offerings.

Scholars, in their internal cultivation and external refinement, must understand the origins and currents. In upholding the teachings and performing rituals, they should clarify the fundamental principles to avoid mistaking east for west and falling into confusion. To claim that commanding demons is entirely an internal practice, with demon kings and deities all residing within one’s body, is a principle difficult to reconcile.

If the demon kings do not depart from the body, and the heavens reside only atop the head, then the demon kings receive their duties in the *Cinnabar Field*, pay homage to the Heavenly Emperor in the *Mud Pill*, and through such practices achieve success—yet the verses enumerating their deeds would merely describe a corpse-guarding ghost, not an immortal. Such practices of attending the *Mud Pill* are not the ultimate goal, even for beginners in visualization.

Ascending the mysterious palace to serve the Three Realms—this is the true immortal. Achieving success within the body and ascending lightly into the heavens—this is the meaning of the *Steps of Void Sutra*. As the fourth chapter of the *Steps of Void* says:

*"Looking up and down, I visualize the Most High,
The radiant splendor flourishes in the Cinnabar Field.
Glancing left, I raise Yu Yi,
Gazing right, I grasp Jie Lin."*

The Six Perfections crown the pure practices,
Virtue and power renew daily with the sun.
This speaks of constantly abiding in the Most High while practicing the supreme method above the sun and moon—thus virtue and power renew daily. This inner achievement manifests outwardly.

It further states:
*"Heaven-endowed with transcendent talent,
Delighting in reciting the* Xiaoyi *scriptures."*
This means that without transcendent talent, one cannot grasp the essence of *xiaoyi* (the subtle and formless). Only by mastering its verses can one thoroughly penetrate its profound principles.

It also says:
*"In the midst of emptiness, the Great Harmony’s qi,
Exhaling and inhaling the flowing rosy mist.
Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages,
In boundless vastness, the Three Conveniences are explored.
The Mud Pill radiates with luminous splendor,
Thus becoming a Golden Flower Immortal."*
This speaks of awakening to the deep mechanism of the scriptures and canons, refining the practice of exhalation and inhalation, and applying the secret method of embryonic breathing—thereby causing the *Mud Pill* to shine brilliantly and unite with the Dao. Such inner refinement leads to immortality, dependent on oneself, not external forces.

Once success is achieved in this way, even the demon kings in heaven will respectfully receive their duties—how could it be merely about protection and promotion? Thus, one ascends to pay homage to the various heavens. The reason the demon kings respectfully receive their duties is precisely what enables one to ascend and pay homage to the heavens. All this is attained through repeated purification and accumulated merit. Therefore, it concludes:
*"All begins with purification and fasting,
Accumulated merit binds past affinities.
Soaring through the great void,
Ascending with the highest immortals."*
Soaring flight is indeed a matter of light ascent, not merely an internal bodily affair.

Now, in the ritual of commanding demons at the purification altar, one first visualizes the sun and moon entering the nostrils, then the *Cavern Chamber* radiating with brilliance. This is because the luminous splendor of one’s own *Mud Pill* has not yet become self-luminous, so one borrows visualization to proceed. Since one’s body has not yet become a true immortal, how could one suddenly command demon kings to receive their duties? Thus, one borrows the authority of the Most High to command them. This matter aligns in principle with the *Steps of Void* chapter. As the tenth chapter says:
*"Scattering flowers to present my vows,
Grasping the tally to summon the demon kings."*
This expresses the same meaning. The scriptures speak of achieving immortality naturally, while altar rituals borrow this authority.

If the path of embryonic breathing is accomplished and the luminous splendor of the *Mud Pill* is already bright, then one need not visualize the sun and moon to radiate light in all directions, nor recite secret incantations to command the demon kings. Those who attain this level will not personally tread the purification altar or seek fame among the common world. These regulations are the methods of purification rituals, hence they are explained in detail.

In general, when paying homage to the true and visiting the sages, the key lies in focused contemplation. If the mind is not rectified, one falls into delusion, and external demons arise. Only by maintaining a rectified mind can one break through delusion—like hot water melting snow, or a torch illuminating the dark—thus enabling the spirit to pay homage.

**Method of Commanding Demons and the Primordial Sovereign**

Green, black, yellow, red, white,
Verdant, crimson, azure, and mysterious light.
From one to nine, ingest according to the Primordial Sovereign.
Unite with the true qi of the day, and the seven orifices will bloom with radiant splendor.
After nine years of completed merit, one enters to serve in the Nine Mornings’ Chamber.

**Another Method**

One, three, three, one—dividing the light into a hundred parts,
The Nine Palaces and the Palace of Departure blaze with the sun’s brilliance.
Without seeking the Imperial One from the root lineage,
The Six Demons will laugh at your scattered thoughts.

First, the green light arises, born above in the Heavenly Origin.
Then the white light, born in the midst of the Human Mystery.
Then the yellow light, born below in Earth.
These are the three qi of Heaven, Earth, and Human, distributed across the Three Fields.
This is the One generating the Three—thus, the "one-three."

The mysterious qi of the lower *Cinnabar Field* ascends to the middle *Cinnabar Field*, merging with the white qi as one.
The white qi of the middle *Cinnabar Field* ascends to the upper *Cinnabar Field*, merging with the green qi as one.
The Primordial Three Qi—mysterious, original, and initial—gather in the *Mud Pill*, as large as a millet grain, neither form nor appearance. They transform to generate the nine qi—this is the "three-one" mysterious division of light. The generation of the nine qi is the blazing of the Palace of Departure in the Nine Palaces.

Advanced practitioners must know the root of the nine qi’s generation. If one does not seek the Imperial Mandate from the ancestral lineage, one does not understand the birth of the nine qi—how then can one manifest the radiant nine-colored mysterious image? No wonder the Six Demons laugh—let one reflect on this.

**The Nine Heavens**
Azure, red, green, verdant, yellow, white, purple, azure, and mysterious light.
The Nine-Colored Circular Images:
1. Crimson Cavern
2. White Chapter
3. Azure Luminance
4. Verdant Brilliance
5. Yellow Simplicity
6. Azure Chaos
7. Purple Fusion
8. Azure Bloom
9. Black Evolution

From inner to outer, from one to nine.

**Diagram of the Five Qi Transforming into Nine Qi**
Various methods only record the five qi corresponding to the five directions and five emperors, yet the nine-colored circular images reside in the head. Without clearly distinguishing the methods of their entry, transformation, and exit, one cannot communicate with the true and summon the numinous. Here, the diagram provides guidance by category.

- Yi and Geng combine to form verdant metal
- Ding and Ren combine to form azure wood
- Jia and Ji combine to form yellow earth
- Wu and Gui combine to form purple fire
- Bing and Xin combine to form red water

**Principle:**
When commanding demons, the High Priest circumambulates leftward to the Ghost Gate, standing facing west. The Chief Cantor stands at the Heavenly Gate, facing east, and recites. Each visualizes the nine-colored circular images, their light illuminating the ten directions. Swallowing saliva, they command the demons and recite the secret incantation. The adept knocks their teeth three times, swallows saliva three times, and visualizes the sun on the left and the moon on the right, slightly raised and nine feet from the face. The sun emits a purple-red light with nine rays, the moon a white-yellow light with ten rays, directly shining upon the face. From the nostrils, they enter the *Cavern Chamber* and *Golden Flower Palace*. Between the eyebrows, they enter three *fen* to form the Twin *Cinnabar Fields*, then penetrate another three *fen* into the bone to form the *Terrace and Watchtower*. Precisely seven *fen* deep, on the left is the Azure Door, on the right the Purple Door. Three *cun* inward from between the eyebrows is the *Cinnabar Field Palace*, also called the *Mud Pill Palace*. Four *cun* inward is the *Flowing Pearl Palace*, five *cun* inward is the *Jade Emperor Palace*—also called the *Golden Flower Palace*, located south of the *Cavern Chamber*. Directly upward one *cun* is the *Heavenly Court Palace* and *Cavern Yang Chamber*. Upward another *cun* is the *Ultimate Truth Palace* and *Cinnabar Field Palace*. Upward another *cun* is the *Mysterious Cinnabar Palace* and *Flowing Pearl Palace*. Upward another *cun* is the *Supreme Sovereign Palace*.

This is recorded in the *Scripture of the Great Cavern of Perfection*. Master Wucheng cites the *Nine Palaces Formula*, stating: "Five *cun* inward forms the *Jade Emperor Palace*." It further states: "The *Golden Flower Palace* and the Nine Palaces each span one *cun* square."

The method of visualization involves circulating the nine *qi* upward, pressing into the *Jade Pillow*, then emerging from the great vertebra at the nape. Radiant brilliance manifests as a nine-colored circular image. The *qi* is visualized as residing in the two cavities before and behind the brain, its light suffusing the nine *qi*, resembling the circular halo behind the Primordial Lord of the Dao. It revolves in cycles, illuminating the ten directions and enveloping the entire body. It follows my rotation, moving through my form—this is the true Primordial Lord of the Dao.

Next, the heart visualizes the Perfected ascending with the *qi*, treading the stars of the *Mysterious Pearl* and the Dipper, paying homage to the Lord of the Dao. Then, one knocks the teeth thrice, swallows saliva thrice, recites the esoteric incantation, burns the talisman to command demons, chants the *Jade Capital*, treads the void in the *Ding* and *Gang* steps, and circumambulates. One envisions the Five Thearchs leading celestial soldiers to drive away demons, while the Demon Kings submit to their charge.

**Incantation to Command Demons:**
*"Within the Yellow Center, I summon the* qi*, severing and extinguishing the lineage of evil. Subduing fierce demons, cutting off the traces of deviance. The Most High issues a decree, entrusting it to my body. Hasten to summon the Northern Thearch to pay homage at the Mysterious Palace. Spirits of mountains, forests, and earth—all forms submit alike. Obey the mighty command and proclaim it to the Demon Kings. The five* qi *billow and surge, clashing with the talismanic decree. The secret jade script ascends to the clouds in triumph. The Three Heavens revolve in brightness, the Six Heavens reach their end—ah, the kidneys!"*

After burning the talisman to command the Demon Kings, first visualize the Primordial Lord descending into the void of the *Mystery*. Next, recite the esoteric incantation, envisioning the Primordial Lord descending in golden light, entering the adept’s body from the crown, and settling in the *Descending Palace* to form the elixir of *Golden Liquid*. Its light fills the eight directions, illuminating within and without. The myriad spirits pay reverence, and the Three Realms become boundless. Then, one traces the central script.

**Threefold Reverence to the Scripture:**
At the outset of the ritual forms, the teachings are established through the scripture. After completing the circumambulation of the void, one should pay reverence to the scripture. The reason demons universally respect and protect, and one receives great blessings life after life, is due to upholding the precepts, contemplating the Dao, and dispelling desires—thus, one extols its merit and pays reverence. It further states: "As the scriptural Dao flourishes, families and nations prosper. With unceasing cultivation, one enters the Great Vehicle. Even the seven ancestors ascend, and the body itself transcends." Therefore, one bows again. Those who cherish the scripture and savor the Dao ultimately become companions of the Dao. Through refining form and substance, one surpasses the Three Realms’ difficulties and delivers oneself from the sufferings of hell. All success stems from the scripture—hence, the threefold reverence concludes this act.

The principle states: "The adept visualizes the Heart Thearch, bows upward, and performs the threefold reverence."

**Great Thanksgiving:**
Now, the officiant repents sins before the ten directions and beseeches blessings from the upper realms. Having extolled merit and revered the scripture, one then pays homage to the Three Treasures. Facing the celestial gate, one performs a universal repentance and thanksgiving—hence, the *Great Thanksgiving*. The rationale for reciting the *Return to the Crucible* is thereby clarified.

The principle states: "The adept assumes the proper position, kneels, and recites the declaration in full, then rises after three bows."

**Returning to the Crucible and Entering the Spirit:**
Burn the *Talisman of Radiant Light and Returning the Chariot*.

The principle states: "The adept holds the incense burner, invokes the *Incense Officials* and *Envoys* to attend the various spirit officials. From the *Zi* cycle to the *Hai*, the jade mudras are set in order. After proclaiming the commands before the throne, visualize the spirit entering, inhaling the *qi*, and swallowing it into the *Cinnabar Field*."

**Esoteric Incantation:**
*"Previously summoned from my body’s fivefold Perfected Officials, Attendants, Generals, and Clerks—enter through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries. Those on the left return to the left, those on the right to the right. Now recalled, they return as before. Visualize the Celestial Perfected and the Three Realms’ officials ascending to the empyrean. Only the Five Thearchs’ scribes and soldiers remain to guard the altar. Gather the spirit, enter through the Gate of the Brain, and return it to the Three Palaces, merging into oneness."*

**Descending the Heavenly Gate and Exiting the Earthly Portal:**
**Morning Exit Incantation (same as noon audience):**
*"Exiting yin, entering yang—ten thousand spirits open and unfold. Affairs concluded, the Yellow Chamber is sealed. The Jade Maidens attend in tranquility, illuminating the divine palace."*

**Evening Exit Incantation:**
*"Above the Mysterious, the Great Yin—eight windows open in clarity. As before, the Maiden communicates the numinous. Following the heart’s transformation, the Yellow Court is pacified. Affairs concluded, all return to their stations—ten thousand spirits rest in peace."*

Visualize the officials, scribes, and Jade Maidens transmitting the sincerity of the fast, each dispersing in turn, then exit the altar.

**Paying Homage to the Mysterious Master’s Curtain:**
The adept offers incense, kneels, and prostrates thrice to give thanks, then rises after three bows. The fast inspector notes transgressions according to the ritual form.

**Returning to the Chamber of Tranquility:**
The adept returns to the chamber, offers incense, and bows to the Perfected Master. The assembled officials resume their positions.

Here concludes *Volume Fifty-Seven of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Purity*.
*Volume Fifty-Eight of the Great Rites of the Numinous Treasure of Supreme Purity* begins.

**The Lamp of Nine Tiers and Nine Layers**
*Transmitted by the Perfected Lord Ning Quanzhen, the Illuminating Savior of Profound Mystery, to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity and Successor of the Numinous Treasure Lineage, for the Compilation of the Essential Principles of Fasting Rituals*

**The Lamp of Nine Tiers and Nine Layers**
According to the *Simplified Writs of the Upper Prime*, the method of kindling lamps was revealed when the Perfected Lord of Dharma Liberation entreated the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The Celestial Worthy replied: "The statutes of deliverance and the gates of salvation are fully expounded in the scriptures of the Three Caverns. Now I shall proclaim their essential words for you. To relieve suffering and rescue the departed, kindling lamps is supreme.

The Five Directions and Eight Extremities, the dark prisons of the earthly hells—these lie in the regions of utmost yin, the realms of eternal night. The souls of the dead are imprisoned, barred from the Three Luminaries, languishing in darkness amid myriad torments. One should fashion a lamp-tree according to the proper method, with a Heaven-and-Earth Wheel at its base: the round to symbolize Heaven, the square to symbolize Earth. Above and below, within and without, all shall be illuminated. The gloomy prisons of the underworld will radiate with brilliance, their threefold light penetrating the nine layers, their eightfold arrangement centering the August One. From the first day of death to the forty-ninth, the lamp-light shall remain unbroken. When suffering souls behold this radiance, they shall attain liberation. These are the golden words proclaimed, and by establishing the lamp-ritual and repentance according to the statutes, one may rescue even those in the Avīci Hell."

**Method for Erecting the Lamp**
Use catalpa wood to craft a lamp-tree, dividing it into nine tiers, with a lamp placed at each tier’s door. Below, form a three-tiered altar of purified earth, round above and square below, modeling Heaven and Earth. On the upper tier, place the lamp-tree, suspending nine-streamered banners inscribed with the *Yin Talismans of the Nine Heavens*; write the *Proclamation Texts* with both hands. On the middle tier, arrange nine lamps in a circle, erecting the tablets of the Nine Qi. On the lower tier, place nine lamps for the Nine Layers, erecting the tablets of the Earthly Sovereign Lords of the Nine Layers. The three tiers together hold twenty-seven lamps. Beyond these, establish eight gates, kindling eight lamps and erecting the Eight Trigrams. Above, they illumine the Nine Heavens, harmonizing the upright qi and stabilizing the stellar revolutions; in the center, they illumine the Nine Regions, sweeping away the calamities of the Nine Lands; below, they illumine the Nine Dark Realms, piercing the dense yin of the Nine Layers, channeling light through the Nine Paths to shatter darkness and illuminate the gloom. The eight outer gates mirror the Eight Extremities, encircling the Ten Directions. In total, thirty-five lamps embody the thirty-five divisions of the primordial qi. The Eight Luminaries of the Supreme Mystery unite with the qi, entering the profoundest profundity. By this art, suffering souls are delivered—no greater merit exists.

**Kindling the Lamps**
The essential principles state: When kindling lamps, begin at the northeast, the *Ghost Gate* (Gen). Thus, one borrows the yang qi of the Nine Heavens to descend upon the Earthly Gate. During the repentance ritual, the adept approaches the Celestial Emperor’s presence, entreating the descent of the qi from the Nine Empyreans. After three bows, the adept requests the *Light Talisman* to ignite the torch, dipping it into the Celestial Emperor’s lamp to light it. Proceeding in order, the adept uses the talisman-torch to kindle the lamps of the nine tiers, beginning in the northeast. According to the ritual statutes, the *Precious Proclamations of the Nine Heavens* are recited. For each chapter proclaimed, the *Yang Talismans of the Nine Heavens* are announced, and after all nine proclamations, they are burned together. For each tier, the *Nine Qi Banners* are burned. For each layer repented, the *Nine Layer Talismans* are burned, and the *True Talismans of the Three Yangs Opening Light* are announced, burned alongside the *Cinnabar Radiance and Jade Calendar*. For each tier, the adept entreats the descent of its qi to illumine the Nine Abysses, breaking open the dense yin. After kindling the lamps each day, the light from the northeast tier is divided to ignite the lamps of the Nine Hells, generating the Three Qi—thus, the Dao of one generating two, and two generating three. The yang light descends, piercing the yin obscurity, so that all hells behold its radiance.

**Illuminating the Nine Dark Realms**
The Nine Dark Realms correspond to the central palace of the Eight Trigrams and the astrological divisions of the Nine Provinces, each governed by its local deities. In Heaven, they are the Nine Heavens; on Earth, the Nine Palaces; in transformation, the Nine Dark Prisons. Their names are nine, yet all arise from a single qi, a single thought. For every evil thought of the deceased, a prison manifests, and the prison follows accordingly. Thus, the Most High, in boundless compassion, established this deliverance ritual to rescue suffering souls—it must be performed according to the proper form.

1. **Dark Obscurity (Youming)**: Arising from the nine qi of the *Zhen* trigram in the east. All growth and movement await the stirring of wind and thunder; thus, it is called the *Wind-and-Thunder Hell*.
2. **Dark Yin (Youyin)**: Arising from the three qi of the *Li* trigram in the south. Fire reaches its zenith at noon, where yang culminates and yin arises; thus, it is called the *Fire-Shrouded Hell*.
3. **Dark Night (Youye)**: Arising from the seven qi of the *Dui* trigram in the west. The light of a single day is exhausted in the west, the metal phase of killing and rigidity; thus, it is called the *Vajra Hell*.
4. **Dark Feng (Youfeng)**: Arising from the five qi of the *Kan* trigram in the north. The qi of water reaches its peak at midnight, where yin culminates and yang arises; thus, it is called the *Dark and Frigid Hell*.
5. **Dark Capital (Youdu)**: Arising from the *fan* qi of the *Gen* trigram in the northeast. The qi reaches its phase at *yin* and *gen*, where warmth and softness emerge, yet wood finds no growth; thus, it is called the *Scalding Cauldron Hell*.
6. **Dark Governance (Youzhi)**: Arising from the *fan* qi of the *Xun* trigram in the southeast. Fire reaches its zenith at *si*, the realm of blazing intensity; thus, it is called the *Bronze Pillar Hell*.
7. **Dark Pass (Youguan)**: Arising from the *fan* qi of the *Kun* trigram in the southwest. The metal phase governs the southwest, the season of withering and killing. Those who enter this realm often harbor murderous intent; thus, it is called the *Slaughter and Dissection Hell*.
8. **Dark Court (Youfu)**: Arising from the *fan* qi of the *Qian* trigram in the northwest. It embodies the revolving wheel of Heaven; thus, it is called the *Fire Chariot Hell*.
9. **Dark Joy (Youhuan)**: Arising from the central qi. Governed by the Earthly Sovereign of the Central Palace, it oversees the central administration; thus, it is called the *Universal Torment Hell*.

**Method for Establishing the Prisons**
According to the *True Statutes of the Great One*, the Nine Prisons are erected at the Earthly Gate. Nine altars are constructed from refined earth, each two inches square, arranged in a single formation spanning six feet to model the yin of Earth and the symbolism of the two sixes.

Each prison is constructed with four corners and three bends. Three torches are lit within each prison and placed upon the prison tablet. Nine-streamered banners are hung, inscribed with the names of the Heavenly Worthies of the respective directions; on their reverse, the talismanic banners of the Ten Directional Heavenly Worthies are written, while the top bears the Nine Prisons Talisman. On both sides, the talismanic incantations and petitions for breaking the prisons are inscribed. At the base, the talisman for a specific prison is written, followed by a petition to that prison, and marked with nine bamboo stalks.

Additionally, nine yellow banners are prepared, inscribed with the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Radiance Talisman*. After the banners for breaking and burning the prisons are used, these nine banners are hung in their place. A large central banner is then erected, inscribed with the name of the *Azure Mystery*, left to flutter in the wind, whereby all sins are extinguished.

Constructing the prisons in this manner symbolizes the Nine Dark Realms of Earth, where the Underworld administers punishment, and the judicial offices of Fengdu are arrayed. The southeastern *si* direction is their proper location. The specific design of the prisons is recorded elsewhere.

**On the Establishment of Prisons**
The establishment of the Nine Dark Prisons is fundamentally intended for the universal deliverance of the sunken and lost. When constructing minor rituals, if one does not invoke blessings upon the sovereign and the realm above, nor deliver the nine generations of ancestors and the six paths of rebirth below—narrowing the intent to merely redeem one or two departed souls—then the Celestial Thearch would not act for the sake of a single individual by specially issuing talismanic decrees to open all nine prisons. Such a notion is impossible. The prisons may not all be broken, and the lonely souls may not all be delivered. If one’s intention lacks even the slightest merit of benefiting others, it contradicts the original purpose of these statutes.

If the ritual is conducted solely for the sake of specific ancestors, it is sufficient to light lamps and recite praises, or to establish the *Nine Destruction Spirit Lamps*. The rite for breaking the prisons need not be performed, lest it become an act of presumption and disrespect. Yet when filial descendants seek to redeem their ancestors, their sincerity alone is enough to cleanse past transgressions. How could one assume that their ancestors have fallen into hell and thus perform this rite? Such reasoning is unsound.

If one wishes to proceed, it is appropriate to prepare offerings of grain and food, broadly delivering the souls trapped in the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, the stagnant spirits and sunken souls, without regard to number, and to act according to one’s capacity to fulfill good intentions. Only then may the breaking of the prisons be considered. For countless sinful souls remain lost in delusion; a single misguided thought may consign them to eternal imprisonment. Without petitioning the Supreme Mystery, employing talismans to break the prisons, and lighting lamps, how could they be liberated? Thus, the rite must be conducted with careful consideration of its gravity, lest it violate the statutes and methods.

First, the *Banner of Divine Transference* should be erected to the east of the altar.

**On Breaking the Prisons**
To break the prisons at the moment of invocation during a grand fast is profoundly mistaken. Moreover, while the eight prisons are broken, the central prison remains unbroken—why? Furthermore, if one does not know in which prison the sinful soul resides, and supposing they are in the central prison—which is not broken—how could they be released? If the deceased is without sin and has not entered a prison, where then should the ritual of summoning and deliverance be directed?

Alas, those who are ignorant of these matters merely deceive themselves. Across the world, countless rituals for deliverance are performed daily. If every rite involved breaking all the prisons, and the sinful were indeed imprisoned, how could they be so easily freed? Just as in the world of the living, officials do not detain the innocent, how much less would the Underworld do so?

The reason lies in the moment of death: the soul lingers in the dense earth, the po is bound in the Nine Yin, and the three karmic actions and six sensory roots accumulate sin, congealing as yin filth that cannot be cleansed. Thus, the light of the yang is invoked to dispel the shadows of yin. Lighting three lamps in one prison summons the Three Qi of the Mysterious Origin. The nine prisons and nine qi transform into twenty-seven qi, together forming thirty-six yang lights that illuminate the thirty-six earthly realms, dissolving the karmic burdens of the deceased’s three actions and six roots.

The central prison is not broken because it corresponds to the spleen, and the spleen spirit is the Gate of Life. Breaking it would risk scattering the spirit and preventing rebirth.

**On the Nine Prisons Within the Body**
The Master said: The Nine Prisons lie beneath layers of dense yin—what method can be employed to break them? Yet within the adept’s own body reside nine prisons that must first be broken before daring to breach the prisons of the deep yin. If one cannot break their own, how can they hope to break the prisons of hell?

All within a person arises from the heart, which serves as the sovereign. Whether one acts with boldness or follows the virtuous path, the heart governs all. When the heart is at peace, the spirit is settled in its abode; when the heart is enraged, the spirit is disturbed. If the heart and body are at ease, yet anger arises even once, the cultivation of harmony is lost.

The heart is the palace of the lotus, where the sovereign resides in honor. The lungs are the palace of the floral canopy, where the ministers dwell. The liver is the palace of the generals, the kidneys the palace of strength, the spleen the palace of the granary, and the Central Yellow guards the abode.

Every thought arises from the heart: when the heart is at peace, the realm of the lotus blossom appears; when evil prevails, the prisons of fire pits and blazing shadows manifest. When qi is stirred by anger, the prisons of wind, thunder, and universal torment appear. When the lungs are unsettled, the Diamond Hell manifests. When qi is overbearing, the Dark Cold Hell appears. When the three yang are in the hands, the Copper Pillar Hell manifests. When the three yin are in the feet, the Cauldron of Boiling Water Hell appears. When the heart is restless and unable to find peace in any matter, the Fire Chariot Hell encircles all. When qi, blood, and spirit all lack benevolence, the Slaughter and Dissection Hell manifests. When the body is unbalanced, the prisons of golden hammers and corporal punishment appear in accordance with the qi.

The Central Universal Torment Hell corresponds to the Yellow Emperor of the adept’s Central Palace, the organ of the life mandate. The small intestine connects to the heart, encircling the entire body. The large intestine corresponds to the nine layers of dense yin below, the nether mountains and bitter caves. The three palaces and five viscera are the caves of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings. How can one who cannot even break the prisons and caves of their own body, daily mired in filth, hope to break the dark prisons of the Underworld? Such efforts are no more than child’s play.

One must first burn the knife mountains within one’s own heart before breaking the Knife Mountain Hell. The essential teaching states: When breaking the prisons at night, from dawn to dusk of that day, one must regulate their qi and settle their spirit, allowing the nine qi of the Supreme Mystery’s palace and the nine palaces to ascend and descend in proper order.

When the Heart Monarch is tranquil, the court ministers guard their posts, true qi is nurtured within, and flows to fill the entire body. Directing this single qi into the nine-bending prison of the intestines, all filth dissolves, and auspicious realms manifest at the thought’s bidding—only then can one break the prisons of the Underworld. At dusk, before the Supreme Emperor, one petitions for the Staff of Authority and talismanic decrees, and proceeds to break the prisons according to the method. The Golden Light Decree descends into the prison, naturally halting the trials of the imprisoned, and the yin spirits are released to ascend and transform.

To break the prisons and open the dark realms, one must borrow the Heavenly Worthy’s Primordial Measure of Salvation, the Numinous Treasure Staff of Authority, to command the Five Emperors and their guardian officers. Following the direction of the hexagram’s qi, one performs the ritual with hand seals, first preparing the proper dignities. Approaching the Three Treasures, one kneels and petitions for the staff. Without leaving the position, one burns the talisman to summon the officers and proceeds according to the ritual code.

The essential teaching states: The adept approaches the Three Treasures, offers incense, bows three times, and kneels to petition the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor, presenting the details of the fast and requesting the descent of the Five Emperors’ Staff of Authority, the talismanic decree for breaking prisons, and the opening of the dark prisons. The adept visualizes the Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor seated before the Primordial August Sovereign, with jade lads and jade maidens in attendance on either side, each holding banners of auspicious mushrooms, orchids, and flowering pennants, arrayed to left and right. At the center is a circular radiance, shining brilliantly in all directions, illuminating the adept’s body. The Supreme Emperor grants the petition, exhaling wisdom-light from his mouth, eyes, and nose, infusing the staff. The Staff of Authority transforms into a mushroom-shaped staff, dragon-headed and tiger-tailed, its body luminous, mouth holding a flowering pennant, with auspicious winds and felicitous clouds coiling above, its light resplendent and primordial. The jade maidens and jade lads present a jade casket, its golden light flashing, opening the Purple Yang Jade Lid to bestow the talismanic decree for breaking prisons, along with the Pure Bell and Dharma Water, entrusting them to the adept for opening and breaking the Earth Prisons.

**Prayer for the Staff of Authority**
The Five Elders’ Staff of Authority, the Heavenly Worthy’s Merciful Talisman.
The Golden Watchtower’s Mysterious Register, penetrating the dark and breaking the paths.
Great is this compassion, dissolving the suffering of sins.
The Numinous Treasure’s Primordial Measure, rescuing the deluded and lost.
With one stroke of the kalpa talisman, all sentient beings are emptied.

Next, the talismanic decree, Staff of Authority, Dharma Water, and bell are passed through the incense smoke and entrusted to the attendants on either side. The adept bows three times in gratitude, gathering spirit and drawing the Azure Mystery’s wise and luminous visage, slowly ascending and descending above the adept’s Supreme Mystery Palace, merging into one form, with the attendant lads and lords guarding left and right. Swallowing saliva, the adept rises, wields the staff, steps upon clouds, and moves as the spirit wills. Arriving at the prison’s location, the adept paces a full circle, and the lamps of the four directions—all manifestations of wisdom’s golden light—illuminate the space, transforming it into a realm of radiant clarity. The ritual of repentance is performed according to the code.

**Breaking the Nine Prisons**
Proclaim the Decree for Breaking Earth Prisons. Recite the Dispatching Incantation:
Universally announced to the Three Realms, reaching the carefree Upper Clarity.
With the Jade Clarity Hand Seal, the Eastern Qi, and the same for the spirit money and horses, burn them before the prison.

Burn the Talisman for Shattering Chains. Display the Talisman for Opening Gates.
Strike the talisman ashes with the hand and blow them into the nine prisons. Then, beginning from the northeast, break each direction in turn. First, offer incense, knock the teeth nine times, and pace the stellar steps: nine steps to the east, three to the south, seven to the west, five to the north, five steps to each of the four corners, and twelve steps to the center. With the left hand, press the Central Writ, visualizing the Primordial Beginning’s Azure, Yellow, and White Qi enveloping the body, transforming the self into the Heavenly Worthy of the respective direction. Next, break the prison with the talismanic staff, gather the direction’s qi, blow and flick it, and sprinkle with water. Burn the direction’s talisman within its prison.

**Incantation**
The Primordial Qi of Jade Clarity, halting the trials in the dark hall.
The Three Stars radiate awe, the Primordial Beginning opens the light.
Whether guilty or innocent, all are pardoned in this direction.
The Treasure Light shines brilliantly, universally ascending to Heaven.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning Supreme Emperor decrees.

Press the Jade Clarity Hand Seal, blow and flick the direction’s qi into the prison, visualizing the golden light penetrating through, illuminating the interior and exterior. Then, holding the staff, trace the talisman in the air, directing the light downward, and inscribe the character for “decree” with the staff’s tip, visualizing the prison’s breaking.

**Talisman for Breaking Prisons and Liberating the Living**
The Dao Qi of Jade Clarity, universally breaking the heavy springs.
The imprisoned spirits, released from suffering, ascend to Heaven.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Primordial Beginning, Great Unity, Azure Mystery Supreme Emperor’s statutes and decrees command.

Press the left Jade Clarity Hand Seal, flick, and with the staff’s tip, trace downward to inscribe the character for “decree” to break the prison. Then, silently recite the subsequent secret incantation for breaking prisons:
*[Secret incantation omitted in original]*

The heavens and earth exchange radiance, the sun and moon merge their light.
Above, it pierces the Ox and Dipper; below, it penetrates the darkest underworld.
On the left, the Six Jia spirits lend support; on the right, the Six Ding spirits provide defense.
The divine staff breaks the prison, and all beings ascend in liberation.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Celestial Emperor’s decree commands.

**Secret Incantation for Breaking Prisons**
*Oṃ kūjī zhīdì ālèsà tánbōqiéluófàyé pózhā hūṃ hā.*

Press the left Jade Seal, grasp the staff in the right hand, and visualize the Jade Maidens and Golden Lads—twelve on each side—holding precious banners, upon which is inscribed the Jade Emperor’s *Pardon-Sin Heavenly Worthy*. In each direction, envision iron cities towering ten thousand *zhang*, their nets crisscrossing, black *qi* dense and murky, foul *qi* billowing forth, copper serpents and iron hounds spewing flames and smoke, while ghostly wardens and night watchmen guard the locked gates. With a single stroke of the staff, break through: cloud-script talismans and jeweled light surge forth, auspicious winds stir and sweep, transforming your form into one bathed in a hundred treasures’ radiance. Above, it connects with the Primordial Three *Qi* of the Mysterious Origin, piercing straight through the city. Behold the iron walls crumble, the blades of the knife mountains shatter, swords turn into forests of flowering trees, the flames of fire mountains extinguish, the waves of icy pools still, fire-swallowers and coal-eaters transform into sweet dew, cauldrons cease boiling, and golden hammers and iron rods become lotus blossoms. The imprisoned sinners, following the direction of the banners, glimpse the light of the sun; their shackles fall away of their own accord, their sins and sufferings are absolved, and all awaken to their original true nature. Grudges dissolve in reconciliation. The underworld officials and ghostly clerks all clench their fists in salute, bowing and praising the deed.

**Sprinkling Water and Reciting the Incantation**
The talisman-command of the Primordial Beginning reaches the carefree realms of Supreme Clarity. Visualize the Merciful Worthy sprinkling the Dharma rain, drenching the dark prisons, all transforming into crimson and azure lotus blossoms—a realm of cool purity. Inside and out, rare fragrances waft, lamp lights scatter like sparks, resembling the radiance of stars and constellations, flowing rosy clouds shimmering in flight. The prison wardens, bathed in the light of wisdom, transform into immortals, joining the imprisoned souls in forever escaping the yin governance, beholding the light of dawn. Wherever the prison lamps stand, all becomes a wondrous realm.

When breaking the universal prisons, press the *Lingbao* Seal, draw the *qi* of the Middle Ancestor, and silently recite the **Incantation for Transformation**:
*My master, the Heavenly Worthy of Salvation from Suffering, ever skillfully transforms the ten directions’ realms.
With this mighty power, great compassion arises, delivering all beings from boundless suffering.
In the ninefold night’s deepest dark underworld, universally expand the light to illuminate all.
The Ox-Head prison wardens all ascend as immortals; the myriad suffering souls are all released.
The three paths and five torments of the imprisoned, their myriad sufferings cease, ascending to the Purple Clarity.
Those seen, heard, with consciousness or without—all, moved by this, attain the supreme Dao.*

Next, burn the *Azure Mystery Salvation from Suffering Breaking Fengdu* talisman, along with the *Returning Light* talisman, within the central prison. Recite the **Heart Incantation** thrice:
*Chì hōng zhà lī, manifest light!*

Close your eyes and visualize the lamp light transforming into a hundred treasures’ auspicious radiance, ascending to the Nine Heavens and descending to the Nine Earths. Envision the previous talisman manifesting as the Immeasurable Heavenly Worthy, pervading the prisons, rescuing and delivering all imprisoned souls, all absolved and released.

Burn one *True Form of Fengdu* talisman, blow the ashes into the nine prisons, and invoke the *Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from Suffering of the Ten Directions* thrice. Then recite the **Incantations for Purifying Fengdu and Opening the Dao of Karma**, sprinkle water, and circumambulate, applying the previous visualizations.

**Returning the Staff**
When the breaking of the prison is complete, proceed before the Three Treasures to return the staff. Its authority and prohibitions are most solemn—none may transgress. Violations will be examined and punished. Offer reverence, give thanks, and return it before the Celestial Emperor.

**Principle States:**
The practitioner returns the staff before the Celestial Emperor, offering incense, bowing, kneeling, and memorializing in gratitude. The staff, along with the water vessel, is returned to its original place, the great ritual of summoning and employing the staff now concluded as one.

At an auspicious moment, visualize the Azure Mystery Celestial Emperor above your crown, gradually ascending, then dissolving into the empty void. The practitioner gazes upward at the Merciful Worthy, bows in heart, and retreats.

**Returning the Wheel of Radiant Lamps**

According to the *Scripture of the Twenty-Four Precepts of the Perfected*:
All who commit the twenty-four kinds of transgressions in life shall, after death, undergo twenty-four retributions, transforming into twenty-four hells. These include the Three Wicked Paths, the Five Sufferings, the Eight Difficulties, the Eight Hells—altogether twenty-four hells—corresponding to the twenty-four spirits of the three divisions and eight luminous regions within the human body. During life, one is bound by attachments and affections, harboring perverse thoughts amid defiled circumstances, knotting and congealing impurities, unable to attain liberation. Thus, the *Ritual Codes of the Covenant with the Perfected* prescribes the method of "Returning Radiance and Descending Light," borrowing the illumination of yang-light to dispel the Five Encumbrances, open the karmic path of life and death, and shatter the dark tribunal of sins. This ritual belongs to the esoteric canon of the Cavernous Mystery; without sublime practice, even petitioning the Jade Clarity for revelation would scarcely allow its secrets to be glimpsed in the lower world. Yet it can reverse the radiance of the Three Luminaries, bending it to descend into the gates of the Nine Springs, causing water and fire to vanish, poison and suffering to dissolve, blades of metal to shatter, iron cities to melt, and ghostly officials to cease their torments. It eradicates the karmic adversities of ten thousand kalpas, liberates the imprisoned souls of countless aeons, and allows them to behold the Three Lights and swiftly ascend to the realms of humans and heavens. This method is employed for the universal deliverance of orphaned souls; its merits may be dedicated to the deceased, though it need not be performed ordinarily.

**Method for Establishing the Hell Ritual**
To establish this hell, first erect the *Returning Radiance Spirit Banner*, then fashion a wheel from catalpa wood like a cart axle, constructing three tiers with a central pillar. Place twelve lamps on the upper tier, sixteen on the middle, and twenty-one on the lower, totaling forty-nine lamps. At the center, establish the Five Encumbrances and Five Gates, each bearing a plaque inscribed with the name of a hell. Additionally, craft forty-nine small pennants in yellow and white, alternating their colors. Inscribe the honorific titles of the Celestial Worthies upon the banners according to the prescribed form, and write the talisman for breaking Fengdu at the top. Follow the *Ritual of the Returning Radiance Lamps*, positioning the *Returning Radiance Banner* to the southeast of the lamp altar. The diagrams of the twenty-four hells are recorded separately.

**Lamp of Repentance**
**Principle States:**
First, request the staff, talismanic water vessel, and command tablet, proceeding to the lamp altar to perform the ritual as prescribed.

**Proclamation of the Talisman for Delivering Suffering Souls**
*Secret Incantation:*
Universally announce to the Three Realms, ascending to the carefree Upper Clarity.
*Jade Mudra*, east qi, then south qi blown, together with paper horses and spirit money, burned upon the lamp altar.
The practitioner emits the nine-colored divine radiance from the *Great Vertebra* behind the brain, forming a circular image above the neck like the wheels of the sun and moon, resplendent and illuminating the ten directions, piercing through all hells.

Proceed with the ritual of repentance lamps: for each hell, offer incense, burn talismans, strike with the staff, and sprinkle water.

**Burning the Talisman for the Three Paths**
*Prayer and Dispatch Incantation:*
The Jade Clarity Celestial Emperor decrees absolution.
The Upper Clarity Celestial Emperor decrees absolution.

*Piercing Mudra*, visualize the transformation.

After burning the talisman for each hell, hold the Jade Clarity Mudra in the left hand and grasp the staff in the right, striking once within the hell toward each direction while reciting the *Great Brahmā Hidden Language* once. Sprinkle water and recite the *Jade Clarity Flowing Radiance Dispelling Suffering Secret Incantation*:
Souls of the Three Paths and Five Sufferings,
All beings of the Four Births and Six Destinies.
Suffering multitudes of sentient beings,
Universally born in the Land of Peace and Bliss.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the command of the Primordial Beginning Celestial Emperor.*

Sprinkle water upon the lamps, burn the small pennants, and proceed in the same manner for each direction. Thus, the sinful souls of all hells, riding this yang-light, shall be liberated in that very moment. All sufferings, the Five Encumbrances, afflictions, evil obstructions, and the roots of karmic toil shall be entirely severed. Beholding the Three Lights, they swiftly ascend to the realms of humans and heavens.

**Proclamation of the Precious Laud for Opening the Dark Night of Fengdu**
*Prayer and Dispatch Incantation for Igniting the Fengdu Lamp*
*Secret Incantation for Ritual Practice:*
Hidden script of the numinous peak, the Mysterious Capital unfolds deliverance.
Majestic the earth of the Northern Capital,
Dark and lightless, without dawn or dusk.
The cold pool’s waves run deep, the halberd trees brim with sorrow.
Towering iron forks upon shoulders, fierce the gates of scorching flames.
Countless yin souls, day and night enduring myriad sufferings.
The Celestial Worthy descends the numinous chapter, illuminating all yin palaces.
Cease the trials in the prison courts, all proceed to the Vermilion Mound Palace.
By command of the Jade Clarity True Emperor, all sin records are burned.
Receiving the Supreme Dao, decrees are obeyed without hindrance.

**Expulsion of Malevolent Ghost-Officials**
The demonic ghost-officials bow in reverence before the True King Father.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the command of the Primordial Celestial Worthy.*

Recite the incantation thrice in silence, once toward each direction. Then, offer incense to each quarter, burn the talismans, and employ wine and water. Burn the Five Directions talismans, the talismans of the Great Hells, and those of the upper and lower realms. Use the directional invocations and incantations to enact the Way of Proclamation.

By the primordial decree of Jade Clarity, the icy springs are shattered.
The earth-prisons grow radiant, Mount Deng collapses in ruin.
Sinful souls are unbound, the evil paths dissolve into peace.
By the celestial statutes of the Heavenly King, bow in reverence to send and receive.
*Swiftly, swiftly, in accordance with the command of the Primordial Celestial Worthy.*

**Essential Method:**
The practitioner gathers spirit in silent contemplation, reciting the *Incantation for Shattering and Dispersing Fengdu’s Obstacles* three times. Strike the teeth five times, swallow saliva once, and circulate the primordial true *qi* upward to the Upper Chamber. Curl the tongue thrice, then gently exhale, forming a white mist that gradually expands, round as moonlight. Direct the gaze upward, briefly beholding the light of the sun. Draw in a breath of solar *qi*, merging it with the lunar orb below. As the sun revolves and the moon turns, let them slowly suffuse the practitioner’s body, bathing it in inner radiance.

Next, gently draw a breath through the nose, and golden light—hundreds of threads—will surge into the body, infusing every pore and organ with luminous clarity. The light pierces the abyssal halls of the underworld, dispersing the black *qi* of the waters like smoke. As the radiance of sun and moon wheels in fusion, it illumines all realms without bound, transforming every place—above and below, within and without—into a lotus chamber suffused with wondrous fragrance.

Then, transform the self into the precious form of the Great One, attended by jade maidens and divine lads on either side. Suspended in empty space, they spread clouds of compassion and incense of blessing, stirring and pervading all. The ghost-officials of the yin passes rejoice greatly. Strike the teeth thrice, swallow saliva three times, and summon the Dipper, envisioning starlight entering the body to proceed.

This is the method for shattering and dissolving Fengdu’s net, purging filth and defilement, so that the yin passes know no sorrow of thorns, and the earth-prisons become lotus realms.

**The Blood Pool Hell**
All beings born between heaven and earth are transformations of yin and yang. The male within *li* (fire) and the female within *kan* (water) possess leaky, impure bodies—who can escape the snares of desire? When a woman conceives and bears a child, if mother and child remain undivided in death, it is due to transgressions in past lives, now repaid in this existence.

The Blood Pool contains five hells. Those slain by royal law, in battle, or by abscesses and poisons fall into three of these hells; their sins may yet be pardoned, and their souls granted release. But the souls of those who died before or during childbirth each occupy their own hell, bound in endless retribution. Drenched in blood’s foul stench, their forms steep in the surging Blood Pool for kalpas uncounted, never glimpsing light.

Some women lose their children in miscarriage—mother perishes while child survives, child perishes while mother survives, or both die together. Others suffer from incomplete limbs, putrid blood, hemorrhage, leprosy, or bloody flux—all are imprisoned in the Blood Pool Hell. Without the great *Huanglu* fast, without pledging to heaven and earth, without distributing talismans and performing meritorious deeds, how can they be delivered?

Thus, the Heavenly Worthy, in boundless compassion, established many gates of salvation, transmitting them to the world below to broadly open the path of deliverance. One must bow in homage to the *Blood Pool Petition*, present the *Blood Pool Memorial*, shatter the Blood Pool Hell, and perform the *Blood Pool Refinement Talisman*. The official summons and the *Lingbao* refinement rites differ; the master must embody and enact them.

At the moment of shattering the hell, sit in silent meditation, inner thoughts stilled, outer distractions barred. Envision the Blood Pool Gorge Hell in the left kidney and the Fengdu Cold Pool Hell in the right. The left hell’s waves of blood surge with foul stench, imprisoning souls in suffering for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve.

Then, contemplate the Azure Mystery Celestial Worthy, holding a willow branch with dharma-water, seated upon the Wondrous Hall. The master draws in the golden *qi* of the Heavenly Gate, gently swallowing it into the cinnabar field. It passes through the Gate of the Tailbone, reaches the Life Gate, ascends along the spine, and pierces the Mud Pill Palace, opening the Eight Gates. At their center lies the Gate of Myriad Wonders, transforming into a nine-petaled lotus. The Heavenly Worthy sits majestically within.

Next, behold the True Person of the Cinnabar Origin, identical in form to the practitioner. They step the Nine Phoenixes Purification Step, patrolling the lower realms. From the Spleen Palace to the Golden Well of the Tailbone, they ascend the twenty-four joints of the spine, reaching the Upper Chamber. The tongue presses against the upper palate, forming a bridge to the Wondrous Hall, where they bow in homage to the Heavenly Worthy. Kneeling, they present the matter and beseech the issuance of a pardon.

The Heavenly Worthy assents, proclaiming the imperial decree and entrusting it to the Blood Pool Envoys, making it known to all. The True Person of the Cinnabar Origin merges with the Heavenly Worthy, seated upon the Wondrous Hall. They summon the innumerable hosts of the True Persons of Salvation and Suffering, each reciting the *Lingbao* decrees and the Primordial Talismanic Commands, concluding with the *Shangqing* mantra: *Oṃ Hūṃ Trāḥ Lī.*

From the Heavenly Worthy’s crown emanates golden light, pouring into the yin hells, where all behold the radiance of compassion and sacred light. The True Person holds a precious pearl, its golden light resplendent, piercing the cinnabar field and shattering the yin hells. The Heavenly Worthy sprinkles the Gorge Hell with willow-water, transforming it into a jeweled terrace. The dead are granted an exit, their release assured. *This is secret, most secret—it is the Way of inner and outer resonance.*

At the site of the hell’s construction, the master and fellow practitioners shake bells and chant verses, circumambulating thrice. They recite the hidden words and sprinkle the hell with pure water, like fine rain or dense mist descending. They invite the true *qi* to infuse the hell, burn the talismans of defilement, and recite the *Secret Incantation for Shattering the Five Directions’ Impure Hells*, using the staff’s tip to channel flowing light and rosy clouds downward, piercing and shattering the darkness.

They proclaim the memorial, chanting a verse to shatter each hell. They burn the *Azure Mystery Heavenly Worthy’s Salvation Talisman for Shattering Fengdu* and silently recite the *Lingbao* decree three times. This is done for all five hells.

When the rites are complete, the Daoist assembly gathers in a circle and recites thrice:

*"In the boundless Fengdu,
The cold courts brim with sorrow and suffering.
Virtue’s golden light—"*

They then recite the *Yuanshi Fu Ming Incantation* three times, transmuting the hell into radiant purity. The hell’s wardens clench their fists in reverence, the nether officials bow their heads, and the sinful souls emerge, liberated. The site of the constructed hell transforms into a lotus pond’s realm.

During the shattering of the hell, the officiant must visualize himself as the *Savior from Suffering Heavenly Worthy*, with the assembly as attendant immortals, all stationed upon the clouds above while the hell lies below. Solely through the *Wisdom Light Fu Ming*, the dense yin is pierced and shattered. The *Dharma Rain*, *Compassion Clouds*, and *Auspicious Winds* dissolve the filth and darkness, just as the yang governance releases and pardons imprisoned sinners.

Next, the officials of the *Ministry of Life Protection* are summoned to the altar to receive the grace of transformation.

**Bureau of Life Supervision**
When the summoned souls include those who perished in childbirth, they must first be led to the *Bureau of Life Supervision* to undergo the proper rites. The *Celestial Decree* is first invoked for divine sanction.

**Incantation for Summoning the Great Life-Supervising Deity**
*"In the highest heavens,
The Jade Clarity reigns supreme.
The Dao harmonizes with heaven and earth,
Mastering the governance of living souls.
Life-conveying divine officials,
Hasten to the Gate of Birth.
Hasten as the Yuanshi Supreme Emperor decrees!"*

The *Nine Palaces Mudra* is formed, directing the *qi* of the northeast. The visualization is held firm.

The *Already-Born and Not-Yet-Born Talisman* is burned, along with the *Life-Supervising Talismans*.

**Prayer:**
*"Reverently we invoke the Great Life-Supervising Deities of the Nine Heavens, the Holy Mother of the Womb, the Celestial Healers of Disease, and all attendant spirits. May those souls from the Blood Lake who perished before or during childbirth now enter the curtained chamber to complete their delivery and be reborn in the heavens or among humanity.
Hasten as the law decrees!"*

The *Jade Mudra* is formed, visualizing the deceased entering the chamber.

**Second Incantation:**
*"Reverently we invoke the Twin-Protecting Mother,
Swiftly bestow true *qi*
To save the ghostly souls and birth them into heaven."*

The *Middle Scripture* mudra is traced, and the *Primordial Qi of Lingbao* is blown onto the banner. The *Incantation for Supervising Immortals and Delivering Life* is recited seven times, followed by the *Middle Scripture* once. The *qi* of the southeast is drawn and blown forth.

Next, the incantation *"All who are already born or not yet born shall attain life and completion"* is recited thirty-two times. A single breath is drawn and blown forth, visualizing the deceased’s form enveloped in azure light, filling the chamber.

For those not yet born, the *Talisman for Easing Childbirth* is burned. The *Ziwu Dipper* mudra is formed with both hands to divide yin and yang, severing the bond. A mouthful of water is sprayed onto the banner, and the *qi* of the five viscera is roused, surging upward to the *Crimson Palace*. From the *Double Staircase*, the *Thunder Fire* of the kidneys and *Dantian* is struck together, producing a thunderclap that bursts forth, transforming into a new body. The mother and child are thus separated—this is the *Stimulating Shock* that refines the womb and enables birth.

**Incantation for Separating Form and Shedding the Womb**
*"The *qi* of the Five Phases circulates,
The *qi* of the Three Luminaries soars and floats.
Divine nectar descends to irrigate,
Jade liquid washes away the dark.
The hun-soul, rectified, ascends to heaven,
To roam the Jade Capital with the myriad spirits.
Hasten as the law decrees!"*

**Celestial Physicians’ Court**
Once the *Bureau of Life Supervision* has completed the delivery of the childbirth souls, the *Celestial Physicians* and their attendants must be summoned to heal and restore them fully.

Some souls may have died from illness while alive, carrying their afflictions into death, their ten aspects incomplete. Moreover, the three *hun*-souls of the deceased drift in the dim and obscure, no larger than three inches, formless and bodiless. How then could they don robes, attend the immortals, or receive offerings? Many fail to grasp this point, merely chanting songs to mislead the world.

When souls are summoned, the *Celestial Physicians* must be invoked to heal them. The souls are guided to the chamber, the *Celestial Decree* is invoked for divine sanction, and talismans and incantations are employed to perform the rites of the *Five Palaces* within, restoring their original forms. Once corporeal, their throats are next opened, followed by the officiant circulating the *Five Sprouts Jade Liquid* from his own body and applying the *Secret Methods of the Five Palaces*, blowing it forth to complete their humanity. Only when the throat is opened may they don robes and receive offerings.

**Talisman for Summoning the Celestial Physicians**
Next, the *Incantation for Summoning* is recited:
*"Great Saints, Great Saints of Earthly Medicine.
Golden Elixir and Immortal Remedies,
Universally save all beings.
Descend with true *qi*,
Hear the summons and swiftly arrive.
Instantly restore form!
Hasten as the law decrees!"*

First, the Three Luminaries of sun, moon, and stars are visualized, covering the *Celestial Physicians’ Court*. The *Celestial Physicians’ Talismans* are burned, and the rites are performed with water from the basin, moistened with wine. The *Jade Mudra* is formed, directing the true *qi*, visualizing five celestial officials in five-colored embroidered robes descending from the five directions, each bearing talismans and medicines to administer *qi* and heal the deceased.

Next, the true *qi* of the five directions is transformed, enveloping the *Celestial Physicians’ Court* in a sphere of true fire and a lunar wheel. The *Five Emperors’ Complete Form Talismans* are burned to perform the rites of the *Five Palaces*.

The *Five Palaces* are:
1. The *Palace of the Winding Stream*, the kidney palace, governing the essence of the *Heavenly One’s Water* position.
2. The *Palace of Yang Brightness*, the heart palace, belonging to the essence of the *Earthly Fire* position.
The *Heavenly Three* generates wood, which pertains to the liver palace, the *Palace of Generation*, symbolizing spring’s vivification of beings.
The *Earthly Four* generates metal, which pertains to the lung palace, the *Palace of Kunlun*, symbolizing autumn’s harvest.

Spring pertains to the liver and wood, governed by the *Azure Dragon*;
Autumn pertains to the lungs and metal, governed by the *White Tiger*;
Summer pertains to the heart and fire, governed by the *Vermilion Bird*;
Winter pertains to the kidneys and water, governed by the *Dark Warrior*.
With the *Four Symbols* complete, the myriad spirits all converge in the *Central Yellow Court*.

When performing the rites of the *Five Palaces*, the spleen spirit must be visualized in the central palace as the *Palace of the Yellow Court*, capable of generating and nurturing all things. When the Five Phases are complete, the myriad spirits flourish in majesty. Only then are the deceased’s form and body fully restored, allowing them to bathe, don robes, attend the immortals, listen to the Dharma, undergo refinement, and be reborn.

**Visualization of the Five Emperors’ Taboo Names**
*"Gongdu is accomplished. Center, align the horns to the true north. Xingsheng turns to Mao. Ke Hanming at Wu. Duli Qian at You. Dui Hun gathers the hun-souls, Gongdu gathers the hun-souls."*

The *Mao Mudra* is formed, silently reciting *"Hongxing"*, visualizing the *Azure Emperor* arriving from the east, riding the *Azure Dragon*. The officiant circulates the liver *qi* from his own eyes to merge with it, exhaling through the *xu* breath.

The *You Mudra* is formed, silently reciting *"Mozhen"*, visualizing the *White Emperor* arriving from the west, riding the *White Tiger*. The officiant circulates the lung *qi* from his own nose to merge with it, exhaling through the *si* breath.

The *Wu Mudra* is formed, silently reciting *"Mohei"*, visualizing the *Vermilion Emperor* arriving from the south, riding the *Vermilion Dragon*. The officiant circulates the heart *qi* from his own mouth to merge with it, exhaling through the *he* breath.

The *Zi Mudra* is formed, silently reciting *"Wala"*, visualizing the *Black Emperor* arriving from the north, riding the *Black Dragon*. The officiant circulates the kidney *qi* from his own ears to merge with it, exhaling through the *chui* breath.

The *Zhong Mudra* is formed, silently reciting *"Lingbao"*, visualizing the *Yellow Emperor* arriving from the central palace, riding the *Yellow Dragon*. The officiant circulates the spleen *qi* from his own lips to merge with it, exhaling through the *hu* breath.

The deceased’s soul is visualized encircling the front, while the Heavenly Physicians of the Six Offices restore the body to completeness. The Five Emperors of the Five Directions descend with the five-colored true *qi*, pouring it into the crown of the deceased’s head.

**Incantation for the Complete Form**
*"Mysterious primordial qi, nurturing the Three Origins.
The radiant embryo first stirs, the Two Effulgences revolve.
Yin and yang gather their excellence, congealing in the womb’s origin.
Form and appearance mirror the world’s illusions, accumulating karma without end.
The five palaces and six viscera block the Three Fields.
The hundred joints and nine orifices amass impurities into transgressions.
Form dissolves, qi scatters, the soul is bound to the Nine Springs.
Bound to illness, the soul seeks liberation—how can it escape?
The Heavenly Physicians and Divine Medicines rescue and relieve afflictions:
Severed heads are rejoined, severed sinews are rejoined.
Leprosy is flayed away, watery distension is eased.
Retained fetuses descend, gestation is renewed.
Contractures stretch and flex, the mute can speak.
Missing limbs are restored to wholeness.
The deaf hear, the blind see, the mad are restored.
The aged regain youth, enmities are reconciled.
Hunger is sated, deep-seated illnesses are dispelled.
Wind and consumption are eradicated, all are made whole.
The gate of the *po*-soul opens, the gate of the *hun*-soul is refined into immortality."*

The deceased’s soul is visualized with its form complete. The officiant draws the *qi* of the southwest and spreads it, imagining the deceased’s soul riding the true *qi*. The *Talisman of Ten Injuries* is burned for liberation.

**Ablution**
After the deceased’s body perishes, the soul lingers in the heavy yin, perhaps entering the Nine Dark Paths. Yin *qi* congeals, corpse impurities remain unremoved. Once summoned to the altar and the Heavenly Physicians’ work is complete, the next step is to bathe the soul with the essence of the sun and moon, the waters of the Celestial River and Eastern Well, and the light of the Five Stars, refining the *hun* and *po* to dispel yin obscurations.

The *Talisman of the Transformed Bath Chamber* is burned, along with the *Male Hall* and *Female Chamber* talismans. The officiant visualizes the bath chamber transforming into the luminous reflection of the moon’s radiance, the *qi* of blossoming splendor, vast and billowing. The *Zi Mudra* is formed with both hands, embodying the *qi* of yin and yang.

All ablution talismans are burned, the incantations recited, and the transformation of the moon’s yin-white eternal light is invoked, falling like rain. The area is then purified with water sprinkled three times. Two jade lads and jade maidens are visualized, holding fragrant towels and long silks, spreading the *qi* of precious light to guide the yin soul inside.

Another jade lad is visualized holding a jade vase filled with sweet spring water, its white body pouring like rain, spraying from above. The light of the Five Stars and the Dipper also shines from above, pouring into the precious vase. The deceased is bathed, washing away the turbid *qi* of delusion, refining the form until the body shines with radiance.

**Changing Garments**
The deceased, lingering in darkness, has garments woven from congealed yin *qi*. These are burned and transformed according to the ritual method.

All talismans for transforming garments are burned, and the transformation incantation is recited:
*"Om xin xin wu fa yi di ming du, transform and refine the tangible, gather it."*

Water is sprinkled, and the light of refining rosy clouds is visualized, interweaving and permeating the garments. Jade lads and maidens are imagined descending from the Heavenly Gate, bearing the garments. The *qi* of blue, yellow, and white is drawn and blown upon them, then the garments are visualized wrapped in five-colored cloud *qi*.

**Paying Homage**
The deceased is visualized dressed in immortal robes, resplendent, with jade lads and maidens holding banners leading them into the altar. They pay threefold homage to the Most High Merciful Venerable One, then partake in offerings and receive the precepts.

*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Fifty-Eight, concludes.
*Shangqing Lingbao Da Fa*, Scroll Fifty-Nine.

The Illustrious Perfected Ning Quanzhen, Master of Opening Light and Deliverance from Suffering of the Cavernous Subtlety, transmits to the Shangqing Three Caverns disciple and Lingbao Precept-Inheriting Master Wang Qizhen, compiler of *The Gate of Purification Rites: Essential Principles*

**Incantation of the Offering**
The master, at the place of the incantation offering, holds the water vessel and burns the *Transformation of Offerings* talisman within it, visualizing the True Non-Being entering the water. Next, the *Three Lights Mantra* is recited, drawing the *qi* of the Three Lights into the water. Then the *Precious Invocation of the Azure Mystery* is chanted, drawing the *qi* of the Azure Mystery into the water. Further, the *Hidden Words* are recited, drawing the upright *qi* of the Five Directions into the water. Afterward, the *Invocation of the Azure Mystery* is repeated eighty-one times, visualizing the Most High Merciful Venerable One dwelling amidst the cloud *qi* of the East. The *qi* is inhaled and returned to the body, transforming into the Most High Merciful Venerable One, who summons the Great Transformation Spirit King of Qijin to descend and transform the offering. The master then sprinkles the food with the branch-water. If the deceased has not undergone the *Summoning and Healing* rite beneath the canopy, the throat and stomach passage must first be opened, generating fluids to transform the ritual offering. All such offerings are celestial delicacies—cloud-kitchen sweet essences, rare and exquisite viands: intermingled pears and fire-dates, cinnabar apples and flat peaches, their flavors fragrant and exquisite, filling the boundless expanse. The hungry are sated, and the food is inexhaustible.

**Transmission of the Precepts**
The essential principle states: The adept first performs three prostrations before the August Emperor, kneels in silence, and petitions for the descent of the *Yellow Robe* and the *Dao Decree*, the *True Talisman of Deliverance from Suffering*, the *Longevity Talisman of the Divine Official*, the *Guardian Spirit Kings of the Precepts*, the *Divine Lads and Maidens*, the *Jiao Dragons and Golden Dragons*, the *Courier Officials*, and the *Celestial Merit Registrars*. Once summoned, the spirit is led before the precept seat. The adept ascends the seat, offers incense, burns the *Talismans of the Ten Directions’ Flying Celestial Spirit Kings*, recites the incantation, and executes the mudra. Then the *Talismans of the Ten Directions’ Heavenly Perfected Great Spirits* are burned to welcome and invite the witnesses and supervisors. Following the ritual protocol, the Dharma is expounded: for the deceased, sins are repented and cleansed; the *Yellow Robe* and *Dao Decree* are transmitted; the ten virtuous vows of the ten directions are made; the Dharma of karmic retribution and precept verification is explained. The precept master is invited to administer the Three Refuges. The *Talisman of Precept Incense*, the *Transmission Document*, the *Incense Talisman*, the *Talisman of Deliverance from Suffering and Longevity*, the *Essential Instructions for True Liberation*, and the *Dragon Prayer and Precious Register* are burned and proclaimed.

**Offering of Food and Invitation of Descent**
When the evening offering is to be made, the adept must first refine the form, visualize the spirit, and emit the true essence, then perform the morning audience according to the ritual, petitioning the Three Heavens’ Golden Gates. The Jade Emperor is visualized to the left of the Purple Court, and the Azure Mystery to the right—these two palaces are the eyes above, the places of the sun’s emergence and the moon’s entry, the dwelling of the True Dao. The Three Palaces above the brain are the abode of the swift spirits. The adept performs the morning audience in silence, first inviting the descent of the Jade Emperor’s compassionate and auspicious sweet dew to transform and refine the *dou*-offering. After the invitation, whether moving, standing, sitting, or reclining, all is a great offering. The key is to unify the mind’s mechanism; no stray thoughts are permitted.

**Opening the Ghostly Path**
When performing the offering, the adept first sprinkles water over the *dou*-altar according to the ritual, then burns two paper ingots in the *gen* direction. The incantation reads:
*"The Heaven above delivers beings,
To the ranks of the Most Pure, the words ascend."*
*Swiftly, as the Lingbao Deliverance Command decrees.*

The adept presses the left hand’s *Ghost-Eye* mudra and forms the sword mudra with the right, stepping three paces toward the *gen* gate. Facing forward, the sword mudra is used to inscribe the five characters of *Summoning the Long Night Bureau* in the void, and the prayer is recited:
*"Spirit messengers who guide ghostly souls,
Merit registrars of the earthly and ghostly paths,
Local earth gods,
Spirits of the Five Ways,
Hasten to monitor and lead the deceased souls listed in this document,
And all the hidden spirits of the Six Paths,
To the altar to receive offerings and refinement.
I act by the Emperor’s decree."*

After the prayer, the sword mudra inscribes an *Open* character toward the *gen* direction, visualizing the darkness there and burning incense to summon the souls.

**Summoning the Lonely Spirits**
The *Talisman for Pursuing All Souls* is burned, and the City God, Year Star, local earth gods, spirits of the Five Ways, divine tigers, and spirit officials of the *Summoning Bureau* are invoked to lead the souls to the altar. First, the gathering of souls is visualized, as dark mist shrouds the area.

**Ascending the Seat**
The essential principle states: The adept closes their eyes before the seat, burns incense, and transforms the surroundings into the realm of the Five Emperors of Spontaneity. Both hands execute the *Three Heavens’ Five Emperors Mudra*, scattering it above Kunlun. The *Xuanji* is revolved to the left and right, and the root of the tongue’s *qi* is blown outward, causing the radiance of stars and constellations to scatter boundlessly across the floating void. The adept slightly shifts the light of the left and right eyes, transforming the Two Modes, as the sun and moon divide their illumination. Next, the ritual seat is visualized suspended beneath the sun and moon, like a nine-tiered cloud terrace in the world, with jeweled canopies, flowered banners, and streaming pennants arrayed above. The adept then gathers the primordial *qi* from the crown of the head and scatters it above, coiling and floating in the empty space. The Azure Mystery Emperor is visualized seated upon it, the left hand holding a lapis lazuli water goblet, the right hand grasping a malachite branch. The adept slightly shifts the *Moon Gates* to the left and right of Kunlun, transforming the Perfected into multiple forms, arrayed to the left and right. Jade maidens and golden lads stand in solemn attendance. The Emperor’s mouth emits golden light like a round mirror, resembling the moon emerging from clouds. The golden light illuminates all above, below, and the four directions, its jade-like essence shining boundlessly. Even the *dou*-altar is entirely uplifted and transformed by the *qi*, ascending beyond the Milky Way. The adept absorbs the light and *qi*, then ascends the seat in a leftward spiral, suddenly mounting the precious seat. The adept’s body merges with the Most High, and the attendant Perfected appear as visualized. Closing the eyes and unifying the mind, the adept repeats the visualization as before, scattering dragon candles, phoenix lamps, and stars throughout the ten directions above and below. Myriad spirits and countless hosts arrive in ordered ranks at the cloudy boundary to witness and receive, then the ritual proceeds according to protocol.

**Proclamation of the Heavenly Emperor’s Precious Decree**
**Summoning the Six Paths**

Burning the Heavenly Dao Talisman (*Zi* script), the adept visualizes the immortals of the Heavenly Dao, who from the Heavenly Gate ride upon precious light and drive flying clouds, arraying banners and canopied regalia as they float through the void to arrive above. Burning the Spirit Dao Talisman (*Chou* script), the adept visualizes the retinue of the Spirit Dao, who from the Earthly Portal ride upon Brahman *qi* and white blossoms, drawn by wind-horses and cloud-chariots as they float through the void to arrive on the left. Burning the Human Dao Talisman (*Yin* script), the adept visualizes the retinue of the Human Dao, who from the Human Gate ride upon radiant precious light, guided with joyful countenances and transformed aspirations, arriving on the right.

Recitation of the Secret Transformative Incantation:
The Great Offering of Jade Clarity spreads ghee and wine.
Above, it reaches the Nine Heavens; its fragrance encircles the Ten Poles.
All are enabled to receive transformation, universally partaking of the Dharma-food.
This Heavenly Dao, Spirit Dao, and Human Dao are called the Three Auspicious Paths.
Together they array themselves in ranks to pay homage to the Celestial Emperor, hear the Dharma, and receive the offering.

Burning the Earthly Dao Talisman, Ghost Dao Talisman, and Animal Dao Talisman (*Shen* for Earth, *You* for Ghosts, *Xu* for Animals).
With unified mind and focused visualization, the adept emits numinous *qi*, forming the Jade Clarity mudra with both hands and guiding the *qi* in the likeness of a river’s course. From the nose, two streams of *qi* intermingle, then the adept circulates the luminous orb of Azure Mystery, directing it downward to simultaneously suffuse the Three Wretched Paths. The candlelight pierces the dark *qi* of each path, and the shadowy souls of the Three Paths gradually ride the light and *qi* to arrive beneath the altar. Their forms and shadows are freed from all obscurity as they raise their hands in homage and kneel in attendance.

Universal Summoning Incantation for the Three Wretched Paths to Attend the Offering and Pay Homage to the Celestial Emperor:
The myriad transformations of Jade Clarity dissolve and proclaim karmic opposition.
The Auspicious Paths ascend as immortals; the karmic paths are opened and made passable.
By the Celestial Emperor’s decree, they are swiftly summoned to ascend.
Having received the offered sustenance, they ascend to the Celestial Court.
Central *qi*, Eastern *qi*.
Summoning the Departed Souls.
Burning the Summoning Talisman for the Departed Souls.

Visualize the primordial round radiance of the Origin, penetrating and illuminating the ten directions, dispelling the dark yin to transform all into the brilliance of the sun. The solitary souls bow low, all riding the precious light to assemble together at the offering altar.

Form the Mudra of the Summoned Souls, arrange them in ranks, and perform the Transmutation of Food. First burn the talisman, then recite the Invocation Mantra. With hands forming the Five Peaks Seal, invite the *qi* of the five directions into the water.

*Qi* of the Three Lights:
The solar essence, Vermilion Radiance, shines through verdant reflections.
The Crimson Youth of Returning Clouds, the Dark Flame of the Hurricane Image.
Draw the nine rays of sunlight from the left eye’s edge and blow upon the food.

The lunar spirit, Misty Vapor of the Empyrean, fragrant flames veiling the void.
The Orchid of the Hollow Garden, luxuriant blossoms forming canopies.
Pure gold, limpid and bright, the fiery countenance of the Terrace of Brilliance.
Draw the ten rays of moonlight from the right eye’s edge and blow upon the food.

[...] Draw the *qi* of the yellow rays and blow upon the food.
Then recite the Three Venerable Names, gather the *qi* of the Three Heavens, and blow upon the food.

Burn the various talismans for the Transmutation of Food and recite the incantation:
"May food fill the ten directions, opening passages and filling the void.
May those who partake never be sated, ascending in flight to the Jade Capital.
Swiftly, swiftly, as decreed by statute and ordinance."

With left and right hands forming the Jade Clarity Mudra, visualize the self as the Origin, drawing the *qi* of the Heavenly Gate’s threefold descent to receive the practitioner’s body. Blow the *qi* upon the talisman and burn it in the water vessel. Sprinkle the water with a willow branch while reciting the secret mantras, circumambulating and performing the visualization as prescribed. Burn the talisman and recite the mantras.

Mantra of Offering:
The practitioner, activating the True Person of the Cinnabar Palace, offers incense, clicks the teeth, and faces the Heavenly Gate to request the descent of the Golden Light of the Dao *qi*, spreading it in hundreds, thousands, and myriad layers before them.
Closing the eyes, direct the radiance of the sun and moon to intersect with the descending golden light, resembling clouds and mist spreading and steaming forth. The ritual food exudes an extraordinary fragrance, abundant and replete with *qi*, so that none in the ten directions remain untouched.

Having first offered this to the thousand Perfected and ten thousand Sages, after the mantra is recited, it then suffuses and irrigates the multitude of souls.

The prayer declares:
"May Celestial Immortals partake of the offering,
May divine spirits receive the bounty,
May human kindred savor the flavors,
May the virtuous paths ascend and be promoted."

Recite the secret mantra.

Amidst the flowing springs of Kunlun,
The floating, floating *qi* of Primal Purity drifts.
To the left and right of the Azure Mystery’s abode,
Subtle fragrance pervades heaven and earth.
Jade maidens pour the true nectar,
Immortal perfected ones descend with auspicious omens.
Those who partake shall endure for millions of years,
Their bodies and selves wholly as they wish.
Deliver the departed from past transgressions,
That they may forever depart the Great Retribution’s realm.
Swiftly, swiftly, as the Law of the Primordial Celestial Sovereign commands.

**Incantation for Libation and Transformation**
Fumigate the *Mingxing* Great Brahma Divine King’s talisman and recite the prayer:
The Jade Script universally proclaims,
A hundred satisfactions penetrate the void.
From *Mingxing* crystalline essence is born,
Hunger and emptiness forever severed.
Inexhaustible is the food consumed,
Its flavor surpassing celestial kitchens.
By the Sovereign’s seal and ancestral *qi*,
Fumigate the water vessel and invoke
The Jade Emperor’s compassionate, auspicious sweet dew,
To nourish the one hundred and twenty officials and lords,
Imbuing the wine for ritual use.

The officiant extinguishes the lamp, composes the mind with utmost reverence,
Presses the *chen* seal with the left hand to dispel,
Then forms the Seal of Power and Virtue with both hands,
Adopts the Jade Clarity mudra,
Left palm raised, right palm lowered,
Both hands in Jade Clarity, eight fingers joined and lifted.
Visualize the transformation of the *zhi* grain,
Envision the Most Exalted Jade Emperor floating in the void,
Proclaiming the descent of the *Mingxing* Great Brahma Divine King,
His body ten thousand *zhang* in height,
Resembling the Dragon-Tiger Lord,
Four eyes, enveloped in five-colored clouds of *qi*,
Hands and feet radiating beams of light.
He manifests one hundred and ten spirit officers,
Riding black clouds descending from the Celestial Gate,
Each bearing a branch to sprinkle the sweet dew of Dharma rain,
Like fine mist and dense fog, enveloping all in its nourishment.
With each drop sprinkled, the measure expands boundlessly.

Next, from the Palace of Pure Radiance,
Emit a true light.
With both hands in the Jade mudra,
Glance left and right, ascend and descend,
Recite the Great Jade Script mantra in the heart.
In a single thought, unmoving,
Hold fast to the Palace of Clarity and Brightness,
Free from even a single distraction.
Draw the *qi* of the five directions to intersect,
Binding them into a single sphere,
Luminous as a precious mirror,
Shining through without obstruction.
From the round mirror’s center, the Dao generates One,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates Nine,
Nine transforms into eighty-one.
Then transforms endlessly,
Pervading the ten directions.
The measure ascends from below to the heights,
Reaching the celestial canopy,
Expanding boundlessly,
With the void’s ethereal, numinous mist swirling around the cinnabar realm,
Illuminating the sacred altar.
The offered measure of food follows the mind’s intent,
Transforming without hindrance or obstruction.
Extraordinary fragrance encircles the ten extremities,
Dharma flavors fill the world.
The measure of food hangs suspended within,
Extending to the inner and outer banquet tables,
The wilds, mountains, rivers, valleys,
Pervading the world entirely,
All becoming the measure of food.

Next, execute the Ten Celestial Seals,
Summon the Jade Maiden Youth Lords,
Their number like grains of sand,
To feed, guide, and usher the multitude of souls to receive the food.

**The Scripture of the Five Kitchens**
The essence of the *Scripture of the Five Kitchens*
Is to fill the five viscera with the five spirits.
When the five viscera are properly filled, flavors suffice;
When the five spirits are serene, cravings cease.
Thus, this scripture governs the five viscera,
As one seeks clothing and food from the kitchen—hence, the Five Kitchens.

**Secret Stanzas of Longevity (Mao Seal, Blue *Qi*)**
One *qi* harmonizes with Supreme Harmony,
Attaining the One, the Dao is wholly great.
Harmony is without a single harmony,
Mysterious principle unites with the Mysterious Limit.

**Secret Stanzas of Non-Hunger (Li Seal, Red *Qi*)**
Do not think with thoughts,
Nor seek thoughtlessness.
Thought without re-thought—
This is the Dharma to be thus upheld.

**Secret Stanzas of Non-Heat (Middle Seal, Yellow *Qi*)**
All foods are *qi*-bound *qi*,
Not the *qi* of long stillness.
*Qi* returns to the original *qi*,
Take as the world takes.

**Secret Stanzas of Non-Cold (You Seal, White *Qi*)**
Cultivate the will, depart from will,
Accumulated cultivation does not match departure.
Will without cultivating will—
One’s karma is unknown even to oneself.

**Secret Stanzas of Non-Thirst (Kan Seal, Black *Qi*)**
Do not bind the heart to the heart,
Nor abide in absolute severance.
With heart present, do not retain the heart—
In truth, guard the true abyss.

The immeasurable food of the Three Heavens,
Fills the Dharma realm.
To relieve your hunger and thirst,
Is the formless, pure body.
*Sanma sanma, mani mani.*
By imperial decree, by imperial decree,
The Three Heavens’ decree, *ma*.
Three Heavens’ decree, *ma*,
Three Heavens’ *fu*.
*Om*, decree, *hum*.
Press the Middle Seal.

Recite the Precious Name of the Azure Mystery ninety-nine times, eighty-one cycles. Draw *qi* into the body, transforming the self into the Great Unity’s Merciful Venerable One, seated upon the Mystery Board. Banners and pennants of brocade hang overhead. In the left hand, a water bell; in the right, a branch of treasures, sprinkling sweet dew throughout. Then visualize the Great Unity riding azure clouds in the Void of Space, together sprinkling sweet rain. The four directions merge in flight, the Dharma rain and merciful clouds suffuse boundlessly, all brimming and overflowing. Next, recite the middle section, envisioning the thirty-two heavens of the four quarters, their streaming rays of *qi* pouring into the *hu* food, filling the boundless worlds. The multitudes of the Three Wretched Paths, the deceased spirits, and the lonely souls all partake, drinking their fill and receiving sufficiency.

The ritual complete, silently circulate and transform the *mingjing* talisman. With the Jade Emperor’s merciful and auspicious sweet dew, moisten and bathe the forms of the six paths’ hidden souls, washing their faces and altering their appearances. Joyfully they listen, bowing their heads, clenching their fists in reverence, gazing up at the merciful countenance, returning to life to pay homage. Then, with the mudras of the left and right hands, guide the souls with radiant *qi*, arranging them in the ten directions, all illumined with light. They take refuge in the Three Treasures, kneeling to receive the talismanic precepts.

Yet, fearing that the hidden spirits may bear grudges from past lives, unresolved even in death, one must employ talismanic proclamations to admonish and reconcile, harmonizing and releasing their enmities, guiding them toward the good Dao. Burn and dissolve the talismans for releasing karmic knots:

- Talisman for dissolving the ten injuries
- Lanterns of the thirty-two heavens
- Proclamations to the passes of all heavens
- Proclamations to the lanterns of the thirty-two heavens

Invoke the Three Supreme Venerables of the Most High, the thirty-two Heavenly Lords, the lofty perfected of the Three Realms, the multitude of sages of the ten directions, the boundless flying heavenly spirit-kings, the great demon-kings of the Three Realms, the five demon-kings, and the jade maidens and divine immortals to oversee the deliverance.

The lantern altar is arranged in three tiers:
- The upper tier represents the four heavens of the Formless Realm, with the position of the Formless Realm’s demon-king and the banners of the ten directions’ flying heavenly spirit-kings.
- The middle tier represents the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm, with the position of the Form Realm’s demon-king.
- The lower tier represents the six heavens of the Desire Realm, with the position of the Desire Realm’s demon-king.

**The Great Refinement of the Numinous Treasure**
No rite of purification is more arduous than the refinement and deliverance—this is the path of transcending the mortal to enter sagehood, of shedding the husk and transforming the substance. The suffering souls, sunk in the nine nights, long for the dawn’s faint sunlight. If one grasps the principle, water and fire intermingle, and the yin corpse’s filthy substance instantly gives birth to spirit. Without the proper method, mere recitation of the scriptures and rituals is futile, a vain burden upon the hidden darkness. This is the foremost task of the high adept.

The master ascends the refinement and deliverance altar, visualizing the five-colored radiance of pure rosy clouds swirling above and below. First, establish the water pool: the *hai* trigram, northern *qi*. At the *shen* hour, make the mudra, summon the Northern Dipper’s *gang*, recite the spirit scripture, and stir the water while chanting the twelve river sources thirty-two times. Draw the *qi* of the northern Celestial River’s water into the pool, burn the true water talisman, the talisman of the water-controlling general, and the water-refinement talisman, envisioning the officials encircling it.

Next, establish the fire pool: the *wu* trigram, southern *qi*. Summon the Southern Dipper, recite the spirit scripture, and spread the fire. Then chant the "Cast Fire Ten Thousand Miles" thirty-two times, drawing the southern fire *qi* into the pool. Burn the true fire talisman, the talisman of the fire-controlling general, and the fire-refinement talisman, envisioning the officials encircling it, transforming the scene into a cinnabar heaven world.

Once stabilized, the master transforms the body to fill heaven and earth, the mud-pill, envisioning the Three Heavens’ realm upon the forehead, the nine heavens’ and thirty-two heavens’ realms, each with its terrace and palace. The left eye is the sun palace, the right eye the moon palace; the seven orifices are all starry constellations. The nape is the Terrace of Yu Luo Xiao, the mouth the Celestial River, the neck the twelve-storied tower, the heart the Vermilion Mound’s fire府, the spine the heavenly steps. The left kidney’s water pool emits jade water, the right kidney’s fire pool emits jade fire. The tailbone is the yin pass. The entire body transforms, becoming one with heaven and earth. The body is enclosed within heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are enclosed within the body. One forgets one’s own form, only the cinnabar prime lord of the heart, bearing the primordial *qi*, ascends to the mud-pill, transforming into the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, seated upright in the cavern chamber, bestowing the supreme Dao.

Left and right officials, jade lads and maidens attend, with officials stationed everywhere. The Primordial Beginning emits great radiance, illuminating the yin pass below, which opens wide. Countless ghostly souls enter the vast enclosure. The master channels the Celestial River’s water, pouring it into the eastern well, then into the left kidney’s water pool. The right eye’s moonlight shines directly into the water pool, its light bright and clear. Next, the master channels the cinnabar heaven’s fire, pouring it into the right kidney’s fire marsh. The left eye’s sunlight shines directly into the fire marsh, its flames blazing. Water and fire intermingle, resplendent and luminous. The master commands the great water-controlling general and the water pool officials to guide the souls into the water pool. This "water" is the essence of the true one. When yin spirits enter the water, their dust and filth are washed away, their countenances becoming youthful and jade-bright.

Next, burn the water-refinement talismans, then command the great fire-controlling general and the fire marsh officials to guide the souls into the fire marsh for smelting. This "fire" is the *qi* of true yang. Once yin souls enter the fire marsh, their souls melt like fire dates, their yin corpses reborn and their substance transformed. Burn the fire-refinement talismans, recite the hidden incantations, and draw the *qi* of the four directions to generate life. Then burn the five emperors’ complete-body talisman, causing the five viscera and six bowels to simultaneously generate spirit. Next, envision maidens holding the celestial garments of contention, bestowing them upon the deceased souls. Imagine the souls donning the garments, their appearances radiant and splendid.

The officials guide the souls up the heavenly steps of the spine, ascending to the Vermilion Mound’s fire府. The master burns the bridge-crossing talisman, envisioning the souls crossing the bridge, further refined by the sunlight, their skeletal forms no longer ordinary. Within the fire marsh, countless fire dragons bear the infant souls upward to the Terrace of Yu Luo Xiao, where they are reborn according to their rank.

The master swallows saliva, returning the emitted water and fire *qi* to their respective officials. The rite concludes, and the talismans are burned.

**The Nine Heavens’ Refinement and Transformation**

The master stabilizes breath and concentrates spirit, drawing in a mouthful of generative *qi* and directing it straight into the Gate of Life within the primordial womb. Circulating the boundaries of the Nine Heavens to irrigate and fuse, it coalesces into an infant resembling the master’s own form. Within and without, the adept seals the grip, while the residual radiance suffuses heaven and earth.

Next, the master circulates the *qi* of the five viscera in their five colors, ascending like clouds from below. The infant, borne upon the celestial steps, rises to the Mud Pill Palace, where it transforms into the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The true *qi* of the five viscera coalesces into a lion. The Celestial Worthy emits wisdom-light, round as a precious pearl, suspended above the five-colored lion. A hundred-jeweled radiance illumines all heavens and earths, inwardly and outwardly resplendent. To the left, the sun; to the right, the moon. Jade lads and jade maidens stand in attendance.

The Celestial Worthy summons the Lords of Refinement and Transformation to perform their office, while countless ghostly souls gather within the Pass of Darkness. Then, the master envisions the twin pools of water and fire, inner and outer reflecting one another, with the Lords of Refinement and Transformation arrayed to left and right. The souls are led in sequence into the refinement.

As souls enter the fire marsh, true yang dissolves and transforms them, rendering them like fire-jujubes. Next, the souls are guided into the water pool, where worldly dust is scoured away, and their bodies become luminous. This is the refining of the jade pupils and the scouring of the yellow blossom.

When the water and fire refinement is complete, the Nine-Chapter Refinement of the Primordial Beginning is performed. After reciting the first chapter, the master circulates the yellow *qi* of the spleen, irrigating the primordial womb’s Gate of Life to generate the womb, enabling the primordial womb to flow freely. After reciting the second chapter, the master circulates the crimson *qi* of the heart, irrigating the primordial womb’s Gate of Life to generate the embryo, dissolving the roots of karmic knots. After reciting the third chapter, the master circulates the pale red *qi* of the small intestine, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the *hun*-soul to generate the *hun*, enabling the Gate of the *Hun* to refine the immortal. After reciting the fourth chapter, the master circulates the white *qi* of the lungs, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the *po*-soul to generate the *po*, sealing the Gate of the *Po*. After reciting the fifth chapter, the master circulates the azure *qi* of the liver, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the viscera to generate the viscera, cooling and purifying the organs. After reciting the sixth chapter, the master circulates the dark green *qi* of the bladder, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the numinous palace to generate the numinous palace, stimulating the stomach’s production of fluids. After reciting the seventh chapter, the master circulates the black *qi* of the kidneys, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the primordial palace to generate the primordial palace, opening the orifices and sharpening perception. After reciting the eighth chapter, the master circulates the green *qi* of the large intestine, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the splendorous palace to generate the splendorous palace, perfecting the three divisions and eight landscapes of form and spirit. After reciting the ninth chapter, the master circulates the purple *qi* of the stomach, irrigating the primordial Gate of Life of the mountain palace to generate the mountain palace, so that the three barriers, five viscera, six palaces, nine palaces, golden towers, jade chambers, twelve-layered gates, purple portals, jade gates, thirty-six thousand joints—all roots and origins—simultaneously generate spirit.

When refinement is complete, the sins and worldly dust of the souls are entirely scoured away, their original natures revealed in clarity. Karmic knots are untied, grievances resolved, and they transcend the near to enter sagehood. The celestial lads and maidens bestow upon them the pure garments of heaven’s birth, fragrant and resplendent.

The master envisions the twin pools of water and fire coalescing into the Flowing Fire Court within the Palace of the Heart. The souls are led in sequence to ascend the Flowing Fire Court, where countless fire dragons are conjured. These dragons bear the Long Geng Vases, each carrying an infant upward to the Terrace of Yu Luo Xiao, where they ascend on radiant light, receiving transformation according to their rank.

When the rite is complete, the master returns to the Palace of True Primordium, stabilizes breath, swallows saliva, descends from the seat, and writes talismans for future use. No further delusions remain.

**The Fundamental Source of Refinement, Corporeal Generation, and Spirit Birth**

To perform the method of refinement and transformation, one must first understand how to gather, ingest, and absorb the true *qi* of the Three Luminaries—sun essence and moon radiance—exhaling the old and inhaling the new. Only then can one summon the yang spirit within, refine away yin obstructions, and master the method of refining and transforming the souls of the deceased.

When a person’s lifespan reaches thirty-six thousand days, the spirit is exhausted and returns to Grand Yin, becoming a ghost. "Ghost" means "return." Yet the sins and transgressions of one’s former life, the depletion of *qi* and dissipation of spirit, are self-inflicted, leading some to die in infancy before fulfilling their allotted years. Their spirit and *qi* incomplete, their form cannot endure. The dead are but yin *po*-souls, drifting in darkness—how could they ever be reborn in the yang world? Thus, true water and true fire, sun essence and moon radiance, are employed to gather the *qi* of the Nine Yangs, blending them with the five spirits of the deceased to return to the root and regenerate the corpse.

Ancient methods required nine masters, each establishing one heaven and refining one *qi*, performing nine refinements to transform and generate spirit, gathering numinosity in the Court of Grand Unity, and refining substance in the realm of Vermilion Mound. Yet many practitioners, ignorant of the secret texts of cultivation, merely rely on cinnabar, inscribing talismanic forms, and superficially employing water and fire. They do not comprehend the *qi* of Vermilion Mound, the method of its application, or the position of the Yellow Blossom in the Eastern Well. Without visualization, they fail to circulate the five palaces, blend them into the true, and refine them overnight—how then can a person be formed?

**True Water**

True water is the one *qi* within yin, known as "Heaven One generates water," also called the August Ultimate. Why? Within the Supreme Ultimate, the one symbolizes primordial *qi*. Once primordial *qi* germinates, form and substance are already present. The Great Simplicity further transforms it to scour yin impurities, producing the Yellow Blossom, the true essence of Grand Yin. This is true water, flowing into the Celestial River.

Yet to circulate the water of the Celestial River into the Eastern Well, one must descend the Yellow Blossom into the Eastern Well—this is water overflowing upon wood. The function of water flowing above and fire below is thus achieved. This is "killing water," its color black and turbid—how can it nourish infants and cultivate the hundred spirits? In its chaos and division, it knows no end.

The *qi* of pure yang ascends and floats to become heaven. The *qi* of primordial yin descends and condenses to become earth. Heaven and earth originate from yin and yang, and the principle of their movement and stillness lies in circulating the Yellow Blossom above the Eastern Well, gathering the numen of Heaven One and generating the fire of Earth Two. Thus, water above and fire below flow into the Three Palaces.

**Method for Gathering True Water**

**Method for Gathering the Yellow Blossom Spirit-Water from the Eastern Well**

The formula states: To gather the Yellow Blossom spirit-water from the Eastern Well, choose the day when the Well constellation governs within the lunar month. Apply the monthly *Jiang* (lunar mansion) to the governing constellation, then count backward to locate the Well’s position. Take the direction accordingly. Let *Hai* (the twelfth earthly branch) represent the first month, and *Xu* (the eleventh) the second. The monthly *Jiang* moves in reverse. On the day the Well governs, suppose in the first month it resides in *Mao* (the fourth branch): place the *Jiang* of *Hai* over *Mao*, then count forward to *Wei* (the eighth branch) to find *Mao*, the Well’s direction. This is where the Celestial River pours into the Eastern Well—draw water from this point for use.

The method says: Collect water at dawn, just as the sun departs *Bo Sang* (the mulberry tree of sunrise). Choose water from the Eastern Well that no one has yet drawn. First, inscribe the water-summoning talisman on green paper with realgar, then dissolve it in the well. Trace the *Gan* trigram, inhale the *qi* of the northwest, and hold a candle to illuminate the water below. Next, draw the water into a clean vessel. With both hands, trace the *Gan* trigram, blink thrice with the right eye, and circulate the *qi* of the two kidneys upward along the spine to the crown. Draw the northwest *qi* through both nostrils to the crown, where it commingles, then direct it into the water. Visualize water above and fire below—this is true water.

**Illuminating True Fire**
True fire is the fire within yang. This fire dispels yin impurities, smelts and refines the infant, then merges with one’s own *qi* to harmonize. Next, seek external true fire to unite with internal true fire, blending them into one—this is yang within yang. The primordial *qi* of Heaven’s unity is drawn into the cinnabar field, where internal *qi* is refined into a single mass—this is purple gold.

For example, the fire of the south and the turbid black water of the north—how can these two generate transformation? The south’s *qi* is red, the north’s black, both being destructive *qi*—how can they nurture? Practitioners of refinement and deliverance today transmit errors without seeking true mastery. The south’s *qi* should be the southeast’s, and the north’s the northwest’s. The southeast is the Vermilion Palace, whose fire nurtures all things and enables generation. The northwest is the Gate of Heaven, whence Heaven One generates this water, which nurtures all things—it is the domain of the Heavenly Emperor, called rain and dew. When rain and dew descend, withered bones flourish anew; when the celestial *qi* clarifies, the solar *qi* may be gathered. Refine and deliver at midnight during overcast nights, burning talismans to draw *qi*.

**Method for Gathering True Fire**
The formula states: To gather the true fire of solar essence, first use willow charcoal and bitter bamboo. On the day of *Wu* (the seventh earthly branch), face the sun at noon, cut the bamboo to obtain fire, and use incense seals to kindle it. Once lit, inscribe the fire-summoning talisman on crimson paper with cinnabar, trace the *Si* trigram, and inhale the southeast *qi*. Use the talisman to guide the fire to ignite the charcoal.

The method says: Turn your gaze to the left shoulder, visualize the red dragon in your heart emerging from the left ear. Let firelight flow from the right eye, and let the dragon ride the fire upward into the flame—this is true fire.

**Method for Employing Water and Fire**
At night, perform the refinement and deliverance by erecting an altar. Place a round brazier in the fire pool to hold true fire, and a square vessel in the water pool to hold true water. Erect two tablets: one for the water pool, one for the fire moat. Use a crimson banner for the fire pool and a yellow banner for the water pool. For the five directions, use five-colored banners inscribed with the talismans of the Five Emperors.

**Altar Method for Water-Fire Refinement and Deliverance**
First, kneel before the Supreme Emperor and memorialize. Light the thirty-two lamps of heaven. Place the fire moat at the mouth of the Southern Dipper and the water pool at the mouth of the Northern Dipper. Arrange the Great Emperor of the Southern Culmen and the Nine Heavens Life-Generating Supreme Emperor behind them. In the center, array the thirty-two lamps of heaven, with the sun on the left and the moon on the right. Surround them with the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the ten directions, the Heavenly Merit Officers, the Great Perfected of the Ten Directions, the attendants of the Yellow Register Court, the officials on duty, the Six Offices of Heavenly Physicians, the Flying Heavenly Envoys of the Ten Directions, the golden dragons, the *jiao* dragons, and the courier officials. Invoke the spirits to ascend their thrones.

Offer incense and summon the Flying Heavenly Divine Kings of the Ten Directions, the Great Perfected of the Ten Directions, and the thirty-two Heavenly Emperor Lords and their attendants to descend upon the altar. This is the assembly of all perfected beings overseeing the deliverance, with the ten directions in attendance.

Next, guide the souls to undergo refinement according to the ritual procedures.

**The Five Kalpas of Transformation and Liberation**
For delivering the departed souls:
1. The first rite establishes merit to redeem sins—this is *deliverance*.
2. The second is *ascension*.
3. The third is *transcendence*.
4. The fourth elevates rank and status.
5. The fifth is *salvation*.

*Deliverance* applies when the deceased first enters the nether realm, bound by karmic debts. It extricates them from the earthly prison, allowing rebirth according to their rank, and subjects them to the Three Lights refinement.

*Ascension* addresses concerns that the deceased, in life, accrued little merit but heavy karma. Human existence comprises thirty-six ranks—fearing rebirth into poverty or lowly stations, one performs myriad meritorious deeds to aid ascension, undergoing the Southern Prosperity refinement.

*Transcendence* arises from fear that the deceased may be reborn in the middle ranks. Out of filial devotion and sorrow, one establishes universal deliverance, broadly aiding the six paths and four births to accumulate extraordinary merit, enabling transcendence to higher ranks through the Nine Refinements of the Living Corpse.

*Elevating rank and status* applies when the deceased, reborn among humans, fails to return to the true transformation. Thus, one elevates their rank through the Numinous Treasure refinement.

*Salvation* addresses concerns that the deceased, across three lives and seven generations, may have creditors—those owed lives or debts. Though they receive the talismanic decree of the Most High for rebirth, they may still be bound by karmic adversaries, unable to attain freedom. Hence, this is called *salvation*. It involves broad deliverance of the submerged and flying ascension through refinement—this is the Five Kalpas of Transformation and Liberation.

**The Three Lights Refinement**
The Three Lights are the upright *qi* of heaven: the sun, moon, and stars. These are heaven’s three wonders—the sun, moon, and stars; earth’s three wonders—*yi*, *bing*, and *ding*; and humanity’s three wonders—essence, *qi*, and spirit. Their union forms nine, the number of yang.

**The Rite of Thanksgiving**
Guang Cheng said: The *jiao* is another name for sacrifice.

Blood offerings with bound sacrificial animals are called *ji* (祭), while refined vegetarian offerings of fruits and vegetables are called *jiao* (醮). Both may summon the perfected and invoke the numinous. Within the *Hetu Jingpin* and the Three Caverns, there are forty-two ranks, akin to the methods of *zhai* (斋), along with various miscellaneous *jiao* rites, totaling fifty-six categories. These were established by sages of old and worthies of later times, responding to circumstances to universally summon the perfected, pray for blessings, deliver beings, benefit humanity, assist royal transformation, and nurture all creatures. All take the Most High as their sovereign and the Northern Dipper as their宗. If the ritual implements are abundant and refined, and the heart is sincere to the utmost, what good will not descend, what evil will not be eradicated? Yet if the rites of invitation are improper, or movements and postures lack measure, they cannot induce the descent of the numinous.

From this, it is clear that within the Three Caverns there are twenty-seven ranks of *zhai* and forty-two ranks of *jiao*. In recent times, ignorant and reckless practitioners claim that the *Lingbao* tradition establishes *zhai*, while the *Zhengyi* tradition has *jiao*. After dispersing the altar following a *zhai*, they change the *Zhengyi* title, alter the *Zhengyi* vestments, and only then perform the *jiao*—how erroneous this is! In truth, *jiao* exist in all Three Caverns. Moreover, the *jiao* following the dispersal of the altar marks the conclusion of the *zhai* affair, offering thanks to the perfected spirits. How could one alter the title or change vestments, conducting it as a separate rite? Such carelessness and novelty-seeking disrupt and disorder the ritual canons—how can this be justified? This is the correct principle of past and present, the universal discourse of the world; how can private whims be allowed to disorder it?

Recently, after dispersing the altar and sending off the masters, some again invite the perfected and perform another *jiao*, calling it a "special *jiao*." If this is taken as the meaning of a *jiao* following a *zhai*, it greatly loses the original intent. If following ancient methods, it differs vastly from the great elixir. In antiquity, there were no arranged *daochang* (道场) rituals; all affairs were conducted upon the altar. If a *jiao* was held, it took place outside the altar, using a green cloth and crimson seat, with seasonal fruits and *jiao* offerings. No *qingjiao* (请醮) document was used; after prostrating to present the memorial and casting the dragon tablets, the perfected were invited to establish the *jiao*.

In modern times, though altars are set up, images and positions are arranged, and *daochang* are laid out, the *jiao* is still conducted within the *daochang*. If adhering to ancient forms, after presenting the memorial upon the altar, the *jiao* should be established. Alternatively, within the *daochang* on the altar, the Three Offerings ritual may be performed. After sending off the masters and clearing the mats, the affair is simple yet coherent, not violating ancient canons. Otherwise, after presenting the memorial and casting the dragon tablets, one may exit the furnace gate, retire to rest briefly, then re-enter, ascend the altar, perform the rites to invite the perfected, establish the *jiao*, receive the precepts, take office, send off the masters, clear the mats, recite the *Three Paths and Five Sufferings* hymn, circumambulate the altar, exit the gate, and disperse the various altar officials. This is also permissible.

For *jiao* implements like writing brushes and horses, they merely symbolize sincerity; presenting a dedicated document is also acceptable. In antiquity, beyond memorials to the throne, official documents were few. From the Supreme Emperor to the ranked perfected, arrangements were made as appropriate, so *jiao* positions were not numerous. In later times, as documents, memorials, and official correspondence multiplied, all bureaus receiving written orders were to be thanked with a *jiao*. The Son of Heaven used 3,600 positions; feudal lords, 2,400; and those of 1,200 positions. Below these, commoners used 360, 240, or 120 positions, adjusted according to the affair’s scale and weight. Anything less could not suffice.

Some modern practitioners combine all positions of the perfected into one, which is somewhat reasonable. Yet to merge the Nine Heavens’ Supreme Emperor into one position, or the Thirty-Two Heavens into another—such acts are greatly irreverent. Today, all perfected should be individually established. Among the various methods, the countless generals and officers are difficult to enumerate; unavoidably, they are grouped by category and somewhat consolidated. Moreover, by broadly arranging wine and fruits before the generals and officers and universally performing the *jiao* to thank them, there is no need for precise calculation—this is especially excellent. Careful consideration is essential in practice.

Recently, the *Three Paths and Five Sufferings* hymn and the circumambulation of the altar gate have become improper. Yet establishing the altar’s spread, modeling heaven and earth, setting up gates and listing placards, all serve to demonstrate ritual form. At the conclusion of the *zhai* and *jiao*, the altar is dismantled—why the haste to remove the placards? Such disorder of dignity and intermingling of movements is truly inconvenient. Moreover, the words of the *Three Paths and Five Sufferings* merely expound on sin and fortune to uphold the scriptural teachings; they have no relation to removing gate placards. This merits deep consideration.

**Casting Dragon Tablets and Presenting Memorials**
The ritual states: The Great Dao, with one *qi*, transforms and gives rise to the Three Powers, shaping the myriad existences. Thus, it divides the Three Yuan bureaus to govern sin and fortune—namely, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who oversee the Three Yuan. Human life and death, longevity and early demise, sin and fortune, good and ill—all are tied to them. The Three Registers are also the canonical formats of the Three Yuan.

According to the *Lingxian Pin* of the *Xia Yuan Huanglu Jianwen* (Lower Yuan’s Yellow Register Memorials): When the cultivation of karmic roots and the refinement of威仪 are complete, one should, in accordance with the *Chishu Yujue* (Red Writ Jade Instructions), wipe the three memorials to report to the Three Yuan. The mountain memorial is a jade tablet inscribed in cinnabar, accompanied by a golden dragon and nine golden clasps, bound with azure silk. It is sealed and cast into the sacred mountains, celestial heavens, grotto heavens, and sheer cliffs to connect with the numinous mountains and Five Peaks as a token of ascent and deliverance, memorializing the Heavenly Official of the Upper Yuan.

The earth memorial is a jade tablet inscribed in cinnabar, also bound with a golden dragon, golden clasps, and azure silk, buried at the altar residence. Guang Cheng said: It is cast into the altar’s heavenly well or buried at the lunar mansion’s position as a token of ascent and deliverance, reporting to the Earthly Official of the Middle Yuan.

The water memorial is a jade tablet inscribed in cinnabar, accompanied by a golden dragon and golden clasps, bound with azure silk, and cast into the three rivers, sacred springs, deep pools, and water palaces as a token of ascent and deliverance, reporting to the Water Official of the Lower Yuan.

The method for the three memorial tablets requires nine golden clasps each, totaling twenty-seven clasps. Each tablet is further accompanied by one golden dragon and one jade *bi* disk, then bound with azure silk before casting. According to the *Statutes of Alliance with the Perfected*, each is expounded in detail to report to the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, enabling their oversight of the ritual merits. Should any be deficient, the matter shall be examined by the Nine Bureau Officials of the Earthly Office. The *jian* (简) signifies "report," while the *zha* (札) signifies "record"—recording the virtues of the age and reporting them to the Supreme Perfected.

The tablets are one foot and two inches in length, two inches and four *fen* in width, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi*, and two *fen* in thickness, corresponding to the Two Modes. Their upper and lower edges are square, symbolizing the sun’s square brilliance. They are upright and unobstructed, yielding to nothing. For the state, they are made of jade, for jade possesses nine virtues and serves as a token of reverence for Heaven, Earth, and the numinous spirits. Thus, jade is used. For dukes, ministers, scholars, and commoners, they are made of *huai* wood, though the method remains the same. The *jin* wood, being pure white and fine-textured, may be likened to jade, thereby distinguishing the noble from the base.

The dragon rides the clouds and *qi*, governing yin and yang. When united, it forms a body; when dispersed, it forms patterns. Its transformations are unfathomable, entering the earth and ascending to Heaven. Thus, in the supremely yang realm of the Three Heavens, it serves as a courier to transmit commands and communicate with the mysterious void—such is the dragon. As a yang creature, it is employed by Heaven. Therefore, in the heavens, dragons serve as couriers and steeds, traveling to and fro among humans. The dragons are cast in superior gold, each weighing one *liang*. The state uses superior gold, while dukes and high ministers use secondary gold, and scholars and commoners gild silver. Superior gold is the hardest of the five metals, unchanging and treasured by Heaven and Earth, uniting with the numinous and harmonizing with the divine. Thus, the dragon’s form is adopted, and it is cast into grotto-heavens to report to the Three Primes.

The officials and subordinates of the grotto-heavens, upon receiving the dragon and memorial tablet, record the meritorious deeds and report them to the Supreme Sages. The response to such devotion is as inevitable as a shadow following form. Those who cultivate and esteem the Dao must not neglect this. The *bi* disk is a treasure used in rites for Heaven, Earth, and mountains and rivers. For the mountain memorial, a green *bi* is used as a token of the Nine Heavens, emulating Heaven. It is made of green jade, circular in shape, two inches in diameter, with a hollow center. For the earth memorial, a yellow *bi* is used as a token of the Nine Lands, emulating the color of Earth. Its shape is square, three inches in diameter, with a hollow center, for the square symbolizes Earth’s form. For the water memorial, a black *bi* is used as a token of the Water Official, emulating the color of water. It is made of black jade, hexagonal in shape, three inches in diameter, with a hollow center.

The clasps serve as substitutes for the blood of oaths. The state uses gold, while ministers and commoners gild silver. The clasps are nine *fen* in diameter, resembling rings. The azure silk serves as a substitute for cutting hair, conveying sincerity in the alliance and bearing the greatest weight.

The method for casting the three memorial tablets, according to the *Guang Cheng Statutes*, states: After the ritual master presents the memorial and declares the merits, and the recitation is complete, the tablets may be buried in the altar the following morning without awaiting further rites. However, in Zhang Chengxian’s ritual protocols, the three memorials are presented to different Perfected ranks, as detailed in the *Investiture of Memorial Tablets* section. In current ritual altars, the earth memorial is reported and buried immediately upon declaring merits and dissolving the altar. Though the mountain and water memorials have been recited, one must divine an auspicious day or await the ritual’s appointed time. Preparing offerings and ritual implements, the Dharma Master leads the officials either by boat to water grottoes or by land to renowned mountains. Outside the grotto-heavens, they sweep the area clean with grass brooms, arrange the ritual mat, and set out offerings of wine, fruit, tea, and venison. The state uses sixty portions, while ministers and commoners use twenty-four, following the standard ritual protocol.

Donning ceremonial robes and purifying themselves, they perform the rites of audience and proceed with the ritual according to the statutes, casting the memorials in due order. Only then is the affair complete. The local spirit officials overseeing the altar and ritual officers shall report to the immortal bureaus of the grotto-heavens, transmitting the memorials of the ritual. Thus, blessings and virtue manifest immediately. One must not merely report in the altar and cast the tablets into the grottoes without such transmission, lest the local Perfected fail to receive them, the merits go unrecognized, and grave offenses be incurred, resulting in great loss.

If the grottoes of mountains and waters are distant and the Dharma Master and assembly cannot all attend, two ritual officers and the ritual master shall accompany the memorials to the grotto site, perform the offerings, report, and cast them. The memorial texts must not be concealed or delayed, for the local officials will record and report such negligence, and the offense shall not be light. This must be strictly observed.

Over time, the texts for transmitting and reporting the memorials have been abridged through copying, retaining only the invocations. These have now been meticulously revised and are recorded separately. Whether for the king, officials, or the people, extending to the nine generations of parents, those who establish grand rituals in the long night of the Three Wretched Realms must report to the Nine Heavens and cast memorials to the Three Primes. The blessings and benefits are boundless. Listen carefully and act accordingly; do not grow lax, lest demons harm your person.

If the state performs the *Investiture of the Golden Register*, its protocols differ in complexity from these ordinary rites, and one must act according to careful consideration.

It is further said: If there are perfected adepts who wish to deliver the people of all heavens, the faithful men and women, from the Three Wretched Realms, the Five Sufferings, and the Eight Difficulties, enabling them to transcend the Three Evils and encounter the Dao in every lifetime, they should select the days of the eight solar terms and the *jiazi* cycle to cast jade memorials to the Three Primes. This removes their names from the registers of past transgressions and reports them to Heaven. The matter is transmitted through the Three Officials, the Nine Bureaus, and the various heavens, each reporting in turn. The myriad spirits respectfully guard them, the Five Thearchs attend them, the Three Realms’ officials welcome them, and the gates and doors are purified. Heavenly and earthly spirits, the sun and moon, come to pay homage, while the thousand demons and myriad spirits dare not intrude.

When their resolve is firm and their aspirations steadfast, all may enable their seven generations of ancestors—father and mother—to immediately escape the Three Wretched Realms and the Five Sufferings, ascend to the Heavenly Halls, and have the retributions of life and death, sin and blessing, echo and reciprocate without fail. The Three Officials and Nine Bureaus record each person’s merits and transgressions, and this principle is most evident. Through countless lifetimes, the karmic connections are preserved down to the slightest fraction, with nothing left unaccounted.

It is further said: Zhang Chengxian states that when a scholar receives the Central Alliance and wears its tokens, seeking immortality and the erasure of sins, they should, in accordance with the *Scripture of Spontaneous Nature* and its rites, cast ten gold buttons into the Dragon’s Clear Springs as a pledge for the Dao of immortality. Upon ascending the altar again to receive the Two Registers of the Five Elders’ Red Writ, the staff of contemplation, the contract for stabilizing resolve, and other documents, they should, in accordance with the *Alliance of Perfected Rites*, cast twenty-seven buttons of the Three Dragons into the three sites of mountains, waters, and dwellings as a testament to their quest for immortality. Thereafter, following the *Jade Instructions*, they should separately cast twenty-seven talismans of the Nine Dragons into the three sites of mountains, waters, and dwellings on the days of the eight solar terms, seeking the removal of their names from the registers of transgressions and the reporting of their names to Heaven.

**Memorial to the Celestial Pardon of Suffering**
Within their sleeves, they carry nine talismans of the Nine Dragons. Stepping the *Dingang* and visualizing the subjugation of spirits, they proceed as in the memorial rites. Arriving at the realm of the Demon King of the Desire Realm, they next behold the realm of the Form Realm, then the realm of the Formless Realm, entering the Azure Way and not the Yellow Way. They then see the realms of the Four Heavens, followed by the gates of the Golden Towers of the Three Heavens. There, they present the contract for ascending to Heaven to the guardian deities of the Heavenly Gates. The Dharma Master dismounts, leaving their attendants behind. The spirits remain outside the gates, where only two azure-clad youths carry the memorial into the eastern hall of the Golden Towers. Next, they see a vermilion-robed spirit official and a youth in azure, who receive the memorial and lead them to the Palace of Primordial Unity and Life and the Eastern Ultimate Bureau. Before the Audience Hall of the Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering, they present the contents of the memorial. The Perfected One then leads them to the Celestial Emperor of the Azure Mystery, seated upon his throne, flanked by a nine-headed lion and two Perfected Ones. The petitioner bows nine times below the steps, kneels, and orally presents the memorial. Upon completion, they exit the Palace of Primordial Unity and Life and enter the Golden Towers to see the Most High upon his throne, performing the rites of audience as prescribed. The petitioner kneels and presents the memorial orally, visualizing the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants receiving it and submitting it to the throne. The Most High inscribes his assent, and auspicious light suffuses the talismanic decree. The petitioner then presents the decree, which is likewise bathed in auspicious light. The Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants transmits the memorial and proclaims the decree. The petitioner receives the rites, expresses gratitude, and exits the towers. They re-enter the Palace of Primordial Unity and Life to see the Celestial Emperor of the Azure Mystery. Bowing again, they kneel and present the decree, which is also suffused with auspicious light. The Perfected One Who Saves from Suffering, the Azure Mystery Divine Youths, and the Nine Dragon Envoys are summoned to the steps below. The decree is proclaimed and entrusted to the envoys. After the rites of farewell to the Perfected One, the Divine Youths, and the envoys, they exit the Palace of Primordial Unity and Life. At the gates of the Three Heavens, they retrieve the contract and, together with the attending spirits from earlier, traverse the Three Realms, cross the *Dingang* winds, and return to the altar. Rising, they announce their return. Without leaving their position, they proclaim the nine talismanic decrees of the Nine Dragons. Upon completion, the Dharma Master faces east, visualizing the Merciful Honored One of the Eastern Ultimate seated upon a nine-headed lion amidst a hundred treasures and auspicious clouds, flanked by Perfected Ones. They pour libations of wine and water to the ten directions, and auspicious light emanates from the banners above. The petitioner bows nine times, raises their left hand in salute, expresses gratitude to the ten directions, and returns the talismans to the incense burner. They then issue a preemptive announcement to hang the Heavenly Proclamation at the gate and return to the altar, signifying the Celestial Pardon of Suffering. This preemptive announcement to the ten directions halts the trials of the imprisoned, akin to the suspension of legal proceedings in the mortal realm.

**Memorial of the Plain Chariot and White Horse**
Within their sleeves, they carry the *Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms*. Transforming their spirit and stepping in flight, they visualize the subjugation of spirits as in the memorial rites. Arriving below the gates of the Three Heavens, they see the Heavenly Master reading the memorial and are led to the Golden Towers for audience. All follows the method of visualization. They visualize the perusal of the memorial and the inscription of assent, with the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants receiving it and passing it to the azure-waisted Jade Maidens of the Right Staircase Bureau. The proclamation is issued to the Heavenly Bureaus, summoning the Great General of the Plain Chariot and White Horse, accompanied by one hundred twenty officials, to the steps below. The petitioner presents the *Universal Proclamation to the Three Realms*. Visualizing the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants receiving and submitting it, the Most High peruses it and suffuses the proclamation with auspicious light. The Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants receives it and returns it to the petitioner. After expressing gratitude and taking leave, they exit together with the Great General of the Plain Chariot and White Horse and their retinue, returning to the altar as prescribed. Rising, they announce their return. Without leaving their position, they proclaim the proclamation and return to the altar, restoring the talismans to the incense burner.

**Memorial to Open the Paths of Karma in Fengdu**
Within their sleeves, they carry the *Fengdu Redemption Text* and the *Talismanic Decree of the Primordial Beginning for Pardon and Amnesty*. Stepping the *Dingang* and visualizing the subjugation of spirits as before, they arrive at the Golden Towers. The petitioner visualizes the audience and the inscription of assent. They present the proclamation and amnesty text, visualizing the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants submitting it to the throne. The Most High expresses approval and suffuses it with auspicious light. The Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants passes it down, and the petitioner receives it, expresses gratitude, and exits the towers. They proceed to the Supreme Mystery Capital, where the Four Ministers record the names at the street below. The petitioner receives the records and exits below the gates of the Three Heavens, retracing their path. Rising, they announce their return. Without leaving their position, they proclaim the *Talismanic Decree of the Primordial Beginning for Amnesty*, the *Fengdu Proclamation*, and the *Dragon Prayer*, expressing gratitude to the ten directions. They return to the altar and restore the talismans to the incense burner.

**Memorial to Open and Clear the Roads**
Within their sleeves, they carry the *Precious Proclamation of the Jade Emperor* and the *Decree to Restrain the Earthly Spirits*. Stepping the *Dingang* and visualizing the subjugation of spirits as before, they arrive at the steps below for audience. Visualizing the perusal and inscription of assent, the proclamation is issued to the official bureaus, summoning the Envoys of the Great One, the True Talismanic Couriers of the Five Thearchs, each bearing the *Talismanic Decree of the Great One*, the *Purple Yang Precious Staff*, and the *Five Directions’ Qi-Generating Spirit Talismans*. The petitioner kneels and presents the *Jade Emperor’s Proclamation* and the *Decree to the Earthly Spirits*. Visualizing the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants submitting it, the Most High suffuses it with auspicious light and issues it. After receiving it, the petitioner expresses gratitude and takes leave, exiting below the gates of the Three Heavens with the Envoys of the Great One and their retinue. Rising, they announce their return. Without leaving their position, they proclaim the proclamation, express gratitude to the ten directions, and return to the altar, restoring the talismans to the incense burner.

**Memorial for Bathing and Refinement**
Within their sleeves, they carry the *Proclamation for Refining the Form with Golden Fluid*, the *Thunder Script Proclamation*, and the *Precious Register for Ascending to Heaven*. Stepping the *Dingang* and visualizing the subjugation of spirits as prescribed, they arrive at the steps below for audience as in the rites. Visualizing the perusal and inscription of assent, the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants passes it to the officials of the day. The *Lady of Washing and Purification*, the *Five Directions’ Unclean-Dispelling Youths*, and the *Great Generals of the Left and Right Guards of the Cinnabar Heaven* are summoned, bearing a basket of *Eastern Well Yellow Flower Water*. The *Five Directions’ Youths* each gather the *qi* of the Five Spirits and proceed to the altar below for audience.

The officiant kneels to present the *proclamation and register*; the Jade Lad of the Immortal Attendants advances to submit them. Above, auspicious radiance is spread, and they are bestowed upon the officiant, who receives them with words of gratitude and withdraws from the palace gate. Proceeding to the Terrace of the Grand Mystery, he pays audience to the Four Ministers as prescribed, presenting the *Precious Register*. He visualizes the Four Ministers each inscribing their names beneath their titles. Taking leave of the Terrace and departing, he joins the officials and attendants who had been summoned, exiting below the Three Heavenly Gates. Returning along the route as prescribed to the altar, he rises and announces his presence, then returns to the altar to restore the officials to the furnace. The *proclamation and register* are left before the Supreme Emperor, awaiting the time of *refinement and deliverance* to memorialize and request their proclamation.

**Section on Memorials and Proclamations in Ritual Purification**

The Master said: The establishment of ritual purification is devoted primarily to the urgent task of written communications. Yet what is practiced in the world often varies—some elaborate, some concise—making it difficult to verify against ancient models. Thus, it is frequently left to scribes to compose as they see fit. As a result, errors and inversions abound beyond counting. They neither recognize the proper order of rank among the Three Realms’ courtly assemblies nor discern the jurisdictions of the offices concerned. Instead, they arbitrarily shift terms from one context to another, forcing mismatched phrases to fill the gaps. Such cases are too numerous to enumerate. Moreover, even a single mistake may implicate matters of sin and fortune. How can those who preside over the high rites fail to be cautious?

I have carefully examined the *Established Rites* compiled by the Jiang lineage, which include exemplary formats for memorials and proclamations. Yet their phrasing is often repetitive, rendering them overly verbose. If committed to writing for posterity, they would likely be set aside as too cumbersome. Therefore, I have streamlined them, consolidating the forms into a single section on memorials and proclamations for practical use. Where principle demands, I have not hesitated to simplify, setting aside mere ornamentation. Should a master of the craft, guided by the intent of the scriptural canons, compose texts to dispel confusion, this too would be a means of propagating the teaching. Additions or omissions may be made as deemed appropriate.

The Bureau, having received the petition and finding its plea irrefutable, shall reverently await the appointed time to submit the memorial in accordance with ritual protocol. On the [Day] of this month, we first raised the sacred banner to announce the intent of the fast to the heavens. Apart from the memorial already presented to the Celestial Court to request...

Upon receipt of the imperial decree, aside from first conducting the amnesty to deliver the recommended souls of the deceased, this document is hereby issued.

To the Jade Maidens and Golden Lads, the Divine Officials and Merit Registrars, the Immortal Officers and Generals, the Lower Yuan Yellow Register Court, the Nanchang Refinement-Receiving Bureau, all executive officers and ritual functionaries, the various bureaus, courts, and dharma departments, the divine soldiers, merit registrars, talisman emissaries—let it be known:

In accordance with the aforementioned matters, each shall lead their subordinates to assemble and station themselves. Summon the local Earth Gods, the Land Controllers, and the Deities of Destiny to expel in advance all demonic miasmas, purifying the precincts in preparation for the descent of the Imperial Perfected. Bear witness to the observance of the fast.

The Memorial Bureau and the household of the fast’s sponsor, along with all relevant affairs, shall be duly protected and guarded. Sever all obstructions from demonic forces. As for chickens, dogs, cats, rats, and all things rank with the stench of meat, fish, or foul odors, these must first be driven away, allowing no intrusion.

Matters of unforeseen fire or theft, as well as malicious gossip or slander, should any arise, must be vigilantly detected, ensuring that karmic retribution is made manifest. Thus, with inner and outer realms purified and solemn, all properly recommended souls of the deceased shall be permitted to return in advance to the fast’s dwelling, appearing in dreams to await the rites of deliverance.

The specific procedures for the altar’s opening shall be communicated separately. The prohibitions are not trivial—strict adherence is expected.

Respectfully submitted.

**Document Dated:** [Year] [Month] [Day]
**From:** Lingbao Great Ritual Bureau
**To:** The Altar Overseers

The Bureau, having received the petition and finding its plea irrefutable, shall reverently await the appointed time to submit the memorial in accordance with ritual protocol. On the [Day] of this month, we first raised the sacred banner to announce the intent of the fast to the heavens. Apart from the memorial already presented to the Celestial Court to request...

Upon receipt of the imperial decree, we must rely upon the majestic divine powers to oversee the altar, suppress demonic obstructions, sweep away defiling influences, and ensure the unimpeded completion of the fast’s affairs. This requires a formal directive.

Upon receipt of this document, you are commanded to deliberate upon its principles and dispatch the elite troops under your command to take up positions, joining with the attending officials, the local Controller of Destiny, the Earth God, and other deities who receive offerings at their temples. Together, you shall purify the space and expel malevolent forces in advance, awaiting the descent of the Imperial Perfected.

Moreover, as the fast being established bears no trivial significance, we specially invoke the majestic divine powers to enforce strict vigilance. The Bureau of Memorials and Edicts shall prepare the necessary documents, while the household of the fast’s sponsor shall make ready the ritual implements. Should any officiant act with negligence, or should any participant behave without benevolence—be it through the consumption of meat and wine, boisterous conduct, or the harboring of thieving intent—their transgressions shall be met with the full wrath of divine authority, and they shall be openly reprimanded and punished.

We further hope that you will guide the wandering souls and lead the lost spirits, so that they may await the rites of deliverance. Such ritual assemblies are rare, and among the unseen, there may be souls who remain trapped in darkness: those without descendants, those who died in foreign lands, those bound by unresolved grievances, or those who suffered unjust and untimely deaths. For all such cases, we rely upon your extensive search, compelling them to appear in the dreams of the living to report their names, so that they may be duly registered and submitted for universal deliverance. Thus may the merit of the fast be vast and all-encompassing, bringing blessings to both the hidden and the manifest.

This directive is issued for strict compliance.

Fire, theft, and all inauspicious events must likewise be preemptively prevented. Thus may demonic obstructions be averted and virtuous merit be fulfilled. Furthermore, ensure that the recommended departed souls, such as [Name] and others, are gathered in advance, their forms and appearances made manifest, to await the radiant arrival of the August Emperor and receive their deliverance.

Memorial of the Humble Official [Name], of such-and-such rank:

Whereas, in accordance with the petitioner’s intent and the circumstances of their rebirth, your servant, finding the plea irresistible, has already memorialized on such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month to implore imperial grace and pardon.

Now, in strict adherence to the ritual statutes, a mystic altar has been established. In due sequence, memorials and petitions shall be presented, talismans and pardons bestowed, audiences with the Perfected offered in repentance, hell-prisons shattered, and souls summoned—all to be performed without hindrance.

Upon completion of the rites, a memorial shall be submitted to report the merit, and the altar dissolved.

On such-and-such a night, a pure offering shall be arranged for the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Stations, in reverent gratitude for Heaven’s abundant grace.

Now, as the wondrous ordinances are first arrayed and the mystic canons are about to be enacted, all matters requiring action shall be executed in accordance with the prescribed forms. Apart from memorializing the Imperial Lords of the Myriad Heavens and submitting documents to the True Bureaus of the Three Realms, it is necessary to report as follows:

Your servant respectfully records this memorial and presents it to His August Majesty the Jade Purity Celestial Worthy of Original Commencement.

May the Dao’s compassion deign to approve your servant’s petition and specially command the Two Perfected Ones of the Left and Right to unseal the treasury and reveal the profound, bestowing the talismans, registers, and edicts of the Original Commencement’s host of Perfected Ones, that they may harmonize with your servant’s mortal writ.

May it be universally proclaimed to the Heavens and Earths, the courts of the living and the administrations of the dead, and all governing offices: that the deceased [Name] and the suffering souls of the Lower Prime, burdened by boundless transgressions, be delivered from the depths of darkness and permitted to ascend the jade altar, there to receive the rites of deliverance in person.

Your servant further petitions...

In accordance with the report from the Palace of the Same Day, which has been duly forwarded to the Bureau of Perfected Ones, this matter now requires submission for Your sagely hearing.

With reverence, this report is humbly presented before the sacred presence of the Three Mao Lords, Controllers of Destiny of the Nine Heavens. May Your sagely compassion deign to grant this earnest plea, issue the Imperial Edict, and universally proclaim it at the gates of darkness. May the sunken souls be liberated, all parted from the realms of suffering, and bathed in Your wise grace, attain rebirth in the realm of life.

In bold trespass upon Your sacred majesty, this humble petitioner prostrates in utmost trepidation and awe, duly presenting this report for Your sagely hearing.

[Date] [Petitioner’s Rank and Name]

**Unified Report to the Central Bureau**

[Petitioner’s Dharma Rank and Name],

In response to the matter of guiding the departed to the realm of life, as previously submitted, this petitioner, finding the plea irrepressible, on [date], had already petitioned the Three Heavens, beseeching mercy and pardon. Furthermore, on [date], a jade register of the names of the assembled departed souls was compiled and submitted to the Heavenly Bureau, imploring its promulgation.

Now, in accordance with the ritual statutes, a mystic altar has been established. Petitions and memorials are being presented in sequence, talismans and pardons are being sought, rites of repentance before the Perfected are conducted, prisons are being broken open to summon souls, universal night fasts are being held, alchemical refinement is being performed, registers are being bestowed and certificates distributed, and merits are being accumulated for transcendence and ascent. Upon completion of these rites, a memorial will be presented to report the merits, the altar will be dismantled, and the fast concluded. On the night of [date], a pure offering of three hundred and sixty divine positions will be arranged to reverently repay the grace of Heaven.

As the fast now approaches its appointed time, apart from further memorials to the Heavenly Court and reports to the Bureaus of the Three Realms, all matters requiring unified submission are as follows:

First, now that the mystic altar has been inaugurated and the wondrous rites initially arrayed, the departed souls must be summoned to receive deliverance. Yet it is feared that among them, some may bear deeply accumulated karmic burdens and remain unencompassed by the original pardon. Thus, it is again humbly beseeched that a memorial be presented to the Imperial Court, imploring a special amnesty. May the talismanic decrees of the Primordial Beginning and all Perfected Ones be proclaimed, harmonizing with the registers of mortals, and universally issued throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions—to the celestial prisons, earthly hells, the realms of intermittent and uninterrupted suffering, and all places where souls are bound in the records of myriad kalpas. May the boundless wisdom-light shine forth, piercing the layered darkness, and deliver all the assembled and recommended departed souls, whose names are recorded in the jade register, thoroughly rooting them out. Moreover, may all imprisoned and suffering souls, regardless of the depth of their retribution, whether their karma is yet to be resolved or already bound, be universally pardoned and personally come before the mystic altar to receive deliverance.

Second, henceforth, petitions will be presented in sequence to the Heavenly Officials for the deliverance of all souls. This petitioner, deeply mindful of his impure nature and the dullness of his qi, fears he cannot swiftly ascend to make his plea. Thus, it is humbly beseeched that the Imperial Edict be issued and proclaimed.

Third, to the Divine Officials under the Three Heavenly Gates who oversee memorials, together with all attendant transcendents and clerks: at the appointed time, may you descend in response to the summons, unite with the myriad spirits within this petitioner’s body, open the cloud-paths, and escort this mortal frame straight to the Heavenly Gates. There, as the memorial is presented and addressed, may all that is prayed for and requested swiftly be decreed and enacted.

Moreover, from the moment the altar is opened, it is humbly beseeched that an Imperial Edict be issued to notify the Divine Void Palace’s Celestial Immortals’ Inner Court, dispatching the officials of the Numinous Treasure, the Golden Lads and Jade Maidens, the Divine Officials and Merit Clerks, the messengers and functionaries, the soldiers and officers, as well as the officers and functionaries of the Southern Prosperity Refinement Bureau and the Yellow Register Court, along with all the celestial soldiers and horses and the marshals and generals of the various Dharma departments. May they all descend in unison, take their assigned posts, and manifestly assist in the proclamation and execution, fully adhering to the Dharma decrees.

Furthermore, regarding the departed souls now being delivered and all suffering spirits, it is deeply feared that among them, some may have borne various illnesses in life or died unnatural deaths, their ten aspects incomplete. Though they have been gathered before the altar, they may yet struggle to receive deliverance. Thus, it is humbly beseeched that an Imperial Edict be bestowed, dispatching officials from the Celestial Medical Institute to descend at the appointed time. May they each attend to their respective cases, administering treatment according to the symptoms, restoring wholeness to their forms, and enabling them to receive the merit of the ritual.

Moreover, among the assembled souls, some female ghosts may have perished in childbirth, and it is feared they remain bound in the Blood Lake, unable to escape. Thus, it is humbly beseeched that an Imperial Edict be proclaimed...

By Imperial Edict, the appointed officials shall proceed directly to the Iron Enclosure and the Boundless Blood Lake, where they must rigorously summon and gather these sunken souls, along with all ghosts imprisoned in hells who perished from blood-inflicted wounds. May they be fully released from their filthy dungeons and brought before the altar. Furthermore, it is humbly beseeched that the Bureau of Life and Birth be notified to dispatch the necessary officials and attendants, who shall descend with their numinous powers and infuse them with qi. May they sever karmic roots, untie entanglements, nurture form and generate spirit, bathe them in fragrant waters, and cleanse their corporeal impurities, that their countenances may be renewed, enabling them to attend the audience.

Moreover, at the appointed time of the universal and unobstructed nighttime ritual, it is humbly beseeched that an Imperial Edict be bestowed upon the Northern Dipper’s Benevolent Salvation Institute, dispatching the Vast Cosmic Great Brahmā Deva King and one hundred twenty spirit-transforming officials. May they ascend to receive the Jade Emperor’s Sweet Dew, transmuting and refining it into measureless food, filling the great thousandfold worlds to universally succor the hungry souls.

Furthermore, as the number of souls to be delivered is vast, and the Life-Giving Salvific True Talismans, Edicts of Absolution, and Registers of Pardon to be bestowed are numerous, they shall be printed in accordance with the ritual, with the participants of the ritual each inscribing them by hand. It is humbly beseeched that these be promulgated throughout the Three Realms for universal observance, ensuring that wherever they pass, none shall obstruct their reception of new life.

Moreover, as this ritual holds profound significance, it is feared that irregular rains may impede its solemn observance. Thus, it is humbly beseeched that an Imperial Edict be issued to the local City God and Earth Deity, the Thunder Department’s Abyssal Dragon Spirits, and the rulers of wind, rain, lightning, and hail throughout the Three Realms. From this day until the altar’s dispersal, may all impending winds and rains be temporarily suspended, that the Three Luminaries may hold their radiance, the Four Qi be serene and clear, and the Imperial Perfected Ones witness and behold the ritual’s proceedings.

Finally, when the altar is dispersed, in strict accordance with the ritual codes, the Mountain Tablet shall be reverently cast into the designated grotto-heaven, while the Earth Tablet shall be buried at the ritual site. Additionally, the Water Tablet shall be cast into the designated abyss, to redeem sins and record merit. It is humbly beseeched that these be memorialized to the Three Heavens, invoking their descent.

By imperial edict, let it be proclaimed to the sovereigns of the Upper Prime Heavenly Officials’ Celestial Palace Grotto-Heavens, the Middle Prime Earthly Bureau’s Nine Ramparts Earthly Sovereign Spirit-Officials, and the Lower Prime Watery Bureau’s various spirit-officials: in accordance with the Jade Tablets, on behalf of the departed souls, may sins be erased, grievances dissolved, merits tallied, and ascension to salvation be granted.

Furthermore, as all memorials, petitions, and documents herein submitted may risk omission or error, it is humbly beseeched that they be entrusted to the Bureau of the Direct Day for meticulous correction, that the responsible celestial clerks may present them in due time. May all prayers and requests herein be swiftly approved and enacted.

Respectfully submitted, this memorial is presented before the Jade Clarity’s Supreme Minister, the Great Peerless Divine Duke of the Highest Primordial; the Provincial Overseer of the Three Heavens, the Great Dharma Celestial Master of Orthodox Unity, the Perfected Lord of Serene Response; the Supreme Minister of Grand Mystery; the Supreme Minister of Heavenly Mechanism; the Inner Minister of Heavenly Mechanism; and the Left and Right Envoys of the Heavenly Pivot.

It is most earnestly implored that this be reviewed and transmitted to the Bureau of the Mysterious for this day, that all herein petitioned be implemented without exception.

[Your] humble servant, in profound awe of the sacred majesty, prostrates in utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted for your perusal.

To the Eastern Marchmount:

The undersigned [Name], holding this dharma rank, now reports on the matter of petitioning for the deliverance of the living and the dead, as previously intended. The weight of this plea is too pressing to suppress. I have already submitted successive memorials to the Celestial Court, beseeching grace and pardon. Furthermore, on the ___ day of this month, I submitted a register of the assembled departed souls to the Marchmount’s central offices, seeking their release and deliverance.

Now, in accordance with the ritual statutes, I have established the Mystic Altar, sequentially presented memorials and petitions, requested talismans and decrees of pardon, performed repentance before the Perfected, broken open the prisons to summon the souls, universally offered nighttime feasts, conducted the refinement rites, distributed certificates of lineage and deeds, and ensured their protection and promotion to higher realms. Upon completion of these rites, I will present a memorial reporting the merits accomplished and disperse the altar. On the night of the ___ day, I will hold a pure offering of three hundred and sixty divisions to reverently give thanks for the celestial grace.

Now, as the ritual approaches its appointed time, I am deeply concerned for the departed souls being delivered, for among them there may be those whose karmic retribution is not yet exhausted, who still remain bound in confinement. Apart from submitting another memorial to the Celestial Court and forwarding a petition to the true offices, it is now necessary to submit this report for Your hearing.

The right side respectfully presents this petition.

Before the August Presence of the Merciful and Sagely Emperor of the Eastern Peak, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Saint.

May Your Sagely Compassion deign to grant this humble petition, bestow a special sagely decree, and command the subordinate bureaus of this Sacred Peak to examine the previously submitted accounts in accordance with the reported matters. For any who have not yet been released, may You further issue orders to the earthly and aquatic offices, instructing all underworld tribunals to conduct a thorough investigation. Regardless of the depth of their transgressions or whether their cases have been adjudicated, may they universally receive the grace of amnesty and be delivered from the shadows of confinement.

Dispatch the divine officials of Mount Tai, together with the Divine Tiger Enforcing Officers, to lead the ritual assembly in awaiting the summons. At the altar, may they receive deliverance. May all imprisoned souls, suffering and dispirited, be gathered as one, simultaneously ferried across, and enabled to partake of Your sagely beneficence, attaining rebirth together.

At the appointed time, as the ritual of repentance and thanksgiving is performed, may the immortals and spirits descend, convey our sincerest pleas, and fulfill our devout prayers. On the designated day, as pure offerings are presented to the Underworld, we humbly beseech Your Sagely Presence to condescend and witness the covenant.

Presumptuously encroaching upon Your Sagely Might, I am overwhelmed with awe and trepidation. Respectfully, this petition is submitted for Your hearing.

This memorial is reverently presented.

**Section on Ritual Petitions and Memorials**
**Official Dispatch to the Metropolitan City God**

The Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites hereby dispatches this to the Office of the Metropolitan City God of All Under Heaven.

In accordance with the recent petition received concerning matters of life and destiny, this Bureau, finding the plea irrefutable, has already, on the [Day] of [Month], submitted an urgent memorial to the Celestial Court to implore **amnesty and absolution**. A copy of this dispatch has also been forwarded to your esteemed office for implementation as required.

Now, in strict adherence to ritual protocol, we establish the Mysterious Altar and proceed in due order with the presentation of memorials and petitions. We request the issuance of talismans and proclamations of pardon, offer repentance before the Perfected, conduct the breaking of hell-prisons and summoning of souls, universally bestow the Night Vigil Fast, perform the rites of refinement, distribute registers and certificates, and sponsor the promotion and transcendence of the worthy.

Upon completion of these rites, we shall present a memorial reporting the merit accrued, dissolve the altar, and conclude the proceedings. On the night of [Day], we shall reverently prepare a pure offering of three hundred and sixty divine stations to repay the **Vast Grace**.

[Further details submitted in memorial.]

Beyond the memorials submitted to the Celestial Court and the missives dispatched to the Bureau of Perfected Offices, it is necessary to issue this special directive once more.

Upon receipt of this document, we entreat you to carefully consider its contents and swiftly command the subordinate offices under your shrine to transmit this order to all circuits, commanderies, and counties, as well as to the temples of the City Gods and all relevant locales, including the prefectural and communal deities of the Nine Provinces. In strict accordance with the imperial edict, you shall release and dispatch the departed souls of men and women who have assembled to receive deliverance, along with the lonely spirits of the Six Paths, to come to the site of the fast, answer the summons, and ascend the altar to receive the grace of transcendence. Their merit shall be reported and rewards bestowed to requite their toil. The statutes and prohibitions are stringent—take care not to treat this matter with negligence.

Respectfully issued this day.

*Memorandum of the [Year] [Month] [Day]*
*Memorandum from the Supreme Numinous Treasure Ritual Bureau to the City God of [State Name]*

Whereas this Bureau has previously received a missive from the Metropolitan City God, which, beyond the memorials submitted to the Celestial Court, necessitates this special directive:

Upon receipt of this document, we entreat you to review the prior missive’s contents and swiftly transmit this order to all subordinate county City Gods and the duly enfeoffed deities under your jurisdiction, ensuring mutual notification.

Orthodox Unity Officials and Generals’ Comprehensive Petition:
The Orthodox Unity Great Dharma Bureau, in accordance with the aforementioned intent to repay the vast grace, hereby states:
Now that the mysterious altar is inaugurated and the wondrous model is to be presented, apart from the repeated memorials already submitted...

To the Celestial Court and all relevant true bureaus of the Three Realms, this comprehensive petition is hereby submitted for matters of utmost urgency concerning the established altar. Apart from the memorials already presented:

The establishment of the Mysterious Altar is governed by strict prohibitions. We respectfully request that the Lord Marshal of Numinous Treasure oversee all supervisory bureaus, ensuring that the heads and deputies of each office and hall be assigned duties according to their abilities. Let them execute their tasks with diligence—rewarding merit and reprimanding faults—so that all may strive together to assist in the ritual’s efficacy.

As the ritual now approaches its appointed time, the deceased souls must be summoned to receive deliverance. Yet we fear some may be burdened by grave transgressions, still bound in confinement, or held fast by malevolent forces, or entangled by karmic debts. We earnestly request that the Divine Tiger Enforcers and their attending officials conduct a thorough search, verifying names and locales to summon the true souls and proper spirits, escorting them to the altar to await invocation. Let them manifest beside the ritual banner and personally receive liberation.

All memorials presented henceforth, along with the petitions, prayers, and supplications to be offered after the altar’s inauguration—addressed to the Three Heavens, the Ten Heavens, the Five Emperors, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Maidens, and the attending divine officials—shall be entrusted to the Jade Maidens of Reception. Let them, along with the clerks and scribes of the Daily Audience Bureau, promptly review and verify each document for accuracy before swiftly conveying them to the Gate of the Three Heavens. As for the memorials and petitions to be submitted to the Three Realms, as well as the talismanic decrees of the Most High Perfected Ones, let the Four Duty Officers of Merit, the Direct Messengers of the Three Realms, and the rotating divine officials ensure their immediate transmission. The Wind-and-Fire Divine Couriers must remain vigilant, never delaying, and must stay at the altar to await further instructions, never departing without authorization. Upon any summons, they shall respond without delay, that the imperial grace may descend and all decrees be duly executed.

At the site of the altar’s establishment, we fear lingering residual qi from buried remains, or that the unenlightened may violate prohibitions—consuming meat and wine, or women with menstrual pollution trespassing sacred bounds. We request the Lord Marshal to remain vigilant, commanding the altar’s supervisory officials to enforce strict prohibitions in advance. Those who defy the law with reckless disregard shall be disciplined according to the statutes of the Perfected, to serve as a warning for the future.

Regarding all matters pertaining to the ritual’s arrangements—including the preparation of ritual implements, offerings, food, and delicacies—we fear that negligent attendants, or even unseen intrusions by chickens, dogs, cats, or rats, may cause disruptions, or that theft may occur. We urge the local earth gods and relevant deities to conduct regular inspections and preemptively remove such disturbances. Unforeseen incidents, especially fire hazards, must be strictly guarded against to ensure the ritual proceeds without obstruction, both within and without.

For all acts of devotion, supplication, repentance, and prayer, we request the Three and Five Officers of Merit, the Left and Right Divine Envoys, the Golden Lads of Incense, the Jade Maidens of Transmission, the Direct Messengers of the Five Emperors, the Daily Incense Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Divine Lords, and all relevant immortals to assemble and receive their duties. Let them respond to each invocation, dispel impurities, summon the true, convey incense and entreaties, so that the myriad spirits may gather and the suffering souls receive blessings.

For all departed souls, orphaned spirits, and suffering shades arriving from various locales, we request the strict supervision of the altar’s officials, along with the local temple deities, earth gods, and wardens of the Five Paths. Let them guide the attending divine officers to the Repository of Gathered Souls, where the overseer shall verify each name and categorize their status. Should any bear deep-seated grudges against the living—whether from past-life enmities, unpaid debts, or unresolved grievances—leading to disturbances, we request the Bureau’s Adjudicating Deities of Grievances to mediate and reconcile them, fostering repentance and letting go of past wrongs, that they may seek rebirth with single-minded devotion. During the general summons, let them proceed in order to the ritual feast to receive offerings and precepts.

Yet we fear these spirits, newly freed from confinement, may be ravenous and desperate, their numbers beyond measure like dust and sand, their ferocity like wolves and tigers, surging forth like torrents rushing into a gorge. All offerings of food, clothing, and wealth for the departed shall be entrusted to the Left Guard General of the Crimson Heaven, the Overseers of Netherworld Clothing and Food, the Great Deities of the Five Paths, the Four Spirit Lords, and all relevant divine officers. By the power of the Dao’s wisdom, may they...

By the boundless transforming grace of the Three Treasures’ luminous power, may their forms be clothed from heaven’s heights to earth’s depths, their bodies fully arrayed in raiment above and below, their withered bowels filled with jade nectar and precious viands. Let none dare oppress the weak with strength or overwhelm the few with numbers. Once they have received their sustenance, let them be gathered under their original divisions and assembled in the Repository of Gathered Souls. At the appointed time, summon them all to the altar to personally receive refinement and deliverance.

All transformed scriptures, paper money, talismans, and registers shall be reverently burned in due course, their ashes distributed evenly according to the records. Escort them in order to the Yellow Register Court and the Registers of Rebirth, where they shall be administered according to their rank and reborn without delay. Let none linger in delusion or recklessly harm the living. Thus shall the merit of the fast spread far and wide, its blessings rightly bestowed.

Yet in the establishment of a grand fast, many demonic spirits, envious of good karma, will recklessly create obstacles. We call upon the Jade Maidens Who Discern Demons, the Eight Might Commanders, the Intelligent Slayers of Ghosts, and the Chief Scribes of the Underworld to jointly examine and assemble the radiant hosts of celestial soldiers, driving away all hindrances. Should fierce gods or malevolent ghosts intercept memorials in midair, block the path of wandering souls, or seize the delivered spirits, we invoke the Lord of Myriad Spirits to spew venom and display might, slaughtering and dismembering the demonic hordes. Thus shall the Three Realms be purified, and all passage unimpeded.

On the evening of the concluding dispersal, in solemn accord with the Great Rite, perform the universal refinement and deliverance. Summon the officials and scribes of the Refinement and Transformation Bureau, together with the immortal youths of the Southern Court of Refinement, to invoke the true qi of yin and yang, drawing forth the two pools of water and fire. Through the ninefold refinement and the marvels of the Five Agents, escort the aforementioned wandering souls and orphaned spirits through the alchemical transformation. May their jade eyes take form, their yellow essence refine their shapes, their yang spirits coalesce, and their yin shadows dissolve, attaining the fruit of immortal transfiguration and bearing the merit of the Demon Kings’ protection. Guide them onto the Dharma Bridge, that they may ascend to the Crimson Mansion.

From the commencement of the rite to its conclusion, as the altar’s incense reaches heaven and memorials are presented, all unfolds beneath the Three Luminaries. Yet we fear the fickleness of wind and rain may disrupt the proceedings. We beseech the Marshal Commander, the Thunder Marshal, the Swift-Fire Deities Xin and Zhang, the Duke of Thunder, the Mother of Lightning, the Earl of Wind, the Master of Rain, and the city gods and village deities to notify in advance the dragon spirits of local pools and caverns, as well as the deities governing seasonal winds, thunder, clouds, and rain. On the appointed day, let the rains cease and skies clear, clouds disperse and shadows vanish, that heaven and humanity may commune in clarity, and the fast’s affairs be perfectly fulfilled.

Upon the dispersal of the altar, we reverently conduct the jiao rites to offer thanks for Heaven’s grace. We beseech the Marshal Commander to oversee the divine couriers and messengers of the day, the Direct Attendants and Envoys, to ascend in invocation of the Perfected Ones of the Celestial Heavens and descend in summons to the deities of the Three Realms—both nether and yang—along with all the assembled sages, that they may descend together upon the jiao banquet at the appointed time.

At this hour, we first dispatch the ceremonial guards and hosts to solemnly array the immortal processions, spread celestial blossoms in the four directions, and intone the Brahmanic chants, reverently welcoming the Imperial Chariot, that merit may be perfected and virtue accomplished, and that the living and the dead alike may receive grace.

The affairs of this altar are exceedingly intricate; though we briefly outline their essentials, their subtleties cannot be fully expounded. Yet by grasping the great principles, all details become clear; by demonstrating the main points, the minor nodes are illuminated. We adhere strictly to ancient canons and act in accordance with established practice.

The memorial is set forth as above. We humbly beseech that the Imperial Decree be upheld above and the sincerity of the fast be discerned below, that all may jointly advance the benevolence of salvation and together glorify the teachings of the Mysterious Origin. May hidden merits flourish and immortal ranks ascend in exaltation. Let these commands be executed without fail, and let none grow remiss. Respectfully memorialized.

Should any bear the thirty-six forms of fatal injury or the eighteen categories of violent death, we beseech the revelation of the Supreme Mystery’s secret formulas, employing the divine medicines of Great Purity to prepare and administer remedies tailored to each affliction. For those slain by royal decree, warfare, or self-inflicted wounds, restore their severed heads and whole bodies.

For those afflicted by abscesses or festering sores, regrow their flesh. For the pregnant, separate mother and child. For those who miscarried, sever the residual bonds of congealed blood, clearing obstructions and resolving conflicts.

For the pregnant, may their fetal qi be made whole; for those who miscarried, may their blood and menses be restored; for those whose labor failed to separate mother and child, may the passage be opened; for those whose afterbirths remained unexpelled, may the residual bonds be severed.

Should there arise defilements from the slaughter and excess of living beings, the miasmic qi of corpses and lurking demonic influences, the mingled impurities of humans and the mundane world, or the polluting contact of birds and beasts—then let the water of true essence be employed to purify both within and without. As for the practitioners who ascend the altar and the attendants who perform the rites, may they all bathe body and mind, that all may be rendered immaculate. Thus may the altar precincts be made pure and luminous, and the focused intention find resonance and communion.

May their hun-souls and spirits become crystalline and transparent, their nature and consciousness perfectly lucid, that they may attain audience and receive the grace of transformation.

We humbly beseech your illumination and swift compliance. Respectfully submitted.

This office, having reviewed the submitted petition as before, now offers gratitude for the vast grace bestowed.

As the Mystic Altar is first opened and the wondrous rites are about to commence, we reflect with solemn concern upon the Nine Dark Realms of the Northern Capital—where the depths are impenetrable, the iron cities unyielding, and liberation not easily proclaimed. We reverently recall that the One Hundred and Twenty Youths of Supreme Mystery and True Unity have pledged profound vows, wielding boundless Dharma-power, and since time immemorial have universally delivered all beings.

In accordance with the sacred talismans transmitted and bestowed by the Heavenly Worthies of Salvation from the Ten Directions, these youths are entrusted with the matching seals, authorized to unite them and shatter the gates of the hidden prisons. Of the Ten Heavenly Talismans of Mystic Transformation issued, one half is to be distributed; dispatch them at the appointed time and in the prescribed manner. This urgent directive is hereby issued.

We humbly beseech your tireless compassion, with deliverance as your foremost duty. On the [Day] of this month at [Hour], respond to the summons and arrive promptly, wielding the precious staves of the Various Heavens. Hold fast to the talismans, unite them in accord, break open the heavy barriers of the Nine Prisons, manifest the celestial grace, and illuminate the guilty spirits.

We earnestly hope for your compliance and swift execution.

Respectfully submitted.

**Memorial to the Local Deity Overseeing the Altar**
From the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites.

Memorial to the Local Lord of [Name] Domain.

This bureau is to conduct, on the ___ day of the ___ month, an Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Offering of [number] days and nights for the patron [Name], to summon and console the souls of the deceased [Names]. We have prepared a memorial for your esteemed bureau’s attention. Now that the ritual approaches its appointed time, we fear that the ignorant may transgress the altar’s prohibitions.

We humbly recall that the Lord of [Name] Domain has long displayed merit beneath the azure heavens, receiving offerings in this land. Your heroic virtue shakes the earth, and your vast kindness nourishes the people. Ever wise and ever discerning, none fail to revere and admire you.

We beseech your divine assistance to grace and protect the ritual proceedings. This memorial is hereby issued.

We request that you marshal your troops, array your armor, spur your steeds, and guard the roads. Proceed to the jade steps to halt your chariot, stand beneath the oil-canopied banner to issue commands. Unfurl your qi-flame to guard and stabilize the altar grounds, illuminate the hidden and subtle to detect and expel defilement. Banish all persons, creatures, and livestock that may cause offense. Drive away the lingering dead, malevolent qi, and any impure influences from meat or wine. Let your majesty blaze forth in great severity. Prevent fire, theft, and all inauspicious events with strict prohibitions.

Scatter celestial incense to blanket the earth, and invite the imperial carriage to descend to the hall. Guide the wandering souls and suppress the restless shades. Take charge of all matters, ensuring full compliance with the ritual protocols. Bestow your favor from beginning to end, universally benefiting both the hidden and manifest realms.

May you propagate the great teaching and be rewarded for your merit. We await the fulfillment of this grace and shall not forget to offer our parting tributes.

Respectfully memorialized.

Memorial issued on the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

**Memorial for Borrowing Land to Construct the Altar and Break Ground**
From the Bureau of the Numinous Treasure Great Rites.

Memorial to the Earth Mansion’s Grand Year-Star Sovereign,
The Five Earths’ Venerable Deities,
The Four Numinous Deities,
and the Hundred Deities of Prohibitions.

This bureau now petitions on behalf of the patron [Name], who seeks to conduct, on the ___ day of the ___ month, an Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Offering to summon and console the souls of the deceased [Names], that they may ascend to the immortal realms. The matter has already been memorialized to the celestial court. We humbly pray...

May the grace of deliverance be bestowed. As the day of the ritual fast approaches and the liturgical procedures are to be performed, we seek to borrow the central vacant land to erect the Mystic Altar, where the Imperial Perfected Ones shall be reverently received and solemnly served. This requires a formal petition.

We humbly memorialize, beseeching that the deities above may acknowledge the merit of the fast and temporarily withdraw from their positions: the Azure Dragon to depart eastward, the Vermilion Bird to soar southward, the White Tiger to proceed westward, the Dark Warrior to retreat northward, and the Hook Star to recede from the center. Let all baleful influences be deeply concealed, and may the myriad deities, in their hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands, each withdraw twenty-five paces. Above, let the bounds reach beyond the Three Heavens; below, let them extend through the Nine Ramparts. The altar shall be demarcated in the eight directions, rising in three tiers, mirroring the vastness of the Pure Capital. May the Jade Chariot descend to attend, and in accordance with the Yellow Register’s scriptural ordinances, may the souls of the departed be delivered from the gates of the underworld.

Should there be lingering corpse qi or unruly demonic influences that violate the sacred prohibitions, let them be seized and brought beneath the Northern Dipper’s pivot. Upon the completion of this rite, the land shall be restored to its original governance, and all shall resume their duties as before, dwelling in peace without disturbance.

Respectfully memorialized.
Memorial issued on the ___ day of the ___ month of the ___ year.

**Memorial for Dismantling the Altar and Restoring the Earth**
From the Altar of the Unsurpassed Yellow Register Grand Offering.

Memorial to the Earth Mansion.

As previously stated, this altar was erected for the ritual master [Name] to perform the rites of deliverance for the deceased [Names], in strict accordance with the liturgical forms. The land was borrowed to construct the altar, where the primordial powers were invoked and the affairs of the ritual conducted. Now that the rites have been fully performed and the offerings dispersed, it is fitting to summon and reassemble the myriad deities of the central palace, restoring them to the Earth Mansion. This requires a formal petition.

We humbly memorialize, beseeching that all deities, in accordance with the Mystic Ordinances, return to their rightful positions. Let the Nine Palaces remain ever tranquil in their yellow, black, azure, and green hues; let the Eight Trigrams be firmly established in the east, west, south, and north. May all be restored to perfect equilibrium, with no unevenness or subsidence remaining.

May the departed souls, having received deliverance, forever escape the gates of the underworld. May the patron of the rite receive blessings, their merit inscribed upon the earthen tablets. May heaven and humanity alike rejoice, and may all living things, both moving and still, find peace. We humbly pray for your acknowledgment.

Respectfully memorialized.

On the ___ day of the ___ month, a petition is filed.

**Petition for Purification by Commanded Water**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Rite:

This altar, reverently following the Mystic Ordinances, has established the grand rite. Yet we remain concerned that this realm of dust and defilement may harbor noxious and foul qi. Now, by the power of sword and water, we purify the altar grounds. A petition is hereby required.

To the right, we petition the Purification Officers and Soldiers of the Five Directions, the Gate Guardians of the Four Quarters, the Great Spirits of the Eight Trigrams, the Four Numinous Lords, the Earth Deity of the Altar, and all defensive deities:

Reverently receiving the Celestial Decree, assemble at the Mystic Altar. Summon the heavenly hosts and broadly enact divine transformation. Command the Five Dragons to spray water, stirring the turbid and lifting the pure. Order the Nine Phoenixes to bear talismans, dispelling miasma and cleansing filth. Transform this realm of dust and mundanity into a dwelling of clarity and purity. Within and without, let all be solemn and reverent, with heaven and humanity gathered in harmony. Any demonic or spectral beings that arise shall be seized and delivered to the Dipper’s Might. Thus shall all be fittingly attended to, and the hidden shall receive grace.

This petition is filed in accordance with the *Nüqing Statutes* and shall be executed accordingly.

Respectfully petitioned.

**Petition to Dispel Adversity**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Rite:

Petition to the Great General Who Dispels Adversity:

This altar, reverently following the Precious Ordinances, has proclaimed and performed the Jade Rites. First, the golden bell was sounded to open the Yang paths. A petition is hereby required.

We petition that you descend to the Mystic Precinct, revolve the Primordial Qi of Heaven, and strike the great bell with resounding force, harmonizing the ninefold Yang tones. Whether hidden or manifest, wondrously unfold the light of the Three Luminaries. Let the sincerity of the rite silently reach the unseen, and the Mystic Net be raised. Respectfully petitioned.

On the ___ day of the ___ month, a petition is filed.

**Petition to Restrain the Altar**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Rite:

We petition that you subtly spread divine transformation, opening the earth’s expanse. Let the resonance of the Sanskrit chants intermingle, summoning the wondrous qi of profound Yin. Let the Primordial Yang be perfectly attuned, discerning the precelestial of the Great Ultimate. Let the sacred and the ordinary dwell together, and wind and cloud rejoice in their assembly. Respectfully petitioned.

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Rite:

Now, in accordance with the decree issued by the Terrace of Supreme Mystery...

**Memorandum of Pardon Proclamation**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Rite:

A memorandum is addressed to the Day-Duty Merit Clerk, the Earth Dao Clerk, and the Land Spirits along the route to Mount Tai.

Now, in accordance with the decree issued by the Three Heavens Gate, a writ of general pardon has been received. The Terrace of Supreme Mystery has further transmitted a pardon decree and edict, to be proclaimed to the Lords of Dao of the Ten Directions of Mount Dongyue and Fengdu, as well as to all realms of the Thousand Dark Yin Hells.

It is petitioned that the transgressions of the departed, named herein, and the suffering souls of the Six Paths be absolved, that they may depart the gates of darkness, come to this altar, and receive deliverance. A special memorandum is thus required.

This memorandum is to be promptly received and carried forthwith to the Three Realms and the Ten Directions of the Boundless Worlds, that all governing authorities may be duly notified and the pardon’s grace universally enacted. No delay, obstruction, or loss along the courier’s route shall be tolerated. Let it be executed in strict accordance with the statutes.

Memorandum issued.

Memorandum dated [Year] [Month] [Day].

**Memorandum for Breaking Open the Hells**
(If using a joint memorandum, employ small script.)

From the Altar of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast.

To the Governors of the Nine Hells.

This altar, acting on behalf of the fast’s sponsor [Name], has reverently established the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast to commemorate the departed souls of [Name] and the suffering spirits of the Lower Prime, that they may together ascend to the Immortal Realm. Petitions have been repeatedly submitted to the Celestial Court, and deliverance shall proceed in accordance with the rites. The requisite joint talismans and memoranda have been dispatched in advance to the governors of each hell for their observance.

Now, as the summons is to be carried out, we fear the gates of darkness may yet remain unopened and the souls still detained. In reverent accordance with the True Talisman for Breaking Open the Hells from the Jade Clarity Precious Register, and with the descent of one hundred twenty Divine Lads of the Supreme Mystery, each bearing the treasures and joint talismans of the myriad heavens, we hereby issue this memorandum to open the dark prisons.

This memorandum commands compliance with the edict of the Jade Clarity, awaiting the arrival of the Divine Lads at each hell. The original talisman shall be matched without delay. Open the barriers and gates at once, and release the imprisoned souls in strict accordance with the decree.

Respectfully issued.
Memorandum dated [Year] [Month] [Day].

**Memorandum of Urgent Summons**

From the Altar of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast.

Upon review, this altar, on the [Day] of this month, acting for the fast’s sponsor [Name], has reverently established the Yellow Register Grand Fast to commemorate the departed souls of [Name], that they may together ascend to the Dao’s shore. Petitions have been repeatedly submitted to the Celestial Court to beseech deliverance, and memoranda have been prepared for the attending officials to first summon the aforementioned departed souls.

Now, as the summons proceeds, we remain concerned that the paths of darkness may yet prove perilous and the souls not promptly dispatched. This memorandum is thus issued to hasten and supervise the matter.

This memorandum commands the Divine Tiger Officers of Pursuit, the divine generals and officials of the Dharma Hosts, the functionaries of the ghostly and earthly paths, the local earth gods, and the honored deities of the Five Roads to swiftly prepare the way and directly traverse the paths of darkness. Urgently summon the departed souls of [Name] and the principal spirits of the assembled male and female kin, that they may appear in timely response to the spirit banner, manifest their forms, report for duty, proceed to the chamber for ablutions, enter the altar for audience, and personally receive deliverance. The courier’s route is strictly limited—no delays shall be permitted. Should any obstruction arise en route, seize the souls and deliver them to the nearest prison, in accordance with...

Whereas the above-named departed souls have already been summoned, yet we fear the perils of the dark paths may hinder their swift dispatch, this memorandum is hereby issued once more to hasten and supervise their progress.

This document commands the Divine Tiger Officers of the Three Divisions, the Pursuit Envoys of the Celestial, Earthly, Human, Immortal, Divine, Ghostly, and Karma Paths, the attending officials of the altar, the local City Gods and Earth Gods, the honored deities of the Five Roads, the Venerable Spirits of the Year Star, and the Six Jia Guides and Soul-Conducting Lads to immediately escort the aforementioned multitudes of the Six Paths—all sentient beings and ghostly hosts as numerous as the sands of the river—following the guidance of the spirit banner in orderly procession into the altar, that they may personally receive deliverance. Furthermore, let them be bound by divine authority, lest they stir wayward thoughts and disturb the living qi. Should any obstruction arise en route, enforce the celestial statutes without delay, and promptly await the manifest report.

Duly issued.

**Universal Summons to the Lonely Spirits of the Six Paths**
*Memorandum of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast Altar*

Upon review, on the [Day] of this month, on behalf of the fast sponsor [Name], this altar has solemnly established the Yellow Register Grand Fast to summon the souls of the departed [Name] and others, as well as the suffering spirits of the Lower Prime, to jointly accomplish the deliverance of all beings.

This altar has already submitted successive memorials to the Three Heavens, petitioning for the issuance of decrees to conduct deliverance in accordance with the rites. Tonight, an unimpeded nocturnal fast shall be universally bestowed, broadly aiding the hidden spirits of the Six Paths and the lonely, stagnant souls of the Nine Springs.

In addition to the prior memoranda dispatched to the Divine Might, commanding a thorough search, this document, in accordance with the statutes, now universally summons across the ten directions and the boundless expanse of the unseen realm, from ancient times to the present, all multitudes of the following:

- The Path of Celestial Immortals,

- The Path of Hell,
- The Path of Hungry Ghosts,
- The Path of Animals,

- The multitudes of wandering performers, idle hands, shamans, thieves, hired laborers, and those who died abroad,
- The multitudes struck by lightning, devoured by tigers, or swept and burned by water and fire,
- The multitudes who died by self-inflicted wounds, hanging, poisoning, abandonment, or unjust deaths,
- The multitudes who perished in epidemics, famines, or whose corpses lie exposed,
- The multitudes afflicted by parasitic worms, consumptive diseases, or seized by malevolent spirits,
- The multitudes of women who died in childbirth or miscarriage,
- The multitudes of the blind, deaf, mute, lame, crippled, paralyzed, or those who succumbed to chronic illness,

Dated [Year] [Month] [Day]. **Petition for the Transmutation of Spirit Garments**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Fast.

Upon review, this altar notes that on the [specific day] of this month, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor [Name], a Yellow Register Grand Fast was solemnly established to summon and mourn the departed souls of [Names], that they may ascend to the Immortal Realm.

The aforementioned souls have now been summoned to this altar and have undergone ritual purification. However, the spirit garments to be transmuted are so numerous that they risk being damaged or seized in transit. To ensure divine oversight, a special petition is hereby submitted.

To the **Custodian of Spirit Garments of the Yellow Register Institute**, the **Vigilant Deities of the Altar**, the **Local Earth Gods**, the **Deities of the Temple Precincts**, and the **Duty Officers of the Dharma Division**: you are commanded to personally supervise the burning and transformation. May the power of the Three Treasures gather and refine all, transmuting them into garments of a hundred hues like flowing clouds, radiant within and without. Verify the count and distribute them in proper order, ensuring none are lost or misappropriated.

Let no soul exploit their numbers to seize what is not theirs. The distribution must be thorough, so that all may be fully adorned, their inner and outer vestments resplendent. No omission or inequity shall hinder their reception of deliverance.

Upon receipt of this petition, act in accordance with the **Mysterious Statutes and Divine Mandates**.

Duly issued.

Dated [Year] [Month] [Day]. **Petition for the Refinement and Deliverance of Souls**

To the Supreme Altar of the Yellow Register Grand Fast.

On behalf of the fast’s officiant [Name], a **Yellow Register Grand Fast** has been solemnly established to summon and mourn the departed souls of [Names]. The ritual commands have been issued, and in accordance with the liturgical canons, the deliverance of souls has commenced. Now, in strict observance of the **ritual protocols**, the refinement of the departed souls is to proceed, invoking divine power to manifest its wondrous efficacy.

A memorial has already been presented to the **Celestial Emperors of the Myriad Heavens**, beseeching their descent—

Whereupon the grace and radiance descend, a special memorial is hereby issued.

To the **Divine Generals of the Southern Flourishing Refinement Bureau**, the **Left and Right Guard Generals of the Cinnabar Heaven**, the **Generals of Water and Fire**, the **Fire-Bell Generals**, the **Fire-Bell Lads**, the **Nine Radiance Lads**, the **Lads of Illumination**, the **Two Great Divine Generals of the Water Pool and Fire Marsh**, the **Lads of the Water and Fire Pools**, the **Great Divine Overseer of the Living**, the **Great Divine Dragons of the Ten Directions**, the **Great Divine Cinnabar Spirit**, the **Great Divine Luminous Splendor**, the **Great Divine Mysterious Glory**, the **Great Divine Refiner of Corpses**, the **Great Divine Restorer of Life**, the **Great Divine Gatherer of Forms**, the **Great Divine Overseer of Deliverance**, the **Great Divine Transformer of Passage**, the **Great Divine Gatherer of Soul-Fragments**, the **Great Divine Guide of Souls**, the **Great Divine Transmuter of Forms**, the **Great Divine Refiner and Deliverer**, the **Great Divine Liberator**, the **Great Divine Transformer of Bodies**, the **Great Divine Restorer of Appearance**, the **Great Divine Rectifier of Essence**, the **Great Divine Fire Mansion**, the **Great Divine Restorer of Form**, the **Great Divine Liberator of Transformation**, the **Lads of Refinement and Deliverance**, the **Twelve Great Generals of Primordial Qi of the Twelve Branches**, the **Immortal Officers of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generating Union**, the **Immortal Officers of the Southern Flourishing Upper Palace, the Vermilion Mound Fire Mansion, and the Southern Flourishing Pivot Mansion**, the **Officials and Lords of the Numinous Treasure Water and Fire Bureaus**, the **Maidens, Divine Soldiers, and Assemblies of Refinement and Deliverance**, the **Divine Officials of the Refinement Courts**, the **Merit-Officials, Couriers, Officers, and Soldiers**, and all the **Immortal Stewards**—may they, in their **divided numinous manifestations and responsive transformations**, descend in accordance with the command. Summoned—

The true essence of sun and moon, we beseech the correct qi of Heaven and Earth. To the left, the pool of refining and smelting; to the right, the streaming deluge of the abyss. Paired with Kan and Li, drawing forth lead and mercury, guiding the departed souls, nurturing withered bones. Let yin’s shadows melt away, let yang’s light penetrate through. Feeding upon the Five Sprouts to conceive brilliance, gathering the Nine Qi to generate spirit. The Infant suddenly sings—all return their numen through the Ten Revolutions. Subduing demons and safeguarding ascent, all ascend in rank to the Cinnabar Heavens. Daring to hope for compassion, may it deign to manifest response.

Respectfully submitted.

Year ___ Month ___ Day Petition.
**Petition of the Celestial Physicians of the Refinement and Deliverance**
**Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast Altar**

This altar, acting on behalf of the fast’s sponsor [Name], petitions to deliver the souls of the deceased [Names], having reverently established the **Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast**. The command has been received and issued, entreating grace for liberation, and the rites are now complete in full. Today, in strict accordance with the **Mysterious Statutes**, we humbly perform the Great Refinement. Yet we fear the dead souls bear afflictions, unable to undergo refinement without aid—thus we must rely upon the **Celestial Physicians** to command generation and transformation. Though talismans have been deployed and qi dispersed to restore their forms in accordance with the law, this matter requires a dedicated petition.

To the right, we petition:
The **Immortal Officers of the Celestial Physicians**, the **Divine Officials of Medicinal Application**, the **Merit-Officials of the Three and Five Healing Arts**, the **Grand Masters of the Celestial Physicians**, the **Officers of Acupuncture and Cautery**, the **Generals of Toxin Collection**, the **Officials and Assemblies Enforcing the Celestial Physicians’ Duties**, the **Merit-Officials of the Numinous Treasure Bureau for Form-Gathering**, the **Merit-Officials of Qi-Harmonizing**, the **Merit-Officials of Qi-Supplementing and Qi-Continuing**, the **Merit-Officials of Spirit-Gathering**, the **Merit-Officials of Whole Bones and Whole Forms**, the **Great Gods of Returned Form and Restored Countenance**, the **Merit-Officials of Birth and Production**, the **Merit-Officials of Dead Fetus Retrieval**, the **Merit-Officials of Dead Fetus Removal**, and all **Officials and Stewards in Attendance**—may they, in their **boundless virtue of cherishing life**, bestow benevolent salvation together. May they verify and examine the aforementioned souls to be delivered, those bound for liberation.

Should there be the thirty-six forms of fatal injury or the eighteen kinds of violent death, let each be assigned to its specialized bureau, first probing the root to exhaust the origin. Whether through moxa or acupuncture, talismans or medicines, respond to the signs and symptoms according to their depth, orchestrating the functions of sovereign, minister, assistant, and courier. Disperse the five numinous true qi, regulate the hundred passages, so that the myriad afflicted souls may dissolve their ailments. For those lost in childbirth, sever the root and untie the knot; for those mutilated, restore the head and make the form whole. Perfect the original true nature, return to the former countenance, relying on the firing and refining of Li and Kan to transform and transmute, verifying the wondrous union of form and spirit for ascension and promotion. Humbly we implore your compassion to condescend and shield them in deliverance.

Respectfully petitioned.

Petition dated: [Year] [Month] [Day]

Petition addressed to the Guardians of the Celestial Gates of the Three Realms.

One half of each tally is entrusted to the deceased [Names] for their possession, while the other half is sealed within a square casket, fully imprinted, and dispatched to the Celestial Gates of the Three Realms. We hereby request official notification, as this petition requires.

We petition for verification and handover to the appropriate authorities, that when the aforementioned deceased souls arrive bearing their half-tallies, the two halves may be examined and matched without delay, ensuring their timely deliverance. Thus shall the Demon Kings vouch for them, and the Celestial Gates admit them without hindrance.

This petition is issued in accordance with the Mysterious Statutes and Divine Ordinances. So be it.

**Petition for Alliance in the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast**

Herein recorded by Ning Quanzhen, the Illuminating and Salvific Perfected of the Cavernous Subtlety, High Adept of the Dao, transmitting to Wang Qizhen, Disciple of the Three Caverns of Supreme Purity and Successor of the Numinous Treasure Lineage:

**Section on Documents and Miscellaneous Uses**
*Alliance Petitions to be prepared in triplicate*

**Alliance in the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast**

Now, on behalf of the fast’s sponsor, [Name], who has reverently prepared the ritual offerings of the Dharma tally, we hereby invite a Daoist altar to perform the **Supreme Yellow Register Grand Fast** for three days and nights. Through this, we gather hidden blessings to universally deliver those sunk in darkness.

By the **Lower Prime Simplified Writs**, the ranks of the numinous immortals are ordained; by the **Cavernous Mystery Scriptures and Dharma**, the statutes for liberating the dead are expounded. The merit extends through humanity and heaven, the grace overflows to family and state. Thus, the **Grand Masters of the Supreme Ultimate** widely proclaim prohibitions and precepts, demonstrating solemnity in punishments and tallies, that all may discipline body and mind. The canonical models endure, unobscured through antiquity and present.

Now, the sponsor [Name], moved by karmic retribution and devoted in purpose, selects this propitious hour to establish this meritorious fruit. Thereby, emulating heaven and earth, we erect the altar and unfurl the registers, invoking the **Imperial Perfected of the Three Realms** and conducting the **Nine Audiences’ Rituals**. The **Mysterious Net** is thus raised, the **Subtle Pattern** fully arrayed.

Yet, considering the vastness of these affairs, we rely entirely on the collaborative efforts of all fasting participants. To commune with the numinous and attain the subtle, one must purify the self and fast the mind. Fasting the mind curbs the greed of mouth, taste, and nasal fragrance; purifying the self severs the attachments to sights, sounds, colors, and tones. Embracing spirit in stillness, the upright *qi* naturally clarifies; fixing thought without wavering, merit may be swiftly achieved.

Though my talents fall short of transcendent standards and my office is unworthy of its charge, I knock my head before the **Five Emperors** in sincerity and stand in oath before the **Three Officials**. We pledge to encourage one another, exhausting utmost reverence. Let our natures be as pure as ice, our minds as bright as the moon. In practice, we silently align with the **Ultimate Principle**, never straying from the **Mysterious Regulations** from beginning to end. Thus may our diligence magnify the teachings.

Should any transgress the statutes or violate the prohibitions, they shall be investigated and censured by the Dharma. Yet even this cannot suffice—such offenders shall seek their own punishment from heaven.

Now we request that the ranks of the Dharma assembly be recorded, and three copies of the joint covenant be made: one copy to be submitted to the **Five Emperors’ Court**, one to the **Three Officials’ Court**, and one to be retained in the **Supreme Mystery Capital**. These shall serve as solemn records of our alliance.

[Date] [Month] [Year] [Hour]

Following this, the ranks of the altar practitioners shall be listed below, along with the six offices.

Presented with utmost reverence before the **Five Venerable Sovereigns of the Five Directions**:
Submitted by [Name and Rank], your humble servant, sealed with respect.

Presented with utmost reverence before the **Three Primordials and Three Officials, August Emperors**:
Submitted by [Name and Rank], sealed with respect.

Presented with utmost reverence before the **Perfected Lords, Great Dharma Masters of the Three Heavens**:

The **Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast Altar**.
Now, on behalf of [Name], we reverently establish the **Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast**. We have gathered the present Dharma assembly to select this day, following the statutes in practice and offering devotion, and hereby appoint the following to their respective offices:

**Lector**, [Dharma Rank and Name].
**Fast Supervisor**, [Dharma Rank and Name].
**Scripture Attendant**, [Dharma Rank and Name].
**Incense Attendant**, [Dharma Rank and Name].
**Lamp Attendant**, [Dharma Rank and Name].

The above appointments are hereby recorded. Each shall diligently uphold their duties as stated.

[Year] [Month] [Day]
Submitted by the **High Merit Dharma Master** [Dharma Rank and Name].

**Memorial to the Ten Directions**
Your subject [Name and Rank], daring not to shrink from punishment, ventures to address the Celestial Hearing.

Yesterday, in accordance with the petition of the Fast Officer [Name], we sought to establish the **Supreme Yellow Register Great Fast** for five days and nights, beginning on the [Day] of this month, to supplicate for the deliverance of departed souls and the suffering spirits of the Lower Prime, that all may together attain rebirth in the Western Paradise.

Having already set forth the details in the memorial text, we now entreat for grace and liberation. Today, the Mystic Altar is inaugurated, the Dharma offerings arrayed in solemnity, the Celestial Writs unfolded, and the **Dao-qi** invoked. Reverently following the ritual statutes, we universally succor the living and the dead.

We humbly beseech the Celestial Compassion to deign to review this petition and command the **Celestial Ministry of the Supreme Mystery Capital** and the **Grotto-Sun Immortal Palace** to dispatch the **Lads Who Dissolve Grievances** and the **Divine Officers Who Pardon Sins**, that they may absolve the Fast’s sponsor of past transgressions and release the karmic retribution of the departed souls.

We further pray for the descent of the following to guard the Eastern Quarter:
The **Celestial Official of the Nine Qi of the East**,
The **Azure Numinous First Elder, Great General of the Grotto-Sun**,
The **Harmony and Peace Envoys**,
The **Supreme Yellow Celestial Perfected**,
The **Earth Spirit of the Wood Realm**—
all to assemble and descend, presiding over the Eastern Direction.

May the **August Thearch** descend with the True Writs to harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, open the paths of delusion, and guide wandering souls to enlightenment.

Purifying defilement and expelling demons, welcoming auspicious omens and gathering blessings, we await the completion of the Fast’s rites, that the Heavenly Scriptures may be restored. With reverence, we approach the sacred precinct, beseeching the True Response.

Your servant humbly presents this memorial in supplication, daring to offend the August Majesty, prostrate and awaiting Your decree with utmost devotion.

Respectfully submitted to the **Supreme Venerable of the Numinous Treasure, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Qi of the Eastern Infinite**, we await Your sagacious command.

Memorial of Reverent Supplication to the Ten Directions
Presented by Your subordinate, [Name], undeterred.

Memorial of Supplication for Merit and Pardon

Your subordinate humbly submits this petition to the Celestial Hearing, beseeching clemency. On the [day] of this month, I presented a memorial detailing how the Ritual Master [Name] solemnly conducted the **Supreme Yellow Register Great Offering**, to deliver the departed souls of [Name] and others, that they might together attain rebirth in the proper realm.

I strictly adhered to the ritual codes, reverently initiating the offering, reciting the true scriptures, harmonizing Heaven and Earth, and invoking the descent of officials and spirits to guard the altar. Through the encompassing grace of their protection, the ritual achieved its perfected fruition. Now, as the altar is dismantled and the assembly dispersed, I submit this report of merit, proffering this memorial in reverence, and offering gratitude in accordance with the directions.

I humbly implore Your Celestial Compassion to deign to review this petition, commanding the divine officials of this realm to descend from the **Divine Realm of the Supreme Ultimate**, elevating the departed souls and illuminating their virtuous reward. May blessings flow to the ritual’s sponsor and felicity extend to the state and household.

All the originally descended perfected immortals, in accordance with principle, should return to their origins. I beseech that their merits be calculated and rewarded, their ranks advanced, and their honors exalted.

Your subordinates, unenlightened in ritual methods and bound by established codes, humbly pray for leniency and exemption from severe punishment. May Your abundant grace be fully bestowed, completing the beneficence from beginning to end.

I respectfully present this memorial in supplication and gratitude, daring to offend Your Celestial Majesty. My trembling heart knows no bounds as I await Your judgment.

Respectfully submitted.

Before the August Presence of the Eastern Infinite Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy and the Nine Qi Heavenly Lords, I, your subordinate of such-and-such rank and surname, humbly await Your Sagely Decree. On the day of such-and-such month and year, I present this memorial.

The sacred ranks of the ten directions shift and transform according to their quarters. The memorial of gratitude is identical to the memorial of audience; both are respectfully submitted to the palace of such-and-such direction. I, your subordinate of such-and-such rank and surname, reverently seal this document anew.

Memorial to the Ten Directions’ Numinous Officials:
I, your subordinate of such-and-such rank and surname, having reviewed the petition previously submitted by the ritual master so-and-so, beseeching the deliverance of the departed souls of so-and-so and others through the solemn establishment of the Supreme Yellow Register Grand Ritual at such-and-such location to amass hidden merits for their transcendence, found the plea impossible to refuse. Having already memorialized the Celestial Court to implore Your grace for deliverance, I now, at the initial opening of the sacred altar and the revelation of the true scriptures, respectfully offer patterned silk of dragon-and-jade design, paper, brush, ink, and inkstone, distributing and consecrating them to each direction as tokens of sincerity and pledges to the perfected. To convey this devotion and supplicate divine response, it is necessary to present this memorial for Your august consideration.

To the right, beneath the vast expanse of Brahmā’s qi and the boundless realm of the nine heavens, lies the distant and desolate true capital, the towering homeland of the ten poles. Yearning for my crimson sincerity to ascend and be heard, I rely upon Your vast compassion to transmit and memorialize this plea.

Reverently considering the boundless worlds of the ten directions, the scriptures and treasures of the palaces of sun, moon, and stars, the watery domains of the Five Marchmounts, and the divine officials and immortals of the ten realms—may this memorial be transmitted before the sacred assembly. The True and Constant respond with goodness; their numinous transformations know no bounds. Ever delivering the dead to succor the living, they part their spirit to descend into the world.

May they deign to survey this rite of purification across its thresholds, heeding these earnest vows. Through ninefold memorials may faults be absolved, trusting in their compassion to pardon transgressions. For this single occasion of revealed affairs, may they grant the brush to record merit. Thus may grace bathe all, suffusing both the hidden and the manifest.

This humble servant’s heart brims with unbearable fervor. Respectfully this memorial is presented for august perusal.

The merits of the above are to be dedicated to the deliverance of the six paths and four births, the orphaned souls and lingering spirits, that each may depart from suffering and together attain rebirth and completion.

Thus, we humbly reflect: the supreme true teachings are the ladder between humanity and heaven; the titles of great compassion serve as the bridge between life and death. Their virtue is boundless, and their goodness knows no limit. We earnestly recall that the souls of the departed, such as [Name], have returned to the nine nights, their spirits obscured from the One True. Without the guidance to dispel their delusion, how may they escape their sunken state? We pray that the golden mouths may proclaim the wondrous teachings, that they may directly awaken to the subtle mysteries. May they suddenly perceive the clarity of the ice-pure vessel, forever free from defilement. As we open the treasure trove of scriptures, we first reveal our sincere devotion. We reverently beseech the penetrating gaze of the enlightened to grant our prayer for deliverance and cultivation.

The minister, overwhelmed with reverence and earnest longing as he gazes toward the celestial, prostrates himself in utmost devotion and respectfully presents this memorial for Your august hearing.

Memorial presented by the Preceptor of the Ritual Fast, Minister [Name], in his official capacity.

[External Enclosure:]
Memorial for the Opening of the Yellow Register Scripture, respectfully submitted to the Sagely Perfected and Sovereign Lords of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.
Sealed by the Preceptor of the Ritual Fast, Minister [Name], in his official capacity.

Comprehensive Memorial of Merit:
Minister [Name], Preceptor of the Ritual Fast, of [Place] in the Great Ming realm, humbly lays bare his sincere devotion and ventures to approach Your boundless creation.

The minister prostrates himself to declare the purpose of this fast and the ritual implements to be employed. A formal request has been submitted to the gate of [Name], beseeching the attendance of a Daoist master to conduct a single altar. On the ___ day of the ___ month, at [Location], a grand and supreme Yellow Register Fast of three days and nights shall be solemnly established. Upon its completion and dispersal, a thanksgiving purification rite of three hundred and sixty divine positions shall be held, relying upon the grace of the Dao to universally deliver the departed souls, broadly aiding those sunk in darkness, that all may together attain rebirth in the proper realm.

Now that the present offering has been made and the primary cause has been harmoniously fulfilled, all the reverent offerings and dedicatory scriptures, along with the sagely titles for the deliverance of the departed, are enumerated and respectfully presented below.

First, a Daoist master is invited to recite [Name of Scripture].
Each item shall be listed in full detail, following the format of the Opening Scripture Memorial.

Prostrating, we reflect that the sacred texts, stored in fragrant bamboo cases and jade boxes, hold the profound mysteries of the Dao’s subtle essence. Inscribed in golden characters upon jade tablets, they proclaim the rites of liberation and salvation. Without scripture, nothing is accomplished; with karmic affinity, all may encounter the Way. We humbly recall that the departed [Name] and our ancestors, kin by blood and marriage, whether manifest or hidden, have wandered far along the dark paths of the unseen realm, where the way to awakening is difficult to find. Longing for liberation yet finding no means, they have drifted away and cannot return. Thus, we solemnly convene this ritual fast, gathering hidden merit in the hope of relying upon the true vehicle to open the gates of wisdom.

We humbly pray that the radiance of Your grace may illumine all, unfolding the clarity of the jeweled mirror. May the shores of the Dao extend broadly, and the realms enter the splendor of the celestial vessel. May all sentient beings be equally saved, and the dharma-realm universally aided.

The minister, overwhelmed with reverence as he gazes toward the celestial...
