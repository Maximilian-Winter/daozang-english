### *The Jade Talisman of the Dragon’s Flight with White Feathers and Black Pinions*

On the first day of the second month, the *jiazi* day of the inaugural year of the Supreme August One, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao convened an oath in the Heaven of Infinite Measure and transmitted it to the Perfected Duke of the Northern Culmen. At that moment, the Nine Heavens’ Celestial Thearchs, lofty immortals, and great sages all attended the oath-ground. The Five Emperors girded their sashes; the ten thousand spirits stood in attendance; the sun and moon emitted their radiance; the Five Lodges arrayed their essences; the Seven Primes opened the gates; the Yellow Path ceased its motion; heaven and earth stilled their jade pivots; the Three Realms grew solemn and pure. Crimson auroras trailed in their wake, and purple clouds soared on all sides. The time was harmonious, the day auspicious, and the Eight Effulgences spread forth in display.

Beneath the dawn of the brocade silk, the Lord imparted the esoteric writ within the sealed mouth. His utterance echoed through the Nine Heavens, and the hidden name was proclaimed to the Celestial Thearchs with joy. The Perfected of Heaven bowed their heads; the Demon Kings restrained their forms. They safeguarded the Mysterious Void and ascended to the Jade Purity.

The Five Elders were commanded to oversee the trial; the Four Offices assisted the Perfected. The attendant immortals of left and right were summoned to witness the oath and invoke the spirits. Following the protocol of reverent posture, they faced north and intoned:

*"The cold flight ascends the arena; the Supreme Mandate summons the Nine Numinous Ones. The revolutions shift and turn; the sun and moon never cease. At this auspicious dawn, bare your true heart and dissolve your form. Clasp the blade in the Southern Palace; inhale the cinnabar in the Cold Court. Golden rams and silver geese offer homage to the Supreme Purity. Tear the silk to divide heaven; swear the oath upon the scripture. Entreat the Four Poles—may ten thousand kalpas pass as one. Whoever betrays my words shall incur the calamity of the Seven Mysteries. Whoever violates my oath shall be examined and their form extinguished. Life and death shall disavow responsibility; the Nine Darks shall be sealed forever."*

When the rite was complete, the silk was torn to transmit the scripture, and the esoteric words were orally imparted. The Perfected of Heaven descended; the Five Emperors guarded the spirits. The Nine Dawns bestowed nine hundred Golden Dawn Jade Lads; the Nine August Ones bestowed seven hundred Jade Flower Maidens. The Five August Ones further granted five hundred Jade Maidens of the Five Emperors each.

The Five Elders commanded their chariots; the Four Offices brandished their banners. Purple clouds flew as carriages; twelve jade wheels led the way. Phoenix songs preceded them; the Mysterious Chime followed. The Six Masters cleared the path; nine dragons flanked the axle. Thus they welcomed the Perfected Duke to ascend the Northern Dawn Palace of Jade Purity. They feasted among the Seven Primes, circled the Five Lodges, traversed the Celestial Passes, and attained the rank of Supreme Immortal, governing the Northern Culmen’s Palace of Vast Numinosity.

By the inaugural year of the *Kaihuang* era, the text was transmitted to the Great Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad, to be passed down once every ten thousand kalpas in accordance with the protocol.

The Dao of the Dragon’s Flight on Plain Silk originates from the Celestial Thearch of the Nine Heavens. It bears the names of the Nine Dawns and Five Stars that uphold heaven and earth, along with the exalted, precious, and esoteric numinous sounds—hence its oath-text. Unless one has, in a former life, reversed the entries in the Mysterious Register and inscribed their name in the Supreme Purity, destined to become a Perfected One, they may not so much as glance at its passages or fathom its hidden sounds.

Whoever beholds this text shall attain immortality in life or death. Whoever cultivates its Dao shall radiate divine light, summoning the descent of emperors and thearchs. After seven years of seclusion, they shall transform in a hundred ways, traversing the netherdark and floating through the Nine Empyreans. In fourteen years, they shall ascend at dawn in broad daylight to the Jade Purity.

Even without a lineage or scripture, merely paying homage to the divine Perfected shall confer longevity, extending life without end. A thousand calamities shall not approach; ten thousand misfortunes shall not strike. Warfare and disaster shall be eradicated; all endeavors shall prosper. In their comings and goings, the Nine Stars shall cast their shade; a halo shall crown their head. The Five Emperors shall provide guard; wherever they dwell, the spirits shall receive and attend them. Thus shall they serve the Sagely Lord in the Palace of Supreme Purity.

This Dao was born with the Primordial Beginning. The Primordial August One of the Nine Heavens transmitted it to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Lord of the Dao transmitted it to the Golden Porte Emperor of Later Sages, the Supreme Thearch, the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity, and the Perfected Duke of the Northern Culmen, who entrusted it to the Great Lord of the Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad. In accordance with the protocol, it is transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas to those of later generations who attain the Dao.

The method of transmission requires the recipient to follow the regulations: present ninety feet of crimson-patterned silk and fifty feet each of five-colored patterned silk to a master who possesses the scripture. After a hundred-day retreat—or seventy days, or seven days—erect an altar on a secluded peak in a tranquil place, inscribe the text, and face north to divide the oath and transmit the esoteric writ.

Offer five taels of golden rams to the Five Stars and nine taels of silver geese to the Nine Dawns. These two offerings are made to heaven upon receiving the scripture, demonstrating reverence to the master. At the *zi* hour, expose the altar to the open air. Use a crimson-patterned cloth to summon the ram to the east and a white-patterned cloth to summon the goose to the west. Swear the oath to the Nine Heavens, divide the silk in half, and orally transmit the secret names.

At the moment of transmission, follow the same prayer protocol as above. This may be called the precious Dao of the honored Perfected, the oath against divulgence. To transmit without an oath is to invite the annihilation of both master and disciple, with their seven ancestors held accountable and never absolved for ten thousand kalpas. This is the prohibition of High Heaven—all should examine it carefully.

At the time of the oath, the disciple holds the ram and goose, faces north, and bows nine times. Then, they bow once to each of the five directions, beginning in the west and concluding in the south before returning to the west to prostrate. They place the ram and goose to the left and right of the master, who stands in the center, faces north, and clicks their teeth nine times, declaring:

*"I, the Perfected One of [such-and-such] Peak, [so-and-so], dare, at this auspicious time of triple convergence, ascend the imperial altar in the open air, bare my true heart, and purify myself in retreat to entreat blessings. I array the oath before High Heaven, praying that the Most Exalted will cast their radiance and regard me, [so-and-so]. The Northern Thearch has recommended me, the Master of [such-and-such] Peak, [so-and-so], to eternally perfect the true Dao in this life, sparing me the wheel of rebirth. May the grace of the Nine Heavens flow without end; may my former name remain unbroken. May the Mysterious Register bestow its mandate, allowing me to behold the cavernous chapters with my eyes and chant the Imperial Unity with my mouth. I covet the divine immortals and aspire to the numinous covenant. I pray that in the midst of [such-and-such] Heaven, I may be granted the writ of feathered ascent and the esoteric writ of flight through the void. I supplicate the myriad emperors, the utmost Primordial August One, the lofty immortals, the great sages, and the Lord of the Infinite Dao. May they deign to turn their radiance and oversee this oath with compassion. May the qi of the true immortals of the Jade Purity’s Supreme Palace replenish my body. I invoke the Five Emperors, the Five Peaks, the ten thousand spirits, and the great deities of rivers and seas to jointly witness this oath-text. I entreat that my petition be fulfilled and the transmission proceed in accordance with the protocol."*

The left half of the silk scroll shall be made from three feet of white silk, upon which this text is inscribed, with one half on the leftmost foot and the two halves joined by a central talisman. The recipient shall inscribe their taboo name in purple ink, and the text and talisman in vermilion. The master’s taboo name having been invoked, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens shall attend the recipient’s person in full. The central talisman is then split in two, each half to be worn on the body: men take the left, women the right. A cinnabar brocade pouch shall hold the text over the heart.

Beware lest one trespass against the cycles of life and death, thrice violate the celestial lodges and cause their collapse, or move the Five Elders to weeping. Should the soul’s essence scatter and the spirit’s numen flee, death shall come within the year. Yet should one observe the prohibitions of the Nine Heavens with reverence, the celestial numina shall cast their radiance, divine perfected ones descend, and the body be born into water and fire, all transformations following of their own accord.

*The Supreme Record of the Flying Feathers Scripture and Ascending the Mysterious*

At the dawn of the Primordial August One’s reign, on the third day of the third month, the Primordial Beginning suddenly summoned the numinous and sent down a carriage drawn by white simurghs, black-plumed phoenixes bearing in their beaks a silk scroll—the *Flying Feathers Scripture* and the *True Formula for Treading the Void in Flight*. Jade essences and flying immortals guided the mist, while hosts of spirits guarded the numen. Obscuring the Nine Empyreans above, they blazed forth in the courtyard of the Jade Void, descending before the Supreme Perfected One to transmit the sacred scripture.

On that day, as the Supreme Perfected Master was concluding his fast in the Upper Clarity, the Celestial Thearch, the Three Primordial Ladies of Purple Tenuity, the Heavenly Thearch, the Celestial Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity, and the August Guests of the Lofty Jade Emperor all descended together. They burned incense of a hundred harmonies, while the five-colored divine officials floated in their jade seats, arrayed within the Purple Palace. The assembled perfected ones paid homage to the scripture, circumambulating thrice. The Three Primordial Ladies rose, facing west, and intoned in resonant, mysterious tones the *Feathered Hymn of Celebrating the Perfected*, in praise of the divine scripture:

*"Mists gather in the Pavilion of the Great Void,
A numinous wind scatters rare fragrance.
Soughing, the mysterious radiance ascends,
A gentle breeze wings the sun.
White simurghs swiftly fly, phoenixes in flight,
Bearing in their beaks the divine feathered scroll.
Fluttering, they shake the Nine Empyreans,
Their mournful cries illumine the mysterious beams.
The wondrous formula takes flight through the void,
The pure governance of the Dao knows no end.
The host of perfected ones join in celebration,
Bowing their heads to the Jade Emperor."*

When the hymn concluded, the Celestial Thearch rose, facing north, and intoned:

*"The mysterious phoenix swiftly soars on cloud-wings,
The white simurgh delights in lingering.
Flying fragrance blends with blossoming splendor,
Flowing radiance gleams on the cloud thoroughfares.
Mighty dragons rein in long traces,
Flying immortals support one another.
The myriad perfected ones rejoice in this auspicious fortune,
Delighting as the phoenix soars through the empty midst.
The Primordial Beginning leaves no trace,
Yet the mysterious resonance seeks itself.
Fluttering feathers need no chariot,
Drifting, drifting, they ride the mist and float.
The treasure scroll weaves the mysterious and firm,
The five bodies bear the numinous talismans.
Celebrating, they guard the courtyard of blessings,
Circumambulating with incense, each thrice."*

When he finished, the Heavenly Thearch rose, facing east, and declared:

*"White feathers speckle the mysterious wings,
Riding the floating, falling with the turning cycles.
Flowing fragrance overflows the Ten Heavens,
Lush mushrooms flourish in the Supreme Tenuity.
The numinous scroll reveals the hidden mechanism,
The Feathered Scripture illumines the mysterious radiance.
The supreme Dao is fundamentally without obscurity,
Holding to the true, the radiance flies of itself."*

When the recitations concluded, the Supreme Perfected Master donned his ritual robes, crowned with the Limitless Three Treasures Jade Crown of the Heaven of No Measure, and clad in the seamless, nine-colored *Flying Void Radiant Feathered Scripture* robe. At his left side hung a tinkling bell, and at his right, the Seven Primes. He prostrated himself facing due south.

The Celestial Thearch of the Supreme Tenuity rose and commanded the Feathered Immortal Attendant to lift the golden tablet and present the scripture. Facing north, the attendant knelt and offered it to the Supreme Perfected One, whereupon the assembled immortals all voiced their approval. The Supreme Perfected One stood to receive the scripture, his countenance emitting golden light, and from his five limbs arose the natural *Numinous Flying Jade Talismans*.

Ascending with the host of perfected ones, he boarded the carriage drawn by white simurghs and black-plumed phoenixes, feasting in the Eternal Yang. They journeyed east to the verdant forests and azure waters of the Nine Springs’ mouth at Fusang’s ruins; west to the domains of the Mysterious Feathers and the Plain of White Wilderness by the banks of the Meng Ford; south to the Crimson Mound, the essence of extreme flame, and the cities of the Southern Summer; north to the Dark Yin’s Cavernous Mysterious Hall and the lands of frigid waters; and at the center, they circled the Ten Absolute Peaks of the Yellow Qi and the Yang Essence, the Supreme Mysterious Jade Capital, the Golden Terrace and Jade Chambers, the Cinnabar Jade Palace. They roamed the Ten Heavens, the Eight Domains, and the Caverns of Clarity. Governing the countless perfected ones, they were bound to no heaven, no hidden realm, no qi, no immortal—universally commanding the host of spirits. From the Heavenly Thearch downward, none failed to model their virtue upon the Supreme Perfected One or revere the *Feathered Scripture*.

Thereupon, the Thearchs each returned to their mysterious palaces. After seven thousand kalpas, the scripture was transmitted to the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao.

The *Upper Numinous Flying Jade Talisman* and the *Natural Formula of the Feathered Immortals of Mysterious Perfection*, when worn for seven years, enable one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the Seven Primes. Those who cultivate the *Feathered Scripture* and the *Way of Treading the Void in Flight* cannot ascend the mysterious without this talisman.

The recipient shall pledge ninety feet of azure brocade to the heavens. On the day one begins cultivation, inscribe the left palm, and one shall grasp the azure radiance and take flight. Inscribe nine inches of azure silk and wear it on the left side; the Six Jias and Twelve Spirits, along with twelve Jade Maidens, shall attend on the left.

The *Lower Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*, the *Mysterious Jade Formula of the Primordial Beginning’s Feathered Essence*, when worn for nine years, enables one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the Five Stars. Those who practice the *Way of Treading the Void and Ascending the Mysterious* cannot traverse the void without this talisman.

The recipient shall pledge sixty feet of undyed brocade to the heavens. On the day one begins cultivation, inscribe the right palm, and one shall grasp the numinous white radiance and take flight. Inscribe nine inches of white silk and wear it on the right side; the Six Jias and Twelve Spirits, along with twelve Jade Maidens of Numinous Flight, shall attend on the right.

The *Left Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*, the *Mysterious Qi’s Primordial White Feathered Essence*, when worn for nine years, enables one to ride the void and fly, ascending to the Five Stars. Those who practice the *Way of Treading the Void and Ascending the Mysterious* cannot traverse the clouds to ascend the Mysterious without this talisman.

The recipient shall pledge eighty feet of cinnabar brocade to the heavens. On the day one begins cultivation, inscribe the sole of the left foot, and one shall tread the void and take flight. Inscribe nine inches of crimson silk and wear it on the [left] side; the Six Jias and Twelve Spirits, along with twelve Jade Maidens of Numinous Flight, shall attend before.

The *Right Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*, the *Primordial Qi’s Ascending Mysterious Feathered Essence*, when worn for nine years, enables one to ride the clouds and walk the Jade Clarity. Those who practice the *Way of Treading the Void and Ascending the Mysterious* cannot tread the Seven Primes nor ascend the void without this talisman.

The recipient shall pledge fifty feet of dark brocade to the heavens. On the day one begins cultivation, inscribe the sole of the right foot, and one shall tread the Mysterious and take flight. Inscribe nine inches of black silk and wear it on the [right] side; the Six Jias and Twelve Spirits, along with twelve Jade Maidens of Numinous Flight, shall attend behind.

The *Supreme Numinous Flying Jade Talisman*, the *Yang Qi’s Yellow Essence Flying Feathered Essence*, when worn for nine years, enables one’s face to radiate golden light, to sit and vanish at will, and to fly through the Great Void. Those who practice the *Way of Treading the Void and Ascending the Mysterious* cannot ascend the August Pole nor transcend the Nine Mysteries without this talisman.

The recipient shall pledge twelve feet of yellow brocade to the heavens. On the day one begins cultivation, inscribe the talisman upon the heart, and one shall exhale qi to form clouds and ride them in flight. Inscribe nine inches of yellow silk and wear it on the left side; the Six Jias and Twelve Spirits, along with twelve Jade Maidens of Numinous Flight, shall attend the body.

For all who cultivate and visualize the Way of the Seven Stars, upon entering the chamber, one must first ingest the five talismans before inscribing them. Both the inscribing and ingestion shall face east; knock the teeth twelve times and recite the incantation while looking upward:

*"Mysterious Void and Purple Clarity,
Flying Feathered Scripture,
Above illumining clouds and radiance,
Below commanding a thousand numina,
Controlling the Six Jias,
Moving my form,
Treading the Prime of Heaven,
Ascending the essence of the Dipper,
Congealing the hun and solidifying the po,
Filling the inner self to abundance,
Exiting the void and entering the Mysterious,
Ever abiding with qi."*

Upon completion, ingest the talisman, inscribe the five centers, and then proceed. After nine years of such practice, one shall attain the ability to ride the void and command the clouds, flying through the Great Clarity.

The *Left and Right Numinous Flying Jade Talismans* emerge from the qi of the natural, bestowed by the Supreme Perfected to tread the void and ascend the heavens, to rise to the Pole and tread the Firmament, to traverse the Seven Mysteries, and to ascend the Way of Jade Clarity. They complete the *Flying Feathered Scripture*; those who obtain them become divine immortals, those who wear them become perfected beings, and those who cultivate them shall be welcomed by the chariot of the white simurgh and the black-winged phoenix, ascending to the Jade Palace to wander and feast in the Eternal Yang.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao transmitted these to the Supreme Primordial Lord of Grand Simplicity and the Celestial Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. When the Way is accomplished through practice, they are concealed within the Numinous Capital of the Most High. According to the regulations, they are transmitted once every three thousand years; they must not be lightly divulged. To reveal them to the celestial perfected is to violate the covenant and break the oath, subjecting oneself to servitude among the ghostly officials, bringing calamity upon the nine ancestors, and confining them in the Dark Springs.

All preceding talismans are to be inscribed in vermilion.

Here ends the *Esoteric Instructions of the Nine Measures of Dragon Flight from the Cavernous Perfection of the Highest Clarity*.
