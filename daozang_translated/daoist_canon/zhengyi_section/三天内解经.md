**Scroll One of The Inner Explication of the Three Heavens**
Compiled by Xu, Disciple of the Three Heavens

Man’s bodily form is endowed from above by Heaven and modeled below upon Earth. The sun and moon possess the division of darkness and light; cold and heat bear the qi of generation and destruction; thunder and lightning have their cycles of emergence and withdrawal; wind and rain observe the rhythms of movement and stillness. Man possesses the substance of the worthy and the foolish, the nature of good and evil, the qi of hardness and softness, the destiny of long life and early death, the stations of nobility and baseness, the order of honor and humility, the signs of fortune and misfortune, and the appointed times of success and failure.

Without man, Heaven and Earth cannot be established; without Heaven and Earth, man cannot come into being. If Heaven and Earth lacked man, it would be as though the spirit were absent from the human abdomen—form could not stand. If there were spirit without form, the spirit would have no master. Thus, what establishes them is Heaven, and what sets them in motion is the Dao.

Man’s nature, destiny, and spirit are identical, merging into one. Thus, Heaven, Earth, and Man—the Three Powers—complete virtue and serve as the origin of the myriad things. Heaven cannot but nurture life; Earth cannot but grow things; man cannot but refine qi to nurture life.

If Heaven deviates from the Primordial Mystery, there arise the calamities of solar and lunar eclipses. If Earth strays from the Yellow Skirt, there arise the disasters of wind and quaking. If man turns away from the Supreme Dao, there arise the harms of withering and decay.

Essential qi floats above while the multitude of essences flow below; above and below interpenetrate, their mutual resonance following one another. When human affairs are disordered below, calamities respond above by cutting short destiny: the sun and moon suffer eclipses, the stars and constellations fall into disarray—all arising from human affairs being improper, thus bringing about these transformations.

In this late age, the people’s years and destinies are cut short, their corpses strewn like refuse, their lifespans unfulfilled. All this stems from losing the root of cultivation: marriages between unsuitable types, chaotic intermingling of qi, belief in the false and abandonment of the true, the fundamental Dao gone astray, the multitude of fools in confusion, none knowing the source of their misfortune.

Some boil and slaughter the six livestock, praying to emptiness; they chant, sing, drum, and dance, seeking wine and meat. Seeking life, they meet death—such is the work of heterodox ways. Scratching the foot when the head itches, their actions do not correspond. Their prayers and supplications transgress proper bounds, leading to the destruction of their bodies and the premature end of their years and destinies—truly a cause for grief.

Now I have compiled *The Essential Explication of the Three Heavens* to instruct those who have not yet awakened. It must be guarded with care and kept secret; do not rashly transmit it. To transmit it to the unworthy brings calamity upon one’s descendants.

The origin of the Dao arises from what precedes the void. In the vast expanse of primordial chaos, it has no cause; it arises spontaneously from emptiness, transforming and generating all things.

The Venerable Person of Dao and Virtue was born before the primordial qi. He is the most exalted within the Dao, and thus is called the Venerable Person of Dao and Virtue. From this arose the Supreme Clarity, the Primordial Mystery, the Utmost Three Heavens, the Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable Person, the Heavenly Thearch, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Venerable Person of the Nine Qi, and the myriad layers of Dao-qi—one thousand two hundred official lords beneath the Jade Platform of Supreme Clarity. When people of this age address memorials to Supreme Clarity, they refer precisely to these Perfected Ones of the various heavens.

Thereafter, within the hidden and obscure, the Cavernous Void came into being. Within the Cavernous Void, the Great Non-Being arose. The Great Non-Being transformed into the mysterious qi, the primordial qi, and the initial qi. These three qi intermingled in chaos, mutually engendering, and gave birth to the Wondrous Jade Maiden. After the Jade Maiden was born, the chaotic qi congealed and transformed, giving birth to Laozi, who emerged from beneath the Jade Maiden’s left armpit. Born with white hair, he was thus called Laozi. Laozi is Lord Lao.

Transforming and becoming qi, he brought forth Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings. Thus, he revolves and transforms, refining his form and qi. Lord Lao dispersed the primordial qi of the Primordial Mystery. Undifferentiated, chaotic, like the yolk within an egg, it then separated: the mysterious qi, pure and refined, ascended to become Heaven; the initial qi, thick and turbid, congealed below to become Earth; the primordial qi, light and subtle, flowed through to become water. The sun, moon, stars, and constellations were arrayed therein.

Lord Lao, by means of the harmonious qi, transformed and established nine lands, placing nine persons—three men and six women. By the time of Fuxi and Nüwa, they each created names, and from this issued the Three Teachings to instruct the people of Heaven. The Central Kingdom, where yang qi is pure and upright, was made to uphold the Great Dao of Non-Action. The eighty-one domains of the outer barbarian lands, where yin qi is strong and flourishing, were made to uphold the Buddhist Dao, with strict prohibitions to restrain the yin qi. In the lands of Chu and Yue, where yin and yang qi are weak, they were made to uphold the Great Dao of Purity and Simplicity.

At this time, the governance of the Six Heavens flourished, and the Three Teachings spread. Lord Lao, appearing as thearch after thearch, served as the state preceptor. During Fuxi’s reign, he was called Master Yuhua; during Zhurong’s, Master Guangshou; during Shennong’s, Master Dacheng; during the Yellow Thearch’s, Master Guangcheng; during Zhuanxu’s, Master Chijing; during Emperor Ku’s, Master Lutuz; during Emperor Yao’s, he appeared again as Master Wucheng; during Emperor Shun’s, Master Yinshou; during Yu of Xia’s, Master Zhenxing; during Tang of Yin’s, Master Xize.

His transformations were without constancy. At times he was surnamed Li, named Hong, and styled Jiuyang; at others, named Dan, styled Boyang; or named Zhong, styled Boguang; or named Chong, styled Ziwen; or named Zhai, styled Bochang; or named Yuan, styled Boshi; or named Xian, styled Yuansheng; or named De, styled Bowen. Sometimes he changed nine times in a day, or twenty-four times; his myriad transformations followed the world’s vicissitudes, beyond enumeration.

By the time of King Wuding of Yin, he returned to the womb of Mother Li. Within the womb, he recited scriptures for eighty-one years, then emerged by splitting open her left armpit. Born with white hair, he was again called Laozi. The *Scripture of the Three Terraces* that people of this age possess is what Lord Lao recited within the womb.

His return to the womb of Mother Li was his own transformation of his empty, formless body into the form of Mother Li, then re-entering himself—it was not that there was an actual Mother Li.

The world does not understand and mistakenly claims that Laozi entrusted himself to the womb of Mother Li, but this is not the case. By the time of King You of Zhou, Laozi knew the Zhou dynasty’s fortune was waning. He let his hair loose, feigned madness, and departed from Zhou. Arriving at the pass, he rode in a carriage drawn by a blue ox and encountered Yin Xi. He bestowed upon Xi the *Scripture of the Upper, Middle, and Lower* in one scroll, and the *Five Thousand Characters* in two scrolls, totaling three scrolls. Yin Xi received these texts, and through them, his Dao was perfected.

Perceiving that the barbarians of the western lands were fierce and difficult to transform, Laozi and Yin Xi traveled westward together into the kingdom of Jibin. There, Laozi’s divine transformations grew even more majestic, subduing the barbarian king and composing Buddhist scriptures of sixty-four myriad words. The king and his entire nation revered and served them. This kingdom lay forty thousand *li* from the land of Han. The people of Jibin all submitted to the Great Dharma.

Laozi then journeyed farther west into the kingdom of Tianzhu, another forty thousand *li* beyond Jibin. The king’s consort was named Qingmiao. As she napped during the day, Laozi commanded Yin Xi to ride a white elephant and transform into a yellow sparrow, flying into Qingmiao’s mouth like a shooting star. In the following year, on the eighth day of the fourth month, he emerged by splitting open her right side. Upon birth, he took seven steps, raised his right hand to point at the sky, and intoned:
*“Above heaven and below heaven, only I am revered.
The Three Realms are all suffering—what joy can there be?”*

At birth, he was already profoundly austere, instantly embodying the Buddha’s form. The Dao of the Buddha thus flourished anew in this land. In later ages, moral decay spread, and malevolent forces arose—libations and shamanic rites to ghosts proliferated, and truth and falsehood became indistinguishable.

The Most High, in Langye, entrusted the *Scripture of the Dao of Great Peace* to Gan Ji, Li Wei of Shu Commandery, and others, commanding them to assist the Six Heavens in rectifying perverse *qi*. Yet Wei and his followers failed to correct the *qi* of the Six Heavens. Instead, by the Han era, heterodox forces surged, the *qi* of the Six Heavens raged, the Three Paths intertwined, pestilential *qi* ran rampant, and physicians and shamans flourished. All abandoned truth for falsehood, indulging in music, dance, the slaughter of livestock, and libations to malevolent spirits. The people suffered untimely deaths, their corpses strewn like refuse.

The Most High dispatched Perfected Ones, Wang Fangping, and Dongfang Shuo to aid the Han dynasty, sending them to observe the land and assess the people’s condition. The Han emperor, however, dismissed them as bewitching deceivers. Thus, the Han house declined and collapsed, and Wang Mang seized power. The Han emperors of the Liu clan were descendants of dragon essence, heirs to the Great Sage’s legacy, destined to rule through twenty-four sovereigns over four hundred years. Yet their imperial line nearly severed, so the Most High ordained Guangwu’s restoration. The interruptions in their reign were all due to disbelief in truth, the lack of true support, and the ensuing chaos of malevolent spirits, which consigned them to the realm of ghostly officials.

Since the opening of heaven and earth, the border tribes—Qiang, Man, Rong, and Di—had served as the outer fence of the Central Kingdom. They married within their own kind, each adhering to their proper lineage, revering the Supreme Dao, and preserving their purity without admixture. But after Guangwu of Han,世俗 gradually declined, and humans and ghosts intermingled.

Guangwu’s son, Emperor Ming of Han, claimed to have dreamed of a towering figure, over ten *chi* tall, his body golden in hue. His ministers interpreted the dream as the true Buddha and dispatched envoys to the Western Regions to copy Buddhist scriptures. Temples, pagodas, and monasteries were built, and Buddhism spread throughout the Central Kingdom. The Three Paths intertwined, the people grew disordered, and internal and external realms mixed. Each faction held to its own preferences—some embraced falsehoods and abandoned truth, offering prayers and sacrifices to spirits. Human affairs below grew chaotic, while celestial *qi* above raged in turmoil, causing the heavens to grow murky and the people to lose their original purity.

During the reign of Emperor Shun of Han, the Most High selected envoys to rectify the governance of the Six Heavens, distinguishing truth from falsehood and manifesting the *qi* of the Upper Three Heavens. On the first day of the fifth month in the *renwu* year of the *Anyuan* era (142 CE), Lord Lao, in the stone chamber of Quting Mountain in Shu Commandery, prepared to ascend to the Great Governance of Kunlun with the Daoist Zhang Daoling. There, the Most High newly revealed himself, declaring that people feared malevolent spirits but not truth, and thus took the title of *Newly Revealed Lord Lao*. He appointed Zhang as the Master of the Great Mysterious Capital, the Orthodox Unity, and the Pacifier of *Qi* in the Three Heavens, entrusting him with the *Orthodox Unity Luminous Might Dao*, the statutes of the *Newly Revealed Lord Lao*, and the mandate to abolish the affairs of the Six Heavens and Three Paths. He rectified the Three Heavens, purged superficiality, restored simplicity, and returned to truth, transmitting the Most High’s true scriptures.

Zhang established regulations over sixteen years, and in the *dingyou* year of the *Yongshou* era (157 CE), he formed a covenant with the Han emperor and his ministers, using the blood of a white horse as an oath and inscribing a pledge on iron tablets. Together with the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, and the General of the Grand Year, they swore: to perpetually uphold the orthodox law of the Three Heavens and never oppress the people. The people were forbidden from recklessly worshipping other spirits, ensuring ghosts received no offerings, masters took no payment, and no one engaged in licentiousness or theft. Those treating illness were prohibited from consuming alcohol or meat. The people were permitted to worship their ancestral parents only on the five auspicious *La* days and to venerate the earth and stove gods in the second and eighth months. All practices outside the orthodox law of the Three Heavens and the true Dao of the Perfected Heavens were deemed residual *qi*.

For the sick, they were to confess their transgressions from the age of seven, when they gained understanding, and establish rituals, talismans, and protocols to heal chronic and severe illnesses beyond the reach of physicians. Recovery would follow upon repentance. Zhang established twenty-four governances, appointing male and female officials and libationers to oversee the orthodox law of the Three Heavens, converting the people and accepting households with five *dou* of rice as a token of faith. Within a hundred days, tens of thousands of households flocked like clouds. He composed myriad statutes, protocols, and documents, entrusting them to his descendants to transmit as state preceptors. Once the laws were set, humans and spirits grew tranquil. Zhang then ascended to heaven in broad daylight, personally receiving the title of Celestial Master.

The Celestial Master’s son, Zhang Heng, and grandson, Zhang Lu, along with his wife, all achieved liberation through *shijie* and ascended to heaven, thus establishing the Three Masters and the Lady. After their ascension, various libationers transmitted the Daoist teachings. Recipients were required to kneel to receive the scriptures and bow in reverence upon returning, ensuring adherence to the orthodox law of the Three Heavens. Yet many disregarded this, hastily obtaining a single scroll and claiming it as a Daoist scripture, passing it among themselves. Some were remnants of the Six Heavens’ affairs, leading to confusion. The longer such practices persisted, the harder it became to distinguish truth from falsehood.

The Celestial Master received the *Orthodox Unity Alliance Might Dao* and the orthodox law of the Three Heavens from the Most High, entrusting them to his descendants as state preceptors, meant to endure eternally—how could they be adulterated? Yet soon after, remnants of the Six Heavens’ affairs gradually intermingled. The lineage of masters weakened, the common people followed mixed practices, and libationers upheld disparate teachings, each claiming orthodoxy. How grievously mistaken!

Today, some follow the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice, others the Way of the Banner of Non-Action and Flowers, or the Buddhist Dao—all remnants of the Six Heavens’ affairs, long since abolished. There are also those who follow the Way of Pure Water, which is not orthodox. It is said that the Celestial Master had a servant illiterate in scripture, difficult to civilize. As the Celestial Master was to ascend to heaven, he pitied the servant’s devotion and commanded a well be dug for his use, to treat illness. The water was not to be used for washing or drinking. Those who used this well water to treat illness recovered without fail, their ailments cured instantly.

The servant later returned his form to the Great Yin, and the well water dried up. The Celestial Master had granted this water for the servant’s body, but later generations, failing to understand, transmitted it as a practice, calling it the Way of Pure Water. On days of clear brightness when seeking blessings, they had no Daoist halls, kitchen shelters, talismans, or rituals—only facing a jar of clear water to burn incense and bow in worship, claiming the Dao resided within the water. This was entirely mistaken.

Those who followed the Dao without offering the Five Pecks of Rice thereby departed from the Orthodox Unity and Alliance of the Three Heavens. The Five Pecks of Rice were rightly offered to the Five Thearchs, acknowledging the people’s desire to follow the Dao. The sage harmonizes with qi, beginning and ending without end, thus the sage does not die. Mortals harmonize their lives with rice; without grain, they would starve. What they treasure is offered to the hidden and obscure—not because the rice itself is needed.

Emperor Gao of Han was the son of dragon essence, rising from a minor clerk at Sishui Pavilion to ascend the imperial throne. By the reign of Emperor Wen, Laozi descended upon the River and was thus called the River Elder. Emperor Wen commanded his carriage to seek the Dao from him. Laozi bestowed the *Five Thousand Words on Virtue and the Dao* in its upper and lower chapters before departing.

Emperor Wu desired to learn the methods of the Supreme Dao for flying immortality, so the Most High sent Dongfang Shuo to assist in Han’s governance. Yet Emperor Wu, unaware that Shuo was a perfected person, treated him as an ordinary official, no different from commoners. The Queen Mother of the West and the Lady of the Upper Prime both descended in their chariots to Emperor Wu, wishing to perfect his Dao. But Emperor Wu failed to awaken, though he revered the numinous grace, casting aside filth and impurity. Clinging to worldly glory and ceaseless warfare, he accrued blood debts before the Three Offices, his unbound hair crying out in grievance to the ghostly officials. His passions unchecked, the Dao remained unfulfilled, and he returned his form to the Great Yin.

During the reign of Emperor Guangwu, as he contended with Wang Mang for rule, he faced peril at the Yellow River, his life hanging by a thread. The Most High manifested to aid Guangwu. In the scorching heat of the sixth month, the river waters froze, allowing his troops and horses to cross and escape disaster. The Han mandate was heaven-bestowed, as revealed in the charts: sweet dew descended in the courtyard, perfected beings arrived in their chariots, divine phoenixes came to roost, the sun’s shadow reversed twice, the three-legged crow in the sun and the nine-tailed fox appeared, numinous omens blazed forth, and a host of sages lent their wings—all signs of the Orthodox Dao’s assistance.

After Guangwu, the Han dynasty gradually declined. The Most High, pitying this, chose Zhang Daoling, a distant descendant of Zhang Liang, to manifest the Dao’s qi and aid the Han. He was made to establish the Great Law on Mount Mang north of Luoyang, and emperors, kings, ministers, and officials all submitted to his lineage. At that time, the Orthodox qi spread far and wide. Over the four hundred twenty-five years of the Han, from its early to later emperors, countless common people attained the Dao. The Han house grew arrogant and indolent, unable to ascend the Mystery, so the people achieved it instead.

The Celestial Master’s three generations of couples—six in all—served as the Three Masters’ task. The Mao brothers, three in number, served as the Controllers of Destiny. Among the scattered immortals like Wang Chang and Zhao Sheng, there were over a hundred, too many to name individually. The Liu lineage, endowed with the body of the Dao, was cut off and then renewed. Heaven bestowed its mandate as revealed in the charts: auspicious omens at the Central Marchmount, twenty-two jade disks, a cake of yellow gold to verify the imperial surname. The nine-tailed fox arrived, numinous treasures emerged, sweet dew descended in the courtyard, three-horned oxen appeared, six sacred bells took form, giant beasts and twin elephants came to roost among men, feeding on the spirits of the ancestral temple—all former practices were abolished. Governance was rectified by the Dao, old qi swept away. Was this not the trustworthiness of the Most High?

Emperor Liu of the Song was a scion of the Han, ever bound to the Dao in affinity. The Song state abounded in Daoists. Even in Han times, there were forerunners—scholars cannot afford to neglect this. The Three Ways share a root but branch differently: the Great Dao of Non-Action, the Great Dao of Purity and Simplicity, and the Buddhist Dao. These three are all the methods of the Most High Lord Lao, though their teachings differ, their ultimate return is to the True Dao.

Laozi presides over transformations of life, Śākyamuni over transformations of death. Thus Laozi emerged from his mother’s left armpit, governing the left, which pertains to yang qi and the Azure Palace’s Register of Life. Śākyamuni emerged from the right armpit, governing the right, which pertains to yin qi and the Black Record’s Register of Death. Hence Laozi’s and Śākyamuni’s teachings differ in their left and right methods. Left transformation follows the left office’s generative qi, enabling bodily ascent as flying immortals. Right transformation follows the right office’s mortal qi, enabling extinction and rebirth. Their dharma robes are entirely black, worn to model yin qi and enter the Black Record.

The Most High established these three teachings. Though their methods diverge, they ultimately return to the truth of the Dao, without difference. Yet humans receive primordial qi to form their bodies, only to undergo decay and receive yin transformation in the cycle of rebirth—this is inherently difficult. Though right transformation does not match the left office’s swift ease, its cyclical return to truth is also good. Thus it is said the right is not equal to the left.

The *Scripture* states: "The True Dao cherishes life and abhors killing." Longevity is the Dao; death and decay are not. A dead king is not even equal to a living mouse. Therefore the sage’s teachings urge compassion toward all living beings—life is precious. Those with minds should carefully study the *Five Thousand Words*. This scripture enables one to guard the Dao and abide forever, without birth or death. The Dao’s fundamental source lies in this scripture.

*Explication of the Three Heavens, Scroll the Upper Concluded*
*Explication of the Three Heavens, Scroll the Lower*
*Composed by Xu, Disciple of the Three Heavens*

Laozi’s teachings urge guarding the root and securing the foundation. All people are born from the Dao’s qi; losing the Dao’s qi means death. Thus he urges contemplating the true and meditating on the Dao, strengthening the root and foundation, not losing one’s source—then one may live forever without dying.

The *Scripture* says: "A hundred-foot tower begins with its foundation."

This is precisely what is meant. The Dao’s qi is most subtle—it cannot be seen, cannot be heard. Meet it and it has no front; pursue it and it has no rear. It encompasses the Six Directions, covers and bears Heaven and Earth. Its virtue is revered above the Highest Sovereign; its merit towers above the Two Modes. The divine and enlightened ruler who respects it gains fortune; who slights it meets misfortune.

Yet fortune does not come because the Dao aids one to obtain it, nor does misfortune come because the Dao strikes one to incur it. The Dao is without partiality—it merely accords with what one does. The retribution for good and evil responds like an echo: act evilly and evil comes; act auspiciously and good comes, following what one practices. If the Dao had preferences or could be possessed, those who attained it would then use it to elevate their parents above themselves, abandon their wives and children, and offer themselves entirely to their lords. But since this is impossible, the Dao resides within oneself, not in others.

The Dao is Nonbeing. All things arise from Nonbeing; what exists takes Nonbeing as its root. The *Scripture* says: "Nonbeing—one does not know whose child it is, yet we forcibly name it the Dao." What exists ultimately returns to Nonbeing. One who perceives Nonbeing forgets the self. To forget the self is to forget all things. To forget is not to love things. Having no love for things, one loves only Nonbeing. Nourishing perception with Nonbeing, one does not take the body as the body.

O my disciples, abiding between Being and Nonbeing, you will have no cares. What is called form without form, color without color, flavor without flavor, sound without sound—the Dao constantly abides in Nonbeing, yet people do not know it. Thus the *Scripture* of Lord Lao says: "The reason I have great trouble is that I have a body. If I had no body, what trouble would I have?" This is what is meant—profound indeed, complete!

Knowing the ancient beginning, returning to simplicity and reverting to the true, recovering the primordial Nonbeing of high antiquity, one merges with the Dao as one. Having form yet no substance, the Perfected Person can appear or vanish, moving with emptiness, casting no shadow at noon—all is having no body. When body and Nonbeing unite, there is no substance or shadow.

Thus the *Scripture* says: "Those who study the Dao have a household, a body, a mind. With these three, greed and desire are not extinguished, jealousy and harm are not removed. The divine Perfected soar high, thoughts cannot reach them, the myriad demons are not subdued. This is called having Being, never attaining Nonbeing; Nonbeing is not embraced. Serene and without action, without words or arguments, appearing dull or coarse, neither born nor dying, never returning—this is the wonder, profound indeed, complete!"

For those who study the Dao, nothing precedes purification. Externally, one does not stain with worldly dust; internally, the five viscera are clear and empty. Descending Perfected and summoning spirits, one dwells in union with the Dao. Those who cultivate long-term purification unite with the Dao’s Perfected and do not violate prohibitions. Thus the Celestial Master’s transmitted teaching says: "To study without practicing purification is like walking in darkness without holding a torch."

This purification should be the first step in studying the Dao. When one wishes to invoke the numinous and inform the unseen, establishing purification, one should first practice dispersal purification. One must eliminate stale food and foul odors, cleanse the body, and remove all defilement—only then may one enter purification. Otherwise, mere washing and bathing leaves filth within the flesh and bones, which water cannot remove.

Even in the ancestral sacrifices of the Tiantai Duke’s family and the worship at numinous shrines, dispersal purification is observed first—how much more so for those seeking the descent of the Perfected through the true Dao! Yet I often see today’s vulgar libationers wearing countless talismans and amulets, performing few prostrations and prayers. They claim to be adepts of the Great Dao, already Perfected Persons, unafraid of defilement. They further cite *Scripture* saying: "The true Dao has nothing to fear—entering fire, it is not burned; entering water, it is not chilled; entering filth, it is not defiled; entering weapons, it is not harmed." They believe themselves to have attained the true Dao—how laughable!

Not fearing defilement does not come from wearing many talismans to ward off impurity, but from the inner and outer truth of the body. Internally, without deviant thoughts, the divine Perfected are full; externally, without improper conduct, defilement cannot stain. Only thus can one be unafraid of great defilement. It is like uncarved wood: its substance is naturally empty, and when mud and dirt cling to it, the stain is hard to remove. But jade is true and solid—filth cannot taint it. The true and the untrue, their appropriateness in treading through defilement, are just like this.

Study has several levels. The study of the Great Vehicle should calm the mind and settle the heart, contemplate the true and focus on the mysterious. Externally, one appears empty; internally, like a fortress of gold. Incense communicates qi; the mouth forgets speech. With a mind of compassion for all beings, one first thinks of delivering others, then delivers oneself, all aiming for ascension to immortality. One does not think of wealth or money, turns the heart to reverence and gratitude, does not weary body or spirit, seeks the true within—only then does one penetrate the mysterious. Thoughts unite with the Dao, and there is no need for much exposition. One may be said to breathe with the Six Directions, to traverse what has never been heard.

The study of the Lesser Vehicle is not so. It takes many words as good, much activity as diligence. Heads knock together, harming body and spirit; words contend, inner thoughts are not focused. Pinching incense with three fingers, one makes countless petitions: seeking immortality and deliverance from the world, flight to the Upper Clarity; desiring high office and promotion, five horses drawing one’s carriage; wishing for flourishing generations, a thousand sons and ten thousand grandsons; hoping for abundant wealth, rows of servants and maidservants; longing to extend years and avoid calamity, great and small at peace; aspiring to manage business and trade, a myriad paths opening; yearning for an enlightened mind and awakened thoughts, sharp ears and bright eyes; wanting a hundred ghosts to flee far away, plague to pass by the gate; desiring a kind father and filial son, a loving husband and chaste wife; hoping to see clearly for ten thousand miles, to perceive the source of Heaven; wishing to leave wealth to descendants, friends rejoicing—

...wishing to contemplate the Real and invoke the Dao, jade maidens descending to one’s chamber. The desires sought are many, the pursuits sought are burdensome, failing to align with the Laozi’s source of guarding the One. The mouth grows weary from the words of petition, the form is worn by the toil of bowing and bending, the heart is exhausted by manifold desires, the spirit is wearied by constant coming and going.

The *Scripture* states: prolonged labor harms the spirit, prolonged speech harms the qi, prolonged walking harms the sinews, prolonged gazing harms the eyes, bearing heavy burdens harms the bones, excessive eating leads to illness, overthinking harms life—none of these accord with the methods of cultivating the body and nurturing nature. This is what is meant by: "Much brings confusion, little brings attainment."

The teachings of the Lesser Vehicle involve knocking the teeth in darkness to seek numinous response. This is merely a method of instruction, guiding people to cultivate goodness, eliminate transgressions, and reform faults—it is not the way to govern the body, extend years, prolong life, or attain flight and ascension. Thus, it is called the Lesser Vehicle.

As for śramaṇas and Daoist practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle, they sit in stillness and count their breaths, resuming only after ten cycles, continuing from year’s beginning to end without momentary lapse. The Buddha’s Dharma does not permit dwelling on the body’s spirits; thus, breath-counting is the task, to sever external thoughts.

Daoist practitioners of the Greater Vehicle constantly visualize the true spirits within the body—their forms, their raiment, their colors—guiding and leading them as if facing divine lords, without momentary interruption. Then external thoughts do not intrude, true spirits descend, and the heart is free of distractions.

Practitioners of the Lesser Vehicle, however, are entangled by a hundred affairs, or beset by myriad worries and external concerns. The paths of the Greater and Lesser Vehicles differ entirely, bearing no resemblance.

The Lesser Vehicle requires eloquence of speech to serve as a teacher for the world. The Greater Vehicle’s study of receiving qi and guarding the One is treasured as the body’s resource. The *Scripture* states: "The wise reckoner does not use counting rods; what they cultivate lies in the One. One who knows what is to be cultivated in the One completes all affairs—thus, counting rods are unnecessary."

Here ends the third scroll of the *Scripture* within the Three Heavens.
