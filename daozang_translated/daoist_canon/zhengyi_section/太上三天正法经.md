The Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning both emerged before the inception of the primordial *qi*, when the radiance of heaven had yet to brighten, its vapors still dense and turbid. The boundless darkness stretched without limit, the Great Void in chaos, its vast expanse surging through the obscurity for over seven thousand kalpas. Only then did the dark luminance first divide, and the nine *qi* take form. Each *qi* was separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety years—so declared the Lord of the Azure Lads: "At that time, there were no years or months. Once the nine *qi* existed, each was separated by ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety *li*, and one *li* was reckoned as one year."

The pure *qi* ascended and clarified, while the turbid settled below. The Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning, inheriting the natural lineage, were established with the titles of the Nine Heavens. Both were born within the nine *qi*, their forms coalescing from the congealing *qi*. The mysterious condensation of the nine *qi* gave rise to the Chart of the Nine Heavens. Thereupon, the sun, moon, and stars shone forth, all revolving within the bounds of the Nine Heavens.

Then appeared the Nine Perfected Emperors—so said the Lord of the Azure Lads: "The Nine Perfected are the pure *qi* of the Nine Heavens, condensed into the positions of the Nine Palaces." The Upper Perfected, Middle Perfected, and Lower Perfected were born in the Heaven of Supreme Clarity and Subtle Radiance, which is the clarification of the primordial *qi*. The next three Perfected were born in the Heaven of Yu Yu, which is the clarification of the original *qi*. The lower three Perfected were born in the Third Great Scarlet Heaven, which is the clarification of the mysterious *qi*.

Once the Three Titles were established, the Three Primordial Ladies were born from the *qi*, with Heaven as their father and *qi* as their mother, thus styled the Three Primordial Ladies of Grand Simplicity. Each was conceived naturally by the *qi*. All born of the Three Primordial Ladies were titled as women. The Lord of the Azure Lads said: "The White Primordial Lady is the mother of the Right White Primordial Lord; the Yellow Primordial Lady is the mother of the Yellow Elder Central Lord; the Purple Primordial Lady is the mother of the Left Peerless Lord." Their empty wombs took form, born by the power of *qi*. Each was assigned a palace, and thus were established the officials of the guard and service of Supreme Clarity. Three thousand Jade Lads of the Golden Dawn and three thousand Jade Maidens of the Western Florescence attended the Three Primordial Ladies in the Palace of the Grotto-Chamber.

The Three Ways flourished, and the title of the Most High Lord of the Great Dao was proclaimed. The Most High Lord of the Great Dao is the sovereign of all Perfected Ones, his position exalted and his *qi* pure, hence the title "Most High." All inherit the lineage of *qi* and receive their titles by rank—there was not originally a Most High in the primordial heavens. One who receives the title of Most High becomes the lord of the myriad spirits. Established in the Jade Palace and the Numinous Hall, he dwells as the Lord of the Great Dao, governing the Nine Heavens and presiding over the Eight Directions. The Eight Directions each have their Eight Emperors, thus in the Upper Three Heavens there are the Twenty-Four Emperors, the Lords of the Jade Sovereign. The Eight Emperors all receive the natural lineage and attain the title of Emperor—not a rank to be assumed by later students.

Thereupon, each drew upon their inheritance to compose the chapters of the Supreme August, forming them into precious scriptures. These were concealed in the Palace of Jade Clarity to transmit to later students who attain the Perfected. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, the people were established, for humanity arose with him. The Yellow Emperor molded earth into images and released them into the wilds. Over three hundred years, they underwent five-colored transformations, gaining speech and language, each dwelling in their own regions—hence the distinctions of the Qiang, Qin, Di, Yi, Man, and other tribes.

The Five Clans harmonized their virtue, following the natural pattern, inheriting the *qi* of the Upper Perfected to become human. They were subject to the cycles of life and death, the reckoning of lifespan. Those whose bones and *qi* were aligned with the Perfected became deathless and were promoted to Upper Immortals. Those of impure conduct returned to the earth in death. The foolish were born of the original *qi*, their robes and caps of five colors, all arising from the original *qi*, clad in garments of five hues.

The governance of the Six Heavens arose at this time. Thus, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao bestowed ghostly soldiers to drive out the wicked during the Three Dynasties. The Lord of the Azure Lads said: "When the Yellow Emperor established the people, they engaged in slaughter and harm, not following the natural pattern. This provoked the indignation of the celestial *qi*, causing the Three and Five to lose their proper order. Therefore, the *qi* of the Six Heavens was employed to punish and eliminate the wicked people."

Those who cultivate good conduct with diligence, aspire to longevity, and do not transgress against the Three Offices become the Seed People and are granted the Perfected Scriptures. The separation and union of the Two *Qi* govern the cycles of all things. The Nine Yangs disseminate *qi*, the Sixteen decide calamities, and the Three Ways wax and wane, revolving to generate life. The appointed time ends in the years of *renchen* and *guisi*. The Lord of the Azure Lads said: "The Great Nine Yangs and Great Sixteens each span nine thousand nine hundred years; the Lesser Nine Yangs and Lesser Sixteens each span three thousand three hundred years."

From the time the Six Heavens received their titles until the Zhou dynasty, three cycles of the Great Nine Yangs had already passed, yet good and evil had not yet been fully settled. Later, the Nine Mysteries Dao Lord inquired of the Most High regarding the unanswered period of the Six Heavens. The Most High replied: "The affairs of the Six Heavens rely on the Supreme Perfected. Seek the Nine Yangs and Sixteens of the Nine Scriptures, and return to govern the Three Heavens." Calculating the appointed time, it will conclude in the years of the Tang, when the Jin clan rules. At the end of the *dinghai* year and the *renchen* year, good and evil will be made clear, and fortune and misfortune fully determined.

The Nine Heavens Perfected King transmitted to the Most High Lord of the Great Dao the *True Writ of the Numinous Capital’s Winding Three Directions*, along with the various books of Perfected Registers, to establish the methods of the Six Heavens and the Three Heavens.

The Orthodox Methods of the Three Heavens were first bestowed upon the Nine Heavens Perfected King and the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning at the inception of their reception of qi, within the Void Mystery. The methods for establishing governance in the Six Heavens were later transmitted to the Most High. By the time the Yellow Emperor arose to rule, the Most High entrusted them to the Lord of Later Learners, the Ministerial Lord of the Azure Youth, and the Lord of Western Citadel, who in turn conferred them upon those who would become Perfected Ones. Through the qi of the Six Heavens, by means of the methods of the Three Heavens, one attains transcendence as a divine immortal.

The *Numinous Registers of the Three Heavens and Nine Mysteries of the Mysterious Capital of the Great Perfected* originated from the Nine Heavens Perfected King, who transmitted them to the Most High and the Jade Emperor of the Three Heavens. The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning bestowed them upon the Queen Mother of the West, the Soaring Perfected of the Numinous Flight, and the Venerable Elder of the Great Dao, who then passed them to the multitude of immortals and Perfected Ones who had attained the Way. This scripture was kept secret within the Numinous Capital Palace of the Most High, inscribed upon tablets of purple jade with characters of yellow gold. It was entrusted to the Five Elders and the Left Duke of the Immortals’ Assembly, sealed within a casket of purple-calyx jade, and encased in a cloud-brocade satchel. Heavenly consorts attended with incense, jade maidens held towels, and three hundred golden youths stood guard.

Thereafter, the Golden Portal Emperor of Later Sages and the Ministerial Lord of the Azure Youth, thrice each month, would purify themselves in fasting and ascend in a chariot of azure radiance and ninefold numinous streaming clouds, beneath a canopy of blue-green feathers, accompanied by a thousand Perfected Ones of the Mulberry Grove. They would ascend to the Numinous Capital Palace of the Most High, pay homage to the True Father, and wander in revelry through the jade courts. At times, the Most High Lord of the Great Dao, together with the Nine Mysteries Sage Lords and the Ministerial Lord of the Azure Youth, would ascend within the jade halls of the jeweled palace. Countless Perfected Ones and maidens attended, while flying dragons and venomous beasts guarded the numinous gates. Gigantic serpents, a thousand fathoms long, brandished their claws across the vast courtyards. Eightfold radiance streamed forth, resplendent in the Jade Clarity, suspended from banners and canopies. Flowing standards encircled the incense, jade flutes sang in the void, and divine groves echoed with music. Ten thousand tones resounded, penetrating the Nine Origins. Cloud songs arose from the assembled musicians, unicorns danced and phoenixes sang, their harmonies reverberating through the Jade Void and shaking the Three Clarities. Nectar of flowing radiance and fruits of adamantine hardness were set forth, their platters scattered in profusion. Gazes drifted toward the Great Obscurity, until at last the Lord of the Great Dao took up the cloud-zither, plucking its strings. The jade tones gleamed with brilliance, their echoes piercing the Great Empyrean. Then he sang the *Hymn of the Divine Phoenix* and the *Melody of the Nine Numinous Ones*. Its lyrics declared:

*"O subtle the qi of the Nine Mysteries,
Pervading the source of the Three Clarities!"*

The numinous transformations arise with the turning of the kalpas,
Profound echoes resound through the highest empyrean.
The six senses unlock the Mystic Pass—
Only when unenlightened does one begin in truth.

They gather their robes in the Jade Emperor’s court,
Unfolding the principles of the Great Void.
Purple radiance illumines the Mystic Terrace,
Its flowing brilliance endless and boundless.

The great kalpa has its destined end,
The Hundred and Six calamities suddenly arise.
Divine joys know no limit of years—
Yet they grieve for the children of later generations.

Thereupon, the Most High completed his song,
And the Nine Mysteries Sovereign Lords intoned their names and sang:

*"Wielding the reins of nine dragons,
We ascend to the Jade Emperor’s court.
The qi of the Nine Mysteries pervades the Great Void,
Its dharma-transformations sinking into the Three Numinous Ones.
In the lofty assembly of the Mystic Dawn Tower,
We receive in person the primordial essence of the Origin.
Boundless rays gather in the Palace of Grand Auroral Light,
Our gazes flowing without end.
Divine illumination penetrates the hidden passes,
Refining the embryo to restore the original form.
We grieve for the children of the Five Turbidities,
Whose lives are as fleeting as the morning dew."*

Thereupon, the Nine Mysteries Perfected Lords completed their song,
And the Prime Minister, the Azure Lad, intoned his name and sang:

*"The Primordial Record of the Nine Heavens,
Gives birth to the boundless qi of transformation.
The Three Numinous Ones clarify the Mystic Scenery,
The Six Essences follow the course of the kalpas.
The Cinnabar Empyrean veils the empty vastness,
The Three Perfected transcend all limits.
Looking up and down in the Hall of the Great Emperor,
We receive the decrees of the Three Heavens.
We purge and cleanse the malevolence of the Six Heavens,
Establishing purity without dust or defilement.
We fathom the chapters of the Grand Perfection,
To save the world of the Tang.
We awaken the students of later times,
Those whose hearts align with the profound契.
We deliver them from the sufferings of the Three Wretched Realms,
Swiftly soaring, controlling the dragon-reins.
Enveloped in the mist of the Upper Clarity’s halls,
How could they perceive any lingering hindrance?"*

When the song concluded, the Most High, together with the Nine Mysterious Perfected of Later Sagacity and the Minister of the Upper Prime, the Azure Lad, jointly expounded the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens for expelling the texts of the Six Heavens. They transmitted the precious esoteric incantations, ritual invocations, and sacrificial protocols, bestowing them upon the two Perfected Ones, commanding them to instruct all later students aspiring to become True Persons, that they might govern the Six Heavens and subdue the myriad malevolent forces.

Thereupon, the Imperial Lord and the Minister of the Upper Prime, the Azure Lad, reverently received the true esoterica, bowed deeply, and withdrew.

The King of the Lesser Existence in the Heaven of Pure Emptiness declared: "All who receive the multitudinous texts—the Nine Subtle Scriptures of the Three Heavens, the Mysterious Capital, the Supreme Perfected, and the Registers of Yin-Yang Spirits—must ever devote themselves with utmost sincerity and diligent mindfulness. Entering the chamber to burn incense, they shall pray and invoke the true numina, seeking to welcome the Sagely Lords into the Palace of Upper Clarity. They must constantly recite the numinous chapters and talismanic scriptures once through. After nine years of such practice, the numina will respond with signs and omens, and the Most High shall surely dispatch the Perfected of the Great Ultimate to descend into your bedchamber."

The Most High addressed the Perfected of Later Sagacity, saying: "Whenever one approaches a scripture master to receive the texts, the master shall face north and make a solemn vow before transmitting the teachings to the disciple. Once the disciple has received the texts, they shall turn east and bow nine times—though a bow of the heart suffices—and secretly pray:

*'I humbly invoke the Nine Heavens’ True Kings, the Primordial Heavenly King of Original Commencement, and the Most High Great Dao Lord. Born in this degenerate age, far removed from the Upper Mystery, I have nonetheless received the true transmission and obtained the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens for expelling the texts of the Six Heavens. Overwhelmed with joy and gratitude, I reverently make this known above, beseeching the grant of true perfection. May the true numina descend, their majesty governing the ten directions, subduing the myriad spirits. At my command, let them arrive instantly; at my call, let their voices resound through the unseen. May I receive the Eight Effulgences and welcome the Sagely Lords.'*

When the prayer is complete, copy the scriptures, placing one set in a separate chamber. Morning and evening, burn incense and pay homage to the divine texts. The Most High shall then dispatch ten jade lads and ten jade maidens to attend and guard your person."

The Most High further instructed the Perfected of Later Sagacity: "All who possess the proper bone configuration and whose names are recorded in the Eastern Florescence may wear the Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens, the Most High’s multitudinous texts, and the numinous registers. After nine years, on the day of their natal destiny or the day of the Grand Year Star, they shall inscribe one copy of the text in cinnabar on white silk and journey to their designated sacred peak to bury it, thereby governing the qi of the Five Peaks and the myriad spirits. At the time of burial, face north, click the teeth three times, and pray aloud:

*'As the Six Heavens complete their cycle and the Three Ways are rightly illumined, the sacred texts of the Upper Immortals govern the Nine Numinous Ones. Sealing the Five Peaks, they command the multitude of spirits. Now, as a true immortal, I come to manifest my form. I report to the myriad deities, inscribing my name apart. Wash away a thousand evils, that I may later ascend to the Jade Clarity.'*

Then bury the text, digging nine feet deep. After twenty-seven years—having buried three copies in total—the Most High shall surely dispatch the Perfected of the Four Poles to welcome your person into the Palace of Upper Clarity. The numinous officials of the Five Peaks shall ever guard and escort you in your goings and comings, granting you the joys of spontaneity. Cloud chariots and feathered carriages shall welcome your person.

After nine years of practice, on the day of your natal destiny or the day of the Grand Year Star, at midnight in a separate chamber, when all is silent and still, expose yourself in the central courtyard. Arrange a seat facing north, and set up five tables in the five directions. On each table, place incense and fire, and a hand towel covering the surface. Use a three-foot length of crimson silk to invite the scriptures and talismans onto the tables. Place a tray of fruit and a measure of jujubes upon a platter.

Face north, bow twice, and click the teeth twelve times. Invoke the August Sovereigns of the Nine Subtle and Eight Dao, the Nine-Flowered Imperial Mysterious Yellow Maiden, the officials of the Nine Numinous Ones, and the Inspectors of the Perfected. Declare your name, saying: *'I, so-and-so, having formerly received the Eight Numinous Registers and the multitudinous books, have for nine years offered humble rites and presented offerings to the host of Perfected. I humbly beseech your descent to receive my sincere heart, that my body may become clear and my qi radiant, my majesty governing the ten directions. May the thousand evils and myriad perversities all be subdued and bound, that I may commune with the divine.'*

When the nine years are complete, you shall again trouble the Illustrious Perfected with your prayers. Thus concludes the rite."

When all this is complete, bury the fruits, jujubes, and other offerings from the rite in the sacred peak to which they belong, digging a pit nine feet deep. As you bury them, face north, strike your teeth nine times, and recite the incantation:

*"The heavens are pure above, the subtle Dao distant and profound. The Three Norms govern the turning, the Six Qi sink and dissolve. The registers of the Supreme Perfected command and subdue the myriad perversities. Having offered rites to the Five Numinous Ones, may my prayers be received and my summons answered. Sealing and returning to the numinous peaks, may my body share their eternal repose."*

Pour the remaining offerings over the burial. After performing this rite three times, the Most High shall dispatch Perfected Ones to bestow upon you the title of *Primordial Sovereign Lady*, and the immortals of the Five Peaks shall guard your person.

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage, Nine Mysteries Imperial Sovereign*, saying: *"You shall receive the title of* Supreme Clarity Golden Portal Later Sage Imperial Sovereign. *You shall ascend to Supreme Clarity, wander the Great Ultimate, and govern the Ten Heavens below. You shall hold dominion over the myriad multitudes, the celestial rivers and seas, divine mountains and earthly springs, secretly overseeing the host of spirits—all shall be under your charge. Diligently seek the Supreme Perfected, assist in rectifying the Three Heavens, and eradicate all that is inauspicious. Now I transmit to you the* Eight Numinous Registers *and the multitudinous scriptures. Apply yourself with utmost devotion, inscribe them into your bones, and become a sagely master. Expel perversities and preserve the true lineage, restore rectitude to the Three Heavens, and await the advent of the* Chengtang *era in the* renchen *year, when my Dao shall prevail."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens must render service to them, aiding the times by eliminating inauspicious forces, so that the true Dao may unfold in clarity and the Six Heavens be annihilated. You must always bathe in purity, fast in seclusion, burn incense in your chamber, and copy the true writs and numinous registers five times, placing them in the five directions of your dwelling. Sit upright in the center, facing north, and strike your left teeth thirty-six times. Close your eyes and inwardly visualize your body exhaling qi, which transforms into radiant flames and luminous essence, filling the heavens in dark profusion. Let it burn the mountains, forests, grasses, and trees of the four quarters, the earthly numinous officials, and all people, reducing everything to utter desolation. Let the heavens be plunged into darkness, leaving not a single remnant, all boundaries dissolved. When the fiery qi is wholly consumed, pure qi surges forth—above, there is no heaven; below, no earth. All beneath the heavens returns to the origin of emptiness. The golden gates and jade portals, the jasper palaces and purple halls array themselves, and you, too, abide within the void, amid the pure qi. Then raise your voice and pray:*

*'The heavens gleam, the earth surges; the Three, the Five, and the numinous. Radiance streams to the farthest bounds, filling the heavens in dark profusion. From below, there is no beyond—all returns to formlessness. The host of perversities in the Six Heavens is utterly leveled. The Great One hastens the turning; the true Dao shall prevail. The Nine Heavens issue their decree, seizing and binding the rebellious. Circling the heavens and pervading the earth, none may tarry. The sagely sovereign appears in majesty, steering his chariot to the Purple Court. He surveys the ten directions and presents his memorial to the Jade Clarity.'*

When finished, draw in the qi of the five directions and swallow it, then draw in the nine qi and cease. This is the *Prayer of the Nine Heavens*, transmitted by the Nine Heavens’ True Kings to the Most High, and by the Most High to the Later Sage, to be practiced constantly. It subdues the Six Heavens and commands the myriad spirits with awe. If you devote yourself earnestly and concentrate your spirit upon the Three Offices, aiding heaven in eliminating inauspicious forces, then in the era of Great Peace, the Most High shall examine your merits and, according to your diligence, promote you to fill the ranks of the Perfected Immortals.

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and bear the true writs must prioritize bathing and purification. Always keep your sandals, clothing, and garments immaculate, lest they become defiled. If they are, the true spirits will depart, and inauspicious forces will take advantage, leading to ruin. Disciples must be vigilant and cautious. Those who violate this prohibition shall be demoted and stripped of their ranks as* zhen *immortals by the* Supreme Ultimate *Bureau of Immortals."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens must not recklessly enter defiled or impure places, nor weep sorrowful tears, nor offer condolences at funerals or mourn the dead. Those who violate this shall be stripped of their ranks as* zhen *immortals."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and bear the true writs must not, when going out beneath the Three Luminaries or resting in darkness, expose their heads without a kerchief or hat, nor remove their clothes to reveal their form. To do so is to insult and dishonor your body and spirit, driving away the noble spirits and leaving only an empty corpse. Those who violate this prohibition shall have their lifespan reduced and be stripped of their ranks as* zhen *immortals. Disciples must be cautious."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens must not recklessly share a bed or seat with those of the yin household, nor wear the same clothes as those with whom you do not share qi, nor share blankets or bedding, nor exchange sandals or other items. Those who violate this shall have their lifespan extinguished and be stripped of their ranks as* zhen *immortals. Disciples must be cautious."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All who receive the true methods of the Three Heavens and command the host of spirits to pacify the Six Heavens must first purify their own bodies, maintaining solemn clarity and rectitude. Do not transgress the prohibitions, so that the true spirits remain reverent and the myriad gods guard your form. Follow the methods in your practice, and the inauspicious forces of the Six Heavens will naturally retreat, no longer encroaching upon your rectitude. But if you allow your body to become impure and are overpowered by the host of perversities, do not, in your days of misfortune, regret these words. Disciples must be cautious."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"These five precepts are drawn from the* Eleventh Scroll, Middle Section, *of the* Four Poles of Luminous Statutes. *Those who bear them are attended by jade lads as guardians. If the bearer violates the prohibitions, the jade lads shall report it, and the offender shall suffer unseen punishments, with calamities extending to their seven generations. Now I have excerpted them to instruct later disciples. Those who bear them must study them diligently."*

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"Those who bear the* Purple Writs of the Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies *shall be attended by twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to guard their person. Those who bear the* Numinous Registers and Multitudinous Scriptures *shall be attended by ten jade lads to guard their person. Those who bear the* True Threefold Writs of the Supple Numinous Capital of the Grand Tenuity *shall be attended by thirty direct talismanic attendants and twelve jade maidens to guard their person. Those who bear the* True Book of Imperial Mercy of the Heavenly Thearch *shall be attended by ten jade lads to guard their person."*

Those who bear the *True Writs of the Most High Primordial Sovereign Lady* shall be attended by twelve jade maidens to guard their person. Those who bear the *Flying Celestial True Book of the Purple Tenuity Mysterious Palace Jade Writs* shall be attended by twenty-four jade lads and twenty-four jade maidens to guard their person. Those who bear the *Supreme True Book of Penglai* shall be attended by twelve jade lads to guard their person. Those who bear the *Yellow Supreme True Book of the Heavenly Thearch Elder* shall be attended by one hundred jade maidens to discern fortune and misfortune. Those who bear the *True Book of the Celestial Count of Mystic Continent, Opener of the Myriad Immortals of Heaven* shall be attended by twelve jade lads to guard their person. Those who bear the *Talismanic Tallies of the Five Marchmounts of Vast Life and Grand Perfection* shall be attended by twelve jade maidens to guard their person. Those who bear the *True Book of the Primordial Heavenly Thearch*, which emerges from existence and enters non-existence, shall further be attended by twelve jade lads and twelve jade maidens to guard their person.

The Most High addressed the *Later Sage Sovereign*, saying: *"All those whose bone destiny is recorded, whose names are inscribed in the Eastern Florescence, and whose characters are registered in the Upper Clarity—when they bear the true books and multitudinous registers, jade lads and jade maidens shall be assigned to guard their person, record their merits, manifest their goodness, and restrain leaks and disclosures. Bearers must not recklessly transmit these texts. To transmit them to unworthy recipients, to disregard the allotted years, or to lightly disclose the treasured writs shall subject one to the trials of the wind-blade, consignment to ghostly officials after death, and calamities extending to the seven ancestors and forebears. They shall have Mount Meng’s stones heaped upon them and the Nine Springs’ rivers blocked against them. Be deeply cautious in upholding these precepts."*

The *Upper Clarity Writs for Eliminating the Six Heavens* and the *Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens* were received by the *Later Sage Sovereign* from the Most High and compiled by the *King of Lesser Existence of the Clear Void Heaven*. The *Registers of the Upper Immortals* are collectively named the *Writs of the Six Heavens and Orthodox Dharma of the Three Heavens’ Upper Perfected*, used to capture myriad ghosts and restrain all evil. Every seven hundred years, they are transmitted thrice; every hundred years, a worthy recipient may be found, and a second transmission may be permitted. A vermilion-green silk cord of thirty feet shall serve as the essential pledge, a blue cloth of forty-three feet as the secret oath, and five pairs of gold rings as the great vow pointing to Heaven. Men who receive the texts shall submit the writ without sacrifice; women who receive them shall perform sacrifice. Transmission shall be preceded by a three- or seven-day retreat. During the retreat, one shall offer to the master who possesses the scriptures ten taels of fine gold as a token of communion with the spirits. Those who leak, conceal, or disobey the regulations shall suffer seven generations of trials, as stipulated in the *Statutes of the Four Poles*. Bearers who do not pass the texts through the *yin qi*—for *yin qi* is turbid and impure—shall incur great transgression and become lowly ghosts after death. Those who uphold them according to the Dharma shall assuredly ascend to the *Upper Clarity*. The *Eight Thearchs* regard these as the secret immortal bonds; those who possess them shall have their names inscribed on jade tablets by the *Great Yin*. Here ends the *Orthodox Dharma Scripture of the Three Heavens of the Most High*.
