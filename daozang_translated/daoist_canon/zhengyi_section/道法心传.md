**The Transmission of Dao by Heart**

I, from my youth, ardently pursued the Dao and its methods, sparing neither labor nor hardship, seeking instruction from masters—how many were they? The world inquires about the **play of the Mystic Pass (Xuanguān)** and the **essence of the Dark Mother (Xuānmǔ)**.

They say: The Mystic Pass lies between the two kidneys, one *cùn* and three *fēn* below the navel. The Bright Hall (Mingtang) and the Six Harmonies (Liùhé), the Elixir Field (Dantian), the mouth and nostrils—these are the Dark Mother.

The world inquires about the **Five Phases’ generation and conquest**, the subtleties of **water and fire’s clashing and stripping**.

They say: The Five Phases—metal, wood, earth, water, fire—are arranged in a **crossed pattern within the well-diagram (jǐngzì)**, thus generating and conquering. **Silk talismans and brick seals** are cast into water, producing **judgmental sounds (píngyù)**, thus achieving clashing and stripping.

I pondered these teachings and feared they did not yet reach the **Mystic Depths**. Thus, for over thirty years, I observed the gathering and scattering of clouds, the shifts in **qi and climate**, silently merging with their essence, my joy unknowable.

By fortune of past lives, I also encountered a **Sage of the Highest Order**, and in a single word, I attained certainty without doubt.

For the **movement and stillness of Heaven and Earth**, the **revolution of sun and moon**, the **order of the Four Seasons**, the **emergence of all things**—all arise from the **wondrous flow of the Supreme Ultimate (Tàijí)**. The Sage cannot describe it; they name it **Divine (Shén)**.

This Divine is neither green nor white, neither red nor black, neither fire nor water, neither square nor round. It spans the ancient and the present, dwelling within the human heart. When the heart is **pure and still**, it abides; when **filth and turbidity** arise, it vanishes.

Thus, when **essence (jīng)** is settled, **qi** is settled; when **qi** is settled, **spirit (shén)** is settled. When these three are settled, the **Dao and its methods are complete**.

Dispersed, it becomes **wind and clouds**; gathered, it manifests as **thunder and lightning**. It emerges as **generals and officers**; it returns as **the Golden Elixir (Jīndān)**.

Alas, later scholars **wander in false paths**, lost in the **sea of desire**, severing their **original nature (běnzhēn)**, clinging to **written texts** as if they were treasures. This is **abandoning the True for the False**, seeking the ox while riding it.

Thus, **Master Sa** said:
*A single spark of luminous spirit is the talisman—*
*Yet fools mistake ink for cinnabar.*

*When spirit does not scatter, Original Yang is steadfast,*
*Ten thousand demons and monsters are swept away.*

**Master Xu Jing** said:
*If spirit departs, draw it back.*
*When spirit returns to the body, qi flows naturally.*
*Thus, morning and evening, returning again and again,*
*The True Child is born from the womb of innocence.*

How much more so—**every person has their share**; all may attain this.
Why abandon oneself and willingly descend to the **Nine Abysses**?
This is truly lamentable.

I have written this **Mind Transmission** to illuminate the later generations.
If the learned of former times were to glance at it, they would nod in approval.

**On the Day of the First Full Moon, Year Jiawu of the Zhiyuan Era [1294],**
a humble student from Songjiang, **Jingyang Wang Weiyu**, recorded this in haste.

**Mind Transmission of the Dao**
**Primordial Ancestral Qi**
Ears, eyes, mouth, nose, body—
Spirit, soul, and intent.
Piercing the Central Palace, they transmute into **Primordial Qi**.

**Original Spirit**
My Original Spirit before the Void—
A formless, shapeless, nameless self.
Piercing gold, traversing stone without obstruction,
A single luminous spark illuminating all.

**Divine Powers**
Each person holds their own **Heaven and Earth**,
Within which stands a **Sovereign Most High**.
Commanding all spirits across the Three Realms,
Yet fools waste their vital essence in vain.

**Mystic Applications**
Ascending to Heaven or descending to Earth—
Fire cannot burn, water cannot drown.
Filling the boundless void, encompassing all forms,
Yet unseen when gazed upon, unheard when listened to.

**Mysterious Womb**
A hollow orifice—root of Heaven and Earth,
Endlessly dense, yet no wind passes through.
Vague and distant, yet containing form,
When the True Person emerges, a **Precious Pearl** is born.

**True Earth**
**Yin and Yang** unite as the **Yellow Mother**,
Heaven and Earth have no recourse.
Day and night they cling together,
Yet remain unaware of their own grinding.

**True Seed**
The **Primordial One**—called **True Lead**—
Planted in **Kun** when born in **Qian**.
Nurtured for three years until ripe,
Then wandering the **Penglai Isles** as an immortal.

**True Furnace and Cauldron**
The **True Furnace and Cauldron** forge the elixir—
Why seek them externally in trifles?
When the mind is still, the body steadies itself,
And when body and mind are still, the **Elixir Seed** appears.

**True Medicinals**
The **Three Supreme Medicines** are no ordinary substances,
Born when **Heaven and Earth** have not yet divided.
When the fire is sufficient, the elixir ripens—
A serpent swallows one grain and becomes a dragon.

**Dragon and Tiger (Metaphorical Names)**
If the mind is not concentrated, it cannot be subdued,
Like the might of dragons and tigers.
Yet if one knows the place of **No-Mind and No-Thought**,
Ever guarding the Original Spirit in the **Chamber of Mystery**.

**Lead and Mercury (Spiritual Essences)**
The two essences—**Spirit and Qi**—are **Lead and Mercury**,
Yet using them unseen, they are useless when seen.
Transfer the **real essence of Kan** to the **void of Li**,
And the Spirit moves within, leaving no gaps.

**The One Yang Begins**
The work begins with **One Yang**,
When **One Yang** first stirs, merging with **Primordial Unity**.
Primordial Qi is thus obtained,
And refining it yields the **Golden Elixir**, the **Pharmaceutical Sovereign**.

**The Dao Is Near**
The Dao is not distant—it lies within the mind.
No need to seek it across mountains and rivers.
To attain the Dao, the heart must first be rectified,
And **Pure Yang** must not be tainted by even a trace of **Yin**.

**Post-Heavenly Formation**
When **Yin and Yang** unite, the embryo forms,
For ten months, **Primordial Unity** remains sealed.
Laughable are the foolish who forget their origin,
Not recalling their source from days of old.

**The Two Are One**
**Primordial** gives birth, **Post-Heavenly** sustains—
The **Six Bandits** assail day and night, plunging into darkness.
Yet knowing they are one without distinction,
Nurture them to soar through the **Heavenly Gate** on a crane.

**The Body’s Priceless Treasure**
Within the body lies a priceless treasure—
**Essence, Qi, and Original Spirit**.
Preserve and nurture them with unwavering awareness,
And without leakage, one becomes a **True Person**.

**The Secret of Longevity**
**Nature** returns to **Command**—one may become immortal,
But if **Spirit departs**, the body dies—how pitiful.
To make this body never die,
Cultivate it in the **Undivided Chaos** before differentiation.

**Nature and Life Are One**
Life is Nature, Nature is Life—
They must never be separated.
Before **joy, anger, sorrow, or delight** arise,
Walk the path of **Central Harmony**, the **Heavenly Position**.

**The Dead Heart, the Living Spirit**
When not a single thought arises, that is the **True Heart**,
But as soon as deliberation begins, it becomes the **Deluded Heart**.
Only when the heart is still does the Spirit truly live,
And in unbounded freedom, even ghosts and gods revere.

**The Void is Within Me**
All things are empty, yet **Nature** is not empty—
Thoughts lurk hidden in the **Great Void**.
Coming and going without constraint,
I let the sun and moon rise and set as they will.

**The Stem of *Hai* Wood**
**Xun Wood** planted in *Hai* in autumn—
Its vitality transforms endlessly.
To know where **Shedding returns to the Root**,
Look to where **Heaven and Earth** have not yet divided.

**Child of *Zi* and *Hai***
When **Li** and **Kan** intersect, the **Sacred Embryo** forms,
And when **Zi** meets **Hai**, the child is born.
The child entrusts itself to the **Yellow Mother** for nurturing,
And when perfected, the Spirit ascends to the **Nine Heavens**.

**Man’s Misuse of the Heart**
Rotten grass becomes fireflies, worms turn into dragons,
And cicadas transform to drink the **Pure Wind**.
Though divine powers are vast, only humans gather them—
Yet alas, deluded ones misuse their efforts.
**They forget the root, chasing after the branches.**

「The Essence of Parents’ Vitality»
The vital essence of parents combines to form a man—
Yet they never truly saw his original face.
Chasing fame and profit wears away his substance,
And after death, he willingly endures bitter suffering.

**Love and Desire Bind the Mind**
Love and desire ensnare all—
No one escapes becoming a transcendent.
Love and desire bind, yet none advance.
When the final hour arrives, you depart alone—
All reduced to a dream sinking into the Yellow Springs.

**The Cycle of Gratitude and Harm**
Gratitude and harm intertwine:
From gratitude springs harm, from harm arises gratitude,
And this endless loop opens the gate of life and death.
Only when matters reach their extreme do regrets begin—
Better to return to the Root and reclaim your true nature.

**Distress and Delusion»
Distress and delusion stem from greed and ignorance,
And once thoughts arise, fear delays their cessation.
Follow nature’s flow, resist what comes against it—
Then the heart naturally purifies itself.
Wickedness will never dare to linger near.

**The Shackles of Body and Mind»
Hauling firewood, carrying water—
The years pass in endless toil,
Binding body and mind, leaving no freedom.
Only the enlightened understand this truth:
With a flower in their hair and wine in hand, they drift effortlessly.

**Form is Emptiness»
Form is emptiness—yet few recognize it,
And adorn their hollow skulls with endless artifice.
Always keep the Dao-eye open, as if nothing exists—
Do not waste your bright pearls in dark investments.

**Distress Diminishes the Spirit»
I urge you to rejoice and not indulge in distress—
For distress surely weakens the Spirit.
Blend with the world, harmonize with its light,
And live each moment with contentment’s four seasons.

**All Matters Are Fleeting»
Worldly affairs swirl like tangled hemp,
Yet when counted, they amount to nothing.
Better to withdraw early and seek true refuge—
Recognize Penglai as your eternal home.

**Self-Fulfillment and Joy»
Blow the wind through a reed flute without holes,
And summon the green cranes and white herons to play.
Drink freely, let the wine linger in your cup—
Then depart to visit the cave-dwellers of Xi Yi.

**The Game of Life and Death»
The river of love flows boundless and wide,
The sea of desire runs deep without end.
How many souls drown within its depths,
Endlessly losing the game of life and death?

**Awakening and Early Practice»
A plow-ox, dragged and driven without shame,
Is lashed and whipped until it knows no fear.
Then one day it suddenly returns to the slaughterhouse—
Regretting it had not practiced early and awakened.

**The Body as Greatest Affliction»

**The True Nature of Life and Death**
The birth-and-death cycle is but one true thing,
Its root arises from illusion’s stir—thus the self comes to be.
If great afflictions breed all suffering,
Return to the origin, restore the primal—free yourself from worldly dust.

**The Six Demons of Disturbance**
Six demons dwell within the body, tormenting mortals,
Yet none seize the moment to cultivate virtue’s harmony.
Day by day they fade, leaving no trace—
Only the radiant gold-light reveals their true nature.

**The Difficulty of Being Human**
To ponder quietly in this world is hard,
Enduring myriad trials of mortal life.
When you reach the end of water and mountain,
Only then does the body find true peace.

**Gold from the Ore**
Human hearts must align with Heaven’s will,
Turning iron rods to needles through deep practice.
Wait until the fire of refinement burns away—
Then the ore is exhausted, and true gold remains.

**Act When the Mind Strayeth**
Mind-monkeys and will-horses race in tandem,
Through the twelve hours—do not act in folly.
The moment a thought strays, strike it down,
Even if you sink into deep confusion.

**Doubt in All Matters**
Zhang Hu saw a pig wallowing in mud,
A cartload of ghosts causing chaos and strife.
The world holds nothing inherently strange—
Why create doubt where none should arise?

**The Body Is Not Eternal**
The four elements are borrowed, not truly yours,
Temporarily lodged in this dusty realm, not permanent.
Joy or sorrow, grief or delight—
Do not wait until death to play the fool.

**The Art of True Abiding**
Master the somersault on the high pole,
Dig to find Heaven—it is the same as Earth.
All things fall silent in the true realm’s mystery,
While mortals still debate life and death in vain.

**Clay Spirits and Dragon-Capturing**
Clay spirits sink into water, losing their radiance,
Dragons are seized and led to the Jade Capital.
No single punch is struck to shatter them—
The moon rises over the sea, tides turn calm.

**The Iron Ox Cultivates the Golden Lotus**
An iron ox plows the earth, sowing golden lotuses,
Requiring no labor or coin.
Heaven’s River waters nourish them,
Flowers bloom, their fragrance filling the sky.

**The Puppet of Thread**
Human life is a puppet pulled by a thread,
Dragged forward without daring to retreat.
When the thread snaps, it cannot rise again—
What use are grandchildren to a lifeless eye?

**Money as Master**
Men toil endlessly for wealth’s sake,
Losing time in sorrow, rejoicing in gain.
Masked as ghosts or men, they play their roles—
Look closely, and you see only yourself.

**Learning Knows No Order**
Hidden truths are hard to fathom—do not deceive yourself,
For learning has no strict order, only high and low.
Before probing the depths of mystery,
Do not presume to judge before others.

**Discerning the Wise and Foolish**
We transmit the heart’s truth in learning,
Ignoring Heaven’s secrets through blunt speech.
Only the virtuous understand in silence,
Recognizing wisdom through mutual resonance.

**No Need for External Seeking**
Though you bow to a hundred masters,
Each may boast of grand pretensions.
Ask east, and they point west—
Harmony is lost, like discordant strings.

**Striving with Resolute Will**
Fervently practicing the Thunder Method,
No place in the world can satisfy its demands.
Thirty years of effort—
Only then does the heart find peace.

**What Is Practice?**
First, uphold precepts as the root,
Then guard Heaven’s laws—do not act in folly.
To summon the Thunder God to submission,
Its crashes and flashes must split the heart open.

**Practice Comes First**
To become an immortal through methods,
Practice must precede all else.
Save the people, ease their suffering,
And ascend to Heaven in broad daylight.

**Speak and Act in Truth**
Speak truly, and it shall be done—
No need for further exhortation.
If this life is squandered,
You shall sink into endless confusion for eons.

**Unity of Essence and Function**
Dao is the essence of the method,
The method is the function of Dao.
When essence and function align,
The Three Realms merge into one.

**Orthodoxy Conquers Heresy**
The Ancestors established law within the heart,
And only when the heart’s law is mastered
Are all laws understood.
With orthodoxy, heresy is subdued—
Then even flowers and moon fear Liang Gong.

**The Law’s Miraculous Power**
How does the law manifest its power?
It does not leave the black essence within the body.
When qi and spirit gather, the spirit abides,
And myriad demons dissolve into dust.

**Exhausting Principle to Know Fate**
Exhausting principle and nature reveals destiny,
Ignorance of truth is the greatest ailment.
When crows fly, fish leap, and cranes cry in the mist,
Mastery of transcendence leads to sainthood.

**Harmonizing Yin and Yang**
Observe Heaven’s way and follow its movements,
Only then does Yin and Yang truly unite.
Today, I reveal this to you—
Do not treat these words as commonplace.

**Man Is Inferior to Things**
Humans are the most enlightened of creatures,
Yet things often surpass them.
Observe the serpent coiled around stone,
Hiding until spring’s return.

**Hiding with the Thunder**
To practice the Thunder Method,
Always follow the thunder’s concealment.
Perfecting true transformation,
Only then may you act and spread its power.

**Seals and Talismans**
Talismans, seals, and incantations are but written tools,
Their power lies in cultivation and focused thought.
Silent stillness reveals Heaven’s heart,
And every response aligns with subtle truth.

**Sacrificing to Summon Evil**
Slaughtering life to harm others while invoking the Thunder General
Only invites malevolent spirits to appear.
The virtuous and upright do otherwise—
With sincerity, all things communicate with Heaven.

**The Talisman’s True Power**
Ink and vermilion cannot make a talisman sacred,
Its power lies in the original spirit-qi.
When transformation and movement are known,
The marrow-palace heals, and peace is restored.

**Lift and It Is Done**
Nurture the spirit, and it becomes divine—
No need to close your eyes to store the mind.
Every thought and impulse flows within—
A single spark of light never leaves the body.

**The Ebb and Flow of Yin and Yang**
Always watch the Dipper’s handle in the sky,
As Yin wanes and Yang grows, passing in turn.
They form the four seasons, eight nodes,
Giving birth to medicines too wondrous to proclaim.

**Peeling and Returning**
Creation enfolds the Great Ultimate,
From peeling and returning, divine craft unfolds.
When six Yangs are complete, they return to Kun,
Stirring thunder and lightning from the Kan Dragon.

**Thunder’s Origin**
When Heaven’s Yang grows bright and days lengthen,
The gentle wind stirs warmth, and the northern tide rises.
One Yang reaches Zheng—thunder emerges,
Thunder in Kun becomes its voice.

**Thunder’s Fury**
Wood meets fire’s vigor, heat then arises,
The turbulent southern wind disrupts the Five Phases.
Stirring thunder’s crash brings transformation,
Cold follows, obscuring clarity.

**What Is Thunder?**
Yang-one is thunder, Yin-two is lightning,
Yin and Yang’s qi fluctuates in excess or lack.
When Yin contains Yang to its extreme, it must release,
Stirring the sky-shaking, earth-rattling sound.

「To discern the Thunder’s Aperture
Wind and cloud, thunder and rain are all concealed within One *Qi*.
This aperture is known to few—most fail to recognize its truth.
Stirring and peeling disrupt the Heavenly Dragon’s array,
Halting wind and rain with a crashing, earth-shaking roar.

**What Is Wind?**
When Heaven’s *Qi* shifts and transforms, it becomes wind,
Which must divide into south and north, east and west.
It can bring forth life or take it away, summon rain or clear the sky,
And at the moment of prayer, its power is manifest.

**What Are Clouds and Rain?**
When Earth’s *Qi* ascends and gathers, it forms clouds.
Dispersed as *Qi*, they coalesce into rain.
Rain emerges from mountains and rivers within,
Rise and observe—then you’ll know what to expect.
**What Is Thunder?**
When ripe fruits split open, their essence is revealed—
These principles must be thoroughly explored.
When *Qi* is pent and steams the earth, dampness arises,
Stirring and peeling disrupt the balance of Yin and Yang.

**What Is Rain?**
Dryness becomes wind, dampness turns to rain,
Its transformations never stray from Earth.
But watch the steam from cooked rice—
When fire arrives, its nature is revealed.

**What Is Lightning?**
When Yin ascends and Yang descends without passage,
Water and fire churn, producing lightning’s flash.
A golden radiance emerges, responding to divine intent,
Followed by thunder’s roar as *Qi* is discharged.

**The River’s Omen**
To pray for rain or clear skies, one must know the River’s *Qi* and its season,
For its signs reveal the patterns of Heaven.
When the Five Directions clash, wind and cloud converge,
And the Thunder God is summoned to move at will.

**Understanding Wind and Cloud**
Mountain winds stir *Qi*, summoning clouds and rain,
Heaven’s Gate opens—wind is born.
If you grasp these pivotal moments,
Thunder and rain will fill the void.

**The Power of One *Qi***
One *Qi* shifts and returns—
Later, the dominance of Yin and Yang is seen.
Bringing back one transformation to peace,
This truth is shared with none but the wise.

**Uneven Clarity and Turbidity**
One *Qi* cycles through turbidity and clarity,
Rising pure, descending foul—balance is essential.
When Yin is excessive and Yang is weak, misty rain forms,
When Yang is strong and Yin is wan, prolonged clear skies reign.

**The Generations and Restrictions of the Five Phases**
One, two, three, four, five—
Earth holds the center.
Knowing the moments of generation and restriction,
You command thunder and rain with a single word.

**Brightness and Darkness in Contrast**
Brightness gives rise to darkness, darkness to brightness,
Their division clear—when rain ceases, skies brighten.
Rooted in Yin and Yang from the Great Ultimate,
Examine their subtleties, near and far.

**Balancing Water and Fire**
Fire gathers at noon’s peak,
Water forms at the moon’s rise.
Water and fire must be balanced,
For imbalance breeds chaos.

**The Fluctuations of Yin and Yang**
*Qi* shifts through the Heavenly Cycle, waxing and waning,
Like the Yellow Bell’s seasonal rhythm, precise and unerring.
Do not let Yin and Yang become disordered—
Frost in June, thunder in October will follow.

**The Moon’s Influence on Rain and Clear Skies**
When the moon emerges at *Gēng* (庚), its side is even,
The first half of its cycle brings rain, the latter clear skies.
To know the mysteries of creation’s workings,
Listen to the magpie’s cry and the crow’s call—signs of coming weather.

**The Sun’s Changes in *Qi***
The sun shifts from cold to hot, hot to cold,
South wind turns to north—observe its flow.
Who comprehends the reversals of Yin and Yang?
To know them is to never be deceived.

**The Five Peaks Communicating with Heaven**
In Heaven they take form as symbols, on Earth as peaks,
One *Qi* cycles endlessly without pause.
The Five Peaks conceal the divine, mastering creation,
When *Jiǎ* (甲) and *Gēng* (庚) meet, thunder and *Qi* surge.

**The Four Seas’ Apertures**
The Four Seas have apertures piercing to the heavens,
Heaven responds to stars, Earth to tides.
One breath, one inhalation—this is the subtle principle,
The *Lián* (屯) and *Méng* (蒙) hexagrams unite at dawn and dusk.

**Contemplating Celestial Patterns**
Observe Heaven without speaking of the Four Seasons’ march,
The *Qi* shifts, the myriad transformations busily unfold.
Fortune and calamity are revealed in signs,
Yet who among mortals truly seeks to understand?

**Examining Earthly Geography**
Heaven’s One *Qi* gives rise to Earth’s Two,
Wildflowers and grasses mirror the stars’ influence.
Mountains, rivers, seas, and peaks conceal their brilliance,
Within the vigorous *Qi*, each holds its form.

**Creation’s Cyclical Flow**
Five days form a *hòu* (候), two *Qi* form a cycle,
Three cycles make a node—each has its meaning.
Yin and Yang distribute across the Heavenly Cycle,
Chewing these truths reveals their depth.

**Subtle Principles Beyond Speech**
When the sun reaches *Qián* (乾), it’s still before *Shēn* (申),
At night, turning from *Kǎn* (坎) to emerge as *Yín* (寅).
Does water fear fire, does fire fear water?
The Dragon rises with the *Qi*—its power is divine.

**The Dynamics of Heaven and Earth**
Extreme motion yields stillness, stillness breeds motion,
Between them lies the wondrous interplay.
There are clear skies, rain, wind, and cloud,
The Dipper’s handle at the Heavenly Heart governs all.

**Predicting Rain and Clear Skies**
Yin and Yang move in their own time,
Their opposition never ceases.
If you know when rain and clear skies will come,
Prayers to the divine will surely be answered.

**Stirring and Peeling Yin and Yang**
Wind, cloud, thunder, and rain all originate from this,
The stirring and peeling of Yin and Yang—truly awe-inspiring.
Do not waste effort on mere parchment study,
Only by probing the *Qi* of Heaven will you find its taste.

**Regulating Drought and Flood**
When *Qi* and climate align, drought and flood are absent,
Yet imbalance spawns chaos.
The Dipper’s handle shifts, the Heavenly Gate turns—
Adjusting Yin and Yang, the Great Way prevails.

**Thunder Rising from Earth**
Heaven and Earth are daily sovereigns,
Yet thunder originates from Earth.
When *Qi* is pent and steams, it bursts forth,
Rolling wind and cloud, summoning rain.

**The Dragon Hidden in Pools and Caves**
The Dragon dwells in pools and caves,
When *Qi* is pent, it leaps to life.
When the Dragon’s time is at hand,
Who dares underestimate its might?

**Mist Transforming into Clouds**
Mist *Qi* arises at dawn, not in season,
Unbroken rain follows without doubt.
Endless clouds may appear, yet no rain—
If the time is not right, there’s no fixed rule.

**Fire’s Omen for Clear Skies**
When wind stirs the high heavens and the Four *Qi* are clear,
Fire clouds form—clear skies will follow.
As the sun traverses the land without fail,
Only when Yin’s time arrives will rain form.

**Observing the Wind’s Movements**
Winds shift in countless ways,
Rain turns to clear skies, heat to cold.
Yin and Yang’s waxing and waning establish the order,
Heaven’s Gate does not permit casual observation.

**Thunder’s Retreat**
When the Dipper’s handle completes its cycle and points west,
Metal’s *Qi* grows potent, the knife’s edge sharp.
As Yang wanes and Yin ascends, the peeling must occur,
Thunder retreats, its voice muffled in time.

**Praying for Snow with the Mud Ox**
To seek auspicious snow, use the Mud Ox’s form,
First wind, then rain—observe its cause.
Understand that thunder’s rise is a shifting of the *Qi*,
Sixfold blessings appear when the time is right.

**Foretelling Clouds**
At night, watch the Dragon play with its pearl,
By day, observe the clouds’ convergence.
Prayers answered in season prove divine,
For Heaven’s secrets are fully revealed.

**Bowing to the Mysterious Aperture**
All laws stem from One Aperture,
Yet none in the world know its truth.»

**Breaking the Mystery of the One Aperture**

I wish to speak plainly, yet fear you may still doubt.
**Bow to the Primordial *Qi* of the Pre-Heaven**
If you ask about the Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi* and find nothing,
Then the Post-Heaven’s work begins.

At midnight, if you sit with a clear mind,
This *Qi* will be known to emerge from **Great Emptiness (Tàixū)**.
When **Yin** wanes and **Yang** thrives, drought follows,
Yet when **Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, abundance is sure.
When **Yang** wanes and **Yin** thrives, floods arise,
And when **Yin** and **Yang** clash, eclipses occur.

The **Five Thunders** are born of **Yin** and **Yang** *Qi*,
Shaped by the **Five Phases (Wǔxíng)**.
**Yin** *Qi* descends and ascends in rhythm,
Responding to the Dipper’s handle’s turning.

There is growth and decline, retreat and concealment.
From **Winter Solstice (Dōngzhì)**, the **One Yang** emerges in the **Returning (Kàn) Hexagram**,
The **Two Yang** in the **Approaching (Lín) Hexagram**,
The **Three Yang** in the **Calm (Tài) Hexagram**,
The **Four Yang** in the **Great Strength (Dàzhuàng) Hexagram**.

At this time, *Qi* aligns with **Spring Equinox (Chūnfēn)**,
The **Perverse (Xùn) Wind** stirs, the earth’s moisture rises.
Before the **first lunar crescent (qiánxián)**, thunder begins to sound.

The **Five Yang** in the **Decaying (Guì) Hexagram**,
The **Six Yang** complete in the **Receptive (Kàn) Hexagram**—
**Divine *Qi*** must unite,
Waiting for the **Shaking (Zhèn)** to issue commands.
Without **Water** and **Fire** clashing and stripping,
It cannot manifest—thus, when **Yang** reaches its peak, **Yin** arises.

From **Summer Solstice (Xiàzhì)**, the **One Yin** in the **Conception (Chèn) Hexagram**,
The **Two Yin** in the **Withdrawing (Dùn) Hexagram**,
The **Three Yin** in the **Obstructing (Pǐ) Hexagram**,
The **Four Yin** in the **Meeting (Gòu) Hexagram**.

At this time, *Qi* aligns with **Autumn Equinox (Qiūfēn)**,
The **Metal Wind** clears and stills, all trees scatter.
Before the **first lunar crescent (hòuxián)**, thunder retreats its voice.

The **Five Yin** in the **Shedding (Bō) Hexagram**,
The **Six Yin** complete in the **Earth (Kūn) Hexagram**—
**Returning to the roots**, **reclaiming life**,
**Preserving *Qi***, **nurturing spirit**.
When **Yin** reaches its peak, **Yang** arises,
And the cycle begins anew—
The **Dao/Way** of eternal transformation, never ceasing.

Those who **summon thunder** must penetrate **Yin** and **Yang**,
Deepen their grasp of **creation’s workings (Zàohuà)**,
Clarify the **Heaven-Earth’s shifting rhythms (Tīngdìngzhījī)**,
Discern the **changes in wind-thunder *Qi***,
And know what **wind, thunder, and rain** truly are—
From what they arise, why they stir,
Where they begin, how they correspond to months, days, and hours,
Which thunder they agitate—
Then they wield the fury of **howling gales, sudden rains, crashing thunderbolts, and deafening peals**.

Yet **stirring must follow stillness**, and **stillness must precede stirring**—
Who orchestrates this **logic of rise and fall**?

I recall **Master Yīchuān (Zhú Xī)** asking **Master Shào Yàofū**:
*"Where will the thunder-wind arise this year?"*
This single question encapsulates the **wondrous workings of creation**—
Worthy of careful reflection and deep contemplation.

If you grasp this **one aperture’s passage**, all apertures are clear,
If one **divine essence (shén)** moves, all **divine essences** respond.
The **southeast (Xùn)** direction is not where thunder is summoned—
Using it would merely waste your **spiritual vitality**.

Yet this **one aperture**—
Formless, shapeless,
Neither before nor after,
Neither long nor short,
Beyond measure of width or narrowness,
Beyond distinction of east, west, south, or north—
Resides precisely at the **Heaven-Earth’s intersection**,
Where **Yin** and **Yang** blend in unity.
Even **ghosts and gods** cannot fathom its mysteries.

Alas, **later learners** fail to grasp this truth,
Instead fixating on the **rotten corpse’s fleshly orifices**,
Focusing on the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,
Or obsessing between the **two kidneys**.
Some channel *Qi* beneath the **navel (qíxià)**,
Others gaze at the **muddy pellet (Níhuán)**,
Lost in **frantic speculation**—
Believing this to be **enlightenment**.

To speak of **one aperture** is how distant you are!
Thus it was said before:
*"Wind and clouds, thunder and rain hide in the One,
Yet most fail to recognize this aperture’s law.
The Dragon’s ranks scatter with stripping and clashing,
Metal winds and Metal rains crash in thunderbolts.
If one can observe Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,
And grasp Heaven’s **actions (xíng)**,
Then self-knowledge is attained."*

When **Yin** and **Yang** are misaligned,
And *Qi*’s rhythms disrupt their order—
Either **Yang** overpowers **Yin**, bringing scorching drought,
Or **Yin** overpowers **Yang**, causing floods to rise—
The key lies in **summoning thunder**:
Balancing **Yin** and **Yang** to flow smoothly,
Directing **creation’s transformations (Zàohuà)** to circulate freely.
Turning the Dipper’s handle,
Calling thunder and rain to save the **parched and withered**;
Reversing the **Heavenly Aperture (Tiānguān)**,
Rousing **wind and thunder** to sweep away **Yin’s obscurations**.

Yet today’s scholars are scattered,
Most lacking **true teachers** to guide them.
They rely on **rumors and hearsay (dàotīngtúshuō)**,
Stealing scraps of **law and method (lòufǎ)**.
They do not seek the **ultimate treasure within their hearts**,
But only chase the **mysterious script on paper**.

Discussing **mysteries**, boasting of **wonders**,
Praising themselves while belittling others.
Their words are **pure**, yet their deeds are **filthy**,
Ignoring **Heaven’s decrees**—
Thus **Three Officials** strike their **tablets**,
**Five Emperors** list their **grievances**,
And after their **bodies perish**, their **souls fall into Yīndū**,
Suffering endless torments.
Ah! How difficult it is to **practice the law**—
Should one not fear it? Should one not fear it?

**Later learners**, take heed and strive anew.

On the **First Day of the First Month of Jiǎwǔ in Zhìyuán (至元甲午上元日)**,
A **later learner from Sōngjiāng (松江)**, **Thunder’s Scattering Official (Léitíng Sǎnlì)**, **Jǐngyáng Wěiyīn (景阳王惟一)**, recorded this.

I, a humble fool,
Dabbled in **Daoist methods**,
Once encountered a **true master** who taught me,
And I came to know a few of the **law’s secrets**.
I reflected on the **ancestral teachers’ words**:
*"The law moves through Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi*,
And must be wielded by your own **original spirit (yuánshén)**."*
This is a **direct pointing to the profound**, enlightening **later learners**.

Yet scholars with shallow insight,
Unable to awaken to its truth,
Instead fixate on **visualizing and imagining**—
Taking it as **mystery**.

Little did they know—
**Forsaking the root for the branch**,
**Abandoning truth for illusion**!

I too once failed to grasp this principle,
And sought only the **written teachings of enlightened masters**.
Some would **chant the "sob" (tí) sound**,
Swallowing it into the **elixir field (Dāntián)**,
Then **draw forth the "mocking" (cháo) sound**,
Imagining **golden light**—
This was their way of **Pre-Heaven’s single *Qi***.

Others would **harbor the spirit of Fire**,
**Store the essence of Water**,
And **intercourse at the Primordial Sea (Yuánhǎi)**,
Forming a **baby**, believing it their **original spirit**.

I did not follow such paths,
But through **painstaking effort**,
Fortunately met a **true teacher**,
Who revealed the **one aperture of thunder**,
Explaining these **principles**—
Awakening me from my **drunken haze**, dispelling all previous errors.

Later, I received **Master Yuèdǐng Mò’s** **messenger’s method**,
And he expounded on the **Pre-Heaven’s mysteries**.
He said:
*"The **Dao/Way** speaks of the space between Heaven and Earth—
Like a **bagpipe’s bellows (tuóqiào)**—
Empty yet never collapsing,
Stirred yet ever more abundant."*

「Just these *principles* are the pivotal mechanisms of **cosmic transformation (Zàohuà)**.
The *bellows* (Chōng) are like my belly,
The *mouth-nostril* (Tuó) are like my mouth and nose.
*"Empty yet never collapsing"* refers to the **Pre-Heaven’s Primordial *Qi*** (Yuánqì)—
The **Primordial Essence** of the Central Yellow.

The **Buddhist School** calls it the **Jewel of Wisdom, Precious Lamp of *Dharma*** (Huìrì Bǎodēng Mónízhū),
The **Confucian School** names it **Heavenly-Spontaneous *Qi*** (Hàorán zhī qì),
The **Chan School** labels it the **Place of Settling the Body and Establishing Life** (Ānshēn lìmìng chù),
And **Daoist Alchemists** term it **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān)—
Yet they are all one in essence.

It is also called the **Divine Chamber of Elixir**,
The **Root of Heaven and Earth**,
The **Source of All *Qi***,
The **Girdle of the Great Ultimate (Tàijí)**.

Its vast and boundless nature,
Its hazy and indistinct presence—
Without inner or outer,
Without attachment or foundation,
Nor even four directions—
*"Stirred yet never collapsing"* means:
When the *bellows* (tuó) are abandoned, the *mouth-nostril* (qiào) naturally emits a sound.

I, the humble one, received **Master Tiěbì’s** **Precepts** from **Zōu Jūn**:
*"Block the Heavenly River (Tiānhé),*
*Lift the Dipper’s Handle (Dǒubǐng),*
*Draw Water from the Stygian Depths (Cāngmíng),*
*Shake the Nine Regions (Jiǔzhōu),*
*Use the Heavenly Stem (Jiān) to supplement the Earthly Branch (Kūn),*
*And the *Li* hexagram to seal the *Kǎn* trigram.*
*Opening the eyes to gaze upward is **Yáng** (否→泰),*
*Closing them to observe internally is **Yīn** (泰→否)."*

Many fail to grasp the shortcuts of the **Dao/Way**,
Yet forcefully claim these **mysteries of the Ancients** (Xuān jī) as their own,
Establishing false sects—
How could they not err?

I have devoted my life to mastering **Thunder Dao** (Léifǎ),
Yet none have explained it as clearly as **Master Yuèdǐng Mò** (Mò Jūn).
His teachings make me ponder day and night,
Yet I cannot see him again—
Only sighing in disappointment.

While **Master** was alive,
Students flocked in confusion,
Yet few truly received his transmission—
For they did not know the **Dao/Way** at all.

Now in my old age,
I wish to leave these **secret precepts** (Mìjué) for the world,
But find no true listener to converse with—
Thus I compose these **illustrations**,
Naming them *"**Subtle Dao/Way Precepts** (Dàofǎ Jīngwēi)."*

**Illustration of Observing the Dao/Way Precepts:**
To **uphold the Dao/Way Precepts** (Xíngchí dàofǎ) is to begin and end with **one steadfast principle** (Rùnběi yīzhǐ),
And thus attain **transcendence** (Xiān).
For those who practice the **Dao/Way Precepts**,
They must first **receive and uphold the Ten Precepts** (Shíjiè).
In daily life, they must never falter.
If they further **alleviate greed and rescue suffering**,
And **accumulate merit through righteous actions** (Jīgōng lěixíng),
They will naturally move Heaven and Earth.

**Gods** will be reverent,
**Demons** will submit,
And they will command **Thunder Dao** (Léishén) to serve them—
Summoning winds and calling rains.

Yet there are some later disciples,
Who do not **uphold the precepts** (Chí lǜ),
Nor **discern right from wrong** (Biàn yézhèng),
But cling to words and symbols,
Concocting wild and chaotic thoughts.
If they experience a fleeting moment of inspiration,
They already deem themselves satisfied.
They do not investigate the **ultimate source of that inspiration**,
And thus **invite evil by their deeds**,
**Summon demons by their actions**.

Hence, **Master Sàzhēn** said:
*"The **Dao/Way Precepts** are not trifling—
Reflect on **upholding the precepts** and it will chill your heart.
Easier than a thousand-year iron tree blooming,
Harder than entering **Dàochéng** (邓都) to manifest in the world."*

He also said:
*"If your words are pure yet your actions are foul, do not speak of the **Dao/Way**,
For those who disregard the **Precepts of Heaven** (Tiāntiáo) merely engage in empty rituals."*

**Master Bǎoyī** was asked:
*"How does one **subdue evil** (Zhì yé)?"
He replied:
*"Cultivate yourself to become upright (Xiū jǐ yǐ zhèng).
If you do not hear of the **deceitful spirits of flowers and moonlight** (Huāyuè zhī yāo),
You will not dare to approach **Officer Liàng** (Gōng).*
**Upright individuals** are already feared by **ghosts and spirits**,
How much more so for those who practice the **Dao/Way Precepts**?"

In my *"**Heart Transmission Record** (Xīnchuán Lù)"* I wrote:
*"First, **uphold the precepts** as the foundation,
Then **guard the Precepts of Heaven** without recklessness.
To **attract the Thunder Spirit** (Léishén) and make it bow in submission,
The **Thunder Spirit’s** roar and lightning’s strike must pierce your heart and reveal its depths."*

**Illustration of the Heart’s Ten Thousand *Dharmas*:**
*"All *dharmas* arise from the heart,
All *dharmas* are extinguished by the heart.*
Understanding their origin and cessation,
The matter of **birth and death** is resolved."*

For the **heart** is the **master of the body**,
The **root of all *dharmas*** (Wànfǎ zhī gēn).
Its greatness knows no inner limit,
Its smallness knows no outer boundary.
When vast, it encompasses Heaven and Earth,
When minute, it hides within the finest hair.
Cultivate it, and you become **Buddha or Immortal** (Zuòfó chéngxiān),
Neglect it, and you turn into a **beast** (Pīmáo dài jiǎo).
Retain it within, and it becomes **inherent nature** (Xìng),
Project it outward, and it becomes **emotion** (Qíng).
Its transformations are endless,
Yet it has no fixed moment.

Thus the **Sages** taught:
*"To cultivate the heart is to cultivate the **Dao/Way**,
To cultivate the **Dao/Way** is to cultivate the heart."*

**Mencius** said:
*"Nurturing the heart is best done by **restraining desires** (Shǎo yù)."*

**Emperor Yáo** declared:
*"Heaven divides creation into **one central principle** (Yīzhōng),
Humans weave their **patterns of life** (Jīnglún) from the heart."*

**Master Xūqìng Tiānshī** taught:
*"When a single thought stirs within,
The **six senses** (Liùshí) flow outward.
If you do not **align with goodness** (Bèi shàn),
You will **align with evil** (Bèi è),
Thus inviting the **rewards of Heavenly Realms and punishments of Hellish States** (Yīn guǒ)."*

The *"**Great Dao Song** (Dàdào Gē)"* states:
*"Do not retain anything in the **Soul’s Platform (Língtái)**,
For if **things** linger in the heart, the **Spirit** is not pure.
This **dissipates True Essence** and weakens the **vitality of the sinews** (Jīnggǔ)."*

**The Three Pure Ones (Sān Máo Zhēnjūn)** said:
*"The **Soul’s Platform** is clear as an ice bucket,
Only the **Original Spirit** (Yuánshén) may dwell there.
If you retain anything within it,
Your entire life will be **impure**."*

**Master Bǎoyī** stated:
*"If a method comes from the same **Dao/Way gate** (Tóngmén),
Its **talismans** and **incantations** are identical,
Yet it proves ineffective—
It is because the **sincerity** is not complete.
If **sincerity** is incomplete,
Then **self-confidence** is insufficient,
And **doubt** arises—
The heart then has no **master** (Zhǔ).
If the heart has no **master**,
How can it **communicate with the divine** (Gǎn tōng)?
Thus it is said:
*"All methods are **heart methods** (Xīnfǎ),
If the heart is open, the methods will also be effective."*

In my *"**Clarifying the Dao/Way** (Míngdào)"* I wrote:
*"All things in the human world originate from the heart,
The heart’s essence is formless—where can one seek it?
Before a thought arises, one may grasp it,
Then one begins to truly see the heart."*

**Illustration of Pre-Heaven’s Original Essence:**
*"Faint and obscure, Pre-Heaven’s True Seed—
Use it, and it is unseen,
See it, and it is unheard.*

For **Essence** is the **Original Essence of Pre-Heaven** (Xiāntiān Yuánjīng),
The **mother of all things**.
Obtain it, and you live,
Lose it, and you die.
Thus, if **Essence** abides, **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** (Xiāntiān qì) abides,
If **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** abides, the **Spirit** (Shén) abides—
When these three abide, **my life is in my own hands** (Wǒ mìng wǒ),
Not in the hands of **Heaven**.

The *"**Heart Seal Scripture of the Jade Emperor** (Yùhuáng Xīnyìn Jīng)"* says:
*"Each person has their own **Essence**,
And **Essence** unites with their **Spirit**."*

**Master Dòngbīn** said:
*"Nourish **Essence** to cultivate the **Spiritual Root** (Línggēn),
Nourish **Pre-Heaven’s *Qi*** to cultivate the **Spirit** (Shén)—
This is the **true True Essence** (Zhēnzhēn),
Beyond which there is no greater truth."*

**Master Zǐyáng** taught:
*"If you break the **bamboo**, you must first mend the **bamboo**,
If you overturn the **chicken**, you must use the **egg** to restore it.
All efforts are in vain,
Yet you strive to **obtain True Lead** (Zhēnqiān) and **merge with the Sacred Mechanism** (Shèng jī)."*

The **Thunderous Adepts** must sever lust and extinguish desire,
Nurture the **Original Spirit** (Yuánshén),
Refine the **Golden Elixir** (Jīndān),
Command thunder and lightning,
Pray for rain or clear skies,
Heal sickness and subdue malevolence—
No power is beyond their reach.

Yet those who merely **clutch charcoal**—
How dare they speak of such things?

Thus **Master Sà** declared:
*"A single spark of **Sacred Light** (Língguāng) is the talisman itself—
Yet fools mistake ink and vermilion for its essence.
When **Original Essence** (Yuánjīng) does not scatter,
And **Original Yang** (Yuányáng) stands firm,
All demons and monsters are swept away."*

**Master Bǎoyī** said:
*"The talisman is the instrument of **Yin-Yang harmony** (Yīnyáng qìhé),
Only those of **utter sincerity** (zhìchéng) can wield it.
If sincerity is not absolute,
Its power remains inert.
Thus it is said:
*'With my **Essence**, I merge with the **Essence** of Heaven and Earth and all things.
With my **Spirit**, I merge with the **Spirit** of Heaven and Earth and all things.
**Essence** seeks **Essence**, **Spirit** leans on **Spirit**—
That is why even a scrap of paper,
When inscribed with **sincere intent**, can summon ghosts and gods.
For if the will is not true,
No talisman shall answer.'*

My *Heart-Transmitted Record* (Xīnchuán Lù) states:
*"What makes the **Law** so potent?
It lies within your **Essence, *Qi*, and Spirit**.
When **Essence** and **Qi** gather, **Spirit** is present—
Demons and monsters dissolve into dust."*

---
**The Primordial Black Diagram of Pre-Heaven**
*The talisman has no fixed form—
It is the **living *Qi*** of the **Golden Pill** (Huánwán),
Bringing peace to healing.
Breathe, and winds and clouds arise—
In an instant, issue commands,
And ghosts and gods tremble in awe.*

For **Qi** is the **Original *Qi*** of Pre-Heaven,
The **Root *Qi*** of all things.
Empty yet unyielding,
Moving yet ever flowing.

As the **Master** said in the *Systematic Classic* (Xìyì):
*"Heaven and Earth in vapory fusion,
All things refined in purity."*
Truly, the **Original *Qi*** of man
Resembles the **Qi** of Heaven and Earth.
With one **inhalation**, Heaven’s **Qi** descends;
With one **exhalation**, Earth’s **Qi** ascends.
Between breath and breath,
**Golden Liquid** is born, the form refined.
Form and **Spirit** both attain perfection,
Merging with the **Dao** and **True Reality**.

The *Heart Seal Scripture of the Jade Emperor* says:
*"Each person has their own **Qi**,
And **Qi** unites with the **True Body** (Zhēntǐ)—
Those who cannot hold fast to their **True Reality** (Zhēn)
Are but empty names."*

**Zhuangzi** taught:
*"The breath of ordinary men lingers in the throat,
But the **True Person’s** breath dwells in the heel."*

The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* (Sūwèn) states:
*"In stillness, purity—
**True *Qi*** follows naturally.
If one knows to **embrace whiteness** (báibǎi) and **guard *Qi***,
Moderate in food, cautious in speech,
And constantly stir the **Perverse Wind** (Xùnfēng) within the **Primordial Sea** (Yuánhǎi),
Then infinite marvels shall be received."*

Thus **Mencius**, roused by the crowing of a cock,
Diligently cultivated the **Boundless *Qi*** (Hàorán).

**Master Bǎoyī** declared:
*"To harmonize the **Three Powers** (Sāncái)—
It is but **one *Qi***.
Heaven moves by **Qi**,
Earth generates by **Qi**,
Yin and Yang expand and contract by **Qi**,
Wind and thunder arise by **Qi**.
**Qi** is mastered by man—
External thoughts do not intrude,
Internal thoughts do not stray.
With single-minded harmony,
Return to the **Root** and reclaim the **Mandate**,
Moving, resting, or sitting—
Endlessly nurturing the **Boundless**,
Applying it to **Law**,
Merging my **True *Qi*** with Heaven and Earth’s creation.
Thus, a breath becomes cloud,
A sigh becomes thunder—
When wielded, the **Original Spirit** is spontaneously potent,
And demons cower in submission.
Piercing Heaven, traversing Earth,
In myriad transformations—
Who dares defy me?"*

My *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:
*"The **Primordial *Qi*** builds the **Elixir Field**—
In stillness, wisdom dawns.
Sealed within, the curtain drawn,
Yet the **Soundless Flute** (wúkǒng dí) plays unseen."*

---
**The Primordial Spirit Diagram of Pre-Heaven**
*"To walk or sit together—
It lies right before you.
Do not stray from this truth."*

*"To perceive it—you cannot see,
To hear it—you cannot hear.
Its transformations are boundless,
Its coming and going unrestricted.

When pure and serene, it abides;
When turbulent and chaotic, it vanishes.
Thus, the *Jade Sovereign Heart-Seal Scripture* states:
‘The Spirit can enter stone,
The Spirit can take flight in form.’

The Most High says:
‘The **Great Dao** cannot be conveyed through words or received by mouth,
Yet it must be attained through an empty heart and tranquil Spirit—
The Dao comes of itself.

The foolish do not know this,
So they exhaust their bodies,
Torment their minds,
Conscript their wills,
Agitate their Spirits—
And the Dao only recedes further.

The *Daoist Virtue* says:
‘The Spirit of the Valley does not die,
This is called the **Mysterious Mother** [Xuānmǔ].
The **Mysterious Mother’s Gate**,
This is called the **Root of Heaven and Earth** [Tiāndì zhī gēn].
The **Master of Emptiness and Stillness** says:
‘If the Spirit departs, then quickly summon it back.
When the Spirit returns to the body’s *Qi*, it spontaneously recycles itself.
Thus, day after day, evening after evening,
The **True Infant** [Zhēnzǐ] bears the **True Embryo** [Zhēn tāi] naturally.’

The **One True Person** says:
‘In the world, there are those who close their eyes and store the Spirit,
Fantasizing that it will emerge from some direction.
Others twitch their pens and writhe their bodies,
Manipulating internal *Qi* to merge with external *Qi*—
Alas, how deluded!

If the Spirit is obtained,
Its potency will naturally manifest.
Just reside in stillness,
And on days of leisure, cultivate the Spirit—
When tranquil, the Spirit will spontaneously awaken.
Harmonize the **Polar *Qi*** [Chōng qì],
And the *Qi* will naturally become true.
Apply it in action and practice,
And the Spirit will naturally merge.
When Spirit and *Qi* merge,
A single thought or movement,
The Spirit’s **Officials and Soldiers** [Shìbīng] surge forth,
As if present at your side.’

My *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:
‘Only when the **Numinous Platform** [Língtái] is pure and clear,
Can one truly perceive it.
The slightest dust obscures it—
To transcend birth and death, it must be eternally preserved.
Yet common mortals fail to recognize its face.’

---

**The Primordial Spirit Diagram of the Pre-Heaven Mysterious Pass**

‘This Pass is the **Primordial Spirit’s Gate** [Xuānguān],
The **Mysterious Pass** [Xuānguān]—
Within it lie concealed the yin and yang of Heaven and Earth,
The sun, moon, and stars,
The Three Elements and Eight Trigrams,
The Four Symbols and Five Phases,
The Twenty-Four *Qi* [Èrshísì qì],
The Seventy-Two Constellations [Sìshí'èr hòu],
The winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain—
All are contained therein.

The **One True Person** says:
‘To write talismans without knowing the Pass,
Is to invite the laughter of demons and spirits.’

Today’s practitioners of Daoist **Law** and **Method** [Fǎxíng],
Not attaining the **Root Source** of Dao and Law,
Falsely labor over paper and ink,
Taking talismans and Passes as mere symbols.
Yet they do not know—
This is no ordinary Pass,
It is forged by the union of **Heaven and Earth** [Gānyuán],
Named the **Spirit-*Qi* Cavern** [Shénqì xué],
Within which lies the **Kan-Li Essence** [Kǎnlí jīng].
It must be sought from within yourself,
Not from others.

The **Jade Hare True Person** says:
‘This Pass truly resides in the center,
Within the center lies another center.
From here, all Spirits emerge,
Ascending directly to merge with Heaven.’

The **Purple Yang True Person** says:
‘In the body’s midst lies one Pass called the **Mysterious Mother** [Xuānmǔ].
This is neither the heart nor the kidneys,
Neither the mouth nor the nose,
Neither the spleen nor the stomach,
Nor the **Grain Path** [Gǔdào],
Nor the **Bladder** [Pángguāng],
Nor the **Elixir Field** [Dāntái],
Nor the **Mud Pellet** [Níwán].
To know this Pass is to know that it lies at the **Winter Solstice** [Dōngzhì],
That medicines are found here,
That the **Fire Refining** [Huǒhòu] is here,
That the **Bathing in Essence** [Mùyù] is here,
That the **Embryo’s Formation** [Jiētái] is here.
My *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:
‘One Pass, void and mysterious—
The **Root of Heaven and Earth** [Tiāndì zhī gēn],
Endless and dense, no wind passes through.
Faint and distant, yet encompassing all phenomena,
The **True Person** appears within the **Jewel of the Mysterious Pass** [Bǎozhū].’

**The Diagram of Pre-Heaven Primordial *Qi***

‘When the moon reaches the **Heavenly Heart** [Tiānxīn],
When the wind stirs the **Water’s Surface** [Shuǐmiàn],
To know the **True Essence’s Meaning** [Duān de yì],
The **Big Dipper’s Handle points to the Void and Danger** [Dǒubǐng zhǐ xū wēi].

Ah, the **Pre-Heaven Primordial *Qi*** [Xiāntiān yī qì],
Before the **Supreme Ultimate** [Tàijí] has yet divided,
When all things are yet unborn—
Vast and boundless,
Faint and unfathomable,
Formless and symbol-less,
Unattached and without abode,
Motionless and still,
Filling the **Great Emptiness** [Tàixū],
Beyond knowledge or words.
Wondrous indeed, as **Huángléi Yuān** says:
‘One mixed substance, originally **Pre-Heaven**,
The **Ultimate Dao** is void and natural in its logic.
If one attains it before all things arise,
Who would not be a **Great Sage of the Dao** [Dàluó xiān]?’

**Master Wáng’s** *Poem of Wandering and Pacification* says:
‘To study the Dao and refine the True,
One must recognize the True.
The **Pre-Heaven Primordial *Qi*** is inherent in my body—
Guard it, and the Dao is attained;
Apply it, and the **Law** is fulfilled.
The **Law** responds to the void—
Only the Spirit is its power.’

The **One True Person** says:
‘Someone asks: How does the distinction between **Pre-Heaven** and **Post-Heaven** [Xiāntiān/Hòutiān] stand?
The Master replies:
‘If one speaks of **Pre-Heaven**, it is **One**—
A forced name, for the Dao itself is without distinction.
What are all the incantations?
They belong to **Post-Heaven** as soon as one begins to move.
Talismans, diagrams, seals, and formulas—
These are but the **end** of things.
My *Heart-Transmitted Record* says:
‘The **Pre-Heaven Dao** is beyond words.
The moment one speaks, it belongs to **Post-Heaven**.
Scholars flock and ask—
Who among them grasps the meaning before all things arise?’

---

**The Diagram of One’s Own Original Spirit**

‘The Dao—is it yours or mine?
No trifles, only the **Single Thread** [Yī sī] of your own self.
A thousand transformations are concealed by others,
Yet thirty years have passed before I pierced through the deception.

Ah, the **Own Original Spirit** [Zìjǐ yuánshén],
Is the **body** of the **Pre-Heaven Primordial *Qi*** [Xiāntiān yī qì].
The **Pre-Heaven Primordial *Qi***,
Is the **function** of the **Own Original Spirit** [Zìjǐ yuánshén].
Thus, the Spirit never departs from the *Qi*,
And the *Qi* never departs from the Spirit.
The Spirit is the **child** of the *Qi*,
And the *Qi* is the **mother** of the Spirit—
Child and mother are intimate,
Like magnet and iron,
Never to be separated for an instant.

To contain it becomes **Golden Elixir** [Jīndān],
To release it becomes **Officials and Soldiers** [Shìbīng].
Thus, **Master Zhōng** says:
‘Ten thousand words and a thousand teachings urge later generations,
Do not seek the True in external things—
Boring through Heaven, descending to Earth, relying on whose strength?
The **marvelous uses** of **Spirit-Penetration** [Shén tōng] must come from the Spirit itself.’

**Master Pīyún** says:
‘When my body moves, Spirits and Immortals arise—
Not from toiling over the mind or manipulating thoughts.’

**Master Wáng Shìchén** says:
‘To exhaust the Spirit all day in vain discussions of emptiness,
Is not as good as returning to rest within the **Embryo** [Tāi].
The **Dao** endlessly flows, naturally communicating itself,
The **Three Elements** and **Five Elders** [Sān yuán/Wǔ lǎo] are born from this very function.
My **True Person** is neither in the West nor in the East,
Yet I always teach that a **gentle wind** arises within the body.
People see one thing but fail to recognize another—
Each time they store the thought, it becomes void again.’

The **Jade Hare True Person** says:
‘When the mind moves, the person follows in the blink of an eye—
Why labor over storing and summoning such difficulty?
To grasp the **logic of the Five Phases’ Generation and Pacification** [Wǔxíng shēngkè],
The **thunder and rain of the palm** [Zhǐ shōng yǔ] are in accord with the **Golden Elixir** [Jīndān].’

Master Liu says:
‘Not law, not emptiness, not form—
No shape, no mark, no sentiment.
The Dao is but one pure thing, clear and limpid—
What need for idle names or sectarian labels?

When it moves, ghosts and spirits cower in concealment;
When it stirs, heaven and earth merge in union.
You cannot see it, cannot hear it—
Yet when silently applied, it responds in kind.

From my *Record of Heart Transmission*:
Each person holds within them a boundless *Qian* and *Kun*,
Where stands a towering, singular Sovereign.
He governs all spirits across the Three Realms in submission,
Yet they know not they waste their vital essence and spirit.

**Drilling the Five Phases Diagram:**
Spirit, soul, ether, mind—
Drill them back to the *Kun* position.
No need to stir a hair—
Naturally, thunder and rain arrive.

Now, the numbers one, two, three, four—
These are the *Five Phases’* generative digits of heaven,
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten—
The completed numbers of earth.

Humans inherit the generative and completed numbers of heaven and earth’s *Five Phases*,
Thus heaven has the Five Stars,
Earth has the Five Sacred Peaks,
And humans have the Five Viscera.

Within the Five Viscera lie spirit, soul, ether, mind—
These coalesce into the Five Thunders.
Among the Five Thunders, earth holds preeminence,
For it draws upon the primordial *hun* of the Central Yellow—
The ancestral *qi* of the Preheaven Undifferentiated.

Thus, Master Preserve-One says:
‘The marvelous law harmonizes with yin and yang,
Square and round, motion and stillness—
Thus the Dao permeates all.’

The Three Powers—heaven, earth, and humanity—
Respond to the *Five Phases* as water, fire, wood, metal, and earth,
Circulate through the five directions—east, south, west, north, and center,
And correspond to the eight trigrams: thunder, wind, mountain, water, fire, heaven, earth, and lake.

Those ensnared by numerology say:
*“When I inscribe a talisman for a certain matter,
You must activate it at a specific orifice—
Thus do we engage with Nature’s transformations,
Thus do we speak of Generation and Pacification,
Thus do we draw the brush,
Thus do we unleash the surge—
And I have mastered the mechanisms of ghosts and spirits.”*

Yet they do not realize:
Before the *Tai Ji* differentiated,
Which was yin, which was yang?
Which were the Three Powers?
Which were the *Five Phases*?
Which were the Eight Trigrams?

Thus, those who grasp the Dao abandon their reliance on talismans and seals.

From my *Record of Heart Transmission*:
One, two, three, four, five—
Earth holds primacy in the center.
Master the logic of life and death,
And thunder and rain rise at your command.

**The Diagram of Returning to the Root and Restoring Life:**
When all yin is exhausted, return to the single stroke—
Yang is born, and heaven and earth emerge from the heart of heaven and earth.
The heart of heaven and earth—
To grasp the true transformation within,
To command thunder, enslave lightning,
And have ghosts and spirits stand in awe.

The wood of the East Three generates the fire of the South Two,
The metal of the West Four produces the water of the North One,
And the Central Earth harmonizes with the *Wu Ji* transformations of *Wu* and *Ji*.

If not for metal subduing wood and water countering fire,
Then winds, clouds, thunder, lightning, and rain would not arise.

Thus, the *Bao Yi Zhuren* says:
*"Zhuangzi spoke: 'The corpse lies still, yet the dragon appears in the depths;
Silent, yet thunder resounds.'"*

Those who know this Dao can speak of the mechanics of motion and stillness.

Master Shao said:
*"Between every motion and stillness lies the utmost subtlety of Heaven, Earth, and Man."*

For indeed, the use of motion and stillness lies in the extremes of yin and yang.

The *Classic of Changes* says:
*"At the extreme, transformation occurs; transformation brings harmony."*

Who but those who cultivate with true force can comprehend this?

From my *Record of Heart Transmission*:
*"Qi flows in cycles, coming and going—
Observe where yin and yang prevail.
Restore balance in all things—
This truth, with whom shall it be shared?"*

**The Diagram of Thunder and Lightning’s Essence:**
Thunder and lightning’s transformations are mastered within,
Heaven and Earth’s Three Powers move as one.
If scholars can penetrate this,
They command the heavens to bring rain or clear skies.

The Eight Trigrams encompass Heaven and Earth,
Fifteen lines arrayed, yet their essence lies in the Central Five.
Thus, thunder and lightning draw upon the central *qi* of Heaven and Earth,
And are called the Five Thunders.

For those who practice thunder’s art must:
Empty the heart while filling the belly,
Concentrate the spirit and guard the center,
Turning the transformations,
Commanding thunder and lightning,
Spreading sweet rains to save the people,
Their merit reaching Heaven—
How could this be called a minor achievement?

From my *Record of Heart Transmission*:
*"Transformations contain the *Tai Ji* within,
Since the divine function of waxing and waning began.
When the Six Yang numbers return to *Kun*,
Thunder and lightning surge from the *Kan Dragon*.
**The Diagram of Water and Fire’s Excitement and Subduction:**
Its subtlety requires no talismans or secret incantations—
Those who grasp this mechanism summon rain and thunder instantly."*

For the sun and moon are *Kan* and *Li*,
*Kan* and *Li* are water and fire,
Water and fire are *qi*,
And *qi* is matter.

In the South, it is fire; in the North, it is water.
Excessive fire-qi brings drought,
Excessive water-qi brings floods.

Water subdues fire, turning clear skies to rain,
Fire generates water, turning rain to clear skies.
Water and fire, when excited and subdued, become thunder and lightning,
Water and fire, when harmonized, bring clear and bright *qi*.

Yet fire’s excess and water’s vigor cannot be balanced.
Thus, my *Record of Heart Transmission* says:
*"Fire flourishes in *Li*, water thrives in *Kan*.
Water and fire must be balanced—
If one prevails, there is no mercy."*

**The Diagram of Yin and Yang’s Transformations:**
Motion and stillness never cease,
Yet return to the *Tai Ji*.
Without diligent practice,
How could one understand?

For *qi* in motion has purity and turbidity.
The pure ascends as yang,
The turbid descends as yin.
Yin and yang transform in myriad ways.

Thus, yin and yang’s ascent and descent form rain,
Yin and yang’s excitement produce thunder,
Yin and yang’s condensation become lightning,
Yin and yang’s relaxation yield snow,
Weak yin and strong yang bring wind,
Strong yin and weak yang bring clouds,
Excessive yin and scattered yang bring dew,
Suppressed yin and condensed yang bring frost,
Obstructed yin and yang bring hail,
Unbalanced ascent and descent bring fog,
Uncontrolled *sha-qi* brings pestilence,
Perverse *qi* clashing with the true brings *sha*,
Excessive water transforms into *ni* (halo),
Excessive fire transforms into *chi* (dark clouds).

Those who practice thunder must not be ignorant of these principles.

Thus, my *Record of Heart Transmission* says:
*"Qi cycles through purity and turbidity—
The pure ascends, the turbid descends; balance is key.
Excessive yin and deficient yang bring prolonged rain,
Excessive yang and deficient yin bring lasting clear skies."*

King Zhen’s *Manting Fang*:
*"With resolute sincerity in the Dao,
Diligently cultivating the Way,
All greenery is seen through as emptiness.
Within the cauldron of the Great Void,
A jade lotus is nurtured.
Transformed into a divine pearl, radiant,
Illuminating a thousand peaks.
The eternal spring scene—
On the Five-Cloud Platform,
Jade oranges glow red against the sky.
These wondrous principles, if met with fate,
Truly, a thousand miles apart, yet untainted by dust,
Pure and clear, revealing true function.
Daily, the head remains unclouded,
Transcending birth and death,
Beyond the Three Realms’ grasp,
Free and at ease, everywhere a celestial palace.
A single point of yang essence,
Paired in the yin position,
The Five Phases and Four Symbols complete—
Suddenly, forms emerge,
Dazzling, boundless.
Divine water frequently irrigates,
Within the Three Fields,
Warm fire simmers and brews.
Knowing this,
At the gate of entry, essence and function merge,
The mind stilled in gentle repose.
Within lies the golden serpent and jade seal,
Thunder and rain summoned in the heart-field—
Do you know?
The rules of the immortals:
When practice reaches three thousand,
The law lies in the preheaven’s profound mystery,
Unspeakable, yet rooted in centrality and rectitude.

The spiritual platform gleams, motionless in stillness,
Yet responsive and harmonious.
Relying on firmness and vigor,
Commanding wind and thunder,
Praying for rain and snow,
Subduing ghosts and spirits, banishing demons—
This alone is the way,
Neither incantation, nor talisman, nor *gangjue*.

The *Tai Ji* spirit dwells within the *Yuan Gu*,
Preheaven *qi* resides in the *Xuan Guan* orifice.
Diligently preserve the spirit in emptiness and stillness,
And upon completion, one joins the ranks of the immortals.

Behold the Great Void—
Steadily riding the auspicious clouds,
Approaching the Golden Gate.
The Dao’s heart transmission is complete."
