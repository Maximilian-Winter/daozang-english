**Title:** *Li Feng Lao Ren Ji* (Collected Works of the Old Man of Departed Peak). Composed by Jin Quanzhen Daoist Yu Daoxian. Two volumes. Source text: *Zhengtong Daozang*, Orthodox Section, Part One.

**Seven-Character Regulated Verse**

**Reflections**
By the western crags of Emerald Cliff, the Daoist’s home,
Beyond the gate, idle fields and wildflowers grow.
Butterflies flutter—still but a dream,
Wandering bees dart—yet courtly cares remain.
A boy in the clouds bears elixirs divine,
While immortals in the void tread rainbow shine.
Idle, I muse on red-dust seekers of fame,
Unknowing the boundless skies within the gourd’s frame.

**Again**
Vague mists veil the verdant peaks in gray,
Falling leaves drift past the eaves this day.
Few worldly affairs—dreams and soul are light,
The azure vault spans, stars sparse in the night.
Frost chills the stream, fish refuse the bait,
Bare mountains stand, trees stripped of their state.
The Daoist passes days in careless ease,
While outside his gate, the clamor never ceases.

**Again**
When will the red dust’s rush ever end?
I wander beyond, free as the wind.
Fair waters and mountains stretch without cease,
Rare blossoms and fruits in tranquil peace.
Breezes brush the herb garden, fragrance fine,
Moonlight gilds the lingzhi fields in purple shine.
Leisurely by streams and woods I hide,
Why fret the world’s woes, knitting the brow’s pride?

**Again**
Gazing south to the mountains, loftier than the sky,
Mist-wreathed peaks rise, the heavens nigh.
Since ancient times, immortals hide their trace,
To this day, feathered scholars seek long life’s grace.
The world’s rise and fall shift through time’s tide,
Clouds surge and fade, dark and bright abide.
Only the ancient pines and rugged stone remain,
Evergreen through the seasons, unchanged, sustain.

**Again**
The enlightened transcend life and death’s decree,
Mastering the subtle, they move with boundless glee.
Manifest—like moon unveiled through parting cloud,
Hidden—like pearl cradled in the oyster’s shroud.
Inwardly, the radiant spirit shines bright,
Fiercely, the alchemical furnace burns with light.
Forged is the golden elixir, day and night,
Ten thousand crimson flames gleam in the crystal’s sight.

**Again**
Heat departs, cold arrives—qi flows as fate,
West winds herald the osmanthus’ blooming state.
Trees stand bare, birds nest in branches high,
Frost descends, waters chill, fish dive nigh.
Cloud-bound friends from beyond the world appear,
While the cave’s reclusive guest slumbers deep and clear.
A staff of jade taps, its chime crisp and bright,
Rousing the dreamer from Huaxu’s flight.

**Again**
I do not study mysteries or seek Chan’s gate,
A simple hut in the woods is my fate.
Heavenly music drifts in the empty air,
Beyond the world, the Way and virtue are my care.
By fragrant grasses, I sleep at ease,
Woodcutters’ songs drift with the sunset’s breeze.
This body has yet to ride the phoenix away,
So I wander free as an earthbound immortal’s play.

**On Others Mocking My Madness**
Fools laugh that I’m too wild, too strange—
But do they know this madness’ range?
I’ve sworn with gulls on dreamlit shores,
And followed deer through misted moors.
Beneath three rods of sun, I sleep,
While men hum tunes on dusty streets so deep.
Returning to my homeland’s peace,
I watch them raise their wars on common ground with ease.

**Casual Verse**
Light as wind, my sleeves dance in azure skies,
Once I rode with Hong Ya to caverned paradise.
I drove the phoenix down with magic herbs in hand,
And perched upon the jade-tree where cranes command.
Purple mist breathes flames around the alchemical flame,
Bright moon’s glow crowns the sacred lotus’ frame.
As my jasper pendants brush the earth so low,
The Golden Lad descends with Heaven’s decree in tow.

**Yin Xia Pavilion**
A perilous pavilion pierces clouded heights,
Its twelve balustrades command boundless sights.
Turn your head—the mortal world shrinks to a grain,
Yet sometimes heaven’s breath plays the flute’s refrain.
Distant peaks layer their emerald at treetops’ crest,
Willows sway in winds with ten thousand threads dressed.
So near, yet none tread the misted path below—
The immortal’s road to Penglai is not far, I know.

**For Others**
To be Buddha or immortal lies within the heart,
Can one waste this life in dust’s dark art?
The Way seems distant, time slips by in vain,
While fleeting years carve labor’s endless chain.
Drunk on fame and profit, thick as wine,
Yet never guard the spirit’s gold divine.
The zither’s three-fold song stirs the immortal’s dance—
I’ll make it the maxim by my seat’s advance.

**For the Lost Seeker**
Six windows open to the sky’s pure light,
Break all barriers—this is true insight.
The Great Dao’s path is ever straight and clear,
Yet lost ones wander where they need not fear.
Every road leads to Chang’an’s gate,
Yet none escape the boundless desert’s weight.
Cast aside your books, your burdens lay—
Where else to seek the sheep that strayed away?

**In Reply**
One asked me of the Mystic Pearl’s glow—
A single spark of light fills the jade jar’s flow.
From ancient past to now, it never fades,
Before heaven and earth, it never strayed.
Within the six dusts, the True Lord abides,
Atop the Seven Treasures’ peak, the false self hides.
Who grasps this lineage’s truth with ease,
Needs no cloud-chariot to ride the breeze.

**Again**
Awakened, I brush off fame and dust,
A carefree soul in freedom’s trust.
By streams I pledge with waterfowl,
In forests, I sleep on moss so cool.
Endless worldly cares will never cease,
Foolish men chase shadows, blind to peace.
They see only life and death before their eyes,
Unknowing the eternal spring the gourd supplies.

**To Master Lang, the Recluse**
A decade has passed since we parted ways,
Yet time flows on, and Dao remains always.
You veil your light, hide your truth so deep,
Yet meet the world with wisdom’s leap.
Beyond the fields, your life takes root,
By rivers and clouds, your spirit’s mute.
A hundred years hence, your home will rise,
Your name in purity through endless skies.

**For Prefect Zhang**
Do not cling to fleeting splendor—know your self,
Nurture tranquility to guard your inner wealth.
The dream within the dream is all you see,
Awake, you’ll find the self beyond the self to be.
In the gourd, plant the shadowless tree,
In the cave, grasp spring before its spree.
The vulgar crowd will never understand,
While heaven’s radiance shines, ever grand.

**Secluded Dwelling**
Beyond my door, clear streams; above, the mountain stands,
Here I dwell in leisure, free from worldly bands.
Books shield my eyes when reading’s due,
Fame and profit—guests I never pursue.
A thousand bamboo shoots I’ve grown,
Two or three thatched huts I’ve sown.
Clouds remain my steadfast friends,
At dusk they gather, at dawn they wend.

**For Little Zhang, the Immortal**
Children point and laugh at my coarse robe’s sway,
Yet immortal garb is just the same in heaven’s array.
Cranes cry in azure skies, clouds drift slow,
Phoenixes sing at the moonlit palace’s glow.
Golden Lads from the Purple Court share jade’s grace,
Jade Maidens roll the elixir’s sphere in that place.
Yesterday, the Jade Emperor’s decree came down—
Your name is written in the immortal’s crown.

**For the Abbot of Yu Xi Hermitage**
The Daoist’s feet stir clouds as he goes,
Seeking freedom beyond worldly woes.
He brushes the yellow dust from his gown,
And rests his moonlit staff as he roams the town.
Peaks rise like paintings from the plain,
Their chill purity strikes the soul again.
Here I’d stay forever, let the world pursue
Its fleeting gains—what are they to me and you?

**For Abbot Yang of Shi Wo Hermitage**
Who knows the fallen man is truly bold?
In mortal eyes, wealth and rank are cold.
Beside clouds and waters, he finds his rest,
Content with frugal fare, his lot the best.
When things arise, his heart stays clear as glass,
Though men may laugh, he wears his folly’s mask.
Vast and empty, the void knows no screen—
A single pearl gleams in the azure sheen.

**To Zhang Guan, Who Wishes to Leave the World**
Man of resolve, do not hesitate,
Seek the true root ere it’s too late.
When the Great Dao is grasped, all fades to still,
The floating life dissolves in dust’s chill.
Through temporary forms, refine the elixir’s art,
Borrow the spirit to forge the sacred heart.
Free from yin and yang, beyond creation’s sway,
The primordial One illumines the mind’s array.

**To Abbot Li**
The heart roams free, the qi flows in harmony,
Let the world’s storms rage endlessly.
The jade wheel’s light will soon be full and bright,
The precious sword still needs the whetstone’s bite.
Cut through the karmic vines that block the way,
Soon you’ll dance beneath the cinnamon’s sway.
All turns to gold in radiant unity,
Filling heaven and earth—no need for more, you see.

**To Liu Erguan of Songzhou**
Worldly fame and wealth are but fleeting things,
Honor and glory—mere mortal flings.
Awake, it’s all a moment’s dream,
Enlightened, no praise or scorn can seem.
The moon’s jewel shines for all to see,
Yet in the sea’s depths, its light burns free.
The world’s noble men hold kindness dear—
Take your heart and advance another year.

**For Director Han**
Fate and effort each have their cause,
No need for sighs or bitter pause.
Heaven’s net is vast, its mesh wide,
Yet the subtle hinge moves, unseen, inside.
Moon waxes and wanes by cosmic decree,
Yin and yang’s dance—who’s near, who’s free?
I see creation as a fleeting dream,
Who then is the one who wakes from this scheme?

**For Madam Liu**
Leap from the red dust, make your break complete,
With heart serene and will unshaken, sweet.
The precious sword’s glow chills a thousand flames,
The jade flower blooms, all other blossoms wane.
From the Purple Court, the True One descends,
Cloud chariots and moonlit seats, banners extend.

The Elixir gleams in the palm, illumining the Great Void—
No need now for golden dust to employ.

**For Lord Hu of Wanshu**
Achieve your work, attain your name, then early retreat to the mountains,
To gain a body at peace and a heart even more at ease.
Look back on the red dust—truly a dark dream,
Yet no magic medicine can stay the crimson face.
Dwelling by Peng Isle, how could one remain vulgar?
The gate set in misty vines needs no lock to close.
Suddenly a golden pellet leaps forth,
Outshining all who come and go, questioning men.

**For Commander Jiagu**
Gain and loss, poverty and success—let them follow nature,
No need for joy or the torment of worry.
This life’s wealth and rank were sown in past lives,
Present cultivation reaps the past’s green.
At Broadview Slope, a moment’s delight,
At Du Post, how many faults were made?
When will the cycle of retribution end?
Learn from me to cultivate the immortal beyond the world.

**For Vice Commissioner Zhang**
Do not cling to fleeting splendor, lest desire’s realm encroach,
The immortal isles of Peng and Hu grow ever harder to find.
The alchemical terrace and divine furnace lie buried in dust,
The moonlit palace’s magic mushrooms overrun by wild grass.
If you ask what exhausts endless affairs,
How does it compare to awakening the original heart?
Diligently apply yourself for three thousand days,
And refine within the gourd a well of gold.

**For the Daoist**
To study the Dao, first still all perceptions and knowledge,
Among the crowd, silence is most fitting.
Do not rely on the sixty-four as profound mystery,
Nor debate the three-in-one as rigid grasp.
Clarify the spirit’s source to see hidden depths,
Open the eye of wisdom to recognize the subtle and unseen.
Probe the root, secure the stem—this is the art of long life,
Leading to non-action where nothing is left undone.

**For Abbot Zhang**
Long ago I heard of the ancient immortals,
Who dwelt in nests and caves, their legacy enduring to this day.
People like wild deer, knowing no gratitude,
Above like treetops—so naturally they lived.
Good and evil both forgotten, roaming the vast expanse,
Death and life as one, all distinctions dissolved.
When will the balance be shattered, the measure split?
When the primordial chaos transforms to form this heaven.

**For Supervisor Zhai, the Unrestrained**
Today I meet the unrestrained wanderer Zhai,
When shall we keep each other company in the groves and springs?
Achieve your work, attain your name, then withdraw,
Conceal your traces, veil your light—your place will naturally be secluded.
In the cauldron of chaos, refine the great medicine,
In the crucible of primordial mist, boil the golden lead.
Once the elixir is complete and consumed, ascend to the origin,
Attaining the land of Huayang, the unending day.

**For the Assembly Leaders**
Time is limited, like a candle in the wind,
Life is uncertain, like spittle on water.
Remember that the crimson face must fade,
Do not let white hair arrive too soon.
Let greed and desire for love be worn away,
In the wondrous realm of the subtle, search carefully.
Enter the great boundless sea of perfect enlightenment,
And roam freely in the land of Great Peace.

**For Wen Dihan, the Enlightened Daoist**
Long heard of in the past, today we meet,
As we sit and speak, suddenly a spring breeze arises.
Qi harmonious, peach blossoms bloom on your face,
Spirit settled, the elixir in the furnace glows red.
The infant and maiden entwine, returning to the Purple Court,
Tiger and dragon unite, entering the Palace of Fire.
Carefree upon the sea, seeking the mystery’s key,
The path to Penglai is but a thread’s width away.

**For Master Heshilie**
Steadily, freely, the body at ease,
Together we laugh and talk, leaving the red dust behind.
The journey to the Three Mountains is sure and steady,
Harmonious qi melts into a spring of ten months.
Below Lu, incense divides as plum blossoms open,
South of the river, green enters the willow tips anew.
If you are willing to come here and cultivate together,
You will not become a dreamer in a life of toil.

**For Zhai, the Unrestrained**
Only in great awakening does one know the great dream is over,
Then ride the transformations of things, roaming at will.
Spirit like a crane freed from the clouds,
Body like a boat unbound on rivers and lakes.
Profound principles found in withered wood,
Luxuriance all given to the flowing blossoms.
Now no longer concerned with action or concealment,
Like the frog’s croak or the whale’s surge—truly free.

**Following Another’s Rhyme**
Amid clouds and sea, meeting a man of the Dao,
His spirit like autumn waters, clear and bright.
He comes riding a white deer to the Three Isles,
Goes astride a green luan to visit the Five Perfected.
In the crucible, the thousand-year medicine is refined,
Within his nature, the six sensory dusts are swept away.
The master has already attained the arts of immortals—
Virtue is not solitary; it must have neighbors.

**For Lord Wang**
Hair like a crane, beard like frost—this man of a different age,
Willing to come here to speak of eternal spring.
Plant well the withered tree in the moon’s light,
Refine within the gourd the priceless truth.
If you can complete the repair of heaven and earth’s flaw,
Why bother casting a body of chaff and husks?
You must reach Penglai—once you do,
You may keep company with the immortals of the grass.

**For the Astronomer’s Judge**
Amid the bustling dust, awakening to the one truth,
Like a tumbleweed, becoming a body at liberty.
Releasing the crane in the blue clouds, the heart unstruck,
Hiding the pearl in the Red River, the Dao not poor.
Within the gourd, the towers and terraces of the Three Isles,
In the cave, flowers and trees in four seasons of spring.
Where blue luan and white crane soar,
The golden and azure radiance is ever new.

**For Yan, the Young Immortal**
The young are to be revered—I pity you,
Vitality in full bloom—have you no fear?
Briefly lingering in the splendor of the world,
Wasting effort on the black dye of cultivation.
Heart like iron and stone, yet straying from the original vow,
The sun near the mulberry and elm—losing the later plan.
But if you keep this heart alert and cautious,
In secret, sages and worthies will surely aid you.

**For Daoist Li**
Clarity and emptiness can refine the steadfast Daoist heart,
Solitude and silence can darken the perfect wisdom.
Gold and jade filling the hall are ultimately abandoned things,
A single grain of cinnabar elixir can extend the years.
In the world, men greedily chase fleeting dreams,
Beyond things, who knows the transformations of the Dao?
If you can turn your head and grasp this principle,
You will see within the casing an immortal take flight.

**Exhortation to the World**
Fleeting fame, fleeting profit—all is transient,
The heart’s entanglements must cease sooner or later.
Devoted to schemes, forgetting the days,
When has wealth and rank ever reached the withered skull?
Turning back from the mountain of treasures—too late,
Struggling to emerge from the boundless bitter sea.
Life hangs by a thread, like a puppet,
Not knowing that men play at being romantic.

**Passing Lianchang Palace**
Lianchang’s palaces now lie in level sands,
No sight of phoenixes ascending—only crows.
Still, Song Peak stands at the end of the trees,
Endless, the Luo River flows to the edge of the sky.
The *Rainbow Skirts* dance finished, mountain birds sing,
The Upright Tower empty, wild grasses bloom.
A thousand ages of splendor cannot be retained,
Now the reclusive Daoist claims this quiet dwelling.

**For Daoist Shi**
The petty pursuit of fame and profit—an ancient and modern passion,
Gained with alarm, lost with alarm.
In the butterfly’s dream, no ultimate awakening,
In the white colt’s gap, competing for fleeting glory.

**At Tong Mountain and Golden Vale**

The imperial favor at Tong Mountain—an ode lasting a thousand years,
The perilous towers of Golden Vale—leveled in a single day.
How much better to follow the Daoist, retiring to rest,
Passing one’s life by the waterside, beneath the forest’s shade.

**Again**

On the *Pillow of Transcendence*, the dream first stirs awake,
Bamboo hut’s breeze brushes the face, so crisp and clear.
Already the watchman’s drum turns beyond the flickering light,
Now the Dipper’s tail slants across the treetops’ edge.
Worldly dust dissolves without a trace,
When dragon and tiger meet, their roar resounds of itself.
Unsheathing a single grain of golden light from the purple brush,
It soars and plunges—even ghosts and spirits stand in awe.

**To Master Guo of the Hermitage**

Fleeting life scatters like leaves from the bough,
Half a century’s span already slipped away.
Beyond the dust, green mountains stretch in vain longing,
While white hairs at the temples multiply.
The year draws late—how can one feel no sorrow?
You do not return—what can be done?
I have sealed my pact with the gulls of the sand,
This time, do not again betray the rippling waves.

**For Qu’s Abbot**

A single *qi*, vast and boundless, emerges from the void,
Already it divides and governs yin and yang.
It carves creation’s work as the primal ancestor,
Embracing emptiness, all things flourish.
In motion, its mystery responds to change,
In stillness, the empty chamber radiates celestial light.
Disciples, do not seek its traces—
Recognize true emptiness as the Dharma King.

**For Officer Kang**

How does serving as an official compare to studying immortality?
In perfect stillness, perfect purity, nurture the vast *qi*.
Daily in the jade crucible, refine the great elixir,
Hourly in the golden cauldron, temper the red lead.
Auspicious vapors rise to the clear heavens,
Golden lotuses bloom, veiled in purple mist.
When merit is complete, ascend to the Moon Palace,
And together we shall journey to the Great Brahma Heaven.

**To Zhang the Commander**

For years you pledged with me to retreat to the groves and springs,
Yet in an instant, empty fame has ensnared you.
Though the frontier sands press close, your resolve remains,
The Jasper Pool is not far—only the greening has yet to come.
To linger in clouded valleys is the Daoist’s way,
To wield generals’ power is the hero’s prerogative.
Wait until the day your work is done and name achieved,
Then withdraw and once more attain the Great Brahma Immortal.

**For Pu Cha, Abbot of Songzhou**

The supreme Dao of the Primordial Origin speaks no words,
In serene tranquility and pure emptiness, all is natural.
Within the gourd, a new world unfolds,
In the cave, the Three Isles part from the mountains and streams.
Lord Ding’s mercury, unwed, departs the palace,
The jade maiden’s lead lies deep in the northern chamber.
Do not rashly breach the undifferentiated,
Lest you force the mending of heaven with molten stone.

**For Abbot Guo**

A single gourd of porridge—this is my livelihood,
One who befriends the Dao, is it not so?
Still as a limpid river cradling sun and moon,
In motion, like a crane vanishing into rosy clouds.
Frost touches the temples, hair now speckled with stars,
The cinnabar field sprouts inch by inch of golden shoots.
Wait until the work of the Seven Returns is complete,
Then in the Palace of Nine Suns, behold the golden flower.

**For Master Zhao**

The Golden Mountain by the stream—fit for a hermitage,
I come to this place to dwell in a lotus hut.
Each step in the land of the Dao is steady,
Each glance back at worldly affairs grows more distant.
On the shelf, a few volumes of dusty scriptures,
Before the gate, a thousand willows in misty rows.
Of late, celestial light shines in perfect peace,
A single luminous pearl coalesces within.

**For Clerk Le**

Honor and disgrace—what do they matter to the body?
One misstep disturbs the harmony of *qi*.
Time turns back, and youth slips away,
Gold and jade fill the hall—who would tire of abundance?
Not seeking sun and moon within the gourd,
In vain the heart wages war.
How much better to awaken early to the plan of no-birth,
Beyond the kalpas, can the spirit-light be destroyed?

**Again**

The fourfold body is the crucible of creation,
The five phases’ true fire refines the primordial void.
From the seething sea’s depths, crimson flames arise,
In the murky dust, the great emptiness manifests.
The formed body is but a temporary union,
The unborn Dharma-nature is true suchness.
When the divine youth carves through Kunlun’s jade,
Can its value be matched, even by a city’s ransom?

**To Zhang the Commander**

White hairs rush to fill the head,
The rosy face fades stealthily away.
If destined for immortality, rise lightly,
In the boundless world of affairs, seek not with toil.
Illusions cannot withstand the wind’s candle,
Fleeting life is no more than foam on water.
Fame and fortune—what are they but ephemera?
Even the wise cannot cease their pursuit.

**For Others**

Who recognizes the carefree immortal of the human world?
Hungry, he eats; tired, he sleeps.
A humble hut, enough to shelter the knees,
Half a sheet of empty fame—not worth a penny.
The bright moon hangs in the sky, perfectly aligned,
The clear wind ever circles me.
Before the hall, no idle flowers are planted,
Only jade-green pines stretch to the heavens.

**For Wang, Clerk of Songzhou**

Consider carefully and recount it to the wise:
The word *Dao* belongs to the dusty world.
In utmost emptiness and silence, none may intrude,
Its subtlety and wonder cannot be transmitted.
In stillness, radiance shines—heaven has eyes,
Within the mysterious, creation’s fire births the lotus.
The great thousand worlds are all unobstructed,
A single spirit-pearl is round everywhere.

**For Magistrate Hao of Ninghai**

I tell the heroes of the world:
Each person possesses a night-shining pearl.
In former years, desire’s dust dimmed its light,
Today, polishing removes the grime, and it gleams anew.
A radiance like a precious mirror,
Purity like an ice-filled vase.
From Kunlun’s summit, the spirit-spring descends,
Watering the jade flowers, never to wither.

**Great Harmony: For Commander Sun**

Do not cling to fleeting splendor, resenting this body,
Better to nurture your celestial truth in quietude.
What use is a life spent in vain?
Worldly affairs have ever deceived mankind.
Accumulate virtue—why fear the path to immortality is distant?
Forget emotion—this is the Dao’s true kin.
When the dream of Huaxu ends and the yang spirit emerges,
Transform the nation and wander in an eternal spring.

**Roaming Mount Jiaozi**

Flowing and halting, following the leisurely Dao,
My visit to Mount Jiaozi was but chance.
Like floating duckweed, I drift ever onward,
Yet my sleeves dance in the wind, carefree.
A few peaks rise from the plain like a painting,
A hundred birds in the secluded woods play their pipes.
Once the work of the Seven Returns is complete,
All the world’s finest places will be filled with flying immortals.

**For Daoist Yuan**

Empty fame all day—how futile,
I ask: can the fleeting light be detained?
Only the buzzing flies vie for blood,
Unknowing that the dream’s moon startles the crows.
Through many lives, greed and desire weigh heavily,
Gradually wearing away the jade-like nature to withered dryness.
I tell the wise: remember well,
Cherish and guard the night-shining pearl within.

**Admonition to the Kitchen**

The kitchen’s hearth and firewood keep one busy all day,
Feeding the mouth—all for a sack of foulness and filth.

A thousand meals from one plow’s toil are not easily gained,
A hundred lashes for a bowl of rice already wound too deep.
Precious as brain and marrow—yet men treat it as common thing,
Never once tilling the root of the Dao’s own field.
Forgetting stillness of mind, they cast aside constant vigilance,
Only to repay in fur and horn in lives to come.

**Self-Reflection**

For forty years a tumbleweed on the sea,
Year after year slipping past, long grown numb.
Spring winds from afar reach the land of no-birth,
Autumn moon ever shines on the sky of no-night.
When samādhi arises, willow still grows by the elbow,
When scenes fade, lotus beneath the feet is already gone.
With earnest words I send to friends in the dust:
Soon, by Cloud Creek, we’ll weave this verdant bond.

**Again**

A carefree wanderer by Cloud Creek,
In a small window, high recline, nurturing heaven’s truth.
In dreams, once awakened, there are no more dreams,
Beyond the body, one knows there is yet another body.
A cold moon hangs in the void, bright for a thousand years,
Vernal splendor touches all things, fresh for a fleeting moment.
How could it compare to grasping the principle of long life?
Without past, without present—one eternal spring.

**Following Sun Boying’s Rhyme**

Alone, wherever I go, I find shelter,
Treading through mist and rosy clouds, never losing the way.
Who at the sky’s edge brings word from the green birds?
White clouds beyond the wind drift east and west.
Pounding the dark frost, the rabbit in the moon appears,
Driving the true fire, the sun’s parrot is summoned.
Gathered into the mysterious, to achieve enduring vision,
One spirit, one true nature, equal to heaven.

**To Sun Boying**

This lofty one long wearied of the capital’s splendor,
Recalling the immortal mountains, reclining amid rosy clouds.
Bamboo staff and straw sandals as companions,
Alchemical furnace and scriptures as life’s foundation.
Hunger fed with acorns and mountain yams,
Thirst quenched with pine pollen and stone tea.
Right and wrong, all distinctions left unchallenged,
Knowing only that the body belongs to the great square.

**Again**

Responding to things as they come, trusting nature,
Within nature itself, the true immortal is concealed.
No need to pore over fragmented texts or exhaust scriptures,
Already, with a flower held, the ancestral Chan is awakened.
With mind settled, all idle weapons are subdued,
With spirit at peace, this fine cause is attained.
Here lies the complete truth of the Quanzhen,
Where in the clouds and mountains would one seek grotto-heavens?

**Again**

To learn immortality, one must dwell in the forest,
In every movement, guard against familiar realms encroaching.
In the arena of fame and profit, do not set foot,
In the realm of sages and worthies, bestow your heart.
From one basket, a thousand fathoms are built,
Treat fleeting moments as if they were inches of gold.
When spirit and qi congeal into a leakless body,
Amid mist and rosy clouds, there are true kindred spirits.

**Again**

How many autumns can beauty’s eyes and adorned face endure?
Suddenly, bleached bones lie in a desolate mound.
In life, relying on cunning, a thousand schemes,
Here, heroes in an instant come to rest.
After delusion, joy and sorrow become true form,
Upon awakening, life and death are like floating bubbles.
Yet this numinous thing within never decays,
Left for wayfarers as a signpost to enlightenment.

**To Magistrate Zheng**

Pitiable, your temples already grizzled,
All day buried in stacks of documents.
Worldly profit melts like snow in boiling water,
Your brush’s tip sharp as ginger’s sting.
Rich flavors delight the mouth, the whole family rejoices,
But when karmic debts arrive, you alone repay.
If you take my words as medicine and stone,
I hope you’ll swallow them and freeze your heart.

**To Deputy Warehouse Keeper Zhang**

Soon or late, compose your return and rest,
To wander carefree as a cloud or water.
To have settled a life’s plans within a space to stretch one’s knees
Outweighs three years as a prisoner of office.
Within the gourd, the elixir of long life awaits,
In the world, there is no reason not to die.
One day, when merit is complete, ascend beyond,
At the Jade Pool’s gathering, join the company of immortals.

**To Magistrate Wang**

Best to withdraw from the arena of right and wrong,
To become a carefree, untroubled person.
With a patterned staff, roam the paths beyond the clouds,
Straw sandals never touch the dust of the world.
Lift your head—the bright moon is a worthy friend,
Wherever you go, green mountains are always neighbors.
Find a small hut in a secure place,
By the pine window, in lofty seclusion, nurture heaven’s truth.

**To Master Ji of Mount Song**

From afar, gazing southeast to ten thousand layers of green,
The master dwells beyond this mountain’s heights.
Worldly splendor seen through, the dust’s bonds all severed,
Subtle wonders revealed, the Dharma-eye opened wide.
All books in the world are brushed aside,
No dharmas before the eyes can be grasped.
With earnest care, I offer this to all sentient beings:
Complete the nearly finished work of the final basket.

**To Daoist Dong of West Mountain**

To leave home and refine oneself relies on the forest,
Beware of straying from the flock to indulge this heart.
Ask the ungrateful floating clouds:
How do they compare to flowing water seeking a true friend?
Only after careful carving is jade perfected,
Only after blowing away the last grains of sand is gold revealed.
I hear Penglai and Yingzhou abound in worthy companions,
Never idly waste another moment of light.

**Announcement to Old Lady Liang**

Disciple, do not endure bitter suffering,
The great Dao was always originally natural.
In true stillness, true purity, all functions arise,
Without carving, without polishing, it becomes round.
In the Palace of Five Lights, lingzhi mushrooms grow,
On the Mountain of Seven Treasures, auspicious lotuses bloom.
Pluck one branch and return to the ethereal,
At the Jade Pool’s gathering, present it to the immortals.

**To Abbot Wang**

The immortal’s wind is fit only for forests and springs,
Seeing through the dust’s bonds, seek the Dao’s bonds.
Brush away the myriad entanglements of the heart’s realm,
Cultivate in silence the mystery within your nature.
Heaven’s light shines forth, delusive clouds disperse,
The Dharma-eye opens, the moon of wisdom hangs.
Then, overturn the Silver River to pour,
Watering the golden lotuses within the grotto.

**To Mei Xian**

With innate Dao bones, you yearn for true cultivation,
Naturally, the red dust cannot detain you.
The wild horses already know the window’s sun is brief,
How could the parrot consent to wander beneath a porcelain sky?
Within the gourd, the elixir of long life is refined,
On the sea, let the boat drift without mooring.
Better still, when you return at dusk,
A single wheel of bright moon over the emerald river in autumn.

**To Zhang Cangshi of Songzhou**

To become a guest in the Quanzhen gate,
Take up your staff and leave the red dust.
Polish the precious mirror until it blazes with light,
Refine the cinnabar until it subdues gods and demons.
Ten thousand defilements cleared from the heart’s realm,
A single word awakens the dreamer.
Turn your head, look back at those petty ones—
All for cleverness have lost their original truth.

**Inscribed at Stone Nest Hermitage**

Gazing afar, mist and haze lock the emerald haze,
The Daoist comes here and forgets all schemes.
Before the eyes, all is true purity and stillness,
At the ears, not a whisper of idle right or wrong.
In the distance, jade-green peaks stretch like kingfishers,
By the gate, fine springs drip like strings of pearls.
The red dust, though a footstep away, seems as distant as the sky,
In the quiet, beneath the pines, the door remains shut at noon.

**To Zhao Jixian of Stone Nest**

Seeing through this floating life—bubbles on water,
Not a speck of dust allowed to touch the heart’s ground.
Sometimes I take up the yellowed scrolls and set them down,
Endless blue mountains stir my wanderlust, and off I go.
Do not mock this gourd-bottle livelihood—
It has made a thousand ages look up in admiration.
If someone asks for the method of cultivation,
“Eat your fill, have no surplus, and every affair is done.”

**Sent to Commissioner Zhang**

This body is finite—do not let it slip away,
A hundred years of light pass in the snap of a finger.
Just when you think your golden purse is still half-full,
You do not notice the white hairs multiplying at your temples.
Death at life’s end—who can escape it?
Even with children and grandchildren filling your eyes, what can you do?
How much better to seize the days of strength and health,
And early invite the bright moon to join you in misty vines.

**For Chief Yang**

Do not speak of golden lotuses blooming in fire,
Nor claim your home holds a grotto-heaven.
Generally, to leave the household is to leave love and desire,
One must cut off all thoughts to reach the profound mystery.
Grinding a brick to make a mirror is never true,
Brushing a stone to turn it into a sheep is but a temporary skill.
If you reach the state of unimpeded spiritual power,
You can make even level ground into a realm of immortals.

**An Autumn Day for Daoist Wanyan**

Morning brings the White Emperor’s frosty might,
As if to aid heaven and earth in their killing intent.
Treetops cannot bear the weight—leaves fall in droves,
While at the edge of the sky, scattered geese hurry home.
Travelers far from the red dust fret over silvered temples,
Soldiers at the purple frontier sicken in their iron armor.
Only the immortals have no cares—
A bowl of millet gruel, and the brushwood gate stays shut.

**Reflections at the Supreme Clarity Palace**

Waking from sleep, I wander at ease, my mind unburdened,
Leaning on my staff, I make my way to the abode of truth.
In the wind, red and purple petals fall ceaselessly,
After the rain, jade-green bamboo renews itself daily.
This sacred land naturally generates auspicious qi,
The azure heavens never cease their journey of the red wheel.
The immortal sage has forgotten the world of mortals—
Just as he turns, the morning bell rings from without.

**For Daoist Zhao**

Gather your spirit and turn your gaze inward,
Do not let the impoverished thief of the outer world deceive you.
The six gates’ mystic keys sever the roots of dust,
The sevenfold returning elixir drills the Dao’s qi into being.
When jade dew descends, each drop is a pearl,
Where golden clouds take flight, the moon forms perfect circles.
In the crystal pavilion stands the True Person’s position,
Red phoenix and dark turtle coil above and below.

**Zhang Gu’s Announcement**

A furnace of spring snow demands your work,
Temper and refine until every grain becomes a pearl.
Ten thousand silver rays of radiance interweave,
A thousand kinds of auspicious hues blur into one.
The infant gathers the magic mushroom,
The alchemical maiden steals open the crucible of creation.
There is a True Person idly at play—
Staff propped against the moon, toying with the void’s origin.

**For Daoist Li of Qingping**

Old and great, my eyes can no longer bear books,
Only in stillness is it fitting to nurture an empty heart.
A hundred bones harmonize, the spirit dreams no more,
Four limbs flow freely, breath settles into depth.
I break open Mount Jing to search for uncut jade,
I brush aside the cinnabar tripod to seek true gold.
Now I tell you the immortal’s secret—
Entrust it to others: cherish every inch of time.

**Announcement for Vice-Observer Wang**

I tell the world’s stalwart heroes:
All people possess night-shining pearls.
In former years, they lay buried in dust and darkness,
Today, the tarnish is wiped away, and not a trace of intent remains.
A strip of light as pure as white silk,
Tenfold brightness like an ice-filled flask.
Kunlun transforms into the liquor of spirit-spring,
Watering jade blossoms that never wither.

**For Chief Shi**

Śākyamuni held up a flower—it was a revelation,
Bodhidharma faced the wall—he tarried in stillness.
The numinous essence is inherently without wax or wane,
It is the human heart that vainly grows tumors of delusion.
The Great Dao forgets words—it is not a matter of discourse,
The valley spirit never dies—yet there is no way to seek it.
The perfected one, having attained it, is too lazy to speak—
Thirst quenched, hunger sated, all affairs are done.

**For Chief Zhang**

Profound silence and thunderous sound each follow their nature,
Within them, the message is fundamentally empty and nonexistent.
The lotus hut’s life and death are not a matter of wisdom,
The earth-and-wood body’s form is not foolishness.
Counting breaths is but a trifling aid,
Feasting on rosy clouds is but a shallow practice.
If you wish to know the immortal’s secret beyond the world,
Snatch the pearl from beneath the black dragon’s chin.

**Five-Character Regulated Verse**

**Sent to Wanyan, Supervisor of the Dongxiao Palace**

A message for the guest of Dongxiao:
Your celestial endowment is fortunately abundant.
Good conduct leaves no trace,
In worldly affairs, it is better to be as if foolish.
Remember this candle burning brightly—
It yields to the clam that hides its pearl.
Do not let your light shine outwardly,
Cherish it to nurture this frail body.

**Sent to Master Lang**

A message for the old man of the western mountains:
Living in the mountains is also joyous.
Ten thousand greens all taste of wax,
A single thought turns to cold ashes.
The departing crow bows its head in submission,
New poems are cut out by hand.
The lofty immortals are full of care—
They do not let you come to the fore.

**Reflections**

Hemp robe and kudzu kerchief,
A single idle man between heaven and earth.
Vast and boundless, transcending the three realms,
Towering and majestic, rising above the six dusts.
Within the grotto, immortals never age,
Inside the gourd, the scene is eternal spring.
I ascend the summit of Kunlun,
Turn my head to gaze at the North Star.

**Again**

The Dao’s resolve grows ever more steadfast,
Human feelings naturally grow distant and sparse.
Emptiness and clarity are my livelihood,
Stillness and simplicity nurture the true thusness.
Lead and mercury simmer in the golden tripod,
Mysterious frost refines the jade furnace.
When the work is complete and I return,
I will dwell forever in the immortal capital.

**For Chief Wu of Zhongjing**

Cold jade-green peaks of Song Mountain press close,
I dwell in seclusion by the stream’s waters.
Human sentiments gradually thin,
The Dao’s resolve grows ever more refined.
Simurghs and cranes gather in the cinnabar courtyard,
Clouds and rosy mists fly through the jeweled hall.
What is it that unties the orchid?
Once gone, it does not return.

**Following Master Lei’s Rhyme**

I wander at will into forests and springs,
Forty years have slipped by in careless steps.
Before the moon could be pointed out,
After the fish, the fish-trap was already forgotten.
Years and months pass like this,
My feelings and thoughts are also serene.
Not yet returned to the immortal mountains,
I respond to things and follow the green.

**Twenty-Two Five-Character Quatrains**

Worldly affairs, one by one, are finished,
Floating life, matter by matter, is done.
Suddenly, beyond the three realms,
Not a single thread is entangled.

The Great Dao is utterly profound,
Emptiness and clarity align with nature.
Parting the eye of samadhi,
Behold another layer of heaven.

Form reveals the formless,
True emptiness blends with colored emptiness.
Neither being nor non-being is stained—
A single point within the great void.

To become a body without hindrance,
First repay the debts you owe.
Trim the lamp within your nature,
Illumine the realm of empty space.

A thatched hut at the city’s edge—
Who recognizes it as an immortal land?
The place is remote, few people pass,
The heart is clear, the Dao’s flavor lingers.

Everywhere is the Dao,
Everything is illumination.

Do not dare affirm all appearances,
In wordless silence find supreme peace.
The autumn wind rises in gusts,
Scattered leaves swirl and fly.
These very matters, in truth,
Reveal the whole of profound mystery.
Beyond the world, nurturing lofty scholars,
Amid the dust, men unlike the vulgar crowd.
Open wide the eye of purity,
See through the dust of fame and gain.
Liberation is my own affair,
Death and life concern me not.
The heart shines like the bright moon in emptiness,
The body drifts like a wild cloud at ease.
The true white snow of one’s nature,
How can the hundred distractions stain it?
Unlock the lock without a seam,
Leap forth as a body unbound.
The physical form has its origin,
The true nature—how could it lack a root?
Seek within the center,
And the master remains, as ever.
Let all branches and deceptions cease,
Wisdom will come of itself.
Form cannot escape the mirror’s gaze,
Integrity blooms at the blade’s edge.
Love clings, worldly passions weigh heavy,
The heart stills, the Dao’s flavor is true.
To seek both is without principle,
One must sever decisively.
Great skill is originally like clumsiness,
The awl in the bag must not show its head.
When the hares are all gone,
The good hound need not worry.
Roaming the vast sea,
A thousand layers of snow-white waves rise high.
Cast the mountain bait—
Which one is the divine turtle?
That which is born was never born,
That which dies does not truly die.
Amid the endless cycle of birth and death,
No one knows this truth.
The four elements perform wonders,
The five phases turn to stench and decay.
Transformed a hundred thousand ways,
Tossed and turned through ten thousand ages.
Worldly affairs are inherently limited,
The Great Dao is boundless.
Awakening from the dream of floating life,
The heart is like a lotus rising from water.
Having become a carefree wanderer,
Seek those beyond the realm of things.
Meeting, not a word is spoken,
Eyes meet, the Dao is already intimate.
Where worldly dust does not reach,
Here one nurtures idleness and ease.
Speak to like-minded friends:
Floating life is all emptiness.
When will fame and merit end?
When will wealth and rank cease?
Seeing through the dream of floating life,
It is like vomit on water.
I wish to cast fragrant bait,
But the divine turtle does not take the hook.
Turning back the solitary oar,
The moon glimmers on the emerald river in autumn.

**Two Six-Line Poems**

The Dao is originally without words or speech,
Only that your heart be fiercely resolute.
Sweep aside the idle clouds for ten thousand miles,
Push forth a wheel of bright moonlight.

Black mercury refined into white snow,
Red lead congealed into golden sprouts.
By the lamp’s light, hand it down personally,
Deeply conceal your own elixir of spirit.

**Collected Works of Master Lifeng, Volume One Concluded**

**Collected Works of Master Lifeng, Volume Two – Seven-Character Quatrains**

**Occasionally Composed**

Desolate clouds and waters, a few frosts and stars,
I have gathered the immortal’s formula for deathlessness.
Two substances, together weighing sixteen ounces,
Riding the crimson phoenix into the immortal realm.

**Refining the Heart**

The Daoist’s heart is already cold ashes,
Boundless worldly dust turns away of itself.
Taking heaven and earth as wondrous use,
This body, wherever it goes, is Penglai.

**For Master Yila**

The immortal scene within the gourd is not ordinary,
The ten thousand images, forest and net, shine of themselves.
Through purity refined into a body without leakage,
In harmony nurtured, the king within the Dharma.

People’s talk of me—when will it end?
Competing for profit and fame—what sorrow is there?
If you awaken to this body’s limits,
The fly’s head and snail’s horn cease in an instant.

**Wang the Daoist’s Admonition**

Oral instructions, earnestly repeated, offered to the worthy:
When hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.
The numinous terrace gleams, unstained by dust,
The precious mirror leaves no trace, the nature is naturally whole.

**Sent to Vice-Commissioner Yila of Deshun Prefecture**

Before worldly merit is complete, the heart is already done,
Worldly customs all forgotten, the nature is not forgotten.
Let the wind of wisdom blow through the ten thousand sounds,
The true emptiness alone appears, a wheel of light.

**For the Gate Officer**

Amid piled rosy clouds, there are those who know the tone,
In the arena of fame and profit, use little heart.
If you have but one branch for roosting,
Why laboriously seek the deep forest?

**For Grand Master Jiang of the Taiyi Palace**

The numinous staff pries open the lock of fame and profit,
The blade of wisdom severs the borders of right and wrong.
A rider of whales beyond the world by nature,
Naturally roams the land of endless light.

**Sent to Master Lang**

By Cloud Creek, high pillow, reclining amid rosy clouds,
Cultivating and grafting the flower of immortality that never fades.
You may lead the host of immortals,
Having harmonized the qi to the ends of the earth.

**Also**

To the south of the mountains, auspicious qi swells and lengthens,
To the north of the waters, golden flowers bloom in clusters.
From time to time, numinous sounds convey good tidings,
In the Jade Void Palace, selecting immortal material.

**Also**

Faint rosy clouds, gentle mountains,
This body ever dwells amid emerald haze.
White clouds in the empty valley, no one comes,
Gaining a day of leisure for body and heart.

**Wu the Daoist of Suizhou Requests to Reside in the Hermitage**

Hidden by Cloud Creek for several years,
By chance, following the wind, I came among men.
Yellow dust on the feet is not my affair,
Leading the white clouds, I return to the old mountain.

**For Liu, Chief of Liling County**

Money-grubbers and official prisoners,
In the bustling dust, when will it end?
The allotted span of light and time is easily spent,
The boundless years and months depart, hard to retain.

**Verses for the Abbess of the Convent in Luozhou Stronghold**

Everywhere is the meaning from the West,
In every thing, the ancestral Buddha’s heart is fully clear.
Heart and intent both forgotten, wondrous use is achieved,
No need to struggle in vexed pondering.

**Wooden Tablet Inscription for Heliu Town**

One robe, one meal—do not seek too rigidly,
Be content to follow circumstances and rest.
Gain a heart at ease and strength spared,
No idle matters weigh on the brow.

**For Li, Abbot of Xihua County**

Atop the mountain, surging surging, a numinous spring,
At the sea’s bottom, blazing blazing, auspicious lotuses form.
Having harmonized yin and yang, the elixir congeals of itself,
In the crystal palace, meeting all the immortals.

**For Hu, Chief of Xihua County**

If you awaken to the wheel of rebirth, return early,
Do not plant golden lotuses in the fire.
Even if you plant them and the roots sprout,
In the end, not a single blossom will open.

**For Zhang, Abbot of Xihua County**

Not attached to empty flowers or worldly flowers,
The Daoist’s livelihood is a simple life.
When inspired, two scrolls of idle text,
When weary, in the pine pavilion, watching the sunset glow.

**For Jia the Daoist of Xihua County**

Cutting off the crane’s legs to lengthen the duck’s, forgetting proportion,
Filling mountains and valleys, obscuring the verdant green.
One gourd is enough for the hermit’s joy,
An inch of ground, always empty, for the great awakened immortal.

**For Chang the Novice of Chenzhou**

The Daoist’s heart is clear as ice,
Without need for contrivance, the Dao arises of itself.

Amidst the hush of all sounds, the heart rests in perfect stillness,
A single wheel of autumn moon shines bright and clear.

**For Steward Wanyan of Chenzhou**

Adding and withdrawing, inquiring through the scorching flames,
Once yin and yang are harmonized, the fire burns in ceaseless cycles.
When pure yang is refined, the spirit emerges of itself,
On the path of no-birth, roam freely and without care.

**For Abbess Wanyan of Chenzhou**

Sought all day, year after year, yet nowhere to be found,
Yet when attained, no time was ever spent.
A single spark of numinous clarity—this true message,
Whether for Buddha or immortal, it is this heart.

**For Abbess Sun of Chenzhou**

Sweep away all worldly concerns until nothing remains,
Let no dust obscure the ice-pure flask.
Within the breast, a single thing—divine radiance appears,
Ten thousand crimson clouds enfold the jeweled pearl.

**For Minister Puchaci Congyi of Xizhou**

When merit is complete and fame achieved, return early to the mountains,
Staff in hand, wander carefree wherever you go.
In the light of the bright moon, subtle wonders fuse,
Where white clouds gather, refine the elixir of spirit.

**For Elder Brother Wanyan of Chenzhou**

Cut away the brambles to open the heart’s ground,
Sweep clear the wasteland to plant auspicious lotuses.
The rustling breeze stirs jade-like leaves,
The radiant new moon illumines the alchemical heaven.

**For Abbot Zhang of the Chen Garden in Chenzhou**

Cast aside the six desires, and the body is at ease,
Unstained by a single speck of dust, the nature roams free.
Cultivate the rootless tree within the fire,
Release the divine blossom that never fades.

**For Abbess Xu**

Fame and merit are like sparks struck from stone,
Wealth and rank vanish like foam upon the water.
Let go, and ascend the path beyond the clouds,
All distinctions of right and wrong, self and other, cease at once.

**To Liu Sanxian**

Long have we wandered apart in Suiyang,
Gazing until spring clouds no longer come.
Cherish the priceless sword of Dragon Spring,
Let not its sacred light be dimmed by dust.

**For Abbot Song of Hutou**

This body drifts like a lone tumbleweed between heaven and earth,
Wandering aimlessly, east and west.
Better to sit idly in a grass hut,
Returning to nurture my indolence in lofty solitude.

**For Officer Guo of Changping**

Fire, wind, earth, water—what compels their service?
Gathered, they form shape; scattered, they return to rest.
Half a sheet of merit is but wasted effort,
A hundred years of grasping at water’s foam.

**For Wang Miaojian of Runliu Town**

Let not a single thought disturb the heart’s leisure,
Shatter the knots of doubt to realize non-action.
Hold fast within the breast the nature of the Perfect Real,
How many in ancient or present times have preserved it?

**For Chief Patron Wang of Linxian County**

Spring’s light fades, and the traveler grows weary,
Withered blossoms, butterflies—sorrow deepens.
Yet the osmanthus shadow knows no decay,
Its fragrance fills the world—when will it ever cease?

**For Chief Patron Shao of Linxian County**

Not skilled in capturing foxes or hobbling horses,
When hungry, eat; when weary, sleep.
In profound stillness, a dream of Huaxu,
Only then does one realize another heaven lies within the flask.

**To Clerk He**

For years, you held the rod, angling for the great turtle,
While the white-eyed whale mocked the waves.
Now gather your line and return west,
Another empty crossing of the vast blue sea.

**For Deputy Magistrate Wugulun of Wuyang County**

The immortal’s livelihood is not arduous,
Cleanse the mind, forget emotion, and qi harmonizes of itself.
When joyful, take up the staff and seek wild paths,
When weary, rest high upon the pillow, beyond worldly ties.

**For Abbess Wanyan**

By the pine window, on the stone pillow, sleep at ease,
Even when visitors come along the bamboo path, remain unaware.
Startled awake, robe drawn close, sit upright—
Form like withered wood, eyes like sleep.

**For Chief Patron Zhang of Mengzhai**

Suddenly cast off the world’s net to preserve the Perfect Real,
Purify the spirit’s palace to nurture the Valley Spirit.
Ever keep the heart empty, free of all affairs,
As osmanthus blooms anew at the edge of the heavens.

**For Supervisor Yu of the Daoist Abbey**

Distant mountains, veiled in emerald mist,
Towering green peaks near the forest springs.
Carve open chaos to reveal a glimpse of scenery,
Steal a speck of heaven from within the flask.

**For Abbot Zu of Nanyang County**

The Three Realms have walls, yet still seem narrow,
The Four Directions have no bounds—all is garden.
Yellow blossoms, green bamboo—all my affairs,
Clouds are clouds, mountains are mountains.

**For Abbot Cheng**

For forty autumns, you held the fishing line,
Whenever waves arose, you cast your hook.
The whale and whalebone refused the fragrant bait,
Empty boat adrift, you wander alone.

**For Lady Muhu**

Mankind knows only to chant the name of Amitābha,
But can you yourself become Amitābha?
Recognize the original ancestor, formless,
No need to seek without, running in vain.

**For Officer Kang**

Do not compare it to mountains high or seas deep,
The seeker wastes effort in distant searches.
Before your eyes lies the Way of long life,
Both sage and mortal arise from this inch of heart.

**For Chief Patron Xue of Luoyang**

Near water, beside mountains, emerald mists enfold,
Yet fame and profit bind your steps, and you forget to return.
This body does not belong to the red dust’s guest,
Lying down, watch the white clouds drift beyond the sky.

**For Daoist Yila**

Let not the Daoist’s steps falter,
The heart’s mirror must be polished with single-minded resolve.
When all traces of grime are gone, light appears of itself,
Within this square inch, behold Amitābha.

**For Abbess Gui**

Treading the world’s edge, sought in vain,
Yet when attained, no effort was ever spent.
Cast aside a hundred years of red dust affairs,
A true person now steers the chariot.

**For Chief Patron Jimofan**

Within the web of form, a body unbound,
Who through the ages has understood near and far?
Cast off the hundred years of this mother-born sack,
A true person now drives the sun’s chariot.

**For Commander Tangkuo of Chenzhou**

Break free from the world’s net, and the body is at ease,
Leap from the cage of the mundane, and the nature is free.
Staff in hand, enter the misty path of rosy clouds,
Startling the white clouds to fill the old mountains.

**For Chief Patron Ma**

Since you seek the Dao, study deeply,
The secret method, once transmitted, bears fruit.
A single spark of numinous clarity, clear as water,
Refined into the elixir, crimson within the crucible.

**For Chief Patron Chen**

Dwelling in the sea of suffering, do not speak of the Dao,
Beneath the mountain of grace, do not discuss Chan.
If you let go of both,
No need to dig the earth to seek the heavens.

**For Military Supervisor Shi**

Beyond the city walls, a few acres of garden,
Silk and hemp, congee and porridge, sustain these fading years.
No ambition to ride the crane or mount the clouds,
Content to wander the world, responding to illusions.

**For Chief Patron Cao**

The Great Dao is wordless, within this inch of heart,
No need to chase it a thousand miles afar.
Within the breast lies a mirror, perfectly bright,
Let not dust obscure its depths.

**To Ma Wenqing**

Once awakened, waste not a moment,
For an inch of time is an inch of gold.

**For Heshi Lie of Suzhou, Inquiring of His Future**

Adrift in the waves of the sea of love, none can stay,
Amidst the tangle of clouds, seek a true friend.
The Yu clan’s lofty gates have long held promise,
The cinnamon of Yan Mountain bears no cause without reason.
No need to ask of the future’s path—
One truly selfless is a person of fortune.

**For Master Song of Xiao County**

The master strolls with staff in hand, at ease,
Grasping the luminous pearl within his palm.
Best to retreat to the cloud-wreathed mountains,
Reclining in leisure by the window, sipping the wind through pines.

**Lazy Nest, Self-Composed**

A lazy man now dwells in this lazy nest,
The steed of will long since reined and spent.
After meals, he only knows to sit in heaped ashes—
Is there another as indolent as I?

**For Lady Gao**

Who recognizes this puppet body on stage?
Layer upon layer of flesh, heap upon heap of dust.
When the hundred-year thread snaps, no news remains—
Gone is the puppeteer who once played the scene.

**For the Wife of Supervisor Duji**

The four images congeal into a lump of deluded flesh,
The five phases knit into a stinking skeleton.
Like puppets they appear—have you not seen?
Each can speak and nod in turn.

**For Lady Liu**

Within the crystal palace blooms a crimson lotus,
Attaining the fruitless fruit, a great awakened immortal.
Gently she ascends the path beyond the clouds,
Soaring into the Purple Tenuity Heaven.

**For the Wife of Administrator Aotun**

Seventy years of life—half already past,
I urge you to advance upon the Dao, let no time slip.
When impermanence suddenly presses upon your head,
Though your children be dear, can they take your place?

**For the Daoist of Joyful Practice**

If you speak of cultivation, all things cease,
Not a single thread clings within the breast.
All sounds stilled, no trace remains—
Only a numinous youth driving the fire-ox.

**For Little Yang the Daoist**

The Daoist’s heart is unobstructed, iron-willed,
Leaping beyond the Three Mountains into vast obscurity.
Pointing afar to the depths of white clouds,
Penglai is but her old homeland.

**For Great Yang the Daoist**

The five phases knit this stinking skin-sack,
A single spirit-pearl hidden within.
When still, the flower of the heart shines through the body,
When moving, no place is without its radiance.

**For Xu Daochong**

The Daoist is most fitting in truth,
Fed to fullness, he treads the emerald peaks.
When weary, he sleeps by the stream in his robes,
Awakening, he gathers the drifting clouds to return.

**For Sister Tong**

One who can be pure and still, free from torment,
Cultivating tranquility and emptiness to nourish the vast,
Behind the brain, the eye of samadhi opens—
Within the heart, one’s own heaven shines clear.

**When a Disciple Asked, "What Is Complete Understanding?"**

You come to ask me of complete understanding,
Yet worldly affairs are already swept away.
A bright moon hangs full in the sky,
Ten thousand miles without clouds, its light gleaming.

**For Gao the Immortal**

Guard ever against your inferior nature,
For every movement harms the sprouts of spirit.
Hold fast the whip of thorns,
Until both heart and realm are forgotten.

**For Lady Liu**

A carefree traveler on the road of long life,
A self-possessed immortal in the land of unending light.
Luring the numinous youth to return to the Purple Court,
Harmonizing the Jade Maidens to plant golden lotuses.

**For Sun Tianhe**

The blade of wisdom severs the bonds of fame and gain,
Beyond the world, carefree, all worries forgotten.
With a single release of the hand, he ascends the path to the Three Isles,
Each step a land of white clouds.

**Again**

Within the nameless cave lurks a venomous serpent,
Raise its head, and all things are harmed.
I warn the traveler: take heed,
Ever vigilant in coming and going.

**For Daoist Shang**

Half a sheet of empty fame, hollow as an echo,
A hundred years of fleeting life swift as a shuttle.
At the temples, white hair newly thickens,
On the face, rosy complexion silently fades.

**For Supervisor Gao**

The ancient path of clear wind sees few travelers,
Yet in muddy waters and silted streams, they struggle to the death.
How laughable these foolish creatures,
Who spend their lives pillowed on dregs and lees.

**When Xu Daochong Asked of the Dao**

If you have a true teacher, whom else would you ask?
We share tea and rice, never parted.
Now I point directly to the mark—
Every thought that arises is none other than this.

**For Little Zhang the Immortal**

All reliance on tricks long since cast aside,
Suddenly the ancient spirit shines through.
Having gained such true enjoyment,
In this world, no place is not Penglai.

**For Sister Zhan**

Having grasped the true source, all things vanish,
No dust or defilement may stain the luminous pearl.
When the waters of the source are clear, the whole body appears,
When clouds disperse, the moon in the vast sky stands alone.

**For Bo Zhijian**

Cultivation is neither easy nor difficult,
Begin by removing the mountain of self and other.
Temper true emptiness into one body,
Naturally the heart will be as idle as white clouds.

**For Lady Li**

The misty spring haze lengthens with the days,
The river plum still bears the fragrance of returned souls.
The grotto-heaven first receives the true message,
Hastening the Lord of Creation in his work.

**Early Spring**

Winter’s end, spring returns, the days grow long,
The grotto-heaven first gains its fine scenery.
The Lord of Creation summons a gathering of immortals,
Returning amidst green clouds, sleeves fragrant.

**For Magistrate Li of Linying**

In the wind, the faint scent of pine and cassia,
The mountain hall’s bright moon gleams with radiance.
The Daoist sits in silent stillness through the night,
Ten thousand sounds stilled, a single taste of frost.

**When Lady Li Asked of the Journey**

Between Penglai and this world, the distance is but a foot,
Yet the traveler is lost beyond ten thousand barriers.
The cowherd does not point the way to Xiangcheng,
Even the Yellow Emperor still seeks the Great Clod’s mountain.

**For Lady Zhou**

Power and profit appear as brittle as ice,
The Daoist has already forgotten worldly passions.
Last night, in a dream of wandering immortals,
She rode a golden simurgh to court in the Jade Capital.

**For Yila Dayuan**

Heart-ash cold and fallen, no smoke of passion,
A withered tree’s form, no sprouting buds.
Only when the true fire of the three yangs descends,
Will the iron tree before the hall bloom.

**When the Nun Elder Asked of Cultivation**

You come to ask me of the secret of cultivation,
Now I tell you earnestly:
Sweep away all yin to reveal your original truth,
And a single moon will hang in the azure sky.

**Again**

Coming and going, carefree, following nature,
The long turtle, the short snake—ancestral Chan.
Upon the mountain, a realm of pure frost,
Only then does one see another heaven within the gourd.

**For Dong Zhiyuan**

Where the blade of wisdom is raised, delusions scatter,
Forth burst silver radiance in ten thousand strands.
The many-eyed ghost of yin’s corpse extinguished,
Within the lotus pavilion, the rare and subtle appears.

**For Chief Patron Xue the Sixth**

The numinous treasure of prior heaven exists in the realm of having and not-having,
Moving, it follows the moment; still, it is empty.
Amidst the ten thousand things, it ever acts as master,
Its thousandfold workings respond without end.

**Spring Outing**
Old in years, my heart finds robes too long,
Yet I grasp my staff and force myself to see spring’s light.
The garden’s peach and plum all gaze with envy,
Saying my skin rivals Master Shen’s glow.

**Chef Zhang Asks About Life and Death**
Those who died long ago—did they ever die?
Those born today—what birth do they truly know?
When life and death reach their end, what remains?
To rest in harmony, in accord—this must be clear.

**Roaming Cloud Creek**
A host of immortals invites me to seek spring’s traces,
Thread upon thread of crimson blooms unfold in greeting.
Should I enter Peach Blossom Spring, it would be no dream—
Yet when others ask, where to find Penglai?

**For Zhang Wuzhen**
Within the gourd, a single grain of purple gold sand,
Refined, it radiates a thousand strands of rosy mist.
Once ingested, the floating world’s narrowness fades,
And suddenly the body dwells in the vast and boundless.

**For Madam Zhou**
All things seen through are but dreams,
Every affair known is but emptiness.
Awakened to the not-empty, content in one’s lot,
Let the sun and moon race east and west as they will.

**For Zhang Huaiyuan**
Not a single thing, not a single form leads astray,
Turning back, one penetrates the old Chan mechanism.
Do not let yourself drift through the human world—
Hold fast to the formless, the true, the uncontrived.

**For Magistrate Liu**
Truly pure, truly still—the carefree wanderer,
No clinging, no grasping—the self-soaring immortal.
With staff in hand, he returns beyond the clouds,
Straw sandals treading through the heavens of the grotto.

**For Master Sun**
Cherish spirit, nurture qi, and fortify the numinous field,
In stillness of realm and tranquility of mind, the Dao is natural.
Amidst blazing light, auspicious herbs arise,
Within flames of fire, red lotuses bloom.

**Three Poems on Leisurely Roaming at Jade Creek Hermitage**

**I**
The Daoist leans on his staff to gaze at Western Mountain,
His heart like a drifting white cloud, at ease wherever it goes.
Should he drift into sleep, a dream of celestial palaces—
Who would know his body rests amidst emerald peaks?

**II**
Suddenly recalling a carefree journey beyond the world,
He takes up his patterned staff and strides through wooded hills.
Leaping to the summit of Three Peaks,
The empty and clear wellspring stills ten thousand cares.

**III**
Yesterday, recalling an immortal’s roaming to this mountain,
The scenes within were all serene and unhurried.
White clouds emerge from the ravine without intent,
And the hidden birds return with men by chance.

**For Master Xin**
The Daoist’s heart abides in silent solitude,
Luminous, round, and bright as a jade gourd.
Clouds come and go without hindrance,
Birthless and deathless—realizing the traceless.

**For Master Liu**
The great Dao is empty and nonexistent, yet naturally so,
No need for labored words or endless speech.
Simply keep the heart free of dust and grime,
And a single point of numinous clarity will shine of itself.

**Ascending the Hall at Taiqing Palace, Bozhou**
I am Cloud Creek’s indolent husband,
Forced by ancestral court feathered guests to rise.
Beyond endless prayers for the sage’s longevity,
I watch for golden scales to rise upon the hook.

**Composed at Qizhen Hermitage, Taiqing Palace**
A pure breeze summoned me to Qizhen,
Where the realm is suddenly cut from worldly dust.
Yet here stand the noble bamboos of winter’s endurance,
Their shadows slanting through the window, stirring spirit.

Amidst the bamboo, a hundred birds chirp and clamor,
Rousing me from sleep as the sun climbs high.
Though men may recognize the ceaseless to-and-fro,
I alone remain silent within my breast.

**Idleness**
Ever careless, bound by nothing,
I loosen my robe and idly read Lao-Zhuang.
Suddenly, reaching the place beyond words,
My withered form and bones become like the great void.

**West Garden Fire**
The west garden’s fire briefly lifts my face,
As I suddenly feel the hermitage’s coolness beneath the pillow.
Ten thousand miles of azure sky, clear as water—
How can I bear the moon half-cradled in the mountain’s teeth?

**Reading the *Treatise on Forgotten Intent***
I searched *Nanhua* for it in vain,
Yet found it required no effort at all.
Know that the celestial truth resides within—
A single point of numinous clarity, ever serene.

**Recording a Dream**
In dreams, I beheld sages and worthies descend,
White cranes and green simurghs alighting from jade terraces.
A single basket of the great return—work unfinished,
Auspicious clouds swirled and circled once more.

**Again**
By the cold window, silent, I slept with books for a pillow,
Awakening to find the lamp still burning bright.
Beyond the eaves, moonlight shone clear as day,
Wind stilled, smoke settled—in a time of great peace.

**Admonition to the Magistrate**
As an official, do no harm to the people,
But devise a hundred ways to bestow kindness anew each day.

**Entering, revere your kin; departing, honor your elders,**
Outwardly perfecting *ren* and *yi*, inwardly preserving the True.
*Zhang Gu’s Admonition*

Worldly affairs are manifold, inexhaustible—
Ask of men, and every matter turns to emptiness in an instant.
Turn back and recall the primordial thing:
Through kalpas of destruction, it endures without beginning or end.

Worldly fame cannot be sought,
Ask of men, and wealth and rank vanish in an instant.
How much better to make early plans to return to the mountains,
A single wisp of white cloud wandering beyond the heavens.
*Le Gu’s Admonition*

South of the waters, north of the waters, paths crisscross,
People come and go—what is all this bustle for?
How much better to sit idly in a hut,
The heart untroubled, naturally clear and still.
*Huo Daoren’s Admonition*

This borrowed body has passed sixty, half a hundred,
The face already aged, beard and temples white.
Weary of the restless red dust, I have finished my wanderings—
Let me be a cloud-and-mountain dweller, a rosy-glow guest.
*Kang Guobao’s Examination Success*

Far off, upon the stream, waters and clouds lie level,
Steep mountains rise where the Way’s paths begin.
If only an autumn wind brings a single sail,
Knocking at the gate, one glimpse will brighten the eyes.
*To Shi Wa, Presented to Shi the Daoist*

To seek the formless and obtain the Mystic Pearl,
Once the Mystic Pearl is gained, all things dissolve.
Never seek appearances within the Dharma,
Know that the supreme attainment is *tathatā*.
*Cuckoo*

Green mountains, mist-laden, tangled clouds hang low,
A hidden bird cries urgently day and night.
Who understands the meaning of its bloodied song?
Each cry still pleads, *"Better to go home."*
*Admonition to Du the Daoist*

Green leaves cast deep shade, veiling the setting sun,
White clouds drift, one by one, across the autumn pond.
The Daoist comprehends nothing of worldly affairs,
Hidden in forests and springs, he forgets both favor and disgrace.
*Presented to Cao the Daoist*

I love the scenery of forests and springs, most secluded,
Where white clouds run deep and waters flow east.
The Daoist cares not for matters of rise and fall—
Body and mind wholly free.
*To Gao Gu of Huaizhou*

The Daoist’s livelihood fears no poverty,
His plain and simple family ways unstained by dust.
Clouds disperse, moonlight bright as day—
Turning the light inward, he sees the one within.
*To Shi Huo’s Dong Qilang*

The ancient Daoist family ways cannot be sought,
How long will you keep rummaging through old texts?
How much better to cast them aside and return home,
Where moon-white skies and blue clouds let waters flow freely.
*Sent to the Field-Hut Shopkeeper Cao Kongyue, Who Calls Himself "Water Buffalo"*

A word to Old Water Buffalo of the Cao family:
A hempen rope through your nose, pulling you back.
Time and again, apply the whip—
Only when your whole body turns white will you gain freedom.
*Quanzhen Daoist’s Admonition*

In the human realm, do not distinguish foolishness from wisdom,
For to distinguish foolishness and wisdom is itself delusion.
To know the true principle of pure emptiness,
Seek enlightenment deep in the white clouds, where the subtle and serene abide.
*To Li Gu of Songzhou*

A thousand paths, ten thousand divergences—only the solitary return,
From the sacred mountain, the precious pearl is gathered.
Let not the spring wind reveal idle tidings—
Within, the cloud-wrapped bud has yet to open.

Over ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, the path does not err,
First to pluck the cassia branch in the Moon Palace.
Diligently presented to Father Danyang—
Permitted to claim the first place among Penglai’s families.
*To Zhang Gu of Songzhou*

To grasp the wordless principle is deepest,
No need to wander far in search of a knowing friend.
Suddenly letting go, every direction is it—
A heart of pure emptiness, clear and serene.
*Presented to Duji, Prefect of Songzhou*

Deep in green mountains, white clouds idle,
Yet I recall those idle clouds, how they once came to the peaks.
A dark path through mist-laden trees,
A wooden man still passes through emerald haze.
*Wang the Daoist’s Admonition*

Diligently whet the sword of wisdom to sever ignorance,
Spew forth numinous radiance, dissolving all perceptions.
From this moment, body and mind know no obstruction—
The Primordial Lord follows wherever you go.
*To Master Lang the Twelfth*

Over ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains, the path does not err,
Mountains wind, paths turn—scenery ever more fine.
Old friends meet, no other words—
Sitting together beneath deep peaks, gazing at rosy clouds.
*Presented to Shi Huo’s Ma the Daoist*

A quiet mountain village near forests and springs,
Spring ends, no one stirs, willows trail mist.
If you wish to know where I’ve gone after parting,
Leisurely in Penglai, gazing upon the jade-walled heavens.
*Presented to Zhang the Immortal*

The Daoist exerts himself in forward cultivation,
To the ends of sea and sky, making it his limit.
Only after wearing through iron shoes does he awaken—
Ten thousand mountains, a thousand waters, all at once cease.
*Admonition to Master He of Dengcheng County*

The Daoist’s true work lies in sincerity,
No need for alchemical classics or the *Book of Master Zhuang*.
Having awakened to a single word, its practice never ends—
Serene and still, he sits in the realm of *Vairocana*.
*For Tang the Abbess’ Birthday*

Beyond kalpas, the numinous fungus needs no spring,
Within the gourd’s realm, no dust remains.
At heaven’s edge, the elms gleam white,
In the moon’s embrace, the cassia renews itself.
*Wang the Daoist’s Admonition*

Leaping from the red dust, the body is at ease,
Within it, life and death become distinct.
Unobstructed, carefree in nature—
Why strive to soar a hundred thousand leagues?
*To Little Li Gu*

Washing away worldly passions, all things vanish,
The numinous terrace gleams, clear as an ice-jade vessel.
No need to ask the patriarch’s intent—
Clapping, the empty void holds a single pearl.
*Admonition to Elder Bian*

Seventy years an old rogue,
Chattering of Chan, discoursing on the Dao—when will it end?
Even if all ten thousand Dharmas are fully illuminated,
Without reaching the ash-like heart, clear as autumn, it is not enough.
*Chang Gu’s Admonition*

Seeking teachers, visiting the Way, painfully inquiring,
Body and mind bound, not free.
Sweeping away endless abstruse discourses—
A bright moon rises above the mountain’s crest.
*Presented to Director Han*

Leaping from the red dust, all things cease,
Body and world entrusted to the empty boat.
Deep in azure waves, casting fragrant bait—
Who says the golden turtle will not take the hook?
*Presented to Commander Mu Hu*

Staff in hand, drifting like tumbleweed, carefree,
Cloud companions come to visit among waters and clouds.
A single meeting, a seat of unborn discourse—
Unaware, the red sun sinks behind the western hills.
*Zhao the Daoist’s Admonition*

One evening’s autumn wind, ten thousand leaves wither,
The Daoist’s livelihood grows ever more desolate.
Washing away the dust of worldly cares,
The Penglai and Kunlun paths lie not far off.
*Admonition to Xu Gu*

To cultivate immortality, first cast off self and others,
To study the Dao, guard against comparing right and wrong.
On Seven-Treasure Mountain, the smoke and fire fade,
Within the Five-Light Palace, *Muni* is realized.
*Presented to Vice Commissioner Zhang*

This body is a drifting leaf of a boat,
Unafraid of wind and waves, it comes to wander.
Deep in misty waves, casting fragrant bait—
Without catching the divine turtle, it will not rest.
*Again*

In a hempen robe, staff in hand, drifting away,
A single wisp of solitary cloud between heaven and earth.

Wherever I go, I cannot become rain or dew,
Yet I return to the forest to companion the green mountains.
*Presented to Young Master Zhang*

Autumn winds sweep the cosmos clean,
Ten thousand miles without a cloud, the Great Purity spotless.
Only a single wheel of the formless moon,
Before heaven and earth, turns ever more bright.
*Shown to Ma the Daoist of Hanyang*

East and west, a wanderer to the ends of the earth,
North and south, seeking the mystery as a carefree immortal.
Having grasped the patriarch’s eye beyond kalpas,
Returning, I see my own heaven.
*Shown to Wang the Daoist*

For a decade, I wandered all quarters with staff in hand,
Little knowing that movement and stillness follow one another.
Yet among the clever ghosts who trade in bones,
I awaken the master before heaven and earth.
*Shown to Zhou the Daoist*

A stalwart man’s seven-foot frame,
Licking honey from a blade’s edge—this is no true man.
Know that you possess a natural treasure,
In vain do you seek the pearl beneath the black dragon’s chin.
*Sent to Magistrate Nalan of Mianchi*

To govern with impartiality surpasses the practice of the Dao,
This saying should be inscribed on the sashes of all officials.
Do not seek out hemp-robed recluses beyond the world,
But rather use good medicine to succor the suffering people.
*Presented to Master Song*

Not reading alchemical classics or the books of the sages,
Come swiftly to a heart without a speck of dust.
This body then befriends the clouds,
Going and staying with them, coiling and unfurling.
*Announcement by Yuan the Daoist*

The Great Dao is empty and nonexistent, fundamentally natural,
Let it twist and turn—just follow its green hues.
Success and failure, nobility and lowliness are all fated,
Cleverness and clumsiness, wisdom and folly rest with heaven.
*Presented to Zhang the Recorder of the Central Capital*

Long enamored of the red dust, coming and going often,
How could you know that hermits dwell in forests and springs?
Greedily watching dewdrops on flower tips at sunrise,
You lose the everlasting spring within the gourd.
*Announcement to Chief Wang*

Breaking open chaos to see the celestial truth,
Leaping beyond the red dust as a carefree person.
Idly gazing in the mirror to observe transformations,
Do not let the mirror transform your own body.
*Presented to Vice Commissioner Zhang*

I originally held my rod to fish for the giant turtle,
Let the winds rage and waves rise.
As long as the divine creature swallows the fragrant bait,
Ten thousand miles of soaring winds will not deter me.
*Presented to the Judge of the Bureau of Astronomy*

A lofty person taps at the gate with staff in hand,
Coming to visit a hemp-robed man with a bamboo bowl.
The Dao is present at a glance, forgetting argument,
Going with an empty heart, returning with fulfillment.
*Announcement to Chai the Daoist*

Within the body, stillness and few idle thoughts,
In the world, harmony and abundant qi.
Clean winds ever at my sides,
A single crimson ribbon emerges from misty vines.
*Sent to Zhang the Daoist*

Already having cast off this body like a silk thread,
A hundred kinds of fragrant bait hold no allure.
The Yangtze’s boundless waves remain fine,
Do not let worldly dust reach the brocade-scaled fish.
*Presented to Chief Zhao*

Spring’s light, counted on the fingers, has passed another autumn,
When will the trade in bones ever end?
Kindness and love form their livelihood,
This body becomes ox and horse for others.
*Presented to the Recluse Zhao of Yanshi County*

Awakened, Penglai lies but a footstep away,
Deluded, endless dust stretches on.
A single lamp’s flame, just trimmed,
Do not let the oil run out and darkness return.
*Presented to Old Shi the Daoist*

Within the gourd, golden towers and jade terraces,
Amid the moon, jasper flowers bloom resplendently.
Cranes cry in the azure sky, cinnabar phoenixes dance,
Deep in colored clouds lies Penglai.
*Presented to Zhao the Daoist*

The numinous terrace’s single point is originally without dust,
Illusory empty bodies manifest as dharma bodies.
The Dao resides within your nature—do not seek elsewhere,
Responding to circumstances with spontaneity is celestial truth.
*Shown to Chief Zhang of Longwo*

How many know the gate of my family?
Those who know must understand the mechanism of creation.
Within stillness lies wondrous function,
Within non-action hides the profound and subtle.
*Announcement by Quan the Daoist*

Who could bear to carve and cook?
Axes and hatchets ultimately cannot shape the gnarled.
Whether talented or not, all have their use,
Why then this life as a wooden crow?
*Announcement by Tian the Daoist*

To study the Dao, first comprehend spontaneity,
Only then can you attain the true immortal.
Dense or sparse, all is vain inversion,
You strive in vain, like drilling ice to make fire.
*Shown to the Three Lords’ Temple of Nanjing and Ke the Daoist*

True purity, true stillness, ever unbroken,
Refining qi first requires recognizing spontaneity.
A single grain of cinnabar, ninefold transmutation,
Auspicious radiance in ten thousand strands veils the golden immortal.
*Shown to Yuan the Immortal*

At the outset of entering the Dao, do not delay,
It is best to polish yourself diligently in the forest.
Do not let new dust tarnish the precious mirror,
Beware lest old realms harm celestial harmony.
*Presented to Liang the Daoist*

The luminous pearl reflects the great sun,
Within the crystal palace, it emits radiance.
This body possesses an inexhaustible treasure,
Yet for fleeting life, you toil in vain.
*Passing Mengjin*

Rolling smoke and waves flow eastward,
Bathing the sun, floating clouds—how many autumns?
If you obtain the numinous raft to roam the great sea,
In Fusang’s land, you will see Yingzhou.
*Shown to the Carpenter Yang the Immortal*

Traversing a thousand mountains, ten thousand mountains,
This body remains as leisurely as white clouds.
Returning to lie and watch the moon in the azure sky,
Pine winds clamor in the ears, chilling to the bone.
*Announcement by Dong the Observer of Knowing*

Great awakening reveals there is nothing to be done,
Mysterious words and secret sayings are all swept away.
Releasing hands east and west, trusting spontaneity,
Tapping a staff, roaming carefree through vast deserts.
*Presented to Tian the Daoist of Mount Song*

Having attained carefree wandering, I visit old friends,
Still cloud-hidden, nurturing celestial truth.
The west wind blows the moon from the pine’s tip,
Sitting, I await the sun’s wheel rolling from Fusang.
*Announcement to Chief Chu of the County*

Within the gate of Complete Perfection, selecting immortal material,
You tread through clouds and mountains for this very purpose.
Our Dao is easy to practice, no empty words,
Turning the world’s currents upside down is Penglai.
*Ode to Snow*

The north wind is fierce and mighty,
Blowing fallen heavenly flowers to blanket the earth.
Peach and plum do not yet know the heavens’ intent,
Winter plum first senses the workings of creation.
*Announcement to Li the Supervisor of Taxes in Yanshi County*

Breaking free from the boundless waves of desire,
Cleverness and wisdom truly surpass immortal material.
The celestial numinous treasure is hard for people to find,
I entrust it to the shadowless terrace of the Southern Palace.
*Shown to Shi the Daoist*

The gate of all wonders renews daily,
The family’s custom is pure and free from the slightest dust.
Idly summoning the long-lived guests beyond the clouds,
Together we enjoy the unwaning spring within the gourd.
*Self-Contentment*

Wind passes through the courtyard pines, calling me from noon slumber,
Awakening, the stone tripod still holds sinking smoke.
Not seeking feathered transformation to ride cloud-cranes,
I content myself as a mortal immortal on earth.
*Farewell to the Supreme Clarity Palace*

Westward I go, the west wind blowing my Daoist robes,
At the ancestral court, I have not yet attained true reliance.

The apes of other mountains and cranes of leisure have turned green,
Entrusted with the white clouds, I shall return again.
*For Master Shang the Immortal*

In the unseen, ghostly realms are ever dispatched,
Beyond the world, the gate of mystery opens daily.
Mozi grieved that silk is dyed by nature,
Yang Zhu wept on the road, never to return.
*For Officer Li*

A thousand leagues of misty waves, a single-leaf boat,
Light sail and short oar drift midstream.
In the glow of the toad’s light, idly I fish,
Heedless whether the whale takes the hook.
*For Daoist Friends in Chenzhou*

With merit achieved and name attained, best to withdraw,
Becoming a carefree man of forests and springs.
Gathering the sun’s essence as the great elixir,
Refining the moon’s spirit to manifest the yang spirit.
*For Officer Li of Fei Village*

Not yet having abandoned the world’s dust in learning the Dao,
The seas and mountains accumulate grain by grain.
Take further steps through the gate of mystery,
For Penglai holds another heaven within its caves.
*For Daoist Friend of Baisha*

Restrain the wildness of apes and horses, lock them tight,
Do not crave worldly pleasures, heart drunk with desire.
Awakened, leap beyond the gate of life and death,
The true nature of the spirit flows without obstruction.
*For Daoist Friend Li*

The immortal’s five-acre Penglai isle,
Four hundred autumn waves, exceptionally clear.
Sight and sound need not bind ears and eyes,
On the path of the subtle and tranquil, level as a plain.
*For Kou Tian and Jiang Menyou*

Each person merely recites Amitābha’s name,
Yet does one truly grasp Amitābha’s self?
Remember the original ancestor without form—
Unconnected to prajñā or pāramitā.

*For Lay Leader Li*

The gate of all wonders opens day by day,
The house’s ancient wind steep and free of dust.
Though plain and without distraction,
It does not permit the careless to enter.

*For Ren the Laywoman*

Shatter the knot of doubt and laugh aloud,
No need to wander far in search of answers.
What fills your breast shines bright as the moon—
Why seek another’s candle in the night?

*For Daoist Shi*

Beyond things lies the subtle and profound,
One side collapses as the other rises.
Later guests of Penglai Isle
Walk not the road to E.

*For Lay Leader Chen*

A bend of flowing water, Cloud Creek’s stream,
Day and night murmurs the mechanism of the Dao.
How many come and go, seekers of fame and gain,
Greedy to watch the waves, blind to the subtle.

*For Daoist Wang*

A straight hook does not hook the moon in waves,
Fine nets cannot scoop clouds from the water’s depths.
Exhausting body and mind, you stray far from the Way—
Release all conditions, and transmission may be yours.

*For the Elder of Longxi*

Gazing eastward, leaves fly from the trees,
Autumn’s qi fills the sky, pressing upon one’s robes.
The immortal elder has reached the cinnabar heavens,
Leisurely facing green pines, sipping the azure mist.

*For Laywoman Li the Younger*

To leave the household, one must learn to be an immortal,
To make good karma for long life.
If but one thought lingers here,
A golden lotus will bloom in the Jasper Pool.

*For Clerk Liu*

Beyond the dust of splendor, a guest of Three Mountains,
A single leaf of a boat upon the bitter sea’s waves.
Cast silk and thread into the deep swells—
Which fish among them would take the hook?

*For Daoist Ji and Li the Grinder*

Cease thoughts, forget schemes, follow nature,
No need to seek the Dao or study Chan.
A drifting wisp of idle cloud arises—
It obstructs the ever-bright heaven within the gourd.

*For Lay Leader Ji of Xiashi County*

In dreams, one speaks of dreams’ affairs,
Awakened, one knows the dream is done.
Brush the stone by South Creek, watch things transform,
The waters flow ever eastward as before.

*For Lay Leader of Shanzhou*

The elixir of spirit is ever grasped in the palm,
The mirror of mystery rests only in the heart.
Illuminating the world’s illusory realms,
Naturally the body drifts like a wild cloud at ease.

*For Daoist Wang of Jade Creek Hermitage*

Where in life is there no freedom?
What matter if mountain village or marketplace?
When the inch of heart is free of all fear,
Even among tigers and wolves, one is at peace.

*For Lay Leader Xia of Fei Village*

My family’s gate is profoundly mysterious,
Silent and empty, following nature.
Speak not of length or brevity, great or small—
Hungry, eat; weary, sleep.

*Retiring from the Hall of Great Clarity*

I was once a guest on Peach Blossom Peak,
Suddenly leaving traces among men.
Though the ancestral court is fine, the cause was early—
For now, let the white clouds return to their home mountain.

*Again*

The wind’s chariot drifts lightly to the ancestral court,
Auspicious smoke, fragrant grasses, sweet osmanthus.
The cause not yet complete, one must turn back—
Return to Yi River, to rest beneath brocade curtains.

*Returning to the Longevity Abbey*

Seeing through the ancient mask from the start,
A thousand wrongs, ten thousand slanders—let them be.
Light smoke, thin mist vainly obscure,
The distant mountains remain unfurrowed.

*Self-Expression*

Sever the opening at the head, no sound arises,
The dark pearl is gathered into a jeweled vase.
From now on, no boasting of foolishness or wisdom—
When the general is idle, there is great peace.

*Visiting Lord Lao Mountain*

Sleeves fluttering in the wind, stepping from the mountain gate,
Turning back, the green peaks resemble Lord Lao.
Listen to the clear spring converse with the mountain companion—
It clearly speaks the entirety of the Five Thousand Characters.

*For Daoist Hu of Zhicha Mountain*

Deep in the tangled mountains, thatched hut is built,
Ten thousand acres of clouds and mist cannot be swept away.
The immortal boy gathering herbs in wind-blown sleeves—
Rare fragrance follows as purple mushrooms appear.

*For Lay Leader Zhang*

To be immortal or Buddha requires effort,
Dust-thoughts and dust-heart must be carefully removed.
When the numinous brightness illuminates the cosmos,
Only then do you know the dregs of worldly books.

*For Lady Controller Puchá*

I love the extraordinary scenes of forests and springs,
Heaven’s wind scatters the fragrance of osmanthus.
The traveler, about to depart, turns back again—
Laughing at the futile busyness of floating life.

*For Lady Puchá’s Longevity*

The Daoist would also wish her long life,
Yet worldly affairs are dark and unknown.
A single grain of the immortal elixir—pray take it—
Pine years and crane tallies are nothing strange.

*For Lady Sun, Wife of the Grand Preceptor*

Before merit and fame are complete, the body ages first,
White hair, a pale face—too late to begin.
Suddenly awakened, this body is not mine—
True emptiness unmoved, a single cloud drifts.

*For Lay Leader Tian*

Radiant and luminous, this is the heart,
A single word casts a shadow, creating heavy darkness.
The true message lies in pure emptiness—
Do not seek it among the methods of the many schools.

*For Laywoman Ma*

Creation is endless, naturally so,
No need to seek immortality beyond the body.
Where the light of heaven shines, worldly passions vanish,
When the precious mirror is bright, the Dao-eye is whole.

*End of the Lower Scroll of the Collected Works of the Old Man of Li Peak*
