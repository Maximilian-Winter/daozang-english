**The Scripture of the Eight Emperors’ Primordial Transformations of the Cavernous Spirit**

**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of the Eight Emperors’ Primordial Transformations of the Cavernous Spirit*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. One of the ancient scriptures of the Cavernous Spirit Department, it encompasses methods for summoning and commanding the spirits of the Eight Trigrams. One scroll. Base text sourced from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Proper Section I.

**Preface to *The Scripture of the Eight Emperors’ Primordial Transformations of the Cavernous Spirit***

In the vast obscurity of the world, the paths of profit and harm are difficult to discern. Before gain or loss takes shape, the mechanisms of safety and peril are seldom recognized. Thus, the myriad beings and common folk unwittingly tread the paths of hardship, stumbling into perilous straits. Those who encounter such adversity do so because they cannot foresee survival or demise, thereby falling into danger.

What both the sagely and the ordinary treasure is life; what the wise and the foolish alike cherish is the body. Yet the sage delights in life, hence establishing teachings to guard against misfortune. Through statutes and commands, they restrain the heart prone to error; through rites and laws, they open the way of reverence and deference; through divination, they dispel the confusion of right and wrong. Though these methods differ in their means of aiding life and upholding teachings to curb transgressions, they converge as distinct paths leading to the same end, each contributing uniquely yet achieving the same purpose.

The essential Dao of nurturing life lies in nothing more than avoiding harm. To avoid harm, what surpasses dispelling delusion? To dispel delusion, nothing excels divination; in divination, nothing precedes the spirits. The spirits’ utility manifests in omens revealed in celestial patterns, in calamities disclosed through earthly configurations, or in fortune and misfortune woven into human affairs.

As the *Book of Changes* states: *"One who knows the Dao of transformation knows what the spirit does."* The spirit conceals the past and foresees the future, subtly completing the myriad things. Thus, if one can commune with the spirit, they align with its power—not merely to dissolve disasters or augment wisdom.

The texts for summoning and commanding spirits have long existed. Dongfang Shuo and Yi Feng were hailed as sagely in the Han dynasty, while Guo Pu and Han Ji displayed marvels in the Jin. Yet those who reaped success while dwelling in seclusion and mountain forests are too numerous to count. Though this art has been transmitted for ages, its lineage stretches distant and obscure, its words and meanings fragmented, making it difficult to fully comprehend.

Even if a worthy adept were to verify its efficacy, they might fear that divulging it would invite misfortune, thus concealing their mastery. Hence, they hesitate to transmit it. Unless one shares a bond of golden friendship or a sworn pact, how could they reveal the truth and manifest its workings? Only those whose destiny aligns with the Dao and whose allotment accords with the art of command may encounter a master and grasp its essentials.

The version of this text transmitted in the world was compiled by the Buddhist monk Huizong. Its spirit diagrams and medicinal substances occupy no more than three sheets, yet all the drug names have been altered, rendering them unrecognizable and deviating entirely from the *Materia Medica*. In my youth, I was drawn to the arts and weary of the world, yearning for the Dao. I studied this text tirelessly, never tiring of its words. Yet its chapters were flawed and incomplete, offering no thread to follow. The art is profound and subtle, with few who achieve its effects. Thus, I sighed for worthy companions with whom to consult, but found none.

Unwavering in my devotion, I resolved to delve into its mysteries. Near and far, I sought teachers, diligently inquiring until I encountered a master who had verified this art through experience. From then on, I rose at dawn and retired at dusk, reverently embracing the past. Through direct oral instruction, all my doubts were resolved. I corrected the drug names, mastered the regimen for ingestion, and fully grasped the use of talismans. I learned the steps of Yu, the pacing of the foot-measure, the rituals for erecting altars, and the various omens of verification. Having attained the essence of these principles, I now expound upon them by analogy, arranging them according to their proper applications and organizing them into fifteen chapters.

Those who study this art must first understand the sequence, excel in its essential texts, and thus establish an outline as the scripture’s preface: **"Outline and Chapter Headings"** as the first.

The sovereign spirits differ in form and function, their powers vastly distinct. Revealing their hidden communion inspires admiration, hence **"The Spirit Diagrams and Their Abilities"** as the second.

The practice of the art and the advancement of its principles each have auspicious times. Movement and stillness depend on the day, thus **"Discourse on the Essentials of Timing"** as the third.

The pacing of the steps and the recitation of incantations require prior practice. The urgency of summoning and verification makes this most pressing, hence **"Yu’s Steps to Invoke the Spirit"** as the fourth.

The efficacy of talismans and arts stems from verification. Mastery ensures swift application, thus **"Ingesting Talismans to See Spirits"** as the fifth.

If medicinal ingredients are spoiled or the heart lacks devotion, the spirits will not descend. Only with fresh, fragrant offerings and a reverent mind will the numinous beings descend, hence **"Consuming Medicines to Commune with Spirits"** as the sixth.

Those who wish to practice the art must cultivate serenity. Without proper preparation, the art will not yield results, hence **"The Spirit Chamber and Its Location"** as the seventh.

A vegetarian diet and plain attire suffice to move the spirits. Frugality and restraint, if not sustained, cannot fulfill the precepts, hence **"The Practitioner’s Diet and Attire"** as the eighth.

Only through purity and reverence can one summon the spirits. The radiant numina bestow blessings in response to sincerity, hence **"Purity and Offerings During the Fast"** as the ninth.

Offerings must follow proper methods, with measured portions. Differences in presented flavors may disrupt invocations, hence **"Arranging Seats and Presenting Offerings"** as the tenth.

When the host of spirits is about to appear, omens manifest beforehand. Without foreknowledge, one may be overwhelmed by fear, hence **"Omens and Manifestations of Forms"** as the eleventh.

Having attained communion with the spirits, one must guard against disturbance. To transmit the art, avoid reckless disclosure, hence **"Moderation in Application"** as the twelfth.

Many who command spirits suffer harm, all due to improper control, thus incurring such losses, hence **"Maintaining Control over Spirits"** as the thirteenth.

Relying on one’s knowledge, many seek to flaunt or peddle it. Disclosing it to the unworthy invites destruction, hence **"Admonitions for Self-Preservation"** as the fourteenth.

The mediocre disbelieve and delight in slander; the foolish and ignorant may mock or revile. Thus, **"Verifications by Past Masters"** as the fifteenth.

With my humble and limited insight, I have arranged these chapters by their themes, composing their verses. The scripture’s essentials and applications shine as brightly as the sun; its words and phrases gleam, forming a coherent whole. Though it may not encompass all teachings, it contains what is necessary. May those who seek wisdom and discernment study and find it complete.

**The Scripture of the Eight Emperors’ Primordial Transformations – Outline and Contents, Chapter One**

The Yellow Emperor said: The Eight Great Ghostly Spirits of the Southern Dipper’s scribes, known as the Envoys of August Heaven, each govern a fixed day. They descend to the human realm, roaming the world to protect and nurture those who cultivate the Dao. Those who purify their bodies, revere the teachings, and serve with earnest devotion shall surely behold their forms. They become one’s supreme companions, accompanying them whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining. Matters of fortune or misfortune are forewarned, and the subtle stirrings of all phenomena are revealed in advance. They can avert disasters before they arise and bestow blessings unseen. No treasure is weightier than this teaching—it must be guarded in secret.

If one is kind, obedient, loyal, and untainted by worldly rank, nurturing their nature with indifference as though unaware, seeking only for oneself and devoted wholly to the Dao, even then an oath must be sworn before transmission may proceed. Should this teaching be lightly shown to the unworthy, its powers flaunted or peddled, or its divine intent disclosed, neither giver nor receiver shall benefit. Beware—do not, through arrogance or carelessness, invite calamity by leaking it.

The Yellow Emperor said: The practitioner’s duty lies in purifying their resolve, unifying their mind, and single-mindedly focusing their thoughts. Through tranquil observation and unwavering practice, day and night without slack, they restrain body and mind, cutting off wayward thoughts. Wayward thoughts cloud the mind’s clarity; an unclear mind obscures perception; obscured perception prevents delving into subtleties and discerning the formless. How can one who is indolent and negligent ever move the unseen?

Those who do not cling to life but devote themselves wholeheartedly to the pursuit are like water cascading from the heavens, effortlessly filling a thousand-fathom ravine. But those who merely bear the name of goodness without sincere resolve are like drawing water from a hidden gorge to surmount the peaks of the sky—so difficult is their path. Even in worldly affairs, carelessness and laziness yield no results. How much more so for the profound and subtle Dao—can it be attained without fervent dedication? Strive on, for diligence is the key.

All practitioners must first master the *Yu Steps* and the sacrificial texts. The methods within the art require silent recitation and oral retention until fluent. Offerings of herbs and viands must be of the finest quality. On the day of *gengyin*, enter the retreat to prepare the medicines and inscribe the talismans. On the day of *gengzi*, at dawn before the hour of *yin*, enter the chamber, arrange the seat, display the talismans, wear the talisman, perform the *Yu Steps*, consume the talisman and medicine, then hold the tablet, recite the text, and make offerings before the altar. The scripture’s words must flow smoothly—hesitation delays efficacy. This is the essential framework of the art, the general outline of its key principles, and what practitioners must observe.

The retreat’s halls and spirit chambers should be vast, empty, and serene, kept immaculately clean and fragrant. Clothing, utensils, and altars must be refined. Conduct and demeanor must be flawless.

**The Divine Charts and Powers, Chapter Two**

The Eight Great Ghostly Spirits are all scribes of the Southern Dipper, stellar deities of the constellations. If a practitioner cultivates the Dao with utmost sincerity, a pure heart, and devotion to talismans and medicines, practicing the *Yu Steps* with diligence, these eight spirits will attend to them like celestial officials, constantly shielding and protecting them without fail. Before signs of fortune or misfortune manifest, before blessings or calamities take shape, the spirits foresee them and issue warnings in advance, ensuring the practitioner always benefits.

Yet each spirit’s efficacy differs, their skills and functions varied. Some can repel weapons and command respect, avenge wrongs, or exact retribution. Some procure medicines to bestow immortality. Some secure official positions, dispel slander, bring joy, or attract wealth. Some enable true visions of spirits and discernment of spectral beings. Some transform misfortune into fortune, provide sustenance in hunger, or serve as healers, foretelling life and death, transmitting messages across a thousand miles, sharpening wit, amassing wealth for the practitioner, doubling harvests of crops and silkworms, summoning rare treasures, warding off thieves at night, or repelling tigers and pursuers. Their effects are boundless—no book could exhaust their descriptions. Here, their powers are briefly outlined, their divine charts recorded, arranged by the scripture’s sequence as follows:

*Light-blue robe, light-red skirt*
**First Spirit of Qian**, named **Xingwen**. He can inspire people and repel weapons.

Where this spirit enters and departs, people always hold it in reverence. It can avenge grievances, journey forth to eliminate harm for others, and dispel yin and malevolent matters.

This spirit wears a round cap with three ridges, bound with a hempen cord, and dons an archaic robe with a leather belt. In its right hand, it wields a blade, while its left hangs down.

*Light-red robe, light-yellow skirt with blue trim*
**Second Spirit of Kun**, named **Xingcheng**. It can procure the elixir of immortality that grants ten thousand years of undying life. From holes in the earth, it retrieves fish a foot long, which, when fed to people, bestows longevity of ten thousand years. Formerly, four practitioners—Zhang Yong, Su Jing, Xing Bian, and Dong Xuan—employed this spirit to obtain such fish. They attained the Dao in due time and now dwell in Yangsui Mountain, sustaining themselves without grain while enjoying boundless years.

*Dark-blue robe and skirt with black trim*
**Third Spirit of Zhen**, named **Xingsong**. It can confer wealth and nobility, securing hereditary marquisates, warding off slander and defamation, ensuring freedom from blame, fulfilling all endeavors, and filling one’s heart with constant joy. Crops yield double harvests, all evils cease, and every desire aligns with the heart’s intent.

*Light-yellow robe, light-red skirt with black trim*
**Fourth Spirit of Xun**, named **Xingming**. By holding this script for three years—without practicing the *Yu Bu* step or consuming medicinal herbs—one naturally gains clear vision of spirits, perceiving them with vivid clarity. All earthly spirits—those dwelling in trees, waters, soil, mountains, forests, gates, doors, wells, latrines, dwellings, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, insects, birds, wolves, tigers, and every spectral being—along with the two hundred forty-odd types of anomalies recorded in scriptures, manifest in their true forms. Without ingesting talismans or herbs, merely holding this text for three years, one attains perfection.

*Purple robe with green trim and yellow skirt*
**Fifth Spirit of Kan**, named **Xinger**. If falsely accused or wronged, or if one’s conduct is unjustly questioned, it can first transform the sovereign’s perception, turning misfortune into fortune, allowing one to stride free and unscathed until proof emerges. In times of famine, it can also procure food and grain without end.

**Light crimson robe with dark green trim and black hem**
**Sixth Spirit of Li**, named **Xingxu**. It enables the practitioner to become a healer or diviner, foreseeing life and death. If a household suffers illness, it discerns with certainty whether the condition will improve or worsen, or whether death is imminent. It can procure news from a thousand *li* away, revealing even the most intricate details. It sharpens the senses, allowing one to acquire gold, silver, and valuables and place them in another’s home. This must be kept secret.

**Light green robe with pale yellow skirt and black hem**
**Seventh Spirit of Gen**, named **Xingjin**. It ensures bountiful harvests and silkworm yields. It can also summon rare and precious treasures, filling one’s home, and instantly procure fish and meat. It can call forth women from a thousand *li* away, who will arrive at will. This must not be shared with others—guard it closely, even for ten thousand gold.

**Plain white robe with dark green skirt and trim**
**Eighth Spirit of Dui**, named **Xinggao**. It allows one to travel at night without fear, avoiding bandits and warding off the twenty-seven evils. It commands tigers and wolves, outrunning even galloping horses. This must be kept most secret.

These eight great spirits descend to the mortal realm in pairs, each pair arriving on their appointed day and rotating every three days in an unbroken cycle. Those who receive them should, on the designated day, purify a chamber and set up an altar between the door and its western pivot. Call their names, and they will respond without fail—tested a hundred times, proven a hundred times true. From ancient sages to later worthies, this tradition has been revered and transmitted. How could it be empty deception, meant to mislead later generations? What benefit would that bring to those who came before? For those devoted to the Dao, if they honor these spirits with sincere offerings, the effects will manifest in an instant.

### **Chapter Three: On the Essentials of Timing**

The interplay of the Two Modes is called the Great Creation. What the Great Creation requires must be reckoned by yin and yang; what yin and yang revere is governed by the sun and moon. The sun and moon establish the Four Seasons, and the efficacy of the Four Seasons is called *tongbian* (adaptive transformation). Through *tongbian*, all things are accomplished. The generation of all things depends on the proper use of time—its benefits are vast and profound. Thus, it shapes the myriad beings, sculpts the multitude of existences, and allows latent potentials to sprout. Time guides and refines, yet its guidance remains unseen; it ages and decays things, yet their decay goes unnoticed. Time is subtle and profound, and its effects are inevitable. It sustains all living things, though they use it unawares—only the enlightened perceive its workings. Those who grasp this principle will surely succeed in their endeavors, for time must not be lost.

All actions depend on timing. Thus, the use of time is vast and great, the foundation of all things. If the celestial timing falters, wind and rain fall out of balance; if the earthly timing stagnates, the dark and yellow fail to nurture; if human timing is neglected, the constant norms collapse. Even the wise and discerning, whether active or reclusive, silent or vocal, must observe the signs of time and adapt before they can find peace. As Yao said: *"Revere the vast heavens and respectfully receive the seasons."* And Lü Wang said: *"Time does not come again—hard to gain, easy to lose; hard to complete, easy to ruin."* This is the essence of time.

Thus, time moves heaven and earth, stirs spirits and gods, and fulfills human affairs. It may be called the consummate function of the Three Powers and the divine work of the Six Directions. Therefore, all Daoist arts and scholarly pursuits must follow the patterns of yin and yang and observe the seasons. Only in auspicious months and propitious days may techniques be performed. The sole cause of failure lies in excess or deficiency—this is the greatest harm to success and the grand principle of achievement. A deviation as slight as a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand *li*. Thus, those who seek to establish merit must focus their will on the realm of timing, anchor their spirit in the domain of responsive opportunity, and dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to this pursuit, even at the cost of life and limb.

The second and last months of autumn, along with the first month of spring and summer, are the three most auspicious periods. Spring is the season when wood flourishes, and the virtue of wood is benevolence, which governs good fortune. Among the four seasons, none surpasses the splendor of spring. Spring marks the ascent of the green and the retreat of the dark, the renewal of all things. The year’s radiance is resplendent, the qi of the season lush and flourishing. Days are tranquil, nights serene; warmth and coolness harmonize. The time is mild, the scenery bright, and human nature gentle. This is when practitioners should cultivate their resolve.

For cultivation, one may choose a spacious garden within a settlement, a vast plain in the wilderness, or a tranquil retreat in a famous mountain. At such times, the wilds are verdant, the seasons unfold in beauty, bamboo shades the mountain steps, thatched eaves border the garden, and flowers scatter their rare fragrances. A thousand patterns emerge, leaves disperse in myriad forms, and countless new shapes appear. Some dwell in pavilions beside ponds, others in ornate halls nestled against mountains, or in secluded chambers veiled in mist, or in lofty towers half-hidden in the clouds. The cries of birds echo in the wind, the roar of waters cascades like rivers reaching the sea. In such moments, one may ride dragons and phoenixes, harness cranes and simurghs, whip cloud chariots to ascend the dark courts, or mount rainbow carriages to reach the purple pole. How much more, then, can lesser arts be accomplished?

Summer is the second-best time, while autumn and winter are inferior. Spring is supreme not only because its qi is harmonious and its time auspicious, but also because it is ideal for gathering fresh bird eggs and preparing medicines. Summer still offers late-hatched eggs, hence its secondary rank. Autumn and winter are inferior because eggs may spoil and medicines lose their potency, delaying the effects of the arts. If circumstances prevent using the two superior seasons, dried eggs may be used in autumn and winter, and the techniques will still suffice for spiritual efficacy.

Thus the scripture states: "Only virtue is fragrant; millet and glutinous millet are not fragrant. The divine spirits savor virtue—why must they rely solely on sacrificial meats, medicines, and offerings?"

**Method for Purification Days:**
Before entering the spirit chamber, one should observe purification for seven times seven days (forty-nine days). If circumstances prevent this, even seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days of purification suffice. On the day of *gengzi*, one may enter the spirit chamber to examine the proceedings.

**Method for Compounding Medicines:**
Prepare the ingredients in advance. On the day of *gengyin*, enter the spirit chamber at the hour of *ren ding* (9–11 p.m.). Pound and blend the medicines, then inscribe the talismans to completion.

**Method for Taking Medicines:**
On the day of *gengzi*, enter the spirit chamber before the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.). First perform the Yu Step and ingest the talisman, then take the medicine. Afterward, recite the scriptures and perform the sacrifice. The talismans follow the medicine day, so no further elaboration is needed.

**Method for Sacrificial Times:**
Morning sacrifices are conducted before the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.), and evening sacrifices after the hour of *ren ding* (9–11 p.m.).

**Days of Divine Descent:**
- **Xingwen and Xingcheng:** These two spirits descend into households on the days of *yin*, *mao*, and *chen* (tiger, hare, and dragon).
- **Xingsong and Xingming:** These two spirits descend on the days of *si*, *wu*, and *wei* (serpent, horse, and ram).
- **Xinger and Xingxu:** These two spirits descend on the days of *shen*, *you*, and *xu* (monkey, rooster, and dog).
- **Xingjin and Xinggao:** These two spirits descend on the days of *hai*, *zi*, and *chou* (pig, rat, and ox).

The eight spirits each have their designated days of descent. To summon them, begin on the day of *gengzi*, enter the spirit chamber, call their names, and sacrifice to invoke them.

**Time Limit for Divine Manifestation:**
When properly revered and sacrificed to for fifteen days, the spirits will fully manifest, speak with the practitioner, and follow their footsteps, ready to be questioned or employed.

**Time of Divine Appearance:**
The spirits may appear before the hour of *yin* (3–5 a.m.), after the hour of *hai* (9–11 p.m.), or at midnight. Though their timing may vary unpredictably, they will not depart from these three periods, which are most auspicious for the practitioner’s year and season.

The arts of commanding spirits and employing ghosts are among the most profound and hidden texts of the Dao, methods for Daoists seeking transcendence. Some are noble persons—pure of heart, devoted to the Dao, fond of stillness and solitude, their aspirations set on nurturing life. They withdraw from the world, abandon fame and rank, shun the dust of the mundane, dwell in quietude and emptiness, and avoid entanglement with worldly affairs. Such individuals, when they pursue these studies, will surely attain the Dao, achieving not merely subtle or manifest knowledge but true realization.

Others are gentlemen who embrace benevolence, uphold sincerity, embody righteousness, and practice loyalty. Though their devotion to the Dao runs deep, they cannot abandon the world, for their lives are entwined with its ways. They, too, may practice these arts. Yet they must guard against careless disclosure before results manifest, lest they recklessly reveal omens of fortune or misfortune. If spirits harass or deceive them, or if they delude the people, those who encounter such misfortune will seldom escape punishment by blade or execution. Thus, these arts are not suited for the common folk; only those with an unwavering passion should pursue them.

Those too young in years should not study these methods. Only after the age of forty may one practice them. In the prime of life, such practices proceed without regret. Even if one possesses profound wisdom and vast learning, only those capable of treasuring secrecy may study them without harm. Those who can meet these standards may be called the clear mirrors of heaven and earth, the luminous hearts of the six directions. The subsequent chapters contain earnest and sincere instructions, so no further elaboration is needed here.

**Chapter Four: The Yu Step for Invoking Spirits**

The Yu Step is a method devised by Yu the Great of Xia for summoning and commanding spirits through a ritualized gait. It is the root of all arts and the essential mechanism of the profound Dao.

When Yu the Great governed the floods, their depths and heights were unfathomable. He devised black measuring tools and repeated observations to gauge the waters. Where hidden springs or massive boulders lay beyond sight, he summoned the deities of the sea, rivers, mountains, and earth to resolve the uncertainties. Once, on the shores of the Southern Sea, he witnessed a bird’s incantation that could overturn great stones. As the bird performed its spell, it executed this very step. Yu imitated its movements and incorporated them into his arts. From then on, his defenses were invincible. Because Yu created it, it is called the Yu Step.

Since the decline of later ages, those who seek the Dao have multiplied, and practitioners have proliferated, expanding its applications in countless ways. After the time of Liu An, the Prince of Huainan, there emerged writings by Wang Zinian, and verses compiled by the monk Huizong. Extending its principles, they developed over ninety variations, each with different footwork and distinct incantations. Upon careful examination and verification, none surpass the original method: stepping first with the left foot, taking three steps to form nine tracks, which align with the *Li* and *Kan* trigrams. The step’s framework follows the nine stars of the Dipper, modeled after this pattern. From then on, no other method has proven more effective, and this is the one to study.

For those who wish to summon spirits and see ghosts, the Yu Step is of utmost urgency. Both the step and the incantation must be memorized thoroughly. When performed skillfully, the spirits arrive; when clumsily executed, they depart or grow distant. Thus, the preceding verified methods and diagrams are presented as follows.

**Method of the Yu Step:**
Within the chamber, the practitioner faces the spirit altar. Using a summer ruler, measure three *chi* to determine the spacing between the stars. Draw the star diagram and the eight trigrams with pure white ash. The practitioner stands at *dihu* (the earth gate, *xun* position), facing the seated spirit altar. They then strike the celestial drum fifteen times, hold their breath, and begin the step.

First, lift the left foot to tread on *Li*, the right foot on *Kun*, the left foot on *Zhen*, and the right foot on *Dui*. Then bring the left foot alongside the right to form *Dui*. Next, advance the right foot to tread on *Gen*, the left foot on *Kan*, the right foot on *Qian*, and the left foot on the *Heavenly Gate*. Finally, bring the right foot to tread on the *Human Gate*, and stand with the left foot alongside the right on the *Human Gate*. Then exhale and recite the incantation:

*"Qian*, exalted and radiant;
*Kun*, compliant and inwardly nurturing.
The Two Modes harmonize in prosperity,
uniting in perfect balance.
Heaven and earth conjoin,
eternally tranquil and pure.
Responding to the mysterious and the yellow,
above as robes, below as skirts.
*Zhen*, *Li*, *Kan*, *Dui*—
*Xun* aids and upholds.
*Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, *Xun*—
tiger’s stride and dragon’s tread.
Heavenly Gate and Earthly Gate,
Human Gate and the pivot’s measure.
Who guards me?
The vast heaven, azure and boundless.
Today, with the Yu Step,
I align with the celestial net.
Ghosts and spirits submit as guests,
banishing all inauspiciousness.
May my desires be fulfilled,
answered by timely numinous light.
Those who resist shall be subdued
beneath the net’s mighty mesh.
Without movement, without action—
hasten as the command of the Most High Lord Lao!"

**Chapter Five: Ingesting Talismans to See Spirits**

Talismans are the divine scripts by which celestial immortals summon and command spirits, the sacred treasures of the adept’s numinous chapters. In the arts of Dao, there is nothing they do not govern. Thus it is said: The mysterious script descends in symbols, and the king’s rise or decline is foretold; the earthly script reveals omens, and the people’s survival or ruin is shown. When anomalies appear in subtle signs, households must know good or ill; when tortoise and milfoil present their patterns, the diviner cannot but discern fortune or misfortune. Once the talismanic script is manifest, how can ghosts and spirits remain hidden?

Thus, Daoists employ the *Lingwen Taiban* (Numinous Script on Great Tablets), the *Zhenwen Dazi* (True Script in Large Characters), and the *Dulu Guifu* (Register of Ghost Talismans)—all secret texts for commanding spirits and the canonical decrees for ascending as immortals. The essentials of the perfected are concealed in none but talismans. By harnessing the power of these talismans, one may summon celestial deities and earthly spirits, dispel spectral beings, ingest them to attain immortality, or wear them to achieve eminent rank. To enumerate all their efficacies would fill volumes without end; thus, I briefly outline their principles, and the adept should bear them in mind.

**First: The Qian Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals manifest the script of advent. Suspend it above in the northwest. The Qian talisman is as before. The spirit of Qian is surnamed Liu, styled Bosheng—swallow it.

**Second: The Kun Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals establish the pillar of completion. Suspend it above in the southwest. The Kun talisman is as before. The spirit of Kun is surnamed Zhu, styled Jiangmeng—swallow it.

**Third: The Zhen Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals erect the framework of the pine. Suspend it above in the due east. The Zhen talisman is as before. The spirit of Zhen is surnamed Liu, styled Liangqing—swallow it.

**Fourth: The Xun Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals illuminate the essence of the mysterious. Suspend it above in the southeast. The Xun talisman is as before. The spirit of Xun is surnamed Zhang, styled Caolong—swallow it.

**Fifth: The Kan Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals raise the great edifice of the child. Suspend it above in the due north. The Kan talisman is as before. The spirit of Kan is surnamed Jiao, styled Junzi—swallow it.

**Sixth: The Li Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals arrange the essence of the sun. Suspend it above in the due south. The Li talisman is as before. The spirit of Li is surnamed Feng, styled Maxu—swallow it.

**Seventh: The Gen Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals advance the origin of the sun. Suspend it above in the northeast. The Gen talisman is as before. The spirit of Gen is surnamed Wang, styled Yuping—swallow it.

**Eighth: The Dui Talisman**
The talisman by which immortals ascend the great mystery. Suspend it above in the due west. The Dui talisman is as before. The spirit of Dui is surnamed Liu, styled Mengyuan—swallow it.

The Yellow Emperor said: To summon the Eight Historians and command ghosts and spirits, one must, on the *gengyin* day at the hour of *rending* (human quietude), enter the purification chamber. Take a paulownia board three inches square, split it lengthwise toward the established direction, and coat it with cinnabar. Hold the breath and inscribe it with ink, completing all eight talismans at once, then place them in the spirit chamber. On the *gengzi* day, set them beside the altar, positioned above the eight directions. On that same day, draw the eight trigrams’ talismans with cinnabar and swallow them. Cease only after seeing the spirits.

The Yellow Emperor said: These talismans are what perfected immortals practice. If the adept is sincere, resolute, and reverently follows the precepts, meticulously adhering to the scriptural method and maintaining purity in their preparation, suspending them will surely cause ghosts and spirits to appear at once, arriving as soon as summoned. Prolonged ingestion may even lead to ascending to heaven in broad daylight—how could it be merely about communicating with spirits?

**Chapter Six: Ingesting Medicines to Communicate with Spirits**

The uses of medicines are vast and great. All sentient beings with consciousness rely on them to sustain their bodies. Thus, the *huandan* (returned elixir) and *yuye* (jade liquid) are the secret Dao of immortals; rare herbs and numinous mushrooms are the essential path of nurturing life. Medicines may be called the life of flowing form and the heart of sagely attainment. Speaking of their functions: some can summon clouds and bring rain, cure illnesses and commune with spirits, subdue tigers and repel weapons, avert disasters and suppress thieves. Some sharpen the ears and eyes, others transform the nature and spirit. Thus, cinnabar prolongs the years, silver powder extends life; gypsum induces sweating, *daji* (euphorbia) purges; ephedra enables seeing ghosts, henbane aids in needle retrieval. Such are the natures of medicines—each possesses unique powers, achieving all things without exception. Their merits equal those of heaven and earth, their transformations align with the four seasons. Their virtues are boundless, beyond full enumeration.

**One part Ghost Arrow** (also called *guijian*; the present *guijian* herb)
Crush and use the feathers along with the skin; roots, leaves, branches, and stems are not needed. Found in mountains, gather and use it as needed.

**One part Ghost Fan** (also called *fangshan*)
This herb grows abundantly in mountain marshes; no further description is needed.

**One part Ghost Press** (also called *shizha*)
This medicine grows where water flows over shady mountain stones—it is the moss on such stones. Found wherever water flows over shady mountain stones, it resembles the algae in water.

**One part Ghost Sprout** (in another method, use the sprout of *guiduyou*, called *guimiao*)
Using it also yields efficacious results.

**Two parts Ghost Pestle**
In one text, one part of *guishan* root is this medicine. Commonly used and easily recognized, no detailed annotation is needed.

**Five *zhu* of true cinnabar**
This medicine is found within realgar but differs slightly from it. Its form and color are yellow, bright, and lustrous, surpassing realgar, and it lacks the strong sulfurous odor, though it remains a type of realgar.

**Three parts Crow’s Egg**
Easily recognized, no further description is needed.

In the second and third months of spring, gather them from bird nests—those that remain unbroken are of superior quality. If preparing the medicine, use them while still moist. Collect about fifteen, extract the yellow and white parts into a ceramic vessel, and dry them in the sun. Scrape off the contents, wrap them in paper, and store them for use in autumn and winter. The reason for drying them is that this medicine is only available at certain times; if sought outside its season, it may be difficult to obtain at short notice. Thus, they must be dried to prepare for unforeseen needs. When the medicine is to be taken, soak the eggs in spring water until they become moist, then mix them with the other ingredients to form pills. The method of preparation: prepare the six medicines in advance, ensuring all six ingredients are fresh and fragrant, free from decay. On an auspicious *gengyin* day, as prescribed in the scriptures, purify and hold the medicines. At the hour of *rending*, within the fasting chamber, face the direction of *jian* and break the eggs toward it. Pound the ingredients finely, sift them, and use the qi of the crow’s eggs to bind them into pills. During preparation, no one else should witness the process; only the practitioner should oversee it. If the method is leaked, it will lose efficacy, and all efforts will be in vain—this must be guarded with utmost care.

The method of taking the medicine: on an auspicious *gengzi* day before dawn, enter the spirit chamber. First, hang the talisman and wear it, then perform the *Yubu* step, consume the talisman and medicine, and finally make the offering. Before the morning offering, take the talisman once and the medicine once. Before the evening offering, take the talisman and medicine again. Two talismans and two pills, each the size of a *wutong* seed, constitute the daily regimen. When taking the medicine, hold a pill in the mouth for a long while, allowing it to dissolve before swallowing. Do not swallow it immediately upon placing it in the mouth, lest the spirits fail to descend. With sincere devotion and strict adherence to the method, within fifteen days, these eight ghostly spirits will all appear before you, speaking with you. Every trial proves true, and the results are never false. If you fear the spirits might deceive or lie, take one pill, wrap it, and bury it where the spirit first appeared. The summoned spirit will then never dare to utter falsehoods to anyone. This method of suppression has been tested repeatedly and is effective. The spirits are thus compelled to serve truthfully. Without taking the medicine, nothing will be seen. Only by consuming it can one attain spiritual communication and command the spirits in various ways. In this art, taking the medicine is of paramount importance.

Those who study the Dao claim superiority. Zhang Lu once declared that the *Daoist Immortal Scriptures* comprised forty scrolls and eighty million words. Upon careful examination, some methods require rare medicines and abstention from grains to attain immortality, while others allow normal grain consumption yet still lead to millennial transcendence. The reason for such differences lies in the varying intentions of the sages, each following their own path. I have extensively copied immortal recipes and inquired of spirits about medicines. The spirits recognize them and speak of their efficacy, for ghostly and divine beings are truthful and do not lie.

**Spirit Chamber, Seventh Section: The Method of Summoning and Commanding**
The method requires a secluded and tranquil place in the mountains. If distant wilderness cannot be found, seek a spacious and quiet garden or residence within a settlement to establish the fasting courtyard, ensuring no households in mourning are nearby. The chamber must be newly constructed; if circumstances prevent this, an old chamber may suffice. Within the spirit chamber, there must never have been a corpse or the filth of livestock birth. The floor should be plastered with fragrant mud, swept clean, and kept free from impurity to prevent delays in the method’s efficacy. To avoid deviations from the scriptures, the diagram of the spirit chamber’s form is provided below:

For protection, enclose the area with a wall or fence of piled brushwood, ensuring it is dense enough to prevent outsiders from seeing inside. The courtyard should be twenty paces square; if circumstances require, its size may be adjusted. Four paces from the southern and western walls of the courtyard, construct the spirit chamber with three rooms, each sixteen feet in length. In the eastern room, spread a mat on the floor for the practitioner, who should lie with their head facing north. The central room should have a door facing south. The western room should have doors on its southern, western, and northern sides. Within the western room, on the lower part of the three-sided door area, construct a spirit altar three inches high, made of piled earth, eight feet square, with two steps on each side. Mix white *shang* soil with powdered white grass incense, knead it thoroughly, and plaster the altar until it is fragrant, white, and pleasing. By the day of the offering, ensure it is dry and free from dampness or filth; do not allow it to become impure at the last moment.

To the east of the spirit chamber, establish a fasting room, ten feet square. Near the southern corners of the spirit chamber’s east and west sides, open a door to connect with the fasting room, covering it with a thick mat curtain to conceal the interior. Within the spirit chamber, open a one-foot-square window and paper it to allow light inside. To the north of the fasting room, construct another room, also ten feet square. Open a door at the northeastern corner of the fasting room’s northern side to connect with this room. Open another door at the northwestern corner of this room’s northern side for the practitioner’s entry and exit. All sacrificial implements and miscellaneous items should be stored in this room. Every room should have curtains and doors; the spirit chamber should be curtained with bamboo screens, while other rooms may use mat curtains.

**Practitioner’s Attire and Meals, Eighth Section**
Clothing serves to ward off cold and dampness and to express reverence. Worn-out garments reveal a lack of modesty, while new attire fosters courage. Wearing pendants and jade ornaments broadcasts elegance; donning armor and holding spears evokes martial spirit. Coarse cloth and mourning garments convey sorrow, while hempen crowns and straw sandals sharpen the aspiration for the Dao. As emotions shift with attire and intentions change with circumstances, the external and internal resonate, aligning the practitioner’s heart and summoning the spirits’ presence.

**Seeking Excellence and Preserving Life, Ninth Section**

Those who seek goodness preserve their nature and life by observing frugality or extravagance. Indulgence in rich meats and fine meals breeds arrogance, dissipation, and excess; simple vegetables and coarse fare necessarily refine the spirit and still the mind. Clothing and food are the most urgent of human affairs. Thus, the Dao’s precepts prioritize restraint: even foul odors and soiled garments are unsuitable for common custom, let alone for the practitioner, whose standards must be pure and strict. The essential principle is to reject extravagance and embrace frugality, for elegance and simplicity are the true path. One may wear a hempen crown or a deerskin cap, a skirt or a short jacket, a silk sash or felt boots—all are acceptable so long as the garments are clean and new. If traveling as a guest in distant lands, one may, in unavoidable circumstances, adopt secular attire, and even new clothing may suffice.

Within the spirit chamber, the practitioner’s place is beneath the eastern wall, where the ground is spread with felt, bedding, and mats—all suitable for use. The practitioner may eat twice daily, taking porridge, salt, rice, or fruit. Meals should be modest, never to the point of fullness, lest the body grow weak within; weakness allows the spirits to descend readily, while strength makes their summoning difficult. Prepare fifteen days’ worth of water and vegetables in advance, ensuring all is fully stocked. Avoid violating taboo days, keep distant from the profane, and prevent clamor or disturbance. The utmost priority is purity and emptiness, with stillness as the highest virtue.

**Purification for Offerings, Tenth Section**
Nothing precedes reverence in human affairs, and in cultivating reverence, nothing surpasses devotion to spirits and gods. A respectful demeanor can command others, while a reverent heart can move all things. In rites of prayer, the first step is the offering of grain; in rituals of summoning, preparation must begin with purification. When anticipating the gods’ arrival, reflect on their powers, envision their presence, and maintain a tranquil mind—free from distraction, with nothing else intervening.

The practitioner should enter the purification chamber three weeks (twenty-one days) before the *gengyin* day, bathing in fragrant water every seven days. Avoid defilement, wine, meat, pungent vegetables, anger, and all such impurities. Do not leave the chamber idly or engage in casual conversation; remain alone in the chamber, pure and diligent, focusing solely on the gods’ forms without negligence or sleep, lest arrogance arise. If one can maintain purification for a hundred days, the efficacy of the arts will manifest all the more swiftly.

From three weeks before *gengyin* until the day before *gengzi*, remain in the purification chamber, maintaining purity. On the *jihai* day, bathe in fragrant water, then enter the spirit chamber at the fourth watch of the night to arrange the sacrificial implements. Enter the spirit chamber before dawn on the *yin* hour and perform the rites according to the method.

From the *gengzi* day onward, when entering the spirit chamber to offer sacrifices, one must remain solemn and reverent, avoiding hasty movements, careless entry or exit, or disrespectful postures that might offend the gods’ majesty and disrupt the practitioner’s focus. A distracted mind lacks precision, and the arts will yield slow results. As when kindling fire, speed is essential—swiftness aligns with the moment, while delay leads to remoteness. This principle applies to all such matters.

Within the spirit chamber, after sunset, use sesame or animal-fat oil to fuel the lamp, keeping its brightness moderate, like an ordinary lamp. Place the lamp beneath the southern wall of the practitioner’s mat, with a wick as thin as a hairpin’s tip, and cover it with a silk shade to soften its glow, resembling twilight. Excessive brightness disturbs the spirits, while darkness obscures human sight. Adjust with discretion, balancing the oil’s quantity to ensure the lamp burns until dawn, never extinguishing midway to relight it, which would cause disorder, disrupt the practitioner’s focus, and offend the arriving spirits. Stillness of mind is the sole aim; the lamp’s oil should be ample rather than scant, its light dim rather than bright. Follow the scriptures precisely, without deviation.

**Arranging Seats and Offerings, Eleventh Section**
Spirits and gods, each with their own dominion, have their proper places. When setting out offerings, they must be arranged according to direction. Just as celestial regions have their divisions, so too must ritual propriety avoid disorder. The five colors and their elements differ—how could they be confused? Thus, in prayers and supplications, nothing surpasses sacrifice, and in invoking the gods’ blessings, nothing exceeds fine food. Yet without utmost sincerity, the gods will not descend; without fragrant offerings, the feast is in vain. The essence of sacrifice lies in a fervent heart and refined food.

On the *gengzi* day, the practitioner enters the spirit chamber and stands beneath the western side of the door. On the altar, spread white thatch as a mat and arrange the following: *Xingwen* and *Xingcheng*, the seats of these two gods, face east on the altar, aligned with the steps, spaced slightly over two *chi* apart—arrange the other seats accordingly. *Xingsong* and *Xingming* sit facing south; *Xinger* and *Xingxu* face west; *Xingjin* and *Xinggao* face north. Burn white incense and sprinkle it to purify the altar, using this incense for all sweeping and cleansing. This incense is used in all rites of summoning spirits and gods, as well as in prayers, for it is the fragrance they favor—other incenses are unsuitable. Commonly called "thatch," it grows abundantly in fields and wilds. The finest comes from the mountains of Jinyang, where even livestock avoid grazing on it.

For the seats of these eight gods, twist white thatch into mats, shaped like winnowing baskets, bound with thatch ropes. Do not use hemp or other materials for the mats, which should be one *chi* square. When harvesting the thatch, the finest has three ridges; if unavailable, ensure it is fresh and clean, never defiled or soiled, lest the gods reject it. These are the seats of the spirits and gods, so they must be arranged with particular care.

Place the thatch mats on the altar’s four sides, two mats per side, all within the altar’s bounds, never extending beyond it.

The two seats should be placed two *chi* apart, with each seat two *chi* from the corners. Prepare separate cloths of yellow silk, each one *chi* and eight *cun* square. Place one cloth before each god’s seat, all positioned to the east so the gods face east to receive the offerings. Once the cloths are set, arrange the food upon them.

Each cloth holds two cups, filled to the brim with wine—never allow them to be less than full. The wine must be pure and clear, unadulterated with dregs or water. It should be homemade whenever possible; only in necessity may it be sought elsewhere. On each cloth, place dried meat, specifically venison, which must be fresh and clean, never spoiled, lightly roasted until cooked. Two pieces, each one *cun* square, suffice for the offering. If venison is unavailable, beef, mutton, pheasant, or rabbit may be substituted.

Place four jujubes on each cloth. The finest come from Dongyang in Qingzhou—select those that are clean, unblemished, and free from dust or decay, whole and unspoiled. Only the best dried jujubes are worthy of offering. If Dongyang jujubes are unavailable, use those from the local region, or fresh jujubes from communal harvests in the seventh or eighth month.

Place four chestnuts on each cloth, preferably those from Gu’an in Youzhou, newly harvested and fragrant, never rotten. Roast them until cooked, remove their skins, and ensure they appear golden and lustrous, their aroma rich and full. If Gu’an chestnuts are unavailable, use those from the local area.

Place four cakes on each cloth, made of steamed white flour without lard, each one *cun* in diameter. The flour must be from the current year’s wheat, never stale. The cakes must be prepared in cleanliness, not made with impure vessels or by women.

On the altar’s four sides, place one seat per side, each to the east with its cloth and offerings. The number of dishes must follow the scripture precisely—neither add nor omit. The offerings must be fresh; do not reuse them in subsequent rites, lest it invite disrespect. The remnants may be consumed by the practitioner to hasten the gods’ arrival.

Inscribe the invocation on paulownia wood with ink, then kneel and read it aloud from the board, which should be one *chi* wide and one *chi* and two *cun* long. Perform this rite morning and evening, reciting the following:

*"I invoke the Southern Dipper, who traverses the world, dispelling all misfortune and befriending me. From east to west, no barrier shall hinder you. I offer you the finest food and drink. Grant me gold, silver, wealth, and secret knowledge—let me foresee good and ill, past and future. Fulfill my every desire without fail. Today, I present fine wine, fragrant jujubes, and sweet dried meat. May all be pleasing and aromatic; may you drink your fill until sated. Come swiftly to my side, never to depart. Let our bond be unbroken, our trust unwavering. Hasten as the law commands!"*

**Verification and Manifestation (Chapter Eleven)**
After this, signs will appear—either the gods will manifest in person or through extraordinary dreams. If the practitioner’s mind remains steadfast and undisturbed for fifteen days, the gods will fully reveal themselves. As the gods draw near, the practitioner may feel palpitations, fear, or trembling; their hair may stand on end, their body grow cold or feverish, their spirit restless and unsettled. These are the harbingers of the gods’ arrival, the sure signs of their manifestation.

Upon first seeing the gods, observe the rites of host and guest—no prostration is required. Initially, their forms may appear faint, flickering into clarity. Do not speak to them until their shapes are distinct. Instead, focus your thoughts and continue the offerings diligently. Soon, their forms will become vivid, their features unmistakable. When you wish to ask a question, the gods will answer, revealing their names. From then on, they will remain at your side, never departing.

Yet remember: though human and divine share a bond, their realms differ. The first encounter with the gods may evoke fear or awe. Stand firm, do not panic. After a brief exchange, your heart will settle, and they will become steadfast allies, offering hidden wisdom and boundless insight. Your perception will sharpen, your vision unobstructed.

Once the rite is complete, offer all remaining food and wine on the altar, holding an all-night vigil to honor the gods. Let the wine flow abundantly, the dishes scatter freely. Dance and rejoice without restraint, keeping vigil until dawn. Cherish these signs with reverence and joy, for they bring divine favor and boundless delight.

For the next seven days, sleep in the chamber of the gods, offering frequent sacrifices without growing complacent. Beyond this, you may move freely without hindrance. If official duties or unavoidable matters arise, inform the gods before leaving the fast. Even when outside, restrain yourself: maintain a gentle demeanor, move with grace, and avoid startling the gods. Their initial attachment is like taming a hawk or training a horse—constant mindfulness is required.

Even in worldly dealings, one must show respect; how much more so when commanding gods and spirits? Never treat them lightly. Upon first receiving the gods, the practitioner should avoid company for ten days or so. This is because, newly attuned to the divine, they may become enamored with the gods’ presence, delighting in their efficacy—every question answered, every doubt resolved. Such infatuation must be tempered, lest it lead astray. Return to the proper path.

These signs and warnings are given in advance so the practitioner may guard against them, ensuring all proceeds well. Do not neglect the rites or invite suspicion of heterodoxy, which the noble disdain.

When the divine arts prove efficacious, for a hundred days thereafter, the practitioner’s spirit may grow restless, unable to find peace. Some may crave wealth and industry, others fame through learning, still others official rank or seclusion from the world—such thoughts arise in endless variety. Should these signs appear, one must exercise restraint and not follow every whim the gods suggest. To yield to impulse invites misfortune. After a hundred days, clarity returns, and harmony between human and spirit ensures lasting auspiciousness, forever warding off demonic omens. Practitioners must foresee this and guard against it with utmost care.

**Chapter Twelve: The Minor Art of Hasty Attainment**
Once the gods are received, fearing the shallowness of human nature—its inability to restrain the mind and still the heart—some boast of their knowledge, recklessly revealing fortunes and misfortunes. Whether before emperors or within the web of worldly affairs, they divulge the secrets and proofs granted by the gods. Such recklessness invites execution by the sword. Since ancient times, such cases have been many. Even those who possess but a rough understanding of these arts should refrain from boasting of their friendship with gods and spirits. Thus, this chapter is established to allow for minor verification, just enough to transmit the art. Those who practice thus will avoid calamity, preserve both body and technique, and prosper.

The method of hasty attainment differs not at all from the greater art, save that no elixirs need be ingested. Simply complete the *Yubu* steps, place one pill beneath the topknot, two in the ears, two in the nostrils, and one each upon the teeth, lips, eyes, and navel. Within fourteen days, perform the rites as prescribed, and the gods will appear, granting full discernment of fortune and misfortune. Though their forms may be seen, their features will not be entirely distinct. If the elixir is genuine and received properly, follow the greater method, ingesting the medicine to seek them. Within fifteen days, the efficacy of this art will be decisively restored, and no endeavor will fail.

Yet beware of carelessness and indiscretion, of flaunting one’s skills or acting with reckless abandon. Those who seek the Dao for life may instead invite ruin. If one can comprehend worldly affairs, seal one’s lips, foresee danger, and keep it hidden, cultivating only one’s own well-being, they will forever avoid military disaster, escape untimely misfortune, attain immortality, and enjoy a lifespan as vast as heaven. Wealth, treasures, and goods will accumulate boundlessly; honor and high office will be within reach. Yet the Daoist must remain pure and empty, devoted to stillness. The wise embrace the distant, abandon the worldly, and purify the heart—how could they crave wealth or office, or speak of worldly gain? Thus, the essentials are briefly outlined, lest those who cannot cultivate them act without restraint, achieving all they desire. This is to guide beginners and reveal the root of the Dao’s meaning.

**Chapter Thirteen: Commanding and Subduing Spirits**
The Yellow Emperor said: Human nature can commune with gods and spirits, yet the principles governing gods and humans differ. Spirits can foretell fortune and misfortune, but the paths of humans and spirits diverge in essence. Only when sages exhaust their insight and probe the subtlest mysteries do they reveal hidden truths, guide the masses, expound arts, and command gods and spirits, thereby attaining benefit and achieving the immortal Dao.

For those who have already realized sagehood, the heart awakens of itself, needing no external aid. But for those below sagehood, down to the common folk—even the wise and intelligent, those who delve into mysteries and explore the obscure—such individuals may be suited to mundane affairs and the understanding of human relations. The realm of ordinary people has its limits; how can the fleshly eye perceive the profound texts transmitted by gods, or fathom the unfathomable? Thus, the sages bequeathed written teachings and the art of commanding spirits, enabling Dao-seekers to foresee the unborn, know events a thousand miles away, nurture life, avoid harm, and attain these benefits. This is the benevolence of the virtuous—how vast its advantage!

Yet the paths of humans and spirits—one hidden, one manifest—differ in kind, making mutual understanding difficult. Consider the bonds of father and son, ruler and minister: if a father and son grow estranged, ominous signs of rebellion arise; if ruler and minister grow suspicious, can annihilation be far? How much more so when a being of form and worldly ties seeks to command the formless, hidden spirits of the unseen? This endeavor is subtle and arduous, and mastery is no easy task. Thus, the essentials of commanding spirits are briefly set forth to enlighten future generations, that those who cherish the Dao may follow and benefit.

Once spirits are summoned and accompany a person, the bond is like that of siblings, the relationship akin to friendship. One must think of them always, maintain reverence, and never neglect them, lest the spirits’ hearts grow weary and their transmissions become false. Such falsehood breeds discontent in the human heart; the spirits perceive this discontent and grow angry. Once a rift forms, it widens, and the spirits will harm the person with weapons. Do not grow lazy or negligent, inviting disaster.

When summoning spirits, do not overindulge them or blindly follow their words. Excessive indulgence breeds arrogance in spirits; arrogance leads to contempt for humans. Human anger and spiritual discontent create a rift, and the spirits will harm the person. Do not deviate or err, lest misfortune follow.

While dwelling with spirits, do not commit unwholesome acts—whether killing, lewdness, deceit, theft, or falsely invoking the spirits’ words to extort goods. Such defilements are detested by spirits. If humans incur the spirits’ hatred, discontent arises; a rift forms, and the spirits will harm the person. But if one walks the path of loyalty and trust, blessings will extend, and all will be auspicious.

Those who commune with spirits may find their nature altered: some grow quick to anger, others become lustful or greedy for wealth. This stems from the differing natures of the spirits they encounter. One must carefully examine and clearly discern this, restraining oneself and not blindly trusting the spirits’ words. Lest human relations become disordered, conduct change, and misfortune be invited.

All spirits and deities, in their fundamental nature, desire to broadly proclaim fortune and misfortune, widely transmit all matters, and display their efficacy—flaunting their powers. Yet one must restrain and endure, refraining from reckless disclosure. What is known may only reside in the heart; it must not be spoken aloud. To speak is to summon armed retribution; to leak is to invite harm. This matter is like a shadow following form, an echo answering sound—only through stillness and caution can one avoid calamity.

When dwelling with spirits, their nature compels them to demand that humans propagate their efficacy, parade their divine manifestations, and reveal their powers. If one resists them, the spirits may turn to deplete and harass, causing one to drink excessively, grow wild and boastful, or become mentally disordered, restless, and unsettled. Only through steadfast endurance, without flaunting, can one swiftly return to tranquility. Yet among one’s closest kin or intimate friends—those of refined and trustworthy character—one may discreetly employ divination, recount dreams, observe qi and complexion, feign medical prescriptions, or rely on pulse diagnosis, using various pretexts to subtly convey the spirits’ messages. Such transmissions must be truthful, for the benefit of others. This serves two purposes: first, it delights the spirits’ hearts, bringing them joy; second, it refines the matter at hand, enhancing its efficacy, ensuring freedom from illness, avoiding the spirits’ displeasure, and delivering one from distress, rescuing from peril, broadly aiding all beings, and benefiting the world—this may be called next to sagehood. To act thus is to be a parent to humanity, a true person of boundless aid; what could surpass this? Such is the way to later gain profit and advantage, attainable only by those of wisdom, sagacity, and profound insight.

In the method of employing spirits, one must not compel them to divine trivial matters—this is called "using the spirits without reason." Nor should one inquire about matters beyond doubt or within human understanding—this is called "wearying the spirits." If the spirits grow displeased, they may bring misfortune and harm. Only with reverence and respect, seeking their counsel on fortune and misfortune, will all be auspicious.

The method of employing spirits demands utmost stillness and caution, sincerity, prudence, and compassion. First, one must master body and mind; only then may one master the spirits. Never slight the spirits, nor grow overly attached to them. One may only subtly employ pretexts to express the spirits’ sentiments. As stated above, these are the essential principles for engaging with spirits. How could one not know the details? A thousand admonitions, ten thousand cautions—only reverence for the spirits and sealing one’s lips to prevent leaks are paramount. Leakage invites immediate disaster, unquestionable slaughter. Be cautious, be ever cautious.

Thus the sages have said: prevention is better than regret. This teaching is no empty discourse.

**Admonitions on Guarding the Body to Preserve Life, Fourteenth**
The Yellow Emperor said: The highest method for a sage to preserve life lies in nothing above body and mind. What could bring greater benefit or harm to body and mind than good and evil? Good and evil arise from the root of the mind. The mind’s nature does not abide in clinging to conditions. That to which it clings is called the "realm"; that which clings is called the "mind." Thus, the arising of the ten thousand phenomena stems from nothing beyond the mind. What sprouts from the mind is called "karma"; the manifestation of karma is called "good and evil." Therefore, indulging desire is evil; ceasing greed is good. Goodness brings benefit to the world and liberation from the dust; evil becomes the resource for corrupting virtue and defiling purity. Thus, the sage knows the formless and employs the mind. The body does not move on its own—it is the mind. Yet the mind, without relying on the body, cannot display its full function; the body, without the mind’s support, perishes and does not arise. Thus, body and mind differ in substance but align in principle, converging in myriad good deeds toward one end. Therefore, they function in mutual support: movement and stillness sustain each other. The body does not act alone but is directed by the mind. If the mind’s nature is impure, it clings to conditions; the body’s capacity is boundless, endlessly absorbing actions. Thus, the mind is the root of the ordinary and the sage; the body is the gathering of suffering and joy.

The sage knows that suffering arises from the mind, and transgressions originate from oneself. Thus, purifying the mind removes suffering; cleansing the will eradicates transgressions. The common folk, however, do not act thus. They indulge their emotions and desires, unaware that desire springs from the mind; they act with arrogance and extravagance, unaware that arrogance arises from themselves. They recklessly pursue folly and violence, heedless of their bodies, thus inviting disaster. From this, they fail to recognize peril and doom, remaining ignorant in their daily conduct.

Thus, the sagely and enlightened, pitying the foolish, established teachings and the Dao, desiring that learners pacify their minds to still the source of affairs and restrain their bodies to curb the threads of greed. Therefore, they instituted rituals to cultivate customs and expounded the immortal Dao to transcend the worldly dust. These two teachings, when fully understood, bring salvation to the multitude. Yet those who have not attained the return to the formless, lacking foresight into the unseen, follow secret arts to summon and employ spirits, hoping to foresee survival and demise, to know in advance benefit and harm, enabling them to avoid danger and seek safety, thereby attaining the immortal Dao. Thus, those who delight in ease yearn for the Dao to preserve life; those who love stillness purify their spirits to cease affairs. Without profound understanding and inner realization, how could one command the myriad spirits and secure their long-term protection?

Herein lies a brief account of the essential admonitions on guarding the body.

Employing spirits is an exceedingly difficult matter, demanding stillness and caution. One must reduce social interactions and avoid excessive involvement with emperors, ministers, or high officials. Those who cannot restrain their knowledge and leak the spirits’ efficacy will invite chaos, and death will swiftly follow. This must be cautioned against, ever cautioned against.

Those who employ spirits must never, for their entire lives, speak to others of their practices or reveal their employment of spirits. Leakage brings death, swift and inevitable. Even between father and son, this must not be disclosed—how much less to the common folk. Seal your lips for life; never leak lightly. Leakage invites disaster, bringing self-inflicted slaughter.

These are the essential admonitions on guarding the body—be cautious, ever cautious.

Those who employ spirits, relying on their own abilities, may indulge in misconduct: some falsify divine words to extort goods through intimidation; some lie in wait for others’ misfortunes, peddling their services for profit; some engage in endless deceit, weaving a thousand schemes of fraud. Such transgressions are too numerous to record in full. As the saying goes, "One who usurps a chariot not his own will perish before the day is out." The enlightened spirits, knowing all, will surely impose the most severe punishment. Thus, one must heed these warnings—how can one not be cautious? How can one not be cautious?

**Fifteenth: Verified Cases of Past Masters**

Ji Kang, styled Shuye, was a grandee of the Jin dynasty. His contemporaries—men like Shan Tao and Xiang Xiu—were collectively known as the Seven Worthies. Yet Kang’s learning spanned the classics, and he delved deeply into the histories. He composed treatises on nourishing life, corrected the standard pronunciation of the classics, and excelled in literary composition, particularly poetry and *fu*. His learning was vast, his humility profound, and his insight far-reaching. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi on emptiness and tranquility, along with the esoteric secrets of the profound caverns, he mastered entirely, internalizing them in his heart and mind. He transcribed these texts tirelessly, and after three years of long whistling, he called forth the names of the Eight Spirits. The spirits manifested in form, serving and obeying him, foretelling events before they arose and effortlessly prolonging the lives of all things. The spirits also bestowed upon Kang the *guqin* piece *Guangling San*, whose fame endures to this day. Though Kang never performed the Yu Step nor ingested elixirs, merely transcribing the texts on the Yu Step and elixirs—cherishing and studying them—he still succeeded in summoning the spirits and commanding them in various tasks.

The monk Huizong, of unknown origin, was devoted to this method. After copying these texts but before fully receiving the transmission, he retreated to the summit of Mount Song for a summer retreat. Before the retreat’s end, he beheld all the spirits and could command them at will.

Likewise, Dong Zhongshu ordered a shaman to burn himself with fire; Guo Linzong possessed the ability to discern men’s fates; Fotucheng foretold the fall of Zhao; and Dao’an predicted the defeat of Qin. Their extraordinary powers all stemmed from this art. Without such reliance, how would they differ from ordinary folk?

Yet most worldly people who study this art are plagued by fear and confusion. The reason is this: ghosts are not beings ordinarily seen by men. Anticipating the sight of spirits, they dread disturbance and harm, and this apprehension makes belief difficult. Thus, even the wise who seek hidden truths may remain blind to understanding. Though they may gain a reputation for avoiding harm, they achieve no true escape from calamity. Their aspiration to preserve life remains unfulfilled, for they bar themselves from mastery, relying instead on self-protection.

Pitying their plight, I have here recorded the verified experiences of past masters, that those who seek the hidden and aspire to the Dao may devote themselves to this practice.

In the first year of Yongping of the Wei dynasty, three men—Liu Zhu, Gao Rongzu, and Yan Etou—studied the Dao in the western mountains of Youzhou for seven years. One day, a heavy snowfall of over a foot accumulated, and a transcendent appeared, declaring: "I am surnamed Huxian, styled Daoseng." He instructed Rongzu in preparation, Etou in spirit-employment, and Zhu in the summoning of the Eight Spirits. Zhu then had Zhu Tianzhu erect a curtained tent, for Tianzhu was the celestial pillar of Luoyang. Zhu was soon appointed Chief Minister, then Governor of Youzhou. He taught Yue Chongxin, who taught the Daoist Wang Xu of Yanmen; Xu taught Jingting of Yongtai Temple; Jingting taught his disciple, the monk Ru; Ru taught Liu Hui and Zu Ji. Ji, having received the oral transmission from Ru in full, now transmits it here. May this immortal art endure forever. Every time it is passed to those earnest in its pursuit, its efficacy is proven without fail. Thus, Zuo Yuanfang, Zheng Siyuan, Ge Hong, Gongming, Jingchun, and Bu Xu all attained it. Though I have seen its methods, I cannot record them all here.

The *Writ and Diagram for Summoning Transcendents and Employing Spirits*, the *Secret Incantations and Verified Scriptures*—on the days of bathing in the Eastern Well, spirits are summoned and employed, but without these texts, success is unattainable.

- **First month:** the tenth day, at the hour of *hai*;
- **Second month:** the eighth day, at the hour of *xu*;

**Third month:** the sixth day, at the hour of *you*;
**Fourth month:** the fourth day, at the hour of *shen*;
**Fifth month:** the first day, at the hour of *wei*;
**Sixth month:** the twenty-seventh day, at the hour of *wu*;
**Seventh month:** the twenty-seventh day, at the hour of *si*;
**Eighth month:** the twenty-second day, at the hour of *chen*;
**Ninth month:** the twentieth day, at the hour of *mao*;
**Tenth month:** the eighteenth day, at the hour of *yin*;
**Eleventh month:** the fifteenth day, at the hour of *chou*;
**Twelfth month:** the twelfth day, at the hour of *zi*.

Bathing and summoning on these days ensures divine efficacy without fail.

Guard this secret and do not transmit it lightly.
