**The Wondrous Scripture of the Three Nines and Jade Essence from the Supreme Cavern of Perfection**

**Scripture Title:** *The Wondrous Scripture of the Three Nines and Jade Essence from the Supreme Cavern of Perfection*
**Author:** Unknown, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Shangqing tradition.

**The Wondrous Oral Formula of the Three Nines and Jade Essence**

On the auspicious celestial stem day of the first year of the *shangyuan* era, at the hour of the northern quadrant, when the Three Origins aligned in radiance and the Nine Emperors returned to perfection, the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One and the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads ascended the Jade Pavilion of the Lofty Heights, the Purple Void Heaven. There, the *Three Nines Oral Formula* was revealed, unlocking the numinous barrier, and the *Jade Essence True Formula* was bestowed—governing destiny for eternal preservation. Its revelation illuminated the distant expanse, its clarity as pure as the rustling wind, its jade tones resounding through the void, its jasper melodies soaring beyond the heavens. Fragrant winds stirred without cease, and wisdom’s chant echoed into the farthest reaches. Its fragrance suffused the depths of the visage, its qi outstripped the divine gales. The Jade Tablet commanded all, and the myriad immortals came to pay homage. This was the wondrous transformation of primordial mystery, enduring through ten thousand kalpas without decay. The true formula was recorded to bequeath to the worthy, testing the sincerity of those who seek with diligence.

Should one’s golden name be *Eastern Radiance* and one’s verdant appellation *Purple Court*, upon receiving this wondrous scripture, one ascends to the Jade Clarity Heaven. The Three Passes unlock their mechanism, the Nine Portals receive the numinous, and the visage assumes a golden countenance. The Five Viscera flourish in splendor, the golden perfection is felt in harmony, and the boundless is illuminated with clarity. The divine candle shines in hidden radiance, the treasure-light is born in the night. Molten gold is cast in exchange, and the flaming bells blaze forth. With a whistle, the command is instantly fulfilled, and the divine soldiers are marshaled. The Three Origins journey to the chamber, descending in a jade-green chariot. Riding the void, soaring through emptiness, one ascends to the Supreme Clarity.

The Most Exalted Azure Lad said: The *Three Nines Oral Formula* originates from the incantations of the Nine Emperors and the Three Perfected, governing qi to prolong the years and unlocking the numinous barrier to freshen the Five Viscera.

You possess jade bones and have beheld this text. Receive it in secret, swear a luminous oath, and pledge your faith to the Nine Heavens. Cultivate this Dao in seclusion. Guard against reckless transmission; to reveal it to the unworthy is to invite calamity upon yourself—not merely the wind’s blade, but misfortune extending to the Seven Mysteries. Be vigilant in celestial law, seeking the true Dao. After nine years of unwavering practice, you shall attain the rank of Supreme Immortal.

The formula was transmitted simultaneously by the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One and the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads to the Supreme Thearch, the Celestial Thearch, and the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity. The Supreme Thearch transmitted it to the Lord of the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen; the Celestial Thearch transmitted it to the Queen Mother of the West; the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal. The Sacred Lord of the Golden Portal transmitted it to the Most Exalted Azure Lad, who in turn transmitted it to the Lord of the Western City, entrusting it to later disciples destined to become Perfected. The lineage of transmission, bound by true qi, traces back to the imperial scripture. By the time of the Lord of the Western City, over seven thousand kalpas had passed. Thereafter, the Lord of the Western City sealed the numinous text within the jade chamber of the western cavern of Mount Wangwu, where the officials of the Plain Spirit attended to its incense and guarded its scripture.

This Dao is profoundly wondrous and not disseminated in the world. Should one of mysterious destiny encounter this text, the myriad immortals shall come to pay homage, and celestial officials shall guard one’s person. Through diligent practice and arduous contemplation, one shall ascend at dawn.

For those who receive the wondrous chapters of the Three Treasures of the Supreme Clarity’s Dao and Virtue, practicing the Way of pacing the void to ascend the mystery, yet do not first release the Five Viscera and open the hidden barriers, their myriad qi will not be stabilized, and their true numen will not rejoice. Their diligent efforts shall be in vain, and they shall never attain immortality.

Now, this *Jade Formula*, the wondrous words of the Supreme Thearch, is transmitted to later disciples. Guard it in secrecy and revere the true. Beware of careless transmission, lest calamity befall you.

On the day of your life-destiny, bathe and enter the chamber. Face east, knock your teeth nine times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Nine Numinous Perfected of the Eastern Azure Thearch and Lesser Yang, whose taboo name is *Jushangsheng*.

Imagine the Nine Numinous Perfected riding the cloud-qi into your body, settling and stabilizing your liver. Then, call thrice upon the Nine Numinous Perfected of Lesser Yang, *Jushangsheng*, beseeching him to bestow the five essences of azure mushrooms to nourish your body. Then, taste thrice and swallow three times. Look upward and recite the incantation:

*"Vast and numinous Azure Origin, Master of Lesser Yang,
Nine qi return to the liver, pacifying the po soul.
The hidden palace knots in splendor, the viscera’s interior gleams bright.
Refine the countenance, strengthen the body, reverse white to azure.
The divine transformation arises within, the radiance ascends to the Purple Court.

**Method of Presenting Memorials on the Eight Nodal Days**

For those who cultivate the above method, recite the Dao ten thousand times, hoping to attain numinosity and realize the divine, seeking to become a divine immortal: on the days of the eight nodes, present a memorial to the numinous mountain of your natal destiny, submitting it to the Jade Clarity. After three years without fail, your name will be inscribed in the Azure Palace, your memorial tied to the Jade August One, with jade blossoms as attendants and golden dawn to receive you.

This is the true formula of Jade Clarity, the precious scripture of the Thearch-Lord. Whoever obtains this formula will ascend as an immortal in a calculated number of days. To recklessly divulge the divine text is to invite judgment upon the Nine Mysteries: the body will perish, the form will be destroyed, and one will be eternally sealed in the River Source. This depends solely on secret cultivation; the Dao does not speak falsely.

Those without jade names must not recklessly divulge it. To lightly reveal the divine scripture is to invite retribution upon seven generations of ancestors and calamity upon one’s descendants. The recipient must be cautious, keeping it secret and upholding its practice.

For the transmission of true instructions and essential plain-language teachings, in accordance with the luminous statutes, one must present a golden fish, a jade dragon, forty feet of blue silk, nine pairs of golden buttons, a hundred feet of life-destiny silk, and swear an oath of fidelity to the Nine Heavens. Proclaim the covenant before all heavens, perform purification rites in a secluded chamber, and only then may the transmission proceed. To break the oath or violate the trust incurs the same punishment from the ghostly officials upon both master and disciple. Each party must be meticulous in their conduct.
