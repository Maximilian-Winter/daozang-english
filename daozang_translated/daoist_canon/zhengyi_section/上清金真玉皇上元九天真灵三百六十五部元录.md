**The Supreme Clarity Golden Perfection Jade Sovereign’s Upper Prime Nine Heavens True Numinous Register of the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Departments**

Golden Radiance said: In the *guihai* year, on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, the Seven Perfected first received the *Upper Prime Numinous Register* from the Supreme Venerable Jade Dawn Lord. For nine years now, the Seven Perfected have treasured this register to gather spirit and qi, never once neglecting its divine writ.

Now, in the fifth year of the Great Clarity (*taiqing*), the year *xinwei*, on the first day of the fifth month at noon, the Most High Heavenly Treasure Jade Sovereign descended in truth within the Jeweled Palace of Belt Ridge, once more ranking and ordaining the *Upper Prime Nine Heavens True Numinous Mysterious Register* for the Seven Perfected, rectifying the titles and positions of its officials and generals.

Golden Radiance said: At that time, the Most High Heavenly Treasure Jade Sovereign spoke from his golden mouth, addressing the Seven Perfected: "This *Upper Prime Nine Heavens True Numinous Register of the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Departments of Generals and Heavenly Officials* was not composed by later scholars. These true beings are the Upper Prime’s soaring, congealed, pure, and numinous life-breath, responding naturally to the luminous course of destiny to become perfected persons. When they don their robes, they naturally wear five-colored flying celestial feathered garments; their forms are adamantine, their bodies over three thousand *zhang* in height. The officials and generals under their command all wear the naturally arising three-colored flying azure feathered immortal robes, ever guarding the Upper Prime of the Nine Heavens to assist the thirty-six True Sovereigns in their governance.

Thus, their method accords with the four images of Heaven and Earth and the three hundred sixty-five degrees of the Jade Pass and the Celestial Pivot. It also mirrors the governance of the Nine Dawns, the Three Luminaries, the Seven Luminants, and the stellar lodges, as well as the nine palaces, eight trigrams, and three hundred sixty-five degrees of the correct positions. It further accords with the inception of the three hundred sixty-five qi of Heaven, Earth, and the four seasons. At the center, it governs the revolutions of the human form, the three hundred sixty-five joints, and the viscera.

Above, it presides over the circulation of the correct qi of Heaven and Earth; in the middle, it sustains the mandate of the Heavenly Thearch and the imperial foundation, the enlightened prosperity of rulers, the illumination of the Three Primes and the imperial course, and the transformation of the worthy kalpa. Below, it rescues the three realms from the multitudes of beings, opens the gate of true Dharma in great radiance, ferries celestial and human beings across the Bridge of Blessings, delivers the eight difficulties from the Sea of Suffering, extricates the three paths from the six destinies, saves the degenerate world through the *Mysterious Register*, wards off heavenly disasters through the numinous officials, delivers the nine breaths through divine merit, protects the myriad bodies with heavenly soldiers, preserves blessings and prosperity through kalpas, dispels the ten evils in the heavenly halls, restrains poisonous ghosts with divine generals, subdues all demons with the heavenly perfected, repels all misfortunes with the numinous clerks, overpowers all spirits with heavenly might, slays all demons with divine power, extinguishes water and fire with numinous wisdom, dissolves foul qi with azure waters, sweeps away clamorous dust with the golden wind, preserves the myriad forms with wondrous qi, cures the hundred diseases with the heavenly physicians, and stabilizes the myriad joints with true essence.

Thus, its merits are all-encompassing, its reach boundless, its method a reflection of the measures of Heaven, Earth, and humanity. It constantly follows the luminous course to descend teachings and deliver beings in the kalpa of decline. It safeguards the realm of non-action for the future. Its Dharma shall flourish in the era of the numinous dragon. When rulers practice the Dao and cultivate virtue, it is their destiny. When the imperial reign is at peace, it is their merit. When the lives of celestial and human beings are not cut short, it is their blessing."

The Most High declared: "At this pinnacle, when the myriad Daoist arts have reached their end, the mysterious model arises, the Great Vehicle circulates, and the celestial years of the myriad beings are preserved, they shall attain equality with the Three Primes. Can this not be called the work of spontaneity, where deliverance is effortless?"

Now, therefore, this preface is composed to clarify its merits. May later worthies, perfected persons, and those who revere and uphold this teaching not fail to practice it accordingly.

From the day one receives this register, one must not violate the precepts or breach the covenant, nor engage in licentious sacrifices to the Six Heavens’ ghostly spirits or commit wanton killing. One may only worship one’s ancestors in accordance with the orthodox canon of the Great Perfected. Should one commit licentiousness, theft, or other transgressions, turning from the true to the false, the generals, soldiers, officers, and clerks shall record one’s offenses. One and one’s seven generations of ancestors shall be consigned to the Wind Blade for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve, in strict accordance with the true and luminous imperial decree."

The text of the register for male and female children.

Ritual for the Transmission of the Register and the Investiture of Officials and Soldiers

Next, ascend the altar, face east, and bow twice. Next, offer incense three times. Next, strike the ritual drum twenty-four times. Next, kindle the incense burner.

The Pure and Mysterious, Boundless and Supreme, the True and Lofty Three Heavens, the Primordial Qi of the Boundless Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the Left and Right Incense Officials, the Flying Immortals and Dragon-Messengers bearing incense, the Heavenly Flying Dragon-Riders and the Jade Lads and Maidens serving the Five Thearchs—twenty-four of each—emerge.

They reverently address the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural, as the Seven Perfected burn incense and present the memorial, entrusting the ritual of transmission and ordination. May the Primordial Qi of the Most High’s Ten Directions and True Perfected Ones descend into the bodies of the Seven Perfected, that their petition may ascend directly before the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao and the Most True Jade Emperor.

This done, they bow twice, then kneel reverently before the incense table. The officials emerge to receive the memorial and transmit the ordination.

With solemn care, the Golden Luminance Seven Perfected summon from within their bodies the True Officials and Merit Officers of the Five Agents—two of each—who emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Ascending Mystery—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Orthodox Unity—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Left Mystery and True Luminance—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Right Mystery and Supreme Perfection—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Yang Spirit and Orthodox Unity—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Yin Spirit and Orthodox Unity—two of each—emerge. The Merit Officers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ Divine Capital and Healing—two of each—emerge. The Supreme Upper Nine Heavens’ Flying Heavenly White Tiger Envoys bearing the memorial, the Dragon-Riding Immortal Couriers—two of each—emerge.

With solemn care, the Seven Perfected summon from within their bodies the True Official Envoys, the Divine Capital’s Direct True Talisman Officers, and the Envoys leading the Immortal Prefectures—one thousand two hundred of each—who emerge. Robes immaculate, sashes and pendants in order, each arrays the celestial and true feathered regalia, forming ranks on all four sides and eight directions, encamping and guarding left and right, front and back. Their radiance flashes like lightning, sweeping away all inauspicious influences. With dark clarity, they present and transmit the ritual of ordination.

Now, there are so many men and women of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet who, having renounced the mundane and turned toward the Mysterious and True, wholeheartedly take refuge in the Three Worthies. They seek to receive the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Registers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ True Numinosity. Today, their celestial titles and ranks are inscribed according to the statutes of the Mysterious Registers. If the register is to be presented, it shall be declared at the proper time; if the ordination is to be transmitted, it shall be declared at such-and-such an hour. Then, at that hour, the Three Primordials and Nine Heavens’ Officials are invoked to transmit the ordination.

Now, a second memorial is reverently presented to the Boundless Dao, the Primordial and Most High Jade Emperor, the Supreme and Most True Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, the Golden Portal Jade Thearch, and the Divine Capital’s True Officials, the Envoys who examine and summon deeds and records. May their true compassion descend, their dark scrutiny overseeing the ordination of these registers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ True Numinosity. May they all, according to their ranks, be transmitted into the bodies of these ordinands, settling in their palaces and guarding their bureaus, encamping and protecting them on all sides. Turning left, nine thousand myriad layers; turning right, nine thousand myriad layers. Guard their bodies, protect their lives, their brilliance shining forth, their majestic influence extending ten thousand miles.

Generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals shall take the same form as these ordinands, their spirits penetrating within and without. The true officials of the lands they tread shall infuse them with qi, overseeing and examining them. All the officials and soldiers shall assist and support them. According to merit, they shall be promoted and rewarded, their loyalty and trust never betrayed. Thus is this memorial presented before the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao and the Most True Jade Emperor.

This done, they bow twice and then present the memorial. When the memorial is concluded, they again invoke and proclaim its merit.

The Golden Luminance Seven Perfected again invoke from within their bodies the multitude of true Merit Officers, celestial officials, marshals, soldiers, chief envoys, and the Flying Heavenly White Tiger Envoys bearing the memorial, the Dragon-Riding Immortal Couriers. The Seven Perfected address the emergent officials, presenting the memorial and petition. The dark hosts of their subordinate true ones return, ascending the void in their chariots, resuming their palaces and bureaus, settling into their proper positions, encamping in heaven and assisting on earth.

They return, preparing the hundred thousand myriad layers of heavenly palaces within the Seven Perfected’s bodies. The true and orthodox each reenter through the vermilion gates and wondrous portals, resuming their ranks. Thus is the petition of the Seven Perfected presented before the Dao.

This done, they bow twice, return to the table, and kneel facing north. The officials emerge once more to transmit the registers of ordination and governance.

The Golden Luminance Seven Perfected again activate from within their bodies the Five True Gentlemen-Officials, the Left and Right Merit-Officers, the Immortal Lords and Dukes, the Direct True Talisman Officers, the Divine Capital’s Jade Gentlemen, the Orthodox Unity and Ascending Mystery Merit Officers, the Chief Envoys who examine and summon, the Envoys who inspect the Immortal Kings, the Flying Heavenly Riders, the Direct True Flying Dragon-Riders, and the Soaring Dragon Couriers—thirty-six of each—who emerge. Robes immaculate, they array the celestial regalia, covering heaven and filling earth, assuming positions left and right. According to the ritual, they oversee, inspect, and transmit the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Registers of the Upper Nine Heavens’ True Numinosity—generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and marshals—into the bodies of these ordinands. They settle and guard the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Passes and Palaces of their joints and bureaus, encamping with a hundred thousand myriad layers, ensuring no errors.

They prepare and encamp these ordinands, uniting them with the multitude of true ones. Thus is the petition of the Seven Perfected presented directly before the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao and the Most True Jade Emperor.

This done, the registers of ordination are read aloud, transmitted by the heavenly palaces. When this is complete, the registers are invoked, then the talismanic texts are invoked, with the prayer:

The Dao opens the true, the Orthodox Dharma stands majestic.
The power of the Great Nonbeing stirs a mighty wind,
From the nonbeing, light arises.
The divine merit of the Great Nonbeing transforms the ten directions.
The True Talismans of the Great Mystery summon the Spirit Kings.
Supreme control and command shatter the myriad calamities,
The Nine Heavens uphold life, the Six Heavens dare not oppose.
All heavens protect and encamp, guarding through endless kalpas.

Hasten! As the Statutes and Ordinances of the Jade Emperor command.

Next, the water texts of the ordination registers are invoked, with the prayer:

The Most High’s azure waters surge from the Celestial River,
Transforming into divine qi like a heavenly net.
Flying and scattering like swords, they slay heavenly demons.
The ghostly soldiers of the five directions—
All who encounter them are dissolved,
Like wind, like fire, extinguishing spirits and sweeping away demons.

Hasten! As the Statutes and Ordinances command.

This done, the ordination registers are transmitted, and the merit is proclaimed. Next, incense is offered three times. They return to the table, face east, and kneel to proclaim the merit.

The Seven Perfected of Golden Clarity,
supplicate the Boundless Dao’s Beginningless, Most High, Perfectly True and Greatly Sagely Heavenly Worthy.

To the Five Perfected Gentlemen and Clerks within the bodies of the Seven Perfected,
the Left and Right Merit-Balancing Immortal Lords and Immortal Dukes,

the Flying Heavenly Mounted Riders,
the Direct Perfected Flying Dragon Riders,
the Soaring Dragon Courier Manifesting Flying Immortals and Feathered Riders—

all are charged to oversee and transmit the ordination of [Name] in this ritual affair.
By the mysterious invocation, merit is proclaimed and promotion petitioned.
Each shall be elevated to lofty celestial ranks, myriad-fold,
as recorded in the Golden Tablets, their merit recompensed and promotion granted.

When the affair is complete,
each shall return to their numinous soaring chariots,
restoring to the Mysterious Palace, the Golden Hall, and Jade Treasury,
perpetually guarding the Three Primes,
all resuming their former stations,
awaiting future summons before reappearing.

The Upper Prime’s Nine Heavens’ True Spirits,
the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Departments of Mysterious Registers,
the generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and talisman clerks
entrusted by the Seven Perfected to [Name]—
from this moment onward,
shall constantly guard and protect [Name],
enduring through endless kalpas.

The Seven Perfected memorialize,
their words ascending to the Boundless Dao’s Perfectly True Jade Emperor’s presence.

This done, they bow twice more before the incense burner, concluding the rite, then return to the burner.

The Left and Right Incense Officials,
the Flying Immortal Courier Dragon Riders,
the Incense-Bearing Envoys,
the Flying Heavenly Dragon Riders—
all cause the numinous altar to generate spontaneous golden radiance and precious luminance,
mysteriously reflecting the essence of jade brilliance and golden liquid,
so that [Name] receives the blessings of the Dao, at ease and secure,
the world beneath heaven receives grace,
and the jade lads and jade maidens of the ten directions attend in guard.
The fragrant smoke ascends directly to the Seven Perfected’s memorial
before the Boundless Dao’s Perfectly True Jade Emperor.

The Celestial Worthy of Primordial Qi of the Orthodox Unity of the Boundless Dao,
the Ever-Bright Golden Perfected Jade Emperor’s Court,
the Left: Nine Myriad Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Layers of Flowing Luminous Jade Heavenly Perfected of the Pure True Primordial Qi,
the Right: Eight Myriad Eight Thousand Eight Hundred Eighty-Eight Layers of Golden Mysterious Radiant Treasure Light Perfected of the Accumulated Yang Primordial Qi,
the Center: Hundreds of Thousands of Myriad Layers of Jade Mysterious Golden Primordial Perfected of the Wondrously Pure and Boundless Primordial Qi of Living Spirits—
all together lead the Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Myriad Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Ninety-Nine Layers of Qi of the Upper Realm’s Pure Void and Spontaneously Generated Spirit,
lead the Thirty-Six Grotto-Heavens’ Most True Void Mysterious Elders,
lead the Highest Jade Emperor’s Thirty-Six Perfected Sovereigns’ Orthodox Governance and the Ten Directions’ Boundless Jade Judicial Kings,
the Golden Luminous Seven Perfected, bowing twice, reverently salute the Highest Perfected’s True Might and Orthodox Qi.

Respectfully following the ancient statutes, there are now male and female disciples who, having first received the grace of their masters’ initiation, were appointed to celestial offices. They have advanced to partake in the wondrous methods of the Three Caverns’ Supreme Dao, undeservingly bearing the boundless grace of the Great Dao’s vast beneficence. Yet, having been born and raised in the turbid world, their lives are subject to the Three Calamities. They have committed transgressions and accumulated evil, their habits ingrained by nature. Their bodies and minds have been careless, violating prohibitions and sacred pledges. Their sins have piled high as mountains, their faults deep as the abyss. They have incurred the greatest of offenses and transgressions.

Having heard that the Great Dao’s compassionate truth universally nurtures all, its grace pervading the ten directions, its embrace vast as the sea, its mercy moistening the Three Realms and Six Paths, with nothing left unprovided—yet they, greedy for advancement and forgetful of retreat, have no means to save themselves. Thus, they humbly submit their petitions to the Mysterious Perfected, taking refuge in the Three Worthies, beseeching to receive the Upper Prime’s Nine Heavens’ True Numinous Three Hundred Sixty-Five Departments’ Mysterious Registers, the generals, soldiers, celestial officials, and divine officers, to forever ferry them across the ford of the Long River. After receiving the register, they shall follow the statutes and uphold the precepts, daring not to transgress.

The Seven Perfected, seeing their ceaseless prostrations, shall then appoint them to celestial offices. Respectfully recording their prefectures, counties, villages, names, and ages, this day they submit their memorials and petitions, reporting their celestial office titles as stated above.

We humbly pray that the Boundless Dao’s Supreme Golden Portal Jade Emperor, Most True and Great Sage, may move the Three Heavens’ Immortal Capitals to appoint the Jade Gentlemen of the Immortal Offices, the Nine Heavens’ True Kings’ Supervisors of Registers and Life-Spans, to summon the celestial officials, distinguish their proper ranks, and on this day of this month, ordain and appoint them according to the law.

They guard and protect so-and-so’s left and right, front and rear, their flowing luminosity flashing like lightning, filling heaven and earth, sweeping away inauspiciousness. The divine radiance illumines brightly the dwelling of so-and-so, where the Mysterious Mirror observes all that is reported.

Now, so-and-so, a common person of such-and-such prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, respectfully states the following in accordance with the matter at hand:

Respectfully, so-and-so petitions the Heavenly Officials, submitting one written memorial, beseeching relief from so-and-so’s thousand transgressions and myriad faults—or regarding such-and-such matter. May grievances be reconciled, disasters dispersed, calamities averted, and misfortunes eradicated, all resolved without hindrance. May the afflictions and adversities besetting so-and-so’s household be wholly pardoned and remitted, illnesses cured, and a hundred blessings adorned. May all endeavors be propitious and upright, attaining supreme auspiciousness. May the Compassionate True Ones descend to shelter so-and-so’s household, that all within may receive grace.

So-and-so now reports above to the Boundless Dao’s Primordial Most High Jade Thearch, the Supreme and Most Upright Great Sage Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Emperor of the Golden Watchtower; the Nine Elders of the Immortals’ Capital and the Nine Qi Master; the Upper Numinous Immortals’ Capital’s True Officials; the Merit Officers of the Examination and Summoning Bureau; the Highest Dharma Kings and Supreme Eight Primordial Heavenly Masters.

May the gods of heaven and earth mutually guard and protect. Should any of the Six Heavens’ subordinate officials, corrupt qi, or unrighteous spirits obstruct the Dao and intercept the memorial, preventing its ascent, the Heavenly Officials’ soldiers shall, in accordance with the Three Heavens’ Mysterious Capital’s Orthodox Statutes, seize and deliver them to the Heavenly One’s Northern Great Yin Prison. The memorial shall ascend directly to the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao’s Most True Jade Thearch.

Upon completion, bow twice, then present the memorial. When the memorial concludes, solemnly recite the merit-conferring invocation.

Next, recite the merit-conferring invocation:

The first *jia* stirs the host of perfected beings within the body—Merit Officers, Celestial Officials, Generals, Scribes, Soldiers, Capital Envoys, Flying Celestial White Tigers, Memorial-Conveying Immortal Dragon Riders, and all the Heavenly Officials who emerged at the first *jia*—on behalf of so-and-so, for such-and-such matter, have transmitted this memorial and revealed its memorial tablet to completion.

May so-and-so’s household, by virtue of this merit, open the path to deliver the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors, extricating them from the Five Paths, absolving the Ten Sufferings, Eight Calamities, and Three Wretched Realms of their karmic transgressions. May the living and the dead alike receive salvation and ascension, ascending to heaven to receive blessings, their robes and provisions naturally flowing from the Southern Palace.

May all illnesses afflicting so-and-so’s household, great and small, be cured, or [address] such-and-such matter. May dreams and illusions be dispelled, and truth be firmly established.

May all malevolent spirits, demonic entities, and spectral apparitions—whether the baleful *qi* of the Five Directions, pestilential toxins, cloud-chasing hunters, *wangliang* specters, or any roving bands of inauspicious ghosts—be utterly extinguished from this day forth. May ten thousand misfortunes never arise, and may a hundred blessings adorn and perfect, ensuring eternal supreme fortune.

May all that the first *jia* transforms be transformed, all it governs be healed, and all it subdues be subdued, all jointly guarded and protected.

May the host of perfected Celestial Officials under the first *jia*’s command return, soaring through the void, to their palaces of golden citadels and jade precincts, resuming their stations to pacify heaven and assist earth. May the twelve thousand layers of Celestial Officials and Orthodox Perfected Ones within the first *jia*’s body, each departing from the vermilion gates of wondrous palaces, return to their posts.

The first *jia* has presented this memorial before the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao’s Most True Jade Thearch.

Upon completion, bow twice. Next, tend to the incense burner.

The Left and Right Fragrant Officers, Flying Immortal Courier Dragon Riders, Incense-Bearing Envoys, and Flying Celestial Dragon Riders shall ensure that above the sacred altar and within the tranquil chamber, gold radiance and precious luminosity naturally arise, intermingling with jade’s resplendence and the essence of golden liquid.

May so-and-so’s household enjoy blessings and ease, the world receive grace, and the jade lads and jade maidens of the Ten Directions attend the fragrant smoke, conveying the first *jia*’s memorial directly to the Imperial Presence of the Boundless Dao’s Most True Jade Thearch.

Upon completion, depart.

The *Jinming* states: The Seven Perfected received the Supreme Mysterious Register, and from the Golden Mouth’s decrees, this ritual was established as a ready-made liturgical model. Together with the transmission protocols and ordinances, they form this single scroll.

The Mysterious Register’s movement perpetually aligns with the Seven Perfected’s natural course, aiding the Thirty-Six Perfected August Ones in their orthodox governance, presiding over the Worthy Kalpa, as it is now.

If the celestial beings of the Ten Directions remain unaware of the myriad Dao’s culmination, let them observe the abolition of false ordinances—then the Three Caverns shall shine forth, the true scriptures shall illuminate with clarity, resplendent and pure, their brilliance as radiant as the sun’s light, like a dharma-mirror.

The Orthodox Dao is in motion; the Dharma Vehicle is at work. Thus, the Cavern Scriptures flourish, the Dharma teachings thrive, and the ten thousand demons are subdued.

At that time, heaven shall no longer accept sacrifices, spirits shall no longer receive offerings, ghosts shall no longer partake of food, malevolent entities shall hide, licentious harm shall vanish, the Six Heavens shall be rectified, and heterodox paths shall submit.

At that time, it shall truly be a cause for celebration—how could the celestial beings of the Ten Directions not rejoice?

Now, this later section is roughly outlined to serve as proof. Transmit this to future worthies, and do not divide this scroll by extracting portions to form separate volumes.

Those who violate this shall incur punishment by the Wind Blade—beware!

If transmission is desired, simply follow this text, and it shall not deviate from the lineage. Take heed and guard against transgression.

The True Decree of the Jade Thearch must not be defied; the Seven Perfected’s scriptural embodiment truly dares not betray the sagely teachings.

The Supreme Perfected of the Great Mystery, the Orthodox Mystery, the Primordial Mystery, and the Boundless Mystery; the True Illuminator Celestial Lord; the Supreme Celestial Lord; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Lord of the Myriad Layers of True Mystery and Primordial *Qi*; the Most High Lord Lao; the Most High Elder; the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital; and the Lords of the Hundred Thousand Layers of Dao *Qi* and Perfected Celestials—before the True Heavenly Court.

Sixty-one characters.

The Supreme Perfected of the Great Clarity, the Primordial Mystery, and the Boundless Mystery; the True Illuminator and Great Assembly Celestial Worthies; the Supreme Golden Clarity Celestial Worthy; the Supreme Lord of the Myriad Layers of Immortal Mystery and Primordial *Qi* of the Boundless Great Dao; the Lord of the Three Origins and the Hundred Thousand Layers of Dao *Qi*; and the Nine Elders, True Immortals, and Elders beneath the Golden Clarity Gate.

Sixty-one characters.

These two passages are not to be removed from this scroll. As their reading remains incomplete, they are provisionally placed here.

The Great Register is employed afterward, the Lesser Register is employed beforehand.

Here concludes the *Primordial Registers of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Divisions of the True Numinous Ones of the Nine Heavens of the Upper Origin*—the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Golden Perfection of Highest Clarity.
