**The Supreme Pervading Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters**
Also known as *The Jade Clarity Green Script of the Nine Heavens’ Hidden Writings*

The Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters and the Green Script of Hidden Writings comprise one hundred and twenty characters, formed from the *qi* of the Nine Heavens above, congealed from the essence of purple radiance, naturally coalescing into these chapters, manifest within the Jade Clarity Palace. Their script shines resplendent, illuminating the Supreme Clarity, prompting the Most High to inscribe them, thereby revealing their hidden sounds to uphold the Jade Void, command the Nine Heavens, perpetually wield divine authority, summon perfected beings, and inspect the numinous. These were originally borne by the Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning, transmitted to the Jade Clarity Emperor Lord, the Great King of Demon-Quelling, the Jade Clarity Divine Numinous King, and others. Twenty-four Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attend the text, correcting negligence and safeguarding those who bear its script upon their bodies.

Those who bear this text shall have their names inscribed upon the Vermilion Terrace alongside the Perfected of the Nine Heavens, their rank equated to the Lofty Mysterious, their bodies emanating purple light, their necks bearing circular luminosity. They shall roam the Great Void, where the ten realms shall receive them in attendance, and the Three Primes shall descend to feast together in the celestial chariots. In cultivating the Dao of divine transcendents, reciting the *Supreme Jade Clarity Hidden Writings of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, one must sit upon a square *zhang* of space, the heart aligned with the Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters, the left hand grasping the Flowing Gold Fire Bell, the right wielding the Expansive Seven Primes. Then shall the Jade Void descend unbidden, the Great Cavern’s gates open without summoning, the myriad Perfected respond in accord with the moment, and the hordes of demons bind themselves to annihilation. Commanding the eight *qi*, revolving the five celestial bodies, seating the ten thousand spirits, and dispatching the host of immortals, one’s *qi* merges with the Lofty Void, and one’s form ascends to the Purple Guest.

The secret mysteries of the Nine Heavens and the hidden writings of Jade Clarity—should one divulge these chapters, the body shall be scourged by the Wind Blade, and accountability shall extend to the sevenfold trials of life and death, as per the Nine Heavens’ Covenant Text.

Inscribed with golden names and jade characters, arrayed in diagrams across the Nine Heavens, those who behold this text must prepare a three-*chi* length of crimson silk as the ground, inscribe the Vermilion Chapters upon it with purple ink, and present ninety *chi* of purple text, along with jade dragons and golden fish, to the master. After ninety days of purification rites, facing north, one shall swear the Nine Heavens’ covenant before transmission. Disciples shall receive it encased in a brocade pouch, worn over the heart.

Those who bear the Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters shall have their rank equated to the Lofty Mysterious; those who receive the *Jade Clarity Hidden Writings* shall have their rank equated to the Supreme Perfected. In sitting, rising, resting, or sleeping, they shall ever intertwine with the Jade Void, the Jade Flower guarding the Perfected at their left and right, the Five Thearchs manifesting in semblance at their resting chamber. They must not intermingle with the common and profane, nor defile the Lofty Perfected. To transgress is to invite the departure of the divine and the approach of demons, to face trial and lose transcendence.

When bearing the Purple Text of the Vermilion Chapters—whether entering, exiting, resting, or practicing the Dao—one must first visualize one’s body enveloped in purple radiance, the Mysterious covering above, *qi* encircling the self. Then, knock the teeth nine times and softly invoke:

*"Ninefold Jade Void,
Eightfold Purple Radiance,
Mysterious Light descending,
Jade Clarity exuding essence,
Purple Text of Vermilion Script,
Manifesting the Nine Heavens,
Commanding the myriad spirits,
Summoning and dispatching the host of immortals,
Wielding awe over the ten thousand times ten thousand,
Inspecting and shearing the thousand times thousand,
Scenic echoes instantly converge,
Five clouds emit smoke,
Flying chariots and purple canopies
Swiftly arrive before me,
Enabling me to ride the void,
Ascend to the Jade Dawn."*

Upon completion, draw in and swallow the purple *qi* twelve times. After nine years of such practice, a canopy of purple clouds shall overshadow one’s body, which shall emanate purple light, illuminating the ten directions. One shall commune with spirits, attain the Perfected, and perceive the Great Void.

Formerly, the Lady of the Upper Prime transmitted the Hidden Writings to the Jade Maiden of Grand Harmony, who in turn bestowed them upon the Lord of Young Yang. Having attained the Dao and ascended to the void, he sealed the text within the cavern chambers of the Nine Doubts, where it shall be transmitted after seven hundred years to one who harmonizes the Perfected and penetrates the Mysterious. Those who later study with earnest devotion shall naturally resonate with predestined affinity.
