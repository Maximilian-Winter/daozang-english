**Lord Deng Tianjun’s Inner Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates**
The Celestial Lord (天君) personally inscribed these Essentials of the Mysterious Eight Gates and the Secret Formula of the Sixty *Jiazi* (甲子) on the Palm.

Its essence is the formula for the Nine Palaces (九宫) and the Eight Gates (八门) to determine daily retributions (直日報應). The method of judgment differs from the *Eight Gates Drum Song* (打門槌歌) of the Divine Old Master Xu (徐神翁) and the *Ghost’s Knocks at the Gate* (鬼敲門) method; it is not based on candle divination (占灯) or ritual readings (占课).

Those who obtain this formula should not cling rigidly to its sequence but recite and memorize it well. Its auspicious or inauspicious meanings will be revealed by the Dao’s divine guidance (神告), infallible in every trial.

**First, refine the Two Attendants (二使) within the Dipper (斗).**
Then, draw the true forms of the Two Attendants and venerate them at dawn and dusk (晨夕寅奉).

**The Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**
Exhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.
**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**
The Two Attendants bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池).

**Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth (金木水火土):**
Know their comings and goings, their births and deaths (去來知生死).
**Seize the Four Celestial Gates (四天門),**
No need to verify their efficacy (不問驗不驗).
**The Dipper’s Inner Vision (斗中内景):**
Silently recite the *Long Life Formula* (長生).

**The Secret Formula for Judging Auspiciousness in Poetry**
*"For mortals with ailments, examine their roots (勘其因),*
Silently recite the Eight Gates and Four Principles (四理) to reveal their truth (真).
*This oral transmission of the Long Life Formula (長生诀) requires no external means to seek its truth (不须物外更求真)."*

**The Auspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陽日八門默點直日報應詩)**
*"If the Gate of Auspiciousness (休門) is encountered, dig the soil (掘土) promptly,*
*Then early determine the causes of joy and sorrow (悲喜定元因).*
*Even Bian Que (扁鹊) himself may judge it as death,*
*But Master Xu’s words alone reveal its true essence (親授真)."*

**The Inauspicious Eight Gates Formula for Direct Daily Retribution (陰日八門默點直日報應詩)**
*"If the Gate of Alarm (驚門) appears, first cross the inquiry (過詢),*
*Danger looms for three days—its cause is fixed (定元因).*
*Beyond this, if the Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) is passed, Master Xu will safeguard (徐公保),*
*Yet neither Lu Yi (卢医) nor Bian Que (扁鹊) can cross its true boundary (不度真)."*

**The *Jiazi* (甲子) Formula for Auspiciousness (跏趺口诀)**
*"Sit in the morning, stand in the evening, and sit again at midnight (子).*
**Double-Flying Seven-Star Constraints (双飞七星罡):**
Exhale (吹) and inhale (呵) the *Kan* (坎) and *Li* (離) energies in union.
**The Infant and Maiden Formation (婴儿姹女结):**
The Seven Stars (七星) bathe in the *Hua Pool* (華池) for seventy-seven days.

*Open the gates in the seventh and eighth months (七月、八月).*
*Auspiciousness governs the ninth and tenth months (休九月、十月).*
*Life thrives in the eleventh month (生十一月).*
*Alarm dominates the fifth and sixth months (驚五月、六月居中).*
*Decay belongs to the twelfth month (傷十二月).*
*Death is fixed in the third month’s *Chen* (辰) and fourth month’s *Si* (巳) (死三月辰、四月巳).*
*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s *Mao* (卯).*
*Du (杜) governs the first month’s *Yin* (寅)."*

**The Right Eight Gates Formula for Determining Auspiciousness by Month (逐月所值以取吉凶例)**
*"The monthly correspondences are taken thus for auspicious or inauspicious signs:*
*In the first month, reverse the Du (杜) gate to ascend (上行).*
*The Gate of Auspiciousness (景門) passes through the second month’s decan (旬).*
*Chen (辰) and Si (巳) cross the fourth month’s node (節).*
*The Gate of Alarm (驚門) passes through the sixth month’s midpoint (中).*
*The Gate of Opening (開門) determines joy in the seventh month (七月喜),*
*Memorize firmly: Auspiciousness ascends in the ninth month (九十牢記休上行).*
*The Gate of Life (生門) again brings joy when the *Zi* (子) month appears (子月現).*
*The Gate of Decay (傷門) determines the master’s fate in the passing year (過残年)."*

**The Ritual Process**
The master enters a state of tranquility (靖), reciting the *Pure Mouth Incantation* (念净口咒), the *Pure Heart Incantation* (净心咒), the *Pure Body Incantation* (净身咒), and the *Pure Heaven and Earth Incantation* (净天地咒). After refining impurities (炼秽), the *qi* is retained within (存内), the *Yan Sheng Scripture* (延生经) is recited in transformation (变诵), and the master sits in *Dali* (跏趺) posture, striking teeth twenty-four times (叩齿二十四通), and harmonizing breath (交气).

*"Greed for vast wealth (贪巨禄) and corruption in virtue (文廉武破) [are judged],*
*[Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank] [Blank]."*

**The Dipper (斗) Ritual**
Each participant (讳各交) recites seven times (七遍), swallowing saliva nine times (咽液九过), retaining the *qi* within oneself as the True Person of one’s natal command (本命真人状).

**The Master’s Silent Incantation (師默诵咒曰):**
*"The Left Azure Dragon (左青龙), Master Meng (孟章), swiftly emerges from my left,*
*Exhale the liver *qi* (嘘肝气) once into the left side.*
*The Right White Tiger (右白虎), Marshal Jing (监兵), swiftly emerges from my right,*
*Inhale the lung *qi* (咽肺气) once into the right side.*
*The Front Vermilion Bird (前朱雀), Spirit Guang (灵光), swiftly emerges before me,*
*Exhale the heart *qi* (呵心气) before me.*
*The Rear Dark Tortoise (后玄武), Bearer of Brilliance (执明), swiftly emerges behind me,*
*Inhale the kidney *qi* (吹肾气) behind me.*
*Imagine the Four Beasts (四兽) guarding the exhalation-inhalation method (护呵法),*
*Retain the *qi* within the body, blowing it into both eyes (身吹存两目),*
*Then manifest the light of sun and moon (日月之光),*
*Called the *Division of Sun and Moon Light* (日月分光).*
*Next, store the *qi* in the left and right nostrils, inhaling it into the heart,*
*Forming the True Person (真人) within the Vermilion Palace (绛宫)."*

**Then recite the Heart Incantation (却念心咒):**
*"Heart’s divine spirit (心中神),*
*Lord Dan Yuan (丹元君),*
*Named Huang Ting (黄庭),*
*Called Hua Yin (字华婴),*
*Two inches in length (长二寸),*
*Three *fen* in breadth (广三分),*
*Wearing crimson robes (着朱衣),*
*With vermilion sash (系绛裙),*
*Wielding awe-inspiring virtue (秉威德),*
*Manifesting sacred brilliance (显圣灵),*
*Penetrating creation (通造化),*
*Reaching ultimate truth (达至真),*
*Dwelling in the heart (住心中),*
*Never leaving the body (莫离身),*
*In all affairs, swiftly reporting to mortals (凡有事，速报人).*
*Urgent, as the precepts decree (急急如律令)."*

**The Heart’s Path in the Dipper (心步斗),**
*Entering to serve the Cloud Chariot Talisman (入内服云车符),*
*Oral transmission and heart transmission (口授心传) alone suffice (方能尽矣).*

**"The Thousand-Gold Secret—Oath and Transmission"**

*Never reveal this treasure—*
*Memorize the sworn vow.*
*When the Cloud Chariot suddenly arrives,*
*Store the reverent Fire Officials and attendants—*
*The qi of the five viscera condensed within.*
*Next, ascend the Cloud Chariot,*
*With the beloved attendants and certain generals following,*
*The Four Rectifiers riding in procession,*
*Passing through the Yellow Path’s climatic zones.*
*Rise as if scaling the void,*
*Drawing upon the *wāifēng* qi—*
*The membrane.*
*If the wind turns grim and uncrossable,*
*Suddenly the reverent Fire appears—*
*The *dǎnshén* (bodiless spirit).*
*Fan aside the *wāifēng*,*
*The Yellow Path now clear.*
*Suddenly, the Rainbow Bridge approaches—*
*The generals emerge from the Cloud Chariot,*
*With the reverent Fire and Four Rectifiers,*
*Crossing into the Hall of Audience.*
*The Four Rectifiers present Yang Yan and Geng Bi,*
*Who lead me into the *Xuánjī* Bureau,*
*To pay homage and report.*
*Afterward, with the Four Rectifiers and the *dǎnshén*,*
*We exit the Hall,*
*Observing any omens returned.*
*If no response comes to the petitions,*
*Retire into the *Jìng* Chamber,*
*Wait for verification,*
*Then return with the beloved attendants, the *dǎnshén*,*
*And the Four Rectifiers,*
*Descend the Bridge, board the Cloud Chariot,*
*Pass through the Yellow Path’s *gāngfēng* winds,*
*Arrive at the Vermilion Palace,*
*Disembark, and reintegrate the attendants into the body.*
*Swallow saliva, strike the teeth,*
*Then proceed according to the prescribed method,*
*Returning each to its proper domain.*
*Suddenly, the form vanishes—*
*The *Nine Palaces, Eight Gates* Omen Chart.*

**Sun Shock, Moon Rest:**
*When *jiǎzǐ* (the first heavenly stem-branch) arrives at the Central Palace,*
*It is the *Kūn* Earth Gate.*
*The remaining sixty *jiǎzǐ* follow in cycles.*
*The Yellow Nine Palaces:*
*Each day governs one position,*
*Cycling endlessly.*
*On days matching the native *yin* day,*
*Rest on *yang* days—*
*The preceding position opens the Palace.*
*According to the Nine Palaces’ *jiǎzǐ*,*
*From *yǐ* to *dīng*, the evasions rise—*
*Most verified.*
*This must remain supremely secret.*
*If later disciples receive this,*
*Never reveal it lightly—*
*Disaster will fall upon the Nine Ancestors,*
*The Bridge, and your wife’s lineage.*

**The Longevity Wheel and Dipper Rotation:**

*If born on *jiǎzǐ*,*
*Metal’s *chángshēng* reaches *wèi*.*
*Thus begins the pattern—*
*Child is *Pòjūn* (the Broken Army),*
*Single-marching to its native month,*
*Then retreating—*
*Determining auspicious or inauspicious months.*
*Count *chángshēng* to the fetal stage,*
*Then add *xiū*, *yōu*, *sǐ*, and *jué*—*
*Predicting misfortune for the ill,*
*Which month they reside in,*
*To know life, death, and fortune.*
*Again, take the hour—*
*For example, *wǔ* (Fire)—*
*Fire’s *chángshēng* reaches *yín*.*
*As before,*
*Count forward to determine the direct influence,*
*Add the native day,*
*Then cross-check which day aligns with the native *wǔ*—*
*Thus, life, death, and fortune are known.*

*Oral transmission exhausts here—*
*Only the enlightened can comprehend.*

*Rest, imprisonment, death, and absolute void,*
*Then add *xiū*, *yōu*, *sǐ*, *jué*—*
*For the afflicted, which month they were born,*
*To know fortune or misfortune.*

*Tested a thousand times—*
*Thousandfold verified,*
*The master’s transmission never errs,*
*Only the disciple’s blame.*
*The gods will not respond.*

*Knock, knock—*
*Never lightly divulge these mysteries.*

*Called *Dǎménchuí* (Striking the Gate),*

终须宽裹急。」
one must eventually broaden and then narrow the approach.

「恰直起时病，
If illness arises at the exact moment of uprightness,

安在三两日。」
it will not last beyond three days.

「若直欢娱时，
If illness arises during a time of joy and merriment,

病者愈为奇。」
the sick person’s recovery will be miraculous.

「若直忧立时，
If illness arises during a time of sorrow and distress,

病者见倾危。」
the sick person faces imminent peril.

「若言吉财吉，
If one speaks of auspicious fortune,

若言凶则凶。」
while if one speaks of ill-fate, ill-fate will prevail.

「来人气象好，
If visitors appear with a favorable *气象* (aura),

祸福不相同。」
fortune and misfortune will not be the same.

「我身无事阻，
If my own body faces no obstruction,

即往运亨通。」
then all endeavors will proceed smoothly and auspiciously.

「The hunched back and staff arrive—
the sick will die without need for medicine.

A raincoat and straw hat come to greet—
the mourning garments loom, pressing with urgency.

When parasols summon me back and forth,
the seven-day mourning may be granted leniency.

If the person wears coarse hemp,
the mourning attire is prepared in due course.

A headcloth and cap strengthen the body—
the sick will soon regain health.

At this time, if one tastes food or drink,
wealth and horses will not be severed.

If one drinks early spring tea,
its refreshing coolness proves most beneficial.

If one consumes all manner of fruits,
boils and abscesses will worsen daily.

If the epidemic does not harm,
chronic illness resists medicine’s calming.

On the road, if no obstacles are met,
the aged will return with the vigor of youth.

If one encounters others’ entreaties first,
the illness lingers, delayed in its answer.

When I return home with uprightness,
stars and constellations emerge from the clouds.

If I speak with others in anger,
the sick will face *迍否* (obstruction and misfortune).

When called during times of joy and celebration,
morning sickness vanishes by nightfall.

After clear skies in spring or winter,
the *晦滞* (obscured and stagnant) will multiply with rain.

After clear skies in summer or autumn,
no medicine is needed—the illness will heal.

When called, observe their demeanor—
cleverness lies in the mind’s keen insight.

Another method for predicting one’s return:
Do not rely solely on the time—use the mouth as reference.

For instance, if *子时* (midnight) is given,
*子* belongs to Water—Water and Earth flourish at midnight.

Using this as precedent,
compare it to the *长生斗* (Celestial Longevity Measure),
and proceed through each node in rotation.

If one meets *子* (Water) in its ascendancy,
it is indeed flourishing.

The person will surely return on *子丑* (midnight to 1–3 AM) days.
If *养* (Nourishing) is encountered, they will return as well.

The rest follow this pattern analogously.

Fear not the black wind or towering waves—
the ship’s journey depends entirely on the helmsman’s skill.

*—Chao Yuan An* (□) *—(□) Om—*

Tread the iron shoes until no trace remains,
yet seek not—it comes effortlessly.
*—Hūm—* Leaf and branch unite.»

**Secret Appendix:**

Above the kidneys, below the heart—
to the west of the liver, to the left of the lungs—
this is the **Divine Brightness Acupoint**,
within which lie the **Kàn-Lí Palaces** [1].

With the tongue’s tip, inscribe:
*"Óng"*—when the character moves, *"Hūm"*—
emerging from the **Kàn and Lí hexagrams**.

The Dragon issues forth from fire’s embrace,
the Tiger is born within the water’s depths.

With the **orifices** drawing in water and fire into the talisman,
take the **iron armor’s silver radiance** into it,

Revealing it to the unworthy
brings calamity to the nine ancestral lines,
a grave misfortune—
be exceedingly cautious.

Blood-slave, flesh-slave, you are the **compassionate true parents**.

The **Tiān Péng Curse** forms the **Wēn Shuài’s** original self-symbol.
The talisman invokes the **Earthly Deities’ Marshal Wēn**,
conjuring the **Six Tiān-Gān Generals**—**Nǐ Dān Sòng**—
commanding the **Supervising Officials of Fate and Land Spirits**,
to safeguard the child,
whereby the affliction of **nightly crying** shall cease—
the talisman’s arrival shall swiftly resolve it.
Upon its arrival, execute as commanded.
