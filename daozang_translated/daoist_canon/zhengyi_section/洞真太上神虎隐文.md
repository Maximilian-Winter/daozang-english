The Hidden Writ of the Divine Tiger of the Supreme Cavern-Realms

The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao strummed the *Jinglong Yun’ao*, its celestial tones cascading in myriad echoes, resplendent and surging, purple mists swirling in shadow, the eightfold winds of the Mysterious Dao arising. Thereupon, the Jade Phoenix stretched its neck, the Golden Simurgh composed its *qi*, dragons intoned over sapphire waves, tigers leapt upon the Jasper Isle, ninefold roars harmonized, the Mysterious Chime pervaded the Cavern-Heavens. Subdued beasts bared their claws, fierce steeds opened their throats, the *Huo* peaks loomed vast, swords in maw to seize the perverse. A tumult of voices arose, a hundred apes shrieking in demonic frenzy.

Then the Supreme Lord commanded the handmaidens of the Jade Clarity Upper Palace—An Faying, Tian Sifei, Zhao Dingzhu, and Li Yunmen—to join in singing the divine hymn that dispels spectral essences and scatters demonic spirits. Their verses proclaimed:

> Once we rode the reins of Great Radiance,
> Eightfold floating to the Cloud Encampment.
> The divine lineage ordered the numinous heart,
> Dragon brushes adorned the Jade Capital.
> Golden Gates wove luxuriant splendor,
> Nine Chambers gleamed with purple jasper.
> Lofty chariots traversed the Northern Origin,
> Whispering into the realm of No-Birth.
> Crimson Tigers guided the spirit-master,
> Green axles ascended to Supreme Clarity.
> The Four Mysteries illumined the morning taboo,
> Embracing blossoms to return to Phoenix City.
> Seven trials still bound to karmic ties,
> Yet we aspired to the Ninefold Primal Crossroads.
> Proclaiming the radiance of the Treasured Great Brilliance,
> Swift winds leapt, scattering luminous hues.
> We arrayed and controlled the Pristine Homeland,
> River spirits advanced as vanguard.
> Yin clouds girded the night-sun,
> Torch-moon suddenly met in first exchange.
> Binding clarity to birth the Crimson Spirit,
> Hand in hand we returned to Nothingness.
> Myriad sources poured into the Northern Vale,
> Riding the void to follow the shooting stars.
> Extinguishing light to pluck the floating wanderer,
> Towering peaks soared in celestial waves.
> Entwined in the abode of joyous music,
> Subtle wonders emerged toward the empty.
> The Leisurely Mansion cradled the Cinnabar Mystery-Pearl,
> The Great Void’s Dao flowed unimpeded.
> Dark and bright wielded the numinous tally,
> How could hidden reckoning stray or fail?
> Falling Mystery revealed the assembly of multitudes,
> Birth’s beginning seemed a long dream.
> Virtue concealed its traces within the Void,
> Utmost stillness unknowingly arrived.
> Spirit-essence responded to the Great Simplicity,
> Misty reflections dwelt wherever it went.
> Mysterious echoes resounded beyond form,
> How could twilight branches raise doubt?
> Harmonizing dawn’s drum with the long fan,
> Radiant clouds arose here and now.
> Cutting through the abyss, the profound current flowed,
> Soaring wings reached the Sixfold Terrace.
> The Divine King entered Jade Clarity,
> Utmost Nothingness overcame the Crimson Host.
> Ninefold Nets met in the distant obscure,
> The wondrous assembly was already at peace.
> The Dao treasury’s Golden Ultimate Chapter,
> Strummed and tuned to blazing cypress splendor.
> A thousand dragons spewed green waters,
> Nine Rivers poured in inverse torrents.
> Vast mists seized the remote abode,
> Numinous waves filled the Four-Canopied Court.
> Heads aligned beneath towering silken eaves,
> None sought to examine form or name.
> Leading and uplifting, embracing harmony’s bloom,
> Releasing the Mysterious to grasp the principles of transformation.
> Containing essence, illuminating cloud-chambers,
> Whispering winds purified the desolate records.
> The numinous Dao hastened to the Orchid Palace,
> The Profoundest Profound—how could it be arrayed?
> Myriad peaks lay in wondrous view,
> Above the clouds dwelt the Jasper Child.
> Through kalpas harmonizing with Jade Blossoms,
> Unaware, the day’s beginning had come.
> Primal spirits aligned with Cavern-Transformation,
> Sinking and concealing, forgetting fixed signs.
> River Lords bound the Upper Observatory,
> Luminous pearls adorned the Jasper Court.
> Ordering the Origin beyond the Three Numinous,
> How could congealing clarity suffer loss or gain?
> The Great Yang intermingled with layered Yin,
> Turning and sweeping to preserve the fallen obscure.
> Fully entrusted beyond the Six Perceptions,
> Numinous chants resounded as one.
> The turning mechanism of the Jade Han Dao,
> Resplendent, stirred the blossoming jasper.
> Myriad spirits mounted crimson steeds,
> A thousand demons found no leisure to arise.
> Demonic forces of water and fire perished,
> The true self preserved Supreme Purity.
> The Four Lifespans of Northern *A*,
> Ordered spirits and steadied reins.
> Summoning Earth’s deities,
> Earth’s essences concealed their *qi*.
> Mountains and peaks hid their clouds,
> Nine Sources were cut off and extinguished.
> Pushing and examining a thousand spirits,
> Seizing captives amid thunderous quaking.
> The Northern Emperor opened the Dao,
> Four Illuminations offered their axles.
> Shattering myriad perversities,
> Carving and severing Feng Mountain.
> Nine ghosts shared a single head,
> A thousand demons merged into one body.
> Five Emperors wielded halberds,
> Divine Lords exhaled mist.
> Purple clarity rose in majestic observation,
> Crimson *qi* coiled in layered strands.
> Spirits fled to the Night Terrace,
> Essences concealed in eternal continuity.
> Venomous beasts of ten thousand feet,
> Slaughtered without kinship.
> What petty demon,
> Gathering in hundreds or thousands,
> Could exchange *qi* and gaze in unison,
> Standing before the Gate of Human Life?
> The Divine Tiger unleashed its might,
> Slashing and tearing, decapitating and maiming.
> The wondrous Dao of the Supreme Origin,
> The utmost numinous selects its own.
> Now you receive it,
> Wear it forever upon your person.
> Tested ten thousand times, it remains unchallenged,
> A thousand demons dare not approach.
> Jade Blossoms enter your chamber,
> Heavenly Perfected wander in cycles.
> Chanting the luminous numinous tones,
> Ascend to pay homage to the Three Origins.

When the hymn concluded, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao commanded Yu Lixuan, the Jade Gentleman of the Left Mystery, to take up the Golden Feathered Staff and summon the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity condensed his refined *qi*, wielding true flourishing emptiness. With a roar, he summoned the myriad spirits, embracing the primordial origin. In his hand he held the Golden Real, his gaze serene upon the Great Nothingness. Suddenly hearing the command, he hastened to mount his chariot. Feathered spirits and Crimson Sovereigns opened the Daoist procession, celestial soldiers and ten thousand tigers drove forth golden dragons. Jade batons led the troops, casting radiant blossoms into flight. They entered the dark, streaming with torchlight, their resplendent ranks advancing. The Solar Essence struck the azure drums beside the waves, the jasper bells rang out in resonant peals.

Thereupon, the Mysterious Chime harmonized, the grand music fell silent. Nine Phoenixes stretched their necks and cried in unison, a hundred dragons held the pitch-pipes and exhaled as one. Golden essences leapt in melody, entering the simurghs’ soaring dance. Purple banners rose into the heavens, brocade pennants wound through the fields. Green canopies arrayed in shade, the winding dawn suddenly arose. Flowing bells tossed in exchange, moonlight pierced the echoes. Jasper staffs displayed the true, revolving in the Five Images. Fragrant flowers scattered in mist, blossoms of the Three Luminants. Light clouds received the radiance, thin auroras girded the light. Sevenfold reins chimed, eight chariots floated in the void. Nine thousand empty carriages were guarded by venomous dragons. Racing clouds hastened to the Mysterious, gathering *qi* to seize the winds. The heavens brightened, eightfold lights enveloped all. True maidens rode to the right, numinous youths were commanded to the left. In a flash, a thousand myriad arrived at the Upper Palace, halting their chariots in Jade Clarity. Rising from the Imperial Ramparts, they turned their steps toward the Purple Gates, bowing their heads in reverence to await audience.

After a long while, the Great Dao of the Grand Centrality commanded the Four Ministers of the Dawn Attendant to slowly lead them forward, ascending the gates of the Jeweled Blossom and entering the inner chambers of the Sevenfold Radiance. The Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity announced his name, saying: "Your humble servant has now arrived. I request the revelation of the Great Mandate."

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao declared: "Li Shanyuan’s virtue aligns with the Seven Sages, and he shall be the master of the Golden Towers. Soon, he will pay homage to the Ten Heavens, govern the destinies of the myriad beings, determine the Middle Prime within the Mysterious Mechanism, and regulate yin and yang to unify all. He shall extract the true and elevate the leaders, seal the rivers and summon the seas, sever the threads of life and death, and grasp the awe of heaven. He will decapitate the Six Heavens, command the punishments of the Three Bureaus, and enforce the judgments of the Northern Emperor.

"Noble sir, you stand by the imperial chariot—your Dao is lofty, your virtue vast and far-reaching, your responsibilities weighty, your authority commensurate. You have been instructed in wisdom, and further, your memory has been fortified against demonic forces. Wisdom can drive away spirits, and the dispelling of demons can eradicate evil. Now, I bestow upon you the True Talisman of the Divine Tiger, that you may wield its might to decapitate the Six Heavens. I chant for you the Lofty Chapter of Divine Command to assist in dispersing filth and banishing calamities.

"Moreover, the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity treasures the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger, which governs the spirits of heaven and earth. When commanded, it can shatter and slay a thousand spirits; when worn, it causes ten thousand ghosts to vanish. Any demon that dares to invade will perish, and every malevolent entity that gazes upon it will be plunged into darkness. Thus, it may be entrusted to Shanyuan to fulfill his duties."

Thereupon, the Heavenly Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bowed in reverence and opened his cloud-bound scripture case, revealing a jade casket. Sevenfold light illuminated the silk, and streaming sunlight unveiled the truth. Ninefold radiance paused in splendor as fragrant incense intertwined. Before the talisman was bestowed, the Heavenly Emperor personally commanded the attendant maidens of the Grand Tenuity—Jilin Hua, Yancai Yun, Zhutiao Yan, and Han Fangyao—to join in singing the *Poem of the Golden True* and the *Melody of Pacing the Void*. The lyrics were as follows:

The Great Darkness severs the Four Mysteries,
The cavernous light entrusts divine communion.
Jade terraces unfold in crimson auroras,
Green mists cradle golden ramparts.
Above, one draws from the cloud-pearl collar,
Gazing up to receive the peak without blade.
The numinous mirror dreads the purple halls,
Vermilion radiance fills the empty midst.
Mysterious transformations entwine the dark root,
Grasping the tally and leading the purple youths.
The round path knows no stagnation,
Luminous mists layer upon layer.
To the south, the vermilion mounds’ gates swing open,
To the west, one crosses the jagged casement.
The body soars over ten thousand waves,
The spirit arises to gather the ten directions.
The dark returns to the silent axle,
Ascending to ride the celestial dragon.
The dark chariot of flying light,
Brandishing bells, roams the Seven Paths.
Light ripples drift upon cloud-dust fords,
In an instant, they arrive at the Jade Land.
To the left, the Jade Radiance consort is summoned,
To the right, the Golden True husband is commanded.
Above, they meet the awakening of flying auroras,
Below, they receive the numinous and wondrous domains.
They weave through the vast halls of Guanghan,
Unfurling brocade to enter the divine mounds.
Phoenix brains secure the kalpas’ span,
Blossom nectar restores fading splendor.
The Most High truly abounds in longevity,
Commanding the myriad tiers of the cosmos.
The Three Awakenings uphold the dark reckoning,
Joy unfurls in radiant spirals.
The tempest’s brilliance halts the wave-flowers;
Why do the purple cassia trees sway so?
Jade fruits chime in the ninefold heavens,
Jade staves march toward the Grand Tenuity.
The yellow writ restrains the blade of virtue—
How could it harm the radiance of the perfected?
Discarding the plain to enter formlessness,
The hundred images all begin to fade.
The yang essence of cinnabar qi sharpens,
Resplendent crimson clouds take flight.
In harmony with the stillness of Jade Radiance,
Dazzling light hangs over the Upper Clarity’s borders.
Spirits respond to the dark reckoning,
Following resonance to summon the world’s omens.
Vast ford-waves surge in lush profusion,
Joining light to partake in the countenance’s lineage.
O towering child of the Golden Towers,
Desolate, you enter the numinous verge.
Looking up and down, the myriad changes shift—
To comply is to unite in spirit.
The dark perches upon the Silent Terrace,
Pure chanting of wisdom and insight.
Dispelling demons to diminish ten thousand blades,
Waving the poem to expel filth.
The Golden Tiger bears heaven’s might,
Crushing spirits to conceal their qi.
Sweeping away a thousand myriad demons,
Ten thousand leagues of celestial evil reduced to dust.

At this, the great spirit,
Severs the blood of a hundred spirits,
Blinds the eyes of the Golden Tiger,
Unleashes its mane to spew might,
Releases venom to cast out ghosts,
Unrelenting in its cross-cutting,
Ripping open the bellies of the Six Heavens,
Uniting the heads of the divine spirits,
Forcing birds and beasts to cower,
Hiding their cries in forests and grasses,
Prostrating before the Great Origin.

The wondrous and transcendent numinous script,
Dark and profound, is worn upon the body,
And thus one may proceed to pay court to the Jade Emperor,
Offering rites in the inner chambers,
As the assembled perfected ones arrive at their abodes.

Should the Divine Tiger script be leaked,
Calamity will befall the Nine Clans.
Should the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger be divulged,
Disaster will reach the Seven Ancestors.
Shanyuan, guard it well—you are the flower of Dao and virtue.

At night, if fear arises,
Simply chant these two poems,
And a thousand spirits will scatter and hide,
As if ten thousand men shared your lodging.
When mountains and rivers hear this chant,
They will wield whips toward the sound and bow in reverence.

The latter poem was transcribed by the Ninth Radiance Peaceful Consort.
On the sixth day of the eleventh month, at the fifth watch before dawn,
The Purple Clarity Ninth Radiance Peaceful Consort came to bestow it,
Commanding that it be written before daybreak.
It is recorded in the *Scroll of the Most High’s Eight Arts: Wisdom, Demon-Dispelling, Divine Tiger, and Hidden Script*.
