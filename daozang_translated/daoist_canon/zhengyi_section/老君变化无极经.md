---

Within the boundless transformations of Lord Lao,
Emerging from the hidden depths of the Yellow Chamber Palace.
Refining the form, pure and serene, in union with the Void,
Radiance and light spread throughout the eight directions.

Once the True Name is revealed, the Nine Lords assemble,
The Dao’s principles endure, joy without end.
Mounting the chariot drawn by nine dragons, with attendants in tow,
Ascending the eight-tiered jade tower.

From the golden terrace, gazing upon Mount Hua,
Where the Perfected Ones upon the mountain bestowed upon me this scripture.
They taught me to cultivate the Dao, keeping the body pure,
Beware of lust and excess, lest they destroy your form.

Purify the body, cleanse the self, and attain longevity,
For the Dao of Lord Lao naturally aligns with this.
Without seeking the fame of this Dao’s teachings,
How can one transcend calamity and attain rebirth?

The wise contemplate this and grasp its essence,
Sealing the breath within, releasing it in threads, qi becomes luminous.
Transmission and copying follow the proper method, arising with the seasons,
Harvesting in autumn, storing in winter, entering the Yellow Court.
Subtle and profound, qi merges as one.

Lord Lao transforms and alters his form,
Appearing among the Hu as the True Scripture.
The Hu people rebel without sincerity,
Surrendering by day, betraying by night, incurring guilt.

Their tribes and strongmen meet ruin,
Kneeling in supplication, begging for life.
Lord Lao, steadfast in resolve, refuses to heed,
Condemning them to wear the red robes of punishment.

Shaving their heads, cutting their beards as a pledge of faith,
Severing ties with wives, forbidding the taking of life.
If they can follow the transformation and transcend their names,
They may eat once at noon and recite the True Scripture.

They must not deceive, slacken, or indulge in lust,
For those who violate the law will have their forms destroyed.
The Hu people, humbled, revere the Dao’s power,
Following the turning of the times into the Western Han.

The surname is Wood and Child, the given name Bow,
Dwelling in the Chengdu Prefecture of Shu Commandery.
From the Crimson-Named Realm emerges the Icehouse,
Bow and Long unite to establish the Center of Heaven.

Riding the Three, employing the Six, myriad spirits revere,
True ranks of the Three Masters bear names.
Twenty-four Treaties bring qi to fulfillment,
Dividing talismans, contracts, statutes, and decrees.

Punitive talismans and temple subjugations follow fixed penalties,
Lord Lao’s Orthodox Law makes the Dao resplendent.
Immortal officials record petitions as requested,
The *Yin-Yang Central Canon* remains unknown to men.

Only the Dragon-Womb Master transforms the form,
White-haired and fluttering, he roams the Celestial Court.
Feathers and wings spread, plumage complete,
Five-colored and dappled like arrayed stars.
The Jade Armillary and Balanced Standard bear their true names.

Dwelling where misty waves rise in the eastern sea,
Sea waters do not flow unless winds stir them.
Without bounds or shores, east and west align,
Not resisting the gentle current, thus it endures long.
Vast and boundless, the great sea is king of a hundred valleys,
A hundred rivers pour in, waters surging.
Its source lies in Kunlun’s Hua-Yin Hall,
Where yin qi surges, difficult to withstand.

One should guard against it to avert calamity,
Attaining Great Peace and ascending to the Immortal Chambers.
Riding clouds and driving dragons to Nanyang,
Feasting and dining, the traveling kitchen fills the belly.
Plucking the zither, strumming strings, raising cups of joy,
One must discern tones and distinguish gong from shang.
Jue and zhi arise together in the same hall.

I enter the Dark River to still the Spring’s Origin,
The Great Dao lies level and open—who has not heard?
Nurturing scholars, all under heaven call themselves subjects,
Disciples bow twice and inquire of what is asked.

The Dao holds subtle qi that gives life to humankind,
Yet this is not something the benighted can expound.
The Dao’s qi flows ceaselessly, hard to follow,
Dispersing and circulating like floating clouds.
Floating clouds drift lightly back into the mountains,
Passing through no aperture, entering no gate.
Subtle matters are difficult to speak of—
Those who grasp the subtle ascend as immortals.
They wander beside the Five Peaks and Weak Waters,
Where Weak Waters admit no one, slaying all who enter.
Those with wisdom and insight avert calamity,
Abiding with the world in endless joy.
Who knows the Mysterious Mandate of Great Purity?
People of this age are mostly foolish and blind.
When the seven-and-nine cycle ends, demonic thieves arise—
Why not guard and cultivate yourself in advance?
Bitter words and beneficial deeds never deceive;
Once parted from oneself, when shall reunion come?
Dao and worldly ways differ—ponder this well.
Mountains and hills overgrown with weeds are hard to tend.
A good physician places ten in the mouth,
Kind and joyful gentlemen are what the people long for.
Simply open your heart and hasten to it,
Dispelling evil and rebellion without doubt.
The hesitant and doubtful cannot cultivate the Dao.

Dragons transform into floating clouds, reaching the southern barbarians,
The Yangtze’s waters run dry, the people grow few.
Demonic thieves roam among the populace,
Disrupting and stifling qi—no one can distinguish.
When the Master Lord emerges, he slays them all,
And only then does Great Peace reveal the True Lord.

Excessive fortune becomes the seed of humanity,
Inscribed names ascend to the Supreme Lord on High.
Bestowed with talismans and registers to guard the body’s form,
Thoughts like a summoning—ever following one.
Reverence like attendance—intimately close,
True qi arrives and attaches, forming the myriad spirits.
With heaven it preserves, ascending Kunlun,
Harnessing nine dragons, journeying like clouds.
The radiant youths reach Liaodong,
When urgent matters arise, swift horses bear the message.
A thousand li pursued like flying bees,
Yet poisonous and harmful qi cannot be breached.
Roads blocked and severed, no passage remains—
Alas, in this world, longing for the Nine Lords.
A mother’s nurturing of her child shares the same intent,
Without bias or partiality, one may follow.
Spirit birds repel evil and dispel the multitude of ills,
Treacherous ministers and villainous sons plunge into the earth.
Then comes Great Peace, the qi pure and just,
The True Lord emerges, discerning men’s countenances.

Three, five, seven, nine—inner and outer in harmony,
The methods of nurturing life, qi in accord.
Harmonious and compliant, above and below, no calamity strikes,
Yet many fail to comprehend, idly speaking of emptiness.
Western affairs unfinished, broken and bound again,
Holding the heart in hesitation, no path to follow.
Great disaster suddenly arrives, roads impassable—
You wish to flee the world, east of Huayin.
Wandering atop high mountains, gazing at the sea’s waters,
The sun’s rising vast and boundless, unbearable to behold.
It darkens men’s eyes, inviting transgression and guilt,
Fish hide in deep abysses, lured to death by bait.
The south not only devours its own tail,
Liver and heart live alone, the body as if dead.
Within the Golden Countenance City, a white pheasant appears,
A rarity in the world, the sight of men.
Forbidden ground’s treasures must not be approached—
Greed, lust, and desire rend the heart asunder.
Corpses strewn violently, drawing sighs from men,
Unable to purify themselves, they cry out to heaven in resentment.

Our Dao is pure and unsullied, selecting the seed-people,
Few possess clear understanding to respond to our scripture.
South to Huai and Yang, crossing Meng Ford,
A floating bridge flutters lightly atop the water’s crest.

The myriad clans pass without hindrance,
Their names recorded on scrolls at the ford’s gate.
They falsely claim to escort the officials,
Yet upon inquiry, their true origins are revealed.
Human hearts return to their feelings, restoring the root,
For roots deeply probed endure, and things revert to nature.
The qi of nature emerges from emptiness and nothingness,
The vast and boundless Lu Dao moves in harmony with it.
Fortunate to have the innocent ones lend support,
They shed the net’s entanglements, their six wings unfurled.
Crying to the heavens, they soar toward the Nine Capitals,
Yet who can unravel the essence of the Nine Capitals?
The immortal Wang Qiao dwells in his stone hut,
Serving as disciple to Laozi, their lives aligned in accord.
Surveying the ages of emperors, he knows rise and fall,
The noble man of the Dao harbors no sorrow in his heart.
Vast and cleansing like a ceaseless flow,
The hundred rivers’ waters return to the sea.
The sea’s surging waves hold boundless aspiration,
Yet boundless constraints give way to Wo Jiao.
Wo Jiao receives all without fail, dissolving it,
Transforming scattered forms into drifting clouds.
The drifting clouds, light and fleeting, return to the mountains,
Condensing at the valley’s mouth to form sweet springs.
When affairs converge in the twilight, the household falls silent,
Divine boys and jade maidens stand in attendance.
They assist men and women in becoming the ten thousand spirits,
And the ten thousand spirits all arise as perfected beings.
Once perfected, they ascend as immortals,
Roaming the Five Peaks upon purple clouds.
Yoked to six dragons, they meet at Heaven’s Gate,
Where harmful qi deters all from advancing.
Ten journeys, ten deaths, none return at first—
If you wish to enter the gate, follow Lu Ban.
I speak to the world’s master craftsmen:
The Chamber of Lingering Yin lies within the Central Cinnabar.
Inner and outer flow freely without hindrance,

Harmonizing qi and uniting sound, the Dao’s origin unfurls.
The Dao’s continuity—who can truly follow?
In a town of ten households, not one holds the mean.
My Dao-qi is constrained, unable to expand;
I rage at the ghostly teachers who blame my ministers.
Summoning and selecting seeds without diligence,
The Great Peace nears—affairs must be divided.
Petitions list names before the Grand Clarity,
With merits, conduct, and records compiled as one.
Within the Jade Calendar lie the names of the living—
The Three Qi must be complete to cherish the child’s form.
Without practicing the Three, Five, Seven, or Nine births,
How can one transcend and witness the Great Peace?

The *Yin-Yang Central Classic*’s matters are hard to fathom,
Yet at times, enlightenment comes through keen reflection.
Emerging from yang, entering yin, reaching profound darkness,
Within the Eight Poles lie the Nine Cities.
Within the Nine Palaces, the celestial patterns align—
The Three Qi and Five Qi give rise to the body.
Seven and Nine dispel misfortune and ward off calamity,
The celestial reckoning flows with the seasons’ clarity.

The Three Masters issue teachings to officers and soldiers,
Guardian Generals encamp around the dwelling.
They repel stale qi and expel malevolent spirits,
While the Martial Lord brings blessings to the central courtyard.
Disasters vanish, harm recedes, the Dao grows radiant,
Names resound far and wide, the world knows glory,
Descendants flourish, aiding ministers and lords.
Crimson Chariot Envoys stand at the gate pavilion,
Attendants flank the Dao’s portal.
Scribes and clerks occupy the center,
The Lord of the Middle Prime oversees the records.

Unblocking stagnation to return to one’s homeland,
Dwelling in peace and joy, life extends long.
Surveying the Five Emperors’ rule over the Han heartland,
Great trees flourish, spreading their fame.
Drooping branches and leaves shade the yang,
The Four Seas gather to form pillars and beams.
Exhorting men and women to kindness,
Breathing life into the Eight Woods, qi reigns supreme.
The true Dharma establishes the celestial and earthly order,
Heaven and Earth’s sovereigns rectify yin and yang.
The Dao resides within, its name proclaimed—
The Chamber of Lingering Yin shimmers in dark yellow.
Lush lingzhi mushrooms blanket the palace halls,
Jade towers and golden gates stand on either side.
Bronze sentinels sit in watchful gaze,
Guarding the public gates with frost-like severity.
The crimson gates blaze—who can withstand them?
The worthy and noble are called "Dao Masters."
To prevent calamity and dispel harm, contemplate the Primordial Yang,
Qi overflows, suffusing the body with radiant splendor.
Feathers sprout upon my form as I soar through the clouds,
Ascending to meet the Venerable Lord in the Yellow Mountains.
Roaming the Southern Peak, lodging in tranquil chambers,
I wander with the immortal Wang Qiao.
Westward to the Broad Han, traversing the Long Wall,
In Chang’an’s city, barbarian horses neigh.
Tossing their heads, bits clenched, the people take alarm,
Fleeing in panic, they abandon the empty earthen walls.
Father and son turn to tigers, seizing the hour’s advantage,
Observing the world’s vicissitudes, they proclaim their names.

The era is tumultuous, qi unsettled,
Cold and heat afflict the human form.
Rebellious hair and inverted sitting punish the greedy,
The world dreads their might, laws and bans constrain.
The man of Dao remains untroubled,
Vast and pure, dwelling in the long flow.
Water’s bound current knows no rest,
Lightly the skiff glides, drifting with the wind.
Oars and sculls urge it onward, swift as floating,
Passing one another without delay.
To linger is to sink or rise—
Harming the ignorant and deepening others’ sorrow.

Southward across rivers and seas to Jianye’s city,
Where once great joy brought descendants glory.
Failing to uphold the root leads to ruin in death,
In the southern lands, miasmic qi withers the grass.
Birds cannot fly past it, men perish in its grip—
To avoid harm and live long, keep distance.
Guard the Dao to build merit and fame,
Never covet wealth, lust, or desire.
Be steadfast, pure, and resolute—your will must be clear,
Only then can you transcend and witness the Great Peace.

The True Lord of Great Peace once more brings clarity,
Ordering documents to await the crane’s cry.
The Twenty-Four Governances convene at Yangping,
Their overseers record households and names.
Removing death and inscribing life, they ascend to the Grand Clarity,
Texts and teachings are made distinct.
Out with the old, in with the new—grants are bestowed,
Merits are tallied to protect all beings.
Male and female officials bear separate titles,
The wise overseers refine human forms.
If one with understanding seeks life,
Open their heart, transform them together, and first solidify sincerity.
List their names on the register to transcend life,
Never obstruct or block human sentiment.
Overseers must be discerning, pondering the scriptures—
If one breaks the law, their crimes are recorded.
Whips and cudgels bring bodily affliction,
Those who govern the people must keep their hearts level.
Never act perversely or harbor selfish motives,
Nor let lust, desire, or beauty enslave your form.

Idle and scattered, the libationers—both new and old—
With dull natures and obstructed minds, fail to grasp the truth.
Discoursing on the Dao’s origin, they madly delude others,
Their vulgar tongues expose them to common inquiry.
Inviting disaster, they face the Three Examinations,
Yet as kin of the Dao’s qi, they receive no grace.
Unable to repent or appeal to higher powers,
They provoke the overseers’ precise judgment.
Good and evil bear distinct names, their deeds recorded—
I have officials among men to enforce this.
Drive them to ruin, even unto death,
For those above, excessive desires lack loyalty.
The people, burdened by corvée, neglect farming,
Planting out of season, flowers wither without bloom.
Half the eggs spoil, their names inscribed in death,
Grain becomes gold and jade—cut off their sustenance.
People gaze at one another, faces sallow with reproach,
Hearts heavy with sorrow, suffering worse than bereavement.

In an age of chaos, no order remains,
Rulers greedy, ministers corrupt, laws forsaken.
The world seeks change, yet no loyal men appear,
Loyal ministers and filial sons hide in seclusion.
Avoiding worldly affairs, they feign madness,
While treacherous ministers and villains soar in ambition.
Righteous words are spoken to restore order,
Upholding justice, wielding authority, easing the heart’s burden.
Officials falter, losing their moral compass,
Soldiers and hundreds of officers endure hardship.
Bearing earth, treading water, they march in lament,
The hundred rivers’ currents rush toward the marsh city.
The true onslaught is hard to withstand—
Fire loses its brightness, the sun dims.
Fiefs and lands are leveled, the state becomes a kingdom,
The people of Qi sigh, their bodies broken.
Raising sheep that turn to tigers, mice to wolves,
Their names and natures change, their norms overturned.

Westward across the famous waters, through fiery paths,
Deep forests and valleys brim with poisonous frost.
A hundred grasses are slaughtered, their leaves wither yellow,
In the first month of spring, the heavens align.
The Dipper’s pivot turns with the morning sun,
Nurturing all life, extending their years.
In harmony with Heaven, they become divine generals,
Han Zhong and Fan Li assist in their governance.
Consuming the Nine Elixirs, fasting on grain,
Dwelling in famed mountains, in stone chambers and halls.

Before lies the source’s long flow, its course vast—
Chaos follows to the sea’s southern light.
The sea’s waters, still, thicken like paste,
The source’s roar unchecked, none to withstand.
Neither sweet nor bitter, scentless, unscented,
Yet within, the crimson child crosses to life.

My Dao defies mortal sentiment,
Its true law aligns with Heaven and Earth, the body bright.
The Way emerges from subtlety, enters the Mystery’s palace,
Vast and distant, boundless, fathomless.
Like a hundred rivers flowing to the sea,
No stream too small to deepen its expanse.

Scholars who love learning yearn for purity and loyalty,
Humble and yielding, their resolve held deep.
Unaligned with divided hearts, they refine their origin,
For I, the Dao, cherish life and love the good.
Harmonizing the people, embracing simplicity, guarding unadorned integrity—
Xu You washed his ears by the river’s edge.
Pure and unsullied, set apart from the crowd,
He rested on stone, rinsed his mouth with the stream, meditated on truth.
Gathering the essence of mushrooms, he became ten thousand spirits,
Consuming the Three Subtleties, drinking the divine elixir.
His lifespan endless, linked to Heaven,
Roaming and playing beyond all limits, through the Eightfold Gates.
The Eightfold Tower of Departure bends and extends,
Within the Ninefold Depths, profound and unpeopled.
Who can divide the qi of Chaos?
It unfolds yin and yang, spreading the Dao’s origin.
Nurturing the limbs, sprouting the flower’s root,
The root grows firm and enduring, as nature intends.
The qi of nature flows from Kunlun,
North of the mountain, bitter and desolate, lie warm springs.
They heal all ailments, dispel misfortune,
Even the guilty find fortune renewed.
The *Laozi’s Transformations Beyond Limits* concludes here.
