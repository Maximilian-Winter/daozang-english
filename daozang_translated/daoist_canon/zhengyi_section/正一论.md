**The Orthodox Unity Treatise**

**Scripture Title:** *Orthodox Unity Treatise*. Author unknown, approximately composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Section Zhengyi, Part One.

A guest posed a challenge, saying: It is said that the Three give birth to the myriad things, and the Great Dao is without partiality. Destiny is bestowed by Heaven, and August Heaven does not deceive. Sustained by Earth, one calls Earth surely profound. Birth comes unsummoned, and death departs unsent. The Dao follows spontaneity, and humans likewise emulate it. Fortune and misfortune are fixed in their allotments, each received accordingly—how could seeking blessings distance calamity?

Moreover, the sagely teachings were handed down at appointed times. Why then does the world’s Dao vary, now new, now old? Ninety-six schools each claim wondrous transformation—how does the Daoist tradition distinguish its essential teaching? The *Lingbao* method serves dual purposes, and thus one ought to embrace and follow it. Yet I fear deviating from the former kings’ laws, where a hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand *li* of loss. Gazing at antiquity, I lament, my doubts unresolved. Thus, I look to the clouds in reverence, hesitating before the immortal’s chariot, sitting humbly in the lower seat, yearning for lofty instruction.

The reply: Discourses that probe the subtle and fathom the wondrous, debates that discern the obscure and discuss the mysterious—these must seek manifest principles, verifying them by tangible evidence. The ultimate principle transcends words, yet without words, its utmost cannot be conveyed. The supreme virtue is formless, yet without form, its existence cannot be proven. In form and word, how could there be no good and evil?

Calamity leans upon fortune, thus its signs are evident. Fortune harbors calamity, thus it has its master. With signs and a master, who would doubt it? The upright form does not summon the straight shadow, yet the straight shadow appears of itself. Harmonious sound does not chase the echo, yet the echo surely arrives. Interdependence and cyclical return—how could they lie in fixed allotment?

Thus, the sage establishes teachings to encourage goodness and punish evil, transforming evil to conceal goodness. The methods of transformation vary because human nature differs in purity and shallowness, and customs differ in flourishing and decline. When people are pure, excessive regulations are unnecessary; when customs are shallow, laws and decrees proliferate. Teachings adapt to the people, transformations follow the times. Thus, Taibo tattooed his body among the Eastern Yi, and Confucius lifted his robes among the Western naked tribes—these were not the grandest transformations of supreme virtue. Yet responding to change has its methods, and the principles of action and concealment lie in timing.

To broadly bestow upon the people and aid the multitude—how could this be called without merit? It is merely accomplishing deeds in accord with the people’s sentiments. If one preserves singular focus without deviation, then Heaven will be clear and Earth tranquil. This is the lofty aspiration of the enlightened, beyond the reach of mediocre talent.

The One is Orthodox Unity. Lord Zhang unified the world with Orthodox Unity. The eight extremities are without duality; the mysterious net is raised once, and the six directions share the same wind. Heaven covers, Earth bears, teaching and nurturing the Dao—without Orthodox Unity, how could one speak of its superiority or inferiority?

I am fortunate to encounter the great radiance of the vast current, unfolding transformation and revering the wind. The former sages savored the Dao, while I, a later generation, admire their chapters. My aspirations race like cloud ladders, my path to Heaven paved with plain silk. Years pass in leisurely emptiness, and each day I feel increasingly inadequate. I drink the dew from autumn pines, bear the spring fragrance of lotus marshes. Fish delight in deep waters, birds long for lush trees. I am but a branch in the forest, measuring my belly against the river. Yet my talent is short by a foot, my feelings not an inch long. My wisdom lacks profound understanding, my knowledge is not comprehensive insight. Carving a tube to reflect light—how could this repay the luminous instruction?

The challenge continued: The sage’s teachings make no distinction between self and other. Why then reject *Lingbao*, pure fasts, essential teachings, mud-and-ash repentance, and exorcism of evil?

The reply: The essential teachings, fasting methods, and mud-and-ash repentance rites all derive from a single scripture. How could the sage permit one to perform the Celestial Master’s repentance while neglecting the Celestial Master’s fasts? If the fasts could be omitted and the repentance substituted to fill a *Lingbao* deficiency, I fear not only would the Celestial Master not permit it, but it would deeply contradict Lord Ge’s intent. This is merely the desire of worldly scholars to cut the crane’s legs to fit the duck. Though one may wish for uniformity in length, they cannot be interchanged.

The challenge persisted: The mud-and-ash rite states: "All is as in the *Lingbao* method." Following this logic, could they be used interchangeably?

The reply: The mud-and-ash method exists because the karmic obstacles of sentient beings are profound and cannot be released without great merit. Deep-rooted karmic ties cannot be untangled without mud-and-ash to dissolve the knots of suffering. Without dissolution, one cannot achieve immortality or transcend worldly calamities. In the first year of *Han’an* (142 CE), on the fifteenth day of the tenth month, the Celestial Master descended with essential teachings at Mount Yangping, instructing the assembled officials to enter the register of immortals. Wang and Zhao practiced it and ultimately ascended the Dao. At that time, the mud-and-ash repentance was already in use, but the *Lingbao* fasting rituals had not yet spread—only the Five Talismans existed. How could they be practiced together? Examining the years and verifying the events makes it clear that this is erroneous. This is but a fabricated tributary, a forced interpretation of the true text. A few words seek to make the teachings of Lords Zhang and Ge identical in practice. When trust is insufficient, disbelief arises.

The challenge continued: I have heard some argue that the essential teachings were merely the Celestial Master’s method for governing officials. This is a lesser vehicle, unsuitable for *Lingbao* Daoists.

The reply: The Celestial Master stated: "I use this method to teach and govern officials and the people, delivering them from disaster and calamity, to become the seed people of later generations." How could the seed people forget the Daoists, and how could Daoists not include officials? If officials do not cultivate the seed people, how can they transcend the ten sufferings and eight difficulties? Without merit, nothing is achieved; if merit deviates from Orthodox Unity, virtue cannot be discussed. Those in office who plan rightly share the same goal as the noble person. To possess treasure yet remain lost in the state—this is a profound failure even a fool would avoid.

The challenge concluded: Methods that follow goodness must be adaptable, their use contingent on the times. The essential teachings and fasting methods, though authentic, are ancient and crude. Their simplicity and plainness make them unsuitable for grand observances.

The reply: [Omitted in the original text.]

The reply states: Trustworthy words are not ornate—this has always been so since antiquity. Ornate words are not trustworthy—this is the norm today. The ancients do not align with the present, as you have truly observed. If we have yet to discern what constitutes grand observance, how can we determine what is fitting? If what is fitting in my view contradicts others, a noble person, grounded in sincerity, must surely adapt to others—how could one uphold the principle of universal love? To observe the wondrous without desire, the heart returns to the profound ultimate. Yet scrutinizing the intent behind grand observance—could this not be the dregs of the sages? The greatest sound is soundless, yet not without sound. Thus, when the yang thunder stirs the submerged, even the lowliest creatures shed their shells. The greatest image is formless, yet not without form. Thus, the two modes of yin and yang cover and bear all, and all living things find what they depend upon and tread upon. The five phases harmonize with the wind, the four seasons shape custom. All things embrace yin and hold fast to yang, nurturing and fostering life. In mystery they reveal their essence; in vagueness they show their form. You existed before the Emperor; the Mother is the beginning without name. The master abandons the craft of words, relying instead on the teaching beyond names—only then can one embrace the One as the model. To display words and show form is to reveal the illness of not concealing the ultimate principle—this is the very illness. How could this be equated with inert vessels, with the likes of wood and stone, and be deemed equal to those who observe transformation?

The challenge states: According to what was said earlier, the Lingbao fast rituals originated with the Ge family, while the essential teachings of the fast methods came from the Heavenly Master. The Heavenly Master and the Ge family are separated by nearly a hundred years. Before the Ge family existed, there was already suffering—why then should Lingbao be introduced now? Reverently following the clear intent, I do not yet understand: were the teachings disseminated by the Ge family appropriate for use, or should they not be practiced?

The reply states: To govern with folded arms was the way of the great Yao; the ancient texts flourished brightly under the glorious Zhou. Why must we, for the sake of the unadorned purity of knotted cords, rashly dismiss the simplicity of written records? If the ancient is not present in the modern, then substance exists without refinement. If the modern is not rooted in the ancient, then substance is lost amid refinement.

I suspect you have cast me aside for clinging to the old, yet you now reject me for embracing the new. In essence, what you doubt is whether I have failed to balance refinement and substance. You ask: If the teachings of old and new ought to be practiced together, why do you now follow only the old and not the new? Your conduct contradicts your words—how can this be justified?

The reply: Fish and birds achieve different ends, each according to its nature. Those that soar and those that dive, those of river and those of land—heaven’s dispositions are not shared. The Five Constants are bestowed alike, yet some temperaments are firm, others yielding. My humble self is but a reed, crooked and swaying with the wind. Like water, I follow goodness as it flows, my heart forgetful of gain and loss, unmoved by favor or disgrace. My will abides in the Dao of Heaven, without regard for near or far. Yet how can I not be swayed by the many who emulate the new? Thus I remain attentive to the old teachings—why should this not mark me as one who, though born in this age, walks in the footsteps of the ancients?

You ask: The Heavenly Master, a great sage, established teachings to save all beings—why then are they now abandoned and unpracticed? Could it be that the Three Heavens’ laws hold the Orthodox Unity teachings in contempt, or that their transformative power lacks divine efficacy?

The reply: The superior person, upon hearing the Dao, puts it into practice—such were Wang Qiao and Chisong. The inferior person, upon hearing the Dao, laughs aloud—such are the dwellers of hills and valleys. If the supreme Dao is not practiced, is it not because the followers of Wang Qiao and Chisong are few, while the denizens of hills and valleys are many? Thus the phoenix and unicorn rarely appear and go unused, while chickens and horses fill the fields in constant motion. Is this not the reason the teachings remain unpracticed?

The course of things is like a whirlwind’s charge; the inclinations of men are like a sudden downpour’s pooling. Yet a whirlwind cannot last the morning, nor can a torrential rain endure the day. The Dao is hidden, nameless—who can name it? Great eloquence is like silence—who can debate it? Those who know me are few, and thus I am held in esteem. The frost-defying trunk does not wait for spring to change its hue; the resounding thunder needs no zither or bell to proclaim its sound. A net of ten thousand meshes catches but one bird; the spark from drilling tinder rises without warning. Why must one cling to mere mortals or seek the dazzling glow of worldly splendor?

"Cut off sageliness, abandon wisdom, and the people benefit a hundredfold. Cut off benevolence, abandon righteousness, and the people return to filial piety and compassion. Cut off skill, abandon profit, and thieves and robbers vanish." Heaven’s transformative care nurtures all; the great sage’s boundless virtue preserves life and aids beings. How could one exalt wisdom and cast aside sageliness, forsaking virtue for the sake of compassionate listeners? This is not the way of the supreme Dao.

What the supreme Dao embraces is this: to guide the heart to the vast heavens above, to offer one’s resolve to the halls of the Pure Capital, to conceal one’s traces at the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, to send the mind into the boundless mystery of mysteries. To rest in the morning sun and cast one’s shadow, to shelter beneath the great void and spread the emptiness. To bow to the August Void and fulfill one’s nature, to follow the secret traces of the Mysterious and the Old. To wear orchids and thoroughwort, sharing their fragrance, to esteem pine and cassia, transforming one’s countenance. To entrust sincerity to the blue mist, to leave loyalty shining in the white sun. To remain untroubled by the changing customs, for virtue alone can shift the winds. To summon good friends from the Eastern Flower Capital, to rebuke wayward spirits at the Northern Feng. What in this is contemptible about the Orthodox Unity?

Perhaps you are not yet free of confusion—may you, my friend, suddenly awaken, as if bathed in sunlight at midnight!

The *Orthodox Unity Treatise* concludes.
