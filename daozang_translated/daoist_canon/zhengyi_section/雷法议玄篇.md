**"The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method**
*Composed by Master Yuan Lu, the True Teacher of the Ten Thousand Schools*

**Scripture Title:** *The Mysterious Treatise on Thunder Method*
*Composed by Master Yuan Lu and others of the Song Dynasty*
*One scroll*
*Source text: The Orthodox Daoist Canon (正统道藏), Canon One (正一部)*

In days past, I encountered my Master upon the Dragon Mountain heights, by the banks of the Fragrant Stream. There, I heard the teachings of the **Hun Yuan Tai Yi Dao**—the sacred texts of the Five Thunders to subdue malevolence. These were compiled into twenty-four sections, divided into three volumes—upper, middle, and lower. Within them were over two hundred chapters of talismans, diagrams, seals, incantations, and ritual formulas. The swift ascents, the footing of the cosmic dance, the structuring of seals and inscriptions—how could one enumerate their full scope?

After repeated study, I told my Master: *"This is the very source of the Dao’s boundless sea!"*

I had heard that the **Dao supreme is unencumbered**, and the **Law most concise**. Though these sacred texts are vast, even a balding scholar like me could not transcribe them fully.

The Master said: *"You may swear by Heaven before I impart the swift and wondrous method."*

The disciple replied: *"If Your Benevolence grants me the profound mysteries of the Primordial Mysterious, I would cut flesh as incense and sever my hair as an oath—what fear could I have?"*

Then, from his hidden satchel, the Master produced a small volume and, swearing by Heaven, transmitted it to me. The talismans, seals, incantations, and formulas—no more than thirty chapters—were all to be committed to heart by memory.

The Master said: *"The most profound is the most simple; its wonder lies in these words."*

And further: *"Have you heard of the Thirty-Six Celestial Powers?"*

Speaking of the **Dao supreme**, the **Qian Yuan Zhen Yi**—*Qian* being Yang, the **Dan Ling Zhen Yi qi**—when **Yuan Shi** first manifested his transformation, the **Pi Luo** condensed into boundless vastness. It took form as pavilions, as gates, as palaces, as halls—**thirty-six qi** coalescing into Heaven. Heaven is the progenitor of all things; thus, it takes form from Heaven, and its visage from the Dao.

How much more so for those who cultivate the True Way, seeking immortality and longevity, to align with Heaven’s years! Without mastering the **Thirty-Six Qi’s mysteries**, how could one harmonize with the Dao, ride the dragons, and wield the lightning?

Upon hearing this, I understood how the Dao’s creation and the Law’s orchestration converge in singular principle.

As for the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, arrayed in the Four Directions, they are the **True Sovereign’s Great Emperor’s** grand deployment. The **Yellow Court’s Inner Palace**, with its **six times six**—the **Central Dipper’s Great Marshal** overseeing all spirits—assists the Celestial Sovereign’s transformations, governs cosmic cycles, and wields supreme authority. Within, the **Spiritual Officers and Ministers** hold their ranks, heeding the True Sovereign’s commands.

Take, for instance: the **Ji Star** commands the wind, the **Bi Star** the rain, the **Mao Star** the clear skies, the **Xu and Wei Stars** the snow. The **Wo Constellation** governs the thunder. The winds, rains, snows, hail, lightning, and thunderclaps—each has its master.

The **Wei Star’s radiance**, the **Mighty Generals’ poisoned thunders**—all reside within the **Thirty-Six Vajra Qi**, beneath the **One Hundred Seventy-Nine Stars**, which are the **Chief Stars** overseeing all. The **Great Vajra’s authority** is foremost; what deity could resist?

Though the **Thunder God** is fierce, all obey his command. Alongside the **Celestial Stars’ brilliance**, the **Swift Generals and Mighty Spirits**, they move with the qi in ceaseless rotation, day and night.

For their movements have measure, their halts have order. Without knowing these measures, how could one achieve response?

Only those who penetrate the **darkest mysteries**, who grasp the **Dao’s most hidden mechanisms**, could comprehend the **Wei Star’s radiance** and its movements.

For instance, on **Jia-Yi days at Wu-hour**, when praying for rain—where does the **Bi Star** reside? Even if one knows its precise location, how would one **command and subdue** it?

Thus, the military treatise *The Theory of Elusive Armies* states: *"First, clarify the True Numbers of Tai Yi, to observe the stars’ auspicious and inauspicious omens. In battle, one must open the **Gate of Rest and Life** to secure the Dao’s path."*

For example, on **Bing-Ding days at Wei-hour**, where are the **Gate of Rest and Life**? Those who grasp this decide victories a thousand *li* away; those who falter cannot move a single step.

As for **Yin-Yang Wind-Water** masters selecting years and months for construction—sages who discern auspiciousness avoid calamity, while those who perceive the **auspicious stars** bring blessings and prosperity.

This is the **secret knowledge of stellar mechanisms**, the **divine application of mysteries**—all distilled into one grasp. How could it be in vain display or verbose ritual?

Thus, my Master, **Lord Wang Gong**, who served at the **Divine Court’s side**, once moved the **wind and rain at the Emperor’s command**. This was no mere trick of the hand—what else could it be?

Truly, its efficacy was proven time and again.

The practitioners of Dao must first comprehend the **Yin-Yang stellar killings**, the **convergence and collision of qi**, and delve into the **intimate mechanisms of the Supreme Sovereign** and the **Primordial Emperor’s jade decrees** before any efficacy can be achieved.

Thus, the **thunderous mechanisms of transformation** surpass all ancient and modern arts. The **exiled immortals** of past dynasties merely passed this knowledge by word of mouth, unable to record it in writing.

Therefore, the **Supreme Secret Precepts** state:
*"Loosen the hair, tread the *Gang* lines to seek the killing qi,
Brandish the sword’s tip to ignite the fire and reveal the **True Scripture**."*
This is called the **True Scripture**.

It was when the **True King of the Sovereign** existed before the **Ming Hun** had yet to divide, in the **Flying Mysterious Realm** above, that he spread the **Buddha-qi** across the **Azure Sky and Purple Milky Way**, forming **Dragon Script and Phoenix Seals**, their radiance illuminating the **Four Directions**, shaking the **Six Extremes**. Then, he commanded the **Celestial Sovereign True Person** to follow the pattern and write the **Scripture**.

The **Primordial Emperor** at the **Dragon Yang Bright Palace** bestowed it upon the True King, while the rest was sealed and stored in the **Dragon Palace’s Ocean Treasury**, eternally governing the world. The **Law’s decrees** are countless in stages, but **Thunder** is the swiftest among them.

Yet, later disciples—with lofty hearts and sharp qi, but shallow practice and frivolous words—though they encounter a true master, who among them can truly fathom its mysteries? Thus, they have never heard of the **palm’s essential strategies**, nor have they ever seen the **True Scripture** on the blade. Their efforts yield little, their responses are ineffectual, and they abandon the path midway, blaming the Dao and their teachers. This is the fault of those who misdeliver the method, harming later disciples.

How could they not realize that without penetrating the **Law’s source**, they merely receive the **true teacher’s transmission**? Those who possess the **worldly-transmitted Fire-True Form** and **Thunder Lord’s True Aspect** only compound errors in myriad ways, confusing the **Primordial Truth**. Not only do they fail to achieve results in their own time, but they also invite ridicule from both humans and spirits.

As for the **Great Incantation of the Woodly Lord**, even those who fully possess it still find it wondrous. Even if they do, how could they craft the **secret essence of the Talisman’s transformation**? Moreover, they do not understand the **first phrase of the mechanism**: *"The Heavenly Luster shines over the Jade Pool in the East."* This phrase is inscribed between the **Thunder Lord’s crown and soles**; how could one arrange the seal upon it?

As for the **Thunder Lord’s Sacred Image**, the **Sudden Fire True Form**, straddling a dragon below, holding a mallet in hand—each word is a transformation, each character clear and structured. The rest of the talismans are largely like this.

For instance, when establishing an altar to pray for rain, if the **Dragon Pool** is a hundred *li* away from the altar, one must use the **Inverted Sea Talisman** and personally deliver it. Even if there is efficacy, it is already the **second mechanism**.

But my true master was not so. First, on the **Mysterious Altar**, he summoned the **Functionary Official** with a talisman. When the official arrived, he presented a talisman to summon the **Thunder Lord** of a certain place. When the Thunder Lord arrived, he held a talisman to summon the **Dragon Spirit** of a certain place. When the Dragon Spirit arrived, the winds arose, clouds gathered, lightning flashed, and thunder roared—all according to the method. With a single command, rain fell immediately. This method is said to be **most wondrous**, yet my master still considered it **verbose ritual**, not the most immediate response.

When I encountered a plea for rain, I merely inscribed a talisman on an **iron strip**, struck it, and cast it toward the **Bi Constellation**. According to the precept, it flew and presented itself—with a single command, rain fell. This is truly **most profound and wondrous**.

As for the method of **striking and subduing evil shrines**, the response should be immediate. My master’s precepts state:
*"When calamities plague life and death, and the crime warrants destruction, first locate the **Golden Tiger Great Killing** and the **Fiery Malevolent Star** among the **Twenty-Four Positions**. Determine where they fall today, this month, and this hour. Once the direction is fixed, use the **Thunder-Fire Talisman** to incite it. That star belongs to **Metal**, this talisman to **Fire**—Metal and Fire counteract each other, and the evil shrine is immediately destroyed."*

Ah! The **Heavenly Treasures and Mysterious Decrees**—jewel-like and secret. If one does not encounter a **strange adept** who personally transmits the **true master’s oral precepts**, one will spend a lifetime in vain pursuit.

Even ordinary practitioners who summon thunder must first report to the **Supreme Sovereign**, then seek retribution, and only then act. Generally, **driving away evil, curing diseases, dispelling poison, and subduing demons** is like **rescuing a burning head**. If one waits for the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, how is it like **harmonizing sounds for aid**, taking slow steps to extinguish flames? How could one wait so long?

Thus, the **True King’s teachings** say:
*"The **Thunderous Jade Treasury** is the domain of the **Five Thunder Departments**, which, under the **Supreme Sovereign’s command**, reward the good and punish the evil, acting with **convenient authority**."*

Therefore, my master, **Lord Wang Tai-Su**, obtained the **True King’s principle of convenient authority**. Only those with **numinous bones** could encounter him, and only those of **ferocious loyalty and filial piety** could uphold it. Moreover, mastering even one aspect of the **Law** is the swiftest path to **perfecting the Dao**. Without **divine completeness**, how could one command ghosts and spirits to save the critically ill?

Thus, the **Ancestral Master**, with the **Primordial One’s true qi**, transformed into the **Countless Great Generals**, annihilating the **Six Heavenly Demons**, accumulating merit and virtue, and ascending to the **Golden Gate of the Celestial Court**.

Therefore, those who practice the Dao must not **create false forms that return to ruin**, must not **accumulate negative merit and fail to reach the Mysterious Realm**, must not **refine essence and spirit without purity and joy**, and must not **save the suffering without achieving Daoist fruition**.

All who seek immortality and the Dao must **serve the nation and save the people, promote benefits and eliminate harm, be upright and intelligent, diligent in incense and offerings, atone for the sins of the Nine Mysterious and Seven Ancestral Teachers, and absolve the offenses of a thousand kalpas and a hundred ages**. If fortunate enough to encounter teachers and friends, do not betray their trust—**ascension awaits**. If one violates the **Mysterious Laws**, one will sink into the **Sea of Suffering**. Devote oneself wholeheartedly, and the responses will come like echoes. Later disciples, do not neglect this.

The **Thunder Method’s profound ocean** is now fully expounded.

In ancient times, practitioners of the Dao **moved things with their hearts** and **governed evil with righteousness**. A righteous heart made all spirits responsive, and a pure body drove away all evils. As time passed, the **original teachings degenerated**, and thus **doctrines and methods were established to subdue ghosts**, using **talismans and techniques to summon spirits**.

The **Thunder**—this phenomenon—is indeed the **Heavenly Command**, the convergence of the **Yin-Yang dual qi**. When still, it rests; when stirred, it roars. Born in the **Zhen Constellation**, arising from the **Xun Gate**, it does not strike unless its time comes, with **Divine Agents** overseeing it.

Yet among those who follow the **Dao**, some **invoke Thunder by law**, others **borrow Thunder by law**—truly, their claims may well be seen as **earthshaking and world-upsetting**. Now, as for the **True Performance Method**—where did its doctrine originate? Ah, I know it well.

With **upright heart and sincere intent**, one aligns with **Heaven’s Way**, its depths unfathomable, vast as the sea. It unfurls the **True Dao** endlessly. Yet this alone does not reach the **Mystic Primordial’s subtlety** or grasp the **profound mechanisms**—it is insufficient to speak of this.

Now, there are those who, through long practice of the **Supreme Law**, universally benefit the common folk. When they encounter a **Guiding Master** and receive the **rightful principles**, they act as **Heaven’s emissaries**, spreading the **True Teaching’s wind**. They grasp the **ancients’ intent** of **upright heart and divine resonance**, and with **Flying Gang and Treading Dou**, sealing seals and inscribing talismans—

When the **heart’s incense burns**, when the **heart’s talisman glows**, their **commands resound**, and **ten thousand spirits obey**. They pinpoint the **Thunder Constellation’s alignment**, master the **Rain Master’s control**, and with a single **summons**, Thunder crashes; with a single **shout**, Rain arrives—**this calls, that responds**, as echoes do.

Yet those who **casually invoke Thunder**, failing to fathom its **maneuvering subtleties** or grasp its **summoning origins**, often cling to the **ancients’ husks**, recklessly discussing the **Dao’s profound depths**. Their **words contradict their deeds**, their **heart drifts with things**, eyes bulging, mouths gaping—**hollow shouts in panic**, yet **no response comes**. The gap between them and true mastery is **ten thousand leagues**.

As for the **Fire Master Wang Ruogu**, he **acted with True Sovereign authority**, barking commands that **Thunder and Lightning obeyed**, issuing decrees that **winds and rains answered**. He **preserved the Supreme Primordial’s essence**, **maintained the Pure and Substantial**, served **Heaven with fasting and purity**, and with **utter sincerity** moved **ghosts and spirits**. His **commands were precise**, his **rewards and punishments unerring**, his **demeanor reverent and harmonious**—**silently attuned to the Dao**, he **assisted Heaven in its transformations**, **aided the nation in its salvation**. Truly, who could say he fell short?

Now, to **unfold the True Performance’s transformation**, one must first **transmit its authentic texts**. This is not merely for **superficial display**, but to **set a model for later disciples**. I dare not hoard it, thus I **engrave and print** this work to **broaden its dissemination**. May all **kindred spirits** not **neglect it with idle ears**.

In the **Song Dynasty’s Chunyou Eighth Year, Second Month, on the True Primordial Festival**, Ruogu of the **Hidden Valley** composed *On Invoking Thunder by Law*—the world praised it, yet few truly **grasped its mysteries**.

For the **True Performance’s work** is not for the **shallow-minded** to comprehend. Not only must one **speak of it**, but one must **wield it**—thus I do not withhold it.

「Indeed, this is a great supplement for the future—no small benefit.

When the Great Primordial (*Dàpò*) had not yet dispersed, **Yin** and **Yang** began to sprout.
Once the Two Principles (*Liǎngyí*) were established, the Eight Trigrams (*Bāguà*) were formed.
**Thunder (Zhèn)** and **Wind (Xuān)** govern the winds and the peals.
Through **Water (shuǐ)** it transforms, by **Fire (huǒ)** it clarifies.
In **self-return (zìfù)**, it grows mighty—granting honor to the withered.
Above, it drives the **Celestial Mandate (tiān hào)**, below, it shapes the **physical forms (wù xíng)**.
Who commands this power, to **summon at the proper time (yù)?
It emerges from the **Earth’s Gate (dì hù)**, reaching the **Imperial Court (dì tíng)**.
The **Pivot Hall (shū tái)** holds dominion, the **Daoist Essence (fán qì)** coalesces.
One, nine, yet three—its **numerical origin (shù zhào)** stems from **Jade Purity (Yùqīng)**.
All belong to the **Divine Tao’s Realm (Shénxiāo)**, fully recorded in the **Yü’s Classic (Yǔ Jīng)**.
By **Law (fǎ)**, it moves—none of its actions are trivial.

Indeed, in ancient times, the teachings were passed down until the present.
Only the **most profound words (cí zhì xuān)** can restore the depths of obscurity.
As the world declined into vulgarity and thinness (*shì jiàng sú bó*), false and private doctrines arose.
They claim to be the **orthodox lineage (zōng tán)**, yet presumptuously **seize the Daoist ranks (xiān qīng)**.
Ask of their practices—none match their empty names.
Through **erroneous transmission (wú)**, they receive more errors, **summoning disasters (jiā) and conscripting spirits (yì bīng)**.
What they call **subtle and mysterious (wēimiào)**, is like the deaf hearing sounds—
Even if some claim to know, their minds are **distracted and restless (tā xīn yíng yíng)**.
The **Heaven fears this Dao (tiān kǒng sī dào)** may be lost to oblivion,
Thus it entrusts its continuation to the **Pure White Field Master (Chúnbái Tián Jūn)**,
And to the **Silent Cultivator of the Yellow Court (hē xiū Huáng Tíng)**.
The **forebearers of enlightenment (xiān jué zhī tú)** and the **heroes of later generations (hòu jìn zhī yīng)**,
With the **Purple Sovereign’s secret keys (Zǐhuáng mì jué)**, may **walk the straight path (zhí xíng)**.
They **delve into the primordial source (dòng jiū yuán běn)**, never **yielding to fame or gain (fú xún lì míng)**.
Out of **compassion for the common folk (jiù sú wéi niàn)**, they **preserve and refine their practices (chí xí yán jīng)**.
Gazing downward at the **Five Directions (wǔ fāng)**, upward at the **celestial constellations (liè xīng)**,
They **grasp the essential threads (hóng lǐng yào kuò)** and **guide transformations without pause (wǔ xuán bù tíng)**.
Praying for **clear skies (qí qíng)**, they receive **immediate response (xiàng yìng)**;
Testing **cures (kǎo zhì)**, they bring **peace to ailments (huàn níng)**.
They do not seek **private virtue (dú shàn)**, but **guide and nurture allies (yòu yè tóng méng)**.
The *True Performance’s* writings **reveal the path to spiritual awakening (dá líng)**—
The **Law of Invoking Thunder (yùn léi zhī fǎ)** **unveils the ignorant and blind (huò kāi yū máng)**.
It should be **ranked with the Kings and Xue (Wáng Xuē)**, **listed among the Jade Capital’s worthies (Yáo Jīng)**.
Those who **seek its true intent (néng qiú zhǐ qù)**, the **empty will be filled (xū zhě bì yíng)**.

I observed its text and **uttered three sighs of astonishment (sān tàn shèn jīng)**.
Its **thoroughness and clarity (shū qí bàn qià)**—how could praise be **too excessive (yù cí zhì qíng)**?
A great supplement for the future, its fragrance will endure for **a hundred generations (bǎi shì fāng xīn)**.
It flows with the **Law (fǎ)**, like **cinnabar (dān)** and **emerald (qīng)**.
Words cannot fully express its meaning—thus I **compose this eulogy (zàn ér lè míng)**.

**Ode to Jade Purity (Yùqīng yín zēng shí àn xiānshēng):**
Who among the Jade Purity lineage truly understands?
The **Primordial Mechanism’s hidden depths (yuán jī yǐn ào)** are hard to trace.
How few stages remain of its **heart-transmitted marvelous Law (miào fǎ xīn chuán cún)**—
Even the **Eight Vehicles’ scholars (Bāshèng xuéshì)** know little of its resonance.

The **Thunder King’s true form (Chìtiān Dūléi shèng xiàng)** belongs to the **True Sovereign (Zhēn Wáng)**,
The **Sudden Fire Marshal (Hūhuǒ Dàjiàng)** resides in the **Hall of the Immortal (shè fáng)**.
The **Second and Third Heavens (chǒu wèi èr gōng)** hold **some minor mysteries (xiē’ér miào)**,
The **Second and Third Marshals (wèi niú èr jiàng)** serve the **Master beside (shì shī bàng)**.
This Law is **rarely known in the world (liú chuán shì hǎn zhī)**—
Heaven fears this Dao may **soon collapse (jiāng qīng cuī)**.
The **Jade Treasury’s exiled immortal (Yù fǔ zhé xiān)**—Master Éng (Éng Zhēnshì),
**Personally entrusted (qīn fù)** the **transformation’s mechanism (zào huà jī)** to **Master Hé (Hé Jūn)**.
Master Hé, having **mastered the Great Law (dà fǎ)**,
Never strays from the **Ten Revolutions of the Circulating Heaven (Zhōutiān yī shí bā)**.
He **summons rain and clears skies by voice (qí qíng dǎo yǔ yìng shēng shēng)**,
**Gathers and dispatches them back to feast beneath the moon (shōu shí guī lái fàn míng yuè)**.
He **commands the chamber to radiate brilliance (zuò lìng mǎn shì guāng huī shēng)**,
The **Primordial Pearl pierces straight through the Kunlun Mountains (yuán zhū zhí tòu gōng Kūnlún)**.
Within, a **babe holds the divine transformation (yīng’ér wò shén huà)**,
**Riding a Fire Dragon to pay homage to the Celestial Master (jià gè huǒ lóng yè Dì Jūn)**.

**Detailed Exposition on the Sudden Fire True Form:**
The **Venerable Master (Zōngshī)** of the *Discourse on the Mysterious (Yì Xuán Piān)* states:
The **traditionally transmitted Sudden Fire True Form (qīn huǒ zhēn xíng)**,
The **Thunder King’s talismans (Léi Gōng dān zhuàn)**,
Are indeed **utterly erroneous and manifold in deception (shí wéi kuí wú wàn zhuàng)**,
**Excessively chaotic with no order (fán luàn wú guī)**.
Not only are they **ineffective in the present (wú xiào yú qiánmiàn)**,
But they **invite mockery from the spirits (shēn yǒu qǔ xiào yú shén guǐ)**.
For instance, the **Great Incantation of the Wood Marshal (Mù Láng Dà zhòu)**—
Even if a **Daoist adept (fǎ jiā)** obtains its entirety, it is still wondrous yet flawed.
Even if one **acquires its fullness (zòng dé qí bèi)**,
How could this incantation **serve as a means of transformation (zào huà)**?
Its first line reads: *“The Heavenly Crystal flows radiance in the Eastern Pool of Jade (Qián jīng liú huī yù chí dōng).”*
This single line, **between the Thunder King’s crown and heel (tīng zuǎn jiān)**,
Is **written with a stroke to generate its form (xià bǐ shēng chéng)**.
What is the **Thunder King’s sacred visage (shèng xiàng)**?
What is the **Sudden Fire True Form (huǒ zhēn xíng)**?
By **invoking its essence (dān zhuàn)**,
It **manifests beneath the Dragon Seat (kuà lóng zuò xià)**,
**Wielding the Hammer in hand (zhí chuí shǒu zhōng)**.
Each line **clearly delineates the path of transformation (zào huà fēn míng)**,
Each character **forms with deliberate structure (zì zì shēng chéng yǒu gé)**—
Other **authentic talismans and grand methods (zhēn zhuàn dà kuò)** are like this, as well.

Since my youth (*crown year, guān nián*), after **studying the profound theories of the *Discourse on the Mysterious* (Yì Xuán Piān zhī ào lùn)**,
I **diligently sought and inquired (zì zì cān fǎng, kǔ zhì xún qiú)**,
Though I **repeatedly received guidance from teachers and peers (suī lèi méng shī yǒu zhǐ jiào)**,
I **never aligned with the ancients’ intent (zhōng wèi hé xiān xiān zhī zōng zhǐ)**.
In the **year *Gěngchǒu* (gěngchǒu)**, while **dwelling in Jinling (Jīnlíng)**,
I **suddenly encountered a marvel (yǒu yì yù)**—
The **secret canon (mì diǎn)** of Master Zēng (Zēngshī) from the **Yuanfēng era (Yuánfēng nián jiàn)**.

His family **treasured it across three generations (sān shì)**,
Daring not to **disturb it recklessly (màng dòng)**—
Even a **mistaken brush against its dust (wù shì fú qí chén)** would **bring calamity (zāi bàn suí zhì)**,
For it **awaits a destined one (yǒu suǒ dài ér rán)**.
When I **received it (shòu zhī)**, I **burned incense and opened the scroll (fén xiāng kāi juàn)**,
Its opening words: *“The Sudden Fire True Form, the Thunder King’s sacred visage—
The **method of generating and transforming divine power (shēngchéng biànhuà zhī dào)**,”*
Dispelled all **lifelong doubts (píngshēng suǒ yí, dùnrán bīng xiè)**—
**Practicing it indeed bore strange and wondrous results (xíng zhī guǒ yǒu qí yàn)**.
Later, I **taught a few successors (shì fǎ)**—
Yet none **truly grasped it (dé rén)**.
Now, as I **approach old age (jiāng lǎo)**,
If I **do not transmit it (bù chuán)**, the **Heavenly Dao may be lost (mì tiān dào)**;
If I **transmit it (chuán zhī)**, it is **difficult to choose a worthy recipient (nán yú zé rén)**.
Since the **expository treatise (xiáng lùn zhī shū)** is complete,
I also **reveal a few genuine keys (lù zhēn jī yī èr)**,
To **guide those who follow (shì jiāng lái)**—
Thus they may **trace the source from its stream (xún liú zhī yuán)**,
And **avoid being lost in obscurity (miǎn yān chén yú mì diǎn)**.

In **practicing and upholding (fán xíng chí)**,
First, **one must cultivate the Primordial Ancestral Essence (xiān tiān zǔ qì)**,
And **refine the Qi of one’s mortal body (diǎn huà yī shēn fán tāi zhī qì)**.
This **Primordial Ancestral Essence (xiān tiān zǔ qì)**,
Is the **root of the Great Dao of Chaos (Hóngméng dà dào zhī běn)**—
It must be **sought before the division of the undifferentiated (hùn duàn wèi fēn yǐ qián)**,
For all **ten thousand Laws and myriad gates (wàn fǎ qiān mén)** begin here.
It is **not the turbid and impure Qi (huì zhuó zhī qì)** produced after **Parental union (fù mǔ gōng jīng yǐ hòu)**—
This was **detailed in the previous exposition (qián piān xiáng lùn zhī)**.

Once **the Ancestral Essence is obtained and infused into the body (dé zǔ qì rù shēn diǎn huà fán zhuó)**,
Then **one may practice and uphold (rán hòu kě yǐ xíng chí)**.
In **inscribing talismans and casting spells (fán shū fū)**,
First, **one must calculate the auspicious time (shēng wàng)**,
Then, **enter the Chamber of Calmness (jìng shì)** to **summon Thunder and Peals (lèng chào léi tíng)**.
Ten thousand spirits **assemble and abide (lián zhù)**, filling the cosmos—
**Naturally, the heavens darken and the earth’s Qi churns (tiān hūn dì qì)**.
As **the two Essences rise and fall (èr qì shēng jiàng)**,
Only then does **the form conceal and the body transform (zàng xíng biàn tǐ)**.
The **Five Essences interact (wǔ qì xiāng shēng)**—
One **generates from one (yī shēng yī)**, and the **sacred embryo forms (shèng tāi jié jiù)**.
Practice the **Ten Revolutions of the Returning Soul’s supreme path (shàng dào)**,
Uniting the **Nine Heavens’ divine mechanism (xiān jī shēng shén huán jī)**,
Next, **deploy the Ancestral Essence within the Three Scenes and the Great Void (sān jǐng tài kōng zhī zhōng)**,
**Generate the Mysterious Female (Xuán pǐ)** at the **Primordial Soil’s position (xiān tiān zhēn tǔ zhī wèi)**,
**Circulate the Primordial Essence of the Yellow Performance (yuán xiān yī huáng yǎn zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its vital thread (jiān qí bāo mìng)**,
**Unbinding and returning to the root (jiě jié huí gēn)**.
Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Dark and Mysterious Purple Gate (yuán dòng míng zǐ hù zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its embryonic vital thread (jiān qí tāi mìng)**.
Finally, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Long-Living Illuminated Immortal (yuán chánglíng míng xiān zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its spiritual vital thread (jiān qí hún mìng)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Radiant Corpse of the Dark and Mysterious Yellow Gate (yuán yáng shī míng yǎn yóu zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its vital thread of the spirit (jiān qí pò mìng)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Five Immortals’ Central Spirit (yuán wǔ xiān zhōng líng zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its zang-fu (organs and viscera)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Highest True and Penetrating Fusion (yuán gāo zhēn chōng róng zhī hēi qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its spiritual chamber (jiān qí líng fǔ)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Highest Immortal’s Mysterious Hollowed Bag (yuán gāo xiān dòng jié zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its primordial chamber (jiān qí yuán fǔ)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the True and Transformed Central Spirit (yuán zhēn huà níng zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its flowered chamber (jiān qí huá fǔ)**.

Next, **circulate the Primordial Essence of the Natural Mysterious Illumination (yuán zìrán xuán zhào zhī qì)** ninefold,
**Enfolding its jade chamber (jiān qí yuè fǔ)**.

Thus completing the **ninefold ninefold eighty-onefold** numbers,
**Generating the five zang and six fu, the three passes and nine palaces,**
**All hundred spirits fully assembled within.**

**Circulate the Heavenly Crystal (qián jīng)** at the two eyes below,
**And inscribe:** *"The Heavenly Crystal flows with radiant splendor into the Jade Pool of the East."*

**The nose is the mountain peaks, hence it is said:** *"The Wood Official, Great Unity of the Three Mountains, stands proud."*

**The hands grasp an axe, hence it is said:** *"The Golden Hammer and Jade Axe blaze within the Celestial Palace."*

**One hand holds the Thunder Drill, hence it is said:** *"The clap of thunder shatters stone, making the Spring Source flow."*

**Inscribe the two feet, desiring their broad circulation of divine power,**
**To shake mountains and roll seas, ascending and descending yin and yang, hence it is said:**
*"Guan Bo shakes the Kunlun Peak, while the Mysterious Dragon churns the seas—both act in harmony with the Dark Void."*

**Inscribe the claws to sharpen them, hence it is said:**
*"Huang Li wields the sword, slaying the chi (ten-headed serpent)."*

**Then summon the celestial thunders—Heavenly Thunder, Divine Thunder, Dragon Thunder, Water Thunder, and the Thunder of the Soil Order—**
**To beat and surge forth as two wings, hence it is said:**
*"Dual flapping flies through the Great Void."*

**Inscribe the circular light to lead as a vanguard, blazing and illuminating, hence it is said:**
*"Great Unity moves swiftly, first repelling evil."*

**The circular light dazzles and terrifies, piercing the sacred form, hence it is said:**
*"The Crimson Feathered Giant Wings and Vermilion Eyes shine forth."*

**Above the circular light, inscribe the Threefold Fire Radiance, hence it is said:**
*"The Thunder Light bursts into the void, a crimson fire blazing."*

**And so with the flying dragons beneath the seat, their marvelous essence likewise,**
**From head to tail, every phrase resonates with the Creative Transformations.**

**For instance, the four feet: summon the Five Sacred Peaks and the Four Soil Order Thunders,**
**As well as the Primordial Five Generals, distributing true might to aid the vanguard—**
**How could mere trifling talismans and shallow transformations compare?**

**When the talisman is inscribed, immediately circulate the True Water and True Fire,**
**Detaching the embryo and giving rise to transformations, splitting form and altering essence,**
**Drawing all into the talisman.**

**Then one sees Fire Spirits flapping their wings, Divine Dragons roaring and soaring through the cosmos,**
**Churning the seas and mountains, all Thunder Spirits following in readiness to act as needed.**

**I stand at the high altar, directing the Creative Transformations,**
**Urging and commanding with divine authority—**
**In moments, winds arise and clouds gather, lightning flashes and thunder crashes,**
**Sweet rains descend in response.**

**If performing prayers for drought relief or snow invocation,**
**Or truly exorcising demons,**
**All manner of rituals cannot dispense with this sacred talisman of True Form,**
**Which is the essence and foundation of the Primordial Dao’s great method.**

**The Wood Official Great Incantation contains ninety-seven verses of transformation,**
**Each clearly defined.**
**If one grasps its mystery, all schools of Thunder Dao can be harnessed—**
**Where could one go and fail?**

**Students must study this deeply.**

**The Great Ultimate Thunder Altar Rites for the Four Cardinal Spirits**
**On the fifth day of the fifth month,**
**Use a yellow silk cloth of one chi two inches.**
**As prescribed, inscribe the talisman of the Red Rooster and Purple Goose,**
**Burn incense and recite the Wood Official Incantation a hundred times,**
**Then submerge the talisman in the northeastern waters.**

**Return to the Pure Chamber, set up four positions of blood offerings,**
**Presenting libations of wine to venerate the Jade Thunder and Radiant Master,**
**And the four spirits.**
**Offer wine, and the forms of the rooster and goose appear.**
**Next, the divine forms manifest,**
**And whatever is prayed for is realized.**
**For years of drought and scarcity,**
**Pray and the response comes immediately.**

*The Scripture of the Five Thunders* states:
**These four spirits are the water essence of the Great Beginning’s chaotic brilliance.**
**The Great Yu tamed the floods, commanding them to settle the four cardinal directions.**
**It is also said that they are the essence of the Eight Trigrams,**

**One can surely summon clouds and rains at will.**
