**The Supreme Venerable Sovereign’s Scripture of Great Simplicity**

Great Simplicity, radiant and bright, is named the Dao.
In the time of Great Simplicity, spirits came to cultivate it, and the Dao thus gave it life.
Having given it life and form, the Dao then endowed it with destiny, and the Dao brought it to completion.
Thus, heaven and earth took shape, and the Dao and virtue became scripture.

No Dao is greater than spontaneity; no virtue is greater than longevity.
The Dao gives birth to the One, the One gives birth to the Two, the Two gives birth to the Three, and the Three gives birth to heaven and earth.
Heaven and earth fill to abundance, and when full, they diminish; when diminished, they return to their root.
Thus, the One of heaven covers all without exception; the One of earth bears all without exception; the One of sun and moon illuminates all without exception.

Therefore, to know the One is to be without knowledge.
To not unify the One is to have no knowledge of the One.
The Dao’s marvel lies in this: the worthy comprehend it, the sages practice it—it cannot be left unknown.

The Dao is vast yet formless, concealed yet nameless.
That which lies beyond heaven and earth is profound and obscure; that which lies within heaven and earth is full and flourishing.
Thus, between heaven and earth, the Dao is complete—it is not mine alone. The Dao does not desire; it is not mine to differ.

It is further said:
Life may be hoped for; death may be feared.
The roots of plants and trees live, yet they die when removed from the earth.
Fish and turtles live submerged, yet they die when removed from water.
Humans live through form, yet they die when qi departs.
Thus, the sage knows where qi resides and treasures it as the body’s essence.

It is further said:
The great Dao unfolds the greatest efficacy under heaven; the great scripture sets forth the greatest strategy under heaven—this is sufficient for the great person.
What others cherish, I regard as peril; what others cling to, I relinquish.
Only the sage understands the reason for these two.

It is further said:
Great virtue endures the greatest adversity under heaven; the great person bears the greatest humiliation under heaven.
One who can endure the greatest adversity under heaven may consume the most honored emoluments under heaven;
one who can bear the greatest humiliation under heaven may become uniquely noble under heaven.

It is further said:
The heart in humans is like water in a vessel:
when still, it is level; when disturbed, it spills; when agitated, it turns turbid; when settled, it becomes clear.
Is governing the heart not like water?
When dammed, it halts; when unobstructed, it flows; if breached to the west, it flows west; if breached to the east, it flows east.
The human heart cannot be left unchecked, just as water cannot be left without embankments.

It is further said:
Thus, the *Yijing* speaks of the Supreme Ultimate.
The Supreme Ultimate is called the Supreme Change.

The *Taiyi* is the great dawning of change, without anything preceding it—it is called the radiant white *qi*. Then there is *Taichu*. *Chu* is the beginning of *qi*. There is *Taishi*. *Taishi* is the beginning of form. There is *Taisu*. *Taisu* is the beginning of substance. Thus it is called *Yi* (Change). Change transforms into the One; the One transforms into the Three; the Three transforms into the Five; the Five transforms into the Seven; the Seven transforms into the Nine. Nine is the ultimate. After reaching the extreme, it transforms back into the One. The One is called Heaven. Thus, the light and pure ascends to become Heaven; the heavy and turbid descends to become Earth; the harmonious *qi* in between becomes Human. Therefore, when Heaven and Earth unite their essence, the myriad things are transformed and born. Here ends the *Taishang Laojun Taisu Jing*.
