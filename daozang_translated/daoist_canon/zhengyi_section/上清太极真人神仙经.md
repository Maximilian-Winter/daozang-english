**The Supreme Clarity Grand Ultimate Perfected One’s Method of Ingesting the Four Poles’ Cloud-Teeth from the Divine Immortals’ Upper Realm**
*Transmitted to the female disciple Wei Huacun*

**The Oral Instructions of the Pure Void Perfected One**
The Perfected One embraces the radiance of the Five Directions’ primordial dawn and consumes the essence of the Nine Auroras. Thus, his divine light shines inwardly, while vermilion splendor manifests outwardly. His body emits jade-like brilliance, and his form harmonizes with luminous qi. After practicing this for ten years, the Elder of the Central Pole, the Primordial Sovereign of the Four Poles, descends to him. Together, they ascend to heaven in broad daylight, riding clouds and driving dragons.

Formerly, the Grand Ultimate Perfected One, Xiliang Ziwen, received the Supreme Lord’s oral instructions. After a thousand years and five transmissions, they were not to be recklessly divulged. According to the statutes of the Four Luminaries, following the regulations of the *Hidden Writings*, one must first fast for five days before transmission. A blood-oath pact is established, and ten gold rings are offered to the master as a token of the celestial and terrestrial vow of secrecy—five pairs of rings corresponding to the five oral instructions. Additionally, five ounces of green silk are used, as prescribed by the Western Liang Perfected One and explained by the Lady of Southern Marchmount. Cloud-gate silk may also be used, though the original scripture does not specify this.

Regularly, at the hour of the cock’s crow or dawn, one may recline or sit at ease. Knock the teeth nine times and then secretly recite the following invocation:

*"Eastern Azure Teeth, purple clouds streaming with auroras,
Three Pristine Ones meandering, dark frost and jade gauze.
Consume the dawn’s radiance, drink the morning’s blossoms."*

After the invocation, press the tongue against the outer upper lip, gather the saliva, and swallow it thirty times. After ten years of practice, the Elder of the Eastern Pole will arrive and bestow upon you the cinnabar-green true register. Together, you will ascend.

Next, secretly recite:

*"Southern Vermilion Cinnabar, auroras illuminating the Grand Tenuity,
Ninefold crimson mists scattering and spreading luminous splendor.
Consume the numinous dawn, drink from the cinnabar pool."*

After the invocation, press the tongue against the outer lower lip, gather the saliva, and swallow it thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the Southern Pole will arrive and bestow upon you the cinnabar radiance. Together, you will ascend.

Next, secretly recite:

*"Western Luminous Stone, flying auroras and golden liquid,
Consume the Grand Luminance, the essence of the Pristine Numinous.
Drink the jade nectar, divine splendor awakening the numinous,
That I may ascend the void, rising to the lofty clarity."*

After the invocation, press the tongue against the inner upper lip, gather the saliva, and swallow it thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the Western Pole will arrive and bestow upon you the oral instructions of the plain talisman’s majestic spirit. Together, you will ascend.

Next, secretly recite:

*"Northern Mystic Essence, auspicious clouds unfolding the embryo,
Verdant numen unfurling the dawn, purple canopy and azure banners.
Consume the moon’s splendor, drink the jade-like sweet dew."*

After the invocation, press the tongue against the inner lower lip, gather the saliva, and swallow it thirty times. After ten years, the Elder of the Northern Pole will arrive and bestow upon you the mysterious register and precious covenant. Together, you will ascend.

Then, recite the following secret incantation:

*"The origin of Wu and Ji, yellow and pristine Five Clouds,
Four Auroras and Purple Contemplation, Eight Effulgences and Nine Dawns.
Dual Luminances clashing in radiance, Seven Luminaries and Numinous Honored Ones,
Harmonize essence and irrigate qi, consume the Central Primordial.
Jade-like splendor and dragon embryo, drink the nectarous spring."*

After the incantation, swirl the tongue to fill the mouth, rinsing the inner and outer dark palate, as well as between the tongue and teeth, above and below, thoroughly. Gather the saliva and swallow it thirty times. After ten years, the Primordial Sovereign of the Central Pole and the Supreme August Mysterious Yellow Elder Lord will descend and bestow upon you the *Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Concealed Heaven, Hidden Moon, Reclusive Radiance, Green Writ, Azure Essentials, and Tiger Script*. Together with the Four Elders, you will ascend.

This is the supreme oral instruction of the jade scripture, the Way of attaining the Five Elders. It severs grain and dispels the corpse, restores youthful complexion, renders one immune to cold and heat, and shields against calamities and harm. The divine immortal’s essence becomes luminous, years are extended, and lifespan is prolonged by ten thousand years. When the term is fulfilled, one will obtain the *Nine Jade Nectars* and *Eight Flying Clarities*, merging with the dual effulgences to harmonize with heaven and earth.

These five secret divine invocations should each be preceded by knocking the teeth nine times. They may be practiced regularly, not only at the cock’s crow or dawn. At midnight, when the body is tranquil and the spirit serene, one may proceed in stillness.

For those who cultivate Unity, if they encounter this Way, their practice will swiftly come to fruition. With cloud-like tranquility guarding the interior and primordial qi replenished through saliva-swallowing, one may be called a true practitioner of Unity, seeking abundant blessings for oneself.

Attaining the divine through the six fluids and five qi—since qi and fluids are already cultivated—is what is meant by seeking abundant blessings for oneself. If practicing this Way, one may consume qi. If hunger arises, one may eat wheat-based foods, gradually relinquishing grain, but not abandoning it all at once. This is what is meant by "diminishing and diminishing again, until reaching non-action."

This is the Way of void-like reflection, the work of spontaneity—what is meant by "drawing from afar the essence of heaven and earth, and from nearby the resources of the body." The *Cloud-Teeth* are the essential qi of the Five Elders and the auroras of the Grand Ultimate. Thus, one gathers the radiance of effulgences to replenish the harmony of the six fluids. Through profound and obscure resonance, the myriad spirits descend. In the mutual seeking of the obscure and luminous, response arises without call.

Thus, when the dragon intones over the abyss, effulgent clouds descend from the heavens. When the tiger roars upon the numinous peak, the surging winds shake the four directions. When the yang-burning mirror shines brightly, vermilion flames spontaneously arise. When the square water-receptacle captures the yin, dark streams overflow in abundance. All occurs naturally, beyond comprehension.

How much more so for the practitioner who focuses the mind upon the mysterious, delving deeply into the roots of the Dao, clearing the impurities from the breast, and preserving the True Unity within the Three Palaces? Gathering the scattered radiance of the Five Dawns, consuming the auroral nectar of the Six Nectars, invoking the rare treasures of the Nine Heavens, and uttering the secret words of wondrous numinosity—dragon effulgences leap forth, luminous light sevenfold resplendent. Savoring the Three Splendors upon the white teeth, drawing the precious liquid from the lips’ edge, refining the Six Viscera within, opening clarity and penetrating illumination, breathing the primordial qi of heaven, tempering the hun and po to refine the form, and dispatching the Primordial to serve the Numinous—one attains the state of divine cultivation.

After a decade of cultivation, the Five Spirits descend—what is there to boast of? Though weak as a woman, I have undertaken the supreme practice; my faint voice and rare resonance cannot be widely proclaimed. I briefly recount these wonders to share with fellow aspirants, lest those whose virtue falls short find cause to slander them.

—Preface by Lady Wei of the Southern Marchmount

**The Scripture of Treasured Spirits, as Spoken by the Perfected One of Pure Numinosity**

To fix the mind upon the true Dao and contemplate the numinous beings is to dwell in profound obscurity, yet even there, the unseen observes one’s intent. If external distractions remain uncast aside and idle recitations persist, one cannot reverse the years of the western elm or restore the hair of the youthful adept. Yet for those who immerse themselves in the profound with steadfast devotion, even if their teeth decay and their faces wrinkle, their temples whitening with age, the Dao can transform them into infants in but a moment. The question lies not in age but in the strength of one’s resolve—both young and old may tread this path, as I once did.

**The Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious and True**

The Lord of Life of the Eastern Minister said: My former master, Lord Wang, once transmitted to me *The Supreme Scripture of the Mysterious and True of the Luminous Hall*. One must purify the body through fasting and retain the sun and moon within the mouth—by day, the sun; by night, the moon—each made as large as a ring. The sun is crimson, with nine rays of purple light; the moon is yellow, with ten rays of white light. One visualizes and swallows the radiant essence of these rays, practicing this in secret without count. If one ceases this cultivation, the sun and moon return to dwell within the Luminous Hall of the face—the sun on the left, the moon on the right—so that their two luminous spirits merge with the pupils of the eyes, their qi intermingling. This practice gathers and circulates generative essence, harmonizes the hun and shen, commands the attendance of the Six Ding spirits, and invokes the protection of celestial soldiers. This is the Way of the Supreme Perfected.

*The Scripture of the Mysterious and True* must first be sworn to before practice; only then may one hear of the Way of Jade Pendants and Golden Earrings. Formerly, Ji Wei observed a three-year fast with single-minded devotion, and only then did he attain this—his body suffused with divine light before receiving the scripture. This Way of the Mysterious and True is essential yet unburdensome. I have long treasured and concealed it within my sleeve, sharing it now only with those who guard its secrecy.

The *Scripture of the Mysterious and True of the Luminous Hall* is brief. Its oral instructions are precisely as described here. Ji Wei did not initially receive the scripture but practiced according to these methods before finally obtaining it. If you wish to acquire it, seek it from Wei. The *Hidden Writ of Jade Pendants* is beyond Wei’s knowledge.

When ingesting immortal medicines, direct them toward your life’s origin. After consumption, avoid speaking of death, mourning, or inauspicious events, lest you offend the fetal spirits and nullify the medicine’s benefits. When traveling at night or lying in darkness, if fear arises in the heart, visualize the sun and moon returning to the Luminous Hall, and in an instant, all malevolent spirits will vanish. This is especially efficacious for those dwelling in the mountains.

**The Method:**
Daily, press with your hands the small cavities behind the eyebrows thirty-nine times. Then, with palms and fingers, massage the upper cheekbones beneath the eyes, and pull the ears thirty times—no fixed number of repetitions. Upon completion, press upward against the forehead thirty-nine times, beginning between the eyebrows and moving into the hairline. Swallow the saliva as often as it arises, without count. Regular practice will clarify the eyes, and within a year, one may read by night. This may also be done discreetly at the philtrum, without revealing its form.

The small cavities behind the eyebrows are the Mansion of the Upper Prime and Six Harmonies, governing the generation of ocular radiance, the refinement of luminous essence, the preservation of the pupils, and the cultivation of the eye spirits. This is the supreme method for the Perfected One’s sitting and rising—also called *The Scripture of the Perfected One’s Constant Abiding Within*.

The Perfected One sighed and said: If you wish to read by night, you must cultivate the *Constant Abiding*.

The reason the Perfected One can perceive all in the four directions, illuminating the eight distant realms, lies truly in the numerological brilliance of the August Emperor Lord. The area beneath the eyes and above the cheekbones is the Chamber of Decision and Brightness, the Returning Infant’s Supreme Way. The act of pulling the ears with the hands is the profound art of luminous reflection. Through this, the blood flows freely, wrinkles do not form, the eyes’ radiance shines mysteriously, and spirit and essence flourish.

When a person ages, it seldom begins elsewhere before the ears and eyes. The signs of aging also first appear at the temples. Pressing upward on the forehead, one visualizes the Red Child and the twin luminaries of the sun and moon, delighting the Upper Prime and initiating the Three Primes at the brows—cease only after completing the count. This is the method of *Hand Audience with the Three Primes to Fortify the Brain and Strengthen the Hair*.

For the four sides of the head, grasp the hair with both hands, smoothing it into place with frequent repetition. Thus, the blood circulates, and wind-dampness does not congeal. Upon completion, press the four corners of the eyes thirty-six times until the light is distinctly perceived—this verifies the eye spirits’ vitality. With prolonged practice, one may behold the hundred spirits.

The essential method of seeking the Dao is to make the eyes clear and the ears keen, for these are the masters of all affairs. Indeed, the ears and eyes are the ladder for seeking the true and the gateway for gathering the numinous. Gain and loss, life and death—all depend on them. Now, I transcribe this scripture to share, that it may be practiced and applied.

**On Consuming [Immortal] Food:**
One who consumes [immortal food] cannot be harmed by the hundred evils, nor afflicted by illness. All distracting thoughts vanish, the Three Corpses are extinguished, the ears and eyes grow keen, and the steps become light and swift. After ten years, the spirit of Azure Essence will attend and obey your commands. You may sit and vanish, conceal yourself, transform, and escape; summon wind and clouds. In years of famine when grain is unattainable, consume only *nan zhu* (southern candlewood), blended with *fu ling* (poria), or mixed with honey, or interspersed with pine and cypress leaves. Combine these on auspicious days—not merely for sustenance, but do not call it [immortal] food. Always pair this with breath circulation and saliva swallowing to harmonize the constructive and defensive qi. This is the constant practice.

[Immortal] food requires the use of cloud sprouts, but cloud sprouts do not require [immortal] food. When practicing with a group, use the ancient scale: one may consume two and a half *ge* per day.

Should one consume without fear of excess, the only concern is insufficient supply—thus the limit of two and a half *ge* per day is set. When first beginning to ingest the elixir, one must not immediately cease grain. This is a renowned formula of the highest immortals, an extraordinary path for those who abandon ordinary sustenance.

The *Scripture of the Great Cavern* is the treasured text of the Central Yellow Lord of the Dao, and unless one is a Daoist of the highest name and true attainment, one may not even glimpse its chapter headings or section divisions. Even among genuine immortals, there are those who have never heard of this book. Initially, it is decreed that it may be transmitted only once every hundred years, and solely to one who is capable of perfection and of utmost caution. Thereafter, upon fulfilling three hundred or five hundred years, one may dare to transmit it again to a single person—no more than three transmissions in total. The time limits are bound by covenantal regulations, and only when the right person appears may it be conferred. To transmit it lightly before the appointed time, violating the covenant, or to pass it to an unworthy recipient, or to reveal celestial patterns—all such offenses condemn one to the hells.

The *Luminous Chapters of the Supreme Writ of the Majestic Diagram* is the sacred and secret treasure-text of the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord. It is concealed within the Vermilion Jade Chamber of the Nine Heavens’ Celestial House, and unless one is diligent in heart and devoted to the true, possessing the recorded destiny of a Flying Mystery Celestial Immortal, one may neither see nor hear of it. Its chapter titles must never be spoken of carelessly. To speak of them recklessly or to violate the four prohibitions incurs the unrelenting judgment of the Three Officials of Heaven and Earth.

Initially, one was permitted to transmit it to a single recipient every three hundred years, and thereafter, after seven hundred years, to one more—each recipient being allowed but a second transmission. The years are bound by the covenant of sworn faith; to transmit it is to find the right person. To pass it on before the appointed time, violating the covenant, or to reveal it to an unworthy recipient, or to disclose celestial patterns—all who so transgress shall die and become lowly ghosts, their three generations of ancestors subjected to judgment, their lives met with cruel punishments: burning by fire, slaughter by blade. The statutes of the Mysterious Realm, the covenants of the Supreme Dao, are swiftly enforced by the Jade Lads who oversee and verify. Beware of inviting calamity, for it shall extend to your parents and ancestors. Even if one encounters an immortal before the allotted time has elapsed, one must seal one’s lips; those who keep silent shall naturally remain far from harm.

The *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern* is limited to three transmissions over five hundred years, with no further passing permitted. The *Supreme Writ of the Majestic Diagram’s Luminous Chapters* is limited to two transmissions over seven hundred years, with no further passing beyond these two. One must not speak carelessly of those who are unworthy to receive it, nor may one idly mention its chapter titles. To speak of them is to leak the sacred.

The *Supreme Writ of the Majestic Diagram’s Luminous Chapters* pertains to the essence and spirit of the sun and moon, ascending to them, communing with celestial radiance, and attaining the Dao of soaring through the void. All who master it ride cloud chariots and feathered canopies, command hosts of dragons, and ascend to the Purple Court of the August Heaven. The *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern* pertains to the Dao of summoning the numinous, the method of calling forth spirits to become a perfected one. Those who master it ride clouds and mount dragons, leaping through the mysterious void, clad in embroidered plumes, girded with golden essence and jade radiance, roaming the great auroras, ascending to the Nine Heavens. These true scriptures are the secret essentials of the Heavenly Emperor, subtle and wondrous beyond measure. Even the Primordial Perfected Ones conceal their chapter titles. To speak lightly of these two matters is to guard their secrecy—how much more so for worldly people, that they should be allowed to know their order?

Should one encounter and receive them, one must be utterly sincere and devoted, proceeding with reverence. All such undertakings require purification rites, each with its own specific purpose, and thus they are not recounted here in detail. If the *Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern* is leaked, the statutes of the Mysterious Realm decree that one scripture be removed, and one Jade Lad and Jade Maiden each be diminished. If it is leaked thrice, the offender shall die and never again attain the rank of immortal. If the *Supreme Writ of the Majestic Diagram’s Luminous Chapters* is leaked, ten Jade Lads and Jade Maidens each shall be diminished, and the text shall be lost from the world, returning to Heaven. If it is leaked a second time, the offender shall die, never again able to study the Dao, and shall never become an immortal. If one carelessly speaks of its chapter titles, all shall be judged by the Three Officials. The master shall meet their end on the day of their passing, or at the time when their body returns to the earth, their traces vanish, and their form dissolves. Only when one finds the right recipient may one transmit it; otherwise, it remains with oneself.

If there is one to receive it, both must swear a covenant before Heaven and Earth, pledging with blue-green gold and cinnabar-red silk, vowing against disclosure. The master shall report the matter to the higher realms, presenting it to the sun and moon. Those who do not adhere to the statutes and precepts commit the offense of reckless transmission.

At the pivot of the stone chamber’s door within the northern cavern of Mount Emei, an inscription in carved stone reads: *"Yu Yi draws forth the essence of the sun; Jie Lin summons the spirit of the moon. Attaining the Dao, they ascend to the Upper Palace, where their rank is called Great Master Perfected."* These twenty characters in all. Lesser immortals who read this inscription often fail to comprehend its meaning—what manner of affair it signifies. Indeed, even among immortals, many have never beheld its full text.

The above seven matters are inscribed in cinnabar and ink, all being the authentic words of the scripture, without addition or omission.

**1. Method of the Divine Scripture of the Purple Text for Absorbing and Ingesting Solar Qi**

The *Method of the Divine Scripture of the Purple Text of the Golden Watchtower of the Supreme Clarity for Absorbing the Flying Root and Ingesting Solar Qi* was formerly received from the Celestial August Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also named *The Scripture of the Vermilion Elixir, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, and Water Mother*.

At the time when the sun first rises, face eastward toward the sun, click the teeth nine times, and silently invoke the names of the solar soul and the five emperors within the sun, reciting: *"Solar soul, Pearl Radiance, Shining Veil, Green Reflections, Returning Rosy Clouds, Vermilion Youth, Dark Flame, Whirlwind Image."* After silently reciting these sixteen characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored streaming rosy clouds within the sun descending to envelop the entire body, reaching down to the feet. Then visualize the five qi ascending to the crown of the head. At this moment, the sunlight and five-colored rosy clouds all enter the mouth. Within the sunlight and rosy clouds, there are also several dozen purple qi, each the size of an eye’s pupil, resplendent amid the five lights—these are called the *Flying Root* and *Water Mother*. Together with the five qi, they enter the mouth. Face the sun and swallow the rosy clouds forty-five times. After swallowing, swallow the saliva nine times, then click the teeth nine times again and silently invoke:

*"Crimson Crucible, Elixir Qi, Round Heaven Nurtures Essence,
Receiving the Firm with the Supple, Blazing Water’s Yin Flower,
Solar Orb’s Primordial Radiance, Named the Great Luminance,
Eight-Nine Yang Transformations, Twin Mists Together Arise,
Condensing the Hun, Harmonizing the Po, Quintessence of the Five Qi,
Within Birth the Five Emperors, Riding Light to Command Form,
Gathering the Flying in Emptiness, Grasping the Root to Attain Fullness,
Head Wrapped in Dragon’s Flower, Clad in Vermilion, Girded in Azure,
Reining the Crow, Streaming the Dark, Rosy Clouds Reflecting the Supreme Clarity,
Bestowed the Jade Tablet, Name Engraved in the Hollow Pavilion,
Ingesting the Morning Flower, Merging with the Perfected in Spirit,
Audience with the Immortals of the Grand Tenuity, Ascending to the Purple Court."*

After the invocation, bow twice toward the sun. Among ten thousand true immortals, not one knows the name of the solar soul. This Dao is profoundly mysterious; it is not something that those who consume blood and foul flesh may hear.

On overcast days without sun, one may perform this within a clean and pure chamber. Cultivating Daoists who are refined and capable of ascending influences may practice this even without seeing the sun. If a Daoist abstains from grains in the mountains and forests, maintains perpetual purity upon the Five Peaks, severs ties with the mundane world, and aspires to purity and truth, by daily ingesting the rosy clouds of the solar root and swallowing the essence of the Grand Yang, they will immediately feel their body suffused with jade-like luster and their face radiant with flowing light.

For those entangled in worldly affairs, unable to still their form, drifting along worldly paths, and bound by constraints, they should practice this on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, thirteenth, fifteenth, seventeenth, nineteenth, and twenty-fifth days of the lunar month. Following the above method, they will perform this ten times within a month. These days are when the solar soul descends to connect, the Flying Root is full, and the Water Mother gathers in dreams. Practicing this for eighteen years, the Supreme Clarity will refine one with golden perfection, polish one with jade-like radiance, and confer the rank of true immortal. One will soar through the great void, riding the Three Primordial Flowers to traverse the world.

**2. The Luminous Talisman of the Divine Scripture of the Purple Text of the Grand Tenuity for Ingesting Solar Qi**

*(The original talisman is missing.)* On the night of the last day of the lunar month, write this in cinnabar on blue-green paper, face east, and swallow it to first announce to the solar soul. When ingesting the talisman, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the left hand, and silently invoke:

*"Grand Tenuity’s Vermilion Scripture, Named the Luminous,
Summons the Solar Upper Soul to Transform My Form,
Preparing with Solemn Attire, Emerging from the Round Court,
Flying Flower Water Mother, Solar Root Golden Essence,
Purple Reflections Streaming Light, Named the Five Spirits."*

After the invocation, ingest the talisman.

---

**3. Method of the Divine Scripture of the Purple Text for Absorbing and Ingesting Lunar Essence**

The *Method of the Divine Scripture of the Purple Text of the Golden Watchtower of the Supreme Clarity for Absorbing the Yin Flower and Ingesting Lunar Essence* was formerly received from the Celestial August Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. It is also named *The Scripture of the Yellow Qi, Yang Essence, Concealing Heaven, and Hidden Moon*.

At the time when the moon first rises, face westward toward the moon, click the teeth ten times, and silently invoke the names of the lunar soul and the five ladies within the moon, reciting: *"Lunar soul, Warm and Whispering, Fragrant and Radiant, Veiled and Vast, Graceful and Void, Spirit Orchid, Luxuriant Flower, Knotted Petals, Still Pool, Golden Clarity, Nurturing Brilliance, Luminous Countenance, Terrace Standard."* After silently reciting these twenty-four characters, close the eyes, clench the fists, and visualize the five-colored streaming essences within the moon descending to envelop the entire body, reaching down to the feet. Then visualize the five qi ascending to the crown of the head. At this moment, the moonlight and five-colored essences all enter the mouth. Within the moonlight and essences, there are also several dozen yellow qi, each the size of an eye’s pupil, layered and following within the five-colored lunar light—these are called the *Flying Yellow* and *Lunar Flower Essence*. Together with the five qi, they enter the mouth. Face the moon and swallow the essence fifty times.

After completing the fifty swallows of qi, swallow the saliva ten times in succession, then click the teeth ten times. Softly recite the following invocation:

*"Yellow Clarity, Mysterious Radiance,
Primal Yin’s ascending qi,
Scattered and luxuriant as the cold whirlwind,
Streaming clouds gather in the Stomach,
The orchid’s edge lies empty,
Upright and bathed in the still vessel,
Moon’s essence and night’s luminance,
Most noble in the Mysterious Palace,
Five Lords’ Consorts,
Named as the Protecting Mothers’ ranks,
The Crimson Child flies in,
The Infant follows after,
The Three Yin converge in return,
Illuminating the ten thousand directions with Mysterious Light,
Harmonizing the hun and restraining the po,
The Five Embryos flow in communion,
Riding the rosy clouds, the flying essence,
Soaring freely in the eastern void,
The head crowned with numinous clouds,
Radiant blossoms summon the wind,
On the left, the Dragon Talisman hangs,
On the right, the Tiger Seal is girded,
Phoenix plumes and crimson mantle,
Jade pendants and golden earrings,
The soaring tree entwines the peaks,
Called the Wood King,
Divine toads grasp its roots,
Filled with luminous essence,
Inwardly reflecting the Mysterious Water,
Spouting beams to bestow scriptures,
Jade tablets inscribed with names,
Cloud Chambers’ diet of celestial nourishment,
Sun and Moon’s essences,
Unite with the Perfected,
Flying immortals of the Purple Tenuity,
Ascend to pay court to the Supreme Emperor."*

Upon finishing the invocation, bow twice toward the moon. Visualize the sun and moon—whether sitting or standing, as is convenient.

Within the ranks of the immortal officials, there is not one who knows the name of the Moon’s Hun-soul. Only the Perfected of that time knew it. When the sky is overcast and the moon is absent, this practice may be performed indoors, following the essential instructions as in the method for absorbing sunlight. If performed every evening, one will swiftly perceive the body radiating light, and the eyes emitting flying essence.

The essential method: on the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, sixteenth, eighteenth, twentieth, twenty-second, and twenty-fourth days of the month—ten times in a single month—this is sufficient to attain immortality. On these evenings, the yin essence takes flight and converges, the three qi overflow, the moon’s water congeals into blossoms, and the Yellow Spirit descends to receive them. After practicing this for eighteen years, the Upper Clarity will refine the hun-soul and exchange the po-soul, illuminating them with jade light, so that one may ride the dark reins of radiance and soar through the great void.

**Purple Text of the Numinous Scripture: Serving the Four Talismans of the Great Yin’s Engendering (the original talisman is missing)**
On the night of the new moon at midnight, write in yellow on blue paper, face east to ingest it, first making an announcement to the Moon’s Hun-soul. At this time, one should first ingest the Talisman of Opening Brightness. When about to ingest the moon talisman, hold the breath, grasp the talisman in the right hand, and intone in the heart:

*"Purple Text of the Yellow Writ, named the Great Mystery,
It summons the moon’s blossom-water,
Nourishes the po and harmonizes the hun.
Within the square, solemn affairs arise from the Mysterious Pass,
Concealing heaven and hiding the moon,
The Five Numinous Ladies,
Nine beams of flying light,
Illumine the Muddy Pellet."*

After the incantation, ingest the talisman.

**Purple Text of the Numinous Scripture of the Grand Tenuity: The Method for Restraining the Three Hun-Souls**
On the evenings of the third, thirteenth, and twenty-third days of the month, at this time, the three hun-souls are unsettled. The Radiant Spirit roams freely, the Womb Light releases its form, and the Dark Essence stirs and calls. The Radiant Spirit, Womb Light, and Dark Essence are the names of the three hun-soul spirits. On these evenings, they all rush forth from the body to wander and roam, drifting away from their original chamber. They may be detained and restrained by other souls or external spirits, captured by spectral beings, or unable to return, their forms abandoned and their essences dispersed. They may clash with external souls, the two qi contending, agitating the Red Child, causing wayward thoughts, comings and goings without form, and a heart heavy with sorrow.

Daoists must restrain and control them to prevent their wandering. The method of restraint: lie down properly, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, cross the hands over the heart, close the eyes, hold the breath for three cycles, and click the teeth three times. Visualize a red qi the size of a chicken’s egg within the heart, rising upward from within and exiting through the eyes. Once outside, the red qi expands, enveloping the body, suffusing it inside and out with a penetrating glow, as if burning charcoal. When this is complete, one will feel a slight warmth within the body. Then click the teeth three more times and visualize the names of the three hun-souls—Womb Light, Radiant Spirit, Dark Essence—commanding the three spirits to halt at once. Softly intone:

*"Palace of the Grand Tenuity, Yellow Beginning within Azure,
Internally refining the three hun-souls,
Womb Light finds peace,
The divine treasure of the Jade Chamber,
Born with me,
Must not move recklessly.
The overseer is the Great Numinous One.
If you wish to fly,
You may only journey to the Supreme Clarity of the Great Ultimate.
If you hunger or thirst,
You may only drink the jade essence of the returning water."*

**Purple Text of the Numinous Scripture of the Grand Tenuity: The Method for Controlling the Seven Po-Souls**
On the evenings of the new moon, full moon, and dark moon, at this time, the seven po-souls drift and wander, roaming through defilement. They may commune with blood offerings, consorting with ghosts and specters; or attach to corpses, entering and exiting; or seduce the Red Child, gathering licentiousness to assail the dwelling; or speak of others’ sins, reporting to the Three Officials and the River Earl; or transform into demons, causing people to suffer from malevolent influences; or lead ghosts into the body, summoning evil to slay the essence. All afflictions and illnesses that harm people are the sins of the po-souls. They delight in people’s deaths, for such is their nature; they desire people’s ruin, for such is their malady.

Daoists must restrain, discipline, govern, correct, and subdue them with authority. The first po-soul is named Corpse Dog, the second Concealed Arrow, the third Yin Sparrow, the fourth Swallowing Thief, the fifth Malignant Poison, the sixth Removing Filth, and the seventh Fetid Lung. These are the names of the seven po-souls, the turbid spirits within the body.

The method of control: lie down properly, remove the pillow, stretch the feet, cover the ears with the palms, and join the fingertips at the nape of the neck. Hold the breath for seven cycles, and visualize a white qi the size of a small bean at the tip of the nose. Gradually, it grows larger, encircling the body ninefold, descending to the feet and ascending to the head. Once the head is enveloped, the white qi suddenly transforms into a celestial beast. Command two Azure Dragons to reside in the eyes, two White Tigers in the nostrils, all facing outward. At the heart, facing the mouth, place a Dark Tortoise beneath the left foot and a Numinous Serpent beneath the right. Within the ears, two Jade Maidens clad in dark brocade stand at the ear gates, each holding a flame in their hands. After a long while, when all is complete, swallow saliva seven times, click the teeth seven times, and call the names of the seven po-souls. Then intone:

*"Nine cycles of pure qi,
Restrain the po-souls and dispel misfortune.
Celestial beasts guard the gates,
Maidens hold the passes.
Refine the po-souls to harmony,
Abide with me in peace.
Do not move recklessly,
Observe and examine the source of form.
If you hunger or thirst,
You may only drink the moon’s yellow and the sun’s cinnabar."*

Thus, the seven po-souls are inwardly sealed, bound to receive restraint. If practiced regularly, the turbidity of the po-souls will dissipate below, returning to goodness and uniting with the form. Above, they harmonize with the Three Palaces, merging with the primordial to unite with the numinous.

Within a single person’s body reside the spirits of the Three Primordial Palaces: the Dark Gate Supreme Lord of the Life Gate, along with the spirits of the three hun-souls, totaling seven spirits. All dwell within the form, desiring to grant long life, benevolence, and great fortune.

The seven po-souls also receive life within a single body, yet they become adversaries that assail the form—thus they must be restrained. Daoists may know the methods of seeking immortality, but if they do not understand the Way of restraining the po-souls, their efforts will be in vain.

The locations of the Three Primordial Palaces are as follows:
The Upper Primordial Palace resides in the Mud Pill (niwan), its spirit the Red Child, whose name is Three Primordials First, also called Imperial Minister.
The Middle Primordial Palace lies at the center of the Crimson Chamber, its spirit the Perfected One, whose name is Child of Southern Cinnabar, also called Central Radiance Firm.
The Lower Primordial Palace of the Cinnabar Field is three inches below the navel, its spirit the Infant, whose name is Primordial Yang Child, also called Mysterious Below the Valley.
These are the spirits of the Three Ones.

When seeking to restrain the hun and po-souls, first silently invoke their names, visualizing the three spirits as jade-hued with golden radiance, bearing the appearance of infants. The Upper and Middle Primordial Palaces’ spirits wear red robes, while the Lower Primordial’s wears yellow, their heads like those of newborn infants. When practicing the Dao or absorbing qi, one should also visualize and invoke their names.

The Life Gate is the navel. The Dark Gate is the passage through which the umbilical cord first connected. Within it lies the Palace of Life, where the Great Lord resides, named Peach Child, whose name is Union of Extension. He wears a vermilion kerchief and a purple countenance cap, seated at the Life Gate, with the three hun-soul spirits attending beside him. The Great Lord constantly holds the Heavenly Sovereign’s Symbolic Talisman, which harmonizes and infuses primordial qi, repairing the womb and reversing the placenta.

Before sleeping at night, first hold the breath for twenty-four cycles, then silently invoke the Great Spirit’s name three times. Swallow saliva fifty times, click the teeth thrice, and recite:
*"Great Spirit of the Womb, Heavenly Sovereign of the Imperial Symbol,
Holding the Placental Talisman, crowned with a purple kerchief,
Yellow revolves and red turns, ascending to refine the Life Gate,
Transforming spirit to reverse life, the Six Harmonies intermingle,
The body shines with radiance, the Jade Maiden dwells within."*

If one practices this regularly for eighteen years, the Great Lord will be able to stir the Three Fields on the left and guide the Three Qi on the right. The Fields will transform into a flying chariot, the Qi into a mysterious dragon. Above, he commands the twenty-four spirits; below, he directs the hun-souls. He summons the Yang Officials of the Six Jia and the Yin Officials of the Six Ding, with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders, ascending to heaven in broad daylight. All this is the response evoked by the Peach Lord. Though this Way is minor, it is nonetheless worthy of contemplation.

The *Numinous Purple Script of Celestial Mystery Talisman* (original talisman missing) — The *Celestial August Image Talisman* is bestowed upon the Great Spirit of the Life Palace, Peach Child He Yan, to harmonize primordial qi and govern the embryo’s refined essence. Inscribe it in cinnabar on azure paper, and at midnight on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, face north to ingest it. Hold the talisman in the left hand, hold the breath, and recite in the heart:

*"Celestial Emperor’s Mysterious Writ,
August Image’s Numinous Talisman,
Harmonizes primordial qi,
Circulates essence to reverse the embryo.
The Ten-Thousand-Year Infant,
Soars wearily to the Celestial Pivot.
Great Spirit of the Life Palace,
Clad in cinnabar, crowned in purple,
Conspires with me in counsel."*

After the recitation, ingest the talisman and rise to bow twice. When ingesting the talisman, do so upon the bed where one sleeps.

If a Daoist cultivates the Way of Returning Essence, revolving the yellow and turning the red, morning essence irrigates the Life Gate, infusing fluids to nourish liquids, causing both man and woman to share the cinnabar elixir and their faces to glow with jade-like radiance—such a one should know the name of the Great Lord and must ingest the *Celestial August Image Talisman* to attain agelessness. If one merely performs the practices without knowing the spirit’s name, returns essence without ingesting the talisman, remains ignorant of the incantation’s discourse, or cannot fathom the palace where the spirit dwells, even if one attains a lifespan of a thousand years, one will still inevitably return one’s corpse to the Great Yin. Though one accumulates lives through countless ages, one will ultimately surrender one’s bones to the Three Officials.

If a Daoist, when lying down or at dusk, visualizes the Great Lord and practices the incantation’s method, ingests the talisman on the first and fifteenth days to circulate the embryo’s essence for benefit—such a one may also become an immortal without the need for the arts of returning and replenishing through man and woman.

Yet to govern women in pursuit of flight, to revolve qi in quest of celestial immortality, is more perilous than water and fire, swifter in destruction than axe and adze. Unless one is a person of ashen heart who embraces the One, one will scarcely avoid ruin through these practices. If one of middling talent attempts this, it is like swallowing a sword and hoping the throat remains unharmed—how could this be possible?

The Great Spirit Lord of the Life Palace abhors the consumption of raw blood, the burning of the fur of the six livestock, the burning of garlic skins and leaves, and all manner of pungent vegetables, for these disrupt the embryo’s qi and offend the infant spirit with their stench. Be cautious of these.

*The True Scripture of the Three Origins* (original talisman missing) — The *Supreme Ultimate Treasure Chapter* is inscribed in azure on New Year’s Day, and after facing north to bow twice and ingest it, one recites the truths of the Three Origins. The *True Talismans of the Three Origins* are ingested at dawn on the eight solar terms, continuing for sixteen days. Face the king, visualize the spirits of the Three Palaces, hold the talisman, and recite:

*"The Red Child congeals in heaven,
Fills my Mud Pill Palace.
The True Person’s Spirit Pearl,
Guards the storehouse and protects the body.
Infant Brother’s primal essence,
Unblocks and benefits the fluids of life.
Today, on the Upper, Middle, and Lower Origins,
I ingest the talisman to command the true."*

After ingestion, bow twice again.

---

*The Oral Instructions of the True One Scripture*
Ingest the talisman for sixteen days during each of the eight solar terms. On New Year’s Day, inscribe and ingest the *Treasure Chapter Talisman* in azure.

One *cun* below the space between the eyebrows and three *fen* inward into the bone: on the left is the *Crimson Terrace Azure Chamber*, on the right the *Yellow Gate Purple Portal*. Seven *fen* inward lies the *Hall of Brightness Palace*, where three spirits sit facing outward, clad in green brocade. One *cun* inward lies the *Crimson Chamber Palace*, home to the *Ji* soul spirit, all dressed in red embroidery. One *cun* inward lies the *Mud Pill Palace*.

At the center of the heart, one *cun* square, lies the *Crimson Palace*. Two *cun* and five *fen* below the navel’s center, one *cun* inward from the skin and three *cun* within, lies the *Cinnabar Field Palace*.

The locations of the *Central Terrace Gate*, *Hall of Brightness*, *Cavern Chamber*, *Mud Pill Palace* in the head, as well as the *Crimson Palace* in the heart and the *Cinnabar Field* below the navel.

When a Daoist sits, lies, walks, eats, drinks, feels sorrow or joy, or closes the eyes, one should always visualize the One. Visualize the spirits as resembling newly born infants, all vividly present within their palaces. The visualization method: each terrace and gate has a spirit, with attire matching the terrace and gate.

Next, visualize the three spirits in the *Hall of Brightness* and the form of the *Ji* soul in the *Cavern Chamber*. Then visualize the *Mud Pill Palace*, the *Crimson Palace* in the heart, and the *Cinnabar Field Palace* below the navel—within each palace, purple, azure, and crimson qi swirl like mist.

Visualize within the *Mud Pill Palace*’s purple qi the Northern Dipper’s seven stars, the Dipper inverted with its handle pointing forward. Below the Dipper, within the azure and crimson qi, on the left is the *Red Child*, on the right the *Imperial Minister*, both clad in embroidered robes.

Next, visualize within the heart’s three qi mists: on the left the *Spirit Pearl*, on the right the *Assistant August*, both in vermilion brocade. Then visualize within the *Cinnabar Field*’s three qi below the navel: on the left the *Infant*, on the right the *Supporting Minister*, both in yellow embroidered silk.

At midnight, align with the lunar station and complete the visualization. Then visualize the *Mud Pill Palace*’s purple qi emerging from between the eyebrows like a sinew, ascending straight to heaven, its light illuminating ninety thousand *li*. Visualize ninety thousand ears, all counting this.

Next, visualize the heart’s crimson mist emerging from the hollow before the heart like a sinew, ascending straight to heaven, its light illuminating thirty thousand *li* of qi, contained within the aforementioned purple qi.

Then visualize the white qi of the *Cinnabar Field* below the navel emerging from the navel like a sinew, ascending straight to heaven, its light illuminating seventy thousand *li* of qi, contained within the crimson mist, its radiance mingling with the purple, crimson, and white qi.

Visualize the crimson, purple, and white qi intermingling and shining distinctly. When complete, recite:

Within the Purple Chamber and Azure House dwell two great spirits—serene Dharma Kings, their hearts aligned with the true square. In their hands they grasp flowing bells, their bodies generating wind and clouds. They guard the true Dao at my side, barring all external intrusion, enabling my thoughts to penetrate and the numinous gates to open smoothly. My entry and exit are unimpeded, ascending through the Nine Gates, where I behold the Nine Perfected, the Most High’s honored ones.

[Conclude] #3, then enter a state of reverie, forget the body, and lie down with eyes closed, visualizing the spirits. After three months of this practice, the spirit-qi will descend, manifesting before you. Then you may seek to become a flying immortal.

The method of visualizing the true and guarding the One requires that clothing and footwear not be lent to others, nor should you share a bed with another.

When visualizing the One, you must ascend through the heavens, ever aware of the direction in which the Dipper’s handle points. On the midnight of the *Lichun* day, sit facing east, hold the breath for nine cycles, and swallow saliva thirty-five times. Visualize the Northern Dipper’s seven stars slowly descending until they reach the crown of your head. The size of the Dipper’s stars may appear indistinct; the *Kui* covers your crown, its handle pointing forward, radiant and resplendent.

Then proceed with the usual visualization of the palace spirits, clearly and completely—except that you do not see the qi ascending to heaven. Next, recite the invocation to the Purple Chamber and Azure House as usual.

After a while, one divine emperor from each of the Three Palaces suddenly emerges and enters the Dipper above your crown. Soon after, one ministerial spirit from each palace also emerges and enters the crown. The six spirits within the *Kui* of the Dipper arrange themselves in orderly formation, following the celestial net of stars before your face, moving to the *Tian Guan* star. Together, they turn toward your mouth.

After a while, inhale once, and the two spirits of the Upper Prime enter your mouth with the breath, returning to the *Niwan* Palace. Inhale again, and the two spirits of the Middle Prime enter your mouth, returning to the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace.

When the visualization is complete, recite:
The Five Directions command the Dipper, the spirits manifest the Seven Stars.
The Three Honored Ones congeal and transform, summoning the Purple Numinous.
The Six Spirits wander, the Three Officials dwell in the Cinnabar City.
Mysteriously linked to the Supreme Thearch, they descend to permeate the Yellow Tranquility.
The celestial perfected guard and protect, calling forth the Six *Ding* spirits.
Immortal and talisman unite, riding the mist to the Three Clarities.
The four limbs are tempered and refined, the five viscera spontaneously generate.

[Conclude], then enter reverie, forget the body, and lie down.

Begin this practice on the eighth night after *Lichun*. On the midnight of *Lixia*, sit facing south and visualize; on the midnight of *Liqiu*, sit facing west and visualize; on the midnight of *Lidong*, sit facing north and visualize. For the Three Primes and the Four *Li* days, perform the visualization for eight nights each, following the method used for *Lichun*.

On the midnight of the *Chunfen* day, sit facing east, hold the breath for nine cycles, and swallow saliva thirty times. Visualize within the *Yangming* star of the Northern Dipper a purple qi like a bowstring, descending straight to pour into your body. Then proceed with the usual visualization, and next recite the invocation to the Purple Chamber and Azure House.

Next, visualize your hun-soul in the *Dongfang* Palace, clad in its proper attire. Then visualize the *Niwan* Palace with the Northern Dipper inverted above it, and beneath the Dipper, two spirits from the heart and navel palaces—six spirits in total—along with your hun-soul covering the Dipper. All appear indistinctly before you.

The Three Emperors stand before you, your hun-soul at the center, the Three Ministers behind—seven spirits in all. Together they ride the inverted Dipper of the *Niwan*, each of the seven stars aligned above one spirit’s crown. From the purple qi beneath *Yangming*, they float upward with the Dipper, entering the *Yangming* star in the heavens. In a state of reverie, visualize them within the Purple Palace, the seven spirits seated in order. Each swallows the purple qi thirty times, and your hun-soul swallows along with them.

After a while, the seven spirits together ride the inverted Dipper, descending along the purple qi. In a state of reverie, each returns to its palace. When the visualization is clear, recite:
The Three Honored Upper Perfected, the Most Mysterious Lofty Spirits,
*Yangming* governs spring, the myriad youths open the gates.
*Danyuan* governs summer, vermilion and purple merge in mist.
*Yinjing* governs autumn, the Celestial Might arrays the six formations.
*Beiji* governs winter, severing evil and blocking treachery.
The Five Lands hold *Ren*, *Wu* and *Ji* are the Celestial Gates.
What they strike is destroyed, what they face cannot resist.
They refine my seven *po*, harmonize my three *hun*,
Generate my five viscera, enable me to attain the true,
Ascend and fly to the Upper Clarity, float through the Seven Origins.
Attain long life—be cautious in your conduct,
Whistle and command the thousand spirits.

[Conclude], then enter reverie and rest, maintaining the visualization.

On the midnight of the *Xiazhi* day, face south and visualize the purple qi of the *Danyuan* star descending to pour into your body, and the seven spirits riding the Dipper to ascend into the *Beiji* star.

For the Four Nodes and the *Tuwang* days, perform the Five Dippers and Three Ones visualization for eight nights each. The methods of visualizing the spirits and reciting invocations follow the *Chunfen* day’s practice. Focus your mind with utmost sincerity.

On the first *Jian* day of the month, at dawn, face the direction of the moon’s establishment. After completing the usual visualization, the six spirits of the Three Palaces suddenly appear before you. Bow three times to them with your heart and recite:
Celestial Honored Three Emperors, guard the gate of my destiny.
Roam within the numinous, the six qi mystically divided.
Nourish my five spirits, rectify my three *hun*.
The five viscera spontaneously generate, long life and flying immortality.

[Conclude], then visualize the spirits returning in reverie to the Three Palaces, and swallow saliva thirty times.

On the first *Chu* day of the month, at night, gaze upward at the Northern Dipper’s auxiliary star. With eyes closed, visualize the six spirits of the Three Palaces emerging from the auxiliary star and descending straight into your Three Palaces. Then lie down and continue the visualization, reciting:
The Most High’s celestial revolution, where the Five Emperors roam,
The Three Ministers escort and guard, uniting with the true.
Descend into my body, seated in tranquil stillness.
Exhale essence to irrigate my form, *hun* and *po* harmoniously moistened.
Enable me to become a flying immortal, riding the cloud chariot in floating ascent.

[Conclude] #4, and swallow saliva thirty-seven times.

On the first *Kai* day of the month, at midnight, face east, loosen your hair and comb it. After combing, tie it up and recite:
Upper Prime Three Perfected, the infant within the true,
Hair unbound to open the mist, ascending to connect with the Celestial Terrace.
The *Niwan* is firm and congealed, coeval with heaven.
Enable me to become a flying immortal, traversing the Terrace of Communication.

[Conclude] #5, and swallow saliva nineteen times. Lie down in a state of reverie, visualizing the six spirits of the Three Palaces and the *hun* soul within the Grotto Chamber. Exhale qi thirty times into each, filling the palaces.

Whenever approaching a meal, first close your eyes and click your teeth three times. Then visualize the six spirits of the Three Palaces suddenly emerging. After eating and drinking, visualize them returning to the Three Palaces. Recite:

The hundred grains enter the stomach, uniting with the spirits in qi.
Qi fills the blood and fluids, the corpse-demons perish and fall.
Ascend in flight to the Golden Gates, enduring with heaven and earth.
Command the Six Dings, with divine youths in attendance and guard.

[Conclude], then eat.

Whenever combing your hair, always face the [Celestial] King. After tying up your hair, click your teeth three times and recite:

The Mysterious Flower of *Niwan* preserves essence and ensures its eternal presence.
To the left, the Hidden Moon; to the right, the Root of the Sun.
The Six Harmonies refine and purify, the hundred spirits receive grace.

[Conclude] #6, and swallow saliva three times. Then, with the comb, repeatedly stroke left and right, front and back, several dozen times.

On the first day of each month, always bathe to multiply the absorption of true qi. Commonly, use eight ounces of peach bark and twenty ounces of bamboo leaves. Boil these in one *hu* and two *dou* of water, adjust to a suitable temperature, and bathe—not merely wash the hair. The Perfected Ones descending to the mortal world and returning to heaven also regularly used this for bathing.

*Shangqing Taiji Perfected One’s Scripture of Divine Immortality* concludes.
