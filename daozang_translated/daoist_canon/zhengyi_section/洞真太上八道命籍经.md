**The Wondrous Scripture of the Supreme Eight Dao Registers of Life, Fascicle One**

**Formulas for Absolving Sins**

The *Eight Dao Registers of Life* is also called the *Eight Intervals*, the *Eight Attainments*, and further named the *Wondrous Scripture of the Eightfold Liberation, Unbinding Knots, Repenting Sins, and Prolonging Blessings*. The Lord of Primordial Purity’s Three Origins received it from the natural chapters and sealed it within the Purple Chamber of the Numinous Capital of the Supreme. Three hundred attendants, adorned with golden seals and jade blossoms, stood guard and tended the incense. The Youth of the Eastern Sea, the Perfected of the Four Poles, and the Lord King of the Western City sealed it within the western chamber of Mount Emei. Transmitted once every ten thousand kalpas, those with the mystic name "Imperial Tablet of Purple Script" and the "Jade Treasury of the Azure Palace" may receive three transmissions within a thousand years. Disciples of the highest learning who lack this text will toil in vain among the mountains and forests, never attaining the Dao.

The so-called *Eight Dao* refer to the paths traversed by the sun and moon during the eight solar terms of the four seasons. The sun travels the Red Dao, and the moon travels the Yellow Dao—these two, the Yellow and Red Dao, are the constant paths of yin and yang. At the solar terms of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) and *Chunfen* (Spring Equinox), the moon travels the two Green Dao, emerging east of the Yellow Dao. At *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) and *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice), the moon travels the two Red Dao, emerging south of the Yellow Dao. At *Liqiu* (Beginning of Autumn) and *Qiufen* (Autumn Equinox), the moon travels the two White Dao, emerging west of the Yellow Dao. At *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) and *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice), the moon travels the two Black Dao, emerging north of the Yellow Dao. These are the *Eight Dao*.

On the days when the moon traverses the Eight Dao, all things undergo transformation: winged creatures take flight, crawling beings stir, and all that bears qi—plants, trees, flying and submerged beings—respond to conditions, altering the old and renewing themselves. The light becomes heavier, the heavy becomes lighter; good and evil interchange. The movement of qi and its manifestations occur naturally. Disciples of the highest learning, following these transformations, practice auspiciousness and eliminate inauspiciousness, advance the fortunate and demote the wicked, clarify the abandonment of darkness, enter rectitude to govern perversity, refine the false into the true, and elevate the foolish to sagehood. This method is lofty and wondrous; this Dao is profound and unfathomable. Thus, it is called the *Eight Attainments*, reaching the ultimate without end.

For the *First Dao Register of Life*: at dawn on *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), gaze northward for clouds of purple, green, and white—these are the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme’s *Three Pure Flying Clouds*. Kneel, knock your head to the ground, and clasp your cheeks nine times each. Bow four times in your heart, then prostrate twice more. Silently recite the incantation:

*"The humble descendant [insert name] today fortunately encounters the procession of the Three Origins. May I attain longevity and serve the wheel-hub of the celestial chariot. The rest of my words follow my own intent: [I] beseech healing from illness, deliverance from calamity, dissolution of disaster, and fulfillment of my wishes."*

Upon seeing the cloud chariot thrice, one ascends to immortality in broad daylight, no longer requiring other meditative practices of a thousand or a hundred.

Performing these rites ensures enrollment in the immortal registers—hence they are called the *Eight Dao Registers of Destiny*.

The **Second Dao Register of Destiny**: At midnight of the vernal equinox, facing northeast, observe clouds of dark cyan and yellow—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Celestial Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Third Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the summer solstice’s onset, facing northwest, observe clouds of purple, cyan, and yellow—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Supreme Perfected Lords of the Great Ultimate’s Inner Palace. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Fourth Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the summer solstice, facing southeast, observe clouds of red, white, and cyan—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Celestial Emperor of Fusang. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Fifth Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the autumnal equinox’s onset, facing due west, observe clouds of white, red, and purple—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Heavenly Sovereign White Emperor of the Supreme Perfected. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Sixth Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the autumnal equinox, facing south, observe clouds of plain white, red, and yellow—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Supreme Perfected Lord of the Southern Culmen and the August Red Emperor. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Seventh Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the winter solstice’s onset, facing southwest, observe clouds of green, purple, and cyan—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Perfected Lord of the Supreme Clarity and the Imperial Ancestor. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

The **Eighth Dao Register of Destiny**: At dawn of the winter solstice, facing due east, observe clouds of vermilion, azure, and yellow—these are the *Three Primordial Clouds* of the Jade Consort of the Great Empyrean and the Supreme Perfected of the Great Void. The rites of visualization, obeisance, and secret incantation follow the method above.

On the days of the Eight Dao Registers, one or two days prior, bathe, burn incense, and await the appointed time. At the proper hour, go forth to gaze for the duration of a meal, then return indoors. If overcast or rainy, do not gaze. Should these clouds appear unexpectedly on other days, perform the rites and incantations as above—this is thrice as efficacious as on the appointed day.

For all past and present transgressions—whether from former lives or this life, sins unresolved, apologies unaccepted, pardons delayed, merits difficult to advance, demonic trials unrecognized, leading to setbacks, premature aging, and elusive ascension—once departed, one lingers in unseen suffering without end. Disciples of the higher studies, awaken to this with alarm! Swear devotion, yearn for the mysterious, and penetrate the numinous. By obtaining the Dao Registers, you decisively sever the roots of sin, untie the knots of evil, and nourish the wellspring of goodness. No demon dares intrude, and swift attainment of Perfection is assured. Sincerely cultivate in secret, and verification will soon follow.

For all absolutions of sin, first conduct a purification fast. On the days of the Eight Dao Registers, maintain purity of body and mind. Without like-minded companions, do not rashly partake in the Great Dao. The divine Perfected, immortals male and female, constantly gather in the Mystic Capital, observing long fasts and pure assemblies. They transform countless beings through the sincerity of their forms and propagate karmic deeds to aid the living. The living are never without need, and responses must never lapse. Where responses never lapse, there are always methods of governance—such is the Terrace of the Jade Capital, the eternal site of response.

Life never ceases in death, nor death in life. Emerging into life and entering death, boundless and endless. Heaven and earth are innumerable, lands are infinite. Rebirth and death recur without pause, moment by moment. Arising and ceasing intermingle; being and non-being mutually constitute. Life is called "being," death is called "non-being." Yet non-being is not truly non-being, nor being truly being. Neither being nor non-being, eternally responsive and present, abiding without extinction, wisdom is inexhaustible.

Disciples of the higher studies, together return and hasten to this! The path to hastening lies in stages; entry comes through *qi*. Contemplate the divine, record the *qi*, practice the methods, and ascend the stages—this is called *fasting*. *Fasting* means *alignment*. Purify the heart and cleanse the body; body and heart respond in unison. Inner and outer harmonize, reverence is meticulous, devotion unwavering from beginning to end. Without negligence or omission, without carelessness or arrogance, one savors the Supreme Dao—hence it is called *fasting*. Fasting methods are manifold and cannot all be recorded. The Perfected transmit them orally, teaching one another. The scriptures contain their forms; here, only the essentials are outlined. Their adaptation and practice depend on the individual.

To study without fasting is labor in vain—like firewood without flame, like flame without transmission, like ascending heaven without a cloud-ladder, like flying without astral *qi*. Though one may exert oneself, how can the heart’s desire be fulfilled? Fulfillment must come through fasting; fasting’s stillness must entail repentance. Unwashed transgressions bar blessings; without blessings, calamity surely arrives. If calamity comes and cannot be averted, there is no means to become a Perfected Immortal. The Perfected and Immortals observe long fasts, accumulate contemplation over time, absolve manifold faults, sever misfortune and welcome fortune, amass blessings and deepen virtue. With virtue fulfilled, one enters the Dao, unites with the divine, and abides in eternal joy, free from suffering.

Those resolved to pursue this must cast off worldly dust, vow to conduct pure fasts, and employ the methods of the Three Origins. The method takes *guarding the One* as its essence, and the One takes tranquility as its home. This home lies within the human heart—it should be harmonious and compliant. The beauty of harmony and compliance is what people esteem. Yet to practice this is most difficult to expand, for sins past and present entangle, and demonic forces intrude, making attainment arduous. Urgently conduct fasts—morning, noon, and evening, or six times daily—great and small repentances and vows. The finest invocations and principles are explored herein.

After completing the fasts in sequence, perform almsgiving, rescue the distressed, aid the imperiled, secretly establish hidden merits, reform the heart and alter conduct, diligently cultivate yang virtues, and avoid known transgressions. Acknowledge faults and refrain from repeating them; if repeated, repent again. After three repentances, calamities dissolve and blessings arrive. If wishes remain unfulfilled, cultivate diligently without slackening. When aspirations and the Dao align, one may rest.

After three transgressions, further repentance is not accepted, and pardon is not granted. Clearly understand and be cautious. Before receiving the methods, the first category of calamities arises; after receiving them, the second category emerges; from birth onward, the third category persists. These three categories encompass manifold calamities of varying depths, which cannot all be recorded. Here, only the general outline is provided—apply it analogously to other cases.

From past lives to the present, from former incarnations to this body, though the span may be distant or near, the categories of transgressions remain the same. Yet by tracing their origins and dissolving them, one may perfect virtue through meritorious deeds.

Born into wealth and nobility, one may cultivate both the Dao and worldly affairs, moving through life in peace and security, accompanied by good fortune and joy. Some may take official service as their vocation, others trade and commerce as their means, still others farming and sericulture as their occupation, or fishing and hunting as their custom. Though these pursuits are mundane, one must neither indulge in excess nor steal, neither act in delusion nor sow disorder, nor recklessly interfere with others. Fathers do not mourn their sons, lords do not mourn their ministers, elder brothers do not mourn their younger siblings, masters do not mourn their disciples. The aged pass without illness, the young live free from affliction, serving one another. They send off the dead and welcome the newborn, offering condolences in misfortune and celebrating in joy—this is the state of middling equilibrium, yet few can preserve it.

The heavenly hosts rejoice in such harmony, yet if one ceases to accumulate merit, and the blessings of former lives are exhausted, one may still fall among the ill-fated. Therefore, the wise and discerning aspire to be born in a lower realm, follow a master to practice the Dao, transmit and receive teachings in succession, and attain immortality—living forever without death. This is called "superior study," its achievement surpassing the middling path.

Only those who rise from the middling may ascend to superior study, for the methods of superior study are not to be debated by the common or base.

**First Category: Frequent Bereavement**
The deaths of grandparents, father, master, or lord, as well as close kin and family—whether elders or juniors, beyond the bounds of natural calamity or fate—bring mourning upon oneself, and thus share the same affliction. The transgression arises from disobedience, rebellion against superiors, and encouraging others in such acts without repentance. To dissolve this, use gold and silk to purchase many living beings, feed and release them, each to its proper place.

**Second Category: Chronic Illness from Infancy**
Born with frequent illness, recovery brings suffering to the household and oneself alike, both falling into the third category. The transgression arises from a lack of benevolence, harming living beings with qi, mocking others’ afflictions, and cursing them with illness. To dissolve this, prepare wine and medicine, and place them at night along thoroughfares, marketplaces, and places of destitution.

**Third Category: Entanglement in Public and Private Affairs**
Though not one’s own fault, one is unjustly implicated, whether noble or base, male or female, close or distant kin—all become entangled.

**Fourth Category: Strife and Litigation**
The transgression arises from a lack of gentleness, delighting in conflict and inciting lawsuits, restraining and confining creatures of the air and water, caging and binding living beings. To dissolve this, use paper, brushes, cinnabar, ink, and knives, bestowing them upon whomever one encounters—no need to explain the reason.

**Fifth Category: Slander and Gossip**
Whether ordained or lay, one spreads defamation and hearsay, engages in groundless disputes over blind texts, and stirs empty, baseless strife. The transgression arises from a refusal to accept counsel, treating kin and strangers with equal coldness, broadcasting others’ faults, and defying admonitions. To dissolve this, prepare rice, soup, broth, fish, meat, fruits, and vegetables, and place them along thoroughfares—no need to observe who partakes.

**Sixth Category: Encounters with Bandits**
In public or private travels, whether dwelling in mountains or the world, one suffers assault, coercion, plunder, or injury from violent men. The transgression arises from a lack of compassion, seizing and plundering all things, harming both humans and spirits, and indulging one’s desires for personal gain. To dissolve this, use treasures, bamboo, tiles, grass, earth, and bricks to repair and protect lodgings, altering ritual implements.

**Seventh Category: Failure in Scholarship**
Externally, one studies the classics, histories, philosophers, anthologies, maps, and books; internally, one practices sacred texts, esoteric methods, and essential techniques. Yet one loathes to seek knowledge, whether seen or unseen, and though one reads and recites, nothing is mastered—years pass in vain. The transgression arises from a lack of integrity, defiling body and mind, violating the decorum of teachers and friends, envying others’ talents, and corrupting the *Book of Changes* and scriptures. To dissolve this, use oil, firewood, charcoal, torches, and candles to hand-copy scriptures and diagrams, encouraging and aiding like-minded practitioners.

**The above six items, ranked in three grades, encompass ninety-nine thousand nine hundred and ninety transgressions.**

**Eighth Category: Demotion in Office**
Whether serving as ruler, minister, or official, one is dismissed for incompetence while in office, or though possessing some virtue, suffers unjust demotion and returns home, relegated to remote posts and reduced to poverty. The transgression arises from a lack of propriety, usurping rank and feigning authority, arrogantly defying the three courts, and oppressing the four regions. To dissolve this, use brooms and dustpans, secretly delivering them to others’ homes, sweeping paths morning and evening—let no one know.

**Ninth Category: Childlessness or Many Daughters**
Though a wife or concubine has been with one for years, no son is born; if a boy arrives, he dies, while daughters survive. The transgression arises from a lack of obedience, defying superiors, severing others’ bloodlines, and colluding in licentiousness. To dissolve this, cast gold, silver, pearls, and jade into flowing water, making offerings to childless kin and worthy predecessors to continue the lineage of Dao and virtue.

**Tenth Category: Miscarriage and Infant Loss**
A wife or concubine conceives, but the fetus is harmed and miscarried; or the child lives for ten days, or even a few years. The transgression arises from a lack of restraint, carelessly engaging in intercourse, harming another’s pregnancy, and making both public and private imprecations. To dissolve this, offer fragrant oil, golden *ruyi* scepters, tables, mats, and bamboo sleeping mats to healing abodes.

**Eleventh Category: Jealousy Between Husband and Wife**
Whether husband and wife or master and concubine, their union is immoderate, fostering mutual suspicion and jealousy, causing discord within and without. The transgression arises from a lack of chastity, engaging in affairs, prizing one’s own beauty, and resenting others’ attractiveness. To dissolve this, distribute five-colored ink and five-hued silks along the road, regardless of wealth or status.

**Twelfth Category: Humiliation of High and Low**
Kings fall to rebels, ministers encounter bandits, the ordained and laity meet with misfortune, suffering insults and beatings on the road. The transgression arises from a lack of uprightness, abandoning good for evil, reversing proper roles between men and women, and defiling purity. To dissolve this, secretly deliver incense burners, cosmetic boxes, and bronze or iron vessels to the wilderness, aiding others in marriage and encouraging vegetarian feasts and gatherings.

**Thirteenth Category: Harm from Water, Fire, Insects, Birds, Ghosts, and Multitudes of Disasters**
Whether dwelling or traveling, in mountains, waters, or roads, one suffers calamities where nurture turns to harm. The transgression arises from a lack of righteousness, slaughtering and butchering, violating the intimacy of ruler, teacher, and elders, and inciting internal strife. To dissolve this, cast caps, robes, chests, tables, knives, and spoons into mountains, waters, or along roads in court and countryside.

**The above six items, ranked in three grades, encompass thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty transgressions.**

**Fourteenth Category: Unintentional Loss**
Scriptures, treasures, money, grain, cloth, servants, and slaves vanish without cause. The transgression arises from a lack of discipline, indulging in laziness, refusing others’ requests, and stealing for personal gain. To dissolve this, deliver glue, lacquer, locks, and keys to healing abodes.

**Fifteenth Category: Drunkenness and Forgetfulness**
In recitation and speech, one forgets what came before and loses what follows, spreading perverse and erroneous tales. The transgression arises from a lack of caution, treating confusion as clarity, neglecting the recitation of scriptures and precepts, and carelessly incurring faults. To dissolve this, deliver mirrors and assorted hides to healing abodes.

**Sixteenth Category: Remote and Desolate Dwellings**
One resides in humble alleys within the central lands, or in border towns and barbarian regions, amid perilous mountains and treacherous waters. The transgression arises from a lack of resolve, flattering and fawning to favor one’s own kin while harming others’ dwellings. To dissolve this, scatter knives, axes, saws, chisels, hammers, drills, nails, and stakes along the road.

**Seventeenth Category: Blessings Turning to Misfortune**
One performs vegetarian feasts and almsgiving, yet provokes disputes and offenses, suffers robbery and calamity, or incurs harm from humans and ghosts. The transgression arises from a lack of understanding, defying the Three Honored Ones, falsely invoking spirits and ghosts, and making reckless divinations and dream interpretations. To dissolve this, fashion golden dragons and jade fish, entwining them with bamboo slips, and cast them into mountains and waters.

**Eighteenth Category: Good Deeds Inviting Evil**
One intends good for others, yet they suspect ill; what one advises turns to resentment, and one is scorned, mocked, and resented, fostering deep, empty grudges. The transgression arises from a lack of wisdom, mistaking folly for cunning, slandering the Dao of teachers, and forcing a reputation for virtue. To dissolve this, light lamps—ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand—matching the number of days to one’s capacity.

**Nineteenth Category: Success Turning to Failure**
In matters of Dao and the world, whether constructing, establishing, or creating, whether public or private undertakings, though logic dictates success, they are ruined by humans or ghosts. The transgression arises from a lack of clarity, acting with hesitation and obstruction, pursuing selfish ends, and sabotaging others’ accomplishments. To dissolve this, provide servants, carriages, oxen, boats, lamps, and abundant offerings to healing abodes.

**The above six items, ranked in three grades, encompass seventy-seven thousand seven hundred and seventy transgressions.**

**Twentieth Category: Gains Lost Again**
In matters of Dao and the world, whether public or private, what one seeks, sees, or obtains clearly may vanish in an instant or over time, leaving no trace. The transgression arises from a lack of purity, recklessly accepting things, concealing illicit affairs, and bestowing favors only to later regret them. To dissolve this, distribute one’s own clothing and belongings along the road, giving them to whomever one meets—ask not whether they are in need.

**Twentieth Category: Being Envied by Others**
Those with talent and virtue, who attain rank and wealth, drawing people to them, may incur envy and resentment. The transgression arises from inequity, forming cliques at will, seeking to surpass others, and suppressing the worthy and wise. To dissolve this, offer wooden sandals, bedframes, and curtains to all those of the Dao—whether known or unknown—giving whenever encountered.

**Twenty-First Category: Being Suspected by Others**
As one’s Dao, reputation, and rank advance daily, whether concealing brilliance or guarding constancy, others may harbor groundless suspicion and jealousy. The transgression arises from disloyalty, deceiving both the hidden and the manifest, breaking myriad vows, and misleading or ruining the good. To dissolve this, provide cold jars and basins, along with combs and bathing implements, and send them to healing abodes.

**Twenty-Second Category: Being Afflicted by Ghosts**
One may suddenly see ghosts approach, engaging in union with men or women, or spewing foul and vile curses without self-awareness. The transgression arises from faithlessness, deceitful pretenses, illicit sacrifices that distort truth, and alarming the common people. To dissolve this, use peach-wood talismans and inscribed boards, carving and purifying them, then present them with vermilion mats, sending them to healing abodes.

**Twenty-Third Category: Being Possessed by Evil**
One may suddenly behave strangely, or amid illness and suffering, see disturbing visions, seek truth in vain, and though no harm manifests, the influence of evil grows daily. The transgression arises from impropriety, blending Dao with worldly customs, mingling men and women indiscriminately, and confusing humans and spirits. To dissolve this, offer scripture pedestals, halls, bedframes, curtains, desks, headscarves, hats, kitchenware, and chests, sending them to healing abodes.

**Twenty-Fourth Category: Failing Trials Beyond Measure**
Teachers, friends, or demonic forces may impose unforeseen trials—matters one has never encountered, which ought to be rejected—yet one now deems them good, stirring the mind and consciousness. The transgression arises from lack of focus, superficial learning, hasty expectations, delayed disillusionment, and leaking sacred teachings. To dissolve this, offer oneself in service to one’s teacher, then construct a healing abode, personally tending incense and lamps, sweeping and cleansing with utmost devotion, and establishing teachings for future generations.

**The above six items, ranked in three grades, encompass thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty transgressions.**

**In total, there are twenty-four categories, comprising four sets of six. The three eights lie within them, encompassing all conditions—great and small, doubtful and certain, right and wrong, tangled in deliberation—all are clarified and rectified here. Through repentance and gratitude, they are dissolved and released. What is offered and dispersed must be given with utmost sincerity, without regret or reluctance, and great fortune will swiftly arrive. If not using gold or silk, one must exert mind and body, calculating labor and time, estimating worth by the day. Those who give without reckoning do so by their own will; if others cannot bear it, whether rich or poor, take the middle path—what matters is the absence of stinginess. Stinginess leads to relapse, and three relapses leave no recourse.**

The Lord of the Azure Youth of the Eastern Sea addressed the Perfected One of Square Cauldron, saying: *"Your responsiveness and transformation of sentient beings—those with aspirations must be encouraged and guided. Transmit this teaching with utmost secrecy and care. Past transgressions need not be recounted; from this day forward, correct yourself according to these principles. After repentance and gratitude, minor calamities will dissolve at once. For major calamities not yet dispelled, hasten to avoid them. Where you flee, observe the celestial patterns, gazing above and below, with precision and without disclosure. As the celestial texts foretell, great calamities must be eradicated, and in eradicating calamities, fortune is summoned—this begins with this scripture. This scripture’s essential method is treasured both within and without, revered by all sages, its fragrance enduring without end. The Two Perfected Lords guarded this in utmost secrecy; Wei Huacun received the decree and practiced it with efficacy, later transmitting it to the solitary and reclusive. Few have cultivated this text, and fewer still attained perfection. Only through the mysterious names and illustrated registers may one obtain it. The highest serves as the state’s teacher, the middle as a teacher among the people, and the lowest cultivates the self to become a teacher—these are the three grades."*

**The Upper Scroll of the Supreme Perfected’s Scripture of the Eightfold Dao’s Register of Life Concludes**

**The Lower Scroll of the Supreme Perfected’s Scripture of the Eightfold Dao’s Register of Life**

The Great Dao of the Supreme, its *qi* pervading the ten directions, governs human movement and stillness through the eight alone. The four cardinal directions and four diagonals belong to the upper and lower; the lower and upper directions encompass and unify the eight. The eight trigrams’ true spirits enact the eight *qi*, with the Great One as their master, and the Three Origins flowing in circulation. This circulation extends among humans, where paths exist within the spaces. These paths connect to the virtuous—those with jade tablets may wander freely, exiting through the eight gates, guided and roaming, reaching the ten directions. The sacred multitudes of the ten directions all depart through the eight gates; the *Eightfold Dao’s Register of Life* records all that the sages practice. In transforming and aiding the good, the sun is yang and the moon yin; hidden virtue secretly connects, linking to the wondrous teachings of the spirits. These are the secrets of the sages and perfected, guarded with strictest discipline. Without dissolving transgressions, one cannot perceive or hear them; hearing and perceiving without understanding, or understanding without practicing, or practicing without efficacy—all is labor in vain, increasing faults. Yet if one possesses utmost sincerity, meditating deeply on the mysterious, one will surely dissolve transgressions, behold this scripture, comprehend its matters, and obtain great fortune. Following its cultivation, efficacy will manifest, and perfection will be achieved.

**The Method of Repentance and Gratitude**
Cultivate the Dharma-body alone. If there are like-minded companions, two or three, up to nine, but no more. If by good fortune and karmic conditions, many worthy and wise gather beyond nine, form a separate repentance assembly—do not forcibly combine, lest you offend the Nine Heavens, seeking fortune only to invite misfortune. Let each be cautious.

When teachers or friends face illness or hardship and cannot personally perform repentance, fellow students or aspirants may act on their behalf, alone or with companions, but never exceeding nine. The Dharma-teacher, reciter, repentance supervisor, scripture attendant, incense attendant, lamp attendant, and tablet bearer must all follow the proper method.

**The Practice of the Eightfold Dao**
Observe the four seasons, six affairs, eight solar terms, five phases, twenty-four qi, the virtues of faith and earthly works, encompassing both inner and outer—thus, there are no longer repentances for the four seasons.

**In performing mutual repentance, none may accept the offerings of the host’s refined altar in four categories.** Upon concluding the repentance and gratitude, the four categories of offerings are to be distributed in silence, without others’ awareness.

When questioned, respond with appropriate expedience. Should there be alms offered, one may say it is "presented in devotion"; if the recipient declines out of humility, do not press or harbor suspicion, but instead offer it to another who may accept. There is no need to inform others whether it was received or not.

**The Method of Concluding the Repentance Ritual**
Applies universally to the Three Origins, though the number of days varies: nine in spring, three in summer, seven in autumn, and five in winter. Day and night, one practices the Dao, observing the six periods and three times of dawn. Offerings of dried vegetables, fruits, and grains are made according to each person’s means.

Before the appointed days, sweep and purify both inner and outer spaces, arrange ritual implements, and prepare fresh and refined offerings—never hastily fulfilling requirements at the last moment. Boundaries must be strictly observed, and no clamor or disorder permitted. Those engaged in the ritual fast must not leave the premises; if they do, they may not return, and if they return, they must reside separately, taking care not to intrude upon the ritual space.

For messengers from outside, they are to remain at the gate to relay messages. Those inside shall interpret, first rinsing their mouths with water before speaking and again afterward—this must not be neglected. Arrange the altar, courtyard, halls, and chambers with beds, curtains, tables, incense vessels, mats, wells, screens, and hangings, ensuring all is clean, secure, and complete. The kitchen, well, stove, bathhouse, and latrines must all be suffused with fine incense to prevent foul qi from spreading and defiling the dwelling.

Each latrine must be designated for specific use—sitting or lying down—without overlap. High and low must not intermingle, lest all incur calamity. To prevent misfortune and seek blessings, one must exercise utmost caution.

On the evening of the ritual assembly, some may eat while others do not; beverages and medicines vary, but all must bathe alike. Even for prolonged fasts, bathing remains essential. Adjust words and intentions, announce one’s presence at the hour of rest, enter the chamber with solemn purity, and follow the usual morning rites.

When performing the Great Repentance and reciting the text, a chanter shall intone the names and titles. The Dharma-teacher strikes the teeth thirty-six times, then kneels and holds the text as follows:

*Great Mystery Capital Three Caverns Dharma-teacher, [Name] of [Sacred Peak], Lesser Self Perfected of the Three Luminaries, disciple practicing the Great Cavern Scripture. If not yet received into the Three Caverns, simply state: Disciple of the Supreme Mystery Capital Jade Capital Purple Palace Celestial Chamber Three Luminaries, Great Cavern Dharma-teacher, Lesser Self Perfected, [Name] of [Sacred Peak], Lady [Name].*

*[Names of Lords, Ministers, Concubines, and Servants], reverently address the Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Three Origins Supreme Perfected August Elders, the Highest Celestial Capital High August Jade Emperor, the Nine Mysteries Dao Lord, the Boundless Heavenly Worthy, the Supreme Cavern Mystery Natural Vacant Sovereign, the Five Directions and Five Emperors, the Flying Immortals of the Five Peaks, the Jade Bureau and Golden Towers, and all divine officials. Your humble servant, [Name], unworthy and foolish, has presumptuously received the Supreme Dao, filled with joy and gratitude, yet also trembling with awe and shame. Unable to devote myself fully to the wondrous Dharma or swiftly ascend to immortality, I have drifted through the worldly realm, accumulating faults and transgressions. Days and months pass swiftly, but life is fleeting. I constantly fear sudden demise, never to return, and am struck with sorrow, my heart and viscera rent with pain. I rely upon your mysterious compassion to bestow mercy and protection.*

*Now, in this era of purgation, I have fortunately encountered the path to deathlessness. Though my polluted body has long forgotten its sins, I vow to aspire to the arts of longevity. Prostrating before the Eightfold Dao’s register of destinies and the Eightfold Essential Texts, gazing upon the Three Primes, I honor the Eight Venerables. Through the repentance ritual, I seek to untangle the coils of sin, disperse past and future calamities, and attain immortality. Undeterred by my worthless existence, I pledge to cultivate this practice. If acting on behalf of another, state: "Now there is a teacher, friend, esteemed lord, elder, parent, child, or disciple [Name], who has received this Dharma. Due to illness, hardship, or worldly obligations, they cannot perform the ritual themselves. Through your servants’ entreaty, we focus our minds as prescribed, united in purpose and daring to present these words on their behalf, reverently reciting them for your hearing."*

*In accordance with the rites, we have prepared offerings and secretly adhered to the essential instructions. With purified hearts and solemn words, we reverently recite for your hearing.*

*[Name], Daoist Disciple and Libationer of [State, Commandery, Village], disciple of the [Cavern] School, your humble servant [Name], aged [X] years, of [X] household members, currently residing at [Location], prostrates in repentance, seeking grace and pardon. Those joining in this entreaty shall list their village, rank, and names.*

*Your humble servant [Name], base and foolish, a mere sprout of the earth, has fortunately, through good karma, received the wondrous Dharma and bears the profound and boundless debt of mysterious grace. Yet, born and raised in the vulgar world, I have grown accustomed to evil and wasted time, accumulating faults in movement and stillness, day and night. Though I have received scriptures and precepts, I have failed to cultivate them. Now, in this era of disasters and poisons, facing the time of purgation, I fear becoming mere dust, struck with sorrow and dread. Like the sparrow and mouse, I cling to life; like the mayfly and reed, I yearn to live. Undeterred by my polluted state, I dare to seek the blessings of advancement.*

*On [Date] at [Location], I received from the Dharma-teacher [Name] the [Scripture/Precept], essential methods, wondrous arts, secret texts, and treasured instructions, totaling [X] volumes in [X] bundles. Or, in the year of [Celestial Stem] under the reign of [Year], on [Date] at [Location], due to [Circumstance], I obtained [X] volumes. On [Date] at [Location], I entered the Mysterious Covenant.*

*Filled with joy and delight, I vowed to uphold and practice them, hoping to fulfill my long-held wishes. On [Date] at [Location], I suddenly fell ill with [Disease], or encountered [Public/Private Calamity], as the case may be. Anxious and fearful, I worried for my survival. Or, I was born sickly, impoverished, and distressed, orphaned young or solitary in old age, forsaken by heaven and man—[describe circumstances]. Truly, my past sins run deep, and my present transgressions are grave, bringing this misfortune upon me. Ashamed and terrified, I dare not complain.*

*Upon reflection, my sinful self deserves annihilation; how dare I presume to trouble your hearing? Yet, relying upon your mysterious compassion, which embraces all dust and filth, bestows goodness, and perfects even the slightest merit, I humbly purify my heart and body, fast, and prostrate in repentance. I beg for renewed grace, the profound mercy of triple forgiveness, the dissolution of disasters and illnesses, the resolution of official matters, the restoration of balance, and the extension of my years. I vow never to transgress again, to reform and renew myself, to cultivate the Dharma I have received, and to attain the limit of immortality’s seed. May I now receive your inscription and bear the grace of your perfecting mercy.*

With reverent words, I hereby declare:

On the [day] of the [month], in the year of the [celestial stem] under the Great Year [Tai Sui], at the hour of [zodiac sign], in the mountain lodge of [village], [district], [county], [prefecture], I, [name], humbly present my earnest plea, beseeching your compassion and grace. Grant what I have requested, fulfill what I have prayed for—absolve my sins and bestow blessings, let the Dao and virtue flourish, let merits and deeds be accomplished, and may I surely attain the state of divine immortality.

I diligently recite the precepts and observe the secret teachings, subduing the thousand demons and securing the protection of the ten thousand spirits. The Nine Perfected Envoys shall transmit my supplication, presenting it directly before the throne of the Jade Emperor of the Nine Mysteries. At dawn, I shall perform the Daoist rites and once more submit my plea.

When the invocation is complete, I rise and circumambulate, reciting the Three Stanzas of Wisdom. Upon finishing, I face north and bow in reverence to the ten directions. Then, proceeding eastward to face west, I recite the Seven Retributions and Seven Harms, and chant the Great Precepts of Bodily Observation. For those not yet familiar, I hold the text and read aloud.

**The Seven Retributions are as follows:**

The Perfected One says: Embracing yin and holding yang, causes and conditions differ; forsaking death to attain life, karmic retribution varies. Good begets good, evil begets evil—like a shadow following form, not a hair’s breadth in error.

Good and evil are manifold, and their blessings and retributions innumerable. Speaking broadly, their manifestations number seven:

1. In a former life, one performed meritorious deeds and spread virtue, delivering and saving all beings. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall be reborn in a hall of blessings, transcend the Eight Difficulties, receive human felicity, and enjoy the natural rewards of heaven.

2. In a former life, one was devoted to learning, aspired to divine immortality, revered the mysterious precepts, and held the sacred scriptures in faith. One repented of evil and embraced goodness, establishing practices to enter the realm of the Perfected. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall be received by the Thearchs, one’s name inscribed on the Purple Tablets, and ascend to the Jade Dawn.

3. In a former life, one delighted in the Dao, unafraid of hardship or cold, serving one’s master with diligence, prioritizing labor, enduring hunger and thirst without complaint. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall ride the flying plow, roam and feast upon the Five Peaks, and traverse the void like drifting mist.

4. In a former life, one was pure and chaste, neither licentious nor deceitful, neither greedy nor desirous, unmoved by beauty, with a heart like dead ashes, firmly rooted in the source of the Dao. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall be rewarded with the company of numinous beings, transcend the Three Paths, and avoid the Five Sufferings.

5. In a former life, one performed good deeds, wishing for universal prosperity, that all might ascend and transcend the Eight Difficulties. Though others did not suffer, one could not bear one’s own comfort, giving away one’s own garments to relieve the destitute and cold, sharing food with crows, and leaving offerings in desolate mountains. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, the Four Administrations shall praise one’s virtue, moving the Jade Emperor to inscribe one’s name on the Purple Tablets and elevate one to the rank of Perfected Immortal.

6. In a former life, one was loyal and filial, reverently serving one’s elders and superiors, honoring those more accomplished, and respecting one’s teachers and lords. One’s heart and eyes were in harmony, as if one body, free from jealousy or careless speech. One’s inner and outer conduct were aligned, every movement in accord with the Perfected. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall be received by numinous beings, avoid the Three Paths, transcend the Eight Difficulties, and enjoy the mutual infusion of goodness and blessings. Such is the retribution—how could the Dao ever fail one?

7. In this life, one is wicked, harboring malice and deceit, attacking one’s teachers, slandering sacred texts, disdaining the numinous scriptures, and doubting the Two Heavenly Perfected Ones. Outwardly, one feigns goodness, seeking vain glory, speaking with a forked tongue, acting contrary to the source of the Dao. One steals scriptures without swearing an oath, recklessly divulging secret formulas, and spreading false teachings. If one’s conduct in this life remains unchanged, one shall violate the precepts and transgress taboos, falling into the source of sin. One’s seven ancestors shall suffer calamity, and one’s destitute soul shall be held accountable. Upon death, one shall endure torment, feed on fire, tread upon mountains, and suffer the Three Paths and Five Agonies for ten thousand kalpas without reprieve. In the dark of the netherworld, one’s body shall be lashed with pain.

Those who wish to cultivate and learn must carefully study this text, reform evil, and practice goodness to swiftly ascend as divine immortals.

**The Seven Harms are as follows:**

The Perfected One says: In learning, one must harmonize the Six Directions and beware of the Seven Harms.

1. The first harm: outwardly embracing the Perfected while inwardly acting falsely, indulging in lust and dissipating one’s spirit. One’s ethereal soul leaks, essence and light wither, qi scatters, and the corporeal soul disperses. One’s bones hollow, one’s form trembles, and the spirits weep in the exhausted palaces. This is heard at the Gate of Heaven, and the Perfected Immortals flee far away. One then forms karmic ties with the mundane world, becoming akin to the Earthly Bureau. How can one ever attain immortality?

2. The second harm: outwardly appearing to follow the Dao, with a demeanor of reverence for the Perfected, yet inwardly harboring malice, allowing wickedness to fester. One wishes for others’ ruin, envies the capable, and resents the worthy. One’s speech is fair, but one’s heart is perverse; one’s face is joyful, but one’s heart is wrathful. One judges others’ gains and losses, recklessly creates the source of sin, slanders fellow students, and attacks one’s teacher’s foundation. The Three Offices record this, marking one as an evil portal. The Perfected Immortals depart, and demonic forces assail one’s body, causing one’s form to wander and one’s spirit to scatter. Thus, one suffers unjust calamities, reaching the depths of evil. When one’s allotted years are exhausted, one’s form turns to ash, and one is extinguished in the Nine Springs. Though one may have a name in the mysterious records, how can one preserve one’s natural state?

3. The third harm: drinking to utter intoxication, damaging one’s qi and dissipating one’s spirit. The Five Palaces collapse, and the ten thousand spirits are startled. One’s ethereal and corporeal souls scatter, and one’s inner and outer being decay. One’s original chamber is left empty, and the Red Child wails in sorrow. The Perfected Immortals depart, and demonic forces enter one’s form. Such learning only wastes one’s essence and sincerity. Though one may have a name in the mysterious records, one’s jade-like reputation is lost in vain. One’s spirit ascends to the Upper Palace, while one’s body turns to ash in the dark netherworld. Though one may linger in a state of confusion, how can one endure for long?

4. The fourth harm: failing to respect others, disparaging one’s teachers and masters, harboring resentment in one’s heart and expressing it in speech, cursing and reviling without restraint. One’s anger and joy lack moderation, and one’s temperament is perverse. One’s qi surges, and one’s spirit scatters; one’s inner Perfected flees, and one’s corporeal soul departs. The nine orifices gather dust, and the Five Palaces flee in disarray—all due to one’s impure nature and inauspicious conduct. The Perfected Immortals depart, and external afflictions enter one’s form. With such learning, what can one hope to gain? Though one may possess the mysterious charts, one cannot escape this calamity. The days of aspiring to immortality grow distant, while the netherworld’s trials lengthen.

The fifth harm: when one’s mysterious charts are revealed or one receives precious scriptures, or when one encounters a numinous master who imparts divine texts—yet fails to follow the precepts and covenants, outwardly leaking celestial perfection, and before completing nine years of practice, presents petitions to sacred mountains, causing the Azure Palace to record one’s name and the Golden Tower to compile one’s deeds, then transmits these to others, scattering them among the world—such reckless disclosure of the true and leakage of the sacred will bring retribution upon oneself. Though one may bear a transcendent name, it will instead burden the Seven Mysteries. The Dao of immortality ascends on high, while one’s body perishes in the nether springs, forever consigned to ghostly reckoning, never to be absolved through ten thousand kalpas.

The sixth harm: when the body lingers in defilement and impurity, the numinous barrier loses its radiance, the Five Spirits scatter and flee, the Red Child soars away, and demonic forces assail one from within and without—both inner and outer are lost. With such learning, one’s aspirations to attainment only invite harm. The Perfected Immortals ascend in solitude, while one sinks into turbid chaos, and immortality remains forever beyond reach.

The seventh harm: consuming the flesh of the six livestock, slaughtering creatures with hooves and mouths for their savor, filling the viscera with foul qi, inflicting death’s punishment upon the innocent, disturbing the true qi at the numinous gate, startling the wandering spirits of the Red Child, causing the hun and po to wander the chambers, and clogging the mouth and teeth with turbid stagnation. The Perfected Immortals ascend to the Jade Clarity, while one’s own body founders in the earthly realm. Though one may bear a transcendent name in the Emperor’s records, this will not exempt one from inevitable death.

The Most High Sagely Thearch declares: The foundation of learning lies in urgently guarding against the seven harms. Once one has gazed upon the gates of the cavern-heavens and perused the jade scriptures, if one does not transgress the prohibitions of the seven harms, one may sit and await the descent of the numinous, ascending at dawn into the light of day.

If one toils externally in study yet fails to dispel the seven harms within, this will lead to attainment turning into failure, life into death, fortune into misfortune, and flight into sinking. The numinous immortals wander the lofty clarity, while the Five Spirits scatter to the eight wilds. The Red Child wails within the central chamber, and the wandering soul laments in the dark emptiness.

Thus, the path to immortality has its successes and failures, and superior learning entails the seven harms. Those who earnestly revere the Dao must thoroughly refine their true nature.

All who are divinely endowed and aligned with the charts, whose jade embryos dwell in the Purple Void, whose names are inscribed in the Eastern Florescence—having beheld the text on the examination of the seven harms—if they possess no such endowment, may not rashly peruse the numinous scriptures or casually view the sacred texts. Those who encounter this text are of a nature harmonious with transcendence; after nine years of cultivation, they may attain flight through the mysterious void and ascend to the Jade Clarity of the Highest Heaven.

Recite the precepts beginning from the fifth, proceeding in order to the end and then returning to the start, completing one cycle at the fourth, without reading the prefaces or postscripts. As the text is lengthy and not repeated, refer to separate scrolls when reciting.

Upon completing the recitation of the precepts, rise and approach the lamp, strike the teeth three times, and silently recite the Lamp-Brightening Incantation three times:

The Most High scatters light in the ten directions,
Flowering lamps convey sincerity.
All heavens blaze resplendent,
All earths shine with clarity.
My body, too, becomes luminous,
The five viscera blossom with splendor.
Fiery radiance illumines the Great Void,
Far-reaching thoughts flourish in the Jade Clarity.

Cinnabar essence abides in the Great Origin,
Mysterious intestines resound in emptiness.
Embracing form, eradicating the roots of suffering,
Contemplating the profound and true.
Hanging blossoms reveal no substance,
Causal conditions manifest as light and image.
My body is likewise transformed,
Riding transformation, entrusting to the flowing radiance.

Night’s light reveals the yang elixir,
Shining brightly in the numinous chamber.
All lamps universally radiate brilliance,
All yin is extinguished.
My spirit, too, becomes keen and bright,
Ever delighting in wisdom and insight.
Carefree, I follow the Dao’s course,
Changing and yielding to heaven’s decree.

Raising my form, I tread the empty cavern,
Night’s candle gleams with flowing splendor.

When the incantation is finished, turn from west to east, return the incense burner, and recite the incantation to clear the throat before retiring to the chamber, observing all movements as in the morning rites.

At dawn the next day, at the hour of *chou*, rise with solemn purity. At the hour of *yin*, ascend the platform to the door, clear the throat, recite the incantation, and visualize the master—all as in the morning rites.

For those who have not taken a worldly master and seek to invoke the mysterious covenant, visualize the Azure Lad of the Mysterious Master in the Palace of the Square Cauldron, beseeching his descent and manifestation, □ the secret of longevity, and swift attainment of immortality, that the dissemination of transformation may be boundless.

Upon completing the visualization of the master, close the eyes, strike the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

Before the Great Demon King of the Northern Thearch,
Before the Lord Who Receives Affairs,
Ghosts of the Yellow Springs’ bends,
The Four Luminaries of Mount Feng,
A thousand demons mingling forms,
Nine-headed beings sharing one body,
Divine tigers releasing venom,
Decapitating with thunderous might,
True tones of the divine lords,
Uttering curses of execution,
No kinship with the Great Tenuity,
Yet by command they seize and record.
Mountains and rivers ring with bells,
Intertwining radiance flows and flashes.
Nine heavens’ winds and fires,
Wield the divine blades of subjugation.
Ten trials of the inauspicious,
Subduing and extinguishing the myriad spirits.
Should any demonic toxin dare rise,
It shall be sealed within the Three Passes.
I invoke the cavernous laws—
Let none disobey these words.

Upon completion, strike the teeth thirty-six times again, open the incense burner, and strike the teeth once more.

When the incense burner is opened, kneel facing north (or sit slightly), strike the teeth thirty-six times, and summon the officials:

With reverence, I summon from within the body of your servant [Name]—from the four limbs, five constituents, Jade Gate, Purple Chamber, and thirty-nine portals of the Upper Perfected—
the numinous officials of the left and right flying immortals,
the Jade Clarity Attendants,
the Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primordial August Perfected,
the Flying Dragon Merit Clerks,
the Divine Immortal Envoys—
thirty-six of each.

The Jade Clarity Attendants wield the feathered tablets of the flying immortals, their nine-colored banners illuminating the heavens;
The Five Emperors and Five-Colored Primordial August Perfected hold the life-controlling demonic banners of the Five Emperors;
The Flying Dragon Merit Clerks, adorned in feathered robes and golden true phoenix insignia;

the countless Highest August Perfected of the Dao,
the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless—
the qi of the natural Mysterious Capital’s Primordial August.

The Lesser Manifestation Perfected of the Three Radiant Caverns of the Great Cavern,
Master of the Sacred Peak [Name], Lady Primordial of the [Name] Household,
and their servant-retinue—
born of defiled wombs in this kalpa of numinous fortune,
bound by karmic blessings to the wheel of dharma-gates,
we have attained human birth.
By the grace of the Highest Void’s lingering radiance, bent to illumine our benighted minds,
we, with our foul and mortal frames, dare to lift our gaze and pore over the sacred texts.

The Dharma-Master, Daoist adepts, male and female Perfected—[Names]—
on the [day, month, year, hour] at [location],
conferred upon your servants [Names]
the Dragon-Script Phoenix-Chapters of the Nine Heavens of the Highest Mystery,
the Jade Tablets of the Three Clarities’ Treasure Texts—
in [number] scrolls, [number] talismans, [number] oral transmissions.
Some were received by our ancestors from their masters of the Supreme Clarity’s Treasure Scriptures,
passed down through generations.
Others, encountered by karmic affinity,
were obtained on the [day, month, year, hour] at [location].
We have venerated, studied, and perused them repeatedly,
consulting our revered masters to resolve doubts and obstructions.
Yet in some years, seeking a master, we could not meet one—
until the [day, month, year, hour] at [location], within the Mysterious Covenant,
we pledged to uphold and cultivate, fulfilling our heart’s vows.

Yet born and raised in the Five Turbidities,
we presumptuously aspire to the Three Clarities.
Our bodies tainted by defilements, days and months pass in vain;
we have not soared on radiant wings, nor floated through the Nine Mysteries,
but sink into the lower worlds.
Our deeds often transgress, precepts falter,
our conduct incurs faults—
the Four Offices seize us, binding us to the gates of karmic retribution.

Daring to rely on the sacred canon,
we receive the covenant of the Fast Texts and the Three Primordials’ Essential Oral Transmissions of the Three Grades of the Supreme Perfected,
which above correspond to the Nine Mysteries, conjoining the elixir to guard life;
in the middle, to the Six Harmonies, dissolving our own transgressions of precepts and karmic obstructions;
below, to the Three Powers, delivering the Seven Ancestors,
releasing the debts of the Nine Yin,
raising the dead to celestial rebirth.

This is the supreme and wondrous Dharma,
the root of seeking immortality.
We, your servants, [Names], greedy for the Dao and delighting in the Real,
vow to cultivate and practice.

Some recite scriptures and precepts,
or refine the elixir with precision.
For those not yet accomplished, we declare:
we intend to prepare medicinal substances,
the essential formulas of divine immortality,
to compound the divine elixir,
or to refine pills, powders, and alchemical wines.

Yet we fear that from the beginningless kalpas,
our karmic roots have been shallow,
our present merits still meager,
and the compounding may fail.
We dread that past and recent actions—
breaches of precepts, violations of scriptures—
cause obstructions in the unseen and manifest realms,
entangling us day by day,
unresolved,
our good intentions unfulfilled.
We tremble lest our myriad ancestors,
our seven generations of parents,
laden with heavy transgressions in life,
sink into the Three Wretched Paths,
wander through the Five Sufferings,
unable to ascend,
their residual calamities flowing down to later generations,
making it difficult to invoke the Perfected,
while demonic trials assail us easily.
Moreover, reviewing past and present,
our universal fasts and comprehensive repentances
have been tainted by insincerity,
unworthy of compassionate pardon.

Now, in accordance with the wondrous principles of the Eight Daoist Paths,
we sincerely repent our deep transgressions past and present,
weighing our thoughts and measuring our deeds.
Regarding the matter of [specific matter],
we humbly present [specific offering or act] as proof of our utmost sincerity.
Following the prescribed liturgy, we dare not profane the ears of the august ones—
our words echo those of former petitions.
With hearts sincere and supplications earnest,
we beseech your compassion:
this very day, enter the chamber,
ascend the fast, recite scriptures,
practice the Dao, visualize the master,
contemplate the Perfected, meditate on the Real,
burn incense, light lamps,
worship the Jade Heaven,
cultivate arts and compound medicines, and so forth.

We repent our sins, atone for transgressions,
redeem deep karmic debts,
establish merit,
deliver the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors,
our inner and outer departed kin,
dissolve karmic roots,
free them from the dark night,
ascend to the Southern Palace,
where wandering souls receive deliverance,
transforming their bodies to be born in heaven.
Or, abiding in the Dao’s gate, they may roam in blessed joy,
forming bonds with the Perfected,
flowing blessings and spreading grace to later generations,
so that your servants’ evil sins may be absolved,
and [Name]’s good deeds renewed and flourishing.

We implore the Highest and Boundless Heavenly Worthy
to deign to cast your radiance,
to witness the supplications of your servants [Names].
We entreat the Three Treasures,
the Immortal Attendant Gentlemen,
the Five Directions’ Five Thearchs,
the Inspectors of Numinous Powers,
the Supervisors of Fasts,
the Envoys of the Fast,
the Supreme Perfected of the True Fast,
the Divine Immortals, Flying Immortals, Celestial Immortals, Terrestrial Immortals,
the Sacred Peak Immortals of the Five Marchmounts,
and the nine hundred million myriad hosts of cavalry and chariots—
to descend as one,
to encamp and protect your servants’ bodies,
to extinguish demons and dispel trials,
to avert misfortune and repel calamities,
to summon the natural true qi of the Nine Heavens,
the golden liquid, elixir essence, and divine mushrooms,
to gather in the fast hall and altar,
illuminating your servants’ bodies,
with Jade Lads and Jade Maidens attending the incense smoke.

May your servants,
in practicing the Dao, attain the Dao;
in seeking immortality, attain immortality;
soar through the Great Void,
ascend on radiant wings to the Nine Heavens.
May their heartfelt vows and aspirations
become as real as the Three Treasures,
may the Seven Mysteries’ parents be delivered from the Three Wretched Paths,
the debts of the Nine Yin released,
the dead reborn in heaven,
all the heavens’ beings universally delivered.
May [Name]’s disasters dissolve in the Three Absences,
sins vanish in the Nine Yin,
a thousand transgressions and myriad faults
all receive compassionate pardon.
May [Name]’s sins be dispersed,
[Name]’s affairs flourish,
escaping the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties,
attaining divine immortality,
receiving the grace of the Supreme Perfected’s Eight Daoist Paths,
the Eight Venerables’ boundless and immeasurable salvation.

Upon completing the cultivation,
we shall report back to our original abodes,
humbly awaiting your transmission.
The rites concluded, we return,
facing east,
thrice offering incense,
and recite the incantation:

The Lesser Manifestation Perfected of the Three Radiant Caverns of the Great Cavern of the Supreme Mystery Capital,
Master of the Sacred Peak [Name],
Lady Primordial of the [Name] Household,
your servants [Names]—
today, in the fast and practice of the Dao,
contemplating the Perfected, meditating on the Real,
reciting scriptures and invoking vows,
we soar to the Nine Heavens,
sincerely repenting to the Three Primordials.
Burning incense and lighting lamps,
we dedicate this merit
to absolve your servants’ transgressions and dissolve entanglements,
sever the roots of death,
summon the true and real,
inscribe our names in the Supreme Clarity,
deliver the Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors,
our parents and departed kin,
cutting off the flow of calamities,
releasing the bound in darkness,
forever escaping hell,
ascending to the celestial halls,
freed from the Five Sufferings,
receiving blessings in the Southern Palace,
transforming to become Perfected,
benefiting and protecting the living.
We eradicate your servants’ thousand karmic roots and myriad past obstructions,
washing away [Name]’s sins,
fulfilling [Name]’s affairs.

Now we offer our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Supreme Nine Mysteries, the Primordial Jade Sovereign, the Jade Emperor, the Great Perfected of the Pure Land of Yu Shan, the Heavenly King of the Immeasurable Realm, the Heavenly King of Infinite Longevity in the Uppermost Meditation and Goodness, the Heavenly King of Xu Yan, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Nine Heavenly Chancellors, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao, the Myriad Immortals and Holy Worthies, and the Boundless Heavenly Venerables. May this merit flow into the bodies of your servants, absolving transgressions and dissolving entanglements, severing the roots of death, summoning the true and real, inscribing our names in the Supreme Clarity, delivering the Seven Ancestors and all departed kin, cutting off the flow of calamities, releasing the bound in darkness, forever escaping hell, ascending to the celestial halls, freed from the Five Sufferings, receiving blessings in the Southern Palace, transforming to become Perfected, benefiting and protecting the living. We eradicate your servants’ thousand karmic roots and myriad past obstructions, washing away [Name]’s sins, fulfilling [Name]’s affairs.

May our bodily spirits be refined and transformed, traversing the empty void, soaring to the Jade Clarity and Golden Towers. Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Supreme and Utmost Heavenly Perfected, that after attaining the Dao, we may ascend into formlessness, wheeling together with the Three Treasures.

**Second Offering of Incense:**
Your servants, in this fast and Dao-practice, meditating on the divine and invoking the real, reciting scriptures and invoking vows, soaring to the Nine Heavens, sincerely repenting to the Three Primordials, burning incense and lighting lamps, dedicate this merit to all hidden learners in the ten directions, the boundless, infinite, immeasurable, and endless four borderlands and sacred mountains—those who have attained the Dao and those who have not, the Dharma Masters, our parents and revered kin, fellow disciples, and worthy Daoists—may all universally attain deliverance, together escape the gates of sin, each realize their Dao, and ascend to the Supreme Clarity. May the seven generations of our parents be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the celestial halls, and may we eradicate the thousand karmic roots and myriad past obstructions of your servants as above.

We offer our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Great Perfected of the Three Primordials and Nine Mysteries, the Myriad Immortals and Jade Sovereign, the Boundless Primordial Supreme Jade Emperor, the Utmost Heavenly King of Stillness, the Heavenly King of Unarrogant Joy, the Heavenly King of Responsive Transformation, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Nine Heavenly Chancellors, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao, the Myriad Immortals and Holy Worthies, and the Boundless Heavenly Venerables. May this merit flow to all hidden learners in the ten directions, the boundless, infinite, immeasurable, and endless four borderlands and sacred mountains—those who have attained the Dao and those who have not, the Dharma Masters, our parents and revered kin, fellow disciples, and worthy Daoists—may all universally attain deliverance, together escape the gates of sin, each realize their Dao, and ascend to the Supreme Clarity. May the seven generations of our parents be freed from sorrow and suffering, ascend to the celestial halls, and be clothed and fed by nature. We eradicate the thousand karmic roots and myriad past obstructions of your servants as above.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Void and Supreme Perfected of the Three Primordials, the Utmost and Supreme, the Boundless and Utmost Heavenly Venerables, that we may attain the Dao, ascend as immortals, roam the Golden Towers, enter formlessness, and wheel together with the Three Treasures.

**Third Offering of Incense:**
Your servants, in this fast and Dao-practice, meditating on the divine and invoking the real, reciting scriptures and invoking vows, soaring to the Nine Heavens, sincerely repenting to the Three Primordials, burning incense and lighting lamps, dedicate this merit to our household and clan, the nine relations and in-laws, the emperors and kings of all under heaven, their ministers and officials, the people of their domains, and all living beings—creeping, crawling, slithering, and breathing—whether already born or yet to be born, may all be granted life and fulfillment. May the thousand sins and myriad transgressions of our household be universally pardoned, extending compassion to all beings in the heavens.

We offer our bodies, spirits, and lives to the Supreme Perfected of the Nine Heavens, the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Primordial Jade Void, the Utmost and Supreme Jade Sovereign of the Nine Mysteries, the Heavenly King of Brahma Treasure, the Heavenly King of Brahma Kāma, the Heavenly King of Pāriyātra, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Nine Heavenly Chancellors, the Supreme Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao, the Myriad Immortals and Holy Worthies, and the Boundless Heavenly Venerables. May this merit flow to our household and nine relations, the emperors and kings, their ministers and officials, the people of their domains, and all living beings—creeping, crawling, slithering, and breathing—whether already born or yet to be born, may all be granted life and fulfillment. May the thousand sins and myriad transgressions of our household be universally pardoned, extending compassion to all beings in the heavens, that all may receive the grace of deliverance and salvation, escape the Ten Sufferings and Eight Difficulties, the Five Calamities and Six Harms, the Nine Tribulations and Seven Injuries, each preserving their blessings and emoluments, dwelling forever in the natural state.

Now we burn incense, taking refuge in the Supreme and Boundless Heavenly Venerables, that we may attain the Dao, ascend as immortals, soar through the Nine Heavens, enter formlessness, and wheel together with the Three Treasures.

After the three offerings of incense, facing east, we chant the obeisance as follows:
Your servants wholeheartedly offer our lives to the Boundless and Primordial Supreme Jade Perfected Great Emperor and Heavenly Venerable of the East.
*Three bows.* After bowing, the Dharma Master kneels to read the repentance, while the others prostrate to listen. When finished, all rise together, maintaining composure and focus, without haste or disorder.

**Repentance:**
Your servants, having established this fast and upright practice, cultivating the Dao and honoring the masters, meditating on the divine and invoking the real, reciting scriptures to seek immortality, soaring to the Nine Heavens, burning incense and lighting lamps to absolve past transgressions, repenting to the Three Primordials, offer our lives to the Boundless Primordial Supreme Jade Emperor and Great Perfected Heavenly Venerable of the East, beseeching your gracious illumination to pardon the sins of your servants—whether from past lives or this life, past bodies or this body—of [Name]’s transgressions, and so on.
May they be suddenly washed away, casting off the old and renewing, sins forever extinguished, blessings eternally preserved. Grant that [Name]’s tribulations be overcome, [Name]’s affairs fulfilled, the Dao attained through study, immortality achieved through seeking, soaring through the great void, ascending the Nine Heavens. May the seven generations of our parents escape the Three Wretched Realms, ascend to the Southern Palace, their blessings flowing boundlessly, receiving the grace of deliverance from the Heavenly Venerables.

Upon completion, all bow three times in unison, ceasing after three touches of the cheeks. All movements should be gentle and unhurried, without sound.

Next, proceed to the southeast, then due south, southwest, due west, northwest, due north, northeast, the northwest of the upper realm, and the southeast of the lower realm. For the repentance in the ten directions, follow the same ritual as in the east: all bow three times, though one may suffice, or three prostrations may be made in the heart. The touching of the cheeks must not be omitted, nor may it be excessive or insufficient.

Next, intone the invocation for repentance in the five directions.

Then, facing west, chant: *"Your servants [Name] and company, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Supreme Heavenly Venerable of the West, bowing twice."*

The Dharma Master sits briefly to recite the vow, while the others prostrate themselves.

*"Your servants [Name] and company, having established this fast and set forth this offering, burn incense and light lamps to dissolve and release the thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults of past sins—specifically, the errors of [Name], and so on. May the Supreme Primordial Void-Emptiness Great Origin Ninefold Mystic Essence Jade Perfected Lord of the West, the Lofty Sage and Supreme Immortal Jade Terrace Consort, and the Jade Void Supreme Numinous Boundless Heavenly Venerable deign to bestow grace and favor, specially granting compassion and pardon. May the faults of [Name], and so on, be restrained and removed; may the affairs of [Name], and so on, be granted fulfillment. May the Dao be attained through study, immortality achieved through seeking, soaring through the great void, ascending the Nine Heavens. May the seven generations of ancestors be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace, dwelling eternally in non-action, clothed and fed by nature, receiving the grace of deliverance from the Supreme Sages."*

Each touches the cheeks three times.

Next, facing north, follow the same ritual as in the west.

We, your servants [Names], now establish the fast and perform the vigil, burning incense and lighting lamps to absolve and deliver from past transgressions—innumerable faults and myriad offenses, specifically those of [Name], and so on. May the Lofty and Supreme, the Primordial Perfected Lord of the North’s Great Void and Purple Mystery, the Three Heavens’ Jade Lads, the Highest Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao, the Supreme Perfected Lord, the Supreme Perfected King, the Northern Marquis of Central Perfection, and the Highest Mysterious Myriad Immortals and Supreme Sages, the Heavenly Venerables, deign to bestow grace and favor, specially granting compassion and pardon.

May the Supreme and Lofty, the Primordial Lord of the South’s Great Void and Nine Mysteries Cavern Spirit, the Southern Culmen’s Supreme Origin Lord, the Southern Prosperity Controller of Destiny and Lord of Longevity, and the Cavern Yang High Sage and Supreme Immortal Heavenly Venerable, deign to bestow grace and favor, specially granting compassion and pardon.

May the seven generations of ancestors be delivered, ascending to the Southern Palace, dwelling eternally in non-action, clothed and fed by nature, receiving the grace of deliverance from the Supreme Sages.

The rites to the Five Directions now complete, return to face east. Meditate upon the deities with eyes closed, knock the teeth five times, swallow saliva five times, and visualize the Five Spirits fully present within the body, the Five Talismans radiant within and without. Let the demonic hordes of the Five Directions flee far away, while those who come to serve stand in solemn array behind the Perfected Officials. After a long while, swallow saliva three times, knock the teeth three times, and recite the *Scripture of Reniao Mountain’s Incantation*:

*"Within the Yellow Center, qi is marshaled to sever demonic lineages,
Inspecting and restraining fierce spirits, cutting off the old fiend’s root.
The Most High issues commands from the Most High’s chamber—
Hasten the Northern Emperor to the Jade Palace!
Reverently bearing the mighty decree, proclaim it to the Demon Kings.
The Nine Qi billow and surge, clashing with fate’s decree.
The secret jade texts now flourish in completion:
The Three Heavens turn in brightness,
The Six Heavens’ course is fulfilled.
How worthy are the virtuous!"*

The visualization and incantation complete, invoke the Ten Directions’ Return to Mystery as follows:

**Northern Supreme Hymn:**
The Supreme unfolds its mysterious store,
Resplendent, it spreads the true methods.
Scattered and boundless, the Heavenly Treasures,
Revered by all in the Ten Directions.
Without beginning, without end,
Unobscured, thus without darkness.
Ascending the Jade Capital’s terrace,
Wandering carefree upon Kunlun.
Transcending the Yellow Springs’ dark realm,
Even demon kings long to hear.
Seven ancestors receive transformation,
Releasing me from past-life grievances.
Entering, I rein in the soaring mystery;
Exiting, I ride the floating purple clouds.

**Northeastern Supreme Hymn:**
Double radiance illumines the Jade Dawn,
Riding the light to open perfect clarity.
Towering, the Cavern Perfection’s hall,
Gleaming, the seven treasures’ essence.
A single thought delivers from eight perils,
Forever paired with the Supreme.
Spiraling, I offer the yellow effulgence,
Sunlight born within the void.
Worldly folk do not contemplate the Dao,
Nor hear the *Sutra of Wisdom*.
Vast is the Cavern Perfection’s precept—
The mystery’s response moves demon kings to sincerity.
Ten thousand kalpas as a single breath,
How could they rival a thousand billion eons?

**Eastern Supreme Hymn:**
The Supreme embodies the Great Nothing,
Dispersing form to ferry the weak and lost.
Diligently expounding the mysterious arts,
Heavenly Perfected join in praise.
Those with affinity manifest through scripture,
Those without are concealed in the canon.
Should one attain this Dao,
A halo of light first crowns the head.
The body crosses without awaiting a ford,
Drifting lightly to the Immortals’ hall.

**Southeastern Supreme Hymn:**
The boundless Nothing eternally abides,
The conditioned "have" securely enters the wondrous.
Heaven’s brush inscribes the supreme,
The mystery’s lineage holds its essentials.
Revolving, the Three Treasures are conveyed,
The Ten Directions universally resound.
The Supreme gazes upon the Jade Capital,
Demon kings howl in the empty sky.
The Heavenly Emperor clasps hands and chants,
Perfected Ones ride the void in laughter.
Scattering blossoms, my thoughts align—
The Eight Vows naturally transcend.

**Southern Supreme Hymn:**
Divine immortals ride the auspicious clouds,
Mounting dragons to tread the dark waves.
Harmonizing with the true, they display felicitous signs,
Washing their feet in the Eight Rivers.

Fortune’s response comes not as I await,
Thus able to unbind the celestial nets.
Virtue and power crown the Three Realms,
The earth’s web too has been transcended.
Inspired encounter with the numinous assembly,
Cold wisdom illumines the lotus scripture.

**Southwestern Supreme Hymn:**
The peerless awakens the four assemblies,
Vast beyond the great expanse.
Dark and bright surely have their cause—
No obscurity, thus no concealment.
The net of destiny turns the mysterious wheel,
Perfected immortals gather in the blossom assembly.
Wandering at times through the distant wilds,
Heavenly and human, no boundary is seen.

**Western Supreme Hymn:**
The numinous and wondrous lodge in proclaimed traces,
Heavenly and human find ford and shore.
Adrift on the fathomless abyss,
Ever fearful of winds and waves dispersing.
Its conditions rooted in prior power,
Who can reckon wisdom and knowledge?
Gently yielding to the mysterious pivot,
Luminously the hidden causes are discerned.
A stalwart shoot, a disciple of the Perfected,
Plucks the spirit zither in the empty sky.
Cold contemplation reveres the Ten Directions,
Neither departure nor stay do I envy.

**Northwestern Supreme Hymn:**
The Supreme unfolds the profound scriptures,
The worthy and wise return to the great affinity.
Desolate the Three Treasures’ preserve,
Lush the flowering of my karmic causes.
Elders and scribes enter refinement,
Their essence purified, golden bodies arise.
From kalpa’s end to kalpa’s beginning,
Ever more radiant their numinous countenances.
Rare deliverance bows to the peerless,
Devout scriptures descend to the perfected.
The Dao’s grove flourishes in the Heavenly Capital,
Below, its light illumines all earthly immortals.
Freely they disperse their numinous might,
Vastly the great Dharma is proclaimed.

**Upper Supreme Hymn:**
The Supreme gazes upon the Ten Directions,
Dim and misty, harmonizing with the wind’s stillness.
The halo’s light illumines the Three Luminaries,
Perfected Ones don the celestial robes.
Demon kings stand with clasped hands,
Officials receive them beside the Feng capital.
Sun and moon veil their coursing brilliance,
The Seven Treasures gleam boundlessly.
All endeavors flourish at this hour,
Fortune extinguishes, hells fall silent.
How distant, the immeasurable Honored One—
Heavenly and human cannot fathom.

**Lower Supreme Hymn:**
The Three Treasures flourish throughout the Ten Directions,
Steadily the void clears in the empty sky.
Turning and revolving with the transformative principle,
A single inspiration, the Dharma’s conveyance ascends.
Do not obscure the dim and murky chambers,
The Four Great Elements arise with the times.
Emptiness and being—nothing is not possessed,
Towering, the many mountains and hills.
The Supreme harbors no lingering thoughts,
Extinguishing thoughts, returns to the Great Vehicle.
At the six hours, savor the *Plain Numinous Melody* and the *Luminous Writ of the Grand Empyrean*.
The text is too vast to record; consult the scrolls when the time comes.

The Five Emperors’ verses of sorrow and joy,
Patrolling thrice around, circling the southern quarter,
Facing north they halt, reciting the *Three Poems of the Four Poles and Five Sufferings*, as follows:

**The Great Cavern Sums Three Principles**
The primordial transformation has form and formlessness.
Still as a rootless teaching,
Solemn as if possessed of numinous might.
Alas! Within the Three Paths,
Sorrow and suffering arise therefrom.
To the utmost study, heed these precepts,
Accumulate goodness through kalpas’ ages.
When kalpas end, reborn in heaven,
Body conjoined with sun and moon.
Foolish and deluded, following worldly fancies,
Pursuing superficial learning for glory.
Proclaiming transformation without discipline,
Carelessly leaking the Heavenly Treasures’ scriptures.
Eyes measured, entering death’s gate,
The Four Poles knot your name.
Soul and spirit tread the Nine Perils,
The Five Sufferings ever bind you.
Feeding on fire, treading the Knife Mountain,
Hardships without momentary respite.
Lamenting this origin of fortune and misfortune,
Ever clear amidst the vast.
The exalted leave stern warnings,
Fortune and misfortune move one to sigh.
The immortal Dao arises from destiny,
In the unseen, already determined.
Without destiny, it does not unfold;
Once awakened, ever at peace.
If one can honor the mysterious precepts,
Naturally soaring beyond the empyrean.
If ensnared by love and desire’s burdens,
Why forcefully strive and play?
Dwelling in transgression, the Four Luminaries are knotted,
Life and death tread the path of suffering.
Dragged through the Five Sufferings’ courts,
The Three Paths’ knots remain unbroken.
The numinous sinks, seized in the Nine Darks,
Ten thousand kalpas without dawn’s waiting.
Grieving for this teaching of the Primordial Beginning,
How can one not incite resentment?

**Vast the Nine Mysteries Above**
Veil upon veil, the first transformation’s inception.
No form, no image,
No depth, no measure.
The Two Modes initiate the unfolding,
Qi congeals to form sediment.
The Three Dawns brighten the Primordial Chamber,
The Five Nines possess their discipline.
Fortune and misfortune arise from human action,
Good and evil—who indeed prevails?
If one can awaken to the mysterious enlightenment,
Transcending, surmounting the lofty barriers.
If grasping the axe that hews destiny,
Accumulating days, filling the heart.
Sinking transgressions knot the Four Luminaries,
Former punishments truly have their end.
Born bearing the wind’s blade,
The Five Sufferings know no release.
The Seven Mysteries fill the dark night,
Ten thousand kalpas mark a single era.
Lingering in the Three Paths,
Unawakened to life and death.

Reciting the *Five Sufferings* complete, chant:
Your servant [Name], with utmost sincerity, reverently submits to the *Supreme, Boundless, Peerless Dao; the Most Real Honored Scripture and Treasure Talisman; the Grand Dharma Master of the Mysterious, Lord Lao; and the Azure Lad*.

Nine bows, or three bows, or bows of the heart may be made.
The Dharma Master reads the great repentance,
Others prostrate themselves.
After the Three Honored Ones and nine bows,
Each knocks the head nine times and ceases, then returns to the incense burner.

If companions perform the thanksgiving for the deceased,
Though the fifteen directions are complete,
One should still offer a general thanksgiving for the great repentance,
Scattering hair and concentrating the mind.
The text follows:

The Grand Mystery Capital’s Three Caverns Dharma Master, Master of [Mountain] Yue,
Lesser Manifestation Real Person, Disciple of the Three Luminaries,

And all responsive and attuned deities within and beyond the Three Realms.

We, your humble servants, undeservedly blessed by karmic fortune and steeped in the mysterious truth, have reverently practiced the precious scriptures without daring to slacken. Yet our innate nature is dim and shallow, failing to grasp the profound and pure; in following the Way, we violate its precepts, and in every movement and pause, we incur transgressions. Our past sins being already grave, our present faults have only multiplied. We fear that even a moment’s lapse may prevent our modest vows from being heard. Now, by great mercy, we are granted benevolent pardon. We swear to cherish every instant, striving to establish a sincere resolve. In accordance with the ritual, we present our words, humbly reciting them for your hearing.

The text of the petition is as above.

As our plea is earnest and sincere, we humbly beseech your compassion. Bestow upon us the grace of threefold forgiveness, absolving the sins of your servants—past and present lives, former and current bodies—and those of our sevenfold ancestors, both maternal and paternal kin, sovereigns and ministers, teachers and friends, all karmic connections, the departed and the yet-to-die, and all beings now in the world. May those burdened by grave sins in the yin and yang realms, beset by calamities, hindered in study or office, or whose aspirations remain unfulfilled, now be cleansed in heart and devoted in life. With unbound hair and bowed heads, we implore the Three Venerables to shed tears of mercy, commanding the relevant authorities to issue decrees of rectification, removing the transgressions of us, your servants, and all our karmic ties across past lives—both hidden and manifest—where our actions and stillness have defied the Way:

Whether through lack of filial piety or kindness, lack of benevolence or wisdom, lack of reverence or humility, lack of faith or loyalty, lack of solemnity or resolve, lack of yielding or integrity, lack of generosity or aid, lack of purity or fairness, lack of uprightness or harmony, lack of diligence or obedience;

Or by taking lives with our own hands, plundering and raiding, scheming for illicit unions, or engaging in incestuous relations with the nine clans;

Or by teaching others to kill, slaughter, or cruelly oppress beings, instigating plunder, schemes, or illicit unions within the nine clans, envying the worthy and resenting the capable, or rebelling against teachers and masters;

Or by leaking scriptures after receiving them, treating sacred texts with disdain;

Or by defiling the Dao by mingling with the profane, weeping before corpses, treading upon blood and filth without repentance or reform;

Or by employing sacred methods while consorting with women, allowing yin and yang to intermingle chaotically, disobeying the Seven Classics;

Or by presumptuously partaking in the Three Caverns without expelling the Three Corpses, harboring treacherous thoughts, committing violent acts, acting arrogantly, injuring kin, desecrating scriptures and precepts, or betraying the Three Venerables;

Or by heedlessly moving about without regard for taboos, knowingly violating prohibitions, pursuing private desires contrary to the rules, indulging in gluttony and drunkenness, behaving abnormally, undermining the Dao and corrupting the Dharma, or confusing evil with truth;

Or by failing to receive teachings from a master, stealing scriptures and transmitting them recklessly, exchanging them without fasting or vows, borrowing and misusing them, deceiving the common folk, altering sacred texts, feigning profound understanding, abandoning the ancient for the modern, or inventing one’s own methods;

Or by practicing the Dao without devotion, lacking proper halls for scriptures, neglecting offerings, slackening in daily rites, associating with unrelated men and women, exchanging garments, or mingling with improper company;

Or by occupying high positions as honored masters or sovereigns, yet belittling inferiors, killing the innocent, meting out unjust rewards and punishments, taking and giving arbitrarily, indulging ignorance and desires, or offending the Three Luminaries;

Or by serving as ministers, officials, clerks, or servants, yet deceiving in comings and goings, stealing, acting recklessly, rebelling, or defying the Five Phases;

Or by men and women who reverse right and wrong, harming public and private interests, abandoning the true for the perverse, slandering the true Dao, persisting in evil without repentance, or repeating offenses after repentance, accumulating unresolved grievances—

We beseech you to wash all these away, dissolving sins and spreading blessings, reconciling enmities, dispelling lawsuits, severing the roots of evil. May our departed kin likewise be freed from the dark springs, ascending together into radiant realms, and may our descendants be blessed and protected. May divine spirits guard and assist both the living and the dead, allowing the deceased to reincarnate and form bonds with the Dao, while the living renew their studies and virtues. May tombs rest in peace, dwellings remain serene, families and nations prosper, the Dao flourish daily, demons be subdued, sages descend to wander, heaven and earth harmonize, the Three Luminaries shine together, the Seven Luminaries align without error, the Nine August Ones govern in balance, the Four Seas calm their waves, the Five Peaks stand majestic, wind and rain come in due measure, crops yield abundance, all beings receive blessings, and the world attain great peace.

We especially pray that your mysterious compassion grant our requests, that our vows be fulfilled by your grace, and that our words today not be in vain. Above, may the great Dao’s boundless generosity be manifest; below, may it match the sincerity of your servants’ longing.

The Great Repentance concludes. Face east and strike the teeth thirty-six times.

Recite the Five Vows, which may also be used with three days of fasting.

**First Vow:** May the qi of my birth be natural, and from this qi may my body be formed, equal to the Three Luminaries, eternally rooted in the boundless.

**Second Vow:** May my body ever dwell above the Great Void, within jade palaces and chambers, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and wandering with the Mysterious Mother by night. When thirsty, may I drink from the vast well’s jade mushrooms; when hungry, may I consume dragon embryos, crimson tree fruits, and red children.

**Third Vow:** May my body give birth to ten thousand marvels, seventy-two radiant lights, extraordinary fur and form, and garments of flying feathers. May I ride the void and mount the sky, entering and leaving the imperial palace, with all blessings converging, and my lifespan boundless.

**Fourth Vow:** May I be born with qi and die with qi, reborn after death, becoming an emperor, ruling over the Ten Heavens, and governing all immortals.

**Fifth Vow:** May all beings, born and unborn, together preserve the Three Luminaries. May those who follow the Dao and their sevenfold ancestors ascend to the Southern Palace, and may all blessings under heaven be fulfilled. May the vows of the four directions and five realms converge in the Jade Hall.

**Next Vow:** May the Nine Ancestors nurture my body, and may my hun and po spirits, my true deities, forever dwell within my palace, communicating above with celestial immortals and below with the abyssal depths. May the Vow of Earth, the Vow of Wind, the Vow of Clouds, the Vow of Spirits, and the Five Vows unite, securing my name in the register of long life. May purple mists descend from heaven, and may the Five Spirits guard the earth. Riding clouds and mounting the void, may I ascend in a green chariot to the Golden Gate, advancing into the Jade Clarity. May blessings extend to my seven ancestors, who shall be reborn in the womb, and may the Five Vows unite in eternal harmony and prosperity.

The Middle Vows are also five: may the root of Dao-attainment be realized. The Vow of Yin, the Vow of Yang, the Vow of Great Void, the Vow of Supreme Non-Being, and the Vow of Supreme Mystery—may they ascend to feast in the Jade Chamber, forging karmic bonds with the Emperor. Roaming the Gate of Life’s Gaze, riding the waves of the Nine Heavens, may the Primordial Father inscribe my name in the register, and the Mysterious Mother record my years. May peach-vigor bind my essence, firmly guarding the Cinnabar Field. May my body ascend as adamantine, my name inscribed in the Jade Volume. May the seven ancestors attain liberation, and blessings and fortune arrive in full.

The Lower Vows are also five: the Vow of Great Emptiness, the Vow of Supreme Existence, the Vow of Supreme Oneness, the Vow of Supreme Perfection, and the Vow of Divine Immortals. May I traverse the peaks of the Five Marchmounts, drift among the Nine Firmaments, move in and out of the Gates of Opening, and transcend the threshold of death. May Heaven and Earth be my parents, the Three Luminaries guard my years, the myriad spirits watch over the nine apertures of the Yellow Springs, and numinous qi descend naturally. With these five vows aligned, may all resound and converge.

When the vows are complete, knock the teeth twice seven times and recite the incantation:
*"Supreme Emperor of the Upper Origin, Scripture of the Emperor’s Unity and Mystery, five clouds scatter radiance, luxuriant through the Three Clarities. Jade lads and jade maidens burn incense and attend the numinous. The upper vows unfold and merge with me, enabling me to become a divine immortal and ascend to the Emperor’s court. The Northern Emperor severs death, the Southern Pass inscribes life. The Golden Register of Eastern Florescence records my name. May boundless vows unite with me in equality."*

When finished, knock the teeth thrice seven times, look up, and swallow qi five times, then cease.

After the incantation, pinch the incense three times, replenish the censer, and recite:
*"Three Origins and Three Heavens, Five Marchmounts and Five Emperors, divine immortal messengers, true perfected of the Three Qi, left and right Dragon and Tiger, celestial immortals and earthly immortals, flying immortals and divine immortals, officials of the Five Numinous Incense—summon now the upright qi of the ten directions, the natural golden liquid, elixir essence, and mushroom spirits. May the Nine Mysteries and Jade Perfected converge in the oratory’s exposed altar, pouring through the bodies of your servants so-and-so, enabling us to study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality, soar through the Great Void, and ascend the radiance of the Nine Heavens. May jade lads and jade maidens attend the incense smoke, presenting the petitions of your servants so-and-so before the throne of the Highest, Boundless, Supreme, Great Dao, Jade Emperor."*

When finished, knock the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and cease entirely.

Replenish the censer, then circumambulate and exit while chanting as before.

The six preceding sections are to be recited one each during the six periods of the day. If reciting during three periods, alternate them in rotation, cycling through without end. Upon completion of the chant, exit while coughing—all procedures mirror those of the morning rites.

After meals, when ascending to the scripture hall, likewise rinse the mouth, knock the teeth three times, and visualize the spirits as prescribed. Bow three times in reverence, then recite the secret incantation:

*"The Jade Emperor’s supreme law,
Ascends to the Three Clarities on high.
On this auspicious day of fasting,
Open my divine scriptures.
Though myriad trials lie concealed,
All endeavors shall succeed.
Jade lads attend and guard,
Jade blossoms scatter fragrance,
Ascending to the Three Origins,
Granting me eternal life."*

This incantation is also used when opening the scriptures.

Enter the hall, face the Dao, and bow three times. If the assembly is large, circumambulate to the east. If fixed in position, all bow three times—or once, or bow in the heart. After bowing, sit upright, close the eyes, clench the fists, and knock the teeth. Visualize the head as pure azure jade, the hands as cinnabar, the feet as snow; the hun-spirit stationed on the left, the po-spirit guarding the right. After a long while, open the eyes, rub the palms together, and massage the face. Ascend to the high seat and, upon completing the visualization, begin reciting the scriptures and expounding their meaning.

First, bow nine times toward the Dao seat—three bows in sets of three—then ascend the high seat. When opening the scriptures, first knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and visualize the Hundred Spirits and Ten Thousand Perfected converging in the swirling winds. Then recite the secret incantation:

*"Subtle, subtle is the Gate of the Mysterious Origin,
Radiant and profound, it pierces the empty void.
The supreme Dao arises from stillness and silence;
There, the Three Pure Palaces shall be seen.
The Great Dao is perfected here,
Riding clouds and dragons, soaring through the heavens.
To left and right attend those who uphold the scriptures,
Jade maidens and jade lads.
Their bodies brim with the elixir of immortality,
Untangling the nets, riding the divine winds.
Seven ancestors return to the womb and are reborn,
Becoming for all generations the lineage of immortals."*

Recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters*, the *Feminine One*, the *Great Possession*, the *Nine Perfected*, and the *Great Elixir*. Face north and bow in the heart to the four directions, knock the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and visualize within the five viscera five-colored lights infusing the essences of the Five Stars. Then read the *Divine Continent*, followed by the *Inner Names of the Hundred Spirits*, and finally the *Thirty-Nine Chapters*. Mind and eyes must align, with no stray thoughts; ensure each passage is completed without interruption.

When reading the thirty-first scroll, face north and bow in the heart to the four directions, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow saliva thirty-four times, and visualize the Three Essences of the Five Stars and the sun and moon infusing the adept’s body. For the remaining scrolls, follow separate instructions.

When reading the *Scripture of Wisdom* and its verses and hymns, first close the eyes, knock the teeth three times, swallow saliva three times, and visualize the Three Primordial Sovereigns in the Golden Flower Palace, appearing as infants, before reciting the text.

Upon completing the recitation and exposition, descend and stand upright. Bow three times to the Three Honored Ones, then prostrate fully. Knock the teeth three times and recite the secret prayer:

*"Ascend the Brahma-realm, tread upon prosperity,
Sevenfold Numinous Venerable,
Great One of Utmost Endeavor,
Five Spirits of Yellow Tranquility.
Ascend to the Nine Heavens,
Stand peerless beside the Emperor.
I beseech flight as an immortal,
Seven ancestors reborn as infants,
Freed from transgressions, released from nets,
Ascending to the Jade Clarity."*

Afterward, knock the teeth seven times and swallow saliva three times to conclude.

Rise and exit the hall, visualizing the spirits. Morning and evening, practice this diligently; after seven years, ascend to the heavens.

The rituals for the three periods of day and night and the six periods are the same. For those entering the altar or oratory, minor variations exist in the incantations—where "hall" or "chamber" is mentioned, substitute "altar" or "oratory."

The altar, oratory, hall, and chamber are all arranged in three concentric layers. For major rites, the Dharma Master enters the innermost, the next-ranking officiant stands in the middle, and the assembly faces the altar from the outer layer.

The lamps of the hall and altar—beyond the seven or nine—are lit as appropriate. Generally, follow the numbers: ninety for the Upper Origin, sixty for the Middle Origin, thirty-six for the Lower Origin, totaling one hundred eighty-six. Arrange them on the left and right of the hall and altar, as well as at the gates, the Year Star, the Monthly Establishment, the Day Stem and Branch, the Natal Star, and the Current Year.

The Year Star and Natal Star lamps burn day and night without ceasing; the rest are lit only at night. If it rains, light two lamps in the hall; the others may be placed at the gates.

Upon completing the circumambulation, each bows again before their Natal Star lamp and the Year Star lamp, presenting their petitions and expressing their wishes as they please.

According to the *Bright Regulations of the Four Poles*, at the Beginning of Spring and the Spring Equinox, arrange nine lamps in the courtyard; at the Beginning of Summer and the Summer Solstice, eight; at the Beginning of Autumn and the Autumn Equinox, six; at the Beginning of Winter and the Winter Solstice, five. For the Natal Star, twelve lamps; during the Eight Festivals, face the Sovereign; for the Natal Star, face the Year Star. Knock the teeth twenty-four times and recite:

*"Supreme and Lofty Perfected,
Ten Thousand Sages and Five Emperors,
Jade Controller of the Emperor,
Governor of All Immortals and Perfected,
On this auspicious morning of the Eight Festivals,
The offerings are arrayed.
Sins of yang and judgments of yin,
Severed and extinguished in the Nine Yin.
From this day forth, forevermore,
Uplift the Seven Mysteries,
Deliver from the fiery realm,
Eternally escape the Mountain of Knives.
The Three Paths and Five Sufferings,
Shall no longer burden my body.
Attain harmony with heaven and earth,
Preserve the dawn of the Emperor.
Five Wishes and Eight Assemblies,
All shall be as proclaimed."*

Afterward, remove the headscarf and bow one hundred twenty times, touching the forehead to the ground without causing pain. Upon finishing, replace the headscarf and gaze upward, reciting in the heart: *"Today, my body receives the grace of heaven, granted rebirth in a transformed body, ascending as a flying immortal."* Then swallow twenty-four breaths of qi to conclude. After three years, transgressions are erased, and the body becomes one with the Perfected.

For an altar spanning nine *zhang*, arrange one hundred eighty-six lamps on each of the four sides, totaling six hundred forty-four. Beyond these, one thousand eight hundred sixty lamps are placed along gates, courtyards, and pathways, remaining lit until dawn—unless wind or rain intervenes. When the allotted time expires, conclude and report the merits accomplished.

On the morning after the fast concludes, following the circumambulation, do not replenish the censer. Instead, chant the names and titles of all present, stating each person’s rank and the Daoist registers they have received, in order of seniority. For those who have received the highest Dharma, follow the *Yellow Writ*; if participating in the master’s register, the officiant’s name is recited first.

Supplicate to the Three Origins, the Supreme Perfected of the Empty Cavern and Nine Mysteries, the Lofty Jade Emperor of the Great Void, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Twenty-Four Perfected, the August Jade Dawn of the Supreme Great Dao Lord, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, the Ten Thousand Dao of the Primordial Supreme Sages, and the Most Exalted Heavenly Worthies.

Your servants, devoted to the Dao and delighting in immortality, aspire to ascend through the Nine Mysteries and present ourselves before the Supreme Perfected. On the [specific] day and hour of the [specific] month, we commenced the fast and vigil at [location], performing the Dao-circuits, reciting scriptures, meditating upon the divine, invoking the Perfected, compounding elixirs with focused intent, atoning for transgressions, and establishing merit. With hearts purified and strength exhausted, we adhered to the Dharma and followed the rites. Now that the prescribed days have concluded and the practices are complete, we humbly supplicate and invoke the Most High Three Origins, the Three Clarities, the Three Treasures, the Attendant Immortals of the Divine Court, the Five Directions and Five Emperors, the Inspectors of the Numinous, the Directors of the Fast, the Flying Immortals, the Heavenly, Earthly, and Divine Immortals, the Perfected Officials and Numinous Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the Four Seas, and the Four Quarters. May they return to their true palaces, ascend in rank as Upper Immortals, and be enfeoffed with imperial titles according to their merit.

In accordance with the rites of the Supreme Perfected, may your servants, along with our Nine Ancestors of the Mysteries, the Seven Generations of Forebears, and all departed kin both near and distant, together escape the dark night and enter the radiant light. May long-standing transgressions be absolved, and may fortune and virtue flourish.

May your servants, through the practice of the Dao, attain the Dao; through seeking immortality, attain immortality; through compounding the elixir, perfect the elixir; through refining gold, achieve gold. Through focused meditation, may we achieve resonance with the divine, commune with the numinous, have our transgressions absolved, and our prayers for blessings fulfilled. May we transform our forms, traverse the seventy-four directions, and have the Three Origins descend, sending forth green chariots. May we soar through the Upper Clarity, ascend through the Nine Heavens, shine with the brilliance of the sun and moon, and turn in harmony with the Three Treasures. We humbly beseech the Most Exalted to witness and reflect our sincere devotion.

Your servants, in learning the Dharma, have not yet mastered the proper forms of reverence; in conducting the fast, have often strayed from the subtle guidelines. Our actions may not conform to the canonical standards, and our conduct may violate the regulations, subjecting us to the scrutiny of the Four Controllers and the jurisdiction of the Five Emperors. For our myriad transgressions and innumerable faults, we implore your forgiveness. Pity our ignorance and lack of understanding, reward our virtuous intentions, and spare us from punishment.

May the Perfected Officials of the Five Corporeal Realms pursue their immortal duties, ascend to the Dark Capital, receive ranks according to their merit, and complete their rewards. Upon their return to our bodies, may they ascend in unison with us, soaring through the Great Void.

With this, we respectfully submit our petition and await your response. Your servants, with utmost reverence and trepidation, prostrate ourselves and bow twice in submission.

The rites conclude. Bow twice again, perform the triple offering of incense, replenish the censer, and recite the purification mantra as usual.

All offerings and rituals should be conducted on the designated day of the fast. If hindered by wind or rain, they may be performed afterward, but no later than nine days hence. Should the delay exceed this period, another fast must be held to atone for the deepened transgressions and unfulfilled intentions. Submit a renewed petition to realize your sincere aspirations.

Should inauspicious or adverse events, whether public or private, disrupt the fast, the rites must be repeated—tenfold, a hundredfold—until the response is achieved. The prescribed number of days for each of the four seasons must not be exceeded, nor should the rituals be abbreviated; all must be completed in full.

If the effort required exceeds one’s capacity, sell possessions or borrow from others to ensure completion. Distribute the offerings widely among those of like mind, avoiding those of disparate intent. For those residing in secluded or remote areas, far from towns and roads, prepare boats and carriages with diligence, calculate the strength required for the fast’s duration, and complete the work without delay or procrastination. Should sudden hardship cause one to forget prior commitments, turning blessings into misfortune, be ever vigilant.

Should any ritual implements be lost, misappropriated, destroyed by water or fire, stolen by thieves, concealed by demons, or defiled by base elements, abandon them and report the matter. Bury or burn them, and do not repurpose them for profane use. Prepare new implements in accordance with the Dharma, without deficiency, and submit a separate petition to atone for the loss.

For the various calamities and transgressions—some comprising twenty-four categories—do not attempt to absolve them all at once. Instead, complete the process over three years, observing all twenty-four solar terms without omission. To omit even one requires starting anew, a task of great difficulty that only those of unwavering devotion can accomplish. Whether one succeeds or fails, the Dao will not be attained. Future opportunities may not align with present aspirations; thus, today’s vows must be pursued with diligence and precision, never wavering in intent. Only then will fulfillment be assured.

For transgressions, calamities, or misfortunes that are interconnected and fall under six categories, all six may be absolved simultaneously, rather than addressing one per term. If, after three years, resonance with the divine has not been achieved, proceed to absolve one matter at a time. Once the cycle of years is complete, ascension will surely be attained.
