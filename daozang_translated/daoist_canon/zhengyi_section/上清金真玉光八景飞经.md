**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Eight Luminants**
Composed by the Most Exalted Azure Youth Lord

The *Hidden Writ of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance* was received by the Nine Heavens Venerable from the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Numinous Capital of the Great Void, bestowed by the Primordial Heavenly King. It is named the *Scripture of the Eight Luminants*, the *Supreme Scripture of the Eight Purities* by the Great Perfected, the *Expansive Seven Origins* by the Azure Perfected Youth, and the *Hidden Writ of Jade Secrets* by the Most High Great Dao Lord.

The Golden Chapters emerged before the Nine Mysteries, their upper sections named after the four seasons. This Dao is lofty and wondrous, revered among all scriptures, governing the myriad Perfected, guiding the host of immortals. Its mysterious talismans flow and reflect, illuminating the Purple Dawn. It is concealed within the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens, in the Golden Splendor Purple Hall and Jade Treasure Chamber.

Forged in gold as tablets to inscribe the numinous text, carved in jade as cinnabar script to clarify its chapters, its radiance shines brilliantly, illuminating the Great Void. Sun and moon flank its light, the Five Dawns assist its numen. Three thousand Jade Radiance Maidens and three thousand Azure Youths are commanded to attend the jade script. Jade consorts tend the incense, divine winds waft the mist. Mighty dragons and venomous beasts guard the jade gates. Phoenixes spread their wings, sacred simurghs shade the mystery. The host of Perfected feast in ritual, the ten thousand sages pay homage. Jade steps bear canopies across the celestial court; the Great Emperor humbles himself before the throne. The Jade Sovereign alters the measures to propel the cycles; the Jade Armillary commands the Dipper to turn the spirits. The divine provinces are sung into harmony; the Seven Transformations dance in the heavens. The Three and Five traverse the numinous transformations; the Nine Mysteries scatter their celestial paths. The Five Phases are marshaled to summon souls; the Expansive Seven are harnessed to command spirits. The Eight Luminants ascend to the void; demons are subdued by the Golden Perfection. The *Hidden Writ* is unveiled in the chamber of stillness; its wondrous verses are chanted in the spaceless. The myriad emperors are governed in the Supreme; the multitudes below are gathered in the ever-generating.

At the inception of the primordial qi, the Nine Heavens Venerable sat in command of the Numinous Capital. He summoned the Jade Perfected, the Five Elders, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Supreme Sovereign Masters, the Myriad Origin Dao Lords, the Lofty Sage Great Spirits, the Most High Great Dao Lord, the Great Emperor of Fusang in the Sun Valley, the Supreme Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Three Primordial Ladies of Purple Purity, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, and the Three Primordial Ladies of Great Purity. Together, they ascended the Sevenfold Crimson Chambers of the Supreme Jade Treasure Terrace in the Purple Jade Palace of the Supreme. Edicts were issued to the Five Emperors and the officials of the four directions. The divine soldiers of the Numinous Capital aided in guarding the Supreme Prime.

The Most Exalted Jade Maidens of Great Harmony were commanded to deploy the talismans of the Golden Perfection for summoning spirits and subduing demons, placing them in the five directions. The Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate recited the chapters of the Great Void. Their wondrous chanting resonated clearly; the Eight Luminants aligned in perfection. Jade radiance illuminated the heavens; the Expansive Seven shone brilliantly. The Three Dawns paused their splendor; the Eight Winds turned their banners. Dark drums sounded beneath cloud canopies; the Nine Qi reflected the numinous. The Three and Five assisted in praise; the Six Sixes merged in harmony. Profound and obscure above, resplendent and majestic in the Great Obscurity, incense flew around the sun, lightning stirred the essence. Floral radiance intermingled; divine candles merged their light. Flowing through a thousand kalpas, attaining the wondrous and forgetting the cycles.

Thereupon, the Nine Heavens Venerable descended upon the Dark Terrace. He commanded the Left Immortal Attendant Li Yufei and the Supervisor of Numinous Envoys Deng Yuansheng to wield the nine-colored banners and the jade script of imperial edicts. They proclaimed the covenant to the Four Luminants, transmitting it to the host of Perfected. The *Eight Luminants Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance* and the *Expansive Seven Origins*, bestowed by the Most High Great Dao Lord, ascended to the supreme rank. They roamed the Jade Clarity, aided by Golden Immortals, guarded by the Five Emperors. The affairs of the mandate were revealed in full. Cloud chariots bore canopies; flying dragons readied their carriages. Dragons soared beyond the heavens; in an instant, billions of immortals assembled. Jade wheels and azure carriages flowed with radiant mist. The host played cloud songs; phoenixes cried and simurghs soared. Mists intermingled and gathered, lingering between the Dark and Supreme. Soughing beyond the Great Rosy Clouds, they wandered beyond the boundless, each returning to their Jade Void abodes, as if moved by the numinous wind’s qi.

The Most High Great Dao Lord then ascended the towering terrace and the Ninefold Chambers. He summoned the Nine Mysteries Golden Gate Emperor of Later Saints and the Most Exalted Azure Lord. For three months, they fasted in accordance with the covenant, receiving the transmission from the two lords. Each was to seal a copy in the Golden Gate Upper Palace and the Azure Palace of the Square Cauldron.

When the great kalpa completes its cycle, the Three Ways wane and wax, the Two Qi part and unite. The governance of beings has its appointed time. In the age of the Tang, the Yang Nine unleashed calamity. Malevolence was eradicated; the worthy were sought. In that year, those who cultivated the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, who refined the Dark Pass of the One Feminine, who deployed the Eight Ways to summon the formless, who studied the Golden Floral of the Three Origins, who recited the Pure Numinous in the chamber of stillness, who marshaled the Five Phases to summon souls, who wore the Tiger Script of the Golden Spirit, who shifted the Seven Stars at the Celestial Pass, who grasped the Dark Names in the Emperor’s Chart, who established the Azure Record in the Supreme Clarity, who bound the Jade Embryo to weave the network, who contained the Jade Womb to nurture the inner spirit, who severed worldly attachments to prolong life, who guarded silence in spontaneity—such ones could receive the mysterious transmission of the Eight Luminants, learn the wondrous secrets of the Golden Perfection, deploy the summoning of spirits in secluded chambers, and place the Expansive Seven to command the gods. They would deliver their seven ancestors from the dark palace, free them from the Five Sufferings of the Knife Mountains, escape the Eight Perils of the Fire Realms, and dissolve the burden of stones from past roots.

Those who obtain this scripture transcend the Nine Mysteries, soaring freely with flying shadows, gazing upon the Three Clarities. Without such a person, it must not be transmitted for kalpas.

The *Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Eight Luminants* was born above the Nine Heavens, before the existence of light. Its mysterious radiance flows and reflects, neither present nor absent, suspended in profound obscurity, illuminating the Jade Palace. Accumulated over seven thousand kalpas, its text is most luminous. Gazing upon it in the Great Void above the Dark Mystery, one cannot fathom it; destroying it, it does not perish. Resplendent and radiant, it shines through the Ten Heavens.

In the first year of Jian Shi, when the year lay in the Eastern Pivot and the celestial stems aligned in auspicious conjunction, the Nine Heavens Venerable One purified the Seven Treasures Jade Terrace in the Great Void. With a covenant of gold and azure, he invoked the heavens to receive the numinous scripture, summoning spirits and subduing demons through the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse. Once the mysterious chapters were fathomed, no master or lineage was known—it arose suddenly, inexplicably. Upon enacting its text, the Eight Luminants manifested in form, their light illuminating the jade chamber and beckoning the myriad perfected beings. At that moment, the Emperor of Heaven issued his decree, and none among the host of immortals failed to attend his court, offering reverence in prostration and paying homage to the Jade Scripture.

This is the celestial pledge of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor, the majestic writ of the Jade Sovereign. To his left, the Left Auxiliary bore the staff of the Immortal Capital; to his right stood the Jade Gentlemen of the Attendant Immortals, along with ten billion myriad spirit officials of the Five Directions, charged with safeguarding the sacred text and aiding those who wore its talismans. In accordance with the Four Luminants of the Supreme Ultimate, it was transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas, concealed within the Palace of Great Abundance above the Nine Heavens—the Golden Radiance Purple Hall, the Jade Treasure Chamber—where natural flying nets draped the chamber, jade tables and golden couches stood arrayed. Jade Morn’s youths held incense to the left, Golden Flower’s maidens scattered mist to the right; the Grand Consort attended before, Jade Immortals flanked behind. A canopy of dark clouds and purple shade sheltered the hall, while the perfected immortals and exalted sages ascended thrice monthly to perform their rites.

Such were the precious instructions and divine decrees: when the Three and Five altered the course of destiny and the great kalpas turned in their cycles, this scripture was to be revealed in the world for seven hundred years. Only those whose names were inscribed in the Emperor’s register, whose jade characters shone in Purple Clarity, whose golden storehouses and jade bones harmonized with the True—only they were permitted to receive its covenant transmission. To lightly divulge the Emperor’s treasure would subject one’s seven ancestors, parents, and self to the Three Offices’ judgment, consigning them to the Knife Mountain Hell, where for ten thousand kalpas there would be no reprieve. Let those who receive it exercise utmost caution.

The Celestial Venerable of Primordial Beginning revealed it in the Void of Supreme Mystery, transmitting it to the Nine Heavens Venerable One, the Supreme Perfected of the Great Dao, the Azure Perfected Youth, the Five Elders of the Upper Perfected, the Thirty-Nine Emperors, the Venerable Master of the Supreme Sovereign, the Lord of Myriad Beginnings, the Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen, the Three Primordial Ladies of Purple Simplicity, the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise, the Three Primordial Ladies of Supreme Simplicity, and the Lady of Supreme Perfection. The Venerable Master of the Supreme Sovereign transmitted it to the Purple Clarity Emperor Lord; the Lord of Myriad Beginnings to the Venerable Master of the Yellow Stone and the Three Heavens Jade Youths; the Supreme Perfected of the Great Dao to the Eastern Sea Youth, the Lady of Purple Tenuity, and the Golden Watchtower Emperor Lord of the Nine Mysteries of the Latter Sage. The Emperor Lord entrusted it to the Minister of the Upper Prime, the Azure Youth, the Four Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, and the Lord of the Western City. Thus, the precious instructions were passed mouth-to-mouth among the exalted perfected, compiled and enacted by the Minister Emperor Lord, who arranged the liturgies and expounded the Dharma. In due succession, they were gathered into a sacred scroll, one copy of which was sealed within the stone chamber of Mount Wangwu.

Should there be one of lofty aspiration and earnest devotion, who forsakes worldly glory, ascends the numinous mountain, and cultivates with diligent austerity—whose name is recorded in the Azure Palace—such a one shall receive this scripture, and the Emperor Lord shall dispatch perfected beings to secretly transmit it to their person. Once obtained, the Five Emperors shall guard their chamber, summoning spirits and subduing demons, mastering essence and governing spirits. Through cultivation and recitation of the scripture, they shall ascend to correspond with the Nine Heavens, free from the misfortune of trial and failure. By enacting its methods, perfected beings shall descend to converse with them, and within seven years, they shall traverse the void; after nine years of devoted practice, they shall ascend in broad daylight.

The supreme Way is not transmitted to the untrue. All who receive *The Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Eight Luminants* are divinely ordained, their past lives destined for immortality. They must burn incense in a separate chamber, bowing morning and evening, their hearts filled with the presence of the divine perfected, the Jade Radiance, and the Purple Qi, suffusing the hall of purification. In reverent devotion, as if gazing upon the gods themselves, the Emperor shall dispatch twenty-four maidens of Golden Flower and twenty-four youths of Jade Morn to attend and protect them, rewarding merit and punishing transgression, discerning good from evil. Moreover, the Water and Fire Officials of the Left and Right shall scrutinize any leaks or violations of the statutes, meting out punishment with the Wind-Knife’s trial, extending guilt to the seven ancestors.

The statutes of life and death demand vigilance in cultivation. Those who study the supreme Way, entering the mountains to fast and recite the numinous chapters without this scripture, who recklessly employ the talismans for summoning spirits, subduing demons, and the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse, shall not presume to invoke the Jade Scripture. The perfected shall not descend, and celestial demons shall assail their person. For this scripture is the pledge of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor, the writ of the Jade Sovereign. To act without its mandate is to fail in attaining the Dao; to recite it with shallow intent in pursuit of immortality is to labor in vain, inviting calamity instead. The Three Offices shall seize and punish, extinguishing the self.

Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must prepare the full complement of scriptures, ensuring their completeness and coherence, their rituals and enactments in proper measure. After ten thousand recitations, perfected beings shall descend to their chamber, and they shall attain immortality on the appointed day—though not necessarily after ten thousand recitations, for it lies in the depth of their devotion. Those who wear the talismans for summoning spirits, subduing demons, and the Seven Radiant Ones of the Vast Expanse shall be born under the Supreme Unity, their lifespans altered by the Controller of Destinies, their names recorded in the registers of the Supreme Mystery. Proclaimed to the Four Offices, the Five Emperors, the spirit officials, the Five Marchmounts, the Nine Rivers, and the myriad numinous beings, all shall bow in reverence and protection of their person. This is the true imperial writ of the Celestial Sovereign, by which spirits are commanded and numinous powers are wielded.

In practicing this Way, one must not rashly enter defiled or polluted places, nor tread the filth of life and death. To violate this prohibition is to drive the perfected spirits away, returning them to the Upper Palace, where their names shall no longer exert control, bringing harm upon the self. Let those who receive this teaching take heed above all else.

On the day of the Beginning of Spring, when the Three Primordial Ladies of Simplicity ascend to the Celestial Sovereign and the Supreme Thearch holds his celestial feast, it is the day of the Primordial Radiance’s procession, the occasion for receiving immortality. Those who cultivate the methods of *The Scripture of the Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Eight Luminants* must bathe and fast on that day, entering their chamber at dawn to burn incense and perform the rites. They shall arrange the talismans for summoning spirits, beckoning the perfected, and subduing demons in the Five Directions, standing at the center facing the northeast. Knocking their teeth twelve times, they shall visualize clouds of purple, green, and white swirling from the northeast, then silently invoke: *"Three Primordial Ladies of Simplicity, I beseech you to turn your divine chariots and descend upon me. Inscribe my name anew and bestow upon me the gift of immortality."*

Upon completion, visualize once more the Upper Palace of Pristine Subtlety in the northeast, the Palace of Primordial Yang, where the Lord of the Dao of the Primordial Radiance, Controller of Emptiness and Recorder of Destinies, surnamed Ge and named Taizhou Xian, resides. His form measures seven inches and eight fen, clad in a cord of dark yellow, crowned with a seven-hued luminous jade coronet, and shod in five-colored shoes. In his hand, he holds the staff of awe-inspiring power, riding the chariot of the Eight Luminants, a carriage of soaring tortoise and dark clouds, drawn by azure dragons. He is attended by twenty-three Immortal Lads of Supreme Harmony, descending to govern within the Mud-Pellet Palace of your body. Then silently intone:

*"Great Spirit of the Primordial Radiance, the mysterious Dao revolves its essence. At the inception of the celestial reckoning, the myriad qi merge and arise. The Nine Subtleties ascend in transformation, returning to descend upon my form. Preserve and secure my primordial auspiciousness, oversee and unify the numinous powers of the Emperor. Summon the perfected and subdue demons; may my Dao be majestic and luminous. Ascend to Supreme Harmony, filling me with jade mushrooms. Attain communion with the divine and penetrating vision, gazing upon the Three Clarities. May I ride the flying radiance and together ascend to the Imperial Court."*

Upon completion, tilt your head back and swallow the eight qi.

Practiced for eight years, the clouds of the Three Simplicities and the flying wheels of the Eight Chariots shall come to welcome your body, ascending to the Court of the Imperial Dawn.

Upon completion, visualize once more the Upper Palace of Azure Yang in the east, the Palace of Mysterious Subtlety, where the Great Lord of the Dao of the Radiant Dawn, the Venerable Master, surnamed Yu and named Youxiao, resides. His form measures nine inches, clad in a cord of purple and azure, crowned with a nine-hued penetrating-heaven treasure coronet, and shod in nine-colored shoes. In his hand, he holds the talisman of life and spirit, attended by thirty-six Immortal Lads of the Great Yang. He rides the chariot of the Eight Luminants, a carriage of azure clouds, drawn by verdant dragons, descending to govern within the Hall of Light of your body. Then silently intone:

*"Primordial Dawn of the Upper Origin, summoning spirits and beckoning the perfected. Receiving the qi and the mandate of the celestial reckoning, following the imperial precedents of the Dao’s canon. The mysterious canopy revolves its essence, feasting in the Jade Dawn above. Return your numen to descend and secure my body. Preserve my essence and refine my qi; may the Five Flowers bloom resplendently. Let the purple qi flow and illuminate, attaining mastery over the divine. May I ride the flying radiance and feast in the jasper pavilion above."*

Upon completion, tilt your head back and swallow the nine qi.

This is the Way of the Radiant Dawn. Practiced for eight years, the flying wheels of the dark clouds shall come to welcome your body, ascending to the Great Clarity. These are the Eight Dao Secret Invocations of the Radiant Dawn, not to be transmitted to those who are not immortals.

On the day of the Summer Commencement, the Three Primordial Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate ascend to the banquet in the Palace of Purple Tenuity, the occasion for the Mysterious Radiance’s procession and the day of receiving immortality. On that day, follow the method above. At dawn, face southeast, knock your teeth nine times, and visualize clouds of azure, purple, and yellow swirling from the northwest. Then silently invoke:

*"Supreme Ultimate of the Great Perfection, Three Primordial Perfected, I beseech you to turn your divine chariots and descend upon my chamber. Inscribe my name upon the jade tablet and make me an immortal."*

Upon completion, visualize once more the Upper Palace of Lesser Yang in the southeast, the Palace of Supreme Tenuity, where the Lord of the Dao of the Boundless Mysterious Radiance and Jade Luminance, surnamed Wang and named Wuying, resides. His form measures eight inches and eight fen, clad in a cord of cinnabar brocade, crowned with a jade coronet of boundless advancement, and shod in nine-colored shoes. In his hand, he holds the talisman for summoning spirits, riding the chariot of the Mysterious Radiance and green clouds, a five-colored cloud carriage drawn by phoenixes. He is attended by thirty-nine Immortal Lads of Numinous Flight, descending to govern within the Grotto Chamber of your body. Then silently intone:

*"Supreme Numen of the Mysterious Radiance, riding the banquet of the eight qi, creating the radiance of the Nine Mysteries, soaring without bounds. Return your perfected essence to descend, dissolving my karmic obstructions. Shelter me with flying clouds, cover me with the purple canopy. May I ride the Eight Luminants and ascend to the celestial heights."*

*"Great Emperor Lord of Fusang, I beseech you to turn your divine radiance and gaze upon my body. Record my name in the Eastern Florescence and grant me the power to ride the flying mist."*

Upon completion, face south once more and visualize the Upper Palace of the Great Yang in the Palace of Purple Tenuity, where the Lord of the Dao of the Void Radiance, the Grand Marshal Yuanxian, surnamed Xuan and named Boshi, resides. His form measures eight inches and eight fen, clad in a cord of crimson brocade, crowned with a jade coronet of celestial brilliance, and shod in nine-colored shoes. In his hand, he holds the talisman for subduing demons, riding the chariot of the Eight Paths of Luminous Radiance, a carriage of red clouds drawn by phoenixes. He is attended by thirty-six Jade Lads of the Crimson Terrace and Upper Palace, descending to govern within the Cinnabar Field of your body’s Central Origin. Then silently intone:

*"Void Radiance, initiate the numinous, riding the qi in revolving return. Swiftly drive the Eight Paths, emanating luminous majesty. Descend upon my chamber, illuminating my cinnabar splendor. Subdue demons and command spirits; may the myriad numina be vanquished. Grant me penetrating vision of the profound, to soar in radiance with the dawn."*

On the day of the Autumn Commencement, the Supreme Perfected of Great Simplicity, the White Thearch, ascends to the Jade Heaven to visit the August Perfected of the Mysterious Empyrean—this is the day for the Radiant Void to perform the Dao and receive immortality. On that day, follow the method above: at dawn, face the southwest, knock the teeth twelve times, and visualize white, red, and purple clouds revolving in the due west. Then silently intone:

*"Perfected of Great Simplicity, I beseech the revolving divine radiance to descend upon my body, that my name may be presented in the Jade Heaven and I be made a Perfected."*

Upon completion, visualize within the Palace of Subtle Yang in the Upper Mansion of Lesser Yin in the southwest: the Lord of the Dao of Primordial Radiance of the Great One of the Void, whose surname is Huang and given name Yunzhu, standing seven inches and eight fen tall. He wears a sash of dark yellow plain silk, a Seven Treasures Advancing Wisdom crown upon his head, and nine-colored shoes upon his feet.

*"Jade Consort of the Great Empyrean, Supreme Perfected of the Great Void, I beseech the divine chariot to revolve and descend upon my chamber, bestow upon me a jade name, and present it to the Great Empyrean, that I may become a Perfected and feast in the Upper Palace."*

Upon completion, visualize within the Palace of the Dao of Subtlety in the Upper Mansion of Yin Essence in the north: the Lord of the Dao of Mysterious Harmony, whose surname is Yu and given name Yinjing, standing five inches and eight fen tall. He wears a sash of five-colored dark clouds, a Mysterious Dawn treasure crown upon his head, and five-colored lion shoes upon his feet. In his hand he holds the tally of summoning the numinous, riding a jade chariot of lingering return, drawn by black-feathered phoenixes. Following him are thirty-six jade lads of the Upper Palace of the Great Mystery, descending to govern within the Mysterious Valley Palace of your body. Then silently intone:

In clarity and pristine truth, one shares the numinous with the Primordial Beginning, receiving transformation from the Nine Origins, embracing the qi of the Vermilion Infant. The jade chariot lingers in return, roaming freely through the Purple Clarity. Its wheels turn through the eight nodes, its weft aligns with the celestial warp. It erases my death-record, preserving life in the southern birth. I attain the flying radiance, guiding the reins of the green canopy.

Upon completion, swallow the five qi and cease.

This is the Dao of Clarity and Radiance. Practicing it for eight years will summon the jade chariot of lingering return to descend and receive your body, ascending to the Great Clarity. The eight secret words of Clarity and Radiance must not be transmitted to those who are not immortals.

Practicing the eight secret methods of the *Flying Scripture of the Eight Radiant Scenes*, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereign commands the myriad saints of the ten directions and the numinous immortals of the Five Peaks to all come and protect your body, descending with the mysterious chariot and flying carriage, allowing you to ascend to the Upper Clarity together with the Perfected. The True Sovereign guards your destiny, the Great One defends your body. In all your comings and goings, you shall suffer no calamity or misfortune.

If your name is not inscribed in the jade registers of immortality, nor recorded in the charts of the Purple Palace of the Netherworld, you must not awaken your heart with this scripture. Once you obtain this scripture, the Eastern Florescence will inscribe your name in its records, and your rank will equal that of the Perfected. Treasure it and keep it secret—do not lightly disclose it. To recklessly reveal these secret words is to invite annihilation upon your family.

For those who cultivate the *Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance Scripture of the Eight Flying Scenes*, when placing the talismans for summoning the numinous, attracting the Perfected, and subduing demons, one must first face north toward the incense burner, strike the left teeth thirty-six times, and chant the *Chapter of Golden Perfection and the Great Void* once before proceeding.

Chanting this single verse will resound through the Nine Heavens, penetrate the Unbounded, and illuminate the Cavernous Origin. The Jade Emperor will heed it in awe, and all demons will be bound. This chapter is supremely wondrous, hence it is called *Golden Perfection*. Its verses say:

Heavenly demons ride the void and arise,
Myriad spirits tremble in the divine court.
Entrusting transformation to the chant of songs,
They shift and enter the nameless.
How clamorous the chaotic qi,
Defiled paths arise along the way.
Within the clouds, the Vermilion Palace converges,
The Northern Emperor dispatches divine soldiers.
Soaring and wheeling, they know the Dao,
The mysterious workings come to summon.
The upper radiance guides the flying reins,
The flying carriage inspects the cloud encampment.
Urging the Northern Emperor’s records,
They gather and seize the names of all demons.
The vast expanse unfurls the celestial net,
Unleashing might, casting the flowing bells.
Golden Perfection aids the hollow and empty,
Jade radiance shines through the eight darknesses.
The Golden Mystery guards the upper palace,
Divine tigers slay the celestial essences.
Severing the myriad baleful qi,
Countless billions all made level.
Upholding the Nine Heavens’ trust,
A single whistle commands all to yield.
Summoning the Perfected, exploring the Three Caverns,
Wisdom recites, clear and resonant.
Gazing at the eight paths toward the mysterious rosy clouds,
Seven revolutions weave the celestial warp.
Merging with the Emperor’s singular truth,
Liberating the seven generations of ancestors.
Erasing the roots of the five sufferings,
The returned soul receives glory anew.
Golden light illuminates the silent chamber,
Divine candles naturally arise.
Floral incense scatters through the jade realm,
Mist and qi penetrate the Jade Capital.
The Emperor dispatches the lingering chariot,
The Three Origins descend with the green canopy.
The swift carriage soars through the Nine Mysteries,
Paying homage at the Jade Emperor’s court.

Upon completion, proceed with your practice.

They enact and spread the true Dharma, subdue demons and restrain spirits, sever and slay malevolent omens. The myriad Dao are made equal and level. Those who follow the Dao and later learners—may the Imperial Lords record their names.

The Highest Jade Emperor, the Primordial August Lord of the Dao, received the talismans of the Seven Luminaries from the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One. These talismans summon the officials of the flying immortals, enable communion with spirits, and allow clear vision. They subdue demons, suppress spirits, wield awe over the ten directions, and unleash fire for ten thousand miles. They grant the power to kill or spare with a thought. When practiced for nine years, one may ride the dark chariot and soar through the Upper Clarity.

To apply the supreme Dao, cultivate and seek immortality, subdue demons, and command spirits, inscribe the talismans according to the method. Face north, knock the left teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the radiance of the sun, moon, and five stars illuminating your body. Whisper the incantation:

*"The Seven Luminaries shine forth,
Their might flows, their essence radiates,
Light cast for ten thousand miles,
Divine brilliance of the Five Spirits.
Above, they seize Fengdu,
Record the names of ghosts,
By the celestial emperor’s decree,
Sever and slay Jia Sheng.
I am equipped with the Seven Luminaries,
Wielding golden bells of fire,
Within, I guard the six palaces,
Without, I draw in flowing essence.
Flying immortals, true ones,
Attend me in my purification,
Gazing into the empty void,
The Three Ways unite in clarity.
I ride the dark clouds,
Harnessing the green chariot,
The Five Marchmounts escort me,
Conveying me to ascend the Clarity."*

When finished, apply the talismans according to their positions for seven years, and true immortals will surely descend to confer upon you the treasure scriptures of the Upper Realized Ones.

Those with golden bones and jade names, inscribed in purple in the Upper Clarity, who obtain the talismans for summoning spirits, attracting the Perfected, and subduing demons—the talismans of the Seven Luminaries—will have their names recorded in the Nine Heavens. The Emperor will command the myriad Perfected Ones and the four bureaus’ spirit officials to distinguish and protect their bodies. As they come and go, ascending the Five Marchmounts, immortal officials will welcome and guard them. Ten thousand demons will bow their heads, and all malevolent spirits will lose their essence. After a hundred days of cultivation, they will commune with spirits, and true immortals will descend to confer upon them the true scriptures. Within seven years, they will ride flying chariots, roam the Five Marchmounts, and traverse the Three Clarities.

If the secret is revealed to three people, the transmission will not be genuine. The seven generations of ancestors, down to oneself, will all be cast into the Mountain of Knives. Among the three disciples, none will be spared for ten thousand kalpas. Those who receive this must guard it in secrecy, as strictly as the Four Brightnesses.

For all scholars of the supreme learning, even if they achieve the Dao and ascend as immortals, without these scriptures, the Jade Bureau of the Nine Heavens will not dispatch their immortals, the gates of the Celestial Pass will remain closed to them, and the officials of the Five Marchmounts will not guard their bodies. Thus, the trust of the Nine Heavens and the Imperial August Chapter are bestowed only upon those who have already become Perfected Ones and are not circulated in the world. Those who obtain them will become immortals.

Those who hold the left auxiliary insignia, the right attendants of the immortal capital, the jade lads who serve the immortals, and the spirit officials of the five directions who safeguard these scriptures must not treat them lightly or reveal them to the Upper Realized Ones. Violating these prohibitions will result in the destruction of one’s body.

According to the ancient statutes, these scriptures are transmitted once in ten thousand kalpas. In the present age, within seven hundred years, only three transmissions are permitted. In accordance with the statutes of the Bright Code, master and disciple must face each other in purification for ninety days, presenting one golden dragon, one jade fish, a hundred feet of purple silk, and three taels of gold to the master who possesses the scriptures. They must swear an oath by the trust of the Nine Heavens. Those who transmit without an alliance will suffer the trials of the wind and blade. Those who receive without sincerity, who belittle the Dao and disdain the Perfected, will be consigned to the ghostly officials, and their transgressions will extend to the seven mysteries. Thus, the statutes of the Four Poles clearly mandate threefold trust. If a master receives the scriptures but does not follow the statutes, using them for other purposes, they will be condemned to the Three Bureaus, forever confined to hell, and never attain immortality.

Zhao Boxuan, who once studied under Master Wanshi, achieved the Dao and was to ascend to the Golden Gates. However, lacking the talismans for summoning spirits, attracting the Perfected, and the Seven Luminaries, he was demoted to Mount Rong in an instant. Seven hundred years later, he sought out the Pure and True Youth, received the scriptures according to the alliance, and swore an oath at Mount Weiyu. Now, he has ascended as the Left Bureau Lord of the Upper Clarity.

Lord Wang transmitted the scriptures at Mount Yangluo on the morning of the zi hour of the eleventh month. He swore an oath to the Nine Heavens and passed them to the Lady of the Southern Marchmount, who is now sealed within Mount Yangluo.

The Pine Master of the Southern Marchmount, in the year of Yangshuo, transmitted the scriptures to Gu Xizi at Mount Taihua, instructing him to seal one copy within Mount Wushu.

The Paulownia-Cypress Perfected, on the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, bestowed this text upon Xu Yuanyou.

The *Upper Clarity Golden Perfected Jade Radiance Eight Effulgences Flying Scripture* concludes.
