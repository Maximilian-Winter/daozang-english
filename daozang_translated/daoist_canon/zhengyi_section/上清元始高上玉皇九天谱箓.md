*The Supreme Register of the Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens of Primordial Purity and the Highest Origin*

Respectfully addressed to the Nine Heavens—boundless and infinite, without ancestry or lineage, formless and nameless, without beginning or end, soundless and voiceless, the silent Great Void, the Purple Emptiness, the Dark Mystery of the Abyssal Expanse, the Profound Obscurity, the Radiant Origin of Kun, the Primordial and Eternal True Void Sovereign Dao Lord—who, by the swiftness of the Three Spirits and the mysterious governance of the celestial dawn, transforms the imperial foundation of the Dao, relying on the natural authenticity of the True, the subtle and profound threads of the numinous, the cyclical succession of the Nine Emperors, the lofty and distant High Emperor, the Primordial Rectitude overseeing Qian, the dim and ancient past where time does not await us.

We dare to reverently address the Primordial Supreme Perfection of the Nine Heavens, universally unfolding the ten thousand connections, ascending to the sacred alliance of the Numinous Mountain, where the Four Quarters and Five Emperors all witness the covenant.

Master Wang Jia of the Upper Learning, having received the qi and attained union with immortality, purified himself in the sacred mountains and received the Jade Chapters, the secret names of the Emperor-Sovereigns, the most wondrous oral instructions, and the prohibitions as recorded. Should he dare to betray the covenant, violate the statutes, or transgress the laws, his body would sink into the river’s source, forever consigned to the dark night, bearing fire and treading mountains, enduring the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never daring to seek pardon.

May all disciples awaken, taking the present as renewal. The Four Directors and Five Emperors shall list and memorialize [the disciple’s] name, reporting above to the Nine Heavens and proclaiming below to the myriad spirits. May the numinous response come swiftly, the Perfected One descend to the chamber, with a canopy of flying clouds, emerald plumes, and azure skirts, to welcome the disciple’s body, ascending to the imperial dawn, soaring through the Nine Empyreans, and feasting in the radiance of the Three Origins.

On the day of this address, the Eight Vows are declared in full. All that is commanded in this address shall be fulfilled without fail.

*The talismans are to be inscribed in vermilion.*

Here ends *The Supreme Register of the Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens of Primordial Purity and the Highest Origin*.
