### **Ge Xianweng’s *Emergency Remedies at the Elbow*, Juan 1**

**1. Remedies for Sudden Collapse from Malevolent Qi**

Sudden death may occur after prior illness or while resting in bed, with abrupt cessation of breath—all such cases are termed "death from malevolent qi."

**Remedies:**
**Method 1:** Take the heart of a green onion and insert it into the nostril—left for men, right for women—penetrating seven to eight *cun*. If blood emerges from the eyes, it is auspicious. Bian Que’s method is similar, but later involves blowing into the ears. Ge [Hong] states this refers to blowing into the nose, hence it is listed as a separate method.

**Another Method:** Have two people cover their mouths with cloth and blow into the patient’s ears, alternating when exhausted. Alternatively, use a tube to blow, while lifting the shoulders and leaning the body away—do not hover directly over the deceased.

**Another Method:** Pierce the ears with an onion leaf. If blood emerges from the ears or nose, do not be alarmed; absence of blood makes treatment difficult, while its presence is a favorable sign. At this time, lift the patient’s hands and suddenly release them. After a moment, the deceased will raise their hands to grasp at others, and when they cry out in pain, cease the procedure. For men, pierce the left nostril; for women, the right, inserting seven to eight *cun* or more. Highly effective.

It also treats those who have hanged themselves. This aligns with Bian Que’s methods.

**Another Method:** Soak cotton in fine wine, then place it in the deceased’s nostrils, pressing with the hand to force the wine into the nose. Hold their limbs steady to prevent startling them.

**Another Method:** Examine the upper lip’s inner ridge for white spots the size of millet grains, then pierce and remove them with a needle.

**Another Method:** Pour urine over the face several times, and the person will soon speak. This is from Bian Que’s methods.

**Another Method:** Take soap-bean pods the size of large soybeans and blow them into both nostrils; sneezing will restore the flow of *qi*.

**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Chengjiang* point beneath the lower lip’s depression, applying ten cones—highly effective.

**Another Method:** Slit a rooster’s throat and apply its blood to the face; when dry, reapply. Also, encircle the deceased with ashes.

**Another Method:** Use a tube to blow into the lower orifice, having several people take turns. When *qi* flows, the person revives.

**Another Method:** Split open a white dog and press it against the chest. If no white dog is available, a white parrot will also suffice.

**Another Method:** Hold a drake over the deceased’s mouth, sever its head, and let the hot blood drip into the mouth. Simultaneously, use a bamboo tube to blow into the lower orifice, alternating with others when exhausted. When *qi* flows below, the person revives.

**Another Method:** Extract juice from fresh cow or horse dung and pour it into the mouth, ensuring it reaches the throat. If the mouth is clenched, pry it open; if that fails, tap beneath the teeth. If no fresh dung is available, soak dried dung in urine and extract the juice. This is from Bian Que.

**Another Method:** Measure the deceased’s elbow and wrist with a cord—left for men, right for women—then extend the cord from the back down to the base of the spine. Moxibust at this point, then horizontally at half the cord’s length on either side. Apply three cones at each of the three locations, and the person will rise.

**Another Method:** Pinch the *Renzhong* point between the nose and upper lip to rouse them. If unresponsive, roll up the hand and moxibust the crease at the base of the palm, one cone per year of age.

**Another Method:** Moxibust the *Renzhong* point at the base of the nose, applying three cones.

**Another Method:** Moxibust the hairy depression at the base of the big toe’s nail on both feet, applying seven cones. This is Hua Tuo’s method. Some say twenty-one cones.

**Another Method:** Moxibust the navel, applying one hundred cones. Bian Que’s method also states: sever a weasel’s tail, take its blood to drink, and bind the weasel to use as a pillow—the deceased will revive shortly.

Another version: blow *banxia* powder the size of a soybean into the nostrils.

**Another Method:** Grind *nüqing* into a dose of one *qianbi*, open the mouth, place it in the throat, and administer water or bitter wine—the person will revive immediately.

**Note:** The preceding four methods for reviving sudden death and subsequent *shijue* cases all derive from the transmission of the Wei Minister, as recounted by the Orthodox Unity Perfected One. Bian Que received his methods from Master Changsang; this transmission emerged over twenty years after Ge’s time, so it could not have been known to him. These techniques had long circulated, hence references to the King of Chu or the King of Zhao, with variations in sequence and phrasing.

Zhang Zhongjing’s essential formulas include:
- Pound *xie* (Chinese chive) to extract juice and pour it into the nostrils.
- Sever a red rooster’s comb, take its blood, and blow it into the nostrils through a tube.
- Apply the rooster’s comb and blood to the face, encircling it with ashes—the person will rise immediately.
- Boil pig fat the size of a chicken egg in a liter of bitter wine, then pour it into the throat.
- Mix fourteen large soybeans with egg white and wine, then swallow them all.

For sudden death with high fever: boil half a *jin* of alum in three liters of water, then soak the feet up to the ankles.

For sudden death with closed eyes: straddle a cow facing the deceased, pound *xie* to extract juice and pour it into the ears, and blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils—immediately effective.

For sudden death with eyes and mouth open and tongue protruding: moxibust fourteen cones behind the fingernails and toenails, then administer Five-Poison pastes or powders containing *badou*.

For sudden death with limbs flaccid and involuntary voiding: boil a liter of horse dung in seven liters of water, reduce to four liters, and wash the body. Alternatively, take a liter of cow *dong* (thin dung), warm it with wine, and pour it into the mouth.

Moxibust one hundred cones at each of the following points: one *cun* below the heart, three *cun* above the navel, and four *cun* below the navel—the condition will resolve.

For sudden death in children with vomiting and diarrhea of unknown cause: extract juice from a horse dung pellet and have the child swallow it. If no fresh dung is available, boil dried dung in water to extract the juice.

The *Emergency Three-Substance Pill* and *Pei’s Paste* are listed under the emergency medicine section; they are particularly effective for sudden death and can be prepared on the spot.

All cases of sudden death, *zhong’e* (striking by evil), and *shijue* arise from natural *yin-yang* *qi* in heaven, earth, and the human body suddenly becoming obstructed, disconnected, or imbalanced, leading to blockage between upper and lower, or depletion on one side. Even when death seems imminent, revival is possible if the *qi* has not entirely dissipated. At such times, ghosts and spirits may also be involved, so talismans and protective measures can aid recovery.

**Additional Formulas**
Bian Que states: *Zhong’e* and sudden death from ghostly strikes are similar; for those already deceased, these methods may be used in combination.
- Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root to extract juice and pour it in—the person will recover immediately.

For *shijue* (corpse-like syncope), where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, listen for faint murmurs in the ears and warmth in the thighs—this method also treats it.

Sun Simiao’s formula for sudden death: blow soap-bean powder into the nostrils.

**Second Method for Reviving Sudden Death and *Shijue***
*Shijue* is a condition where the person suddenly dies but the pulse still stirs, and a faint whistling sound can be heard in the ears, with warmth in the thighs. Even if the whistling is present and the pulse stirs, it is still classified as *shijue*.

**Revival Method:**
Use a tube to blow forcefully into the left ear three times, then the right ear three times—the person will revive.

**Additional Methods:**

Another method: Pound dried *u** (calamus) into a piece the size of a jujube pit and place it beneath the tongue.

Another method: Moxa the philtrum (renzhong) with seven cones, and moxa the perineum one *cun* below the scrotum with one hundred cones. For women, moxa the midpoint between the two breasts. It is also said: Press the philtrum with the fingernail for a long while, or needle the philtrum down to the teeth—the person will revive immediately. These are all methods transmitted by Master Wei from Bian Que’s techniques, as in the case of Prince Zhao’s affliction.

Zhang Zhongjing also stated: In *shijue*, the pulse stirs but no breath is present; the qi is obstructed and fails to circulate, hence the person lies still as if dead. Insert powdered *u** (calamus) into both nostrils and blow. Have someone place powdered cinnamon beneath the tongue. It is also said that Bian Que’s method was effective for the King of Chu.

Another method: Shave the hair from the left temple in a two-*cun* square, burn it to ash, and pour wine down the throat—the person will revive immediately.

Another method: Measure the arm and wrist with a string—left for men, right for women—then extend the string from the *dazhui* (GV-14) point down along the spine. Moxa the end of the string with fifty cones—the person will revive. This is Bian Que’s secret technique.

Another method: Apply a hot compress to both flanks. Take soot from the stove the size of a bullet, mix it with fermented water, and administer it. After three or four doses, use a tube to blow into the ears, having three or four people take turns. Alternatively, use a small tube to blow into the nostrils, placing dust from the roof beams the size of a bean inside to ensure it enters.

Another method: Burn fourteen strands of a white horse’s tail and one white horse’s front hoof, then mix the ashes with vinegar into pills the size of small beans. Open the person’s mouth and administer two pills, then one pill after a short while.

Another method: Needle *baihui* (GV-20), located five *cun* within the hairline above the nose, inserting the needle three *fen* and reinforcing. Needle the flesh beside the big toe’s nail, three *fen* from the edge, and needle the top of the middle toe three *fen* each. Needle the inner side of the big toe, one leaf of garlic’s width from the tip. Also needle the tip of the styloid process of the ulna on the hand *shaoyin* meridian, one *fen* each.

Another method: Moxa the *danzhong* (CV-17) point with twenty-eight cones.

**Third Method for Reviving Sudden *Kewu* (Visitation by Malevolent Qi)**
*Kewu* is a type of *zhong’e* (strike by evil), often contracted at gates or doorways, causing twisting pain, distension, and fullness in the heart and abdomen, with qi surging into the chest. If not treated immediately, it can also kill. The revival method:

Moxa the *renzhong* (GV-26) point at the philtrum thirty times, pressing firmly beneath the nasal columella. Soak glutinous rice in water, extract one to two *sheng* of its juice, and administer as a drink. If the mouth is locked shut, force it open with an object.

Another method: Pound ink, mix with water, and administer one *qianbi* of the solution.

Another method: Use a bronze or earthenware vessel to hold hot water, placing the vessel on the abdomen. If it cools, remove clothing and press the vessel directly against the skin. If it grows very cold, replace it with hot water. Cease when recovery is achieved.

Another method: Layer three garments over the abdomen, place a bronze vessel atop the clothing, and gradually burn a small amount of thatch inside the vessel. When the thatch is consumed, add more—do not burn too much at once. Cease when recovery is achieved.

Another method: Measure the patient’s mouth with a string, then use this length to mark four points around the navel, each one string’s distance away. Moxa each point three times, igniting all four fires simultaneously. This brings relief.

Another method: Fold the string used to measure the mouth so that one end reaches the area below the heart. Moxa the lower end five times.

Another method: Mix one *fangcunbi* of cinnabar with three *ge* of honey and administer. If the mouth is locked, force the teeth apart to administer.

Bian Que’s method for treating *kewu* includes emergency talismans and a ritual involving *guan* (ablution) decoctions, but as these are not easily practiced by common people, they are not recorded here. This condition corresponds to what is now called *zhong’e* (strike by evil), and it resembles *sudden death by ghostly assault*. Treatments may draw from all these methods.

For those already dead: Pound fresh *changpu* (calamus) root, extract its juice, and have the patient hold it in the mouth—this brings immediate relief.

For *kewu* with a corpse-like stillness and inability to speak: Burn two *jiegeng* (platycodon) roots, grind them to powder, and administer.

Another method: Grind equal parts *xixin* (asarum) and *gui* (cinnamon) into powder and place it in the mouth.

Another method: Mix rooster’s comb blood with cinnabar, form into pellets the size of small beans, and place three or four into the mouth. This brings relief.

If the mouth is suddenly locked and cannot be opened: Grind raw *fuzi* (aconite) into powder, place it in a tube, and blow it beneath the tongue—this brings immediate relief.

Another method: Mix human blood with cinnabar, form into two pellets the size of *wutong* seeds, force the teeth apart, and place them into the throat to swallow.

Hua Tuo’s method for sudden *zhong’e* with shortness of breath and near-death: Moxa the area behind the toenail on the big toes, where the hairs converge, fourteen times on each foot. This brings immediate relief. If not, moxa fourteen more times. The previous method for reviving sudden death (thirty-seven moxa cones) has already been described.

Another essential formula from Zhang Zhongjing: Four *liang* of *mahuang* (ephedra), seventy *xingren* (apricot kernels), and one *liang* of *gancao* (licorice). Boil in eight *sheng* of water, reduce to three *sheng*, and administer in divided doses to swallow. This universally treats all types of *ganwu* (affliction by noxious qi).

Another method: One handful of *jiugen* (leek roots), twenty *wumei* (mume plums), and half a *jin* of *zhuyu* (evodia). Boil in one *dou* of water, then place the patient’s comb into the decoction and bring to a boil three times. If the comb floats, the patient will live; if it sinks, they will die. Reduce the decoction to three *sheng* and administer as a drink.

Another method: One *liang* of *gui* (cinnamon), three *liang* of *shengjiang* (fresh ginger), fourteen *zhizi* (gardenia), and five *ge* of *chi* (fermented soybeans). Pound the ingredients, mix with three *sheng* of wine, warm slightly, strain, and administer in one dose to bring relief.

*Feishi Zouma Tang* (Flying Corpse Galloping Horse Decoction): Two *badou* (croton seeds) and two *xingren* (apricot kernels). Wrap in silk, crush, and place in two *ge* of hot water. Knead with the fingers to extract the juice, then administer immediately. Drink within the time it takes to cook rice—this brings relief. Adjust the dosage as needed to universally treat all types of *feishi* (flying corpse) and *guiji* (ghostly assault).

Other pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.

*Ke* (visitation) refers to an external presence, and *wu* (affliction) means to offend—thus, *kewu* describes an external qi offending a person. This is generally a malign qi. Though many recover with treatment, it is a qi borne of ghostly or toxic influences. When encountered suddenly, its power wanes, so it cannot be treated like natural malign qi. Once it enters the body and invades the organs, channels, and collaterals, even after recovery, further treatment is advisable to dispel its lingering influence. Otherwise, it may recur and eventually cause harm, leading to periodic outbreaks.

**Additional Formulas**

From the *Wai Tai Mi Yao*:
For sudden *kewu* (visitation affliction) with suspended corpse syndrome and inability to speak, use equal parts *xixin* (asarum) and *guixin* (cassia heart), placing them in the mouth.

Another formula: Burn two *liang* of *jiegeng* (platycodon), grind to powder, and take with rice water. Also swallow musk the size of a soybean—excellent.

From the *Guang Li Fang*:
For sudden *kewu* near death, finely grind one *qian* of musk, mix with two *ge* of vinegar, and administer—immediate recovery.

**Fourth: Formulas for Sudden Ghostly Assault**
Ghostly assault strikes without warning, as if pierced by human force. The chest, flanks, and abdomen twist with sharp, unbearable pain, unrelieved by pressure. Some immediately vomit blood, or bleed from the nose, or pass blood.

Also called *guipai* (ghostly thrust).

**Formulas for Treatment:**
Moxa one *zhuang* at *renzong* (the philtrum below the nose)—instant cure. If unresolved, add several more *zhuang*.

Another formula: Grind equal parts *shengma* (cimicifuga), *duhuo* (angelica), and *mugui* (cassia bark) into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine—immediate cure.

Another formula: Moxa two *zhuang* one *cun* below the navel.

Another formula: Moxa seven *zhuang* one *cun* above the navel, and at the white flesh of both heels—recovery follows.

Another formula: Steep three pieces of processed mugwort the size of a duck’s egg in five *sheng* of water, boil down to two *sheng*, and consume in one dose.

Another formula: Stir one *sheng* of salt into two *sheng* of water and drink. Also spray cold water on the face, but do not induce vomiting immediately—wait until vomiting occurs, then recovery follows.

Another formula: Stir a pinch of powder into water and drink.

Another formula: Blow pure wine into both nostrils.

Another formula: Sever the head of a white dog, take one *sheng* of its hot blood, and drink.

Another formula: Drip chicken crown blood into the mouth, allowing one swallow. Then split the chicken and press it against the chest until cold, discarding it by the roadside. A black hen is even more effective.

Another formula: Boil one *sheng* of calf dung in three *sheng* of wine and consume. An adult ox may also be used.

Another formula: Burn three *cun* of a scabbard, grind to powder, and drink with water.

Another formula: Burn rat droppings, grind to powder the size of millet grains, and take with a little water if unable to drink, placing it in the mouth.

Other pills and powders are recorded in the *Emergency Remedies* section.

Now, shamans have truly witnessed people suddenly seized by ghosts or spirits—whether disrupting their ranks, colliding with them, or when their spirit is scattered and weak, or burdened by past transgressions. The mild escape, but the severe often die, much like the tales of Yan Jian—this is no fiction. Even if death is fated, one cannot but attempt rescue.

**Additional Formulas**
From the *Gu Jin Lu Yan*:
For demonic possession or *maogui* (cat ghost) illness where the person refuses to name the ghost, pound deer antler shavings into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with water—they will then speak the truth.

**Fifth: Formulas for Sudden Nightmare Unawareness**
If one suddenly falls into a stupor while lying down, do not shine fire upon them—fire will kill them. Instead, bite their heel or the side of the big toe’s nail, and repeatedly spit on their face to revive them.

**Other Formulas for Treatment:**
Grind *zaojiao* (Chinese honey locust) into powder and blow into both nostrils with a tube—they will awaken. This may still work after three or four days.

Another formula: Insert a hair into the nostril—left for men, right for women—twisting it inward.

Another formula: Blow into both ears with a reed tube. Also take fourteen strands of the patient’s hair, twist into a cord, and insert into the nostrils. Cut a rooster’s crown for blood, and blow it into the throat with the tube—highly effective.

Another formula: Grind yellow earth from beneath the stove into powder and blow into the nostrils with a tube.

Grind *xionghuang* (realgar) and *gui* (cassia) into powder and blow into the nostrils—also excellent.

Another formula: Apply well-bottom mud to the eyes, then have the person hang their head over the well. Call their name, and they will awaken.

Another formula: Pound *jiu* (leek) for juice and blow into the nostrils. In winter, dig up the roots, extract juice, and pour into the mouth.

Another formula: Drink salt water, adjusting the amount as needed.

Another formula: Place the person on the ground, draw a line on the earth with a sharp knife from the shoulder—left for men, right for women—encircling the face. Press the knife’s tip into the patient’s nose, entering one *fen*, and hold firmly without moving. The person will speak as if possessed by ghosts or spirits, begging for mercy. Ask: “Who are you? Why have you come?” They will plead to leave. Then erase the drawn line with your finger a few *cun* from the shoulder, allowing them to depart. Do not omit these questions.

Another formula: Cover the patient’s face with an earthen steamer, then have someone swiftly smash it—they will awaken.

Another formula: Hold an ox or horse hoof over the person in a stupor—also effective for sudden death. A black ox is especially good.

Another formula: Grind *xionghuang* (realgar) finely, sift, and blow into both nostrils with a tube. *Gui* (cassia) is also excellent.

Another formula: Grind *wanpu* (calamus) into powder, blow into both nostrils, and place some beneath the tongue.

Another formula: Bind the patient’s elbow with the left cord of a steamer, left for men and right for women. Tightly twist the remaining length, and also bind the feet with hemp. Then inquire about the cause, and loosen the bindings as instructed. Have one person sit at the head to guard, while another calls the patient’s name from inside the door. The seated person responds: “Yes, they are here.” The patient will then revive.

For sudden stupor without awareness, moxa twenty-one *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) beneath the big toe.

For those prone to nightmares and evil dreams: Place ash from extinguished fire in the shoes and under the pillow.

Another formula: Wear *xionghuang* (realgar)—left for men, right for women.

Another formula: Moxa twenty *zhuang* at the *jumao* (hairy spot) above both big toes.

Another formula: Place a piece of genuine musk by the head.

Another formula: A tiger-head pillow is especially good.

**Formulas to Ward Off Nightmares:**
Carry *xionghuang* (realgar) the size of a jujube pit under the left armpit—this ensures lifelong freedom from nightmares.

Another formula: Place a square of genuine red felt beneath the pillow.

Another formula: A rhinoceros-horn pillow is excellent; place *qingmuxiang* (costus root) inside the pillow and also wear it on the body.

Another formula: (For) treating prolonged sudden nightmares, write this talisman on paper, burn it until it turns black, mix with a little water, and place it in the mouth of the deceased. Hang a mirror before the deceased’s ear and strike it, calling the deceased’s name—revival will occur within half a day.

For those who lie in nightmare-induced stupor without waking, the hun and po souls wander outside, seized by evil. Though they wish to return, they cannot find their way. Firelight must be avoided, for if illuminated, they will never re-enter. However, those who experience nightmares in lamplight do so because their souls originally departed from brightness but failed to return to the body.

**Additional Formulas**
From the *Qianjin Fang*: To treat ghost-induced stupor, use *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust) powder the size of a *daogui* (a small measure) to revive the dead.

**Formulas for Sudden Affliction by the Five Corpses (Chapter Six)**
The Five Corpses are: *feishi* (flying corpse), *dunshi* (retreating corpse), *fengshi* (wind corpse), *chenshi* (sinking corpse), and *shizhu* (corpse attachment). The formulas recorded here treat all of them. Their symptoms include abdominal pain and distension, breathlessness, upward surging into the heart and chest, lateral attacks on the flanks, or the emergence of lumps, or spasms radiating to the lower back and spine.

A formula to treat them: Moxa three *cun* behind the nipple, fourteen *zhuang*—left for men, right for women. If unresolved, increase the number of *zhuang*. Recovery will follow.

Another formula: Moxa three *cun* below the heart, sixty *zhuang*.

Another formula: Moxa one *cun* below the nipple, on the left or right according to the location of the affliction, increasing the number of *zhuang* until recovery is achieved.

Another formula: With four fingers, press upon the painful area, then moxa the lower edge of the fingers for several *zhuang* until the patient feels pain. Next, pinch the philtrum above the upper lip, then pinch one *cun* below the heart, increasing the number of *zhuang* until recovery is achieved.

Another formula: Crack open a chicken egg, and swallow the white at once. If the mouth is closed, insert it into the throat and shake until it is swallowed—recovery will be immediate.

Another formula: Crack open seven pigeon eggs and swallow the whites at once; do not take a second dose.

Another formula: Roast the root of *li danglu* (Phytolacca acinosa), place it in a pouch, and apply it alternately as a hot compress, replacing it when it cools.

Though the Five Corpses bear distinct names, their patterns are largely similar, with only minor differences. The *feishi* (flying corpse) roams beneath the skin, piercing through the organs and bowels, causing stabbing pain with each onset, its manifestations ever-changing. The *dunshi* (retreating corpse) lodges in the bones and flesh, boring through the blood vessels; each attack renders the patient untouchable, triggered by the sight of a corpse or the sound of mourning. The *fengshi* (wind corpse) courses through the four limbs, with pain shifting unpredictably; each onset brings confusion, provoked by wind or snow. The *chenshi* (sinking corpse) binds the organs and bowels, surging into the heart and flanks; each attack brings excruciating pain, triggered by cold. The *shizhu* (corpse attachment) weighs down the entire body, disturbing the spirit, causing constant disorientation; it worsens with the changing of the seasons, often leading to grave consequences. This last condition has its own treatment, described later as a compress.

All Five Corpses arise from corpse-demons within the body that draw in harm; though the classical arts contain methods to dispel them, these are rarely practiced in the world today. Here, I have compiled the essential techniques from the classics to remedy this neglect.

**Section Seven: Formulas for Corpse Infusion and Ghost Infusion**

Corpse infusion and ghost infusion, as Ge states, are the "corpse infusion" among the Five Corpses, further compounded by various ghostly harms. The disease manifests in thirty-six to ninety-nine variations, generally causing alternating chills and fever, dribbling discomfort, mental confusion, and indistinct suffering that pervades the entire body. Over months and years, it gradually weakens the patient, leading to death, and after death, it spreads to others, even to the point of annihilating entire households. Upon recognizing these symptoms, one should treat it urgently.

**Formula:**
Take white mulberry bark, dry in the sun, and burn to ash, yielding about two *dou*. Place in a steamer, steam until the vapor permeates, then remove. Pour three to four *dou* of boiling water from a cauldron over the ash, strain, and repeat three times until the liquid is extremely concentrated. Allow to settle, then take two *dou* of the clear liquid to soak two *dou* of red adzuki beans overnight. Dry in the sun, then soak again in the ash liquid until exhausted. Steam the beans until fully cooked, then prepare a broth with mutton or venison and serve with the beans. Begin by consuming one to two *sheng* until satiated. Mild cases resolve with three to four *dou*; severe cases require seven to eight *dou*. As the disease departs, the body will feel a creeping itch. If the root is not fully eradicated, repeat the treatment. Divinely efficacious.

These conditions, though listed under miscellaneous treatments, also fall under the category of phlegm obstruction and *huoluan*. They may be treated according to the methods for *huoluan*. Sudden cases are rare and usually arise as complications of other illnesses—such as from unresolved cold damage, post-*huoluan* depletion and dryness, stagnation after consuming tonics for taxation damage, exposure to cold or heat evil, dietary poisoning, or improper medication.

Cholera generally arises from dietary causes—consuming raw or cold foods mixed with rich, greasy fare, wine, or raw fish—while exposed to wind, damp, or drafts, wearing thin clothing, sitting in the open, or sleeping uncovered. At the first onset, ensure warmth: spread hot coals beneath the patient’s bedding and reduce heat if excessive. Alternatively, steam quilts or clothing, replacing cold layers with warm ones. Another method is to heat the ground, douse it with hot water, cover with a thin cloth, lay a mat over it, and envelop the patient thickly. One may also fill a jar with scalding water to soak the feet up to the knees, or place a copper vessel of hot water on the abdomen, padding it with clothing and replacing it when cool. A heated iron may likewise be applied to the abdomen.

If these measures fail to induce recovery, proceed immediately to moxibustion. Follow the prescribed sequence precisely; do not apply moxa haphazardly. Treat only the afflicted area—never preemptively moxa where no illness exists. Though moxibustion may not yield instant relief, it ensures the patient will not die. Do not discontinue treatment merely because improvement is not immediate.

For cholera, use moxa cones of moderate size, with a modest number of applications. The standard recommends seven cones, though forty or fifty may be applied without harm. Revival often follows the first application.

While classical formulas such as *Li Zhong* pills, *Hou Po* (magnolia bark) with fermented soybean decoction, and *Ban Xia* (pinellia) decoctions to unblock the pulse are effective, the ingredients may be difficult to procure. Here, I outline reliable moxibustion techniques and simple, proven remedies—no less effective than costly medicines. Even in cases where death appears imminent, moxibustion may still revive the patient.

Other remedies, such as *Li Zhong* pills and *Si Shun* or *Hou Po* decoctions, should be prepared in advance each autumn for emergency use.

**Moxibustion for Sudden Cholera:**
- If abdominal pain precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones to *Tai Cang* (Great Granary), located four *cun* below the heart’s xiphoid process.
- If watery diarrhea occurs first, apply fourteen cones one *cun* beside the navel—left for men, right for women. In severe cases, increase to thirty or forty cones. This point is *Da Chang Mu* (Large Intestine Alarm Point), particularly suited for purging.
- If vomiting precedes symptoms, apply fourteen cones two *cun* below the heart. This also treats unremitting diarrhea.
- For counterflow qi, apply fifty cones to *Ju Que* (Great Gateway), one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process.
- For cold reversal in the extremities, apply seven cones to each *San Yin Jiao* (Three Yin Intersection), located three *cun* above the inner ankle’s prominence. Increase if no improvement.
- For muscle spasms, apply six or seven cones to the sole’s depression beneath the big toe (*Yong Quan*, Gushing Spring). Alternatively, apply one cone to the midpoint beneath the big toe for miraculous effect, or seven cones to the nail’s edge on the big toe.
- For spasms entering the abdomen with pain, have four assistants hold the patient’s limbs while applying fourteen cones two *cun* left of the navel. Also moxa the large tendon of the thigh, one *cun* from the groin.
- For hiccups, apply seven cones to the first crease of the wrist (*Xin Zhu*, Heart Governor), aligned with the middle finger.
- For unremitting diarrhea, apply seven cones to *Da Du* (Great Metropolis), at the inner side of the big toe’s base joint, on the border of white flesh.
- For dry heaves, apply seven cones to *Wen Shi* (Interrogator), three *cun* behind the wrist between the tendons. If reversal and vomiting are extreme, moxibustion here restores flow. *The Lesser Compendium* states this revives the dead.
- For simultaneous vomiting and diarrhea, apply seven cones to the outer edge of each nipple, near the abdomen’s white flesh. Increase to fourteen if needed.
- If vomiting ceases but diarrhea persists, apply seven cones to the navel’s center, or fourteen to one *cun* below the navel.
- For vexation and fullness, apply seven cones three *cun* below the xiphoid process (*Wei Guan*, Stomach Duct). Alternatively, place a bowl over the navel and apply fourteen cones atop it.
- For acute pain around the navel, apply twenty-one cones three *cun* below it (*Guan Yuan*, Pass Gate). Highly effective.

**Secret Moxibustion for Reviving the Dead from Cholera:**
Measure the patient’s philtrum with an object, fold it to span from the heart’s *Jiu Wei* (Turtledove Tail) downward, and moxa the measured area—first the center, then the left and right. Next, encircle the spine with an object to align with the heart’s xiphoid process, then apply seven cones one *cun* to either side of the spine. This treats three points each on the abdomen and back.

**Hua Tuo’s Method for Cholera-Induced Death:**
Call the patient’s soul from the rooftop. If all other treatments fail, lay the patient prone with arms extended. Measure the distance between the elbows with a string, then apply one hundred cones along the string’s path on either side of the spine, one *cun* from the vertebrae.

For cases unresponsive to other treatments, moxibustion may be applied to the *Zhou Zhui* (Elbow Vertebra). Tested on hundreds of patients, all rose and sat up immediately after moxibustion. Hua Tuo transmitted this technique to his descendants, who kept it secret through generations.

The above methods are all moxibustion therapies.

**For Cholera with Abdominal Distension, Pain, Restlessness, Fullness, and Shortness of Breath Before Emesis or Purgation:**

- **Formula 17:** Boil a large handful of reed catkins thickly and drink two *sheng* to cure.

**For Cramps:**
- Heat iron until red-hot and cauterize the white flesh near the heel, close to the rear. Apply the iron longitudinally along the foot, pausing to form a sore. Repeat on both feet; shortly, heat will enter the abdomen, cramps will cease, and recovery will follow. A heated knife or shrimp tail may also be used.
- Boil vinegar three times and apply with massage; adding a small amount of powder is especially effective. Bind with cotton padding from below the knee to the foot.
- Burn fourteen gardenia fruits, grind into powder, and consume.

**For Cramps Entering the Intestines (as if about to cramp):**
- Boil one *cun* of white chicken droppings with six *ge* of water for three boils; consume in one draught without the patient’s knowledge.
- Boil vinegar with clothing wadding, warm the wadding, and wrap the cramping area.
- Burn three pinches of woven straw rope, consume with wine to cure.

**For Cramps in the Abdomen:**
Invert the patient so the head is downward until the abdomen is level.

**For Cramps in the Arms, Legs, Chest, or Ribs:**
- Boil one and a half *sheng* of salt with one *dou* of water until scalding hot; soak hands and feet. For cramps in the chest or ribs, wash with the hot liquid.
- For cramps entering the abdomen, invert the patient so the head is downward until the abdomen is level. In severe cases, if the hands pull the genitals and the genitals retract, death is certain; if not yet retracted, inversion may still save the patient.

**For Unremitting Dysentery with Cramps Entering the Abdomen (Near Death):**
Tear one *liang* of fresh ginger, boil with one and a half *sheng* of wine for three to four boils; consume in one draught to cure.

**For Restlessness and Fullness in the Heart and Abdomen After Cholera-Induced Emesis and Purgation:**
Fourteen gardenia fruits, boiled with three *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; add seven *ge* of fermented soybeans, boil to yield one *sheng*, and consume in one draught. For vomiting, add two *liang* of tangerine peel. For restlessness, add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, one *liang* of licorice, one *sheng* of honey, and two *sheng* of water; divide into five doses.

**For Restlessness and Inability to Lie Still After Cholera-Induced Emesis and Purgation:**
Twenty stalks of scallion whites, twenty jujubes, boiled with three *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; consume in one draught.

**For Intense Thirst After Cholera-Induced Emesis and Purgation (Excessive Drinking is Fatal):**
Boil five *sheng* of millet with one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*; strain the clear liquid and sip gradually. Avoid other beverages.

**Master Cui’s *Li Zhong* Pill Formula:**
Three *liang* of licorice, one *liang* each of dried ginger, ginseng, and atractylodes, ground and sifted, mixed with honey into pills the size of bullets. If symptoms persist, take another pill. If still uncured, boil one *dou* of warm liquid with pork broth and consume in three to five doses until cured. May also be taken with wine.

**Fourfold Harmony Decoction:**
For unremitting emesis, purgation, dry abdomen, retching, and cold hands and feet. Two *liang* each of dried ginger, licorice, ginseng, and aconite, boiled with six *sheng* of water to yield three and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. For unremitting diarrhea, add one *liang* of dragon bone.

If abdominal pain is severe, add two *liang* of tangkuei. **Hu Qia**’s version uses one aconite root and one *liang* of cinnamon.

For cholera morbus without vomiting or diarrhea but with sunken pulses in the limbs, cold flesh, sweating, and thirst, recovery follows.

**Magnolia Bark Decoction:**
For vexation, retching, and abdominal distension. Four *liang* of roasted magnolia bark, two *liang* of cinnamon, five roasted *gorgon fruit*, and three *liang* of fresh ginger, boiled with six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into three doses.

These four decoctions treat all cholera morbus afflictions and should not be left uncompounded.

If cholera morbus presents with particularly severe heart pain, this indicates toxin involvement; treat concurrently with remedies for *zhong’e* (sudden noxious attack).

**Formulas for Cold Damage, Seasonal Qi, and Epidemic Diseases (Chapter Thirteen)**

For cold damage, seasonal qi, epidemic diseases, headache, high fever, and large pulses on the first day:
Take approximately three *sheng* of *zhidui* root and leaves, pound together with one *liang* of cinnabar, boil with one *sheng* of water, strain to yield juice, and consume in one dose; vomiting indicates recovery. For severe cases, consume one *sheng* entirely, cover thickly to induce sweating, and recover.

Another formula:
Pound one *sheng* of garlic to yield two *ge* of juice; consume in one dose. Recovery follows no more than two doses.

Another formula:
Fourteen black plums and five *ge* of salt, boiled with three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose.

Another formula:
Peel the black bark from fresh *zhimu* wood, finely chop one *sheng* of the white inner part, boil with two *sheng* and five *ge* of water, strain, and consume eight *ge* per dose; three doses cure.

Another formula:
Knead twenty-seven *muwanzi* seeds in five *sheng* of water until ripe, strain, and consume all the juice to induce vomiting and diarrhea, curing the illness.

Another formula:
Place one chicken egg in half a *sheng* of cold water, stir to blend, then boil three *sheng* of water to a rolling boil. Pour the egg mixture into the boiling water, stir rapidly to combine, adjust to a warm temperature, and consume in one dose to induce sweating.

Another formula:
Apply cinnabar over the entire body, face the fire, and sit until sweating occurs to recover.

Another formula:
Pound fresh *ranghe* root and leaves together, strain to yield juice, and consume three to four *sheng*.

Another formula:
Boil three *jin* of dried mugwort with one *dou* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose to induce sweating.

Another formula:
Consume one *sheng* of salt, followed by hot water; abdominal cramping and vomiting should follow. Cover to induce sweating and recover.

Another formula:
Boil one hundred fifty-seven *bishu* coins in one *dou* of water to yield seven *sheng*; consume all the juice. Shortly after, boil again with five *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*, then add two *sheng* of water to combine for three *sheng*. Remove the coins and drink the juice to induce vomiting and expel toxins.

Another formula:
Take a piece of lard the size of a bullet, consume warm, three times daily for three days (nine doses total).

Another formula:
Take thirty black plums, remove the pits, and boil with one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and three *sheng* of bitter wine to yield one and a half *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose.

Furthermore, as cold damage disorders have several types and people cannot distinguish them, a single remedy may address all: if one initially feels headache, feverish flesh, and a surging pulse, within the first or second day, prepare the Scallion and Fermented Soybean Decoction.
Use one handful of scallion whites and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, boil with three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*, and consume in one dose to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare again, adding two *liang* of kudzu root and three *liang* of cimicifuga, with five *sheng* of water; decoct to yield two *sheng* and divide into two doses, which will surely induce sweating. If sweating still does not occur, further add two *liang* of ephedra, then grind two *ge* of rice with scallion decoction, boil with one *sheng* of water for a short time, add salt and fermented soybeans, followed by the scallion whites; decoct over fire to yield three *sheng* and divide into doses to induce sweating.

Another formula:
Boil one *sheng* of fermented soybeans with three *sheng* of young boy’s urine to yield one *sheng*; divide into two doses and consume to induce sweating.

Another formula:
Boil four *liang* of kudzu root with one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, then add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and decoct to yield one and a half *sheng*; consume in one dose. Pound fresh kudzu to extract the juice and consume one to two *sheng*—this is also excellent.

If sweating persists without cessation after three or four days, and the chest feels unwell, inducing vomiting is desired: boil three *sheng* of fermented soybeans with seven *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; strain, add one *liang* of honey, and boil again for three bubblings. Consume in one dose and rest quietly to induce vomiting. If recovery does not follow, consume again until recovery.

This esoteric method is transmitted to descendants.

Another formula:
Finely chop three *jin* of fresh rehmannia root, boil with one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, and divide into three doses. Alternatively, consume the *Hualu Tusan* or *Kushen Longdan San*.

For cases lasting five or six days or more:
Prepare a large quantity of green bamboo sap, simmer briefly to reduce slightly, and drink frequently; cover thickly to induce sweating.

Another formula:
Boil half a *liang* each of rhubarb, coptis, phellodendron, and gardenia with eight *sheng* of water for six or seven bubblings; add one *sheng* of fermented soybeans and seven stalks of scallion, then boil to yield three *sheng*. Divide and consume—suitable for both elderly and young.

Another formula:
Boil two *liang* of flavescent sophora and two *liang* of scutellaria with half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia in eight *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; divide into two doses. If vomiting or purging of toxins occurs, recovery follows.

For cases lasting six or seven days with extreme heat, heart vexation, delirious speech, visions of ghosts, and a desire to rise and flee:
Boil three *sheng* of dried evodia fruit with two *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain, and consume at a moderate temperature. Sweating will bring recovery. This formula is highly reliable and must be used—an esoteric method.

Another formula:
Take one *sheng* of large earthworms, split and remove the contents, then boil in human urine until done; strain and consume. Alternatively, extract fresh juice or decoct in water—both are effective.

Another method:
Extract juice from feces, consuming several *ge* to one or two *sheng*—this is called *Huanglong Tang* ("Yellow Dragon Decoction"), with aged feces being best.

Another formula:
Take a white dog, split it open from the back to collect its blood—more is better. While still warm, apply it thickly to the chest; remove once cooled. This revives those on the verge of death. If no white dog is available, any pure-colored dog may be used.

Another formula:
Remove the black outer layer of paulownia bark, tear it into fine strips, and cut into four-*cun* lengths to form bundles. Boil with five *ge* of wine and one *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; strain and consume in one dose. Vomiting or purging of several *sheng* of green-yellow fluid will bring recovery.

Another formula:
Mix three chicken eggs, a *fangcunbi* of mirabilite, and three *ge* of wine; stir until the mirabilite dissolves completely, then consume.

Another formula:
Boil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron and scutellaria, and fourteen gardenia fruits in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into two doses. This treats vexation, vomiting, and insomnia.

For those on the verge of death from epidemic qi:
Boil a thousand coins’ worth of coffin wood to make a decoction.

Another method:
Steep one *liang* of flavescent sophora (crushed) in two and a half *sheng* of wine—older formulas use wine to decoct flavescent sophora, reducing it to one and a half *sheng*. Strain, adjust to a moderate temperature, and consume entirely. The patient will experience intense cold and vomit toxins resembling molten glue, then recover.

Another formula:
Boil one hundred coins in one *dou* of water to yield eight *sheng*; grind a *dangmenzi*-sized piece of musk into powder and administer gradually until finished. This may induce sweating or vomiting.

For warm toxin with maculae and severe epidemics difficult to cure—*Heigao* ("Black Paste"):
Chop half a *jin* of fresh rehmannia, combine with one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans and two *jin* of lard, and boil for five or six bubblings until reduced by one-third. Strain, then add powdered realgar and musk the size of large soybeans; mix well and consume entirely. Toxins will exit through the skin, bringing recovery.

Another formula:
Use a live toad, split its abdomen to remove the intestines, then pound and consume raw. Dried toads from the fifth day of the fifth month, burned to ash, are also effective.

*Heinu Wan* ("Black Slave Pill"), as recorded in *Hu Qia* and *Xiaopin*, is also called *Shuijie Wan* ("Water-Resolving Pill"). Another version adds one *liang* of charred wheat husks, naming it *Mainu Wan* ("Wheat Slave Pill"). The annotations are consistent.

Ingredients:
Two *liang* each of ephedra and rhubarb, one *liang* each of scutellaria and mirabilite, one *liang* of pot-bottom soot, two *liang* of stove chimney soot, and two *liang* of roof beam dust. Pound the ingredients, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of a bullet. Grind one pill in five *ge* of freshly drawn water and consume in one dose. If thirsty, drink water; soon, a chilling sensation will arise, followed by sweating and resolution. If no effect is observed after the time it takes for the sun to move five *chi*, consume another pill. This treats cases of five or six days with intense chest heat and lockjaw, known as "ruined illness," which is otherwise incurable—use this *Heinu Wan*.

Another formula:
Boil four *liang* of indigo plant, two *liang* each of licorice and donkey-hide gelatin, and eight *ge* of fermented soybeans in one *dou* of water. First boil the indigo and licorice to yield three and a half *sheng*; strain, add the fermented soybeans, and boil for three bubblings. Strain again, then add the gelatin and divide into four doses. Consume entirely, then prepare another batch. This is highly effective for cases lasting seven or eight days with unresolved heat after sweating or vomiting, or with intense heat.

Another formula:
Pound two *liang* of rhubarb, two *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of ephedra, thirty apricot kernels, five *ge* of mirabilite, one *liang* of scutellaria, and twenty stir-fried croton seeds; mix with honey to form pills the size of soybeans. Consume three pills to purge toxins. If purging does not cease, use rice water to stop it. Household members attending the patient may also consume this first to purge, preventing contagion. These pills may be prepared in advance.

For resolving muscle layer (heat) on the first or second day:
Boil one *liang* each of ephedra, licorice, cimicifuga, peony, and gypsum, thirty apricot kernels, and three cowrie shells in three *sheng* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose. Cover to induce sweating, then recovery follows. Consume fermented soybean porridge afterward to replenish deficiency.

Another formula:
Boil two *liang* of ephedra, one *liang* each of scutellaria and cinnamon, and three *liang* of fresh ginger in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*; divide into four doses.

Alternatively, consume *Gegen Jieji Tang* ("Pueraria Muscle-Resolving Decoction"):
Boil four *liang* of pueraria root, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* each of ephedra, indigo plant, licorice, scutellaria, gypsum, and cinnamon, and four jujubes in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses to induce mild sweating.

For cases persisting from three to seven or eight days without resolution, *Xiao Chaihu Tang* ("Minor Bupleurum Decoction") may be administered:
Boil eight *liang* of bupleurum, three *liang* each of ginseng, licorice, and scutellaria, eight *liang* of fresh ginger (or three *liang* of dried ginger if unavailable), five *liang* of pinellia (washed in hot water), and twelve jujubes in nine *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover lightly to induce sweating for half a day, and recovery should follow shortly. If improvement is not observed, prepare another dose.

If heat and excess persist despite sweating, accompanied by fullness, pain, vexation, and delirious speech, *Da Chaihu Tang* ("Major Bupleurum Decoction") may be administered:
Boil half a *jin* of bupleurum, two *liang* of rhubarb, three *liang* of scutellaria, two *liang* of peony, ten pieces of unripe bitter orange, five *liang* of pinellia (washed), five *liang* of fresh ginger, and twelve jujubes in one *dou* of water to yield four *sheng*; divide into four doses. Mild purgation should follow.

These four formulas are of the utmost urgency. If medicine can be obtained promptly, one need not resort to other measures, and death may be averted. All other minor treatments are merely precautionary or for extreme cases.

If the illness is mistreated or fails to resolve after ten days or more, it is termed a "ruined disease," and only *Da Xiao Biejia Tang* ("Major and Minor Turtle Shell Decoctions") should be administered. As this formula requires many ingredients in small quantities, it is not feasible for emergency use and thus is not recorded here.

In all cases of cold damage where sweating is induced, avoid excessive fluid loss. A single dose should produce mild sweating; once the sweat clears, cease further administration. If sweating persists, apply powder and avoid drafts.

When cold damage first manifests with generalized heaviness, lumbar and back pain, unremitting vexation, a floating pulse, a face flushed with brocade-like macules, sore throat, or diarrhea, or with delirious speech and a desire to flee, this is termed "yang toxin." It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:
Boil one *fen* each of realgar, licorice, cimicifuga, Chinese angelica, Sichuan pepper, and cinnamon in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose.

If the body feels heavy and the back stiff, with a sensation of being beaten, abdominal pain, epigastric rigidity, shortness of breath, retching, cyanotic lips, a dark complexion, cold limbs, and a pulse that is deep, fine, tight, and rapid, this is termed "yin toxin." It is treatable within five days; beyond this, death ensues. The following formula is appropriate:
Boil two *fen* each of licorice and cimicifuga, one *fen* each of Chinese angelica and Sichuan pepper, and one *liang* of turtle shell in five *sheng* of water to yield two and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses. Cover to induce sweating. If sweating does not occur, prepare another dose by decocting the ingredients again.

For yin toxin with cold mouth and nose, grind one *fen* each of dried ginger and cinnamon into powder and consume with three *ge* of warm wine; this should produce intense heat and lead to recovery.

Yin and yang toxins do not only appear at the onset but may also develop after one or two days. All such cases should be treated with the aforementioned formulas. Most patients with these conditions succumb to the illness.

For heat disease that fails to resolve and leads to severe diarrhea with impending death, administer *Da Qing Tang* ("Major Indigo Decoction"):
Boil four *liang* of indigo plant, three *liang* of licorice, two *liang* of donkey-hide gelatin, eight *ge* of fermented soybeans, and three *liang* of red halloysite in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide into three doses. If the decoction is exhausted, prepare another. Administer two doses day and night to achieve recovery.

Another formula:
Boil one *sheng* of fermented soybeans, fourteen gardenia fruits, and one handful of Chinese leek in five *sheng* of water to yield three and a half *sheng*; divide into three doses.

Another formula:
Crush half a *jin* of dragon bone and boil in one *dou* of water to yield five *sheng*. Consume the decoction extremely cold in small sips. If sweating occurs at any point, recovery follows.

Another formula:
Form pills the size of parasol seeds with two *liang* each of coptis and Chinese angelica, one *liang* of dried ginger, two *liang* of red halloysite, and honey. Consume twenty pills, three times during the day and twice at night.

Another formula:
Boil two *liang* of coptis and a piece of processed mugwort the size of a duck egg in two *dou* of water to yield one *sheng*; consume in one dose to achieve immediate cessation. This formula governs all epidemic dysentery.

For all epidemic dysentery, boil three *liang* of coptis, two *liang* each of phellodendron, Chinese angelica, and dragon bone in six *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*.

In recent years, there has been an epidemic disease causing sores to erupt on the head, face, and body, spreading rapidly like fire sores, all filled with white pus. If ruptured, new sores form immediately. If not treated promptly, severe cases often result in death. Even after recovery, the scars remain purple-black for over a year before fading. This is caused by virulent toxic qi.

It is said that in the fourth year of Yonghui (653 CE), these sores spread from west to east across the land. Boiling mallow and consuming it with garlic paste was found to halt the condition. Eating it at the onset of symptoms, even with a small amount of rice, is effective.

This disease was acquired during the Jianwu era (25–56 CE) in Nanyang while fighting the barbarians, hence it was called "barbarian sores." Various physicians collaborated on treatments, and the following effective remedies were developed:

Apply high-quality honey to the entire body. Alternatively, decoct *shengma* in honey and consume frequently.

Another remedy: Boil *shengma* thoroughly in water, soak cotton in the liquid, and wash the sores. Soaking in vinegar is even better, though the pain may be unbearable.

Other treatments follow the methods for cold damage, but one must be vigilant against the toxicity.

Using *dihuang* black ointment is also effective.

For epidemic jaundice, the following remedy may be used:

Boil six *liang* of *yinchen*, two *liang* of rhubarb, and twelve gardenia fruits in one *dou* of water. First boil *yinchen* until five *sheng* remain, strain, then add the other ingredients and boil until three *sheng* remain. Divide into four doses. Other treatments for jaundice may also be combined for efficacy.

In recent years, there has also been a "barbarian jaundice" disease. Initially, one feels heaviness and discomfort in the limbs. Soon after, yellowing appears in the eyes, gradually spreading to the face and eventually the entire body. Immediately test the urine with white paper; if the paper turns yellow like turmeric dye, the heat toxin has entered internally, and urgent treatment is required.

At the first sign, prepare *guadi* and red bean powder and blow it into the nose. If several *sheng* of yellow fluid discharge from the nose, recovery is likely.

If the condition has progressed deeply, inspect the underside of the tongue for two prominent white veins. Use a reed knife to incise them, allowing several *sheng* of purple blood to drain, which will provide relief. However, this must be performed by someone experienced in the procedure. Inexperienced incisions may damage the blue veins under the tongue, causing unstoppable bleeding and death.

Alternatively, heat an iron spindle until red-hot and cauterize the veins to scorch them. Combine *guadi* and *badou* into pills and consume to induce discharge of yellow fluid through the stool and urine. After cauterization, avoid all杂食.

It is also said that one may sit on yellow earth to alleviate jaundice, but this must be distinguished from other conditions.

Remedies include:

Boil bamboo and drink the liquid like tea.

Another remedy: Pound fresh *gua* roots, extract the juice, and drink one to two or three *sheng*.

Another remedy: Soak chicken eggs in vinegar overnight and swallow the whites of several eggs.

Another remedy: Cut five *sheng* of bamboo leaves, seven *sheng* of wheat, and three *liang* of gypsum. Grind into powder, wrap in cotton, and boil in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water until seven *sheng* remain. Consume one *sheng* per dose until finished for a cure.

Another remedy: Mix two *sheng* of fresh *ge* root juice, one *sheng* of high-quality *chi*, twenty-one gardenia fruits, and one *sheng* of chopped *yinchen*. Boil in five *sheng* of water until three *sheng* remain, strain, add the *ge* juice, and divide into five doses.

Another remedy: Prepare a golden-footed hen as one would for eating. Consume the meat and broth thoroughly, adding a small amount of salted *chi* for flavor. If not cured, repeat the treatment.

For toxic attack causing swelling and pain in the hands and feet, as if about to sever, the following remedies may be used:

Chop *huzhang* root, boil, and soak the feet in the liquid at an appropriate temperature, stopping when the water reaches just above the ankles.

Another remedy: Soak the feet in rice-straw ash liquid.

Another remedy: Boil *kushen* in wine and soak the feet until cured.

Another remedy: Pound one *sheng* each of salted *chi* and sheep urine until well-mixed, then soak the affected area.

Another remedy: Finely chop five *jin* of *huangbo*, boil in three *dou* of water, and soak the affected area. This also treats swelling and pain in the private parts.

Another remedy: Dig a pit three *chi* deep, just large enough to hold both feet. Heat the pit thoroughly, then pour wine into it. Step into the pit wearing clogs, ensuring the steam is contained and does not escape.

Another remedy: Boil *yangtao* juice and soak the affected area; adding a small amount of salted *chi* is especially effective.

Another remedy: Boil horse dung or sheep dung in water and soak the affected area.

Another remedy: Mix sheep dung with lard and apply to the swelling; this is also effective.

Another remedy: Wrap the swollen area with beef, and the swelling will subside and pain cease.

Another remedy: Pound *changsicao*, extract the juice, and soak the feet in it.

Another remedy: Boil one pig’s trotter with scallions, remove the dregs, add a small amount of salt, and soak the affected area.

For toxic disease causing sores in the lower body, burn a *guan* vessel and insert the ashes deeply as a suppository; no more than three applications are needed.

Another remedy: Apply raw lacquer and insert it with cotton.

Another remedy: Form large moxa cones and apply moxibustion to the lower body—this is a last resort when no other medicine is available.

Another remedy: Take three *sheng* of earthworms, boil in five *sheng* of water until two and a half *sheng* remain, and consume the entire decoction.

Another remedy: Boil peach bark until it reduces to a syrup-like consistency, then combine with cotton for insertion.

Another remedy: Pound water *xingcai*, wrap in cotton, and insert; replace five times daily until cured.

Another remedy: Boil *ju* bark and *hu* bark together until the liquid thickens like malt sugar, then use for insertion.

Another: A thick decoction of boiled peach bark, taken as a drink, is most effective.

Another remedy: Pound *shemei* to extract the juice, take three *ge* three times daily. Soak black plums in water until concentrated, then add honey from cliff bees, and drink frequently.

If the patient’s teeth lose their color, the tongue turns white, or they become excessively drowsy, confused, and insensitive to pain, or if they suffer from diarrhea, urgently treat the lower body. Those who do not recognize this will only address the upper body, neglecting the lower, allowing worms to grow in the lower body. These worms will consume the anus, and when the anus rots to reveal the five viscera, death follows.

Remedy: Take egg white, mix with lacquer, return it to the eggshell, and swallow it while facing upward. This will induce vomiting of the worms, leading to recovery.

Another remedy: Burn horse hooves to ash, grind finely, mix with lard, and apply to cotton for insertion into the lower body several times daily until cured.

Another remedy: Boil fifteen peach kernels, two *sheng* of bitter wine, and one *ge* of salt until six *ge* remain, then consume.

Another remedy: Burn mugwort in a tube to fumigate the lower body, allowing the smoke to enter. Mix a small amount of realgar into the mugwort—this method is used for *xiwen* (stream warmth), hence the inclusion of its treatment.

For incessant diarrhea from an unknown cause: Two *liang* of *wutou*, one *liang* each of *nüwei* and *yunshi*, and two *fen* of *gui*. Form into honey pills the size of *tongzi* seeds, and take five pills with water three times daily.

For sudden pain in the lower body resembling a bird’s pecking: Pound one *sheng* each of red adzuki beans and large beans, place in two pouches, steam until hot, and alternate sitting on them to cure. This was originally recorded in the miscellaneous treatments section and is also caused by toxic *qi* from cold damage.

Thus, while there are many remedies for cold damage—including those using *mahuang*, *gegen*, *guizhi*, *chaihu*, *qinglong*, *baihu*, *sishun*, and *sini*, totaling over twenty essential formulas—the ingredients are difficult to fully prepare. Moreover, diagnosis must be precise, and other comprehensive formulas are recorded elsewhere. Here, only the four most urgently needed formulas are included. The *huanggao* and *chisang* remedies are found in the disease-prevention section and should be prepared in advance; take them at the first sign of illness.

Cold damage (*shanghan*), seasonal epidemics (*shixing*), and warm epidemics (*wenyi*) are three names for the same category of illness, though their origins differ slightly. When one is harmed by cold in winter, or when sweating from strenuous activity exposes one to wind and cold, the illness manifests in summer—this is called *shanghan*. When winter is not very cold, and warm air or westerly winds cause the joints to relax and become susceptible, the illness manifests in spring—this is called *shixing*. When pestilential *qi* and demonic toxins afflict a person in a given year, it is called *wenbing*. Though the diagnostic signs are similar, and refined discourse prefers the general term *shanghan*, common people call it *shixing*. Daoist talismans and inscriptions also distinguish the *five warm* diseases, but ultimately, they share the same path. However, there are differences such as *yangming*, *shaoyang*, *yin* toxin, and *yang* toxin. Cases of *shaoyin* disease that do not involve fever but present with abdominal fullness and diarrhea are the most difficult to treat.

In summer, decoct with licorice—its color becomes amber-like and lovely, fit for storage. When tasted, it is sweet and fine. Place the decoction in a jar, chill in a well until it becomes as cold as water, and store in white porcelain or silver vessels. Sip it like tea; contemporaries call it *cold drink* and hold it in higher esteem than tea. It can break menstrual block in women—pound, steep in wine, and take regularly. Pregnant women must not take it, as it breaks the blood.

**Formulas for Seasonal Epidemic Relapse and Overstrain (Chapter Fourteen)**
For all *toxin diseases* after recovery, within one hundred days, prohibit pork, dog, and mutton, as they harm the blood; also avoid fatty fish, long-stored grease, and dried fish, as they will invariably cause severe dysentery—once diarrhea begins, it cannot be saved. Further prohibit wheat-based foods, garlic, leeks, scallions, raw vegetables, and shrimp [ ], as consuming these often leads to relapse, making treatment difficult and causing repeated outbreaks in subsequent years.

**Formulas for Overstrain After Severe Illness, Early Exertion, or Excessive Eating and Drinking Leading to Mortal Danger**
Burn tortoise plastron and take one *fangcunbi*.

Another formula: Take a small amount of *hufen* with water.

Another formula: Mix three *sheng* of powder with warm water and ingest; cover thickly to induce sweating.

Another formula: Boil one handful of dried perilla in five *sheng* of water to yield two *sheng*, and consume entirely. If no dried perilla is available, fresh may be used, adding four *liang* of fresh ginger and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans.

Another formula: Take fourteen double-pointed rat droppings, half a *sheng* of fermented soybeans, and boil in three *sheng* of water until half remains; consume at once. Cover warmly to induce sweating to resolve. Adding one *sheng* of hemp seeds and one *sheng* of water enhances the effect. May also add *zhishi* and a handful of scallion whites.

Another formula: Boil two *liang* each of *dahuang* and *mahuang*, fourteen *zhizi* kernels, and one *sheng* of fermented soybeans in five *sheng* of water to yield three *sheng*; divide and take twice to induce slight sweating and diarrhea.

Another formula: Thickly decoct *ganpi* and ingest—*lugen* is also excellent.

For relapse due to excessive exertion: Burn cooked rice, sift to powder, and take one *fangcunbi* for effect.

**Formulas for Relapse from Sexual Intercourse, with Swollen Testicles or Retraction into the Abdomen, Abdominal Colic, or Urinary Block**
Burn a woman’s menstrual cloth and take one *fangcunbi*.

Another formula: Take one [ ] egg, strike it thirty-six times, place at the door, and have the patient run until panting; then pierce below the ribs to draw one *sheng* of blood, mix with one *sheng* of wine, and drink. If no [ ] is available, take the blood alone, but avoid cold immediately afterward. Use *jia* [ ].

Another formula: Cover the man with the clothing of the woman with whom he had intercourse for the time it takes to eat a meal to revive.

Another formula: Take the shinbone and blood of *jia* [ ], mix with wine, and drink to resolve.

Another formula: Scrape two *sheng* of green bamboo shavings, boil in three *sheng* of water until it bubbles five or six times, then strain and discard the dregs. Take the bamboo shaving decoction warm. This formula also broadly treats *overstrain relapse*.

Another formula: Grind one *fen* of *fanshi* and three *fen* of *xiaoshi* to powder, mix with barley porridge water, and take one *fangcunbi* at a time—*heat toxin* will exit with urine and stool.

Another formula: Take a large handful of knotweed seeds, crush in water to extract juice, and drink one *sheng*. If dried, thickly extract the juice and ingest. Pound scallion bulbs, mix with bitter wine, and take—also excellent.

Another formula: Extract juice from several *sheng* of earthworms and ingest for effect.

If a recovered man has intercourse with a sick woman, or a recovered woman with a sick man, the healthy partner contracts *yin exchange*, while the sick partner relapses—those who relapse will surely die.

For sudden *yin exchange* disease, whether in men or women with *warm disease*, even if recovered for several decades, if blood vessels remain unharmonized and *heat toxin* lingers, intercourse will transmit the disease, called *yin exchange*, which kills more swiftly than seasonal epidemics—treat urgently.

The patient experiences bodily heaviness, acute heat in the lower abdomen, swelling ascending to the chest, inability to lift the head due to its weight, the growth of *membranous obstructions* in the eyes, and cramping of the knees and shins so severe as to approach death. The following formula may be used:

Take a woman’s undergarment that has touched her private parts, cut a portion, burn it to ash, and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* three times daily. If urination becomes smooth and the genitals show slight swelling, recovery is imminent. A young girl’s undergarment is also effective. If the patient is female, a man’s undergarment may be used instead.

Another formula: Take fourteen *mouse droppings* (pointed at both ends), one handful of indigo, and five *sheng* of water. Boil to reduce to two *sheng* and ingest the entire decoction, then cover warmly to induce sweating.

Another formula: Take twenty-four earthworms and one *dou* of water. Boil to reduce to three *sheng* and ingest in one dose, then induce sweating—this is also effective.

Another formula: Grind four *liang* of dried ginger into powder, mix with hot water, and ingest at once. Cover warmly to induce sweating, and cease once relief is obtained.

Another formula: At the first sign of illness in a man, immediately apply moxibustion to the genitals—thirty-seven cones. If the condition persists, increase to one hundred cones, and recovery will follow. The eyes will remain unharmed, and genital sores will return to normal.

When two men or two women engage in intercourse, they do not transmit *yin exchange* to one another; thus, the term *exchange* refers to the interchange of yin and yang.

To prevent relapse in a convalescent patient, take twenty fingernail clippings from a woman’s hands and feet, along with a one-*chi* length of the lower hem of her undergarment. Burn to ash and ingest with wine or rice broth.

After recovering from a severe illness, even slight exertion may cause nosebleeds. Grind ten parts oyster shell and five parts gypsum into powder and ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with wine three or four times daily. Alternatively, form into honeyed pills the size of *wutong* seeds and ingest accordingly.

After recovering from a severe illness, excessive sweating—including from the eyes—may occur. Use equal parts eucommia bark and oyster shell, ground into powder. Ingest five *spoonfuls* with water before bedtime; if sweating persists, repeat the dose.

Another formula: Grind two *liang* each of licorice and gypsum into powder. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with fermented rice water twice daily to resolve the condition.

Another formula: Grind dragon bone, oyster shell, and ephedra root into powder, mix with talcum, and dust the body—this is highly effective.

For post-recovery restlessness, insomnia, eye pain, and vexation:
Take seven *ge* of fermented soybeans and fourteen black plums. Boil the plums in four *sheng* of water until reduced to two and a half *sheng*, then add the soybeans and boil to one and a half *sheng*. Divide into two doses. If black plums are unavailable, use fourteen gardenia fruits instead.

Another formula: Boil four *liang* of coptis, two *liang* of peony, one *liang* of scutellaria, and three small sticks of donkey-hide gelatin in six *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. Two egg yolks may also be added.

Another formula: Take one *dan* of flowing water from a thousand-*li* source, agitate it ten thousand times, then take two and a half *dou*. Wash two *liang* of pinellia, add one *dou* of glutinous rice and four *liang* of poria, and boil to five *sheng*. Divide into five doses.

**Supplementary Formula (from *Master Mei’s Prescriptions*)**:
For post-recovery relapse triggered by intercourse, causing extreme debility, inability to open the eyes, or speechlessness:
Boil thirty gardenia fruits in three *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and ingest.

Take one *liang* each of hemp seeds, cypress seeds, dried ginger, and asarum, along with half a *liang* of prepared aconite. Grind into powder, and at dawn, have each household member ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with well water. In severe epidemics, take three doses daily.

**Lord Lao’s Divine White Powder**:
Grind one *liang* of atractylodes, three *liang* of aconite, four *liang* of Sichuan aconite, two and a half *liang* of platycodon, and one *liang* of asarum into powder. At dawn, ingest one *qian-spoonful*. If one household prepares this, an entire village will remain free of illness. Carrying it while traveling will dispel pathogenic qi upon encounter. If others fall ill, administer one *square-inch spoonful* with warm wine. For those ill for four or five days, boil one *spoonful* in three *sheng* of water, ingest one *sheng*, and cover to induce sweating.

**Red Powder Formula**:
Grind five *fen* each of moutan bark and prepared gleditsia pods, three *fen* each of asarum, dried ginger, and aconite, two *fen* of cinnamon bark, four *fen* of true pearl, and four *fen* of *zhizhu* into powder. At the first sign of stiffness or malaise, insert a small amount into the nostrils to induce vomiting. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* with warm wine, cover to induce sweating, and recovery will follow. When traveling at dawn or night or visiting the sick, dusting the body with a small amount is also beneficial. For livestock epidemics, place one *spoonful* under the tongue and administer urine as a wash three or four times daily—highly effective.

**Mountain Miasma Powder**:
To ward off mountain miasma and malignant qi, or when encountering black fog, oppressive vapors, or warm winds from the southwest—all harbingers of epidemics:
Grind five *fen* each of ephedra and Sichuan pepper, three *fen* of Sichuan aconite, and one *fen* each of asarum, atractylodes, saposhnikovia, platycodon, cinnamon bark, and dried ginger into powder. At dawn, ingest one *spoonful* with wine. Particularly effective for those exposed to toxic qi while traveling through mist.

**Taiyi Flowing Gold Formula**:
Grind three *liang* of realgar, two *liang* of orpiment, one and a half *liang* each of alum and *ghost arrows*, and two *liang* of goat horn into powder. Store one *liang* in a triangular crimson pouch, wear it over the heart, and hang it on doorways. On the first day of the month, wrap one *knife-point* of the powder in blue cloth, burn it in the courtyard, and have the sick inhale the fumes to recover.

**Epidemic Warding Pill**:
Grind equal parts realgar, cinnabar, croton seeds, alum, aconite, and dried ginger into powder, mix with honey, and form into pills the size of sesame seeds. At dawn, face the sun and swallow one pill daily for nine days to remain disease-free.

**Common Powder for Warding Off Warm Diseases**:
Grind one *fen* each of true pearl and cinnamon bark, three *fen* of fritillaria (roasted), and three *fen* of egg white (roasted until yellow-black) into powder. Ingest one *square-inch spoonful* on New Year’s Day. If illnesses are prevalent that year, take it on the first and fifteenth of each month. Those already ill will experience significant improvement.

**Tiger-Head Ghost-Killing Formula**:
Five *liang* of tiger skull bone, one and a half *liang* each of cinnabar, realgar, and orpiment, one *liang* each of *podophyllum*, *Gleditsia sinensis*, and *Ligusticum sinense*; grind into powder, mix with beeswax and honey to form pellets the size of bullets, store in a crimson pouch, and tie to the arm—left for men, right for women. Hang one in each corner of the house. On the nights of the new and full moon, burn one pellet in the courtyard at midnight. An alternate formula includes *Acorus calamus* and *Veratrum* but omits tiger skull, *podophyllum*, and *Gleditsia sinensis*; grind into powder and carry on the person.

**Zhao Quan’s Yellow Ointment Formula**:
One *liang* each of rhubarb, aconite, *Asarum*, dried ginger, Sichuan pepper, and cinnamon; eighty croton seeds (remove kernels and husks). Grind finely, soak in bitter wine overnight, then cook with two *jin* of lard rendered in the twelfth lunar month, stirring three times up and three times down. Strain, store in a honeyed vessel. At the first sign of sudden flush or fever, take one pill the size of a *wu* seed; if unresolved, take another. Rubbing the ointment over the body with heated hands hundreds of times is also effective. It treats *zei*-wind* and wandering qi in the skin. Prepare in advance for immediate use.

Take one pill before the episode begins; if it does not cease, take another.

Another remedy: Take one spider, seal it tightly in a reed tube, and tie the tube around the neck. Remove it only after the episode has passed.

Another remedy: At sunrise, face east and bow twice. Then kneel upright, clasp hands toward the sun, and hold your breath. Use ink to mark each ear seven times, then write with cinnabar on the tongue, saying, “Die on the *zi* day.” Bow twice again, leave without looking back, lie down calmly, and refrain from eating. The episode will cease after its time has passed.

Another remedy: Grind one *square-inch spoonful* of *longgu* (dragon bone) into powder. One hour before the episode, boil in one and a half *sheng* of wine for three boils, then consume while hot. Cover to induce sweating, and it will be effective immediately.

Another remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan*, half a *liang* of *gancao*, and one *liang* of *zhimu*, pound into powder, and form pills with honey. At the onset of the episode, take ten pills the size of *wutong* seeds. For subsequent doses, reduce to seven or eight pills, then five or six pills, and the disease will be cured.

Another remedy: Two hours before the episode, place a charcoal fire under the bed to warm the spine and feet thoroughly. Cover with blankets, and cease after the episode has passed. This treats cases where cold precedes heat.

Another remedy: Take three *liang* of *changshan*, pound into powder, and mix with egg white to form pills.

For malaria of any duration, even up to thirty years: Take three *liang* each of *changshan* and *huanglian*, steep in one *dou* of wine overnight, then boil in an earthenware pot in the morning to reduce to six *sheng*. Take eight *ge* per dose, ensuring three doses before the onset of the episode. If hot, vomiting will occur; if cold, diarrhea will follow. No case will fail to be cured. Half the formula suffices.

For chronic labor malaria unresponsive to various treatments: Take a large handful of fresh *niuxi* (achyranthes), boil in six *sheng* of water, and reduce to two *sheng*. Take one dose on an empty stomach and another at the onset of the episode.

To ward off all malaria: On the day of onset, hold a rooster and make it crow loudly at the same time—no case will fail to be cured.

Another remedy: Before the onset, lie facing south. At the five centers (palms, soles, and crown) and the forehead and tongue—seven places in total—hold the breath and write the character for "ghost."

Incantation method: On the day of onset, hold a stone by the water’s edge and chant in one breath: *"Yuanyuan yuanyuan, xinglu fei nan, zhuoqu nuegui, song yu heguan. Jiji ru lüling."* Cast the stone into the water without looking back.

For all malaria, the *Wumei* (mume) pill formula: Two *liang* of *gancao*, two *liang* each of roasted *wumei* (mume) flesh, *renshen* (ginseng), *guixin* (cinnamon bark), *roucongrong* (cistanche), *zhimu*, and *mudan* (moutan), three *liang* each of *changshan*, *shengma* (cimicifuga), roasted *taoren* (peach kernel, peeled and pitted), and roasted *wudoupi* (black soybean skin).

**Chapter Seventeen: Remedies for Sudden Onset of Manic-Depressive Illness**

For sudden manic illness: Moxa three cones at the center of the penis. Recovery follows when urination becomes unobstructed.

Another remedy: Moxa three cones on the penis and fourteen cones at the seam below the scrotum.

Another remedy: Moxa three cones on each nipple, seven cones at the base of the big toe where the hairs converge, and seven cones at the base of the little toe.

Another remedy: Take one *sheng* of *tingli* (lepidium seed), pound three thousand times, hang a white dog upside down, strike it with a stick to draw blood, and mix with the *tingli* powder. Take one pill the size of a hemp seed, three doses to cure.

Another remedy: Steep three *sheng* of *langdang* (henbane) seeds in five *sheng* of wine, remove and dry, repeating until the wine is exhausted. Pound into powder and take one *qianbi* three times daily. Do not exceed the dose, as it may worsen mania.

Another formula from *Xiaopin*: The *Langdang* powder for manic-depressive illness. Take three *sheng* of *langdang* seeds, grind into powder, steep in one *sheng* of wine for several days, remove, pound, mix with the original liquid, strain, and simmer over hot water until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of small beans three times daily. The face and mouth will feel tight, and there may be a sensation of insects moving in the head, with redness appearing on the forehead, hands, and feet—these are signs of impending recovery. If not observed, continue until the formula is finished.

Another remedy: Grind *fangkui* (ledebouriella) and take one to two *daogui* with warm wine. Numbness and slight insensitivity of the body indicate efficacy.

Another remedy: Burn the rope of a person who died by hanging and take three pinches of the ash.

Generally, for manic illness: When an episode occurs, the patient falls to the ground, foams at the mouth, loses consciousness, and upon being forcibly lifted, behaves wildly, even soiling themselves. Such cases are difficult to treat.

For sudden mania: Burn a toad, pound into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* three times daily with wine.

Another remedy: Lay the patient on the ground and pour cold water on their face continuously for an entire day.

For sudden raving or ghostly speech: Insert a needle slightly under the toenail of the big toe to stop the symptoms.

Another remedy: Bind the patient’s two hands tightly together with a steamer’s belt, then apply moxibustion to both flanks. Grasp the elbow tips and cauterize both points simultaneously, seven cones each. After a short while, the demon will speak its name and beg to leave. Gently question it, then untie the hands.

Generally, when mania erupts, the patient may run wildly or claim exalted status, calling themselves divine or sacred. In all such cases, apply moxibustion extensively to achieve lasting recovery. If the patient instead weeps, moans, or sighs, this indicates demonic possession rather than mania, and should be treated according to methods for demonic afflictions.

*The Effective Remedies of Recent Times* states: Burn paper used in silkworm rearing to ash, and take with wine or water to cure wind-induced mania.

**Additional Remedies**
*From the *Doumen Prescriptions*:* To treat epilepsy, apply moxibustion to the perineum at the midpoint between the anus and scrotum, one cone per year of age.

*From the *Thousand Gold Prescriptions*:* For wind-induced epilepsy and all manner of illnesses, boil four *sheng* of hemp seeds in six *sheng* of water over high heat until the seeds split. Strain and reduce to seven *ge*, then take on an empty stomach at dawn. The patient may experience episodes, remain silent, or speak excessively—do not be alarmed. Simply massage their hands and feet until they calm. Three doses will bring recovery.

Another remedy: For sudden onset of manic possession—where the patient tears their hair, screams wildly, and attempts to harm others without regard for fire or water—form *ku shen* (sophora root) into pills the size of firmiana seeds with honey. Take ten pills per dose with mint decoction.

*From the *Arcane Essentials from the Imperial Library*:* For wind-induced epilepsy with pulling pain in the flanks, episodes of vomiting, and tinnitus like cicadas, remove the heart and peel of *tian men dong* (asparagus root), dry in the sun, grind to powder, and take one *fangcunbi* with wine. Prolonged use also promotes longevity.

*From the *Extensive Beneficial Prescriptions*:* For heat-induced wind epilepsy, thoroughly grind *lan long jiao* (decayed dragon’s horn) and take two *ge* of the thick juice before meals, twice daily.

*From the *Proven Later Prescriptions*:* For adults and children suffering long-term wind epilepsy, throat-constricting coughs, or full-body wind rashes with sudden drooling: This remedy induces minimal vomiting, only expelling saliva. For children, administer one *zi*. Grind *gua di* (melon stalk) to a fine powder without limit. Adults take one *zi*; those under fifteen or the elderly and weak take half. Administer in the morning with well-flower water, and have the patient hold a piece of rock sugar in their mouth. After a while, saliva will flow like water. In chronic cases, once all saliva is expelled, a piece resembling a saliva cloth will float on the water like a mirror. When the saliva is fully drained, consume congee for a day or two. If vomiting becomes excessive and the patient weakens, drink a cup of musk decoction to stop it. Finely chop musk and take with warm water.

Formerly, the Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices suffered from dizziness and took this remedy, expelling saliva with success.

*The Miscellaneous Records of Emperor Ming* states: During the Kaiyuan era, a renowned physician named Ji Peng could diagnose illness by observing a patient’s complexion and speech, without needing to take their pulse. The emperor, having heard of him, summoned him to the palace to examine a concubine who, every afternoon, would laugh, sing, weep, and scream as if mad, yet could not stand. Ji Peng observed her and said: “This must have resulted from overeating followed by sudden exertion, causing her to collapse.” He administered a cloud-mother decoction, had her sleep deeply, and upon waking, her suffering was gone. When asked, she recounted: “During the grand celebration for Princess Taihua’s birth, the palace hosted a grand musical performance. I was the lead singer and, fearing my voice would not be clear and sustained, ate a full bowl of pig’s trotter stew before performing. After singing a long piece, I felt intense heat in my chest. While playing on the terrace, I fell from a height. It was a long while before I regained consciousness, and since then, I have suffered from madness and been unable to stand.”

**Chapter Eighteen: Remedies for Sudden Fright, Demonic Possession, and Confusion**

For palpitations due to heart deficiency: Grind equal parts *ma huang* (ephedra) and *ban xia* (pinellia), form into honey pills, and take three pills the size of soybeans, twice daily, gradually increasing the dose. Wash *ban xia* to remove slipperiness and dry before use.

For distress caused by shock, sorrow, or terror—such as sudden loss of wealth, or pent-up frustration leading to mental disarray, erratic behavior, and restlessness: Combine two *liang* each of *long gu* (dragon bone), *yuan zhi* (polygala), *fu shen* (poria spirit), *fang feng* (saposhnikovia), and *mu li* (oyster shell); seven *liang* of *gan cao* (licorice); and seven *da zao* (jujubes).

Boil in one *dou* of water with the blood and liver of a black hen, reduce to three *sheng*, and divide into four doses—three during the day and one at night. During treatment, eat lightly and avoid rich foods. Three doses will bring recovery.

Another remedy: Prepare a white rooster as for eating, cut four *liang* of *zhen zhu* (pearl) and four *liang* of *xie bai* (Chinese garlic chives), and boil in three *sheng* of water until reduced to two *sheng*. Fast overnight, then consume the entire chicken and broth at dawn.

Other calming and mind-stabilizing pills are recorded in the major prescriptions.

For sudden demonic possession with confusion and chills: Apply moxibustion to the *ren zhong* point below the nose and at the base of the thumbnail on both big toes and thumbs, seven cones each. If symptoms persist, increase to fourteen cones.

This method originally appeared in the miscellaneous treatments.

For women who communicate with demonic entities, speaking or laughing alone, or experiencing sorrow and confusion: Grind one *liang* of *xiong huang* (realgar) and mix with two *liang* of melted pine resin. Stir with a tiger’s claw until the size of a bullet, then burn in a fire basket at night. Have the woman sit over it, covering herself tightly with a blanket, leaving only her head exposed. If not cured after one attempt, repeat up to three times, after which the demon will sever ties on its own.

Another remedy: Grind one *liang* each of *xiong huang*, *ren shen* (ginseng), and *fang feng* (saposhnikovia) with one *sheng* of *wu wei zi* (schisandra). Sift and take one *fangcunbi* with well water at dawn. Three doses will bring recovery.

The master would insert five needles into the topknot of the patient’s hair. For those with manic illness, a vessel of water was prepared, covered with three layers of new red cloth, and a large knife laid horizontally atop it. Assuming a solemn demeanor, the master would call the patient forth. The afflicted would invariably attempt to rise and flee, but the master would not permit it. Instead, he would take a mouthful of water and spray it upon the patient, then exhale sharply while gazing intently—repeating this three times until the patient was thoroughly drenched. Wiping away the water, he would flick the patient’s forehead near the hairline with his finger and ask, “Do you wish to be cured?” The patient would refuse to answer, so the master would repeat the flicking twice seven times before receiving a response. Then, using a staff-like needle, he would pierce the area beneath the nose, beside the philtrum near the nostrils, leaving the needle in place. He would next insert needles into the hollows before both ear roots, again leaving them in place. Finally, he would measure one *cun* upward from the bridge of the nose into the hairline and insert a needle horizontally, then pierce straight upward from the nose into the same point. Only after these procedures would he thoroughly question the patient. Once the patient awoke in clarity and remorse, the treatment would cease.

For men or women who frequently dream of intercourse with spirits, leading to confusion and disorientation: Saw deer antler into fine shavings and take three pinches with wine, three times daily.

For those who rage, attempt to stab or kill others, or contemplate suicide, ceaselessly cursing and speaking in ghostly tongues: Moxibustion at the red flesh at the corners of both lips, one cone each. Also moxa the creases of both elbows, five cones each, and the space between the shoulder blades, three cones. Repeat the moxibustion three times over three days. This is Cang Gong’s secret method. Additionally, moxibustion at the seam beneath the scrotum, thirty cones.

Other remedies for manic possession appear elsewhere.

For those who become manic: Take axle grease the size of a chicken egg, heat it in bitter wine, and stir until dissolved. Consume the entire mixture.

For heart vexation, confusion, abdominal fullness and pain, or intermittent loss of consciousness: Take five *sheng* of soot from beneath a cauldron, grind and sift, then mix with eight *sheng* of cold water. Strain and drink the entire liquid. If the patient’s jaw is locked, force it open and administer the liquid through a bamboo tube to ensure it is swallowed. The patient will recover immediately—this method is highly effective.

For opisthotonos with arched back, loss of limb control, and near-death from vexation: Mix five *sheng* of clear wine with one *sheng* of chicken droppings, grind and sift, then whisk a thousand times. Adults take one *sheng* three times daily; children take five *ge*. Recovery will follow.

For unbearable pain throughout the head and body, with disorientation and near-death from vexation: Take head filth the size of a large soybean and swallow it. Additionally, fill two pouches with steamed soybeans and alternate applying them as hot compresses to the painful areas. If soybeans are unavailable, steam mouse burrow soil and apply similarly.

For acute abdominal pain: Roast half a *jin* of salt until exhausted, place it in the mouth, then drink two *sheng* of hot water to induce vomiting. Recovery will follow.

For localized spasms, numbness, and loss of control: Roll a handful of dried mugwort leaves into a ball, place it beneath a clay steamer, and seal all but one opening. Position the painful area over the open hole and burn the mugwort beneath it until the skin blackens. Recovery will occur within an hour.

Another remedy: Shave rotten wood into shavings, boil in water until thick, and while scalding hot, steep the painful area—effective.

For clenched jaw that will not open: Take five *sheng* of soybeans, roast until yellow-black, steep in five *sheng* of wine, and extract the liquid. Force the mouth open with an implement and pour the liquid in, then induce sweating.

Another remedy: Four *liang* of *duhuo*, two *liang* of cinnamon, boiled in two *sheng* of wine and water to yield one and a half *sheng*. Divide into three doses, administer while the mouth is open, then have the patient lie warmly covered and apply moxibustion to induce sweating.

For facial distortion with deviated mouth: Apply moxibustion to the horizontal crease at the corner of the mouth. Remove the moxa as soon as heat is felt—do not burn completely, as excessive application will overcorrect. If the left side is distorted, moxa the right corner; if the right side is distorted, moxa the left.

Another method: Moxa a single cone on the upper joint of the middle finger—if the distortion is to the right, moxa the left finger. Additional moxibustion methods for deviated mouth follow later.

Another remedy: Take powdered *kongqing* and place it in the mouth—swallowing it will immediately restore normality. (Identical to Yao’s method.)

Another remedy: Rub spider eggs on the tense cheek near the jaw until the mouth returns to normal—stop when alignment is achieved. Alternatively, warm the eggs by the fire before rubbing.

Another remedy: Grind equal parts oyster shell, alum, aconite, and yellow earth from a stove, mix with the blood of a three-year-old rooster’s comb, and apply to the tense side. Hold water nearby; when the mouth begins to realign, promptly wash off the medicine. Do not reapply once corrected.

Another remedy: Apply a mixture of turtle shell and *wutou*—remove immediately when the mouth begins to realign.

**Additional Formulas for Head Wind and Headache**
From *Tested Formulas*: To treat acute wind strike with eyes closed, clenched jaw, and no way to administer medicine, use this powder.

From *Sun Shangyao’s Remedies*: To treat sudden wind strike with a drunken stupor, bodily heaviness, limbs unresponsive, or falling without falling, or a slanted mouth with slight drooling—if left untreated even briefly, it becomes a grave illness, thus harming the person.

Formula Twenty-One: For Wind-Toxin Leg Weakness with Fullness and Upward Qi
The disease of *jiaoqi* (leg qi) first arose in Lingnan and gradually spread to Jiangdong. It strikes without warning—sometimes with slight pain or numbness, sometimes with mild swelling in both shins, or sudden weakness upon standing, or numbness in the lower abdomen, or alternating chills and fever—all its signs. If not treated immediately, it ascends into the abdomen, then erupts as qi and kills.

To treat this, decoctions, wines, massages, and ointments are commonly used. As there are many effective remedies (#37), not just one formula, here I select only those of singular efficacy, supplemented with moxibustion.

Take one *sheng* of fine fermented soybeans, steam three times and sun-dry three times. Soak in three *dou* of good wine for three nights until drinkable, adjusting the quantity to the patient’s capacity. For prevention, administer without waiting for symptoms: boil the fermented soybeans in wine and take. When leg weakness shows slight improvement, further prepare other formulas and apply moxibustion.

Next, the *Du Huo* Wine formula: five *liang* each of *du huo* (pubescent angelica) and raw, sliced *fuzi* (aconite), steeped in one *dou* of wine for three nights. Begin with one *ge* per dose, increasing until mild numbness is felt.

Another formula: two *jin* of *bai fan shi* (alunite) or *zhongru* (stalactite powder), three *liang* of *fuzi*, and three *sheng* of fermented soybeans, steeped in three *dou* of wine for four to five days. Drink gradually. If qi stagnation is present, add two *sheng* of *suzi* (perilla seed).

Another formula: grind three *liang* of fine sulfur into powder. Boil five *sheng* of cow’s milk with five *sheng* of water, add the sulfur, and reduce to three *sheng*. Take three *ge* per dose. Alternatively, boil sulfur directly in milk without water. If cow’s milk is unavailable, sheep’s milk may be used.

Another method: reduce three *sheng* of cow’s milk by half, then take five *ge* with one *liang* of sulfur powder. After ingestion, cover thickly to induce sweating, avoiding drafts. Take another dose midday and one at dusk. If sweating occurs, do not repeat; simply rest and recover. If unresolved, repeat after several days. For long-term use, it may be decocted into pills.

Northerners find this sulfur remedy highly effective for leg disorders, provided the sulfur is of the finest quality. It should be prepared in advance.

If the shins are swollen such that pressing leaves an imprint, force the patient to drink two to three *sheng* of black calf’s urine to promote urination and gradually reduce swelling. Use a copper vessel, and fresh urine is best. If no black calf is available, a pure yellow one may suffice.

Another formula: grind *qianniuzi* (morning glory seeds), mix with honey into pills the size of small beans, and take five pills to promote urination. They may also be swallowed whole. The seeds are black, resembling *qiouzi* kernels, and are sold in markets.

Another formula: crush *sanbai* root and take with wine.

Another: boil black soybeans in water or wine and drink the broth.

Another: eating small red beans is also beneficial.

Another: grind raw *huma* (sesame), mix with wine, and take to cure the condition.

Another: boil three *sheng* of black soybeans in one *dou* of water to nine *sheng*, add nine *sheng* of clear wine, and reduce again to nine *sheng*. Drink gradually; urination will relieve the swelling.

Formulas such as *Feng Yin*, *Bai Ji*, *Zhu Li*, and *Du Huo* decoctions, as well as *Ba Feng*, *Shi Hu*, and *Gou Ji* powders, are detailed in comprehensive medical texts.

*Jin Ya* Wine is most essential for treatment; its formula is recorded here: four *liang* each of *shujiao* (Sichuan pepper), *yinyu* (skimmia), *jin ya* (golden teeth), *xixin* (asarum), *wang cao* (lithospermum), *gan dihuang* (dried rehmannia), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *fuzi* (aconite), *difu* (kochia), *shuodi* (glossy privet), and *shengma* (cimicifuga); three *liang* of *renshen* (ginseng); one *jin* of *qianghuo* (notopterygium); and five *liang* of *niuxi* (achyranthes). Cut the fourteen ingredients, steep in four *dou* of wine for seven days, and drink two to three *ge* per dose, gradually increasing. It also treats speechlessness and bent legs with excellent results. *Cezi* Wine is also effective.

For rural or impoverished households, these remedies may be brewed: *baqia* (smilax), pine nodes, and pine needles are all beneficial. Wash and chop one *hu* of *baqia*, boil in three *hu* of water to nine *dou*, strain, and use the liquid to soak yeast and cook rice, brewing as one would wine. When ready, drink freely, preparing three to five *hu* at once. If using pine nodes or needles, follow the same method; the liquid should be as concentrated as possible.

For those with bent legs, unable to walk for years, or suffering from lumbar and spinal contracture and abdominal tightness, three to five doses will restore health.

If brewing is impractical, *shanglu* (pokeweed) by the water’s edge is also effective.

Moxibustion points are numerous, but as not all may be known, I record only the essentials. Begin from the upper body; moxibustion on the legs alone risks trapping qi and causing danger.

First, moxa *Dazhui*: the prominent vertebra at the nape. Apply moxa to the point above it. If qi stagnation is present, first moxa *Baihui* with fifty cones—this point lies in the depression atop the head.

Next, moxa *Jianjing* on both shoulders with one hundred cones each. The point lies in the depression near the head on the shoulders; press with fingers to locate the center.

Next, moxa *Danzhong* with fifty cones. This point lies between the breasts, at the junction of the sternum and ribs, where pressing elicits a subtle qi sensation. Some say it is the single point at the center of the chest.

Next, moxa *Juque*, located one *cun* below the tip of the xiphoid process, measured by the patient’s finger-width. Moxibustion at these five upper points suffices to treat qi stagnation. Moxibustion at *Baihui*, *Fengfu* (#40), *Weiguan*, and the five *zang* transport points is even better, depending on the urgency of the condition. All points are recorded in moxibustion manuals and cannot be fully listed here.

Next, moxa *Fengshi* with one hundred cones. This point lies on the outer thigh; stand upright, let the hands hang naturally, and press the thigh where the middle finger rests—this is the point, where pressing feels appropriate.

Next, moxa *Zusanli* with two hundred cones. Have the patient place their hand horizontally below the knee, fingers together (a measure called *yifu*). The point lies one *yifu* below the kneecap, at the outer edge of the shinbone, where pressing reveals a depression.

Next, moxa *Shang Lian* with one hundred cones, located one *yifu* below *Zusanli*.

Next, moxa *Xialian* with one hundred cones, located one *yifu* below *Shang Lian*.

Next, moxa *Juegu* with two hundred cones. This point lies slightly more than three *cun* above the outer ankle; align the fingertip with the upper edge of the ankle bone, then bend the finger to measure four *cun*—this is the point. It roughly aligns with *Xialian*, forming two distinct points in the interstice. These eighteen points below are all essential points. For the remaining points—*Futu* and *Dubi*—when applying the prescribed number of cones, it is not necessary to complete them all at once; rather, spread the treatment over three days to fulfill the total.

**Alternative Formula:**
Steep two *jin* of *Konggongnie* and five *liang* of *shihu* in two *dou* of wine, then consume.

**Appended Formulas:**

*From the* **Doumen Fang***:*
To treat sudden wind-toxin, swelling, tightness, and acute pain: Take one *jin* of willow bark, chop it, and boil it in wine until hot. Wrap it in silk and apply it to the swollen area. When it cools, reheat and replace it. This method is highly effective.

*From the* **Shenghui Fang***:*
To treat migratory wind-toxin pain: Grind small mustard seeds into powder, mix with egg white, and apply as a poultice.

*From the* **Jingyan Hou Fang***:*
To treat wind-toxin bone-marrow pain: Grind two *fen* of *shaoyao* and one *liang* of roasted *hugu* into powder, place in a silk pouch, and steep in three *sheng* of wine for five days. Take two *ge* per dose, three times daily.

*From the* **Shiyi Xinjing***:*
To dispel all wind-damp impediment and tetany of the limbs: Grind three *liang* of *cangerzi* into powder, decoct in one and a half *sheng* of water until seven *ge* remain, strain, and sip.

Also, to treat muscle spasms, chronic wind-damp impediment, downbearing *qi*, expelling pathogenic *qi* from the bones, harmonizing the intestines and stomach, dispersing water swelling, and—with prolonged use—lightening the body and augmenting *qi* and strength: Take one *sheng* of *yiyiren*, grind into powder, and for each dose, boil two *sheng* of water with two spoonfuls of the powder to make a congee. Consume on an empty stomach.

Also, to supplement deficiency, dispel wind-damp impediment: Warm one cup of wine, mix in two large *liang* of *tihu*, and take one spoonful of the mixture.

*From the* **Jingyan Fang***:*
To treat pain beneath the skin anywhere on the body: Grind *heshouwu* into powder, mix with ginger juice to form a paste, apply to the painful area, and wrap with silk. Then, heat the sole of a shoe over fire and press it against the area. This method is highly effective.

*From Sun Zhenren’s Formula:*
To treat *jiaoqi* and counterflow *qi*: Prepare *kuai* from one large red crucian carp and consume one or two portions at once for relief.

*From the* **Qianjin Yi***:*
To treat *jiaoqi* surging upward to the heart: Boil two *liang* of alum in one *dou* and five *sheng* of water for three to five boilings, then soak and wash the feet. This is highly effective.

*From the* **Guangli Fang***:*
To treat *jiaoqi* causing vexation, agitation, and loss of consciousness: Boil one *sheng* of soybeans in three *sheng* of water to make a thick decoction, then consume half a *sheng* at once. If symptoms persist, take another half *sheng* to stabilize the condition.

Su Gong states: For those suffering from *jiaoqi*, eat to satiety in the morning as desired, eat lightly after noon, and fast in the evening. If hungry, consume fermented soybean congee. If digestion is poor and symptoms resemble impending cholera:
Take two *liang* of *gaoliangjiang*, crush it, and boil in three *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains. Consume it all at once to resolve the condition. Wait until extremely hungry, then eat a full portion of thin congee. This remedy is most effective when taken in large quantities. If *gaoliangjiang* is unavailable, substitute one *liang* of ginger, boil it thoroughly in one *sheng* of clear wine, and consume it with the dregs. Though not as effective as *gaoliangjiang*, it still yields significant results.

The *Tang Bencao* notes: For *jiaoqi*, soak the affected area in a thick decoction of *hongcao* for prolonged relief.

*From the* **Jianyao Jizhong***:*
To treat *jiaoqi* with persistent leg swelling: Take one *liang* of black *fuzi*, remove the skin and navel, grind into powder, and mix with fresh ginger juice to form a paste. Apply to the swollen area, and when the paste dries, reapply with fresh mixture until the swelling subsides.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: Formulas for Acute Onset of *Fu San* Toxicity**

When consuming Five Minerals *Huming Gengsheng* or *Zhongru* Cold-Food Powder, improper regulation or dosage may provoke acute onset of illness, manifesting in myriad ways. If symptoms arise suddenly rather than gradually, they are due to the potency of the powder. Immediate intervention is required. For all external pains or abnormalities in the limbs or body, wash the affected area with cold water hundreds of times. If heat surges, soak a cloth in water and apply it as a compress. Alternatively, soak a cold stone in water and use it to press the area. Drink warm wine and walk leisurely.

For all internal pains or abnormalities in the heart and abdomen—such as vexation, oppression, or confusion—act swiftly. If cold, drink warm wine in one or two *sheng* increments, gradually increasing the amount. If slight relief is felt, consume more cold food. Heart pain is most urgent; if the flesh is cold and the mouth is clenched, force open the teeth and administer hot wine for relief.

For abdominal masses, heat accumulations, or other complex conditions, purge immediately. Boil fourteen *zhizi* and five *ge* of *chi* in two *sheng* of water until one *sheng* remains, then consume it all at once. If heat is severe and sores have erupted, add two *liang* of *huangqin*. If accumulations persist and appetite is poor with aversion to cold, purge again. Prepare the following powder: half a *sheng* of fine *dahuang* powder, half a *sheng* of *mangxiao*, two *liang* of *gancao*, and one *fen* each of *banxia*, *huangqin*, and *yuanhua*. Grind into powder and store in an airtight container. To administer, boil twenty *dazao* in eight *sheng* of water until soft, then strain to obtain four *sheng* of liquid. Add five *fangcunbi* of the powder, stir well, and heat the mixture three times (raising and lowering it over the fire). Divide into three doses and consume one in the morning. If bowel movements occur, the remaining doses may be omitted. If relief is not felt, take another dose.

After purging, prepare wine congee and consume two *sheng*, followed by watery gruel. Do not delay eating, as an empty stomach may allow heat to enter, which can be fatal.

After purging, always keep the following emergency formula on hand: one *ge* each of *dahuang* and *tingli*, thirty *xingren* and *badou*, ground and mixed with honey into pills the size of *hudou*. Take two pills daily.

Those who experience diarrhea should reduce the dosage; those with abdominal fullness should increase it. There are many formulas for decoctions, powders, pills, and medicinal wines, but the key lies in maintaining coolness and allowing frequent bowel movements—only seeking free flow. The limbs should be kept in regular motion, and one must not miss meals or become hungry, nor consume spoiled rice, rotten fish, or meat. Additionally, one should avoid hot foods and drinks, heavy clothing, approaching fire, braving summer heat on long journeys, or excessive exposure to wind and cold.

Generally, the body should be in a robust state to tolerate these methods well. If illness has already manifested, one must forcibly endure the treatment. The medicines taken should primarily be those that resolve toxins and are cooling in nature.

When taking powders, if the illness seems to have subsided, discontinue use. After twenty or thirty days, resume as needed. If stagnation remains unresolved, leading to vexing heat, it is due to improper dosage—one should then follow the prescribed methods for prevention and treatment.

This method is most often employed by the wealthy and carefree, while those who are poor and toil rarely experience adverse reactions, as their bodies are accustomed to cold and labor. However, in cases of critical danger, these few principles are briefly recorded here for urgent reference. The rest are detailed in the major formulas.

**Additional Formulas**

**From *The Sagely Benefit Formulas*:**
For treating the activation of alchemical minerals (rushi) causing congestion, heat, heart vexation, and blood vomiting: Pound fresh *cirsium* (thistle) to extract its juice, take three *ge* per dose, add a small amount of honey, stir well, and consume.

*The Dietary Therapy* states: If heat from cinnabar or minerals erupts, cook *zizania* (wild rice) roots with crucian carp into a thick soup and eat it—after two or three servings, recovery will follow.

**For sudden reversal of qi with upward surging, pain and fullness in both flanks, and near-collapse:**
Heat water until scalding, then soak both feet and hands, changing the water frequently. This is called *bentun* (rushing piglet) disease, arising from sudden fright, terror, or sorrow. The qi surges downward, then violently strikes the heart, chest, and navel, causing a pounding sensation. If left untreated, it can be fatal. Most formulas require many ingredients and even the killing of a piglet, but this single decoction suffices.

Two *liang* each of licorice and ginseng, two *liang* of cinnamon bark, one *sheng* of *zanthoxylum*, one *jin* of fresh ginger, and one *sheng* of *pinellia*—boil in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*, divided into three doses.

**For severe exertion from running or rushing, leading to panting and fatigue, followed by drinking cold water, which triggers upward qi and fever:**
Use three *jin* of bamboo leaves and three *liang* of tangerine peel, boiled in one *dou* of water to yield three *sheng*. Strain and divide into three doses; one dose every three days is effective.

**For extreme heat exhaustion or eating hot cakes followed by excessive cold water, which fails to disperse in the throat and instead generates qi, causing wheezing and panting:**
Equal parts rhubarb, dried ginger, and croton seeds—grind into powder and take half a *qian* spoonful. If vomiting or diarrhea occurs, recovery will follow. If stagnation persists in the heart, chest, or diaphragm, causing discomfort:

Two parts *melon pedicel*, three parts *asarum*, and one part ginseng—pound, sift, and take one *qian* spoonful with hot water, two or three times daily, until effective.

**For lung atrophy with coughing, spitting of frothy saliva, a warm sensation in the heart, vexation, and thirstlessness:**

**Qie Zhong Fang’s Cough-Soothing Lozenge:**
Take one *liang* of *ting li* seeds from Caozhou, roast on paper until black. Add one *liang* each of *zhi mu* (*Anemarrhena*) and *bei mu* (*Fritillaria*). Grind together, then mix with half a *liang* of jujube pulp and one and a half *liang* of melted rock sugar. Form into pills the size of bullets. For each dose, wrap one pill in fresh silk and hold in the mouth, slowly swallowing the saliva. Severe cases require no more than three pills. *Modern physicians also frequently use this formula.*

**Cui Zhiti’s Fumigation Method for Chronic Cough:**
Each morning, take a portion of *kuan dong hua* (*Tussilago*) the size of a chicken egg, mix with a little honey to moisten, and place in a one-*sheng* iron pot. Use a clay bowl with a drilled hole, inserting a small bamboo tube (a brush handle will suffice). The tube should be slightly long, and the bowl and pot should fit snugly. Seal the joint with mud to prevent air leaks. Place charcoal beneath the pot. After a short time, smoke from the *kuan dong hua* will emerge from the tube. Hold the tube in the mouth and inhale the smoke, swallowing it. If chest discomfort arises, lift the head and pinch the tube to prevent smoke leakage. Inhale until the smoke is exhausted. Perform this once every five days. On the sixth day, eat a full meal of mutton noodles, and the condition will resolve permanently.

**Sheng Jin Fang’s Golden Millet Pill for Chronic, Sudden, or Consumptive Cough:**
Grind one *liang* of *ci huang* (*orpiment*) finely. Use paper-mud to seal a small box, ensuring the mud is not too thick, and let dry. Place the powdered *ci huang* inside, seal the box with water-mixed *chi shi zhi* (*halloysite*), and apply an additional layer of mud. Once dry, place the box on the ground and surround it with charcoal the size of *tanzi* bullets to form a mound. Ignite the charcoal from above, using a flatiron to cover the top, and let the fire gradually intensify. When one-third of the charcoal has burned, check if the *tanzi* pieces are uniformly red. If so, remove the fire and let cool. Open the box to retrieve the medicine, which should resemble a mirror’s surface—bright and red. Grind finely in a mortar, then mix with a water-soaked *bing* cake center to form pills the size of millet grains. Take three to five pills with licorice water, then rest for a while. *Excellent.*

**Cui Yuanliang’s *Remedies from the Sea*:**

A singularly effective formula for coughs: Take a fine pear, remove its core, and pound to extract one teacup of juice. Add forty Sichuan peppercorns, bring to a single boil, then strain. Immediately add one large *liang* of black maltose, dissolve completely, and slowly hold in the mouth to swallow. It will take effect at once.

Meng Shen states: For sudden coughing, take one pear and pierce fifty holes in it. Insert one Sichuan peppercorn into each hole, wrap in dough, and roast in hot ashes until done. Allow to cool, remove the peppercorns, and eat the pear.

Another formula: Remove the core of a pear, fill with *su* (ghee) and honey, wrap in dough, and roast until done. Eat.

Another formula: Stew pear flesh in *su* until tender, allow to cool, and eat.

Another formula: Pound one *sheng* of pear juice, one *liang* of *su*, one *liang* of honey, and one *sheng* of rehmannia juice. Simmer over a gentle fire and slowly hold in the mouth to swallow.

For all cough treatments, wait until the breathing has settled before eating, as consuming while hot will cause harm. Those with cold-induced coughs are beyond remedy. In such cases, prepare a mutton broth with noodles, eat to satiety, then lie down briefly.

**From the *Qianjin Fang*:**
To treat coughing with counterflow *qi* in children and adults: Take three *sheng* of apricot kernels, remove skins and tips, and stir-fry until yellow. Pound into a paste, add one *sheng* of honey, and divide into three portions. Mix one portion with the apricot kernels, pound to the proper consistency, then add the next portion, and pound again until smooth. Finally, add the last portion and pound thoroughly. Take before meals, holding in the mouth to swallow the juice.

**From *Yang’s Obstetrics and Pediatrics*:**
A formula for urgent fullness in the chest, making it difficult to sit or lie down: Take one large *liang* of turtle shell, roast until yellow, and grind finely into powder. Steep one handful of *dengxin* (rush pith) in two *sheng* of water, decoct to five *ge*, and take one *qianbi* before meals. After meals, take one *qianbi* with honey water.

**From Liu Yuxi’s *Transmitted Reliable Formulas*:**
Li Ya’s remedy for all coughs and counterflow *qi*: Use dried ginger—only the finest from Taizhou—along with *zaojia* (Chinese honey locust), roasted and peeled, selecting plump, unperforated pods. Also use *guixin* (cassia bark), choosing the purple, pungent variety, peeled. Pound each ingredient separately, sift, then weigh equal parts (quantity as desired). Combine, pound and sift again, then blend with refined white honey. Pound twenty to thirty times. Take three pills per dose, slightly larger than *wutong* seeds. Take whenever coughing occurs, three to five times daily, without regard to meals. Avoid onions, oil, salt, fish, and hot wheat noodles. The effect is divine.

Liu was in Huainan on the same staff as Li. Li often dispensed medicine without revealing the formula. When criticized for stinginess, Li explained: “Most people with coughs take cold medicines. If they saw this formula’s hot, drying ingredients, they would refuse to take it. That is why I only provide the medicine, and it proves effective.” Trials confirmed its reliability.

**From *Concise and Effective Remedies for the Multitudes*:**
To treat lung *qi* panting and coughing: Take two *liang* of *madouling* (birthwort fruit), using only the inner seeds and discarding the husk. Add half a *liang* of *su*, mix well in a bowl, and stir-fry over a slow fire until dry. Add one *liang* of roasted licorice, grind both into powder, and take one *qian* per dose. Decoct in one cup of water to six *fen*, and sip warm. Alternatively, hold the powder in the mouth and swallow the saliva.

For phlegm-induced coughing with urgent panting: Take one and a half *liang* of *jiegeng* (platycodon root), grind into powder, and decoct in half a *sheng* of boys’ urine to four *ge*. Strain and take warm.

Yang Wenwei’s formula for phlegm-induced coughing and chest congestion: Select a large, plump *guālóu* (trichosanthes fruit), cut open, clean the seeds, crush, and scrape the peel. Slice finely and dry by baking. Take forty-nine *banxia* (pinellia rhizomes), wash ten times in hot water, crush, and dry by baking. Grind into powder, then simmer with the *guālóu* pulp and water used to wash it until it forms a paste. Grind finely into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take twenty pills with ginger decoction.

**From the *Master Shen’s Formulas*:**
For chronic cough with counterflow *qi*, bodily swelling, shortness of breath, fullness, inability to lie flat, and constant frog-like croaking: *Baiqian* decoction governs this. Take two *liang* of *baiqian* (willowleaf swallowwort rhizome), three *liang* each of *ziwan* (tatarian aster root) and washed *banxia*, and seven *ge* of *daji* (euphorbia root). Slice, steep in one *dou* of water overnight, then decoct the next day to three *sheng*. Divide into three doses. Avoid mutton and maltose for best results.

**From *Master Mei’s Formulas*:**
For chronic *xiā* coughing with wheezing and sleeplessness: Grind *baiqian* into powder and take two *qianbi* with warm wine.

Another formula for counterflow *qi* coughing with wheezing, gasping, and sticky phlegm: Soak indigo leaves in water for a long time, pound, and extract one *sheng* of juice. Take on an empty stomach in one dose. Shortly after, grind apricot kernels to extract juice and cook porridge to eat. Rest for one or two days, then repeat the treatment until phlegm is fully expelled.

**From the *Military Ministry’s Handbook*:**
For coughing with counterflow *qi*, shortness of breath, and chest rattling in children and adults, with coughing up of foul, purulent phlegm: Take one *ge* of *danzhuli* (bamboo sap) three to five times daily. Adults may take one *sheng*.

**From the *Sagely Benefit Formulas*:**
To treat sinew and vessel damage with urgent counterflow *qi* and coughing: Take twenty jujubes, remove pits, and simmer in four *liang* of *su* over a low fire until the *su* is fully absorbed. Hold one jujube in the mouth at a time and swallow slowly.

**From the *Tested Later Formulas*:**
To suppress panting and dissolve phlegm: Take forty-nine pig trotter nails, wash and dry thoroughly. Place half a *zi* each of *banxia* and alum into each nail, seal in a jar to prevent smoke from escaping, and calcine until red-hot. Remove from fire, grind finely, and add one *qianbi* of musk. For those with upper panting and coughing, take with glutinous rice water. Children take half a *qian*. Most effective.

**From the *Divine Garden Formulas*:**
To treat coughing with urgent counterflow *qi*, panting, coughing of blood, and spitting of blood: Take high-quality ginseng, pound into powder, and administer three *qianbi* per dose, mixed with egg white. Take at the fifth watch, then lie down without a pillow, supine. A single dose often suffices; for chronic cases, take again. Avoid raw, salty, pickled, or fermented foods, soy sauce, wheat-based dishes, and overindulgence in food or drink. Convalesce well.

Xi Yan once treated deficiency with internal heat, coughing of pus and blood, and dry mouth and throat, where cold-natured medicines could not be taken.

**Section Fourteen: Formulas for Sudden Generalized Swelling and Fullness**

**For sudden swelling and fullness, with the entire body and face grossly enlarged:**
Take one large carp and three *sheng* of undiluted wine, simmer until the wine is fully absorbed, then consume the fish. Do not add vinegar, salt, fermented beans, or other ingredients. No more than two or three doses are needed for recovery.

Another formula: Moxibust three cones on the white flesh below the inner ankle. Effective.

Another formula: Take one *dou* of soybeans, cook thoroughly, strain, and drink the broth while eating the beans. A few doses will suffice; red beans are especially effective.

Another formula: Mix egg yolk and white, apply to swollen areas, and reapply as it dries.

Another formula: Chop apricot leaves, decoct until concentrated, and soak the affected area while hot. May also be taken internally.

Another formula: Take ten kernels from within plum pits, grind thoroughly, and mix with three *ge* of polished rice. Decoct in four *sheng* of water to make congee, reducing to two *sheng*, and consume. For subsequent doses, increase the number of kernels.

Another formula: Take one *sheng* of soybeans, decoct in five *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, discard the beans, add eight *sheng* of wine, and further decoct to nine *sheng*. Divide into three or four doses. After swelling subsides, avoid excessive drinking if thirsty.

Another formula: Take three *sheng* of ox urine in one dose; swelling will lessen. If unresolved, take again.

Another formula: Take one *jin* of *zhanglu* root, peel and slice thinly, decoct until soft, discard the dregs, and add one *jin* of mutton, scallions, fermented beans, and salt, prepared as a meal. Consume freely. After swelling subsides, this may still be taken regularly. Alternatively, pound *zhanglu* and mix half with rice to steam into cakes for consumption.

Another formula: Take one pig kidney, divide into seven pieces, dust with one *fen* of *gansui* powder, and roast until cooked. Consume one piece daily for four to five days until bowel sounds and increased urination are noted. If not, continue until finished. Remove the skin before eating, and consume entirely for best results. Do not eat salt. If incomplete, repeat the course.

Another formula: Slice two *sheng* of *zhanglu*, steep in three *sheng* of wine for three nights, and take five *ge* to one *sheng* three times daily. This formula treats all types of fullness, whether from deficiency *qi*, wind-cold *qi*, or water-damp *qi*.

**For swelling that enters the abdomen, causing severe fullness and distress, impairing food intake:**
Take two *liang* each of *daji* and *wuzhi* powder, grind, mix with honey, and form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take two pills at dawn; as swelling gradually recedes, continue until resolved, then cease.

Another formula: Take ten *liang* of *tingli* seeds, three *liang* of *jiaomu*, three *liang* of *fuling*, and two *liang* of *wuzhuyu*, grind, mix with honey, and form pills the size of *tong* seeds. Take ten pills three times daily.

Another formula: Take one carp weighing five *jin*, decoct in two *dou* of water until one and a half *dou* remain, discard the fish, and add five *liang* of *zejie*, three *liang* of *fuling*, and three *sheng* of sliced mulberry root bark. Further decoct to four *sheng*, and divide into four doses. Urination will increase, and swelling will gradually subside.

Another formula: Peel and roast *zaojia* until yellow, chop three *sheng*, steep in one *dou* of wine, and decoct in a stone vessel until boiling. Take one *sheng* three times daily, preparing a new batch when finished.

If swelling is localized to a specific area, mix ash with water and apply. Reapply as it dries.

Another formula: Grind red beans and hemp seeds together, and apply to swollen areas.

Another formula: Boil *badou* in water, then dip a cloth in the liquid to wipe the affected area. Yao states: Take thirty *badou* seeds, crush with their husks, decoct in five *sheng* of water until two *sheng* remain, and wipe the swollen area five times daily. The swelling will diminish upon application. Avoid contact with the eyes and genitals. This treats sudden swelling of the body resembling bloating.

For general swelling: Chop scallions, boil until soft, and soak the affected area two to four times daily.

Another formula: Steep one *sheng* of *tusizi* in five *sheng* of wine for two or three nights, then take one *sheng* three times daily until cured.

If swelling begins in the feet and gradually ascends, entering the abdomen proves fatal. The following formula treats this: Boil one *hu* of small beans until thoroughly soft, yielding four to five *dou* of liquid. Soak the area below the knees in the warm decoction twice daily until the swelling fully subsides. If the swelling has already entered the abdomen, do not soak; instead, consume only the boiled small beans, avoiding rice, fish, and salt. Drink the small bean decoction exclusively. In the absence of small beans, soybeans may be substituted. This condition is critical, with only one in ten surviving—treatment must be administered urgently.

Another formula: Shave paulownia or tung wood, boil to extract the juice, and soak the affected area while drinking a small amount. Adding small beans enhances efficacy.

Another formula: Finely chop one fresh pig’s liver and consume it at once. Do not consume with salt. Vinegar may be used for improved results.

Another formula: Drink boiled *chi* decoction and apply the dregs to the feet.

**Additional Formulas:**
From *Beiji Fang* (Emergency Remedies): For sudden full-body swelling, pound elm bark into flakes, mix with rice to make porridge, and consume to promote urination.

From *Yangshi Chanru* (Yang’s Obstetrics and Pediatrics): For generalized swelling with inhibited urination, grind five *liang* of *zhuling* into powder, decoct in three *ge* of water, and take one *fangcunbi* dose, increasing to two if needed.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: Remedies for Sudden Onset of Massive Abdominal Water Disease**

At the onset of water disease, swelling first appears above the eyes like the back of an old silkworm moth, with discoloration flanking the head’s vessels. The inner thighs grow cold, the shins become full, and pressing leaves an indentation. When turning the abdomen, a sound of shifting nodes is heard—these are its signs.

If left untreated, the body gradually swells, and the abdomen becomes fully distended. Pressing causes the flesh to rebound—by this stage, the disease has taken hold, though it may still be treated. Such conditions often arise from depletion following major illness, after diarrhea, in women post-childbirth, or when water intake is not promptly dispersed. The Triple Burner is afflicted, urination obstructed, and gradual accumulation binds together, eventually flowing into the channels and network vessels.

**Remedies:**

1. Take one *sheng* of *tingli* (tingli seeds), stir-fry, and pound in a mortar. Slit open a live male mandarin duck, mix its blood and head with the *tingli*, and pound ten thousand times. Form into pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, starting with five and gradually increasing to ten. Avoid salt. Regularly consume rice with adzuki beans and drink adzuki bean broth; snakehead fish is also beneficial.

2. Another formula: One *liang* each of *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *gancao* (licorice), and *tingli* (tingli seeds). Pound and mix with bitter wine to form pills the size of parasol-tree seeds. Take three pills, three times daily. Continue until the swelling subsides.

3. Another formula: Six *fen* of *xionghuang* (realgar), three *fen* of *shexiang* (musk), and two *fen* each of *gansui* (kan-sui), *yuanhua* (genkwa), and *renshen* (ginseng). Pound and mix with honey to form pills the size of soybeans. Take two pills, increasing to four. Recovery will follow.

Another formula: Soak two *sheng* of *tingli* seeds in five *sheng* of spring wine overnight. Take one *ge* at a time; urination will become unobstructed.

Another formula: One *liang* of *tingli* and twenty apricot kernels, stir-fried until yellow. Pound and divide into ten doses. Once urination is restored, recovery will follow immediately.

Another formula: *Hu Qia’s* "Mercury Pills," highly effective for water swelling and promoting urination. As attested by Yao.

One *sheng* each of *tingli* and *jiaomu*, six *liang* of *mangxiao*, and ten *liang* of mercury. Boil the mercury in water for three days and nights, then combine and pound sixty thousand times. Form into pills the size of soybeans. Take three daily, increasing by one pill each day up to ten, then restart from one. After recovery, consume beef and mutton to restore strength, and drink in moderation.

Another formula: Gather and finely chop a large quantity of *ke* tree bark. Boil into a thick decoction and reduce until it can be formed into pills. Take three pills the size of parasol-tree seeds, then another after a short while. Water will be expelled. Later, take three pills three times daily. This tree is also called *munu* and is used by southerners to build boats.

Another formula: Equal parts genuine *suhexiang* (storax), mercury, and white lead, mixed with honey into pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans three times daily. Water will be expelled; regulate diet and rest well. If *suhexiang* is unavailable, omit it.

Another formula: Take twenty ripe castor beans, remove the skins, and grind. Mix with water to make three *ge* of liquid. Take once daily. Around midday, vomiting and diarrhea will expel accumulated water and fluids. If incomplete, take thirty beans three days later. If still incomplete, repeat the process. After recovery, regulate intake of fluids and salty foods.

Another formula: One *sheng* of adzuki beans and one white chicken, prepared as for eating. Boil in three *dou* of water until fully cooked. Consume the solids and drink the broth, gradually finishing all.

Another formula: Take a green-headed male duck and boil in five *sheng* of water until one *sheng* of broth remains. Drink gradually until finished. Cover thickly to induce sweating; this is beneficial.

Another formula: Swallow ten egg yolks from swallows’ eggs at once.

Another formula: Roast mole crickets until fully cooked and eat ten daily.

Another formula: For cases where only the abdomen is swollen, with fluid movement and gurgling sounds, and the skin turns black—this is called *water gu*. Take ninety *badou* (croton seeds), remove skins and hearts, and sixty apricot kernels, remove skins and tips. Stir-fry until yellow, pound together, and form into pills the size of small beans. Take one pill with water as needed. Wine may also be consumed; this is beneficial.

Another formula: Finely pound *guishan* (Chinese lobelia) and extract its juice. Drink an amount the size of a chicken egg to expel water, then treat the *water gu* again. Alternatively, grind hemp seeds into juice and drink.

Another formula: Boil thirty *jin* of *cimicao* (motherwort) and three *dan* of its seeds to obtain one *dan* of liquid. Strain and further reduce over heat until it can be formed into pills. Take three to five or six pills the size of *zaojia* seeds. Water will be expelled through urination; then consume thin rice porridge for nourishment.

Another formula: One large handful of white cogon grass roots and three *sheng* of adzuki beans. Boil in three *sheng* of water until dry, remove the grass roots, and eat the beans. Water will be expelled through urination.

Another formula: Ten *jin* each of *shuweicao* (common club moss) and *mabiancao* (European verbena). Boil in one *dan* of water to obtain five *dou* of liquid. Strain, further reduce, and mix with starch to form pills. Take two pills the size of soybeans, increasing to four or five. Avoid fatty meats and cold, raw foods.

For swelling and fullness: One handful of white mulberry tree bark, boiled in two *sheng* of water to obtain five *ge*. Grind two large white areca nuts into powder, add to the decoction, and boil for three to five more bubbles. Once done, add a small amount of *hongxue* (red snow) and consume. Also, under the section on swelling and fullness, formulas include drinking cow urine, *zhanglu* (pokeweed), mutton stew, and fragrant soft candies. The major formulas for the ten types of water swelling are recorded in a separate volume.

If water is only in the skin and not yet in the abdomen, take diaphoretic medicines to induce sweating for recovery. However, guard carefully against wind and cold. If only the abdomen is swollen and purgatives are ineffective, needle two *cun* below the navel, inserting several *fen* to drain the water. Stop when the puncture closes and the abdomen reduces.

**Attached Formulas**

From Li Jiang’s *Bingbu Shouji Fang*: A remedy for water disease, regardless of duration or severity, even with adverse pulses. One large *liang* each of *daji* (euphorbia), *danggui* (Chinese angelica), and *jupi* (tangerine peel). Chop and boil in one large *sheng* of water to obtain seven *ge*. Consume at once; two to three *dou* of water will be expelled. Do not be alarmed by the severity; recovery will follow after no more than two doses. Avoid toxic foods for one year.

From *Waitai Miyao*: For water qi. Peel and chop white *zhanglu* (pokeweed) roots into pieces the size of small beans, one large cupful. Boil in three *sheng* of water to obtain one *sheng*. Once thoroughly cooked, add one large cup of millet and cook into porridge. Consume on an empty stomach. If taken twice daily, excessive purging may occur; once daily ensures mild purgation. Avoid mixed foods.

Another remedy for water disease with swelling: Take one very large carp, remove the head, tail, and bones, retaining only the flesh. Boil with two *dou* of water and one large *sheng* of adzuki beans. Reduce to two *sheng* of liquid, strain through cloth, and consume at once. If unable to finish, divide into two doses, warming the second. After consumption, diarrhea will follow; recovery occurs once purging ceases.

Another formula: For sudden swelling and fullness. There was a case of sudden foot and leg swelling, gradually ascending to the knees, making walking impossible. Eventually, the head and face swelled, and the entire body became bloated and distended. Take the white pulp of a bitter gourd, shape into pieces the size of soybeans, wrap in dough, and boil briefly. Consume seven on an empty stomach. By midday, a *dou* of water will be expelled. For three days, water will continue to drain, leading to significant emaciation and recovery. Maintain dietary caution for three years.

The bitter gourd must be of fine quality—smooth, unblemished, with fine and orderly veins. If not, it is toxic and should not be used.

From *Sheng Hui Fang*: To treat ten types of water retention in near-death cases, use half a *jin* of badger meat, sliced, with three *ge* of polished rice, three *sheng* of water, and cook into a porridge with scallions, Sichuan pepper, ginger, and fermented soybeans; consume.

Take a green-headed duck, decapitate it over the mortar, allowing the blood to drip in. Once the blood is fully drained, mix in the duck’s head and pound another five thousand times. Form into pills the size of *Firmiana* seeds. For severe cases, take ten pills on an empty stomach with plain hot water; for milder cases, take five. Take frequently, stopping after five days. This medicine promotes urination with miraculous efficacy.

From *Wei Zhou Du Xing Fang*: To treat water swelling that begins in the feet and ascends to the abdomen, which is fatal, cook one *dou* of red adzuki beans until extremely soft, take four to five *sheng* of the liquid, and soak the area below the knees in the warm broth. If the swelling has entered the abdomen, consume only the adzuki beans without other foods; this will also cure. Li Jiang’s *Bing Bu Shou Ji Fang* also records this method, which has proven effective.

**Section Twenty-Six: Formulas for Sudden Abdominal Masses**

For sudden, violent masses in the abdomen resembling stone, with stabbing pain and day-and-night wailing, if left untreated, death occurs within a hundred days. Formula: Steep two *jin* of *Achyranthes* in one *dou* of wine, seal tightly in hot ashes to warm and extract the flavor. Consume from five *ge* to one *sheng*, adjusting according to strength.

Another formula: Use *Sambucus* root in the same manner; even better.

Yao notes: *Achyranthes* wine is divinely effective.

Another formula: Take a large quantity of *Phytolacca* root, steam and pound it, then spread on new cloth placed over the abdomen (not directly on the skin). Replace when cool; do not cease day or night.

Another formula: On the fifth day of the fifth month, take ten *jin* of bottle gourd (peeled), one *chi* and two *cun* of cinnamon, and a duck-egg-sized lump of yellow earth from a stove. Pound together, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the afflicted area with cloth. Recovery occurs within three applications.

Another formula: Burn *Poncirus* wood to ash, leach with water to obtain eight *sheng* of liquid, and use to brew one *hu* of rice into wine. Begin with half a *ge*, gradually increasing to one or two *sheng* if no effect is observed. All cases are cured before finishing one batch. This ash is also used in dyeing crimson; the leaves are used in brewing wine. *Poncirus* is pronounced *zhi ren*.

Generally, masses develop gradually. If suddenly noticed and already large and firm, they are difficult to treat. Abdominal masses and accumulations impair eating and lead to emaciation. Treatments often employ potent medicines like *Xian Bing*, *Yu Hu*, and the Eight Toxins. Here, only simple and accessible remedies are selected.

Take *Polygonum cuspidatum* root (avoid those whose shadow falls on water), gather over a *dan* in weight, pound thoroughly, and decoct to extract juice for making pills. Cook five to six *sheng* of glutinous rice into porridge, mix with the medicine, and consume at midday after applying the medicine. Recovery follows.

Another formula: Take one *sheng* of the root, pound a thousand times, steep in wine, and consume three times daily, starting with a small amount. This wine treats masses better than many potent medicines.

Another formula: Burn one *dan* of silkworm droppings with mulberry firewood to ash, leach with water five times, and place a one-*chi*-long live softshell turtle in the liquid to cook until thoroughly done. Remove bones, shred finely, and decoct further until pills can be formed. Take seven pills the size of *Firmiana* seeds, three times daily.

Another formula: Pound two *liang* of *Aconitum* and three hundred Sichuan peppercorns into powder, mix with egg white, and form into pills the size of hemp seeds. Begin with one pill, gradually increasing to the size of soybeans, with a maximum of three pills per dose.

Sew the heart shut, place in a small copper vessel with good wine, and decoct until the heart is submerged and nearly dissolved. Add up to three *sheng* of wine as needed, decoct until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of hemp seeds. Take three pills, three times daily.

If the wine is exhausted yet the mixture remains undissolved, remove and pound it with honey to form pills—this is effective.

Another formula: Take half a *jin* of *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (rhubarb) powder, three *liang* of *Natrii Sulfas* (mirabilite), and one *jin* of honey. Combine and decoct over a gentle heat until the mixture can be formed into pills the size of *wutong* seeds. Take ten pills, three times daily.

**For treating turtle-like accumulations lodged beneath the heart, where the head and feet can be felt by hand and shift intermittently:**
Take a pair of white hens, fast them for one night, then the next morning feed them with fried rice cooked in lard. Collect their droppings, regardless of quantity, mix with urine in a copper vessel, and heat over a fire until dry. Pound into powder and take one *fangcunbi* spoonful, four to five times daily, until the accumulation is fully resolved. Continue feeding the hens to collect droppings until recovery is complete, then slaughter and consume the hens alone.

**For treating an object beneath the heart, large as a cup, preventing food intake:**
Take two *liang* of *Descurainiae Semen* (tingli seed), stir-fried, two *liang* of *Rhei Radix et Rhizoma* (rhubarb), and four *liang* of *Euphorbiae Helioscopiae Herba* (zeqi). Pound, sift, and form into honey pills, pounding a thousand times. Take two pills the size of *wutong* seeds, three times daily, gradually increasing the dose.

Formulas for *xian*-like accumulations, *bingzhe*-ghost accumulations, and other such pills are recorded separately in the major formulas.

**For treating qi bind beneath the ribs:**
Take two *liang* of *Euphorbiae Ebracteolatae Radix* (langdu), one *liang* of *Inulae Flos* (xuanfuhua), and two *liang* of *Aconiti Radix Lateralis Praeparata* (prepared fuzi). Pound, sift, and form into honey pills. Take two pills the size of *wutong* seeds, gradually increasing to three pills.

**Moxibustion method for accumulations:**
Use a copper vessel holding about two *sheng*, fill with fish oil to a depth of two to three *cun*, and prepare six or seven large moxa cones. Ignite the cones to warm the oil, cover the accumulation with heavy paper, and apply the vessel to press and warm it. Continue day and night without pause; replenish the oil as it depletes.

Another formula: Crush three *sheng* of *Zanthoxyli Pericarpium* (zhuyu), mix with wine, and boil until cooked. Wrap in cloth and apply to the accumulation. Replace when cool, and continue until the accumulation shifts away. Persist in warming until it fully resolves.

Alternatively, use fine *Zanthoxyli Pericarpium* powder mixed with egg white and *Aconiti Kusnezoffii Radix* (shegong) for oral intake.

Another formula: Take one *sheng* of yellow earth from a stove, pound thoroughly, then add more and pound again. Moisten with bitter wine until damp, apply to one side of a cloth, and place over the afflicted area. Replace when dry until the accumulation resolves.

**For treating women with accumulations beneath the navel, large as a cup or *sheng*, obstructing menstruation, causing intermittent pain, diarrhea, emaciation, and weakness—this is qi *jia*. If the mass feels firm and unyielding upon palpation, it is a flesh accumulation and incurable; if not, it may be treated.**
Take one *jin* of *Toxicodendri Resina* (dried lacquer) powder and thirty *jin* of fresh *Rehmanniae Radix* (dihuang). Pound the *dihuang* to extract its juice, then decoct the lacquer powder in the juice until it can be formed into pills.

Dry in the sun, grind into powder, and take one *fangcunbi* to two *qian* spoonfuls with warm clear wine, three times daily. For severe cases, take up to six doses day and night. If one rooster’s droppings are insufficient, feed another until enough is collected. Discontinue upon recovery.

Another formula: **For treating accumulations in the abdomen from fish, meat, or other toxins:**

Boil to reduce to one *sheng*, strain, and consume in one draught to induce vomiting; this cures the condition. Originally listed among miscellaneous treatments, this ailment arises from phlegm reversal and qi surging upward in the chest and diaphragm, termed "reversal headache." Vomiting provides immediate relief.
Alternatively, cook rice into a thick gruel of two to three *sheng*, adjust to lukewarm temperature, and drink entirely. After a short while, induce vomiting; once vomiting ceases, drink again. Repeat several times. In severe cases, continue until bile is vomited. This method is harmless and immediately effective.

Formula for Copious Phlegm in the Chest, Headache with Loss of Appetite, and Stagnant Phlegm upon Drinking Alcohol.
Two *liang* of *Dichroae Radix* (changshan), one *liang* of *Glycyrrhizae Radix* (gancao), one *liang* of *Usneae Herba* (songluo), and twenty-one *Trichosanthis Fructus* (guadi). Boil in one and a half *sheng* each of wine and water to reduce to one and a half *sheng*. Initially take seven *ge*; induce vomiting. If vomiting is incomplete, divide the remainder into two doses. Later, take *Pinelliae Decoction* (Banxia Tang).

From *Hu Qia*: Named *Fen Ge Tang* (Powder-Barrier Decoction).
One *liang* of *Alumen* (fanshi) and two *sheng* of water, boiled to reduce to one *sheng*. Add half a *ge* of honey and consume in one draught. If vomiting does not occur shortly after, drink a small amount of hot water.

Another formula: three *liang* each of *Asari Herba* (duheng) and *songluo*, and thirty *guadi*. Steep in one *sheng* and two *ge* of wine for two nights, strain, and take five *ge* warm. If vomiting does not occur after the first dose, take another in the evening.

Another formula: one *liang* of *guadi* and four *liang* of *Phaseoli Semen* (chixiaodou), ground to powder. Mix with three *ge* of warm water and consume, then lie down quietly. If vomiting is desired but does not occur, take another dose.

Another formula: first prepare one *sheng* of boiling water, then add one *sheng* of cold water, naming it "raw-cooked water." Consume three *ge* of salt, followed by this water. After a short while, vomiting will commence; manually induce it. If incomplete, take another two *ge* of salt and two *sheng* of water afterward. Alternatively, take more water; vomiting will not recur.

Another formula: four *liang* of *changshan* and half a *liang* of *gancao*. Boil in seven *sheng* of water to reduce to three *sheng*, then add half a *sheng* of honey. Take one *sheng*; if vomiting does not occur, take another dose. Honey may be omitted.
Consuming one of these formulas monthly prevents phlegm-fluid afflictions.
There is also *Xuanfu Wuyin* (Five Drinks with *Inulae Flos*), found in the major formulas.

For Chest Obstruction with Cold, Shortness of Breath, and *Bi* (stifling sensation).
*Bi* is pronounced *fubi*.
Two *liang* of *gancao*, three *liang* of *Poria* (fuling), and fifty crushed *Armeniacae Semen* (xingren). Boil in one *dou* and three *sheng* of water to reduce to six *sheng*, divided into five doses.

First pound *badou* into a paste, then add *lilu* powder and pound ten thousand times. Form into honey pills the size of sesame seeds. Take one to two or three pills.
The disease of the diaphragm is termed *gaohuang* (vital region). Decoctions and pills pass through directly, while acupuncture and moxibustion cannot reach it. Thus, pills are made for oral retention, allowing the qi and efficacy to permeate and fumigate. There is a *Wuge Wan* (Five Diaphragm Pills) formula:
Ten parts of *Ophiopogonis Radix* (maidong), deseeded, ten parts of roasted *gancao*, six parts each of *Zanthoxyli Pericarpium* (jiaomu), *Polygalae Radix* (yuanzhi), roasted *fuzi*, *Zingiberis Rhizoma* (ganjiang), *Ginseng Radix* (renshen), *gui*, and *Asari Radix et Rhizoma* (xixin). Pound, sift, and form into pills the size of a bullet with high-quality honey. Retain one pill in the mouth, gradually swallowing its juice, three pills daily. This governs shortness of breath, chest fullness, hardness beneath the heart, and cold qi.
There are over ten formulas for this condition, most being similar. This pill is the most effective. Though its ingredients are numerous, it does not align with the names of the five diaphragms—*youge* (worry diaphragm), *qige* (qi diaphragm), *huige* (anger diaphragm), and *hange* (cold diaphragm)—each with distinct diagnostic signs. In the major formulas, there is also *Qiqi Fang* (Seven Qi Formula), largely similar with minor differences.

Squeeze out the juice, discard the dregs, and take on an empty stomach in two doses. If diarrhea occurs, cease further doses. Those who tolerate wine well respond more readily. This formula, used by Cui Yuanliang, has proven highly effective in treating patients. *Qinjiao* must be fresh, high-quality, and net-veined.

From *Classified Essentials of the Cold Damage Canon*: For treating jaundice in men and women where medical treatment has failed, with yellowing of the ears and eyes, indigestion, abdominal distension, heat-generated yellow coating in the stomach, and dry stool causing the illness. Take one small *sheng* of rendered lard, warm, and consume in a single dose, three times daily. Recovery follows the passing of dry stool.

After three to five days, the yellow will disperse like thin clouds, though the eyes recover last. Full restoration takes a hundred days. After the body’s yellow fades, occasional sips of clear wine may hasten the clearing of eye yellow; without it, recovery is slower. Avoid hot noodles, pork, and fish. This is a secret formula from Xu Zicai’s family.

From *Zhengyuan Guangli Fang*: For jaundice with heart vexation, heat, dry mouth, and yellowing of skin and flesh. Boil twelve *fen* of *qinjiao* in one large *sheng* of cow’s milk until reduced to seven *ge*, strain, and take warm in two doses. This formula originates from Xu Renze.

Cut two large *liang* of rhubarb into pieces the size of *weiqi* stones, stir-fry with a small amount of *su* (ghee) until the *su* is fully absorbed. Take care not to scorch the rhubarb, as this will diminish its potency. Grind into powder and sift. Each day, on an empty stomach, boil three *ge* of water with two coin-sized slices of fresh ginger for over ten simmers. Remove the ginger, then take two *qian* of rhubarb powder, place it in a separate bowl, and mix with the ginger decoction. Consume in one draught. If any ginger decoction remains, sip it slowly until finished. This will purge copious cold pus and foul matter, and the ailment will be cured upon cessation.

Ancient physicians used potent medicines to attack illnesses, always adjusting dosages according to the patient’s strength and condition—they did not apply them indiscriminately. When Yao Sengyuan first served at court, Emperor Wu of Liang developed a fever and wished to take rhubarb. Sengyuan advised, “Rhubarb is a swift-acting purgative; Your Majesty is advanced in years and should not use it lightly.” The emperor disregarded his counsel and nearly collapsed. Later, Emperor Yuan suffered from a thoracic and abdominal ailment. All the physicians insisted that mild medicines should be used gradually to harmonize and unblock. Sengyuan, however, declared, “The pulse is surging and replete—this indicates retained food. Without rhubarb, there is no hope of recovery.” The emperor followed his advice and recovered.

From this, we see that modern physicians often use a single potent medicine to treat myriad illnesses. When they happen to cure a condition, they deem the formula miraculous, yet when they err, they never acknowledge their misapplication of the medicine. Such practitioners are legion—how can one not take heed!

**Prescription Thirty-Five: For Sudden Famine, Starvation, and Near-Death Exhaustion**
Grain is the sustenance of life; deprivation for several days can prove fatal. While *The Divine Farmer’s Classic* describes methods to stave off hunger, medical texts seldom address such techniques, likely because they border on the realm of immortals and transcend common practice. Thus, in years of famine, corpses lie strewn across the roads—truly lamentable.

Here, I record only the most accessible methods. If stranded in a desolate wilderness, fallen into a ravine, deep well, or ancient tomb, with no hope of rescue, one must drink water and practice qi absorption. The method is as follows:

Close the mouth, stir the tongue against the upper and lower teeth to generate saliva, and swallow it. Three hundred and sixty swallows per day are ideal; with practice, one may reach a thousand, naturally eliminating hunger. Initial fatigue may arise for three to five days, but thereafter, strength gradually returns.

Other methods, such as consuming the six *wu* hours of the twelve Earthly Branches, are omitted here, as one in dire straits may struggle to discern directions or time.

If water is available but no vessel, cup it in the left hand and recite: *"By the grace of the attending officials, true famine strikes. The correct red-yellow path avoids passing beneath city walls. Physicians, take heed for yourselves."* Conclude by tapping the teeth three times, then tapping the left hand three times with the right hand. Repeat this thrice, then drink. If a cup is later obtained, store water in it, hold it in the left hand, and tap it with an object in the right hand as before. Drinking three *sheng* daily will prevent hunger and restore health.

If able to traverse mountains and marshes:
Gather pine or cypress leaves, finely chop, and consume two *ge* with water, two to three *sheng* at midday. Alternatively, dig and wash white cogon grass roots, chop, and consume. These three substances may be sun-dried, pounded on stone, and taken in *fangcunbi* doses to sustain for a day.

If soybeans are available, roast until hot, then consume with water until sated; this provides relief for ten days. Red small beans are also effective. Roast both beans until yellow, grind into powder, and consume one to two *sheng* to sustain for ten days.

Among herbs, *atractylodes*, asparagus root, *ophiopogon*, Solomon’s seal, and fritillaria may be eaten raw or cooked, alone or together. Tree fungi, sandalwood, and white elm bark also stave off hunger.

In times of famine when grain is scarce and life depends on medicinal aid:
Take one *dou* of rice, wash thoroughly, steam and sun-dry it a hundred times, then pound. Consume once daily with water for thirty days; thereafter, one may abstain from food entirely while traveling three hundred *li* daily.

Another method: Soak one *dou* of non-glutinous rice in three *sheng* of wine, remove and sun-dry, then soak again until the wine is exhausted. Consume gradually, drinking when thirsty, to sustain for thirty days. One *hu* and two *sheng* suffice for a year.

There is also the *Guard the Center Pill* method. The above methods using rice and beans are easily obtained and prepared, harmonizing with grain qi to preserve strength without depletion. However, those of impure constitution may struggle with prolonged medicinal reliance; if possible, alternate with grains.

Refer to my *Grain Prescriptions* for further details.

**Additional Prescriptions**

From *Imperial Grace Formulary*:
**Method for Grain Abstinence and Immortal Ascension:**
Pound pine nuts into a paste, mix three *qian* with wine, and consume thrice daily to eliminate hunger. Drink water when thirsty, avoiding other foods. After a hundred days, the body becomes light, capable of traveling five hundred *li* daily.

From *Leisure Talks of a Rustic*:
**Master Fuhu’s Pine Resin Refinement Method:**
Boil ten *jin* of pine resin in water five times to remove bitterness. For each *jin* of refined resin, mix with four *liang* of poria powder. Take one *daogui* each morning with water to abstain from food for a year, extending lifespan with a light, clear body.

From *Baopuzi*:
During the reign of Emperor Cheng of Han, a hunter in the Zhongnan Mountains encountered a person without clothing, their body entirely covered in black hair, leaping over gullies and ravines as if flying. Stealthily observing their whereabouts, the hunters surrounded and captured them, discovering it was a woman. When questioned, she said: "I was a palace woman of Qin. When the eastern rebels arrived, the King of Qin surrendered and fled. Startled, I ran into the mountains. Starving and on the verge of death, an old man taught me to eat the leaves and seeds of pine and cypress. At first, they were bitter and astringent, but later I grew accustomed to them and no longer felt hunger. I no longer suffered from cold in winter or heat in summer." This woman was from the Qin era, and by the time of Emperor Cheng, over three hundred years had passed.

Pound boiled *liugen* (willow root bark) thoroughly, warm over fire, place in a silk pouch, and apply as a compress. Replace when cool. Highly effective.
Another remedy: Boil a wooden rice pestle until bubbling, wrap in silk, and apply to the breast. Use two *ya* (tooth-shaped) compresses, alternating dozens of times. Yao states it is wondrously effective.

**Breast Carbuncle Remedy:**
Take two *fen* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb), *lancao* (orchid grass), and *fulonggan* (yellow earth from beneath a stove), and two *fen* of fresh ginger. First, pound and sift the first three ingredients, then combine with ginger and pound again. Mix with vinegar and apply. The breast pain will cease. Extremely effective. Liu Juanzi omits the ginger.
Another version uses four *fen* of fresh ginger in equal parts. Elsewhere, it is recorded that using crucian carp yields immediate results.

The *Xiaopin* states this formula is excellent.

**Yao’s Breast Carbuncle Remedy:**
Take one *fen* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb), moistened rat droppings, and *huanglian* (coptis). Grind the first two ingredients into powder, then pound the rat droppings again. Mix with millet porridge water and apply around the breast. The pain will cease, and the condition will heal. If millet is unavailable, polished rice may be used instead.

Another remedy: Apply cow or horse dung, both effective. These methods resolve the swelling.

**Jealousy Breast Formula from the *Xiaopin*:**
Grind equal parts of *huangqin* (scutellaria), *bailian* (ampelopsis), and *shaoyao* (peony) into powder, sift, and take one *qianbi* with fermented grain water, five times daily. If the right breast is swollen, consume milk from the left breast; if the left breast is swollen, consume milk from the right breast. This will disperse the root of the swelling. Yao’s formula is identical and guarantees a cure.

**Yao’s Remedy:**
Pound fresh *dihuang* (rehmannia) and apply; replace when warm. Red beans are also effective.

Another note: If hundreds of treatments fail and the swelling remains hard and purple, use the earlier willow root bark method—heat until warm and apply to the swelling. It will heal overnight.

**General Note:**
If breast milk is not expelled and congeals internally, it is called "jealousy breast," which is more urgent than carbuncle.

**Xu Yu’s Remedy for Painful Breast Nodules:**
Take three *liang* each of *dahuang* (rhubarb) and *huanglian* (coptis). Boil in five *sheng* of water until reduced to one *sheng* and two *ge*. Divide into three doses; purgation will bring immediate healing.

Simply press and rub the area vigorously several times daily; it will resolve.

Another: Grind *gui* (cinnamon) or *duhuo* (angelica) with bitter wine and apply repeatedly. Excellent results.

**For Sudden Swelling on the Body or Face (Like Inflation):**
Crush thirty *badou* (croton seeds) with their skins, boil in five *sheng* of water until reduced to three *sheng*, strain, and dip cotton to wipe the swelling. It will vanish immediately—avoid contact with the mouth.

**For Sudden Red, Painful, Narrow, Elongated Swelling (Called *Yong*):**
Take five *liang* of deer antler, one *liang* of *bailian* (ampelopsis), four *liang* of *muli* (oyster shell), and one *liang* of *fuzi* (aconite). Grind, sift, mix with bitter wine, and apply to silk. Replace when dry.

**For Stone-like Carbuncle (Hard as Rock or Large Nodules, Unchanged in Color, or Stone Carbuncle That Does Not Resolve):**
Burn eight *liang* of deer antler to ash, take two *liang* of coarse, yellow *bailian* (ampelopsis), and one *jin* of whetstone (burn until red). Grind all into powder, mix with bitter wine to a thick paste, and apply to the carbuncle. Reapply when dry until resolved. Administer *lianqiao* (forsythia) decoction internally.

**Yao’s Method:**
Burn the stone until extremely red, then quench in five *sheng* of bitter wine. Repeat until the wine is reduced by half. Pound the stone and mix with the medicine. Use the remaining wine first; if insufficient, add more.

**Yao’s Note:**
If the swelling is extremely hard with a root, it is called "stone carbuncle." Moxibustion with one hundred cones should be applied to the top; the stone will fragment and emerge. If it does not, increase the moxa.

**General Warning:**
Carbuncles, deep-rooted sores, tumors, stone carbuncles, tendon nodules, and scrofula must never be treated with needles or cupping. Such methods often lead to disaster.

**For Unruptured Carbuncles:**
Grind *wancao* (sweet flag) into powder, mix with egg white, and apply thickly to paper. Replace when dry; the pain will subside.

**For Severe, Throbbing Carbuncle Swelling:**
Grind *dahuang* (rhubarb), sift, mix with bitter wine, and apply to the swelling. Replace when dry; within three applications, the swelling will reduce, no pus will form, and it will resolve. Extremely effective.

**For Unformed Carbuncle Pus:**
Apply earwax from a cow; it will heal immediately. If necrotic flesh remains, use a flesh-dissolving remedy, then apply ointment for healing.

**Flesh-Dissolving Formula:**
Take equal parts of white charcoal ash and *dihui* (reed ash), boil to a paste. Do not prepare in advance—it loses efficacy after ten days. Also effective for removing moles.

**General Carbuncle Formula:**
Soak *gualou* (trichosanthes) root and red adzuki beans in bitter wine for five days, then dry, roast, and grind into powder. Mix with bitter wine, apply to paper, and affix to the swelling. Effective.

**Hidden Resident’s Effective Formula for Resolving Carbuncles:**
Grind two parts *bailian* (ampelopsis) and one part *lilu* (veratrum) into powder, mix with wine to a paste, and apply three times daily. Highly effective.

**For Bone-Exposing Sores:**
Grind two *fen* each of *huanglian* (coptis) and *muli* (oyster shell) into powder. First wash with salted wine, then apply.

**Ge’s Sudden *Biaoju* Sores (Clustering Like Grains on Hands, Feet, or Shoulders, Oozing Fluid):**
Roast and pound *wujing* (turnip), wrap, and apply while rolling over the sores day and night without ceasing.

**For Deep-Rooted Sores at the Fingertips (Red-Black, Difficult to Treat):**
Follow major formulas; simple remedies are insufficient.

**For Chronic Bone Carbuncles (Oozing Fluid When Pressed, Unhealed for Years):**
Heat maltose and apply to the sore, then press a fresh crucian carp onto it. After the time it takes to cook rice, scrape and inspect—small worms will emerge. Wash and reapply the medicine until the worms are gone; healing will follow.

**Yao’s Formula on *Biaoju* (Flame Carbuncle):**
*Biaoju* arises suddenly in the flesh as a dark nodule, the size of a bean or grain. In severe cases, it may grow as large as a plum, appearing red, black, white, or green. The lesion contains a core with deep roots, and after a brief period, the surrounding area swells entirely. The blisters turn dusky, purplish-black, capable of rotting sinews and bones. If the toxin enters the viscera, it may prove fatal. In the South, it is called *tuozhu* (clinging toxin). Where it afflicts thick flesh, excise it, then cauterize with red-hot iron three times until charred like charcoal. Alternatively, apply moxibustion directly on the dark core, one hundred cones for best effect. In early spring, layer *suanmo* leaves around the lesion to prevent spread. Drink juices of *kuigen* (mallow root), *xijiao* (rhinoceros horn), and *shengma* (cimicifuga) to purge internal and external heat. The treatment follows the method for *dandu* (cinnabar toxin).

Chop the nine ingredients, simmer in two and a half *sheng* of lard, stirring thrice up and thrice down. When the paste forms, strain and discard the dregs. Apply to the sore, massaging the surrounding area, three times daily.

**Decoction for *Danyong* (Cinnabar Carbuncle) at Onset (Spreading and Enlarging, Including Minor *Dan Tuo* in Children):**
*Shengma* (cimicifuga), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *xiongqiong* (ligusticum), each two *liang*; *huangqin* (scutellaria), *mangxiao* (mirabilite), each three *liang*; *danggui* (angelica), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *lingyangjiao* (antelope horn), each one *liang*. Chop the nine ingredients, boil in one *dou* and three *sheng* of water to five *sheng*, strain, return to the pot, and stir in *mangxiao* with a wooden stick until a paste forms. Adjust temperature, spread on cloth, and apply to the swelling. Repeat until the swelling dissipates. This is Wang Lian’s secret formula from Ganlin—take care to avoid the genitals.

**Hu Powder for *Biaochuang* (Flame Sores, Spreading with Copious Discharge):**
Roast *hufen* (lead powder), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *qianru* (rubia), and *huanglian* (coptis), each two *fen*. Grind into powder, sift, and dust onto the sore thrice daily. Highly effective.

**Paste for All Carbuncle Sores:**
Wax, *luanfa* (human hair), *fanshi* (alum), *songzhi* (pine resin), each one *liang*; lard, four *liang*. First melt the hair, then add alum when the hair dissolves. When the alum dissolves, add pine resin; when the resin dissolves, add wax; when the wax dissolves, add lard. Apply to the sore.

**Red Dragon Skin Decoction for Washing Putrid, Festering Sores:**
Chop three *sheng* of *hushupi* (oak bark), boil in one *dou* of water to five *sheng*. Use cold in spring and summer, warm in autumn and winter. Wash breast sores and all putrid sores, then apply paste.

**Rhubarb Decoction for Early Pain in *Fabei* (Carbuncle on the Back):**
*Dahuang* (rhubarb), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *huangqin* (scutellaria), each two *liang*; *shengma* (cimicifuga), two *liang*; *zhizi* (gardenia), one hundred pieces. Boil the five ingredients in nine *sheng* of water to three and a half *sheng*. Drink until several bowel movements occur, then stop. If no movement, take again.

**Mu Zhansi Powder for *Fabei* (Back Carbuncle), *Faru* (Breast Carbuncle in Women), and *Changyong* (Intestinal Carbuncle):**
*Muzhansi* (aralia), *zhihoupo* (honey-fried magnolia bark), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *xixin* (asarum), *gualou* (trichosanthes), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *renshen* (ginseng), *jiegeng* (platycodon), *baijiang* (patrinia), each one *liang*. Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi* with wine, seven times by day and four by night—more is better. If the affliction is above, vomiting occurs; if below, pus and blood discharge. This pertains to *changyong* (intestinal carbuncle), where the swelling is painless. Long-term use treats all carbuncles and hemorrhoids. If the sore has already ulcerated, healing is swift. No *fabei* (back carbuncle) is incurable, and the swelling resolves unnoticed. For prolonged use, omit *baijiang* (patrinia), which is especially effective for *faru* (breast carbuncle), postpartum conditions, and abdominal masses in women. All are Liu Juanzi’s formulas.

**Liu Juanzi’s Mu Zhansi Powder for Dissolving Pus in Carbuncles:**
*Muzhansi* (aralia), *guixin* (cinnamon bark), *renshen* (ginseng), *xixin* (asarum), *baijiang* (patrinia), *ganjiang* (dried ginger), *zhihoupo* (honey-fried magnolia bark), *zhigancao* (honey-fried licorice), *fangfeng* (saposhnikovia), *jiegeng* (platycodon), each one *liang*. Grind into powder, take one *fangcunbi*. Upon swallowing, one feels it flow into the sore. If the carbuncle has been cauterized but not ulcerated, it may be taken. If the sore has not ulcerated, omit *baijiang*. Occasionally, this formula may reduce a carbuncle to water.

**Bailian Paste for Unresolved *Yong* Swellings, Scrofula, and Nodules:**
*Bailian* (ampelopsis), *huanglian* (coptis), *dahuang* (rhubarb), *huangqin* (scutellaria), *wangcao* (lithospermum), *chishizhi* (red halloysite), *wuzhuyu* (evodia), *shaoyao* (peony), each four *fen*. Grind, sift, and mix with egg white into a paste. Spread on old cloth and apply, leaving a small opening. Replace when dry. Heals.

**For Life-Threatening *Fabei* (Back Carbuncle):**
Take a winter melon, cut off the top, and place it over the sore. When the melon rots, cut it away and replace. Before the melon is exhausted, the sore will have contracted—then nourish with paste.

**Alternative Formula:**
Grind *fulonggan* (furnace earth) into powder, mix with wine, and apply thickly to the sore. Replace when dry; recovery follows swiftly.

**Another Formula:**
Toast *wutongziye* (paulownia leaves) on a griddle until charred, sift through silk, mix with honey, and apply. Replace when dry.

**Miscellaneous Effective Formulas for *Yong* Swellings (Treating Heat Swellings):**
Pound *jiazi* (mustard seeds) with *baiye* (cypress leaves) and apply—universally effective. Wild mustard is even better.

**Another Formula:**
Grind *xiaojiezi* (small mustard seeds) into powder, mix with vinegar into cakes, and apply to swellings or scrofula. Check frequently; stop when the swelling subsides to avoid damaging flesh. Effective for *mafugu* (horse bone carbuncle).

**Another Formula:**
Burn human feces into ash, mix with vinegar into a paste, and apply to the swelling. Replace when dry—highly effective.

**Another Formula:**
Take yellow *xionghuang* (realgar) and *cihuang* (orpiment), heat until red, then douse with strong vinegar. Reheat and douse again until the stones soften like mud. Scrape and apply to the swelling; if dry, mix with vinegar. This is a great secret.

**Method to Resolve Swellings with Moxibustion:**
Slice a single garlic clove crosswise to a thickness of one *fen*, place on the swelling’s head, and apply moxa cones the size of *wutongzi* (paulownia seeds), one hundred cones. If no reduction is felt, repeat frequently—more is better. Avoid excessive heat; if pain is felt, lift the garlic. Replace charred garlic with fresh. Do not burn the skin or flesh. If the body is dry, moxibustion is unnecessary.

I have once suffered from a large swelling below the lower abdomen, and moxibustion cured it. Whenever I use this method, it proves highly effective.

**Another Formula:**
Take the kernel from the head of fresh ginseng [text unclear], or mix magnetite powder with vinegar and apply.

**Another Formula:**
Apply licorice [text unclear] to this swelling—do not ingest the plantain seed.

**Another Formula:**
Apply chicken-intestine herb.

**Another Formula:**
Apply white *bai lian* (ampelopsis) powder—also effective.

**For Hot Swellings and Boils:**
Apply roasted glue repeatedly, ten or more times a day, and it will resolve. Especially effective for treating boils in children, with divine results each time.

**For All Toxic Swellings with Unbearable Pain:**

**Another Formula:**
Pound castor bean and apply—immediate relief.

**For Wind-Toxin Swellings on Palms and Soles:**
Mix equal parts ground Sichuan pepper and salt with vinegar, and apply—it will resolve.

**For Carbuncles with Foul, Rotten Flesh:**
Apply white *lan ru* (Solanum) powder. When the flesh is gone, stop and apply other ointments. If flesh does not regenerate, apply astragalus powder. *Lan ru* and astragalus halt all malignant flesh. If the flesh persists, use seven heads of red-skinned *lan ru* ground into powder—take half a *qianbi* and mix with three *qianbi* of white *lan ru* powder to apply. This is Yao’s formula, and it heals.

**For Malignant Vessel Disease:**
Suddenly, red vessels resembling earthworms appear on the body. This arises from evil wind entering the collaterals in spring or winter, causing blood stasis. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*, lance to remove blood, and apply *Red Sage Ointment*—it will heal after some days. When I crossed mountains and ridges, I suffered from this and regularly took *Five Fragrances Decoction*, applying mung beans to reduce the swelling. The following are all Yao’s formulas.

**For Malignant Nodule Disease:**
Suddenly, nodules like plums or apricots appear in the flesh, or small ones like soybeans, with sharp pain moving beneath the skin, accompanied by fever and chills. This disease arises abruptly; if the toxin enters the abdomen, it can kill. This affliction is common in the south. Take *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction* and apply mung beans—it will resolve immediately. For children, applying *Red Sage Ointment* is also effective.

**For Malignant Flesh Disease:**
Suddenly, flesh like red adzuki beans protrudes from the body, growing into shapes like cow or horse udders or rooster combs. Take *Rhaponticum Decoction* internally, and externally cauterize with a heated iron, three times daily, until slightly charred. Apply *Cimicifuga Ointment*.

**For Qi Pain Disease:**
Suddenly, a localized pain like a blow appears in the body, unbearable and wandering, flaring up intermittently. When the pain subsides, the area feels cold as if touched by frost or snow. This arises from sudden cold injuring the body during winter warmth extending into spring. First take several doses of *Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction*. Also, boil willow bark in white wine and apply warm compresses. Where red spots appear, lance to remove blood.

**Five Fragrances and Forsythia Decoction:**

**Rhaponticum Decoction:**
Treats carbuncles, cinnabar toxins, swellings, and malignant flesh.
*Rhaponticum, white ampelopsis, scutellaria, white swallowwort, roasted immature orange fruit, cimicifuga, roasted licorice, peony, ephedra* (nodes removed, each 2 *liang*), *rhubarb* (3 *liang*). Boil the ten ingredients in 1 *dou* of water to yield 3 *sheng*. If no herbs are available, use rhubarb to purge—also effective. For cinnabar toxins, lance to remove blood.

Chop the twelve ingredients, soak in 2 *sheng* of bitter wine overnight, then simmer with 4 *jin* of lard until the wine evaporates. Do not overcook. Strain and apply to affected areas five times daily. Spread on old cloth and apply. This ointment may also be taken internally—consume sparingly after a thorough bowel movement. (Same as *Xiaopin*.)

**Cimicifuga Ointment:**
Treats cinnabar toxins, hot swellings, and sores.
*Cimicifuga, white ampelopsis, rhaponticum, mirabilite* (each 2 *liang*), *scutellaria, immature orange fruit, forsythia, snake’s tongue herb* (each 3 *liang*), *gardenia* (20 pieces), *elder root* (4 *liang*). Chop the ten ingredients finely, place in a vessel, soak in 3 *sheng* of water for half a day, then simmer with 5 *sheng* of lard until the water evaporates. Strain and apply five times daily. For urgent cases, decoct in water. Extremely effective.

**Ge’s Formula for Sudden Toxic Swellings with Acute Pain:**
Boil willow bark in wine until hot and apply as a compress—the pain will cease.

**Appended Formulas:**

**From *Sheng Jin Fang*:**
Treats brain abscesses, back carbuncles, deep-rooted boils, hot boils, and malignant sores.
Finely chop a rabbit’s head from the twelfth month, place in a jar, and seal tightly—the longer it is stored, the better. Spread thickly on cloth and apply to hot, painful areas, changing frequently like ice. It will heal.

**From *Qian Jin Fang*:**
Treats back carbuncles and deep-rooted swellings, whether ulcerated or not.
Mix 3 *sheng* of fermented soybeans with a little water, pound into a paste, and form into cakes 0.3 *cun* thick. If the swelling has an opening, do not cover it; place the soybean cake over the opening and apply moxibustion with mugwort until warm. Maintain warmth without burning the flesh.

**Appended Formulas:**

If the swelling is hot and painful, change the compress urgently—the ailment will abate, and the patient will soon recover. Apply twice daily.

If moxibustion is used and pus begins to flow from a preexisting sore, the condition will improve.

**From *Waizhai Miyao*:**
Treats impending back carbuncles (with chills and shivering as if about to erupt) or existing sores and swellings.
Dissolve **3 liang** of **xiao shi** (borax) in **1 sheng** of warm water until dissolved, then cool.

Frequent changes will swiftly heal the condition.

**From *Jiyan Fang*:**
Treats back carbuncles.
Take **100 live snails**, place them in a clean **1 sheng** jar with **1 bowl of fresh-drawn water**, seal, and leave overnight until dawn. Remove the snails and discard them. The water will resemble saliva—mix with **zhen ge powder** (real oyster powder) in any quantity, apply to the sore, and brush with a chicken feather. Repeat **10+ times daily** until the heat and pain subside, at which point the sore will heal.

**From *Cui Yuanliang’s Haishang Fang* (Secret Method for Back Carbuncles):**
Li Beihai says: This formula was divinely revealed and is supremely secret.
Grind **3 large liang of licorice root**, sift the powder, and mix with **9 liang of barley flour** in a large dish until evenly blended. Add a small amount of high-quality ghee, knead thoroughly, and shape into cakes slightly larger than the sore. Apply hot to the swelling, covering with oil paper and old paper to allow ventilation. Replace when cool. If pus forms, it will drain naturally; if no pus forms, the swelling will dissolve internally.
**Note:** While using this remedy, the patient must consume **astragalus gruel**—this is most effective.

Another method:
Lightly roast **1 large liang of licorice root**, grind it, and steep in **1 large sheng of water**. Place a small knife horizontally across the container and leave it exposed overnight. At dawn, stir to emulsify the liquid and drink the froth. This treats all sores, swellings, and back carbuncles with remarkable efficacy.

**From *Mei Shi Fang*:**

Another method for treating **all carbuncles** that have already formed pus but fear needling to break them, ensuring rapid drainage:
Take the **first feather** from beneath a white rooster’s wing—one stalk from each side—burn to ash, grind, and administer with water.

From *Mei Shi Fang*:
Apply **sparrow dung** to the head; it will soon rupture. **Male sparrow dung** is superior; firmness indicates maleness.

**Note:** Realgar has long been used to treat **carbuncles and abscesses**. In *Zhou Li · Yang Yi* (Physician of Ulcers), it states:
*"In treating carbuncles and abscesses, the Five Toxins are used to attack them."* Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains:
*"Modern medical prescriptions include Five Toxin medicines, made by mixing yellow *huangdi* (瓦), stone gall, cinnabar, realgar, *yushi* (誉石), and magnetite, then burning them for three days and nights. The rising smoke is collected with chicken feathers and applied to the wound. Rotten flesh and bone will then be expelled entirely."*

Thus, the scholar-official Yang Yi once recorded:
*"When Zhishu Guan was young, a carbuncle formed on his cheek, spreading to the jaw and outer ear, swelling like an overturned bowl. It ulcerated, draining pus and blood incessantly, causing unbearable pain. After countless treatments over a year without improvement, someone advised him to follow Zheng’s method. After preparing and applying the burned medicine, within moments, the rotting bone—including two teeth—drained out, and he recovered fully, remaining healthy afterward."* This confirms the swift efficacy of ancient prescriptions in treating disease.

The *huangdi* (瓦) used in this process resembles the glazed tiles sold in markets today. In modern alchemy, yellow glazed tiles (*huangzhen*) are still employed, as recorded in antiquity. *Huangdi* is pronounced *wǔ*.

From *Mei Shi Fang*:
For **postpartum lactation failure**, where milk accumulates and forms a carbuncle, apply crushed *pu gong yao* (蒲公草) to the swelling, changing it three or four times daily. Commonly called *pu gong ying* (蒲公英), though the name is corrupted from *púgōngyīng* to *púgōngguō* in speech. The juice may also be ingested by boiling it.

Another method for treating **jealous milk carbuncles**:
Crush cloves into powder and administer with water, one *fangchén* dose.

Another method for treating **cracked nipples**:
Apply crushed clove powder topically.

From *Qian Jin Fang*:
For **jealous milk**:
Mix **house dust** with vinegar and apply it. This also treats **scrotal swelling**.

From *Ling Yuan Fang*:
For **initial breast abscesses**, where swelling and hardness form, threatening pus drainage, one dose suffices:
Take **true birch bark from the north**, boil in *wugui* (無灰) wine, and administer one *fangchén* dose. Rest afterward until recovery.

From *Sheng Hui Fang*:
For **persistent breast carbuncles**:
Use **half a *jin* of wheat flour**, toast until golden, mix with vinegar into a paste, and apply to the breast. It will dissolve immediately.

From *Chan Bao*:
For **breast and carbuncle swellings**:
Take **chicken dung powder**, administer one *fangchén* dose, repeating three times at short intervals. It will heal.

*Mei Shi Fang* also treats **cracked nipples** with the same method.

From *Jian Yao Ji Zhong*:
For **female breast carbuncles** where pus does not drain, forming internal abscesses (**jealous milk**):

Another method for treating **blocked lactation** (*chui nai*):
**Du Sheng San** (独胜散):
Take **half *liang* of white cloves**, grind into powder. Administer one *qian* dose with warm wine, without regard to time.

From *Zi Mu Mi Lu*:

From *Yang Yan Nan Xing Fang*:
For **unbearable pain from blocked lactation**:
Use **baked *chuan shan jia* (穿山甲), *mu tong* (木通), and raw *zi ran tong* (自然铜)**, each one *liang*. Grind into powder. Take two *qian* per dose with warm wine, without regard to time.

*Shi Yi Xin Jing* states:
For **blocked lactation without itching or pain**, where the breast hardens like stone:

Wrap **paper rings** around the swollen area, fill the center with **saltpeter (*xiāo shí*)**, and pour water over it with a spoon. Once the heat subsides, **pain will cease.**

**Method for Treating Head Ulcers (*Tóu Chuāng*)** and all heat ulcers (*Rè Chuāng*):**
First, cleanse with **a small amount of vinegar (*cù*)** mixed with water to remove the scabs. Then, wash with **warm water** until dry. Take **centipede powder (*bǎi cǎo shuāng*)**, finely grind, mix with **a little talc (*ní fěn*)**, and apply with **raw oil (*shēng yóu*)**—**itch will heal immediately.**

**Method for Treating Malignant Ulcers (*È Chuāng*):**
A **Tang-era record** of this case states:
In the **Jiangzu region**, there was once a merchant whose **left arm developed an ulcer resembling a human face**, yet without other suffering. When the merchant playfully dripped wine into its mouth, the face turned **red**, and when food was given to it, the ulcer could **consume it**. If too much was eaten, the arm swelled, and if nothing was eaten, the entire arm **became paralyzed**. A skilled physician instructed him to test all possible medicines—**metals, minerals, herbs, and trees**—but none caused discomfort until **fritillary bulb (*bèi mǔ*)** was administered. The ulcer **frowned and closed its mouth**, and the merchant rejoiced, saying: *“This medicine can cure it!”*
He then **pierced the ulcer’s mouth with a small reed tube**, administered the medicine, and in **a few days**, a scab formed—**the wound healed**, though its nature remained unknown. **Careful consideration reveals:** this was not a **golden ulcer (*Jīn Chuāng*)** as described in *The Classic of Materia Medica* (*Běn Jīng*).

**Method for Treating Sudden Onset of Leprosy (*Lài Bìng*),** where skin becomes **numb**, or **itches persistently like crawling insects**, or **vision is obscured as if by hanging threads**, or **itch turns red and black—**this must be treated **urgently** with **barbarian wine (*mán yí jiǔ*)**, the best quality.

**Method for Treating White Leprosy (*Bái Lài*):**
Take **five jīn of sophora root (*kǔ cān*)**, and **three dǒu of wine**, steep them, and **drink without cessation**. Additionally, take the **root bark of sophora (*kǔ cān pí gēn*)**, grind into powder, and take orally—**effects verified.**

**Another Method:**
Take **one thousand stalks of mugwort (*ài cǎo*)**, boil them thickly, and use the liquid to steep **fermented grains (*qū*)** into wine. **Drink regularly until intoxicated**—**Ma Tong’s prescription.**

**Ma Tong’s Prescription:**
Take **one whole large viper (*dà shǎn shé*)**, chop it carefully without injury, and steep in wine—**one dǒu for large individuals, five shēng for smaller ones**. Warm with **chaff fire (*jiāng huǒ*)**, let it settle, then extract **one cùn of the viper**, mix with **pig fat rendered in the twelfth lunar month (*là yuè zhū gāo*)**, and apply to the ulcers—**itch will subside.**
This also treats **rat-bite ulcers (*shǔ lián*)** and all malignant ulcers (*È Chuāng*).

**Another Method:**
Take **two jīn of sophora root (*kǔ cān*)**, **two liǎng of honeybee nest (*lù fēng fāng*)**, **two jīn of fermented grains (*qū*)**, and **three dǒu of water**, steep the medicine overnight, strain, and ferment with **two shēng of glutinous millet (*shǔ mǐ*)** until ready. **Drink gradually, three times daily.**
**One variation adds** the **root bark of sophora (*kǔ cān pí*)**—**even more effective.**

**Supplementary Prescriptions:**

**From *Sacred Benevolent Prescriptions* (*Shèng Huì Fāng*):**
**Method for Treating Severe Wind Conditions (*Dà Fēng Jí*),** where **bones and flesh rot away**, **every joint aches acidly**, **eyebrows and hairline fall out**, and **the body itches persistently**:
Take **one jīn of horseweed (*mǎ xiān hāo*)**, finely chop, and **parch-roast into a powder**. Before each meal and at night, take **two qián**, adjusted with **warm wine**.

**Another Method for Treating Severe Wind Conditions (*Dà Fēng Jí*),** to **regrow eyebrows and hairline**:
Take **one jīn of Chinese juniper leaves (*cè bǎi yè*)**, **steam nine times and dry in the sun nine times**, pound and sift into powder. Refine with **honey**, form pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (*wú tóng zǐ*)**, and take **three times daily, one at night**, with **five to ten pills in warm water**. After **one hundred days**, **new growth will appear**.

**Another Method for Treating Severe Wind (*Dà Fēng*),** where **hair on the head and face falls out**:
Take **mulberry twig ash (*sāng zhàng huī*)**, wash with **hot water** to extract the juice, and bathe the face. Then, take **soybean water (*dà dòu shuǐ*)** to grind into a paste, and **apply with horseweed ash (*mǎ xiān hāo huī*)**—**the efficacy is even better**. Next, use **boiled water with green beans (*lǜ dòu*)**, remove the skin, and take the **clean beans**—**do not exceed ten doses**. **Bath the head every other day**, and **wash the face daily**.

**Another Method for Treating White Leprosy (*Bái Lài*):**
Take **unlimited amounts of horseweed (*mǎ biān cǎo*)**, grind into powder, and before each meal, take **one qián**, adjusted with **schizonepeta and mint decoction (*jīng jiè bó hé tāng*)**.

**From *Dietary Therapy* (*Shí Liáo*):**
**Method for Treating Leprosy (*Lài Bìng*):**
Take **one jīn of white honey (*bái mì*)** and **two jīn of fresh ginger (*shēng jiāng*)**, pound to extract the juice. First, weigh **equal amounts** into a **wok**, then place **the honey in the wok**, melt it, and weigh **five jīn liǎng**. Next, add **the ginger juice to the honey**, simmer with **gentle fire** until the ginger juice is fully consumed. Weigh the honey again—**one jīn liǎng**—and **rest immediately**. The medicine is now complete.

**For a Leprosy Sufferer of Thirty Years:**
At dawn, take a pill the size of a large date (*zǎo*), **one dose**, three times daily. **Alcohol may be taken freely** as a beverage.

**Avoid:** raw cold foods, vinegar, slippery substances, and foul-smelling items. **Its benefits are vast**, and **it has saved countless lives**—too numerous to recount all.

**From *Secret Essentials of the Outer Chamber* (*Wàitái Mìyào*):**
**Treatment for Severe Wind-Related Illness (*Èfēng Jí*):**
Take **pine resin (*sōng zhī*)**, refine it, and drop it into **cold water twenty times**. Form into pills with honey, and take **two liǎng** on an empty stomach, **three times daily**. For those with a **collapsed nasal septum (*bí zhù duàn lí*)**, this will correct it in **three hundred days**. **Avoid salt and sexual activity**.

**From *The Master Who Embraces Simplicity* (*Bàopǔ Zǐ*) says:
**Zhào Qú** suffered from leprosy for many years, and no physician could cure him. His family then **brought provisions** and fled to a **mountain cave** to seek help. Zhào lamented his misfortune, **weeping bitterly**.

After a month, a **Daoist immortal (*xiān rén*)** passed through the cave and saw him. Moved by pity, the immortal inquired into his condition. Zhào, recognizing the stranger as an extraordinary being, **knocked his head in reverence** and **confessed his plight**, begging for his life. The immortal then took a **medicine from his pouch** and gave it to him, instructing him on its use.

In **over a hundred days**, his sores healed, his complexion brightened, and his skin became smooth. When the immortal returned to check on him, Zhào **repaid his gratitude** for saving his life and **begged for the recipe**. The immortal replied: *"This is pine resin; there is an abundance of it there. You may refine and take it. With prolonged use, your body will grow lighter, your strength will multiply a hundredfold. You will traverse perilous heights and cross treacherous depths without fatigue, live to a hundred years with teeth unfallen and hair unsilvered, and at night, you will often emit a radiant glow—bright as a mirror."*

**From *The Transmission of Divine Responses and Immortals* (*Gǎnyìng Shénxiān Zhuàn*) says:
**Cuī Yán**, a soldier in the **Left Attendant Cavalry Corps (*Zuǒ Qīn Jì Jūn*)**, fell ill one day. His **two eyes grew dim**, and he could no longer **discern figures** even at close range. His **eyebrows and hair fell out**, his **nose bridge collapsed**, and his skin developed **sores like scabies (*xiǎn*)**—all deemed **incurable afflictions**. His family **despaired of his survival**.

He then **sought refuge in the Luó Valley of Yángzhou**. While there, he **encountered a wandering Daoist (*dào liú*)** who emerged from the valley. The Daoist **did not reveal his name or lineage** but gave him a prescription:
Take **one to two jīn of soapberry thorns (*zào jiǎo cì*)**, burn them to **ash**, then **steam and dry** them thoroughly. Grind into powder, and **boil a strong decoction of rhubarb (*dà huáng*)**. Take **one qián** with the decoction before meals for **one decennial period (*shùn*)**. His **temple hair will regrow**, his skin will **brighten and become supple**, and his condition will be cured. His **eyesight will double**, surpassing the norm.

After obtaining this remedy, the Daoist **retired into the mountains**, leaving no trace of his whereabouts.

**From *The Chronicle of Court and Field* (*Zhāoyě Huìzǎi*) says:

「In **Shangzhou**, there was a person afflicted by **great wind** (*dàfēng*), whom his family despised. They built a thatched hut for him in the mountains, where a black snake (*wūshé*) fell into his wine jar (*jiǔ géng*). The patient was unaware, but after drinking the wine, his condition gradually improved. Only when the jar’s bottom still contained the snake’s bones did he realize its cause.

**Daoist Caution** (*dào jǐn*) notes: According to **Li Zhao’s *History Supplement*** (*Guóshǐ Bǔ*), Li Zhou’s younger brother suffered from **wind** (*fēng*), and someone suggested that **snake wine** (*shéjiǔ*) could cure it. Thus, he sought a black snake, placed it alive in a jar, and fermented it with **malted barley** (*qū niè*). For several days, the snake’s cries never ceased. When the wine was ready, its aroma was intense, and he drank it fully. In moments, it all transformed into water, leaving only the snake’s **hair and scales** (*máo fā*). The account in *Zhāoyě Huìzǎi* is likely too extreme to be taken lightly.

**Treatment for Sudden Onset of Verminous Fistulas** (*chú dé chóngshǔ zhūliú fāng*)—**Fourth Remedy for Afflictions of the Scrotum** (*dì sìshíyī fāng*)

**Bo Ge** (*Gě Shì*) says: All swellings have their corresponding **pathogenic factors** (*xiāngzhǔ*), and patients should examine the original remedy.

Most often, it appears on both sides of the head, with **clustered nodules** (*lěilěi yǒu hé*).

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: For **verminous fistulas** (*shǔliú*) where the **nodules** (*hé*) are painful and not yet suppurated (*wèi chéng nóng*), apply **cypress leaves** (*bó yè*), sprinkle with **refined salt** (*fá yán*), and **moxibust** (*wēn*) until the heat penetrates downward—it will then dissolve.

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If one suddenly contracts **verminous fistulas** (*shǔliú*) with **afflictions of the scrotum** (*yīnzhǒng*) yet no sores have formed but the area is already hot, use the following remedy quickly: Pound **black rooster’s feet** (*wū jī zú*) or **plantain herb** (*chēqián cǎo*), and apply it. If the **nodules** (*hé*) have already formed and **pus and blood** (*nóng xuè*) are discharging, smear with **hot pig dung** (*rè niú shǐ*), three times daily.

Another remedy: Take **white fresh skin** (*bái xiān pí*), boil and consume one *sheng* (升), causing the vermin to be vomited up.

Another remedy: Take one **cat or weasel** (*māo lí*), prepare it as a soup (*zuò gēng rú shí fǎ*), and ingest it on an empty stomach (*kòng xīn jìn zhī*)—the vermin will die and exit.

Or, swallow it raw—its efficacy is even greater.

Another remedy: Extract a **vermin** (*shǔ*) from the center of a fistula, one as large as a **chicken egg** (*jī zǐ dà*), and with **three-year-old pig fat** (*sān suì làyuè zhū zhī*) from the **twelfth lunar month** (*làyuè*), decoct it until the vermin’s **bones, flesh, and hair** (*gǔ ròu yú fā*) are completely dissolved. Apply half to the sore and consume the other half with wine (*jiǔ fú*)—the vermin will exit through the wound.

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: A **secret method** (*mì bù chuán zhī fǎ*)—**Liu Xun’s Remedy for Verminous Fistulas** (*Liú Xún shǔliú fāng*).
Use **tortoise shell** (*guī ké*), **roasted licorice root** (*zhì gān cǎo*), **cinnamon bark** (*guì xīn*), **realgar** (*xióng huáng*), **dried ginger** (*gān jiāng*), and **roasted weasel bones** (*zhì lí gǔ*), divide them equally, pound into a powder, mix with **honey** (*mì*), and apply to the wound—it will never fail. First, **moxibust** (*jiǔ*) to create the wound, then apply the medicine effectively.

Another remedy: **Five升 of oak bark** (*zhà mù bái pí*), combined with **one斗 of wine** (*yī dǒu jiǔ*), decoct together. Remove the bark when done, and reduce the liquid to **two升** (*èr shēng*). Consume it all, and the **old stagnant flesh** (*sùròu*) will emerge—it will then heal.

Another remedy: **Fistula sores with seated flesh** (*liúchuāng zuò ròu gāo*).
Use **white mulberry bark** (*kuàngshù bái pí*), **vermin flesh** (*shǔròu*), and **angelica root** (*dāngguī*), each **two liǎng** (两); **leek white** (*xiè bái*), **three liǎng**; **raw rehmannia root** (*shēng dìhuáng*), **five liǎng**; and **three升 of three-year-old pig fat** (*sān suì zhū zhī*). Decoct into a plaster (*jiān gāo chéng*), apply it to the wound, and cover the **orifice** (*kǒng*) to promote new flesh growth.

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If the sores are numerous but the **orifices** (*kǒng*) are small, it is **ant fistula** (*mǐliú*). The remedy: Burn **dried carp scales** (*bǐng lí jiǎ*), mix with **pig fat** (*zhū gāo*), and apply.

Another remedy: Burn **twenty-one spiders** (*zhīzhū*), and use the ashes effectively.

Another remedy for **fistulas** (*liú fāng*): Decoct **peach leaves** (*táo yè*) and **peach branches** (*táo zhī*), cleanse and wash the wound, and insert the decoction into the **orifice** (*kǒng*)—this is a highly verified remedy.

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: If the **fistula** (*liú*) affects the **mouth** (*kǒu lǐ*), take **white mulberry root** (*kuàngshù gēn*) from the **eastern journey** (*dōngxíng*), finely grind it, boil in water, and use the clear liquid to **rinse the mouth** (*hán zhī*). Spit repeatedly (*shù tǔ*), but do not swallow.

**Flesh Fistula Remedy** (*ròuliú fāng*): Pound **sophora bark** (*huái bái pí*) into pills (*dǎo wán*), wrap them in **cotton** (*mián*), and insert into the **lower abdomen** (*xiàbù zhōng*). Apply externally—it works.

**Verminous Fistula Remedy** (*shǔliú fāng*): **Andromeda root** (*shínán*), **raw rehmannia root** (*shēng dìhuáng*), **orpiment** (*cíhuáng*), **poria** (*fúlíng*), and **scutellaria root** (*huánglián*), each **two liǎng**. Make into a powder (*wéi sǎn*), and apply to the wound twice daily.

Another remedy: **Alum** (*fánshí*), **three fēn** (分), burn it; **leopard-spotted cat** (*bān māo*), **one fēn**, roast it, remove its **head and feet** (*tóu zú*), pound and mix with **vinegar** (*cù*). Consume **half a chǐ** (匕), and in moments, the **verminous creature** (*liú chóng*) will exit through the **urine** (*xiǎobiàn*).

For **children’s scrotal hernias** (*xiǎo’ér yīn shàn*), when they flare up with **swelling and pain** (*fā shí zhǒng tòng*), follow **Xian Eng’s previous moxibustion method** (*yī xiān’ēng qián jiǔ fǎ*), and **moxibust** (*jiǔ*) the **affected side** (*suí zuǒ yòu*). It will improve.

If the pain is **sharp as a stab** (*suí tòng rú cì*), **moxibust** accordingly (*fāng*).」

For **scrotal hernia** (*yīn shàn*), simply consume the dried juice of **raw *yègān*** (*shēng yègān zhī qǔ xià*), or take it in pill form (*yī kě fú wán yào xià zhī*). **Bo Ge** (*Yáo Yún*) states: **"Walking Horse Decoction"** (*zuò wǒmǎ táng*) is also mentioned in the **Corpus of the Dead** (*shī zhù zhōng*).

When a **scrotal hernia** (*yīn shàn*) suddenly retracts into the abdomen (*yīn huán zú suō rù fù*), causing severe pain as if near death (*jí tòng yù sǐ*), it is called **scrotal hernia**. **Wolfsbane** (*lángdú*) four *liǎng*, **Siler root** (*fángfēng*) two *liǎng*, and **Aconite** (*fùzǐ*) three *liǎng*—burned and made into honey pills (*mì wán*)—should be taken, three pills per dose (*fú sān wán*), the size of **Chinese hackberry seeds** (*tóngzǐ dà*), three times daily (*rì yè sān dù*).

**Bo Ge’s Remedy**: Honey-fried licorice powder (*mì jiān gāncǎo wéi*), applied to the ulcer. For cases where the **penile head swells** (*yīn tóu zhǒng*) and the **ulcer near the neck is near rupture** (*xiàng xià chuāng yù duàn*), apply **pork juice** (*zhū ròu zhī*) after straining (*zhì*). Following **Bo Ge’s method** (*yī Yáo fāng*), the result is miraculously effective (*jiù shén xiào*).

Then, cut **white sophora bark** (*huái bái pí qiē*), make a decoction (*zuò táng*), and wash the ulcer (*yǐ xǐ chuāng*). Pat dry (*shì lìng gān*), apply the paste (*jí qǔ gāo tú shàng*), and finally affix **strychnine leaf** (*qiū yè tiē shàng*)—no more than three applications (*bù guò sān*).

There are **two types of penile ulcers** (*yīn chuāng yǒu èr zhǒng*). The first: **ulcers with pus discharge resembling a mortar** (*zuò jiù nóng chū*), called **penile erosion ulcers** (*yīn shì chuāng*). The second: **ulcers that are simply hot** (*dàn yì zuò chuāng*), called **heat ulcers** (*rè chuāng*). If the ulcer is due to **heat** (*ruò shì rè*), take **one *liǎng* of yellow berberine bark** (*huángbài yī liǎng*) and **one *liǎng* of scutellaria root** (*huángqín yī liǎng*), cut, and make a decoction (*zuò táng*) to wash it (*xǐ zhī*).

If **itching or scratching causes pain and suffocation** (*ruò kǔ yǎng pò zhī tòng mèn*):
Take **fresh pork liver** (*zhūgān*), roast until hot (*zhì rè*), and place inside the genital region (*nèi yīn zhōng*). A **worm** (*chóng*) will soon attach itself to the liver (*dāng yǒu chóng zhuó gān*). Then remove it.

**Prescription for Infant Baldness** (*xiǎo ér tū fāng*):
Take **whitehead root** (*báitóu'éng gēn*), pulverize (*dǎo*), and apply (*fú*) overnight (*yī xiǔ*). Alternatively, it may be applied as a poultice (*zuò wéi chuāng*) for **twenty days** (*èrshí rì*), until cured (*qù*).

*"Chīchī, the house is narrow and cramped—no room for lodgers!"*
The ailment shall depart immediately.

**From the *Injury by Cold* Treatments (Appendix):**
**Maos’ Prescriptions**
For cold tears welling in the eyes, with redness and itching:
Boil **three parts rhubarb (huánglián)**, **two parts canarium (ruìrén)**, and **four parts dried ginger (gānjiāng)** in **one sheng of breastmilk (rǔshì)**, soaking overnight. Simmer gently, reduce to **three ge**, strain, and apply **one grain-sized portion** to the inner canthus.

**For Injured or Ruptured Pupils:**
Apply **two drops of cow bile daily**, shielding from wind.
If the **black pupil is ruptured**, the condition shall improve.

**Additional Prescriptions**

**From the *Fàn Wāng Prescriptions*:**
For cold tears welling in the eyes, unable to open with sharp pain:
Take salt the size of a large soybean, place it in the eye, then blink repeatedly to expel the salt. Rinse the eyes several times with cold water—this shall cure the ailment.

**From the *Bó Jì Prescriptions*:**
For wind-toxin ascending, causing swollen, itchy, and dry eyes with unbearable pain—sometimes with red, ulcerated upper or lower eyelids, or with floating cataracts and encroaching opaque growths—**Divine Wind-Dispelling Powder** is highly effective.
**Fivefold Myrobalan (wǔbèizi)**, 1 liang; **Climbing Honeysuckle Seed (mànjīngzi)**, 1.5 liang. Grind into a powder. For each dose, take 2 qián with 2 bowls of water, simmer in a copper or stone vessel until reduced to 1 bowl. Strain, then apply warm to wash the eyes. Retain the dregs for a second dose, then repeat the decoction and washing. This greatly clears the eyes, relieving dryness and itching.

**From the *Jiǎnyào Jìzhòng*:**
For liver deficiency causing eye pain, persistent cold sensations, and aching sinews—along with photophobia and fear of daylight—**Liver-Nourishing Powder** is prescribed.
**Summer-Thorned Sophora (xiàkūcǎo)**, ½ liang; **Mugwort (xiāngfùzi)**, 1 liang. Grind into a powder. Take 1 qián per dose, mixed with aged tea, without regard to time.

**From the *Shènghuì Prescriptions*:**
For severe eye itching, redness, and dryness, apply **dog bile** into the eyes.
Another prescription: For wind-induced red eyes, take **10 dried Earthworms (dìlóng)**, parched and ground into powder. Before sleep, mix with cold tea and take 2 sháo.

Another prescription: For cold-toxin from injury by cold attacking the eyes, causing white cataracts, use **2 liang of cuttlefish bone (wūzéiyú gǔ)**, excluding the large skin, ground into powder. Add a small amount of **camphor (lóngnáo)**, further refining until fine. Apply three to four times daily, using a small portion each time.

Another prescription: For chronic internal cataracts, grind **Plantain Seed (chēqiánzi)**, **Dried Rehmannia (gāndìhuáng)**, and **Ophiopogon (màimén'dōng)** in equal parts into a powder. Form into honey pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (wútóngzi)**, and take as needed—highly effective.

For eye ailments, **rhubarb (huánglián)** is often used, but **Sheep Liver Pills** are particularly miraculous.
Take **1 large liang of rhubarb powder**, one **white sheep’s liver**, remove the membrane, and grind together in a mortar until extremely fine. Knead with multiple hands into pills the size of **Chinese catalpa seeds (wútóngzi)**. Take seven pills with warm water after each meal, repeating for five doses. This treats all eye diseases, cataracts, and blindness caused by green or blue afflictions. **Avoid pork and cold water.**

Sùyǔxī remarks: There was a man named **Cuī Chéngyuán**, who, while serving in office, pardoned a condemned prisoner. Years later, he fell ill and died by his own hand. One night, suffering from internal cataracts and blindness, as he sat alone sighing in the dead of night, he heard a rustling sound from the veranda. Asked who it was, the voice replied: *"I am the prisoner you once spared—I have come to repay this kindness."* The man then revealed this prescription before passing away. Following its use, his eyesight returned within months.

Thus the prescription was passed down to the world.

Another prescription: the modern physician’s eye-washing decoction.
Take equal parts of **dang gui (Chinese angelica)**, **sháo yào (white peony)**, and **huáng lián (coptis)**, finely ground. Brew with **snow water** or **sweetened water** into a thick infusion, and wash the eyes while hot—if it cools, rewarm and wash again. This greatly benefits the eyes. It treats **wind-toxicity**, **red-eye**, and **flowery cataracts**, all of which it governs.

Its principle states: All eye diseases arise from stagnant blood and vessels, so **blood-moving herbs** are combined with **huáng lián** to treat them. Blood, when heated, flows freely—that is why the wash must be applied while hot. Those who use it will find miraculous results.

Another prescription: for **crow’s-eye disease** (presbyopia), regardless of age.
Take **two liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, pound and sift into a powder. Each dose: **one qián**. At any time, take a fresh **sheep’s liver**, slit open with a bamboo knife, sprinkle the powder inside, bind tightly with hemp string, and boil in **a large bowl of fermented rice water** until done. The patient first inhales the steam, then—once the medicinal vapor has dissipated—ingests the liver. *(From *Jiǎn Yào Jì Zhòng*)* For children’s **crow’s-eye disease**. *(From *Méi Shī Fāng*)* To treat **yellowed, dim vision** where objects are unseen.
Slice **qīng yáng (green sheep’s) liver**, eat with **diluted vinegar**. Boiling it is also effective.

Another prescription: for **eyeballs that suddenly protrude one or two inches**.
Drench the eyes with **freshly drawn water**, changing the water repeatedly, until the eyeballs return on their own.

*(From *Cuī Yuàn Liàng’s Sea-Coast Prescriptions*)* Three names: **Xīguó cǎo (Western Herb)**, **Bìléngqié (Bilva)**, and **fùpénzi (Chinese mulberry)**.
To treat **dim vision**, **cold tears**, **persistent weeping**, **green/blue blindness**, and **epidemic dimness**, take **Xīguó cǎo**, dry it under the sun, pound until thoroughly pulverized, wrap in thin cotton, and soak in **human breast milk** for the duration of an eight- or nine-*lǐ* walk. Apply to the eyes while lying supine—within three or four days, vision will return as in youth. **Avoid alcohol, oil, and wheat flour.**

*(From *Qiān Jīn Fāng*)* To treat **children’s black, cloudy cataracts** with pain and dryness.

*(From *Sūn Zhēn Rén’s Food Taboos*)* To treat **eye cloudiness**.
Take **one dà liáng of máng xiāo (mang Xiao, saline soda)**, place in a copper vessel, and refine over intense heat. Once cooled, sift through fine silk and apply to the **inner eye corners** before sleep each night. This is supremely effective.

Take **mǎ yá xiāo (tooth coral, calcined)**, wrap in thick paper, press firmly, and carry in the breast pocket against the flesh for **one hundred twenty days**. Remove, grind into a powder, mix with a small amount of **long náo (camphor)**, and refine finely. For those with **long-standing eye films** causing dimness and blurred distance vision—even if the pupil remains unbroken—this will cure them.

Each application uses **two mǐ of the powder**, applied to the eyes.

Another prescription: for **internal and external cataracts**.
Take **four liáng of cāng zhú (atractylodes)**, soak in **rice-wash water for seven days**, changing the water daily, then scrape off the blackened skin, slice finely, and fry with **one liáng of qīng yán (green salt)** until yellow. Remove the salt.

*(From *Wài Tái Mì Yào*)* To treat **eye films and protruding flesh**.
Take the **whitest alunite**, place **one grain-sized piece** on the **film or protruding flesh**, and cold tears will flow. Wipe with cotton until the foul discharge is exhausted. The ailment will improve daily, the film will thin, and recovery will follow. **Only the purest alunite may be used.**

Another: **Bǔ Gān Sǎn (Liver-Tonifying Powder)** to treat **thirty-year blindness**.
Collect **jí lí zǐ (spiny cocklebur seeds)** on the **seventh day of the seventh month**, dry in the shade, and pound into a powder. Take **one fāng cùn sháo** after meals with water.

Another: to **cure blindness**.
Take **one pig’s gallbladder**, boil into pill form the size of **glutinous millet grains**, insert into the eyes. After a meal’s time, it is effective.

Another prescription: for **severe cataracts**.

Another prescription: to **lighten the body, tonify qi, and sharpen vision**.

Take **seven fresh xìng rén (apricot kernels)**, remove the skins, chew finely, and—while still warm—wrap the saliva on a cotton swab to apply to the protruding flesh. **Four or five applications** will suffice.

*(From *Yào Xìng Lùn*)* It is said: **Rubbing teeth with salt on an empty stomach**, then spitting into water to wash the eyes, allows **nighttime reading of small text**. This is effective.

**On the Blindness of Gu’s Nurturing Sister**
Gu’s sister, who had lost her sight, was once treated by Gu himself. He refused to wear his cap or eat until he obtained a **viper’s gallbladder**—a remedy for her affliction. Though he searched exhaustively, he found none. A boy then presented him with a single *gē* (合) measure of the substance, which proved to be the very gallbladder. As the boy departed, he transformed into a **green crow** (青乌) and vanished. The sister’s vision was immediately restored.

**General Precautions Against Ferocious Beasts and Poisonous Creatures:**
All wild beasts and venomous creatures are subject to human *qi* restraint. Before entering mountains or grasslands, one must first restrain them. The ritual method states:

*"Upon reaching the mountain’s base, hold your breath for thirty-five breaths. Visualize the divine spirit summoning a tiger to stand before you, then store it within your lungs. A White Emperor emerges, sealing the tiger’s eyes. Your lower *dantian* then expels lung *qi*, and the White Crown ascends above the forest canopy.*

*After a long pause, hold your breath again for thirty-five breaths. With both hands, pinch the tiger’s eyes in three steps—each step taken with the right foot leading. Then halt and recite:*

*'Li Er, Li Er—are you not Li Er? You stole the Yellow Emperor’s hound. The Yellow Emperor commands me to question you: How do you answer?'*

*Then proceed; no tiger in the mountain will be seen.*

*If encountered, stand firm, extend your left hand’s five fingers fully, and leap with all your strength—three upward-downward motions while shouting, ‘#1 *Zhuó!* Tiger, North Dipper Star commands you to depart!’ The tiger will flee. Even when camping, first dig four depressions in the ground as above."*

*Another Method:*
Burn cow or sheep horns—tigers will not dare approach humans.

*Another Method:*
Pound *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *zǐshí* (purple stone), sew into a pouch, and wear it.*

**For Poisonous Wounds from a Horse Biting:**
If a horse bites a person, causing a poisonous wound with intense heat and pain—**Prescription for Severe Heat and Pain (#4):**
Extract blood from a *crown-comb* (rooster’s comb) and drip it onto the wound three times.

*Maopeng agrees.*

**Another Prescription:**
Moxibustion over the wound and swelling—this will improve the condition.
If the wound remains unhealed for a long time:

**Another Prescription:**
Apply menstrual blood from a woman to the wound—this is the most effective.
*Maopeng says:* It is miraculously effective.
If a person already has a wound and rides a horse, and the horse’s sweat or hair enters the wound, or if their body is simply exposed to the *horse’s qi* (馬氣), this will cause swelling, pain, and fever. If the poison enters the abdomen, it will kill them.
Burn the horse’s whip skin, grind into powder, mix with grease, and apply to the wound.
**Another Prescription:**
Drink copious amounts of pure alcohol until heavily intoxicated—this will cure them.

**Another Prescription for Poisoning from a Dead Horse’s Bone:**

Take the dung from the dead horse’s abdomen and apply it—this will improve the condition.

**From *The Minor Formulas* (*Xiǎopǐn Fāng*):**
Apply hot wax directly to the wound, or fumigate with smoke until fluid drains—immediate cure follows.
*This is the urine-soaked wood of a fox, resembling a snake’s nest, beneath which lies fishbone that wounds a person.*

**Additional Prescriptions from *Tújīng*:**
For malignant thorns and fox-urine stings:
Pound *púgōngcǎo* (knotweed) roots and stems to extract the white juice, apply liberally—swelling ceases at once.
*This formula appears in Sun Simiao’s *Thousand-Gold Prescriptions* (*Qīanjīn Fāng*). His preface states:*
*"On the fifteenth night of the fifth month of Zhengguan’s fifth year, my left middle finger accidentally brushed against a courtyard tree. By dawn, unbearable pain set in. For ten days, the pain deepened, the wound swelled and darkened like ripe black beans. I recalled an elder’s remedy and applied it. The pain subsided, the wound healed, and within a decade, I recovered fully. Yang Yan’s *Southern Expedition Formulas* (*Nánxíng Fāng*) also attests to its efficacy."*

**Effective Prescription for Fox-Urine Sting Pain:**
Grind *xìngrén* (apricot kernels) finely, boil one *liǎng* until scalding, then immerse the sting repeatedly in the hot liquid—rapid relief follows.

For horsebites penetrating to the heart:
Consume *mǎchǐxiàn* (horse-hoof herb) in decoction—condition improves.

**From *Língyuán Fāng*:**
For horse sweat entering a wound, causing swelling and worsening pain—treat urgently, or the poison deepens irreparably:
Apply powdered *shēng wūtóu* (raw aconite) to the wound; after some time, yellow fluid will drain—immediate cure follows.

**From *Wángshì Bóji*:**
For injuries from donkey saliva or horse sweat—divinely effective:
Fly *báifán* (aluminum potassium sulfate) and roast *huángdān* (cinnabar) until purple, mix equal parts, and apply as a poultice to the affected area.

Powder *zhōnghuáng* (realgar), *shèxiāng* (musk), and *gānjiāng* (dried ginger) equally, sift, and mix with *shèwǎng* (musk pouch). Load into a small bamboo tube and carry it. In an emergency, apply directly to the wound—equally effective against all venomous snakes.

**Alternative Prescription:**
Crush a black chicken, apply hot to the wound.

*Green snakes, glossy and tree-dwelling, rarely exceed four *chǐ* in length—all called "green-stripe snakes"—their bite is fatal.*

**Ge Shi’s Prescription for Venomous Snakebites:**
Dig a pit immediately, bury the wound, and firmly pack the soil above. The venom drains into the earth; within moments, pain eases, and the victim may be unearthed.

**Xu Wang’s Prescription for Snake Venom:**

**Alternative Prescriptions:**

5. Burn *wúgǔ* (centipede), powder, and apply to the wound.
6. Place a jointless bamboo tube over the wound, melt equal parts *là* (wax) and *mì* (honey), and pour into the tube. If honey is unavailable, use wax alone.
7. Urinate into the wound, then pinch the nose shut for three steps while holding breath. Dig a small pit, pour boiling water onto the soil to form a pill the size of a *wúzi* (Chinese date) seed, swallow it. Seal the wound with a dab of mud—excellent.
8. Powder *guìxīn* (cinnamon bark) and *guāluó* (trichosanthes fruit) equally, pack tightly into a bamboo tube, and carry it. In a snakebite emergency, apply immediately—effective against all venom. *If the tube is not sealed, the qi dissipates and the remedy fails.*

**General Snake Venom Treatment:**
Moxibust the wound three to five times—venom cannot spread.

**Snake Venom:**
Pound *guǐzhēncǎo* (devil’s claw) and apply—pain ceases at once.

**Alternative Prescriptions:**

3. Crush *hékǒu jiāo* (black peppercorns with leaves), apply—pain stops without fail.

**From *Méi Shī Fāng*:**
For snake or viper bites:
Pound *dútóu suàn* (garlic) and *suāncǎo* (sourgrass), apply to the bite.

**From *Guǎnglì Fāng*:**
For snakebites:
Crush *hēidòu yè* (black soybean leaves), apply three times daily—effective.

**From *Guǎngjì Fāng*:**

**From *Bīngbù Shǒují*:**
For snake, lizard, and spider venom:
Gently tap a chicken egg to make a small hole, press it over the bite—immediate relief.

**From *Liú Yǔxī’s Chuánxìn Fāng*:**
For snakebites and scorpion stings:
Burn *dàozǐ tóu* (safflower heads) until red, place *báifán* (aluminum potassium sulfate) on the hot blade. When juice forms, drip it onto the bite—*instant cure.* This method has saved countless lives. In *Zhēnyuán* 32, two monks traveling south to Dengzhou were both bitten by snakes. This remedy saved them instantly—no further suffering.

---
**Prescriptions for Unhealed Snake Wounds and Snakebone Injuries (Section 57):**
**Ge Shi’s Prescriptions:**
For any unhealed snakebite, avoid hot foods—ingestion causes flare-ups. Treat as initially prescribed.

**Snakebite Causing Bleeding from All Orifices:**
Collect *zhūchóng* (horsefly) engorged with cow or horse blood (27 insects), burn, and ingest.

*Above are treatments for severe snakebites, swelling, and deep venomous injuries.*
**Snakebite with Fractured Fang Embedded in Flesh, Causing Unbearable Pain:**

**Ge Shi’s Prescriptions (Continued):**

For a snakebite with a fractured fang embedded in the flesh, causing unbearable pain:
Apply the liver of a toad (*xiāmá*) to the wound—it will emerge immediately.

Another method: First secretly gather *miǎoyīng* (water shield) leaves, pierce them while covering the wound so that no one sees, then place the pierced leaves over the wound’s opening. When the venom reaches the pierced leaves, the fang will break and emerge.

**Prescriptions for Snakebone Injuries and Poisonous Pain:**

For snakebone injuries causing poisonous, unbearable pain:
Take *tiějīng* (iron filings) the size of large soybeans and blow them into the wound with a tube. **Same method as above.**

Another method: Burn a dead rat, grind it into a paste, and apply it to the wound.

For snakebites where the wound has already closed but lingering venom remains in the flesh, causing persistent itching and pain:
Take garlic (1 *shēng* of large and 1 *shēng* of small), mix and grind them, then strain the juice with hot water and pour it into the wound. **Same method as above.**

For cases where a snake coils around a person and refuses to release:
Bathe the person in hot water—this will cause the snake to loosen. Alternatively, make the person urinate upon the snake.

For a snake entering a person’s mouth and not exiting:
Moxibustion (*áijiǔ*) on the snake’s tail will cause it to leave. If no fire is available, cut the snake’s tail in a circular motion until the skin is severed, then pull the skin downward—this will force the snake to exit. **Same as in *Xiǎopǐn*.**

During the seventh and eighth months (July–August), all snakes’ venom is at its peak and should not be expelled. They bite grasses and trees, causing them to wither and die—a condition called *shéchǐ* (snake-withered wood). This substance harms people more severely than snake venom itself; treat it using the same methods as for snakebites.

**Additional Prescriptions:**

From *Guǎnglì Fāng*: For snakebite wounds, wash them with warm *jiǔ* (alcohol) three times daily.

From *Shènghuì Fāng*: For a snake entering the mouth or any of the seven orifices, cut the tail of a sow and let its blood drip into the mouth—the snake will leave.

**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**
**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**

**Prescriptions for Avoiding and Treating All Snakes in Mountainous Regions and General Snake-Related Remedies (Section 58):**
**Method for Warding Off All Snakes:**

As before, following Master Yao’s Daoist method for entering mountainous regions.

Though many remedies exist to repel snakes, *wǔdū xiónghuáng* (realgar from Wudu) is supreme. Carry a piece with you, and if you weigh five *liang* (ounces) on your right arm at the elbow, no snake’s venom will dare approach. If others are bitten, grind it and apply it as a remedy. Also, carrying five *wǔgǔ huáng* (realgar pills) is effective. Since these pills contain *wúgǒng* (centipede), the full prescription appears in *Bèijí* (Emergency Remedies). Below is a prohibition: if one does not observe the ritual, the effect will fail.

Do not cross water after a snakebite—doing so will worsen the pain beyond the initial sting. Before crossing, visualize a giant centipede ahead of you, then proceed. If traveling by boat without performing this ritual, it will be fatal.

When entering mountains, never speak the word *"snake."* Instead, refer to the bitten as *"one struck by a snake."* This caution is all the more important to observe.

**Method to Repel Snakes:**
Burn *yángyáng* (ram) horns wherever you go, letting the smoke rise from the ground—the snakes will depart.

**Additional Prescriptions:**

From *Guǎnglì Fāng*: To treat snakebites where the victim is near death and to repel snakes,
grind equal parts *gānjiāng* (dried ginger) and *xiónghuáng* (realgar), store in a small silk pouch, and tie it on the left arm for men, right for women. The scent of the medicine will repel snakes, and the venom can be applied directly to the wound.

**Prescriptions for Sudden Centipede and Spider Bites (Section 59):**

From *Gě Shì’s Prescriptions*: Cut a rooster’s comb and apply its blood to the wound.

Another method: Seal the wound with salt—it will heal immediately. It is said that if the centipede flees far enough, it will not return.

Another method: Apply hot saltwater compresses.

Another method: Chew *dàsuàn* (garlic) or *xiǎosuàn* (small garlic) or *sāngshù bái zhī* (white sap of the mulberry tree) and apply it.

Also, rub the sole of a hemp sandal on the wound—this is effective.

Though *yúgǒng* (scorpions) bite fiercely, their venom is far lighter than that of bees. The pain is slight and subsides quickly. For spider bites:

Grind *shēng tiě yī* (raw iron armor) with vinegar to make a thick paste and apply it.

Another method: Mix *wūmá yóu* (black sesame oil) with *húfěn* (barite powder) and apply it. Once dry, reapply until recovery.

Apply *yángtáo yè* (wolfberry leaves) to the wound—it will heal instantly.

**Additional Prescriptions for Earthworm, Mole Cricket, Silkworm, and Other Pest Bites:**

From *Méi Shī’s Prescriptions*: For centipede bites where the pain does not cease,
rub the wound with *dútóu suàn* (single-clove garlic).

Another method, from *Jīngyàn Hòu Fāng*: Burn chicken dung, mix with alcohol, and apply it—this is excellent.

Another method: Mix chicken dung with vinegar and apply it.

From *Shènghuì Fāng*: To treat centipede bites,
extract juice from a *wōniú* (land snail) and drip it onto the bite.

From *Bīngbù Shǒují*: To treat spider bites where the entire body breaks out in sores,
drink fine spring wine until intoxicated, then lie still on your back—do not move. The alcohol’s toxicity will force the pests from the flesh, emerging like grains of rice. (Note: Be cautious, as the alcohol’s poison may otherwise harm the body.)

From *Tán Shì Xiǎo’ér Fāng*: Take a stalk of *cōng* (green onion), remove the tip, and pierce a hole at the base. Insert an earthworm into the stalk, pinch both ends tightly to prevent escape, and shake vigorously—it will liquefy. Drip the liquid onto the bite for relief.

From *Liú Yǔxī’s Chuánxìn Fāng*: To treat injuries from venomous creatures,
take one bowl of *dàlán zhī* (great indigo root juice), add *xiónghuáng* (realgar) and *shèxiāng* (musk), grinding them finely. Stir into the juice and apply to the bite. If the venom is severe, also ingest a small amount of the liquid—its efficacy is miraculous.

In the past, *Zhāng Yuánwài* served as a judge under *Zhāng Yánshǎng* in Sichuan. Suddenly, a striped spider bit his neck. By the next morning, two red marks, as thin as chopsticks, circled his neck from chest to heart meridian. By the second night, his face and head swelled to the size of several bowls, his abdomen followed, and he nearly perished. *Zhāng Xiàng* (the official) valued his recommendation highly and, in gratitude, donated five hundred thousand (cash) from his personal wealth, along with additional family funds numbering hundreds of thousands more, to seek a cure.

Suddenly, a man stepped forward and declared, *"I can cure him."* Zhang Xiang initially doubted him but, wishing to test his method, ordered him to prepare the medicine on the spot. The man replied, *"I care nothing for the formula—what matters is saving this man’s life."* He then took a porcelain bowl of *dàlán* (great indigo) juice, dropped a spider into it, and after a long while, it emerged from the liquid in great distress, barely able to move. He then crushed more *dàlán* juice, added powdered musk, and placed another spider into it—this one died upon immersion. Finally, he took fresh *dàlán* juice, musk, and added *xiónghuáng* (realgar), then dropped yet another spider into the mixture, where it dissolved into water.

Zhang Xiang and the others were astonished. They applied the liquid to the bite, and within two days, the swelling completely subsided—though a small sore remained at the wound. Once the scab fell off, the skin healed as before.

**From *Jīngyàn Fāng* (Experiential Prescriptions):**
To treat spider bites causing itchy threads across the body—drink one *shēng* (升) of sheep’s milk.

In the *Zhēnyuán* decade of the 10th year (794 CE), *Cuī Yuànwài* reported from *Zhì* (modern Sichuan): *"I witnessed a man bitten by a spider, his abdomen swelling like that of a pregnant woman. His family abandoned him, and he begged for food along the road. A monk encountered him and instructed him to drink sheep’s milk. Within days, he recovered."*

**Another Prescription:**
To treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites—immerse the body in a concentrated salt bath several times; this will alleviate the condition.

Zhang Shào, a military officer from *Zhèxī* (modern Zhejiang), was bitten by such a creature. Its form was vast as a *fēng* (wind demon), causing his eyebrows and beard to fall out. Each night, the earthworms would writhe within his body, emitting sounds. A monk taught him this remedy, and he recovered.

**Another Prescription:**
To treat *qiūyǐn* (earthworm) bites, where the victim’s form swells like a *fēng* (wind demon) and their eyebrows and beard fall out—immerse the body in lime water; this is also effective.

**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**
To treat *gūnyǐ* (mole cricket) bites—apply chicken dung to the wound.

**Another Prescription:**
To treat *lónggū* (mole cricket) bites—mix lime with vinegar and apply it.

**From *Guǎnglì Fāng* (Expanded Benefit Prescriptions):**
To treat silkworm bites—grind musk finely, mix with honey, and apply; this will cure it.

**From *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**
To treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores—burn *liàn* (melia) tree bark and skin into ash, mix with pig fat, and apply. Alternatively, pound fermented soybeans and apply them. Or mix vinegar with powder and apply. Another method: to treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, where the victim develops sores at the point of contact, resembling clusters of millet grains, causing intense pain—if they cluster, the pain spreads like needles beneath the skin, as if stung by a venomous insect, forming small sores in groups like *zhūyú* (Chinese date) seeds, with red edges and white pus at the center. The skin tightens, the body shivers with cold, and a fever rises. In severe cases, the sores merge, spreading across the waist, ribs, and chest.

**Treatment:** Upon first contact, grind rhinoceros horn and apply it to stop the spread.

**From *Bówù Zhì* (Compendium of Curiosities):**
To treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine marks, which also cause sores where they touch—apply *jīchángcǎo* (chicken gizzard herb) juice; this is effective.

**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**
To treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which encircle the body and may be fatal—mix swallow’s nest soil with pig fat and sour wine, then apply. Another method: burn deer antlers into powder, mix with sour wine, and apply.

**Money Minister’s Prescription:**
To treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores with yellowish discharge—chew pear leaves and apply; renew as it dries.

**From *Shèngjīn Fāng* (Victorious Gold Prescriptions):**
To treat *mòyú* (assassin bug) urine sores, which first resemble scattered millet, then grow as large as beans, eventually swelling like a branded wound, causing extreme pain—immediately apply *cǎotú* (grass tea) or *làchá* (aged tea), mixed with raw oil. The pain ceases instantly; this is miraculous.

**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**
To treat bites from malevolent insects—apply *zǐcǎo* (purple grass) oil. Alternatively, mix ghee with salt and apply.

**Prescriptions for Sudden *bì* (wasps) Stings (60):**
Apply *Yùhú Wán* (Jade Bottle Pills) or *Wǔgū Wán* (Five Armor Pills) to the sting site; these are found in *Bèijí Wán Sǎn Fāng* (Emergency Pill and Powder Prescriptions). Another method: take soil from beneath eaves, mix with water, and apply.

**Prescriptions for Sudden Bee Stings (61):**
If a bee stings—wash the site with human urine. Alternatively, apply the white sap of *gǔshù* (millet tree) or *sāngshù* (mulberry tree); both are effective. Another method: scrape tooth tartar and apply. Also, crush a spider and apply, or boil bee’s nest in water and apply. Burn cow horn into ash, mix with sour wine, and apply. Or cut open a gourd and rub the juice on it. Another method: chew *qīnghāo* (wormwood) and apply.

**Additional Prescriptions from *Qiānjīn Fāng* (Thousand-Gold Prescriptions):**
To treat bee stings—grind *lùfēngfáng* (bee’s nest) into powder, mix with pig fat, and apply.

**From *Yángshì Sǎnrǔ* (Yang’s Breastfeeding):**
Boil bee’s nest in water for washing; this is also effective.

**From *Wàitái Mìyào* (Essentials of the Imperial Library):**
Pound *bóhé* (mint) and apply; this will cure it.

**From *Shènghuì Fāng* (Sacred Benevolence Prescriptions):**
Apply ghee; this will heal it.

Shen Cúnzhōng’s *Bǐtán* (Talks on Calligraphy and Miscellany) records: *"The recluse Liú Tāng lived in seclusion on Wūshān. Once in Qí (modern Shandong), he saw a large rat bound by spider silk, which a wasp stung, causing it to fall to the ground. Soon, its belly swelled as if ready to burst. Slowly, it entered the grass and gnawed on a taro stalk, breaking it slightly. It then rubbed the broken stalk against its wound. After some time, its belly shrank, and it moved lightly as before. Afterward, if anyone was stung by a wasp, they would pound taro stalk and apply it, and the pain would subside."*

**Prescriptions for Sudden Scorpion Stings (62):**
If a scorpion stings—immerse the site in warm water. Another method: pound *mǎmiáo* (horseweed) and garlic. Or chew dried ginger and apply; this is excellent. Yao’s method: soak the sting in cold water, and the pain will not arise. If the water grows slightly warm, the pain returns—change the water immediately. Another method: soak old cloth in cold water and press it against the sting, changing it several times.

**Newly Effective Prescriptions:**
Take equal parts of *shùkuíhuā* (hibiscus flower), *shíliúhuā* (pomegranate flower), and *àixīn* (mugwort core), all harvested on the fifth day of the fifth month at noon, dried in the shade, ground together, and mixed with water to apply to the sting—this will instantly alleviate the pain. If these two flowers are unavailable, use *guǐzhēncǎo* (devil’s needle), pound its juice, and apply; this will cure it immediately. Another method: apply yellow cinnabar mixed with vinegar.

**Treatment for Scorpion Stings (Continued)**

Again, powder fresh *wūtóu* (aconite) and apply with saliva.
Chew dried ginger and spread it on.

Another method: seal with *shèwàng* (a type of adhesive), then soak with warm wine—it will heal immediately.

**Supplementary Prescriptions:**
Sun Zhēnrén’s *Food Taboos*: Treats scorpion stings.
Take one *liǎng* (20g) of alum (*fánshí*) and half a *shēng* (180ml) of vinegar, decocting them. Add alum powder to the vinegar and apply to the sting.

Another, from *Victorious Gold Prescriptions*: A small amount of aconite powder, mixed with head vinegar and applied.

Another, from *Money Minister’s Pocket Prescriptions*: Take *bànxià* (pinellia), grind with water, and apply—pain stops immediately.

Another, from *Food Physician’s Mirror*: Grind *fūzi* (processed aconite) with vinegar and apply.

Another, from *Empirical Prescriptions*: Apply donkey ear wax—it will cure.

Transmitted by Cui Jìshì.

From *Broad Benefit Prescriptions*: Treats scorpion stings where pain does not cease.
Apply the white sap of *chǔshù* (paper mulberry)—it will cure immediately.

**Treatment for Internal Hex Poison (Section 63)**

**Ge’s Prescription:** Cures hex-induced bleeding.
Take three *cùn* (9cm) of *jīyángpí* (goat or sheep skin, or even rotten drumskin), two *liǎng* (40g) each of *lǚlùyè* (lotus leaf), *kǔshēncāo* (soverign vine), *huánglián* (coptis), and *dāngguī* (angelica), seven *shēng* (1.2L) of water, decoct to two *shēng*, and divide into three doses.
One variation adds three *liǎng* each of *xījiǎo* (rhinoceros horn) and *shēngmá* (cimicifuga). If *lǚlùgēn* (lotus root) is unavailable, substitute four *liǎng* of *qiàn* (madder root)—this is superior.

**Diagnosing Hex Poison:**
If someone raises hex creatures to harm others, the symptoms are:
Internal hex causes sharp abdominal pain, as if something is gnawing, or vomiting blood. If untreated, it will consume the five *zàng* (viscera)—death follows.
To distinguish true hex from false: Have the patient spit into water. If the saliva sinks, it is hex; if it floats, it is not.

*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*

**Revealing the Hex Practitioner’s Name:**
Take a small piece of drumskin, burn it to ash, and give it to the patient to drink. The patient will soon call out the hex practitioner’s name. If they speak, the illness will leave.

Sometimes, snakes and centipedes combine to create hex poison in food, causing *jū* (abdominal masses). This type kills over years—each requires separate treatment.

Another method: Place *lǚlùyè* (lotus leaf) secretly under the patient’s outer mat. The patient will call out the hex practitioner’s name.

**Treating Internal Hex Poison with Vomiting or Bleeding:**
All follow the *Lán Gān* (Rotten Liver) Prescription.
Take three *liǎng* each of *qiàn* (madder root) and *lǚlùgēn* (lotus root), finely chopped, decoct with four *shēng* (720ml) of water to two *shēng*, strain, and serve warm in one dose—it will cure immediately.
The patient will also call out the hex practitioner’s name.
*—From Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*

**Another Prescription:**
Take one *bādòu* (croton seed), remove its husk, roast, and mix with three *dòu* (soybeans) and a square-inch of ink from the bottom of a pot. Form into three pills. One pill will purge the poison; if ineffective, take another—it will act.

**Another Prescription:**
Take one *shāng* (30ml) of *kuì* (alkali solution) and mix with pure *kǔjiǔ* (strong liquor). One dose will induce vomiting—it will cure.
*—Same as Small Brand.*

**Zhī’s Prescription:**
Decoct one *shēng* (180ml) of *kǔjiǔ* until dissolved, then serve—divinely effective.

**Another Prescription:**
Take fourteen *qiūyǐn* (earthworms), soak in three *shēng* (540ml) of *kǔjiǔ*. When the worms die, drink only the liquid. Even the dead can be revived.

**Another Prescription:**
Take one *kǔhuā* (bitter gourd), decoct with two *shēng* (360ml) of water to one *shēng*, and serve. It will induce vomiting immediately—it will cure.
*—Same as Small Brand.*

**Zhī’s Prescription:**
Decoct one *shēng* of *kǔjiǔ* until dissolved, then serve—divinely verified.

**Another Prescription:**
Take three *zàojiá* (soapberry pods), roast, remove the seeds, and soak in five *shēng* (900ml) of wine overnight. Strain and divide into three doses.
*—Same as Small Brand.*

**Treating Hex Poison in Drink:**
Causes abdominal rigidity, facial greenish-yellow hue, and exposed bones from *línlù* (urinary dysfunction). Symptoms vary unpredictably.
Take *tiějīng* (iron filings), pound into powder, sift finely. Separately, pound *wūjīgān* (black chicken liver) and mix. Form into pills the size of *wúzǐ* (schisandra berries). Take three pills; severe cases may require up to ten days, mild cases will cure immediately.

**Alternative Iron Filings Prescription:**
Take one *jīgān* (pig liver) and one *shēng* (180ml) of honey, decoct until done, divide into twenty doses—secret prescription.
*—Same as Small Brand.*

Zhī’s variation: Can also be made into pills.

**Another Prescription:**
Take the pith of *zǎomù* (jujube wood), grind to one *hú* (5L), place in a pot with three *cùn* (9cm) of water, decoct to two *dǒu* (20L), strain for clarity, and simmer to five *shēng* (900ml) over low heat. Take one *hé* (10ml) daily on an empty stomach—it will purge hex poison.

*—Same as Small Brand and Yao’s Methods.*

**Another Prescription:**
Take one *liǎng* (20g) each of *xiónghuáng* (realgar), *dānshā* (cinnabar), and *lílú* (hemlock), pound to powder. In the morning, take with *jǐnghuá shuǐ* (dew water) the size of a knife-blade—it will induce vomiting and expel the hex creatures.

**Another Prescription:**
Drink one to two *shēng* (180–360ml) of *yǐnyǐngcǎo* (hidden-scented grass, *Platycladus orientalis* sapling) juice.
*—This grass is *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), commonly eaten.*

**Treating Hex Poison That Has Descended to the Lower Abdomen, Causing Perforation:**
Take one *chánggǔ* (long-legged toad) with a green back, and one *jīgǔ* (chicken bone). Zhī’s method: Burn one part to ash, mix, and insert deeply into the lower abdomen.
*—Same as Small Brand. Zhī’s method is frequently verified; Yao’s method agrees.*

**Another Prescription:**
Drip *zhūdǎn* (pig bile) into the lower abdomen, then pack with cotton deeply inserted.

**Another Prescription:**
*Wǔhuáng Huáng Wán* (Five-Yellow Pill) —the most essential for treating hex.
*—Its formula is in the Urgent Conditions section.*

There is also *natural flying hex*, appearing like ghostly mist—difficult to treat.
These varieties respond best to true *xījī* (rhinoceros horn) and *shèxiāng* (musk). Carrying these on one’s person also prevents hex.

**Yao’s Method for Hex-Induced Bleeding Like Chicken Liver, with Stone Residue, and Five *Zàng* (Visceral) Decay—Only the Heart Remains Intact, or the Nose Breaks:**
**Prescription for the Dying:**
Powder *zhègēng* (orange-hued *Platycladus*), serve with wine, one *sháo* (10ml) twice daily.
*—Ge’s Prescription.*

Zhī’s Imperial Physicians have transmitted over ten verified prescriptions.
Take *mǎdōulíng* (Aristolochia) root, pound to powder, serve with water, one square-inch dose. Follow vomiting to expel the poison—extremely effective.

This substance resembles the shoots of *kèmiàn* (Pueraria), grows along fences, and bears fruit like a tangerine. **For those already afflicted by hex:**

If one fears having been struck by hex and wishes to take **licorice juice** (*gāncǎo zhī*), it should be **freshly prepared and ingested**, which will induce vomiting and expel the illness.

**For those who habitually take it to prevent hex poisoning,** it should be **roasted and ingested**—once taken internally, it neutralizes the poison without causing vomiting, and the effect is miraculously verified.

**Another prescription:** Roast licorice and swallow the juice in each dose. If hex poisoning from food induces reverse toxicity, it will cause spontaneous vomiting, and the effect is extremely beneficial. **Constantly swallowing the juice** ensures that water will not be contaminated by either medicine or hex poison.

**Additionally, there is the Universal Poison-Dispelling Powder** (*Jiěbǎidú sǎn*), listed in the later *Yàodú* (Medicinal Poisons) section, which also serves as a remedy. **Serve one *hé* (100ml) of mulberry bark juice** (*sāngbáizhī*), and within moments, vomiting and purging will occur, expelling the hex.

**Chairman Shi’s Imperial Physicians** have transmitted over ten verified prescriptions, including these two, both of which have been tested and proven miraculously effective.

**Prescription with Spotted Cat Insects (*bānmāochóng*):**
Take four **spotted cat insects** (*bānmāochóng*), remove their legs and wings, and roast them. **Use peach bark** (*táopí*) collected on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, remove the black outer layer, and dry it in shade. **Take *dàjí* (Canthium)**—these three ingredients are pounded separately and then sifted. Mix **one part spotted cat insect** (*bānmāochóng*), **two parts peach bark** (*táopí*), and **two parts *dàjí* (Canthium)** into pills the size of jujube kernels, and take them with **clear rice wine** (*mǐ qīngyǐn*). Upon completion, the hex will be expelled through vomiting. If one dose does not work, repeat after ten days, and the condition will improve. **This hex is most prevalent in Hongzhou**—an elderly woman cured one person and received twenty bolts of silk (*jiān*) as payment; her secret prescription could not be passed down, and her descendants faced legal punishment. **Yellow Flower Public** (*Huánghuā Gōngruò*) served as the **Prefect of Military Affairs** (*Dūdú*), and thus the method spread, but the elderly woman no longer received silk. **Shi states:** He has already cured over ten people with this method.

**Another prescription:**
Take **one square-inch dose of goat-sheep skin** (*yīpí*), **four *liǎng* (120g) of lotus root** (*liánhuā gēn*), **two *liǎng* (60g) each of *kǔcān* (Sophora) and **turmeric** (*huánglián*), and **three *liǎng* (90g) each of *dāngguī* (Angelica), **rhinoceros horn** (*xījǐ*), and **gentian** (*shēngmá*). **Simmer these seven ingredients in nine *shēng* (900ml) of water**, reduce to three *shēng* (300ml), and divide into three doses. The hex will be expelled immediately. **Shi states:** He once administered this to a person, who promptly vomited several *shāng* (60ml) of **wasps** (*fēngxiōng*), and the condition improved right away. **This is Yao’s Imperial Physician’s prescription.**

**Supplementary Prescriptions.**

**《Thousand-Gold Prescriptions》 (《Thousand-Gold Wing Prescriptions》):**
To treat **snake-witch poisoning** (*wùdú*), take **one handful of the white bark from the northern shade of *bìngmù* (Betula albosinensis)**), five *cùn* (15 cm) long, simmer in three *shēng* (300 ml) of water until reduced to one *shēng* (100 ml), and take on an empty stomach in divided doses—**the hex will be expelled immediately.**

**Another prescription:**
For **snake-witch poisoning with bleeding**, burn **hedgehog skin** (*wèipí*) into ash, grind finely, and take with water in a **one-square-inch dose** (*fāngcùn bǐ*). **The wasps will be vomited out immediately.**

**《Essentials of External Taiyi’s Prescriptions》 (《External Taiyi’s Secret Essentials》):**
To **urgently treat snake-witch poisoning**, burn **white goose feathers and droppings** into ash, mix with water, and ingest.

**《Yang’s Lactation Treatises》:**
To treat **internal snake-witch poisoning**, take **raw tortoiseshell** (*shēngdàimào*), grind with water into a thick paste, and consume **one bowlful** (*yīzhǎn*). **The condition will resolve itself.**

**《Sacred Benevolent Prescriptions》:**
To treat **children afflicted by snake-witch poisoning with bleeding, near death**, extract **Indigo plant** (*qīnglán*) juice and administer **half a small spoonful** (*bàn hé*) repeatedly.

---

**Prescription for Sudden Snake-Witch Poisoning (from *Diseases of the River Poison*)), No. 64**
**Yao’s Secret Prescription for Snake-Witch Poisoning (中水毒):**
Take **dried duckweed** (*shuìpíng*), ingest with wine in a **one-square-inch dose** (*fāngcùn bǐ*). **The condition will improve immediately.**
**Yao further states:** If **fingers are cold**, this is the condition. If **warmness returns**, it is not. **Mild cases** affect only the fingertips, while **severe cases** may extend to the elbows or knees—**if the cold reaches the elbows or knees, the condition is critical.**

**Snake-witch poisoning** (*shuǐdú*), also called **river poisoning** (*zhòngxī*), or **poisoning from water exposure** (*zhòngshǎdōng*), is known in some regions as **Su-hai** (蘇骇切). It resembles **arrow-witch poisoning** (*shègōng*) but lacks the projectile. **Its diagnostic signs:**
At the onset, the afflicted feel **chill** (*èhán*), with **slight headache** (*tóuzhù téng*), **eye discomfort** (*mùzhù téng*), **restlessness** (*xīnzhōng fán’ào*), **shivering limbs** (*sìzhī zhènzè*), **stiffened joints** (*gǔjié jiānqiáng*), **tense sinews** (*jīnjí*), and **excessive drowsiness** (*dàn yù shuì*). Symptoms worsen in the evening, with **coldness in the hands**. By the third day, **parasites reappear**, and **ulcers form in the intestines**—**painless, itchless, and without cold sensation**, but visible upon inspection. If untreated, **after six or seven days**, **abscesses rupture in the lower abdomen**, **parasites consume the viscera**, and **fever and toxins surge downward uncontrollably**. By the **eighth or ninth day**, even **skilled physicians cannot cure** the patient. **To diagnose urgently**, examine the lower abdomen for ulcers: **if the ulcer is bright red like fresh meat**, it is **yang-type poisoning** (*yángdú*), the most critical. **If the ulcer resembles the scales of a carp** (*lǐyú chǐ*), it is **yin-type poisoning** (*yīndú*), though slightly less severe. **All cases are fatal unless treated within twenty days.**

To **confirm snake-witch poisoning**, prepare **several *shēng* (liters) of warm water**, add **five *cùn* (15 cm) of minced garlic** (□), and **do not let it boil excessively**—**excessive heat weakens its effect**. Strain out the residue, adjust the temperature to **lukewarm**, and use it for **immersion therapy**. If **red patches or rashes appear on the body** and **no other symptoms are present**, treat it as another ailment.

**Prescription for Snake-Witch Poisoning:**
Take **leaves of plum or peach**, crush and extract **three *shēng* (300 ml) of juice**, dilute with a small amount of water, and drink. **Yao states:** For **children who cannot drink**, apply the juice to the **nipples** (*rǔtóu*) and let them ingest it.

**Another prescription:**
For **persistent infestation with snake-witch**, crush **common reed** (*chángsī cǎo*), extract **two *shēng* (200 ml) of juice**, and **soak a cotton swab in the juice**, inserting it into the **anus** (*xiōng*) to **guide the parasites downward**. Repeat **three times daily**—**the condition will improve immediately.**

**Another prescription:**
Extract **Indigo plant** (*lánqīng*) juice, mix with a small amount of water, and **apply thoroughly to the head, face, and body**.

**Another prescription:**
Take **one handful of pear leaves**, crush until soft, mix with **one cup of wine**, and ingest. **The condition will resolve within three days.**

**Another prescription:**
Take **roots of *shèméi cǎo* (snakeberry)**, grind into a fine powder, and ingest. **Alternatively, use the juice as a guide downward** or drink **one to two *shēng* (100–200 ml)**.

**In summer, if one must walk in water or bathe:**
Before entering, **sprinkle a small amount of the powder into the water**. **This wards off the hex without fear.**

**To prevent arrow-witch poisoning:**
Even if **water is stored in containers for bathing**, **sprinkle a small amount of the powder into the water**—**this is highly effective.** **Raising white geese or white ducks is also beneficial**, as is **wearing raw rhinoceros horn** (*shēngxījǐ*).

---

**In the eastern regions, such as the counties of Dongxiang and the surrounding mountains, snake-witch poisoning is rampant.**
**It occurs in spring**, much like **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán*), and is called **river fever** (*xīwēn*). **Not all cases stem from arrow-witch poisoning**, yet **all suffer from dysentery** (*liànlì*). **The symptoms—chill, fever, restlessness, and pain—persist until death.**

**Prescriptions for snake-witch poisoning** resemble those for **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán wēnjí*). **Administer the same single-method treatments.**
**Powdered *wǔjiā* (Acaanthopanax) root**, taken with **wine or fermented water** (*jiāngshuǐ*).

**Mulberry leaf juice** (*jīngyè zhī*) is also effective.
**These prescriptions are not publicly shared; keep them secret.**

**Another prescription:**
Extract **juice of *liáocǎo* (a type of rush)**, drink **one to two small spoonfuls** (*yī èr hé*), and **apply it thoroughly to the body**.

Take **one handful of *niúxī* (Achyranthes bidentata) stems**, steep in **one cup of water and wine combined**, strain, and drink the juice **three times daily**. **Use the male *niúxī* (雄牛膝), whose stems are purple.**

**If ulcers form in the lower abdomen and have already ruptured:**
Take **one *shēng* (100g) of *jùmǐ* (millet) and **five *shēng* (500g) of salt**, boil in **one *dàn* (10 liters) of water** into a gruel, and **sit in it**—**the condition will improve immediately.**

**Another prescription:**
Take **peach leaves and bark**, crush until soft, steep in water until concentrated, strain, and **sit in the liquid**—**parasites will emerge.**

**Another prescription:**
Burn **soapberry pods** (*zàojiá*) into ash, wrap in cotton, and **insert to guide the parasites out**—**this is also effective.**

Take **one-square-inch dose of *mǔdān* (Peony)**, ingest **three times daily.**

**Prescription for Sudden Arrow-Witch Poisoning (No. 65):**
In the **southern Jiangnan region**, there exists a **poisonous arrow-witch parasite** (*shègōng dúchóng*), also called **short fox** (*duǎnhú*) or **moth** (*é*). It lurks in **mountain streams and water**, and **when people walk or bathe**, this parasite **uses its cross-shaped bony mouthpiece** (*hénɡgǔ jiǎo shè*) to **fire arrows into their shadows**, causing illness. **Its diagnostic signs:**
At the onset, symptoms may resemble **damp-heat disorders** (*shānghán*), **poisonous affliction** (*zhòng’è*), **loss of speech**, **chill and fever**, **stiffened limbs** (*sìzhī jūjí*), with **symptoms worsening by evening**. In **severe cases**, by the **third day**, **blood appears between the teeth**, and **if untreated, death follows immediately.**

**There are four types of infestation:**
Upon inspection, **one type appears as black spots like ink encircled by four edges** (囗囗囗), **resembling needle pricks**. **Another type forms ulcers**, which **persist and eventually perforate**. **A third type rises like a stone** (囗囗囗), and **the fourth type burns like fire**, causing **blistering skin and ulcers**—**this is the most critical**, and **all types are fatal**.

**The parasite thrives in regions where** (囗囗囗).
**During heavy rains or when people are driven by floods**, it **invades homes and shoots arrows at residents**. **It also preys on geese and ducks** (囗囗). **Raising white geese or white ducks can ward it off**, as can **wearing raw rhinoceros horn** (*shēngxījǐ*).

「If one observes these four types of sores on the body, **immediate treatment is essential**.

**For the first method**, encircle the sore thoroughly, **at a distance of one inch from its edge**, then cauterize (*jiǎ*) the area around it **a hundred times** (*bǎi zhàng*). The sore itself should also be cauterized **a hundred times**—this will cure the ailment.

**Another remedy**: crush and squeeze the stems and leaves of *red amaranth* (*chìxiāng*), **extract its juice for drinking**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. Maoyun states: **"Administer seven *hè* measures, four or five times daily."**

**Yet another remedy**: use *garlic chives* (*húsuàn*), **apply them warm to the sore**, and **moxibustion over the garlic chives a thousand times** (*qiān zhàng*)—this will cure it.

**Another remedy**: take **two white excrement pellets of a rooster** (*bái jīshǐ*), **mix them with honey** (*xiǎo táng*), and **apply the paste to the sore**.

**Another remedy**: combine **seven *hè* measures each of *woodlice* (*shǔfú chóng*) and *fermented broad beans* (*zhǐ*), three *bā* measures of *croton seeds* (*bādòu*), **with the heart removed**, and **melted with pig fat** (*zhūzhī*). **Apply this medicine directly to the sore**—this will cure it.

**Another remedy**: take **one *mǔ* parasite** (*mǔ chóng*)—**a black, bean-sized creature floating and moving on water**—**place it in the mouth**, and the ailment will subside.

**Another remedy**: take **one *zhàojiá* pod** (*zhàojiá*), **preferably two *chǐ* long**, **pound it into pieces**, and **simmer with bitter wine** (*kǔjiǔ*) until it thickens like syrup (*yí*). **Remove the dregs** (*qùzhì*) and **apply it to the painful area**—this will cure it.

**Another remedy**: pound *toothache amaranth* (*mǎchǐxiāng*), **drink its juice in two *shēng* measures**, and **apply the residue to the sore**. **Repeat four or five times daily**—this is highly effective.

**Another remedy**: take **two *liǎng* measures each of *ascending heartvine* (*shēngmá*) and *black bindweed* (*wūxī*), boil with **three *shēng* measures of water**, **reduce to one *shēng* measure**, and **consume it all**. **Apply the residue to the sore**; if no improvement, repeat. **Maoyun’s variation**: add **two *liǎng* measures of rhinoceros horn** (*xījǐ*).

**It states that this parasite** (*sandòu*) **shoots sand at a person’s shadow**, causing illness. **If one wishes to cross water**, first **cast a stone into it**; from the edges, **it fires arrows** (*yùshè*)—**its jaws can flex and extend like a crossbow** (*kǒuxiān*). In winter, **it lies dormant**. **Some have a long horn protruding before the mouth**; when the crossbow’s nock (*nǔyǎn*) aligns with the tip of this horn, **it bends like a raised crossbow**, using **its *qi* as an arrow**, and **propelled by water force**, it strikes people. **If struck**, the person **loses speech**, **and the rest of the symptoms resemble those described by Ge**.

**Remedies for sudden sand-flea poisoning (66th method)**:
Sand-fleas (*shāpí*) are **common in mountainous streams and rivers**; they are **extremely fine and nearly invisible**. When people **enter the water for bathing or washing**, these parasites **attach to the body while submerged**. On **rainy, overcast days**, they also **cling to people in grass**, then **burrow into the skin**.

**Diagnostic signs**:
**Initially**, the skin **turns bright red**, with **sores resembling small beans, millet grains, or foxtail millet seeds**. **When rubbed**, the reddened area **hurts like a needle prick**. After **three days**, the patient **feels stiff in every joint**, with **pain, cold, heat, and sores developing on the reddened skin**. The parasite **gradually penetrates to the bone**, **leading to death**.

**Preventive measures**:
After bathing in mountain streams, **dry the body with cloth several times**, then **wipe once with an old piece of silk** (*gǔbó*), and **apply powder** (*fěn*) to it.

**Another remedy for sand-flea poisoning**:
Take **ten slices of raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*), **place them in hot ashes**, and **warm them until hot**. **Cut the garlic and press the hot slices onto the sore**, using all ten slices. Then **apply moxibustion to the sore**, **seven times** (*qī zhàng*)—this is highly effective.

**Another remedy**:
Take **two *mù* measures of *leopard-spotted amaranth* (*bān māo*)**, roast one measure into a powder**, and **ingest it**. **Burn the other measure** until the smoke dissipates (*lìng juéyān*), then **apply the powdered residue to the sore**—this will cure it. **It is also effective if transmitted by arrows** (*yúshèwǎng*).

**Another remedy**:
Pound **raw musk** (*shèxiāng*) and **raw garlic** (*dàsuàn*) together, **mix with sheep fat** (*yángzhī*), and **carry it in a small tube** (*xiǎo gǔnzi*) while traveling.

**In the eastern regions**, sand-fleas are **found in all waters**. After bathing, **if tiny, hair-like needle pricks** (*rú máomáo zhēn cì*) are felt, **examine closely**—they will be visible. **Use bamboo leaves to scrape and remove them**. In **Lingnan**, when people **first notice this**, they **scrape with *ma* grass leaves** (*máo yè*) or **tea leaves** (*míngyè*). **Even slight skin damage is beneficial**; afterward, **repeatedly apply bitter gourd juice** (*kǔqùcài zhī*) is also effective.

**For deep infestations**, **use a needle to prick and extract the parasites**, **just like scabies mites** (*jiěchóng*). **Hold them under a light** (*yǐng guāng*) to observe their movement—**if extracted**, **apply moxibustion three or four times** (*sān sì zhàng*), **and the parasites will die, curing the illness**.

**If the patient still feels drowsy** (*hūn hūn*), **it indicates the infestation has gone too deep**. **Follow local customs** (*tǔsú*) for remedies, **rubbing out the parasites** (*bìchū*), and **then bathe with various decoctions** (*tāng yào*). **Use one or two *shēng* measures per bath**; **when all the medicine is exhausted**, **repeat with this method and other supplementary ones** (*zá fěn*).

**Sand-flea poisoning and arrow-strike methods** require **urgent rescue**. Within **seven days**, the patient should recover. **If not**, **flying parasites** (*fēichóng*) **will then devour the person’s internal organs**, leading to death. **Be extremely cautious and do not treat lightly**.

**Remedies for sudden overdose or poisoning-induced agitation (67th method)**:
**If one overdoses on medicine**, feels **agitated and restless** (*fánmèn*), or **is severely poisoned**, leading to **agitation and impending death**, the following remedies apply:

**Scrape a small amount of soil from the eastern wall**, **mix with one or two *shēng* measures of water**, and **drink it**—this is effective.

**Another remedy**: dig a **rectangular pit** (*zuòkàn*) **two *chǐ* square and three *chǐ* deep** beneath the eaves (*wūliù xià*). Pour **seven *shēng* measures of water** into the pit, **stir it with an object** to create a mist (*lìng mò chū*), and **drink one *shēng* measure of the mist**. If the symptoms persist, **repeat the process**.

**Another remedy**: pound *indigo plant* (*lán*), **extract its juice**, and **drink several *shēng* measures**. If no indigo is available, **wash blue silk** (*qīngguàn*) instead, **extract the juice**, and **drink it**—this also works.

**For overdose-induced agitation**:
Drinking **large amounts of fresh *kudzu root* juice** (*shēnggěrēn zhī*) is **highly effective**. If fresh kudzu is unavailable, **grind dried kudzu into powder**, **mix with water**, and **ingest five *hè* measures**. It can also be **boiled and consumed**.

**Another remedy**: swallow **several raw egg yolks** (*jīzǐhuáng*)—this will cure it. If no improvement, **repeat**.

**For overdose from mineral-based medicines**:
Powdered **white duck droppings** (*báiyāshǐ*), **mixed with water and ingested**, will cure it.

**Another remedy**: take **three *liǎng* measures of *rhubarb* (*dàhuáng*), two *liǎng* measures of *mirabilite* (*mángxiāo*), and **five *shēng* measures of fresh *Rehmannia root* juice** (*shēngdìhuáng zhī*), **boil until reduced to three *shēng* measures**, and **divide into three doses**. **Once vomiting occurs**, the illness will subside.

**If one suddenly overdoses and vomits uncontrollably**:
Drinking **one *shēng* measure of newly drawn water** (*xīnjì shuǐ*) will **stop the vomiting**.

**If the overdose involves *croton seeds* (*bādòu*) and diarrhea persists**:
Powder **dried ginger** (*gānjiāng*) and **turmeric** (*huánglián*), **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**—this will cure it.

**Another remedy**: boil **soybean juice** (*dòuzhī*) to **one *shēng* measure**, and **drink it**—this will cure it.

**Supplementary Remedies (from *Wàitái Mìyào*)**:
**For overdose or poisoning-induced agitation and impending death**:
Burn **rhinoceros horn into powder** (*shāoxījǐ mò*), **mix with water**, and **ingest one *fāngcùn* spoonful**.

**Remedies for sudden poisoning from various medicines (68th method)**.

**Remedies for Poisoning by Wild Kochia (*yěgě*) Already Dead**

**First method**: Open the mouth with an object, then take **three chicken eggs** (*jīzǐ*), mix them with saliva, and swallow. In a short while, the wild kochia will be vomited out.

**Another method**: Warm **pork fat** (*zhūzhī*) to **one *shēng* measure**, and drink it.

**Another method**: Take a live duck, cut its head near the mouth, and let its blood drip into the victim’s mouth. If the blood reaches the throat, the person will revive.

**If the mouth cannot be opened**: Take a large bamboo tube (*dàzhúguǎn*), pierce its joints, and insert its head into the victim’s side. Fill the tube with cold water, repeatedly changing the water. In a short while, the mouth will open, and the antidote can be administered.

**For multiple victims**: Apply the bamboo tube to both sides and the navel (*páizhōng*), which is even more effective.

**Another remedy**: Drink **licorice juice** (*gāncǎo zhī*) in large quantities—this is excellent.

**Maopu’s Remedy (for poisoning by various toxins and wild kochia already dead)**:
Mix **fresh urine** (*xīn xiǎobiàn*) with **human feces** (*rénshǐ*), wring out the juice to **one *shēng* measure**, and ingest it all at once. Once it enters the stomach, the person will revive. No other antidote is as effective for resolving all poisons.

**For poisoning by *Datura* (*dān dú*) already dead**:
Powder **three *hé* measures of licorice** (*gāncǎo*), mix with **three *shēng* measures of water**, and drink.

**If the mouth is clenched shut**: Use a bamboo tube (*zhúguǎn*) to forcefully open the mouth and pour the antidote in.

**For poisoning by *arrowhead* (*shèwǎng*) toxin**:
**Indigo juice** (*lán zhī*), **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*), and **dog blood** (*zhūquǎn xuè*)—all can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *wolfberry* (*lángdú*) toxin**:
Use **indigo juice** (*lán zhī*) to resolve it.

**For poisoning by *wolf’s claw* (*lángkuí*) toxin**:
Use **wolf’s claw root juice** (*kuí gēn zhī*) to resolve it.

**For poisoning by *Lappula* (*lí lú*) toxin**:
Use **realgar** (*xiónghuáng*) and **onion juice** (*cōng zhī*)—both can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *Dianthus superbus* (*zhízhú*) toxin**:
Use **gardenia fruit juice** (*zhīzǐ zhī*) to resolve it.

**For poisoning by *croton seeds* (*bādòu*) toxin**:
**Turmeric** (*huánglián*), **small soybean juice** (*xiǎodòu zhī*), **mung bean juice** (*huò zhī*), and **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*)—all can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *realgar* (*xiónghuáng*) toxin**:
Use **stephania root juice** (*fángjǐ zhī*) to resolve it.

**For poisoning by *Sichuan pepper* (*shǔjiāo*) toxin and *centipede* (*wúgōng*) toxin**:
Both toxins can be resolved by **mulberry root juice** (*sāng gēn zhī*) or by boiling **mulberry root** (*sāng gēn*) into juice.

**For poisoning by *alum* (*fán shí*) toxin**:
Use **large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*) to resolve it.

**For poisoning by *datura* (*yánhuā*) toxin**:
Use **saposhnikovia root** (*fángfēng*), **licorice** (*gāncǎo*), and **cinnamon** (*guì*)—all can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *Pinellia* (*bànxià*) toxin**:
Use **fresh ginger juice** (*shēng jiāng zhī*) and **dried ginger** (*gānjiāng*)—both can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *aconite* (*fùzǐ*) and *monkshood* (*wūtóu*) toxins**:
**Large soybean juice** (*dàdòu zhī*) and **polygala root juice** (*yuǎnzhì zhī*)—both can resolve it.

**For poisoning by *apricot seeds* (*xìngrén*) toxin**:
Use **indigo fruit juice** (*lánzǐ zhī*) to resolve it.

**If one has ingested metal and is already dead**:
Take **half a *shēng* measure of chicken feces** (*jīshǐ*), rinse with water to obtain **one *shēng* measure of liquid**, and drink it—**three doses per day**.

**Another method**: Swallow **two *liǎng* measures of mercury** (*shuǐyín*), which will wrap the metal and expel it. For smaller doses, **one *liǎng* measure** is also sufficient.

**Maopu states**: One dose of **one *liǎng* measure**, taken **three times**, while supporting the victim in an upright sitting position, will ensure revival once ingested.

**Another method**: **Duck blood** (*yāxuè*) and **chicken eggs** (*jīzǐ*) can also resolve it.

**The following is a remedy that resolves one type of poison while also addressing many others**:
Take **licorice** (*gāncǎo*), **chew it finely**, boil into a concentrated decoction, and drink the juice in large quantities. Also, eat **raw onions** (*cōng zhōng tì*) in abundance—both are excellent.

**Another method**: Boil **large soybeans** (*dàdòu*), let them overflow, and drink the juice in large quantities. If no large soybeans are available, **fermented soybeans** (*zhǐ*) are also effective.

**Another method**: **Indigo plant** (*lán qīng*) and **indigo fruit** (*lánzǐ*) can also universally resolve all poisons. Keep some stored for constant use.

**Another secret method**: Boil **waterdropwort** (*jìbì*), strain into a concentrated juice, and drink **one to two *shēng* measures**. If none are available, boil and chew the leaves and swallow. It can also be made into a powder and ingested. This remedy is particularly effective among all antidotes.

**Important note**: For all remedies involving boiling antidote juices, **do not drink them hot**. Poisons worsen when exposed to heat; it is best to drink them **slightly cooled**.

**Note from the Prefect of Lingnan (Maopu)**:
The **Lingnan aborigines** (*lǐrén*) often poison people through food. Victims may not immediately notice, but gradually lose their ability to eat. Some may experience **a bloated heart** (*xīn zhòng*), **tightness and suffocation in the back** (*bèi jí mèn*), or **initial coldness resembling malaria** (*chán*). If symptoms are detected early, quickly take a **piece of white silver** (*bái yín*) and hold it in the mouth. After **one night**, if the silver changes color—**green** (*qīngsè*) indicates **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*), **yellow or red** (*huángchì*) indicates **datura poisoning** (*yánhuā*). If the poisoning progresses further, the eyes may turn **green** (*qīng*) or **yellow/red** (*huángchì*), with **green** (*qīng*) still indicating **indigo poisoning** (*lán yào*) and **yellow/red** (*huángchì*) indicating **mold toxin poisoning** (*jùn yào*).

The aborigines have their own healers, who fear discovery and often **pretend to use three hundred *liǎng* measures of "cowhead" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*) or **claim three hundred *liǎng* measures of "silver" antidote** (*yín yào*). The local leaders, through prolonged acquaintance, know these antidotes are commonly used, though the aborigines do not recognize the *Bencao* (classical pharmacopeia), so they fabricate these names. Their methods are as follows:

**Initial Remedy (for aboriginal poisoning and to stabilize the patient)**:
**Four *liǎng* measures of fresh ginger** (*shēng jiāng*), **three *liǎng* measures of licorice** (*gāncǎo*), toasted (*zhì*), cut, and decocted with **six *shēng* measures of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses** and administer. Once the doses are complete, then search for the specific antidote to treat the poison.

**Antidote Method**:
**Four *liǎng* measures of *dichroa root* (*chángshān*)**, cut, and **four *qián* measures of white salt** (*bái yán*), decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** (*yī dǒu shuǐ*). Soak overnight, preferably on the **last day of the lunar month** (*yuè jìn rì*), or at **five o’clock on the first day of the month** (*yuè yī rì wǔ gèng*). Use an **earthenware pot** (*tǔ fǔ*), boil, and ensure **no slaves, dogs, or chickens** (*núpó jīquǎn*) witness the process. Reduce to **two *shēng* measures**, and **administer two doses in the morning** (*dàn fēn èr fú*). After ingestion, the patient will vomit shortly. Store the vomit in a **copper vessel** (*tóng qì*). If the vomit remains **green** (*qīngsè*) and does not break when held aloft with a stick for **five *chǐ* measures**, the poison remains. After **two days**, administer another dose.

**Prefect Maopu’s Experience**:
Once, after drinking alcohol, a patient became poisoned. It took **over a month** before symptoms appeared. The local leader **Liang Fan** (*liáng fán*) prepared **soil-grown *dichroa root* (*tǔ chángshān*)**, calling it a **"three hundred-head cow" antidote** (*sāniǎo yào*). The patient ingested it and recovered. Afterward, for **twenty days**, they must avoid toxic foods. Only **cooked rice** (*zhǔ fàn*) can be consumed. Prefect Maopu has successfully treated **nine such cases** in total.

**Another Method**:
**Ten *liǎng* measures of *yellow vine* (*huáng téng*)**, which is abundant in Lingnan, cut and decocted with **one *dǒu* measure of water** to obtain **two *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the internal poison will dissolve. If the poison is from **stephania-based aboriginal toxins** (*fángjǐ lǐrén yào*), regularly ingesting this vine will naturally prevent the poison from taking effect even if consumed.

**Prefect Maopu states**: Regular ingestion of this vine **promotes urination** (*lì xiǎobiàn*). It has also cured many others.

**Another Method**:
**Ten *liǎng* measures of *Vitex trifolia* (*dōulín téng*)**, also abundant in Lingnan, known to all locals. The aborigines call it **"three hundred *liǎng* measures of silver" antidote** (*sānyín yào*). Its leaves are long and slender, with a **three *chǐ* measure creeping vine**. Cut fresh, decoct with **one *dǒu* measure of water** and **two *shēng* measures of wine** (*jiǔ*), to obtain **three *shēng* measures**. Divide into **three doses**. Once ingested, the poison will be expelled through urination. For **ten days**, avoid toxic foods. If symptoms persist, administer another dose, and recovery will follow.

**Further Remedies:**

**Another Method:**
Four *liǎng* of **dried *Laportea decora* fruit** (*gànlán shí*) and four *liǎng* of **white-flowered vine** (*báihuā téng*), with the finest sourced from **Junzhou**. Avoid gathering wild *Pueraria* (*yěgě*) growing alongside it. Chop finely, decoct with **seven *shēng* of water** and **one *shēng* of wine**, reducing to half. Take on an empty stomach in one dose—brief dizziness is normal.

**Single *Laportea decora* powder**, taken whole, also proves effective.

**For internal toxins:**
Two *liǎng* of **creeping *Vitex trifolia* vine** (*dōulín téng*), three *cùn* long, finely shredded. Steep in **three *shēng* of wine** in a sealed jar, then seal tightly and char the edges with husk-fire until three boilings occur. Once cooled, consume warm, ensuring the wine retains its hue. No dietary restrictions apply—results are profound.

If forced to eat aboriginal food:
First chew and swallow **one *cùn* of roasted licorice root** (*gān cǎo*). If poisoned, vomiting follows—this confirms ingestion. Treat as before.

**Maopu’s Note:** Carry ten licorice slices in a pouch as a preventive measure.

**Supplementary Prescriptions:**

**From *Victorious Gold Prescriptions* (*Shèngjīn Fāng*):**
**Universal Antidote.** Grind **copper sulfate** (*dǎnzǐ fán*) into powder, mix with glutinous rice paste into pills the size of a rooster’s egg, coating each with **cinnabar** (*zhūshā*). Store with cinnabar to preserve potency. Dissolve one pill in cold water—immediate recovery follows.

**From *Empirical Prescriptions* (*Jīngyàn Fāng*):**
**For ascending drug poison** (like *Shèngsǎn*). Equal parts **bee’s nest** (*lùfēngfáng*) and licorice, toasted with bran until golden. Remove bran, pulverize. Decoct with **two bowls of water** until reduced to **one bowl (eight *shēng*)**. Drink warm before bed—expels toxins by dawn.

**From *Essentials of the Imperial Library* (*Wàitái Mìyào*):**
**For post-medication collapse**, where the patient seeks cold ground and refuses heat:
Decoct **two *liǎng* of *Acanthopanax* bark** (*wǔjiā pí*) in **four *shēng* of water** to **two and a half *shēng***. Administer when symptoms emerge. If unresolved, repeat.

**Sun Simiao’s Commentary:**
For **aconite** (*wūtóu*) or **croton seed** (*bādòu*) poisoning, licorice alone stabilizes the stomach. Though **soybeans** (*dàdòu*) are said to neutralize all toxins, licorice proves more effective in **licorice-soybean decoction** (*gāndòu tāng*).

**From *Master Mei’s Prescriptions* (*Méi Shī Fāng*):**
**Sichuan pepper** (*chùjiāo*) poisoning causes locked jaws, suffocation, or white froth. Decoct **cinnamon juice** (*guì zhī*) or drink **one to two *shēng* of cold water**, then induce vomiting with **thick fermented soybean paste** (*nóng zhī*).

**From *Holy Benevolence Prescriptions* (*Shènghuì Fāng*):**
**For sulfur poisoning** causing suffocation: Drink **one *hé* of sheep’s blood**—immediate relief.

**Another Method:**
For **arrowhead fish poison** (*shèwǎng*) in meat or **leaked salted meat poison** (*lòupú*), take **half a *qián* of crushed abalone shell** (*bèizǐ*), mixed with water—effective. Same for **fermented wheat poison** (*miàn áo*).

**From *Yu Shi’s Secret-Effective Prescriptions* (*Chū Yú Shì Mìxiào Fāng*):**
**For severe drug poisoning:** Remove skin from **croton seeds** (*bādòu*), avoiding oil extraction. Grind with **sodium sulfate** (*mǎyá xiāo*) in equal parts into a paste. Dissolve **one pea-sized dose** in cold water—recovery follows.

---
**Prescription LXIX: For Food Poisoning**

**Salt Remedy**
For sudden fever, headache, dizziness, sudden abdominal pain, impending cholera, phlegm retention, undigested food, **qi distension with shortness of breath**, prolonged diarrhea with blood or mucus, **accumulations causing vomiting**, weakness, fatigue, **sallow complexion, malaria, or wind disorders**—**administration method**:

Take **high-quality salt**, first **hold a soybean-sized amount in the mouth without swallowing**. Soon, saliva will fill the mouth near the teeth. Then, **use a square-inch spoon** to place salt into the mouth and swallow with saliva at the same time—**otherwise, it may dissolve entirely**.

For **chronic throat ailments** or **long-term use**, take **two to three months**, **first thing in the morning**.

If vomiting occurs or sudden illness strikes, take **three square-inch spoons**; if vomiting persists, **stop until the illness subsides**, then resume. For **newly afflicted malaria**, it will resolve; for **abdominal pain, distension, or vomiting/diarrhea**, it is also effective.

For **chronic illness**, if **internal heat** persists, take it **every three to five days**. Increased dosage **induces vomiting or diarrhea**, but diarrhea is harmless. **Long-term use greatly fortifies the spleen and kidney *qi***—no ailment remains untreated, **only regretting that people do not persist**.

This remedy varies; the *Small Treatise* states:
