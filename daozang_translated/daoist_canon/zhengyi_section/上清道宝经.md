**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Treasured Dao, Volume One**
**Chapter One**

Upon yellow brocade it is laid,
Inscribed in cinnabar gold,
Bordered with purple gold,
Enclosed in a brocade pouch.

From the High Antiquity,
This scripture spans Middle and Lower Antiquity.
Whoever possesses this text shall have:
The Five Thearchs’ defense,
Jade lads and jade maidens—three each—holding the scripture at their sides,
The Nine Stars’ dark canopy,
And the assembly of perfected immortals, the Five Marchmounts’ numinous officials, attending the chamber day and night.

**The Celestial August Inner Writ**
May be used to guard the household.

**The Three Augusts’ Vermilion Writs in Five Chapters**
Refined in the Cavern-Yang Lodge,
Presented in the Flowing Fire Court,
They give rise to Heaven and establish Earth,
Awakening the numinous spirits.

Should the Son of Heaven obtain them, phoenixes shall come in homage, and the Five Stars align in harmony.
Should feudal lords obtain them, the constellations shall contain their radiance.
Should kings, nobles, or common folk obtain them, their jade-like essence shall ring clear.
Should women obtain them, their countenance shall glow like the Great Sun, their complexion flowing with the Three Lights—fit for empresses and queens.
They soar into the clouds,
The true writs.

**The Jade-Inscribed Writs**
Emerge from the Nine Profound and Nine Heavens,
Dividing governance into Three Dao.
When the Celestial Origin employs these writs,
The Three Luminaries scatter their veils,
The Five Thearchs fall from their stations,
The Nine Revolutions overturn,
The Seven Lodges flee their essences.
When the Terrestrial Origin employs these writs,
The Nine Lands sink into ruin,
The Five Peaks collapse,
Mountains and rivers invert their courses.

**The Three Origins’ Method**
Encompasses the numinous chapters of *The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Scrolls*.
These are the secret signs of the Three and Five,
The utmost essence of the true Dao,
The supreme chapters of the Three Ones,
The forbidden records of Jade Purity.

**The Three Marvels’ Chapters**
The Jade Emperor’s precious writs,
Concealed within the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens,
In the Jade Chamber of the Great Profound Numinous Terrace.

**The Three Registers**
The Three Origins’ graded admonitions:
Golden Register, Yellow Register, Jade Register.

**The Three Scriptures**
Received under triple oversight.

**The Three Caverns**
Jade Purity Cavern-Real,
Highest Purity Cavern-Mystery,
Supreme Purity Cavern-Spirit.

**The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern**
The loftiest resonance of Highest Purity,
The subtlest phrases of utmost reality.

**The Numinous Treasure Scriptures**
The supreme rank of transcendent immortals,
The utmost truth of the Void Origin,
The profound treasure of the Great Dao,
The celestial writs of the Three Augusts.
Some call them the *Jade Tablets of the Most High*.

These Three Cavern scriptures and talismans are the warp and weft of the Dao,
The profound lineage of the Great Void,
The foremost scriptures of the highest perfected,
How could they be heard by middling immortals?

**The Cavern-Spirit, named the Dao of Immortal Treasures**
Connects to the era of the Three Augusts.
**The Cavern-Mystery, named the Dao of Numinous Treasures**
Rescues and delivers the age of the Five Thearchs.
**The Cavern-Real, named the Dao of Heavenly Treasures**
Aids the generations after the Three Dynasties.

**The Seven and Ten Divisions**
The wondrous scriptures of the Primordial Beginning,
Composed in the Dragon Han era.

**The Golden Patterns and Jade Writs of the Most High in the Purple Tenuity Palace**
The secret texts of the supreme sages.

**The Vermilion Gold Writs on Azure Jade Tablets**
The *Jade Instructions of the Most High*.
Thirty-six scrolls.
The Ten Division Scriptures are all inscribed in gold characters,
Written upon jade tablets,
Their chapter titles recorded at the Southern Pavilion of Purple Tenuity in the Great Profound Capital of Jade Metropolis.

**The Five Thearchs Receive the Talismans, Guiding the Three Luminaries**
The Five Thearchs hold the talismans,
The myriad mouths of the *Fixed Register*.
The noble one goes all day without seeing—
Even when seeing, nothing is perceived.
Goes all day without hearing—
Even when hearing, nothing is heard.

**The Transformation of the Profound Capital’s Orthodox Unity**
The Perfected of Orthodox Unity expounds *The Thousand Perfected Disciplinary Scriptures*.
The Most High is wordless;
The noble one goes all day without speaking—
Even when speaking, nothing is conveyed.
Those who excel in transmission must grasp its words,
Must grasp its meaning.
The Perfected listen with spirit—
Such listening is venerable.
The Sage teaches with the body—
Such teaching is precious.
The traces of the Sage may vanish, but the Yellow must endure;
You have yet to distinguish this.
Words may lack what is certain, yet what is certain must exist;
You have yet to decide this.

**The Dao has truth and falsehood; fortune has misfortune and good fortune. Offenses have public and private; clarity has fine and subtle distinctions.** The Three Worlds’ immortals—Ji Facheng and others—**observe rank in their dealings, the worthy and foolish overthrow one another, good and evil reveal each other.** There is no "other," no "self"; no going, no coming. **Encompassing the ten thousand kalpas, all empty space—even the numberless stars of the constellations—are as I, since attaining the Dao and becoming immortal, have likewise been.** Empty space cannot be measured by steps, yet one who knows its mileage—so too is my lifespan. **Taking the Dharma as the source—*Dongxuan* and *Shengxuan* are both of this.** The beings of Heaven and Earth **originate entirely from the Dao, the essence and radiance of primordial chaos, the subtlest mystery of the Supreme Profundity.**

**Silent contemplation:** neither empty nor not-empty, neither Dharma nor not-Dharma, neither thing nor not-thing, neither person nor not-person, neither cause nor not-cause, neither effect nor not-effect, neither beginning nor not-beginning, neither end nor not-end. **Lucidly** behold the perfected Primordial True One.

The two halves make one—being and non-being are the two halves, neither being nor non-being is the true and correct Way. Depart from these four halves and return to ascend the non-vacuous. Realizing non-being is not non-being, knowing being is not being, one dwells securely in the city of the Middle Way’s right contemplation. Turning back to my two halves, abiding in spontaneity, the Dao’s work renews daily, thoughts accumulate in benefit, and the Dharma-heart is seen, the heart’s form mutually perceived.

**Drawing the Dao forth:**
A pure breeze sweeps away the dust of worldly cares.

**The Most High again sounds the Heavenly Drum thirty-six times.**
Looking up to heaven, he invokes:
Mountains and rivers, all waters and lands, every hidden spirit,
the demon kings of the Three Realms, the demon kings of the Six Palaces,
kings and princes of states—whoever can receive and uphold this scripture
shall be joined in strength and together treasured and protected.

**Within formless primordial chaos, before the separation of heaven and earth:**
What Heaven repays comes not swiftly yet is swift; what is sought through resonance arrives without movement.

The Golden Portal’s Supreme Sage commanded the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, dispatching the Jade Lad of the Supreme Profundity and the Orthodox Unity, Wang Zhong, Bao Qiu, and others, to present to Mao Ying the four-jointed *Yantai Luminescent Divine Mushroom*, the *Ever-Radiant Flying Night-Glowing Grotto Grass*, bearing seals and wearing robes and caps, all facing north to complete the rite.

The four messengers addressed Ying:
“He who consumes the four-jointed *Hidden Mushroom* of the Great Ultimate shall be ranked as a Perfected Minister;
he who consumes the *Yantai Jade Mushroom* of the Golden Portal shall be ranked as Controller of Destinies;
he who consumes the *Flowing Brilliance Golden Essence* of the Eastern Palace shall be ranked as Controller of Prosperity;
he who consumes the *Ever-Radiant Flying* shall be ranked as Perfected Earl;
he who consumes the *Night-Glowing Grotto Grass* shall be ranked as Master of the Left and Right Censors’ Office.
You have consumed them all—your lifespan shall be as heaven and earth, and your rank shall be Controller of Destinies, Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Peak, Minister of the Upper Court, commanding the immortals of Wu and Yue, and overseeing the mountain sources of Jiangzuo.”

In an instant, the Five Emperors each arrived riding chariots of their directional colors, descending from the Weaving Palace to receive the Great Emperor’s command, appointing Ying as Controller of Destinies and Supreme Perfected Lord of the Eastern Court. The decree was inscribed on purple jade, its text reading:
*“From his youth, Ying roamed the northern mountains with unbound hair, his heart summoning the Supreme Emperor, moved by the Great Profundity to devotion. Now he is appointed Perfected of the Great Profundity, Divine Lord Controller of Destinies. His conduct is firm as metal and stone, his cinnabar heart steadfast among the multitudes—now he is rewarded with the Jade Yue, the Green Banner, and the Eight Might’s staff, to subdue the sources of marshes and vanquish the myriad spirits. He once dwelt in the cold valleys of Eastern Grove—now he is rewarded with the Purple Tassel’s staff, the Lotus-Blossom Crown, to summon a thousand spirits and command clouds upon the mountains. He forsook his home to wander alone—thus he is granted the embroidered feathers, the purple mantle, the cinnabar and azure flying skirts, to ascend the celestial steps at ease, bearing the mandate of the Jade Perfected. He traversed deep thickets—thus he is rewarded with the Spotted Dragon’s chariot, the White Tiger’s plow, to float in revelry through the great void, his flying wheels gracing the imperial court. He endured frost and snow—thus he is granted the Curved Dawn’s precious canopy, the Jasper Curtains, the Crimson Chamber, to roam and gaze upon the Nine Palaces in serene warmth. He concealed his form in secluded peaks, his spirit contemplating the myriad groves—thus he is rewarded with the Divine Flowing Fire Bell, the Twin Pearls of Bright Moon, to ascend and report to the Great Ultimate, to convey his voice to the Supreme Clarity. His true heart is lofty and still—thus he is granted the brocade banner, the embroidered pennant, the white feathered black staff, to summon the Six Yin and the Jade Maidens to attend his carriage. His kindness extends to all things, his hidden virtue governs the myriad beings—thus he is rewarded with the Phoenix’s flute, the golden bell, the jade chime, to harmonize the spirits in the empty halls, to delight the Perfected and dance with the numinous. No being can disrupt his resonance, no thousand evils can enslave his purity—thus he is rewarded with the Purple Essence’s marrow, the Jade Nectar, the Golden Infant, to share the lifespan of the Three Luminaries, to inscribe his name upon the Cinnabar Jade. Ying’s heart shines with the radiance of the sun, his spirit leaps with the great aurora—he has redeemed the longevity of others, thus he is styled ‘Great Profundity.’ With the nine virtues complete, he is now instructed in nine affairs, granted forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens to attend his comings and goings in the Great Reverence, to receive affairs from the Great Ultimate, and to govern the office of the Red City Jade Grotto’s府. His movements and stillness shall be reported.”*

Ying prostrated himself to receive the decree, bowing twice to the Perfected of the Great Profundity.

**The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao**

**Before Heaven and After Heaven:**
One beginning, one end—minor kalpas and great kalpas.

**Merits inscribed on jade tablets:**
Ascension to heaven in broad daylight.

Seeking to overturn the bitter sea,
Ever cause the river of desire to run dry.
The Dao has no form or shape—
It borrows words and images as its ford.

Harmony is the source of all affairs.
True rectitude within rectitude:
Dispelling what is to be dispelled,
Attaining what is to be attained—
Both reliance and relinquishment are forgotten,
The mind vanishes in what it forgets.

Knocking my head at the window of scripture masters,
I beg to unseal the gate of the Double Mystery.
All open the true mark,
All enter the Mystery Gate—
Like the Jade City of the Dark Capital,
Opened through eight gates,
Where people of the eight directions each enter through their gate.

The heavens are vast and boundless,
Myriad paths all return to one.
The Two Exhaustions—
Still the realm of the two deaths:
Within lies the death-realm of the great appointed end,
Without, the death-root of thought-moment after thought-moment.

*The Record of the Supreme Ultimate and the Immortal Duke’s Daily Observances*

Transcending the two death-realms,
Surpassing the three foundations of the Three Clarities—
The Heavenly Elder posed a question.

The dark name is inscribed on the green register and white tally:
The wondrous Dao of yin and yang,
The supreme art of ingestion and adornment—
All are divine formulas and secret instructions.

What you heard before was not yet true seeing;
What you hear now is true hearing.

Above heaven, below heaven.

All attain radiance, the earth becomes lapis lazuli and the seven treasures. Along the roads stand rows of trees, each side identical, and beneath every tree stand jade maidens and immortal youths, holding fragrant flowers in their hands. In the empty void, divine immortals perform myriad forms of music and dance. Within each land resides the Supreme Divine Lord, seated upon a golden couch within a seven-jeweled terrace.

The *Sutra of the Wondrous Dharma Wheel* emerges from boundless eons, vast as the kalpas of the Ganges, its brilliance shining like stars across the cosmos. This sutra is like the moon’s full radiance, illuminating the ten directions; as the three realms lie in darkness, this sutra rises like the sun, universally illuminating all heavens. Like the flow of ten thousand rivers, this sutra is the abyss of the Scorching Valley, the source of the Lü Sea, to which all return; like the height of Mount Sumeru, this sutra is the Jade Capital Mountain, encompassing all.

Above, it governs the Three Luminaries; in the middle, it harmonizes yin and yang; below, it unfolds the myriad lives. Those who cultivate this sutra without weariness will swiftly summon the dragon chariot and ascend in broad daylight.

The *Dao De Jing* speaks of its virtue: like spring, it gives life to the myriad things; like summer, it nurtures and ripens them; like autumn, it brings them to majesty. Its virtue is like the seven treasures, prized by all things; like a bright mirror, reflecting the myriad things; like a great kingdom, lacking nothing; like a mountain, upon which all things depend; like the sea, containing all things; like the moon, casting its light upon all things; like the sun’s rays, illuminating all things. Its virtue is like the earth’s thickness, bearing the myriad things; like heaven’s vastness, covering all. Thus it pervades heaven and earth, giving rise to the four seasons. The upper scripture is heaven, the lower scripture is earth.

The heart is like lapis lazuli—
The Supreme resolves all doubts.
Above, nothing is unilluminated;
Below, nothing is unpenetrated.
Penetration reaches the numinous.

The *Numinous Treasure* spans the great Dharma Bridge,
Revealing the Dao,
Guiding with the Dharma,
To deliver beings from the Three Calamities and Eight Difficulties.
It opens the gates of sweet dew and immortality,
Extending my entry into the Dharma,
Abiding in the chamber of non-action.

The Mind-King
Dwells in the city of the Middle Way,
With Dharma as its sincere teaching,
Forming the walls and moats of the Dharma.

The Three Supreme Dharmas—
The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate, Xu Laile, gathers the assembly.
All the great sages of the heavens convene at Penglai.
Bowing before the Dao,
The Supreme Lord of the Dao sits upon a jeweled lotus,
Flanked by tens of thousands of jade maidens and immortal youths.

The Lord of the Dao wears a nine-colored feathered robe,
A gown of flying frost and floating pearls,
A crown of ten thousand transformations,
A belt with the Morning Sun Sword and the Bell of the Sun.
The dark chant resounds in four directions,
The phoenix’s wings stir with a single stroke,
Dragon patterns gleam in the azure abyss,
Crimson splendor shines upon rivers and marshes,
The pheasant’s celestial form adorns orchid and jade,
Golden essence emerges from secluded valleys.
Riding the Great Compliance to command the supreme image,
Roaming the pure spirit to merge the Five Turbidities,
Emptily emitting the Nine Falls,
Profoundly feasting the Nine Awakenings,
Dancing with shadows to fan the void,
Riding the void to grasp the mist.

Through the cultivation of the Ten Practices,
With all lamps and torches,
Illuminating the darkness of evil,
Journeying toward the royal city.

Amidst the surging clouds of the Great Dharma,
A single chariot of sweet dew descends,
Dharma’s sprouts arise along the Dao’s path.
The One Flavor rains upon the Ten Directions,
The Two-by-Two Dharma Seal
Establishes my Dharma Gate.
The Palace of Undying—
The Southern Pole’s Songling Palace.
The Great Dharma of human-making,
The world’s finest physician.
The Numinous Treasure’s First Gate—
The stairway of virtue and practice.
Enter its gate, and the Dao’s chambers may be fathomed;
Ascend its steps, and merit and achievement grow daily.

From ancient past to present—
The True One’s natural Dao.
Most subtle, most wondrous, most profound, most mysterious,
Neither being nor non-being, neither mortal nor sage,
Wisdom serves as the boat and oar,
Shaking off the Ten Entanglements.
Ascend the ever-abiding shore,
Where celestial wondrous blossoms rain—
The blossoms of the Kānā Forest.
Strike the music of the Heavenly Musicians—
The melodies of Heavenly Hooks.

The Supreme Ultimate and Great Void Perfected One
Addressed the Left Immortal Duke, saying:
"Formerly, I received from the Most High Golden Sun
The True One’s Ascending Mystery Inner Teaching,
The First Gate of the Primary Gate,
Practiced by the Five Thearchs.
This scripture is the parent of all karmic deeds of the Perfected Ones—
The *Hidden Writ of Jade Purity*.

**The Master-Disciple Rank, Second**
Without a master, one does not proceed;
Without a master, one is not born;
Without a master, one is not delivered;
Without a master, one does not ascend as an immortal.
The Eightfold Radiance Dragon Chariot—
Therein one may transcend the Jade Pass of the Supreme Ultimate.
Ascend high, and there is no above;
Delve deep, and there is no limit.
Great sages and great worthies:
First serve a minor master, seeking the minor Dao;
Then serve a middling master, seeking the middling Dao;
Then serve a great master, seeking the great Dao.
Tread the Dao’s path as the plumb line and inked cord,
As law and standard—
Divine Masters, True Masters, Dao Masters,
Immortal Masters, Sage Masters, Worthy Masters.

Beside the master stand the Nine:
First, Great Compassion;
Second, Great Mercy;
Third, Great Joy;
Fourth, Great Renunciation;
Fifth, Great Goodness;
Sixth, Great Dharma;
Seventh, Great Merit;
Eighth, Great Transformation;
Ninth, Great Virtue.

Within a single heaven—
Numbered as the Perfected Immortals and Sages, twenty-seven ranks.
The Three Ones mirror within,
Master and friend smooth the path without—
The Three Primes’ True One.

At the Kunlun’s Mystic Orchard Palace,
Meet the Orthodox Unity Perfected One,
The Three Heavens’ Dharma Master,
The Highest Clarity Perfected One,
The Grand Overseer of All Immortals.

The Longevity Dharma Master,
Who fathered the Three Lords,
Surnamed Bo Cheng, styled Zhi Hao,
Was a man of the Middle August era.
In the year of the Eastern Well’s conjunction,
He was born beneath the cypress groves of Beihai Zhongshan,
Where sweet dew, purple mushrooms, luminous pearls,
And the triple confluence of dragon blossoms
Sprouted at his resting place.
His mother conceived by the white dew’s touch.
At fourteen, he served the Duke of Xigui as minister,
Fearing neither Yi nor Ju,
And studied under Master Huanggu.
Later, he encountered the Jade Purity’s Wenchang,
The Eastern Jade Radiance Immortal Duke,
And was styled the Jade Sovereign.

The Second Dao Lord bestowed the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*.
All ghosts shun the Three Caverns Dharma Master—
Those who receive the Three Caverns Dharma’s transmission,
All ghosts and spirits turn in retreat.

Upon the purple clouds.

Immortals possess nine ranks,
Corresponding to the Nine Perfected.

Ascending to the Great Clarity’s Luminous Might.
Souls perfected, spirits completed,
They become guests in the Purple Court.

The upper immortals ascend to heaven in broad daylight.
The middle immortals govern grotto-chambers in famous mountains,
Innately aligned with the True One.
The Golden Towers and Orchid Terraces bear jade texts and vermilion graphs,
Resonant with the upper immortals.
Transforming in the Southern Palace,
Shedding their bones, transmuting their embryos.

Golden Immortals—
Their hue like golden radiance.
On the Eastern Marchmount and Southern Marchmount,
Three thousand nine hundred leagues across the sea,
To the east dwell ninety thousand immortals,
And twenty-four myriad jade maidens.
The immortals reside in the Yang Offices of Gradation,
Three thousand leagues from Knife-Script Mountain,
Where three million divine dragons dwell,
And immortals ascend to heaven riding them.

Those who cultivate the Dao of the Great One
All attain ascent through the Three Heavens,
Bathe in the Eastern Well,
Master the Three Principles and Six Disciplines,
Adorned in gold and purple, their vermilion seals resplendent,
Transforming without end.
With the divine elixir long refined,
The golden liquor ninefold transmuted—
The method of the Returning Elixir lies in the Golden Book’s *Ren* Scripture.

The Jade Clarity illumines the Mysterious Capital,
Ten Sages revolve through the Purple Tenuity,
Parting clouds to emerge from the Ten Heavens,
Soaring through the sky on flying heavens,
Their cinnabar auroras bearing light canopies,
Sun and moon bathing them in numinous splendor.

*From the Twenty-Four Images of Life*

Wielding sun and moon in their hands,
The Five Penetrations Immortals, Supreme Perfected—
Exhaling and inhaling to refine the Five Spirits,
Illuminating the *Canons of Perfected Clarity*.
Their essence gathered in the Seven Treasures Grove,
Their eyes gleaming with the essence of sun and moon,
The Most High governs the Purple Terrace,
All Perfected chant the Grotto Scriptures.

Riding dragons,
Mounting dragons to tread the dark waves,
Washing their feet in the Eight Heavens’ River—
Thus they loosen the celestial nets and earthly snares,
Having already transcended them.
Preserving their offspring on the flying dark path,
The Five Numinous tally their registers.

The great barges—
A metaphor for the Great Vehicle.
The middle ferries—
Compared to the Middle Vehicle.
The small boats—
Likened to the Lesser Vehicle.
The purple brocade—
Using purple’s abundance to represent the Three Vehicles.

Ten lamps, a thousand lamps—
Their light illumining the ten directions,
Shining upon all heavens.
The Three Flowers—
The name of the Great One’s golden chamber.

Achieving perfection in a single lifetime,

They turn their bodies to ascend the Great Ultimate,
Their rank elevated to Immortal Minister.

Three extinctions, three rebirths,
Their resolve firm and unwavering,
They ascend to the Grand Clarity,
Becoming the Nine Palaces’ Perfected.

The inferior adept—
Loving mountains and delighting in waters,

And the Void Sovereign Dao Lord proclaimed:
“The scripture for delivering life and reversing years is concealed above the Nine Heavens,
Within the Golden Terrace of the Grand Existence,
The Nine-Bend Chamber of the Jade Hall—
A path not traversed by median perfected ones.
This method shares a single root with the nine qi,
Its three luminaries revolving as one wheel.
Cultivate it ten thousand times,
And your rank shall ascend to that of Immortal Minister.”

The Grand Obscurity, the Grand Void, the Grand Origin—
The Primordial Beginning, the Primordial Inception,
The Great Unity, the Great Spirit.
Ascending to heaven, descending to earth,
Operating within the six directions,
Dispersed, they become qi;
Gathered, they form a mouth.
Coming and going without gate,
Exiting and entering without gap,
Arriving without movement,
Responding without call—
Thus is it called the entry of the spirit.

The Jade Casket of the Nine Shades—
From the *Statutes of Illuminating Perfection*.

The Eastern Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine King, Great Sage of Longevity—
The perfected ones of the ten directions all ride flying clouds and cinnabar chariots, green brush in hand,
Myriad millions of mounted riders arriving upon the void.

In the Fragrant Grove Garden—
For the enlightened youths, the mind of all methods is at ease,

The Supreme August Master, Purple Dawn Lord—
Descended from the twin radiance, essence of the conjoined dawn,
Nurturing dragon mists in the great void,
Passing through the Purple Emptiness to commune with spirits,
Entrusted to the Nine Mysteries to contain luminous splendor,
Congealing vast numen to become divine,
Refining the Three Qi to purify himself,
Studying under the Mystic Mother to attain dharma-life.
Abiding through kalpas to receive transformation,
Responding to the auspicious solar day to bathe—
In the first year of the Supreme August era,
Heavenly Jia inaugurated the dawn,
Born in the Central City of the Eight Yangs of Divine Continent,
Upon the shores of the Cavernous Abyss.
His face emanated golden countenance,
His body reflected jade radiance,
Five-colored purple patterns,
Seventy-two transformations,
His essence illumined his jade visage.
Divine dragons disgorged mushrooms to anoint him,
Simurghs and phoenixes spread their wings to shade the mystic.
The Twin Effulgences paused their brilliance in the Eight Clarities,
The Seven Origins returned their essence to the Encompassing Dawn.
Golden immortals scattered incense to blend qi,
Divine consorts cast flowers to emit mist.

The Three Ways merged their light.
Flowing rosy clouds exhaled majesty,
His transcendent chariot soared through the Nine Mysteries.

Thrice he paid homage at the Purple Court,
Roaming and gazing upon the jasper towers,
Seeking the effulgence of the Three Origins.
Escorting the Five Elders,
He became an honored guest of the Jade Empyrean.

Jade maidens trod the void to guard him.

*The Jade Characters of the Golden Tablets of the Grand Tenuity*—
Concealing the Three Lights, the sun sinks beneath the earth.

Those who achieve liberation through simulated death—
A lesser path of transcendence.
*The Flying Immortal’s Precious Sword of the Great Ultimate Perfected*—
Their names inscribed on the Purple Tablets,
The Three Offices unobstructed—this is called "liberation through the door."

Those of utmost loyalty and filial piety—
Receive the teachings of the Lesser Transcendents.

Those of utmost integrity and chastity—
Upon their passing, after two hundred and eighty years, they ascend one rank,
Filling the offices of the Immortal Bureaucracy.

Virtue is the origin of the ten thousand things—
A decree from Lord Lao.

The Four Virtues—
The gateway to practicing the Dao, the canon of attaining the Way.

Kings, marquises, and the highly noble—
With gold and treasures, they receive the true scriptures,
Copying and wearing the sacred texts.

The ancients achieved transcendence not through the heart alone;
In the degenerate age, one cannot cross over without wealth.
Ten thousand catties of gold, a single scripture of transcendence—
Bestowed upon the barren mountains of the degenerate age,
Would they consume gold or feast upon the scriptures?

The celestial regulations prescribe incense-burning at the six hours;
With the sun held in the heart’s contemplation,
Seeing the master is like encountering the scriptures after four hundred million kalpas—
True virtue and power are perfected.

Names inscribed in the Mystic Register—
Among the middle ranks of the Upper Transcendents,
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to carefree existence,
Their names recorded in the scriptures of the Seven Treasures.

Facing north, memorialize the Azure Bureau to receive the precious scriptures.

Perfected officials, numinous functionaries,
Jade lads and jade maidens, perfected attendants—
Through sincere and secret resonance,
The heart communes with the Mystic Capital.

On the jiǎzǐ day, enter the chamber in purity after the dawn fast;
At midnight, when the generative qi stirs, recite the incantation:
"Supreme August Nine Numinous Spirits, Primordial Essence of the Three Luminaries,
Great Gods of the Immortal Capital, Three Purities of the Four Poles,
Eight Vows and Nine Unions—soar to the Jade Purity!"

The Dao is originally formless—
The Void and Primordial are spontaneous.

Masters in tens, hundreds, thousands, and myriad—
Those complete in attainment are the great vehicle’s adepts.
Clutching mugwort to ward off fire—
This speaks of lesser sincerity meeting calamity, as gods and humans admonish.

Amidst the love of throngs and kin, the heart abides in the treasury of Daoist precepts;
Amidst the heart of woe and peril, it dwells in the hall of benevolent salvation.
Seated in the land of vipers and adders, the mind contemplates the path of renunciation and distance;
Dwelling in the lair of tigers and leopards, the heart rests in the temple of fortune and virtue.

The Great Void, the Great Origin, the Great Emptiness—
These are the roots of precepts.
Discarding wealth to dispel stagnation, saving beings to perfect compassion.

**Eastern Brilliance Communion-with-the-True Talisman**
The essence of the Eastern Azure Radiant Yang Mist, *Opening Brilliance and Communing with Light*, is the primal glow of the origin’s dawn, illuminating the Eastern Heaven. It surges through ninety-nine myriad million layers, where flocks of jade-green fowl perch in verdant groves. Above lies the *Origin Azure* abode; within stands the *Azure Splendor* palace. The abode is graced by the *Nine Qi Primordial Elders*; the palace houses the *Azure Perfected Sage Lords*. To their right attend the *Azure Waist Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Kingfisher-Feather Divine Lads*.

Jade nectar cascades in the land of flowing fire, where the *Great Yang* holds the *Gushing Mouth* cavern, and the *Flowing Fire* abounds with deathless ones. Above stands the *Southern Culmen* terrace; within lies the *Cavern Yang* palace. The terrace is governed by the *Controller of Immortals and Life Mandates*; the palace contains the *Supreme Harmony Perfected*. To their right attend the *Great Perfected Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Vermilion Brilliance Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Huo, driving and guiding the nine-colored phoenixes. In the third month of summer, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens and descend to draw the brilliance of the *Crimson Palace*. The two qi intersect in responsive transformation, their changes emerging from subtle glimmers. Essence condenses into script; qi congeals into stars. He who swallows this qi will have numinous lords descend to his chamber; he who cools this essence may soar through the eight voids, command the *Six Jia*, and dispatch the *Six Ding*.

**Western Essence Vast-Spirit Transformative Radiance Supportive Talisman**
Its script is the essence-qi of the Western *Vast-Spirit Metal Soul Sun Gate*, the primal glow of the sixfold golden radiance. Brightly it illumines the Western Rong, vast and flowing through sixty-six myriad million layers. Its essence falls like jade, driving light and streaming luster, pouring into the *Smelting Refinement* court. There lies the *Returning Countenance* pool, the *Refined Immortal* gem, and the *Gold Gate* with its azure-gold cinnabar. Above stands the *Dragon Mountain* divine tower; within lies the *Plain Spirit* palace. The tower is graced by the *Twelve King Immortals*; the palace shelters the *Western Florescence Perfected*. To their right attend the *Plain Spirit Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Gold Florescence Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Che, driving and guiding the *White Emperor’s* kings. In the third month of autumn, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens. The two qi respond and intersect, congealing essence into talismans and condensing qi into spirits. He who swallows this qi will instantly summon a divine countenance; he who cools this essence may soar through the *Gold Gate*, sit and summon the ten directions, and summon clouds to bring forth dragons.

**Northern Mystery Refinement Transformative Talisman**
The essence of the Northern *Profound-True Whistling Wind Florescence Dawn* is the primal glow of the opening of yin and yang. Its radiance is chaotic, now merging, now parting, scattering and flowing through fifty-five myriad million layers. Its essence is profoundly interwoven, like the dark clouds’ distant smoke merging with blossoms yet unshining. It engenders the five phases and establishes the *Mysterious Beginning*, where yin generates the *Refined Immortal Jade Paste* and the *Cold Water* holds the *Demon-Quelling King*. Above stands the *Sevenfold Divine Flower Canopy*; within lies the *Crossing Spirit* hall, which shelters the *August Jade Dawn*. To their right attend the *Great Mystery Jade Maidens*; to their left, the *Jade Dawn Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of Mount Da, driving and guiding the flying tortoises and purple wheels. In the third month of winter, they ascend to guide the qi of the Nine Heavens, congealing essence into script and condensing qi into immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Seven Dawns* descend to his chamber; he who ingests this essence may reverse and transform yin and yang. Such are the wonders of the *August Numinous Script*.

**Yellow Supreme Eight Scriptures Talisman**
The essence of the *Central Yellow Supreme Divine Mother Jade Gate Life-Radiance Communing Brilliance* is the primal glow of heaven and earth’s warp and woof, the twelve celestial stems. It illumines the eight directions, its mist wafting and scattering, its light brilliant and merging with the void. It surges and rises in the capital of the *Great Mystery*, threading through twelve myriad million layers, its flowing nectar overflowing in the land of the four seasons. Above stands the *Royal Capital* palace; within lies the *Leather Canopy* palace. The former is governed by the *Supreme Dao Lord*; the latter contains the *Wood Dawn Lord*. To their left attend the *Flying Immortals with Feathered Staffs* and the *Azure Florescence Jade Maidens*; to their right, the *Commanding Immortal Jade Gentlemen* and the *Golden Bell Divine Lads*. They ever ride the sacred beasts of the *Nine Wastes*, driving and guiding the *Yellow Supreme* dragons. They gather the five qi to revolve the celestial stems, commanding the twelve *Polar Arrays*, ascending to guide the source and flow of the Nine Heavens, and descending to draw the yellow spirit of the spleen. The two qi intersect above the *Muddy Pellet*, refining and transforming in the chamber of the *Three Cinnabar Fields*. Essence congeals to transform spirits; qi condenses to refine immortals. He who swallows this qi will have the *Yellow Elder* descend in form; he who cools this essence will radiate the color of *vajra*. Myriad marvels transform, and one may soar through the Great Void. The wondrous efficacy of this numinous script defies measure.

Virtue is the father;
Spiritual illumination, the mother.
Purity and quiescence, the teacher;
Supreme harmony, the friend.
The horse and tiger are dragons,
And one becomes coeval with heaven and earth.
To be mysterious and silent
Is to exhaust the Dao.
Without goodness, one does not act;
Without harmony, one does not speak.

Thus, those who do good awaken of themselves; those who commit evil punish themselves. A heart upright knows no doubt; a heart pure bears no defilement. The Most High August Emperor refines the Supreme Perfected through ninefold refinement.

The mouth and tongue are the palace of calamity, the mansion of peril and ruin. Speech is the repository of great destiny, the domain of punishment and misfortune. When the sage speaks, he fears that his words may stray from the wondrous truth. Though literary eloquence fills heaven and earth, when the worthy and sagely speak—

To a lord, their words bring grace to the state;
To a father, kindness to his child;
To a teacher, love to the multitude;
To brothers, fraternal conduct in action;
To a minister, loyalty to his sovereign;
To a ruler, filial piety to his parents;
To a friend, trust in their bond;
To a wife, chastity to her husband;
To a husband, harmony in the household;
To a younger sibling, reverence in ritual;
To a rustic, encouragement in farming;
To a Daoist, rectitude in the Dao;
To one of a foreign land, each guards their own realm;
To servants and maids, caution in their duties.

The Dark Lord of the Northern Cavern, the Solitary and Uttermost, the Five Numinous Ones, the Mysterious Elder—his surname is Hao, his style Fuming. Scion of the Mysterious August, descendant of the Grand Clarity, at the age of twelve in the midst of the Azure Heaven, his heart delighted in mountains and waters. After a thousand days he returned, and beneath the Mirror Mountain he encountered a field of lettuce. He gathered it to relieve the destitute, yet after three years his task remained unfinished, and he perished at the mountain’s foot. The Nine Heavens inscribed his yang virtue; the golden tablets recorded his jade name. His ethereal soul was conveyed to the Palace of Vermilion Clarity, where the Emperor dispatched the Golden-Winged Great Roc to spread its mighty wings over his corpse. Seven hundred years passed until the water kalpa altered the cosmic tide, and his remains drifted into boundless depths. When the waters receded, they came to rest upon the Northern Black Mound. Thirty years later, a great mountain fire raged, and he was refined in its flames before rising again, a five-colored cloud canopy above him. The Primordial Beginning bestowed upon him the *Lingbao Crimson Writ of the Five Qi of the Mysterious Heaven*, the true scripture of the Black Emperor of the North.

Some sold themselves to sustain the Dharma; some cast themselves before hungry tigers; some carved their flesh to feed the birds. Their utmost sincerity moved the Great Void; their hidden virtue harmonized with the Three Luminaries. The Most High’s *Ninefold Crimson Seals of the Five Thearchs’ Inner Perfected*.

Unmatched diligence, no peer in devotion; the forests and peaks, the Dharma-wheel. Kindly opening expedient means, great compassion pervades all. Dispelling greed and lust, calming wrath and affliction, eradicating perverse folly, extinguishing the three poisons—these four deeds are the forerunners of the Six Perfections.

Men and women each contend in their intentions; four horses pass like a crack in the wall—yet even this is slow. Compared to them, the fleeting question of a cloud is swift as lightning, yet neither matches the speed of thought. To master the heart is more difficult than taming tigers and leopards. Apes, monkeys, deer, and horses are all easily controlled. Only the supremely sagely can truly govern the heart.

Rectify the spirits, rectify the heart; rectify conduct, rectify the body. Heavenly spirits revere them; earthly spirits guard them. The discipline of cultivating the heart and entering the Dao unfolds in myriad branches. From beginning to end, steadfast in integrity, they guide in hidden transformation; in advance and retreat, harmonizing their light, they teach in secret practice. Eating but once at midday, they maintain purity in their person. Even gold must not be defiled—how much more the Supreme Dao!

The Three Wondrous Treasure Texts of the Supreme Nine Perfected Luminous Regulations.

Place a vessel of pure water, and two fen of true pearls. Write the Luminous Talisman of Penetrating Clarity and place it in the water, exposing it in the central courtyard for one night. Hold the water facing north, knock the teeth three times, and recite the incantation:

*"The radiance of heaven is veiled by vapors,
The five spirits are mingled with the true.
Cinnabar numina are all disordered,
Impure qi fills the sky.
Today, pure and auspicious,
Cease misfortune and reveal good fortune.
Three parts adorn and reflect,
Five mushrooms wash away dust.
The eight qi penetrate brightly,
Interweaving through my body.
Above, white; below, yellow—
Within and without, luminous and fresh."*

Wash the hands and face with the water; it may also be used for bathing. Pour the remaining water into an eastward-flowing stream. All impurities will dissolve, the myriad perfected will abide in the body, and even after three transgressions, one remains unstained—thus cultivating the Dao of the Three Heavens.

*Oral Instructions of the Azure Lad:*
In the realm of the living, purity is scarce and turbidity abundant; one should wear the tattered talisman. The qi of the Nine Heavens transforms into nine phoenixes, each guarding the body, soaring through the Three Realms, drawing the wondrous qi of the Three Clarities, and sweeping away the dust and clamor of the Nine Lands.

The *Supreme Azure Prime Upper Record* states:
*"Bathe with five fragrances at the three times."*

On the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months, as well as on ordinary days at dawn, noon, and midnight:

*Qingmu* (cypress) leaves are divided into five segments, each fivefold in structure. The people of Tianzhu (India) say: the five fragrant herbs repel malign qi, stabilize the hun and po souls, subdue demonic entities, and summon numinous perfected beings. This herb grows abundantly east of the Canglang River, where the divine beings of the East each transform into *qingmu* incense.

When one burns *qingmu*, *xunlu* (frankincense), and *anxi* resin in the bedchamber, it dispels the foulness of the Five Turbidities and the demonic qi of the earth, which would otherwise rise straight up to the heavens for forty *li*. The smoke of this incense shatters the filth of turbid qi and parts the mists of evil demons. Heavenly beings and jade maidens, the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, follow the fragrant vapors to rest upon one’s face and form.

Scholars of the highest learning ingest the radiance of the sun and moon, the flying roots of golden essence. The Way of the Yellow Qi: on the morning of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), boil *baizhi* (angelica), peach bark, and *qingmu*, then bathe facing east. On *jiazi* days, one should bathe.

*The Precious Divine Daily Record of the Queen Mother of the West* states:
On the first, fifteenth, and twenty-third days of each month, draw water from three rivers (or three wells, as some say). Measure the water in a *hu* vessel, then boil one *liang* each of *jishe* (clove), *qingmu*, *lingling* (lemongrass), *xunlu*, and *chenxiang* (aloeswood). Inscribe the *Tongming* talisman upon the water and use it for bathing. First, face east and knock the teeth twenty-four times, visualizing the Seven Stars above the nape, a canopy of purple mist filling the room, divine youths scattering incense to the left, and jade maidens holding towels to the right. Upon completion, recite the incantation:

*"The Three Luminaries shine brightly,
The Five Spirits become serene.
The heavens bear no floating haze,
The earth stirs no flying dust.
Bathe in the Eastern Well,
Receive and reverse your form.
Body fragrant, bones aromatic,
Ascend to the Jade Court.
Having received the Supreme Perfected,
Cast the talisman into the well."*

This is the supreme method of imperial bathing, transmitted from the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning to the Heavenly Emperor of Unity. Through cultivation, the Emperor Lord attained flowing purple radiance to crown his imperial form. The Supreme Prime Lord of the Southern Culmen refined it to emit an upper fragrance heard across the Three Clarities. The Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity cultivated it, and the divine mushrooms of the Five Directions gathered in his chamber. The Golden Gate Lord of the Supreme Sages developed a royal glow upon his face. The Prime Minister Azure Lad refined it, and his fragrance suffused the Three Clarities. This secret Way resides within the Purple Chamber of the Southern Culmen.

Bathing in the Orchid Pool above,
Dragons bear the long-handled vase.
Golden youths scatter fragrant blossoms,
Jade maidens stream the Five Stars.
Crown and sash washed in jade nectar,
Refining and transcending the Five Immortals’ forms.
Body fragrant, myriad spirits descend,
Riding the light to ascend the lofty clarity.

Bathe at the Golden Gate,
Crown and sash aglow with divine radiance.
The Jade Void seals the talisman,
All immortals converge in return.
Heavenly officials and their retinues
Feast and wander the Three Clarities, ascending the Dark Peak.

The Supreme Unity Emperor Lord regards the Purple Chamber as the Primordial Father and Mysterious Mother, the Three Wombs as divine luminaries. The Eight Pure Ones adorn the Mysterious, with true contemplation as their foremost; the esoteric words and wondrous essentials are the *Inner Canon of the Nine Perfected*. The divine method takes pure thought as its deepest core, and the youthful adept takes thorough realization as attaining the numinous. The *Great Cavern* takes the exalted as its origin, the *Great Elixir* takes the Feminine One as its inner essence, the Five Elders take spontaneity as their morning bones, the Supreme Lord takes the Non-Beflowered as the Mysterious Clarity, the Yellow Venerable takes will and nature as the root of the Dao, the White Prime takes immaculate cultivation as entry into the real, perfected beings take qi-convergence as mutual refinement, and the essentials of immortality take essence-response as the completion of the Dao.

*Jingzi* (Essence Son), *Chengzi* (Sincerity Son), *Shenrongzi* (Spirit Glory Son), *Zhongzi* (Central Son), *Hezi* (Harmony Son), *Daonaihuazi* (Dao-Transforming Son):
Sincerity is the gateway of the spirit. It accomplishes what cannot be accomplished, guards what cannot be guarded. Ascending the Mysterious—there is being in non-being, non-being in non-non-being. Neither being nor non-being, it circulates through the Nine Extremes. Proceeding without cease, contemplating without weariness.

The five viscera within the body correspond to the Five Peaks. Learning is like the midday sun—before study, all is dark and obscure; this is the first stage of enlightenment. In learning, one must be precise and cannot be unclear, then one may fathom the wonders of the Three Clarities. Confine a thousand evils in the prison of the Eight Wastes, seal ten thousand demons at the ends of the Nine Distances. When the heart is upright, heaven and earth cannot oppose it. Constantly guard the Nine Hun souls to seek flying immortality.

The Great Unity abides peacefully in the Six Dwellings,
The Five Numinous Ones guard the Three Mouths.
The Three Officials refine and harmonize,
The five viscera are at peace and inquire no further.
Secure them with divine medicines,
Nourish the cloud-body.

What scholars cannot learn,
Where others cannot dwell—
the true and spontaneous One.
A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from a hair’s tip;
The smoke of ascending clouds arises from a spark’s flame.

*The Regulations of the Supreme Perfected*:
Evil accumulates and leads to death—
the suffering of death is lamentable.
Good accumulates and leads to long life—
the joy of life is cause for celebration.
Accomplish three thousand merits to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.
Accomplish three hundred good deeds to attain earthly immortality.
To learn the Way of ascending as an immortal, one must perform six thousand two hundred good deeds.
With surplus in cultivation,
Heaven sends a cloud chariot.
Those who magnify the Dao do not perish,
Attaining deathlessness by their own efforts.

The Way of Great Compassion
Takes saving others as its priority.
Without merit, there is no reward;
Without virtue, no promotion;
Without trust, no salvation;
Without practice, no immortality.
Those who establish merit and virtue
Do so for heaven and earth,
For the Three Luminaries,
For the emperor,
For the myriad people,
For ancestral generations,
For all beings,
And for themselves.

Exhale and inhale primordial harmony,
Sip and rinse with flowing rosy clouds.
The essence of the Five Flowers—
the question of the Immortal Duke.

The *Mysterious Record of Immortal Bones* inscribes names in the Golden Pavilion and Jade Register. Those who, in past lives, accumulated five hundred good deeds and fulfilled them all may attain the Three Ones.

On the Eight Auspicious Days,
They pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy,
Offering high vows to ascend the heavens,
Transcend the Jade Pure River,
And wander through the myriad heavens;
Middle vows to transform their forms,
Summon the Five Spirits,
And ascend through the Moon Gate;
Low vows that the Four Poles receive their oral commands,
The Western Florescence attend as guards,
Command golden lads,
Lead the Five Elders,
The Eight Sceneries share the same chariot,
The Upper Celebrations converge,
And the Five Vows unfold in full.

In paying homage to the celestial patterns,
There are eleven contemplations,
Fourteen merits,
And true persons who serve as bridges for the world.

The *Secret Scripture* in the Palace of Great Existence above the Nine Heavens—
Fierce dragons and venomous beasts guard the Jade Pass,
Jasper phoenixes spread their wings,
Girdled simurghs shade the mysteries,
Hosts of perfected ones feast in reverence,
Myriad sages pay homage in chariots,
Jade steps and canopies extend into the celestial court,
The Great Emperor humbles himself before the throne.

Golden perfection and jade radiance—
At dawn, sunset, midnight, and the quiet of night,
They pay reverence to the Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions, beginning with the East.

The *Scripture of the Numinous Treasure’s Spontaneous Dao* is inscribed in cinnabar and gold on the Terrace of Purple Tenuity. Daily, the perfected immortals and sages circumambulate it thrice, burning incense.

Those who receive and practice the *Supreme Mystery of the Cavernous Profound Scripture* follow the highest instructions. Thrice a month, they seclude themselves to pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Supreme Perfected Venerable, and the True Kings of the Nine Heavens. On those days, they bathe, enter the chamber, burn incense facing north, and kneel to say: *"I beseech the divine immortals to inscribe my name in the Jade Register."*

Bones grow marrow, flesh transforms into golden perfection.
The cinnabar chamber is infused with mystery, and purple mist arises within.
When finished, they rise and bow twice.
After seven years of cultivation, the true spirits manifest in form.
Golden bones and jade names are engraved in the Azure Palace.
After a thousand days of fasting,
Uninvolved in worldly affairs,
They hold fast to purity, incense, and precepts.
Unsullied by the dust of the world,
Serene in the six practices,
With hearts gentle and intentions profound,
Their names are inscribed in the Golden Canon,
Listed in the Nine Heavens.

Those who receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Scripture* from the Supreme Dao Lord of the Great Dao
Master the Eight Winds of Jade Revitalization and wander the path of the Imperial Unity.

On Mount Shu, a thousand-year-old tree spirit
Encountered three worthy men passing by who rested beneath its branches.
From within the hollow tree, a voice spoke: *"In past lives, my merits were incomplete, so I remain bound to this tree. I entreat you to visit my home and hold a three-day fast for me."*
The household then invited Daoist masters to burn incense, recite scriptures, and perform rites of repentance for three days.
Thereupon, the spirit ascended into the clouds, becoming a wandering immortal in the Radiant Empyrean, embodying the original conduct of the free-roaming immortals.
Their bodies fragrant and pure, now like gold and jade.

When the Three Primes unfold,
Their virtue crowns the heavens.
Virtue like the Great Void—
Formless and boundless, the origin of Primordial Beginning.
Virtue like the Great Dao—
Majestic and expansive, the treasure of divine luminosity.
Their virtue like heaven and earth,
Like the Three Luminaries, illuminating all heavens;
Like the four seasons, nurturing the myriad beings;
Like the Great Mystery, the capital of immortals;
Like Mount Tai, stabilizing spirits and anchoring numina;
Like the Great River, vast and unobstructed.

The Three Luminaries honor such noble conduct.
Each year holds six fasts.

On one’s natal day, the Gengshen day, and the Jiazi day, the Most High dispatches Perfected Ones, the sages of the ten directions, and immortals to descend upon the Three Realms below, while all ghosts and spirits likewise descend. The numina of heaven and earth tremble in reverence. Those who practice the Dao, recite scriptures, and in the six periods of day and night focus their minds upon the Perfected—such devotees shall have their lifespans extended by the Director of Destinies, be spared the Ten Sufferings and Eight Calamities, and ever dwell in blessed lands, while their seven generations of ancestors ascend to the Heavenly Halls.

In former times, the Most High transmitted the Six Fasts of the Three Annual Fasts to the Perfected One of the Stone Chamber, the Ten Methods of the Sixth Month to the Heavenly Elder Perfected One, and commanded the Perfected One of Emptiness and Nonbeing, Laozi, to transmit the Orthodox Unity teachings to the Three Heavens Master of the Correct One.

On the fifteenth day of the first month (Upper Prime), the fifteenth day of the seventh month (Middle Prime), and the fifteenth day of the tenth month (Lower Prime)—these three days of the year, along with the third day of the third month—when the Five Emperors of Earth, the Five Marchmounts, the officials of the Three Realms, and all the numina of the water palaces ascend to the Two Prime Offices of the Mysterious Capital in the Three Heavens, the Heavenly Worthy of the Boundless, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Flying Heavenly Kings, the Supreme Jade Void Perfected Great Spirits, the Lord of the Boundless Dao and Most High, the Venerable Ones, the Southern and Northern Poles, the Eastern and Western Unitary Flowers, the Ninefold Numinous True Mothers, the Jade Maidens of Grand Harmony, the Southern and Northern Dippers, and the constellations of the heavens—all assemble in solemn array. The officials of the Three Primes, left, right, and center, the Three Offices and Nine Bureaus, the One Hundred Ten Departments, the yin-yang officials of water, fire, wind, and the blade, and the examiners of merit—all tally the good deeds of heaven and earth, inscribing the virtuous in the Azure Register and the transgressors in the Black Register, each report submitted to the Three Offices. Those who follow the Three Primes’ rites of repentance shall have the earth spirits guard their gates, and the Three Offices shall protect and recommend them.

The Supreme Cavern-Real Three Nonbeing Fasts:
Upper Prime governs Heaven, Middle Prime governs Earth, Lower Prime governs Humanity.
The Three Primes unite in perfection, corresponding above to the Nine Mysteries.
Upper Prime lasts nine days, Middle Prime six days, Lower Prime three days.
On the day before the fast begins, bathe with five fragrances—from nine persons of the Upper Mystery to three of the Lower Limit.
On the day of the fast, inscribe the Golden Perfected and Jade Radiance tokens of the Nine Heavens and place them before the Five Emperors to summon the spirits and invoke the numinous.

The *Three Primes Three Grades Fast Method of the Great Perfected* records that the Five Venerable Elder Spirits and the Heavenly Emperor-Kings customarily gather on the Six Fast Days at the Mysterious Capital’s Primordial Yang Purple Tenuity Terrace in the Upper Heavens, where they tally the celestial reckonings and examine the movements of destiny. The Heavenly Emperors, the Great Ones of the heavens, the envoys of the sun, moon, and stars, the Three Offices’ examiners of destiny, and the great spirits of the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses traverse the world below, scrutinizing merits and transgressions. Those who cultivate the fasts shall have their merits recorded by the Three Offices and Five Emperors, their names inscribed in the heavens. Below, they may pay homage to the Most High, and their seven generations of ancestors shall all ascend to the Halls of Blessing.

On the seventh day of the first month, the Fast of All Heavens is observed. Inscribe names on yellow su tablets, erasing death and restoring life. The Great Sage of the Primordial Numinous Treasure of the Northwest Heavens, the assembly of perfected and venerable spirits, and the Venerable Elder of the Limitless Dao’s Imperial True Sovereign gather on the first day at the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Capital, the Purple Tenuity Terrace of the Northwest Mountain in the Upper Heavens.

Those who uphold the fast shall have their transgressions absolved by the Three Offices.

The Great Sage of the Northern Heavens and the Most High Lord Lao gather on the eighth day at the Numinous Treasure’s Mysterious Capital, the Yin Primordial Terrace of the Jade Mountain above. They urge the Northern Dipper’s Controller of Demon-Slaying to descend with the Eight Poles’ Registrars, traversing the world below. On this day, those who observe the fast shall have their transgressions erased by the Three Offices, their names recorded in the Three Heavens, inscribed in the Registers of Immortals. Heaven and earth’s spirits shall guard and protect them, and the myriad calamities shall not afflict them.

The Sage of the Northeast Heavens, the assembly of the Most High’s myriad transformations and myriad births, the Divine Sovereign of the Upper Mystery, and the Venerable Elder of the Primordial gather on the fourteenth day at the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Mountain, the Azure Tenuity Terrace of Penetrating Yang.

Those who cultivate the fast shall be protected and recommended by the Five Emperors’ divine guardians.

The Great Sage of the Southeast Heavens, the assembly of the Southern Upper Venerable Lords, the Cinnabar Sage of the Southern Culmen, the Perfected of the Southern Culmen, and the Jade Maidens of Grand Harmony gather on the eighteenth day at the Cinnabar Terrace of the Grotto Spirit on Jade Mountain.

On this day, reciting scriptures and burning incense, the Earth Office’s spirits shall guard and protect.

The Great Sage of the Upper Heavens, the assembly of the Most High of the Upper and Lower, Central, Four Directions, and Eight Quarters, the Venerable Lords of the Effortless Great Dao, the primordial qi of the Dao, boundless and without origin, formless and chaotic, empty and spontaneous—within the Dao, the luminous sovereigns of spirit and clarity, the myriad myriad billions upon billions, the countless hosts, the Venerable Lords of virtue and power, the celestial officials and great spirits of the immortals gather on the thirtieth day at the Seven Treasures’ Purple Tenuity Palace to pay homage to the myriad true emperors of heaven. They tally the great kalpas and the lesser kalpas of the hundred and six. On this day, they dispatch the Upper Great One to descend among them, the stars and constellations of the heavens, the sun and moon, the Armillary Sphere and Northern Dipper all descending with the Five Emperors, the Five Marchmounts and Four Watercourses, the Water Emperor’s examiners, and the earth’s spirits to traverse the world below.

Contemplate the spirit, record the qi, practice the methods, and ascend the names—these are the Eight Commands of the Most High for the fast.

Ascend to heaven without a cloud-ladder,
Step through flight without stellar qi—
Yet compare learning without fasting.

A day of pure fast adds ten decades to life;
Ten decades of pure fast add a cycle to destiny;
A thousand days of pure fast add a century to years.
Conceal virtue, hide radiance,
Summon spirits, seek response.

The Golden and Yellow Registers—
the solemn rites of the Numinous Treasure’s many fasts.
Six methods of fasting:
Golden Register, Yellow Rescript, Luminous Perfection,
Three Primes, Spontaneity, and Cultivation of the Body.

The repository of separation and union,
the gate of opening barriers—
these are the offices for delivering the living.

The palaces of the Six Heavens—
where names of the dead are cast aside,
where the repository of opening barriers
delivers the body of the adept.

If there is wrong, immediately reform and repent;
if there is right, steadfastly persist.
Inner and outer intermingle,
victory and defeat tilt against each other,
before and after connect.

*The Supreme High’s Chart of Predestined Fate*
Wash the heart, confess transgressions first,
dispel faults, send away errors.
Do not blame heaven and earth,
do not resent humans and spirits.
Reform virtue, cultivate the future—
in three years, carve and attain transcendence.

Accumulate goodness as ramparts,
the heavens’ net is like frost and snow.

The Three Sovereigns—
unless born of the Jade Clarity’s lineage,
all are conceived in the primal undifferentiated qi,
bound to the snatching of defilement.

*The Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*
Unveil the Three Luminaries,
loosen the hair, knock the teeth.

Then, purify with a hundred days of fasting, receive the precious scriptures, and first confess one’s own transgressions. Master and disciple together endure the trials of the Wind-Knife’s Elder. The hun and po endure ten hardships and eight calamities, the body perishes in the Dark Springs.

The upper-grade person is serene and desireless, like water facing a mirror—unobstructed, unburdened, unattached, unseeking. The middle-grade person thinks little and desires little, trembling with vigilance. The lower-grade person reveres and trusts the Daoist teachings.

Vowing to the Three Luminaries, encompassing the ten thousand kalpas, their essence remains unwavering and unyielding. Lord Dao of Mount Long vowed to serve as master for the five paths of heaven and humanity. In due time, the five sacred peaks and all mountains shall be leveled, the earth like flowing glass.

The Twelve Supreme Vows,
*The Essential Exegesis of the Supreme Perfected Writ*:
The four movements harmonize, all vows are fulfilled.
Light illumines the heavens,
floating clouds gather like mist,
shading and veiling the profound mystery.
In concealment, they practice non-action;
in dispersion, they pervade all under heaven.

The Five Vows of the Thearch:
First vow: the body moves in unison with the Three Luminaries.
Second vow: the body dwells above the Great Void, within the jeweled chambers of the King’s Palace, feasting with the Jade Emperor by day and resting with the Mysterious Mother by night, quenching thirst with the jade nectar of the surging well and the red-flowered fungus, sating hunger with dragon embryos, jade fat, and the crimson fruits of the sacred tree.
Third vow: the body generates seventy-two radiant lights of myriad forms, with extraordinary hair and bones, entering and departing the imperial palace, drawing blessings in abundance, enjoying boundless longevity.
Fourth vow: to live and die with qi, to die and be reborn again, to be enfeoffed over the ten heavens and govern the host of immortals.
Fifth vow: to ensure that all beings, along with the sun, moon, and Three Luminaries, and those of the Dao, together with their seven dark and nine ancestral kin, ascend to the Southern Palace.

The Four Directions’ Five Vows converge in the Hall of Blessings.

On the first day of the first month, when the sun is aligned with the Celestial Thearch of the Great Tenuity, one should pray to the Heavenly Net and Earthly Web, saying:
*"As I wander alone through the nets of the ten directions and nine heavens above, dare any ensnare my body? As I roam through the webs of the ten directions and nine earths below, dare any entangle my form? As I ascend to the Supreme High, entering the feast in the Palace of Flowing Springs and the Curved River, let not my hun be detained."*

Reverently observe the charts and texts, perform the morning rites with solemnity.
Visualize the Perfected Lord of the Great One
within the Chamber of Mysterious Cinnabar.
Clad in swan’s down,
ascend to the Great Clarity.
Visualize the sun and moon upon the face,
entering the Grotto Chamber and Golden Flower Palace through the nostrils,
their radiance emerging from behind the neck,
forming a nine-colored halo that gently enters the Jade Pillow.
The sun enters from the left nostril, the moon from the right.

*The Precious Esoteric Instructions of the Supreme Ultimate*:
Visualize the descent of the Dao’s spirit, the jade countenance and golden visage.
Heart and appearance align—
this is called the Capital of the Great Mystery,
where the eyes behold the Jade Capital Mountain within the hall.

Bo Chengzi, Guang Chengzi, Qing Zhenzi, and Gu Xizi
contemplate the qi of the Dipper’s stars,
merging with the body into the lotus seed.
Suddenly, they perceive within the lotus a jade mountain spanning a thousand leagues,
palaces stretching ten thousand acres,
crimson trees laden with fruit beneath cloud-touched canopies,
purple blossoms sprouting from fungi,
azure brushstrokes on a yellow ground,
the Three Simplicities and Eight Wheels.
The Four Masters roam without realizing they are atop the lotus seed.

Once the five contemplations are established,
the form of the Dao appears.
Where the Dao abides, the ten thousand things are discerned;
where the Dao transforms, the ten thousand things converge.
To think of spirits is to govern spirits,
to think of the real is to attain the real,
to think of immortals is to attain immortality,
to think of the Dao is to govern the Dao,
to think of abundance is to govern abundance.
The essence of the sage is to think of the worthy and govern the worthy.
When one’s thoughts summon aid, it is granted.
If thoughts persist unbroken,
a scattered mind brings a thousand anxieties.
Twelve contemplations,
twelve rewards.

The Five Calamities—three calamities and nine tribulations—are guided by celestial officials and welcomed by earthly deities. Commanding the Six Jia spirits, they set the stars in motion. Summoning the Three Sovereigns, they dispatch ghosts and spirits, and life’s bones daily renew. With focused and silent contemplation, the Primordial Elder bestows the jade talisman in Nanyang; the August Emperor inscribes the purple name in the Cinnabar Numinosity. Engraved in the Western Terrace’s chambers, fixed in the Eastern Flower’s abode, they harmonize with the qi of the Three Simplicities. Gazing upward, one beholds the radiance of the morning lamp. The Eight Effulgences propel the body in ascent, circling through seventy-four directions. Grace flows through the nine marshes, and blessings surge through the mysterious and plain.

The *Nine Heavens’ Scripture of Spirit Generation* arises from the soaring, arcane qi of the Three Caverns. Threefold harmonies form its sound, coalescing into numinous script. It unites the hundred spirits, concealing their inner names through kalpas. Reciting the *Celestial Treasure* illumines the light of heaven and earth; reciting the *Numinous Treasure* awakens the souls of the Nine Dark Realms from eternal night; reciting the *Spiritual Treasure* governs the ten thousand spirits; reciting the *Grand Unity* delivers the body’s spirits; reciting the *Nine Heavens* generates life. When one recites it once, the sound ascends to the Nine Heavens, the Golden Towers and Jade Halls, the Twelvefold Gates, the Purple Portals and Jade Pavilions, the thirty-six thousand barriers. The Grand Unity confers talismans; the Primordial Lord grants life. Jade lads and maidens serve east and west, galloping in dragon chariots to ascend at dawn to the Nine Heavens’ spirit generation.

The *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Its Virtue*:
The superior adept, upon receiving its rhymes, becomes a Celestial King of the Most High;
the middling adept, upon reciting it, becomes a flying immortal;
the lesser adept, upon reciting it, becomes a Wheel-Turning Sage King.
The Heavenly Emperor’s numinous chariot welcomes their ethereal spirits.
Above, it extols the new bestowals of the Primordial Lord;
below, it celebrates the great compassion of the divine perfected teachings.
This path, when one supplicates the Five Chapters, the *Numinous Writ of the Great Emperor*, and recites the *Five Thousand Characters* ten thousand times, summons the descent of the Most High’s cloud-dragon in welcome. For those who have not yet departed, recite it thrice a month.

The *Supreme Ultimate’s Esoteric Annotations and Treasured Instructions*:
On the half-month, one’s fate-day, the eight solar terms, at noon and midnight, receive and recite the *Five Thousand Characters*. Entrusting one’s form to the Great Yin’s day, one avoids the trials of Mount Tai’s Five Offices and the hells’ punishments. Above, one is reborn before the Heavenly Emperor; below, one is reborn into the households of marquises and kings, endowed with perfect features and a spirit so radiant it outshines blossoms. In tranquil contemplation of the Mysterious Chamber, establish the Terrace of Blessings.

Entering the chamber to recite the scriptures, all don the sashes of the Five Emperors, while the Four Offices and their retinues come forth in welcome.

From the *Luminous Regulations of the Four Poles*:
When Yin Xi recites one scroll of scripture ten thousand times over a thousand days, his ears become keen of hearing, his eyes penetrating of sight. The heavens each present lotus thrones and high seats, celestial beings bear jeweled canopies to cover him, flying dragons roar, lions guard the gates. The divine kings of the heavens, possessed of the Five Penetrations, along with spirit-people, scatter flowers, burn incense, and make offerings.

The Most High Dao Lord expounded the *Great Wisdom Writ of Supreme Clarity*. The Golden Portal Emperor, seated in attendance, heard it and reported to the Azure Lad: "This prime ministerial rank may be conferred upon Daoist practitioners." Later, he informed Chi Xianzi of the Southern Marchmount, who fell ill in the Golden Flower Mountains. As the saying goes: "Heaven is lenient, but ghosts afflict with illness to disrupt one’s true nature." Though stricken, he chanted and recited, completing three thousand repetitions. The Great Golden Portal then made him the True Person of the Grand Hut. At the same time, all acclaimed his virtue, and his blessings advanced in threefold measure.

The True Persons of the Ten Directions
attended the *Numinous Writ* in the Jade Mountains, pacing the void through the Five Peaks, where all the heavens came forth in welcome, praising his excellence.

The Dao is not to be prized—what is to be prized is the power to act. The dragon transforms the seven yin souls, the thirst-demons within the body’s namesake.

The method for restraining the seven souls:
On the new moon, the full moon, and the last evening of the lunar month—once each.

From the *Purple Writ of the Numinous Book*:
In the Great Beginning’s primordial chaos, the Three Qi distinctly separated.

The Cavern-Chamber of Golden Splendor is called the Radiant Origin. The arts of restraining the hun-souls and controlling the po-souls, the methods for nurturing the spirit and cultivating life—these are recorded in the *Ink-Recorded Cinnabar Writs of the Most High*.

The Five Perfected stabilize and guard against external demons. The *True Scripture of the Grand Cavern*, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Sovereign—none is accomplished without the One, none is perfected without the One. To unite with the One as One—this is the path of the highest of the high.

For those of the middle rank and above, one must visualize the Three Origins, give life to and stabilize the Three Offices. The Three Corpses will surely fall, and the Three Origins will again be wondrous. Diligently practice the Five Virtues, and myriad good deeds will accumulate daily.

That which does not live shall not live; that which prolongs death shall hasten death.

The One is where primordial qi arises. The One is the guiding principle of Heaven.

If you truly desire long life, the Three-in-One must be made clear. When hunger reaches the thought of the One, the One grants coarse food; when thirst reaches the thought of the One, the One grants broth. Though slow, it is not hurried—the One settles in its chamber.

If one can conceal and prepare, the One will not depart. Seek it without ceasing, and you will ascend to those Nine Chambers.

Heaven can guard the One and cover without lifting; Earth can guard the One and remain still in its place. The mountains can guard the One and not shun cold or heat. The darkness can guard the One and flow without returning. If a person can guard the One, they will surely attain transcendence and ascend as an immortal.

The Guardian-General of the Precepts, the Twenty-Four Great Spirits, serve to protect and defend.

Bocheng Qinsheng inquired of the Way of Yunfang and the secrets of the Three Perfections. The Jade Emperor and the White and Two Purities are the Lord Emperors of the body, the primal perfected ones among the hundred spirits.

Now, to assist the solitary and examine the upright, the Three Sovereigns settle within, the Great One preserves the embryo, and the Five Elders refine the essence. The One abides in the Cinnabar Field, where the Controller of Destiny guards life. The One dwells in the Crimson Palace, where purple qi bathes the form. The One is honored in the Grotto Chamber, where the Three Simplicities merge in radiance. The Cloud Palace of the Hall of Light, the Purple Gate and Jade Portal, the Yellow Watchtower and Golden Chamber, the Jade City and Vermilion Window—these are the inner abodes of the Imperial One, the treasure chambers of the Three Perfected.

Thus, the single scene of Yunfang blends spirit and human, ascending to Kunlun above and descending to the Pure Springs below. Cloud canopies rise in towering majesty, forests and bamboos flourish in verdant splendor. The Seven Numinous Spirits revolve, the Three Colors entwine, and layered towers of ten thousand tiers form mist in three years. The Jade Watchtower stands in serene emptiness, the Seven Gates lie in profound depths. Golden doors and jade cabinets hold the talismanic registers in five scrolls. The undifferentiated takes form—summoning yang and calling forth yin.

The Three-in-One is the numinous origin of the body, the root of life for the hundred spirits, the mountain source of fluids, the royal chamber of soul and essence. The stomach’s pool is square to receive things, the brain’s palace is empty and round to accommodate the perfected. Ten thousand hairs stand erect, a thousand pores generate breath. Virtue fills Heaven and Earth, rank equals the Great Mystery.

Above the space between the brows lies the Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Red Child dwells. The heart is the Middle Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Perfected One dwells. Three inches below the navel is the Lower Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Infant Brother dwells. These together form the Three Cinnabar Fields.

The head contains nine palaces: three inches inward from between the brows is the Upper Twin Cinnabar Fields; one inch inward is the Hall of Light Palace; three inches inward is the Grotto Chamber Palace; three inches inward is the Cinnabar Field Palace; one inch above the Four Halls is the Heavenly Court Palace; one inch above the Grotto Chamber is the Flowing Pearl Palace; five inches inward is the Jade Emperor. Above the Hall of Ultimate Perfection is the Mystic Pearl Palace, one inch above the Flowing Pearl is the Supreme August Palace.

Above the space between the brows, within it lie the Yellow Watchtower and Purple Gate, the Crimson Terrace and Azure Chamber. Together they stand guard. The Azure Chamber’s great spirit is named *Zhengxin* ("Upright Heart"), styled *Chufang* ("Primal Square"). Within the Cinnabar Field Palace, the Lord Emperor is ever present; within the guarded inch, the great spirit is ever present.

The Most High said: The reason the Perfected One values the One as the True One is simply this—it is the One alone. The One’s resonance with the Great Void stirs unity; the One’s transformations align with the Heavenly Dao in profound accord. The Upper One is the Heavenly Emperor of the body, the Middle One is the Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, the Lower One is the Primal King of the Yellow Court. The true essence of the One oversees and governs the fourteen qi within the body, corresponding above to the Twenty-Four Perfected of the Grand Tenuity.

When true qi circulates in harmony, the two substances take form. The mysterious spirit blends and divides, the Purple Chamber lies in deep obscurity. The Upper One is the ultimate of the Perfected Emperor, the Middle One is the perfection of the Perfected King, the Lower One is the subtlety of the Perfected King. The Heavenly Sovereign attains the Upper One and becomes the August Ultimate; the Earthly Sovereign attains the perfection of the Upper One and becomes the One; the Human Sovereign attains the subtlety of the Upper One and dwells among the myriad subtleties.

Juzi transmitted this.

Su Lin guarded the Dao of the Three Perfected and the Primal One. He informed Lin: "I have been summoned by the August Lord to serve as Grand Master of the Four Offices of the Central Yellow, governing the Northern Sea." Later, he left behind a single document, which read: "The Five Pecks and Three Ones are secrets of the Supreme Emperor. After twenty years of concentrated contemplation, the Three Ones appeared. I now transmit this scripture to you. If you can guard the Three Ones, your name will be inscribed on the Jade Tablets.

"Should you abide in the Grotto Chamber as a Minister of the Upper Clarity and be further enlightened regarding the Three Origins to become one of the Five August Lords, the Golden Portal August Lord of Later Saints shall ascend in radiant clouds, traversing the Ten Great Forests.

"During the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han, he told his disciple Zhou Jitong: 'Yesterday, I was summoned by the Mystic Province to serve as Perfected Minister of Destiny, Grand Master of the Supreme Ultimate, and Marquis of the Central Office. Tomorrow, a cloud chariot with feathered canopies, drawn by dragons and tigers, accompanied by thousands of attending officers, will come to receive me.' That very day, Lin ascended to heaven, rising slowly toward the northwest, enveloped in clouds and mist.

"Thus, in the era of the Three Sovereigns, those who studied the Dao all prized the guarding of the One. One must make the heart uncarved and the spirit congealed, the body single-minded in sincere devotion. Let no hundred thoughts arise, and let essence and intent not scatter. If for three months one inwardly gazes and fixes the mind, a single spirit will appear, and the radiance of spirit will transform and coil through the five viscera.

"After the dispersal of the uncarved and the true, and the latent rise of florid falsity, the One fails to summon response, and spirits do not immediately answer. The method of the Three Ones is the first chapter of the true scriptures of the Golden Portal August Lord of the Upper Clarity of the August Heaven, the ultimate of the most exalted Dao, the ford of divine immortals, the wondrous formula of the host of Perfected. In all the myriad affairs of advancing or retreating in one’s person, one should constantly contemplate the One.

"Mud the nine palaces to nourish the po souls;
Within the Central Origin, embrace the One Palace.
The two numinous storehouses of the Cinnabar Field,
Merge to give birth to the Spirit King.
The Three Passes govern the nine great [forces];
Inhaling and exhaling, the light of sun and moon.
The five stars nurture them,
While the six ministers first flow and submit.
In stillness, the ten thousand qi return;
Spirit at peace, the body too flourishes.
The Perfected of the Three Sections and Eight Effulgences,
Escort me into the Grand Palace.

Ten thousand scrolls of cinnabar script
Are not equal to abiding in the One.
In precious retreat, preserve essence and cultivate the celestial form,
That the myriad things may be nurtured.
The wise scholar transcends the transformations of thought.
In the era of the Upper Sovereign, people
Deeply knew the ultimate essence of heaven and earth,
Attaining the mind and intent of heaven and earth.
When not studying,
It is like gazing in the dark at night—
East, west, south, north,
One strays beyond one’s chamber.
Riding the wind and soaring through the void,
Driving dragons and galloping through emptiness,
One observes the body."

The Pure and Profound Daoist Sect,
In silent contemplation, enters the Three Pristine Palaces;
The subtlest Way of the Utmost Dao pervades.

Ten trials, nine humiliations—
Yet holding reverent humility is the first wisdom.
Guiding the Three Origins and Five Spirits is the second wisdom.
Circulating through the eight directions,
One pure, one turbid; one sinking, one floating—
This is the third wisdom.
After nine years of ceaseless turning,
Reaching twenty-four years at the middle,
Thirty-two years at the height—
Such is the fourth wisdom.
Ten thousand trials, boundless endurance—
This is the fifth wisdom.

Perceiving form, perceiving qi, perceiving spirit,
The primordial origin of thought and reflection,
Right perception and liberation.
Resplendent is the adamantine body,
Transcendent, the Supreme Immortal.
Knowing the real, one attains the real;
Diligently seeking, one obtains the real.
The marvelous union of spirit and origin,
In serene contemplation, ever flowing.
The sun’s radiance transforms and moves,
The Purple Court illumines the body.
The Dao awakens to the Supreme Perfected,
The Seven Numinous Talismans penetrate deeply;
The divine mechanism becomes keenly perceptive,
The Eight August Ones establish the scripture.
One’s name is presented in the Imperial Hall,
Feathered registers inscribed in the Great Origin.
The body reposes in the Verdant Chamber,
Soaring through the Jade Void.

External study may reach the origin,
Yet internal study naturally pervades all.
Guiding the reins to ascend the luminous rosy clouds,
Flowing essence shines upon the jade branches.
Gazing back, within the nothingness there is being,
Merging as one with the infant.

Treading warily as upon ice and blades, one ascends the Mystery.
Empty, empty—thus one naturally unites with the Dao’s true Unity,
Recorded in the Supreme Perfected’s Purple Writs.

Should you wish to ascend to Heaven,
First practice the Seven Numinous [Talismans].
Having scaled the Northern Culmen,
Enter the Purple Court—
There, inscribed upon the Northern Wall of the Supreme Ultimate,
Are these characters:
*"At Xianyang, Mao Ying received the Step of the Unyielding Scripture from his master."*
Tested by fire that seared his robe,
Though his mouth spoke not a word,
His countenance remained as the Celestial Hosts marching the Supreme Ultimate.
He ascended to the Upper Clarity,
And now, ninety-eight years hence,
Has been appointed Minister to the Thearch-Emperors—
Thus is the sincerity of discernment and acceptance made known.

*The Jade Characters on the Golden Tablet of the Grand Tenuity*
—Inner Transmission of the Lady of the Southern Marchmount,
The Purple Void Primordial Sovereign

The Three Realms and Six Heavens
Are the domains of ghostly spirits, demon-kings, and their officials.
Those who align with the Lesser Dao summon lesser spirits;
Those who align with the Middle Dao summon middle spirits;
Those who align with the Great Dao summon great spirits.

The Primordial is the origin of Heaven and Earth,
Exalted by the Three Realms,
Illumined by the Five Thearchs.
The Five Palaces bind qi,
The Six Repositories generate the true;
The Nine Treasuries brightly reveal the Supreme Perfected’s Nine Crimson-Speckled Talismans.
Fathom the marvelous awakening of Heaven’s essence,
Sever all attachments to proximate thoughts.
The Feminine One and the Five Elders—
A hundred petitions birth the realm beyond the absolute.

Scattering winds to harmonize jade flutes,
Flying mists racing with six reins.
Setting aside the myriad entanglements,
One roams freely between Heaven and Earth,
Beyond the eight limits of the clouds,
To dwell as a neighbor to the Dao.

Those who awaken first guide those who awaken later,
Turning the current back to the One Source.
Much toil yields little gain—
In the end, this strays from the Great Vehicle.

Fourfold attainment:
First, *ascendant attainment*—golden suzhou pearls and jade,
Seven-jeweled palaces,
Equal to the Jade Capital;
Second, *bodily attainment*—form and marks perfected,
Diamond-indestructible;
Third, *destined attainment*—lifespan’s length or brevity,
Entrusted wholly to the Three Treasures;
Fourth, *sincere attainment*—fortune and misfortune, good and evil,
Suffering and joy, self and other both forgotten,
Ascending beyond the Three Clarities.

The form of the Primordial Shape—
Those who are virtuous can glimpse it.
Wisdom practices the Six Perfections,
Transcending the Three Realms,
Delivering from the nine shades of suffering—
Thus it is called the Six [Virtues].

First, the power of diligence;
Second, the power of faith;
Third, the power of quiescence;
Fourth, the power of perseverance;
Fifth, the power of refining cold;
Sixth, the power of renouncing wine and lust.

The *Sutra of Dispelling Demons*—
Thus one dissolves the Three Nets.

Breathing nurtures the cloud-sprout.
Those of the first attainment—
A hundred words cannot cure them.
Those of the second attainment—
A thousand words cannot alter them.
Those of the third attainment—
Ten thousand words cannot reach them.
Those of the fourth attainment—
The ten directions cannot sway them.
Those of the fifth attainment—
A hundred methods cannot constrain them.
Those of the sixth attainment—
In utter silence, vast and boundless.
None but these six may compose true scripture.
All outside the Orthodox Dao are called deviant texts.

The Six Penetrations—
First, the eye’s penetration: *all-penetrating vision*,
Gazing upon the Three Honored Ones,
Undisturbed by the five colors,
Neither yin nor yang,
Neither small nor great,
Nothing unseen.

Second, the ear’s penetration: *all-penetrating hearing*,
Receiving the Three Treasures,
Unobstructed by the five tones,
Neither pure nor turbid,
Neither sharp nor dull,
Nothing unheard.

Third, the nose’s penetration: *all-penetrating emptiness*,
Neither old nor new,
Neither sinking nor floating,
All distinctions known.

Fourth, the mouth’s penetration: *all-penetrating void*,
Desiring to taste the sweet dew,
The wondrous Dharma surpassing cinnabar,
No craving for flesh or strong flavors,
Neither fear nor dread,
Neither hard nor soft,
No action unperceived.

Fifth, the body’s penetration: *all-penetrating subtlety*,
Neither broad nor narrow,
Neither inner nor outer,
All thoroughly fathomed.

Sixth, the mind’s penetration: *all-penetrating clarity*,
Irrigating the five spirits,
Scouring the ten desires,
Neither noble nor base,
Neither Dao nor worldly,
Nothing left unilluminated.

Unstained by defilement,
With the supreme medicine, one heals the madness of burning deviance.

The qi of the Six Awarenesses
Ever flows through the Six Wisdoms—
Heaven: *all-penetrating vision*,
Earth: *all-penetrating hearing*,
East: *all-penetrating emptiness*,
West: *all-penetrating void*,
South: *all-penetrating clarity*,
North: *all-penetrating turbidity*.

This adept bears the jade-name of the Supreme Ultimate,
Alone strides the Jade Capital,
Transcending the Three Realms—
How majestic the office of the Celestial Mountain’s Immortal Lord!

The markings of the Mysterious Metropolis are no empty boast.
*The Fundamental Vows and Precepts*:
Within the primordial lies the wondrous,
Refining the false into the true.
Heaven establishes yin and yang,
The Three Sovereigns.

The Heavenly Thearch Lord,
The Supreme Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen,
The Heavenly Thearch Lord of the Grand Tenuity,
The Posterior Sage’s Ninefold Mysterious Lord of the Golden Watchtower—
Having purified through fasting for three months,
Profound contemplation stirs the Great Stillness,
Accumulated devotion awakens the Supreme Clarity.
Thereupon, the radiance of jade halts its splendor,
The ninefold *mystic* scriptures coil in sequence,
Hidden mushrooms weave their blossoms,
Night-born treasure-light arises,
*Excess dissipates, clarity descends*,
The primordial Dao advances with its companions,
Sipping the nectar of Great Harmony,
Grace flows through the jade tablets.

*The Supreme Simplicity of the Numinous*:
The first jade maidens were not true—
Only the fourth jade maiden,
Upon whose nose rests a grain of white jade,
Is the true Mysterious Jade.
The Numinous Sovereign discerns your intent—
The Supreme Ultimate has inscribed your name upon the jade tablets,
In the Green Script and Purple Void’s palace,
The Golden Book and Floral-Bound Pavilion.
Your name is carved into the cinnabar script of the Supreme Clarity’s brocade register,
Appointed as the Supreme Void’s Primordial Lady,
Controller of Destinies of the Supreme Clarity,
Further bestowed the title of Mountain’s Honorific,
Ennobled as the Lady of the Southern Marchmount.

How majestic the virtue of the Great Perfected!
How still the cause of non-arising!
A hundred rivalries smoke and rise,
Ten thousand currents branch and diverge—
Yet within the Mysterious, the virtue of awakening
Self-accomplishes the sage and Perfected.

The advent of the Great Cycle brings the Great Authority,
Following the times, one receives the mandate of the Three Heavens—
Those who serve as the world’s teachers all practice the Orthodox Dharma,
Receiving the mandate of the Six Heavens.
Those who serve as the world’s teachers all practice the Dragon Dharma,
Whether great or small, each bears a heavenly mandate.
Adapting to the world’s transformation, acting or concealing as the times demand,
Every thought resides in the heart.
Nine years of diligent cultivation make one a Perfected of the Great Simplicity,
Transforming form and altering substance in a thousand myriad instants.

To augment or complete the scriptures invites profound calamity.
The *Langshu* states:
*"The Way of No-Nothingness abides not even a day,
Its meaning reaches the utmost Mystery upon Mystery."*

The *Jade Capital’s Supreme Jade Sutra*
Is the ancestor of all scriptures.
The Supreme commands its transmission to the Lords, Kings, Earls, and Ministers of the Immortals.
This Great Dharma is transmitted to one person every forty thousand kalpas.

I, having received the scripture and attained Perfection,
Have commanded the Three Accumulations to bestow it upon four,
Together with you, making five.
The *True One’s Natural Scripture and Oral Instructions*:
As a token of transmission, inscribe one copy of the scripture,
Passing it to one, ten, a hundred, a thousand—
Yet the original text remains intact.

The *Fixed Resolve* states:
Among a million people,
One may obtain this text, possessing immortal scriptures and immortal registers—
Such is predestined fate.
After forty years of study, transmit this text,
Enter the famous mountains, wander the eight directions,
And none among heaven and earth’s spirits dare obstruct you.
The superior adept ascends as an immortal,
The lesser adept attains liberation through the corpse.

The *Three Sovereigns*:
The immortal youths attending the scripture,
The Lords of the Immortals inquire.
To receive the Dao without reverence or mindfulness of the master
Invites the Three Officials’ mockery.
To recklessly divulge it binds seven generations in the prisons of hell,
While the self suffers the trials of the Three Evils.

Kings and lords who uphold the scripture
Preserve their ancestral temples and secure their states.

The *Ninefold Subtle Supreme Perfection* transmits the *Scripture of Wisdom and Insight*:
The Grand Master of the Great Ultimate, the Lofty Immortal King of the Supreme Ultimate.
To transmit the scripture without faith is called transgressing the Dao of Heaven.
To transmit without proper lineage is to divulge Heaven’s treasures.
Patterned after Heaven and Earth—what does not arise? What does not come to fruition?
Patterned after the Yangtze, the Yellow River, the Huai, and the seas—what waters do not flow? What streams do not course?

Only when one bears the immortal countenance above,
Filial piety within,
And wisdom and clarity below
May one receive the scripture.
A single moment of sincerity—
Human and divine alike respond in kind.

From the Dragon Han era to the Crimson Brightness,
Through the long night of the Nine Dark Realms,
Those who attained liberation—
Their names are all inscribed in the Southern Mound Palace, the Nine Capitals, and the Upper Registers.
Eradicating the qi of the Nine Yin,
Their names are recorded in the Eastern Florescence.

Gazing toward the Eight Paths of the Mystic Radiance,
Seven revolutions of the Heaven-Weaving Scripture—
The Supreme Eightfold Simplicity Perfected.
Within a single heaven:
One becomes the Most High,
One becomes the Lord Sovereign,
One becomes Laozi,
One becomes the Heavenly Master.
Emerging from the Three Realms,
Externally aiding the Nine Heavens—
The Lords of the Immortals attain the Dao,
The Three Masters come to deliver,
As the Seven Jeweled Mountain is illumined by the sun.

With heart opened and mind enlightened,
Offer fragrant oil, paper, and brush
To the field of blessings.
O noble one of abundant virtue!

Offering gold and treasures to present the Writ of the Perfected.
One Master of the Three Caverns—
Surpassing the Yellow and Red Dao by eleven thousand.
Cinnabar radiance illumines the Cloud Court,
Purple mist glows in the Jade Grove.
Resplendent, the Seven Jeweled Brush,
Dazzling, it sways with numinous sound.
Gong and shang harmonize of themselves,
Pure fragrance scatters upon one’s lapels.

Through accumulated Dao, one becomes an immortal of Tortoise Mountain.
The Cinnabar Sovereign soars with the Dark Purple Writ—
Bubbling Jade, unpossessed treasure.
The name of the True Dao:
The Emperor’s Chart and Jade Register.
In the distant heavens of the Nine Empyreans,
White tablets and blue-green registers—
The Supreme Sage Lord receives them in the Nine Voids,
Binding the Flying Dark Sash with qi’s spontaneous script,
Recording the names of later students who attain immortality,
Inscribing them in the Hall of Vast Numinosity.
None but the Supreme Sages can comprehend or read them.
After seventy years,
They are inscribed at the northern source of Kunlun’s secret cavern,
Each character a zhang in size.

The Immortal Stair ascends above the Nine Capitals,
Where the Jade Register’s main ledger records the names of those who attain the Dao.
The student’s name is entered in the Azure Palace,
Yet without a gold tablet or jade script,
One cannot be appointed Immortal Attendant or Director of the Jade Bureau.
Those who are diligent and reverent—
All have their names memorialized to the Jade Emperor,
And the Three Primes and Eastern Florescence of the Most High then dispatch the transmission of their true scriptures.
None among the later sages and host of Perfected fail first to present a gold tablet to Eastern Florescence,
Or cast a jade missive to the Upper Clarity,
Before receiving the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*.
Unlearned disciples—
Their blue-green scrolls bear no name in the Gold Register,
Their jade ledgers no script of the Dark Writ.
They cannot unfold the divine scriptures,
Nor will jade maidens guard their bodies.

Those who study the Perfected receive the *Eight Simplicities Scripture of Dark Clarity*—
All have the Supreme Emperor,
Their names recorded in the Western Florescence Palace,
Where jade tablets and medicinal texts are kept in the Purple Palace.
As True Persons, five thousand years before their birth,
They already possessed the Dark Fixed Register,
And were destined to encounter this scripture.
The *Eight Simplicities* of gold marrow and jade bone,
The wondrous Dao of the Lofty Dark,
The secret scrolls of Jade Clarity—
All are conferred upon those of gold names and jade script,
The lofty immortals.

The Heavenly King’s Dark Mirror,
The Seven Sages’ inscribed scrolls,
The Western Tortoise’s fixed register,
The Eastern Florescence’s recorded names,
The Dark Chart and Emperor’s Tablet,
Names inscribed in the Azure Palace—
The Nine Heavenly Kings dispatch the Four Poles’ True Persons
To bestow the imperial writs of jasper script.
The Upper Prime of the Southern Culmen—
The treasured secret writs of jade seals—
Without gold tablets or jade marrow,
Without names recorded in the Emperor’s Chart,
One cannot behold the scrolls’ sequence.
Without a gold name in the Orchid Terrace,
Or cinnabar script in the Purple Chamber,
One cannot see its texts.

The Supreme August’s register of the people’s destiny fixes the True Jade Record.
The Three Heavens’ Orthodox Unity Masters wear it
To determine the names of those who attain immortality.
The Azure Lad daily declares:
The Heavenly Record manifests in the Azure Palace,
Qi and seasons are diagnosed in bodily form,
Green script shines in the Great Ultimate,
The heart’s spirit is rectified in the Purple Chamber.
One who has a name in the Gold Pavilion—
Their eyes possess sunlight,
Their teeth are green, their blood white.
Such a person is benevolent and delights in immortality,
Bright and keen, outstanding and transcendent.

If the Upper Clarity has a gold book and jade record,
Their back bears a mark like the River Chariot,
Their chest has recumbent bones.
If the Great Ultimate has cinnabar tablets and blue-green script,
Their hands bear the characters of "accumulated person" and "inverted great."
If the Square Cauldron has a dark simplicity and purple name,
Their eyes have four rings with purple light within.
If the Grand Clarity has a jade register and crimson name,
Their voice has jade resonance, their mouth square, their eyes round.
If the Grand Clarity has jasper tablets and gold script,
Their belly is white-willed, their mouth emits purple qi.
If the Southern Culmen has cinnabar script and purple records,
Their head generates five qi, ascending to the layered clouds.
If the Dipper contains a dark jade register,
Their heart is cinnabar, their apertures purple,
Yellow blossoms encircle their stomach,
Their mouth exhales fragrant qi, their teeth overflow with jade liquid.
From youth, they delight in gazing at the flowing clouds of sun and moon,
And rejoice in the luminous images of stars and constellations.

If the Dark Capital’s Cinnabar Terrace has white jade and gold script,
Their liver is green, their sinews purple,
Their kidneys azure with patterned veins.
Their breast brims with essence, their body is fragrant and supple.
If the Three Primes Palace has jade missives and blue-green script,
Their brain is purple, their tongue brocade,
Their will dark at the temples,
Their intestines green, their marrow vermilion,
Their forehead square, their brow round.
Their yin possesses hidden bones,
Their apertures three barriers;
Their eyes emit flowing light,
Green essence congeals into liquid.
Their palms bear the curves of fungi,
Their teeth three-edged,
They cherish water and embrace mountains,
Treasure their po and nurture their hun.
All who possess these marks are destined to become highest immortals.

Those next have a dark mountain and black will upon their nose—
Their belly must also have a dark mound to correspond to that mountain,
A red and black will.
Green bones...

Those who delight in the fragrance of the Five Perfumes and are eager to study the affairs of divine immortals—
They walk like cranes and move like dragons,
Their necks bear growths, and they avoid resting their ears upon pillows.
Beneath their morning-concealed lungs lies a blue *zhi*,
Their bodies bear networked patterns,
Their hearts are true, their gallbladders serene,
Their ears firm, their *qi* expansive.
The Dark Province also holds registers inscribed with golden names.

Next are the Three Palaces of Mount Tai,
Where the Dark Record and White Register mark the land of the living,
Not inscribing the realm of the dead.
The Great Yin’s records of life and death are kept in black ledgers, white scrolls, and cinnabar-bound bamboo slips.
When the true tally reaches six thousand slips,
Each person is inscribed in the land beyond death.

Master Jinglin spoke to Hua Cun:
"Now I see your essence—radiant as the dawn, luminous and resplendent,
Your round spirit shines with layered brilliance,
Phoenix bones pierce your brain,
Nine-colored jewel-lights,
Five viscera bound in purple,
Your heart bears bright script.
Thus, your form dwells among celestial mists,
Your spirit communes with the numinous realm."

*The Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign*
*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Dao-Treasures, Scroll One* (conclusion)

*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Dao-Treasures, Scroll Two*
**Heavenly Rank, Third Chapter**

No divine writ surpasses the Three and Five:
The sun, moon, and Northern Dipper as Three,
The five stars as Five.
The Great One
Is the celestial script, the Primordial Unity.
Heaven covers, earth bears,
All things arise between them.
Heaven and earth are the constancy of the Great Dao—
Heaven’s constancy is the One Heaven,
The Dao’s constancy is the One Dao.
*Qi* transforms into nine,
Thus there are the Nine Heavens,
Eighty-one heavens in all.

Heaven has Three Mysteries:
The sun, moon, and stars,
Above which are the Three Essences.
The Heaven of Purple Celestial Essence
Abides within the Great Primordium,
The *qi* of the Three Primes above the path of the Upper Radiance.
The Three Luminaries above
Form the celestial script.

Disasters have three ranks:
First fire, second water, third wind.
Nothing under heaven is eternal—how could anything be unyielding?
After the great transformation,
When four or five suns rise,
Rivers and streams dry, the great seas run empty.
When six suns rise,
All things perish,
Like rendered fat.
Heaven and earth shatter, yin and yang cease.
After nine generations, life begins anew.
A great wind comes from another realm, from between the sun, moon, heaven, and earth,
Bearing clouds to the Eleventh Heaven,
Above and below vast as two chariot wheels.
For tens of millions of years,
Heaven rains, and the waters rise to the Eleventh Heaven,
Surrounding it on all sides with great floods,
Held in place by encircling winds that prevent overflow.
The winds blow the waters for billions of years,
Generating thick foam that transforms into seven treasures:
First yellow gold, second white silver, third lapis lazuli,
Fourth crystal, fifth coral, sixth fine jade, seventh giant clam.
Chaotic winds scatter these seven treasures,
Up to the Eleventh Heaven,
Down to the Thirteenth Heaven,
Fashioning the Ninefold Heavens,
Where the heavenly people dwell.
Later, the winds blow the waters,
And the foam congeals into seven treasures,
Gathered in the heavens to form Mount Sumeru of jeweled treasure,
Three million three hundred thousand *li* high.
Again, the seven treasures—crystal and yellow gold—
Are gathered to build the sevenfold city walls of the Sun King.
Again, two treasures—white silver and lapis lazuli—
Are gathered to build the sevenfold city walls of the Moon King.
Again, one treasure—crystal—
Is raised forty thousand *li* high
To build the abodes of the gods beneath the heavens.
The great winds govern and propel them,
Like floating clouds,
Called stars.
The largest span four hundred eighty *li*,
The smallest forty *li*.
Again, seven hundred Mount Sumerus of jeweled treasure
Are gathered on four sides to form eightfold treasure mountains—
Yellow gold, white silver, and the like.
The winds transform the remaining waters into thick earth,
Whose foam hardens into adamantine mountains,
Six million seven hundred twenty thousand *li* high,
The palace of the Three Sovereigns.

The Great Sage and Venerable Spirit
Knew not of fifty-five heavens,
But spoke only of forty-nine layers of heaven.
The upper six heavens are lodged within the *qi* of the Dao,
For the Dao resides above the Three Heavens,
Beyond the Heavenly Web.
From the lowest, one attains the first heaven,
Named Yi Heaven, styled "Luminous Clarity."
The highest of the Three Heavens
Is named Supreme Primordial Ultimate Great Dao High Yi Heaven,
Styled "Primordial Upper Three Heavens."

The Jade Capital Terrace
Floats above the Supreme Great Heavenly Web,
Now present, now absent,
Now existent, now nonexistent.
The Great Heavenly Web—
Jade and forest wings surge through the mysterious,
Sun and moon gleam with numinous splendor.
Flying immortals ride emerald *qi*,
Mounting radiance and riding purple mist.
Lush and luxuriant, they emerge from the script,
In profusion—divine treasure immortals.

The Three Clarities’ Heavens
Lie beyond the Three Realms.
Immortals dwell in the Great Clarity,
Perfected Ones in the Upper Clarity,
Sages in the Jade Clarity,
Each with their own natural palaces.

The Three Heavens:
Great Crimson Heaven, styled Great Clarity,
Its cavernous emptiness *qi* connects to the lower rank;
Yu Yu Heaven, styled Upper Clarity,
Its purple emptiness *qi* connects to the middle rank;
Clear Tenuity Heaven, styled Jade Clarity,
Its jade emptiness *qi* connects to the upper rank.

Emerging from the sea of life and death,
Ascending the mountain of non-leakage,
Arriving at the shore of the Great Clarity,
Receiving the flow of the true Dharma,
Gazing into the four directions—profound and boundless—
Thus it is called Cavernous Mystery.
The ultimate within the gaze
Is difficult to proclaim.

Practicing the Way of the Jade Clarity,
One emerges with all the heavens’ immortals as an escort,
Attended by jade lads and jade maidens,
Bearing five-colored banners,
Riding purple clouds and driving twelve jade dragons,
Phoenix songs leading the way,
Mystic swords following behind,
The Six Masters opening the path,
Flying dragons flanking the chariot—
A rank equal to the highest immortals.

Practicing the Way of the Upper Clarity,
One emerges with the Five Constellations as an escort,
Attended by eight hundred jade lads and maidens each,
Bearing five-colored banners,
Riding a dragon chariot through flying mist,
Nine phoenixes wailing ahead,
Eight simurghs singing behind,
The White Origin opening the way,
The Supreme Ultimate’s victorious chariot—
Thus, among the perfected there are high and low,
And in ascending the mysterious, there are steps and ranks.

The Great Primordium links to the Jade Clarity,
The Three Luminaries illumine the high and bright.
The Eight Winds revolve the morning breeze,
Golden light crowns the celestial essence,
Jade splendor binds the Five Elders,
Purple mist drives the celestial plow.
Riding the *qi*, swaying through the mysterious chambers,
Yielding to the branches, emerging from the script.
Roaming freely in the Upper Clarity—
A hundred thousand kalpas are but a single day in the heavens.

*The True One’s Natural Formula*
Rising in body to the Great Clarity,
Transcending radiance and soaring beyond the purple dawn.

Ten thousand kalpas are but last night,
A thousand pillars like the morning court.
Precepts and wisdom magnify the Great Primal Chaos,
The mysterious steps rise on the whirlwind’s lift.

Three *qi* beget three—
Thus are the Nine Heavens named.
The root of the Nine Heavens
Holds three as supreme.
The heavens of the Nine Heavens,
With the Three Upper Heavens, form the Twelve *Qi*.

First, the Supreme Primordial Radiance, the Formless Heaven—
The Upper *Qi* of the Mysterious Clarity.
The Mysterious Brahma, Jade Void Heaven.
The Upper Void, Crimson Heaven.
The Great Brahma, Mysterious Origin Heaven.
Jade Emptiness, the Profound and Still Heaven.
Treasure Brahma, the Formless Mysterious Wonder Heaven.
Cloud Brahma, the Flowing Essence of the Middle Primordium Heaven.
The Upper Profound, the Boundless Heaven.
The Great Brahma, the Mysterious Essence Azure Heaven.
Purple Void, the Upper Primordium Heaven.
The Great Brahma, the Dao-Virtueless Heaven among the Nine Heavens.
Nine Spirits, the *Qi* Heaven.
The Nameless Utmost Extreme, the Brahma-Voice Heaven.
The Cicada-Silent Heaven.
Empty Brahma, the Central Heaven.
The Supreme Ultimate, the Boundless Purple Void Profound Heaven.
Verdant Brahma, the Natural Heaven.

The Four Heavenly Sounds—
The Thirty-Six Heavens share their names,
Born before the primordial *qi* of the Hollow Void,
Inscribed upon Kunlun’s mountain.
The Highest Ones chant their jade scriptures,
The Upper Ministers gather their wondrous chapters.
Above, they mark the Mysterious Chart;
Within, they hold pure the Six Offices and Thirty-Six Sounds;
Below, they govern the Nine Lands and Thirty-Six Earthly Sovereigns.

The numinous chapters flow unimpeded,
The jade tones gleam with spirit-freshness—
All are the wandering songs of the Heavenly Kings,
The treasured scriptures of the Hollow Mystery.
Six by six, their rhymes unite;
Four by four, they align with the perfected.
Nine by nine, the emperors divide—
Thus are the Thirty-Six Heavens named,
Above reaching the boundless and infinite,
Below plumbing the fathomless abyss of the Hollow Source.

None among the flying immortals and transcendent perfected
Who do not receive the jade tones
May wander and behold the boundless scriptures.
Those who obtain the scriptures,
Whose names are inscribed in jade books,
Whose characters are carved on purple tablets,
Whose records are bound in the Jade Dawn—
After thirty-six years of carving,
They attain the rank of Upper Immortal,
Ascending to the Heaven of Primordial Radiance above,
Plumbing the Nine Lands’ source below.
Like silver, like jade—
They gain a body of cold-hued essence.

The Six Demon Kings of Heaven:
First, the Crimson Void Heaven;
Second, the Supreme Clarity Capital Heaven;
Third, the Vast Heaven;
Fourth, the Great Mystery Heaven;
Fifth, the Great Mystery Azure Heaven;
Sixth, the Great Clarity Heaven.

The qi of the Primordial Highest Jade Emperor of the Primal Cavern’s Great Non-Being,
The qi of the Crimson Primal Non-Being’s Highest Jade Void,
The qi of the Dark Serene Mysterious Pervasion’s Highest Jade Void—
Though their years differ and their names vary, their root is one.

Without light, without form,
Without shape, without name,
Without color, without trace,
Without sound, without voice—
Accumulated yang forms heaven,
Accumulated stagnation forms earth.

The Three Qi are the honor of heaven and earth,
The Nine Qi are the root of heaven and earth.
The Three unite to perfect virtue,
The ultimate of heaven and earth.

The Five Phases array their positions,
The warp and weft of the Eight Poles—
Heaven and earth’s length and breadth.
The upper qi is the Beginning of Day, its color true azure;
The middle qi is the Origin, its color true white;
The lower qi is the Mysterious, its color true yellow.

The qi of Supreme Harmony, the Great Obscurity,
Lies above the Nine Heavens—termed the Obscure Qi,
Utterly remote and cut off,
Balancing the Nine Mysteries.
Only by reciting the *Great Cavern Jade Scripture* may one commune with it,
Whereupon the Jade Emperor mounts the Cinnabar Clouds to initiate the Dao,
The Great Obscurity dons green radiance and shines resplendent.
The halls of golden ramparts fill,
The courtyards of cloud-pearls receive the perfected.

Within the Three Primordials’ Palace,
The qi of Three Flowers arises,
Like the radiance of hibiscus,
Mysterious hues in the void.
Within the Origin’s Celestial Cycle,
There is a Golden Watchtower,
Wherein dwells the qi of the Upper Effulgence.
Its qi and color luxuriant,
Purple mists swirl,
Its brilliance illumines the ten directions,
Clouds shade the Golden Watchtower—
The gathering place of later sages.

Condensed qi forms purple radiance,
Cinnabar clouds mirror the azure sky,
Spread in the southwest’s turning.
The Three Mornings brighten the Seven Luminaries,
The constellations array the Grand Tenuity.

The Three Ones’ Primordial Lords
Each possess true qi,
Forming a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,
Cloud carriages and feathered canopies.

The upright qi of the Twenty-Four Spirits—
Scattered, it becomes clouds and mist;
Gathered, it becomes form and shadow.
Issuing forth, it transforms into immortals;
Entering in, it becomes the True One.
Above, it binds the Three Primordials;
Below, it binds the myriad things.

The two qi part and unite,
Governing things in their seasons.
The Three Ways wax and wane,
Emergence and retreat follow fate—
The Nine Mysteries’ Dao Lords of Later Sages arrange the records.

The sun is the essence of yang, the eldest of virtue.
Virtue is that to which the myriad things return.
The sun rises in the east, and the myriad things also emerge in the east;
The sun flourishes in the south,
Sets in the west,
Hides in the north—
All things follow it.
The sun’s home is in the south, its position at noon.
In the fifth month, yin qi stirs within—
A minor waning.

The sun’s breadth spans two thousand thirty *li*,
Golden divisions,
Water essence’s halo within,
Flowing light shining without.

Within it lie walled cities and people, seven-jeweled bathing pools, where blue, yellow, and white lotuses bloom. The people stand twenty-four feet tall, clad in crimson robes, their flowering synchronized in decline and flourishing. Five winds govern the sun’s movement, thus ordering the sun, moon, and constellations in their celestial courses—all perfected by Brahmā.

Its framework: above the Golden Gate, the sun’s passage is the Open Portal. Within the Golden Gate lies the Pool of Refined Golden Essence, situated at the western pass, to the left of the division. Thus, on the day of *Lìchūn*, the solar spirit is further refined within the Golden Gate, its radiance shining beyond for forty-five days before ceasing. It proceeds in sequence to the Cavern-Yang Palace, the sun’s upper abode. On the day of *Lìxià*, it halts at the Cavern-Yang Palace, exhaling the essence of molten gold to irrigate the Eastern Well, bathing in the luminous splendor. Gathering the Eight Pure qi, it returns to the Palace of Vast Cold, arriving in thirty-five days—the moon’s upper abode beneath the Seven Stars’ floral canopy.

On the day of *Lìdōng*, the solar essence lies concealed within the Palace of Vast Cold. The sun’s yearly circuit completes its measure, crowned and girded in the four directions. The Two Luminaries part and unite; yin and yang wax and wane.

The sun and moon are the celestial and terrestrial ministers of emptiness.

From *Laozi’s Esoteric Canon of the Calendar*:
The sun’s surname is Zhāng, personal name Biǎo, courtesy name Chángshǐ.

From *The Three Sovereigns*:
The Sun-Moon King’s palaces and walled cities.

The eastern, western, southern, and northern spans measure two thousand and forty *li*. The walled city has seven concentric layers, each adorned with bamboo, trees, and groves. The city’s four gates enclose pools and forests where phoenixes, vermilion birds, and flying crows dwell—this is the chaotic wind’s domain and the Sun King’s abode.

At the city’s center stands a palace of yellow gold. On all four sides of the city walls rise golden towers and pavilions, their heights and depths spanning forty *li*. On the fiftieth heaven, beings descend to become the Sun Heavenly King, radiating great luminosity that illuminates the golden towers on all sides, generating five hundred beams of light to shine upon the four directions. The celestial beings of these heavens live for nine million years.

The Perfected of the Nine Heavens call the sun *Zhuóyào Luó*; the Perfected of the Three Heavens call it *Yuánguāng Wèi*; in the Heaven of Grand Simplicity, it is named *Miàojǐng*; the Supreme Perfected call it *Jiǔyào Shēng*. The Supreme Perfected constantly rides the luminous jade wheel, feasting within the sun. The immortals of Great Clarity call the sun *Dàmíng*; the Perfected of the Great Ultimate call it *Míngyuán*.

In the primordial era, within the Heaven of Purple Prime, there was ever a radiant glow, thin as mist—this was the origin of the nine suns, their light akin to that of a single moon. In the Heaven of Jade Worthies, the sun is called *Wēixuán*.

The radiance of the sun and moon is the effulgent bloom of their numinous brilliance. The Crimson Qi King is the divine spirit above the sun, named *Jiāngchē Liángzhī*. Those who know the name of the Crimson Qi King will not die but ascend to the Upper Clarity.

The Lord Lao calls the sun *Tàibǎo*; the Nine Radiance Eastern Perfected call it *Zǐyào Míng*, or sometimes *Yuánmèi*.

The sun’s essence is crimson, square in form yet round in radiance. Each month, it passes five times above the Golden Gate, where the essence of gold, stone radiance, and the water-mother’s flower are refined within the sun’s soul, casting forth eight rays of luminous essence.

The Cinnabar Crucible’s cinnabar qi nurtures celestial essence, firm yet receptive to the yielding. The yin bloom of scorching water, the sun’s primal radiance, is called *Dàmíng*. Nine yang forces coalesce, and twin vapors arise together. Concentrating the spirit and harmonizing the soul, the essence of harmonious qi gives birth to the Five Emperors within. They ride the light to govern form, their heads crowned with dragon-flower kerchiefs, clad in crimson sashes and azure robes. Simurghs and crows flow in mystery, their rosy glow suffusing the azure above.

The Azure Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Yuáncháng Yuán* and courtesy name *Zhàolóng Tāo*, wears a robe of azure-jade brocade and a cape of verdant, feathered splendor.

The Vermilion Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Dānlíng Zhì* and courtesy name *Lǜhóng Yìng*, wears a robe of crimson-jade brocade and a cape of vermilion, feathered splendor.

The White Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Hàoyù Jiāng* and courtesy name *Huíjīn Xiá*, wears a robe of white-jade brocade and a cape of white, feathered splendor.

The Black Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Chéngcáo Tíng* and courtesy name *Xuánlǜ Yán*, wears a robe of black-jade brocade and a cape of black, feathered splendor.

The Yellow Emperor within the sun, whose taboo name is *Shòuyì Fù* and courtesy name *Piāohuī Xiàng*, wears a robe of yellow-jade brocade and a cape of yellow, feathered splendor.

The sun’s inner spirit, the Lady of the Solar Soul, is named *Àixiāo Tái* and governs the Nine Perfected within.

The moon’s domain lies in the north, corresponding to the *zǐ* position; thus, in the eleventh month, the myriad things germinate beneath the earth. The moon’s breadth spans two thousand nine hundred *li*, while its radiant circumference measures seven thousand eight hundred and forty *li*. Within, white silver, lapis lazuli, and crystal reflect one another, divided into sixty parts, their scorching brilliance illuminating the interior. The city walls and populace are arrayed with seven-jeweled bathing pools and forests of eight *qiān* trees growing within.

The people of the moon stand sixteen feet tall, clad in garments of azure hue. From the first to the sixteenth day of the month, they gather white silver and lapis lazuli, refining them in the crucible of scorching light—thus, as the moon waxes, its luminosity grows bright and vast. From the seventeenth to the twenty-ninth day, beneath the *qiān* forests, they gather the blossoms of the three qi to brush the light of the sun and moon.

On the autumnal equinox, the moon lodges above the Eastern Well in the Hall of Vast Spirit, bathing in the Eastern Well’s pool to refine the lunar soul, brightening the eightfold radiance of clarity. It receives the yang essence from the sun’s brilliance and exhales yellow qi into the Jade Pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the jade trees to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yellow qi washes the countenances of the heavenly beings. The autumnal equinox is the day of the celestial assembly.

On the winter solstice, the moon rests in the upper lodge of Vast Cold, nurturing the lunar soul in the Vast Cold’s pool. It absorbs yellow qi into the jade womb and exhales yang essence into the frigid pool. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the azure forests to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yang essence washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.

On the vernal equinox, the moon lodges above the Golden Gate—this is the moon’s gate of numinous communion. Within the crucible of golden essence, it refines the pool of stone radiance and water-mother, adorning its luminous splendor. It irrigates the Golden Gate with yang essence and absorbs yellow qi into the Jade Spring. All celestial beings gather the blossoms of the *qiān* trees to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the sun’s yellow qi washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.

On the summer solstice, the moon rests in the Cavern-Yang Palace, the upper lodge of the day and the moon’s flowing fire court. It refines the eight rays, brightening the solar soul, irrigating the Cavern-Yang with yellow qi, and absorbing yang essence into the Fire Palace. The Eight Pure Perfected all gather the forests of azure emptiness to brush the light of the sun and moon, while the moon’s yang essence washes the countenances of the heavenly beings.

The moon’s surname is *Wén*, personal name *Shēn*, courtesy name *Zǐguāng*. From *The Three Sovereigns*: The Moon Heavenly King’s abode is a palace of lapis lazuli. On all four sides of the city walls rise golden towers and pavilions, six hundred and forty *li* in height. Beings from the fifteenth heaven descend to become the Moon Heavenly King, radiating great luminosity to illuminate the world without cease.

The *Eight Qiān*—trees of the moon, also called the King of Medicines—comprise eight trees in total.

The moon’s radiance is yellow, square in essence yet round in form, revolving and waxing, its circuit complete yet ever waning.

On the fifth, fifteenth, and twenty-fifth days of each lunar cycle, the moon bathes in the numinous radiance above the Eastern Well, adorning its essence and refining its luminous brilliance, so that its golden splendor shines anew. The Dark Canopy scatters the numinous majesty of the King of Spirits; the Three Purities open the circular path, and the golden blossom illumines the vermilion moon.

**Lady of the Bluegreen Emperor in the Moon**
Her taboo name is *Éyǐnzhū*, her style *Língyàn Yīng*. She wears a robe of azure-flowered jade brocade and a shawl of kingfisher-green embroidered with soaring dragons and phoenixes.

**Lady of the Red Emperor in the Moon**
Her taboo name is *Yìyìliáo*, her style *Wǎnyán Xū*. She wears a robe of cinnabar-and-jade brocade and a shawl of vermilion-flowered phoenix-patterned gauze.

Her taboo name is *Qīngyíng Jīn*, her style *Jiǒngdìng Róng*. She wears a robe of yellow cloud-and-mountain brocade and a shawl of green phoenix-feathered embroidery.

**The Nine Stars**
The Nine Stars are the numinous roots of the Nine Heavens, the luminous beams of the sun and moon, the abyssal palace of the ten thousand kinds. Heaven possesses nine *qi*, with the Nine Stars as their spiritual pivot; Earth possesses nine provinces, with the Nine Stars as their divine sovereign; humans possess nine orifices, with the Nine Stars as the mansion of destiny; the nine palaces of yin and yang have the Nine Stars as their gates; the Five Peaks and Four Seas have the Nine Stars as their abyssal palace. The Five Nines array in ranks, revolving through the Three Luminaries to harmonize the Four *Qi*. The Supreme Emperor employs them to commune with the perfected; immortals rely on them to attain transcendence; the Five Phases ride them to achieve their measures; the ten thousand kinds receive them to attain life. When heaven is clear and earth is still, the Nine Stars blaze with brilliance. When heaven is turbulent and earth obstructed, the Nine Stars darken and dim. The Jade Armillary summons the kalpa’s destined cycles; the Celestial Pass governs the *qi* of the Five Phases.

**The First Star: Celestial Pivot**
The spirit-soul of the Yang Brilliance Star, the Celestial Pivot is majestic yet does not blaze, luminous yet does not shine. It permeates the Great Void, spanning nine hundred and twenty *li*. Opposite the northwest gate of the Yang Brilliance Star, this star is called *Kuí Jīng Xuán*. The August Lady of the Supreme Perfected, surnamed *Míngtōng* and taboo-named *Shàngzhēn*, wears her hair in a soaring-cloud chignon. She is clad in a robe of purple, yellow, and azure brocade, girdled with a nine-belled sash, and exhales a radiance of blue-green *qi*.

**The Second Star: Celestial Rotation**

The *Seven-Colored Precious Clouds* from the *Cloud Scripture of Life’s Passage*.

The qi of Kunlun Mountain manifests in five colors, as recorded in the *Laozi’s Hidden Scripture*.

Where they gather is called a Cloud Encampment. From the Jade Chamber of Supreme Purity arise the Seven Treasures’ clouds, their hues layered tenfold, their qi fanning in nine directions. Only the Perfected Youth Xuanni may ride these precious clouds to ascend into the Heaven of Jade Purity. The one who wards off evil is the spirit within the Great Tenuity; Xuanni is the spirit of Jade Purity.

When the Lords of the Three Origins set forth on their journey, the bright sun inclines its radiance, the Eight Winds surge through the waves, their joined splendor spanning ninety thousand leagues.

**The Seven-Colored Precious Clouds**
The Elder of the Lower Emperor drinks the mist of the Seven Celestial Spirits and feasts upon the light of the Cavern Heavens.

**The Azure and White Dew**

The Sky Unbroken averts famine years. When Heaven and Earth achieve harmony, sweet dew descends. Drawing from the dark canal’s sweet dew transforms white hair and restores square pupils.

**The Great Cavern**
When yang qi reaches its transformation, snow turns to rain; when yin qi reaches its transformation, rain turns to snow.

**The Crown Prince**
In the northwest stands the Sky-Sustaining Fire—Pillar; wind descending from above brings cold. In the northeast stands the Sky-Sustaining Stone—Pillar; wind descending from above brings frost. In the southeast stands the Sky-Sustaining Fire—Pillar; wind descending from above brings warmth. In the southwest stands the Sky-Sustaining Charcoal—Pillar; ash-laden wind descending from above saps human vitality.

The wind’s banner flutters, whirling canopies dance, jade trees strike resonant tones, and jade-like grasses sound as flutes. When divine winds converge in the four directions, yin and yang achieve harmony, and timely rains pour forth.

When the people long for rain, the Immortal Duke possesses talismans in the village shrine; when Heaven and Earth darken, great rain falls.

**The Northern Realm Below Heaven**
Heaven rains the Eight-Flavored Waters, washing the human body free of filth.

Surnamed Guo, styled Junwu.

**The Three Sovereigns**
Kan and Li form the north and south.

The thunderbolt’s might is thus achieved. Thunder and lightning are the essence of fire. The Southern Emperor spurs the lightning—"Swiftly expel my defilements, let no poisonous heat assail the cinnabar essence, let the numinous winds prevail."

The Eight Winds play upon the mist, streaming lightning amplifies its power, and the hundred yangs exhale their essence. The Five Elders flank the imperial chariot, the Eight Winds fan from behind, divine lightning leads the way, and jade radiance escorts the wheels. Stirring the hundred yangs gives birth to lightning; drumming the thousand yins releases its might.

**The Great Sage Sovereign**
*Fourth of the Earthly Grades*

Those of earthly talent accumulate yin and congeal dregs, bearing mountains upon their backs. The Most High dons the garb of office.

*The Sutra of Karmic Retribution*

Heaven and Earth: south at *wu*, north at *zi*; east at *mao*, west at *you*. The four void corners lie each ninety million myriad *li* apart. The Earth is ten thousand *li* thick, and beneath it lies the great void’s four corners, where natural golden pillars stand. There are further three thousand six hundred golden axles, each pillar five thousand *li* in girth, all interconnected. The divine winds serve as their strength, thus they can lower the Pleiades and advance or retreat.

*The Inner Transmission of the Perfected*

Earth possesses the Five Powers, the Five Constants of soil—mother of the myriad things.

**The Realm of Zhen’guan**
Its landform resembles an upturned crescent moon.

Beneath Mount Kunlun lie nine earths. Beneath each earth is a layer of water, and beneath each water a layer of wind—thus it continues for nine layers. The present-day tremors of the Earth are the swaying of wind and water. When a ruler achieves great virtue, if grievances and cruelties arise, Heaven and Earth quake in response, and spirits are moved by it.

The Earth is all of glassy lapis, white silver, purple gold, true pearls, and azure jade, interspersed and combined to form palaces of golden millet and the seven treasures.

Coral forms its branches; jade is planted as its roots. The *qian* trees bear fruit; red youths and white jade rings appear. The Three Florescence bloom in vermilion splendor; returning fragrance flows through the Great Mystery. Eight qi fan the breezes into ceaseless song; jade zithers resound in the void to form music. Dragons roar on cloud-wreathed peaks; phoenixes cry on soaring crags. Venomous beasts array in the thousands; serpents stretch a thousand fathoms. Divine palaces stand majestic; numinous immortals teem in multitudes.

East of the Han lands lies Small Chamber Mountain,
Where yellow stone paste, upon ingestion, transforms the body into five colors.
From there, journeying northwest thirty thousand *li*,
One reaches Terrace Mountain, where verdant fragrant cassia trees grow,

*The True Scripture of the Great Cavern*
*The Azure Empyrean’s Empty Song*

The Tree of Nurturing Clarity bears leaves inscribed with purple script. In the Western Jasper Realm stands the Seven Treasures’ Lofty Tree, its crimson fruits and white rings crowned by phoenixes, peacocks, and golden-winged crows, whose voices resound in the six watches of the day. The Primordial Beginning’s Five Elders, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, the August Highest Honored One, and the deities of the ten directions and ten spirits gather in the Upper Hall of the Western Cinnabar Yang Cavern, seated beneath the Seven-Colored Treasure Tree of luminous pearls.

The Golden Root Tree bears fruits of jade essence, its branches inscribed with the thirty-six nations’ tongues and the inner scriptures of all heavens.

*The Foreign Lands’ Dispersed Wonders*

Celestial Summit Mountain is encircled by sevenfold treasure-walled cities, upon which grow Seven Treasures’ Trees, their canopies overspreading the eight directions beyond the walls. Their roots and trunks are of vajra, their branches of patterned jade, their blossoms of bright moon, their leaves of night-glowing radiance, their fruits of giant clamshell, agate, and brain-incense, interspersed with silver, pearls, and jade. Fragrant Trees, Garland Trees, and Melody Trees stand at heights of four *li*, three *li*, two *li*, and one *li*.

*The Three Sovereigns*

In the Non-Directional Realm, trees curve and intertwine, their forms like interlaced dewdrops. Within the Golden Gate stands the Lofty Tree, its yellow qi and yang essence flowing in threefold alignment.

In the Eastern Well’s expanse lies the Hall of Vast Numinosity, where grows the Three-Flowered High-Ringed Tree, towering four thousand *zhang* with branches spanning two thousand *li*. Once in an *effort*, it bears plum-like fruits without pits; those who consume them ascend as flying immortals. Such is the Crimson Tree with cinnabar fruits, whose hues illumine the five viscera.

Where the four yellow waters converge, a single branch of phoenix-brain fruit is planted in a hole one *zhang* deep. After three years, it sprouts a crimson tree like a pine, five or six *chi* tall, its fruits pear-like and white as jade. Eating them grants ascent to the Supreme Subtlety; spittle cast to the ground transforms into azure jade.

*The Purple Writ of the Numinous Book*

Dig eight *chi* into the earth to plant a crimson tree seed, watering it with *huishui*—the elixir of cinnabar. Phoenix-brain is the name of its sap. After three years, a crimson tree resembling a plum grows.

*The Arrayed Records of the Three Heavenly Lords of Highest Clarity*

The cypress is the essence of the Eastern Well, the marshal of ten thousand waters, and the sovereign of a hundred herbs.

*The Mystery Within the Mysteries*

The locust tree is the essence of the Void Star. The privet is the essence of Lesser Yang, its eastern corner formed by the convergence of the four *geng* days and the threefold qi. The plum is the essence of the Encampment Mansion, harmonizing the qi of the east in the first month; the jade among trees, it blooms before all others. The mulberry is the essence of the Winnowing Basket.

The cornelian cherry is the essence of the Great Fire and Heart Star. It grows in mountain ravines and marshes, its square stems bearing leaves in opposing pairs, resembling the union of yin and yang.

The grain tree is the essence of the Horn Mansion.

The Seven Treasures’ blossoms and fruits compose the scriptures and texts of the Three Caverns of Supreme Clarity. Those who consume these blossoms and fruits become Radiant Golden Immortals.

The Water Essence Mountain lies north of a small sea that flows into the great ocean. There is also a layered mountain, four thousand *li* high, upon which water rests. Its base is golden sand, and five-colored lotuses, large as wheels, exude a juice like honey when pierced.

The blossoms of the Azure Forest are the flowers of the sun’s essence and the threefold *qi*.

*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Treasured Mysteries, Scroll Two* concludes.
*The Scripture of the Dao and Its Treasured Mysteries, Scroll Three*
**Chapter Five: On Life and Death**

**In the Womb for Nine Months**
Nine qi coalesce into form,
Spirit and body complete.

**The Tenth Month: Birth**
The Nine Heavens rejoice.
The Great Unity holds the talisman,
The Thearch confers destiny.
The Director of Fates fixes one’s allotted years,
The Five Thearchs oversee birth.

Humans receive the harmonious qi of yin and yang,
And the nature of the Five Phases.

*From the* Inner Chapters of the Mysterious and Wondrous:
The Nine Heavens’ Venerable One addressed the Jade Lads of the Three Heavens, saying:
“The Two Images embrace the true,
Above corresponding to the Nine Mysteries.
Flowing cinnabar undergoes nine transformations,
Qi congeals into essence.
The essence of the Nine Heavens
Becomes the immortal embryo of the human body.
Six wisdoms gestate within the womb,
Modeled upon the Five Numinous Powers—
Together, thirty-six thousand spirits.”

Humans are the dwelling-place of virtue and power—
Thus the divine and human alike are bound by precepts.

**The Fivefold Dao of Spirit and Form**
*From the* Original Birth of Laozi:
“Three Passes guard the Way.”

The Seven Mysterious Fluids course through the meridians,
Sun and moon illuminate the Six Voids.
Mouth and eyes govern their numinous vessels—
Such is the human Dao.

Clouds drift and rain descends,
The Five Causes reach completion.
The Five Causes are the Five Spirits.
The Three Paths are the Three Perfected,
The august deities of the Three Ones.

The Great One is named Wu You Shou,
Styled Gui Hui Chang.
Those who comprehend this attain long life and avert ten thousand calamities,
As jade maidens descend in welcome.

The spirit of the Upper Qi of the Three Primes
Is the Lord of Left Non-Being.
The hun and po are born in the Palace of the Nine Numinosities,
While the divine fluid circulates through the perfection of the Three Qi.
Its ruler is titled the White Prime Cavern Yang Lord,
Also called Vermilion Essence.

The Central Controller of Destiny,
Also known as the Lifespan-Regulating Venerable,
Or Spirit Ancestor, or Numinous Flower.
The Peach Lord of the Gate of Destiny
Is the primal resource of Heaven and Earth,
The numinous ancestor of yin and yang.
The Pass of Gold and Jade, the treasure of the chamber’s portal—
All are governed by the qi of the Peach Lord.

The Three and Five intermingle,
Transforming to give birth to the Five Spirits.
They receive the great numen of the Five Qi,
And the mysterious ancestor of destiny’s tally.

All beings that contain qi
Are born through the Primordial Granary.

*From the* Upper Record of the Primordial Granary:
The Six Dusts—
**Form-dust**: green, yellow, red, white, black, perceived by the eyes.
**Sound-dust**: gong, shang, jue, zhi, yu, perceived by the ears.
**Fragrance-dust**: rank, scorched, fragrant, fishy, putrid, perceived by the nose.
**Flavor-dust**: bitter, sweet, pungent, sour, salty, perceived by the mouth.
**Touch-dust**: soft, rough, light, heavy, firm, slippery, dry, damp, cold, warm, perceived by the body.
**Dharma-dust**: generates mental consciousness; when the mind turns toward dust, the five senses become distinct perceptions, hence the name "distinct dusts."

The Four Great Elements—
Earth, water, fire, wind,
Four principles combining with the four dusts,
Thus named the Four Great Elements.

The Six Houses—
The Wood Spirit of Jia Yin governs hair and bones,
The Metal Spirit of Jia Shen governs teeth and nails,
The Earth Spirit of Jia Xu governs flesh and muscle,
The Wind Spirit of Jia Chen governs breath and respiration,
The Fire Spirit of Jia Wu governs warmth and moisture,
The Water Spirit of Jia Zi governs moisture and luster.
The Six Harmonies together form the human body.

The Wood Spirit becomes the liver,
The Fire Spirit the heart,
The Earth Spirit the spleen,
The Metal Spirit the lungs,
The Water Spirit the kidneys,
The Wind Spirit the gallbladder.
Thus there are the five viscera and six bowels,
Nine palaces and twelve chambers,
One hundred eighty mechanisms,
Three hundred sixty joints,
Four limbs and five constituents,
Triple burner and six trunks—
All in imitation of Heaven and Earth.

*From the* Inner Chapters of the Mysterious and Wondrous:
The Six Roots—
Ear, eye, nose, mouth, body, intent.

*From the* Western Ascent:
The Five Roots—
Primordial wisdom, right contemplation, liberation.

The Five Substances—
Harmonized to form the provisional name "human."

Within the jadelike womb and purple chamber,
The Nine Elixirs ascend and transform amid the fetal sac,
Following the qi of the Nine Heavens.
The purple net binds the embryo—
By karmic destiny, the immortal is born.

*From the* Jade Book of the Grand Empyrean:
The Sun Mother,
Elder Mother of Jade Purity,
Supreme deity governing the fetal sac.

*From the* Jade Scripture of the Great Cavern:
The Primordial Purple-and-White Sovereign Lady
Entrusts the jadelike womb to the purple sac,
Enfolding emptiness and elegance within the jade chamber.

The Heavenly Venerable, Great Sage—
From the outset, the place of rebirth is the jadelike palace,
Luminous within and without,
Abiding in karmic retribution within the womb.

Twenty-eight layers of fruition—
The transformed body emerges naturally,
By the seventh month, form gradually changes,
By the tenth month, sound and voice are complete.

Cloud Mist Adept—
Scion of the Primordial Emperor’s void qi,
Middle son of the Great Emperor,
Embracing the jadelike womb within the jade chamber,
Weaving cloud essence at the golden gate,
Enclosing sun and moon within the purple sac,
Transforming vast dew to congeal the spirit.
On the first day of the third month in the ninth year of the Upper Emperor,
Dawn breaks at Heaven’s Radiance,
Born above the Nine Mysteries in the Heaven of Boundless Treasure,
Beholding the great sun at Cloud Cliff,
Radiating golden countenance from the jadelike pavilion,
Aligning with the imperial foundation in the celestial plan,
Emulating jade elegance from the natural,
Bathed in the radiance of the Nine Numinous,
Anointed with sweet and fragrant jade springs,
Nourished by seven-colored numinous mushrooms,
Fed with nine-times-refined flying frost.
Divine dragons flank his sides,
Jade phoenixes shade his crown,
Purple mist arises above,
Flowing light glows in the neighboring realms.
The Two Symbols temper his strength,
The Three Luminaries harmonize his authenticity.
The divine continent sings of his wonder,
Seven transformations alter his spirit,
Void winds hasten his form,
Returning fragrance disperses his dust.
High in the vast emptiness,
By the misty shores of the Cavernous Waves.

*From the* Jade Book of the Grand Empyrean:
The Dao’s root—Nine Heavens’ Primordial Father.

His form spans seventy million *zhang*.
In spring, he dons the Jade Rage, clad in the Nine Heavens’ phoenix robe of cloud-and-crow, ever riding the azure mist’s flying chariot, attended by twelve winged dragons.
In summer, he wears the Nine Suns’ robe of crimson phoenix and tiger-patterned armor; in autumn, he girds the Warm Dragon Abyss sword; in winter, he transforms into the radiance of solar essence, merging with the purple glow to blend the qi of the primal Chaos and the Two Symbols.

The Dao’s apex—Nine Heavens’ Mysterious Mother—
spans seventy million *zhang*, attended by twelve phoenixes and thirty-six immortals, who bear the essence of the moon and ride twelve-hued clouds.

The Jade Numinous Immortal Mother of the Supreme addressed the Azure Youth:
Before the Prime Minister of Crimson Light, we were born together at the gate of the King’s realm.

The Nine Palaces’ Perfected Ones, *The Original Conduct*:
Eight Sceneries unite in perfection, nine emperors share luminance.
Southward, floating profits; northward, the Cold Palace falls.
Auspicious clouds layer in profound mystery, four directions interflow.
Sacred peaks are no common abode—flying clouds are my dragons.

*The Jade Book*:
Friends are all Perfected Ones;
jade youths are his household.
Ascending into the Grand Clarity, he is the Supreme’s honored guest.
Alone he strides the Three Realms—
the five phases’ qi clash,
the Three Luminaries lose their measure,
yin and yang rage in conflict,
the eight nodes fall into discord,
and thus ten thousand maladies arise.

The ancients alone grasped Heaven and Earth’s intent;
the middle era grasped half;
the latter era grasps nothing.
Within the body’s thirty-nine portals—

*The Arrayed Records of the Three Heavenly Lords of Highest Clarity*:
Revolving through the Three Paths, traversing the Five Roads,
all share the road of death,
vague and dim in the nether gloom.
The Grand Clarity’s Perfected One, Yin Xi, had eyes of solar essence,
his head bore the circular radiance,
his five viscera bore script,
his face bore the seven stars,
above emulating celestial patterns,
below conforming to earthly principles—
thus states *The Inner Transmission of the Primordial Perfected One*.

Within the head are the Nine Palaces and Five Peaks’ immortal lords and brain spirits,
attended by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders in azure robes,
each one inch and two *fen* in stature.

The Supreme’s Purple Azure Left Primordial Lord—
guards the head and face’s domain, barring all malevolent spirits.

The Brow Spirit, Yuan Guang, is the Great Numinous Lord.
Laozi observed the celestial patterns.
The central brow is the White Primordial’s canopy of blossoms,

The teeth are the Stomach Palace’s mighty power.

*The Pure Numinous*:
The tongue is the Primordial Hero’s dragon axle,

settling beneath the tongue to channel the fluid’s source.

*The Scripture of Treasured Radiance*:
The Ear Spirits are the Delicate Maiden,
also named Jade Hall’s official,
the Nine Mysteries’ Perfected One, named Universal Controller,
dwelling in the right ear—spirit of wisdom,
eavesdropping across ten thousand leagues,
entering the boundless palace’s abode,
lush with immortal emperors,
their positions instructing the destined measure,
their mandates aligning with celestial tally.
The Sovereign One’s soul, named Supreme Return,
dwells in the left ear, governing all mechanisms,
three merging as one, equal in radiance.

The ears are the Emperor Lord’s gates of hearing.
Those who hear golden tones and jade sounds—true qi enters;
those who hear the sounds of stringed music—the Six Ding Jade Maidens come to guard.

The Supreme’s Revered Spirit returns to the Flourishing Assembly,
guarding my jade pillow.

*The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*:
The Cinnabar Emperor moves the pearl,
the Vermilion Palace’s spirit,
filling the great hammer’s edge at the nape’s center.

subduing demonic spirits, annihilating the Three Corpses’ forms.
One Perfected of Heaven.
The spirit is tranquil and serene.

guards the adept’s five viscera, ensuring deathlessness.

The Lung’s Youth, named Su Ming,
purifies the adept’s lung-gate within and without,
dispersing the wandering soul and scattered po to Huang Ning.

The heart like a gibbon, or like leaping flame—

The heart as the Yang mechanism.
For the perfected entering mountains, this is essential.

The Supreme One’s Five Spirits,
once merged as one, transform into a great spirit dwelling in the heart,
styled the Celestial Essence-Fluid Lord.

The Vermilion Lord spreads true [qi]—
crimson clouds swirl and refine, five paths and four nodes,
emptily soaring, flowing with the true; revering the numinous spirits,
irrigating the eight encircling [realms], the Red Child bearing the radiance,
all spirits converge in submission.

The Great Yang’s radiant essence—
jade cassia luminously connects, the six qi flow and spread,
illuminating the vermilion court; the qi-palace interpenetrates the true,
the six stomachs flourish with blossoms.

The Lord of Crimson Qi in the Blood—
the Controller of Destiny and the essence-soul spirits,
together guard the blood of the hundred passes.

Golden bones and jade names—
the purple script of Supreme Purity, when fully attained, summons the numinous;
the talisman for summoning the numinous is the talisman of
the Seven Origins’ Liberation.

The Third Perfected of the Bone Joints,
named Jian Li Jun, styled Yi Yu Mei.

The Supreme One knocks the teeth seven times—
for the path of the Ten Luminaries.

Five exhalations to sever the five sufferings of sentient beings.
*The Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious*:

Knocking the teeth, the great resounding of Heaven’s Drum—
summons celestial perfected ones, convenes the immortals of Wei.
Strike Heaven’s Bell on the left, beat Heaven’s Drum on the right,
warding off demonic calamities, a hundred blessings arrive.

*The Hidden Commentary on the Supreme Ultimate’s True Cuckoo*:

One inhalation, one exhalation—
three knocks for goodness.

Flicking the fingers summons the Ten Heavens.
*The Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious*

As one walks the mountains to gather herbs,
with each step, a resonant cough—like the sounding of a chime.

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy commands:
"Let the Two Lords of the Mysterious Unity open the Seven-Step Wondrous Radiance Jade Treasury within the Purple Net,
and reveal the *Golden Writs of Fixed Life*,
bestowing them upon the Supreme Void’s Primordial High Daoist Lords."

Reciting a chapter of the *Riverbank Perfected One*
summons the Most High’s Jade Capital;
all the Heavenly Immortals clasp their hands in praise.

Paying homage to the Azure Lad of Eastern Florescence—
three bows facing north to seek one’s desired divine transcendence,
performed on a *ding-mao* day.

The day the Longevity Bone is born,
the day the Dao of Immortality is accomplished—
such are the Master’s decreed teachings.

The Heavenly Worthy commands the Marshal of the Nine Heavens
to present the *Jade Writs of the Nine Heavens’ Life-Generation*.

The Four Supplements take their places,
the Five Elders oversee the perfected;
the Great One commands the Jade Emperor to intone the covenant,
standing tall facing south,
to deliver them to the Limitless Flying Heavenly Divine Kings.

The Heavenly Worthy confers the scriptures upon the Most High Daoist Lord—
the Guardian of the Way.
Lady Wang of the Supreme Perfected holds the Ten Mystic Spirit Ribbons below,
the Jade Lads of Scripture-Attendants stand to the left,
the Marshal of Supervision and Salvation to the right.
The True Kings of the Nine Heavens hold the Nine-Colored Standards at the center.
The Primordial Lords return the tally thrice;
the myriad spirits arrive as one.
The True Kings face east,
turning the standards thrice in praise.

The Heavenly Worthy rises;
all the Heavenly Great Sages, Perfected Ones, and Jade Maidens bow in unison.
*Golden Essence of the Simplified Writs*

The Heavenly Perfected descend,
the Dao’s qi shines resplendent.
Paying homage to the Three Origins,
attending the Jade Purity,
ascending its terrace,
beholding the divine forms.

The Heavenly Worthy gazes heavenward and smiles—
from his mouth issue two hues of qi, azure and yellow-red,
their radiance piercing the ten directions,
leaving no darkness, no concealment.
Golden scripts in purple characters,
jade texts in cinnabar writs,
glorious within the Three Qi.
The Three-Eight Luminous Spirits,
the Twenty-Four Perfected,
each accompanied by a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders,
hover above the Void’s Mystery,
guarding the numinous writs.
*The Twenty-Four Generations*

The Most High and Lofty Perfected One
shines with a golden countenance, smiling.
Roaming the cloud-lattices,
treading the void to pace the Mysterious Record,
traversing the dust through kalpas.

The Primordial Beginning’s Wisdom of Right Contemplation and Liberation.
The Most High Dao Lord sits upon a great lotus,
while all the heavenly perfected immortals and the great assembly,
each and every one, manifest myriad lotus blossoms—
on every petal, the lands of the ten directions appear,
and within each flower, their kingdoms, courts, and palaces are revealed.

The Dao is that by which heaven is aligned and earth is rectified:
the White Tiger dwells in the West, the Primordial Qi in the North.

The Azure Emperor of the East,
whose constant name is Jing Meng,
wears a robe of azure over a jasper-green brocade flying skirt,
girded with a sash of interwoven kingfisher plumes and numinous cords.
He rides a cloud-chariot of nine azure dragons,
attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Azure Waist,
each bearing blossoms of the verdant forest,
along with nine-colored staff-banners,
as he roams the Eastern Marchmount.

The Vermilion Emperor of the South,
whose surname is Tu and whose name is Dong Dan,
wears a cloud-brocade robe and a skirt of cinnabar script,
adorned with the talisman of the Southern Culmen,
girded with the Eight Radiant Lights of the Vermilion Palace sword.
He rides a flying wheel of crimson mist,
attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Great Cinnabar,
each bearing the solar essence’s threefold qi blossoms,
as he roams the Southern Marchmount.

The White Emperor of the West,
whose surname is Hun and whose name is Zhi Gui,
wears a crown of sevenfold luminous qi,
a robe of white brocade and a flying skirt of cloud-light embracing plain silk.
He rides a cloud-chariot of pristine white,
attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Great Simplicity,
each mounted upon a white tiger,
as he roams the Western Marchmount.

The Black Emperor of the North,
whose surname is Xuan and whose name is Shuo Meng,
wears a robe of black brocade,
girded with the divine transforming sword of patterned body.
He rides a flying cloud-chariot,
attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Great Mystery,
mounted upon flying tortoises,
as he roams the Northern Marchmount.

The Yellow Emperor of the Center,
whose surname is Ma and whose name is Zhong Shun,
wears a robe of yellow brocade and a flying skirt of mysterious yellow cloud-brocade.
He rides a cloud-chariot of golden hue,
attended by twelve Jade Maidens of the Yellow Simplicity,
each mounted upon a flying unicorn.

The August Jade Emperor above,
adorned with golden tiger and phoenix patterns,
girded with the divine tiger jade seal,
abides within the luminous jade cavern.
In his hands he holds the Dipper Star,
beneath the canopy of blossoming clouds,
standing upon the purple mist,
within the Purple Void.

*The Record of Mount Gui* states:

When the Perfected Lord manifested in the world,
phoenixes became household fowl,
and qilins and lions became domestic beasts.
As the Great Assembly neared, the True One emerged—
the grand convocation was held west of Chang’an and Luoyang,
by the banks of the Yellow River and the Marsh of Beneficent Moisture.

The heart is the sagely sovereign of humanity,
a spirit of Heaven and Earth,
sharing the same qi as the sun,
dwelling within the five viscera—
most revered of all.

The Primordial Heavenly King
was born amid the space of the Hollow Cavern,
after seven thousand kalpas,
when Heaven brightened and qi cleared,
and the twin radiances wove their meridians.
The Mysterious Void and Purple Canopy illumined his name,
while the lightning of the Six Qi bore his true form aloft.
Alone he held the tally of the Numinous Talisman,
his jade chariot and wheel of mystery,
his lordly brush and the essence of the Dark Dragon,
flowing and gleaming through the halls of the Lightning Void.
He journeyed east to the realm of Azure Waters and Luxuriant Forests,
rested above in the Nine-Bend Chambers of Blue Mist,
and ascended afar to the Golden Portal,
where he received his title as Lord of Jade Purity.

The Heavenly Son of the Great Ultimate
was once a minor official.
Through yielding and deference, he ascended to rule the world—
the Heavenly Son of the Central Ultimate.
The Ninth Heavenly King
descended to transform and be born as a Son of Heaven.
The world rejoiced greatly, none failed to submit to his rule,
and the Primal Chaos was unified—
a sovereign of supreme virtue.
The warp became emperors, the weft empresses;
the Nine August Perfected Lords,
keepers of the Upper Clarity’s sacred prohibitions,
preside over the Three Primordials of Jade Flower.

The Supreme Unity Lord of the Upper Primordial
governs the ten thousand immortals,
oversees the true qi of the Marchmounts,
removes the registers of death,
and inscribes the registers of life.

The White Primordial Lady
treasures the Dao of the five viscera,
wears a white brocade cloak adorned with dragon patterns,
and a crown of purple canopy and hibiscus.

The Yellow Primordial Lady of Lofty Radiance
possesses a body of golden essence,
and wears a crown of purple-flowered hibiscus.

The Purple Primordial Lady
dons a tiger-patterned cloak of purple brocade,
a skirt of purple dragon designs,
a hibiscus crown of the Purple Dawn,
and a canopy of twin purple-pearl stars.

The Lady of the Upper Primordial
is the mother of the Three Heavenly Perfected Saints,
commanding the names of the Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions.
She wears a green robe with a crimson frost-patterned gown,
bears a fiery jade of six or seven hues,
and wields a sword of flowing yellow essence.

From *The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao*:
The Lady of the Purple Tenuity,
surnamed Wang and named Qing’e,
is the twentieth daughter of the Queen Mother of the West.
Her Purple Tenuity Palace lies beyond the Northern Desert,
in the Feather Bright Wilds of Mount Xuanlong,
east-northeast of Kunlun.
The Lady of the Purple Tenuity spoke to the Queen Mother, saying:
*"Round in form yet square in radiance,
square in essence yet bearing softness.
Radiance conceals within form,
essence hides within image.
Radiance is crimson, image is yellow—
these are the treasures of sun and moon.
If one knows this Dao,
one may exhale and inhale the flowing mist.
At dawn, ingest the sun’s qi;
at midnight, gather the moon’s splendor and store it.
Withdraw it nine inches before your face,
letting its light and radiance illuminate your Mud-Pill Palace,
descending to the five viscera,
permeating the entire body."*

From *The Hidden Scripture of the Cavern of Perfection*:
The Lady Attendant of the Central Candidate.

The Master of the Great Cyclic Wind and Primordial Fusion, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, is the preceptor of the *Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*. The Lady is also called "Little Youth," signifying that the ignorant and unlearned rely upon the Great Lord. Later, the Sage Lord, Grand Master Peng, established the Ministry of the Square Cauldron; the Lord of the Azure Youth ascended to protect the Palace of Great Cinnabar; the Primordial Lord of the Southern Culmen transmitted the Office of White Mountain; the Perfected Lord of Primordial Simplicity governed the Office of the Western City. The Perfected King of Totality, one master with four assistants. The assistants—left aide and right minister, front counselor and rear chancellor—along with the four or five diviners and observers, all serve the assisting master.

When divine beings govern, perfected ones serve as ministers; when perfected ones govern, immortals serve as ministers. In high antiquity, sage emperors and kings served as ministers. Those who employ the words of sages share virtue with Heaven and Earth and harmonize their hearts with the divine spirits.

The Emperor brushes the sun’s essence and purple radiance’s splendor over the divine scriptures.

The Perpetual Divine Maiden of the South, the Purple Nymph of Radiant Grace, and those with countenances of golden-green dragon-flower hues shall attend to the left of the *Billionfold Scriptures*.

From *The Golden Tablet of the Supreme Ultimate with Jade Characters*:

Three thousand worthy maidens, each twenty years of age, having received the scriptures, entered the famous mountains. After six years, they attained deliverance and now reside in the Zhongyang Palace, three hundred li south of the Western Marchmount, two hundred seventeen li from the Duyang Palace.

The Bright Star Jade Maiden governs the revolutions of Heaven and Earth.
The Supreme Harmony Jade Maiden commands the Directing Merit Officers to stand at the four directions, while the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers stand at the center. The Upper Division Officers gaze afar toward the heavens, the Middle Division Officers survey the eight directions, and the Urgent Qi Officers hasten the ten directions.

From *The Numerological Regulations of Dignified Conduct*:

During the six fasting months of the year, the Three Heavens command the Celestial Thearch Taiyi’s envoys, the sun, moon, and stellar lodgings, and the Three Officials to summon and examine the transgressions of all people under Heaven.

From the teachings of the Three Heavens:
The Great Worthies—ten aspirations yield ten attainments.
The Middle Worthies—ten aspirations yield five attainments.
Among the Heavenly Worthies, three possess wealth and nobility:
Nobility is greatest in the absence of guilt,
Joy is greatest in the absence of care,
Wealth is greatest in contentment.

From *Laozi’s Wondrous Truth*:

The soul is honored, the spirit is noble—first among humankind are those who receive this scripture.

In the Southern Mountains there is a Daoist of steadfast resolve.
Unceasing in goodness, his name resounds throughout the kingdom.
The Four Seas embrace his Dao,
Heaven and Earth cherish him,
The hundred spirits benefit from him.
Emperors and kings treat him as a friend,
Neighbors regard him as parents,
His merit shines before Heaven and Earth.

From *The Great Peace*:

In movement, one aligns with Heaven’s heart;
In stillness, one harmonizes with Earth’s intent.
The foremost of the hundred practices,
The finest of the myriad blessings.

If the Central Kingdom lacks good people,
Know that good people descend from Heaven,
And Daoists, too, are born of Heaven.

The Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water record the good and evil of humankind.

From *The Questions of the Immortal Duke*:

The guests of the Supreme Lord are revered among the living.
To "bestow four and relinquish three":
The four bestowals are the four kinds of giving.
The three relinquishments are: relinquishing the self, relinquishing wealth, and surrendering fate to seek the esoteric instructions.

On days of luminous might and auspicious hours,
Make offerings to the Three Honored Ones.
Clarify the mysteries of the plain and the subtle,
Refine yin and yang—
This is the precept against licentiousness.

Golden tones and jade resonance
Awaken future generations.
Speak not at improper times,
Nor expound what is not orthodox.
Words, deeds, speech, and conduct unite with the Dao,
Transcending life and death—
Thus one becomes a teacher to gods and humans.

The accumulation of human kindness prolongs life,
Each thought unwavering.
Though blessings ascend to Heaven,
There may yet be decline.
Though calamities descend to hell,
There may yet be advancement.

The Vermilion Lad, Dragon Net Guardian of the Heavenly Cavern of Luminous Jade Realm—
At Scarlet Phoenix’s Bend, the maiden Natai was given her name at fourteen, captivating an entire kingdom.
The Supreme Purple Void Primordial Sovereign of the Southern Culmen, returning her chariot to the Cinnabar Gleam’s Bend, bestowed upon her a chapter of the *Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script*, the true writ of the southern quarter.

In the primordial era, beside the Azure Jade Stream and upon the Whirlwind Mound, beneath the withered mulberry of the Everlasting Grove, the radiance illumined the ten directions.
Natai beheld five-hued purple light curving to bathe the oratory hall. Climbing the wall to gaze afar, she saw to the east a mulberry grove ablaze with luminous blossoms for hundreds of *li*, yet barred by the Gate of the Scorching Sea at Bright Valley.
She cast herself into the void—
whereupon the Water Thearch’s divine kings bore her aloft on five-colored flying dragons.
In an instant, within the Mysterious Center, she transformed into a man, riding the dragon and urging it through the emptiness.

The Primordial Beginning conferred upon him the imperial title of the Immortal Metropolis.
When the great kalpa reached its extremity and the blue *qi* began its revolution, the Era of Illuminating Light opened at the Brahmā-Nārāyaṇa Terrace, the capital of the Flying Primordial Cloud-Root, the Ruins of the Ninefold Azure Radiance.
The Primordial Beginning then bestowed upon the Azure Numinous Primordial Elder Lord of the Treasure-Flourishing Grove the *Numinous Treasure Scarlet Script*, the true writ of the Nine *Qi* Azure Heavens.

*Fundamental Practices*
The Dhyāna-Pearl World.

There was a woman named A Qiuceng, whose heart brimmed with great compassion, her cinnabar sincerity amassing profound resonance.

In the first year of the Illuminating Light Era, the sacred and venerable deities of the ten directions, along with perfected adepts of wondrous conduct, convened together in the Azure Radiance Grove of the Three Luminaries Terrace within the Vermilion Cinnabar Southern Garden. Amidst floral splendor and celestial music, fifty million beings gathered, the true writs gleaming resplendent like the moon among stars.

At sixteen, Qiuceng bathed herself in fragrant waters. Facing south, she beheld the divine essence blazing like the sun, purple clouds encircling on all sides. She climbed the wall and cast her body forth, hoping her form would dissolve into dust, flying to the Way’s presence. She immolated herself in fire, and in an instant, transformed into a man.

The Primordial Beginning commanded the Venerable Deity of the Southern Culmen to confer upon Qiuceng the Ten Precepts. The Perfected of the Numinous Treasure bestowed upon him three hundred Jade Maidens of Great Florescence and three hundred Jade Lads of the Official Ranks, all adorned with every excellence.

*The Thirty-Two Marks*
His name was inscribed among the heavens. As a tenfold-turned disciple, he bestowed mountains upon the reclusive Daoists. Seven generations of his ancestors befriended the Five Thearchs. His merits were vast, his recompense profound. His boundless generosity flowed across the four seas, honoring masters and revering the Dao. Having recited the scriptures ten thousand times, the Supreme Lord’s dragon-drawn chariot descended to welcome him, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

To yield is to defer—such is the Dao’s recompense. To yield virtue is to defer power. Among people, none are noble or base; those who hold the Dao are revered.

Breathing in harmonious equilibrium, observing precepts and scriptures—there are many paths to the Way, and small efforts may yet achieve greatness.

Let the heart be supple as reeds, that calamities may cease and blessings arise. With a heart of compassion toward the myriad things, one’s kindness pervades all beings.

The highest goodness is filial piety supreme. To yearn for undying guardianship and transform one’s parents—such was the most filial son of the Supreme Thearch of High Antiquity, whose virtue resounded across the four quarters.

*The Great Peace*
His name entered the realm of the Perfected.

*The Dispelling of Demons*

Proclaiming the Dao’s qi, converting the deluded and lost.
Stirring harmonious melodies, the flying cry echoes at the ford.

The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuity
dwells in silent chambers, gazing upon the cold, dark stream.
He plumbs the two images, exhaling and inhaling the soaring rosy clouds.
Contemplating the five luminances to illumine himself,
he moves the radiant glow of rosy hues—rich and lush—
flowing and gleaming through the jade hall and purple chambers.

Returning to truth, reverting to simplicity,
roaming the Great Plain,
observing the lingering customs of the Three Dynasties,
inwardly cherishing gold and jade.

The wanderer
now in mountains, now in waters,
now in the world, now at home,
now in court, now in the wilds.

*The Jade Writ of the Grand Empyrean*
Racing in the three karmas, bewildered by the six passions—
the Supreme Purity of the Perfected.
Deceiving heaven, deluding earth—
the wondrous truth.

Bearing mountains, shouldering stones,
dragging through the eight adversities,
stealing the lives of others in life,
facing calamitous retribution in death.

*The Ordinances of Illuminating Truth*
Inverting yin and yang, violating sun and moon.

*The Bright Years*
Reviling heaven and earth, humiliating the clouds and empyrean,
cursing the winds of the south.

*The Manifest Might*
Demonic paths diverge,
confounding the heart—
death leads to the three wretched destinies.
Entering the crimson-linked hells,
amidst water and fire,
for two thousand *yi* kalpas,
bereft of human form.

Rushing toward peril in water and fire,
disdaining past lives as delusion,
mocking the sacred scriptures as false and absurd.
The mysterious teachings decline,
heaven and humanity drown in suffering.

Disbelieving the great Dharma,
disrespecting the luminous deities,
defiling and scorning the numinous texts—
in death, ascending the sword trees,
where winds from eight directions blow,
swaying the trees low and high.
Feet descend upon the knife mountains,
born with the six afflictions,
revolving through the five torments,
sinking into the fields of sin.

Bestow upon me the medicine of grace
to cure the illness of ignorance,
with words of goodness expounded,
dispelling the darkness of delusion,
that the eye of wisdom may grow clear,
cool and bright,
illuminating the true form.

*The Root and Boundary*
The six passions, once stained...

Through the three wretched realms they revolve,
adrift and forgetful of return;
through the five paths of existence they drift,
long sunk in delusion, never awakening.

*The Settled Will*

A thousand pounds of gold,
a single scripture of immortality—
bestowed upon a barren mountain,
the next life shall surely yield a fortune of gold.
Greed is the great sickness,
not to be cured by moxa or mugwort.
Twenty-five years
of unspent blessings:
the Registrar of Destiny submits the record,
granting seven hundred years of great lifespan.

*The Precepts of the True Root*

Human passions are hard to restrain,
like a banner raised in the wind,
fluttering without cease—
only the sage can still them.
The immortal lads attending the scriptures
report the arrogant to the Three Heavens;
the Registrar of the True submits to the Most High.
Three memorials filed, and you shall lose the Way.

*The Questions of the Immortal Duke*

To judge and slander the Dao and its virtue,
to revile and shame the celestial true:
mouth says one thing, heart another—
the wellspring of a hundred evils.
Karmic stench pervades the heart,
shattering the ten virtues,
fostering the ten evils.
The four thoroughfares lie desolate,
the six penetrations are blocked.
The five spirits run wild,
fondness for wine corrupts conduct.
The three fears, the three calamities—
in death, one descends to the Dark Capital,
examined and bound in the ghostly prison,
revolving through kalpas uncounted.

*The Teachings of the *Laozi***

The five desires—
innumerable thoughts, innumerable beings:
the eye desires to see the five colors,
excess wearies the hun-soul;
the ear desires to hear the five sounds,
clamor torments the hun-soul;
the nose desires to smell the five fragrances,
fragrance overflows and essence flows away;
the mouth desires the five sweet flavors,
abundance muddies the spirit;
the body desires to indulge in the five pleasures,
sloth scatters the will, harms the spleen, and endangers conduct.
The five evils.

**The *Scripture of Numinous Writ for Deliverance of Destiny***

**The Seven Harms**
The August Sage Emperor said:
The first harm—
the spirit weeps in the Exhausted Mansion, its cries ascending on high.
The second harm—
one’s dark name is erased from the registers, extinguished in the Nine Springs.
The third harm—
the Five Mansion’s works collapse, the myriad spirits shudder in alarm.
True immortals soar in lofty flight,
the Red Child wails in sorrow.
Though a dark record exists,
the Jade Name is lost in vain.
The fourth harm—
the hun-soul departs, the po-soul flees,
the nine apertures fill with dust,
the Five Mansion falls to ruin.
The fifth harm—
the Azure Bureau inscribes one’s name,
the Golden Watchtower binds it in its annals.
One scorns the true and cheapens the precious,
reversing the Black Seven Mysteries.
The sixth harm—
the Five Spirits scatter and fly,
the numinous essence loses its radiance.
The seventh harm—
true qi grieves at the Gate of the Numinous,
the wandering spirit startles the Red Child.
Hun and po wander through the palatial abodes,
while true immortals ascend in lofty flight to Jade Clarity.

**The *Nine Heavens of Turning Heaven***

**The Ten Calamities**
One cultivates the practice,
yet fails to uphold the Dao with constancy.
The calamity of serving a master—
one does not remain devoted to the end of one’s days.
The Perfected One said:
Of ten failures, one failure—
the hun-soul wails in the Numinous Mansion,
its cries ascending to the Heavenly Pavilion,
where the Three Bureaus contend in judgment.

**Springtime Hunting**
Spreading nets and casting snares,
setting fires to burn the mountains—
in death, one bears the iron staff,
ten thousand pains converging,
driven to exhaustion through a hundred extremes.

**The *Clarification of the True***

Damming rivers and breaching channels,
spreading nets and dangling lines—
in death, one enters the Mountain of Knives and Forest of Swords,
though wisdom and right contemplation endure.
Life’s span cannot be fully explored,
nor can one harmonize with the heart of Heaven and Earth,
or the intent of yin and yang.
Thus, longevity remains elusive.

Life and destiny—
the most precious treasures of Heaven’s Dao.
Only by possessing virtue in secret
do the Six Directions of Heaven and Earth,
the Eight Distances, and the myriad things
all attain their proper place,
and thus gain an increase in years,
fulfilling one’s allotted heavenly span.
This is longevity.

Within the hollow void, beyond the boundless expanse,
above the utmost heights, below the lowest depths—
thus does one cultivate the Dao through stillness and silence to nurture the body,
through clarity and coolness to pacify the heart,
through sincerity and integrity to uphold one’s resolve.

Dwelling in profound seclusion, abiding in tranquility,
like the hidden coil of the dragon in the deep;
mired yet unsoiled,
like the two luminaries absent from the void;
transforming virtue to preserve the spirit,
like the sacred altars safeguarding their radiance;
establishing reverence for the divine,
like the ancestral temple maintaining its sanctity.

Unseen by others,
like the sacred fish within the vast net;
unknown to all,
like the sun’s rising beyond the east;
my boundlessness,
like the Dao’s limitless expanse.

Though Heaven and Earth are divine,
they cannot restrain it;
though the sun and moon are bright,
they cannot halt it.

**The *Great Peace***
The brain palace filled,
harmonizing the Six Fluids.

**The *Three Primordial Caverns’ Pearl of the Dao***
The palace of life’s court—
the Perfected dwells within the formless,
rests in the neighborless,
and attains the living source of the Mystic Pearl.

**The *Tortoise Mountain Record of Origins***
Longevity equal to the sun and moon.

He who gains the Heavenly Lord’s trust and heart—
a long-lived one, who serves with the celestial gods above.
No reckoning of fate or lifespan,
recorded in the Heavenly Treasury;
within the breast, pure whiteness—
will like flowing water, dwelling like a fortress,
thus attains long life.
Virtue moves Heaven and Earth.

**The *Laojun’s Strategems***
Mastering the Six Arts externally,
settling the Supreme Clarity within;
elixir fluids and mystic wonders,
ascending to the Purple Court.

**The *Ink Record of Cinnabar Tablets***
He who observes the celestial patterns—
names the Three Luminaries,
gazes upon the Three Paths of the world;
sun’s passage, moon’s return,
the Northern Dipper’s nine stars,
two concealed, seven manifest,
measuring the Mystic Ford.

**The *Treasure of the Mysterious***
Yin Xi gazed upward at the celestial patterns,
looked downward to examine earthly principles.
Examining earthly principles—
discerning the Three Colors:
soil, mountains, waters.
Surveying the Five Directions’ precious mystery.
Celestial immortals’ wondrous arts—
numberless beyond reckoning.

**The *Great Peace***
The Golden Watchtower’s Imperial Lord
spoke to the Azure Lad:
"Reveal to you the Way of Celestial Immortals."
Six Arts—
talismans, charts, scriptures, precepts, methods, calculations.
Six Harmonies as one wave,
a thousand pillars as one dream.
Three dawns like windows,
the vault of Heaven like a suspended beam.
Gazing up to pluck jasper blossoms,
stooping to sip from the gem-studded well.
A thousand years but a moment,
ten thousand ages like a flash of lightning;
years pass swift as a startled arrow.
Perfected officials sport at the Mystic Ford,
within the Purple Empyrean’s heart.

**The *Upper Prime Lady’s Song of the Mystic Step***
Once I entered the Dark-True Dao,
stepped lightly to ascend the Great Rosy Clouds.
Shouldering my satchel, I approached the Heavenly Gate,
inquiring of the Supreme Lord’s abode.
Suddenly I met the Purple Tenuity Garden,
where Perfected Ones stood thick as hemp.
Green radiance rose in limpid clarity,
cloud canopies reflecting crimson blossoms.
Orchid chambers veiled the forest towers,
jade chambers opened with gossamer veils.
Cinnabar terraces stood in empty construction,
latitudinal splendor birthing numinous flowers.
Soaring steps trod the ridgepole’s height,
cavernous illumination leaned on winding paths.
Jade embryos presented crimson mushrooms,
nine hues harmonizing of themselves.
Embracing and refining the immortal frame,
through ten thousand kalpas still a child’s teeth.
Who says lifespan has bounds?
Fusang is not yet a stump.

**Poem of the Supreme Cavern Spirit**
By chance the light chariot’s flight canopy,
swift reins floating through the Eight Clarities.
Aligning the carriage to control the Cinnabar Way,
glancing afar to feast in the Cloud Camp.
Dragon pennants gleaming with jade essence,
feathered robes in kingfisher and purple hues.
Surpassing the Six Drinking Terraces,
in profusion delighting in the Phoenix City.
Escorting the Divine Empyrean King,
soaring high to the Supreme Capital.
Gazing up to part the Three Pristine Chambers,
long mists scattering over the Eight Rivers.
The Perfect Dao transcends orchid towers,
the Great Radiance illumines Jade Clarity.
Flowing auroras follow my return,
flying to benefit the courtyard’s green axles.
Ascending high through the Four Gates’ opening,
jade splendor flourishing at the Golden Gate.
Divine radiance pervades Orchid Peak,
the Three Lights already resplendent.
Binding brightness to begin the primal qi,
the Eight Convergences level the hidden source.
Vast and distant at the kalpic dawn,
the Great Yang harmonizes with the morning court.
Numinous transformations in the Four Benefit Courts,
lush as the celestial patterns on high.
A thousand maidens arise without trace,
gathering the sun’s essence-spirit.
Returning the brush to rest in the Cinnabar Chamber,
silently contemplating the Supreme Mystery.
Congealing spirit to grasp the Nine Drinks,
linking watches to continue the long mists.
Three candles illumine the Great Radiance,
in absolute emptiness life stirs anew.
The Jade Emperor’s luminous robe,
rustling to penetrate the Nine Heavens.
Concealing gold in the ultimate verses,
treasuring my Jade Clarity’s chapters.
Azure clouds encircle the Cinnabar Chamber,
scriptural characters gleaming with purple radiance.
Raising my feet over the myriad ford-waves,
with mystic steps ascending the Jade Portal.
Eight winds drum the high peaks,
how towering the cloud forests!
Tall and straight, dragon and phoenix sing,
their commands harmonizing with the Mystic Talisman.
Grasping the tally to summon the Supreme Subtlety.

**The *Sutra of Demonic Destruction***
First bestowing this scripture’s poem—
crimson radiance floating in the dark dawn,
purple ploughs riding the cloud’s journey.
Gazing up to surpass the Golden Watchtower’s interior,
looking down to behold the Western Flower City.
Eastern auroras unfurl jade radiance,
divine light blazing with the Seven Numinous.
Obscuring reflections in the Three Candles,
fragrant mists scattering through the Jade Court.
Hand in hand with the Weaving Maid’s dance,
twin lapels dropping kingfisher green.
Leftward, the patterned feather banners,
flowered canopies following clouds’ tilt.
Feasting and resting beyond the Ninth Heaven,
right and wrong do not concern me.

**The *Hidden Book of the Great Cinnabar***
Fusang’s emerald empty peaks,
crimson numinous blossoms faintly bright.
Azure terraces above the auroral void,
four vistas reflecting lofty clarity.
Flying light controlling the purple wheel,
Three Pristine reins guiding the cinnabar carriage.
Reclining in the Supreme Emperor’s palace,
wailing in the Grandmother’s court.
Bathing and rinsing in the azure rapids,
lifting the jade wine jars.
At dawn’s curve riding the wind’s fan,
shaking the auroras to descend in tilt.
How cold and clear the winding chamber!
Nurturing perfection, awaiting the sun’s completion.

**The *Supreme Primordial Perfected’s Transmission of the Great Cavern’s Mystic Scripture to Xu Xiang***
Eight paths converge in non-origin,
riding the motion to observe the clamorous net.
Empty light gazing upon the jasper carriage,
the Mystic Potter’s crafting of the phoenix song.
Left hand grasping the Jade Flower’s benefit,
flying steps treading the Seven Primes’ threshold.
Three luminaries resplendent with purple radiance,
four directions all one’s own spirit.
Mystic waves shake the azure billows,
great fords drum the myriad streams.
Within clouds revolving the jasper wheel—
why hasten in the dust’s midst?

**Chanting the Jasper Hall**
Six clouds arise at the window.
The Supreme Sovereign’s Master silently chants the Jasper Carriage—
playing with the Three Passes’ luxuriance,
dark chapters unfolding their rhymes.
Sounds resonating with Grand Harmony,
ten thousand songs ending the feast.
Divine light of Eight Radiance,
Seven Qi intermingling to arise.
The Noble Scion harmonizes transformations,
the Imperial Unity congeals form.
Wondrous chanting of divine grace,
numinous tones scattering jade,
cavernous light merging with the Mysterious.

**The *Verses of the Pure and Plain***
Chanting and intoning the Imperial Unity’s honor,
a hundred passages naturally attuned.

**The *Mount Jade Capital Scripture***
Cloud dragons.

When the Dao of Cavernous Perfection is achieved, then it is attained.

**The Venerable Lord of Immortals**
Inquiry to the Supreme Sovereign Jade Emperor:
Chanting the hidden scriptures of Jade Purity,
the jade tones resound in distant clarity,
the resonant verses of Pure Subtlety vibrating—

The supreme radiance emits morning splendor,
golden skies dense with purple purity.
Jade purity illumines the jasper fan,
intoned before the Void-Spirit Perfected.
Hand in hand with the blossoms of the Azure Grove,
revolving the canopy o’er the Great Primordial Court.
Reclining in banquet within the emerald chamber,
soaring steps traverse the resplendent Jade Capital.
Lifting the Crimson Radiance King,
long mists scatter the void encampments.
The Four Kings dwell within which body?
Transformations divide—how could form be singular?

**The *Golden Mystery of Cavernous Radiance***
Poem of the Lady Attendant of the Central Watch:
The Supreme Perfected chant in the jasper chamber,
the lofty immortals sing in the gemmed hall.
Nine phoenixes intone the crimson pipes,
void rhythms inscribe the feathered chapters.

**The *Hymns of the Host of Perfected***
Facing the moon, chanting and sighing—
Nine Sages, Nine Mysteries.

The Dao Lord arranges the records,
the Supreme Sovereign Master joins in chanting the Mysterious Portal of Upper Clarity.
In the purple dawn of Supreme Purity,
abundant virtue brings Great Peace—
naturally summoning qilin and phoenixes.
Pure, cold, and immaculate,
naturally summoning mushroom spirits and jade maidens.
Harmonious and auspicious omens,
naturally summoning good fortune.

**The *Scripture of Laozi’s Precepts***
The Primordial Beginning’s *Cavernous Mystery, Numinous Treasure, Vermilion Script, Jade Chapters, True Writ*—
born before the Primordial Beginning, within the Void Cavern,
the numinous chart already resplendent,
the ten thousand emperors pay homage to the Perfected.
Heaven bestows the Twelve Mysterious Omens,
Earth emits the Twenty-Four Responses.
Above, celebrating the numinous mysteries of the Nine Heavens,
extolling the luminous treasures of the Three Heavens.

The Twelve Omens:
At that time, Heaven and Earth were the root of the ten thousand qi,
the Two Images divided the frame,
thirty-six thousand suns and moons
shone as one, illuminating all heavens,
no darkness left unpenetrated.
The supreme sages, great spirits, and wondrously practiced Perfected
feasted in the Jade Court,
roamed the Great Void,
extolled and recited the numinous writ—
Heaven spontaneously produced celestial music,
hundreds, thousands, myriad kinds,
all arising as one,
stirring the cloud palaces of the Cavernous,
the divine transcendent stags of the upper realms.
Numinous winds chant a hundred hymns,
the empty seats of the ten directions.
Gong and shang harmonize in accord,
all becoming cavernous chapters.

The Celestial Turning Mechanism halts its pivot,
the stellar lodges cease their motion.
Heaven knows no day nor night,
the four seasons dawn as one.
Purple clouds exhale their radiance,
streaming and scattering through all heavens.
Spring and autumn, winter and summer,
the four qi blend in gentle harmony.
The Five Marchmounts rest in tranquility below,
the Seven Treasures’ divine marvels disperse across the earth.
Wondrous forests of the Seven Treasures,
jade canopies cover the Ten Heavens.

The Twenty-Four Responses:
At that time, the primordial Heavenly Origin was in chaos,
no light yet shone,
the morning cock heralded the dawn,
the four scenes grew bright and clear.
Heaven’s mystery and Earth’s expanse unfolded,
giving birth to the Five Phases.
Thirty-six thousand suns and moons,
above and below shone as one,
illuminating without end.
The Azure Crow bore a writ,
announcing the Five Thearchs’ just divisions.
Three Tigers spewed forth gold,
securing and pacifying the Five Directions;
Numinous Dragons presented the Grand Talisman,
reporting to the Water Thearch.
Jade Phoenixes carried the imperial seals,
Crimson Crows soared and danced.
Flooddragons leapt and bounded,
stirring the vast abyss.
The River’s waters stilled their flow,
fish scales gathered in assembly.
Sweet dew arose of itself,
mushroom blossoms poured forth in abundance.
Lions and fierce beasts
drew near to humans as neighbors.
The aged reverted to youth,
their countenances splendid and majestic.
Earth’s treasuries released their stores,
gold and jade revealed their forms.
The world sang in chorus,
rejoicing in the Great Peace—
the earth bore lotus blossoms,
the Five Marchmounts shone with clarity.

*The Cavernous Talisman Scripture*
The Most High Lord of the Dao, in the Fragrant Grove Garden...

The myriad heavens spread their mats,
as clouds and mists surged thickly,
the four seasons merged in darkness,
three days and nights passed—
the profound yin remained unbroken.
Heaven and earth ceased to be,
before the vast desolation,
the Heavenly Venerable spoke:
“The Jade Script shines resplendent,
veiling the light of heaven.
For the sake of the four assemblies,
I reveal the wondrous auspices of the heavens.”

Those who uphold the scripture’s essence
may hear fragrant incense or the strains of zither and lute,
may hear chanting in the void,
or see a halo bright as the sun,
and the marvels of perfected beings and flying immortals from the ten directions—
all arising of themselves.

When wisdom is obstructed,
the gods of heaven and earth
no longer manifest.

The *Jade Writ of the Imperial Chapters*
must be placed upon the crown of the head and held in the heart,
then the Supreme Perfected Immortals will come to guard, never departing.

The Purple Tenuity gleams with seven towering trees,
jade blossoms and rosy clouds gather,
the sages assemble in the Jasper Palace,
the Queen Mother of the West commands the Azure Song.

*The Cavernous Numinous Chapters*
Within the Great Radiance,
white qi is woven into terraces,
ninefold clouds form the halls.
Purple mists layer the gates,
where divine splendor gathers—
the dwelling of the Primordial Sovereign of the Great Void.

The *Luminous Ancestral Heaven* drifts in the western skies,
above Dragon Marsh Mountain.
Of old, the *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* existed there,
yet among a million men and women,
not one obtained it—
only those born with prior destiny received this writ.

The South Pole Lord of Longevity,
styled Yi Du,
concealed this scripture within the Nine-Bend Grotto Chamber of the Jasper Terrace and Cinnabar Cloud Palace,
sealed with the peaks of Yulin
and the chapters of the Lofty Profound Cavern.

In the western chamber of Mount Emei in Shu Commandery,
of old, the *Scripture of the Three Sovereigns* resided.
Among a million men and women,
in the Yellow Chamber,
it presides over the merits of the Flying Perfected of Sun and Moon.

*The Inner Sounds of the Myriad Heavens*
Those who receive the great cavernous oral instructions
preserve the five spirits within the Purple Chamber,
their voices resounding in the chambers of the Five Elders,
their virtue ascending above the Three Clarities.

The *Jade Writ of the Numinous Script*
and the *Jade Writ of the Great Empyrean*.

The Perfected Sovereign regularly ascends on the ninth day of the ninth month, the fifth day of the tenth month, the third day of the third month, the eighth day of the fourth month, and the seventh day of the seventh month—these five days mark the times of the Ten Assemblies. He mounts to the Supreme Ultimate’s Jasper Terrace, the lofty Jade Chamber within the Golden Hall, where he contemplates the Five Vows in the Secluded Palace, yearning for the mysterious decree to descend into emptiness and non-being. Unsealing it with jade tablets, the golden tones resound through the Great Void, summoning the Five Emperors to guard the numinous, while myriad blessings converge in the Solar Chamber.

The Most High Lord of the Great Dao
addressed the Northern Culmen Perfected Lord, saying:
"In former times, I withdrew to the Northern Heavens,
my feet treading the Floriate Canopy,
my hands parting the Nine Origins.
In the cloud palaces of Leisurely Radiance,
I sported in the Northern Mystery,
roamed carefree through the Northern Dark’s halls,
and raced my chariot through the Cavernous Lofty Gate.
I gazed upon the revolving jade armillary to summon the turning of fate,
urged the kalpas’ convergence with dancing wheels,
mocked the withering decay of the myriad things,
and looked down upon heaven and earth, abiding forever.
Thus did I perceive the marvels of the stellar net,
and awaken to the supreme numen of the Dipper’s bowl."

yellow gold as their halls,
and white jade as their forms.

**Rankings of Musicians and Entertainers, Sixth Section**

The Great Music of Heavenly Harmony interweaves ten thousand melodies. The Perfected Consorts sing in unison, while celestial musicians number in the hundreds of thousands. The *"Jade Capital"* hymn resounds as the Four Heavenly Kings and their hosts attend Lord Lao, bearing incense and flowers to his right. The celestial entertainers perform together, their mournful reed pipes startling the heavens.

Music stirs the qi of the six directions and eight extremities—east and west, south and north, the cyclical signs *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, and the twenty-five qi, each with its proper correspondence. Thus it moves all things, harmonizes yin and yang, stabilizes the four seasons, and balances the five phases. Strings are tuned by the nine-nines sequence of their silk, only then can they unite yin and yang.

- **Hai day:** The maiden Gongche Jian composes the world’s newest melodies.

When music is to be performed, the master first ascends to the left palace of heaven to retrieve the instruments, returning with them amid the clouds. Before the music reaches even ten *li*, its resonance is already heard throughout the realm.

The Golden Perfected, the Divine Transcendents, and the assembled sages strum the cloud zithers, perform the *Heavenly Harmony*, dance with lions, and ride white unicorns. They coax white cranes to circle and crimson phoenixes to soar, while the eight tones ring clear, the nine hues gleam radiant, and pipes, drums, bells, and chimes weave a thousand wonders through ten thousand entertainments.

jade gates coil through the winding cosmos.
Dispersing spirits beyond the nine degrees,
together in this ten-thousand-kalpa court.”

rightward, the myriad currents’ ford is struck.
Hands grasp the eightfold essence-*qi*,

Hands grasp the Jade Emperor’s sleeves,

Bequeathing me the accumulated kalpas,
releasing this thousand-year sigh.”

The Queen Mother commands her attendants, Ku Pin and Li Longsun, to sing two songs of the *Mystic Cloud Melody*:

**"Though the Supreme Image hangs in clouds,
I grasp the gate of Heaven and Earth.
Parting the cloud-essence of Eight Effulgences,
I swiftly traverse the Six Realms.
Nurturing spirit within the Three Primes,
Absorbing essence beneath the Six Palaces.
Then mounting the myriad-dragon pillar,
I descend with phoenix gaze upon the Nine Wilds.
The Dark Garden halts the Northern Terrace,
Five Citadels gleam in towering splendor.
Unlocking the boundless ford,
I drift upon the Weaving Maid’s River.
Above, I ascend the Crimson Court,
Below, I wander the Sun’s Cavern Vale.
Gazing beyond the Northern Culmen,
I point toward the Ninefold Auroras of the Void.
In tranquil contemplation, moved by central harmony,
This is the song of the Mystic Void."**

Exhaling and inhaling the flowing mist of rosy clouds.
Embryonic breathing stills the hundred passages,
In boundless vastness, mastering the Three Efficacies.

From the *Scripture of Jade Capital Mountain*:
The child within the womb,
Exhales yin and inhales yang,
Using inner qi to nourish its nature.

From the *Great Peace*:
Qi is the vessel of spirit and luminosity,
The origin of purity and turbidity.
Feeding on the qi of the Mystic Root,
The spirit’s eightfold acuity,
The body bears solar radiance,
The face bears jade essence,
The eyes generate bright light,
The teeth contain purple qi.
The Dao’s essence lies in golden nectar,
Its affairs wondrous in water-jade,
So-called: exhaling and inhaling the Grand Harmony of spontaneity,
Riding the numinous qi of the Nine Essences.
Ingesting qi for ten thousand years,
Ever possessing youthful countenance.

From the *Five Talismans*:
The Primordial Five Qi.

To ascend the numinous treasure of Jade Mountain in the Mystic Capital’s Upper Palace, where the first radiance of yang light scatters the Primordial Beginning’s brilliance, streaming to irrigate all heavens—its qi dense and luxuriant, its glow warm and fragrant, essence like moon-pearls, light like purple mountains—this descends to nourish the roots of the scholar’s five teeth. The Perfected of Great Wisdom in the Upper Palace feed upon this radiance, completing their union with heaven.

From the *Jade Sleeve of Numinous Treasure*:
**Method of Ingesting the Teeth’s Qi**
At the eight solar nodes, enter the chamber in purity and alignment, visualizing the forms of the Five Elders. Practicing this for eight years, immortal officials and jade maidens will attend you; your body will emanate luminosity, illuminating the ten directions. The Five Thearchs will bow in reverence, and the administrators of the Three Realms will welcome you.

**Five Immortals**
Jade mushrooms in the Mystic Gulf’s depths.

From the *Twenty-Four Images of Vital Generation*:
Constantly contemplate the great sun within the spleen, and within the sun a golden tower, where a book lies sealed with a golden seal, three characters in breadth and length. When the sun’s majesty reveals it, read it aloud—your heart will open, your eyes will brighten, and you will become a transcendent.

From the *Laozi’s Observation of Heaven*:
Focus on the Yellow Field within the stomach—pure white as congealed fat, suffused with yellow qi. When it reaches the mouth, swallow it to attain satiety. This Yellow Field is the Great Granary. All spirits gather there to feast, where a yellow lightning cauldron steams rice, and jade maidens and youths serve as attendants, announcing: “The Yellow Thearch’s child has prepared the traveling kitchen.”

**Guiding Qi Nine Ascents and Nine Descents**
After twelve days, the body lightens; after eighteen days, minor attainment is reached; after thirty-six days, the Dao is greatly accomplished; after eighty days, the head and face radiate light; after one hundred twenty days, one becomes a Perfected.

**Entering the Chamber to Burn Incense**
Face due south, close the breath, and knock the teeth twenty-four times. Visualize as prescribed: *Li* above the head, *Kan* below the navel, *Kun* in the left hand, *Xun* in the right hand, *Qian* beneath the left foot, *Gen* beneath the right foot, *Dui* below the left flank, *Zhen* below the right flank. The eight trigrams manifest their forms, forms contain qi, qi contains spirit. The spirit-person shines with luminosity, arrayed in the eight directions, exhaling generative qi. In spring, *Zhen* governs and engenders fire; in summer, *Li* governs and engenders earth; in autumn, *Dui* governs and engenders water; in winter, *Kan* governs and engenders wood. During the four seasons, *Qian*, *Kun*, *Gen*, and *Xun* govern metal, rotating with the months: *Xun* in the third month, *Kun* in the sixth, *Qian* in the ninth, *Gen* in the twelfth.

**Method of Swallowing the Eight Qi**
In the months of *yin* and *mao* (spring), inhale *Zhen* qi three times, then spray high qi nine times; next sip *Xun* qi four times, then *Kun* qi twice; next spray *Qian* qi six times, then sip *Gen* qi eight times, *Dui* qi seven times, and *Kan* qi once. Conclude by knocking the teeth thirty-six times, rubbing the four limbs and five body parts. Practice this during the three or six periods of purification, bowing to the Supreme Eight Simplicities.

**Morning and Evening**
Recite: *jiazi*, *yichou*, *bingyin*, *dingmao*, *wuchen*, halting at *chen*. Strike the golden beam with jade clappers, circulate the Flowery Pond to recite the Wine Spring, scoop dew from the Boat-Shaving Pool, rinse the mouth’s perimeter, then swallow once after three repetitions—three swallows in total. Perform the *Six Jia* of the Lower Cinnabar as before, totaling thirty swallows to ingest their essential brilliance. The so-called golden beam is the tongue; the jade clappers are the teeth; the Wine Spring, Cinnabar Pond, and Dew Scoop are the saliva in the mouth.

From the *Method of Ingesting Qi*:
At dawn, consume the qi of the five clouds; at dusk, chant the three dawn-lights.

**The Cavernous Numinous Chapters**
The Great Dao wondrously formless,
Its numinous transformations manifest the Three Spirits.
At dawn, draw in the essence of the Five Stars;
At midday, spray the nectar of the sun’s core;
At dusk, ingest the yellow radiance of the moon;
In sleep, refine the Five Immortals beyond the body.

**The Twenty-Four Images of Vital Generation**
*Ingesting the Sun’s Essence*
To ensure longevity, the child must consume the sun’s essence.
On the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and fifteenth days of the lunar month, from sunrise to midday, ingest it thus:
First visualize the sun at the center of the heart, the sun crowned with a dark canopy, beneath which stands a small boy, perfectly crimson, his crimson qi suffusing nine layers within and without the body. Envision the qi filling the head, ascending from the head to rise into the heavens, circling the sun ninefold.

Recite the incantation:
*"Sun Sovereign, Primordial Yang,
Return to the Crimson Chamber.
Unite with my virtue,
Together nourishing the small boy."*

Then visualize the surging essence descending into the nose, swallowing it twenty-seven times. The heart becomes filled with three figures: to the left, the Great One, the Father; to the right, the Dark Radiance, the Mother; at the center, the Crimson Child, the small boy. Seated upon a golden bed and jade couch, they hold jade ladles and jade cups. Within the cup appear jade blossoms, divine wine, and celestial ganoderma—visualize consuming them to attain longevity.

*Ingesting the Moon’s Essence*
This too grants longevity.
On the fifteenth night of the lunar month at midnight, face the moon and bow twice. Recite the incantation:
*"Moon Sovereign, Radiant Child,
Return to the Cinnabar Field.
Unite with my virtue,
Together nourishing the small boy."*

Visualize the moon’s white, pure, yellow essence descending into the nose and mouth, swallowing it twenty-one times. The moon’s essence anchors to the root of the kidneys, ensuring longevity.

*Ingesting the Stars’ Essence*
This ascends to the Grand Clarity.
At sunrise, dusk, midday, or midnight, visualize the Great Yellow Star of the North Pole. Recite the incantation:
*"August Heaven, Eternal Supreme Dao Lord,
Your humble descendant petitions for longevity."*

Envision the star’s essence descending, lingering between the brows, flowing into the nose and mouth. Swallow it fifteen times until the qi fills the heart and gallbladder. Within the spleen, the Dao Mother cradles the Crimson Child—thus is longevity attained.

The flying boat is named *Frost*,
Simmering and refining the clouds and waters.

Jasper and vermilion gold gleam bright,
Nine crucibles blaze in the heavens’ height.
Ascend the body to the Nine Heavens,
Leap beyond the Mystic Isles to roam the Nine Palaces’ domains—
Yet the True Person’s gate remains unseen.

*The Eight Essences*

Or *Five-Pearl Radiant Elixir*,
Or *Crimson Dawn’s Morning Bloom*,
Or *Three-Flower Supreme Divine Elixir*,
Or *Supreme Flying Rigidity*,
Or *Nine Spirits’ Supreme Elixir*—eight grades in all.

*The Nine Perfections’ Central Scripture*
The Nine Elixirs are nine paths, like nine methods.
Consuming them grants ten thousand generations of longevity.
The first elixir is named *Nine Blossoms*,
The second *Divine Talisman*,
The third *Dragon Elixir*,
The fourth *Returning Elixir*,
The fifth *Nourishing Elixir*,
The sixth *[missing character] Elixir*,
The seventh *Profound Elixir*,
The eighth *Subduing Elixir*,

*The Perfected One’s Flowing Pearl Nine-Turns Divine Immortal Nine Elixirs Scripture*
Eight paths of Central Yellow:
Golden script on purple text,
Nine-turned frost and snow,
*Langgan* radiant elixir,
Returning white jade wine,
Golden fluid flowing essence,
Jade forest congealed bloom,
Sun-and-moon waters—
All are paths to ascend in broad daylight,
To ascend to heaven as an immortal.
Bestowed by the Thearch Lord,
Hidden in the Jasper Terrace.
Without the true record, the method remains unattained.

*Langgan’s Luxuriant Bloom*
Sevenfold yang sun’s infant nine-jade fluid,
Eight jades’ essence,
Four-petaled purple nectar,
Five-jade crimson bloom,
Three-flower flying rigidity,
Twin pearls’ moon brightness,
Orchid-rich golden embryo,
Sweet dew jade vase,
Azure warp-turned silk,
Drifting mushrooms’ flowing spirit,
Divine beam elixir powder,
Mystic gorge’s entwining,

Yellow Thearch’s plain fullness—
These can soar through the Mystic Heavens,
Fly the void of Jade Clarity,
Inhale to draw in the true numinous,
Rinse to transform and enter the Thearch’s court of the Great Grotto Mountain.

Fly the void, traverse the hollow cavern,
The Yang Palace’s flowing fire court—
Within burns radiant flame,
Eight refinements’ spontaneous mysterious elixir.
Yellow qi’s yang essence,
Three paths follow their course.

*Thirty-Six Waters of Divine Elixir*
The guardian of golden fluid.

*The Ink Record of Elixir Simplicities*
*Sarira* is the golden fluid’s congealed essence,
The returning elixir’s transformation,
The true unity’s spontaneous qi.

*A Dose of Nine-Turn Returning Elixir*
One divine formula,
Bestowed by Lord Mao upon his two disciples.

*The Immortal Mother’s Golden Elixir*
Also named *Queen Mother of the West’s Age-Halting Qi Elixir*.
Blend three *sheng* of congealed white honey,
Three *jin* of elixir essence with bright white bloom,
Two *jin* of mica flakes in a bronze vessel.
Simmer with mulberry wood on gentle fire,
Freeze for three days,
Then steam for thirty days,
Exposing it to daylight’s full fire.
Boil the bronze vessel for three days and nights,
Dry in the sun,
Pray and pound thirty thousand times,
Sift finely into powder,
Form into pellets with white honey the size of small beans.
Take twenty pellets at dawn—
Longevity without death,
Complexion like a maiden’s.

*The Great Grotto True Scripture*
*Jade Elixir, Golden Nectar*—
Flying and soaring medicines.

The Supreme Dao Lord asked the Supreme Venerable Lord,
Who revealed to the child Lingzhen the *Crimson-Expanding Heavenly Immortal’s Method*,
The *Hundred Mushrooms of the Jade Court’s Upper Clarity Essence Medicines*, saying:

Hollow cavern’s numinous claws,
Four kalpas’ single fruit,
Nether realm’s unicorn gall,

Stooping to gather the long abyss’s patterned algae,
Above harmonizing the nine-turns’ King Wen,
Below swallowing the Azure Mystery’s rosy treasure,
Great void’s congealed mirror,
Plain Maiden’s embrace,
Purple youths,
Nine-colored phoenix brains,
Grand Ultimate’s hidden mushrooms,
Crimson tree’s sun path,
Supreme rainbow plums,
Celestial Han’s great herbs,

Sought by the numinous consorts.
Those who consume these will age after heaven,
These are what the Jade Clarity consumes,
What the Supreme treasures,
Enabling ascent to soar the radiant heavens,
Dividing dawn’s myriad paths,
Guarding and stabilizing yellow essence,
Morning infusion into the nine brains,
Hearing the mysterious tones to disperse the turbid,
Listening to the wind’s qi to expel the foul.

The next are the *Upper Clarity’s Secluded Mushrooms*,

Plucking the patterned pearl’s veins,
Cloud court’s divine peaches,
Kun garden’s level sparrows,
Night essence’s white herbs,
Azure ford’s green reeds,
True officials’ lush altars,
Mysterious capital’s three canopies.
Leftward consuming the jade youth’s radiance,
Rightward embracing the jade maiden’s qi.
Above summoning the divine radiance,
Below drinking the mysterious rapids.
Gazing upward to pluck the orchid garden’s jasper essence,
Stooping to gather the mystic mound’s purple crabapples.

White Water’s numinous clams,
Eight Heavens’ crimson leeks;
Once born in ten thousand years,
Nine ranks of flowing light.
Those who obtain and consume them
transcend mortality and depart.
What the Heavenly Emperor ingests,
the Supreme’s most precious treasure—
beyond what the Grand Ultimate has heard,
beyond what the Median Perfected can attain.

Next in rank: the Grand Ultimate’s grade,

the Eight Hidden Earthly Guards—
only then can one roam the Mysterious Void,
retrace the steps of the Celestial River,
ride clouds and mount dragons,
ascend and soar without bound.

Next: the Thirty-Six Mushrooms,

*The Divine Medicines for Dispelling Demons*

Su Lin, styled Zixuan, was a native of Qushui in Puyang. He studied under the immortal Master Qiu of Mount Hua for five years, gaining the ability to enter and exit water and fire, his complexion like that of a maiden. The Master declared: "You are a true person."

*True Unity of the Three Primes*

The Lady of South Marchmount, surnamed Wei, styled Xian’an, was a native of Rencheng. On a midnight of clarity in the final month of winter, she heard amidst the profound darkness the resounding of bells and drums, the melodies of reed pipes and flutes—eight tones clamoring in harmony. Gazing outward into the empty void, she saw descending from the eastern heavens: the Supreme Ultimate Perfected One, Anduming; the Great Divinity of Eastern Florescence, the Azure Lad of Fangzhu; and the Perfected One of Jade Radiance of the Bihé Yang Valley of Fusang, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness, the Lesser You Immortal King Wang Zideng. The Lady prostrated herself in reverence and was bestowed two elixirs: the first, *Hidden Transcendence and Self-Concealing Spirit Powder*; the second, *Stone Essence and Golden Light Transfiguration Spirit Pellets*. After seven days of ingestion, past midnight, the Supreme Celestial Immortals dispatched a soaring chariot to receive her. The Lady employed the *Mirror Method* to entrust her form to a sword and pillow, and from that moment, she vanished.

*Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Lady*
*Celestial Immortal Medicines*

Should the Great Granary’s hoarded grain be piled high—
*Crimson Silken Vermilion Child* is cinnabar.
From the *Numinous Writ of Purple Text*:

*Sun-Soul of Cinnabar Mountain* is realgar;
*Moon-Essence of the Dark Terrace* is orpiment;
*White Silk Flying Dragon* is white quartz;
*Green-Waisted Maiden Within* is malachite;
*Purple Mound Literary Marquis* is amethyst;
*Flying Blossom of Jasper Wall* is graphite;
*Mysterious Pearl of the Northern Thearch* is nitre;
*Yellow Lad of the Nine Numinous* is sulfur;
*Golden Ram of the Five Essences* is actinolite;
*Flying Blossom of Rain-Florescence* is mica;
*White Tiger’s Shed Fangs* is gold-tooth stone;
*Flowing Cinnabar White Cream* is ceruse;
*Reversed-Marching Divine Bone* is halite.

Those who ascend in learning ingest the Dao of sun and moon, meditate upon the Lesser Yang Perfected of Cinnabar Numinosity, and fill a lapis lazuli vessel with *Jade Spring Azure Fungus Cream* to anoint their destined form. They further take a golden crucible to refine and congeal the cream, bathing their bodies in the yellow qi of yang essence. *Mysterious Water Jade Liquid*—also called *Flying Dragon Cloud Marrow* or *Refined Quintuple-Stone Flower Cream*—when consumed for fifteen years, bestows a jade radiance upon the body, longevity coeval with heaven and earth, and command over ghosts and spirits. After three years, one’s hair may write by night. This formula surpasses the ingestion of eight-fold refined minerals, excelling even the *Jade Nectar of Cassia Water and Mica*.

From the *Great Cavern*:
*Mysterious Ripple of Dark Herbage* is the marrow of black sesame, also called *Mysterious Clarity*.
From the *Feminine Unity and Five Elders*:
*Purple Forest Marrow*.
From the *Lord Mao*:
*Fill-Soul and Secure-Spirit*.

The *Seventy-Four Directions Flying Spirit Pellets*—when consumed, one may ride the void and walk the emptiness.

From the *Purple Radiance of Scorching Flame*:
The *Grand Unity’s Fourfold Guardian Pellets* confer longevity of ten thousand years.

From the *Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*:
Lady Wei’s ears and eyes grew clear and bright at eighty-three. In the moon’s light, she inscribed Daoist talismans for disciples. Through meditative absorption, she entered her chamber, fasting for a hundred days or even decades.

From the *Inner Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign*:
Earthbound Perfected Ones first expel the Three Corpse-Worms, which bear three names and sever three lives. If the Three Ghosts remain, they pierce the Six Palaces and agitate the Five Spirits.

From the *Unified Method of the Primordial True One*:
The *Supreme Eight Jade Flying Essence Elixir*—the Perfected One Mao Ying, styled Shu and Shen, hailed from Nanguan in Xianyang. His master was the North-Facing Northern River Ghost Valley Master, who dwelt in reclusion on Mount Hua. At eighteen, Ying fled his home for Mount Heng. His great-grandfather, Mao Meng, had once ascended to heaven in broad daylight upon clouds and dragons amid Mount Hua. The village’s ballad sang:
*"The divine immortal attained by Mao at first perfection,
Rode the dragon upward to enter the Grand Clarity.
Now he sports on the Dark Continent and Crimson City,
Passing through generations to come—here in me, Ying."*
The Thearch’s master lauded him in the twelfth month.

Ying remained on the mountain for six years, whereupon he dreamed of the Supreme Mystery Jade Maiden presenting him with a jade writ and leading him, saying: "The Western Citadel King Lord possesses the true Dao." Thereupon he bowed his head in reverence and journeyed to the Numinous Citadel to meet the King Lord. In the seventeenth year, the King Lord charged him with overseeing the divine registers of robes and scriptures. After three years of cultivation, he was commanded to ride forth to White Jade Mill Mountain, where the Queen Mothers of the Azure Palace resided. The King Lord further bestowed upon Ying a dose of the Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir and a single immortal formula. The Heavenly Thearch then appointed him as Upper Minister of the Eastern Marchmount and Director of Life and Death at Huolin, overseeing the registers of life and death in Wu and Yue. Thereupon he instructed his two younger brothers to ingest the Azure Tooth. Later, he told Ji Weiqing: "You ought to ingest the Divine Formula of the Four Fans Powder, which the Wind Sovereign received from the Yellow Emperor—I once received it from the Most High Master, and now transmit it to you." He also addressed Si Heqing, saying: "You ought to ingest the Queen Mother’s Four Lads’ Elixir Powder to replenish the marrow and fortify the brain." Both formulas were wondrous. After eighteen years of ingesting the medicines, his two younger brothers’ complexions became like those of maidens. *The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao*.

May the Mysterious Mother share with me the natural Seven Treasures Jade Syrup and the Golden Elixir of Purple Concealed Zhi. To the right, gather the Five Summons Night Radiance, Phoenix Brain, Tiger Foam, Cloud Lang, and Jade Frost—with but a single taste of these wondrous flavors, one brushes against the Great Void.

*The Feminine One*

The Sage Lord led the Azure Youth to sit and served the flowing rosy nectar, red trees with white seeds, and crimson woods with azure fruits.

*The Purple Text of Numinous Writ*

The August Person was dispatched by the Lord of Fusang, governing the immortal officials of Mount Emei. His body stood nine feet tall, his fur covering his form, and he dwelled beneath the northern cliff. Within, his house was made of azure jade, his bed of yellow jade, draped with curtains of patterned silk, and burning the incense of a thousand harmonies. His attendants were all jade maidens among the immortals, and three seated treasures were all Great Clarity Immortal Kings. They set out jujubes brimming in measures and rinsed their mouths with the numinous nectar of the Vermilion Palace’s Jade Well.

*The Five Talismans*

The Dark Water Cloud Blossom Nectar, also called the Cloud-Stored Vermilion Nectar. Drinking five *ge* daily, one’s face becomes youthful and one’s body fragrant.

*The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected*

To study the Dao, one must wander the palaces of the sun and moon, meet the kings of the sun and moon, and drink the essence of the sun and moon, the golden-bound nectar.

*Wisdom*

The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate consumed the thousand-stone Azure Essence Rice, the divine formula of the highest immortals. Eating this rice renders one immune to all harm. After ten years, the spirit of the Azure Essence coalesces to summon wind and rain, and a single dose extends one’s lifespan by a thousand years.

*The Inner Transmission of Perfected Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness*

The five divine zhi of Mount Juqu:

The first is the Dragon Immortal Zhi, resembling intertwined dragons with leaves as scales and roots like coiled dragons. Those who consume it are appointed as Perfected Ones of the Great Ultimate.

The second is the Ginseng Zhi, crimson in color with a radiant vermilion glow, its branches and leaves chiming like metal and stone when struck. Those who consume it are appointed as Grand Masters of the Great Ultimate.

The third is the Swallow Embryo Zhi, purple in hue, shaped like a sunflower with leaves bearing the likeness of flying swallows, its luminosity penetrating and clear. Eating one stalk appoints one as the Dragon-Tiger Immortal Lord of Great Clarity and Rectifying Unity Gentleman of the Court.

The fourth is the Night Cavern Zhi, green in color with white fruits like plums, standing three to four feet tall, its leaves resembling cypress. At night, its fruits illuminate an entire chamber like moonlight. Each stalk bears nine fruits, which fall to the ground like seven-inch mirror trays of fox, landing one to two inches thick. At night, they appear as large as oxen, and by day, they move. Eating one branch appoints one as Left Imperial Censor of the Immortal Officials of Great Clarity.

The fifth is the White Righteous Jade Zhi. Splitting open and consuming its core appoints one as Direct Perfected Censor of the Three Offices. Those who consume this zhi are commanded by the Most High to have the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate dispatch the Five Thearchs to bow in audience and appoint them.

During its four seasons, the Swallow Embryo Zhi glows with flowing radiance, its light soaring in paired flight, illuminating the grasses at night. The zhi consumed by Lord Mao was planted by the Perfected Lord of the Great Ultimate of Fangzhu in Qingzhou, not of this kind.

*The Inner Transmission of Lord Mao*

The four varieties of Great Ultimate Concealed Zhi:

Some are four-sided in color, their light illuminating a hundred paces.

One kind is azure, resembling a moon mirror, three layers stacked together, five to six inches tall, called the Great Ultimate Numinous Mirror Concealing Heaven Azure Zhi.

Another is white, like the Dipper star, with seven nodes marked by stars and stems as its framework, three to four feet tall, called the Great Ultimate Concealing Chen Numinous Soul Zhi.

Another is crimson, like a small jujube tree with fruits like *lu*, its brilliance shining brightly, three to four feet tall, called the Mirror Framework Concealing Mystery Great Ultimate Golden Heaven Zhi.

Another is gray-green, like an overturned canopy on the ground, layered and circular, seven to eight inches in diameter, its clear light flowing like a candle, three to four inches tall, called the Great Ultimate Mysterious Moon Reclining Dragon Zhi.

*The Golden Tablet of the Great Tenuity in Jade Script*

Dig six feet into the earth.

Plant one mirror fruit and irrigate it with five *ge* of yellow water; in three years it sprouts grass, bearing peach-like seeds. The Five-Colored Phoenix-Brain Zhi, when its fruit is consumed, ascends to the Great Ultimate, and upon spitting upon the earth transforms into a phoenix, which one may mount to soar—also called the Great Ultimate Concealing Zhi.

*The Purple Text of the Numinous Writ*
When Yin Xi accompanied the Old Master on their travels, they ascended the Hall of Square Zhang on Mount Changyang and beheld the Nine Elderly Men chewing the Nine-Intertwined Zhi. Journeying south, they ascended Mount Suqiu and partook of the Nine-Radiance Zhi.

*The Perfected of the Primordial Above*
In the Land of the Heavenly Mirror, on Phoenix Mountain, grows the Gold-Jade Purple Zhi. The various heavens scatter fragrant blossoms, while the sun and moon irrigate it with numinous radiance; when ingested, the five spirits open, and jade maidens proffer golden trays.

*The Twenty-Four Images of Life*
The Five Zhi: their fragrance pervades the immortal peaks, where numinous branches flourish in the numinous grottoes. Once in ten thousand kalpas they blaze forth, and the various heavens intermingle in wondrous union. Tranquil awakening lingers like a single tree, as grains of sand endure for a single morning.

The Lady Wang, Middle Attendant of Eastern Florescence, wrote in her poem:
*"The Jade Pool irrigates the fields of quartz."*

*The Perfect Writ of the Great Cavern*
The Jade-Fat Zhi grows on the Mountain of Jade, where jade cream flows forth and congeals over ten thousand years into a fat-like substance, resembling the forms of birds and beasts, luminous as moon essence. When blended with the juice of the Heartless Grass, it instantly becomes liquid; consuming one *dou* grants a thousand years of life.

*The Catalog of Numinous Treasure Zhi*
*The Five Sacred Peaks in Pictorial Form*

The Zhi that is born together with Heaven and Earth is placed in the offices of the Thirty-Two Heavens’ Grotto-Courts, where perfected transcendents and flying immortals dwell. The divine herb Jade Zhi upon its heights grants men immortality.

*Wondrous Sayings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi*

**Stone Zhi**
Grows on secluded mountains by the sea where stones accumulate. Its form has head and tail, four feet—red as coral, white as silver fat, black as lacquer-dyed silk, blue as kingfisher plumes, yellow as gold—radiant and translucent as solid ice. On dark nights, its light is visible from a hundred paces. The largest weigh over ten *jin*. To refine Stone-Image Zhi, pound it thirty-six thousand times; consume a square-inch spoonful, and after finishing one *jin*, one gains a hundred thousand years of life. It also grows on high mountains near water, shaped like plates or bowls, no more than a foot in diameter, with seven apertures called Seven Luminaries or nine apertures called Nine Radiants, all shining like stars. These one hundred twenty kinds are all Stone Zhi, recorded in the *Jade Strategies of the Great One*.

**Wood Zhi**
Pine resin transformed after a thousand years, shaped like a lotus blossom, called Wood Might-Joy. It glows when viewed at night and, when worn, repels weapons. Its root resembles a seated person, seven feet long; when carved, it bleeds. Applied to the feet, one may walk upon water; applied to the body, one becomes invisible. Mixed with giant sesame and used to illuminate the ground at night, if gold or jade treasures lie buried, the light turns azure and droops downward. Consuming ten *jin* grants a thousand years of life. When pine resin ages three thousand years, its bark contains congealed fat shaped like a dragon, called Qi-Node Zhi, weighing ten *jin*; consuming one *jin* grants five hundred years. Fan-Tao Zhi resembles a rising dragon, its blossoms like cinnabar gauze, its fruit like green-black birds, five feet tall, growing on the shady side of famous mountains above flowing streams. Consuming one stalk grants five thousand years. Great Spring Zhi is a parasite on large trees, resembling a lotus flower, with a sweet and pungent taste. Jian-Fruit Zhi is the fruit of the Jian Tree, growing in Du-Guang, its bark like a tassel snake, its fruit like a *yue* bird. When these Zhi are blended and consumed, one ascends in broad daylight.

**Herb Zhi**
Solitary-Sway Zhi moves without wind, its stem red as cinnabar, its root as large as a *kui* measure, or as small as a chicken’s egg. Twelve stems encircle a single large root, which grows on Tiger-Longevity Mountain at Wu Slope, resembling ox horns, three to four feet long, azure in color. Consuming a square-inch spoonful grants a thousand years. Hemp-Mother Zhi has purple blossoms. Pearl Zhi has a yellow stem and red leaves, its fruit like plums, purple, twenty-four strung like beads. White-Tally Zhi resembles a plum, blooming in heavy snow and bearing fruit in late winter. Nine-Bend Vermilion Grass has nine curves, each bearing three fruits. Five-Hearing Zhi resembles a tower, its stem square, its leaves in five colors like an inverted canopy, with sweet dew and purple qi rising several feet. Dragon-Street Zhi sprouts in pairs at three nodes during mid-spring, twelve in total. All Herb Zhi, when consumed, grant either a thousand or two thousand years of life.

**Fungus Zhi**
Shaped like palaces, carriages, dragons, tigers, or flying birds, in five colors without constancy, comprising one hundred ten kinds. Those who consume them ascend as immortals; the middling gain several thousand years, the lesser a thousand years.

**Lotus Fruit**
Also called Water Zhi, paired with the osprey’s head as yin and yang. On the *wu* day of the eighth month, gather lotus seeds; on the morning of the ninth month, gather lotus roots, dry them in the shade by degree for a hundred days, and prepare them. On the *mao* day of the first month at dawn, consume a square-inch spoonful with well-flower water four or five times daily for a hundred days to cure all illnesses; prolonged consumption leads to transcendence.

**Scholars of the Highest Immortality**

Inscribe this upon silver tablets for the longevity of the Upper and Lower Immortals. The Three Great Spirits sigh in timely response: within the Five Marchmounts, the great treasuries of gold, silver, jade marrow, and lapis lazuli burst forth in radiance, illuminating the ten directions. The Eight Sea Spirit-Kings emerge from the azure depths bearing coral trees, five million *li* in height, their seven-jeweled blossoms and leaves overspreading the vast ocean. The heavens of the Three Realms rain fine luminous pearls, while the Five Marchmounts reveal the divine immortal mountain treasuries, their five-hued beauteous jades gleaming with inexhaustible splendor. *Scripture of the Womb-Dwelling Karma*

a multitude beyond reckoning—

neither born nor dying.

Master Anqi
encountered divine maidens, who praised him greatly.

The Lesser Official Divine Maidens
set out wine, fruits, and kitchen victuals,
feasting for half a day.

*The Divine Elixir of Golden Liquor from Great Clarity*

The Perfected of Highest Clarity
eastward journeyed to Mulberry Grove, reaching the Capital of the Nine Elder Immortals,
where they consumed stone-brain and golden marrow,
observing the fast for seven years.

*The Annals of the Three Celestial Lords’ Fiery Deeds*

Commanding the Six Ding Spirits,
divine lads attend in guard.

The Queen Mother
ordered the Left Guard Immortal Lads to array the cloud-bridles in solemn order,
while Jade Maidens of the Right Attendants prepared the wind-borne chariot.
In the first month of the fifth year of the Supreme August,
a grand assembly convened within the Vermilion Palace and Purple Hall of the Jade Towers,
where all the sacred hosts of the ten directions gathered as one.

The Heavenly Worthy manifested in golden splendor,
and at midday, the Queen Mother laid out a feast of ten thousand kinds,
with tables of the Seven Treasures.

*The Purple Writ Record and Transmission*

In the Lower Heaven of the Northern Direction,
the Land of Broad Cold possesses non-glutinous rice.
Its people are white and bear pearls, called *Yanshu*,
which are placed beneath the cauldron—
their radiance flaring forth like mani jewels.
When their light shines upon the rice, it ripens,
and people from all directions come to partake.

*The Three Sovereigns*

Thirty-six myriad leagues east of Mount Sumeru,
there is a land named Pure Harmony.
Its people eat once every three years,
where rice from the roots grows three feet long,
and its people stand six feet tall.
In that land, one day’s three meals consist of cooked non-glutinous rice,
while another day’s meal comes but once in three years.

*The Cavern Abyss*

The Azure Essence Lord of the Imperial Register

Feasting on essence and swallowing qi,
chewing the mysterious root,
imbibing the imperial wine and golden liquid that flows with essence.
Orchid wine and golden nectar,
sweet numinous jade flasks.

*The Wisdom Sutra*

The Supreme Emperor of the Grand Tenuity
commands the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate
to set forth the Central Yellow Venerable Lord,
the rosy-hued sacramental wine.

*The Purple Radiance of Blazing Light*

Pepper grows in Shu and Han,
containing the qi of Great Yin.
Born with heaven and earth,
transforming through land and water,
firmly sealed to prevent leakage—
worth ten thousand gold pieces if unused.

*The Five Talismans*

Ginger is born of Great Yang,
hailing from the same homeland as pepper.
It contains the qi of Mars,
hidden deep within mountain recesses.
Turning from yin toward yang,
sealing the demon gate.
Those who consume it long-term
shall have a lifespan as enduring as heaven and earth.

Yin Xi,
following the Venerable Lord northward to ascend the ridge of Empty Grotto,
beheld the Northern Hua Perfected Duke and the Four Hua Immortals,
along with countless lofty perfected ones,
eating the divine melon of Empty Grotto,
which ripens once every four kalpas.
Traveling west to the Mountain of the Great Tortoise,
he saw the Queen Mother of the Grand Perfected,
partaking of jade-patterned jujubes,
emerald peaches, and purple pears—
their fruits as large as vases.
There were also the Four Heavenly Kings,
arhats, and those of the five supernormal powers,
all bearing aureoles of light,
attending upon Laozi.
Fragrant flowers, celestial maidens,
and the mournful strains of pipa filled the sky.
A thousand chariots and ten thousand dragons trod the void.
Journeying eastward to ascend the Sun Cavern of Everlasting Yang Mountain,
he received the cinnabar authority of Fusang
and scattered the blossoms of the Spring Forest.

*The Supreme Perfected*

The Azure Lad of Square Vessels

The crimson melons and cinnabar gourds are set forth.
*The Transmission of the Purple Void Primordial Sovereign*

Above, the jade groves stretch in branching splendor;
below, the blossoms of sacred mushrooms unfurl.
Divine lads pluck the vermilion fruits,
while spirit maidens silently gather with jade talons.
*The Elixir Mystery*

The measure-filling jujubes,
*The Five Talismans*

The Central August Elders
dwell in the realm of Great Emptiness,
eating the everlasting apricots.
The Azure Lad of Square Vessels
prepares the dark-purple nectar.
Those who ingest the essence of sun and moon
must constantly consume bamboo shoots.
The bamboo shoot, embryo of the sun’s radiance,
is also called the Great Bright Honey.
*The Great Cavern’s Replenishment of the Five Viscera, Upper Scroll*

The nectar of blossoms and herbs
is honey.
*The Great Cavern’s Replenishment of the Five Viscera, Upper Scroll*

*Here ends Scroll Four of the Precious Scripture of the Highest Clarity*
*Scroll Five of the Precious Scripture of the Highest Clarity begins*
*Chapter Ten: The Cycles of Time*

The Ten Directional Celestial Worthies
comprehend the past
as if it were an object in the palm.
The Dao is
the root of all things.
The Ten Directional Celestial Worthies,
understanding the dharmas of the future,
see them as if present before the eyes.
The meaning of the fivefold convergence of celestial script—
beneath your feet, the salvation of heaven and humanity unfolds,
the great Dharma expands,
its blessings suffusing the ten directions.

Within the great city,
forty myriad leagues in each of the four directions—east, west, south, and north—
the center is filled with mustard-seed stones,
each likewise forty myriad leagues in extent.
Once every three years, the celestial beings
brush the mustard-seed stones with flying garments
until all the mustard seeds are gathered—
this is called one kalpa,
illustrating the speech of the Hu, Yue, Man, and Yi.
*The Three August Ones*

Heaven and earth complete one formation and one decay—
this is called one kalpa.
Consider a mountain of stone,
four hundred leagues in circumference,
where celestial beings, once every hundred years,
brush the stone with gauze until it is entirely worn away—
one kalpa is thus completed,
and it is as long as this.
*The True One’s Spontaneous Nature*

The Most High Orthodox Unity Perfected One,
Master of the Three Heavens, Zhang Daoling, said:
One kalpa is like an empty city with no one inside,
spanning four hundred leagues in circuit,
forty leagues in height,
filled with mustard seeds.
Once every hundred years, a flying celestial being descends
to take one mustard seed—
when all are exhausted, one kalpa ends.

Heaven’s qi reaches its extreme in Great Yin,
earth’s qi is exhausted in Great Yang.
When yang is agitated, it rebels;
when yin is excessive, it erodes.
The rebellion and erosion of yin and yang
are called the lesser kalpa.
Heaven completes nine thousand nine hundred revolutions for yang erosion,
earth completes nine thousand three hundred revolutions for yin rebellion.
The decay and transformation of heaven and earth
are called the great kalpa.

Once every nine years of heaven and earth,
they face the Perfected One.
*The Arrayed Records of the Nine Mystery Dao Sovereigns*

The Latter Sagely Lord and Mother
dreamed of dark clouds and sun and moon passing through her form to nurture her,
and of a leather-scaled dragon spouting water into the ritual vessel.

Those who obtain the Scripture of Numinous Treasure
may dream of Daoist immortals and celestial beings,
or of cloud chariots, jeweled canopies, dragons, and phoenixes;
or of ascending to immortality and beholding the palaces of the sagely ones,
with their seven treasures of pearls and jade;
or of ascending to heaven and seeing the Heavenly Kings and Celestial Lords.

For inauspicious dreams, recite the incantation:
“O Yellow Gate Divine Master, Purple Portal General,
grasping the halberd and wielding the bell,
dispel the malign currents,
transform misfortune into fortune,
and let life and death know no hindrance.”

Upon encountering an auspicious dream,
upon waking, rub the eyes thirty-four times
and click the teeth thirty-four times.

The incantation reads:
“Supreme High Essence, Radiant Spirits of the Three Emperors,
Scarlet Palace resplendent and clear, auspicious omens reveal their truth.
The Three Origins soften the poised souls, the Heavenly Sovereign bestows the Scripture.
Wherever one turns, harmony prevails, ascending as an immortal to the Upper Clarity,
Ever in the company of Jade Perfected, together gathering in the Purple Court.”
