At the feast within the Palace of Great Radiance,
Golden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.
The fast’s gate reflects the Primal Simplicity,
Four casements all of crimson jasper shine.
Wheels cast into the Hollow Crossing,
Reins held as green chariots dance in flight.
Jade blossoms fly like cloud-canopies,
Western consorts unfurl brocade banners bright.
Beyond the dust and filth they soar,
Swiftly entering the court of the exalted ones.
Long-awaited resonance arrives in time,
What is received lies hidden in the unseen.
Riding the wind toward the Nine Empyreans,
They savor the sweetness of cinnabar’s infant bloom.
Turning to bid farewell to the world’s children,
How could they know the numinous within the void?

Northward they ascend the Gate of Dark Mystery,
Hand in hand, weaving the Lofty Net.
Incense smoke scatters across the Eight Sceneries,
Mysterious winds stir the crimson waves.
Gazing upward past the Langlang Ford,
Looking down upon the winding valleys’ curves.
Jade flutes sing above the clouds,
Phoenixes cry through the Nine Radiant Mists.
Riding qi through the Great Void,
Why cling to the mountain’s edge?
Golden tally summons the feathered spirits,
Mustered troops shatter the myriad demons.
Rinsing and sipping the round dawn’s glow,
Accumulating eons like an infant’s teeth.
Amidst the clamor of frantic striving,
They know not what to do.

Northern mounds brim with misty clouds,
Crimson trees bear purple blossoms.
Azure herbs fall in the Phoenix Grove,
Emerald peaks adorn the crags’ embrace.
Spirit towers soar into the Great Void,
Jasper chambers join the Supreme Radiance.
Clouds rise within the winding chamber,
Eight winds fly through the dark sands.
Nine strings pluck the Emperor’s window,
Dragons roar in harmonious measure.
Fanning the gales across the Five Peaks,
Holding the tally to subdue the myriad demons.
In a moment’s glance,
Suddenly, eons have passed.
Alas for those born at dawn—
How could they know the span of ages?

At the secluded Palace of the Forest of Corners,
They move their spirits through the silent depths.
Supreme vision illumines the Six Voids,
Great and small all attain carefree wandering.
Dragon pipes entwine the Five Clouds,
Tiger roars startle the myriad threads.
The Three Simplicities form the lofty chart,
Cinnabar mists glow in the morning sky.
Feathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,
Purple chariots soar with flowered plumes.
Reining beyond the Nine Heavens,
They look up and down in boundless vastness.
Dust and foam congeal in clamor and filth,
Spirit withers, qi too fades.
Why not seek the distant journey?
Eight thousand years are but a single dawn.

Crossing the azure sea’s waves at dawn,
Flying wheels depart the green chambers.
Singing high to unseen companions,
Fanning canopies over the blue-green waves.
Three pacts with the jade-sky guests,
Five covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.
Feathered gales ascend the Emperor’s dawn,
Feasting in the Palace of Broad Cold.
Eight palaces strum the void,
Purple phoenixes sing the numinous winds.
Crimson mists veil the bright radiance,
Eight Sceneries soar through the Great Void.
Savoring the jasper springs’ nectar,
Vast and luminous, they return to infancy.
Supreme joy nourishes the Five Spirits,
Years accumulate like towering cliffs.
Shedding the mundane—how hard could it be?
Toil and turmoil lose the Heavenly Impulse.

At dawn, chariots ride the morning’s glow,
Loose reins set forth from Purple Clarity.
Floating wheels race through the Great Radiance,
Raising canopies in the Broad Cold’s court.
High Perfected gather in the Emperor’s hall,
Palace walls array the Western Numinous.
Scholars dance in the empty vastness,
Flying mists coil around brocade banners.
Tiger banners fan the divine winds,
Auspicious clouds wheel the dragon chariots.
Swiftly gazing across the Eight Directions,
A single glance topples eons.
O fleeting mortals,
Why not seek the Great Life?
The divine gardens bloom with hidden herbs,
Kun’s pool irrigates the jasper fields.
Gazing toward the Jade Clarity’s gates,
Towering above the Crimson Ford.
Purple mists reflect the Emperor’s seat,
Five clouds gleam over the Nine Mysteries.
Eight winds transcend the farthest realms,
Mysterious mists linger between green casements.

Three Primes dwell in the Western Palace,
In Eastern Florescence, fair ones reside.
Northern Darkness sings the Seven Whistles,
Bright maidens chant the Southern Perfected.
Striking the zhu instrument, they play the Crimson Pitch,
Jade tallies harmonize the Eight Strings.
Joining in resonance beyond fate’s course,
Together they echo the vast phoenix’s flight.
United in purpose, they command the myriad demons,
Dwelling amidst a thousand burdens.
How hard could it be to transcend?
Yet they open the gate to endless years.

Riding qi, they gaze upon the empty vastness,
Mounting the light, they rest in the Nine Heavens.
Dragon banners glow with broad radiance,
Feathered canopies birth the Eight Mists.
Gales flow without trace or hindrance,
My steeds too leave no ford behind.
Holding the tally, they enter Eastern Florescence,
Feasting at dusk on the Dark Loft’s peak.
Girding sashes, they carry the Five Numinous,
Loosening robes to meet the noble ones.
Dark resonance follows its own course,
Silence too has its karmic threads.
Together they soar on mighty wings,
A single fan stirs billions.

Crimson light floats in the dark dawn,
Purple chariots ride the clouds’ journey.
Gazing upward within the Golden Towers,
Looking down upon the Western Florescence City.
Eastern mists unfurl the Five Glows,
Divine essence shines with the Seven Numinous.
Veiled reflections record the Three Candles,
Flowing freely, they equal the dark and light.
Winds drum the empty vastness,
Incense smoke scatters the jasper court.
Hand in hand, they dance with the Weaving Maid,
Twin sashes entwine with brocade’s green.
Left and right, feathered banners intertwine,
Flowered canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.
Feasting beyond the Nine Degrees,
Right and wrong do not concern them.
Embracing the void within the Mud Pill,
Their celestial forms grow brighter each day.
How could they be like those in the realm of faults and filth,
Miserable and without purpose?

At Fusang’s emerald peaks,
Crimson clouds bloom faintly bright.
The Wave Terrace soars into the empty sky,
Four vistas reflect the High Clarity.
Flying light reins the purple wheels,
Three Simplicities guide the cinnabar chariots.
Reclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,
Roaring in the Mother’s court.
Washing feet in the azure rapids,
Carrying jasper flagons of divine wine.
At dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,
Drifting and swaying, they descend at times.
Briefly visiting the mists’ ruins,
They turn their chariots toward steadfast purity.
Mysterious gatherings follow their own summons,
Wandering freely through the hidden depths.
Only then do they know the bitterness of honor and disgrace,
Only then do they awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years.

In the winding chamber, one may find purity,
Nourishing the Perfected, awaiting the sun’s sincerity.
Why trouble oneself with the paths of the world?
A hundred ailments arise from this.

The Heavenly Court births golden blossoms,
Within, they shield against yin’s perversities.
Jade valleys echo the mysterious resonance,
Jasper qi mutually supports the net.
Heavenly Perfected stand above the sun,
Flying medicines spew numinous sands.
True dawn feasts the Heavenly Steeds,
Turning chariots toward the Dark Mystery’s home.
Immortals enter the chamber,
Their texts extinguish the hundred demons.
