### **The Seven Primordial Perfected Scriptures of the Central Heaven of the Purple Tenuity**
At the kalpas when the Celestial Worthy of Original Beginning transformed the August Emperors of the Heavens, he governed the Purple Tenuity Central Palace and convened a grand assembly to expound the Dao. At that time, the Lord Emperor of the Purple Tenuity, the host of sagely perfected immortals of the heavens, and the Seven Primordial Perfected Ones were all present at the joyous gathering, listening to the wondrous teachings. The deliverance of all beings was proclaimed, and the recitation of the cavernous verses radiated boundless light, illuminating the ten directions—above in the heavens and below on earth.

Yet in the long night of the Nine Dark Realms, within the Five Paths and Eight Gates, the exiled and the condemned, the hungry ghosts and destitute souls, endured all manner of suffering, bound in the Black Prison of the Northern Celestial One. By contrast, the heavenly paradises of the ten directions, the numinous abodes of immortals, the perfected and divine beings, and the sagely hosts who had attained the Dao—all enjoyed natural sustenance, carefree and blissful.

The Lord Emperor bowed his head and addressed the Celestial Worthy: "Today’s joyous assembly is ineffably wondrous. We have witnessed the heavens and hells, the disparity between suffering and joy, the differences in longevity and early death, poverty and prosperity, nobility and lowliness. We beseech your instruction, that all may clearly understand."

The Celestial Worthy replied: "Since I established heaven and earth, countless kalpas have passed. Yet in the lower mortal world, simplicity has waned and purity dispersed. Deluded thoughts bind them, the Ten Evils entangle, the Six Bandits occupy their hearts, and the Four Serpents lurk in their lungs. In their movements and repose, they neglect their bearing. They curse, slander, flatter, and form cliques. Disloyal and unfilial, unloving and unkind, unrighteous and unbenevolent, they indulge in greed and excessive taking. Thus, the demonic ghosts of the Six Heavens secretly seize their essence and souls, while the Five Dipper Stars hasten the reckoning of their lifespans. Not only do they fail to attain longevity and enduring vision, but they also sink into the realms of hungry ghosts and beasts.

You, the Seven Perfected Ones, if you wish to bestow grace and salvation, must uphold my laws and ordinances. On the third, fifteenth, and twenty-seventh days of each month, descend to the mortal realm to inspect, examine, and assess merits and transgressions. Investigate right and wrong, broadly expound the luminous might, and widely proclaim the teachings and precepts."

Thereupon, the Lord Emperor commanded the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords to weave the Dipper’s handle and spread its net, its pointer fiercely directed, aiding the Celestial Pass. He composed a hymn, saying:

*The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao,*
*Summons the Master of the Central Heaven.*
*Inspects the merits and transgressions of mortals,*
*Rewarding good and evil karmic ties.*
*The Black Book commands execution,*
*Not a hair’s breadth shows partiality.*

The Celestial Worthy addressed the Lord Emperor of the Purple Tenuity and the Seven Primordial Perfected Lords: "If you seek long life and enduring vision, to dispel disasters and escape calamities, extend lifespan and prolong years, and absolve transgressions, you may follow my teachings. In a separate chamber, make offerings, burn incense, light lamps, and recite and transmit the scriptures. The host of perfected ones will descend together, demonic essences will be subdued and vanquished, inauspicious omens will be severed and extinguished, past lives will transcend and be reborn, the Nine Dark Realms will cease their opposition, and the living will obtain blessings. Forever in harmony with profit and uprightness, emoluments and ranks will ascend, households will flourish, rulers and ministers will be at peace, and the world will know harmony."
