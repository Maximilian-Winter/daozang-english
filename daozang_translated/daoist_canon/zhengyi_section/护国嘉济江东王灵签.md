Alone you stride toward the clouds on high,
First among a thousand officials in jade halls nigh.

Fortune vast as the bound sea, lifespan firm as mountains flows.

**Explanation:**
Alone amid the clouds, peerless and supreme,

**Second Lot**
Waxing and waning follow heaven’s decree,
From this moment, all affairs shall prosper for thee.
If you ask of the future, retreat to still ground,
Yet first refine your heart—true virtue be found.

**Explanation:**
All things ebb and flow with time’s decree,
From misfortune to fortune, harmony shall be.
To ensure lasting good, cultivate virtue anew,

No need for toil—cease your anxiety.
Uphold filial piety, loyalty, and trust,
Fortune will flourish, misfortune turn to dust.

Labor in vain brings only sorrow and pain.
Serve your kin, treat others with reason’s grace,

But this year’s fortunes wane anew.
Burn incense, pray to gods above,
Lest blessings fade—regret will prove.

For fortune’s favor, pray without delay.

Your courtyard stands desolate, autumn’s chill has grown.
When Rat and Ox meet, yielding to the Snake’s reign,
All things revive like spring—no need for pain.

Prosperity and decline follow heaven’s design,
Not by human will, but by fate’s line.
When the time of *zi* and *chou* gives way to *si*,
All turns auspicious—like spring’s rebirth, joy shall rise.

Wealth and rank dwindle, fame comes late,
Disputes end well, illness can abate.
Marriage requires care, the traveler returns,
Wait for the hour—all affairs will turn.

---

**Sixth Lot**
Why labor with zither and flute’s sweet sound?
Each step feels like a thousand miles unbound.
Mutual doubt erodes trust between the two,
Do not entrust private longings to passion’s hue.

All efforts falter, no progress made,
Schemes fail, suspicion sown in the shade.
Seeking harmony stalls, near yet far,
Guard your resolve—change brings no star.

Loneliness at last brings sorrow near.

*(End of translation)*

**Explanation:**
Fate resists smooth passage, nor does it align with desire.

Avoid ambitious pursuits; venturing outward brings no gain.
Should you act recklessly, blessings fade and calamity arrives.

Seek not; fame remains unattained,
Wealth and rank remain unchanged.
Litigation brings no advantage; illness bodes ill.
Affairs fail; the traveler faces many delays.

---

**Twelfth Lot**
Hopes are set before spring’s arrival,
Yet autumn’s turn reveals no survival.
Only when the noble son of Qingjiang appears
Does life’s sustenance find safety at last.

**Explanation:**
Affairs proceed with hesitation; aspirations remain unfulfilled.
The noble one of Qingjiang—hope in him is justified.
Should you seek elsewhere, your efforts will be in vain.
Tread carefully and cultivate virtue, awaiting the appointed time.

Your fate remains obstructed this year,
So cast your line by the river’s frontier.
When the jade hare is reborn, wealth shall rise,
And you’ll stand above the crowd, a hero in guise.

Destiny is hindered; all matters proceed slowly.
It is best to maintain the old and conceal your talents until the hour.
When the year and month align with *mao*,
Or when the full moon arrives, your actions will flourish.

The time is not yet favorable—guard the old ways.
When the *mao* day arrives, fame and profit will follow.
Illness heals slowly; litigation ends in favor.
The traveler returns; affairs ultimately succeed.

---

At first sight of beauty, joy takes hold,
Yet who knows the trials that lie untold?
Do not marvel at the world’s cold and warm embrace—
The path of life is hard; you’ll learn through its maze.

**Explanation:**
Hopes for harmony give rise to discord instead.
People are fickle; trust not in fleeting words.
Examine yourself; let others not lead you astray.
Beware, beware—doubt and caution hold sway.

Though beginnings seem easy, the end proves hard.
Fame and profit are lost; illness finds no ease.
Litigation turns and twists; a daughter is conceived.
The traveler does not return; affairs face many bars.

---

Two households stand equal in station,
Yet without destined bond, avoid contention.
Wait for spring’s auspicious tidings,
Then tune the zither in the orchid chamber’s glow.

The match of households gives cause for concern—beware discord’s decree.
Wait until next spring; then all will be well.
Should you act rashly, your heart will labor in vain.

Official matters stretch on, unclear and vast,
Better to cease and return to the plow at last.

In this affair, consult only your brother’s name.

Litigation remains undecided; it is best to seek peace.
Beware the whispers of others—they stir winds on level ground.
Do not trust lightly, lest you walk into a snare.
Consult your brothers; who then can prevail?

Litigation is hard to resolve—harmony is prized.
Fame and profit elude; the traveler arrives.
Marriage remains unmade; illness bears a curse.
Wealth brings no advantage; in the end, no gain survives.

The price of fields and gardens is fair to discuss,
But when affairs reach the court, both sides suffer loss.

If you resort to schemes, you harm yourself instead.
In all dealings, act with humaneness and reason.

Fame and profit remain unchanged, as before.
The traveler is delayed; illness calls for exorcism.
Be cautious—preserve your well-being.

Yet why do endless matters weigh so heavy there?
Firmly plant your feet upon the solid ground—

Proceed with patience—haste will only harm you.
Turn to virtue and pray for peace.
Transform misfortune into blessing, and avoid many woes.

---

**Forty-Fifth Lot**

Yet today, gazing at the mountains from horseback—
How could it compare to the freedom of riding an ox?

By nature, you are already noble, surpassing ordinary folk.
The more you possess, the greater the burden—disaster will befall you.
Return to your true nature and enjoy peace.

You climb mountains and ford streams in bitter cold,
Yet how can brothers and kin find rest?
If not for the call of one born in the Year of the Tiger,
Who in your household could shield you from deep dread?

You traverse hardship, yet fortune turns against you.
Household affairs are in disarray; matters twist and turn.
Only by meeting a person of wealth and rank
May you be lifted up—else disaster will follow.

**Seventy-Ninth Lot**
Observe carefully the *qian-hai* incoming dragon;
with *kan* at *wu*, the dwelling is naturally secure.
If shifted to *chou-gen*, yin and yang reverse—
the gate withers, the household declines.
