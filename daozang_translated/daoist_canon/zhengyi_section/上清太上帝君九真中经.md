**The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfections of the Supreme Lord of the Great Clarity, Scroll One**

*Transmitted by the Perfected of the Great Void, the Supreme Immortal of Mount Nanyue, Master Red Pine (Chisongzi)*

**Esoteric Instructions of the Supreme Lord’s Scripture of the Nine Perfections**

The Central Yellow Venerable Lord is the younger brother of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Tenuity Heaven. In the second year of the Qingxu Shanghuang era, amidst primordial chaos, he was born. The radiance of the sun doubled its brilliance, its light intermingling with the numinous. Five-colored clouds formed a canopy, and auspicious mists settled in profound stillness.

At the age of seven, he already grasped the essentials of longevity and the methods of celestial immortality. With distant contemplation, he reverently embraced the mysterious and true. In solitude, his spirit dwelled in the wellspring of the divine. He embodied the eight absolutes, grasped emptiness to attain wholeness, freed himself from the nets of ornate entanglements, and roamed the unbounded expanse of the void. He delved into the obscure depths of the dark abyss, stood atop the towering waves of the mysterious, and guided his reins through the shifting paths. He clarified the myriad ways, illumined the cold winds of wondrous awakening, and soared hidden among the celestial clouds. He stirred the primordial at the edge of heaven, circulated the nine *qi* through the radiant ford, harmonized his refined rhythm with the orchid waves, and congealed purity in swirling stillness. Strange sounds echoed in the unseen, clouds gathered in the eight mists. He pondered the Great Beginning, his mind absorbed in the lofty image. He sought the paths of the ten directions, searched the spirits of the hidden origin, plucked the whirlwind to shake his brush, and concealed his purity in the subtle and obscure. His eyes opened the gate of the mysterious origin, his hands parted the courts of the myriad chambers. Gazing upward, he rejoiced in the divine craft; looking downward, he pitied the five hardships. He wandered in accord with his teachers, his insight profound and luminous. He cleansed his spirit’s brilliance, returning his thoughts to the true and numinous. Thus, the celestial melody wondrously arose, and karmic affinities mysteriously converged.

Thereupon, the Supreme One bestowed upon him the *Scripture of the Nine Perfections of the Supreme Lord*, along with the *Eight Esoteric Sayings of the Dao*. Through cultivation and attainment, he received the scripture and was named the Perfected of the Great Ultimate. Among the four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Central Yellow Venerable Lord stands to the left. He is adorned with the script of the Dark Dragon, the talisman of the Divine Tiger, a belt with golden bells, and holds the purple-furred staff. He wears a headscarf of golden essence. At times, he dons a crown of morning radiance, rides a flying dragon of dense splendor, and mounts the cloud of the Three Purities.

The *Eight Esoteric Sayings* state: Those who wish to practice the methods of the Nine Perfections must maintain a prolonged fast in a pure chamber. On the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and one’s own life-destiny day, one should bathe in east-flowing water infused with the five fragrances. On the night of the *jiazi* day, after bathing at midnight, burn incense to the left and right, face one’s life-destiny direction, bow twice in the heart, and pray:

*"Supreme Highest Perfected, Nine Numinous Radiant Essences,
Five Spirits of the Supreme Lord, Great One Returning to Clarity,
Grant that I ascend as a flying immortal to the Purple Court,
Bathe in the Flowery Pond, my body and spirit purified.
May the Peach Lord guard my destiny, the Supreme Lord return to infancy,
Ascend to the Great Void, my five viscera self-generated."*

The Supreme One said: Humans are formed by the binding of essence and the accumulation of *qi*, receiving the embryo and gathering blood. The obscure yellow and white congeal, the cinnabar and purple merge with mist. Thus, bones solidify, saliva is secreted, fluids disperse and flow. After four transformations and nine palaces unite, the five spirits command the body, and the Great One fixes their register. Suddenly, they stand; in an instant, they are complete. Without effort, they are fully formed; in a moment, they are born. Then the nine spirits enter and settle in their palaces. The five viscera mysteriously arise, and the five spirits preside over them.

Parents only know the beginning of my birth, unaware that the five spirits of the Supreme Lord have come to dwell within. The human body contains honored spirits whose abode is not fixed. They move in and out of the upper, middle, and lower *dantian*, alternating between *yin* and *yang*, shedding the old and absorbing the new, circulating and transporting the primordial essence.

The great spirit arises from the void within, forming the body. It irrigates the substance and refines it, transforming into radiant light—not like the three *hun* and seven *po*, which are accumulations of numinous *qi* born from one’s parents. The nine souls of the Supreme Lord transform their forms in an instant, suddenly becoming honored spirits with nine names, called the Nine Perfected Lords. This is the Great One, the Supreme Lord, merging and transforming as one.

Divided into upper and lower, they traverse the myriad paths. If you can cultivate them, you will emerge from water and enter fire, your five viscera perpetually regenerated. Maintain a prolonged fast and seclude yourself to preserve your true nature.

This text is also called *The Esoteric Instructions of the Nine Perfections*, *The Supreme Flying Writ*, *The Released Treasures of Foreign Lands*, and *The Numinous Chapters of the Divine Continent*. Though it bears four names, it is but one precious scripture.

**The First Perfection Method:** On the life-destiny day of the first month, or on the days of *jiazi* or *jiaxu* at dawn, the five spirits of the Supreme Lord and the Great One merge as one, transforming into a great spirit within the heart, named the Celestial Essence Lord, styled *Flying Life, Supreme Hero*, with the appearance of a newborn infant.

On that day at dawn, enter your chamber, place your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly visualize the Celestial Essence Lord seated within your heart, calling him the Great Spirit. Have the Great Spirit exhale purple *qi* in abundance, swirling ninefold around the outside of your heart. The *qi* ascends to pierce the Mud Pill Palace, uniting inner and outer as one.

When complete, click your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and pray:

*"Celestial Essence Great Lord, Flying Life, Supreme Hero,
The Supreme Lord inwardly transforms, appearing within my heart.
Clad in crimson robes, crowned with a cinnabar cap,
Left bearing the Dragon Script, right adorned with the Tiger Talisman,
Harmonizing essence in the Three Paths, uniting spirit with the Upper Origin.
Five numina hold the talisman, completing the union with the Supreme Lord.
Exhaling purple blossoms, nourishing the heart and congealing spirit,
The Red Visceral Palace self-generates, attaining flight as an immortal."*

When finished, repeat the practice at midnight, following the same method. This is the natural merging and transformation of the five spirits of the Supreme Lord, becoming one great spirit in due time.

What is called "spontaneous alignment with life" no longer requires awaiting signs or meditative visualization to achieve. The Second True Method: On the day of one’s life-star in the third month, or on an *jiǎ-shēn* day at the *chén* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One unite with the five spirits, merging and transforming inwardly to become one great spirit. This great spirit disperses its form and scatters its *qi*, filling all the joints, and is named the *Firm Jade Lord*. At this time, enter the chamber, place your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly focus your vision. Visualize the *Firm Jade Lord*, whose name is *Congealed Feather Pearl*, entering and sitting within the throat’s gastric tube, transforming into white *qi* that permeates the hundred bones. Envision the great spirit exhaling white *qi* to encircle the bones ninefold, both within and without dense as misty clouds. When complete, click your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and pray:

*"Firm Jade Great Lord, enter my bones,
Clad in plain robes, crowned with a white cap,
Your name, Congealed Feather Pearl, nourishes the nine gates.
Left bearing the Dragon Script, right adorned with Golden Perfection,
Exhaling white qi, strengthening bones and congealing sinews,
White bones never decay, sinews never dissolve,
A hundred joints bloom with blossoms, enabling me to fly as an immortal."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation. On the ninth true day, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits naturally merge and transform, instantly becoming one great spirit, no longer requiring prior signs or visualization to complete the union. Its form resembles that of an infant, and the nine true methods follow the same pattern. This is the nine *hún* and seven *pò* transforming the five spirits into a congealed union, the Supreme Lord’s ninefold metamorphosis. The Great One and Three Dipper Stars together grasp the talismanic register, determining the mysterious and pure record, enabling the practitioner to attain long life without death and ascend to the immortal courts. This Dao is profound and secret, treasured by the highest spirits. Those without immortal registers may not hear of it; those without prior karmic affinity may not witness it. Those who hear or see it are born in accord with destiny, attaining union with the numinous. Thus, through hidden resonance and auspicious convergence, they are delivered from obscurity and comprehend the subtle. Heavenly spirits descend, jade blossoms greet their gaze, so the nine truths firm the heart, and the eight paths awaken insight. This is the union of the Three Origins’ talismans, not something sought by those who walk the earthly path. First, make a covenant oath, then may it be proclaimed.

The Third True Method: On the day of one’s life-star in the fourth month, or on an *jiǎ-wǔ* or *dīng-mǎo* day at the *sì* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform to generate a great spirit. This great spirit suddenly disperses its form, becoming a dense yellow *qi* that flows into all the essence and blood, named the *Primal Life Lord*, whose name is *Yellow Tranquility Master of Mystery*. At the *sì* hour, enter the chamber, place your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly focus your vision. Visualize the *Primal Life Lord* circulating through the body’s blood vessels and essence-fluids, exhaling yellow *qi* to envelop and permeate the external pores and meridians, as well as the body’s ninefold layers, so that within and without are suffused with yellow *qi*. When complete, click your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and pray:

*"Primal Life Great Lord, together irrigate this blood-body,
Clad in yellow robes, crowned with a purple lotus,
Left bearing the Tiger Record, right adorned with the Dragon Script,
Feathered robes draped above, majestic presence upheld,
Exhaling yellow essence, securing the blood and stabilizing the void,
True qi enters daily, evil qi dissolves,
Essence brims, fluids overflow, the nine numina all reside,
Enabling me to fly as an immortal, in harmony with Heaven and Earth."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation.

The Fourth True Method: On an *jiǎ-chén* day, one’s life-star day, or a *wù-yín* day at the *wǔ* hour in the sixth month, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits transform into one great spirit, entering the liver, named the *Azure Clarity Lord*, whose name is *Luminous Wheel Youth*. On this day at the *wǔ* hour, enter the chamber, place your hands upon your knees, hold your breath, close your eyes, and inwardly focus your vision. Visualize the *Azure Clarity Great Lord* entering and sitting within the liver, exhaling azure *qi* to encircle the liver ninefold. When complete, click your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and pray:

*"Azure Clarity Great Lord, enter my liver,
Clad in azure robes, crowned with a kingfisher cap,
Left bearing the Tiger Seal, right adorned with the Dragon Script,
Your name, Luminous Wheel Youth, treasured true clarity,
Exhaling azure qi, nourishing the liver and guiding the spirit,
The Azure Visceral Palace self-generates, ascending as a celestial immortal,
The Great One guards essence, embracing the *pò* and restraining the *hún*,
The Supreme Lord presents the register, enabling me to attain the true."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation.

The Fifth True Method: On the third day of the seventh month, or on one’s life-star day or a *gēng-wǔ* day at the *sì* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform into one great spirit within the spleen, named the *Nurturing Radiance Lord*, whose name is *Great Granary Master*. At this time, the practitioner enters the chamber, places their hands upon their knees, holds their breath, closes their eyes, and inwardly focuses their vision. Visualize the *Nurturing Radiance Lord* entering and sitting within the spleen, exhaling green *qi* to encircle the spleen ninefold, the *qi* ascending to the *Mud Pill Palace*, within and without thoroughly suffused. When complete, click your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and pray:

*"Nurturing Radiance Great Lord, enter my spleen,
Irrigating the Three Origins above, this is the Great Granary,
Clad in green robes, crowned with a lotus cap,
Left bearing Jade Numinosity, right adorned with Majestic Spirit,
The Five Numinous hold axes, seven lightning bolts and nine thunderclaps,
Exhaling green blossoms, nourishing the spleen and settling the *hún*,
The Yellow Visceral Palace self-generates, ascending as a perfected one."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation.

The Sixth True Method: On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, or on one’s life-star day or a *gēng-shēn* day at the *shēn* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform into one great spirit within the lungs, named the *Upper Origin Plain Jade Lord*, whose name is *Liáng of the Southern Center Youth*. At this time, the practitioner enters the chamber, places their hands upon their knees, holds their breath, closes their eyes, and inwardly focuses their vision. Visualize the *Upper Origin Plain Jade Lord* entering and sitting within the lungs, exhaling five-colored *qi* to encircle the lungs ninefold, ascending to the *Mud Pill Palace*, within and without dense and luminous.

When finished, strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and recite the incantation:

*"Upper Origin Great Lord, come and sit within the lungs.
Liáng of the Three Heavens’ Southern Center, Radiant Flower Central Youth,
clad in dragon robes, crowned with the Yellow Dawn’s splendor,
right hand grasping the Imperial Register, the Supreme Lord sharing the wheel,
the Great One holding the Chart, right hand wielding the Sacred Scroll,
left side bearing the Mystic Writ, right side girded with Tiger Script,
mouth exhaling fivefold qi."*

Repeat the practice at this time.

The Seventh True Method: On the nineteenth day of the ninth month, or on one’s life-star day or a *wù-xū* day at the *yǒu* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform into one great spirit, which suddenly divides into two, dispersing to sit within the two kidneys. They are named the *Mysterious Yang Lord*, with the style *Master of Dark Radiance*. At this appointed time, the practitioner enters the chamber, places their hands upon their knees, closes their eyes, holds their breath, and inwardly focuses their vision. Visualize the *Mysterious Yang Lord* transforming and entering the two kidneys, exhaling azure *qi* to encircle the kidneys ninefold, ascending to pierce the *Mud Pill Palace*, within and without dense and luminous.

When finished, strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and recite the incantation:

*"Mysterious Yang Supreme Lord, enter and sit within the kidneys,
clad in purple robes, head wrapped in the Dawn’s sash,
left side bearing the Dragon Talisman, right side girded with Phoenix Script.
Master of Dark Radiance, ever before the Supreme Lord,
mouth exhaling azure blossoms to irrigate the kidneys’ numinous root.
The Most High lingers, above welcoming the Supreme Lord,
below inscribing my name in the ledgers.
Black *qi* nurtures spontaneous generation,
the body becomes a flying immortal,
ascending north to the Mysterious Gate,
roaming the Celestial Pass,
striding the Upper Void,
hand in hand with the five spirits."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation.

The Eighth True Method: On the twelfth day of the tenth month, or on one’s life-star day or a *xīn-sì* day at the *wǔ* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform into one great spirit within the gallbladder, named the *Containing Radiance Lord*, with the style *Mysterious Essence of the Northern Terrace*. At this appointed time, the practitioner enters the chamber, places their hands upon their knees, holds their breath, closes their eyes, and inwardly focuses their vision. Visualize the *Containing Radiance Lord* entering and sitting within the gallbladder, exhaling five-colored *qi* to encircle the gallbladder ninefold, ascending to pierce the *Mud Pill Palace*, clouds and mist dense and luminous within and without.

When finished, strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and recite the incantation:

*"Containing Radiance Great Lord, come and sit within the gallbladder,
clad in brocade robes, crowned with a purple coronet.
Mysterious Essence of the Northern Terrace, transforming to generate numinous mist,
left side bearing Divine Radiance, right side girded with Jade Perfection,
mouth exhaling fivefold *qi* to nourish the gallbladder and strengthen the body.
The Three Commands of the Supreme Emperor bind me in kinship.
Peach Lord records the talisman, the Great One’s Seven Arrays,
harmonizing essence, treasuring blood, governing fluids, and fortifying sinews.
May I ascend above to become a flying immortal,
northward to attend the Void Sovereign,
riding the chariot of the Three Origins."*

When finished, repeat the practice at the midnight hour of *qi*-generation.

The Ninth True Method: On the twenty-eighth day of the eleventh month, or on one’s life-star day or a *bǐng-zǐ* day at the *sì* hour, the Supreme Lord and Great One’s five spirits merge and transform into one great spirit within the Purple Chamber of the *Mud Pill Palace*, named the *Supreme Prosperity August Lord*, with the style *Primordial Spirit of the First Numen*. This spirit is the ancestral father of the Supreme Lord, thus from nine transformations the merged souls revert to the ancestral form, descending into the Upper Palace. As the immortal writ declares: "To unbind the knots within the womb, none but the ancestor can disperse and transform them; none but the father can uproot them; none but the Supreme Lord can rectify the soul." Therefore, the ancestor and father must come to cultivate and stabilize the form and spirit for eternal endurance.

At each appointed time, the practitioner should bathe, burn incense to the left and right, enter the chamber, and sit upright, placing their hands upon their knees. Visualize the *Supreme Prosperity August Lord* within the Purple Chamber of the *Mud Pill Palace*, exhaling purple *qi* to encircle the head ninefold. When finished, exhale purple *qi* to encircle the eyes’ inner and outer aspects ninefold. When finished, exhale purple *qi* to encircle the tongue ninefold. When finished, exhale purple *qi* to encircle the teeth ninefold. In all, four sets of nine—thirty-six encirclings of *qi*—so that the entire body, within and without, becomes dense and luminous, suffused as if the sun dwells within.

When all is complete, strike the teeth thirty-six times, swallow saliva thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*"August Ancestral Lord of Supreme Prosperity, Primordial Spirit of the Imperial Sovereign,
enthroned within the Purple Chamber, palace of the Mud Pill,
Yellow Gate and Golden Chamber, merging the nine souls,
souls generating myriad transformations to become the Supreme Lord.
Five spirits attend in service, the Seven *Qi* of the Upper Perfected,
dragon robes and phoenix mantle, purple and emerald, azure and green,
hand grasping the Imperial Talisman, head crowned with a radiant coronet,
left side bearing Jade Luminance, right side girded with Tiger Script,
seated below the sun and moon, mouth exhaling purple mist,
encircling teeth and tongue, irrigating eyes and lips,
issuing cinnabar and entering the void, summoning *po* and calling *hun*,
congealing essence and securing the womb, the Six Harmonies in eternal joy.
Ascend to the Great Subtlety, ranked among the immortal officials."*

Thus, the Nine True Methods of the year are complete. Cycling through them anew, the *Mud Pill Palace* governs the numinous, the Eye Youths attain full clarity, the five viscera generate spontaneously, and the blood and vessels preserve their fluids. Should the body not yet ascend and merge with the dawn, it is fitting to conceal one’s radiance and appear mundane, temporarily entering the Great Yin. For those whose bodies have passed through the Three Offices, the Three Offices cannot transgress. The Nine Perfected summon the *po*, the Great One guards the skeleton, the Three Origins protect the *qi*, the Great One gathers the *hun*. Bones and flesh do not decay, the five viscera do not perish. One can die and live, be yin and yang, emerge from the void and enter nonbeing, coexisting with heaven and earth.

Thus, when Daoists cultivate stillness to nurture the form, the *qi* of the Nine Perfected responds. The Three Origins’ flying essence fills and empties, the Great One embraces my corpse to return to its original substance. Subtle indeed, profound indeed! Those who constantly practice the Nine True Methods shall have a hundred spirits bow in obeisance and ten thousand ghosts receive their commands.

Should one pass through the Great Yin, the form and bones shall not decay, the five viscera shall regenerate of themselves. After twenty-four years, one shall attain rebirth. Suddenly awakening, clearly perceiving—vividly recalling the entry into the Great Yin as though it were but a night’s slumber. Startled, one finds oneself already beyond the coffin and outer casket; radiantly, one sits atop the mountain’s peak. Such is the subtle mystery of the Nine Perfected, the utmost divinity of the Lord Emperor.

Those who practice this Dao must speak sparingly and still the heart, their words never touching upon death, their conduct upright and free from excess, their speech never veering toward sensuality. They must also cherish *qi* to nurture the spirit, maintain composed movements, hold the breath to its utmost, exhale gently, emerging from the void and entering nonbeing in an unbroken, continuous flow. This is where the Lord Emperor abides, where the Mysterious Mother draws near—by this, one may preserve the Five Spirits and invoke the Nine Perfected.

**The Supreme Lord Emperor’s Nine Perfected Treasure Talisman** *(original talisman omitted)*
This talisman should be written in cinnabar on the eight solar terms and ingested.

The Perfected of the Great Ultimate says: One should recite it silently, chanting it thrice at dawn and midnight on the new and full moons to harmonize the Nine *Hun*, restore the *qi* of the Emperor’s Chamber, rectify the human spirit, dispel evil, open the hundred passages, and bring clarity. This is a precious secret—do not recklessly disclose it. This is what is called the *Dragon Script of the Three Heavens*.

The Supreme Nine Perfected compose the Dragon Script; the Lord Emperor’s divine court makes the body its home. The Heavenly Honored One dwells in the Crimson Chamber, residing in the Hall of Light, seated upright in the Great Ultimate, the Mysterious Cinnabar unerring. The Mysterious Mother rides the Three Primordial Essences’ chariot; the Primordial Father reins the crimson-feathered flying carriage. To the left, the scarlet phoenix guides; to the right, the numinous crow steers. A square inch of true alignment gathers the spirits of the Upper Realm. The Cinnabar Terrace and Flame Tower scatter radiance into the void, soaring high in the Supreme Tenuity. In hand, the Purple Register; the numinous abyss and pristine pool brim with golden nectar and liquid jade. The Nine *Qi* linger and circle; flying blossoms and leaping clouds. Within dwells a great spirit, beyond naming.

The Father drives the primordial *qi*; the Mother bears the mysterious axle. The sun’s essence crowns the head; the tiger’s register girds the waist. Streams of fire stretch ten thousand *zhang*; eyes blaze with dragon candles. The Heavenly Emperor holds the tally; phoenix robes and feathered regalia adorn the body. Constantly abiding in the Nine Perfected, nurtured by the Divine Emperor, one resides in the Purple Chamber, north of the Hall of Light. Bathing life to renew essence, guarding the Mysterious Valley, entering and exiting the Chamber of Destiny, roaming the Cavern Pass, at times entering the Central Palace, ascending to the Great Origin. Lingering amidst the Four *Qi*, the Nine Stars divide and disperse. The five viscera flourish; the Great One guards the *hun*. Resting in the secluded court, commanding the Seven Spirits—should you chant this, you shall ascend at dawn.

Through refined resonance and wondrous response, you shall harness and ride the numinous beasts. Mountains crumble, waters surge—call out, and they shall answer with thunderous aid. At the appointed hour of the living earth, you shall ascend to the celestial lodgings. When the Nine Perfected Dao is complete, to leak it brings calamity. The Three Offices will unleash their poisons, meting out punishment for divulgence. Transmit it only to those of immortal potential, carefully assessing their capacity for accomplishment.

**The Eight Secret Sayings of the Yellow Elder Lord of the Central Palace**
The secret words whisper: Still the heart in a tranquil chamber, vast and empty, serene and true. Let lofty contemplation and wondrous vision soar and bathe the Mysterious Person. If sincerity summons the celestial convergence and essence awakens to the radiant dawn, you shall behold the *qi* of the Cinnabar Effulgence, the Three Primordial Essences’ flying clouds, the eight chariots and crimson carriages, the purple auroras and jade wheels. The Upper Clarity floats in gaze; the Three Origins circle in reins. The High Sovereign holds the tally; the numinous youths grasp the shafts. The Primordial Simplicity bears the canopy; the Southern Culmen leans upon the carriage. The Lord Emperor guards the chamber; the Five Spirits of the Conjoined Effulgence and the Seven *Qi* of continuous brightness intertwine. Lofty radiance coils afar; obscure light reflects outward. The dragon countenance glows dimly; the image illuminates the Great Void. The Seven Observances flow and drift.

Should you diligently await this, you shall ascend as an immortal in broad daylight. Should the cloud chariot suddenly descend, you shall ascend at dawn without need for further refinement—no frost to congeal, no blossoms to bathe, no mysterious marrow or golden elixir.

**First Secret Saying:**
On the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring), during the *jia* or *yi* days of the first month, at dawn, gaze northward. If you see clouds of purple, green, and white, these are the Three Primordial Essences’ flying clouds of the Supreme Three Origin Lords. At that time, the Three Origin Lords ride the Eight Chariots to ascend to the Heavenly Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign. Should you await and witness these three-colored clouds, concentrate your mind, bow, and strike your breast. Mentally, bow four times and declare: *"Your humble descendant, so-and-so, from youth has cherished the Dao and virtue, cultivating the Nine Perfected, bathing the Five Spirits, all recorded by the Heavenly Emperor and the Lord Emperor. Today, by great fortune, I encounter the Three Origin Lords’ procession. I humbly beseech to attend and serve at the wheel’s hub, to offer any prayer or wish."* Should you thrice witness the Lords’ chariots, you shall ascend as an immortal in broad daylight, no longer requiring other visualizations or myriad practices.

**Fourth Secret Saying:**
On the day of the *Xiazhi* (Summer Solstice) and the *wu-yin* or *ji-mao* days of the *jia-xu* decade, at dawn, gaze southeast. If you see clouds of red, white, and green, these are the Three Primordial Essences’ clouds of the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang.

At that time, the Great Emperor Lord of Fusang, riding the luminous chariot of the Eightfold Radiance, ascends to the Supreme Subtlety Palace. Upon seeing this, pray and bow in your heart as in the method above. Should you witness it four times, clouds and dragons shall appear to welcome you, and you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

**Fifth Secret Saying:**
On the day of *Liqu* (Beginning of Autumn) and the *wu-zi* or *ji-chou* days of the *jia-shen* decade, at dawn, gaze due west. If you see clouds of white, red, and purple, these are the Three Primordial Essences’ clouds of the Supreme Perfected of the Great Primordial and the Heavenly Thearch White Emperor. At that time, the Supreme Perfected White Emperor rides the jade carriage of ethereal grace to ascend to the Jade Heaven’s Mysterious August Perfected. You should pray and bow, entreating as in the method above. Should you witness it five times, you shall ascend as an immortal in broad daylight.

**Sixth Secret Saying:**
On the day of the *Qiufen* (Autumnal Equinox) and the *wu-xu* or *ji-hai* days of the *jia-wu* decade, at dawn, gaze south.

At that time, the Supreme Perfected Red Emperor rides the crimson-jade azure carriage to ascend to the Terrace of Soaring Winds, where he visits the Lady of the Ninefold Numinous. Should you see this, pray and bow as in the method above. Should you witness it four times, you shall ascend as an immortal in broad daylight.

**Seventh Secret Saying:**
On the day of *Lidong* (Beginning of Winter) and the *wu-shen* or *ji-you* days of the *jia-chen* decade, at dawn, gaze southwest. If you see clouds of green, purple, and blue, these are the Three Primordial Essences’ clouds of the Supreme Perfected Thearch and August Ancestor. At that time, the Supreme Perfected Thearch and August Ancestor ride the cinnabar chariot of the Eightfold Mysterious Effulgence to ascend to the Highest Nine Heavens’ Jade Emperor. You should pray and bow in your heart as in the method above. Should you witness it four times, the August Lord of the Purple Aurora and Grand Monad shall come to welcome you in a phoenix-patterned feathered chariot, and you shall ascend at dawn in broad daylight.

**Eighth Secret Saying:**
On the day of the *Dongzhi* (Winter Solstice) and the *wu-wu* or *ji-wei* days of the *jia-yin* decade, at dawn, gaze due east. If you see clouds of vermilion, azure, and yellow, these are the Three Primordial Essences’ clouds of the Jade Consort of the Great Empyrean and the Supreme Perfected of the Grand Void. At that time, the Jade Consort of the Great Empyrean and the Supreme Perfected of the Grand Void ride the jade carriage of lingering grace to ascend to the Palace of the Grand August, where they summon the Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety. Upon seeing these clouds, bow, pray, and entreat as in the method above. Should you witness it three times, the Jade Emperor shall command the Yellow Thearch of the Central Palace, who will come to welcome you in a crimson-jade dragon chariot, and you shall ascend at dawn in broad daylight.

Here end the Eight Secret Sayings. Upon seeing these, you should concentrate in your heart, knock your head, clap your cheeks, and bow four times, making your entreaty as in the method above. You must first bathe, burn incense, and await the appointed time, gazing outward from your heart for the duration of a meal before returning to your chamber. The Three Primordial Essences’ clouds each have their own colors, layered above and below in the order described. For instance, if on the day of *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) you see the Three Origin’s Three Primordial Essences’ clouds, the purple cloud will be above, the green cloud next, and the white cloud below, all intermingling in obscurity. Observe them carefully. The "first decade" refers to the ten days following the *jia-zi* day at the start of the month, during which the *jia-zi* day falls. Should you see these clouds on days or at times not specified, you should still bow and pray, for this will be three times as efficacious as seeing them on the appointed day. On other days, it will be equivalent to witnessing them on the *jia-zi* day.

All who practice the Way of the Nine Perfected and oversee the affairs of the Eight Dao shall have their forms guarded by heavenly beings, and the Perfected August shall protect their life and bones. Those not recorded in the jade registers of immortality shall not be shown this scripture by the netherworld, and though they may seek it earnestly, they shall never behold it. Only those whose names are inscribed in the mysterious books and who are destined for transcendence shall witness these signs.

When practicing this Dao, ensure no one treads upon your shoes or touches your headscarf, coarse robe, or garments. Keep your footwear fresh and your clothing clean. In practicing this Dao, do not violate its prohibitions.

**Method of the Five Qi of the Supreme Perfected of the Great Primordial to Summon the Thearch Emperor:**
Regularly at cockcrow on *wu* or *ji* days, close your eyes and visualize the green qi of the east, vast as a bowstring, emanating from the sun and filling your head to enter the Mud-Pill Palace. Then, two streams of green mist emerge from your eyes, billowing and transforming into two youths. Their upper and lower garments are blue, and they resemble infants taking their first steps. The youth from the left eye is named the Flying Numinous of the Thearch Emperor, and the youth from the right eye is named the Morning Infant of the Grand Monad. Both stand at your left and right, attending to your daily life. Visualize them distinctly for a long while. When finished, knock your teeth nine times, swallow your saliva nine times, and softly recite the prayer:

*"The Five Numinous of the East, the sun’s qi gleams azure.
The Thearch’s two youths swiftly arise,
Entering the Mud-Pill at dawn,
Refining the brain and treasuring the form.
Left transforms, right transmutes,
Attaining the name of the Dao.
May I ascend to audience
In the Purple Clarity of the Great Primordial."*

When finished, concentrate intently on the names of the two youths, and no harm shall befall you. These two youths are the hun-soul of the Mysterious Mother and the spirit of the Mysterious Father, hence they assume the names of the Thearch Emperor and Grand Monad to protect your hun-soul, rectify your po-soul, and preserve your hun and po in correctness, so that your singular form may endure forever. If you cultivate this for eighteen years, you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

Visualize the two youths emerging from your eyes, allowing the green qi to suddenly transform and bring them into being. Keep them at your sides, and have the two youths each exhale green qi to envelop and permeate your entire body, penetrating within and without.

Here ends the first scroll of *The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Clarity*.

**The Second Scroll of The Central Scripture of the Nine Perfected of the Supreme Emperor of the Great Clarity**
*The Jade Dawn’s Crimson Effulgence Scripture of the Rushing Sun*
*The Jade Dawn’s Yellow Effulgence Scripture of the Flowing Moon*

The *Rushing Sun* and *Flowing Moon* Hidden Dao are treasured and concealed by the Supreme Clarity’s Supreme Ultimate, the Nine August Ones, and the Four Perfected Ones, and are the jade chapters of the Mysterious Void Primordial Sovereign. Unless one’s name is inscribed in the Golden Pavilion and Jade Register, or bears the green script of Eastern Florescence, one shall never hear or glimpse the titles of these two chapters. Those who practice them must first purify themselves in retreat for a hundred days, severing all worldly affairs, before proceeding. With prolonged practice, one ascends to the sun and moon, and is granted fifteen jade youths and fifteen jade maidens.

The *Crimson Effulgence Scripture of the Rushing Sun* and the *Yellow Effulgence Chapter of the Flowing Moon* are the numinous and secret texts of the Supreme Jade Emperor Lord. They are concealed within the chambers of the Nine Heavens, upon the Cinnabar-Jade Terrace. None but those who diligently cultivate the Dao with a sincere heart, and whose destiny is inscribed in the records of the Flying Mystery Celestial Immortals, may ever behold or hear of them. Even the mere mention of their titles must not be spoken carelessly; violators shall be examined by the Three Offices, and neither heaven nor earth shall pardon them. Initially, they may be transmitted to one person every three hundred years; thereafter, once every seven hundred years. Only if the divine perfected ones secretly reveal that someone is worthy may they be transmitted. The method of transmission is passed from master to disciple in accordance with the statutes of the Revered Mystery.

The residual qi of the seven *po* transforms into dragons and tigers, guarding the earthly passes beneath one’s feet. The residual spirits of the three *hun* manifest as clouds of the Five Numinous Ones, shining within one’s headscarf. Should one violate these precepts, the heart trembles and the mind quails, leaving one dismayed and lost, for the spirit is diminished, the *hun* scattered, and the radiance of essence obscured and stagnant. One must ever be vigilant: beneath the soles of one’s shoes, no soil should linger, for the stench of filth and earth is taboo; within and without one’s garments, no grime or impurity should remain, for the foul vapors of sloth and defilement are forbidden.

Seventeen exalted jade youths and seventeen jade maidens attend the scriptures, reporting the practitioner’s merits and transgressions and warding off the myriad inauspicious influences. When one reads the scriptures, one must retire to a secluded chamber, burning incense to the left and right. At the time of transmission, the recipient must face the master in purification. According to the method of transmission, both must observe the retreat in stillness, sincerely focusing the heart, contemplating the spirits, and unifying the will.

This precious scripture contains the affairs of the Nine Perfected and the names of the twenty-four spirits. In visualization and invocation, all are spoken in the numinous tongue of the highest heavens. Thus, one receives them with solemn retreat, beginning with the oath against leakage and betrayal. Master and disciple must together observe the retreat for twenty-four days, with an additional day of purification before and after. At the conclusion of each day, the scripture is brought forth and entrusted to the disciple. Once the disciple has copied it, they cut their hair and bind it as a token of sincerity to present to the master. In the present age, nine *zhang* of white silk are used for the oath, and the wound from the blood covenant is made with white silk—symbolizing the primordial *qi* of the Great Simplicity, and the number nine representing the Nine Perfected. After receiving the scripture, one must not reveal the oath or disclose the text, lest one transgress virtue, corrupt rectitude, indulge in idle speech, or lose one’s conduct, thereby defiling the Dao and the Perfected.

Those who diligently cultivate this scripture shall ascend in broad daylight to the dawn. Those who violate their vows shall condemn their seven generations of ancestors to the torments of hell. The Supreme Clarity’s Purple Essence Lord and the August Origin’s Purple Numinous Dao Lord eternally guard the Cavernous Chambers within, gazing upon the Nine Heavens, reposing beneath the radiant constellations, slumbering within the Nine Essences, restraining the *hun* and *po* in the northern heights, refining the Five Spirits with true *qi*, roaming the Eight Simplicities, and inscribing their names upon the Mysterious Chart.

The Supreme Supreme Dao Lord chants:
*Ascend the Purple Gate, gaze upon the Eight Mornings,*
*Array the Cinnabar Palaces, assemble the luminous spirits,*
*Roam the Nine Qi, dance with the celestial immortals,*
*Bind the azure of heaven, chant the Great Calendar,*
*Gird the vast expanse, recite the Numinous Strategies,*
*Summon the storm dragons, tread the twin whites,*
*Lead the purple youths, circle the two reds,*
*Conceal the Great Simplicity, hide within the radiant walls.*

These words describe the Way of the Three Purple Essence Emperor Lords in perpetually refining the Five Spirits. The *Great Calendar* refers to the *Mysterious Record of the Seven Sages*, and the *Numinous Strategies* to the *Scripture of the Jade Emperor*.

The statutes decree: To transmit to an unworthy recipient or to disregard the proper methods is to divulge the celestial patterns. To leak or betray the oath is to become a lowly ghost after death, and one’s seven generations of ancestors shall suffer the punishments of wind and fire. Unless of the same spiritual essence, one should rather seal one’s lips.

On the Western Mystery Mountain’s Terrace of Flowing Light, these two scriptures are inscribed upon jade tablets in golden characters. In the Pure Void Heaven of Wangwu, they exist but are incomplete. Only in the Supreme Terrace of the Great Mystery Palace and the northern chamber of the Penglai Prefecture’s Golden Pillar and Jade Wall are the inscribed texts fully preserved. The immortals of the Central Palace and the various offices of the Great Clarity know not what these scriptures contain.

Within the northern cavern of Mount Emei’s stone chamber, upon the door pivot, are carved these twenty characters:
*The Rushing Sun draws the sun’s essence,*
*The Flowing Moon summons the moon’s spirit.*
*Attaining the Dao, one dwells in the Upper Palace,*
*And is enthroned as an Emperor Lord Perfected.*
Lesser immortals who see this inscription do not comprehend its meaning. To practice and obtain this scripture, one need not be wise or foolish—only that such texts do not exist in the mundane world.

The divine methods of the Perfected Officials are transmitted only after the oath is sworn. Those who possess the Dao and practice it shall become Highest Perfected, riding the eightfold radiant jade wheels, roaming the Nine Mornings, journeying to the Palace of Great Simplicity, beholding the Supreme Unity Emperor Lord, and together attending the Primordial Dawn.

Thus, the secret words declare: *Only by obtaining the Rushing Sun and Flowing Moon does one become a Perfected of the Supreme Clarity. Without cultivating the Supreme Dao, one shall not behold the Three Primordial Lords.*

**The Five Emperors of the Sun’s Center, Their Taboo Names, Courtesy Names, and Attire:**

Within the sun dwells the Green Emperor, whose taboo name is *Yuán Cháng Wú*, whose courtesy name is *Zhào Lóng Tāo*, and who wears a robe of azure-jade brocade, a skirt of verdant blossoms and flying feathers, and a crown of kingfisher-blue hibiscus and morning glory.

Within the sun dwells the Red Emperor, whose taboo name is *Dān Líng Zhì*, whose courtesy name is *Lǜ Hóng Yìng*, and who wears a robe of crimson-jade brocade, a skirt of cinnabar blossoms and flying feathers, and a crown of vermilion and luminous splendor.

Within the sun dwells the White Emperor, whose taboo name is *Hào Yù Jiāng*, whose courtesy name is *Huí Jīn Xiá*, and who wears a robe of white-jade brocade, a skirt of white feathers and flying blossoms, and a crown of luminous white and canopy-like splendor.

Within the sun dwells the Black Emperor, whose taboo name is *Chéng Zēng Tíng*, whose courtesy name is *Xuán Lù Yán*, and who wears a robe of black-jade brocade, a skirt of black feathers and flying blossoms, and a crown of dark mountain hibiscus.

Within the sun dwells the Yellow Emperor, whose taboo name is *Shòu Yì Fú*, whose courtesy name is *Biāo Huī Xiàng*, and who wears a robe of yellow-jade brocade, a skirt of yellow feathers and flying blossoms, and a crown of purple hibiscus and luminous splendor.

To the right: the taboo names, courtesy names, and attire of the Five Emperor Lords of the Sun.

Should one wish to practice the Way of Rushing to the Sun, one must invoke and recognize their names, visualize the emperors’ attire, and hold them in mind to the left and right, before and behind.

The spirit-soul of the Lady within the moon is named *Ài Xiāo Tái Biāo*. To the right: the moon’s soul is paired with the Five Emperors, and one must also invoke it. He who knows the name of the moon’s soul shall be free from calamity all his life, and no harm shall befall him.

The Most High conceals the taboo names and courtesy names of the Sun and Moon Emperor Lords and their Ladies within the Palace of Great Simplicity. He who knows them shall become a divine immortal.

The Most High binds the radiance of the Five Emperor Ladies of the Moon—here follow their taboo names, courtesy names, and attire:

Within the moon dwells the Lady of the Bluegreen Emperor, whose taboo name is *É Yǐn Zhū*, whose courtesy name is *Fēn Yàn Yīng*, and who wears a robe of azure-jade brocade, a skirt of flying feathers adorned with green dragon and phoenix patterns.

Within the moon dwells the Lady of the Red Emperor, whose taboo name is *Yì Yì Liáo*, whose courtesy name is *Wǎn Yán Xū*, and who wears a robe of cinnabar-stamen jade brocade, a skirt of crimson blossoms and phoenix-net flying feathers.

Within the moon dwells the Lady of the White Emperor, whose taboo name is *Líng Sù Lán*, whose courtesy name is *Yù Lián Huá*, and who wears a robe of white jade brocade with four-emerging dragons, a skirt of white feathers and simurgh-patterned flying blossoms.

Within the moon dwells the Lady of the Black Emperor, whose taboo name is *Jié Lián Qiáo*, whose courtesy name is *Chún Shǔ Jīn*, and who wears a robe of dark jade brocade with nine-layered cloud patterns, a skirt of black feathers and dragon-patterned flying blossoms.

Within the moon dwells the Lady of the Yellow Emperor, whose taboo name is *Qīng Róng Jīn*, whose courtesy name is *Jiǒng Dìng Róng*, and who wears a robe of yellow cloud-and-mountain-patterned brocade, a skirt of yellow feathers and dragon-patterned flying blossoms.

To the right: the Five Ladies all wear their hair in three-cornered cloud buns, with the rest falling loose to their waists.

To the right: the taboo names, courtesy names, and attire of the Five Emperor Ladies of the Moon.

Should one wish to practice the Way of Rushing to the Moon, one must invoke and recognize their names, visualize the Ladies’ attire, and hold them in mind to the left and right, before and behind.

The spirit-soul of the Five Emperors within the sun is named *Zhū Jǐng Chì Tóng*. To the right: the sun’s soul is paired with the Five Ladies of the Moon, and one must also visualize and invoke it. He who knows the name of the sun’s soul shall be free from illness all his life, and no misfortune shall befall him.

The Most High conceals the names of the sun and moon souls within the Purple Void Jade Palace. He who knows them shall commune with spirits and command the numinous.

For those who practice the Way of Rushing to the Sun and Moon, one may proceed as one finds convenient and need not perform all the rites. Should one desire a secluded chamber, one must only ensure that the first radiance of the sun or moon is visible. If one does not sever worldly affairs and remains entangled with external matters, one cannot practice this Way.

At midnight, one must burn incense, visualize the names of the Five Emperors and the Five Emperor Ladies, and silently pray: *"May I unite with the Emperor Lords and the Five Spirits of the Great One, merging our radiance as one."*

Thus, after twenty-four years, one shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, and there is no need to practice the Way of Rushing and Visualization. One must constantly hold them in mind to the left and right, silently invoking and reciting without letting the ears hear.

To practice the Way of *Yù Yí* and rush to the sun: at dawn, gaze upon the moment the sun first emerges. If there is no sun, remain in a secluded chamber, first close the eyes, hold the breath for ten cycles, then swallow the sun’s radiant light ten times. One must visualize the sun’s light and mist entering the mouth and swallow it. When finished, softly call the courtesy names of the Five Emperor Lords of the Sun and the name of the moon’s soul three times in all. Then silently pray: *"May I, together with the True Lords of the Five Emperors and the spirit-soul of the moon, ascend upon radiant clouds to the Sun Palace."*

Next, close the eyes and visualize the Bluegreen Emperor Lord descending from the sun’s light to one’s left; then visualize the Red Emperor Lord descending from the sun’s light to one’s right; then visualize the White Emperor Lord descending from the sun’s light to one’s back; then visualize the Black Emperor Lord descending from the sun’s light to one’s left hand; then visualize the Yellow Emperor Lord descending from the sun’s light to one’s right hand. When all Five Emperors have arrived, visualize their attire, making it as vivid as possible. Then knock the teeth five times, swallow the saliva nine times, and softly pray:

*"Crimson furnace, cinnabar radiance,
Round blossom, ninefold brightness,
Great light dawns, morning’s splendor,
Resplendent with vermilion essence.
Five Emperors rise in mist,
Illuminating the myriad beings of the cavernous void.
Behold the Perfected of the Upper Realms,
Empty and boundless, harmonious and level.
Circulating qi refines the hues,
Flowing through the five forms.
May my spirit transform,
My six palaces flourish and fill,
Uniting with the Emperor Lords,
The Great One and the Peerless Flower.
Riding crimson clouds,
Ascending the nine chariots of the Yang Path,
Rushing to the Sun Palace,
Merging with the Emperors in spirit.
May my life span equal heaven and earth,
The two dawns inclining toward one another."*

When finished, knock the teeth three times, swallow the saliva three times, and softly pray:

*"Spirit-soul of the moon,
Ài Xiāo Tái Biāo,
May I reach
The Heaven of the Sun’s Cavern,
The eastern Mount Meng of the long hills,
Receive the writ of the Waving Spirit,
Bear the talisman of the Nine Realms,
Feast on the azure essence of the sun’s grain,
Drink the rich jade of cloudy azure,
Dwell in the city of the eight poles,
Ascend the Terrace of Bright Perfection,
Sit in the Hall of Rare Forest,
Chant the verses of the Jade Dawn."*

When finished, visualize the crimson chariot of the Yang Path, drawn by nine red dragons, arriving from the sun’s light before you. Then visualize ascending with the Five Emperors to rush to the sun. Forget the body for a long while, then swallow the saliva fourteen times, open the eyes, and concentrate the mind, visualizing as vividly as possible. He who practices this Way for a long time shall surely ride the radiance to the sun. Thus ends the Way of *Yù Yí*.

To practice the Way of *Jié Lín* and rush to the moon: at dusk, gaze upon the moment the moon first emerges. If there is no moon, remain in a secluded chamber, first close the eyes, hold the breath for nine cycles, then swallow the moon’s light nine times. One must visualize the moon’s light entering the mouth and swallow it. When finished, softly invoke the taboo names and courtesy names of the Five Emperor Ladies and the name of the sun’s soul three times in all. Then visualize the Lady of the Bluegreen Emperor descending from the moon’s light to one’s left and right, following the same method as visualizing the Five Emperors of the Sun.

Having completed this, visualize the colors with utmost vividness. Then strike the teeth nine times, swallow saliva nine times, and softly invoke:

*"Yellow essence unfurls its radiance,
Primal yin inwardly manifests.
Reflecting upon the Great Mystery,
It opens the caverns of ten thousand directions.
Scattering the luxuriant chill of the whirlwind,
Seven dawns suspend their jade-like brilliance.
The threefold convergence of yin returns,
Heaven and Earth exhale their light.
Purple radiance spirals and coalesces,
Floating blossoms fill the nine voids.
Round luminosity bestows its hues,
The six qi transform and interflow.
The Five Emperor Ladies,
Treading clouds and grasping winds,
Wear spirit veils of dense silk,
Adorned with jade pendants and earrings.
Feathered skirts brush the heavens,
Wafting through the void to fan the east.
The soaring tree unfolds the dawn,
Its canopy branches lush as the sacred feng.
Cloud toads refine and polish,
Nurturing the Wood King.
The cavernous root spans ten thousand miles,
Its shade enfolding my body.
Soul harmonized, spirit transformed,
The six mysteries fill the void.
Returning from old age to infancy,
Jade-like luster restores youth.
The Imperial Lord merges and transforms,
Joining the radiant peach of health.
Timely riding the flowing bell,
Ten dragons of flying clouds,
Ascend to the bright moon.
Attaining the rank of Immortal Sovereign,
Lifespan unites with the two symbols,
Heaven and Earth without end."*

Finished, strike the teeth nine times again, swallow saliva seven times, and softly invoke:

*"Spirit of the sun’s soul,
Pearl-like radiance of the Crimson Youth,
Enable me to reach the west,
To the Gate of the Six Peaks.
Entering the Jade Palace of Harmonious Dawn,
The Eight Vastnesses and the White Mound,
The Upper Chamber of Eightfold Radiance,
Obtain the talisman of Thousandfold Clarity,
Wear the insignia of the Flowing Star and Night’s Brilliance.
Sit in the Hall of Supreme Harmony,
Ascend the Terrace of the Seven Numinous Ones.
Drink the moon’s essence and cloud’s cream,
Feast on the yellow jade and purple nectar.
Chant the verses of the Loftiest,
Recite the true hymns of the Jade Dawn."*

Finished, visualize the carriage of the flowing bell and flying clouds, drawn by ten yellow dragons, arriving from the moon’s light before you. Then visualize riding together with the Five Emperor Ladies to rush toward the moon.

Forgetting the form for a long while, swallow saliva thirty times, then close the eyes and concentrate the mind, visualizing as vividly as possible. He who practices this Way for a long time shall surely ride the radiance to the moon. Thus ends the Way of *Jié Lín*.

If one has already attained the Dao and further refines essence through visualization, practicing for two years will yield faint manifestations; in three years, the form will appear; in five years, one may ride the radiance to the sun and moon. For those who are not yet immortals but begin to refine their essence with precision, progress will not be swift. Through prolonged cultivation, ascending to the Twofold Radiance, one may become a Perfected of the Highest Clarity.

**Preface to the Scripture of the Divine Elixir of the Eightfold Radiance, Fourfold Blossom Purple Essence, and Fivefold Pearl Cinnabar**
*Also titled: Scripture of the Threefold Flower Flying Net Elixir*
*Composed and annotated by Zhang Daoling*

The Perfected of the Highest Lord,
So vast their gaze encompasses the heavens,
Traversing the boundless purple void,
Feasting upon the seven awakenings,
Roaming the ten thousand directions—
All this is made possible by the flying essence of the four fluids
And the cinnabar sovereign of the five pearls.
Thus they ride the threefold flower with eightfold vision,
Command the flying刚 to preserve their authenticity,
Dissolve the spirit and shift the radiance,
Wandering freely in the Highest Clarity.

When the sprout of langgan jade is beheld,
The cinnabar of crimson birth arises therein.
Having attained the lofty insignia of the Nine Perfected,
The gates of the nine yin unfold.
Longevity resides in the mysterious vision,
Attainment of the Dao lies in the subtle and profound.
What befits the subtle and profound?
A tranquil essence and wondrous serenity,
Infusing the spirit with true qi,
Settling the heart in the obscure mechanism.
Clarifying the five spirits in the purple chamber,
Mirroring the primordial harmony in the Great Tenuity.
Moon’s essence conjoins with *Jié Lín*,
Sun’s radiance penetrates *Yù Yí*,
Spiritual transformations gleam in the nine dawns.
Drawing the congealed fluid to soar in emptiness,
The Jade Scripture chants in luminous radiance,
Dragon flowers bloom in the rarefied,
Fleeting as they rush through the dark Han.
Heaven and Earth suddenly shift,
Standing transformations divide the round path.
Lightning scatters swiftly as thunder quakes,
Dwelling in the vast abyss yet not drowning,
Treading upon blades yet unharmed.
When obstruction is desired,
Ten thousand paths are bolted shut;
When passage is desired,
Stagnations dissolve and open.
Boundless and formless,
Adapting to every intent—
Great indeed is the numinous transformation of the elixir,
Its splendor equal to the Imperial Unity and the nine yin.
Consuming a single dose,
One outshines the Three Radiant Ones without decline.

These twenty-four ingredients combine the *qi* of the twenty-four spirits and harmonize the congealed essences of the nine dawns and nine yins, coalescing the luminous radiance of the sun and moon. Each is to be pounded separately, beginning with cinnabar, each for four thousand strokes. The ingredients must be of the highest purity and brilliance. The one who pounds the medicine should be temperate and discreet, avoiding idle chatter. They must first observe a thirty-day fast, and only after its completion proceed to pound the ingredients in a secluded chamber, wearing clean garments and bathing daily with fragrant waters.

Only three or four individuals may assist in compounding the medicine, all of like mind and purpose, dwelling in seclusion. The prohibitions and observances are identical to those of the fasting rituals. Once each ingredient has been pounded separately, place them into the cauldron in the following order: first cinnabar, then realgar, followed by orpiment, then malachite, next frankincense, and finally *Taiyi* remnant nourishment, which rests atop all the others. After all twenty-four ingredients are arranged in sequence within the cauldron, press them down lightly with a small willow spatula to ensure even distribution.

Next, slowly pour five *jin* of mercury over the ingredients until all are submerged. Then carefully place the upper earthen cauldron atop the lower one, sealing the seam with yellow cinnabar clay. Coat the outer edge with oyster-shell clay to a thickness of one *cun*, and allow it to dry in the shade for ten days. Once dry and cracked, apply another layer of clay. Afterward, coat the entire exterior—top, bottom, and sides—with oyster-shell clay to a uniform thickness of six *fen*.

First prepare the Six-One Clay to seal the inner and outer surfaces of the cauldron. The method for making this clay is as follows: use left-facing oysters from the Eastern Sea, halite, yellow cinnabar, talc, red halloysite, and earthworm-yellow soil—six ingredients in equal parts. Grind them finely and sift through fine silk. Mix with hundred-day-aged bitter wine until extremely sour. After blending, pound the mixture thirty thousand times to complete the Six-One Clay.

Apply this clay to the inner and outer surfaces of the two cauldrons in thin layers, allowing each to dry in the sun before adding the next. Once all layers are applied, ensure the clay is two and a half *cun* thick both inside and outside the cauldron.

Prepare sufficient Six-One Clay for the task. All clay mixtures should be blended with bitter wine. If halite is unavailable, salt from Hedong may be substituted. Additionally, mix two *dou* of fine Eastern Sea salt into one *hu* of bitter wine, strain to remove dregs, and use this solution to blend the Six-One Clay, following this proportion.

**Method for Constructing the Kiln:**
Choose a secluded location and build a kiln house forty *chi* in length, oriented south. Install a door at the eastern end, and a gauze window on the southern side. Construct the kiln at the center of the house, ensuring it is square with openings on all four sides. Place a large iron frame with four legs at the kiln’s center, positioned so that the upper and lower sections are appropriately spaced, with height adjustments made as needed for stability. Securely place the cauldron containing the medicine atop this frame.

Burn fine chaff beneath the cauldron, maintaining a distance of approximately one *chi* from the bottom. Regulate the fire carefully to avoid excessive intensity. After eighteen days, reduce the fire’s distance to five *cun* below the cauldron and continue for nine more days. Once complete, further reduce the distance to three *cun* and burn for seven days. Then bring the fire to within one *cun* of the cauldron for five days. Next, position the fire directly beneath the cauldron’s base for twenty-seven days. Afterward, raise the fire to the lower half of the cauldron’s belly for thirty days. Finally, adjust the fire to two *cun* below the upper cauldron for twenty-four days.

Once the full duration is complete, the medicine will be ready. Allow it to cool for seven days before slowly opening the cauldron. The Eight Radiant Four-Petal Flower will be suspended within the upper cauldron. Use the feathers of a three-year-old white rooster to sweep it into a sealed vessel of gold or silver. The flower will manifest in the colors of luminous clouds, its fifty-eight varieties of *qi* flowing like rosy dawn, its purple light resplendent and ineffable—this is called the Eight Radiant Four-Petal Five-Pearl Crimson-Born Spirit Elixir.

On the first day of the second or eighth lunar month at dawn, face the direction of the Year-Star, bow twice, and ingest one *liang* with east-flowing water. Immediately, nine dawn lights will sprout from your head, your face will bear jade-like radiance, and your flight will mirror the brilliance of precious constellations. You will perceive the world with clarity; holding your breath will summon the cloud-chariot of the Three Primes, and spitting upon the ground will transform it into the light of the sun and moon. A whistle to the left will cause immortals to bow in reverence, while a whistle to the right will unite the Eight Radiant Ones in harmony. Thus, you will ascend through the void to the Purple Emptiness, entering and departing the Jade Clarity, resting and feasting in the Morn Chambers.

If the medicinal flower has not fully formed, reseal the cauldron’s seams with clay as before, ensuring tightness, and burn the cauldron’s belly for sixty days—success will be assured. Cool for seven days before opening as initially described.

Take one *hu* of refined hemp fat and combine it with three *liang* of the Four-Petal Purple Flower. Place them in a bronze vessel and heat gently over a low fire for three days to complete the medicine, called the Four-Petal Purple Nectar. Consume one *ge* daily, and your lifespan will equal that of heaven and earth. You will divide your form into ten thousand bodies, moving through emptiness at will, your desires fulfilled effortlessly.

Rub the Four-Petal Purple Nectar into your palms and fingernails, then peer closely into a mirror—you will see objects thousands of miles away, whatever you wish to observe. As your heart directs your gaze, so shall you perceive, even glimpsing future events, the subtle workings of life and death, prosperity and decline. This elixir is also called the Eight Radiance Elixir, or the Four-Petal Purple Flower, or the Supreme Purple Jade Nectar of the Great Subtlety, or the Five-Pearl Flower Elixir, or the Crimson Dawn Flower, or the Three-Flower Supreme, or the Supreme Flying Net, or the Nine Mornings Supreme Elixir—altogether eight names.

The method for refining hemp fat: Take five *hu* of clear water and one *hu* of hemp fat, along with two *jin* each of *kongting wusha* and scallion-white. Combine these four ingredients and simmer until one *hu* remains. To prepare the Purple-Petal Nectar, kindle the fire in a secluded place, covering the bronze vessel with a wooden lid to prevent the fat’s smoke from escaping. The refined fat may also be consumed alone to prolong life.

For the Eight Radiance Divine Elixir, once the prescribed days of firing are complete, do not open it; instead, continue firing as on the first day, following the same method for adding fire. When all is done, cool it for seven days before opening. The elixir’s smoke will transform into five Luminous Moon Pearls, which adhere to the upper lid, each enveloped in a crimson veil. Consume the crimson veil with clear water, and crimson clouds will appear above you, bearing you aloft to the Supreme Clarity. Wearing these five pearls, you will shine across the world, your radiance equal to the sun and moon. This elixir is called the Five-Pearl Crimson Dawn, used to ascend to the Supreme Clarity.

Apply twice the fire, and once the five pearls have formed, do not open it; instead, continue firing for the same number of days as before. After firing, cool it for twenty-one days before opening. The five Luminous Moon Pearls will then transform into the Three-Flower Flying Net Dragons. Upon opening the cauldron, they will suddenly grow vast, their patterns and hues resplendent, exhaling mist to summon clouds—these are the Hidden Dragons. Mount them to travel, ascending to the Nine Mornings Palace. Thus, the *Highest Scripture* states: "Ride the Hidden Dragon, and your existence shall be boundless as heaven."

Regarding the doubling of firing days: count the first firing as one day, the next as two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, following this progression for each subsequent firing.

The method for preparing tiger-stem flower: Take one *jin* of *mayuxiongqiong*, grind it finely into powder, and mix it with six *liang* of tiger-stem flower to form cakes. Dry them in the shade, then grind and weigh out six *liang*, discarding the remainder into east-flowing water. Tiger-stem flower dried within three years may also be used; it need not be freshly dried to be effective. During drying, store it in a silk pouch to keep dust from adhering.

For *xunluxiang* resembling lacquer, first remove its impurities by washing with hot water until it becomes lustrous and free of sediment—only then is it usable.

Take ten *jin* of tin and melt it in an iron pot for half a day. Add one *zhu* of the Four-Petal Purple Flower, stir briefly, and it will instantly become Wilted-Purple Gold, malleable for use—this applies only to its initial formation. Add two *zhu* to form Purple-Petal Jade, three *zhu* to form Dark Pear Jade.

Take the dregs of the Eight Radiance Elixir, pound them thirty thousand times, and consume one pill the size of a small bean daily. Your body will emit jade-like radiance, your lifespan will match the Nine Mornings, and your fragrance will carry thirty *li*. Burning one pill the size of a small bean will repel all plagues, evil *qi*, malevolent spirits, and inauspicious omens, its fragrance lingering for ten days. Take one pill the size of a millet grain, hold it in your mouth, and spit—your transformations will follow your will, allowing you to conceal your form, traverse the world unseen, and cease at will by swallowing the pill. For one who has died less than three days prior, administer a pill the size of a large bean, and they will revive at once. Open their mouth, break their teeth, and administer it with water. Rubbing one pill over their heart will restore their *hun* and *po*, warming and softening their limbs.

Take ten *jin* of lead and tin, melt them in an iron vessel, and add two pills the size of a chicken’s yolk. Stir briefly, and it will instantly become yellow gold. Add three pills to form refined purple gold. Carrying one pill with you will summon the spirits of mountains and seas to pay homage. Rubbing one pill on your door will protect your household from illness and repel all ghosts and malevolent spirits. Consuming one pill daily for a hundred days will restore your complexion to that of a maiden; after three years, your face will revert to the innocence of a child. Dropping one pill the size of a small bean into water will cause dragons and fish to surface, boiling the water. Dropping one pill the size of a large bean into fire will extinguish its light for a full day.

The *Supreme Clarity High Sage Central Yellow Elder Lord’s Cavern-True Gold Mystery Nine Yin Nine Perfected Jade Scripture*, the *Supreme Lord’s Solar Orb and Lunar Radiance Chapters*, and the *Eight Radiance Divine Elixir Text* are all inscribed upon the Eastern Flower Immortal Terrace, not disclosed to the world. Only those with predestined immortal names may hear or see them. At the time of transmission, one must fast, meditate upon the spirits, and carefully assess the recipient before making a covenant, swearing an oath of secrecy.

For receiving the *Nine Yin Formula of the Lord of the Dao*, the oath is sealed with a knot of green silk. For receiving the *Supreme Lord’s Solar Orb Text*, the oath is sealed with twenty-four *chi* of crimson silk—this is the oath of solar radiance. For receiving the *Supreme Lord’s Lunar Radiance Chapter*, the oath is sealed with twenty-four *chi* of azure silk—this is the oath of lunar splendor. For receiving the *Eight Radiance Elixir Scripture*, the oath is sealed with three pairs of gold rings—this is the oath of the Eternal Youth’s cyclical transformation. Together, these four oaths invoke the Nine Mornings as witness, pointing to the sun and moon as pledge, ensuring absolute secrecy, one’s heart aligned with heaven and earth.

Should one fail to honor the oath with reverence, the body shall become a lowly ghost, and for seven generations, both oneself and one’s parents shall endure the trials of water and fire, bearing the weight of Mount Meng’s stones to cast into the River of Accumulated Nights.

When receiving the ritual objects of the oath from the master, these are to be dispersed among the cold and destitute, to relieve the urgent distress of the poor and sick, to succor the starving of mountains and rivers, and to provide for the public use of the divine spirits. Should one selfishly withhold them for personal gain or covetously exploit them for profit, then the seven generations of the master’s ancestors shall suffer prolonged torment in hell, and the master’s own body shall enter the winds and fires, enduring excruciating pain.

Moreover, disciple and master must harmonize their hearts in mutual affection, for this is the root of kinship. When virtue and power are profound, even in death there shall be no separation; when the root is firmly bound, the hun and po souls shall find tranquility. If one reveres the beginning but neglects the end, failing to uphold virtue with constancy, how can one’s years and fate be long, or how can one attain the covenant of divine transcendence?

Only those who grasp this principle may be spoken to of the beginning and end of the quest for the Dao.

**The Supreme One’s Elixir of Radiant Petals and Cloud Dust (Divine Immortals’ Upper Realm Formula)**

The flourishing fruit is the luminous pearl of spring’s awakening.
Black sesame is the sunken numen of autumn’s advent.
Red jujubes are the cloud fungi of blazing yang.
Poria is the crimson dawn’s hidden embryo.

When the five blossoms merge with mist and the three qi refine the essence, they harmonize the six qi, nourish the hun soul, and guard the spirit. Those who master this formula shall ascend as celestial immortals, their aged white returning to mystery, their form reverting to the purity of an infant, their countenance that of a youth. A thousand harms shall not touch them, and their years shall stretch long.

**Ingredients:**
- One *hu* of flourishing fruit from the three springs. It is called "flourishing" because it flourishes with the essence of yang, and thus stands first among the medicines. Should the three springs pass without compounding the elixir, store the flourishing fruit in a sealed vessel, plastering it with mud, and open it only when needed. By the following spring, do not use the previous year’s stock if it has been infested by worms. This substance is difficult to preserve; it must be kept in a clean, dry vessel. Should the flourishing fruit transform into liquid, strain out the dregs and use the flourishing water to blend the medicine.
- Three *dou* of black sesame powder, first roasted, then pounded into fine grains.
- Ten *jin* of poria, weighed precisely, finely pounded and sifted into powder.
- Five *sheng* of white honey.
- One *hu* of dried jujubes, the largest ones peeled and pitted, the pulp steamed and mashed until smooth.
- Five *dou* of fine clear wine.

Combine these six ingredients, stirring until fully blended, then place in a cauldron and simmer over a gentle fire until it thickens to the consistency of malt sugar, nearly forming into pills. Remove and place in a sealed vessel, then pound an additional three thousand times until the mixture resembles the yolk of a chicken’s egg. Shape into pills the size of a chicken’s yolk and take three daily.

When grinding the ingredients into powder, ensure they are exceedingly fine, sifted through fine silk, then simmered in the cauldron with frequent stirring. Cover the cauldron with a lid. The compounding of the medicine should be done in a secluded place, away from the sight and hearing of many.

Those who take this medicine shall, after one year, find their eyes bright and ears keen, their will strengthened and spirit attuned. After two years, the effects shall deepen; after three, scars and blemishes shall vanish. After four years, the body shall glow with vitality and qi shall flourish. After five, one’s steps shall be as swift as flight. After six, white hair shall return to black, the face shall bear the hue of youth, and the body shall radiate jade-like light. Disasters shall not harm them, and they shall ascend upon clouds, attaining the rank of Perfected One.

This medicine replenishes the embryo, augments qi, fills the essence, and sharpens clarity. The upper pill method has enabled countless Daoists to ascend and transcend; it is not to be compared with ordinary formulas and should be compounded and consumed without delay.

**The Supreme One’s Mysterious Water and Cloud-Floral Nectar Method**

Take three *hu* of flourishing fruit, seal it in a vessel in a dark place, and after a hundred days, it shall naturally transform into water. Blend with one *dou* of white honey and simmer over a gentle fire until it boils thrice, then cease. This is also called *Cloud-Flourishing Vermilion Nectar*; taking five *ge* daily shall make the body fragrant and the face bear the bloom of youth. This is a secret formula of the divine immortals.

If the flourishing water is insufficient, add four *dou* of refined lard and one *hu* of clear water, then simmer together with the flourishing water until reduced to four *dou*, maintaining a gentle fire. This is the supreme method of secret formulas.

These five ingredients take ophiopogon as their chief, with the other four following it. First add the chief ingredient, pound it a hundred times, then add the others in sequence, grinding all into powder.

The Four Spirit-Pacifying Pills combine twenty ingredients, with those that refine the essence forming one group of five, all to be ground into powder. First add the *yuyuliang* group and pound it three thousand times; next add the cinnabar group and pound it four thousand times; then add the poria group and pound it five thousand times; finally add the ophiopogon group and pound it six thousand times. Then add four *sheng* of white honey and pound it seven thousand times; next add twelve taels of white beeswax and pound it eight thousand times. Add more honey to bind the mixture into pills—if the mixture is too firm, add honey; if it is soft, no addition is needed. Do not add too much honey; adjust the quantity as required. Pound it a further thirty thousand times until the medicine is ready, forming pills the size of a chicken’s egg yolk. Alternatively, shape them into smaller pills according to the size of the yolk.

Prepare the medicine on an auspicious day in the first, ninth, or eleventh month, and begin taking it on a full moon day. Within the first hundred days, consume five pills as appropriate. Fast the day before taking the medicine, then consume it at dawn the following day, resuming normal eating afterward. After a thousand days, take seven pills over two hundred days. After two thousand days, take twenty pills over three hundred days. After three thousand days, take thirty pills over four hundred days. This regimen stabilizes the spirit and guards the center, aligning one with heaven and earth. The medicine remains potent for ten thousand years. Taking one pill regularly precludes the need for any other medicinal supplements.

Before compounding the medicine, observe purification rites for seven days, abstaining from sexual activity. Ensure that chickens, dogs, children, and women do not witness the process. When preparing the medicine, first burn incense and set out a clean mat facing east, with the western side designated as the seat of the Great Emperor Lord, the Grand One, the Supreme Lord, and the Supreme Primordial Lord. Focus the mind and invoke them in prayer. When taking the medicine, likewise concentrate the mind and face the moon’s ruler.

These are the Four Supreme Formulas, which pacify the four spirits and cure all illnesses. They prevent aging, enable vision of things a thousand miles away, restore blackness to white hair, regrow lost teeth, and render the complexion radiant while imparting luster to the skin. After one year of consumption, all chronic ailments disappear; after two years, one’s breath becomes refined; after three years, the flesh is renewed; after four years, the vessels are renewed; after five years, the marrow is renewed; after six years, the sinews are renewed; after seven years, the bones are renewed; after eight years, the teeth are renewed; after nine years, the form is renewed, and both form and marrow are completely transformed. After ten years, one can command spirits and ghosts, overawe tigers and wolves, traverse rivers and mountains without boats or bridges, and walk through mountains unafraid of any harm. One may divide the body between existence and non-existence, achieving longevity and agelessness.

After taking the medicine, avoid corpses, foul blood, the five pungent vegetables, and all meat. Initially, consume wheat noodles, jujubes, and chestnuts; over time, one will naturally cease to eat them. If wheat is unavailable, barley is also suitable; if neither is available, rice may be used, though it slows the circulation of the medicine’s qi. This is of little consequence. Those who have already attained the Dao continue to take this medicine. Those who consume the Four Spirit-Pacifying Pills while eating grains will thereafter be free from all illnesses. This is the essential Dao.

Take one *jin* of acorus, selecting that which grows on rocks and has eight or nine nodes per *cun*. Peel away the outer skin, weigh out one *jin*, and soak it in one *dou* of white honey for a day and night. Remove and dry the acorus in the sun, then soak it again in honey, repeating the process until all the honey is used. Chop the acorus, grind it into powder, and use it to warm and harmonize the five viscera, supplement the deficiencies of the ears and eyes, seal the pores, and enhance one’s complexion. If the body harbors lingering guest heat or impediment at the eight wind passes, use water-grown acorus. Water-grown acorus, also called *changyang* divine grass, has sparse nodes and large roots.

Place these nine powders in sequence into the mortar and grind them together once, then pound them three thousand times. When the medicine is complete, store it in a sealed vessel to prevent the qi from escaping.

Measure out doses for one month, yielding nine servings. Take the medicine either at dawn, after meals, or at midnight, as is convenient. If making pills, use white honey and pound them an additional thousand times.

For powdered medicine, take one square-inch spoonful four times daily; for pills, take forty pills the size of firmiana seeds daily. If the body harbors prior pathogenic qi, the mind is absentminded, or there is deficiency taxation, take fifteen doses within one month.

Additionally, add seven taels of musk and four taels of deer velvet, combine with the nine powders, and pound them together three thousand times. Both men and women may take this medicine. The water used for ingestion need not be much—only enough to ensure the medicine reaches the throat. The medicine may also be taken daily, as it is non-toxic and has no prohibitions.

When compounding the medicine, fast for three days. Do not allow others to observe; only those directly involved should prepare it. First grind four taels of deer velvet into powder, then combine it with the nine powders and pound them together three thousand times. Alternatively, eight taels of *Taiyi Yuyu* powder may replace the musk and deer velvet, which is also excellent and may be used at will. If substituting only one ingredient, use four taels of *Yuyu* powder.
