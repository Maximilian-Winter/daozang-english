**Divine Oracle of the Hall of Life-Registration by Lord Lingji**

**First – Supreme Auspice**
Last night’s propitious dream bore bears and brown bears,
Auspicious blessings fill the door—fulfillment is near.
Confucius and the Buddha themselves deliver the child,
Surely a qilin from heaven, noble and bright.

**Second – Moderate**
Do not dismiss the birth of jade as unworthy of praise,
The dream of serpents was clear—fortune shall blaze.
One day, upon marriage, she shall rise in renown,
A blossom north of the Sandalwood Pavilion, fair and proud.

**Third – Moderate-Low**
Your family’s gourd vines stretch far and wide,
Descendants’ blessings flow from the heavens above.
Yet fear the trials of childbirth’s delay,
Pray for blessings to safeguard the way.

**Fourth – Inauspicious**
Flowers weary in gloom, rain, and wind,
Scarcely bloomed, they fade on mossy ground.
Why cling to the "son-granting herb" in vain?
All things are predestined—foreordained.

**Fifth – Great Auspice**
Generations of virtue, your legacy flows long,
Twin jade swallows herald fortune’s song.
Soon you’ll hear the newborn’s cry,
Hang the mulberry bow—aim for the sky.

**Sixth – Inauspicious**
Jade flawed, tile incomplete,
Waves rise where none should meet.
Without divine aid sought in time,
How like a lone boat through rapids’ climb?

**Seventh – Supreme Auspice**
A phoenix perches on the wutong tree,
Its branches sheltering the garden’s lea.
This child transcends the common kind,
A jewel beyond measure, rare and refined.

**Eighth – Moderate**
Half-believing, half in doubt, the matter lingers slow,
The mysteries of yin and yang remain unknown.
Now I declare it plain and true:
A lotus by the water blooms for you.

**Ninth – Supreme Auspice**
The sixth month’s cycle nears its end,
Morning and dusk, the vital qi shall ascend.
Childbirth shall pass without distress,
Prepare the jade fruit and rhino coins with haste.

**Tenth – Moderate-Low**
Lotus on stone can never bear,
Chrysanthemums in water bloom nowhere.
Though you invoke the gods’ might,
The serpent dream was clear that night.

**Eleventh – Moderate**
Spring enters the garden, rain and dew abound,
A branch of crabapple blooms, fresh and fair.
Do not say the "son-granting herb" is vain,
All things unfold as heaven’s will ordains.

**Twelfth – Great Auspice**
Out with the old, the new takes hold,
Warm spring winds bring joy untold.
A qilin clasps the golden lock,
To grace your halls—a treasure of the court.

**Thirteenth – Inauspicious**
Fate’s errors weigh too heavy to bear,
Why seek divination for son or heir?
By noon or dusk, the news shall come,
Like moonlight and breeze—light as some.

**Fourteenth – Moderate**
All things rest in the great balance’s sway,
Yet seek the gods’ wisdom to guide your way.
I declare it plain: after mid-autumn’s night,
Clouds part to reveal the moon’s pure light.

**Fifteenth – Supreme Auspice**
A jade swallow flies into your embrace,
No need for mortal doubt or chase.
Friends and kin prepare gifts of gold,
A scholar of unmatched grace unfolds.

**Sixteenth – Auspicious**
Verdant qi fills your hall with cheer,
A dream aligned with Venus’ sphere.
One day a noble son shall rise,
Though humble, your home gains another prize.

**Seventeenth – Inauspicious**
Destiny moves at its own pace,
Why weigh what’s real or mere trace?
Recall the sage’s ancient word:
"Seek fish in trees—none shall be heard."

**Eighteenth – Moderate**
Red peaches vie with flowers bright,
Yet no osmanthus blooms in sight.
Hope not for fortune yet untold,
Wait patiently for autumn’s gold.

**Nineteenth – Moderate**
Accumulate hidden virtue in silent grace,
Orchids and magic mushrooms fill your space.
Generation after generation shall thrive,
No need for wasps to rear another’s hive.

**Twentieth – Inauspicious**
Clouds veil the moon in murky night,
Flowers fall in cold wind—no fruit takes flight.
Magpies nest and cry as one,
Fortune’s path remains unclear, undone.

**Twenty-First – Moderate-Low**
The year’s luck falters, ill at ease,
Spare talk of dragons or phoenixes.
To know your fate’s near turn,
Pray for blessings to smooth the way.

**Twenty-Second – Moderate**
Ask of the womb—its cause is clear,
Serpents in dreams appear each year.
One day you’ll see her rise in state,
No common woman of humble fate.

**Twenty-Third – Moderate-High**
Orchids and osmanthus, rare their scent,
The Xie family’s garden shall be content.
Do not say their shade forms late,
Fate’s design moves at its own pace.

**Twenty-Fourth – Inauspicious**
Clinging to the tree, no trap is set,
Waiting for rabbits—none are met.
Laugh at those who gaze at autumn’s moon,
Losing the luminous pearl too soon.

**Twenty-Fifth – Moderate**
Fruit trees sprout in spring’s embrace,
Nurtured by rain, they grow apace.
Pluck the ripe fruit from the bough,
Lest the wind startle it now.

**Twenty-Sixth – Supreme Auspice**
A young phoenix basks in the sun’s glow,
Feathers adorned with patterns aglow.
This blessing comes not lightly,
For your family’s virtue runs deeply.

**Twenty-Seventh – Moderate**
Rejoicing days on end, they say,
A daughter’s birth may yet bring a son’s day.
If the child arrives as easily as *Da Yi*,
No need for fear—calm shall stay.

**Twenty-Eighth – Moderate-High**
A family of accumulated good,
Indeed, a bright pearl from the sea is pulled.
Yet guard against obstacles in fortune’s way,
Pray to the gods to smooth the fray.

**Twenty-Ninth – Moderate-Low**
Yesterday’s dream: red flowers adorned your frame,
Today you seek this oracle’s claim.
Clearly, your doubts I must allay,
For destiny’s hand guides your way.

**Thirtieth – Inauspicious**
Why fret from dawn to dusk so?
Let nature’s course unfold and flow.
Seeking pearls in the sea, none are found,
Only river fire and flint abound.

**Thirty-First – Supreme Auspice**
Hidden virtue aids in silent might,
Through rugged paths, the way turns bright.

**Thirty-Second – Moderate-Low**
Soon you’ll hire field laborers’ might,
Early hang mulberry bow and reed arrow bright.

**Thirty-Third – Supreme-Moderate**
A waning moon illumines the secluded bower,
Dreaming of bears, yet the vision turns sour.
Lament not if wishes stray from desire,
For hidden virtue shall silently inspire.

**Thirty-Fourth – Inauspicious**
Toiling in fields, you await autumn’s yield,
Knowing soon millet will fill the field.
Yet slack not in watchful care,
Lest twin-tailed oxen bring ruin there.

**Thirty-Fifth – Supreme-Moderate**
Gathering mountain fruit, you find uncut jade,
Diving for water, a luminous pearl is displayed.
Prepare early jade fruits and rhino coins bright,
For lush, verdant qi now fills the hall with light.

**Thirty-Sixth – Moderate-High**
When fortune wanes, even gold loses its sheen,
But when time turns, iron trees bloom green.
Now joy upon joy unfolds anew,
No longer vain sighs as in days of yore’s rue.

**Thirty-Seventh – Moderate-Low**
For thirty years, fate has not aligned,
Toil of heart and hand left naught behind.
Yet one idle day by the southern sea’s tide,
A gleaming pearl rests in your palm with pride.

**Thirty-Eighth – Moderate**
Toward others, words falter, unclear,
Sweetness lingers unswallowed, near.
Auspicious matters drift, uncertain still,
Through dawn’s light and dusk’s tranquil chill.

**Thirty-Ninth – Inauspicious**
Three worms feed on blood, their schemes untold,
Dark harm entwines, no peace to hold.
Though flowers may bloom and fruit take form,
When plucked, they’ll prove unfit to transform.

**Fortieth – Moderate**
The sun spreads wings toward the southern sky,
This matter is clear—no need to ask why.
Hang bells for swallows, a double sign bright,
Yet pray for protection against coming blight.

**Forty-First – Moderate**
Heirs’ fate drifts—doubt not in vain,
For creation’s design was long ordained.
To know the balance of firm and yielding’s art,
Last night, yin essence flew into your heart.

**Forty-Second – Moderate-High**
Intent on planting flowers, none take root,
Yet careless willows grow in lush pursuit.
Now the east wind’s power aids your hand,
Both willow and flower thrive as planned.

**Forty-Third – Supreme-Moderate**
Your noble house stands near to glory’s height,
Phoenix child and dragon steed shall soon alight.
To know if fate will swiftly or slowly unfold,
Wait but two days or three mornings’ toll.

**Forty-Fourth – Moderate**
The East Lord scatters warmth in measured grace,
Fragrant scenes stir joy in every place.
Yet pray to the gods for their safeguarding might,
Lest hares stir winds on once-level ground’s flight.

**Forty-Fifth – Moderate**
On reeds below and mushrooms above, drowsy rest,
In dreams, a serpent transforms to dragon’s crest.
This omen foretells a daughter of grace,
Honored with fish-carriage and noble embrace.

**Forty-Sixth – Supreme-Moderate**
Since ancient times, yin’s depth gives rise to yang’s glow,
Now your fortunes ascend in a steady flow.
Though the yellow turtle’s dream remains unfulfilled,
From the thin bamboo, a child’s cry is distilled.

**Forty-Seventh – Supreme-Moderate**
This omen arises where earth and marsh meet,
All things align to your heart’s sweet beat.
For years, you’ve envisioned the bear’s dream,
Today, sifting sand reveals gold’s gleam.

**Forty-Eighth – Supreme Auspice**
Good fortune stands clear before your eyes,
Prepare jade fruits and rhino coins in wise.
Who dares compare to a common crow?
The morning’s jade gleams, precious and bright, you know.

**Forty-Ninth – Moderate-Low**
News is faint, the time not yet near,
Yet here you come, doubts lingering clear.
This is no osmanthus from Eastern Grove’s height,
But moonlit bindweed—a single bloom in the night.

**Fiftieth – Low-High**
Good things ever face trials untold,
Seeking jade and pearls—vain tales unfold.
Last night in the garden, beneath the moon’s glow,
Clearly within it, Chang’e did show.

**Fifty-First – Inauspicious**
The sun climbs high, spring’s mist withdraws,
Blue mountains stretch, waters endlessly flow.
Fisherman, claim not the river holds no prize,
Where fish are absent, cast your line anew—wise.

**Fifty-Second – Auspicious**
A pear split open reveals a crimson snake,
Divine favor descends upon your home’s wake.
Soon the jade at the crown will grow long,
A legacy of glory, right and strong.

**Fifty-Third – Supreme-Moderate**
Spring’s fleeting light has not yet passed,
Yin and yang unite, their qi amassed.
In the hall, guests gather for the feast’s delight,
Vying to sing the praises of sons so bright.

**Fifty-Fourth – Inauspicious**
Sifting sand reveals no golden trace,
Schemes fall short, leaving hearts dismayed in place.
Go forth and seek hidden virtue’s aid,
Lest river fire and flint’s sting invade.

**Fifty-Fifth – Moderate-High**
Silken mats and tripods grace a mansion grand,
Yet nothing compares to a son’s steadfast hand.
Best of all, a piece of Kunshan’s jade,
Its coming reveals ancestral blessings laid.

**Fifty-Sixth – Low-Moderate**
Your heart wavers—joy and fear entwined,
A fine affair remains undefined.
Peaches and plums in the garden near ripening’s hour,
Yet fear the wind may steal their power.

**Fifty-Seventh – Inauspicious**
Gazing on the Yangtze’s distant flow,
Reeds whisper in autumn’s winds that blow.
Midnight’s waters chill, no fish will rise,
The fisherman’s golden hook meets empty skies.

**Fifty-Eighth – Moderate**
At dawn, magpies chatter by the front beam,
Announcing a jade tree’s birth—a joyous dream.
Yet rely on hidden virtue’s shield,
Lest thin blessings turn joy to startled yield.

**Fifty-Ninth – Supreme Auspice**
Good deeds ever summon a hundred blessings,
The hall resounds with laughter and jade caressings.
Tomorrow brings more to boast and proclaim,
A ring from the tree’s hollow reveals the Yang name.

**Sixtieth – Supreme-Moderate**
The matter rests in your heart, you know it well,
Ancestral virtue shadows where you dwell.
If doves nest in magpies’ home, a hawk may rise,
How could a tiger’s den lack a leopard’s prize?

**Sixty-First – Inauspicious**
The road ahead is rugged, uneven ground,
Misty rain obscures the path you’ve found.
Hasten your steps to avoid stumbles and falls,
Why linger with cautious, slow paces and crawls?

**Sixty-Second – Moderate-High**
Burning incense, knocking teeth, you pray to the skies,
Yet better to diligently sow virtue’s prize.
What need for supplication’s plea,
When merit’s field yields blessings naturally?

The present desires are largely fulfilled,
Indeed, a red lotus emerges from the fire.

**Sixty-Third – Most Inauspicious**
The curtains are rolled high to welcome spring’s return,
Yet alas, spring does not belong to you.
Planting lotus on stone, vainly hoping for roots,
Laboring heart, strength, and spirit—all in vain.

**Sixty-Fourth**
Beyond the courtyard, spring arrives, sweeping green moss away,
Best to plant peach and plum in their season.
If the Eastern Lord truly heeds mortal wishes,
In the end, he will grant them one more bloom.
