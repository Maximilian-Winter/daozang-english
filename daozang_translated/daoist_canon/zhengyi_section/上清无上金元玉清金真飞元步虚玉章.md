**First Hymn**
With bowed head, I pay homage to the Heavenly Venerable,
Burning incense to return to the ten directions.
Twin radiance revolves through the tenfold brightness,
Flying Sanskrit turns the Dharma-wheel’s net.
All heavens join in this celebration,
Together they rein in life and death.
Flowing gold illumines the Great Non-Being,
Vast and distant, the Perfect True King.
Thrice circling, I ascend the Jade Realm,
In serene flight, I roam the void.
In the profound depths of Great Loftiness,
Lush and rich, the Golden Primordial Hall.

**Second Hymn**
Golden numina in wondrous form,
Jade splendor naturally pervades.
Riding the luminous, I ascend in perfect clarity,
The ten directions all reflect the golden countenance.
Through boundless heavens, atop myriad peaks,
The ten thousand Dao are all as one.
Scattering blossoms of sun and moon essence,
The Primordial Beginning rejoices in the golden wind.
Turning through kalpas as numerous as Ganges’ sands,
Ever in bliss on Jade Clarity’s summit.
Pinching incense, I attend the Dao Sovereign,
Roaming freely in the Golden Mystery.

**Third Hymn**
Brocatelle clouds cradle the living mist,
Within lies the Jade Emperor’s court.
Adorned with the seven treasures’ majesty,
Its radiance shines upon Supreme Clarity.
Wondrous enlightenment communes with the Mysterious Perfection,
Wandering through the Flowing Gold City.
Summoned by the Divine Empyrean’s decree,
Lightly I chant the Cavern Scripture.

**Fourth Hymn**
Jade Clarity, realm of all wonders,
Towering and vast, it crowns the heavens’ edge.
The Supreme Primordial King,
Venerable of the ten directions’ midst.
Flying blossoms scatter into the Great Non-Being,
Jeweled canopies shade the golden wheel.
Above the eightfold Mysterious Clarity,
Lush and resplendent, the Golden Non-Being gleams.
Verdant and dazzling, the seven-jeweled grove,
Phoenixes sing as simurghs take flight.
To the left, the Heavenly Treasure Youth attends,
To the right, the Jade Perfected Lord.
The Cavern Illumination’s twin effulgences
Shine upon the Golden Flower Gate.

**Fifth Hymn**
The Supreme Golden Mystery Palace,
Voidly poised, the Jade Heavenly Terrace.
The Mysterious Perfection soars through the empty,
In solemn procession, it circles the void.
Divine junipers and beasts join in dance,
Dharma drums resound from the heavens.
The ten marvels’ wondrous brilliance flashes,
Mysterious tones, none out of harmony.
Pure fragrance and rare elegant music
Secure and open the myriad ages.

**Sixth Hymn**
The Golden Perfection’s ten contemplations,
Subtle and minute, they enter the formless.
Bending low, I command the Golden Dawn Youth,
Reining in tandem with the exalted numina.
Fragrant blossoms scatter with the wind,
Mysterious chants arise as natural sound.
Seated in the chariot, I summon Heaven’s Harmony,
Flying perfected ones present the jade carriage.
In the vast radiance’s clarity,
The ten sages all gather as one.

**Seventh Hymn**
The Great Vehicle’s profound and quiescent merit,
Sovereign of the ten directions’ midst.
The Dharma-wheels of Mara’s realms,
Their true forms naturally resplendent.
The six perfections scale the kalpa’s peaks,
Adorned with the Golden Numinous Chapters.
Auspicious responses arise without limit,
Flowing and illumining the multitudes of luminous yang.
The seven treasures spontaneously arise,
Palaces govern the boundless void.
All heavens rejoice together,
Streamers and blossoms scatter pure fragrance.

**Eighth Hymn**
The Great Dao has no bounds,
Universally ferrying as bridge and ford.
Where the Heavenly Venerable descends in radiance,
The ten blossoms form a neighboring realm.
The Perfect and Great Sage assembly,
Scattering blossoms, opens the three conveniences.
Revering the merit of Dharma precepts,
Ever a kin of the Jade Emperor.
Constantly nourished by jade mist,
Body and principle both free of dust.
Form receives the ever-abiding mark,
The Dao’s practice ever renewed.
Seated in audience before the heavens’ courts,
Forever severing the causes of cold kalpas.

**Ninth Hymn**
Distant and towering, the Jade Mystery Capital,
Steep and majestic, the Golden Numinous Palace.
The Void Sovereign’s dragon-banner flutters,
The eight assemblies’ true primal foundation.
Upholding the Nine Heavens’ Kings,
Glancing back at the Golden Immortals’ ancestors.
Carefree in the Mysterious Radiance’s vale,
Transcendent, all attain deliverance.
Countenances wondrous and marvelously fair,
Chanting and pacing the Flying Mystery Step.
If not a companion of the Jade Emperor,
How could one tread this path?

**Tenth Hymn**
Ascending in radiance with the jade chariot,
Together chanting the ever-abiding scripture.
Golden feathers patrol the void,
Hands holding the luminous jade lotus.
Swiftly dissolving the Three Nets,
Preserving the kalpa’s destined years.
Golden youths strike the jade chimes,
Jasper bells resound through the heavens.
Assembled, the great thousandfold multitude,
Jade void scatters dragon mist.
Flying blossoms drift through the ten directions,
Rejoicing before the Heavenly Venerable.
Marvelous non-being, non-being marvelous,
Entering the mirror, the marvelous ever mysterious.

**Eleventh Hymn**
The Void Primordial, Perfect and True,
Mysteriously void, naturally so.
Vast and limpid, pure and clear,
Congealing the pristine Golden Perfection.
The Primordial’s tallying mandate
Preserves Heaven’s eternal abiding.
The Primordial form and the threefold Dao,
Luminous and penetratingly bright.
Flowing to irrigate heaven and earth,
The three radiances shine as one.
Supreme Clarity’s mounts bear me aloft,
Wings to assist my body.
In solemn descent of the numinous,
Majestic radiance flows and illumines.
Vast and distant, I enter the mysterious,
Together ascending Jade Clarity.

**Twelfth Hymn**
Lush and splendid, the Supreme Palace,
Loftiest of the Heavenly Treasure Court.
Mysterious beyond compare,
Its radiance illumines all heavens.
My body born of the seven treasures,
Sanskrit radiance enters the formless.
The wondrous and perfect true virtue,
Flying immortals offer the green carriage.
Liberated from seven generations’ bonds,
The Jade Emperor comes to welcome me.
The bright wheel of the ten directions’ radiance,
Carefree, I ascend Jade Clarity.

**Thirteenth Hymn**
Burning incense to waft through the cavern,
Moved to encounter the Supreme Perfected.
Joy flows through the three disciples,
The five sufferings share in delight.
Golden Dawn Youths
Guard and attend my body.
The eightfold jade chariot
Conveys me to ascend the dawn.
Golden youths and mysterious maidens
Scatter blossoms to dispel confusion.
Fortune flows from the Emperor Lord,
All heavens pledge their protection.
Towering, Jade Clarity,
Vast and encompassing the great thousandfold.
All perfected ones descend in due time,
In serene flight, Supreme Clarity.
With bowed head, I praise the good,
Attending in audience the Heavenly Venerable.

**Fourteenth Hymn**
Voidly mysterious, mysteriously void,
Resplendent, Jade Clarity.
Golden Perfected scatter blossoms,
Flowing to irrigate all heavens.
Offering sincerity, cutting off thought,
Contemplating and reciting the scripture.
Cultivating the fast, burning incense,
Heavenly treasures guard the numinous.
Seven ancestors rejoice together,
Ascending into the formless.
All heavens sing in praise,
The Dao King responds in kind.
Lush and splendid, majestic radiance,
Penetratingly illumining Supreme Clarity.
The three realms are preserved and ferried,
Riding the radiance in flight.
Heavenly demons bow with clasped hands,
Jade Perfected ones welcome me.
The five sufferings are dissolved in time,
Carefree, I ascend the Supreme Capital.
With bowed head to the Three Venerables,
Descending in form through the ten directions.
Transcendent, penetratingly clear,
Purple voids intermingle in radiance.

The exalted perfected rejoice as one,
Swiftly ascending to the Jade Court.
Supreme Clarity’s peerless Golden Origin,
Jade Clarity’s Golden Perfected soars,
Stepping the void in flight—
The Jade Hymn now complete.
