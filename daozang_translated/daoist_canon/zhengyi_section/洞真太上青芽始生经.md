**The Supreme Cavern-Real Scripture of the First Emergence of the Azure Sprout**
**The Precious Diagram of the Five Generative Practices**

The first emergence of the Azure Sprout was cultivated by the Queen Mother of the West and transmitted to Master Gu Xi, the Yellow Lad Perfected of Great Valley. The Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate sealed one copy upon Mount Tai, to be transmitted thrice over seven thousand years. Those bearing the esoteric name "Purple Slip" may receive this text; if such a person appears within a hundred years, they too may receive it thrice.

After five years of practice, the Three Corpses are extinguished, the Five Spirits settle in tranquility, the Five Thearchs commune, and one roams freely among the Three Clarities.

**The Azure Sprout of the East** corresponds to the Primordial Image of the Azure Heaven. At its center is Jupiter, its flow is the essence of Wood, and below it is Mount Tai, which governs the human liver. Its qi first emerges like the tender shoots of spring grass; its radiance shines forth like the rays of the rising sun. When two partake of it together, they become one with the spirit.

**The Vermilion Sprout of the South** corresponds to the Primordial Image of the Cinnabar Heaven. At its center is Mars, its flow is the essence of Fire, and below it is Mount Heng and Huo, which govern the human heart. Its qi first emerges like crimson clouds enfolding the white sun; its radiance begins to illuminate like dark jade reflecting a vermilion abyss. When two partake of it together, they become one with the spirit.

**The Yellow Sprout of the Center** corresponds to the Primordial Image of the Yellow Heaven. At its center is Saturn, its flow is the essence of Earth, and below it is Mount Song, which governs the human spleen. Its qi is like yellow silk veiling red clouds; its radiance is like purple mist shrouding the setting sun. When two partake of it together, they become one with the spirit.

**The White Sprout of the West** corresponds to the Primordial Image of the White Heaven. At its center is Venus, its flow is the essence of Metal, and below it is Mount Hua, which governs the human lungs. Its qi is like luminous clouds entwining the bright moon; its radiance is like beholding a luminous pearl in the depths of night. When two partake of it together, they become one with the spirit.

**The Dark Sprout of the North** corresponds to the Primordial Image of the Dark Heaven. At its center is Mercury, its flow is the essence of Water, and below it is Mount Heng, which governs the human kidneys. Its qi is like pale mist swirling around jade trees; its radiance is like meteors plunging into vast waves. When two partake of it together, they become one with the spirit.

For boys and girls under twelve, knowledge of this may be attained, but practice is not yet permissible. From twelve onward, one may both know and practice it, provided there has been no illicit union—this is called the "first emergence." From fifteen onward, all is considered late.

Those who come to this knowledge late have often already suffered harm; to repair and restore becomes increasingly difficult. Though there may have been no illicit union, to awaken to the generative Dao late is still late. Late generation may yet extend life, but it cannot be called the "first emergence."

If one awakens to the generative Dao after illicit union, one must first perform purification and repentance, adhering to the regulations in due time. Without knowing the method of repentance, one may not partake in the transmission of the Scripture of the First Emergence.

Those who receive it do not die; those who attain it are certain to live. Those who live by generation together ingest the Five Qi; the Five Viscera blossom, the Five Spirits rejoice, the Five Planets scatter their influence, the Five Elders descend their numinous power, and one is borne to roam the Five Marchmounts, ascending to feast in the Five Heavens. They attain longevity and immortality, preserving their perfection as True Immortals.

For those who have suffered harm or injury, the Scripture of the First Emergence is unattainable. Without ingesting the qi of the Azure Sprout or absorbing the fluids of the Five Colors, though one may practice myriad methods, restoration remains impossible. If restoration itself is unattainable, how can the Dao be summoned?

Thus, those of like aspiration should refine the Five Virtues and diligently ingest the Five Sprouts, practicing without fail each dawn. They may then proceed toward the Five Directions and the Five Thearchs. Within no more than five years, they will ascend to the rank of Immortal Sage. The Five Thearchs will dispatch feathered chariots and cloud-borne carriages to welcome them day and night. They will wander at will, carefree, their destiny yet to ascend to the Mysterium, their traces yet to withdraw into concealment. They will traverse the world, transforming it, coming and going without obstruction.

Those who slander will bring calamity upon themselves; those who offend will incur their own misfortune. Evil persons and malevolent demons cannot destroy them. The more they are reviled, the purer they become; the more they are concealed, the more radiant they shine. Their grace and virtue flow forth, and both heavens and humans revere them.
