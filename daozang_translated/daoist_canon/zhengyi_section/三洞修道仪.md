The Dao, through primordial essence and unified qi, nurtures the Three Powers and extends to the myriad things—whether sentient or insentient, all partake of this qi. Those who attain it may outwardly assist the transformative workings of the primordial and inwardly ascend to the utmost truth. Those who remain ignorant invert purity into turbidity, grasp clarity only to muddy it, disturb the spirit-nature, and sink into the realm of lesser ghosts. How then can they hope for transcendence?

Though the great image is formless and beyond sight or sound, those who awaken to its realization depend upon transmission. According to the *Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great and Wondrous*, the utmost Dao originated with the Mystic Sages, who passed it to the Divine Perfected, who in turn transmitted it to the Numinous Immortals. These Three Perfected Ones conveyed it orally, without written texts. Only during the *Red Clarity* era of cosmic unfolding did it first appear in written script. By the *Dragon Han* and *Yan Kang* epochs, the *Lingbao* teachings gradually descended. The *Golden Towers and Jade Statutes* then revealed the ritual codes of the revealed teachings.

At that time, the *Great Peace* and *Lingbao* scriptures circulated throughout the heavens. When the era of the *Luminous Sovereigns* arrived, they were first transmitted to the Yellow Emperor. After the *Lingbao* teachings withdrew, the Five Talismans were sealed on Mount Zhong. When Great Yu governed the waters, he received them, and after dredging the rivers, concealed them again in the *Stone Drum* beneath the *Shocking Waters*—hence the *Lingbao*’s pattern of concealment and revelation.

Later, the sagely Yellow Emperor and Laozi transmitted the *Cavern Spirit* scriptures, injunctions, talismans, and charts, promulgating the *Way and Power of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi* in the world. Recluses of the age cultivated its practices in silence, and the *Cavern Spirit* teachings gradually declined.

At the end of the Eastern Han, the Three Heavens Master Zhang received the *Orthodox Unity* ritual codes from the Most High. Earlier, in the region of Shu corresponding to the *Ghost* constellation, there were twenty-four *zhi* offices of the netherworld, regulating the twenty-four qi. The *North Mang* *zhi* in *Luo Yi* used the *Yi Gorge* as the land of the *Lu Hun Rong* to suppress the nether capital. Later, it was occupied by the demonic hordes of the Six Heavens, becoming known as the *Ghost Camp*. The Celestial Master subdued them with the *Orthodox Unity* teachings. To this day, it remains a yin bureau, with ghosts serving as yin officials. The descendants of the Celestial Master have transmitted the lineage through a single heir—namely, the Zhang family of *Dragon-Tiger Mountain* in Xinzhou.

This teaching flourished in Wu and Shu, continuing into the Wei era. During the late Tang, the Celestial Master Kou Qianzhi of Mount Song further expanded its influence. Among those who illuminated the Daoist enterprise were Master Lu Xiujing, the *Master of Simplified Tranquility*, in the Jiangzuo region; and in the central lands, the Hidden Perfected Master Zhao, Celestial Master Pan, Master Li Chengyuan, Celestial Master Sima, Master Zongyuan, Celestial Master Wu, Master Niu, and the two Celestial Masters Ye Gu Yun and Ye Guang Han, along with Master Li Xi He—all luminaries of the transmitted teachings, as recorded in the *Seven Generations Chart of the Daoist Gate*. Their branches and offshoots are too numerous to count.

When the Li clan overthrew the Sui, the Most High bestowed upon them the talisman of the Mandate. Thus, they honored their ancestors and upheld the registers, sharing the fortunes of the state.

Thus were established the mushroom altars and blossom palaces, spreading across the four frontiers. The Three Caverns’ codes and precepts—from the Orthodox Unity to the Great Cavern—comprised seven grades, with registers of one hundred twenty ranks, two thousand four hundred ritual protocols, one thousand two hundred precepts, and one thousand two hundred prohibitions, all supplemented by the Four Auxiliary True Scriptures. These served as the gateway from the mundane to the sacred, aiding both state governance and personal cultivation.

During the decline of the Five Dynasties, Daoist teachings waned. Adorned in starry caps and rainbow robes, practitioners scattered to escape calamity, scriptures were lost, temples crumbled, and only the Great Clarity Palace in Bozhou stood solitary amid the ruins. Next in preservation were the temples of North Mang, Yang Terrace, Yang Auxiliary, and Qingtang, along with a few others—such as those on Tiantai, Heng and Xiang, Yuzhang, and Qian Peak—that suffered less destruction. In the mountains east of the passes, however, all was nearly razed to the ground.

Though coarse and obstinate, I possessed a rough understanding of Daoist teachings. Once, I encountered a perfected one who urged me to undertake the task of restoration. Yet, in this remote prefecture, scriptures were scarce, and I often longed for the peaks of Tai and Cui, regretting the lack of wings to reach them. In the year *guimao* (1363), a Daoist of Yang Terrace named Liu Ruozhuo arrived from the south, staff in hand, and was invited to stay in my residence. Master Liu was deeply versed in the teachings and orally transmitted to me the rites of entering the Dao, the ranks of caps and robes, which I compiled into a single scroll to fill the gaps. Should I later encounter the greater teachings, I shall await further collation and verification.

On the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month of that year, Sun Yizhong of Baoguang in Jingnan gathered this record.

**Rites for Entering the Dao**
For those newly aspiring to study the Dao: boys at seven years are called *Recorded Student Disciples*, and girls at ten years are called *Southern Student Disciples*. They first receive instruction from a master. Once their nature and conduct grow somewhat pure, they are given the Three Precepts and Five Precepts, gradually abstaining from meat and blood. Thereafter, they no longer marry.

Those already wed are called *Pure and True Disciples* (men) or *Pure and Faithful Disciples* (women). They regularly observe the ritual fasts and precepts while practicing the Way of Yellow and Red Union. If they can sever such practices, it is deemed excellent.

For unmarried boys and girls, upon reaching fifteen, they may seek a master to request ordination and leave the secular life, regardless of age. Once they have mastered the precepts with some precision, they may seek entry into the Dao, swearing vows before the Three Masters and becoming *Disciples of the Ten Precepts of Wisdom*. They don the *Crown of the Two Modes*, a yellow-corded robe with seven strips, a plain skirt of seven panels, and straw shoes.

Next, they advance through the scriptures within the Ten Divisions of the Great Vehicle. After mastering one set of texts, they receive the Eighty-One Precepts of the Initial Perfection. Upon completion, with the endorsement of seven precept masters, they are called *Disciples of the Initial Perfection of the Most High*, styled *White Tablet Daoists*. They wear the *Seven Perfections Crown*, a yellow-brown patterned robe with nine strips on the left and ten on the right, a white lower garment and yellow skirt of nine panels, sandalwood tablets, and black shoes. They spread yellow cloth upon the altar, begin secluded scripture recitation, and meditate upon the gods while practicing the Way.

Thereafter, without fixed years, as their scriptural studies deepen and their mastery of ritual forms grows, they may proceed to the Cavern Scriptures. First, they approach the Three Masters and five sponsors to request the Orthodox Unity Register of Alliance and Might, along with its twenty-four ranks.

Within the Orthodox Unity Department, there are one hundred twenty ranks in total, branching from the Yellow Way—this is the Yin Teaching, assisting the Great Yang. The Orthodox Unity Celestial Master’s lineage, from Master Heng (son of the Celestial Master) to Master Lu, disseminated these methods, which consist of acupuncture, medicine, talismans, protective charms, and incantations—minor arts for seeking blessings and healing the people, now known as the miscellaneous practices of the world. These also include register texts, though not those cultivated by the highest perfected ones, hence called the White and Black Ways.

Here, the *Yellow and Red* refers to the method of following the Yang Way, modeling heaven and earth to govern the myriad spirits. It encompasses the sequences of yin-yang, calendrical calculations, the division of humans and ghosts, the exorcism of celestial disasters, and the aid of royal transformation, enabling emperors to prolong their reigns and return to simplicity and purity. For the people of the world, those who uphold this Way may purify their hearts, fear transgressions, and avoid premature or unnatural deaths.

For married practitioners, selecting auspicious days and following yin-yang principles in union ensures that the children they bear avoid the influences of perversity, rebellion, lewdness, and impurity. It also teaches them to preserve their bodies and cherish their essence, refraining from reckless lust. This is the sagely method of compassion and salvation, all subsumed within the practices of the Orthodox Unity Department.

After receiving the Orthodox Unity Register, one may perform petitions and jiao rites for others, seal mountains and peaks for emperors, dispel and summon malevolent forces, worship the stars, and assess the rhythms of the cosmos. They are called *Disciples of the Alliance and Might of the Orthodox Unity of the Most High*, bearing the title *Libationer of [Celestial Master’s] Office of [X] Qi* within a specific treatment. For example: *True Person of the Original Destiny of the Three-Five Steps of the Red Heaven, Minister [Name]*.

Daoists who have not yet received the scriptural teachings may simply be called *Minor Portents*. They wear the *Mystic Crown*, a vermilion stole of twenty-four strips, a yellow lower garment and blue-green skirt, the *Flaming Radiance Jade Pendant*, the *Demon-Slaying Might and Spirit Sword*, the *Yellow Spirit Yu Zhang Seal Cord*, and stand upon a wooden octagonal altar carved with the Eight Trigrams.

The scriptures they receive include: *Orthodox Unity Ritual Texts* (120 scrolls), *Great Petitions* (360), *Minor Petitions* (1,200), *Rites for the Celestial Jiao* (300), *Essentials of Cultivating Perfection* (10 scrolls), *Jade Scripture* (3 scrolls), *Pointers* (3 scrolls), *The Shifting Calendar of the Great Numinous Yin-Yang* (60 scrolls), *Prohibitive Incantations* (5 scrolls), *Massage and Essence-Penetrating Texts* (3 scrolls), *Cultivating the Text of the Original Destiny* (1,000 characters), and *Yu’s Steps and Starry Network* (1 scroll). All previous Orthodox Unity practices operate within the Three Realms.

The *Ten Divisions of the Great Vehicle* mostly expound on karmic retribution, the consequences of sins and blessings, and discourses on existence and emptiness—amounting to nearly one thousand scrolls. Upon completing the cultivation of the Orthodox Unity Way, one reports to the perfected officials and advances to the fasting chamber.

**Daoists of the Cavern Spirit Department**
After receiving the Orthodox Unity Register, one may receive the *Register of the Vajra Cavern Spirit*—this is the method of the Upper Three Sovereigns, not the Three Sovereigns of this kalpa.

Those titled as *Grand Supreme Cavern Spirit Masters*. For those who renounce the secular world to enter the Dao, from this point onward, husband and wife must live apart, abstaining from meat and blood. They wear the *Interlocking Harmony Cap*, a crimson-brown robe with yellow skirts, cinnabar-red underskirts, and black shoes. They hold a white tablet, wear a jade pendant of *Azure Radiance* with four strands, and bear the *August Ultimate Cavern Spirit Seal* with its cord. They gird the *Yin-Yang Demon-Slaying Sword*, don the *Flowery Yang Turban* or the *Square Victory Cap*, and sit upon the *Nine Palaces Celestial Altar* to study the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern Spirit Scriptures*.

**Daoists of the Lofty Mystery Department**
Also called *Lofty Supreme Purple Void*. After self-cultivation in the Cavern Spirit Way and achieving merit, they advance to receive the *Grand Supreme Lofty Mystery Register*, becoming known as *Grand Supreme Purple Void Disciples*, *Lofty Mystery Disciples*, *Lofty Mystery Masters*, or *Wandering Mystery Masters*, with the formal address: *Your Servant [Name]*. They wear the *Five Peaks Cap*, a turquoise-green mantle with thirty-two strips, white skirts, yellow underskirts, and black shoes. They hold the *Longevity Wooden Tablet* and sit upon the *Four Qi Altar*, adorned with a cinnabar-red tassel of pure light. They bear the *Five Elders’ Interlocking Perfection Seal* with its cord, gird the *Vajra Cavern Clarity Sword*, and wear the *Reed-Slender Turban* or the *Universal Prosperity Cap*. Their studies include the *Daode jing*, *Scripture of Western Ascent*, *Jade Calendar Scripture*, *Scripture of Wondrous Perfection*, *Scripture of Treasure Radiance*, *Pillow Scripture*, *Contemplation of Spirit Diagrams*, *Grand Supreme Textual Exegesis*, *Inner Exegesis*, *Natural Fasting Rituals*, *Virtue’s Dignified Conduct* (150 articles), *Virtue’s Precepts* (500 articles), and *Virtue’s Commandments* (183 sections).

**Daoists of the Ascending Mystery Department**
Upon advancement from the Lofty Mystery Department, they receive the *Grand Supreme Ascending Mystery Register*, becoming known as *Grand Supreme Numinous Treasure Ascending Mystery Inner Teaching Disciples*, *Ascending Mystery Perfected Unity Masters*, or *Peerless Radiant Perfected Ones*, with the formal address: *Your Servant [Name]*. They wear the *Hibiscus Cap*, a green mantle with forty-two strips, white skirts, cinnabar-red underskirts, and black shoes. They hold a white tablet and sit upon the *Plain Text Altar*, donning the *Carefree Turban* or the *Moon Gauze Cap*. Their studies include the *Ascending Mystery Register* (1 scroll), *Ascending Mystery Vows and Precepts* (300 articles), *Clarifying Perfection Regulations* (3 scrolls), *Jade Casket Precepts* (3 scrolls), *Heaven-Ascending Certificate* (1 document), *Ascending Mystery Audience Ritual* (1 scroll), and the *Scripture of Ascending Mystery* (10 scrolls). At this stage, they observe the *Six Perfections’ Brahmanic Qi*, which is the *Upper Clarity Realm beyond the Three Realms*—not to be confused with the Brahmanic heavens of the Śramaṇa tradition.

**Daoists of the Middle Alliance Cavern Mystery Department**
Upon advancement from the Ascending Mystery Department, they receive the *Middle Alliance Register* (9 scrolls), comprising thirty-six ranks and nine certificates: the *Contemplating the Subtle and Resolving Will Certificate*, *Golden Horse Post Station Certificate*, *Five Thearchs’ Release of Form Certificate*, *Natural Certificate*, *Great Illumination Certificate*, *Three Sovereigns’ Certificate*, *Water Official’s Release of Seven Ancestors Certificate*, *Heaven-Ascending Certificate*, and *Release of Earthly Roots Certificate*. They are titled *Grand Supreme Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Disciples*, *Peerless Cavern Mystery Masters*, *Eastern Peak Masters*, or *Azure Thearch Perfected Ones*, with the formal address: *Your Servant [Name]*. They wear the *Far-Wandering Cap*, a five-colored purple mantle, crimson-red skirts, blue-green underskirts, vermilion shoes, and sit upon the *Five Celestial Bodies Purple Altar*. They wear a *Blue Jade Interlocking Pattern Pendant*, bear the *Eight Effulgences Golden Perfection Seal*, and gird the *Sunlight Cavern Spirit Sword*. They don the *Court Ascension Cap* (formerly called the *Southern Court Cap*) or the *Three Celestial Bodies Turban*. Their studies include the *Twelve Divisions of the Numinous Treasure Cavern Mystery Scriptures*.

**Daoists of the Three Caverns Department**
After cultivation in the Cavern Mystery Department, they advance to receive the *Three Caverns Treasure Register* (24 ranks, 24 scrolls), with twenty-four certificates, nine pairs of golden buttons, twelve pairs of silver rings, a pair of golden dragons, a pair of jade fish, one jade tortoise, one jade horse, one azure jade tablet, one yellow jade tablet, one dark jade tablet, and a pair of *Dragon-Headed Golden Knives*. They are titled *Three Caverns Masters*, *Eastern Peak Azure Thearch Perfected Ones*, or *Ascending Mystery Masters*, with the formal address: *Your Servant [Name]*. They wear the *Converging Radiance Cap*, a cyan-green mist mantle with forty-nine strips, cinnabar-red skirts, yellow underskirts, and vermilion shoes. They sit upon the *Summoning Perfection Altar*, wear a *Yellow Jade Pendant*, bear the *Three Celestial Bodies Seal*, and gird the *Demon-Dissolving Sword*. They don the *Verdant Flower Turban* or the *Five Peaks Cap*. Their studies include the *Three Caverns Teachings* and the *Nine Perfected Regulations and Methods*. From this stage onward, they refine their practices, abandon all conditioned actions, and align their movements with true subtlety, preparing to advance to the *Great Cavern Upper Methods*.

**Daoists of the Great Cavern Department**
After cultivating the Three Caverns Methods, they next ascend to the *Upper Clarity Golden Gates*, where they are selected through pure refinement to become those who attain the Dao. They are titled *Upper Clarity Great Cavern Three Radiance Disciples*, *Peerless Three Caverns Masters*, *Eastern Peak Perfected Ones*, or *Virtue Masters*, with the formal address: *Your Servant [Name]*. They wear the *Purple Palace Permeating Perfection Cap*, a nine-colored *Departing Net Mantle*, purple skirts with cinnabar-red patterns, and hold a *Jade Tablet*. They wear vermilion shoes and sit upon the *Thunder Spirit Altar*, bearing the *Nine Radiance Jade Pendant* and the *Peerless Ultimate Dao Seal* with its cord. They gird the *Radiant Essence Sword* and don the *Yellow Tranquility Cap*. Their studies include the *Three Officials’ Release of Ancestors Contract*, *Severing Earthly Roots Certificate*, *Heaven-Ascending Certificate*, *Five Thearchs’ Demon-Taming Protective Certificate*, *Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords’ Merit Recognition Certificate*, *Flying Steps Methods*, and the *Great Secrets of the Golden Elixir*. From this point onward, they transmit the complete methods to worthy disciples in the world, one person per generation. They ascend the *Yellow Altar*, report to the *Nine Heavens*, and perform the blood-oath ritual—using their own blood. They divide the certificates and sever the contracts with golden fish, jade dragons, red jade tablets, and round jade ornaments, swearing oaths before the myriad spirits before transmitting the upper methods. After transmitting the methods, they may then undertake the *Returning Chariot Way*. Once their merit and practice are complete, they bid farewell to their disciples and construct a plain wooden chariot. Their disciples personally attend them, driving the *Sweeping Chariot* in circles before entering the mountains of their chosen abode. At the mountain pass or valley entrance, they burn the chariot. From then on, the master focuses solely on cultivating the *Golden Gates’ Posterior Sage Flying Ascension Way*, transcending the Three Realms and never returning to the mortal world.

**Mountain-Dwelling Daoists**
Mountain-dwelling Daoists wear the *Balanced Qi Cap*, a patchwork mantle of mountain waters and cloud mists, yellow cloth skirts and underskirts, white shoes or straw sandals. They sit upon the *Seven Stars Altar* and bear the *Two Prohibitions Seals*, girding the *Eastern and Western Prohibition Subduing Spirit Swords*, and don the *Mystery Turban*.

These practitioners of the Dao each follow their own attainments, devoting themselves to seclusion and solitude, offering no salvation to the world—such are the mountain-dwelling, frost-nesting Daoists described in the scriptures.

**Dongyuan Daoists**
These are known as *Samādhi Dharma Masters*. They wear the *Penetrating Mystery Cap*, a mantle of thirty-one azure strips, cinnabar skirts and yellow underskirts, dark shoes, and hold a tablet. They sit upon the *Yellow Script Altar*, bear the *Five Sections Seals of Dongyuan*, and gird the *Cavern Radiance Sword*. Their practice is the *Dongyuan Samādhi Dharma*, which above repels flying celestial demons, in the middle regulates the five qi, and below severs the myriad spirits—often aiding the world as well.

**Beidi Taixuan Daoists**
These are called *Disciples of the Supreme Clarity Northern Emperor Taixuan*. They wear the *Star Chronicle Cap* and feathered black robes, white skirts and yellow underskirts, dark shoes, and sit upon the *Summoning Spirits Altar*. Holding a tablet, they bear the *Fengdu Seal* and gird the *Demon-Slaying Sword*. They are conferred:
- *Northern Emperor Register* (2 scrolls)
- *Subduing Demons Scripture* (3 scrolls)
- *Heavenly Peng Scripture* (10 scrolls)
- *Northern Emperor Prohibitions and Incantations Scripture* (3 scrolls)
- *Flying Mystery Feather Chapters Scripture* (10 scrolls)
- *Northern Emperor Summoning Spirits and Calling Souls Scripture* (3 scrolls)
- *Northern Emperor Thunder Duke Dharma* (1 scroll)
- *Essential Fengdu Register* (3 scrolls)
- *Transmitting Ghost Strategies* (3 scrolls)
- *Northern Emperor Three Sections Talismans* (1 scroll)
- *Northern Emperor Court Rituals* (1 scroll)
Their practice governs the ghostly spirits of the Six Heavens and the dispelling of evil to avert misfortune.

**Women’s Offices**
Their rituals and transmissions of registers and methods are identical to those of male officers. Those who study the Great Vehicle scriptures are called *Supreme Perfected Female Disciples of the Great Dao*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Three-Leaf Mystery Cap*, a mantle of twelve *Passing Rosy Clouds* strips, bound in azure with a yellow outer layer tied at the right shoulder, plain skirts and yellow underskirts, and hold a staff with straw sandals.

**Zhengyi Mengwei Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Mysterious Capital Zhengyi Mengwei*, under the *Celestial Master’s* lineage, *Minister of [Oratory] Qi, Red Heaven Three-Five Step Network Primary Youth*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Cavern Yin Cap*, a mantle of twenty-four yellow rosy clouds strips, red-scripted skirts and yellow underskirts, dark shoes, hold a tablet, and sit upon the *Eight Trigrams Altar*.

The *Red Heaven Three-Five* refers to the general movement of the sun and moon, which follow the yellow and red paths, called the *Two Luminaries*. True Persons oversee the affairs of the yellow and red paths to rectify yin and yang, using the palaces of the sun, moon, and stars as their administrative seats. There is also the *White Path Dharma*: from the first day of the lunar month to the full moon, it is white and bright; from the sixteenth to the dark moon, it is black and dim. Daoist followers seeking minor blessings pray to the moon when it is white and to the stars when it is black—hence the *Black and White Paths* and their corresponding teachings. These two paths are inferior to the yellow and red.

**Dongshen Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Perfected Dongshen*, *Cavern Spirit Primary Consort*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Vermilion Yang Cap*, a mantle of thirty-two vermilion strips, yellow skirts and cinnabar underskirts, dark shoes, hold a tablet, and sit upon the *Nine Palaces Altar*.

**Gaoxuan Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Perfected Gaoxuan*, *Purple Void Youth Lord*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Wandering Mystery Cap*, yellow-brown robes, azure skirts and plain underskirts, dark shoes, hold a tablet, and sit upon the *Azure Altar*.

**Shengxuan Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Perfected Shengxuan*, *Non-Supreme Inner Teaching True Unity Numinous Consort*, with the title *Cloud Lesser Perfected Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Four Mysteries Cap*, a mantle of azure rosy clouds, yellow skirts and cinnabar underskirts, dark shoes, hold a tablet, and sit upon the *Verdant Altar*.

**Zhongmeng Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Perfected Lingbao Dongxuan*, also known as *Dongxuan Dharma Masters* and *Eastern Marchmount Consort*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Hibiscus Cap*, purple-brown robes, azure skirts and cinnabar underskirts, hold a tablet, gird the *Yang Radiance Sword*, wear white beaded tassels, and bear the *Threefold Primordial Void Seal Ribbon*, sitting upon the *Five Qi Altar*.

**Sandong Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Clarity Three Caverns*, *Non-Supreme Three Caverns Dharma Masters*, *Eastern Marchmount Azure Numinous Consort*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Cloud-Connecting Cap*, vermilion-brown robes, azure skirts and green underskirts, dark shoes, hold a tablet, sit upon the *Four Spirits Altar*, wear jade pendants, white tassels, bear the *Three Caverns Seal Ribbon*, and gird the *Nine Perfected Sword*.

**Shangqing Female Officers**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminaries*, *Practitioners of the Non-Supreme Three Caverns Dharma Masters*, *Eastern Marchmount Azure Numinous Primary Lady*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Mystery Numinous Flying Phoenix Cap*, a mantle of five-colored cloud rosy clouds, azure skirts and red gauze underskirts, vermilion shoes, hold a tablet, and sit upon the *Thunder Numinous Altar*.

Their method of *Turning the Chariot to Enter the Mountains* is entirely the same as that of male officers.

**Mountain-Dwelling Female Daoists**
They are called *Female Disciples of the Great Dao*, with the title *Minister [Name]*. They wear the *Dual Qi Cap*, a mantle of twenty-four patched strips, azure silk skirts and yellow cloth underskirts, straw sandals, sit upon the *Eight Luminaries Altar*, and hold a tablet.

The *Rituals for Cultivating the Three Caverns* are thus concluded.
