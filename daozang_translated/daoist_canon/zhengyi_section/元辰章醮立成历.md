The altar shall be square, measuring twenty-four *chi* on each side. Place an incense burner in each of the five directions, and suspend banners, canopies, and lamps in the corresponding directional colors—seven for each direction, totaling twenty-eight, with an additional seven within each inner direction. The trays marked with numbers one and two are for pouring libations of wine.

Proceed in proper sequence, erecting placards and affixing them, with left and right paths distinct to prevent confusion.

Once the arrangement is complete, proceed to pour the wine:
1. Begin with the Five Emperors’ plates, starting from the east and circling left.
2. Next, pour for the Seven Stars, beginning with *Kui* and proceeding toward *Gang*.
3. Then, pour for the Three Terraces, moving left.
4. Next, pour for the twelve seasonal deities, starting from *Hai* and *Zi*, circling left to completion.
5. Finally, pour for the twenty-eight lunar mansions, beginning with *Jiao* in the east and circling left to *Zhen*, completing three rounds of libation.

Then, close your eyes and inwardly visualize the gods and spirits of heaven and earth, all arrayed in solemn assembly, before proceeding.

Next, recite the torch talisman and incantation:
*"Your servant humbly invokes the Straight-Command Talisman Generals, the Lords of Jia-Zi, those on duty this year, this month, this day, this hour. So-and-so enters the oratory to present a memorial, severing all demonic influences—slay the evil! Swiftly, swiftly, as in law and decree!"*

Then, facing the Heavenly Gate, recite the incantation:

The heavens unfold, the earth expands—ghostly paths perish.
Today I establish the altar; your servant desires to present a memorial.
At the northwest quadrant, the center of *Xu* and *Hai*,
Here lies the Heavenly Gate, seizing and recording all inauspiciousness.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees of the Most High Lord Lao!

Next, facing the Earthly Portal, recite the incantation:
Vital *qi* flows unobstructed—hundreds of demons and myriad spirits
Do not share the truth’s nature.
Today I present a memorial, having established the altar ground.
At the southeast quadrant, the center of *Chen* and *Si*,
Here lies the Earthly Portal, gathering and recording all misfortune.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees of the Most High Lord Lao!

Next, facing the Ghost Gate, recite the incantation:
Yang’s light streams radiant—no demon dares arise.
Now I desire to present a memorial, first establishing the altar court.
At the northeast quadrant, the center of *Chou* and *Yin*,
Here lies the Ghost Gate, examining ghosts and seizing demonic spirits.
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees of the Most High Lord Lao!

Next, the Human Gate incantation:
Emerging from yin, entering yang—the Most High sends me forth.
The five viscera unfold; the great spirits hear this.
All hasten to don solemn attire; today I present a memorial.
At the southwest quadrant, the center of *Shen* and *Wei*,
Gathering and capturing all ghosts—who dares oppose?
Swiftly, swiftly, as in the statutes and decrees of the Most High Lord Lao!

Next, enter the altar through the Heavenly Gate, proceeding to the eastern incense table. Offer incense and strike the teeth nine times. Recite:
The nine *qi* of the east, the Azure Heaven’s bright star,
Great spirits radiate, illuminating the eastern quarter with penetrating light.
Nine gates turn like candles; yang’s light sweeps away filth and miasma.
The Luminous Youth attends, guarding my hall.
Subduing eastern demons, reporting to the Imperial Lord,
Upholding the true Dao, the vermilion script of jade.
The nine heavens’ talismanic command dispatches dragon couriers.
All under heaven is pacified; I attain transcendence.

Proceed to the southern incense table. Offer incense and strike the teeth three times. Recite:
The Cinnabar Heaven of the south, threefold black radiance flowing,
The Fire Star revolves like a candle, penetrating the Great Yang.
Above dwell the crimson spirits, the Luminous Youths.
Commanding the fire soldiers, guarding the three palaces,
Slaying eastern demons, severing demon kings.
As the Northern Emperor decrees, the eight winds of fire surge.
Interlocking bells blaze—who dares disobey?
The true Dao flows; I receive supreme merit.
Preserving heaven’s longevity, enduring through kalpas without end.

Proceed to the western incense table. Offer incense and strike the teeth seven times. Recite:
The seven *qi* of the west, the White Heaven’s Great White,
Flowing essence shines brilliantly; the Metal Gate gleams.
Within the Great Darkness dwells the White Sovereign, named Imperial Spirit.
Protecting and pacifying spirits, guarding my form,
Severing demonic roots, the kingly Dao shines clearly.
Palaces are ordered; the three luminaries align.
The Dao harmonizes with nature; I ascend to the Purple Court.
The numinous treasure’s talismanic command universally benefits all beings.
Merit extends to all; heaven and earth attain peace.

Proceed to the northern incense table. Offer incense and strike the teeth five times. Recite:
The Mysterious Heaven of the north, five *qi* meandering,
The Chronogram Star blazes, illuminating the Supreme Subtlety.
The *qi*-spirit’s honored deity, clad in flying dark feathers,
Guards the five gates, inspecting essences and capturing transgressors.
Who dares test me? The Falling Star severs and crushes.
As the royal talisman proclaims, the eight mights of divine truth,
Demon gates close; the true Dao shines forth.
Illuminating my body, the three lights unite in splendor.
I spur the void and ride the floating; my form ascends in immortal flight.

Proceed to the central incense table. Offer incense and strike the teeth twelve times. Recite:
The Yellow Center of the center, governing *qi* and unifying all,
The Mysterious True Star of the Pole shines forth with flowing radiance.
Nine Heavenly Luminous Youths, twelve in number,
Primal *qi* and yang essence flame upward in vermilion smoke.
Penetrating this dwelling and my body,
Hundreds of demons are cast down; myriad ghosts are slain.
The Central Mountain’s divine incantation universally commands.
The five spirits pacify; my body ascends as an immortal.

Additionally, the five directional incantations may be employed as before—equally efficacious for memorial presentations and altar establishments:

The east’s Luminous One summons the true great spirits,
Clad in azure robes with black sashes, their forms spanning a hundred paces.
Their heads reach the heavens, devouring demonic ghosts.
Their mouths hold mountains, consuming five hundred at dawn and ten thousand at dusk.
Ten by ten, five by five—they swallow with their own robes.

The Lord of the Three *Qi* of the Cinnabar Heaven of the south,
Clad in crimson robes, leading the Red Spirit Kings,
Captures all ghosts, requiring ten thousand catties of flesh.
The Solar Envoys, bearing fire banners, each receive a portion,
Feasting until blood flows like rivers.

The Lord of the Seven *Qi* of the White Heaven of the west,
Clad in white, his form ten thousand *zhang* tall,
His face wrinkled, wielding a great iron rod.
Flying through the void, he captures all ghosts,
Devouring livers and consuming lungs at will.
I rely on the Great White’s assistance, the awe of numinous might.

The Black Numinous Lord of the Supreme Subtlety of the north,
Who loves life and abhors killing,
The honored Chronogram Star of the five *qi* aids transformation,
Attending to blessings and averting misfortune, delivering souls from darkness.
Countless demons dare not intrude; bound specters are handed to the Imperial Lord.

The Yellow Emperor of the center, governing the four directions from the central palace,
The Mysterious True pays reverence, slaying demon kings.
The five stars pacify and guard; the radiance shines upon the realm.
Five fragrances dispel corpse impurities; noxious *qi* does not arise.
The six heavens’ demonic spirits dare not oppose.
Today, reciting the incantation, the hearts of myriad ghosts tremble.
Twelve masters of yang’s light illuminate this dwelling and my body, strengthening its essence.

First, strike the teeth twenty-four times and activate the censer:
Most High Mysterious Origin, Five Numinous Lord Lao, Three *Qi* True Spirits,
Urgent summons to the five true officials within your servant’s body,
The Three and Five Merit Officers, the upper and lower great ministers,
The Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the incense-bearing envoys,
The message-transmitting Celestial Maidens, the document-holding youths—
Twenty-four each—and the twelve minor officials of the President of the Secretariat and the Director of Communications.
Hasten to report to the Most High of the Ten Directions, the Mysterious Origin Great Dao of the Three Heavens above.
Your servants now, with utmost reverence, perform rites for so-and-so to dissolve calamities.
Burning incense, we humbly announce our wish for the eight directions’ true *qi* to enter our bodies.

The announcement swiftly ascends, directly presented before the Jade Emperor’s celestial throne.

Next, recite the *Hymn of Welcoming the Divine*:

Today we sacrifice to the Five Emperors,
Our words ascend to the Mysterious Void.
By nature, they reach the numinous spirits,
Inscribed in the endless records of night.
We beseech the Primal Gate as our portal,
Entrusting ourselves to the Lord of the East.
All official matters are dissolved,
Every illness is wholly dispelled.

Radiant Five Emperors,
Ever steadfast, never faltering.
They transform all things,
Even the crawling and flying take form.
Their place is with Heaven and Earth,
Born together with the Dao.
Abiding in height yet not aloof,
Soaring yet never tilting.
Dwelling in darkness yet not hidden,
Residing in turbidity yet not sullied.
Hard and soft adapt to custom—
Thus are they called divine.

Now we seek to dispel calamity,
To vanquish demonic legions.
With pure wine and dried venison,
We welcome the Great Luminance.
The Five Emperors partake,
Bestowing long life.
The Controller of Destiny extends our years,
Inscribing our names anew in the register of life.

Majestic Northern Portal,
Keeper of the ledger of mortal death—
Today our words ascend,
Through the Mystic Maiden and Dragon Couriers.
Let our kin remain unharmed,
While the wicked and rebellious are slain.
May the sick recover,
May the bound be freed.
Together with the sages we wander,
Our names recorded in the Jade Chronicle.

Next, kneel in reverence.

Having assumed the dharma-position, the Celestial Master’s qi-regulating Libationer declares:

May their merciful radiance deign to descend and attend.

We, [Name] and company, bow twice and offer fragrant wine.

**First Libation**
We invoke the Lords who Dispel Calamity of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon; the Lord who Dispels Calamity of the Controller of Destiny; the Lords who Dispel Calamity of the Four Seasons; the Lord of the Origin-Dispelling Star; the Lords who Dispel the Entangling and Binding Spirits; the Lords who Dispel the Great and Lesser Slaughters; the Lords who Dispel the Punishments of Law and Penal Codes; the Lords of the Great and Lesser Assemblies; the Lords who Dispel the Ominous Origins; the Lords who Repel Slaughter and Calamity of the Four Seasons; the Lords who Govern Destiny of the Five Planets; the Lords who Govern Destiny of the Five Emperors; the Lords who Govern Destiny of the Five Peaks; the Lords who Govern Destiny of the Six Jia; the Lords who Govern Destiny of the Seven Stars; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Earth Office; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Central Perfected Earth; the Lord who Oversees Destiny of our Household Elder; the Lord who Governs Destiny of our Household Ancestor; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Crossroads; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Current Year; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Current Month; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Current Day; the Lord who Governs Destiny of the Present Hour; the Lord who Governs Destiny of our Natal Star; the Lord who Governs Destiny of our Embryo; the Lord who Governs Destiny of our Birth Month; the Lord who Governs Destiny of our Current Age; the Perfected Officers of the Nine Provinces’ Earth Altars, Earth Lords, and Earth Spirits; the Perfected Officers of the Village Domains; the Generals of the Eight Divisions; the Perfected Officers of the Local Earth Gods; and all the Lords of the Spirits. May they descend to their positions and seats. We, [Name] and company, bow twice and offer fragrant wine.

**Second Libation**
Your servant, [Name], humbly petitions:

Though base and unworthy, of dull and coarse nature, I have been graciously favored by the profound compassion of the Elder Master who bestowed this dharma. On the day I received the precepts, I was led by five guarantors and seven witnesses to ascend and pay homage to the Three Heavenly Venerables, to declare my vows to the Ten Directions, and to form a pact with the myriad spirits. The true and essential words of the Master bound me to assist in the governance of qi by Heaven, to aid the state and sustain life, to rescue the living and deliver the dead, and to serve as a bridge for all beings.

Yet the fortunes of the world have withered, and spirits and demons intermingle. The Three Calamities spread unchecked, and plagues, madness, and malevolence arise everywhere. The four hundred and four diseases afflict the people, and countless calamities entwine them, making it difficult to hear or see their suffering. Whenever supplications are made, I dare not ignore or obstruct them, though I am overwhelmed by what I witness.

Thus, I respectfully present [Name], an official, man or woman, of [State, County, Village], aged [number] years, whose destiny has been summoned by a hundred misfortunes. Their calamities run deep, for in the year and month of their birth, they were afflicted by the presence of the Demon-Star and the Celestial Net. Numerous taboos converged, and inauspicious disasters befell them. In the year of their current age and their natal star, they are ensnared by the Web of Doom. The branches and stems of their natal star and birth month clash and harm one another, while baleful stars and ominous lodges descend upon them. They may be struck by the Four Slaughters or assailed by the Five Ghosts, afflicted by the Six Harms or wounded by the Seven Injuries. They may be encircled by the Eight Winds or beset by the Nine Calamities. Misfortune follows them, bringing lingering illness, emaciation, and the decline of their strength and vitality, with countless ailments arising. Their soul may take flight, or they may face mortal peril. They may be confined in the ghostly prisons of mountains and springs, or tormented by malevolent spirits and bound by demonic hordes. Each joint and organ is guarded by its own spirit, and when their essence and spirit falter, a hundred misfortunes naturally arise.

When Heaven is obstructed, disasters and harms are born. When humans encounter decline and calamity, they too suffer misfortune and woe. Their allotted lifespan may be exhausted, and their fate may wither. They may face the Three Origins’ absolute calamities, or their affairs may be obscured in the Hall of Light. The branches and stems of their year and fate may fall into the desolation of solitude and void, or their fate may coincide with the inauspicious year of the Grand Year-Star. The Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams may clash and sever one another, or the Five Ghosts and Four Slaughters may seize the opportunity to bring disaster. Their five viscera may be depleted, and the four directions may bring punishment and misfortune. The poisonous qi of the Eight Winds and the ghosts of the Nine Uglies, along with the perverse and malevolent specters of the world’s old qi, may invade their body, congealing in the five viscera, roaming through the marrow, and stirring the seven po. Within, they breed treachery. The fleshly body, dull and foolish, clings to life and fears death, unaware of what merit or virtue might extricate it.

I have heard that the Great Compassion of the Most High loves life and abhors death. Having opened Heaven and spread Earth, nurturing all living beings, it permits repentance for sins of any magnitude, offering deliverance to all, great and small.

In the time of the Yellow Emperor, people’s lifespans reached their full measure: the longest lived to one hundred and twenty years, the middling to one hundred, and the shortest to eighty. Those who fell short of these three spans were cut down unjustly by Heaven. Now that I have encountered disaster and calamity, I dare, in this time of trial and tribulation, to lay bare my liver and expose my heart.

With reverence, I present offerings of life-sustaining rice, white silk, five-colored patterned silks of the five directions, counting rods, pure oil, wine and dried meats, incense cakes, sweet fruits, life-extending green threads, golden figurines, golden rings, cinnabar incense, silver ingots, a writing knife, brush, paper, ink, life-delivering banners of the five directions, and pure mats—each item duly prepared—to beseech the dissolution of this calamitous convergence. These instruments for extracting names from the Register of Destined Death are arrayed before the august deities. I humbly pray that the invoked deliverance deities, the Lords of Life’s Span, the Eastern King Father, the Western Queen Mother, the Lords of Records and Constraints, the Directors of Destiny, and all assembled gods may gather in righteous communion, bestow grace, and descend with blessings.

May the Directors of Destiny and Records ascend to the Nine Heavens, examine my name in the celestial registers, discern the length of my life, and locate the depth of my disasters and calamities. I beseech that my name be stricken from the Black Register of the Right Palace of Heaven’s Bureau, removed from the Death Ledgers of the Three Offices of the Most High, and inscribed anew in the Book of Life.

Prostrating again, I offer this fragrant wine.

Next, the second libation:
If my lifespan is too short, I beg that its measure be extended.
If trees wither and dry, I beg that their sap and luster be restored.
If granaries lack grain, I beg that their bushels be replenished.
If my allotted span nears its end, I beg for added years to prolong my life.
If my life is brief, I beg for its continuation; if disaster looms, I beg for its dissolution.
If misfortune threatens, I beg for its eradication; if decline sets in, I beg for its reversal.
If calamity approaches, I beg for its deliverance; if ghosts assail, I beg for their capture.
If snares entangle, I beg for their unraveling; may misfortune be transformed into fortune.
May what is lost be restored, and fleeting moments be prolonged.
The Eastern Dipper governs life’s span, the Western Dipper records names,
The Northern Dipper averts death, the Southern Dipper bestows life.

If from my ancestors to this day, lingering entanglements of karmic retribution remain unresolved, I beg that the black records of Heaven’s Bureau be cleared of their harm, and that the earthly spirits and malevolent forces afflicting my descendants be dissolved. May the disasters within my body be eradicated, and my primordial destiny be uplifted.

If my life is fated to end in the East, I beseech the gods of the Northern Kan trigram and the five divisions of their officials to extinguish ghosts, dispel misfortune, and extend my deliverance from calamity.
If my life is fated to end in the South, I beseech the gods of the Eastern Zhen trigram and the nine divisions of their officials to extinguish ghosts, dispel misfortune, and extend my deliverance from calamity.
If my life is fated to end in the West, I beseech the Central Lord of Stability and the twelve divisions of their officials to extinguish ghosts, dispel misfortune, and extend my deliverance from calamity.
If my life is fated to end in the North, I beseech the gods of the Western Dui trigram and the seven divisions of their officials to extinguish ghosts, dispel misfortune, and extend my deliverance from calamity.
If my life is fated to end in the four corners, I beseech the gods of the Southern Li trigram and the three divisions of their officials to extinguish ghosts, dispel misfortune, and extend my deliverance from calamity.

I humbly pray to the Lords of Jupiter, the Eastern Chen, the Eastern Dipper, the Seven Lords of the Horn, Neck, Root, Heart, Tail, and Winnowing Basket constellations, the Lord of Mount Tai of the Eastern Marchmount, the Lords of the Nine Yi, the Lords of Jia and Yi, and the Lords of Yin and Mao: may they dissolve the karmic entanglements recorded in Heaven’s Bureau and dispel the earthly spirits and malevolent forces within the nine myriad li of the East. May they eradicate the afflictions within my liver, dispel the green disasters, green calamities, green poisons, wood spirits, and wood harms of the East, and protect me during the seventy-two days of the Wood’s flourishing season in the first, second, and third months, that I may pass through this time by your grace.

I humbly pray to the Lords of Mars, the Southern Chen, the Southern Dipper, the Seven Lords of the Well, Ghost, Willow, Star, Spread, Wing, and Axle constellations, the Lord of Mount Heng of the Southern Marchmount, the Lords of the Eight Man, the Lords of Bing and Ding, and the Lords of Si and Wu: may they dissolve the karmic harm recorded in Heaven’s Bureau and dispel the earthly spirits and malevolent forces within the eight myriad li of the South. May they eradicate the afflictions within my heart, dispel the red disasters, red calamities, red ghosts, red poisons, fire spirits, and fire harms of the South, and protect me during the seventy-two days of the Fire’s flourishing season in the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, that I may pass through this time by your grace.

I humbly pray to the Lords of Venus, the Western Chen, the Western Dipper, the Seven Lords of the Straddling, Bond, Stomach, Pleiades, Net, Turtle Beak, and Orion constellations, the Lord of Mount Hua of the Western Marchmount, the Lords of the Six Rong, the Lords of Geng and Xin, and the Lords of Shen and You: may they dissolve the karmic harm recorded in Heaven’s Bureau and dispel the earthly spirits and malevolent forces within the six myriad li of the West. May they eradicate the afflictions within my lungs, dispel the white disasters, white calamities, white afflictions, white poisons, metal spirits, and metal harms of the West, and protect me during the seventy-two days of the Metal’s flourishing season in the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, that I may pass through this time by your grace.

I humbly pray to the Lords of Mercury, the Northern Chen, the Northern Dipper, the Seven Lords of the Dipper, Ox, Girl, Emptiness, Danger, Encampment, and Wall constellations, the Lord of Mount Dai of the Northern Marchmount, the Lords of the Five Di, the Lords of Ren and Gui, and the Lords of Hai and Zi: may they dissolve the karmic harm recorded in Heaven’s Bureau and dispel the earthly spirits and malevolent forces within the five myriad li of the North. May they eradicate the afflictions within my kidneys, dispel the black disasters, black poisons, black harms, black illnesses, water spirits, and water calamities of the North, and protect me during the seventy-two days of the Water’s flourishing season in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, that I may pass through this time by your grace.

I humbly pray to the Lords of Saturn, the Central Dipper, the Lords of the Celestial Pivot, the Seven Lords of the Seven Governors, the Lord of Mount Song of the Central Marchmount, the Lords of the Three Qin, and the Lords of Wu and Ji: may they dissolve the karmic harm recorded in Heaven’s Bureau and dispel the earthly spirits and malevolent forces. May they eradicate the afflictions within my spleen, dispel the yellow disasters, yellow calamities, yellow poisons, earth bandits, and earth ghosts of the Center, and protect me during the seventy-two days of the Earth’s flourishing season in the months of Chen, Xu, Chou, and Wei, and the eighteen days of each of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth months, that I may pass through this time without misfortune.

Deep in my distant anxieties, I look up in hope to the august deities, praying for your numinous grace and radiant protection, that I may be spared from calamity and misfortune, and my entire household preserved and sustained. I bow twice again, offering fragrant wine.

Next, the offering of wine:
May it further dissolve the penal afflictions I have suffered since the year’s beginning; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of official imprisonment and judicial punishment; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of encountering ghostly perils in travel; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of being examined for transgressing the Dao; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of interrogation by the dead; may it dissolve the afflictions of beatings and blows; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of offending or displeasing ancestral spirits; may it dissolve the afflictions of offending the Ao deities; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of short lifespan; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of exhausted fate; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of the Five Ghosts and Four Killers; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of the Six Harms, Seven Injuries, Eight Difficulties, and Nine Pitfalls; may it dissolve the afflictions of tigers, wolves, venomous insects, snakes, and wasp poisons; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of disasters, weeping, misfortunes, and lingering curses; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of terrified wandering souls; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of blades, weapons, and bloodshed; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of bondage, cangues, and fetters; may it dissolve the afflictions of being trampled by oxen or horses; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of lost wealth and failed ventures; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of the Five Phases clashing in harm; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of the Year Star in the heavens; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of solitary stars and widow constellations causing obstruction; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of constructed curses, spells, and malevolent prayers; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of deathly curses and interrogations; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of violating laws and defying statutes; may it dissolve the penal afflictions of offending deities, deceiving ghosts, reckless speech, and unfulfilled vows leading to calamity; may it dissolve celestial afflictions; may it dissolve the afflictions of the year, month, day, hour, great and small—may all afflictions be released and dispersed in due time.

I bow twice again, offering this wine of examination. Next, the offering of wine.

We further invoke the assembly of revered divine immortals, officials, and generals, humbly beseeching that the Dragon Chariots halt their course and the Celestial Hosts rest in tranquil repose upon their seats. We, on behalf of [Name], respectfully present the memorial of the Primordial Hour of Destiny, its words woven into a tapestry of supplication.

Fearing that the transmission of our petition may be too vast for instant comprehension, we implore the august deities to linger in gracious attendance, that they may heed our prayer as we prostrate ourselves to present this memorial. To submit the memorial, we knock our teeth nine times, facing east by day and north by night, with doors unsealed.

All who emerge must be adorned in solemn attire, their majesty arrayed, standing before, behind, to the left, and right of us, receiving the words from our mouths. They shall distinguish and transmit the memorial, ensuring its passage to the True Officials of this very prefecture, county, township, and hamlet who govern qi, overseeing the inspection and summons of the Earth Gods of the communities and hamlets, the Two Mysteries, Three Origins, Four Beginnings, and all Jiazi Officials of the seventy-two bureaus in the four directions and positions. Through the Three Officials’ summons, may they jointly ascend our petition, presenting it to the Supreme and Boundless Great Dao, the Divine Sovereign of the Dao Within the Dao, the Jade Emperor, the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Venerable One, the Primordial Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Celestial Masters, the Heir Masters, the Lineage Masters, the Female Masters, the Three Masters, the Gatekeepers, Scribes, and Lesser Clerks of the Masters’ Courts, who attend to the affairs of the memorials.

We, on behalf of [Name], a male/female official or disciple of this prefecture, county, township, and hamlet, prostrate ourselves to present this memorial, seeking to resolve the Primordial Hour of Destiny, unravel the nets of karmic entanglement, extricate from the cycles of life and death, extend longevity, transform the body, and dissolve calamities. A single memorial, written in connected sheets, lies revealed upon the white altar in the central courtyard of this oratory. May the attending officials deign to bestow their divine attention and governance.

We bow our heads to the ground, entrusting our faith in this memorial as prescribed by ritual. We open the case and reverently read it aloud for celestial hearing.

Next, we read the memorial, then dispatch it, knocking our teeth twelve times.

We now solemnly command the Direct Attendants, the Orthodox Unity Clerks, and the Lesser Scribes of the Five Agents within our bodies to array themselves in solemn attire, their caps adorned with hanging tassels, heads crowned with luminous jade, waists girded with Dragon Abyss Swords and multicolored sashes, brushes tucked behind their ears, holding writing boards. They shall promptly take up the Primordial Hour of Destiny, the connected-sheet memorial, and the accompanying documents, ascending to the Three Celestial Courts of the Supreme, and on this very day, proceed to the designated court and palace, presenting the memorial in accordance with its contents, distinguishing matters to be reported to the Most High Lord Lao, the Celestial Masters, the Heir Masters, the Lineage Masters, the Female Masters, the Two Masters, and the various lords, generals, and clerks of the Black Gate.

We humbly reflect that, though our persons are lowly and our bones base, by the fortune of fate’s convergence, we have been permitted to serve within the registers of governance. Yet our ears and eyes are obstructed, and in dispatching clerks and soldiers, errors may arise, our words disordered. We beseech the Yin-Yang Spirit Adjudicators, the Clerks of the Four Bureaus, the Memorial-Transmitting Scribes, and the Lesser Clerks of Practice to take up Dragon-Headed Writing Knives and long, sharp brushes, correcting omissions, amending errors, and ensuring no missteps cause the attending officials to reprimand or reject our petition.

Should any subordinate officials, malevolent qi spirits, or demonic thieves intercept or sever the memorial’s text, preventing its ascent, seize them and consign them to the local prison, where they shall be punished according to the statutes of the Mysterious Capital. Let our petition proceed directly to the presence of the Supreme Unbounded Great Dao, without delay or obstruction. The Left Lord shall pass through the barriers in sequence, while the Right Clerks shall present the memorial in order, ensuring no omission or leakage, sealing the qi to ascend. We prostrate ourselves, awaiting the report.

Next, we press our foreheads to the earth, visualizing the memorial ascending clearly, until the attending officials and lords have received it in full. Then, we withdraw the memorial.

Once the rite of offering and the jiao liturgy are concluded, the Merit-Officials and all attending lords who emerged from our bodies shall re-enter through the Gates of Myriad Mysteries—those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right—each resuming their palaces, coiling about our bodies and entwining our bones, pervading heaven and earth, safeguarding the hundred meridians, ensuring no misalignment. When summoned forth again, they shall emerge precisely as before.

Next, the hymn of sending forth the deities (not recited during non-jiao rites):

*Swiftly ride the Five Emperors’ chariots,*
*Softly plow the Seven Lords’ fields.*
*Radiance streams down to the mat,*
*Feast and banquet respond to crimson sincerity.*
*Petitions resound, all-pervading,*
*From death’s fall to life’s ascent.*
*The Southern Palace augments our years,*
*The Northern Dipper records our longevity.*
*Transgressions and calamities dissolve,*
*Fortune’s blessings bring eternal peace.*
*As rites of gratitude conclude,*
*The gods ascend back to the Great Clarity.*

Next, the libation is dispersed.

Next, the universal reproach text:

Now that the jiao sacrifice is complete and the divine carriages have ascended, may the lingering fragrance of blessings universally bestow their reproachful grace. We summon the disciples’ nine generations of ancestors, their fathers and mothers, and the seven generations of departed kin to partake fully in this offering. Also, the true officials of the Left Altar and Right Millet, the city gods, the local deities, the eight divisions of attendants, the Merit-Officials, clerks, and soldiers, the standard-bearing warriors, the household deities of this dwelling—may all sweetly receive the jiao rites. The Three Generals Guarding the House, the Twelve Divine Generals, the Twenty-Four Warden-Officials, the Gate Sergeants, the Door Commandants, the household-guarding clerks and soldiers, and the Turtle-Spirit Officials—may all feast and drink to satiation. Thereafter, arrayed with us, they shall guard the household, ensuring no disaster crosses the threshold, no plague enters the door, and no demonic spirits or thieving ghosts dare approach. The covenant’s true dharma is not to be taken lightly. Should they faithfully guard and merit promotion for their blessings and aid in goodness, on the three auspicious assembly days, they shall be elevated together with the memorial. They must not slacken, but be disciplined according to the law, as under the Ordinance of the Celestial Master.

Next, invoke the Incense-Official Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the various Attending Incense Spirits: on this occasion of setting up the jiao-offering at the original destiny’s site, naturally arise golden liquors and cinnabar-green mushroom blossoms. Let the host of perfected ones and the hundred spirits convene here before the incense burner. May so-and-so’s entire household receive blessings, and may the world be covered in grace.

Let the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions stand guard, transmitting the incense smoke’s memorial, conveying the foregoing words directly to the Most Perfect and Boundless Jade Sovereign of the Highest Dao in his imperial presence.

Next, disperse the assembly with a hymn of praise:

The Three Luminaries shine most brightly,
Heaven and Earth remain ever serene.
Humankind dwells within them,
Fortune and emolument follow fate’s threads.
Punishment and execution meet their destined junctures,
Sickness and calamity await their appointed years.
Thus do crooked ghosts stealthily approach,
Lurking near blessings and transgressions alike.
The wise turn to the Great Dao,
Cultivating sincerity in the Five Fields of Blessing.
Proclaiming this below, may all disperse,
And may lifespans extend long and far.
May the seven ancestors all find peace,
And may the imprisoned and stricken alike receive absolution.
Emerging from the oratory, bow and offer praise,
That fragrant virtue may gather before the Emperor.

Next, exit the chamber with this incantation:
From yin to yang, the myriad spirits open the way.
With affairs at the passes concluded, now seal the Yellow Chamber.
Let the jade maidens guarding the oratory
Brightly prepare the divine palace.
Standing in attendance to left and right,
May the myriad spirits silently settle.

The *Complete Rites of the Original Destiny’s Petition-Offering* (Upper Scroll) concludes here.
The *Complete Rites of the Original Destiny’s Petition-Offering* (Lower Scroll):
Dissolving Disasters of the Original Destiny, Natal Destiny, Womb-Generated Destiny, and Annual Destiny

It is said: So-and-so’s natal destiny, annual destiny, and the two months of womb-generated destiny all fall upon the *wu*-destiny, where they encounter various inauspicious stellar configurations—celestial executioners, the baleful net of the heavens—whether through self-inflicted harm or mutual affliction. For each, invoke their child-spirits to harmonize and resolve these conflicts, uniting with protective spirits to ensure no further misfortune.

Next, the method of dissolution:

**Stem Sequence:**
Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui.

**Baleful Spirits:**
Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui, Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji.

**Child-Spirits:**
Bing, Ding, Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui, Jia, Yi.

**Uniting Spirits:**
Wu, Ji, Geng, Xin, Ren, Gui, Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding.

The above yin and yang stems are each matched with the twelve earthly branches.

**Branch Sequence:**
Zi, Chou, Yin, Mao, Chen, Si, Wu, Wei, Shen, You, Xu, Hai.

**Baleful Spirits:**
Chen-Xu, Mao, Shen, You, Yin, Hai, Zi, Mao, Wu, Si, Yin, Chou-Wei.

**Child-Spirits:**
Yin, You, Wu, Si, Shen, Chou, Wei, Chen-Xu, You, Zi, Hai, Shen, Mao.

**Uniting Spirits:**
Chou, Zi, Hai, Xu, You, Shen, Wei, Wu, Si, Chen, Mao, Yin.

The above yin and yang branches, paired with the ten celestial stems, form the Six Jia. When baleful influences are identified, select their child and uniting spirits.

For example: If the natal destiny is Jia-Zi, the baleful influence lies in Geng-Chen. Invoke the child-spirit Bing-Yin (so-and-so) and the uniting spirit Ji-Chou (so-and-so).

**First:** For the Jia natal destiny, if the baleful influence resides in [X], respectfully invoke the child-spirit [so-and-so], with their attendant officials (number unspecified), to harmonize and resolve the self-inflicted disasters, dissolving all baleful stellar configurations, myriad calamities, and malevolent harms encountered upon the natal destiny. May so-and-so embody the primordial qi of earth, nurturing life and nature.

Also invoke the uniting spirit [so-and-so], with their attendant officials (number unspecified), to protect the natal destiny and ensure no further misfortune.

**Second:** For so-and-so’s original destiny, if the baleful influence resides in [X], respectfully invoke the child-spirit [so-and-so], with their attendant officials (number unspecified), to harmonize and resolve the self-inflicted harms, following the example of the natal destiny. Dissolve the baleful influences upon the original destiny. May so-and-so contain jade fragrance and exhale jade nectar, preserving the original essence and extending the lifespan to its destined end. Also invoke the uniting spirit [as above] to protect the original destiny and ensure no further misfortune.

**Third:** For the womb month, follow the same example. Dissolve the baleful influences, that the womb month may exhale harmonious qi to nurture the womb’s primordial essence. Also invoke the uniting spirit [as above].

**Fourth:** For the birth month, proceed as above. Dissolve the baleful influences, that the birth month may exhale harmonious qi to nurture the birth’s primordial essence. Also invoke the uniting spirit [as above].

**Fifth:** For the annual destiny, proceed as before. Dissolve the baleful influences, that the annual destiny may exhale primordial qi to sustain the suspended lifespan. Also invoke the uniting spirit [as above].

**Sixth:** For the annual destiny’s original destiny, proceed as above. Dissolve the baleful influences, that the annual destiny’s original destiny may exhale realgar and contain jade fragrance, preserving the annual destiny’s essence and delivering it from perilous calamities. Also invoke the uniting spirit [as above] to protect the annual destiny’s original destiny and ensure no further misfortune.

The above outlines the dissolution of the natal destiny, womb-generated destiny, and annual destiny. The intricacies within are matters of great skill.

Next, the return of the spirits:
Respectfully invite so-and-so’s natal destiny spirit [so-and-so], along with the original destiny spirit, womb-month spirit, birth-month spirit, annual destiny spirit, and annual destiny’s original destiny spirit, each to return to so-and-so’s body, serving as guardian spirits to defend the form, adhering to the palaces and chambers, dispelling misfortune and harm, pacifying the spirit and the inner child, preventing any waywardness.

If residing in illness, also invoke this year’s spirit [so-and-so]. For example, in the year Jia-Zi, invoke Wang Wenqing of Jia-Zi, with eighteen officials arrayed according to the year’s sequence. Request their chariot: Wu or Wei for the Vermilion Bird, or the Dark Warrior’s mount. If the year falls in Hai or Zi, or Chou, let the Dark Warrior mount the Vermilion Bird. Holding acupuncture needles and medicines, mouth containing realgar and exhaling jade fragrance—or said to hold jade fragrance and exhale jade nectar—descend together to so-and-so’s household, entering so-and-so’s body to heal all afflictions. From head to foot, left to right, encircle the body, weaving through the hundred vessels, harmonizing the five viscera, and suddenly dispelling all ailments.

Preserve this year through to the coming one, or said to extend until the next. Dissolve all baleful influences—malign spirits, venomous toxins, calamities, and lingering spectral afflictions—causing them to disperse entirely. Support the frail, carry them through peril, and ensure no harm befalls them.

Next, for so-and-so’s natal year and its associated branch-stem pairing, count forward from the natal spirit to determine the eight spirits governing *dead qi*. Invoke the *living qi* salvation spirits, counting backward from so-and-so’s natal spirit to find the eight spirits governing *living qi*. With a retinue of so many officials, present offerings and submit the ritual petition, ascending to the Celestial Emperor of so-and-so’s palace and the corresponding deities. Identify the Twenty-Eight Constellations under which the natal year falls, along with the names of the Celestial Emperor and his officials. Align the stars and measure the lodges to dissolve misfortune, ascending to the Lord of so-and-so’s Mansion and the Sovereign of the Palace of the Celestial Emperor of that branch. Inscribe the realm of *undying qi*: Jia-Yi as Lesser Yang, Bing-Ding as Greater Yang, Geng-Xin as Lesser Yin, Ren-Gui as Greater Yin, and Wu-Ji as the Central Palace. The palaces are: Hai-Zi as the Northern Palace, Yin-Mao as the Eastern Palace, Si-Wu as the Southern Palace, Shen-You as the Western Palace, and Chen-Xu-Chou-Wei as the Central Palace—all derived from the natal branch-stem. For so-and-so, trade names and transform form, excising the *dead qi* of so-and-so’s sequence of eight spirits. Transfer the name into the register of the living, prolonging life without end.

For example, one born in the Jia-Zi year has *dead qi* in Xin-Wei. The *living qi* salvation spirit is Ding-Si Cui Juqing, with ten attending officials, ascending to the Primordial Radiance Celestial Emperor of the Upper Prime Palace. Align the stars and measure the lodges to dissolve misfortune, ascending to the Lord of the Non-Birth Mansion, Qi Tong, and inscribing the realm of *undying qi*, specifically the Lesser Yang of the Northern Palace. For so-and-so, trade names and transform form, excising the *dead qi* of Xin-Wei and transferring residence into the register of the living, prolonging life without end. This single example suffices; the rest may be inferred accordingly.

Next, the names of the Six Jia spirits and their attending officials:
- Jia and Ji, in Zi and Wu: nine officials
- Yi and Geng, in Chou and Wei: eight officials
- Bing and Xin, in Yin and Shen: seven officials
- Ding and Ren, in Mao and You: six officials
- Wu and Gui, in Chen and Xu: five officials

The names of the Six Jia spirits for each sixty-year cycle and their attending officials are as above. For each individual, determine the corresponding spirits and protective deities based on their natal year, current age, gestational month, birth month, and natal branch-stem, then invoke them by name.

Next, dispelling disasters according to the Five Tones:

For a surname whose tone belongs to *Jue* (Wood), its baleful influence lies in the West (Metal). Reverently invoke the sixty-four officials of the *Bing-Ding* Eight Man Lords of the South to resolve the *Jue*-tone palace of this surname and expel the destined calamity of the Western Palace.

Dispel disasters, avert misfortune, pacify the heart and settle the mind, disperse all baleful influences, and resolve the inauspicious palaces of the Absolute Fate and Five Ghosts, causing them to submit and harmonize, thereby extinguishing the *qi* of ghosts.

Next, entering the invocation:

Next, consoling and instructing the Five Viscera in accordance with the Five Phases and the Four Seasons.

This spring, Wood reigns supreme, and the liver-viscus receives its *qi*. The generative *qi* circulates in cycles, exhaling and inhaling through the Purple Mansion. The fountain of life flows as a spring, surging with the tides of vital fluids. May the emissaries of the Purple Tenuity Palace bring warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. Its source emerges upward through the two eyes and returns downward to the flanks. Seal the central chamber with utmost secrecy, aligning with the seasons and responding to their rhythms, until merit is accomplished and the Dao attains peace. Then transmit this to the heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, connecting the liver in due succession.

The fountain of life flows as a spring, bound to the tides of vital fluids. May the emissaries of the Crimson Palace bring warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. Its source emerges upward through the lips and mouth and returns downward to the heart’s center.

Then transmit this to the spleen, lungs, kidneys, and liver, connecting the heart in due succession.

This autumn, Metal reigns supreme, and the lung-viscus receives its dark *qi*. The generative *qi* circulates in cycles, exhaling and inhaling through the Pristine Mansion. The fountain of life flows as a spring, bound to the tides of vital fluids. May the emissaries of the Florid Canopy Palace bring warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. Its source emerges upward through the cheeks and jaw and returns downward to the lung’s center. Seal the central chamber with utmost secrecy, aligning with the seasons and responding to their rhythms, until merit is accomplished and the Dao attains peace. Then transmit this to the kidneys, liver, heart, and spleen, connecting the lungs in due succession.

The fountain of life flows as a spring, bound to the tides of vital fluids. May the emissaries of the Twin Convergence Palace bring warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. Its source emerges upward through the two ears and returns downward to the Jade Sea. Seal the central chamber with utmost secrecy, aligning with the seasons and responding to their rhythms, until merit is accomplished and the Dao attains peace. Then transmit this to the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs, connecting the kidneys in due succession.

This late season of the four phases, when Earth reigns supreme, the spleen-viscus receives its *qi*. The generative *qi* circulates in cycles, exhaling and inhaling through the Earthly Mansion. The fountain of life flows as a spring, bound to the tides of vital fluids. May the emissaries of the Jade Hall Palace bring warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. Its source emerges upward through the mouth and returns downward to the spleen’s center. Seal the central chamber with utmost secrecy, aligning with the seasons and responding to their rhythms, until merit is accomplished and the Dao attains peace.

Transmit this to the late spring, then to the heart, spleen, lungs, kidneys, and liver, connecting them in due succession. For the late summer, transmit to the lungs, kidneys, liver, heart, and spleen, connecting them in due succession. For the late autumn, transmit to the kidneys, liver, heart, spleen, and lungs, connecting them in due succession. For the late winter, transmit to the liver, heart, spleen, lungs, and kidneys, connecting them in due succession.

Another method: For late autumn and late winter, employ warmth, harmony, and pure concentration. For spring and summer, the terms "warmth and harmony" are not required.

Next, invoke the deities of the four seasons:
In spring, invoke the Four Departments’ Radiant Lord;
In summer, the Supreme Tenuity Jade Flower Lord;
In autumn, the Lesser Brilliance Golden Portal Jade Gate Lord;
In winter, the Great Obscurity Profound Darkness Lord.

For this month’s governing spirit, [name], with attendant officials numbering [count].
For this day’s governing spirit, [name], with attendant officials numbering [count].

On *bing* and *xin* days, the first hour begins with *geng-yin*.

In summer, to the Vermilion Jade Lad and Vermilion Jade Maiden;
In autumn, to the White Jade Lad and White Jade Maiden;
In winter, to the Profound Simplicity Great Dawn Jade Lad and Mysterious Mechanism Jade Maiden.
Ensure it is conveyed upward to receive the profound grace.
