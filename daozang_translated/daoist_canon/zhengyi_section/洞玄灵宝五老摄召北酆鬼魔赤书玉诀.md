This Vermilion Writ is the essential requisite for those who study the Dao. Regrettably, its original text is incomplete, and further collation is awaited.

### **The Eightfold Numinous Talismans of the Wondrous Treasure**
When inscribing the *Three Heavens’ Supreme Talisman for Summoning and Subduing Dragons, Tigers, Leopards, and Mountain Spirits* in cinnabar, place it upon a silverwood tablet. Inscribe the year, month, and the master’s surname and given name upon another tablet. Bind the two tablets together and enclose them in a pouch. Inscribe the subsequent text in cinnabar upon a third tablet, attaching it to the exterior of the pouch. Seal the three tablets as a divine talisman, following the transmission’s form. All tablets shall be made of silverwood, fourteen inches in length and two inches four fen in width. The pouch shall be crafted from crimson silk, twelve feet in length. Clothe the talisman within, sealing the outer tablet. At the lower end, impress the seal of the *Primordial Five Elders of the Middle Prime*. Encase it in a cypress box, wrapped in crimson silk, and store the talisman in a separate chamber. Burn incense on both sides, reverently enshrine it, and receive it to wear upon the body. The divine spirits of the world shall attend at the gates morning and evening, with twelve Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Five Thearchs assigned to serve. In all goings and comings, the Five Thearchs shall act as guards, the Three Realms’ administrators shall welcome you, and in life and death, you shall avoid the three evil destinies. You shall bypass Mount Tai, ascend directly to the Nine Heavens, and be clothed and fed by nature. Your rank shall equal that of the Great Ultimate, and you shall attain immortality as you will.

The Daoist who receives and wears this text shall employ the divine incantations. Pointing the talisman toward heaven, the celestial gods shall descend. Pointing it toward earth, the earthly deities shall prostrate themselves, and the Three Realms shall gird themselves in submission. Pointing it toward spirits, they shall pay homage. Pointing it toward ghosts, they shall perish and dissipate. Pointing it toward water, the water spirits shall obey. When great kalpas converge and floods gather from the four directions, summon the dragon with the talisman, and it shall bear you upon its back. Through long cultivation and accumulated resonance, the divine and numinous shall gather. Wherever you summon, they shall arrive at once. A thousand transformations and ten thousand changes shall follow your will. In all goings and comings, your rank shall match the Great Ultimate, with flying dragons leading the way and the Celestial Balance following. Phoenixes shall cry and simurghs shall sing, with twelve radiant banners and the *Twenty-Seven-Colored Standards of Life and Spirit* preceding you. After nine years of concentrated practice, the celestial regalia shall assemble of their own accord.

### **The Eightfold Numinous Incantation of the Wondrous Treasure**
*"Primordial Supreme Perfection, Five Numinous Exalted Ones,
Radiant brilliance of Mount Taihua, luminous clarity of the Eight Gates,
The Five Elders issue their decree—no hidden realm is barred.
Above, they govern the Nine Heavens; at the center, they restrain Mount Feng;
Below, they command rivers and seas, the twelve water sources.
The Eightfold Numinous Incantation, the divine talisman of jade writs,
Summons dragons to bear the waters, gathers qi and assembles clouds,
Binds demons and dispatches ghosts, sweeps away demonic hordes.
Ten thousand spirits are shattered; none escape their doom.
Sun, moon, and the five stars, the Northern Dipper’s seven origins,
All heavens, all earths, all waters, all mountains,
The jade perfected under their command, the great spirits of the netherworld,
The Immortal Kings at their banquets, the Five Thearchs’ subduing banners,
Heavenly Soldiers leading the way, Metal Tigers rushing behind,
Fierce beasts of the Jue Heaven, arrayed at the four gates—
What is called arrives at once; what is summoned stands before you.
The Vermilion Writs blaze forth, wind and fire unobstructed.
Wherever restraint is applied, golden dragons swiftly transmit it."*

Conclude by clicking the teeth nine times, howling thrice toward heaven, drawing in the celestial qi three times, and pointing the talisman toward the designated place. Hold the breath for nine cycles, then cease.

### **The Jade Formulas of the Primordial Five Elders for Quelling Disasters and Seeking Immortality in the Eastern Quarter**
When the Daoist secludes himself to study, he shall inscribe the *True Writ of the Azure Thearch in Vermilion* and place it in the east, whereupon the immortals of the Eastern Marchmount shall arrive. After a hundred days of fasting and concentrated devotion to the *Venerable Numinous Treasure*, the celestial perfected shall descend, assigning nine *Jade Maidens of the Azure Essence* to retrieve the *immortal mushrooms and deathless medicines* of the Eastern Marchmount.

After twenty-four years of fasting and cultivation, one shall attain immortality. Merely wearing this writ shall also enable *corpse liberation* and *transformation into an immortal through the revolving wheel*.

If the land in the east or during the three months of spring suffers calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the eastern quarter, inscribe the text in vermilion upon green stone and place it in the east for nine days.

The ghostly demons of the Yellow Thearch shall flee twelve myriad leagues, and the malevolent beasts and venomous creatures of the central realm shall cease their harmful intent, turning instead to cherish the virtuous. After twenty-four years of fasting and cultivation, one shall attain the body of a divine immortal. Merely wearing this writ shall also enable *shijie*—liberation through simulated death—and transformation into an immortal through the revolving wheel.

Should the central realm or the transitional months of the four seasons suffer calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the Middle Kingdom, inscribe the text in vermilion upon yellow stone and place it in the center for twelve days.

The four quarters shall live in harmony, auspicious omens shall arise spontaneously, qilin shall come to submit, white tigers shall roam the courtyards, the state shall prosper, the people shall flourish, and all under heaven shall enjoy great peace. Wearing the inscribed writ upon the body shall avert all disasters, strengthen the body and vital qi, sharpen the five senses, and perpetually safeguard both household and state, ensuring everlasting prosperity and uprightness.

When the Daoist inscribes the *True Writ of the White Thearch* and places it in the west, the immortals of the Western Marchmount shall arrive.

After a hundred days of strict fasting and meditating upon the sacred *Lingbao* deities, the celestial perfected shall descend, and six maidens of the Grand Simplicity shall be granted to gather the divine *zhi* herbs of immortality from the Western Marchmount.

Should the western realm or the three months of autumn suffer calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the western quarter, inscribe the text in vermilion upon white stone and place it in the west for six days.

The west shall submit of itself, auspicious omens shall come to roam, divine beasts shall soar in flight, golden sparrows shall bear talismans, the Five Elders shall come as guests, the state shall be at peace, and the people shall rest. Wearing the inscribed writ upon the body shall enable communion with divine spirits, avert all disasters, share the same kitchen as the Five Thearchs, and ensure that descendants flourish, enjoying the rank of kings and marquises for generations. With such good karmic conditions, what cause for worry or sorrow remains?

Should the northern realm or the three months of winter suffer calamity, and one wishes to pacify and stabilize the northern quarter, inscribe the text in vermilion upon black stone and place it in the north for five days. The disasters of that region shall dissolve of themselves, and malevolence shall vanish. The north shall submit of itself, auspicious omens shall flourish daily, the treasures of the earth shall be revealed, gold and jade shall manifest, celestial beings shall chant hymns, the state shall be wealthy, and the people shall prosper. Wearing the inscribed writ upon the body shall dispel all disasters, grant a lifespan equal to heaven and earth, ensure everlasting fortune and emolument, and render all endeavors and aspirations upright and propitious. Descendants shall flourish, and generations of sages shall arise.

The Dao teaches: Those who study the supreme Daoist methods and observe the fasts and precepts must meditate upon the spirits and contemplate the Dao, aspiring to the celestial perfected, dispelling demons, and overcoming trials. All must first follow the ancient regulations of the *Lingbao* Upper Primordial, perform the installation of the true writs, and place them in the respective quarters. The divine perfected shall descend into the chamber, the officials and retinue of the Five Thearchs shall guard the gates, ghostly demons shall vanish, and all endeavors shall succeed.

Inscribe the *True Writ of the Azure Thearch* in vermilion upon azure silk and place it on the eastern wall of the chamber. Inscribe the *True Writ of the Vermilion Thearch* in vermilion upon crimson silk and place it on the southern wall. Inscribe the *True Writ of the Yellow Thearch* in vermilion upon yellow silk and place it in the center. Inscribe the *True Writ of the White Thearch* in vermilion upon white silk and place it on the western wall. Inscribe the *True Writ of the Black Thearch* in vermilion upon black silk and place it on the northern wall. Install these five writs within the fasting hall, burn incense morning and evening, and pay homage in the respective directions. No profane or heterodox persons may enter the hall. Each writ possesses its own mighty spirits, with jade lads and jade maidens in attendance. To violate these writs is to invite indictment before the Nine Heavens, where dark punishments shall be meted out immediately. Those who uphold them must clearly observe the prohibitions.

Within the Azure Heaven of the Nine Qi resides the Primordial Azure Lad of the Origin, whose taboo name is Kaiyang Qing. He oversees the *True Writ of the Azure Thearch* inscribed in vermilion.

Those who study the Dao should meditate upon this spirit descending into their own body. After a hundred days of focused contemplation, the divine perfected shall manifest in form, and all prayers shall be swiftly answered. Those who wear the true writ shall find this lad ever present within their liver palace, bestowing the essence of the green sprout.

These Five Thearch Lads of the Divine Perfected are born coeval with the Primordial Five Elders. They govern the five scrolls of the true writ, above commanding the qi of the Nine Heavens, below presiding over the Five Peaks, and within mastering the five viscera. They draw forth the essence of the five sprouts to nourish the human body. Those who consume the five sprouts yet remain ignorant of these spirits shall labor in vain, their efforts yielding no response.
