**The Scripture of the Dao/Way on Nurturing the Primordial Qi for Longevity**
**Annotated by Master Lang of the Wild**

The Master said: *"He who knows the Supreme Dao/Way is not cut off by Heaven, he who cultivates the Primordial Qi is not extinguished by Earth."* The Supreme Dao/Way is not distant; it lies within one’s own body. With a refined and subtle mind, life will endure.

Master Liu’s *Secret Teachings* (秘旨) state: *"To attain Longevity, one must cultivate that which gives birth to it."* The method of cultivation begins with the subtle refinement of Qi. When Qi coalesces into form, form becomes the foundation of receiving Qi, while Qi is the root origin of form. By observing how the Primordial Qi nourishes form, one may discern the principle of form’s dissolution.

The Scripture says: *"Deep-rooted and firmly established, the Dao/Way of Longevity and enduring vision."* The Primordial Qi is the root foundation of the body. If one firmly establishes the Primordial Qi, the Dao/Way of Longevity will naturally unfold.

Within the form, there are the *yin* and *yang* (子母), why not guard them? For, the Qi serves as the *yin* (母) of the Spirit, while the Spirit is the *yang* (子) of the Qi. The *yang* (子) arises from the Qi of breathing, hence it is called the *yin* (母). Once the Qi of form is established, the Spirit emerges, thus the Spirit is called the *yang* (子).

The Qi of breathing originates from the *Mysterious Female* (玄牝) [i.e., the lower *Dantian*]. The nostrils govern the intake of pure, *yang* Qi, while the mouth governs the exhalation of impure, *yin* Qi.

To practice cultivation, one must first extinguish all thoughts, sever external concerns, and internally safeguard the True Spirit. Before each session of cultivation, one must first harmonize the Qi.

The method of harmonizing Qi is as follows: subtly inhale through the nostrils to draw in the pure, *yang* Qi, and subtly exhale through the mouth to release the impure, *yin* Qi. After ten or twenty breaths, close the mouth and allow the Spirit-Qi to flow continuously in and out without effort.

The Qi inhaled through the nostrils should be imagined as descending to the *Primordial Pearl* (玄珠) of the lower *Dantian*, enveloping and merging in all directions. Then, regard the *Primordial Pearl* as the sovereign of the lower *Dantian*. Do not allow any extraneous thoughts to arise, for such thoughts will disrupt the process. With persistent practice, the Qi will naturally condense into a pearl, and this is the *yin* (母).

Once the *yin* (母) is established, the *yang* (子) will naturally follow. The speed of attainment depends on one’s resolve. Do not dwell on external matters; focus the mind solely on the Spirit. Swiftly achieve Longevity, and the goal is attained.

When the Spirit and Qi unite, guide them with intention, circulating through the viscera and bowels, riding the breath upward and downward. With prolonged practice, the Spirit will grow luminous and the Qi harmonious, illuminating the Five Zang Organs.

After mastering the subtle techniques, one may internally perceive the True Spirit. When the Qi is harmonized and fully permeates the Four Limbs, it moves according to the will and can also heal others’ ailments.

The Yellow Emperor cultivated internal vision for three months and thereby gave birth to the Spirit. The Spirit of the Heart then transforms and generates, weaving through the Five Zang Organs. These words may be extrapolated to reveal their meaning.

The Yellow Emperor attained this secret and, after three months of internal vision, his Spirit was complete. Thus, he was born from Heaven.

Liezi attained it after nine years and thereby became enlightened. The swiftness or delay depends on one’s resolve.

The Primordial Qi follows the will; stillness brings its attainment. When the Qi flows freely through the Dao/Way, the body naturally grows strong. The *Primordial Pearl* is the sovereign, and the Spirit becomes luminous.

In the present age, people allow the Spirit and Qi—*yin* and *yang*—to move independently, neither guarding the other. Although they breathe internally, their Spirit is constantly expended externally. Such methods only cause the Primordial Qi to scatter and lose its sovereign power, for if it does not flow fully, the Essence will dissipate.

Moreover, people regard the Spirit as the master and the form as the dwelling. If the master does not tend to the dwelling but instead is always occupied externally, the dwelling will inevitably become empty and the body decay. As for the methods of this age, within the hundred *ke* (刻) of day and night, the Qi within the form totals thirteen thousand five hundred breaths, amounting to eighty-one thousand inches in length. All of these breaths exhaust the Spirit-Qi externally, leaving none to reside within, so how can one hope for Longevity?

The Master said: *"If the Spirit-Qi governs the circulation of the *yin* and *yang*, then one attains Longevity and immortality. If there is no sovereign control, and one merely follows natural breathing, the Qi will only serve to nourish the viscera and digest food, unable to return the *yin* to the *yang* or replenish the blood and marrow."*

By attaining this method of breathing cultivation, the Primordial Qi condenses into an embryo. Within the embryo lies the Spirit, which preserves the Primordial Qi. If one has not yet attained this secret, the Qi will lack sovereign control, and all efforts will be in vain. One will only exhaustively practice breathing without penetrating to the root of receiving Qi, and the Primordial Qi will disperse among the Four Limbs, causing the flesh and skin to wither.

The Master said: *"I regard the Spirit as the chariot and the Qi as the horse, driving them ceaselessly throughout the day without fatigue."* Always imagine the Spirit and Primordial Qi as united, moving according to the will without ceasing, hence they are called the chariot and the horse.

He also said: *"When the Spirit drives the Qi, the nostrils do not lose their breath."* His words are profound!

The Spirit resides within the *Primordial Pearl*. It constantly governs the Primordial Qi in each inhalation and exhalation, always internally perceiving the True Spirit. Hence, it is called the sovereign control, uniting the Spirit and Qi so that the nostrils never lose their breath.

The method of driving the Qi extends from the *Nihuan* (泥丸) [upper *Dantian*] to the *Mingmen* (命门) [lower *Dantian*]. The *Nihuan* is located in the brain, serving as the upper *Dantian*. The *Mingmen* is three inches below the navel; the *Huangting Scripture* (黄庭经) states: *"Behind lies the secret door, before the birth gate."* It is near the end of the lumbar spine, thus identifying the lower *Dantian*.

The Supreme Dao/Way of the Immortal Scriptures now reveals the *leakage* [of Qi], inspired by this teaching. The two *Dantian*s [upper and lower] are like lotuses in communion, capable of rescuing the aged and infirm.

When the Primordial Qi of the lower *Dantian* is fully nurtured, it ascends in reverse, entering the *Nihuan* [upper *Dantian*]. This is called *Returning the Essence to Nourish the Marrow* (还精补脑), hence the saying: *"The two *Dantian*s are in communion."*

If one cannot inhale with the Spirit as sovereign, not a single breath is complete. If one cannot exhale with the Spirit as sovereign, not a single breath is complete. If the Spirit and Qi are constantly united within each breath, then the Spirit and Qi are fully preserved.

The cultivation of *Qi* begins with its emission as breath. Inhalation is taken through the nostrils, imagined to reach the Primordial Pearl (*Xuanzhu*) of the lower *Dantian*, where it unites with the Spirit.

Only when the mind and abdomen are pure, and the eyes observe the breath, can one in meditation perceive the true Spirit and thus achieve a complete breath. If the gaze wanders and external thoughts arise, the Spirit follows the will outward, seeing only external matters, and the internal *Qi* fails to govern—this is called an incomplete breath.

Moreover, it is said: *"The embryo forms from the gathering of *Qi* within the abdomen. *Qi* within the embryo breathes."* If the embryo is formed internally, one cannot seek death. When *Qi* gathers within the embryo, it breathes—this is the meaning of *Returning the Essence* (返覆).

By inhaling through the nostrils and sending *Qi* down with the intention, prolonged practice will naturally condense and form the embryo. The embryo is formed from the gathering of Primordial *Qi*, and within it, *Qi* breathes—though this breath is imperceptible.

The child is like the Spirit, and the person is like one initially receiving the embryo, gradually taking form.

The Immortal Scriptures state: *"After success, men close the *Guanyuan* [Gate of Origin] to gather *Jing* [Essence], while women’s *Tai* [embryo] and *Ze* [Sea] do not form the fetus."* Though moved by desire, one cannot contend with the Spirit—this is the embryo’s true essence, the *Returning of Essence* as Spirit. This is the *Shangqing* [Upper Clarity].

The key to self-cultivation lies in mastering the interplay of *Yin* and *Yang*, uniting their true nature. Every night, after midnight and before the fifth watch (when sleep first comes), first use the tongue to rinse and cleanse between the lips and teeth, expelling three mouthfuls of turbid saliva. Then inhale through the nose the pure, cold *Qi*, drawing it into the chest and diaphragm. Expel three to five mouthfuls of stale *Qi* that has accumulated from the previous day, and after a while, swallow.

When lying down, stretch out both hands and feet, strike the teeth nine times, then follow the usual method of inhaling and exhaling, though not too deeply. Wait until the breathing *Qi* is even, neither leaving the body nor entering from outside. Close the *Qi*, swallow the Primordial *Qi* once, and with the hands, guide the *Qi* downward as you massage, drawing it to the *Qi* Sea (*Qihai*). After twenty days, when the *Qi* flows smoothly, add one swallow. After two months, add another, until one swallow suffices for three breaths. After a year, one swallow suffices for four breaths—no harm will come from this.

Each day, after the child hour (*Zi*) and before noon (*Wu*), swallow on an empty stomach. At other times, swallow ten or five breaths, but never inhale external *Qi*. Before the child hour and after noon, swallowing is forbidden.

The *Classics* say: *"After the child hour and before noon all belong to *Yang*; before the child hour and after noon is called *Yin*."*

For those who cultivate the *root of rest* (*Xugen*), at mealtime, rinse the mouth and imagine two streams of white *Qi* emerging from the upper *Dantian*, as thick as cloth strips, flowing down the neck to the spine, entering the *Qi* Sea below the navel. Gradually gather the *Qi* until it is the size of a goose egg, a fragrant cluster, naturally dispelling hunger. Avoid distractions, lest the nature be disordered.

For illness such as dry mouth, sticky tongue, or throat obstruction, these are signs of extreme heat in the upper burner (*Shangjiao*). At the fifth watch, inhale through the nose the pure, cold *Qi* into the chest and diaphragm, then expel it through the mouth three to five dozen times, or even a hundred or two. Gradually, one will feel sweetness in the mouth—this is the heat dispersing. Then cease, but do not overdo it.

If the *Water* (*Shui*) is cold, at dawn, inhale through the nose to block *Yang* *Qi*, and exhale through the mouth a hundred or so breaths of clear *Qi*. For any painful ailments—whether from snake venom, bites, or injuries by wolves or dogs—simply sit or lie still, close the *Qi*, and focus the intention. Direct the *Qi* to attack the afflicted area for a hundred or two repetitions, and all will heal.

In winter, for cold feet (*Ling*), swallow the hot *Qi* and imagine it flowing down to the soles, warming them before ceasing.

If one drinks alcohol and suffers from intoxication, simply expel through the mouth the toxic force (*Du*) that arises with the vessel’s rotation, and one will not become drunk.

*Chi* *Shui* refers to saliva; *Xuanzhu* refers to *Qi*; *Qi* is the Spirit.

When practicing, face north or south while seated, upright and eyes closed. With the gaze, imagine the lower *Dantian*—three inches below the navel, within the space of the two kidneys, three inches wide—where the *Qi* is green on the left, yellow on the right, white above, and red below, with *Qi* itself being crimson within.

The oral formula says:
*"Great as a bullet, yellow as an orange, with radiant flame,
Above—one crimson child, named *Yuanxian*, styled *Dijing*;
Middle—one True Person, named *Zidan*, styled *Guangjian*;
Below—one infant, named *Yuanyang*, styled *Guyuan*.
Each Spirit-body is three inches long,
Wearing crimson robes and shoes,
Seated on a golden throne,
Holding a golden censer and jade ladle.
By day, they reside in the upper *Dantian*;
By night, they dwell in the lower *Dantian*.
This is the *Yindan* [Embryonic Elixir] of seven returns—
Water, saliva, blood, essence, marrow, and *Qi* of the brain."*

To nourish the Spirit, one must first nourish the *Qi*;
To nourish the *Qi*, one must first nourish the brain;
To nourish the brain, one must first nourish the essence;
To nourish the essence, one must first nourish the blood;
To nourish the blood, one must first nourish the saliva;
To nourish the saliva, one must first nourish the water.

Water is the five-flavored essence of saliva,
The refined essence of the five tastes,
Located beneath the tongue, beside the two teeth,
Called the *Water Pool* (*Shuichi*).

When swallowed into the lung’s channel, it transforms into saliva;
When saliva enters the heart’s channel, it becomes blood;
When blood, after two hundred and fifty days, enters the kidney’s channel, it turns into essence;
When essence enters the brain’s channel, it forms the *Nihuan* [Embryonic Palace].

Within the palace are two channels,
Flowing beside the spine downward into the *Heihai* [Black Sea].
The Black Sea’s sovereign is clarity and wisdom.

The True Person says:
*"The Immortal’s greatest taboo is anger;
Do not recklessly leak words.
The wise ruler keeps this secret."*

**Guiding and Pulling Formula:**
Clasp the hands as if washing the face, then rub them together until they are warm, wiping the face until the skin wrinkles. Like a warrior drawing a stiff bow, pull left and right three times. Clench the fists and strike forward and backward several times, then lift both hands upward as if supporting a thousand-pound stone, alternating left and right.

Sit upright, fists clenched, and lean the body sideways like a mountain being pushed aside, alternating left and right. Slowly extend the fists forward, then swiftly retract them backward.

The **Running Embrace of the Head** is called the *Chouguan* [Drawing the Lock] technique.
Clench both fists against the earth, curl the body and arch the spine, raising and lowering the fists three times. Each time, return to strike the back three times. Sit upright, extend the legs, and with hands crossed behind, pull backward several times. Stand, cross the hands at the waist, and twist the body backward three times.

Warm the palms and rub them over the soles of the feet and knees. Without rising, cross the arms behind the neck and strain with force several times. Stretch and extend, then retract and shake to open the *bai guan* [hundred passages].

Warm the palms again, cover the eyes, and draw them forward to the ears, rotating the ears thirty times—practice this often. Warm the palms, press the sides of the nose, close the eyes, and breathe. When *qi* flows freely, stop.

The True Person says:
*"At the time of longevity, before noon, swallow the saliva seven times, close the eyes, and sit levelly. Internally visualize the five *zàng* [solid organs] and six *fǔ* [hollow organs].*
If practiced diligently over time, clarity will naturally arise.

When first practicing the *Heihai* [Black Sea], one must focus on what the ears hear and what the mind thinks. Gradually, this arises with three breaths, five breaths, and a slow exhalation. If one stops at twelve breaths without exhaling, minor harmony is achieved. If one stops at one hundred twenty breaths without exhaling, great harmony is attained.

During fasting and rest, cultivate the sun and moon within the mouth: by day, cultivate the sun; by night, cultivate the moon. They are as large as a ring—the sun’s color is red, with a purple nine-rayed light; the moon’s color is yellow, with a white ten-rayed light.

Cultivate the sun and moon within the *Mingtang* [Hall of Light]: the sun on the left, the moon on the right. Always cultivate the *ke* [essence] of the sun and moon’s rays as a black liquid, like sleeping with the sun on the forehead and the moon beneath the navel. If the body feels uneasy, press the tongue against the throat, swallow the saliva several times, then rest.

Where the *Heihai* resides, follow the birth of the *shen* [spirit]. When the spirit is present, the *Heihai* forms; when the spirit departs, the *Heihai* becomes empty.

The *Heihai* is the true *qi* of the twenty-four spirits. The *Heihai* forms the spirit, and the spirit forms the *Heihai*.

When the *Heihai* disperses, it becomes mist; when it condenses, it becomes form and shadow. Externally, it transforms into an Immortal; internally, it transforms into the True One. Above, it binds the *San Yuan* [Three Origins]; below, it binds all things, cultivating the *Yi Zhen Jun* [One True Venerable].

Recite the invocation while closing the eyes: Cultivate all hundred spirits into white *Heihai*, like a *yin* [female] emerging from the *Xuan Zhu* [Mysterious Pearl] through the *jing kong* [passage], entering my mouth. After lingering, feel the white *Heihai* descend through the *jing kong*, exit the soles of the feet, the feet’s center, and the *guan lian* [crown of the head], permeating the entire body with the white *Heihai* for a long time. The white *Heihai* suddenly transforms into purple clouds, lingering before entering my mouth, descending into the head, filling the five *zàng*, and saturating the abdomen. It then exits through the soles of the feet and palms, descending to the *jing kong* and *guan lian*. The body lingers as the purple clouds merge, and the form becomes indistinct.

After a moment, again cultivate the purple *Heihai* filling the left and right chambers. Then visualize *feng qi* [wind *qi*] emerging from the mouth, fanning the purple clouds until they swirl and form a True Person—a male figure three inches tall, named *Dadong Di Yi Zun Jun* [Great Cavern Emperor, One Venerable Lord].

Again, visualize the Venerable Lord entering my mouth beneath the tongue, ascending to the *Zifang Gong* [Purple Chamber Palace] within the *Liu He* [Six Harmonies]. He sits facing outward, holding the *Zhao* [Manifestation] of the Five *Ji* [Records] in his left hand and the Five *Fu* [Symbols] in his right. On the left side of his mouth shines the sun’s nine-rayed light; on the right, the moon’s lingering light—sometimes white, sometimes red. The luminous *Heihai* descends into the five *zàng*, six *fǔ*, and hundred joints, filling the body like the sun. Recite the incantation with the heart:

*"Great Cavern Emperor One,
Too Subtle and Venerable,
Father Serene, Mother Still,
Two merging, dual unity,
Hundred Truths in great chaos,
One return, nature born,
Body binds the Eight *Yin*,
Transforming into the Primordial Infant,
Sun and moon’s precious light,
Moving my form,
Taiyi above,
Willing to align with the Emperor,
Nihuan’s precious jade,
Five *zàng* radiant,
Long united with sun and moon,
Holding the Cavern Scripture,
Standing as the Immortal Lord,
Spirit ascending to Shangqing,
Thirty-nine youths,
Fully corresponding to the Yu Ting [Jade Court]."*

Always cultivate the *Dadong Di Yi Zun Jun* within the upper lip, beneath the nose, and between the inner and outer teeth. In sitting, standing, or moving, keep this in mind. The Venerable Lord’s mouth holds the sun and moon, illuminating the ten thousand caverns.

Before practicing *qi*, first cultivate the candle flame in the heart, burning through the body above and below, dispelling the *qi* toxins of the five grains. If not burned, cold will cling; if burned too long, it will cause agitation. After cultivating the flame, begin *qi* practice without distraction. Let the *qi* flow subtly—it will naturally permeate. Guide it with intention.

To practice the *qi* method, first reduce food intake gradually—do not do so abruptly. After a year, the *qi* will be full, and hunger will naturally vanish.

The six *shen* of the kidneys are:
*Siji* [Master of Ceremonies], *Silu* [Recorder], *Siming* [Master of Fate], *Sili* [Supervisor], *Xiaowei* [Marshal], and *Qing* [Minister].
Left and right, they divide into eight hundred fifty.

The *jingling* [precise and numinous] *qi* of the sun and moon is the root of humanity. The left is the *Xuuanmiao Jun* [Mysterious and Subtle Lord], the right the *Xuuan Yuan Jun* [Primordial Lord].

The *Xuuan* and *Yuan* [Void and Origin] generate each other; cold and heat complete each other.

Master *Chonghe* instructed the *Longgang* [Dragon Ridge] *qi*-cultivation method:
*"What the form relies upon is *qi*; what *qi* depends on is the form. When *qi* is complete, the form is whole; when *qi* is exhausted, the form dies. Thus, those who nurture life refine both form and *qi* to preserve existence. There is no form without *qi*, nor *qi* without form. The two are inseparable—is this not clear?"*

I have long admired the Dao, searching through scriptures and histories, practicing restraint for over ten years. What I have seen and heard has never fully satisfied me.

During the *Dali* era, I encountered *Lao Fu Wang Gong* [Master of Lao Fu] returning from *Bei Yue* [Northern Peak], leaning on his staff at the post station, gazing at me as before.

I deemed him a singular man and invited him to converse, and indeed he proved to be a virtuous sage of the Dao.

Pitying my earnest resolve, he immediately bestowed upon me the methods of *tuna*—breath refinement and *zhentian*—cultivation of the True—transmitting them all verbally.

He spoke of the *Five Teeth* and *Six Characters* methods, as well as all *xī* [circulation] practices, as means of *shōu qì*—gathering *qi*.

Gathering *qi* is vigorous and forceful, not suited to ordinary mortals.

As for *nà qì*—receiving *qi*, it is the *tāixī*—embryonic breathing. Only *xíng qì*—conducting *qi* is the true Dao, the foundation of self-cultivation.

**The Method of Advancing *Qi*:**
For those who wish to refine *qi*, first, one must dwell in a lofty, secluded chamber, burning *lùxiāng*—aloewood—on either side, using a thick, soft cushion three to four inches high for reclining, with a pillow one inch high. After midnight, when *qi* first stirs, or at dawn, when waking, exhale nine times from the abdomen to purge its turbid *qi*. If one wishes to regulate breathing, it need not be at midnight or dawn, but rather when the celestial *qi* is gentle and the abdomen is empty.

**Conducting and Circulating *Qi*:**
Close the eyes, strike the teeth thirty-six times to awaken the body’s spirit, press the hands against the outer corners of the eyes, then the sides of the nose, rotate the ears and stroke the face, and lift the *guān*—passages—to support the *shí*—stone (anus). Gradually guide and invigorate all joints, then press the tongue against the palate to gather saliva. Once the mouth is filled, swallow three times, directing the *qi* to the five *zàng*—viscera, making the face radiant. Then, relaxed and at ease, let the mind expand freely, as boundless as the void, casting off all burdens. Only then may one practice *tāo*—refining *qi*, closing the mouth firmly to seal the *Xuánfáng*—Mysterious Chamber (vagina) and retain the essence.

For beginners, before *qi* flows freely, one must not yet practice retention. After one hundred days to half a year, when the spirit-*qi* circulates smoothly and sweat appears, then retention may begin.

**The Method of Refining *Qi*:**
Each of the five *zàng* has its own spirit. At night, when closing the breath externally, if one feels *qi* rising after refinement, first stir the abdomen to expel stale food and old *qi*. Then, regulate the pulse: lie on your back, close the eyes, retain the breath, clench the fists at the sides of the breasts, straighten the knees, lift the back and torso, and close the *qi* to stir the *Hǎi*—Sea (lower abdomen). Make the internal and external *qi* rotate, exhaling nine times before regulating it.

**The Method of Regulating *Qi*:**
The art of regulating *qi* lies in swallowing.

Common folk mistake external *qi* for internal *qi*, unable to distinguish. *Tūnà*—breathwork—must be practiced in seclusion, lest the nature be misused.

Thus, knowing that humans are born of Heaven and Earth, the body inherently possesses primal *qi* and its principles. Each time one swallows and receives, the internal *qi* harmonizes with the external. Naturally, the *Hǎi*—Sea’s *qi* responds, rising and falling with the sun and moon. At the moment of inhalation and exhalation, close the mouth swiftly and swallow, making a resonant, gurgling sound—*shuìshuì*—as if water dripping into a vessel, distinctly audible. First, guide it down the left side through twenty joints, like water seeping into a well. Then, from the right, thus making the internal *qi* luminous. With intent, send it downward, using the hands to assist, directing it into the *Qìhǎi*—Sea of *Qi* (lower abdomen, three inches below the navel), also called the *Xià Dāntián*—Lower Elixir Field.

For beginners, the upper *jiāo*—burner is not yet open. Use the hands to assist, swiftly guiding the *qi* down the throat. If it does not descend easily, use slight force to press and swallow, ensuring a sound as it descends. If the *qi* flows freely, no assistance is needed.

Three swallows with the mouth closed, followed by two dry swallows, is called *Yúnxíng*—Cloud Movement. One wet swallow, taking saliva and swallowing it, is called *Yǔshī*—Rain Application.

For beginners, before *qi* flows freely, practice two swallows followed by *Yǔshī*. Only later will three swallows be achieved. A year of diligent practice yields minor success; two or three years bring great achievement.

**The Method of *Xī* Circulation:**
Near the Lower Elixir Field are two orifices leading to the spinal *mài*—vessels, connecting to the *Níwán*—Mud Pellet (pineal gland). The *Níwán* governs the brain.

After three swallows, swiftly store the primal *qi* in the Lower Elixir Field. With intent, imagine this *qi* entering the two orifices, forming two white *xī*—circulations—along the spine, ascending into the *Níwán*. This steams and nourishes all the palaces, making the hair and skin of the head, neck, arms, hands, and fingers bristle. Then, it descends into the chest, the five *zàng*, the skin, and the Middle Elixir Field—heart palace—sequentially irrigating them before returning to the Lower Elixir Field. It passes through the *Sān Sān Xīng*—Three-Three Stars (perineum), down to the knees and ankles, reaching the *Yǒngquán*—Gushing Spring (sole).

Thus, dividing one *qi* to govern all, stirring it like thunder and nourishing it like wind and rain—just as Heaven and Earth possess springs, not relying on thunder to agitate, but on essence to nourish all things.

Humans have saliva; without rinsing and swallowing, essence cannot irrigate the five *zàng*. Without retaining essence to nourish the brain, it cannot ascend through copulation. Without *tūnà*—breathwork, internal *qi* cannot be drawn upon.

Thus, the Dao of simplicity and moderation, the principles of application, are modeled after Heaven and Earth.

If one visualizes the turbid, malevolent, stagnant, and pathogenic *qi* within the body, as well as congealed blood, being purged by the true *qi*, they will naturally exit through the fingertips. To disperse *qi*, spread the fingers without retention—each such movement counts as one *tōng*—passage. When *qi* flows freely, there is no illness. Then, regulate it to make the *qi* even, and again, practice swallowing as before.

Leisurely swallowing thirty-six times constitutes minor achievement. If not yet abstaining from grain, one must eat sparingly, ensuring the abdomen is empty. Then, in a state of emptiness and tranquility, seated outside, swallow ten times naturally—this equals three hundred sixty swallows.

If practiced for a long time until *qi* flows freely, reaching three hundred sixty swallows also counts as intermediate achievement. One thousand two hundred breaths constitute great achievement.

If one cannot refine the form and alter the substance, they remain like withered wood, their essence exhausted.

**The Method of Refining *Qi*:**
*"In my leisure, I refine *qi*."*

Entering the chamber, remove your clothing, loosen your hair, and recline facing outward, stretching both hands freely without clenching them. Spread your hair across the mat, then proceed with the **Method of Regulating *Qi*** by swallowing.

Upon completion, enter a state of **mystic heart** (*míngxīn*) and **cut off thought** (*juéxiǎng*), allowing the *qi* to move naturally. If it reaches the **threshold of perception** (*guò lǐ*) and feels constricted, exhale it. If breathing becomes slightly hurried, regulate it again. When the *qi* flows smoothly and evenly, gradually increase the swallows to twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty—until the entire body sweats. If this occurs, it is a sign of success. Remain composed and still, avoiding any sudden gusts of external *qi*. Wait until your spirit feels bright and clear. If the *qi* grows sluggish and seeks to escape, do not force it. If your limbs feel stiff and unyielding, likewise refrain. Practice this once every fifteen days.

**The Method of Closing *Qi*:**
If at any time your cultivation encounters **unfavorable conditions** (*guāiyí*), or if illness suddenly arises, quickly retreat to a secluded room. Arrange your hands and feet according to the **Method of Regulating *Qi***, then swallow to close the *qi*. Focus your mind on the afflicted area and, with intent, direct your **closed *qi*** (*bì qì*) to attack it. If the *qi* is extreme, regulate it first; upon completion, continue relentlessly until the *qi* is expelled. If the *qi* is urgent, cease; if it is sluggish, regulate and then attack again—twenty, thirty, forty, or fifty times. When the afflicted area feels relieved and sweat emerges, stop.

If the illness does not abate, then between midnight and the fifth watch (*wǔ gēng*), before dawn, repeatedly gather your intent to attack, until the symptoms ease. Only target the afflicted area; if the *qi* does not heal, it will not mend.

**The Method of Distributing *Qi*:**
When distributing *qi* to heal others, first inquire about the **afflicted areas** (*suǒkǔ*) of their **Five Zang** (*wǔzàng*) organs. Transfer your own *qi* into their body, positioning them so that the afflicted area faces you. Quiet the mind and still the thoughts.

This **distribution of *qi*** (*bù qì*) resembles the **swallowing of *qi*** (*yàn qì*), and the illness will naturally dissipate. All **hundred evils** (*bǎi xié*) will be permanently banished.

**The Method of Regulating *Qi*:**
Humans consume the **Five Flavors** (*wǔwèi*), each of which corresponds to one of the **Five Zang** organs. The turbid *qi* of each organ is either inhaled or exhaled through the mouth. Moreover, the **Six Fu** (*liùfǔ*) and **Three Jiao** (*sānjiāo*) accumulate impurities, which merge into turbid *qi*. When sleep first overtakes you, the **greasy and foul *qi*** (*hūn nì qì*) becomes unbearable.

If the mouth is dry and the tongue rough, or if both cheeks glow with a radiant luster and the person cannot eat, this is the **Upper Jiao heat sign** (*shàngjiāo rè hòu*), and you must immediately employ the **Great Opening method** (*dāngé dǎkāi*)—swallowing twenty to thirty times, then exhaling loudly seven or nine times, and finally swallowing. When the **saliva** (*jīnyè*) in the mouth becomes clear and sweet, like a **spring’s pure waters** (*qiánchū*), the heat has retreated, and the **Five Zang** are cooled.

If the saliva in the mouth is **pale and insipid** (*língdàn*), and food and drink lack flavor, while the heart feels **distended and unwilling to accept nourishment** (*yángyáng bùshòu shuǐgǔ*), this is the **cold sign** (*líng hòu*), and you must exhale to **dispel it** (*chuīlǐ zhī*).

**The Method of Nourishing After Eating:**
Those who practice *qi* cultivation must be cautious about what they consume. Eat what is beneficial, avoid what is harmful. If food disrupts the **true *qi*** (*zhèng qì*), the pulse will become disordered. If it aids the *qi*, eat it regularly; if it harms, avoid it entirely.

Each morning at dawn, consume a small amount of **plain congee** (*dàn gāo*) or **hemp seed congee** (*húmázi gāo*), which nourishes the **spleen *qi*** (*pí qì*) and supplements the **saliva** (*jīnyè*). At noon, eat a small amount of **plain rice porridge** (*miǎnrì yàn*) or **steamed rice cakes** (*bǐng*), but never while hot, lest it disrupt the **true *qi***. **Onion and blue-green algae soup** (*cōnglán gēng*) is also beneficial. All grains should be soft, well-cooked, and slightly sweet. **Barley consumed over four seasons** (*dàmài jīng sìshí*) is excellent, but do not overindulge.

When hunger arises, eat as needed. If someone practices **stillness** (*jìngxiū*) and **fasting** (*zhāijiè*), they may also **ascend as an immortal** (*shēngxiān*).

The **Thirty-Six Fowl** (*sānshíliù qín*), **straight days** (*zhí rì*), and **days of one’s birth year** (*běnmìng shǔ*) must not be consumed. **Dates, chestnuts, taro, wheat, and beans** (*zǎo, lì, yùzi, mài, yīng*) should not be eaten in excess, as they **agitate evil *qi*** (*fādòng xié qì*). **Southern Shennong grass** (*dān nán shù cǎo*) may be eaten in moderation. When hunger is slight, eat lightly—do not overindulge, lest it **injure the heart** (*shāngxīn*). Overindulgence causes **closure of the Five Zang** (*bìsè*), making *qi* circulation difficult.

**Spicy, salty, sour, acrid, and stale foods** (*rè wù, xiánsuān xīnlà chénbài zhī wù*) hinder *qi* flow. After eating, immediately exhale to **dispel the poisonous *qi*** (*hēquè fùzhōng zhī dú qì*), keeping the intestines and stomach **empty and tranquil** (*xūjìng*). If even a mouthful is mistakenly consumed, the **poisonous residue** (*dúwù fùnèi*) will linger within. Be extremely cautious.

Before eating, swallow three to five breaths of *qi* to harmonize with the meal. Additionally, ingest two or three **raw *qi* beans** (*shēng qì dòu*), which **guide the *qi* through the Three Jiao** (*yǐn qì tōng sānjiāo*), **balance the Zang-Fu** (*hé zàngfǔ*), **clarify the eyes** (*míngmù*), **expel harmful substances** (*qūbèn èwù*), and **dissolve grains** (*xiāo gǔshí*) to **assist the true *qi***. Their benefits are too numerous to recount. The *Tai Qing Jing* contains additional methods.

After cultivating *qi*, if **foul *qi*** (*suì qì*) descends and cannot be endured, lingering may **invite illness** (*yǒu qí shēngbìng*). Each day, before meals, drink one cup of wine as your **nature dictates** (*suíxìng*), warming it in winter and cooling it in summer. This also **aids the *qi*** (*zhù qì*) and **expels all evil *qi*** (*qiān xié qì*). The warning lies in excess—too much causes **sluggishness and confusion** (*hūnluàn*), intoxication **injures the spirit** (*shāngshén*), and **stagnant *qi*** (*zàng qì*) shortens lifespan. If drinking is unavoidable, immediately exhale twenty to fifty times afterward. Open the mouth wide while exhaling to **dispel the turbidity** (*chuīqīan miǎnzàng*), and the **poisonous effects** (*dú*) will not take hold. You will not be intoxicated, nor will you be affected by the wine’s **overpowering *qi***. The taste of wine and food will remain undiminished.

Avoid **raw meat** (*chōngshēng chǎnzhì*), **corpse *qi*** (*sǐwáng zhī suì*), or **the *qi* of slaughtered livestock while in motion** (*chéng liùxìng zǒuzòu*). Do not **rush into foul odors** (*chōngchōng chòusù*), as they **damage the true *qi***. If encountered unexpectedly, quickly **avoid them** (*bìzhī*). If **evil *qi* enters the abdomen** (*è qì rù fù*), immediately employ the **Method of Regulating *Qi*** to **flush and expel it** (*dǎngé dǐdí*).

If drinking wine, consume three cups; if not, use **true *qi*** to **rinse it out** (*tāochū*). If it refuses to leave, do not **forcefully press** (*bùyòng guò lǐ pòzhī*), but allow it to **gradually exit** (*rèn jiànjiàn chūzhī*). If the **Upper Jiao heat** persists, you must **regulate the *qi*** to **harmonize it** (*shǐ qì pínghé*).

Consume little **oily and greasy food** (*yóunì*), ensuring it does not **contact the true *qi***. If you have previously consumed such foods, do not repeat the offense while cultivating *qi*. After one year of **uninterrupted flow** (*tōng*), and three years of **fulfilled practice** (*gōngchéng*), the **true *qi* will solidify** (*zhèng qì suìníng*), and even if you encounter such foods again, they will cause no harm.

Practice **a thousand swallows daily** (*qiān yàn*), and you will have no fear of **excessive return** (*duō fǎn*). Begin gradually from this point.

The **Scripture** (*Jīng*) states:
*"The *qi* transforms into blood, blood into essence, essence into marrow.
One year transforms the *qi*, two years the blood,
three years the pulse, four years the flesh,
five years the marrow, six years the sinews,
seven years the bones, eight years the hair,
nine years the form.
After thirty-six thousand days of divine cultivation,
all [36,000] *shén* [spirits/aspects] transform into immortality,
and one is called a **True Person** (*Zhēnrén*)."*

Unceasingly cultivate the **fulfilled practice** (*gōngchéng*), linking joints and solidifying the five viscera—
internal *qi* does not escape, external *qi* does not enter,
cold and heat cannot intrude.
Ascending and transforming, life aligns with the Three Luminaries.

**Resting the Root Method** (*Xiūgēn Jué*) states:
After diligently practicing for three years as before,
the true *qi* flows freely, essence and marrow are replete,
a hundred spirits guard, the Three Corpses flee—
one naturally no longer desires the *qi* of the Five Grains,
constantly pondering the difficulty of absolute abstinence.
Yet when hunger arises, simply swallow—
no need for fixed times, morning or evening.
One may also combine this with medicinal elixirs.
Most people fail to grasp this:
they consume mere trifles all day, obsessed with drugs,
thus never attaining it—
this is not the path of the superior adept.

The *Huángtíng Scripture* (*Jīng*) says:
*"The grains’ fruits are earth’s refined essence,
five flavors’ allure—external demons’ stench.
Their stink confuses the spirit, scatters the embryonic *qi*—
how could one reverse aging, return to infancy?"*

The Three Souls wander, the Corporeal Souls drift—
why not nourish the **True One’s** (*Tàihé*) pure essence?
Thus, one may enter **Yellow Peace** (*Huángníng*) and not die.

The **Guardian Method** (*Shǒuhù Jué*) says:
All mortals crave desires—
this has been true from ancient to modern times.
The Daoist Scriptures state:
*"Only when death approaches do the wise begin to cherish their bodies,
their crimes fulfilled, they seek to change their ways.
When illness strikes, they scramble for remedies—
the Heavenly Net has already been cast.
How can they now escape?"*

The virtuous do not wait for peril to value life;
they withdraw from the world, cultivate the heart, and aspire to the Dao.
The Dao is *qi*.
*Qi* is the master of the body;
the master is the body’s life;
life is the body’s root.
If one cherishes essence and preserves *qi*,
only then is life fully sustained.

The **Method of *Qi*-Cultivation** (*Xíngqì Jué*) says:
The Dao is *qi*.
Preserving *qi* attains the Dao—
thus, longevity is achieved.
The spirit is essence.
When essence remains, the spirit is bright;
when essence scatters, the spirit departs.
Essence is the flowing river of blood and vessels,
the vital fluid nourishing the bones.
When essence is exhausted, the bones wither—
death follows. This is not the fixed Dao.

The Daoist pursues essence;
one must always store and guard it,
as **Pengzu** instructed **Wùchéngzǐ**:
*"Close the essence, fear neither cold nor heat.
Such a person naturally remains serene.
I have spoken much of this."*

The Scripture says:
*"The Dao lies not in agitation.
Do not lust after sounds and colors,
do not covet honor or shame,
do not weary the body.
Constantly guide and draw—
when internal *qi* rests in peace,
one may attain a thousand years.
Seeking further the supreme elixir,
longevity becomes possible.
If one does not leak [essence],
this is called **nourishing essence** (*fújīng*).
When all ten thousand thoughts cease,
desires grow few—
thus, life is prolonged."*

Each morning, before rising,
first strike the teeth seven to nine times,
then kneel with face bound,
harmonizing the black *qi*.
Draw in the clear black through the nose,
expel the turbid black through the mouth,
rubbing hands together as you do.
Guide and draw as needed,
press the tongue to the upper palate,
gather and swallow the saliva until the mouth is full—
swallow three times, then stop.
Next, passively circulate from the crown to the soles,
seven times each way,
to treat the bones and joints,
unblock the black vessels,
drain stagnant turbidity,
and supplement exhaustion.

**Method to Eliminate the Three Corpses and Nine Worms:**

The Corpses harbor nine worms:
1. The **Lurking Worm** (*fúchóng*), four *fēn* long;
2. The **Roundworm** (*huíchóng*), one *chǐ* long;
3. The **White Worm** (*báichóng*), one *cùn* long;
4. The **Flesh Worm** (*ròuchóng*), like rotting apricots;
5. The **Lung Worm** (*fèichóng*), like silkworms;
6. The **Stomach Worm** (*wèichóng*), like toads;
7. The **Diaphragm Worm** (*géchóng*), like gourd slices;
8. The **Red Worm** (*chìchóng*), like raw meat;
9. The **Threadworm** (*nǐchóng*), like vegetable worms.

Only the Lurking Worm rules the others.
The Roundworm, piercing the heart, kills;
the White Worm multiplies—
its offspring grow to four or five *chǐ*, also lethal.
The Flesh Worm causes restlessness,
the Lung Worm induces coughing,
the Stomach Worm provokes vomiting,
the Diaphragm Worm makes one spit excessively,
the Red Worm causes abdominal rumbling,
the Threadworm, dwelling in the intestines,
if numerous, causes leprosy, hemorrhoids,
and sores or eczema.

All nine may reside in the body, though not always in full.
Other treatments exist, but here is one remedy:

**Prescription to Eliminate the Three Corpses and Nine Worms:**
- **Tube Crow** (*guǎnzhòng*) – five *fēn* – controls Threadworms
- **White Dwarf Rhubarb** (*báizhí lú*) – twelve *fēn* – controls Roundworms
- **Sichuan Lacquer** (*shǔqī*) – three *fēn* – controls White Worms
- **Chinese Wolfberry** (*gōuqí*) – five *fēn* – controls Flesh Worms
- **Stone Silkworm** (*shícán*) – five *fēn* – controls Lurking Worms
- **Thick Bark** (*hòupò*) – three *fēn* – controls Lung Worms
- **Wolf’s Tooth** (*lángyá*) – four *fēn* – controls Stomach Worms
- **Dead Silkworm** (*jiāngcán*) – four *fēn* – controls Intestinal Worms
- **Thunderberry** (*léiwánzǐ*) – six *fēn* – controls Red Worms
*(Also called **Crow’s Solitude** (*yādú*) or **Earth Pipe** (*tǔyúzi*)*
**Kudzu Vine** (*téng*) – like kudzu but with finer leaves)

Grind all nine ingredients to a powder,
toast with *wǔhúo* (mild and strong) fire until golden,
sift finely, and mix with refined honey into pills the size of **paulownia seeds** (*tóngzǐ*).

Take five pills daily in warm water, three times a day,
gradually increasing to ten.
By the twelfth day, stagnation will subside;
by sixty days, all ailments will heal.
Adjust the dose according to one’s strength—
the less taken, the better.
Women may take it, but must first observe dietary restrictions.
