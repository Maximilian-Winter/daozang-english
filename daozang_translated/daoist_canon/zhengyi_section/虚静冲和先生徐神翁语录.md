**Preface to *The Recorded Sayings of Master Xu the Tranquil and Harmonious***

In this fleeting human life, all that one receives—whether from Heaven, fate, allotted share, or predestined measure—cannot be altered by even a hair’s breadth. Yet because most cannot fathom the underlying principles, they remain unaware of these truths until they seek out those who have attained the Dao, those who, as the saying goes, "have already grasped what lies within my heart."

When Confucius knew of Boniu’s impending death or foretold that Shang Qu would have sons, was this mere worldly divination? No—it arose from direct perception. Master Xu, while in Hailing, would inscribe characters for people, revealing their fortunes and misfortunes throughout life, and his words never failed to prove true. In my youth, I often traveled along the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and heard many of his sayings. Over time, however, those who truly understood him grew fewer, and his teachings became more revered.

Miao Xiyi, a Daoist of Tianqing Abbey, was a disciple of the Master. For decades, he remained at the Master’s side, recording his written words and preserving them. He later asked me to edit and arrange these records so that their essence might be passed down to his followers. This was twenty-seven years ago. After Miao’s death, his writings were taken away by others. When I later came to govern this region, I recovered the original draft from among the people and once again arranged and compared them.

Confucius said, "I do not speak of the strange, the violent, or the chaotic." If words bear no verification, they are but strange tales; if they are beyond comprehension, they belong to the realm of spirits. In such cases, silence is best. Yet if words prove true—if they reveal fortune and misfortune to others, making clear what should be avoided or embraced—how can they be dismissed as unknowable?

Those who attained the Dao in ancient times did so by exhaustively understanding principle and fully realizing their nature. When principle is fully understood, all principles under Heaven become one; when one’s own nature is fully realized, the natures of all things are likewise mastered. Thus, they are called those who "know beforehand," who "see beforehand," who "awaken beforehand." The world marvels at this, yet those who have attained the Dao do not consider it extraordinary.

But how could the achievements of Master Xu be limited to this alone?

**Postface to *The Recorded Sayings of Master Xu the Tranquil and Harmonious***

I had long heard of the extraordinary Master Xu of Hailing and regretted not having encountered more of his teachings. In the *yisi* year of the Chunxi reign (1185), while serving as acting governor of this region, I sought out his traces but found no records to gather. When I inquired among his disciples, they said: "In our land, since the Han and Jin dynasties, immortals have followed one after another. In Master Xu’s time, there were also Chen Doudou, the Recluse Zhou, and Master Tang, who appeared in succession. They were but our neighbors—how much more so was Master Xu, who attained the Dao and for over fifty years instructed commoners, servants, women, and children in numbers beyond counting? How could all of this be recorded?"

When I asked about what they had personally seen or heard, some replied: "The Master ascended seventy-eight years ago, and none of the elders who knew him remain." Later, someone showed me a printed edition of the *Recorded Sayings* from Yanling, compiled by the Daoist Miao Xiyi and edited by Zhu Xinzhong. Though the collection was quite detailed, errors and inconsistencies made verification impossible.

In my leisure, I inquired among the local scholars, and some could recount what their fathers and elder brothers—disciples of the Master—had seen and heard. Comparing these with Miao’s records, I found occasional discrepancies, but the core of his words was confirmed. I also obtained an earlier account of the Master’s conduct and teachings, written by the village elder Pan Ruyi. Though I was strict in my selection, I regretted that the record was not more extensive.

Thus, I had Miao’s records reexamined in light of what I had heard, revising and editing them. Inconsistencies, contradictions, and errors—numbering in the dozens—were corrected, with doubtful passages preserved in both versions. I also added accounts from elders, as well as records from *Dongxuan Bilu*, *Longchuan Biezhi*, *Sun Gong Tanpu*, and *Tong’an Zhi*, totaling eighteen entries, which I combined with the conduct record into a single volume. Like carving hard wood, I strove to ensure its reliability, that this land might preserve his teachings and turn from evil toward goodness—a small aid to the customs of the age.

Written on the first day of the first month of the *dingwei* year (1187) by Zhu Songqing, Gentleman for Court Audiences, Prefect of Taizhou Prefecture, concurrently responsible for agriculture, irrigation, and military farming.

**The Recorded Sayings of Master Xu the Void, Serene, and Harmonious (Fascicle One)**

Master Xu, styled Shouxin, was a native of Hailing in Taizhou. At nineteen, he entered Tianqing Abbey, where he lived in obscurity, sweeping and cleaning. There, he encountered a perfected one who transmitted the Dao to him, and he recited the *Scripture of Salvation* daily. When asked about good or ill fortune, he would respond with words from the scripture.

He always carried a broom, and people called him "Xu the Second Sweeper." The Transport Commissioner Jiang Yingshu, noting the scripture’s line, "The Divine Lord receives the mandate to sweep away all inauspiciousness," began calling him "Divine Master." From then on, all referred to him as the Divine Master.

In the second year of the Chongning reign (1103), an imperial edict bestowed upon him the title "Master of Void, Serene Harmony." He was summoned to court three times. In the second year of the Daguan reign (1108), on the twentieth day of the fourth month, he shed his mortal form at the Daoist cloister of the Upper Clarity Repository of Auspiciousness. He was seventy-six years old. He was posthumously granted the title Grand Master for Court Audiences, and an imperial decree ordered his burial in the eastern outskirts of the city, at the eastern plain of Xianglin.

During the Xuanhe reign (1119–1125), the Ascension to Perfection Abbey was built on the site. In the Jiayou reign (1056–1063), the Daoist Yu Yuanji of Tiantai came to reside at Yuntang. After more than a year, he manifested signs of leprosy, and the community shunned him. The Master alone served him with utmost reverence. When Yu Yuanji passed away, the Master informed Xu Zongchen of Hai’an Town, who provided a coffin for burial. The Master mourned him as a teacher.

After the burial, he returned and wept bitterly, bowing to all the Daoist adepts, even the servants. Then, before the North Pole Hall, he took Yu’s belongings and burned them all. From then on, he wore only tattered robes and carried a broom to sweep. Sometimes he would shut himself in his room all day, singing or laughing. When he saw others, he would bow first. Everyone thought him mad.

The day after the burial, Xu Zongchen saw the Master coming to express his gratitude and took out a bolt of cloth and a thousand coins to offer him. The Master had already left, and though Xu pursued him for several paces, he could not catch up. Puzzled, Xu later went to the abbey to inquire, only to learn that the Master had never left at all.

During the Zhiping reign (1064–1067), a Daoist of ugly and swarthy appearance, with a broad forehead and a topknot wrapped in plain cloth, arrived wearing a coarse robe. From his staff hung a gourd the size of a fist, and he claimed to have come from the Two Rivers region. When asked his name, he only called himself the Black Daoist. He lodged at the residence of a man named Zhao and often visited the abbey. The abbey’s prior, Chen Yongyi, had already taken notice of him and frequently gave him thirty taels of silver. Later, the Black Daoist would sit in silent meditation beneath the North Pole Hall, speaking in whispers only when the Master approached—no one else could hear their words.

After more than a year, he departed, telling Zhao: “I have nothing to repay your kindness, but I shall ensure that your inn remains free of mosquitoes and bedbugs in the summer months.” True to his word, the inn thereafter saw no such pests, and its guest lodgings were always full.

During the Xining reign (1068–1077), the Daoist prelate Chongji, Master Tang Riyan, was making his nightly rounds of the abbey quarters when he saw what appeared to be a flicker of firelight in the kitchen. Upon arriving, he found nothing. The Master’s sleeping quarters were beneath the kitchen; pushing open the door, he saw the Master sitting upright facing east, eyes closed in meditation, entirely unperturbed. One day, when the abbey’s provisions ran low, the Master was sent to the estate to oversee the delivery of rice, and he went at once.

When the hour grew late, Master Tang arrived behind the Three Clarities Hall and found the Master lying asleep with a broom for a pillow. He called out and berated him. The Master replied, “The rice will arrive by morning.” Tang, enraged, did not press further but waited until dawn to question the rice porters. They said, “Brother Xu urged us yesterday without a moment’s rest, and we had already returned home earlier.” The estate lay over a hundred *li* from the prefectural seat; Tang was stunned. Thereafter, he gave the Master a religious name and enrolled him in the register of disciples, and people began to believe he had encountered an immortal.

Those who came to ask about fortune or misfortune received answers in the form of passages from the *Scripture of Salvation*, or silence, or even sharp rebukes—each response carrying its own meaning. At the close of the Xining reign, he was granted an imperial dispensation for his fidelity and ordained as a Daoist priest. The Master merely laughed and declined, saying, “I only know how to sweep,” and continued his labor as before.

Each evening, he gathered incense papers from the halls and took them to his room, where he would casually write characters on them, folding each one away. The next day, when visitors came seeking written talismans, he would distribute them in order, answering all their questions until the papers were exhausted and the seekers departed.

While sweeping, he never cast anything aside. Withered leaves and rotting wood were piled at their roots, while dry leaves were gathered in one place. After rituals, he collected leftover lamp oil to fuel the morning and evening pestles and mills. Unusable stove remnants were twisted to extract every drop of grease, and even the dregs were not discarded but stored in a vessel. During winnowing, broken rice grains were also collected in a separate container. On bitterly cold days, he would gather beggars and vagrants, burning fallen leaves beneath them and scattering the remnants over the flames. He then cooked congee from the broken rice and shared it with them.

The Daoist Master Cui of Zhenyuan Abbey in Shuzhou, named Guzhi and styled Daoguang, once traveled to Stone Pillar Ridge, where he saw two men playing *weiqi* beneath a pine tree. One of them gave Cui a piece and instructed him to swallow it. Hesitant, Cui proceeded on his way until he suddenly encountered the Master, to whom he recounted the incident and showed the piece. The Master took it and swallowed it, then passed through Wutang before departing. Later, when Cui returned to the ridge, he met the same players, who berated him harshly. From that time on, Cui descended into madness.

Master Tang Riyan frequently hosted Daoist adepts from all directions. Whenever the Master swept the Cloud Hall, visitors would invariably arrive that day. Shen Boyu, the magistrate of Hailing, brought his young son to see the Master and asked whether the boy would hold office. The Master did not answer, but when pressed, he said, “Metal and Water govern his fate; his official post will come at twenty-seven.” Later, Shen consulted an astrologer, who confirmed the two stars in his son’s chart. The year he was appointed to office matched the Master’s prediction.

Shen’s wife fell ill and sought a written charm. The Master inscribed *Wuxiang Guanyin* (“Guanyin of No-Thought”). When she asked again, he wrote, “Recite it ten times.” That October, she died. Later, Shen read the commentary on the *Scripture of Salvation* and learned that *Wuxiang Guanyin* presided over the register of the long night.

Zha, a retired minister of works, visited the Master with Shen, but the Master did not emerge. After knocking for some time, the Master said, “I see only Magistrate Shen, not Minister Zha.” The two left, and shortly afterward, Zha died.

The abbey’s superiors, noting the dilapidated state of the buildings and the growing number of visitors, placed a donation chest beside the Master’s seat to fund repairs. The Master approved, and offerings from near and far soon poured in, sometimes reaching tens of thousands in a single day. Yet there were also days when the chest remained sealed and untouched, though the donations continued as usual.

During the famine of the Xining era, the abbey’s gates lacked provisions. Each morning, the Master would personally distribute several hundred coins to the stewards for purchasing vegetables. The servants suspected he had a hidden stash and plotted to steal it. While he was out, they secretly opened his door, only to find a basin of water inside. One stumbled, soaking his clothes. As he straightened his garments, the Master suddenly appeared, sitting atop a tree, laughing: “I told you not to open it.” The would-be thieves fled in disarray.

Prefect Zhang Cis han had an old friend serving as an official in Chengdu. A letter arrived stating, “There is a Daoist in Chengdu wearing tattered robes who calls himself Old Man Xu of Tianqing Abbey in Taizhou.” During the Yuanfeng era, Jiang Yingshu, the transport commissioner, first met the Master and asked, “What are you skilled in?” The Master replied, “I don’t know anything.”

“Can you foretell fortune and misfortune?”
“I cannot.”

“Do you understand the *Scripture of Salvation* when you read it?”
“I do not.”

“How do you assess my official career?”
“The official is most astute.”
Pressed again and again, he said, “You should favor Zang and punish Xing.”
“And if I do not favor Zang and punish Xing?”
The Master reached behind his back with his hand and said, “The tumor pains me too much to speak of it.” (For Jiang had a growth on his back that flared with rage, swelling until he could not speak—a condition he had never revealed to anyone.) Thereupon he ordered two attendants to support the Master as he bowed to him, declaring, “A true man indeed!” The scripture says: *“The Divine Lord receives his mandate to sweep away all inauspiciousness.”* This man is worthy of the title. Henceforth he called him the Divine Lord and composed a poem for him:

*Bearing the broom to sweep all dust,*
*For thirty springs it has been thus.*
*I pity his lone resolve,*
*Feminine stillness, never first to move.*

He established the Hall of Embracing Stillness in his honor. Some say that Lü Jifu’s poem, which included the line *“to cease all boasting and guard the feminine alone,”* inspired Jiang to adopt the name. Jiang also saw a stele beside the hall inscribed to the Perfected One Le Zichang and wrote a poem upon it:

*Jade altars three-tiered, thick with moss,*
*I picture the Perfected One drinking from the crimson cup.*
*The soughing immortal wind stirs cedar and cypress—*
*Only the whirlwind’s chariot could bring him back for a time.*

Zichang’s former residence stood beside Lezhen Bridge in present-day Chongzhen Ward, the very site of his ascension. During the Liang Dynasty’s Datong era, the Lezhen Abbey was built there. By the Tang Dynasty’s Dazhong era, it was relocated eastward—today’s Tianqing Abbey. The Master’s own dwelling also lay east of Lezhen Bridge, which is why Jiang’s poem suggests he was Zichang reborn.

Jiang Yingshu once asked the Master for a written character. He wrote the character *long* (dragon). When asked why it was incomplete, he replied, “It will be filled in later.”

That year, he was appointed Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion. When asked again, he replied, "For now, it will endure." Pressed further, he added three strokes. Asked about the back tumor, he said, "It will descend beneath the pavilion." Later, when appointed Academician of the Dragon Diagram Pavilion, the tumor indeed shifted slightly downward.

Once, when asked for a written character, he wrote *Red Heavenly Demon King*, and on another occasion, *Bearing Heaven’s Burden of Stone*. Asked how many *dan* the burden weighed, he said, "Two thousand *dan*." Soon after, he was transferred to command Guangzhou, fulfilling the prophecy of *Red Heavenly Demon King*. Later, when he entered the Bureau of Military Affairs, it validated *Bearing Heaven’s Burden of Stone*.

During Jiang’s tenure as Transport Commissioner, he wished to dredge the Guishan Canal. Though he pondered it long, he had not spoken of it to anyone. One day, he brought the matter to the Master, who immediately said, "If you wish to open it, then open it—why ask others?" Jiang’s intent was thus settled.

When Chancellor Wang of Jing dispatched someone to request a written character, the Master wrote *First Unfurling King* in four characters, just as before. The Master said, "The *admonish* character need not include the *person* radical." This referred to the classic line: *"Red script, jade characters."* Later, as the Master returned to Jinling by boat, an old man suddenly called from the shore, "My lord, Master Xu the Immortal has a letter for you." Upon receiving it, he saw the same four characters as before. The old man vanished in an instant. Soon after, the Master passed away. During the Zhenghe era, he was posthumously enfeoffed as Prince of Shu—his written prophecy fulfilled.

Minister Yu Ce, dismissed from Tongzhou at the end of the Yuanfeng era, came to visit the Master. The Master wrote *Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Dark Warrior, Lion, White Crane*, arranging them to left and right, with *sun and moon illuminating*, filling the chamber with radiance—twenty-four characters in all. The Master said, "You have gained it, gained it! If you can employ these characters..." Upon returning to the capital, Yu was appointed Sacrificial Attendant of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices. At the time, ritual objects were being prepared, and he saw the processional banners of *Azure Dragon, White Tiger*, and the others—only then did he grasp the Master’s meaning.

When his son Yu Hang requested a written character, he received *Thirty-Two Passages*. At the time, Hang was eleven; by the Yuanfu era, when he passed the provincial examination, he was thirty-two.

In the seventh year of Yuanfeng, candidates for the Southern Palace examination sought a written character. The Master wrote *Music Turns to Ashes* in four characters. Zhang Zhengyi’s son, Dacheng, received *Mountains Swallow Mist* in four characters. That year’s examination featured a *Music Emerges from Emptiness* essay, and the examination hall caught fire.

Minister Fan Bing, serving as Surveillance Commissioner, asked the Master, "How much do you eat each day?" The Master replied, "I stop when full." Asked if he dreamed, he...

He replied, "Ever since I received the correct Dao, I have never dreamed—only later did I cease to have them."

Fan asked, "Is this through cultivation and awakening, or merely through encountering those who have attained the Dao?"
The Master did not answer.
Pressed repeatedly, he said, "Through encountering others."
"In which year did you encounter them?"
"In the gengxu year."
"In this gengshen year, have you transmitted the Dao to others?"
He smiled but did not answer.

Fan, who had no sons, requested a written character. The Master wrote *Winding Bay* in two characters. A year later, in Yangzhou’s Bay Head, he had a son. Later, when passing through Hailing, he saw the Master again. The Master said, "Go three to five *li* east of the prefecture to welcome a scholar." The next day, passing through Tongzhou, he reached Tang Bay and had another son.

Qian She-ren Xie, observing mourning for his mother, resided at Daning Temple in Taizhou. He sought a written character from the Master, who wrote *Above Brightness: Seven Luminaries, Maheśvara Heaven* in seven characters. Soon after, his residence suffered a conflagration. His son, Dongmei, once received from the Master the four characters *All Arrive Before the Emperor*. When Xie was sent as an envoy to Samhan, Dongmei accompanied him and on the same day resigned and departed.

Liu Gu, a commoner serving as Proofreader in the Classics Bureau, had long been acquainted with the Master. Once, visiting the Hall of Master Le, he asked, "Where is the True One?"
The Master pointed to the tip of the statue’s nose.
Liu silently grasped his meaning: "Le’s comings and goings are but the ebb and flow of a single *qi*."
Liu composed a poem:
*Coming, coming—asking for an empty cause,*
*Head bowed long, alone dusting the void.*
*Yet pointing to the clay dot on the nose’s tip,*
*He laughs and says, ‘Here is Master Le.’"*

Liu once slept in the kitchen with the Master, using straw as bedding. One night, the room blazed as bright as day. He saw the Master sitting with mouth agape and eyes wide, while a voice from the void said, "Xu Xi will stand and die entering the barbarian lands; Lü Huizhi will choke on a goji berry husk." At the time, Xi was managing border affairs, and Lü was still in mourning in Weiyang—both were acquaintances of Liu. Later, Xi met with the Yongle disaster, and Lü was demoted during the Yuanyou era, only reinstated in the Jiaxu year of Shaosheng.

When Attendant Lü Yirou had not yet passed the imperial examination, his father visited the Master, who said, "Fifty-four is auspicious," and also, "Second place." Later, Yirou indeed ranked second in the examinations, and fifty-four was his generational order.

Wang Zhongjing, a Gentleman for Consultation, sent someone to request a written character. The Master wrote *□*; when pressed again, he said, "Hasten into the Dao—you may not have time." That year, Zhongjing died.

Sun Sheng, upon completing his term as Assistant Magistrate, bid the Master farewell. The Master said, "While in office, wear the *fei*." Later, though offered two appointments, he declined both. When a general amnesty was granted, he was appointed *fei* as an Imperial Censor.

Wang Hefu requested a written character. The Master wrote *Three Mountains*, and later he became Supervisor of Songshan’s Chongfu Abbey.

Lin Chuchu, in the capital, saw a written character by the Master in the possession of Jiang the Daoist of Taizhou. Lin burned incense before the Master’s portrait, prayed, and drew lots, receiving *Returning to the Five Constants*. Later, he was appointed Professor of Changzhou, serving a full five-year term.

Liu Gu’s son-in-law, Jiang Jing, a Gentleman for Consultation, visited the Master during the Yuanfeng era. He recalled, "At first, I saw the Master on the altar platform. Observing his posture and demeanor, he seemed human. But perceiving his spirit and bearing, he was one of those anciently said to wander with the Creator. I stood in silent awe, craning my neck to divine his intent. The Master was sweeping the floor and simply raised his broom in response. I bowed, and he shouldered the broom and descended the altar. Thus, I knew him as one who truly embraced the One without loss, discerning fortune and misfortune without divination."

Fan Tuiguan Qian sent a letter to Li Nangong but received no reply for a long time. Doubting, he asked the Master, who wrote *Stone*. Days later, Nangong entrusted Qian with cash, delegating it to Shi Pi.

Li Zhide, a poet and scholar of the *Fa Yan*, asked the Master about having no sons. The Master said, "Better to buy a position in the Ministry of Rites than to wait for a gift," and wrote *Kong Meng* in two characters. Later, Li indeed had two sons.

Li, en route to serve as Magistrate of Yancheng in Chuzhou, saw the Master, who said, "When your term ends, wear the *fei*." Soon after, during the general amnesty of the Yichou year of Yuanfeng, he changed his mourning attire and was granted the *fei* on the very day he handed over his seal.

Zhou Yu passed the imperial examination in the third year of Xining and remained in the selection pool for a long time. One day, seeing the Master, he received the two characters *Eight Capitals*. Though Zhou knew of the phrase "eightfold alignment with the numinous" in the classics, he did not understand. The Master said, "This refers to the convergence of names." That year, he was appointed Acting Constable of Suqian County in Huaiyang Commandery. After capturing bandits, he was promoted to Collator in the Imperial Library. The selection rank was the seventh grade, and the capital rank was the eighth.

In the early Yuanyou era, Palace Guard Wang Sheng, escorting a transport, sought an audience with the Master. The Master said nothing but instructed him to drink three cups of water.

Unable to drink, he declined. The Master said, "If you cannot drink three cups of water, how could you drink from a river of other things?" Overcome with awe, Wang Sheng dared not conceal anything. It turned out his wife, née Li, was jealous and had drowned a maidservant in water, intending to perform a Daoist ritual to absolve the deed. The Master said, "This will do well."

That night, after the ritual was completed, Wang Sheng and his wife both dreamed of the drowned maidservant, who said, "The divine elder has delivered me—my grievance is released."

Grand Master of the Palace Ceremonies Zhang Andao, retired and afflicted with an eye ailment, sent a messenger bearing incense to request a written talisman. The Master inscribed four characters: *Returning Deer, Liu Xuan*, alluding to the classical phrase "returning robber, flowing mystery." Zhang wrote in thanks, saying, "Upon receiving these four characters and grasping their meaning, I shall burn my salary records. May all the greed and stinginess accumulated over countless kalpas vanish with this flame." Thereafter, his eye ailment gradually improved.

Minister of Personnel Lü Jifu, having completed his mother’s mourning period in the early Yuanyou era and been assigned a regional post, heard of impeachment charges against him and sought a written instruction from the Master. The Master wrote two characters: *Establish Staff*. Lü said, "With exile looming, how could I dare hope for such an honor?" The Master replied, "You will ultimately establish your staff."

Soon after, he was demoted to Vice Military Commissioner of Jianning Commandery. When the Shaosheng era began, he was recalled to command Yan’an, and shortly thereafter appointed Military Commissioner of Baoning Commandery with the title of Grand Master for Palace Counsel. When Lü first came to pay respects, the Master looked at him and said, "Guard well, guard well"—all understood this as a warning to safeguard his wealth and rank. Later, when he was assigned to a princely fief, he firmly declined, and was instead sent to Shanzhou, which corresponded to the "guard" in *Shan Guard*. Through successive demotions, the Master’s admonition to "guard well" proved apt.

Lü once received a written character from the Master, which read: "Within the Northern Capital’s Spring and Music Bureau, ten thousand ghosts gather—all seek to block the human ranks and sever the Gate of Life." Later, Lü was demoted from Yan’an.

When Grand Councilor Su Zizhan was first appointed Prefect of Dengzhou, he came to request a character. The Master wrote: *come, king, guard, three*. Su then asked about the essentials of Daoist cultivation, to which the Master replied: *"Leisurely delight."* Su later consulted a Daoist priest for an interpretation of the characters. The priest said: "The scriptures speak of *crimson writings and jade characters*—an imperial decree is the king’s command. You wrote *come* with the character for *king*, so an imperial summons will soon arrive." Indeed, Su was soon recalled to serve as Academician of the Dragon Diagram Hall, then sent out again to govern Yangzhou.

Doubtful of the Master’s words about *"leisurely delight,"* Su sent another messenger to request a character, but the Master refused to write. Later, when exiled to Huizhou, Su dispatched his son Guo to ask again. The Master did not receive Ziyou, saying only: "My elder brother trusted my words but could not put them into practice."

Su Huangmen Ziyou, from Jixi, sent someone to request a character. The Master wrote: *"The time has come to extinguish the self and pass through the Great Yin."* Soon after, Ziyou was recalled, rising through the ranks to Vice Director of the Chancellery. At the end of the Yuanyou era, he was sent out to govern Yuanzhou. He sent another messenger to inquire, and the Master wrote: *"Recite the scriptures ten times over—virtue and merit will descend at once."* To the messenger, he added: "Ten in the past, ten in the present." Upon hearing this, Ziyou said: "Long ago, he told me that in the *xu* year I would have much fortune, and in the *you* year much misfortune. Could there truly be a rebirth after ten years?" Before reaching Yuanzhou, he was transferred to the southern frontier. Only at the end of the Yuanfu era did he return.

Daoist Pan Fengzhen, who had repeatedly failed the scripture examinations during the Yuanyou era, received four characters from the Master: *"thirty-two days."* When he passed the exam later that year, he was thirty-two years old.

Jiang Wei, a candidate from Sanqu, wished to change his name to Ru Zhen. He came to see the Master but had not yet spoken when the Master said: "Your surname is Jiang—remove the *gong* radical and add the *nü* character, and it will be excellent." Jiang changed his name accordingly and later passed the imperial examination.

Attendant Gentleman Liu Yuan, who during the Yuanyou era had been exiled with his father, requested a character and received: *"hold jade, grasp the tally."* Soon after, both father and son were recalled. Liu was appointed Director of the Eastern Palace Gate Office, while his father became Director of the Palace Domestic Service. The scriptures contain the phrase: *"holding records, grasping registers, they approach the emperor’s presence."* The Master had replaced *records* with *jade* and *registers* with *tally*, for both men were eunuchs of high rank, serving as military commissioners *ad interim*.

A teaching assistant from Suzhou named Chen sought a character, but the Master refused to write. Instead, he berated Chen repeatedly and ordered a large goblet filled with water to be drunk. After several rounds, Chen begged to stop, unable to drink more. The Master said: "If you cannot drink this, how will you drink the waters of the lake?" (For Chen had once profited from another’s misfortune, showing no mercy when the man drowned.) Terrified, Chen prostrated himself and confessed: "You have borne both wealth and fate to this point—how could one so unrepentant be taught?" Chen then entered the Daoist path.

A military officer serving as a frontier commander, whose family had long received no news, came to request a character. The Master wrote: *"double house."* Soon after, a funeral announcement arrived: the officer’s coffin was being escorted home. Only then did he understand that the two characters meant *"a corpse arrives from a thousand miles away."*

Commandant Qi, who sought a character in the *xinsi* year of the Yuanyou era, received the character *shame*. Qi’s mother had been born in the *chou* year, and within ten days, she died. When Qi saw the Master again, he was given the character *envy*. Soon after, Qi himself died. For the upper part of *envy* is *yang*, and the lower part is *next*—*yang* signified the *wei* year, and *next* meant one would follow another.

When Prefect Zhou Deng of the commandery first took office, his boat stopped at Sishang. The Master sent him a letter. Upon opening it, Zhou found only the words: *"kill people, set fires."* Three days after arriving at his post, the commandery saw three bandits—one a murderer, two arsonists—all captured.

In the *guiyou* year of the Yuanyou era, a candidate from Jiangling visited the Master, who said: "This year, eight mouths will pass the examination." When the results were announced, eight names on the list contained the character *mouth*.

A candidate from Gusou traveling to the capital requested a character. The Master said: "Have no worries—the land spirit of Huating has already prepared to welcome you." That year, the candidate passed and was assigned to the Huating registry.

Attendant He Xuan had a relative who insisted they visit the Master together. He Xuan was reluctant, saying: "Does one not know oneself?" Yet he went. At first sight, the Master said to him: "Sir, do you not know yourself?"

In the Yuanyou era, Chen Gu led a group to craft a ceremonial canopy and present it to the Eastern Peak. He invited the scholar Hao Ting to join him. Hesitant, Hao sought a character and received: *"dwell."* Chen said to him: "Dwell is an omen of peace." After the ceremony, on their return to Gaoyou, Hao fell ill and died. Chen transported his coffin home, only then realizing that *dwell* meant *"a corpse returns in an ancient cart."*

In the Yuanyou era, the imperial son-in-law Zhang Dunli memorialized the throne about the Master’s reputation, and the emperor bestowed upon him a purple robe and the title *Master of Perfect Penetration*. The Master declined them, continuing to wear his usual attire.

The Master once wrote a gatha for the assembly:
*"Heaven and earth—a foot’s span,
The four seas—a single drop.
Blink your eyes once,
And all traces vanish."*

He also wrote poems:
*"Gazing afar at South Village’s tranquil scene,
The fields of those before are reaped by those behind.
If those behind take no joy in their lot,
Still others will come to reap after them.*

*Time flows like water in haste—
Seize the moment and rest when you may.
Children and grandchildren have their own fortunes;
Do not toil for them like ox or horse.*

*Wealth and poverty each have their causes,
Predestined by past karma—do not force your fate.
If you never sowed in springtime,
How can you expect a harvest from barren fields?*

*South Village, North Estate—flowers before your eyes,
Fine sons and daughters—do not boast in vain.
When I die one morning,
All will belong to Zhang the Third or Li the Fourth."*

In the fourth year of the Yuanyou era, a clerk of the commandery named Chen Deyi went missing. The magistrate of Hailing, Li Yuangui, issued a document setting a one-month deadline for his recovery. Chen sought a character, and the Master wrote: *"talent."* On the day before the deadline, Chen was found on the official road outside the gate. That day was the eleventh of the eleventh month—the month’s cyclical sign was *zi*. Adding *zi* to *talent* formed *exist*, and *eleven* formed *at*.

In the Yuanyou era, a registered household of Yangzhou named Zhong Jing suddenly died. As he was about to be encoffined, he revived and said: "At first, I was summoned to the netherworld, but after verification, I was released to return." Midway, the escorting ghost-official asked, "How will you thank me?" Jing replied, "I have only a vegetarian certificate." The official said, "This will do." He exchanged it for a slip of paper and took it away with delight. Upon reviving, Jing held a small paper in his hand, inscribed with two faint lines of fine script—indecipherable. He showed it to the Master, who said, "This is a netherworld promissory note. It reads: *One vegetarian certificate, worth five hundred strings of cash.* Return quickly to buy paper money and burn it along with the note."

A man of Haimen in Tongzhou, Hao Qing, was passing through Hailing while trading dried fish. He sought a character and received *forbid*. Qing thought, "What prohibition could there be for dried fish?" Yet upon reaching Qiantang, he encountered bandits who plundered all his goods. Later, the thief was captured—Lin Xiao’er.

The Daoist Li Bashi, styled Shourou, was skilled at interpreting the Master’s characters. In the early Yuanyou era, he traveled to Yangzhou to hold a Dragon Flower Assembly, where Daoists and layfolk treated him with the reverence due the Master. Suddenly, the Master wrote a character on a slip of paper, folded it, and gave it to Xu Daozheng, saying, "Wait until Li Bashi returns, then give this to him." Several days later, Li returned gravely ill. Xu handed him the paper, which read: *Already summoned to the Northern Netherworld by Deng.* Shourou repeatedly cried, "I am guilty of death!" and soon died.

The Right Palace Attendant Jia Bin, during the Yuanyou era, sought a character and received *Feng*, with four dots added beneath it. Later, he was appointed to oversee the postal relay stations of four prefectures: Zhang, Quan, Fu, and Xing.

The Gentleman for Court Audiences Zhou Jing, in the late Yuanyou era, fell ill with a chill. He dreamed of an old man who gave him medicine, saying, "I have come especially to save you." Upon waking, his illness was much improved—though at the time, he had not yet met the Master. Later, at the home of Academician Qiao Zhizhong, he first saw the Master’s portrait and realized it was the man from his dream. In the Bingzi year of the Shaosheng era, he visited the Master, who, upon seeing him, bowed and said, "After such a long separation, are you well?" Only then did Zhou recall that his illness years before had been cured by the Master’s intervention.

The Chengdu Daoist Sai Gongchen, in the winter of the Wuchen year of the Yuanyou era, transcribed the *Biography of the Divine Master* written by Jia Shansiang and sought a character from the Master. At first sight, the Master said, "Why trouble yourself with biographies? Human life is full of unnecessary affairs. First compose a hymn, and I will write a character for you." Gongchen’s hymn read:
*"Divine Master, Divine Master,
Like the moon filling the sky.
Not gazing with the eyes,
Yet illuminating all without end."*
The Master then wrote the four characters *longevity, virtue, movement, scripture* and said, "Your parents are at peace—no need to ask. The *virtue* character refers to your mother, née He, whose hidden virtue brings you fortune. *Movement* means movement; stillness leads to extinction. The *scripture* character lacks craft—you must cultivate diligence."

Jia Shi received the two characters *earth spirit*. Indeed, he had once dreamed of being granted a talismanic mandate, appointing him as the earth deity of the Supreme Clarity Palace in Bozhou.

Before taking vows, the monk Zhitong visited the abbey to request ordination. The Master asked him, and the Master said, "You may become a monk." He wrote the character *Chen* and gave it to him. Later, Zhitong was ordained at Zifu Temple by the elder Daoyuan, whose secular surname was Chen. Afterward, he returned to thank the Master, who said, "Zifu Temple is now desolate, but in the future, someone will rebuild it—there will be more pavilions, halls, and towers." He then wrote the character *Dao* for him. Zhitong thought *Dao* was his master’s name. After Daoyuan’s death, his successor was Fadao, who extensively renovated Zifu Temple, making it resplendent. Twenty-eight years later, an edict ordered each prefecture to convert its finest temple into a Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Longevity Palace. The prefecture selected Zifu Temple, and the abbot was the Great Master Daoqing, styled Yin Ruoshen. The pagoda was renamed the Tower of Dense Rosy Clouds, and all halls, gates, and corridors were renewed. The Master’s words were fulfilled.

The Grand Master Chen Xiang, while serving as vice-prefect, presented the Master with a poem:
*"Morning after morning, I carry a broom by my side;
Evening after evening, I sweep my chamber.
Sweeping without cease, day and night,
When the dust is cleared, the true immortal emerges."*

The Presented Scholar Zhou Huo, in the eighth year of the Yuanyou era, failed the provincial examination and sought a character. The Master wrote *cultivate*. Three years later, Lu Nongshi, the prefect of Taizhou, recommended Zhou. He was selected.

The Changzhou man Liu Dao, during the Yuanyou era, came to leave the household life. The Master said, "You should not stay here." He wrote the three characters *nine, sun, qian*, with *sun* on the left. Several years later, Liu became a Daoist at the Nine Luminaries Courtyard of the Establishing Prosperity Abbey in the capital. The scriptures contain the phrase *the nine suns guide qian*.

Jiang Jiang, during the Yuanyou era, visited the Master with a group of people. The Master singled out Jiang and gave him a slip of paper, saying, "You will find use for this character." It was *bury*. Li Bashi interpreted it: "Could there be two burial matters left unfinished?" One was born in the *mao* hour, the other in the *si* hour. Jiang wept and said, "Indeed, my parents’ burials have not been settled—I was born in *mao* and *si*." That very day, he hastened to inter them without delay.

Yao Wenzhi of the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou had not yet met the Master.

In the early Yuanfeng era, an old man suddenly knocked at the door, holding only a broom. He said, "I am Xu the Second Elder from Taizhou. There is a broom growing in your back garden—go and see it." Yao accompanied the Master to the garden, where the Master pointed to a spot and said, "This is my broom." Yao followed his gaze and saw a single shoot of *nie* bamboo, shaped like a broom. When he turned back, the old man had vanished. He returned to see the Master, who appeared just like the old man he had met, though the Master had never left.

The Master said, "That place is suitable for building a hermitage to cultivate the Dao. One day, you may seek to renovate the abbey there." Yao then built a hermitage where the bamboo broom grew, painting the Master’s image to honor with incense and fire. Whenever he had doubts, he prayed to it, and all proved efficacious. By the Yuanyou era, he came to build the Three Clarities Hall.

Yao Wenzhi planned to relocate his parents’ graves. He first found a low-lying site, then a high one, but could not decide between them. He took a handful of soil from each, sealed them in his sleeve, and went to ask the Master. Before he could speak, the Master said, "Use the low ground." Yao took out the two soil pouches, and the Master pointed to one, saying, "This soil is fine." He checked the seal—it was from the low site.

Qian Duanshu’s sister was childless. Duanshu brought her to see the Master, who wrote the four characters *Yuanshi Shangdi* (Primeval Lord of the Dao). His sister said, "I understand now—I will only bear a daughter." Later, this proved true, for the character *shi* (始) contains *nü* (女, "woman") within it.

During the Yuanyou era, Wang Wei, not yet an official, came to see the Master. The Master immediately called out, "Officer Wang, do not worry about your future." To a Daoist, he said, "Please take the officer to the abbot’s quarters for tea." When Wang saw the Master again, the Master patted his back and said, "When you become a prefectural official one day, remember to look after the abbey’s affairs." Wang merely assented. Twenty years later, he became an assistant magistrate in Taizhou. At that time, the abbey’s abbot was involved in a legal matter, sent to the judicial office. Wang recalled the Master’s words and devoted himself to the case.

A man from Hangzhou named Fan Xiaowu brought a courtesan surnamed Lü to ask the Master for a written divination. The Master wrote in large characters: *"Lü has no husband; Fan has no wife."* Both were terrified and left.

Ji Tiancong from Rugao owed a tea merchant three hundred strings of cash. The merchant sued him in court. Unable to repay, Ji hanged himself in his bamboo grove but was saved by a man named Ding. The merchant, hearing of this, took pity and asked the court to extend the deadline. From then on, Ji’s livelihood recovered. Later, he repaid the merchant five hundred strings, but the merchant refused the excess and departed.

Ji later fell ill and refined *qiushi* (autumn stone) for consumption. At the end of the Yuanyou era, he visited the Master, who said, "Are you not Ji the Third?" He struck Ji’s cheek and rebuked him: "Why do you consume such filth? Do you remember the bamboo grove? It was no different then—what more was there to cling to?" Ji awakened and begged to stay at the abbey to serve the Master. The Master agreed, saying, "You may do me a great service by accumulating small acts of goodness." He then ordered Ji to work with Yao Wenzhi as a supervisor to build the Three Clarities Hall and renovate the abbey’s structures.

In the fifth year of Chongning, Ji fell ill in the seventh month and asked the Master for consecrated water. The Master refused and asked, "What is your surname?" Ji replied, "Ji (籍)." The Master asked, "How is *ji* written?" Ji said, "Bamboo radical above *lai* and *xi*." The Master said, "Just use *xi* (昔). If you add *yi* (夕) to it, you get *xi* (夕)—hurry home." Ji died sitting upright on the twenty-first night, which was a *jisi* day. For *xi* (昔) denotes the twenty-first day, and adding *yi* (夕) to *ji* (己) means death.

One day, the Master said to the Daoists renovating the abbey, "Go quickly to Zhenzhou to buy timber." They followed his instructions and arrived in Zhenzhou. Asking around, they were told, "This morning, a large raft of timber arrived, priced at 1,600 strings. The Changlu monks offered 1,500, but the merchant has not sold it yet." The Daoists matched the price and secured the timber—the Changlu monks arrived too late.

Deng Yan, a scholar from Xiuzhou, sought a divination from the Master during the Yuanyou era while preparing for the imperial examinations. The Master wrote four characters: *yang yi xi ji* (羊一夕已). That year, Deng did not pass. He died in the *xinwei* year.

Cheng Ruoqing, a *baolu* attendant to the imperial chambers, was initially among a group where no one recognized his worth. During the Yuanyou era, he bid farewell to the Master to return to Qianshan. The Master saw him off with a poem:
*"A patched hemp robe with knotted corners,
A molting phoenix is no match for a chicken.
Though clams and oysters lack color,
Inside lies a pearl unknown to others."*
Twenty years later, Cheng and the Master were summoned together to the Upper Clarity Palace and granted the title *Baolu Xiansheng* (Master of the Precious Register).

Prefect Liu Yi sent someone to ask the Master for a written divination. The Master wrote three characters: *lin xia ren* (林下人, "one who dwells beneath the forest"). Liu rejoiced, saying, "I follow the Dao. Last night, I dreamed of two youths drinking milk—I now know I am a *lin xia ren*." Later, he died in Chuzhou.

Prefect Xiong Gao’s elder brother, a *daizhi*, had come seeking medical treatment and intended to return to Poyang.

Xiong Gao asked the Master for guidance, who wrote the character *ding* (丁). He said, "This can also be a *ding*. If you take the character *xia* (下) and lift its foot, it becomes *ding*. Add a mouth, and it becomes *ke* (可). If you add a person, what character would it be?" He then asked, "Why can this character not be used?" The Master replied, "Only by adding three strokes would it be permissible." Several days later, Xiong Gao returned to request another character, and the Master wrote *dao yan ci* (道言此, "the Dao speaks this"). Later, news arrived that his elder brother had died at Dingzi River in Zhenzhou, and his youngest son passed the following day. Thus was verified the meaning of the *dao* character missing two strokes, and the subtle foreshadowing of Dingzi River.

Registrar Liu Bian had once falsified an autopsy report, and the prefect sought to settle the matter. He came to see the Master, intending to depart in the first month. The Master said, "Next year, in the first month." Liu did not take this seriously. Coincidentally, Transport Commissioner Li Cong issued a document to the prefecture, detaining him for impeachment, and he was only able to leave in the first month of the following year.

Lin Dan, Director of the Palace Administration, served as the Huainan Transport Commissioner and requested a written divination. The Master wrote: *shang shang dang dang □ ling* (上尚当党□陵, "above, esteem, ought, faction, □, mound"). Only the □ character had an extra stroke. Later, Lin was transferred to Hedong as Transport Commissioner and died in Shangdang.

The Venerable Master Foyin Liaoyuan of Jinshan Monastery sent a letter to the Master. The Master did not open the seal but simply said, "All is well." On the envelope, he wrote fourteen *jin* (金, "gold") characters, arranged in pairs, and instructed the messenger to take it back. Later, another messenger came seeking a written divination, and the Master wrote *er qi fo* (二七佛, "two sevens, Buddha"). Foyin resided at Jinshan for fourteen years.

Liu Gu, a commoner from Jiangyin, faced a lawsuit in the winter of the *gengwu* year of the Yuanyou era (1090), when villagers were incited to accuse him over a land dispute. The case was referred to the Huai-Dong Surveillance Commission. Fearing disaster, Liu Gu came to see the Master, who wrote seven *tian* (天, "heaven") characters: three in a row, and one appended below the other six. Liu silently grasped the meaning, changed his surname to Huangfu, and fled to Mount Lu. Once, he stayed at the home of his son-in-law, Jiang Jing, an official in Anren, Raozhou. The Huai-Dong Surveillance Commission learned of this, and an imperial edict ordered Jiang’s punishment. Liu escaped, and three years later, in the Shaosheng era (1094–1098), the land dispute was resolved in his favor, and Jiang was pardoned by imperial grace.

In the fourth month of the *jiaxu* year of the Yuanyou era (1094), the Master secluded himself and refused to go out. Daoist followers entreated him, saying, "Wait until the era name changes, then come out." Several days later, the era name was indeed changed to Shaosheng.

Academician Wang Mingsou once received a written divination from the Master. Upon opening it, he found the character *lü* (吕) written as □. After this, he lost a young son and an elder daughter. He sent another messenger to ask the Master, who wrote *ji qiu shuang jiang* (季秋霜降, "late autumn, Frost’s Descent"). Later, Wang was appointed Vice Minister of Justice in the ninth month.

At the beginning of the Shaosheng era, a candidate from Hailing asked the Master about his examination prospects. The Master said, "Vice Minister Lu will come, and the entire city will wear green." In the subsequent examination, He Chang, Yan Bang, Guo Guan, Zhang Zhichang, Li Bin, and Guo Yuanyu passed. When Lu Nongshi, the prefect, hosted a banquet for them, Palace Attendant Zha Yingchen composed a poem containing the lines: *"I await the day Huang Ba is summoned as minister; / You must believe the words of Elder Xu are divine."*

Before Li Bin passed the imperial examination, his mother, Madame Jiang, asked the Master for a divination. Upon seeing her, the Master immediately said, "This year is not prosperous; your ancestors possess hidden virtue." Madame Jiang asked again, and the Master replied, "Come back when the Wood element is flourishing." That year, Li Bin received a recommendation. Madame Jiang visited the Master again, who said, "Now is the time when Wood flourishes." Li Bin indeed passed the examination.

In the *bingzi* year of the Shaosheng era (1096), Shang Shizhi traveled to Weiyang for the examinations and asked the Master for guidance. The Master said, "I carry my own burden, yet there is one born in the *hai* year accompanying me." That year, Shang passed the examination, and the top candidate from Hailing, Wang Shan, shared the same *xinhai* birth year as Shang.

In the Shaosheng era, Xia Rishi, a Daoist priest at Tianqing Abbey in Suzhou, requested a written divination and received the characters *shang wen san shi san* (上闻三十三, "reported above, thirty-three"). At the time, he was twenty-five years old and died eight years later.

The scholar Lu Biaomin visited the Master, who said, "I give you the character *shi* (實, "truth")," but when Lu looked, it was written as *yin* (寅). The Master added, "This is not for you; it is for your father." Soon after, Lu’s grandmother passed away.

Magistrate Liu of Rugao, Registrar Cai of Hailing, and Constable Chen of Xinghua visited the Master together. The Master wrote the character *shi* (矢, "arrow"). Turning to Liu, he said, "Add a mouth to make *zhi* (知, 'knowledge')." To Cai, he said, "Add *ju* (巨) to make *ju* (矩, 'rule')." To Chen, he said, "Add *dou* (豆) to make *duan* (短, 'short')." Shortly afterward, Chen fell ill and died. Liu was habitually cunning, so the Master admonished him. Cai, whose given name was Juhou ("Residing in Thickness"), later became an attendant official.

Jiang Daogan, suffering from illness, sought a written divination. The Master wrote *meng* (萌, "sprout"), and he died on the tenth day of the tenth month.

A clerk’s wife from the prefecture came to see the Master. Before she could speak, he rebuked her, saying, "What face do you have to come here? Even returning what you stole would be too late." The woman left in terror. The next day, she was arrested by the authorities, for several days earlier, she had murdered a girl from the Xing family to steal her clothes.

Shang Shizhi visited the Master due to a minor illness. The Master spoke to him, saying, "The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two give birth to the Three; the Three give birth to the myriad things." As he saw him out, he repeatedly called for *ma ya xiao* (馬牙硝, "sodium sulfate"). His tone seemed to carry a warning or admonition. Upon returning home, a physician prescribed medicine that included sodium sulfate.

Transport Commissioner Zhang Zu requested a written divination, and the Master wrote *long* (珑, "gem"). Zhang remarked, "A dragon in the earth is like a fish out of water, and *long* resembles a tomb." Soon after, he fell ill and died.

Cao Shunyuan, a judicial officer, visited the Master and received the characters *fu fu yan shi* (夫夫檐石, "husband, husband, eaves, stone"). His household had two pregnant women. The scriptures contain the phrase *"bearing the weight of heaven and carrying stones,"* and *fu* (夫) signifies two persons.

Acting Professor Bao You and Legal Clerk Wu La visited the Master. The Master said, "The two officials are well-versed in the Three Teachings." Wu replied, "It is precisely because I am not well-versed that I hope the Master will point me toward one gate." The Master said, "There is the Gate of Perfect Penetration and the Gate of Prajna." He then expounded on the Three Teachings. Wu asked, "Though this is so, which gate should I enter?" The Master replied, "If you are well-versed in the Three Teachings, why do you ask which gate to enter?"

One day, when several officials were preparing a Daoist ritual, they arrived at the abbey concerned that the funds they had brought might be insufficient. They wished to increase the amount.

The thought had not yet settled when he went to see the Master. The Master abruptly said, "If you are to relinquish, then relinquish—why ask further?" Acting Professor Bao visited the Master, who asked, "What character is formed when water is added above the character *nei* (内)?" Bao replied, "There is no such character." The Master then asked, "What if water is added below *nei*?" Bao said, "There is no such character either." The Master asked again, "What if water is added to the side?" Bao answered, "*Rui* (汭)." The Master laughed and said, "This character is precisely what we need today." Later, when Bao returned, the Prefect summoned him to dine at the Western Tower. As he took his seat, he saw on the wall a poem left by Dongpo, in which the character *rui* (汭) appeared, coinciding with the day’s events.

One day, at the home of the wealthy man Yang Gongzuo of Shanyang, an unusual fragrance was detected. Suddenly, an old man carrying a broom passed through the courtyard. At that moment, the Daoist nun Xu Daosheng of Huaiyang was present. Startled, Yang asked about him, and Daosheng said, "This is the Divine Elder Xu." Yang stepped forward to bow, but the old man had already vanished, leaving only a wooden *dou* (斗) on the ground. Yang then went with Daosheng to see the Master, who confirmed that the old man was the one they had encountered. When asked about the *dou*, the Master said it was the *dou* from the pillar of the Three Officials Hall. He added, "We wish to repair this hall." Yang Gongzuo donated several hundred thousand coins to rebuild it.

At Gaoyou, Sang Zhengguo was preparing to take the imperial examination and sought the Master’s counsel. The Master wrote three characters on a yellow-green slip: *huang lü jian*. The scriptures speak of *huang xian bai jian*, but the Master omitted *bai* ("white") and replaced *xian* ("thread") with *lü* ("register"). That year, Sang indeed passed the examination.

Hu, the Registrar, was attending his father when the elder retired from office and returned to Taizhou. The Master said, "This Registrar Hu is like Registrar Pan." Earlier, Pan had also attended his father in retirement and returned home, whereupon his father passed away. Soon after, Hu’s father likewise died.

Zeng, the Revenue Officer, visited the Master on the Double Ninth Festival. As he took his leave, he said, "I shall call again in the spring." The Master replied, "We shall meet on this day next year." Zeng was delayed by affairs, and when he returned, it was indeed the Double Ninth of the following year.

Old gardener Feng Wang had the Master’s portrait painted in his home and daily offered food and drink before it. One day, he forgot the offering, but the next morning, he carried a bundle of radishes to the temple storeroom. Seeing him, the Master said, "You treated me well—I would have gone hungry yesterday had I not received a meal from the Qian family." The Qian family, too, made daily offerings of food.

A young man of the Sun family visited the Master, who wrote three characters: *ri xia ren* ("man beneath the sun"). He added, "Return home at once—today, an imperial messenger has received this same message." Sun hurried home, fell gravely ill, and died beneath the sun.

Magistrate Zhang Lian, having been dismissed from office, was seeking a boat when he came to see the Master. The Master wrote two characters: *Ji Shui* ("Auspicious Water"), saying, "Proceed as you intend." Zhang went to see the prefect, who told him, "I have just assigned Zhou Yong’s boat to another." *Ji Shui* was indeed Zhou Yong’s name.

Vice-Director Zheng, bringing his family to see the Master, had a daughter who had just come of age. The Master suddenly remarked, "Neither mother nor daughter may linger—the mother clings to the daughter, and the daughter to the mother." Soon after, the daughter fell ill and died.

Vinaya monk Weiyong of Baoyin Temple, along with several monks, visited the Master. The Master turned to Weiyong, took a rush cushion as if for meditation, and said to the others, "None of you can sit as he does." The group did not understand, but later Weiyong left the monastery to reside at Baoning.

During the Shaosheng era, Tang An of Wuwei Commandery visited the Master and had his portrait painted to take home, where he honored it with incense and offerings for a long time. His daughter-in-law had a three-year-old son, and Tang dreamed the Master said, "Have this child leave home to become a monk." Upon waking, he told his wife Qin, who grew angry, deeming it an ill omen. Soon after, the child fell ill and died. Qin, enraged, cast the Master’s portrait into the river. Later, she contracted an epidemic and developed a paralyzed arm. Tang returned to see the Master, who said, "Your wife cast me into the river, as if to drown me. Yet I was retrieved from the shore at Changlu." Tang was deeply ashamed and apologized before leaving.

Later, a merchant from Tanzhou named Liu Zhen visited the Master, who suddenly said, "I must thank you for saving me." Liu replied, "Recently, at Changlu, I saw a scroll floating on the water. I retrieved it—it was your portrait."

One day, Lu Xi encountered the Master at the rear gate of the abbey. The Master asked, "What is your surname?" "Lu," he replied. The Master said, "Why not sit outside the gate? A relative is coming to visit you." He added, "In two or three days." Lu returned home, and three days later, a relative named Shi Sheng arrived, only to fall gravely ill. Lu again sought the Master, who gave him a character (□). Three days later, Shi Sheng died outside Lu’s gate.

Court Gentleman Wang Anzhong once wrote his name and birth details, seeking a divination. The Master circled the three characters of his name and wrote eight more around them: *Qing Long, Bai Hu, Zhu Que, Xuan Wu* ("Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise"). He said, "This is all you need." Later, in the capital for a grand ceremony, Wang was assigned to officiate at the suburban altar. There, he saw the four spirit banners positioned exactly where he had stood.

Another time, Wang sought a charm for water. The Master said, "No incantation is needed—on the fifth day of the fifth month, willow-branch water will suffice." Later, returning to Hangzhou, Wang’s daughter fell ill. A monk treated her by sipping water through a willow twig and reciting incantations—on that very day, the Double Fifth, the girl died.

Prime Minister Zhang Tianjue once moored his boat before Guangshan Temple in Weiyang. On the shore, he saw a Daoist’s hand emerge from a hut, plucking a comb from between his fingers to groom his hair. The man’s bearing was extraordinary. Zhang hastily invited him aboard and asked, "The one combing his hair just now—was that not a sword?" The Daoist assented. Zhang said, "May I see it?" The Daoist, as before, took a comb from his fingernail—a slender, silver-white object about three inches long. With a breath, it transformed into a sword. Zhang took it and examined it—it was indeed a sword. As they spoke, the Daoist vanished.

Later, Zhang visited the Master at Hailing and, before he could ask about the encounter, the Master handed him a slip of paper with two characters: *dong wen*. The first character, *dong* ("cave"), had its middle stroke lowered to form *shui* ("water"), while the second, *wen* ("script"), was two mouths (*kou*). Thus, Zhang knew the Daoist by the water was Lord Lü.

In his leisure, the Master often stood beside the incense cabinet. Suddenly, two beautiful women entered hand in hand, singing as they approached him. The assembly was astonished, but after a while, they departed. Two elders, Chen and Li, stood nearby and asked, "Who were they?" The Master replied, "The two immortal sisters, He and Jiang." The crowd rushed after them but saw them vanish at the gate.

When Academician Gong Shenfu was first exiled, a follower sought a divination from the Master, who wrote eight characters: *xing shi qi si bai gu cheng ren* ("Rise from the corpse, revive the dead, turn white bones into living men"). The scriptures say: *hui hai qi si* ("Return the bones, raise the dead").

The abbot of Tianqing Abbey composed a fundraising petition and asked the Master to write the heading. The Master said, "This petition will be resolved by someone with a ‘mouth’ in their name." Among those who contributed, many had the character *kou* ("mouth") in their names or surnames.

A certain Elder Li often interpreted the Master’s written characters. One day, he asked for a divination, and the Master wrote two characters: *shi fei* ("right and wrong"), but with *shi* incomplete (是□). Li could not decipher it. A Daoist named Xu said, "The Master means that in your interpretations, there is little right and much wrong."

The Master laughed.

A certain Elder Chen, who also often interpreted the Master’s written characters, once stood by his side. The Master gave him a slip of paper on which he wrote *guo du san jie* ("crossing the Three Realms"). Chen was overjoyed, saying, "The next line in the scripture reads *wei deng xian weng* ('ascend to the rank of Immortal Elder')." A Daoist named Xue Gu said, "This is not an auspicious sign." Xue Gu was ill at the time, and a crane stood in the courtyard. The Master prayed for him, saying, "*Guo du san jie*." After reciting it several times, the crane died within days. Soon after, Chen indeed passed away.

Jiangyan’s tax officer, Marshal Shen Fu, had obtained a talisman and water from the Weizhou fangshi Zhang Zigao during the Shaosheng era. He had abstained from grain for nearly two months. When he came to see the Master, the Master wrote seven characters for him: *qi shang shi shui zhi duo* ("the excess of his food and taxes"). The Master meant to warn him against abstaining from grain, but Shen did not understand. A month later, he died.

Attendant Gentleman Yuan Fu was appointed magistrate of Haimen in Tongzhou and brought his family to see the Master. Fu personally brewed a cup of tea and offered it to the Master. The Master took a sip, then returned it to Fu, saying, "You and yours should drink it all for peace and ease." Fu had not yet drunk it when, along the way, a Daoist priest arrived and bowed to him. Fu then gave the tea to his wife and children to drink. Upon returning to the boat, his family asked, "Just now, the immortal told everyone to drink the tea, but why did the magistrate not drink it?" Fu then realized he had not drunk it himself and thought nothing of it. When he arrived in Haimen, he died, while all who had drunk the tea remained safe.

In the Jiaxu year of the Shaosheng era, Tianqing Abbey held an Upper Prime Offering for three evenings, concluding on the sixteenth day of the first month. Daoists Wang Shanxiang and others were cleaning the ritual vessels in the storage when they saw a man of imposing appearance, dressed in a plain cloth robe, approach the storeroom and bow deeply. Shanxiang and the others paid him no mind, and he left. When the Master arrived, he asked, "Why did you not invite the Daoist to drink tea?" Shanxiang replied, "We were too busy." The Master rebuked him, saying, "That was Lord Lü come to visit me." Shanxiang pursued him but could not catch up.

Zhu Zongyin of Xinzhou sought a written divination to determine whether he should leave home to cultivate the Dao. The Master wrote *san jie wu di* ("Three Realms, Five Emperors") and said, "You may go to Zhenzhou." He then entered Yizhen Abbey. Later, when tested on the scriptures, he drew the characters *di lie* ("Emperor’s rank") at the beginning of the text. That year, he passed the examination. The characters he had been assigned to explain were *san jie wu di* at the top and *lie yan shang qing* ("ranked among the Supreme Clarity") at the bottom.

A candidate from Mingzhou named Qin had repeatedly failed the imperial examinations. He asked the Master, who said, "When you see Zhang Guolao crossing the sea in an iron boat, you will pass the provincial examination." Later, Qin traveled to the capital for the examination. While sitting in Jingde Temple, he saw a mural behind him depicting exactly what the Master had described. That year, he passed.

Daoist Liu Shouning was raising funds to cast a bell and asked when it would be completed. The Master said, "Only after three fires." After two failed castings, he asked the Master again, who said, "You must go to Tongzhou." He then went to Jinghai, where he found a man named Zhang Lengzi. As Zhang was about to strike the furnace, he suddenly saw the Master arrive. The crowd joyfully welcomed him, but he vanished at once. The bell was then cast successfully in a single attempt.

*The Record of Master Xu, the Serene and Harmonious Master of Emptiness and Stillness, Volume Two*

On the first day of the ninth month in the Yihai year of the Shaosheng era, the Master shut his door and did not emerge. He neither ate nor drank. When Daoists knocked at his door, there was no sound. On the seventh day of the eleventh month, Prefect Lu Nongshi arrived and ordered the Daoist overseer to knock. After a while, a faint sound was heard. Lu called out, "I have been here for some time. Since you have not emerged, the people have been deeply anxious." The Master then came out to meet him. Lu asked him about it, and the Master said, "I was attending to a minor matter."

A few days later, someone presented four purple-flowered stone pillars. While the Master had not yet emerged from his seclusion, the Daoist overseer Xu Shoujie also knocked at his door and bowed in request. After the Master came out, he said to Prefect Lu, "This vice-minister is difficult to teach." He then demanded wine. Lu suspected that, as the Master usually did not drink, his request must have a meaning. He quickly brought wine, but the Master did not drink it. Instead, he said, "This is a thing that corrupts people." Lu asked, "Is there nothing divine about it?" The Master replied, "That is not the case, but it is no different from wealth. If one does not guard against it upon reaching this point, they are difficult to teach." This was specifically to admonish Shoujie.

The Master then asked for paper and brush and wrote: *huo xian pin kong er zi, shou xin sheng duo ji, nan gan xie Tai zhou Xu Shoucheng ti xi, xiang hou qu bu de ye, jin tui jian nan, sui fa qian xin, zhui jian xian wang jiu yuan, Shaosheng er nian shi yi yue chu qi ri wei* ("Perhaps the first two characters are *pin kong* ['rank' and 'emptiness']; keeping faith brings much good fortune. Grateful for the support of Xu Shoucheng of Taizhou, but henceforth one must not act recklessly. Advancing or retreating is difficult, so I have resolved to sincerely perform a rite for the long-departed ancestors. Done on the seventh day of the eleventh month in the second year of the Shaosheng era."). In all, fifty-two characters were written. He handed them to Shoujie, saying, "You may have them today, but I will take them back in a few days." No one could understand their meaning.

Previously, at the end of the Yuanyou era, when the Three Clarities Hall was being rebuilt, the Master had told Shoujie, "You should withdraw your name and donate all your robes and alms-bowl to construct the hall." Shoujie did not comply. Now, the Master admonished him again, but he still did not understand. On the seventh day of the eleventh month the following year, Shoujie died.

A soldier from Jiangyan named Wang Li was gravely ill and near death. His wife went to the prefectural market to purchase funeral items when she encountered her neighbor, an old woman surnamed Li, and together they went to see the Master. The Master said, "The Wang family’s household affairs will become the Li family’s." Upon returning home, Wang Li’s illness was cured, but the Li family’s son died, and they used the Wang family’s coffin to enshroud him.

Wang Hui asked the Master to select a day for planting early rice. The Master said, "The second day of the sixth month is good." The Daoists said, "Is that not too late?" Hui had always trusted the Master’s words, so he returned home to wait. That year, there was a drought, and those who had planted earlier saw their crops wither. Rain fell at the end of the fifth month, so he planted on the second day of the sixth month. The harvest was twice that of a normal year.

Qu Yuan of Haimen offered the Master a large silver incense burner. The Master rebuked him, saying, "Will this not mislead other monks?" Yuan repeatedly begged to leave it, but the Master refused. Yuan withdrew and said to the Daoists, "Originally, I made this burner to offer to the Great Master Sengqie in Sishang. Now, I have instead offered it to the Master, hence his words."

The Master then saw Yuan again and said, "You need not see me. Go speak with Elder Jie instead." Yuan returned home and died of illness. Yuan had a eldest son named Yuan Zeng, styled Xiaojie, who had also died but remained unburied, so father and son lay together in the same chamber.

Han Shunyan had two sons who fell ill with an epidemic. He asked the Master, who wrote the character *sheng* (生). Shunyan was overjoyed. Later, one son died, while the other recovered. Li Bashi explained, "The one who recovered must be *chou sheng*—the character *sheng* (生) is composed of *niu* (牛, ox) and *yi* (一, one)." Shunyan confirmed this was so.

Chang Qing of Huaiyang Commandery lived in a village and was wealthy. Near his home stood a mountain, its western slopes bordering Fuli, rich in stone but of no use. One day, an old man knocked at his door and said, "This mountain holds brocade stone. If you can take it to offer to Tianqing Abbey in Taizhou, will you not achieve great merit?" Qing laughed, "How could this mountain have brocade stone?" The old man replied, "Take it and doubt not." Suddenly, the old man vanished. Qing told his wife, née Cao, who said, "Try quarrying it." Indeed, they found stone with veins like purple brocade.

Qing and his wife came to see the Master, who was the old man they had met. Before they could speak, the Master wrote *huasheng zhutian* (化生诸天, "transformed and born among the heavens") and handed it to them. Qing and his wife bowed to the Master, saying, "We have not yet transformed a single thing—why bow?" Qing asked, "What would you have us transform?" The Master said, "Stone beams and stone pillars." Qing then returned to Huaiyang to quarry them. Within a year, the work was complete. They transported the stones by sea, but encountered a violent storm. The sailors were helpless, so Qing called upon the Master for protection. Suddenly, all went dark, and in the lightning’s glow, they saw divine beings swiftly lifting the boat. The next day, the wind ceased, and they had already reached Haimen, docking at Chaiwu. Qing went ahead to see the Master, who said, "The journey was perilous. Had it not been for this, you would not have arrived so swiftly."

Geng Chun, a Gentleman for Meritorious Achievement, wished to arrange his eldest son’s marriage but received no answer after repeated inquiries. One day, the Master wrote the characters *jiao yin* (角引, "horn" and "pull") and said, "The same as your grandmother’s." Later, he married a woman from Tongzhou named Zhang, whose grandmother was also surnamed Zhang.

Tan Yong, a monk who had retired from the Stone Pagoda Monastery in Yangzhou, returned to Tianhe to bid the Master farewell. The Master wrote the character *xiang* (香, "incense") and gave it to him. Later, he resided at Xiangshan in Siming.

Zhang Sui, a wealthy man, was appointed military commissioner of Yangzhou but had not yet assumed office when he visited the Master. The Master took paper and wrote a large *wang* (亡, "death") character, adding forty-nine dots beside it. When Zhang Sui arrived in Yangzhou, he died before a month had passed. His younger brother, Cheng, also died forty-nine days later.

A great merchant of Jiangdong named Li visited the Master, who drew water and offered him several cups to drink. Li declined, saying he could not drink more. The Master said, "He drinks a whole river, yet you cannot drink a few cups?" Li, ashamed, apologized and begged to hold a grand ritual feast to atone for his past transgressions. The Master permitted it. Li had once sailed the river with another merchant, coveting his wealth. Midway, he got the man drunk and pushed him into the river.

Chen Hu, a presented scholar, had a fifteen-year-old daughter who bowed and burned incense before the Master. The Master bit her neck twice, then tried to bite her again. The girl screamed in fear and fled. That night, she hanged herself. The next morning, Hu asked the Master, who said, "This girl was entangled by a karmic debt from a past life. I intended to spit on her three times, but your daughter fled. I knew she would not escape her fate. You may examine the rope." Hu returned home and inspected it: of the three strands of the rope, two were broken, leaving only one intact.

Lu Nongshi, the Left Assistant Director, was serving as prefect of Tai when he received word that Zeng Zikai had been appointed as his replacement, though Lu had not yet received a new commission. Doubtful, he asked the Master, who said, "Minister Lu replaces Minister Zeng, and Minister Zeng replaces Minister Lu." Lu said, "I once replaced Minister Zeng in Jinling." The Master repeated his words and added, "The coast is a good place to serve." Ten days later, he was appointed to Haizhou. Later, Zikai moved from Tai to Hai, and they again replaced each other.

Lu once submitted a memorial to the court and asked the Master about it. The Master wrote the character *zheng* (郑). Then he asked, "What character is formed when you add a hand to *zheng*?" Lu said, "*Zhi* (掷, 'to cast')." The Master said, "It has been cast." Lu grew anxious. The Master said, "After three years, it will no longer be cast." When Lu left Hailing to bid the Master farewell, he asked, "How will this journey be?" The Master said, "There are many Daoists, and vegetables are expensive." Later, Lu was transferred from Hai to Cai. Shortly after, he was summoned to court and appointed a vice director. His earlier memorial, which had gone unanswered, was now addressed, leading to his promotion. Thus, the Master’s words about three years were fulfilled.

Lu once received the four characters *fu tian dan shi* (负天担石, "bearing heaven and shouldering stone"), a sign of high office. While in the capital, he sent someone to ask the Master for a written answer, who wrote *zhong lao* (终老, "to grow old"). Later, Lu was appointed prefect of Bozhou, where the Temple of the Supreme Lord Lao stood. When he fell ill, he again sent someone to ask the Master, who wrote *shang san shi er er* (上三十二二, "thirty-two or two above") and five characters in all. He added, "The two characters below form the left side of *tian* (天, 'heaven'), making *zuo cheng* (左丞, 'Left Assistant Director'). No need for the *ren* (人, 'person') character." Lu died in Bo on the twenty-second day of the third month.

Lin Ling’e sought a written answer during the Shaosheng era (1094–1098) and received the three characters *lin xia ren* (林下人, "a person beneath the trees"). In the early Zhenghe era (1111–1118), he responded to an imperial summons from Chuzhou.

When Tianqing Abbey was rebuilding the Hall of the Three Pure Ones and raising the beams, the Daoists informed the Master, who said, "The upper is done, the lower is done." Soon after, Minister Lu arrived. Looking up at the beam’s inscription, he saw it read *Daozheng Quanyuan* (道正劝缘, "The Daoist Director Exhorts Contributions"). Lu said, "This is the work of the Divine Master—what have others to do with it?" He immediately ordered the beam lowered and had the Divine Master’s name inscribed instead before raising it again. The assembly said the Master’s words had been fulfilled.

Later, the abbey was renamed Xianyuan Wanshou Palace, and a new Hall of the Three Pure Ones was constructed, with the former hall repurposed as a lecture hall. Thus, the hall plaque was taken down, and a lecture hall inscription was erected in its place. In the eighth year of the Zhenghe era (1118), the lecture hall was again converted into a hall, where the Sacred Ancestor was enshrined, and the lecture hall inscription was removed to make way for a new hall plaque.

The Daoist Kan Ruozhuo traveled to Shanyang to visit his family and bid farewell to the Master. The Master inscribed the characters *qu ye* (去野, "departing the wilds") for him. Upon reaching Shanyang, Ruozhuo passed away.

Lady Pei, the wife of Zhou Zhi, fell ill and requested a character based on her birth month. Born in the sixth month, the Master added a *shi* (十, "ten") beneath the *liu* (六, "six"), and Lady Pei ultimately did not recover.

Minister Shen Xi once sought a character, saying, "I wish to know the fortunes and misfortunes of my life." The Master wrote *dai jing wu di* (待经五帝, "await passing the Five Emperors") and added, "One cannot advance beyond this point." The character *shi* (侍, "attendant") was written as three stacked *ren* (人, "person"). Later, Shen’s son Zhao became a minister, concurrently serving as Imperial Lecturer and Imperial Reader, before being appointed to govern a prefecture.

Zhao had long consumed alchemical elixirs and preferred drinking water, unable to eat dry food. He wrote to the Master, asking if he might gradually introduce dry food to nourish himself, and awaited a reply. One night, he dreamed the Master gave him a steamed bun, urging him to eat it, but he could not swallow it after several attempts. The Master said, "You must force yourself to eat it." He managed to consume half, and the next day, he could eat dry food.

Nai Guangshun would often visit the Master, who said to him, "You live behind the city—why not move to the east side?" For three or four years, Guangshun only replied that he lacked the means to relocate. The Master grew angry, and Guangshun asked him to select an auspicious date. The Master said, "The fifth day of the fifth month is good." Later, due to a great flood, Guangshun moved his residence on the fifth day of the fifth month.

When Guangshun sought the Master’s advice on arranging his son’s marriage, the Master said, "Among eight households lighting lanterns, only yours does not—proceed with the wedding before lanterns are lit." At the time, in the neighborhood where marriages were being arranged, eight of the nine families with brides over nine years old encountered misfortune, while only Guangshun’s household remained unharmed.

Guangshun’s seven-year-old daughter suffered from convulsions. Upon seeing the Master, he was told, "Quickly ask Daoist Dai and visit Scholar Chen." Guangshun inquired, and Dai said, "I have no medicine, but I hear Scholar Chen recently compounded the Supreme Treasure Elixir, which specifically treats this illness." He went to seek it, but by the time the medicine was obtained, it was too late to save her, and administering it proved ineffective.

Upon seeing the Master again, he said, "Congratulations, though you shall not become a father-in-law." Upon returning home, the girl had already revived, and later left the household to become a Daoist nun.

There was a man named Qian Zhen who suddenly died, his heart still faintly warm. His family could not bear to enshroud him, and after five days, he revived. He recounted that at first, he was pursued by someone and brought before an official bureau where records were examined and affairs adjudicated. He was then sent to supervise road repairs east of Rugao County. Once the task was completed, an underling reported, "There is still one more road to be overseen—let this man supervise it." The official said, "Zhen is a disciple of the Divine Assembly; allow him to return swiftly." Yet they still summoned Zhen, permitting him to oversee the work. After Zhen revived, Xu Zhen had just returned from outside when he suddenly suffered a headache and died that very night.

Dianzhí Yang Gongzuo was traveling to Tiantai to oversee wine production when he came to see the Master, who wrote the characters for "Double Fifth." Later, at the age of fifty-five, he passed away, and from his encoffining to burial, another fifty-five days elapsed.

When the monk Fasheng first came to see the Master seeking to leave the household, the Master said, "You cannot become Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva; you may only become Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva." Later, he went to a monastery to leave the household and was tonsured during the scripture examination. For Avalokiteśvara wears a crown upon the head, while Kṣitigarbha alone reveals his bare topknot.

Huang Qi had no sons and sought a written prediction. The Master wrote the four characters *yuan tai ping yu*, which he interpreted as "the first month of the celestial stem." Despite this inscription, Huang Qi remained childless, for his capacity for conception and nurturing was incomplete.

Another time, someone asked the Master about his younger cousin’s illness. The Master said, "Your cousin is unwell—what can I do?" Several days later, she passed away.

When Zhai Ping fell ill, his wife inquired of the Master, who said, "A cellar, a cellar." By the time she returned home, Ping had already died, and she then realized his words referred to the character for "cellar."

A man from Zhejiang, Meng Shen, was skilled in leatherwork and wished to change his profession to seek an official career. Upon meeting the Master, he received the five characters *zhi xin yi jiu ge*. Meng understood and returned to the capital with his former craft, where his skills flourished.

Bian De went to Sishang to burn incense but, upon reaching the border, suddenly lost his way. After traveling westward over a mile, he saw countless bleached bones, as if in a place untrodden by humans. An old man called out, "This is not the path—come this way." Bian then found the official road. Upon returning to see the Master, the Master said, "You took the wrong path on your incense-burning journey."

Chen Zongshi, a Daoist of Dongling Abbey in Changzhou, had his name recorded during the Shaosheng era and sought a written prediction from the Master. The Master said nothing but merely added the character for "mountain" above the character *zong* in his name. When pressed repeatedly, the Master said, "It is only this." On his way back, Zongshi heard that Dongling Abbey lacked a resident Daoist, and the townspeople petitioned the county magistrate to appoint him for ritual purification. When the official notice arrived, his name was written as *Chongshi*. Zongshi said, "That is a mistake." The clerk replied, "It was changed to avoid the magistrate’s personal taboo."

Wang Shaoqing Shifu, during the Shaosheng era, was appointed magistrate of Poyang and sent someone to request a written prediction. He received the character for "longevity" with its mouth missing. While traveling through Jinling, his post was changed to Shouzhou. On the day he assumed office, he received the death notice of his eldest brother, which fulfilled the missing "mouth" of the character.

When Master Lü Daqing Zhifu served as Transport Commissioner and met the Master, he was given the character *ang*. Later, he was appointed prefect of Suzhou, then transferred to Mingzhou, and again to Raozhou, considering himself a three-time local governor. While in Raozhou, one day upon returning from outside, he looked up at the prefectural sign and suddenly understood the meaning of *ang*.

Lü once brought his family back to Longshu and bid farewell to the Master, who asked, "Is there a well there?" Lü replied, "There are several wells at the residence." The Master said, "Many wells are good." Upon arriving in Shuzhou, Lü encountered a conflagration.

Wu Chang sought a written prediction in the Jiaxu year of the Shaosheng era and received the three characters *san san bi*. At the time, Wu was not yet an official but had long harbored an interest in talismanic arts. In the Bingzi year, while serving his father in an official post in Jianghuai, he received the *Orthodox Tianxin Method* from Master Wang of Magu Mountain at Yanchang Abbey. Master Wang said, "I have just realized the meaning of the characters you received. In the scripture, there is a passage: 'The heart is reported to the thirty-two heavens; thirty-two bows are made; the eyes are closed in silent contemplation.' The Master concealed the secret of *Tianxin* within these three sentences: the three characters refer to the *Tianxin* secret method, and *bi* means 'secret.'"

During the Yuanfu era, Cai Chengyi Si served as the registrar of Liuhe. When he observed mourning for his mother and met the Master, the Master asked, "Where do you reside?" Cai replied, "Yizhen."

The Master said, "Come reside here, and let me heal my ailing child." The following year, Cai accordingly brought his family. His eldest son, who had been afflicted since childhood with an inability to walk, was offered to the Master as an incense attendant. The Master named him Shanren, and within a year, the boy could walk. Four years later, he accompanied the Master to the capital and became a Daoist. When Cai’s wife, née Zhang, met the Master, he wrote for her a Daoist incantation: *"In the first month, a long fast purifies the soul and spirit; the myriad qi remain everlasting, untouched by suffering; the body radiates light."* These were twenty-two characters in total, though the character for "suffering" was written as *kang*. Within days of receiving the writing, the entire household fell ill. Cai sent someone to inquire of the Master, who gave the messenger a dozen or so *linqin* fruits and a single plum, saying, "Give each person one *linqin*, but give the second mistress the plum." Those who ate the *linqin* recovered, while the one who ate the plum died.

Cai once sought consecrated water from the Master to cure Zhang’s illness. After drinking it, she recovered, and Cai offered gold and silk in gratitude. The Master refused, saying, "I require you to undertake a great act of karmic merit." When pressed further, he replied, "It will come in time." During the Chongning era, Cai brought his family to visit the Master. The Master led them to the mural of the *Scripture of Salvation*, where they beheld the transformed visages. He also inscribed on Cai’s body the four characters *"Shenjing Taiyin."* Several days later, Cai fell ill, and when he asked the Master about it, the Master said, "Performing meritorious deeds will avert harm." At that time, the Jade Emperor Pavilion was being rebuilt, so Cai pledged to raise funds from ten thousand patrons to commission statues of the Jade Emperor and the Thirty-Two Heavens. Once Cai recovered, he returned to Qiantang, where he raised funds to carve wooden statues, along with attendant figures, ritual vessels, flowers, and fruits for offering. Later, he lived seventeen more years.

Cai’s son-in-law, Tian You, visited the Master on account of his mother’s illness. The Master wrote the characters for *"mountains, rivers, forests, and trees,"* and Tian’s mother passed away. In the third year of the Yuanfu era, Quan Yanbo traveled to take the autumn examinations. Three days before the results were posted, the Master sent his disciple Zhou Xiyuan to Quan’s home with a message: "The Divine Master sends word of your success." Quan asked if there were any other instructions. Xiyuan replied, "When the Master spoke to me, he only raised his thumb." When the results were announced, Quan was selected as the top candidate.

Xie Gongju of Chengdu, a merchant, arrived in Zhenzhou during the Yuanfu era. He had sold all his goods except for a few solitary wooden boats. Unable to find buyers, he encountered an old man who said, "Why not go to Hailing and seek out Xie Xun? The salt fields there require such boats." He went to Hailing and sold them. Upon meeting the Master, he realized it was the old man he had seen earlier.

Wu Jiacheng, the magistrate of Taixing, visited the Master, who immediately concealed himself. Wu withdrew and ascended the Hall of the Three Clarities. The Master emerged and called to his attendant, saying, "Why has that official not departed?" The attendant replied, "He has not yet taken leave of the prefectural authorities." The Master said, "He cannot leave today, nor can he leave tomorrow." The next day, Wu suddenly developed a debilitating foot ailment.

When the high official Qi Zhan met the Master, the Master asked, "How old are you?" Qi replied, "Sixty-five." The Master said, "In five more years, you will be seventy." Qi died at seventy.

The loyal and steadfast military officer Pu Zhen, afflicted by wind-stroke and unable to walk, was carried in a reclining sedan to meet the Master, leaning on a staff and supported by several women to reach the hall. At first sight, the Master grew furious, saying, "You have been nourished for a thousand days as a soldier—with such infirmity, what use are you?" He struck with his staff at those supporting Pu, then struck Pu himself. Pu fled to avoid the blows, and in his haste, found himself running as if fully recovered.

Zhang Ganchu of Huaidong, bearing a compass to meet the Master, was promptly told, "Your esteemed father, the Court Gentleman for Consultation, has already secured an appointment—you are to be dispatched to Lizhou." Later, it was reported that he had indeed been assigned as the Investigating Censor of the Lizhou Circuit.

Ge Guang, suffering from an illness without sweating, sent someone to pray to the Master, who wrote the four characters *Di Yuan Yu Zhai* and gave them to him. As there was a passage mentioning *Di Yuan Yu* in the *Qi Jing*, Ge immediately went to the abbey to perform a purification ritual. By midday the next day, he had broken into a sweat and recovered.

Ge, having no sons, asked the Master, "The guardian spirit’s statue in the supervising student’s hall has been damaged. I wish to have it recast—what should its appearance be?" The Master said, "Make it a dignified and solemn countenance of a young man." Ge followed his instruction, and the following year, he had a son who resembled the statue. Later, he had two more sons, both dignified and solemn.

Zhu Zhaoyan, mourning in Qianshan, was invited by the county magistrate to oversee the local academy. He sent someone to Hailing to request a written charm from the Master, who wrote *twenty-four, twenty-four*—six characters in all. At the time, the academy had exactly twenty-four students. When the number later increased by a few, Zhu grew doubtful of the charm’s efficacy. Yet soon, some students left, and the number never exceeded twenty-four—though he never understood the repeated inscription’s meaning. An elder of the village remarked, "Previously, an official in mourning came here to oversee the academy, and the number of students never exceeded twenty-four either."

There was a certain Dong Qing who, during the Yuanyou era, had sought ordination at Tianqing Abbey but was bullied by the community and lacked the courage to proceed. One day, upon meeting the Master, who was then eating, the Master grasped his hand, carried his rice bowl, and led him straight to the latrine. The Master himself took over a hundred bamboo slips, drew water to wash them, and while cleaning, also fed Dong. Moved and enlightened, Dong bowed and said, "I wish to perform this task myself." From then on, he remained at the abbey, diligent to the end.

In the winter of the third year of Yuanyou, a street Daoist from Huaixi returned and suddenly went mad. In the bitter cold, he wore only a single layer of clothing, clutching a scroll, speaking incoherently. At times, he groaned as if being tortured, confessing his transgressions. He also carried a box and basket to the Master’s hall, spreading out their contents before him and kowtowing in supplication. The Master struck his chest several times with his fist, and the man suddenly collapsed, drenched in sweat like rain, before regaining his senses.

The Venerable Master Shi Huaisheng of Chongzhen Abbey in Jintan, a Daoist of high attainment, had once served alongside a Daoist named Li under Master Shen as a street attendant. Li had once hidden money in his shoe to test the Master. Huaisheng said, "This is not right." When they both met the Master, he exposed Li’s deception, and from then on, the Master harbored the intention to spiritually transform Huaisheng. After the Master’s ascension, Huaisheng resided at Chongzhen Abbey, where he could foretell people’s fortunes with great accuracy and composed poems and hymns with remarkable fluency. In the *dingmao* year of Shaoxing, he passed away at the age of eighty-seven. Over a year later, Zhao Deming encountered him in Changzhou as if he were still alive, only to later learn that he had long since departed.

During the Yuanyou era, as the late Emperor had no heir, he dispatched an imperial envoy bearing incense to consult the Master, who wrote the two characters *Ji Ren* in response. The envoy privately remarked, "The character *ji* consists of eleven strokes." Later, Emperor Huizong ascended the throne—it had been an auspicious omen for his imperial name.

Wang Chen, in the third year of Yuanyou, was to take the southern official examination, and his wife went to see the Master. The Master said, "Rejoice! Wang Xian—one son will suffice." That year, he passed the examination.

When Attendant Gentleman Wang Gu served as Transport Commissioner and met the Master, the Master wrote the character *xing* (行) and smiled, saying, "This character would be better with a *yu* (鱼) inside, but I fear you won’t get what you seek." Later, he was appointed Prefect of Hengzhou. He also once received the characters *five years*, and was subsequently transferred to command the forces in Guangdong.

Lü Heqing of the Ministry of Revenue, in the early years of Yuanfu, came from Weiyang to see the Master. Upon their first meeting, the Master shut his door and refused to emerge. Lü held continuous ritual feasts, and by the seventh session, the Master suddenly appeared, saying, "Thank you, Minister Lü, for your meritorious work—return home at once, and if you arrive early, there will be cause for celebration." Lü was detained for a meal by the local officials, and by the next evening, as he traveled to Yangzhou, his home had just suffered a conflagration, the flames beyond control. Had he not returned, his family would have perished.

Zhu Pang of Hezhou, a candidate for the imperial examinations, inquired of the Master in the early Yuanfu era. The Master did not respond. When Zhu pressed further, the Master said, "A scholar should write for himself—no need to ask for a character." Persisting, Zhu received this reply with a smile: "Reluctant to cease, you’ll wait until the rain soaks your head." Later, under the Huo Renzhong examination roster, Zhu passed.

Zhu Pang once brought three portraits—those of Lü the Perfected, Immortal Jiang, and Master Shen—to show the Master. Unrolling Lü’s portrait first, the Master asked, "Has he come before?" Zhu replied, "He has." "How was he received?" "As a guest from Shandong." Unrolling Immortal Jiang’s portrait, the Master asked the same. Zhu said, "She has come, though somewhat plump." "How was she received?" "As an ordinary woman." Unrolling Master Shen’s portrait, the Master again asked, and Zhu answered as before. The Master said, "He has come, and was treated as an ordinary man." "Among the three, who is superior?" "Lü the Perfected is somewhat better."

Shi Xiang of Yancheng in Chuzhou met the Master during the Yuanfu era. The Master said, "Return home quickly. In the ninth month, a Daoist will arrive—treat him well and make offerings." Shi returned home, and by mid-ninth month, while burning incense at night, he heard voices outside his door. It was a band of thieves. Realizing the Master’s words, he opened the door to welcome them, setting out wine, delicacies, gold, and silk to gift them. His household was spared from terror.

Shi had received two bottles of consecrated water from the Master. Pointing to them, the Master instructed, "Give one to your family to drink regularly. Keep the other until an epidemic strikes the village, then distribute it." Shi followed the Master’s words, storing one bottle for three years—still sealed as before. Suddenly, a great plague erupted. Shi took the water to aid the afflicted; its fragrance was extraordinary, and all who drank were cured. When the water was exhausted, a set of mouse bones, white as snow, remained in the bottle—no one knew their origin.

In the autumn of the third Yuanfu year, Daoists Xu Ruogu and Xu Ruoxu, among others, accompanied the Master through the palace corridors. The Master suddenly said to Xu Ruogu, "You must not suppress Master Xu." Xu, alarmed, stepped aside. At the time, Xu Ruogu was a monastic supervisor, while Xu Ruoxu stood among the assembly. By the Zhenghe era, Xu Ruoxu was appointed Right Street Supervisor, and Xu Ruogu became a Daoist Rectifier. In the early Xuanhe era, Xu Ruogu was granted the title of Gold Altar Gentleman, while Xu Ruoxu was appointed to the Hall of Serene Contemplation as Scripture Reciter and Left Street Registrar, later promoted to Collator of the Hall of Serene Contemplation.

At the end of the Yuanfu era, Minister Cai, stripped of his titles as *Duanming* Academician and *Longtu* Scholar, and appointed Supervisor of the Dongxiao Palace, came to see the Master. As he reached the temple gate, the Master came out to greet him. Cai requested a written character, and the Master wrote: "All arrive before the Emperor," with the character *di* (帝) having one stroke branching into two legs below. Another time, the Master sent word: "The two administrations—east and west—and the Minister of Military Affairs." By the early Chongning era, both Cai and Yuandu were summoned. Cai was soon appointed Chancellor, while Yuandu became Minister of Military Affairs.

The Master once gave Cai the characters *thirty-two heavens*. Later, Cai was appointed Vice Director of the Chancellery, promoted to Left Assistant Director, and then Right Chancellor—each appointment lasting twelve days. Yuandu once received the characters *immortal Dao, noble life*, then *illustrious minister*, and later *auspicious minister*. He was subsequently appointed Military Commissioner of the Zhaojun Prefecture and Grand Preceptor.

An Dun, the Censor-in-Chief, was initially appointed to Changsha. He came to see the Master, who only asked, "How much is your salary?" An did not understand. The Master slowly said, "You will not go to Changsha." Soon after, An was recalled to the capital. Another time, An secretly sought the Master’s counsel on a matter. The Master said, "Hasten to see the Cai brothers." At the time, the two ministers had just left the court, and An suspected the Master was jesting. Shortly after, the two were recalled to the two administrations, and An was soon appointed to the executive council.

Daoists Xu Xichun and Huang Ruohou had not yet taken monastic vows during the Yuanfu era. One day, the Master gave each a folded sheet of official paper. Upon opening them, both found the character *Chen*. In the first year of Chongning, Prefect Chen Liaoweng visited the Master and inquired of his attendants who had served the Master longest. The temple head named Xu and Huang. Chen said, "This temple’s restoration is entirely due to the Master’s divine power—why not grant these two disciples the tonsure?" He then ordered them to reside permanently and complete the ordination rites.

Master Quanzhi, the Radiant Guardian, was a Daoist register at the Tianqing Temple during the Yuanfu era. Long devoted to talismanic arts, the Master always addressed him as "Master." In the *yiyou* year, Quanzhi asked the Master about resigning his temple post. The Master said, "A fine Master." Quanzhi later traveled to Qianshan, using talismanic water to heal people. The provincial authorities reported his deeds to the court. He then hastened to the capital and was granted the title Radiant Guardian Master.

Minister Cai once brought his family to see the Master. Pointing to Lady Xu, the Master said, "The lady has fallen—help her up." No one understood. Upon reaching Qiantang, Lady Xu fell ill and did not recover. The Master once gave Cai the character *army*, and he was appointed to Yunzhou. He received the character *kun*, and was appointed to Chengdu. The character *north*? He was appointed Hanlin Academician. Chengdu is the *kun* direction, and the Hanlin Academy is the northern gate of learning.

Two days before the Lantern Festival of the third Yuanfu year, the Master struck and destroyed all the lanterns with his staff. Days later, Emperor Zhezong’s posthumous edict arrived.

Two candidates from Jianzhou, Zhu and Liu, were heading to the southern examinations. The Master wrote the character *auspicious* for each. When they reached the capital, Zhu fell ill and died, while Liu passed. Liu’s character had the *mouth* radical beneath *scholar*, while Zhu’s had it beneath *earth*—and the ink was dull.

Wu Jing, a candidate from Gusu, was taking the provincial examination. The Master wrote: "Seventy-three." When the results were announced, Wu ranked seventy-third.

*Record of Master Xu, the Void and Serene Master, concluded.*
