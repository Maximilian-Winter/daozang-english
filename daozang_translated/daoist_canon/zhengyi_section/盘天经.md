The *Pan Tian Sutra*

Lofty and luminous, it overshadows the sun, moon, and stars;
Deep and abiding, it bears the winds, rains, dragons, and spirits.

That which is lofty and luminous is Heaven. Though its nature is utterly firm, it masters through softness—meaning it moves ceaselessly in strength, revolving the Three Lights to illumine the earth below. The sovereign, emulating Heaven, should master through softness, heeding the words of the worthy and upright, honoring the hundred ministers and comforting the myriad people.

That which is deep and abiding is Earth. Though its nature is utterly yielding, it masters through firmness—meaning it stirs clouds and rain, regulates the four seasons, ripens the hundred fruits, and produces metals and stones. The minister, emulating Earth, should master through firmness, measuring civil and martial affairs, balancing rewards and punishments, exhorting the feudal lords, upholding the Five Constants, and rectifying the Three Bonds. Such is the image of the Three Powers.

Heaven suspends the Seven Luminaries, the foundation of the celestial reckoning;
Without deviation, Earth brings forth the Five Clouds, the origin of ascent and descent.

When the sovereign and king cultivate virtue, the Five Peaks remain unerring;
When generals and ministers harmonize in humility, the four seasons fall into order.
When above and below unite, timely rains descend;
When Heaven and Earth commune, the myriad things flourish.

Observe the brightness or dimness of the Dipper’s light,
Discern the waxing and waning of the moon’s hue.
When black clouds encroach upon the Dipper’s bowl, moisture will soak the coming night;
When yellow *qi* veils the Dipper’s handle, moisture will bless the morrow’s dawn.
The Dipper’s bowl is the *Dou*; if black clouds assail it, rain will fall by midnight.
If yellow *qi* obscures the handle, moisture will arrive by morning—such are the signs of the Dipper’s portents.

When clouds shroud the sky for three days yet remain murky for half a month:
If black *qi* strikes the Dipper, stretching over three *zhang* with a moist hue, rain will surely come within three days. If no rain falls, it foretells misfortune—great men will be unsettled.

Gazing across the four outskirts, if all is free of cloudy veils, yet above and below the Dipper alone hangs a misty, moist *qi*, rain will come within five days. Should the clouds be black, low, dense, and broadly spread, rain will arrive that very night.

On *wu-zi* days, the Six Dragons move like fish, bringing heavy showers.
When clouds drift like fish on *wu* or *gui* days, the *zi* trigram strays and transforms into fire. Water is one, earth is five—thus it is said: If the Six Dragons appear between the Dipper’s stars at night, or above and below the sun at dawn, and verdant, moist clouds move like swimming fish, it signals scattered showers, an omen of coming rain.

When the Dipper’s Five Images stir like a tortoise, they bring prolonged rains.
At dawn and dusk, the Dipper stands at the center of Heaven, governing the four extremities. Its kind manifests in five colors, uniting the four directions—thus it is said: If the Five Images appear between the Dipper’s stars at night or below the sun at dawn, and five-colored auspicious clouds resembling a moving tortoise appear, verdant and moist, it signals heavy rain. If black clouds blanket the sky, it foretells abundant rain.

Resembling the southern sky’s scorching fire,
Akin to the Central Peak’s swirling dust.
When observing the Dipper at night, if red clouds and yellow *qi* obscure its midst, great heat will slay men. If yellow clouds veil the sky, or gather above and below the sun and moon without great density, it portends winds and dust. The southern sky is red, the Central Peak is yellow—thus they are likened.

When white clouds veil the Dipper, fierce winds and rains will strike.
If white *qi* obscures the Dipper and spreads widely, great winds and violent rains will come.

When rosy clouds appear at seasonal nodes, farmers reap great benefit.
At the solar terms of the four seasons, the eight nodes, and the days of the six *hou*, if clouds and rosy hues emerge at dusk, it signals abundant rain for that month.

If the sky is clear on a *jia* day, the next ten days will be settled;
If clouds arise in the east, the Five Phases will cycle in turn.
On the six *jia* days, observe above and below: if no clouds veil the sky, the next ten days will be mostly clear. Green clouds foretell rain on *jia* or *yi* days; red clouds, on *bing* or *ding* days; yellow clouds, on *wu* or *ji* days; white clouds, on *geng* or *xin* days; black clouds, on *ren* or *gui* days. Thus it is said: the Five Phases cycle in turn.

The five *mao* days share the Wood phase, embodying the image of the four directions;
They follow the six *jia* days in verdancy, determining the forms and changes of all stems.
The five *mao* days are observed like the six *jia* days. If clouds veil the sun at dawn, rain will be abundant that day; if they veil it at dusk, rain will be scant that night.

When the Vermilion Crow and White Hare descend before ascending, rain will moisten the earth.
When the sun and moon open their light, the *Zuan* states: When Heaven’s *qi* descends and Earth’s *qi* has not yet risen, if thick, the sun appears purple; if thin, it appears red. For the moon, it appears white—this is the sign of coming rain. If drifting *qi* veils the sky and the sun and moon lose their color, rain is certain.

When the Pale Sun and Cinnabar Toad ascend before descending, disaster and drought will blaze.
When Earth’s *qi* rises and Heaven’s *qi* has not yet descended, if thick, the sun appears yellow; if thin, it appears white. For the moon, it appears red—this is the omen of drought. A red hue signals little rain and much dew.

When yang’s azure and yin’s green fail to meet, the scene foretells cold.
When Heaven’s *qi* has descended and Earth’s *qi* has not yet risen, and above and below have not yet merged, the sun appears blue by day and the moon green by night—this is the sign of coming cold, a portent of Heaven and Earth’s transformation.

When odd black and even blue remain unclosed, rainbows and halos may appear.
When the two *qi* ascend and descend, and above and below have merged yet remain unsealed, the sun appears black by day and the moon blue by night. If rain threatens but does not fall, it signals mist or fog, or perhaps halos and rainbows—odd yang for the sun, even yin for the moon.

If on *mao* days clouds gather at the center, the scene grows bitterly cold, and great winds will snap trees in the four directions.
On the five *mao* days, if clouds gather at the center and the scene grows bitterly cold, great winds will snap trees, and the four directions will darken. The severity is gauged by the clouds’ density—if abundant, great winds will strike repeatedly. If black clouds dominate, rain will come on *ren* or *gui* days.

If lightning flashes frequently, its absence foretells other disasters—sandstorms or sudden warfare.
If it appears, further calamities will arise.
Whenever a *mao* day arrives, if the sky’s hue shifts slightly yet no rain follows, other disasters will arise—sandstorms or sudden military upheavals—within five days.

To discern the five tones of *gong* and *yu*:
*Zi* and *wu* days govern *gong*; *mao* and *you* days govern *yu*; *chen* and *xu* govern *shang*; *ji* and *hai* govern *jiao*; *chou*, *wei*, *yin*, and *shen* govern *zhi*. By the *na yin* system, water corresponds to *yu*; earth to *gong*; metal to *shang*; wood to *jiao*; and fire to *zhi*. Should a *yu* day’s *gong*-wind or a *gong* day’s *yu*-wind arise, both portend rain. On days such as *ren-chen*, *gui-si*, *ren-xu*, or *gui-hai*, if violent winds blow at the *mao* hour—or if moisture-laden *qi* arrives from the *mao* or *you* directions—great floods will follow, swelling all rivers and filling every ditch. If the wind howls with fury, it signals the convergence of punishment and slaughter, or the rise of water-borne bandits; caution is warranted.

If a *zhi* day’s wind coincides with *chou*, *wei*, *yin*, or *shen*, it foretells fire disasters. If an *jiao* day’s wind coincides with *si* or *hai*, it foretells death, mourning, or plague. If a *shang* day’s wind coincides with *chen* or *xu*, it foretells the outbreak of war. Yang days govern external affairs; yin days govern internal matters.

To temper the six dispositions with softness and firmness:
When wind and rain arrive unseasonably, one must examine the six conditions in sequence to interpret the omens.
*Yin-wu* and *kang-zhen* presage joyous occasions and harmonious celebrations.
*Si-you* and *kuan-da* presage amicable relations between hosts and guests.
*Hai-wei* and *gong-zhu* presage the resolution of enmity and the onset of gladness.
*Shen-zi* and *gui-lang* presage encroachment on wealth, theft of goods, or sudden outbreaks of burglary.
*Hai-mao* and *yin* presage bandit raids and grievous harm.
*Chen-wei* and *jian-xie* presage the entry of wicked men into the state, or licentious violence and mutual slaughter.

If the wind is clear and not cold, the event will be minor; if it is murky and violent, tearing roofs and snapping trees, the calamity will be severe.
From *ren-zi* to *ding-si*, if the air is parched, dragons retreat and await their time; if morning clouds veil the sun in dense, low layers, rain will blanket all regions. From *ren-zi* to *ding-si*—a span of six days—each governs its allotted three-day period: *ren-zi* governs *wu-wu*, *ji-wei*, and *geng-shen*; *gui-chou* governs *xin-you*, *ren-xu*, and *gui-hai*; *jia-yin* governs *jia-zi*, *yi-chou*, and *bing-yin*; *yi-mao* governs *ding-mao*, *wu-chen*, and *ji-si*; *bing-chen* governs *geng-wu*, *xin-wei*, and *ren-shen*; *ding-wei* governs *gui-you*, *jia-xu*, and *yi-hai*. Proceeding in order, if the clouds on the governing day are low and dense, the days it oversees will see abundant rain; if the air is parched, drought will prevail. These judgments also vary by region, corresponding to the nine provinces’ astrological divisions, which are detailed later.

From *bing-zi* to *xin-si*, each day governs six successive days for divination, following the same method as before. Here, one governing day oversees five subordinate days, such as *bing-zi* governing *ren-wu*, *gui-wei*, *jia-shen*, *yi-you*, and *bing-xu*, with further details provided below.

Observe the Celestial River for serpentine surges and cloudy gatherings:
When the Silver River is crossed by pig-like formations, wind and rain will harmonize. On the six *jia* days and five *mao* days, if clouds resembling serpents or pigs traverse the Celestial River, rain will follow. If dark clouds dissipate and then re-form, wind and rain will arrive in season. Without clouds to obscure it, the plants of the current ten-day period will not flourish; if moisture-laden *qi* is seen passing, fields and gardens will be enriched.

On the six *jia* days, five *mao* days, and the water-and-fire boundary days of *ren-gui* and *bing-ding*, if dark clouds and moist *qi* cross the Celestial River—regardless of their shape—rain will come; if absent, the ten-day period will be dry and clear.

At midnight on *gui-chou* days, the hour belongs to *jia-yin*; before dawn on *jia-yin* days, the hour belongs to *chen*. If at dawn on *jia-yin* days, eastern clouds resemble a dragon, rain will fall on the *chen* day; if they resemble a horse, rain will fall on the *wu* day. The rest follow this pattern by analogy.

At the start of the month, observe the moon’s radiance:
If the moon’s glow is suffused with greenish, moist *qi*, frequent rain will mark the ten-day period; if yellow or red and dry, clear skies will prevail. On the first, second, or third day of the month, observe the moon’s color at moonrise: a greenish-black, moist glow foretells abundant rain for the month. The first day governs the first ten-day period, the second the middle, and the third the last. A reddish-yellow, dry hue foretells drought.

At dawn, watch for solitary light:
If clouds form a stationary band at the sun’s center and remain when the sun has risen three *zhang*, rain will fall frequently in all directions. When the sun has risen three *zhang* and clouds stretch like a moist band across it, this is called "yin veiling yang," a sign of frequent rain. If at dawn, black or white clouds form a moist band, it signals accumulating yin.

At dawn, discern the shapes of piled earth in the east; at dusk, watch for layered canopies in the west:
At dawn, if eastern clouds resemble piled earth or layered canopies, rising in tiers, rain will soon follow. The same holds if such formations appear in the *si-you-geng-xu* direction at dusk. Whenever clouds gather near the sun, rising above and below, it is an omen of rain.

If clouds in the north are yellow and black, and their *qi* moves southward, rain will be abundant. This is called *xuanze*.
At dawn, if northern clouds are yellow and moist, thick and spanning roughly two *li*, and moving southward, rain will fall on *ren-gui* days. Since *ren-gui*’s color is black, this is called *xuanze*.

If at sunrise, black clouds resemble scattered threads or galloping mountains, rain will fall at the *zi* hour, and its quantity will be determined by the clouds’ density. Thus, it is said: "the裁 of the seven *zi*." If northern clouds billow southward, appearing dark and accompanied by southern winds that drive them north, rain will fall within eight days. If they move southwest, rain will come immediately; otherwise, drought will follow. If dew moves northward, rain will fall that day. Only when black mist veils the sun will rain surely come.

When clouds form horizontal bands:
*Yin-mao* corresponds to the names *jia-yi*; the sun’s position at *chen-si* corresponds to the moisture of *bing-ding*.

Whenever *yin*-essence cloud bands appear—whether white or black—at the *yin-mao* hours or in the *yin-mao* direction, rain will fall on *jia-yi* days. If they appear on *chen-si* days or in the *chen-si* direction, rain will fall on *bing-ding* days. Should *yin*-essence cloud bands be accompanied by moist *qi*, rain will arrive immediately.

At *wu-wei*, *wu-ji* remains absent; when clouds drift through *kun-shen*, *geng-xin* sees no deviation. Cloud bands over *wu-wei* or during *wu-wei* days and hours portend rain on *wu-ji* days. Those at *kun-shen* hours foretell rain on *geng-xin* days. If they appear over *you-xu* or at sunset, rain will surely fall on *ding-gui* days.

In times of disaster or drought, observe celestial omens entering the Celestial River, or encountering excessive rains where stars densely scatter across the Han thoroughfare. The Celestial River and the dispersed stars of the *Kui* and *Jiao* constellations—its origin being water—is also called the Celestial River. When stars appear densely in the night sky’s Han, rain will follow; sparse stars foretell drought. The six stars of Thunder and Lightning lie southwest of *Shi*; if bright and active, they herald thunder and lightning. The four stars of Thundercloud and Rain lie southeast of *Shi*; if bright and active, heavy rains will come.

When five colors intermingle—red and black entwined—heaven’s wrath brings hail and frost, and the *shen*’s anger manifests as *yun-*. If at dawn clouds and *qi* weave five colors or blend red and black, heaven’s fury will bring hail and frost. *Yun-* signifies disaster: fleeting clouds that fail to moisten things show disrespect to the *shen*.

Rain falling on days of flourishing *qi* nurtures all life, while rain on days of decline or death brings destruction. Gentle drizzles and distant breezes, near and far, honor the king with reverence and love. Swift gales and torrential downpours, high and low, betray the ruler’s suspicion and malice.

Light rains and soft winds that spare the crops are omens of harmonious transformation, where hearts unite above and below. But fierce rains and violent winds that churn and surge, flooding the land and sweeping away lives, foretell treacherous plots against the throne.

When the ruler is upright and ministers loyal, rain follows wind, and careful observation reveals no fault. But when arrogance rules above and flattery below, rain begins only to yield to wind—an omen of misfortune. The *Ganqing Fu* states: wind, a yang entity, corresponds to the ruler; rain, a yin entity, to ministers. Wind preceding rain is auspicious, a sign of the ruler’s rectitude and ministerial loyalty. Rain preceding wind signals the ruler’s negligence and the ministers’ brutality.

If clouds and rain appear without wind, rain is yang and clouds are yin. Rain followed by immediate clearing reflects virtuous governance and harmonious relations between ruler and ministers. If clouds linger, veiling the sky without dispersing, it foretells discordant policies and disharmony between above and below.

When nights are heavy with dew yet days unfold in clear brightness, it mirrors the ruler’s rectitude, ministerial loyalty, and the people’s reverence. When days are heavy with dew yet nights remain clear, it reveals ministers plotting against the ruler. When both day and night are shrouded in mist, it signifies collusion between above and below.

When Saturn retrogrades into the Celestial River, laws grow harsh, and floods follow. The *Tian Guan Shu* states: if Saturn retrogrades into the river, the realm will face great floods and stringent decrees. Should it drift into fords, drowning disasters will follow. If Mars retrogrades and guards Jupiter, drought ensues; entering the river brings severe drought and calamity for the nobility. Mars encroaching on Jupiter signifies corruption, the ruler’s transgressions made manifest.

In the cyclical rhythms of years, months, days, and hours, when spirits converge and celestial influences press upon one another, the *shen* meet. According to the *Taiyi* divination method, when celestial influences press upon one another in the twelve months, or on the days when the ten *jing* gather in the four seasons, and black clouds thick with moisture veil the sun, rain will surely fall that day. Green clouds bring rain on *jia-yi* days; red clouds, on *bing-ding* days. Green clouds also govern rain during *yin-mao* days and hours, while white clouds govern rain during *shen-you* days and hours.

First: *Tianhuang* aligns with *shen-zi-chen*, the three *jia* cycle heads. Years, months, days, and hours begin with *Wu*, moving sequentially through the twelve branches, pausing twice at the four corners.
Second: *Difu* aligns with *shen-zi-chen*, preceding the three *jia* cycles. It begins with *Yin*, moving sequentially through the twelve branches, pausing twice at the four corners.
Third: *Tianshi*’s five *zi* begin with the divined *jia*, moving sequentially through the twelve branches, cycling endlessly.
Fourth: *Tianxing*’s affairs begin with *jia-zi-chen*, the month’s start at the eight officials, moving in reverse through six, two, and four, cycling endlessly.
Fifth: *Feiniao*’s upper epoch begins with *jia-zi*, the middle epoch with *jia-zi* at seven, the lower epoch with *jia-zi* at four, each progressing from few to many through the nine officials, cycling endlessly.
Sixth: *Tianyi*’s upper epoch begins with *jia-zi* at eight, the middle epoch with *jia-zi* at six, the lower epoch with *jia-zi* at nine, each progressing from few to many through the eight officials, cycling endlessly.
Seventh: *Bafeng*’s upper epoch begins with *jia-zi* at two, the middle epoch with *jia-zi* at eight, the lower epoch with *jia-zi* at five, progressing through the nine officials, cycling endlessly.
Eighth: *Wufeng*’s upper epoch begins with *jia-zi* at one, the middle epoch with *jia-zi* at four, the lower epoch with *jia-zi* at seven, each progressing from few to many, skipping one position through the nine officials, cycling endlessly.

Four positions transform: at dawn, noon, dusk, and midnight, clouds arise. *Taichong*, *Shengguang*, *Congkui*, and *Shenhou*—whenever these four pivotal years, months, days, or hours align with *Taiyi*’s shifting palaces, and clouds veil the sun with dark, moist greenness, rain will surely follow. At dawn (*mao*), noon (*wu*), dusk (*you*), and midnight (*zi*), if clouds gather thick and moist, rain will come. Comets sweeping the sun bring winds; faint mists foretell clear skies. If the sky glows dry, yellow, or red, drought will prevail.

The *Liuren* method invokes the dragon-water stems and branches to bring rain. The *Six Ren Divination Classic* of the Xuanyuan clan regularly applies the monthly tally to the monthly establishment, and when the *Shenhou* appears beneath the new moon, great rain follows; when the *Dachong* appears beneath, small rain follows. The day is also reckoned by the six-*jia*旬: when *ren* or *gui* descend from heaven, rain comes. The day is also reckoned by placing *Daji* beneath the new moon’s *Shenhou* for great rain, or beneath *Dachong* for small rain. Whenever clouds arise, the monthly general is applied to the correct hour: if *Dengming*, *Shenhou*, *Gongcao*, or *Dachong* appear above, great rain follows. If *Qinglong*, *Liuhe*, *Tianhou*, *Xuanwu*, or *Yunyin* appear, small rain follows. When metal, earth, *Shenhou*, *Tengshe*, or *Baihu* align with the day’s stem or branch, fierce wind and rain arise. When *Taiyi*, *Shengguang*, *Zhuque*, or *Shengshe* align with the day’s stem or branch, clear skies are certain. If rain persists without clearing, apply the daily tally to the monthly establishment and new moon: when *Taiyi* or *Shengguang* align with the day’s stem or branch, or when *bing* or *ding* descend from heaven, the day will clear.

The day’s branches are *chen* in spring, *wei* in summer, *xu* in autumn, and *chou* in winter. The daily tally consists of *jia-yin*, *yi-mao*, *bing-chen*, *ding-si*, *wu-wu*, *geng-shen*, *xin-you*, *ren-zi*, and *gui-hai*. The two positions of day and tally, when not in their proper places, lack the ten celestial palaces’ essence, which is rooted in their native regions yet extends broadly. The *Divine Pivot Numinous Mechanism Classic* states: *jia* governs the Qi and Lu regions, *yi* the eastern Yi, *bing* Wu and Yue, *ding* the southern Man of Chu, *wu* Zheng and Chen, *ji* Wei and Cai, *geng* Jin and Wei, *xin* Qin and Shu, *ren* Yan and Han, *gui* Zhao and Wei. *zi* governs Han and Qi’s Qing region, *chou* Di and Wei, *yin* Zhao, Chu, and Han, Yan and You, *mao* Zheng and Yu, *chen* Deng and Zheng, *si* Wei and Jun, Jing and Chu, *wu* Qin’s western capital and Zhou’s Three Rivers, *wei* Liang, Chu, and the mountains, *shen* Qin’s Yong region and Qi, Jin, Wei, *you* Lu, *xu* Zhao, *hai* Yan, Dai, Wei, and Bing. These are the nine provinces’ celestial correspondences.

This method applies to the stems and branches of years, months, days, and hours. At the winter solstice, the sequence begins with few and progresses to nine; after the summer solstice, it begins with nine and diminishes to one. Every five days, the palace shifts, with each palace governing rain: the first palace rules rain in Jizhou and Zhaozhou, the second hail in Panzhou, Han, and Chu; the third wind and thunder in Qingzhou and Qi; the fourth incessant rain in Xuzhou and Lu; the fifth insect plagues in Yuzhou and Song; the sixth frost and hail in Yongzhou and Qin; the seventh dust and fog in Liangzhou and Jin; the eighth clouds and haze in Yanzhou and Zheng; the ninth fire disasters in Yangzhou and Wu—these are the nine provinces of today.

This method begins with *jia-zi* at the winter solstice, flying sequentially through the eight palaces; after the summer solstice, it begins with *jia-zi* at the central palace and flies in reverse. When metal and water stars enter or exit, wind and mist arise, and when the moon meets the *Bi* or *Ji* constellations, clouds and thunder spread across the earth. When the metal and water stars traverse *Ji* and *Bi*, their entry and exit herald wind and rain. When the moon meets *Ji*, winds prevail; when it meets *Bi*, rains prevail—this is the meaning of "much wind, much rain." When the Bronze Sparrow’s vapor pool dries and the ominous crow spreads its wings, when stone swallows soar and rivers overflow, the *Shangyang* dances. When emotions resonate, and the year’s drought causes crops to wither, the Bronze Sparrow conceals the green *píshé* snake’s four wings—this creature, called the *Weiwu*, brings three years of drought wherever it appears. The wise plant barley to guard against famine, for barley withstands drought. When the year will be bountiful, the *Shangyang* dances—this is the saying, "When heaven is about to rain, the *Shangyang* dances." The *Shuima*, also called the stone swallow, flying heralds abundant rain.

The ruler’s virtue ensures the five omens remain orderly to welcome the new. This means the minister’s worthiness upholds the ten righteous principles without fail, thus proving their efficacy. The sun and moon wax and wane, each with its constant measure; great and small works of governance each follow their constant methods, thus achieving order and transforming all things. The five omens are: wind to stir things, rain to moisten them, warmth to grow them, yang to transform them, and cold to mature them. When the five omens are complete, fortune and misfortune become clear and just. If the ruler is sagely and governs well, wind and rain follow in harmony. If the ruler is benighted, winds will rage. If the ruler is enlightened and reverent, timely rains will follow. If the ruler is reckless, rains will deluge. If the ruler is wise, timely sunshine will follow. If the ruler is presumptuous, drought will come. If the ruler is prudent, timely cold will follow. Each aligning with its season is called a fortunate omen.

In ancient times, when Shun abdicated to Yu, he humbled his palaces and devoted himself to irrigation, bringing peace to the people. Thus the eight winds followed their paths, and the five omens did not err. In contrast, the Shang king Zhou disrespected heaven, sent disasters upon the people, drowned in wine and lust, punished by clan, appointed officials by lineage, built lavish palaces and towers, ponds and extravagant robes, harmed the people, burned and roasted the loyal, and disemboweled pregnant women. Heaven’s wrath flared, chaos erupted on all sides, rains came untimely, winters warmed and summers chilled, and the five omens were all awry. This was the sign of heaven aiding King Wu in destroying Shang.

The *Record of Rites* states: joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, hate, and desire—these seven arise without learning, for they are human nature. Fatherly kindness, filial piety, fraternal love, sibling respect, husbandly righteousness, wifely reverence, ruler’s benevolence, minister’s loyalty, teacher’s strictness, and friend’s trust—these ten are perfected without learning, for they are human righteousness. They serve to deepen emotions and righteousness, foster trust and harmony, practice yielding and relinquish strife. Only the sage can achieve this. Revering heaven and honoring earth, the subtle Dao is applied to bring completion; ghosts revere and spirits admire, weaving the mysterious mechanism to perfection.

Having elucidated the numerical patterns of yin-yang and the articulations of the joints, and established the diagram of the subtle mechanism’s movements, we trace their principles—all these are the transmitted writings of the ancient sages, through which their conditions are thoroughly examined. From the beginnings of later worthies, penetrating the mysteries of heaven and earth, they are called the "Bestowal of Wind and Clouds." The *Pan Tian Jing* concludes:

[Note 1: "Four says" was mistakenly written as "says says"; emended according to the context.]
[Note 2: Before "governing hail in Jingzhou and the divisions of Han and Chu," two characters, "Er Guan," are likely missing.]
