**Morning Dao Ritual: The Original Command of Life**
The ritual proceedings commence as the altar is ascended in proper form.
The assembled lectors recite the scriptures, each paying homage to their respective teachers in accordance with the Dao.
The High Master (高功) proclaims the protective incantations of the Dao.

The Azure Yang (青阳) radiates its luminous reflection,
Illuminating the sun and returning the spirit.
The Divine Tiger repels malevolence,
The flying celestial beings scatter their bells.
It crushes deceit and extinguishes falsehoods,
Binding all demons in their forms.
The Nine Mysteries (九微) return to the Dao,
The Eight Auras (八威) subdue the vital essence (精).
The Thousand Authentic Ones (千真) verify the records,
The Three Primordials (三元) purify the heavens.

To the left, the Yellow Whistle (啸中黄) invokes,
To the right, the Six Ding (六丁) are summoned.
Seven rotations, eight harmonies,
Circulating the Heavenly Scriptures (天经).

The sacred Dao resounds majestically,
The Great Dao/Way (大道) is set in motion.
Auspicious clouds flow forth,
Converging the radiance of the Yellow Court (黄庭),
In harmony with the Dao/Way’s true essence.

The assembled lectors recite again,
Striking the ritual drum (法鼓) twenty-four times.

The High Master lights the incense burner (发炉).
We invoke the Supreme Three Heavens (三天), the Primordial Origin of the Three Qi (三炁), the Most High Dao Lord (太上道君), and the Most High Old Lord (太上老君), calling forth from within our bodies the thirty-five officials of the Three Five (三五), the left and right envoys, the left and right incense bearers, the courier dragons and mounted officers, the attendants of golden boys and silver girls who scatter words and flowers, and the thirty-six direct symbols of the Five Emperors (五帝), the thirty-six direct-day incense officials (直日香官), and all others who have emerged.

Those who have emerged are clad in solemn and resplendent attire,
Their headgear and sashes adorned with trailing plumes,
Opening the Mystic Altar (玄坛) and summoning the local deities and spirits of the domain (方域神真).

We now present our morning court,
Ascend the altar to perform the Dao Ritual,
And humbly recite our intentions—
Our sincere aspirations are recorded in the heavens,
And we pray that the Most High Ten-Directions True Dao (十方至真道) and the Primordial Qi (一炁) of the Dao,
The luminous treasure of the Venerable Dao (灵宝瑞光),
May descend and flow into our bodies,
So that our efforts may swiftly reach the Most High Dao of the Supreme Extremity (太上无极大道),
The Three Pure Ones (三清) and the Uppermost Saints (上圣),
The Heavenly Sovereign of Jade (昊天玉皇上帝),
The Grand Sovereign of the Purple Cluster (紫微北极大帝),
The Celestial Lord of the Central Dipper (斗中之尊),
The Great Sovereign of the Dipper (天皇大帝),
The Great Lord of the Dipper (斗中之主),
The Purple Cluster Great Sovereign (紫微大帝),
The Northern Dipper High Sovereign (北斗高上玉皇尊帝君),
The Celestial Lord of the Great Constellation (太微玉帝),
The Northern Dipper High Marshal (北斗太尉) of the Yang Brightness and the Greedy Star (阳明贪狼玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Supreme Steward (上宰) of the Yin Essence and the Giant Gate Star (阴精巨门玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Grand Administrator (司空) of the True Person and the Storehouse Star (禄存玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Wandering Attendant (游擎) of the Mystic Darkness and the Literary Music Star (文曲玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Lord of the Dipper (斗君) of the Red Primordial and the Chaste Star (丹元廉贞玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper High Officer (太常) of the Northern Extremity and the Military Music Star (武曲玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Heavenly Sovereign (上帝) of the Celestial Gate and the Star of the Broken Army (天关破军玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper Celestial Lord (玉帝) of the Mystic Clarity and the Outer Auxiliary Star (洞明外辅玉晨君),
The Northern Dipper True Sovereign (帝真) of the Hidden Primordial and the Inner Auxiliary Star (隐元内弼玉晨君),
The Dipper’s Celestial Enforcer (天罡) of the Ten-Thousand Authentic and the Commander of the Deluge Star (奎光帝君),
The Nine Sovereigns of the Northern Dipper (北斗九皇夫人),
The Nine Yin Inner Consorts (九阴内妃),
The Three Platforms and the Five Constellations (三台华盖星君),
The Three Officials and Five Emperors (三官五帝),
The Nine Departments and Four Divisions (九府四司),
The Daoist Virtues of the Dipper (斗中道德诸君),
The Saintly Host of the Unbridled (无鞅圣众),
The Sixty Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of the Original Command Stars (六十甲子本命星君),
The Great Daoist Master of the Mystic (玄中大法师),
The Great Daoist Masters of the Three Heavens (三天大法师),
The True Persons of the Precious (宝上真人),
The Two Immortal Envoys (二仙使者),
The Nine Palace Officials and Attendants (九宫官属),
And all true spirits (一切真灵).

We have heard that the Great Dao/Way, once divided,
The Primordial Essence (元精) began its operation,
The heavens and earth hung their symbols,
And yin and yang nurtured the spirit.

At its inception, humanity was born,
First emerging among all living beings,
The divine essence coalesced in the Supreme Extremity (太极),
The vital qi condensed in the Heavy Darkness (重玄).
All owe their nurturing to the sacred Dao,
And share in the transformation of the natural world.

We, by fortune, have been granted this life,
And now partake in the human order.
As the Three Mystic Caverns (三洞) open their light
And the Five Sacred Scriptures (五文) unfold their profundity,
We have glimpsed the Mystic Darkness (玄微) through the jade cases and phoenix tablets,
And explored the hidden depths with the phoenix scrolls and dragon chapters.

Yet, though we abide in the world and follow its customs,
As time passes, we have not yet ascended to absorb the clouds and stars of the ten directions,
Nor grasped the divine mists of the celestial valleys.

Only by performing our duties to assist the Original Command (功佐命),
Expanding the Dao and transforming the age (弘道化时),
May we fulfill the Mystic Teachings (玄科),
And hope to manifest the subtle effects (微效).
Moreover, we now present this petition in accordance with the sacred edict—
How dare we not humbly report it?

**Proclamation of the Petition**
As the words of the petition are spoken,
With sincere and earnest devotion.

Today, on the day of my birth and the Original Command of my life,
I devoutly surrender to the Dao,
And solemnly establish this Daoist hall,
To pray for blessings from the Nine Heavens (九天),
And to extend longevity to this very day.
With reverence, I light the incense and focus my thoughts on the true spirits (真灵).

I follow the ten-directional rites of the Azure Court (十华朝会之仪),
And the three-realm incense-burning format (三境焚香之格).

I pray that the Primordial Sovereign (元尊) may descend to inspect,
And that the Ten-Thousand Saints (万圣) may shine their light,
Commanding the Five Emperors (五帝) to gather at the Jade Palace (玉宫),
And summoning all true spirits (群真) to the Eight Extremes (八极).

I open the Red Primordial rank (丹秩) of the Southern Celestial Chant,
And increase blessings and longevity;
I inscribe the Azure script (青文) of the Eastern Dipper,
And flow its auspiciousness to bestow fortune upon all.

Now, in this morning Dao Ritual,
I request the ritual assembly (法众) to take this first pinch of incense and ascend.

All join in offering the incense,
Reaching the Jade Purity Palace (玉清宫),
And pervading the sacred realm of the Jade Purity (玉清圣境),
Forming the Azure Pavilion (华盖),
To venerate the Great Primordial Lord of the Dao (大罗元始尊).

I pray that this incense smoke,
Ascending directly to the heavens,
May venerate the Supreme True Daoist Treasure (无上至真道宝).

We, the disciples,
Surrender our bodies, our spirits, our lives,
And first prostrate ourselves to the ground.

We rely upon the Most High Three Sovereigns (太上三尊),
The Ten-Directions Saints (十方众圣),
And pray that with this pinch of incense’s merit,
The blessings may extend to the spirits of the ancestral temple and the state (社稷尊灵),
The sacred ancestors of the peach (宗桃先圣),
Our spirits may coalesce in the heavens above,
And the blessings descend to the mortal realm (降福人间).
May the Emperor’s longevity mountain endure forever,
The Dipper’s Extremity (辰极) align with the Azure Court (齐华),
And the sun and moon hang suspended to illuminate the ten directions,
The Primordial Harmony (元和) flow to bring peace to the four seas.

May the Empress and the Crown Prince,
Receive eternal blessings of radiant light;
May the civil and military officials,
Spread the imperial designs across the vast ages.

Now, this incense-burning,
Is an act of surrender to the Dao’s Sovereign (道尊) and the Great Saints of the True Dao (大圣众至真之德).

After attaining the Dao,
We may preserve the eternal heavens,
And harmonize with the Dao’s true essence.

Now, in this morning court,
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao Ritual,
We request the ritual assembly (法众) to take this second pinch of incense and ascend.

---

Now, the incense of **Universal Harmony** (眾和香),
Ascends to the **Supreme Purity Palace** (至上清宮),
Permeating all realms of the **Supreme Purity True Dao** (遍上清真境),
Forming a **Treasure Canopy** (成寶蓋),
To offer **nourishment** (供養) to the **Jade Dawn Great Dao Lord** (玉晨大道君).

May this incense smoke,
Ascend directly to the heavens,
To offer **nourishment** to the **Supreme, Most True Scripture Treasures** (無上至真經寶).

We, the subjects, surrender our **bodies** (皈身),
**spirits** (皈神),
And **lives** (皈命),
Prostrating our heads and bodies to the earth.

We humbly rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Saints** (十方眾聖),
May the **merits of this pinch of incense** (是捻香功德),
Flow back to bless the **vegetarian master** (斋主某),
With **Eight Cassias** (八桂) of equal years,
And **Five Mountains** (五山) of equal blessings.

May the **Ten Thousand Immortals** (萬仙) descend with their **auspices** (降佑),
And take the **Golden Elixir** (饵金液) to **calm our spirits** (安神);
May the **Host of Saints** (群聖) return their **radiant light** (回光),
And open the **Jade Scriptures** (開玉書) to bestow **auspicious blessings** (注祿).

The **Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors** (九玄七祖),
Ascend in glory to the **Vermilion Mound** (超景朱陵),
And the **Five Clans and Six Relatives** (五族六親),
Are inscribed upon the **Crimson Tablets** (列名丹簡).

Now, this incense-burning,
Is an act of surrender to the **Scripture Sovereign** (經尊) and the **Great Saints of the True Dao** (大聖眾至真之德).

After attaining the Dao,
We may preserve the **eternal heavens** (永保長存),
And harmonize with the **Dao’s true essence** (和與道合真).

---

With the incense of **Universal Harmony** (眾和香),
Ascending to the **Great Purity Palace** (至太清宮),
Permeating all **Great Purity Daoist Realms** (遍太清仙境),
Forming a **Cloud Canopy** (成雲蓋),
To offer **nourishment** to the **Five Spirits’ Mysterious Elder Lord** (五靈玄老君).

May this incense smoke,
Ascend directly to the heavens,
To offer **nourishment** to the **Supreme, Most True Master Treasures** (無上至真師寶).

We, the subjects, surrender our **bodies** (皈身),
**spirits** (皈神),
And **lives** (皈命),
Prostrating our heads and bodies to the earth.

We humbly rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Saints** (十方眾聖),
May the **merits of this pinch of incense** (是捻香功德),
Flow back to bless the **entirety of Heaven and Earth** (天地之內),
And **universally extend** (普及) to all **living beings** (群生),
With **Nine Nights of Illumination** (九夜開光),
And **Three Realms of Clarity** (三淵朗晏),
To stir the **flying and sinking** (飛沉), **moving and growing** (動植),
All may prosper and fulfill their **nature and destiny** (生成).

Now, this incense-burning,
Is an act of surrender to the **Master Sovereign** (師尊) and the **Great Saints of the True Dao** (大聖眾至真之德).

After attaining the Dao,
We may preserve the **eternal prosperity** (永保利亨),
And harmonize with the **Dao’s true essence** (和與道合真).

**Repentance** (忏方),
**Commanding demons** (命魔),
Three **invocations** (三啟),
Three **salutations** (三禮).

Again, we **recite the sacred ranks** (重稱法位).
The **officiating subjects** (具位臣某),
With the **assembled officials** (與臨坛官眾等),
Solemnly and sincerely **present our invocation** (上启),
To the **Three Pure Ones, Highest Saints** (三清上聖),
The **Ten Extremes of Highest Truth** (十極高真),
The **Celestial Bureau of Immortals** (斗府神仙),
The **True Daoist Ritual Host** (醮筵真宰),
Respectfully **entreat their boundless compassion** (恭望洪慈),
And **pray for their penetrating insight** (洞垂昭鑑).

We, the subjects, have heard that the **Two Qi** (二炁) **converge in harmony** (凝和),
And the **Three Refined Essences** (三靈) **manifest in substance** (表質),
Receiving the **transformation of the Great Dao’s creation** (承大道生成之化),
And the **molding power of the Great Void’s furnace** (鼓太虚陶鑄之功).

Therefore, the **thousand-year cycle** (千年) is the **period of descending saints** (降聖之期),
And the **five-hundred-year span** (五百) is the **number of virtuous births** (生賢之數).
None fail to **embrace the divine essence’s wondrous operation** (禀神妙運),
And **share the splendor of stars, constellations, sun, and moon** (分星辰日月之華);
Or to **manifest virtue and spirit** (纵德诞灵),
And **form the essence of mountains, rivers, and valleys** (結岳渎山川之秀).

Thus, their **merits are proclaimed to benefit all things** (功宣濟物),
And the **Dao flourishes in its timely manifestation** (道葉為時),
Their **compassion extends to all living beings** (恩被生靈),
And their **blessings reach both the manifest and the hidden** (惠覃幽顯).

At this **auspicious order** (令序),
It is fitting to **commence the ritual platform** (宜啟坛場),
To **embrace the boundless blessings** (將拥洪休),
And **entreat the Mysterious Saints** (仰祈玄聖),
Hoping through **sincere prayer** (冀因虔禱),
To **obtain their responsive grace** (俾獲感通).

Following the **Spiritual Treasure’s Bright Methods** (按靈寶明科),
And **unveiling the Dao’s Natural Secrets** (披自然秘格),
We **inscribe the Three Realms of the Heart** (注心三境),
And **surrender to the Ten Heavens of Life** (皈命十天),
With the **lamps’ light like the crane’s flame** (灯分鹤焰之辉),
And the **incense’s smoke like the dragon’s tendrils** (香散龙烟之穗).

The **Jade Tablets** (玉章) **fly with melodious resonance** (飛韻),
And the **Pure Chimes** (清磬) **flow their sound** (流音),
Surrounding the **vast and boundless spaces** (旁周寥廓之間),
And ascending to the **limitless expanse** (上達無何之外).

When the **Three Sovereigns’ ritual is complete** (三尊演既),
We may **increase years within the Jade Calendar** (增年於玉曆之中);
And when the **Host of Saints’ compassion flows** (萬聖流慈),
We may **extend blessings upon the Jade Tablets** (延祚於瑤缄之上).

With the **Nine Elixirs attained** (九丹自得),
All **ten thousand blessings flourish** (萬善咸臻),
The **long tablets inscribed in the Imperial Heart** (長簡帝心),
And the **eternal protection of Heaven’s blessings** (永绥天祿).

May the **Emperor’s Jade Diagram be firmly established** (皇帝瑶圖克固),
And the **auspicious blessings of the Treasure Dao flourish distantly** (寶運遐昌),
May all **ten thousand nations dwell in harmony** (萬國宅心),
And the **Nine Enclosures** (九圍) **conform to the Dao’s transformation** (順化),
With the **stars and constellations aligned in their degrees** (星辰合度),
And the **sun and moon radiant in their purity** (日月貞華).

From the **outermost seas to the central realm** (海外寰中),
All **conform to the Dao of Non-Action** (俱洽無為之道);
And from the **eternal heavens to the enduring earth** (天長地久),
Their **proclaimed merits are unending** (弘宣不宰之功).

All **creatures awaken in clarity** (庶類昭蘇),
And **living beings universally receive blessings** (群生蒙福),
From the **highest Three Realms** (上窮三界),
To the **lowest Nine Yins** (下及九陰),
Their **blessings universally permeate** (惠澤普沾),
And all **equally attain the Domain of Longevity** (同臻壽域).

Above, we **illuminate the Dao Lord’s boundless compassion** (上明天尊大慈之澤),
Below, we **fulfill our subjects’ sincere surrender** (下副臣等皈向之誠).

We **respectfully present this invocation** (謹啟以聞).

The **Knowledge Chime** (知磬) is raised,
And the **twelve vows** (十二願) are proclaimed.

The **Grand Lecture** (都講舉) is begun,
And we **preserve our spirits while burning incense** (存神烧香).

The **High Functionary** (高功) **replenishes the furnace** (复炉).

The **Incense Officials and Envoys** (香官使者),
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (左右龍虎君),
And the **Attendant Spirits of Incense** (侍香諸靈官),
Shall **now command our subjects to ascend the ritual platform** (當令臣向來早朝升坛行道之所),
Where **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade naturally generate** (自然生金液丹碧),
And **Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** (芝英百靈) **converge**.

May the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Children and Jade Maidens** (十方仙童玉女),

**We humbly hear** (臣等伏闻)
**That the Primordial Originator unfolded the diagram** (元始开图),
**Revealing the secrets of eternal life** (演长生之秘箓);
**That the Mystic Originator expounded the transformation** (玄元阐化),
**And expanded the wondrous gate of universal salvation** (弘广济之妙门).

**Universal blessings extend to all beings, human and celestial,**
**All attaining shared fortune and grace.**
Thus, past sins and karmic entanglements are dissolved,
All may repent and pray—
Even the slightest merit or virtue is fully recorded,
Great and small transgressions and virtues none are omitted.

**Our duty lies in proclaiming and upholding**—
We humbly assist the **Dao’s transformation**,
And for all supplications, how dare we not report them?

**Proclamation:**
As the words declare, sincere devotion is practiced,
Worthy of being inscribed and presented,
Hoping for divine response and communion.

We reflect upon the **Thirty-Six Sacred Scriptures** (三十六部尊经),
Where nurturing life is the foundation;
And the **Twenty-Seven Grades of Ritual Fasting** (二十七等斋法),
Where upholding virtue takes precedence.

Thus, the **Seven Stars of the Native Command** (本命七星) are moved and transformed,
Revealing the **Three Sovereigns’ divine decrees** (三皇监乾之旨),
Permitting the wearing of **Sacred Talismans** (佩宝符),
And the **Celestial Registrar’s records** (司马度籍),
To prolong life through **Great Unity** (延生太一),
And preserve the soul while extending years.

**Primordial Father and Mystic Mother** (元父玄母)
Internally govern the **Hundred Passes** (百关);
**Golden Dawn and Jade Splendor** (金晨玉华)
Externally dispel all malevolence.

**Descending the Radiant Light into the Great Cavern** (降日华於大洞),
**Dissolving karmic bonds in the Three Fields** (解宿结於三田).
Diligently practicing this,
One may ascend as a **Feathered Immortal** (云升羽化),
For the principles of nurturing one’s **Native Command** are recorded in the **True Scriptures** (本命具存修之理，载彼真经);
The **Birthday Scripture of Great Abundance** (生日敷大有之书) clarifies its profound meaning,
The **Celestial Registrar** (司命) reverses the **Ten Absolute Judgments** (回十绝之信),
And the **Primordial Lord** (元君) opens the **Register of Destiny** (开定籍之章).
The **Three Realms** gather in the courtyard,
And **Ten Thousand Spirits** take their ranks.

Then, virtues are recorded, vices censured,
Longevity preserved, life extended.

**Great indeed is the discernment of qi and nurturing of spirit**—
Awe-inspiring to heaven and earth—
The weight of birth,
Honored by the **Sacred Teachings** (圣教所尊).
On this auspicious day,
We must proclaim the **Assembly of Blessings** (申福会),
Thus, with reverence to the **Three Treasures** (三宝),
We aspire to the **Ten Radiant Ones** (十华),
With sincere vows and offerings of incense and flowers,
Turning the **Sutra and practicing the Dao** (转经行道),
Repenting sins and praying for grace,
Following the prescribed rites,
And observing the **Fast of Rectitude** (修斋直).

At this **midday ritual** (午朝),
We ascend the platform to practice the Dao,
And invite the **Assembled Lawful Ones** (法众) to offer this **first incense strand** (初捻上香).
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
Nourishing the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure** (无上至真道宝).

We, with devoted hearts, **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
Prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Three Supreme Ones** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** (十方众圣),
That the merit of this incense strand
May benefit the **State’s Sacred Spirits** (社稷尊灵),
The **Ancestral Lineage of Illustrious Saints** (列圣昭穆),
Ascending to the **Celestial Gate** (神升王阙),
Ranked in the **Jade Palaces** (品列琼宫),
Soaring in the **Upper Clarity** (腾逸驾於上清),
And attaining **Auspicious Distinction at the Great Treasure** (介殊祥於大宝).
May the **Imperial Line flourish** (允昌帝业),
And blessings extend to all beings (遐福群生).

Descendants of **Certain Family, Nine Generations, Seven Ancestral Lines** (某家九世七玄),
Countless generations past and future,
All emerge from darkness to witness the light.
Now, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the **Dao’s Supreme Saints and True Ones** (道尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
We shall eternally preserve life,
Harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).

At this **midday ritual** (午朝),
We ascend the platform to practice the Dao,
And invite the **Assembled Lawful Ones** (法众) to offer this **second incense strand** (二捻上香).
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
Nourishing the **Supreme Sutra Treasure** (养无上，供养无上至真经宝).

We, with devoted hearts, **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
Prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Three Supreme Ones** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** (十方众圣),
That the merit of this incense strand
May flow to **the Present Emperor** (归流今上皇帝).
May the **Imperial Vision endure eternally** (伏冀圣图悠久),
And the **Sacred Destiny extend abundantly** (宝祚延洪),
With the sun’s wisdom ever bright (日并睿明),
And mountains echoing with sacred longevity (山齐圣寿).
The **Consorts and Royal House** radiate auspicious grace (储宫妃后，光赞鸿休).
Ministers remain loyal and steadfast (百辟忠贞),
Supporting the flourishing age (扶持景运),
While the **Three Lights shine harmoniously** (三光融朗),
And the **Six Qi** remain balanced (六炁和平).
Grain and crops flourish abundantly (谷稼滋丰),
Weapons rest in peace (兵戈戢息).
Deep seas are traversed, perilous heights ascended (航深梯险),
Uniting all nations in homage (会万国以朝宗);
Wheels of law and letters unify the **Eight Strings** (车轨书文，总八弦而混一).
The people attain the **Dao** (俗臻有道),
And transformation spreads effortlessly (化洽无为).

Now, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the **Sutra’s Supreme Saints and True Ones** (经尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
We shall eternally preserve heavenly life (保天长存),
Harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).

At this **midday ritual** (午朝),
We ascend the platform to practice the Dao,
And invite the **Assembled Lawful Ones** (法众) to offer this **third incense strand** (三捻上香).
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
Nourishing the **Supreme Master Treasure** (供养无上至真师宝).

We, with devoted hearts, **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
Prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Three Supreme Ones** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** (十方众圣),
That the merit of this incense strand
May flow to **the Ritual Master Certain** (斋主某),
And to his **inner and outer kin** (内姻外族),
All relatives and connections (眷属亲缘),
That they may be **physically and spiritually at ease** (体豫神安),
With abundant blessings and longevity (福隆寿远),
Unscathed by the **Three Calamities** (三灾不染),
And untouched by the **Nine Hardships** (九厄无侵).
May the **House transmit loyal and filial virtues** (家传忠孝之风),
And the **Gate inherit steadfast harmony** (门袭安贞之吉).
Within the **Nine Enclosures** and across the **Entire Realm** (九围之内，率土之中),
May all benefit from **Auspicious Grace** (景贶所资),
And all beings prosper (群生咸泰).

Now, we burn incense,
Taking refuge in the **Master’s Supreme Saints and True Ones** (师尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
We shall eternally preserve life (永保长存),
Harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).

**Repentance, Command Demons, Three Invocations, Three Rituals.**
We reaffirm our **Lawful Stations** (重称法位).

**The humble officials Certain and others** (具位臣某等),
With sincere hearts, humbly petition the **Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints** (三清上圣),
The **Ten Extremes’ High True Ones** (十极高真),
The **Northern Dipper Celestial Officials** (斗府神仙),
And the **Ritual Banquet’s True Sovereigns** (醮筵真宰).

We have heard that the **Mystic Dao** manifests in scripture,
With the **Three Vehicles expounding teachings** (三乘演教),
The **Supreme True Ones** spread transformation (至真流化),
And universally save all beings, human and celestial (普度人天).
Thus, even the lowly may participate in the **Profound Mysteries** (微生参奉玄奥),
Following the **Sacred Originals** (遵依圣本),
And assisting in the **Mystic Rites** (敷赞玄科),
Hoping to exhaust our **Crimson Sincerity** (罄丹诚),
And aid the **Great Transformation** (用裨鸿化).

Now, the **Ritual Master Certain** reflects:
The **Supreme True Ones** universally bestow salvation (上真弘济),
The **Three Caverns radiate light** (三洞开光),
And all supplications are answered (有感必通),
For they favor only the virtuous (惟善是佑).

Daring to mark this **Native Command’s Birthday** (初诞本命之日),
We extend our **Repentance and Supplication Rites** (伸祈忏之仪),
Bowing before the **Ritual Platform** (稽首法筵),
Opening our hearts to the **Assembled Saints** (披心众圣),
Turning the **Sutra and practicing the Dao** (转经行道),
And praying for blessings and grace (请福希恩).

We humbly pray that the **Three Supreme Ones** (太上三尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** (十方众圣),
Shine upon the **Three Realms** (倾光三境),
And descend to the **Nine Pure Lands** (回驾九清),
Examining our **Crimson Hearts** (鉴省丹襟),
And flooding us with **Abundant Grace** (滂流洪泽).
Grant us **Boundless Mercy** (降无涯之施),
And **Great Forgiveness** (开大宥之慈).

Pardon **ourselves, Certain** (臣某己身),
And our **six relatives, kin, seven ancestral lines, and all connections** (六亲眷属、九玄七祖、一切亲缘),
From **past kalpas to this day** (历劫以来，至于今日),
For the **Six Senses’ obstructions and afflictions** (六根障恼),
And the **Three Actions’ transgressions** (三业罪条)—
Whether **disobedience to parents, lack of loyalty, cruelty, or injustice** (或不孝不忠，不仁不义),
**Defying heaven and earth** (犯违天地),
**Dishonoring the Three Lights** (秽慢三光),
**Provoking the Divine** (呵忿神明),
**Disrespecting the Four Great Elements** (轻凌四大),
**Indulging in sensual pleasures** (染滞声色),
**Wallowing in worldly luxuries** (耽玩繁华),
**Harming living beings for joy** (伤杀众生，以为快乐),
**Jealousy and suppression of the virtuous** (妬胜己，抑绝贤明),
**Greed and harm to others** (冒利贪财，酷害於物),
**Criticizing the Dao and defaming the True** (评论道德，毁败正真),
**Hypocrisy and deceit** (口是心非),
**Rebellion against superiors and tyranny over inferiors** (罔上凌下),
**Violating the Three Primordial Precepts and the Hundred and Eighty Prohibitions** (犯三元品目、百八十条),
**Endless and boundless offenses** (无边无涯),
**Beyond count or recollection.** (不可忆识).

「In light of today’s repentance and supplication, I humbly beseech the purification and elimination of all sins.

I pray that the **Dao of the Sovereign** (帝道) may flourish and spread, that the world may enjoy peace and prosperity, that the **Three Lights** (三光) be harmonized, and the **Five Celestial Stems** (五纬) follow their natural order. May all people return to the **plain and simple customs** (朴素之风), and may the realm embrace the **culture of universal harmony** (和平之化).

May the **Nine Abysses** (九幽) and the **Nocturnal Palaces** (夜府) all witness the radiance of the **Dao**. May the **Six Paths of Rebirth** (六趣) of diverse beings alike attain the **auspicious blessings** (祯贶) of the **True Dao** (至真).

As for this humble practitioner, **[name] Zhenchuan** and others, may we be adorned with **gold and jade** (金玉齐身), our longevity and blessings extended within (寿禄内延), while calamities and misfortunes be dispelled without (灾凶外息). May our descendants be **loyal and filial** (子孙忠孝), and our households remain in **serene security** (门宇清安). May the **true spirits of the Three Realms** (三界真灵) secretly grant their protection.

Above, we acknowledge the **Sovereign’s boundless grace** (广济之泽), and below, we align with the **sincere devotion** (皈命之诚) of the ministers. We respectfully submit this petition for divine awareness.

**Evening Dao Ritual**

The Grand Master presides, all disciples observe the precepts in accordance with the Dao.
The High Functionary proclaims the Sacred Spirit Incantations.

The Five Stars shine resplendent, auspicious *qi* ascends in flight.
The Primordial Sovereign gathers the divine—heaven and earth complete their cycles.
Jade talismans and sacred seals resound; their commands penetrate the deepest mysteries.
Flames are hurled, their might proclaimed—wickedness and calamity are annihilated without trace.
Ten thousand demons are subdued; their chaotic forms dissolve and vanish.

Divine radiance illuminates the night—all darkness is dispelled.
Ten thousand spirits descend in ranks; celestial banners ride the winds.
All living beings prosper; blessings extend across the land, harmonizing with the True Dao.

The Grand Master raises the incense burner.
The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Sovereign of the Three *Qi*, the Great Dao Lord of the Void and the Formless, summons forth from within our bodies the Three Five Functionaries, the Left and Right Officials, the Left and Right Incense Bearers, the Relay Dragon Cavalry, the Golden Boys Attending Incense, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, the Direct-Day Incense Officials—thirty-six each—now emerging.

The assembled bear their resplendent robes and official insignia, their caps and ribbons adorned, as they open the Mysterious Altars to the Celestial Sovereigns and True Ones. Let them now urgently summon the local land and territorial deities, the True Officials and Upright Spirits of this place.

Now, in this evening Dao ritual, ascending the altar to perform the Way, I humbly present my sincerest petition, my deepest devotions already recorded and conveyed. May the Supreme Ten Directions’ True Dao *qi* and Sacred Treasure Radiance descend, infusing our bodies, so that my petition’s sincerity may swiftly reach the presence of the Supreme True Dao of Boundless Extremes, the Three Pure Ones and Three Realms’ Celestial Sovereigns, the August Heavenly Jade Emperor, and the Star Sovereign, the Purple Cluster Emperor.

The Grand Master raises the incense burner, requesting the proclamation of the Law’s rank.
The undersigned, [Name], together with the assembled ritual congregation, humbly and sincerely petition:

The Ancestral Master of the Pole Star, the Sovereign of the Primordial Dao, the Primordial Heavenly Sovereign of the True Essence;
The Pole Star Patriarch, the Sovereign of the Mysterious Dao, the Supreme Dao Lord;
The Pole Star True Master, the Sovereign of the Divine Dao, the Supreme Lord Lao;
The Jade Emperor, the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign of the Mysterious Vault;
The Central Sovereign of the Pole, the Heavenly Emperor;
The Central Master of the Pole, the Purple Cluster Emperor;
The High Supreme Jade Emperor of the Northern Pole;
The Jade Emperor of the Azure Enclosure, the Supreme Lord of the Mysterious Court;
The Northern Pole Marshal, the Greedy Wolf’s Jade Dawn Lord;
The Northern Pole Chancellor, the Obscure Precision’s Giant Door Jade Dawn Lord;
The Northern Pole Minister of Works, the True Person of Longevity, the Jade Dawn Lord;
The Northern Pole Wanderer, the Mysterious Darkness’s File Star Jade Dawn Lord;
The Pole Star Lord, the Dan Yuan’s Chaste and Upright Jade Dawn Lord;
The Northern Pole Grand Master, the Heavenly Gate’s Breaking Army Jade Dawn Lord;
The Pole Star Emperor, the Illuminating Outer Assistant Jade Dawn Lord;
The Pole Star True Emperor, the Hidden Primordial Inner Jewel Jade Dawn Lord;
The Central Pole’s Ten Thousand True Generals, the Deluge Light Emperor;

The Sixty Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches of Native Stars;
The Great Law Masters of the Mysterious;
The Three Heavenly Law Masters;
The True Persons of the Precious;
The Two Celestial Envoys;
The Nine Palace Officials;
All True Spirits.

I have heard: the *virtue* of heaven and earth is called *generation*; the Dao that prolongs life is supreme.
The great blessings of the *Hong Fan* are called *longevity*; the True Essence that preserves life is most refined.

Thus, the **Great Dao** descends in scripture, the **True Essence** expounds in teaching;
To prolong life and preserve longevity, to enrich the state and secure its people.

Your servants, having received the **True Vehicle**,
Dwell within the **Dao Domain**,
Donning the seals of the **Eight Assemblies** and **Nine Lights**,
Beholding the **Jade Registers** and **Celestial Scriptures**,
All are proclaimed across boundless eons,
Flowing from the **Primordial Heaven**,
Containing the principles of state pacification,
And the chapters on self-cultivation for prolonged life.

Yet, we dwell in the dusty world,
Harmonizing our **qi** as we traverse land and sea,
Only desiring to spread and extol,
To manifest even the slightest merit.

For whatever we may present,
It should be properly recorded and submitted;
How much more so when we receive imperial edicts—
How dare we not report them above?

**Proclamation of Words.**

According to the words spoken,
It is fitting to submit them to the highest authority.

For on the day of our birth and **Native Star**,
Our hearts yearned for fragrant incense,
Devoutly opening the **Law Altar**,
Diligently observing **fasting and purity**,
Polishing the **Three Pure Ones'** sacred tablets**,
Unfolding the **Three Enclosures'** ancient scrolls**,
Studying the **Great One**’s talismans,
And the **Five Spirits'** essential registries,
All with concentrated minds in **Three Realms**,
Devoted thoughts ascending to the **Supreme Mysteries**,
Seeking to receive from the **Primordial Heaven**,
To revere the **Great Dao**,
To pray for mutual resonance and alignment with **True Spirits**,
To purify our thoughts and wash our hearts,
To earnestly trust in the **True Auspices**.

In this evening’s **Dao Assembly**,
Ascending the altar to practice the **Way**,
We request the **Law Assembly** to perform this **first offering of incense**,
May this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To venerate the **Supreme True Dao Treasure**.

Your servants, **returning body, returning spirit, returning life**,
Prostrate ourselves with heads to the ground.

We rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns**,
The **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints**,
May the merit of this incense offering
Ascend to benefit the **Altars of Land and Grain**,
The **Sacred Spirits** of the **Heavenly Court**,
To dwell in **Jade Capital**,
To spread blessings and **Precious Auspices**,
To achieve great prosperity,
To broadly bestow fortune upon all beings.

The **seventh ancestor of the Nine Mysteries**,
Ascended to **True Perfection** and **Dao Attainment**,
Refined the **Divine Elixir** at the **Celestial Pass**,
Transcended the **Mysterious Yin**,
In the **Three Realms** and **Ten Directions**,
All attain supreme blessings.

Thus, we now burn incense,
**Returning in devotion** to the **Dao Sovereign’s** **True Saints**,
After attaining the **Way**,
Forever safeguarding our **long abiding**,
In harmony with **Dao and True Essence**.

In this evening’s **Dao Assembly**,
Ascending the altar to practice the **Way**,
We request the **Law Assembly** to perform this **second offering of incense**,
May this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To venerate the **Supreme True Scripture Treasure**.

Your servants, **returning body, returning spirit, returning life**,
Prostrate ourselves with heads to the ground.

We rely upon the **Supreme Three Sovereigns**,
The **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints**,
May the merit of this incense offering
Ascend to bless the present emperor,
Humbly hoping his **enlightened vision** may flourish eternally,
His **sacred life** extend far and long.

With the **Golden Mirror** held low to survey,
All under heaven shall know **Great Harmony**;
With the **Pearl Tassels** adorned in solemn dignity,
The **Eight Seas** shall be serene and clear.

Morning shall have **loyal and sincere** officials,
Common folk shall attain **wealth and longevity**.
The **Empress and Consorts** shall be reserved,
Assisting in the **auspicious period** of prosperity,
Princesses and **Noble Kings**,
Shall be kept in **peace and good fortune**.

Beyond the **Fire Rat** and **Dragon Torch**,
**Jade and gold** shall vie in swift procession;
In the lands of **Yu Spring** and **Meng Valley**,
**Carriages and documents** shall flow as one.

---

Now, the present offering of incense,
From the **virtue/power** of the **Enlightened Ones**—the **Great Saints**, the **Supreme Experts**, and the **True Ones**—whom we have taken refuge in.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
We shall forever safeguard eternal existence,
And align our harmony with the **True Way**.

In this evening’s solemn assembly,
We ascend the platform to practice the **Dao/Way**,
And invite the **Dharma Assembly** to perform these three incense offerings.
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
And pay homage to the **Supreme True Teacher Treasure**.

We, the subjects, take refuge in body, mind, and **sacred life**,
And prostrate ourselves with our heads to the ground.

Relying on the **Supreme Three** and the **Ten Directions’ Saints**,
We humbly pray that the **virtue/power** of these incense offerings
May flow back to the **Sacrificial Host** of the certain household,
To themselves, their descendants, and all kin—both inner and outer—
That their **wealth and longevity** may be extended,
Their sins and blemishes purged,
Their calamities and misfortunes dispelled,
Their blessings and auspicious signs abundantly attained,
And that this grace may universally reach all beings—human and celestial—
Sharing equally in immense blessings.

Now, this offering of incense,
From the **virtue/power** of the **Teacher Treasure**—the **Great Saints**, the **Supreme Experts**, and the **True Ones**—whom we have taken refuge in.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
We shall eternally safeguard eternal existence,
And align our harmony with the **True Way**.

Repentance for all directions,
Subduing the **Life-Destroying Demon**,
Three invocations, three obeisances.

The **Grand Lecture** commences, and we solemnly recite the **Dharma Rank**.
We, the subjects of certain rank, along with the officials present at the platform,
With utmost sincerity, humbly prostrate ourselves,
And pray to the **Supreme Three**, the **Ten Directions’ Saints**, the **Highest Truths** of the **Ten Extremes**,
The **Martial Celestial Bureaus**, the **Divine Hosts of the Sacrificial Feast**,
And the **True Sovereigns of the Ritual Banquet**,
To behold their boundless compassion,
And to penetrate our earnest supplications with their radiant insight.

We, the subjects, hear the **True Transmission** of the **Ten Thousand Saints**,
And the **Supreme Three’s** solemn teachings,
Which prioritize **saving lives** and **preserving sacred life**,
And uphold the **orthodox Dharma** above all.

From the **Three Caverns’ Treasure Sutras**,
The **Arcane Intentions of All the Heavens**,
Some inwardly cultivate and close their vision,
Swallowing light to nurture the **Primordial Essence**;
Some refine **elixir** with **jade dew** and **jade frost**,
Using **five metals** and **nine cauldrons**;
Some **conserve the spirit** and **consume the qi**,
Restraining the **soul** and binding the **spirit**;
Some **ascend with steps** and **vanish their form**,
Hiding in the heavens and concealing beneath the earth.

All seek to prolong their finite existence,
And create the boundless beyond,
So that the **short-lived** may join the **long-lived**,
And the **morning mushrooms** may rank with the **great cypress trees**,
With all **thousand-gated virtuous beings** enticed to refine their essence.

Some, though foolish, grasp the **tale of capturing shadows**,
While the **superior sages** attain the **effect of diligent practice**,
Clarifying the essential teachings—both ancient and modern—
Which all must follow.

Now, the **Sacrificial Host** of the certain household,
By nature endowed with **orthodox truth**,
Aspires to the **profound mysteries**,
And comprehends the **principles of Dao/Way-body cultivation** and **generation**.
At the moment of their birth, when their **original sacred life** was first bestowed,
They now begin this **ritual assembly** of **burning incense**,
Devoting their minds to the **Ten Extremes**,
Prostrating before all the heavens,
And turning the **sutras** while praying for the **True Ones** and seeking blessings.

We, the subjects, accordingly gather and follow,
Adhering to the prescribed rituals,
And with sincerity, we pray to the **Supreme Three’s** boundless grace.

Humbly hoping that the **Supreme True Saints**,
The **Highest Exalted Ones** without limit,
May look down upon our petition,
And shower us with their **auspicious blessings**,
Granting us the **Vermilion Palace** and **Jade Gate**,
And the **Celestial Hall of Literary Splendor**.

May **Han Jun** open the **scroll of longevity**,
And **Sima Xi** record the **register of eternal life**.
May the **True Spirits** guard and protect,
And may **harmony** be our only resource.

The **right official** shall shorten the **scriptures of premature death**,
And the **left official** shall simplify the **calculations of extended life**.
May our **luck and lineage** be ever-broadened,
Our **sins and karmic debts** forever erased,
Our descendants and kin **prosper and content**,
And both the **living and the dead** **thrive in peace**.

We further pray for the **Ten Thousand Years of the Emperor**,
For the **Altars of Earth and Grain** to remain secure,
For distant lands and foreign courts
To share the same scriptures and follow the same paths,
For the **Three Lights** to shine brightly and long,
For the **Six Qi** to spread in perfect harmony,
For crops to flourish and **Dragon Spirits** to aid in their growth,
For no **diseases or epidemics** in the year,
For the people to live in **contentment and prosperity**,
And for the **Night Capital** and **Passage of the Dark Waters**,
The **Three Realms** and **Six Paths**,
To be blessed with the **extinguishing of suffering**,
And the **opening of the path by celestial light**,
So that all may emerge from darkness,
And be fully granted ascension and enlightenment,
Reaching the **Ten Extremes** and extending to the **Nine Enclosures**,
And all **sentient beings—mobile, stationary, and spiritual**—
May together ascend to the **Realm of Longevity**.

Above, we honor the **Great Heavenly Sovereign’s** boundless compassion,
Below, we fulfill our subjects’ **sacred life** of sincerity.

Respectfully submitted for your knowledge.
**Knowledge of the Ritual Bell**—the **Twelve Vows** are fulfilled.

The **Grand Lecture** commences—**preserving the spirit** while burning incense**.
The **High Functionary** restores the altar.

The **Incense Officials** and **Messengers**,
The **Dragon-Tiger Lords** to the left and right,
And the **Attendant Spirits** of the incense,
Shall direct us to the place where we previously ascended the platform in the evening assembly,
Where naturally arise **Golden Elixir** and **Lapis Lazuli Green**,
**Mushrooms and herbs**, and countless **spiritual beings**,
As the **True Ones** gather in assembly,
Right before this incense burner.

May all **Ten Directions’ Celestial Maidens and Immortal Boys**,
Attending with **orchid-scented incense**,
Transmit our previous supplications in earnest,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme True Dao/Way** without limit,
The **Three Pure Ones** and **Three Realms** of the **Heavenly Sovereigns**,
The **August Heavenly Jade Emperor**,
The **Grand Sovereign of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure**,
And the **Great Emperor of the Northern Dipper**,
Before their **Celestial Court**.

**Knowledge of the Ritual Bell**—the **chant of departure** is sung.
Departing the hall, we lead the way to the **Six Canopy Hall**.

**The Dao/Way Gate Ritual Precepts Complete Collection**, Volume Three concludes.

**Ritual of Repentance and Expiation for Illness**
*Compiled and Edited by Master Guangcheng Du Guangting*

**Morning Dao/Way Practice on a Pure Dawn**
The ritual assembly ascends the platform as prescribed.

The **Grand Master** raises the **Ritual Bell**, and all disciples bow in reverence, holding their thoughts in accordance with the Dao/Way.
The **High Functionary** proclaims the **Soul-Guarding Incantation**, while **Pure Yang’s Radiance** shines forth, illuminating the sun’s return.
The **Divine Tiger** banishes malevolence, and **Flying Celestials** toll their bells.
**Wickedness is crushed, trials extinguished**—ten thousand demons are bound in form.
The **Nine Mysteries** restore the Dao/Way, and the **Eight Awe-Inspiring Powers** gather essence.
A thousand **Perfected Ones** register their presence, while the **Three Primordial Cycles** purge the pure.
The **Left Whistle** summons **Central Yellow**, and the **Right Baton** commands the **Six Ding**.
Through **Seven Revolutions and Eight Unions**, they circulate the **Heavenly Scriptures**.
The **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic, and the **Great Dao/Way** is set in motion.
**Auspicious Clouds** flow abroad, converging with the **Yellow Court**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way**.

The **Grand Master** raises the **Ritual Bell**, and the **Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.
The **High Functionary** ignites the furnace.

**Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originator of the Three Qi**, **Most High Dao/Way Lord**, **Most High Venerable Laozi**—
Summon forth from within our bodies the **Three Five Functionaries**, the **Left and Right Official Envoys**, the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**, the **Relay Dragon Mounted Officials**, the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**, the **Jade Girls Scattering Flowers**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, and the **Direct Sun Incense Officials**—each **thirty-six in number**—to emerge.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes, their headgear adorned with trailing plumes.
They open the **Mysterious Platform’s Earthly Sovereigns and Territorial Spirits**.

Now, at this early court, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way, I humbly present my sincerest intentions.
All my earnest aspirations have been recorded and heard.
May the **Most High’s Ten Directions’ Supreme True Dao/Way Qi** and **Numinous Treasure Radiance** descend, flowing into our bodies,
So that my supplications may swiftly reach the **Supreme Limitless Dao/Way**, the **Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity**, and the **Heavenly Sovereign Emperor of Jade Sovereignty** before their Celestial Court.

The **Grand Master** raises the **Ritual Bell**, and the **Law-Position** is invoked.

We, **Position-Holding Officials** [here insert name] and the assembled ritual officers,
Humbly together present our sincere petition to:
**Primordial Heavenly Sovereign of Natural Spontaneity**, **Supreme Limitless Dao/Way’s Most High Dao/Way Lord**, **Most Holy Ancestor, Highest Dao/Way Sovereign of the Golden Threshold’s Primordial Heavenly Emperor**, **Most High Venerable Laozi**, **Highest Jade Sovereign**, the **Ten Directions’ Perfected Saints**, the **众至真 (Multitudes of Supreme Truths)**, the **诸君丈人 (Venerable Lords)**, the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors**, the **Jade Emptiness Sovereign**, the **Great Sovereign**, the **East Hua, South Pole, West Spirit, North Truth, Mysterious Capital, Jade Capital, Golden Threshold, Seven Treasures, Mysterious Platform, Purple Micro’s Upper Palace**, the **Numinous Treasure’s Supreme True Manifest Dao/Way Lord**, the **Great Lawmaster of the Mysterious Core**, the **Three Heavens’ Great Lawmasters**, the **Upper Clarity, Sun-Moon, Nine Luminaries, Southern Asterism, Northern Dipper Star Sovereigns**, the **Three Officials and Five Emperors**, the **Nine Departments and Four Bureaus**, the **Moral-Dao Sovereigns within the Dipper**, the **Saintly Crowd of the Unbridled**, the **Sixty Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches Natal Star Sovereigns**, the **Eastern Peak’s High Chancellor**, the **True Sovereign of Life’s Command**, the **Total Perfected King of the Western Extremity**, the **Mountain-Cave Perfected Immortals**, the **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits**, and **All True Essences**.

I have heard that the **Wondrous Root of Spontaneity** establishes transformations through circumstances,
Crafting Heaven and Earth, containing the void’s essence.
The sun and moon thereby emit their light, and the **Heavenly Stem and Earthly Branch** take their positions.
The **Heavenly Primordial and Earthly Treasury** govern the **Yang Officials and Yin Attendants**, distributing myriad spirits to rule all beings.
To **remove calamities and bestow blessings**, the **River Chart’s** clear decrees were revealed;
To **repent transgressions and seek mercy**, the **Great One** established the **Expiatory Offerings**.

Our duty lies in **opening salvation and broadly aiding**—first among these is **relief for the afflicted**.
Whatever is petitioned must logically be reported.
How much more so when we receive imperial edicts—how dare we fail to present them?
**The Edict is Proclaimed.**

As the words state, our sincerity is **crimson and sincere**.
Your disciple [here insert name], seeing that **auspicious and inauspicious fortunes alternate**, that **cold and heat shift**, that **prosperity and adversity are not constant**, and fearing **disasters that cling like shadows**, dares to rely on Your benevolent teachings and prepare this ritual platform.

Following the **Yellow Register’s Numinous Treasure Simplified Chapters** and examining the **Mysterious Capital’s Canonical Models**, we hope that through this exposition, we may attain **responsive communion**.

Now, on this pure dawn, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way,
We request the **Law-Assembly** to kindle this **first incense-stalk** and offer it aloft.
May this incense-smoke ascend directly to heaven, **supplying the Supreme True Dao/Way Treasure**.
We **repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**, prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Most High Three Sovereigns** and the **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**,
Wishing that the merit of this incense-stalk may flow into the **Imperial Diagram’s Grand Enterprise**,
The **Altar’s Sacred Spirits**, harmonizing with the Dao/Way without end, **aligned with Heaven and eternal**.
May the **Emperor’s Sacred Virtue** transcend the **Three Five**,
Spreading the Dao/Way throughout the **Nine Enclosures**;
May his **auspicious destiny** surpass **a hundred thousand years**,
Extending **non-action** across the **ten thousand realms**.

Now, we burn this incense and **humbly take refuge in the Dao/Way’s Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**.
After attaining the Dao/Way, we shall **preserve Heaven’s longevity**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way**.

With this early court, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way,
We request the **Law-Assembly** to kindle this **second incense-stalk** and offer it aloft.
May this incense-smoke ascend directly to heaven, **supplying the Supreme True Scripture Treasure**.
We **repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**, prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Most High Three Sovereigns** and the **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**,
Wishing that the merit of this incense-stalk may flow into **[household’s] Nine Mysterious Subtle Qi** and **a hundred kalpas’ karmic ties**,
Riding the **Primordial Sovereign’s Nine Celestial Petitions** to open the **Nine Abysses**;
Bearing the **Mysterious Sage’s Five Illuminations**, we shall **tranquilize the Five Sufferings**.
Blessings and misfortunes alike shall be preserved, and auspicious influence shall extend far and wide.

Now, we burn this incense and **humbly take refuge in the Scripture’s Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**.
After attaining the Dao/Way, we shall **forever preserve longevity**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way**.

With this early court, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way,
We request the **Law-Assembly** to kindle this **third incense-stalk** and offer it aloft.
May this incense-smoke ascend directly to heaven, **supplying the Supreme True Master Treasure**.
We **repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**, prostrating our heads to the earth.

We rely upon the **Most High Three Sovereigns** and the **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**,
Wishing that the merit of this incense-stalk may flow into **my person**,
So that the **Six Qi** may be harmonized and the **hundred passages** adjusted in order.
**Accumulated calamities and grievances** shall be washed away by Your grace;
**Stagnant illnesses and deep afflictions** shall be cleansed by the **Numinous Wind**.

「Midheaven bestows blessings, Southern Dipper extends years,
All kinsmen prosper, auspicious omens descend in secret.

Now, having kindled this incense, we rely upon the **Law-Assembly** and the **Most High Three Sovereigns**,
Ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way, seeking the **Supreme True Master’s virtue/power**.
After attaining the Dao/Way, we shall forever preserve our essence, harmonizing with the **True and Perfect Dao/Way**.

We **repent our deeds, repent our fate, and threefold invoke the Dao/Way with threefold obeisance**.
We solemnly recite the **Law-Assembly’s sacred rank** again.

With **my person** and the assembled officials at the platform, we earnestly and sincerely petition:
The **Three Pure Ones**, **Ten Directions’ Multitudes of Saints**, the **two ranks of the Ritual Feast**,
And the **limitless array of holy beings**, humbly gazing upon Your vast compassion,
Piercingly descending, Your radiant discernment.

We, Your disciples, reflect upon the **origin of our primordial essence and spirit**,
The **commencement of our vital *qi***—countless *kalpas* since that day,
Until this present moment—**we have not understood karmic retribution**,
Nor recognized **causal connections** (*yinyuan*).
Our **threefold actions** have accumulated wrongs,
And the **six dusts** have piled afflictions,
Violating the **Heavenly Sovereign’s generative Dao/Way**,
Breaking the **Earthly Sovereign’s prohibitions and taboos**,
Impairing the **Four Seasons’ responsive functions**,
And losing the **nature of all things to fulfill their destiny**.
Thus, we have **harmed and killed**,
And **injured all sentient beings**—**unaware and ignorant**,
Accumulating infinite transgressions.

Our **past sins remain unrepented**, and **future crimes grow heavier**.
The **Three Officials and Five Emperors** record them in **black scriptures**,
While the **Taiyueh and Luocheng offices** mark them in **scarlet tablets**.
Perhaps due to **threefold fate’s malevolence and five agents’ suppression**,
Or **stars’ ill-omened conjunctions and divine retribution**—
Or because of **laborious toil, felling forests, transporting stones**,
**Hewing trees, excavating hills**, **disturbing dragon spirits**,
And **violating prohibitions and taboos**—
We have thus incurred **sickness and calamity**, yet **no cure has come**.
Our **true *qi*** is unbalanced, and the **Three Elements** are disordered.

Daring to rely upon the **ritual canons**, we establish this **Dao/Way altar**,
Pouring forth **sincere sincerity** below, and **praying to the Mysterious Saints** above,
For **infinite sins and offenses**—**all begging for repentance and absolution**.

We **humbly hope** that the **Multitudes of Saints** will descend their light,
And the **Ten Thousand Truths** will turn their gaze,
Flowing **great compassion’s grace** and bestowing **limitless mercy’s favor**,
Commanding the **Four Sovereigns** and **Nine Palaces** to:
For **my disciple’s person**, **erase the register of death**,
**Inscribe a new name in the celestial ledger**,
**Remove calamity and dispel disaster**,
**Harmonize grievances and resolve conflicts**,
**Cleanse past stains** and **level accumulated wrongs**.
The **stars’ ill-omened conjunctions** shall cease their influence,
And the **yearly *qi*’s suppressions** shall fade their retribution.
The **Blue Emperor** shall **extend his protective tally**,
**Recording liver and safeguarding soul**,
The **White Emperor** shall **transfer our name**,
**Quieting spirit and calming lungs**,
The **Star of Destiny** shall **guard our kidneys**,
And the **Mars Star** shall **settle our heart**.

The **Yellow Court True Person** shall **harmonize our spirit and preserve our organs**,
While the **Heavenly Physician** approaches from the east,
The **Grand Unity’s true essence**—**divine medicine hidden in reserve**—shall **descend as numinous dew**.
**Malevolent influences** shall dissolve at our will,
And **illnesses** shall vanish like mist.
**Blessings and longevity** shall eternally extend,
While **disasters and decline** shall utterly cease.

We pray that the **Emperors’ sacred diagram** endure forever,
And the **Saints’ virtue/power** shine resplendently,
That the **Four Seas** shall have no turmoil,
And the **Eight Strings** (*Eight Winds*) shall bring **great harmony**.
**Weapons** shall naturally be laid aside,
And **grain** shall flourish abundantly—
**The Sovereign** shall be **holy**, his **ministers loyal**,
And the **Heaven** and **Earth** shall be **serene and tranquil**.

Yet we also beg for **my disciple’s household**:
The **Nine Mysteries** to enjoy **blessings**,
The **Seven Ancestors** to attain **Heaven**,
The **Five Clans** to dwell in **peace**,
And the **Six Relatives** to live in **harmony**.
The **springs of the Nine Abysses** shall resound with **no voices of guilt**,
And the **Three Realms** shall merge, **Six Realms** renounce **the cycle of rebirth**.
**Flight and movement** shall be **stilled**,
And **sentient beings**—**all who know**—shall **partake in eternal life’s fruit**,
Together **drinking from the vast salvific grace**,
**All attaining the Dao/Way of enduring life**.

Above, we **manifest the Heavenly Sovereign’s boundless compassion**,
Below, we **fulfill our disciples’ repentance and gratitude**.

We **respectfully present this petition** to be heard.
*Knowing the ritual bell is struck, we offer twelve wishes.*

*The grand incantation is raised, and we preserve the spirit while kindling incense.*
*The High Functionary restores the furnace.*
The **Incense Officials and Heavenly Messengers**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Sovereigns**,
And the **Attendant Spirits of the Incense**—
**Let them now attend at the place where we formerly ascended the platform to practice the Dao/Way**,
Where **golden nectar and emerald elixir** shall naturally arise,
**Mushrooms and herbs of a hundred blessings** shall flourish,
And the **Multitudes of Truths** shall gather here before this **incense furnace**.

We wish that the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Youths and Jade Maidens**,
**Shall receive the fragrant incense** and **transmit our sincere petition**,
Swiftly conveying it to the **Supreme True Master’s boundless Dao/Way**,
To the **Three Pure Ones’ Sacred Presence**,
And to the **Lord of Heaven, Jade Sovereign, and Imperial Sovereign** before them.

*Knowing the ritual bell is struck, we exit the hall to chant.*
*We leave the door and proceed to the Six-Muched Hall.*

**Complete, the *Daoquan* (Dao/Way Ritual Canons) in Volume Four.**

**Refining the vital essence-soul** in the **Lapis Azure Furnace**,
**Riding the Cloud Canopy** beneath the **Purple Enclosure**,
**May blessings be visibly present**,
**And virtuous fame endure for ten thousand generations**.

**Our household’s misfortunes** shall **dissipate through the Five Phases**,
**Our sins** be **cleansed by the Three Bindings**,
**The Six Palaces** proclaim **harmony**,
**The Hundred Passages** regulate **smooth flow**.

**Deep grievances** shall **be resolved in the past**,
**With repentance and purification**—**all shall be equalized**.
**Old calamities and new misfortunes**,
**Shall be dispelled by prayer**—**all shall cease**.

**Then** may **six relatives and five clans**,
**Receive blessings and prosperity**.
**Through nine nights and three depths**,
**May auspicious omens universally spread**.」

**Now, in offering this incense,**
we humbly **return to the virtue of the Great Sage, the Most Authentic of the Eight Immortals and the True Dao,**
our **Teacher and Lord of Saints.**

**Having attained the Way,**
we **eternally preserve our true nature,**
**harmonizing with the Dao’s authenticity.**

**Repentance, command over demons, three invocations, three rites—**
**repeating the sacred rank.**
**We, the humble subjects—officiant [Name] and the assembled ritual officials—**
**sincerely unite in supplication to the Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Deities of the Ten Extremes,**
**the ritual assemblies of the Three Realms,**
**and the ranked saints of both classes,**
**reverently awaiting their boundless compassion**
**and their penetrating, luminous insight.**

**We reflect that the Most Holy have descended scriptures,**
**the Highest Truths have manifested transformations,**
**the Eight Precepts unfold their mysteries,**
**the Three Caverns radiate their light,**
**the grand rituals of Qingdu’s salvation and deliverance,**
**and the Yellow Register’s sacred scrolls for repentance and prayer—**
**our sincere hearts reach them,**
**and divine response is assured.**

**This disciple, [Name],**
**trapped in the dusty world, ensnared by worldly bonds,**
**with every thought entangled in mundane concerns,**
**has yet to align with the True Dao;**
**in conduct and body, we often stray from the Great Way.**
**Whether through past lives’ accumulated sins,**
**never encountering the Mystic Scriptures,**
**or entangled in deep guilt from the Six Emotions and Three Actions,**
**or lingering debts and ancient grudges,**
**we are now bound by fate’s retribution—**
**disasters and calamities plague our destiny,**
**illness and misfortune ensnare us,**
**the Six Palaces lose harmony,**
**the Hundred Passages remain unbalanced.**
**We ponder the fleeting nature of life,**
**our anxieties deepening.**

**Thus, we dare to lay bare our hearts,**
**establishing this fast to seek blessings,**
**following the sacred rites of the Spirit Immortals,**
**erecting the Eight Scenic Ritual Platform,**
**preparing incense and lamps with devotion,**
**and humbly offering repentance and gratitude.**

**May the Jade Pure Ten Saints and the Golden Gate Immortals**
**accept our sincere offerings,**
**bestowing celestial grace—**
**that the Long-Life Inspector may open the Dan Register to extend our years,**
**the Degree-over-Misfortune Deity restore the Purple Text to bring blessings.**
**May the Five Spirits be settled in the Five Viscera,**
**the Three Qi aligned in the Three Fields.**
**May the Southern Heaven bestow the Continuing Prosperity Talisman,**
**the Eastern Dipper record the Longevity Brand.**
**May the Northern Palace avert death,**
**the Western Bureau record our names,**
**our vital essence harmonized,**
**disasters and calamities extinguished,**
**earthly oaths unbroken,**
**watery pledges unviolated,**
**ghosts released from grudges,**
**humans freed from scheming.**
**May the stars move in auspicious paths,**
**no malevolent influences descending;**
**our natal star’s year pass without calamity or obstruction.**
**May the Mystic Elixir be secretly transmitted,**
**divine medicines granted—**
**rapidly healing, eternally secure.**
**The fast’s great blessings, the Yellow Register’s sacred efficacy—**
**above, honoring the Imperial Diagram, eternally prospering Heaven’s mandate;**
**below, benefiting the realm, ensuring lasting peace.**
**Externally, war ceases; internally, no sickness plagues.**
**The Nine Dark Nights and Six Realms’ beings**
**all share in the blessings of the Dao,**
**ascending to its shores.**
**Dragon spirits guard the land,**
**its boundaries thriving in ease,**
**the Dao’s wind of freedom bathing all in grace.**

**Above, we honor the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless compassion;**
**below, we fulfill our subjects’ sincere repentance.**

**Respectfully submitted.**

**The ritual bell is struck; the Twelve Vows are offered.**
**The Grand Lecture begins; incense is burned in reverence.**
**The High Functionary restores the furnace.**
**The Incense Officials, Dragon and Tiger Attendants, and the Auxiliary Spirit Officials—**
**command that where the disciple previously knelt in midday ritual,**
**golden elixir and jade-green pills shall spontaneously arise,**
**hundreds of numinous herbs flourish,**
**and the assembled Immortals gather before this incense furnace.**

**May the Celestial Children and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions**
**attend the fragrant mists,**
**transmitting this disciple’s sincere supplications**
**directly to the Supreme, Boundless Dao of the Highest Truth,**
**the Three Pure Ones, the Celestial Jade Emperor—**
**before their august presence.**

The Supreme Sovereign King of the Western Extremity,
The Perfected Immortals of Sacred Mountains and Caverns,
The Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits,
All True and Numinous Beings.

**The Disciple’s Declaration:**
We have heard that the Primordial One formed the cosmos,
The One Essence congealed the light—
Heaven and earth received their authority,
Yin and yang moved to generate and transform.
Prosperity and decline alternate; virtue and vice diverge.
The sun and moon have their cycles of decline;
Cold and heat follow their appointed courses.
Only this Great Dao unifies the seen and unseen,
Extending blessings and rest,
Broadly aiding all beings.

We have early explored the True Secrets, glimpsed the numinous diagrams.
The Three Caverns’ jade cases hold expiatory rites;
The Nine Heavens’ golden decrees transmit protective texts.
For four ten-thousands of kalpas, its teachings have flourished;
For five hundred millions of heavens, it has been venerated—
Subduing demons, summoning spirits,
Assisting the nation in its deeds,
Supporting the perilous and saving all things.
For any supplication made, how could it not be reported to the heavens?

**The Petition’s Words:**
As the words declare, the intent is sincere and devout.
This disciple, still bound by calamity and not yet freed from illness,
Prostrates before the heavens, baring our hearts to the Dao,
Requesting the elevation of this solemn fast,
That numinous power descend to aid us,
That our sincere offerings may meet with celestial favor.

With this late evening ritual, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
We pray the assembled Daoists to light the first incense strand,
That this incense smoke may ascend directly to heaven,
Offering to the Most High True Dao Treasure.
We, disciples, prostrate body, spirit, and fate.
Relying on the Three Supreme Ones and the Ten-Directional Saints,
May the merit of this incense strand flow to the Emperor’s Nine Temples,
Illuminating the Three Pure Ones, blessing all lands,
Strengthening the august foundation, ensuring eternal prosperity.
We respectfully pray for the Crown Prince and all Princes,
That they may uphold the great enterprise.
And for our ministers and officials,
That they may assist in the wise designs,
With all under heaven in harmony, gathering like clouds and streams.

This incense is now burned; we take refuge in the Great Saints’ Most True Dao Virtue.
After attaining the Dao, we shall eternally preserve heaven’s longevity,
Harmonizing with the True Dao.

With this late evening ritual, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
We pray the assembled Daoists to light the second incense strand,
That this incense smoke may ascend directly to heaven,
Offering to the Most High True Scripture Treasure.
We, disciples, prostrate body, spirit, and fate.
Relying on the Three Supreme Ones and the Ten-Directional Saints,
May the merit of this incense strand flow to our family’s seven ancestral and nine mystical lineages,
Freeing them from earthly bonds, ascending to celestial paths,
Ceasing all litigation in the netherworld,
Blessing our descendants with auspicious fortune.
The Nine Hells shall witness the radiant compassion;
The Six Realms’ beings shall together attain the realm of virtue.

This incense is now burned; we take refuge in the Scripture Saints’ Most True Dao Virtue.
After attaining the Dao, we shall eternally preserve longevity,
Harmonizing with the True Dao.

With this late evening ritual, ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
We pray the assembled Daoists to light the third incense strand,
That this incense smoke may ascend directly to heaven,
Offering to the Most High True Master Treasure.
We, disciples, prostrate body, spirit, and fate.

With reverence, we take refuge in the Most High Three Sages,
And the Ten Directions’ holy assemblies.
May the merit of this incense strand flow to disciple [name],
Clearing debts and settling grievances,
Dissolving calamities and disasters,
Quelling malevolence and dispelling evil,
Healing sickness and dispelling misfortune,
Extending life through the Southern Dipper’s grace,
And bestowing prosperity through the Eastern Palace’s decree.

Thus extending to all kin and kindred,
And all beings of heaven and earth,
Together sharing in virtuous merit,
All ascending to the Dao’s realm.

Now, with this incense burned, we take refuge in the Teacher-Saints’ Most True Dao Virtue.
After attaining the Dao, we shall eternally preserve peace and well-being,
Harmonizing with the True Dao.

Repentance offered, demonic influences subdued,
Three invocations, three obeisances.
Reaffirming the sacred rank.

With sincerity, we—disciple [name] and the ritual officials—
Humbly present our heartfelt supplication to the Three Pure Ones and Supreme Deities,
The Ten Extremes’ High Immortals,
The Three Realms’ ritual assembly,
And the Two Classes of Arrayed Saints,
Beseeching their boundless compassion to pierce through and illuminate our devotion.

We, disciples, have long worn the sacred texts’ blessings,
Unveiling mysteries profound, striving to propagate virtue,
Establishing merit to benefit all beings.

Disciple [name], burdened by calamities and afflicted by misfortune,
List our transgressions with sincerity, earnestly praying for blessings,
Requesting the ritual’s rectification and the True Ones’ intercession.

Thus, we dare follow the prescribed rites,
Turning the scriptures and practicing the Dao,
Repenting for disciple [name]’s past and present lives,
Deep-seated sins uncountable—
Either defying Heaven and Earth’s nurturing benevolence,
Or failing to honor the Sun and Moon’s illuminating virtue,
Violating the nature of the Two Qi and Five Phases,
Disrupting the harmony of the Three Lights and Six Seasons.

Past grievances unresolved, future sins accumulating,
Taking life recklessly, acting without restraint,
Ignorant of cause and effect, heedless of taboos.
The passions’ stirrings offend both seen and unseen,
The three actions’ deeds transgress sacred teachings.
Thus, we incur retribution, inviting disaster and peril.

Again, we fear provoking Dragon spirits,
Undertaking earthworks and construction,
Encroaching on geomantic harmony,
Or defying the seasons’ natural order.
Again, we fear the influence of celestial portents,
Yearly cycles of misfortune,
The Nine Palaces’ penal influences,
And the Eight Trigrams’ conflicting obstacles.

Sickness and misfortune deepen, danger pressing near—
We dare invoke the ritual, repent our transgressions,
Burn incense and light lamps,
Praying to Heaven and beseeching fate,
That calamities and sins may be absolved,
So that the Primordial One may extend life,
The Three Elements may reverse death,
Spirit-children may administer remedies,
The Great Emperor may descend with talismans,
The Six Ministries may harmonize,
And the Hundred Passages may flow freely,
Bestowing longevity and prosperity,
Extinguishing misfortune and nurturing blessings.

May disciple [name]’s household ascend to the Nine Ancestors’ celestial realm,
With all kin receiving protection,
The Nine Hells and Six Realms’ beings—
All creatures, flying, swimming, or rooted—
Each attaining their rightful place,
All sharing in blessings and fortune.

Above, we pray for the Dragon’s grand design to endure,
Heaven and Earth to last eternally,
Cultural virtue to flourish and martial prowess to resonate far,
The sacred waters bearing virtue, the sun’s brilliance encompassing all.
The Eight Trigrams and Nine Regions shall again shine in the Pure Luo,
Pearls and jade reunite in the Mystic Vault.
The hundred grains shall yield without fail, the three agricultural labors prosper,
No epidemics shall arise, floods and droughts shall not intrude,
Winds and rains shall come in season, arms shall forever rest,
All sentient beings included.

Below, even the spirits of the underworld,
River and mountain officials,
Yin and Yang ministers—
Punishing evil and aiding the righteous,
Propagating the Dao and bringing peace,
Ascending together to the Dao’s shore—
Thus, above we honor the Heavenly Sage’s boundless compassion,
Below we fulfill our disciples’ sincere repentance.

Humbly presented for divine acknowledgment.

The ritual bell is struck; the Twelve Vows are proclaimed.
The Grand Lecture commences; the spirit is focused, incense is burned.
The High Functionary restores the altar.
The Incense Officials and Messengers—
Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
Attendant Spirit Officials—
Shall now command that where disciple [name] has ascended the evening altar to practice the Dao,
Golden elixirs and emerald jade shall spontaneously arise,
Mushrooms and hundred-spirits’ herbs flourish,
And the assembled Immortals gather before this incense burner.

May the Ten Directions’ celestial maidens and immortal youths
Attend to the fragrant smoke,
Transmitting disciple [name]’s sincere supplications
Directly to the Supreme Dao’s Unbounded Extremity,
The Three Pure Ones and Most High Saints,
And the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault.

The ritual bell is struck; the hymns are chanted.
Exiting the hall, led to the Six-Curtained Chamber.

The Grand Master raises the ritual drum **twenty-four times**.
The High Functionary ignites the furnace.

**Invocation of the Supreme Three-Heaven Primordial Three-*qi*,
The Most High Dao Sovereign,**
Commanding forth from within my body the **Three Five Functionaries**,
Left and Right Officials, Left and Right Incense-Bearers,
Dragon-Courier Mounted Attendants, Incense-Bearing Golden Boys,
Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans,
Direct-Day Incense Officials—**thirty-six each**—to emerge.

Those who emerge are attired in splendid robes, caps with trailing ribbons,
Opening the Mysterious Altar’s land and territorial spirits.

I, your humble disciple, having fasted and offered sincere supplications,
Now establish the altar in ritual play, humbly declaring my intent.
My heartfelt sincerity is fully recorded in the petition.

With today’s invocation of the altar and arrangement of positions,
All offerings displayed, the assembly solemn and without disturbance,
The True Ritual performed with solemnity—
The celestial omens align, auspicious clouds gather.
With utmost devotion, my sincerity ascends to the highest realms.
May all above and below Heaven hear and know.

「May the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Most High and Ultimate Truth** descend with its **mystic light of spiritual treasure** and **enlightened radiance**,
Flowing into the bodies of your humble disciples,
That the sincerity of my invocation may swiftly reach the **Direct Sovereign Dao/Way of Ultimate Truth and Boundlessness**,
The **Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness**, and the **Celestial Gate of Golden Threshold—Jade Emperor, the Most High Sovereign** before whom they reside.

**All assembled officials** now convene, and I humbly request the **proclamation of sacred ranks**.
With all ranks present—your humble disciple **Certain** and the **ritual officials gathered at the altar**—
We together offer our sincerity to the **Nine Sovereigns of Great Dao/Way**,
The **Supreme Saints of the Ten Directions**, the **Three Realms of responsive virtue**,
And all **true and enlightened spirits**.

Your humble disciple hears that Heaven does not favor those lacking **virtue/power**,
Yet when inner sincerity is exhausted, it can move the **august and exalted**—the **Emperor of the Highest Extremes**.
The **virtuous** do not revere those without **proper ritual conduct**,
Yet when outer propriety is perfected, it can unlock the **secrets of ascension**.

Only through the utmost devotion to **sincerity and ritual** can one receive the **presence of the True Saints**.
Moreover, the **Three Talismans of the Yellow Talisman Ritual** are honored,
And the **Nine Altars** revere the **grandeur of the Yellow Altar Ritual**.

Now, with reverence, I purify the **hidden halls of the sacred grove**,
And solemnly open the **field of refined edicts**.
Flags flutter with **celestial winds**, summoning the **true qi of the Five Directions**;
Swords strike across the **Northern Dipper**, cleansing **thousand-li demons and malevolent influences**.

Incense burns fragrant, rising in **pious smoke**;
The **sacred drum** resounds, its **clear and resonant** tones echoing.
With **solemn discipline**, we commence this **great ritual**,
And exhort the **unified resolve** of all participants.

We recite the **hymns of the Celestial Caverns**,
And invoke the **high and exalted** **Supreme Saints** to descend.
We **spread out the sacred space** in accordance with the **fasting rules**,
And **purify through repentance**, washing away the **roots of sin**.

Humbly, we pray that all **sincere and distant** voices be heard,
That the **Emperor’s heart** descend in response,
And that the **manifest form** of his grace be abundantly shown,
Piercing our **ultimate sincerity**.

First, we dispatch the **True Officials overseeing the fast and ritual**,
The **Celestial Maidens attending scriptures and incense**,
The **Transmitting Speech Jade Maidens**,
The **Golden Boys presenting petitions**,
To come and **temple at this spotless field**,
Together leading our **heartfelt prayers**,
To **verify the ritual** and **fulfill our wishes** in harmony.

Then, **jade and feathered spirits** gather in flight,
And the **cranes rest in pairs** beneath the **still night**;
**Emerald banners** are raised in all directions,
And the **sacred chariots of jade** spread across the **layered heavens**.
Some ride upon **transcendent beasts of celestial birth**,
Others drive **heavenly steeds of flying clouds**—
In **swirling multitude**, they descend to this solemn assembly.
How dare we not **reverently accept** their presence,
And **awaken this mystical response**,
So that they may **ascend before the Ultimate Dao/Way of Boundless Truth**!

**Know the sacred bell is struck**,
And **rise in respectful praise**.
**Chant the Ten Directions**!

When the **rites are complete**, all **prolong kneeling** in **repentance and submission**,
Your humble disciple and the **ritual participants**,
With **devoted hearts**, bowing to the **Ten Directions of the Boundless Dao/Way**,
The **Supreme Dao/Way of the Most High and Mystic Treasure**,
Humbly **gazing upon the Great Mercy**,
And **piercing the vast compassion**,
That **universal grace** may descend.

Your humble disciple hears that all **things under Heaven** are insufficient to **exchange with the divine**,
Yet **cultivating sincerity within the heart** can **respond to Heaven and Earth**.
How much more so for the **teachings of the Primordial Mystic**,
Which are all **paths of purity and clarity**!
If **the three karmas and six roots** of **offenses remain unchecked**,
How could one **pure in body and twofold in spirit** attain this?

At the **commencement of this strict fast**, we **first dispel dusty thoughts**.
May this **propagation and exposition** bring forth **illuminated virtue**.

Humbly, we reflect that your disciple **Certain** and the **ritual master**,
Since the **vast eons** and until this life,
Have **deep-rooted karmas** and **tenfold sins** as heavy obstacles.
Though we possess **wondrous and tranquil essence**,
We are **bewildered by passions**;
Though we hold **clear and luminous faculties**,
We are **obscured by worldly attachments**.

...

For **lust and hatred** are rampant, yet our **nature** stands as lofty as **lofty bamboo**;
Our **hearing and seeing** are dull, yet our **wisdom** is as blind as the deaf.

We cannot **guard our outer form**,
Yet suffer **many afflictions of the body**;
We cannot **restrain our speech**,
Yet commit **many transgressions of the tongue**.

Where the **mind** reaches, **desire** follows;
With **accumulated deeds**, we forge **endless sins**.

Now, facing the **Supreme Reality** and **repenting in earnest**,
We **cultivate the wondrous Dao** with **sincere practice**.

All **actions arise from the six roots**,
Each **particle of dust** is **delusion itself**;
Who among us does not bear **suffering in the body**?
Each **worldly thing** obscures the **True Nature**.

Thus, at this **sacred altar**,
We **banish all malevolent obstacles** in their entirety.

With **mind** purified and **inner contemplation** unimpeded,
Our **nature** remains **void and pristine**, and **external phenomena** no longer ensnare us.

All **flattery and deceit** are **severed**,
Every **greed and malice** is **cleansed away**.

Past **karmic deeds** shall never again lead us to **fall into ruin**;
Future **new afflictions** shall not be **cast into the abyss**.

May we **preserve our body** and **avoid all sins**,
Never **pursue worldly gain** while **forgetting the True Way**.

Humbly, we pray that all **sages** may **perceive clearly**,
That the **August Spirit** extends **far-reaching illumination**,
So that the **jewels of the Peach Blossom Spring** may **wash and purify** all hearts,
And the **sweet dew of the Dao’s radiance** may **cleanse away** every stain.

May the **root of crimes** be **extinguished**,
And the **luminous wisdom-nature** attain **perfect clarity**;
May our **devotion to goodness** be **steadfast and sincere**,
And we **await the blessings** of the **descending grace**.

With **calamity sunk to the nine depths**,
And **mercy rising to the ten directions**,
Your servants **bow in reverence** and offer **gratitude** to the **Supreme and Natural Three Treasures**.

We **declare the True Scripture**,
And when the **ritual master** raises the **metal bell**,
We **thrice chant and thrice prostrate** in homage,
**Reaffirming the sacred law’s position**.

Your servants, **[Name]** and the **congregated ritual officials**,
With **unified sincerity**, humbly petition:
**Primordial Heavenly Sovereign of Natural Beginning**,
**Supreme Dao Sovereign of Jade Morn**,
**Great King Laozi of the Golden Gate**,
**Supreme Jade Emperor of the Aught Heaven**,
**Nine Sovereigns of Ultimate Reverence**,
**Ten-Direction Spirit Treasures of Heavenly Sovereignty**,
**All Celestial Emperors**,
**Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures, the Supreme Master of the Mystic Law**,
**Upper Grand Minister, Upper Prime Official**,
**Upper Protector, Upper Attendant**,
**Three Officials and Five Emperors**,
**Eleven Great Luminaries**,
**Twelve Grand Celestial Ones**,
**Six Ministers of the Southern Dipper**,
**Seven Rulers of the Northern Dipper**,
**Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Heavenly Cycle, the Dry Symbol**,
**Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees of All Celestial Hosts**,
**Native Celestial Destiny**,
**Heavenly Tribunals of Official Duties**,
**True Sovereign of the Nine Heavens**,
**Three Mountains, Five Peaks, Pure Abodes of Blessing**,
**Thick Earthly Caverns of the Spirit Palace**,
**Rulers of the Altars and Peaks**,
**Responsive to the Three Realms**,
**All True Spirits**.

Your servants hear that **Heaven does not manifest omens**,
Yet **silently grants** the **command of preordained fate**;
That the **Emperor can descend judgments**,
And **graciously bestows** the **sentiments of divine favor**.

The servants, with zeal and earnestness, shall surely be guided to meet with **auspicious blessings**.

We, the ministers, follow the prescribed rites and laws,
Presenting clear and solemn rituals,
Opening the altar with the solemnity of evening’s vigil,
Speaking with heartfelt sincerity.

We seek to benefit the realm and family,
To universally aid both the living and the departed.
We begin with the **preliminary fasting and purification**,
And the **auspicious opening of the True Hall**,
As the **Celestial Dragon** ascends its petition,
And the **feathered banners** scatter in procession—
May the **Divine Spirit** behold us.

The **Sacred Chariot** demonstrates Heaven’s will,
Its power near at hand.
May we preserve and perfect all matters,
That both humans and celestial beings may be enriched;
May we achieve and refine our **cultivation and merit**,
That our aspirations may flourish and be fulfilled.

With sincerity now revealed, blessings take root,
And the disciples’ words are earnestly declared.
**The Declaration is spoken.**

Examine the words with clarity,
See the sincerity within.
Exhaust all pure intentions to redouble our efforts,
And gaze upon the **True Dao** until enlightenment dawns.

Gathered in the **crimson robes**, the assembly converges,
The **cloud-seals** unfold in number,
The **ornate altar** stands as **swords and girdles** draw near,
The **jade halberds** turn with the **banners’ shadows**.

Reverently presenting the **precious offerings** as tribute,
We pour the **sacred wine** to commune with the spirits.
The **bell and incense** resound in harmony,
As the **sincere words** are uttered in unison;
The **incense’s qi** ascends with the **virtue’s fragrance**.

Thus, the **dark and luminous** are in communion,
And the **Highest Spirits** respond with manifest grace.

We, the ministers, having assembled and taken our roles,
Follow the rites to proclaim the **sacred formulas**,
First invoking the **yin-time precepts**,
Taking today’s altar-opening as the commencement,
And proceeding with the **lawful rites**.

We humbly pray to the **Supreme Three Venerables**,
The **Ten Directions’ Holy Assembly**,
The **Playground of the Mystic Middle**’s Grand Master,
The **Responsive True Spirits**—
Commanding the **Supervising Officials of the Fasting Bureau** and the **Earthly Officials**,
To solemnly array the **Awe-Inspiring Spirits**,
To strictly consecrate the **altar’s precincts**,
That the **cloud-hosts may gather in ranks**,
And the **Heavenly Ensigns** may arrive,
So that **evil and impurity may be purged**,
And the **dust and miasma** kept far away,
That the cosmos may be serene and still,
And the **Eight Winds** cease to stir.

May our **spirit and qi** remain steadfast,
Our thoughts ever **sensitive to response**,
Our petitions ascending to the Highest,
Our **fasting merits** fully accomplished.

At dawn’s clarity and morning’s purity,
We proceed according to the **Law** and the **Way**,
Continuing to present our petitions.

**The Vow is made.**

The **Grand Assembly** is convened,
The **spirit is focused**, incense is burned.
The **High Functionary** restokes the incense burner.
The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**—
Let it be that at the very place where we have previously established the altar,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** shall naturally arise,
**Mushrooms and Hundred Spirits** flourish,
The **Multitudes of True Ones** gather here before this incense burner.

May our **ant-like sincerity** ascend to the Highest,
And the **Phoenix Palanquin** descend in response,
Examining the **Five Aggregates of our devotion**,
Fulfilling the **entire altar’s wish**,
That **disaster not arise** and **calamity not take root**,
That **longevity may extend** and **blessings multiply**,
That our **descendants and their descendants** may turn to ever-greater honor and nobility,
And that the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**,
Attending in the **orchid mist**,
May transmit our previously declared sincerity
Swiftly to the **Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao**,
The **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**,
Before the **August Heaven’s Golden Gate, Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**.

The **metal chimes** are struck,
The **praise is chanted in the hall**.

Exit the hall,
Lead to the **Six-Curtain Pavilion**.

The **Dao/Way Gate’s Complete Rules and Rituals**, Volume Seven concluded,
Volume Eight begins: **Master Guangcheng Du Guangting’s** edited and refined **Rituals for Disaster Elimination**—
**Setting the Jiao/Expiation Ritual** and **Performing the Dao/Way**.

The **Grand Master** raises the **Assembly of the Dao/Way**,
Each **officiant** and **disciple** observes the **Precepts** with reverence, as prescribed.

The **High Functionary** proclaims the **Soul-Guarding Incantations** of the **Five Stars**,
Their **illumination** shines forth across the **Five Directions**—
**Water Star** repels disasters, **Wood Virtue** brings prosperity.
**Mars** dissipates calamities, **Jupiter** wards off armies.
**Venus** steadies the four quarters, **benefiting** both **family and state**.
Their **names** are inscribed on **jade tablets**, their **words** recorded in the **Celestial Archives**—
**Riding the gusts** and **scattering the mists**, they **soar through the boundless void**,
**Entering and exiting the unseen realms**, they **roam and feast** across the **Ten Directions**.
The **Five Clouds** rise as their canopy, **summoning gods** and **subduing winds**,
**Commanding all spirits**, they stand guard before the **Celestial Sage**,
In **harmony** with the **Dao/Way’s** and the **True Ones’** essence.

The **Assembly of the Dao/Way** is raised,
The **Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

The **High Functionary** ignites the **Incense Furnace**—
To the **Supreme Three Heavens**, the **Primordial Origin of the Three Qi’s**,
The **Most High Laozi**, summoning forth from **my body** the **Three Five Officials**,
The **left and right attendants and messengers**,
The **left and right incense bearers**, the **Dragon Stationery Officials** and **Golden Boys**,
The **Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers**,
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, the **Direct Day Incense Officials**,
Each **thirty-six in number**, now **emerge**.

Those who **exit** are clad in **resplendent robes and adornments**,
Their **headgear and sashes** trailing **pendant ribbons**,
**Opening the gates** to this **locality’s earthly and territorial deities**, the **True Spirits** of the realm.

I, **your humble servant**, now **set the Jiao/Expiation Ritual** in earnest,
And **declare my sincerity**—
All **incense and offerings** are **duly recorded** in the **petition scrolls**.
May the **Most High Ten Directions’ Pure Ones** and the **Primordial Qi of the Dao/Way** descend,
Their **Sacred Treasures and Auspicious Light** flowing into **my body**,
So that my **declared sincerity** may swiftly reach
The **Supreme, Boundless, Great Dao/Way**,
The **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**,
The **Golden Gate of the August Heaven, Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**.

The **Assembly of the Dao/Way** is raised,
And the **Law-Position** is invoked.

With **all ranks** present, I, **your humble servant**, [name],
Alongside the **gathered officiants and disciples**,
Now **jointly declare our sincerity**—
To the **Voidless, Natural Primordial Origin**,
The **Most High Jade Morning Dao/Way Lord**,
The **Most High Golden Gate Laozi**,
The **Most High Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heaven**,
The **Nine Sovereigns, Most Venerable**,
The **Ten Directions’ Sacred Treasures**,
The **Heavenly Great Emperors**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures**,
The **Mysterious Middle Law-Masters**,
The **Upper Ministers and Upper Advisors**,
The **Upper Protectors and Upper Tutors**,
The **Three Officials and Five Emperors**,
The **Eleven Great Luminaries**,
The **Ten Gods, Supreme Unity**,
The **Southern Dipper’s Six Ministers**,
The **Northern Dipper’s Seven Elemental Stars**,
The **Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Revolving Sky**,
The **Twelve Palace Gods**,
The **Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees of Heavenly Hosts**,
The **Native Star of my Destiny**,
The **Celestial Tribunals**,
The **True Rulers of the Nine Heavens**,
The **Three Mountains and Five Peaks**, the **Lodges of Auspicious Peace**,
The **Abyssal Palaces of the Earthly Deeps**, the **Masters of the Altars and Mountains**,
The **Responsive Spirits of the Three Realms**,
All **True and Sacred Essences**.

I have heard:
The **Jade Heaven’s** distance is vast, yet **hardly ascended** by those in **great calamity**;
The **Golden Gate’s** heights are lofty, yet **merely gazed upon** by those in **humble lodgings**.

The **Most Venerable Sovereign** holds sway above,
The **Primordial Transformation** abides in the **center**.
He **opens the Ten Directions’ unobstructed hearts**,
**Responding to all things** with **action**—
He is the **Father of Great Compassion** across the **Three Realms**,
**Viewing all beings** with **pity**.

From the **Elevated Platform** to the **Lowly Dust**, from the **Unfolding of the Cosmic Scroll** to the **Tossing of the Mustard Seed’s Calamity**,
He **looks back** upon the **myriad myriads**, lamenting the **fleeting life** of the **Jin Dynasty’s insects**;
He **gazes down** upon the **nine dusts**, sighing for the **Han Palace’s ants**.

I, **your humble servant**, reflect upon my **lowly station**,
My **fate severed** from the **Celestial Path**—
Thus, I **rely upon** the **received teachings** and **rituals**,
And **diligently** explore the **subtle depths** of my **sincere supplications**.

Now, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],
**Hold the sacred talisman** and **seal the Dao/Way’s court**,
Hoping that **benevolent Heaven** may **observe below**,
And **perceive my slightest virtue** amidst the **dust of the world**.

I **humbly pray** that the **Nine Pure Ones, Most Holy**,
From the **Palace of the Curved and Secret**,
And the **Ten Extremes’ Primordial Sovereign**,
From the **Celestial Chariot of the Flying Void**,
With **hundreds of millions of Heavenly Servants** trailing behind,
And **thousands of officials** leading forth—
**Hurl flames ten thousand li**, calling forth **Yang** while summoning **Yin**;
**Turn incense in three cycles**, ascending from **sun** to **moon**.

To the **furthest East**, they **roam in scorching waters**,
To the **furthest West**, they **behold the setting of the Pei River’s mists**,
To the **South**, they **construct the Vermilion Peak’s Palace**,
In the **Center**, they **encircle the Yellow Congealing’s Hall**,
To the **North**, they **reach the Night City’s Gate**,
Below, they **exhaust the Chilly Spring’s depths**.

It is said that **Lu** is **called the Teacher of the Dao/Way**,
Following the **Great Primordial** in its **procession**—
And **Xi** is **named the World-Honored Sage**,
From the **extension of the True Ones** and their **secret attendance**.

The **Primordial Sovereign’s** **divine command**—
Who **dares not** **revere it**?
I **bow my heart** in **sincere supplication**,
And **look up** to the **cloud-borne arrival**.

I, **your humble disciple**, [name],
With the **fasting officiants**,
**Cannot express** our **deepest reverence**—
We **kneel and prostrate**, **twice bowing**, to **welcome the Sacred Procession**.

The **Celestial Chariot** arrives and **halts**,
The **Crane-Drawn Palanquin** **descends to the court**,
And **gathers with the Jiao’s assembled spirits**,
As **rituals of morning worship** are **performed**.

After the **morning worship** is **completed**,
We **request permission** to **ascend the Jiao platform**—
The **officiants** **present incense**,
And **offer the first libation**.

The **metal chimes** are struck,
**Flowers are scattered**, and **music is played**.

With **all ranks** present, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],
Alongside the **gathered platform officials**,
Now **renew my sincerity**—
To the **Three Pure Ones, Most Holy**, the **Treasure Realm’s True Spirits**.

Indeed,
The **Primordial Scene** is **universally spread**—
There is **no distinction** between **high and low**;
The **myriad myriads’ forms** are **all nurtured** by the **Pure and Gentle Qi**.

Since **life and death** are **distant realms**,
And **likes and dislikes** are **profoundly manifold**—
The **filthy body** may **indulge in depravity**,
Yet the **Great Dao/Way** **ever descends** to **bestow virtue**.

Some **offenses** are **deep-rooted**,
And **fears** of **karmic retribution** may **lie hidden**.
If one **awakens** to the **hundred faults**,
Then **all calamities** are **dissipated**.

Now, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],
**Recognize** my **spirit’s stagnation** and **soul’s terror**—
From the **great calamity**, I **have fallen into ruin**,
And **lost the Primordial Essence**, **fleeing in agitation**.

I **do not climb** the **Awakening Tree**,
Yet **take delight** in the **flaming peak**;
I **do not enter** the **True Court**,
Yet **am content** to **burn in the House of Fire**.

The **Six Tribunals** **run wild**, the **Three Karmas** **entangle me**—
Only through the **Highest Sage’s** **proclaimed compassion**,
The **Great Shelter** for **sentient beings**, may **salvation** be **opened**.

Now, I, **your humble disciple**, [name],
**Return to the Dao/Way** and **bow my head**,
**Praying** for **Heaven’s vast mercy**—
I **humbly beg** the **Most Holy Upper Spirits**,
The **Highest True Emperors**,
To **bestow grace** and **deliver my suffering**,
To **grant life** and **remove my calamities**.

「Now I humbly seek to **resolve the karmic debts of my mortal form**,
And **erase the dark records of my past sins**.

**Before their appointed time**, my crimes shall be **cleared as ice**,
And **my misdeeds awaited**, like **refined clouds** in the sky.

**I kneel in submission**, awaiting **divine response**,
**Withdrawing my earthly concerns** to **offer my heartfelt plea**.

I wish to **present my words sincerely**,
And **enter the sacred threshold** with **devout reverence**.

Though I have **already pondered deeply**,
I still **fear discrepancies**,
Yet **dare to violate Heaven’s prohibitions**,
And **tremble in awe** as I **submit my petition**.
With **pure intent and solemn sincerity**,
I **solemnly vow** to **proclaim my supplications**.

**My words are presented**—
As they speak, **the scripture’s logic is deeply resonant**.
**I bare my blood-and-guts devotion**,
And **pour forth my heart’s true essence**.

**I bow in humility**, extending **my childlike sincerity**,
And **hope to fulfill** the **quota of reverence**.

**I look upward**, beseeching **the Most Holy Celestial Spirits**,
The **Three Bureaus’** **mighty and numinous presence**,
To **bestow their radiant grace**,
And **pierce through with their luminous discernment**.

**I humbly pray** that my **rites of purification** be **recorded in the celestial ledgers**,
And **my Daoist attainments** **benefit my being**,
To **increase my lifespan and prosperity** in **the future**,
And **preserve my longevity and fortune** in **the past**.

**I rely upon the Most Holy’s virtue**,
And **shall seek their blessings and protection**.

I, **your humble disciple**, along with **the Daoist ritual officials**,
**With utmost earnestness**, **prostrate myself twice**,
**Offering incense and libations** in **final tribute**.

**Music is played**.

I **repeatedly express my sincerity**,
And **report to the Nine Celestial Worthies of High Purity**,
The **Ten Supreme High Daoists**,
The **responsive assembly of all true spirits**.

I **hear that the Jade Emperor observes with insight**,
And the **Golden Worthies** **attend with scrutiny**,
**Moved by the universal reverence** of **sentient beings**,
And **bestowing blessings** upon **all ranks and kinds**.

The **worthy scholar** **aspires to transcendence**,
And **is thus rewarded** by the **thousands of true spirits**.
The **virtuous person** **seeks blessings**,
And **is thus granted** the **hundreds of harmonious virtues**.

**Daoist nobility is refined and subtle**,
And **rites must align with divine resonance**.

Now, I, **your humble disciple**,
**Raise my voice in the pure night**,
**Express my earnest intent at the crimson gate**,
And **present my sincere heart**, **hoping to receive celestial favor**.

**I humbly pray** for **release from worldly entanglements**,
And **advancement to the Daoist stages**.

May my **entire household** **be illuminated** like the **Lius**,
And **all ascend to the Pavilion of Harmony**;
Or like the **entire clan of Liu Gang**,
And **universally rise to the Single Green Heaven**.

May I **escape the cycles of yin and yang**,
And **forever sever the roots of life and death**.

Whether **seeking worldly gains through officialdom**,
Or **accumulating wealth through commerce**,
**All shall achieve** **eminence and prosperity**;
**Nobles and commoners alike**, **within and without**, **thrive in splendor**.

May **grievances between the living and the dead** cease,
And **all paths** **yield the beauty of harmonious blessings**.
May **equitable joy and prosperity** **continue unbroken**,
And **blessings extend to near and far**.

Disasters of **water, fire, military strife, and bandits**—
**None shall intrude upon my home**.
Calamities of **husbands, wives, daughters, and sons**—
**None shall harm my body**.

May **all my descendants be preserved in life**,
And **our lineage’s sacred fires** **endure eternally**.

I, **your humble disciple**, along with **the Daoist ritual officials**,
**With utmost fervor**, **prostrate myself twice**,
**Offering incense and libations** in **final tribute**.

**Music is played**.

I **repeatedly express my sincerity**,
And **report to the Three Bureaus’ true spirits**,
That the **rites of purification** **are now complete**,
And the **month of offerings** **has concluded in the Grand Compliance**.

The **phoenix crown and lamp flames**—
**Soon shall dim** in the **hundreds of libations**.
The **magpie’s tail and incense smoke**—
**Already rise** in the **thousands of harmonies**.

**The Eight Trigrams’** **divine charts** are **revealed**,
And **three measures of jade wine** are **offered**.
**The vermilion fire is kindled** at the **Heavenly Treasury**,
And **returns to the void**.
**The jade bells are struck** in **Daoist melody**,
And **shall ascend to the celestial realm**.

**The Jade Scepter** **communicates through the Purple Void**,
And the **Treasure Canopy** **floats in the Azure Han**.
**Those who depart for the Jade Capital**—
**The Emperor of Non-Extinction**—
**And those who ascend to the Golden Gate**—
**The Supreme True Sovereign**.

**All spirits follow** at the **crimson chariot**,
And **all saints march** in **purple procession**.
Beside the **flying moon phoenix**, they **point to the cavernous chamber**,
And **guide the cloud-dragging dragon**, **gazing upon the boundless seas**.

**The deities resume their duties**,
And the **officers return to their stations**.
**The blessings of purification** are **bestowed upon the hall**,
And the **spirits’ radiance** is **manifest before our eyes**.

As for **all living beings**,
They **all share equally** in the **private joy of nurturing**.
And in the **nine deepest abysses**,
They **all receive** the **blessings of transcendence**.

**I gaze fixedly upon the departing rites**,
And **meditate upon the boundless void**,
**Lamenting the dusty world**,
And **difficulty in retaining the sacred footsteps**.

I, **your humble disciple**, along with **the Daoist ritual officials**,
**With deepest attachment and longing**,
**Escort the sacred procession**.

**The music of the stone chimes is raised**,
And the **sacred hymns are sung**.

**The grand lecture is concluded**,
And the **incense is burned in reverence**.

At the **Incense Officials’** command—**Messengers, Dragon-Horse Lords of the Left and Right, and all the Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**—
when I, **your humble disciple**, now establish the **Ritual Platform for Morning Offerings and Devotions (朝修之所)**,
**golden elixirs and jade-green essences** shall naturally arise,
and **hundreds of numinous herbs and spirits** gather.
**All the Perfected Ones** shall convene here before this **Incense Furnace of the Dao**.

I now **pray to the Celestial Children and Jade Maidens of the Ten Quarters**,
to **attend the fragrant vapors** and **convey the sincerity** of what I have long **petitioned to the Supreme Dao of the Unbounded, Limitless, and Ultimate Truth**—
the **Three Pure Ones, Most Sacred**, and **Emperor of Jade’s Golden Gateway, the Heavenly Sovereign**—
that my **supplications may swiftly reach** their **Divine Presence**.

**The Heavenly Worthy of the Precious Flower** is **invoked to perfection**,
and **music is played**.

**The Spirits are sent back**,
**wealth is transformed**,
**offerings are returned**,
**merits are dedicated**,
and **the rites are concluded**.

**Entering and exiting the hidden realms**,
they **feast and revel in the Ten Quarters**.
**The Five Clouds float as banners**,
summoning spirits and **restraining the winds**.

**They command all ten thousand spirits**,
**guard the Daoist Ancestors**,
and **harmonize with the True Perfected Ones**.

**The Grand Lecture is concluded**,
and **the Dao Drum is struck twenty-four times**.

**The High Functionary opens the Furnace**.

**The Three Sovereigns of the Highest Heavens—**the **Primordial Worthy of the Mysterious Beginning (玄元始)**, the **Three Essences (三炁)**—
**the Most High Lord Lao**,
**summon forth** from my body
**the Thirty-Five Functionaries of the Five Agents (三五功曹)**,
**the Left and Right Attendant Officials and Messengers**,
**the Left and Right Incense-Bearers**,
**the Dragon-Horse Cavalry and Attendant Officers**,
**the Golden Boys Attending Incense**,
**the Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers**,
**the Twelve Imperial Talismans (五帝直符)**,
**the Talismans of the True Sun (直日香官使者)**,
each **thirty-six persons** appearing.

**Those who emerge** are **adorned in solemn and resplendent robes**,
**their headgear and ribbons hanging in order**,
**opening the pathways for all spirits and deities** within this **local domain**.

Now, **as I, your humble disciple**, establish this **Ritual Platform for Morning Offerings and Devotions**,
I **solemnly present** this **supplication with deepest sincerity**,
and **all the elixirs of the elixir field (丹悃)** are **duly recorded** in the **petition text**.
I **pray that the Most High Dao of the Ten Quarters’ True Perfected Ones** may **descend their Sacred Light and Auspicious Radiance (灵宝瑞光)**,
**flowing into my body**,
so that my **supplications may swiftly reach** the **Divine Presence of the Supreme Dao of the Unbounded, Limitless, and Ultimate Truth**—
the **Three Pure Ones, Most Sacred**, and **Emperor of Jade’s Golden Gateway, the Heavenly Sovereign**—

**I request the invocation of the Daoist ranks**.

**With all ranks present**, I, **your humble disciple [name]**, along with **the Ritual Platform Officials and Assembly**,
**now humbly unite in sincerity** to **petition**:

**The Worthy of the Void-Natural Primordial Beginning (虚无自然元始天尊)**,
**the Most High Dao Lord of the Jade Morning (玉晨大道君)**,
**the Most High Lord Lao of the Golden Gateway (金阙老君)**,
**the Most High Emperor of Jade, the Heavenly Sovereign (昊天玉皇上帝)**,
**the Nine Sovereigns of Ultimate Veneration (九皇至尊)**,
**the Ten-Quarter Worthy of the Sacred Treasure (十方灵宝天尊)**,
**all the Heavenly Sovereigns**,
**the Thirty-Six Departments of the Worthy Scriptures, the Supreme Master of the Mysterious Dao (尊经玄中大法师)**,
**the Highest Prime Minister and Highest Chancellor (上相上宰)**,
**the Highest Protector and Highest Tutor (上保上傅)**,
**the Three Officials and Five Emperors (三官五帝)**,
**the Eleven Great Luminaries of the Stars (十一大曜星君)**,
**the Twelve Gods of the Supreme One (十神太一真君)**,
**the Six Administrators of the Southern Dipper (南斗六司星君)**,
**the Seven Primordial Stars of the Northern Dipper (北斗七元星君)**,
**the Twenty-Eight Constellations of the Heavenly Symbol (周天乾象二十八宿)**,
**the Twelve Palace Gods (十二宫神)**,
**the Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees of All Heavenly Constellations (三百六十五度诸天列宿)**,
**my natal star and destiny (本命元辰)**,
**the Celestial Tribunals and their Functionaries (天曹职司)**,
**the True Rulers of the Nine Heavens (九天真宰)**,
**the Three Mountains, Five Peaks (三山五岳)**,
**the Rulers of Auspicious Terrains and Tranquil Abodes (福地靖庐)**,
**the Rulers of Thick Terrains and Cavernous Palaces (厚地洞宫)**,
**the Rulers of the Sacred Altars and Marshes (岳渎主宰)**,
**the responsive Three Realms (三界应感)**,
and **all the True Spirits**.

I have **heard that in ancient times, during the延康 era (Yán-Kāng)**,
**the *qi* had not yet divided into purity and turbidity**;
**when the Great Polarity was first established (肇判太极)**,
**form was then properly aligned with the square and round**.

The One generates the Two, and the Two generates the Three;
Earth follows Heaven, and Heaven follows the Dao.

Above, the stars and constellations are arrayed;
Below, the mountains and rivers are arranged.

The Three Pure Ones are the most exalted of all saints,
The Four Palaces receive the duties of myriad spirits.

Beyond the dim and obscure, within the vague and indistinct,
Some form palaces from mist,
Others build halls from gathered clouds.

The assembled immortals stand in ranks,
Paying homage to the august Sovereign of the Great Effulgence;
The myriad phenomena revolve in harmony,
Bowing in reverence to the Purple Enceinte Emperor.

Even unto the Great Thousandfold Sand Realm,
The Boundless Divine Realm,
Palaces bear names of springs and curves,
Mountains bear names of Luo and Teng.

Officials govern over Heaven, Earth, and Water,
Departments are divided into left, right, and center.

The Thirty-Six Tribunals, the Twenty-Four Prisons,
Dim as the tortoise peaks, vast as the peng sea.
The whale stirs waves and spews clouds and thunder,
The sea-serpent exhales mist and forms pavilions and halls.

The Golden Platforms and Jade Observatories
Lie beyond the Weak Waters, boundless in extent;
The Serpent Chambers and Dragon Palaces
Guard the deep abyss, unfathomable in depth.

The saints of the Yang Interval,
The enshrined and honored deities,
If they can indeed be summoned by the Great Ritual,
Or transformed to diligently serve,
The Yellow Emperor established their names,
And the Hundred Things revered the Earthly Sovereign,
Ranked across the Nine Regions.

Even unto the enfeoffments of prefectures and counties,
The city gods and their guardians,
For the sake of the state,
There are ancestral altars,
Recorded in the sacrificial canons,
In accordance with the laws of the sage kings.

Thus, the Great Void is clear and bright,
The constellations shine resplendent,
Lanterns intermingle with orchid and cassia lights,
Incense curls from sandalwood censers.

I humbly pray for the cranes and phoenixes to harness,
Their ranks descending from the distant heavens;
For the wind-horses and cloud-chariots to pass in procession,
Descending in majesty upon the mortal realm.

The humble臣 and the officials of the Ritual Bureau of代, in solemn obeisance and twice-bowed reverence, now present their respects and invite the Sacred Procession.

Let the ranks of the Two Classes of Saints descend.
The Three Realms’ multitude of True Ones, arrayed upon the *jiào* feast, extend their prostrations and earnest petitions, humbly awaiting the radiant descent.

May they each align in the ranks of the Celestial Host,
And together, with reverent deference, welcome the Imperial Procession.

Descend, O Emperor, upon the Cloud-Carriage.
When the Crane-Carriage arrives and halts,
And the Phoenix-Carriage takes its place before the court,
The *jiào* feast’s assembled True Ones shall observe the ritual as in a grand audience.

Having completed the morning rites,
We request ascent to the *jiào* feast’s table,
Where the Ritual Officials shall offer incense,
And arrange the first prostrations and libations of wine.

Let the *zhì* bell be struck,
Scatter the flowers,
And perform the music.

With the officials of all ranks and the humble臣某, in earnest sincerity, we now address:
The Three Pure Ones, Most Sacred,
And the Precious Realm’s numinous spirits.

We have heard that the Idle Lotus Platform is the dwelling of the Most High;
And the Great Floating Earth is where the Celestial Lord expounds the Dharma in its time.

Moved by the inclination of a single nation’s heart,
And the summoning of the Ten Directions to their seat.

First ascending the Lion’s Peak,
Then entering the Precious Pearl’s midst,
They guide the multitude of beings,
And unfold the wondrous Dao.

At its beginning, in one passage,
The deaf and the ailing are all cured;
At its end, in ten repetitions,
Even withered bones are reborn as whole.

The Four *qì* resound and clarify,
Illuminating all spirits across the cosmos;
The Five Colors flourish in abundance,
Enhancing the Celestial retinue in the void.

From then on, the True Doctrine flourishes and spreads,
Its profound teachings disseminated far and wide—
Above, to dispel calamities,
Below, to deliver the people.

Without the Two Luminaries, there would be no brightness;
Without the Two Principles, no order would stand.
None but the True Persons can fully know it,
Only the highest sages can practice it with might.

When the Most High descended in the Zhou’s early years,
And the Celestial Master arose in the Han dynasty,
They transmitted the method of presenting petitions and offerings,
And demonstrated the rituals of establishing *zhāi* feasts and *jiào* ceremonies—
Illuminated as if inscribed in crimson and gold,
Shining forth like the sun and moon.

Yet we, the humble臣, feel shame
To be reckoned among the Celestial Host;
Our hearts are like scattered reeds, unable to grasp the Mystic Pass,
And our eyes, like withered stalks, cannot peer into the Sacred Domain.

We hold the Yellow and Purple, yet know not the flow of the Seven Elixirs;
We emerge from the Blue and enter the Black, yet comprehend not the inhalation and exhalation of the Two *qì*.

Though our understanding of the True Way is dim,
Our foremost intent is to benefit the world.
Thus, the *jiào* master某, though bound in the mortal realm,
Turns his heart to the Ultimate Dao,
And with his entire clan offers solemn prayers,
Twice-bowed in reverence, to welcome the True Ones.

We humbly reflect upon the lofty celestial signs,
Where responses echo like the reverberations of a bell;
And the sincere yearnings of the common heart,
Where supplications and averting of misfortune find no greater efficacy than in pure devotion.

Thus, though millet and barley lack fragrance,
It is the white hemp that may be offered in devotion.

The sincerity and earnestness of our petitions
Are fully expressed in these words.
With reverence before the lofty True Ones,
We solemnly declare them as follows:

**Proclamation of Words:**
As the words attest, our devotion is sincere and profound.
Whatever is proclaimed and inscribed shall surely be answered in kind.

I have heard that the Three Bright Ones illuminate,
And the Five Classics unfold—
These are called the Heavenly Roots,
And thus they preserve the eons of the cosmos.

The Primordial Thread unfurls through all ten directions;
The Vital *qi* of the *Fan* pervades and gives rise to all things.

When first the myriad creatures emerged,
And the dark *yin* nurtured the common folk—
To govern blessings and calamities,
The stars and constellations shift in their courses;
To manifest responses and omens,
The thunder and lightning strike with wrath.

Only the Sovereign Emperor of Heaven
Rules supreme over all living beings;
The boundless Heaven above
Truly enfolds and watches over the earth below.

Thus, there exist methods of purification and expiation,
To serve as rites of *jiào* and thanksgiving.

The *jiào* master某, humbly reflecting,
Knows his nature is inherently flawed and borrowed,
Born into this mortal realm,
Yet blessed by the enlightened governance of the Sage Emperor,
And steeped in the refined customs of the Central Kingdom.

Greed, hatred, and delusion—
How could he escape transgression?
Body, speech, and mind—
How could he be without fault?

「From the countless ages past until this very life,
Some have served their lords yet lacked true loyalty,
Others have tended their parents yet failed in filial piety—
Abandoning kindness and thrift.

Some have violated the teachings of the Three Treasures,
Committing theft and lewdness;
Others have transgressed the Nine True Precepts,
Holding affection for monks while harboring deceit,
Curving their words to flatter,
Pointing to Heaven and Earth to swear oaths,
Invoking deities to curse and damn.

In trade and exchange, they seek only self-gain to harm others;
In actions and conduct, they act contrary to the True and betray the Dao.

Below, they chase fleeing beasts;
Above, they shoot winged fowl—
Wanton slaughter in the space between blade and board,
Unrestrained revelry at the feast of cups and dishes.

Thus, their misdeeds sink deeper than the Stygian Sea,
Their sins accumulate higher than mountains—
The Three Corpses [三尸] chant in the vault above,
The Five Emperors [五帝] speak in the netherworld below.

The Master of Life seizes their fate,
For their deeds are unkind and their calamities remain.

The Way of Heaven brings disaster and affliction,
Yet they gain no merit through prayer.

Now, in repentance and remorse,
They earnestly wish to purge all sins.

They rely on the boundless grace of the Supreme,
And humbly beg for forgiveness of countless lives’ transgressions.

From this day forward, may they never forget the resolve to amend;
For future deeds, may they find the path to true renewal.

The *jiào* master and officials, with utmost fervor,
Prostrate themselves in reverence, offering incense and libations.

We, the *jiào* master and officials, with sincere devotion,
Address the Three Pure Ones [三清] and the Celestial Saints [上圣],
The True Spirits of the Precious Realm [宝界真灵].

We hear that the Great Dao is formless,
Yet boldly named as *Dao*.
All things return to it yet it claims no ownership;
The common folk employ it yet cannot fathom its source.

At the wilds of Shāngchéng [襄城],
Even the Seven Saints are lost;
Within the walls of Jùguó [束郭],
The Nine Years’ Great Mystery [九年大妙] is heard.

The method of *Fùmò* [副墨] began with the Lu recitation [洛诵],
The depths of *Xuānmíng* [玄冥] were drawn from Shānmíng [参寥].

To seek the fish, one must not forget the basket;
To exhaust the meaning, one must first establish the symbol.

Then it is known that color is not color,
And the Mystic Vision [玄览] reveals without blemish;
That emptiness is not emptiness,
And the Void Chamber [虚室] gives birth to whiteness.

To perfect one’s nature begins with daily self-abnegation,
To restore one’s life ends with non-action.

Entering the Gate of Profound Mysteries [众妙门],
Free from all nets of doubt.

Thirty-six divisions,
Over five thousand teachings—
Some transmitted among mortals,
Others hidden in the heavens.

Those who revere and honor them receive blessings,
Those who slight or neglect them invite calamity.

The *jiào* master reflects on his humble, fleeting life,
Like grass and insects, frail and insignificant—
Gazing upward to the lofty vault [高穹],
Turning toward the Verdant Netherworld [碧落] in sincere devotion.

Like the otter offering fish to its gods,
He hopes for the virtue of response and communion;
Like the sunflower turning to the sun,
He seeks only to bend in prayerful reverence.

Thus, he recites the scriptures of the Three Caverns [三洞],
And sustains the incense and flames for two or three hours.

The revolving *Xuánjī* [璇玑] aligns the heavens,
The resonant *Línláng* [琳琅] awakens all divine spirits.

With this most solemn offering,
He seeks the unending blessings of the Dao.

Above, he purges the Nine Solar Calamities [阳九之数],
Below, he expiates the One Hundred and Six Earthly Disasters [百六之灾].

Long life and peace for the aged,
Serenity within and without.

He records the names in the Celestial Register [丹台],
And petitions the True Master of Fate [真君] to extend our years upon the Jade Tablets [青简].

May we live eternally, gazing far,
Day by day growing richer, month by month prospering—
Enjoying the fullness of the Five Auspicious Blessings [五福],
And attaining a hundred years of enduring peace.

There must be lasting fortune,
In perfect accord with the *Yì* [《易》];
All inauspiciousness must be dispelled,
Conforming to the words of the Daoist Scriptures [仙经].

We, the *jiào* master and officials, with utmost supplication,
Prostrate ourselves in reverence, offering incense and libations.

With music played,
We, the humble officials and the assembled *jiào* attendants,
With sincere devotion,
Address the Supreme and Formless Sage [虚无至圣],
The True Spirits of the Three Realms [三界群真],
Humbly awaiting their vast compassion,
And their penetrating, enlightened discernment.

We hear that the Great Dao is profound and vast,
And to seek it is no simple task.

True grace is distant and unfathomable,
And to attain it is most difficult.

Yet, how much more so when we dare to hope for private favor,
Without doubt deserving the merit of expiation.

How much more so when we offer our feeble prayers,
And rely on sincerity of speech!

With earnest intent and reverent devotion,
May our words soak into the Sacred Hearing [圣聪],
And our pleas reach the True Listening [真听].

The *jiào* master, though unworthy of life’s blessing,
Seeks only what is good.

He fears the errors of the Three Karmic Actions [三业],
And the taint upon the records of the Celestial Bureaucracy [列曹].

The stars and omens converge,
And the calamitous numbers are upon us.

If not for the secret prayers of purification and expiation,
How could we hope for mercy and pardon?

We follow the prescribed rites and formulas,
And solemnly list our petitions—
Bathing our bodies and minds in ritual purity,
With utmost sincerity, we present our prayers,
Hoping to ascend to the Primordial Pole [元极],
And forever align with the common will.

We beseech thee, for the *jiào* master,
To purge celestial disasters,
To scatter earthly calamities—
Freeing him from all misfortune within this year,
From the four seasons’ months,
From the movements of the Five Stars [五星],
From the four pillars’ punishments [四柱相刑],
From every inauspicious fate.

May his years of life be long and distant,
Like the eternal pines and cypress;
May his calamities be stilled and never arise,
Like the fragrant orchids and sweetgrass.

May music be played.」

「The noble lineage shines with splendor,
And descendants flourish in prosperity—
Bringing harmony and peace to the realm,
Enjoying the pure and virtuous breezes of the age.

The Three Lights [三光] radiate brightly in the vault of heaven,
And the Nine Crops [九稼] grow abundantly upon the earth below.

Border beacons cease their warnings,
And the distant wilderness returns to the Way [仁].

Mountains and rivers display auspicious omens,
And the numinous and divine [神明] gather blessings in concert.

The Three Realms [三涂] and Six Paths [六趣] alike rest in their hidden prisons no more.
All living, growing, flying, and submerged beings
Are equally nurtured and sustained.

The Celestial Officials [天司] and the Earthly Bureaus [地府],
The lunar attendants [月职幽僚] and the mountain streams [岳渎山川],
The divine and sacred [神明] now order their ranks—
Promoting the Dao/Way’s winds [道风] and aiding transformation,
Dispelling malevolent *qi* [邪沴] to bring peace to the people.

May the sovereign wish that heaven and earth follow their proper rhythms,
And the four seasons thus be perfected;
May yin and yang be in harmony,
And all things flourish accordingly.

The gentle wind and the rain of the *kǎn* [坎] hexagram
Shall always bring deep and ample nourishment to the fields;
The droughts of *xùn* [旱魃] and water demons [水妖]
Shall never encroach upon the allotted domains.

Malevolent ghosts [鬼邪] shall perish in brilliance,
And epidemics [时疫] dare not spread their influence;
The divine shall guard the gates,
And strange portents naturally subside and be quelled.

Beneath the vast heavens and across the boundless earth,
A domain of longevity and springtime prosperity.

With utmost reverence and humility,
Your subjects bow twice and present this offering.

Music shall be played.
The sacred titles shall be invoked again in solemn recitation.»

The officials of all ranks, including the undersigned subject [某], together with the officers and assembly at the altar, with utmost sincerity and reverence, humbly petition the Most Venerable Nine Sovereigns of the Great Luo, the Ten-Directional Most Holy Ones, the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.

We have heard that the highest reaches ascend to the Round Luo, while the lowest extend to the Four Quarters. The boundless ranks of saints and the positioned True Immortals—some preside over the Golden Gates and Jade Palaces, others govern the Tartarus, the Tai Mountains, or the rivers and seas, while some oversee the altars and shrines. When they descend, they float upon the void and arrive; when they depart, they move without trace. Ten thousand steeds move in unison, escorting the natural array of ceremonial attendants; the Nine Phoenixes harmonize their cries, borne aloft by wind and cloud in swift passage.

We, your subjects, gaze upward in awe as Your celestial chariots ascend the Azure Expanse. Though our hearts yearn to follow, we kneel in reverence to bid You farewell.

At the sound of the *zhì* [知磬] gong, we chant the Sacred Hymns in Your honor. The Grand Lecture begins, and we focus our spirit to burn incense. The incense officials, the messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials—may they now cause this altar of our ritual offering to spontaneously generate the Golden Elixir and Jade-Green Pills, the hundred spirits of mushrooms and herbs, as the multitudes of True Ones gather before this incense brazier.

May we pray that the Ten-Directional Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens attend to the fragrant vapors, conveying our sincere petition of old directly to the Most High, Boundless, Supreme Dao; the Three Pure Ones, Most Holy; and before the Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Golden Gates of the Celestial Vault.

With the Perfect Flower of the Heavenly Worthy completed, music shall be played.

The spirits are sent forth, the offerings are transformed, and all is returned to its source. The rites are concluded. Thus ends *The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume Nine*.
Thus begins *The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume Ten*.

**Master Guangcheng of Mr. Du Guangting’s Compiled and Edited *Ritual of the Numinous Treasure, Great Unity, for Invoking Rain***

This ritual does not involve the Nine Sovereigns.
For all who take faith, only the *Jade Palace* is to be invoked.

The **Twelve Divisions of the Dao Field** are to be arranged according to the diagram of the rear altar, allowing only the finest **Twelve Divisions of superior-grade paper and writing implements**. Civil officials and commoners are not permitted to ascend the platform or participate.

This ritual is highly efficacious—**twelve seats** shall be established, and none may be slighted or made carelessly.

Incense of **Descending Truth** (降真香), **Mao** (茆香), **Cedar** (沉香), **Dragon’s Spittle** (龙涎香), and **Pure Sandalwood** (清木香) is to be used; **Sandalwood** (檀香) is forbidden, as it obstructs the Celestial Precepts. Violators shall be deprived of merit.

**Ritual Observance at Night**
The ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.
The **Grand Master** (都讲) leads the assembly, while each disciple pays homage to the **Preceptor** (师) in accordance with the Dao.

The **High Functionary** (高功) proclaims the **Spiritual Guards’ Mantras** (灵咒).
**Qingyang** (青阳) radiates in its void, its brilliance returning to the **Divine** (灵).
The **Spiritual Tiger** (神虎) repels malevolence, while the **Flying Celestial** (飞天) tolls its bells.
**Delusion is shattered, trials extinguished**, and **ten thousand demons bound in form**.
The **Nine Mysteries** (九微) return to the Dao, and the **Eight Powers** (八威) subdue the **Essence** (精).
The **Thousand True Ones** (千真) verify the records, and the **Three Elements** (三元) disperse the **Pure** (清).

The **Left Whistler** (左啸) of the **Central Yellow** (中黄), the **Right Strategist** (右策) of the **Six Ding** (六丁),
**seven rotations and eight harmonizations** (七转八合), circling the **Celestial Scriptures** (天经).
The **Holy Transformation** (圣化) stands majestic, and the **Great Dao** (大道) is set in motion.
The **Auspicious Clouds** (庆云) flow and spread, converging with the **Bright Landscape** (合景) of the **Yellow Court** (黄庭),
**uniting in harmony with the Dao’s True Essence** (和与道合真).

The **Grand Master** (都讲) leads the assembly, and the **Law Drum** (法鼓) is struck **twenty-four times** (二十四通).
The **High Functionary** (高功) ignites the furnace.

Invoked are the **Supreme Three Heavens** (三天), **Primordial Origin of the Three Essences** (玄元始三炁),
**The Most High Lord Lao** (太上老君),
who summons forth from my body the **Thirty-Five Officials of the Three and Five** (三五功曹), **Left and Right Attendants** (左右官使者), **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** (左右捧香), **Postal Dragons and Mounted Officials** (驿龙骑吏), **Golden Boy Incense-Keepers** (侍香金童), and **Jade Maiden Flower-Dispersers** (传言散花玉女)—**thirty-six each** (各三十六人出).

Those summoned must be attired in solemn robes.
The **local land and soil spirits** (此间土地正神) are to be invoked and closed.

I, **disciple of such-and-such state/county** (某州某),
**humble and sincere**, petition for my realm:
Since the arrival of **spring** (阳春), the **sweet dew** (膏雨) has long been withheld.
The **long clouds of summer** (夏云) have lingered, and the **gentle rain** (甘雨) is delayed.
The **autumn clouds** (秋云) of **commercial harvest** (商秋) have gathered, yet the **auspicious rain** (嘉雨) remains absent.

I now request, with my **Preceptor and all ritual officials** (临坛官众等),
to establish the **Dao Field of the Numinous Treasure, Great Unity, for Invoking Rain** (灵宝太一祈雨道场)
and to **dispel and scatter** (罢散) the **Twelve Divisions of the ritual** (设醮一十二分).
I pray that the **True Essence** (真造) descends and the **Divine** (真) examines my humble sincerity,
bestowing **sweet dew** (甘泽) as **mist** (雾), fulfilling the **people’s thirst** (黎元之涸望).

My **sincere and earnest petitions** (诸诚恳) are fully recorded in the **Blue Scriptures** (青词).
I wish to receive the **Most High’s True Essence of the Ten Directions** (十方正真生炁),
flowing into my body, so that my **sincere supplications** (所启之诚)
may swiftly reach the **Supreme Court of Purple Mystery and Jade Palace** (上清紫微碧玉宫),
the **Great Unity Emperor of the Celestial Vault** (太一大天帝),
the **Left Celestial Dragon** (左仙龙王) and **Right Celestial Dragon** (右仙龙王) within the **Jade Palace’s Inner Precincts** (紫微碧玉宫内院),
the **True Official of Great Unity** (太一真官天顺君),
the **Numinous Master of Great Unity’s Pure Stream** (太一清灵宝川真人),
the **Eastern Peak Emperor of Heavenly Equality and Human Benevolence** (东岳天齐仁圣帝),
the **Manifest King of the River’s Auspicious Response and Overwhelming Might** (江渎昭灵孚应威烈广源王),
the **First Attendant of the Inner Precincts** (内院直事一使者),
the **Second Attendant of the Inner Precincts** (内院直事二使者),
the **Third Attendant of the Inner Precincts** (内院直事三使者),
the **Day Official of the Five Directions** (日直功曹),
the **local land spirit** (当所土地),
the **Three Realms’ responsive deities** (三界应感),
and **all mighty and numinous powers** (一切威灵).

I have heard that the **Five Directions’ Cloud Seals** (五方云篆) are the **first safeguards for peace in the family and the state** (保家宁国之先);
and that the **Three Caverns’ Illuminated Precepts** (三洞明科) are the **essential means for saving beings and securing the people** (济物安民之要).

The **humans and heavens** rely upon them, both ancient and modern follow in their footsteps.
Above, they regulate the **celestial hosts’** (列宿) celestial movements and below, they respond to the **pleas of all living beings** (群生之沥祷).
Now, as the **current moment and place** (当境) approach, the rains have **failed to arrive on schedule** (愆期), and the crops are **near withering** (就槁).
The people’s distress is **deeper than ravines and valleys** (深於沟壑), yet no **harvesting success** (功) is achieved in the **fields** (田畴).
In awe of the **Supreme Dao’s** (上帝) benevolence toward life, and unable to bear the sight of the people **facing death** (就死),
I humbly submit this **sincere petition** (纡诚恳),
hoping to receive **special grace** (殊休).

May the **Heavenly Dao** (道恩) grant its **merciful favor** (善贷) and **inspect and respond** (天鉴顺临).
When **clouds rise and *qi* ascends** (云升气上), may it command the **spirits of mountains and marshes** (山泽之灵);
When the **armor of the earth is split** (甲拆勾萌), may it **bestow the nourishment of rivers and streams** (沐浴江河之润).

All who hold **sincere devotion** (恳悃),
dare not fail to **report this to the heavens** (上闻).
With **fasting resolve** (斋意) and **heartfelt words** (心词), I solemnly declare them for **proclamation and supplication** (宣奏).

**Proclamation:**
I request the **attendants** (官) to ascend and offer incense (上香).
Once the **petition’s meaning is fully declared** (词意具宣), the **fasting sincerity** (斋诚) will surely be **rewarded** (必享).

I have heard that the **Dragon’s** (龙) flight and **soaring** (飞跃) are **unbounded in their transformations** (运变化之无方);
Yet all things have **beginning and end** (始终), and **life’s creation depends on conditions** (生成之有待).
After **entreaties to Heaven have been poured out** (吁天之沥恳),
I shall **await the appointed day to welcome its blessings** (指日以迎休).

With today’s ascent to the platform and invocation of the Dao,
I pray that the assembled **Dharma-masters** (法众) perform this second offering of incense (运兹二捻上香),
and that this incense smoke,
may ascend the void directly to the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity** (上清紫微碧玉宫),
to **venerate** (供养) the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** (太一大天帝) and the **High Worthies** (合坐高真).
We submit our bodies, our **spiritual essences** (神), and our **command** (命) to the Great Dao,
and with this offering of incense, dedicate its **meritorious virtue** (功德)
to **purify and solemnize** (净严) this public hall (公宇),
to **lay out** (敷设) the ritual platform (坛场),
and to **solemnly venerate** (祇奉) the High Worthies,
**proclaiming and expounding** (宣扬) their **esoteric teachings** (秘典).
We hope to **stir the pure and luminous discernment** (清明之鉴),
to **subtly dispel** (潜消) the **excessive drought** (亢旱之灾).

May the **benevolent clouds** (慈云) arise,
and shower the **abundant rain** (大霈) of **nourishing dew** (之泽).

---

May this **auspicious harvest** (嘉谷) be fulfilled,
and let the land become one of **prosperity and abundance** (富庶之秋).

Now, we burn this incense,
and **solemnly vow to return to** (皈依) the **Way’s** (師尊) **Great Sage, the Most Perfect High Worthies** (大聖眾至真之德).
After attaining the **Dao** (得道之後),
we **ascend to the formless realm** (升入無形),
and **harmonize with the Dao’s** (和與道) **Most Perfect Truth** (合真).

We have heard that the **Five Phases** (五行) **interact in cycles** (相沙),
and thus **flood and drought** (兹水旱) become **calamities** (之災).
All things flow in their natural course (萬物流行),
and thus **flourishing and decay** (乃榮枯) have their **fixed measures** (之有數).
Now, the **sweet rains** (甘雨) are delayed,
and the **threat of famine** (將害豐年) looms.

Unless we **exhaustively express** (殚) **pure sincerity** (蠲洁之誠),
how could we **hope to receive** (曷冀) the **blessings of nourishment** (沾濡之澤)?

With this **ascension to the ritual platform** (升坛行道),
we **solemnly beseech the assembly of High Worthies** (請法眾等) to **carry this third offering of incense** (運兹三捻上香).
May this incense smoke **soar directly upward** (腾空径上),
reaching the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity** (上清紫微碧玉宫),
to **venerate** (供养) the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** (太一大天帝)
and the **gathered High Worthies** (阖坐高真).

We submit our bodies, our **spiritual essences** (神), and our **command** (命) to the Great Dao,
and with this offering of incense’s **meritorious virtue** (功德),
we **devoutly dedicate** (奉為) to **reverently honor the sacred spirits** (某夤奉真靈),
and **pray for benevolent response** (請求惠應).

May the **stars’ light return to illuminate** (星光回照),
and the **Dao’s** (道) **Most Perfect Benevolence** (癊興慈) **arise anew**.
We **solemnly command** (勑彼) the **hundred deities** (百神),
to **aid in the sacred duty of bestowing life** (助舉施生之職).
Let it rain **prodigiously for three days** (沛然三日),
and may we **witness the fulfillment of our prayers** (願觀沾足之期).

Now, we burn this incense,
and **solemnly vow to return to** (皈依) the **Way’s** (師尊) **Great Sage, the Most Perfect High Worthies** (大聖眾至真之德).
After attaining the **Dao** (得道之後),
we **ascend to the formless realm** (升入無形).
**Repentance** (唱方), **confession** (忏方).

We have heard that the **Most Perfect High Worthies, Great Sage** (至真大聖),
**need benevolent blessings** (需惠澤) to **save people** (以濟人).
The **Most High Primordial Lord** (無極元尊),
**fans auspicious winds** (扇祥風) to **nourish all things** (而育物).
Thus, in **ten cycles of transformation** (十回演化),
and **nine gradations of instruction** (九等垂科),
they **open the vast Dao-gate** (開廣大之法門),
and **pour the sweet nectar of compassion** (酒慈悲之甘露),
**showing forgiveness of sins** (示之宥罪),
and **granting the plea for mercy** (許以求哀).

Now, we **reverently construct this Dao-field** (某肅建道場),
and **devoutly bring our faith and trust** (虔赍法信).
We **return to the command of the Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity** (皈命上清紫微碧玉宫),
the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** (太一大天帝),
and the **gathered High Worthies** (阖坐高真).

We **humbly pray** (伏願) that upon hearing our voices,
they **respond in compassion** (寻声赴感, 应念垂慈).
The **officials and commoners alike** (官吏云, 士民云) **confess**:
*"Officials have accumulated offenses and guilt* (吏积愆尤).
*The people indulge in excess and licentiousness* (俗有奢淫).*
We beg for **slight leniency** (乞少寬) in **Your wrathful punishment** (於威怒).
*The people suffer from famine and hunger* (民罹饥馑),
and we **hope for final deliverance** (冀終格) in **abundant harvest** (於豐登).*

May the **merits of fasting** (斋功) **pervade the boundless** (廣被於無邊),
and the **rain of the Dao’s teachings** (法雨) **nourish all beings** (溥沾於一切).
After attaining the **Dao** (得道之後),
we **ascend to the formless realm** (升入無形),
and **harmonize with the Dao’s Most Perfect Truth** (和與道合真).

**Knowing the ritual bell** (知磬舉),
we **offer three salutations** (三启),
and **three obeisances** (三礼).
We **reiterate the sacred rank** (重称法位).

We, the **devout officials of all ranks** (具位臣某等),
**sincerely unite in prayer** (谨同诚上启),
and **reverently address** (上启):
the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity** (上清紫微碧玉宫),
the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** (太一大天帝),
and the **gathered High Worthies** (阖坐高真).

We have heard that when **the heavens suffer drought** (上天亢旱),
we **behold the radiant return of the Milky Way** (瞻云汉之昭回).
When **the earth below is scorched and parched** (下土焦熬),
we **lament the exhaustion of the water sources** (叹水源之枯竭).
No sign of **the crane’s auspicious call** (不見鶉鳴之候),
only the **worries of wolves and tigers** (但懷狼顧之憂).
We **devoutly command the celestial adepts** (虔命羽流洁严),
and **reverently offer precious rites** (公宇珍供演揚奧典)
to **hope for special blessings** (冀沐殊休),
for **the Dao’s virtue has not yet returned** (邈天德之未回).
We **awaken in fear** (惕危衷) and **increase our dread** (而增惧).

Now, we **further solemnize the Dao-assembly** (再严法会),
and **reverently construct the ritual platform** (肃建坛场).
We **look upward to the hundred spirits** (仰百靈) for **their descending inspection** (降鑑之恩),
and **wait for the response of a single thought** (俟一念潜通之应).
Then, **above, the Heavenly Emperor’s benevolent blessings** (上明天帝大慈之澤) will be granted,
and **below, our devout prayers** (下副臣等請祷之誠) will be answered.
We **reverently report this** (谨启以闻).

**Knowing the ritual bell** (知磬舉),
we **offer twelve wishes** (十二願).
The **grand recitation begins** (都讲举),
and we **focus our spirits while burning incense** (存神烧香).

The **Incense Officials, the Messengers** (香官使者),
the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (左右龙虎君),
and the **attendant spirits of incense** (侍香诸灵官),
should **cause this Dao-field** (當令臣道場之所) to
**naturally produce golden elixir and verdant jade** (自然生金液丹碧),
**mushrooms and herbs of myriad blessings** (芝英百靈),
and **gathered High Worthies** (眾真交會) at this **incense burner** (在此香火炉前).
We **pray that the High Worthies descend with blessings** (上願高真降福),
and that **all under heaven receive Your grace** (率土蒙恩).
The **ten directions’ immortal children and jade maidens** (十方仙童玉女),
**attend and escort the incense smoke** (接侍香烟),
and **transmit and proclaim our sincere prayers** (传奏向来所启之诚)
to the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity** (上清紫微碧玉宫),
and the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven’s Presence** (太一大天帝御前).

**Knowing the ritual bell** (知磬舉),
we **recite the *Xiaoxue* (小学) Immortal Praises** (仙赞).

Riding the gale, they scatter their radiance, soaring through the boundless void,
entering and exiting the realm of darkness, feasting in the ten directions.
Five clouds float as canopies, summoning deities and harnessing the winds.
They command the myriad spirits, protecting the Celestial Elder,
harmonizing with the Dao and attaining True Unity.

The Grand Master raises the assembly, and the **Law-Drum is struck twenty-four times**.
The High Functionary ignites the furnace.

**The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Beginning Three Breaths (三炁),**
the **Most High Venerable Lord Lao,**
summon forth from within our bodies the **Three Five Officials of the Five Viscera,**
the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Left and Right Bearers of Incense,
the **Relay Dragon Cavalry Officers, the Incense-Serving Golden Boys,**
the **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,**
and the **Direct-Sun Incense Officials—**
each thirty-six in number—**to emerge.**

Those who emerge are arrayed in solemn attire,
opening the way for this land’s local deities and territorial spirits.
We, the petitioners, now establish this **Lingbao Taiyi Rain-Prayer Ritual Assembly**
at **[specific location]**, requesting the **twelve divisions of the Grand Assembly (罢散设醮一十二分位)**.
We humbly beseech the Celestial Sovereign to look upon our sincere pleas,
bestowing sweet dew to flow like mist,
fulfilling the people’s desperate hope for rain.

Our heartfelt petitions are inscribed in the **Blue Petitions (青词)**.
May the **Most High’s Ten-Directional True Worthies descend in black light,**
flowing into our bodies,
so that our supplications may swiftly reach
the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**
before the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven’s Presence.**

The High Functionary emerges, receiving the **Daoist Precepts and Official Appointments for the Spirit Officials.**
From within our bodies, we summon forth:
the **Five-Body True Officials and Functionaries,**
the **Upper Celestial and Upper Spirit Officials,**
the **Direct Messengers of the Two Offices,**
the **Orthodox Unity Functionaries,**
the **Left and Right Official Messengers,**
the **Yin-Yang Spirit Decision Officers,**
the **Red-Symbol Chariot Officers,**
the **Gang-Wind Cavalry Officers,**
the **Relay Horse High-Petition Officers,**
and the **Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers—**
each two in number—**to emerge.**

Those who emerge are clad in resplendent robes,
their headgear adorned with trailing ribbons,
their demeanor dignified and solemn,
standing before, behind, and to our left and right.
The **Left Official Messenger** holds the banner in front,
the **Right Official Messenger** bears the scepter behind,
the **Yang Spirit Decision Officer** stands to the left,
and the **Yin Spirit Petition Officer** to the right.
The **Wolf Officers and Tiger Guards,**
the **Deliberate Deceit Cavalry,**
the **Heavenly Chariot Soldiers,**
and the **Heavenly Laborers**
all receive our spoken commands,
opening the way for this land’s territorial deities
and overseeing their attendance.

The **Officials of the Jiazi Cycle,**
along with the **Celestial Generals and Officers,**
together sincerely petition:
the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**
the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven,**
the **Sovereign of Yin-Yang,**
and all **Mighty and Spirited Ones.**

We have long revered the True Wind,
early adhering to the Supreme Teachings,
daring to exhaust our sincerity,
solemnly knocking at the Celestial Gate.

Now, as the seasons have strayed from harmony,
rain has failed to fall,
bringing distress to the people—
thus we humbly pray with utmost devotion.
May our offerings be auspicious and our sins atoned,
hoping for a response in kind.

Now the **Ritual Standards are solemnly completed,**
and the **Fragrant Assembly proceeds.**
May the **Celestial Worthies deign to descend,**
and may the **Fasting Hall’s sincerity be graciously accepted.**
Thus, the **Dao’s blessings may be universally bestowed,**
and the **people of the land be widely protected.**

The **Functionary Messengers and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers**
proceed in order,
swiftly conveying our petitions upward.

We, the petitioners, in deepest awe,
prostrate ourselves repeatedly,
our pleas most urgent.
We humbly submit this petition.

The Grand Master raises the assembly, requesting the **recitation of the Law-Positions.**

We, **[petitioner’s name]**, along with the assembled officials,
sincerely petition together:
the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**
the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven,**
the **Left Celestial Dragon King within the Purple Darkness-Jade Clarity Palace,**
the **Right Celestial Dragon King within the Purple Darkness-Jade Clarity Palace,**
the **True Official of Heaven’s Harmony,**
the **Pure and Spirit-Bestowed True Person of the Lingbao River,**
the **East Peak Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**
the **Revered and Trustworthy Broad-Source King of the Jiang River’s Manifest Spirit,**
the **First Direct Messenger of the Inner Palace,**
the **Second Direct Messenger of the Inner Palace,**
the **Third Direct Messenger of the Inner Palace,**
the **Day-Direct Functionaries,**
and the **local territorial deities.**

We have heard that **Creation’s mercy is boundless,**
and that **nurturing life is its supreme purpose;**
that **when the people have no recourse,**
they turn to Heaven, ever hoping for its response.**

We look upward to the **Purple Darkness of the Northern Celestial Pole,**
ascending to the **Jade Clarity of Upper Purity.**
To seek **auspicious dew,**
we lay bare our humble hearts.

We humbly pray that the **Celestial Mercy take pity,**
spare our offense of presuming upon the Sacred,
and deign to descend upon the **Precious Throne,**
graciously perceiving our sincere devotion.
We bow at the **Celestial Steps,**
awaiting the arrival of the **Celestial Procession.**

We are unworthy to gaze upon Heaven,
our pleas most urgent.
With utmost reverence, we kneel and bow twice.

**The Celestial Response descends.**
Incense is offered, and tea is presented.

We, **[petitioner’s name]**, along with the assembled officials,
sincerely petition together:
the **Upper Purity Palace of Purple Darkness and Jade Clarity,**
the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven,**
and the **Assembled Celestial Worthies.**

We have heard that **Heaven and Earth, in their nurturing of all things,**
are equitable in their creation;
that **Yin and Yang, in their governance of the four seasons,**
do not lack in their due measure.

「Mindful of the farmers’ hardships,
yet the **Heavenly Rain** still lags in its descent.
The crops are near to withering and scorching,
when may we hope for the **granaries’** abundant stores to fill?

Driven by poverty and desperation,
bandits would soon run rampant;
homeless and adrift,
some might even lose their fathers and sons.

Yet **Yin and Yang** are ever just,
how could **Heaven and Earth** lack compassion?
If governance strays from the **Dao/Way**,
then officials bear their **guilt/virtue**.

Only through reflection and fear
do we still dare to hope for mercy.

We humbly pray that the **Great Unity Emperor of Heaven** may observe,
and the **Assembled Celestial Worthies** descend in judgment.
Dispatch the **Six Ding Officials** to reverse the **Celestial River’s** course,
and summon the **Four Seas’ Dragon Kings** to send forth the **Lawful Rain**.

Let all be universally nourished,
and may all **sentient beings** find great comfort.

We, **[petitioner’s name]**, along with the gathered officials,
bow twice in deepest reverence,
offer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.

We raise the **Music of the Jade Purity**,
and perform the **sacred rites**.

We have heard that faithful ministers bowing at wells
draw forth gushing springs from the earth,
and filial sons dwelling in huts
receive sweet dew falling in their courtyards.

If one act suffices to call forth such response,
how much more should the cries of countless people
move the **Heavenly Dao’s** ear to justice—
why does it alone remain deaf to the suffering of the masses?’

---

The **Heavenly Dao’s** hidden workings are such that its response comes swiftly as an echo.
How dare we not solemnly reverence and tremble with awe before its majesty?

We humbly pray that the **Heavenly Dao’s** virtue of yielding to the people’s desires may be broadly extended,
and its **virtue/power** of cherishing life be lavishly bestowed.
Three years of tillage, nine years of storage—
thus did the ancients live in harmony;
Five days of rain, ten days of wind—
a joyful blessing upon this age.

For all who earnestly petition,
how dare we not present their words?
We solemnly prepare the **Daoist rites** and **sacred scriptures**,
and shall dutifully proclaim them.

**Scripture proclaimed.**
As the words state, we have already extended our petition.

With hearts pure and sincerity fervent,
we risk offending the **Heavenly Dao’s** discernment.
We have heard that when the **Lawful Rain** descends,
the **Heavenly Dao’s** creation knows no fixed measure of benefit;
When wood is thirsty and fire is parched,
the abundance or scarcity of harvests follows no certain rule.

Though aligned with the **cosmic order**,
one cannot escape its influence;
Yet those who earn its favor through sincerity
may hope to move it more easily.

Moreover, food and wealth are the foundation of the people’s livelihood,
while the **Heavenly Dao’s** **virtue/power** depends on human conduct.
We fear that governance may stray from harmony,
and that the **Heavenly Dao’s** wrath may be revealed in ceaseless drought.
How dare we forget the thought of reverence and self-examination,
or abandon our earnest prayers for refuge?

We earnestly hope that our humble devotion
may slightly open the depths of its mysteries.

The **Supreme Heavenly Dao**,
through nurturing and sustaining all,
fulfills its great function.
If it turns back on these lowly people,
then widows, orphans, and the solitary
shall find their refuge.

Thus, the burdens of officials may be lightened—
this truly relies on the **Heavenly Dao’s** grace.

We, the **petitioner** and the **Daoist ritual officials**,
with hearts overflowing in devotion,
bow twice in deepest reverence,
offer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.

We raise the **Music of the Highest Purity**,
and perform the **sacred rites**.

We now solemnly and sincerely address the **Supreme Heavenly Dao’s** Purple Cloud Palace, the **Great One, Sovereign of the Great Heavenly Dao**, and the **Assembled High Worthies**.

We have heard that the **Dao** governs the **Three Realms**,
and all things are encompassed under its **covering and bearing**.
The **Heavenly Dao’s** **seven celestial officials** oversee all life with their **illuminating presence**.
Its mysteries are beyond naming,
its sincerity is beyond measure.

We deeply reflect on the parched fields of a spring without rain,
a thousand miles scorched as if aflame.
The late plowing’s gains are lost,
our hands bound in helplessness;
The **spirits of mountains and rivers** are entreated in vain,
no response to our desperate pleas.
We tremble in fear—
nowhere to turn for refuge.

Thus, we respectfully knock at the **Purple Celestial Court**,
and lay bare our deepest sincerity.

We humbly pray that the **Sacred Worthies** show no delay,
and that the **Heavenly Dao’s** transformations move swiftly.
May the **Great Heavenly Dao**’s court
beat thunderous drums to summon rain and wind,
so that the **once-great-grandson’s** harvests
may flourish with millet and sorghum,
like the thatched halls of old.

Let us sing of abundant years,
and forever dwell in joyous lands.

We, the **petitioner** and the **Daoist ritual officials**,
with hearts overflowing in devotion,
bow twice in deepest reverence,
offer incense, and present tea and wine in tribute.

We raise the **Music of the Highest Clarity**,
and perform the **sacred rites**.

We now solemnly and sincerely address the **Supreme Heavenly Dao’s** Purple Cloud Palace, the **Great One, Sovereign of the Great Heavenly Dao**, and the **Assembled High Worthies**.

We have heard that **Heaven** possesses great **virtue/power**,
its essence rooted in cherishing life.
The people’s hearts are not always fixed—
they turn to joyous lands.
If **Heaven** does not rain, then the young shoots wither;
if the harvest fails, then the people face hunger.

We reflect on the thousand miles scorched as if aflame,
and pity the **Three Agricultural Classes** who cry out in distress.
If the year does not yet end in ruin,
how dare the people abandon their hidden anxieties?

We humbly pray that the **Heavenly Dao’s** awe-inspiring light
be tempered into boundless benevolence.
Seizing the moment to relieve the drought,
let the **Lawful Rain** descend and widely bless the realm;
So that all may share in its grace,
and strike the earth in song to praise the **Heavenly Dao’s** might.

All our petitions are now solemnly proclaimed.

**Petition proclaimed.**

The Grand Assembly is convened, and the sacred rites are solemnly proclaimed.
The officials of rank, in unison, humbly and sincerely petition the **Great Unity Emperor of the Great Heaven**, the assembled **High Immortals**.

We hear that though lofty as **Mount Tai**, it yet accepts the fist-sized stone;
though vast as the **Cyan Sea**, it ultimately receives the finest stream.
If the **lotus and reeds**—humble though they be—may be offered to the gods,
then fasting, purification, and ritual bathing may also serve the **Emperor**.

With the **Divine Presence** graciously descending upon our invocation,
and the **Celestial Procession** arrayed for its return,
we observe the rites without excess—yet thrice have we humbled ourselves in supplication.
The **Divine** does not dwell in fixed offerings—we pray for grace from beginning to end.

Gazing upward at the **Pure Sky**, we bow low in reverence and farewell.

We, the **Master of the Rite** and the **Ritual Officials**, are overwhelmed with devotion—
we prostrate ourselves twice, offering the **Sacrificial Wine**.

The **Chimes are struck**, and the **Hymn of Divine Conveyance** is sung.
The **Assembly is raised**, and the **Divine Presence is invoked with incense**.

The **High Functionary** restores the **Sacrificial Furnace**.
The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense**—
let them now command that at the place where we have set up the **Ritual Assembly**,
**Golden Elixir and Jade-green Immortal Treasures** spontaneously arise,
along with **Mushrooms, Flowers, and Hundreds of Spirits**,
as the **Multitudes of the True Ones** gather before this **Incense Furnace**.

We pray that the **Exalted Celestial Vault** descend blessings,
and that all lands be graced with **Enlightenment**.
May the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Boys and Jade Maidens** attend to the **Incense Smoke**,
and swiftly convey our petition to the **Upper Clarity Purple Microcosm Jade Palace**,
before the **Great Unity Emperor of the Great Heaven**.

May the **Precious Flower Perfected Celestial Sovereign** manifest **Abundance**.
**Thus it is done; thus it is returned.**

I pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Most True Qi**,

So that my **sincere petition** may swiftly reach
The **Great Dao of Boundless Extremity**,
The **Heavenly Golden Gate’s Jade Sovereign Emperor**,
And be presented before the **Supreme True One**.

I request the **proclamation of my ritual rank**.

With my **designated rank**, I, **Subordinate** [name],
Together with the **Ritual Assembly Officials**,
Humbly present my **sincere petition** to:

The **Emperor of Vacuous Natural Primordial Beginning**,
The **Supreme Dao Sovereign of Boundless Extremity**,
The **Supreme Dao Sovereign**,
The **Emperor of Boundless Supreme Virtue**,
The **Jade Sovereign Emperor of Heavenly Extremity**,
The **Supreme Emperor of the Upper Palace’s Violet Microcosm**,
The **Great Emperor of the Middle Heaven’s Northern Extremity Violet Microcosm**,
The **Holy Ancestor High Dao**,
The **Great Emperor of the Nine Heavens Who Preserves Life and Commands Destiny**,

The **Earthly Sovereign of the Golden Tripod and the Effecting of Heaven’s Will**,
The **Supreme Saint of Primordial Heaven**,
The **True Sovereign of the Five Blessings and Ten Gods**,
The **Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors**,
The **Sacred Treasure Emperors of the Eastern Hua, Southern Extremity, Western Spirit, Northern Truth, Daoist Metropolis, Jade Capital, Seven Treasures, Wondrous Platform, and Violet Microcosm**,
The **Dao Sovereign of Bright Clarity**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures, Mysterious Middle Supreme Master**,
The **Supreme Grandee and Supreme Chancellor**,
The **Supreme Protector and Supreme Tutor**,
The **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors**,
The **Eleven Great Luminaries**,
The **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**,
The **Seven Elemental Stars of the Northern Dipper**,
The **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,
The **Nine Palaces and Ten Precincts of the True Sovereign of Primordial Unity**,
The **Four Holy Ones of the Northern Extremity**,
The **Great Emperor of the Water Palace’s Exalted Phoenix**,
The **Divine Sovereign of the Yang Valley**,
The **Dragon King of the Abyssal Depths**,
The **Ten Caverns and Five Peaks**,
The **Nine Rivers and Water Emperors**,
The **Eight Sea Dragon Kings**,
The **Three Rivers, Four Seas, Five Lakes, Eight Marshes, Valley Streams, Source Springs, Named Mountains, and Cavernous Retreats**,
The **Peaceful Abodes and Auspicious Lands**,
The **Five Directional Dragon Kings Who Command Rain**,
The **Wind Lord and Rain Master, Thunderer and Lightning Mother, Cloud and Mist Commanders**,
The **Divine Spirits of the Prefectures, Counties, and All Temples**,
The **Three Realms** in response,
All **True Spirits**.

I have heard that:
**One Qi** condenses into **Essence**,
Chaos undifferentiated, yet to be distinguished;
**Two Principles** assign their **forms**,
**Clarity and Turbidity** are thereby divided.

「Thus, the **Dao/Way** is universally rooted in the **True Spirits**,
And all things are comprehensively governed by the **Transformative Power** [*造化*].

Clouds march and rains descend,
Thunder roars and winds rush—
The heavens and earth regulate their rhythms, and the **Four Seasons** are established;
**Yin** and **Yang** harmonize, and all beings flourish accordingly.

Should one extreme be insufficient,
Then myriad calamities will swiftly arrive.

Now, for the present realm, I humbly submit:

**Spring:** When the fragrant spring arrives,
Sweet dews are yet delayed,
Fearful that the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] may command too harshly,
And cause the farmer’s duties to fall out of season.

**Summer:** When the ever-bright sun is at its height,
Dark clouds linger without descending,
Fearful that the **Thunderer** [*蕴隆*] may bring disaster,
And that the **Rain Master** [*蕃启*] may fail to act in due time.

**Autumn:** When the autumnal season begins,
Timely rains are overdue,
The fields have long been parched,
And the harvest fears a barren year.

**Winter:** When the severe winter comes,
And we pray for snow,
Auspicious snow has yet not fallen,
Fearful that **Yin** and **Yang** may lose their order,
And that plagues may arise as calamities.

Thus, I purify the **Sacred Altar** [*華坛*] with utmost reverence,
And perform **auspicious expiation** [*吉蠲*] through incense and prayer,
Hoping that the **Essence** of sincerity may be clearly received,
And that the **Grace of the Highest** [*冲贶*] may abundantly descend,
So that all may be blessed with overflowing favor,
And the realm may achieve universal abundance and harvest.

We humbly follow the **Divine Mandate** [*科简*],
And respectfully present our **fasting vows** [*斋诚*],
Wishing that you may inspect and accept them,
And that our petitions may be fully answered.
All that we invoke with **mystic intuition** [*玄感*],
We submit to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless** [*至真无极大道*] **before the Highest Sovereign**.

**Chanting the Directions** [*唱方*], **offering rites to the Directions** [*礼方*].

We have heard that:
When the **Two Principles** [*二仪*] first divided,
They inscribed clouds and sealed them in the **Great Void** [*太虚*];
When the **Three Caverns** [*三洞*] revealed their subtleties,
They bound the **net of the world** [*筌蹄*] within the **Wondrous Storehouse** [*妙蕴*].

Following the **Sacred Patterns** [*秘范*] of the **Spirit Altar**,
And gathering the **ordered rites** [*令仪*] of incense offerings,
All petitions made in sincerity,
Must surely accord with **responsive harmony** [*通感*].

Humbly reflecting,
We, your subjects, are frail in nature,
And our understanding of the **Dao/Way** is shallow and indirect.
We have long relied upon the **Master of the Tower of Observation** [*楼观之师*],
And mistakenly joined the ranks of the **Celestial Officials** [*星簪之列*].

The **pledges of our oaths** [*告盟之戒*],
May sometimes violate the **Golden Precepts** [*金科*];
Our **offered sincerity** [*荐信之诚*],
May fail to reach the **Jade Gates** [*玉阙*].

Humbly praying,
That the **Highest Virtue** [*高真*] may extend compassion,
And the **Supreme Sage** [*上圣*] may grant benevolence,
Forgiving our accumulated transgressions,
And allowing our renewed diligence to be accepted.

Though the **Dao/Way** is **soundless and odorless** [*无声无臭*],
We dare not slacken in our **devoted contemplation** [*精思*];
Though the **spirits** have **wings and authority** [*有翼有严*],
We hope to attain **responsive enlightenment** [*灵感*].

Now, the **Sun Prince** [*常旸*] is somewhat excessive,
Sweet rains and auspicious snow have long been delayed,
The common folk lament the calamity of drought,
And the **magistrates and prefects** [*郡守、令尹*] are burdened with anxious concern.
We strictly adhere to the **Sacred Scriptures** [*宝箓*],
And solemnly invoke the **Pure Field** [*清场*].

Praying that the **Ten Days** [*十日*] may align in harmony,
And that **auspicious dew** [*嘉泽*] may descend in abundance;
So that the **Three Springs** [*三春*] may be fully nourished,
And that the fields of the people may be universally moistened.

In **summer**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension** [*活套*],
So that the **Three Crops** [*三农*] may be fully nourished,
And that the **highest plants** [*亢苗*] may be universally refreshed;
In **autumn**, dark clouds bind in **active suspension**,
So that the **Nine Harvests** [*九秋*] may be fully nourished,
And that all may rejoice in a bountiful year.

Praying for snow,
That the **Six Celestial Outpourings** [*六出*] may send the **flying snowflakes** [*飞霙*],
And that **auspicious moisture** [*嘉润*] may descend in abundance;
So that the **Three Ascents** [*三登*] may harmonize in omens,
And that we may preemptively celebrate a year of prosperity.

All beings, whether **sentient** or **insentient** [*动植*],
Are entirely indebted to the **Transformative Power** [*造化*] for their creation and sustenance.

Disasters sink into the **Nine Earths** [*九地*],
Fortunes rise from the **Ten Directions** [*十方*].

We, your subjects, with **sincere hearts** [*志心*],
Bow in **reverent homage** [*稽首*],
And offer **gratitude** [*礼谢*] to the **Supreme Celestial Treasures** [*无上虚皇至真三宝*].

**Chanting the Three Invocations** [*吟三启*],
**Declaring the True Text** [*宣真文*],
With **three rites** [*三礼*] **raised**,
And **proclaiming the Law’s rank** [*称法位*].

We, your subjects of **all ranks** [*具位*], including the **Altar Officials** [*合坛官众*] and myself,
With **unified sincerity** [*同诚*],
Respectfully submit our petitions to:
The **Supreme Great Three Pure Ones** [*大罗无上三清*],
The **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [*太上昊天玉皇*],
The **Nine Grades of Highest Virtue** [*九品高真*],
The **Ten Directions of Supreme Sages** [*十方上圣*],
All **Heavens and Earths** [*诸天诸地*],
The **True Scriptures and True Masters** [*真经真师*],
The **Perfect Celestial Symbol** [*圆穹上象*],
The **Heavenly Treasury of Spirits** [*天府列真*],
The **Earthly Abodes and Mountain Shrines** [*厚地洞宫、岳渎主宰*],
The **Emperor of the Eastern Tree** [*扶桑大帝*],
The **Divine Lord of the Bright Valley** [*旸谷神君*],
The **Dragon King of the Abyssal Depths** [*洞渊龙王*],
The **Water Emperor of the Nine Rivers** [*九江水帝*],
The **Twelve River Sources** [*十二河源*],
Those who **stir clouds and bring rain**, **Thunderers and Wind Lords** [*兴云致雨、雷电风伯*],
The **spirits of all temples** [*诸庙神祇*],
The **City Deities and Community Lords** [*城隍社令*],
The **Three Realms** in response,
All **True Spirits**.

We have heard that:
The **Round Celestial** [*圆清*] dwells in **Purity** [*宅粹*],
And the **Square Earthly** [*方厚*] stores **Essence** [*储精*];
All are governed by the **spirits**,
And the **Transformative Power** holds the **total authority** [*总权衡*].

Though there may be **auspicious or inauspicious** [*吉凶*] **categories** [*有类*],
Fortunes and calamities are **never partial** [*无私*].

Thus, the **Divine Mandates** [*冲科*] preserve the **rites of petition** [*请祷之文*],
And the **True Teachings** [*真教*] elucidate the **patterns of expiation** [*襘禳之范*],
Attaining **sincerity** in worship,
And **responsive harmony** in sensation.

Now, for the present realm,
We humbly submit that **sweet rains and auspicious snow** have failed to arrive on time,
And that the **Sun Prince’s** excess is a **precious concern** [*珍*],
Not to be lightly dismissed.
With **fasting devotion** [*斋庄*] fully observed,
We look upward to the **Highest Virtue**,
And downward to the **Red Scriptures** [*丹款*].

Humbly praying,
That the **prolonged darkness** [*重阴*] may follow its proper course,
And that **abundant dews** [*霈泽*] may arrive in due season,
So that the **crops and grains** may flourish and be plentiful,
And that the **people and soldiers** may attain **prosperity and ease** [*康乐*].

We, your subjects, have long followed the **Master’s instructions** [*师训*],
And early donned the **True Talismans** [*真符*].
All incense petitions are logically beyond reproach,
Yet, when we receive the **Divine Edicts** [*词旨*],
How dare we not report them,
And solemnly present our **Altar words and vows** [*启坛词诚*] **for proclamation** [*宣奏*]?

**Proclaiming the Petition** [*宣词*].

As per the **Divine Edicts**,
With **utmost devotion** fully observed,
We now **propagate the Transformation** [*宣化*] to **follow the currents** [*承流*],
Thus **lengthening the lives** of the people and **aiding the world** [*长民辅世*].

Should any **single thing** lose its **proper place** [*有失其所*],
Then how could our **great fears** [*大惧*] find rest?
We fear that **punishments may be unjust**,
And that the people may rise in **grievance and lamentation** [*怨嗟*].

Or should the **Four Cardinal Directions** [*抚宇*] be disordered,
And **affairs** become **troubled and chaotic** [*乖方*],
With **accumulated guilt and regret** [*烦扰积悔*],
The longer this persists,
The more the **proper sequence of time** [*时序*] may be delayed.

Thus, we purify the **Sacred Field** [*灵场*] with incense,
And **reverently consult** the **Sacred Texts** [*稽参宝典*],
With **pious introspection** [*虔省躬*],
And **humble self-blame** [*引咎*],
Praying that **fortunes** may be turned and **blessings** bestowed upon the people.

We look upward to the **Highest Virtue of the Three Realms** [*三境高真*],
And the **Supreme Sages of the Nine Heavens** [*九天上圣*],
Begging forgiveness for our past actions,
And permission to **renew ourselves** [*自新*],
Adjusting and rectifying **Yin** and **Yang**,
Balancing the **celestial decrees** [*律令*]—
So that the **good fields** [*良畴*] may be nourished,
And that the **many crops** may grow in harmony,
That the **prefectures and counties** may be secure,
And that the **people and soldiers** may attain **prosperity and ease**.

We, your subjects, **reverently follow** the **fasting laws** [*斋法*],
And **diligently report** our petitions at every opportunity.
Hoping that our **sincere intentions** may be **responsively harmonized**,
And that the **auspicious blessings** [*庬休*] may swiftly arrive,
That our **shadows** may follow and **echoes** may respond,
And that our **wishes** may be fulfilled and **rites completed**.

At **dawn’s first light** [*明旦*],
With **pious sincerity** [*虔诚*] and **lawful conduct** [*依法行道*],
We continue to report our petitions.

**Issuing our Vows** [*发愿*].

**Raising the rites** [*举*],
And **concentrating our spirits** [*存神*] while burning incense.
The **Highest Functionary** [*高功*] restores the **incense brazier**.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers** [*香官使者*],
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials** [*左右龙虎君*],
And the **attendant spirits of incense** [*侍香诸灵官*],
Shall now command that,
Wherever we have previously **invoked the altar** and **performed the rites** [*启坛行科*],
There will naturally arise **golden elixir and azure jade** [*金液丹碧*],
**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** [*芝英百灵*],
And **all spirits** will gather in assembly,
At this **incense brazier** before us.

Now, we pray that the **Ten Directions’ celestial youths and jade maidens** [*十方仙童玉女*],
May **attend** the **fragrant vapors** [*兰烟*],
And **transmit** our **previously offered sincerity** [*所启之诚*],
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless** [*至真无极大道*] **and the Highest Heaven’s Golden Gates, Jade Emperor** [*昊天至尊金阙玉皇上帝御前*].

「Know the **ritual of striking the stone chime** [*磬举*] **and begin the invocation**,
**Exit the hall** and **chant the hymns** [*出堂颂*].
**Proceed to the threshold** and **guide** to the **Six-Panel Hall** [*引至六幕堂*].

The radiance of the sun and moon shines forth on all sides,
The thunderous roar of winds and peals resounds with solemn awe.
In harmony with the four seasons, the symbols of change are aligned,
And the hundred virtues descend, bestowing blessings and auspicious signs.

Only through virtue does one draw near,
And sincerity alone is the path to grace.

Now, certain officials humbly submit:
For the disorder of yin and yang, for winds and rains,
For rain and snow that fail in their proper times,
Lest they harm the fields and bring sorrow to the people,
We reflect upon our own lack of virtue and fear the calamities
That may befall those who disregard the sacred.

Thus, we dare to offer earnest prayers and devout supplications,
Hoping for favorable responses and to receive the boundless blessings of the Dao.
We request the assembly of all present to join in this initial offering of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend high into the heavens,
To honor the Ten Directions’ Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, the Celestial Sovereign.

With reverence, we dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives,
Prostrating ourselves to the earth,
That through this incense offering’s merit,
We may bless the current Emperor, the august Sovereign.

Humbly we pray:
May the celestial favor be everlasting,
And the sacred calendar flourish in prosperity.
May the foundation of His rule endure for ten thousand years,
And His noble lineage thrive through a hundred generations.
May the five winds and ten rains never fail,
Bringing perfect harmony to all.
May the four quarters and myriad lands together receive
The enlightening transformation of His grace.

Now, we offer incense again,
And humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Dao/Way Treasure,
The Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.
After attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,
And align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.

With this incense offering’s merit,
We pray for the protection and tranquility of the prefectural magistrate
And extend it to all his subordinates.

Humbly we pray:
May the wondrous Dao/Way solidify in its blessings,
And the most exalted deities aid in virtue.
May gentle winds stretch far and wide,
And the banners of the celestial realm rest in solemn order—
A sign of the utmost benevolence.
May sweet rains fall in due season,
And every hundred miles resound with praise of the harmonizing Dao,
As though the music of the *qing* [1] were heard.

May officials be united in harmony,
And the people’s afflictions all be lifted—
No disasters from yin and yang’s disorder,
And abundant harvests for the farmer’s hopeful prayers.

Now, we offer incense once more,
And humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Celestial Sage,
The Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.
After attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,
And align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.

With this incense offering’s merit,
We pray for the protection and blessings of these people,
And extend them to all within our borders.

Humbly we pray:
May the imperial radiance descend like a torch,
And the Dao’s yin [2] embrace all with its grace.
May all within the realm bow in obedience,
And the three calamities [3] be extirpated from every village.
May the rains and snows be ever timely,
And the seals of the land suffer no injury from drought or flood.
May the grains abound in harvest,
And every household rejoice with the blessings of filled granaries.

Now, we offer incense once more,
And humbly rely upon the Supreme Virtue of the Celestial Sage,
The Great Sage of All-Pervading Truth.
After attaining the Dao, may we preserve the heavens’ eternal existence,
And align ourselves with the Dao’s true essence.

We chant the directions,
We repent the directions,
We command the demons.

We raise our voices in supplication for rain.
The Dao unites with the primal *qi*,
And yin and yang nurture all beings.
The people below have committed many transgressions.
The Supreme Dao bestows the decree of punishment.
With earnest hearts and diligent morning repentance,
We sincerely regret our sins and seek forgiveness in the unseen.

May it be granted to shower rain and snow,
And to moisten all that is without feeling.

We bow three times.
We again solemnly proclaim the sacred titles.

The undersigned officials, along with the assembled congregation,
With sincere hearts, jointly petition:
The Supreme Great Three Celestial Deities of the Great Dao,
The Most High Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Celestial Sovereign,
The Nine Grades of High Perfection,
The Ten Directions’ Supreme Sages,
All Celestial Deities and Celestial Lords,
The True Scriptures and True Masters,
The Round Dome’s lofty symbols,
The arrayed constellations and stars,
The boundless earth and cavernous palaces,
The sovereigns of mountains and marshes,
The Water Realm’s deep abysses,
The summoners of clouds and bestowers of rain,
The City Deities and all mighty spirits.

We hear that the Round Dome’s mysteries are profound and silent,
And the divine transformations hidden in speechless grace.
The Great Dao is vast and unfathomable,
And its primal functions operate beyond mortal control.

The shifting of yin and yang in contraction and expansion,
The subtle movements of heaven and earth—
When pestilential *qi* invades according to season,
Then drought arises without fail.

There are no reverent rites to uphold,
Nor sincere petitions to extend.
Yet with utmost sincerity, the celestial grace descends in splendor,
And with profound devotion, the divine responds in mercy.

Now, we—your humble servants—
Humbly confess our long neglect of sweet rains,
Lest fertile fields be harmed,
Lest the year’s harvest be imperiled.
No auspicious dew has fallen,
And we, bound by duty to this land and its people,
Have vainly sought relief in prayer,
Ever trembling in fear and self-reproach.

Perhaps there are officials who fail to heed imperial decrees,
Or judges who err in meting out justice—
These accumulated transgressions
Have brought no peace.

Thus, we purify the jade altar,
Adorn it with sacred offerings,
And humbly bow in repentance,
Hoping to turn misfortune into blessing.

We pray to the lofty immortals of the jade palace,
To the supreme sages of the celestial capital,
To the true sovereigns of the ten directions,
To the mighty spirits of the three realms—
May they awaken their divine hearts,
Extend their mercy below,
Drive away the dark void of the abyss,
And command the cloud-bearers to harness the wind.

Let abundant sweet dew descend,
Let misty nourishment permeate the land.
Let heavenly rain pour forth,
Let blessed moisture drench the earth.
Across the vast thousand-li expanse,
May hidden plagues be dispelled;
Through every field of the ten thousand homes,
May all reap the hope of bountiful harvest.

Above, we honor the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless compassion,
Below, we align with our servants’ earnest supplications—
Thus, we humbly present this petition.

*(The ritual is now complete.)*
Twelve wishes are fulfilled.
The high priest restores the incense burner.
The incense officers and messengers,
The Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
And the attendant spirit officials—
At the place where we formerly ascended the altar at dawn to practice the Dao,
Gold-liquid elixir and jade-green herbs shall spontaneously arise,
With mushrooms and hundred-spirits’ blessings,
As the assembled immortals gather before this incense burner.

May the celestial boys and girls of the ten directions
Attend to the fragrant mists,
And swiftly convey our humble petitions
Directly to the Supreme Dao of the Boundless Primordial,
To the Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness,
To the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Court.

*(The ritual bell is struck, and the hymn is chanted.)*
Exit the hall, and lead to the Six-Curtain Pavilion.

**Midday Dao Practice**

The ritual platform is ascended as prescribed.
The Master of Ceremonies leads the assembly, and all pay homage to the Teacher in accordance with the Dao.

The High Functionary proclaims the *Wei Ling* incantation.
The Vermilion Spirit and Crimson Flame ignite—
Flames and winds surge in crimson radiance,
The Red Wheel turns with unyielding force,
Heaven’s light bursts in eight directions.
The威威包罗 spreads, transforming the ten thousand realms.
Molten gold cascades, dispelling all demonic traces.
Evil is vanquished, the Dao’s primal virtue shines forth.
Golden talismans summon and command—
Striding on clouds, wielding dragons.
Hymns of joy resound, petals scatter through the void.
Divine transformations unfold—
The Four Quarters prosper in harmony.
Beneath the Sovereign’s gaze, none dare disrespect,
As harmony aligns with the True Dao.

*The law-drum is struck twenty-four times.*

The High Functionary ignites the furnace.
The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originator of the Three Qi,
The Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Laozi,

Thirty-six Day-Incense Officials—
All emerge in resplendent attire,
Crowns and ribbons trailing,
Unlocking the Mystic Platform’s earthly and territorial deities.

At this midday Dao practice,
I humbly present my sincerest petition,
My deepest devotion already recorded in the heavens.
May the Most High Dao’s ten-directional True Qi,
The Sacred Treasure’s luminous radiance,
Descend into our bodies,
That my earnest plea may swiftly reach
The Most High Boundless Dao,
The Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness,
The Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Court.

*The law-drum is struck, and the rank is proclaimed.*

The Nine Palaces and Ten Precincts of the Great One,
The Four Celestial Worthies of the Northern Pole,
The Great Emperor of the Vermilion Phoenix,
The God-King of the Yang Valley,
The Dragon-King of the Cavernous Abyss,
The Ten Caverns and Five Sacred Peaks,
The Nine Rivers and Water Emperors,
The Eight Seas’ Dragon-Kings,
The Three Rivers and Four Great Waterways,
The Five Lakes and Seven Marshes,
The streams, valleys, and sources—
The Five-Directional Rain-Bringing Dragon-Kings,
The Masters of Wind, Cloud, Thunder, and Lightning,
The Sovereigns of Yin and Yang,
The territorial and boundary deities,
The city gods and community officials,
All responsive beings of the Three Realms,
Every divine spirit.

We have heard:
Though heaven’s burden may seem vast,
The common folk’s suffering is unbearable.

The Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors,
The Eleven Great Luminaries of the Celestial Worthies,
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper,
The Twenty-Eight Constellations,
The Nine Palaces and Ten Precincts of the Supreme One,
The Five-Directional Rain-Bringing Dragon-Kings,
The Masters of Wind, Cloud, Thunder, and Lightning,
The Sovereigns of Yin and Yang,
The territorial and boundary deities,
The city gods and community officials,
All responsive beings of the Three Realms,
Every divine spirit.

We have heard:
Though the Dao/Way precedes the heavens and earth,
It subtly governs the interplay of Yin and Yang.
By the virtue/power of the responsive beings, communication is certain,
For sincere words are never without effect.

Now, on this occasion of the **threefold Dao/Way** (三时行道),
We seek the fulfillment of the **habitual and transformative** (习坎) merit.
And with the **six reins guiding the wheel** (六辔驰轮),
We have already reached the **heavenly ascent** (重离) station.
Not merely to honor the sacred rites,
But to invoke the **illustrious virtue/power** (明德),
We offer the **secret scriptures** (秘箓) with utmost solemnity,
And pray for the **enduring blessings of the sacred diagram** (宝图).

At this **noon court session** (午朝),
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao/Way (行道),
We request the assembly of the **Law** (法) to take this first pinch of incense,
Wishing that this incense smoke may soar through the sky,
Ascending to the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, Heavenly Venerable** (无上道宝天尊).
We submit our bodies, our spirits, and our lives,
Prostrating our heads to the earth,
With this merit of the first pinch of incense,
We pray for the blessings upon the **current Emperor** (皇帝陛下).
May the sun and stars shine brightly,
And the tortoise and tripod (龟鼎) remain in harmony,
So that the **praise may echo eternally at Mount Song** (嵩高),
And the **auspicious longevity may match the Dipper’s Pole** (斗极).

May the **heavenly rains** (雨旸) be constant,
And all under heaven share in the **harmonious unity** (凝和).
May there be no warfare,
And all lands reach **peaceful tranquility** (康靖).

Now, this incense is burned,
As we submit to the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, Great Sage, and Venerable Assembly of the Most Authentic** (道尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao/Way,
May we forever preserve the heavens and long endure,
In harmony with the **authentic Dao/Way** (道合真).

At this **noon court session** (午朝),
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao/Way (行道),
We request the assembly of the **Law** (法) to take this second pinch of incense,
Wishing that this incense smoke may soar through the sky,
Ascending to the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, Heavenly Venerable** (无上经宝天尊).
We submit our bodies, our spirits, and our lives,
Prostrating our heads to the earth,
With this merit of the second pinch of incense,
We pray for blessings upon the **prefectures and their officials** (郡宰) and their **subordinates** (属僚).
May the **government halls** (棠砌) be orderly and the **courts** (柳庭) be simple in disputes,
So that the **virtue of benevolence** (仁风) may spread across the **thousand-li** (千里),
And the **blessings of kindness** (惠泽) may reach the **four classes of people** (四民).
May the **heavenly mandate** (奉天) be eternally steadfast,
And the **reports to the state** (报国) be ever more prosperous in fortune.

May the **Five Phases** (五行) be in harmony,
And the **six qi** (六气) be balanced,
So that the **rains and winds** (雨风) never stray from their proper measures,
And the **harvests** (禾稼) bring abundant joy.

Now, this incense is burned,
As we submit to the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure, Great Sage, and Venerable Assembly of the Most Authentic** (师尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao/Way,
May we forever preserve the heavens and long endure,
In harmony with the **authentic Dao/Way** (道合真).

We chant the **Four Directions** (方),
We repent the **Four Directions** (忏方),
We command the **demons** (魔).

The **Incantation for Rain** (祈雨颂).

The **Supreme Dao/Way** (至道) encompasses the **original qi** (元气),
And the **divine** (神) nurtures all beings within **Yin and Yang** (两仪).
The common folk have committed many transgressions,
And the **Heavenly Sovereign** (上帝) has brought down punishments.
With utmost earnestness, we perform the **morning rituals** (朝礼),
And with sincere hearts, we repent our sins in the **dark abyss** (杳冥).
May the **Heavenly Sovereign** (上帝) graciously descend rain and snow,
To nourish all beings, even the **sentientless** (无情).
Three prostrations (三礼).
We repeatedly affirm the **Law’s station** (法位).

The **officers of the altar** (合坛官众) and I, the **modest subject** (具位臣某),
Together with sincere hearts, humbly present this petition,
To the **Venerable of the Three Void Realms** (虚无三境至尊),
And to the **auspicious assembly of the Dao/Way Ritual Feast** (醮筵列圣).
We respectfully hope for the **great compassion** (洪慈),
And for the **penetrating and illuminating response** (洞回昭鉴).

We have heard:
The Dao/Way precedes the **Five Celestial Sovereigns** (五太),
And its **pervasive influence** (弥纶) knows no bounds.
The **divine** (神) exists beyond **Yin and Yang** (两仪),
And its **manifestations and measures** (运量) are limitless.

The calamities and blessings each have their inherent origins,
Yet their auspicious and inauspicious effects respond swiftly, like echoes and shadows.
Therefore, the rites of *Róng* (honoring rain) were recorded in the *Classics of Rites* by the ancients;
The texts of fasting and *jiào* (ritual expiation) were established by the Sage Emperors in the canonical statutes.
For the efficacy lies in proper response—
Not merely in empty words.

We, the humble subjects, though unworthy of the sacred halls,
And though we presume to follow the teachings of the Dao,
Now follow the sacred treasures,
And solemnly establish this hallowed ground.

Now, we, the lowly petitioners, lie prostrate in distress over the extreme drought,
As the people’s hopes wither.
With sincere words and faithful offerings,
We personally confess our transgressions and pray for mercy.

We humbly hope that the **Venerable of the Purple Extremity** (紫极高真),
The **Celestial Bureaucrats of the Pure Capital** (清都列象),
The **Caverns of the Penetrating Peaks** (洞天),
The **Sacred Precincts of the Mountains and Waters** (岳渎),
And the **Blessed Lands of Tranquility** (福地靖庐),
All the exalted deities of boundless benevolence,
And the sovereigns who govern **Yin and Yang**—
Whose reach extends to the furthest depths,
Whose responses are swift to every plea—
May command the hidden dragons of the seas to rise,
And disperse the fragrant *qi* of mountains and rivers.

May the clouds move and the rain descend,
Nurturing the three agricultural cycles with their life-giving moisture;
May the spring planting and autumn harvests flourish,
So that all grains may grow in harmony and abundance.

May the four classes of people live in peace,
And may prosperity extend a thousand *li* in every direction.
May all living beings be sheltered beneath the **Great Compassionate Cover** (覆容),
And may nothing escape the **Transformative Nurturing** (化育).
Above, we honor the **Exalted Great Compassion** (尊大慈),
Below, we fulfill our subjects’ devout prayers.

We respectfully present this petition.

**The Twelve Vows are raised.**
**The Invocation of the Spirit and the Burning of Incense begin.**
The **High Functionary** restores the altar fire.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Spirit Officials**—
Let them now command that the place where the humble subject previously knelt at the **Noon Court** (午朝) and ascended the altar to perform the Dao,
Shall naturally produce **golden elixir and emerald-green jade** (金液丹碧),
And **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** (芝英百灵).
Let the **Celestial Worthies** gather here before this incense burner.

Now, we pray that the **Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions**,
Attended by **orchid and musk** (兰喱),
May swiftly convey the humble subject’s sincere petition
Directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless and Limitless Great Reality** (至真无极大道),
To the **Three Pure Ones, the Most Sacred** (三清上圣),
And to the **Heavenly Sovereign, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Court** (昊天玉皇上帝) before the Celestial Throne.

**The gong is struck, and the hymn is chanted.**

The humble subject hears that the **Heavenly Classics and Earthly Compasses**
**Encompass all transformations without partiality;**
That **Yin** is severe and **Yang** is relaxed,
**In the orderly operation of the Five Agents.** (运五行之有序)

The divine **Way’s** mysterious power is naturally established,
Manifesting through the harmonization of extraordinary **qi**.

All things follow their proper course,
And time adheres to the grand order.

Now, the humble subject, having received the imperial decree,
Comes to assume the district’s talisman,
Seeking to govern with benevolence and moderation,
To serve loyally and diligently for the sake of the land.

When the **Yang** sun rages unchecked,
Sweet dews and auspicious snows are delayed—
Fearful of failing in governance,
Lest calamities befall us in turn.

The humble subject reflects that all teachings possess genuine **dharma**,
And earnestly practices the cultivation of self-examination and repentance,
Ever since dawn, humbly praying for blessings and expiation.

On the day of our solemn vows,
We offer sincere pledges in faith;
All who partake in the ritual abstinence
Strive to purify their hearts.

Moreover, with utmost sincerity,
How dare we neglect to report?
Thus, we present our earnest words,
Respectfully submitting them for Your consideration.

**Propagating the Words.**

According to the stated petition,
We humbly implore with utmost sincerity.

The humble subject hears that the **Way’s** doctrine of the **Hun Yuan** (混元) encompasses all beings in its transformation;
That the **Emperor of Primordial Beginnings** (太始之尊) governs and regulates all spirits.

The mysteries are unfathomable,
Yet the responses are subtle.

Still, the sincerity of our incense offerings
Ascends to the **Tian** (千) realms of the **Fu Yao** (覆焘);
And the fragrant vapors of our ritual
Dare not be neglected in Your reverence.

With abundant blessings and extraordinary merit,
We exalt Your profound wisdom.

At this evening assembly,
Ascending the altar to perform the **Way’s** rites,
We request the gathered **Way’s** masters to take the first pinch of incense,
That this incense smoke may rise to the heavens,
Offering to the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure of the Ten Directions** (十方无上道宝天尊).

The humble subjects prostrate themselves—
Body, spirit, and life—
Devoting the merit of this incense offering
To bless the present emperor, the august sovereign.

May Your grand vision shine ever brighter,
And Your sacred years endure like mountains.
May You guide the **One Qi** (一气) to settle in harmony,
And align with the Four Seasons in perfect order.

Gentle winds and abundant rains
Shall flourish in the Year of Great Plenty;
The moon and stars shall shine without fail,
In accordance with the Primordial Calendar.

The Nine Encirclements shall be pacified,
And all nations prosper in unity.

Now, as we burn this incense,
We seek refuge in the **Virtue/Power** of the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure** (众至真之德).

After attaining the **Way**,
May we preserve eternal life,
And harmonize with the **Way’s** true essence.

At this evening assembly,
Ascending the altar to perform the **Way’s** rites,
We request the gathered **Way’s** masters to take the second pinch of incense,
That this incense smoke may rise to the heavens,
Offering to the **Supreme Scripture Treasure of the Ten Directions** (十方无上经宝天尊).

The humble subjects prostrate themselves—
Body, spirit, and life—
Devoting the merit of this incense offering
To bless the district magistrate,
And extend to all officials under him.

May Heaven’s blessings be upon Your prosperity,
And the spirits bring peace to the fields and valleys.
May You uphold the virtues of diligence, frugality, and integrity,
And promote the spirit of moderation and benevolence.

Rains may fall as we travel,
Washing away drought in a thousand miles;
Flowers may bloom throughout the county,
Bringing joy and comfort to all people.

Now, as we burn this incense,
We seek refuge in the **Virtue/Power** of the **Supreme Scripture Treasure** (众至真之德).

After attaining the **Way**,
May we eternally preserve life,
And harmonize with the **Way’s** true essence.

At this evening assembly,
Ascending the altar to perform the **Way’s** rites,
We request the gathered **Way’s** masters to take the third pinch of incense,
That this incense smoke may rise to the heavens,
Offering to the **Supreme Teacher Treasure of the Ten Directions** (十方无上师宝天尊).

The humble subjects prostrate themselves—
Body, spirit, and life—
Devoting the merit of this incense offering
To bless the common people,
And extend to all within the district.

May the realm and its people be tranquil and at peace,
And the wells and neighborhoods secure and harmonious.
May pestilence vanish from the clustered roofs,
And bandits be barred from the hundred gates.

Silkworms may yield twice their harvest,
And the imperial taxes be fulfilled without loss;
The five grains may always flourish,
And the granaries overflow with joy.

Now, as we burn this incense,
We seek refuge in the **Virtue/Power** of the **Supreme Teacher Treasure** (众至真之德).

After attaining the **Way**,
May we eternally preserve life,
And harmonize with the **Way’s** true essence.

**Invoke the Four Directions, Confess the Four Directions, Command the Demons.**
**Prayer for Rain.**

The **Way** contains the **Yuan Qi** (元气),
And **Yin** and **Yang** nurture all beings.

The common people commit many transgressions,
And the **Supreme Heavenly Deity** (上帝) imposes punishments.

With utmost sincerity and morning repentance,
We humbly seek forgiveness for our hidden sins.

May You now grant rain and snow,
Nourishing all beings without exception.

**Three Prostrations.**
**Reaffirm the Daoist Titles.**

The humble subjects of the various ranks,
Together with the assembled officials,
Now humbly present a unified petition to the **Most Revered of the Three Realms, the Supreme Deities of the Ten Directions** (虚无三境至尊、十方醮筵列圣).

The humble subject hears that all beings arise from the **Miao Dao** (妙道),
And that all divine governance is regulated by the **Supreme Spirit** (上灵).

Through the ritual of purification and expiation,
The deepest mysteries are communicated.

Now, as the **Yang** sun grows fierce,
Sweet rains and auspicious snows are long delayed—
We fear the calamity of drought,
And the disappointment of failed harvests.

With utmost reverence and devotion,
Our prayers have yet to reach the **High and Illuminated** (高明);
In dread and humility,
We dare not cease in our supplications.

Rather than face repeated offenses,
We seek to offer sincere, unyielding devotion,
Hoping Your boundless mercy may return,
And Your compassionate heart recognize our earnestness.

May You grant rains as the moon wanes,
Nourishing the three agricultural cycles;
May the clouds not linger until evening,
Spreading dews throughout the entire district.

The year’s labors shall bear fruit,
And the land’s blessings be boundless.
All within the realm shall be blessed,
And all living beings share in Your sacred protection.

Above, we honor the **Supreme Dao/Way Treasure’s** benevolent grace,
And below, we fulfill our subjects’ prayers with sincerity.
We respectfully submit this petition.

**Raise the Twelve Vows.**
**Raise the Incense and Burn with Devotion.**

**High Functionary Restores the Altar.**

The **Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals, and the Attendant Spirits of Incense** (香官使者、左右龙虎君、侍香诸灵官),
Shall now command the humble subject to the place of this evening’s assembly,
Where incense and altar rites are performed—
That golden nectar and emerald dew,
Mushrooms and herbs of all kinds,
And myriad spirits of the **Way**,
May naturally gather and convene before this incense burner.

May the **Daoist Immortals and Celestial Maidens of the Ten Directions** (十方仙童玉女)
Receive the fragrant vapors,
And swiftly transmit the humble subject’s sincere petition
Directly to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Ultimate Mystery, the Three Pure Ones, and the Jade Emperor of Heaven** (至真无极大道、三清上圣、昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Know the Strike of the Chime Stone, Exit the Hall to Chant.**

**Ritual of the *Lingbao* Petition for Rain and Snow**
*Compiled and Edited by Master Guangting Du*
*Three-Day Sitting Repentance Rite*
*With Daily Repentance Rites Appended*

The humble disciples, with sincere devotion, take refuge in the **East Azure, West Subtle, South Vermilion, North Dark**—the **Four Cardinal Directions and the Six Extremes, the Ten Directions of the Ultimate Mystery**—before the **Supreme *Lingbao* Celestial Venerable**, the **Great Emperor of the Mulberry Tree**, the **Divine Lord of the Sunlit Valley**, the **Dragon King of the Abyssal Depths**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Rivers**, the **Divine Lords of the Twelve River Sources and Four Great Waterways**, and the **Celestial Spirits of Cloud-Conjuring and Rain-Bringing**, along with all others.

Having completed the rites, we humbly repent with sincerity.

The disciples have heard that the **Great Pivot is formless**, yet universally nurtures all living beings; the **True Sovereign speaks not**, yet brings all things to perfect fruition. When the sequence of **Yin and Yang** falters, the timing of **wind and rain** may be delayed. Thus, when petitioning, one must align with **refined sincerity and response**.

Now, it is respectfully reported that in **such-and-such prefecture, county, or district**, the **sun’s heat is excessive**, and **auspicious rain has not yet fallen**; **auspicious snow has not yet descended**. In accordance with the **Three Caverns’ urgent rites**, we seek **auspicious pardon through supplication**; invoking the **Nine Pure Ones’ swift command**, we humbly offer **devout reverence**. Though our hearts are pure and our intentions sincere, the **heavenly response remains unfulfilled**. Thus, we now **convene at dawn, midday, and dusk**, exhausting our **sincere devotion**.

The disciples, with sincere hearts, take refuge in **body, spirit, and command** before the **Ten Directions of the Ultimate Mystery**, the **Supreme *Lingbao* Celestial Venerable**, the **Great Emperor of the Mulberry Tree**, the **Divine Lord of the Sunlit Valley**, the **Dragon King of the Abyssal Depths**, the **Water Emperors of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, and Nine Rivers**, the **Divine Lords of the Twelve River Sources and Four Great Waterways**, the **Celestial Spirits of Cloud-Conjuring and Rain-Bringing**, and all **Water Palace Spirits**.

We humbly pray that the **Celestial Pole may store blessings**, the **Jade Capital descend its gaze**, and that **oily clouds arise in the Six Extremes**, **abundant dew descend upon the Nine Regions**, **auspicious snow fall from the Nine Heavens**, **fertile fields be richly watered**, **vegetation receive ample moisture**, and that **all grains may yield a bountiful harvest**, **the people be freed from hunger’s distress**, and **all sentient beings** may **share in the Dao’s shelter**, attaining **eternal life** and **harmony with the True Way**.

**Daily Morning Repentance Rite for the Perfected**

**Announce the invocation, then chant the hall’s praise.**
**Sing the rites to the Ten Directions.**

Having completed the rites, each kneels long in repentance.

The disciples, with sincere hearts, take refuge in **body, spirit, and command** before the **Ten Directions of the Ultimate Mystery**, the **Supreme *Lingbao* Celestial Venerable**.

We humbly pray that the **Mystic Origin’s teachings** may be **eternally upheld in stillness and tranquility**; that the **Celestial Pole** may **receive sincerity**, for **only the pure may ascend**. May we **first communicate with the Supreme Sage**, **purify ourselves of all faults**, and **follow the sacred canons**, granting **repentance’s acceptance**.

Now, the **Emperor’s benevolent heart** encompasses all things; his **filial virtue** aligns with Heaven. He **transforms the winds of Great Peace**, standing **unmatched in virtue**, fearing **the faults of all under Heaven**, ever **blaming himself in speech**, regarding **the four seas as his home**, and **blaming himself in governance**. Though he **dreads omissions**, he **hopes for universal pardon**.

May **thoughts, words, and intentions** all **return to the Marvelous Dao**; may **spirit, *qi*, and form** **eternally preserve life**. Down to the **lowest of beings**, all may **attain great blessings**.

The disciples **bow in gratitude** to the **Supreme Triple Jewel of Perfection**.

---

Now, the undersigned, having received the imperial mandate and served as a regional governor, strives to govern with frugality and love for the people, offering loyal devotion to the state. Yet, with calamities of drought and floods afflicting the land, and blessings of rain and moisture not yet bestowed, we have earnestly prayed to the lofty heavens, hoping to attain divine response. May the sacred texts be unveiled, and the subtle truths recited; may the ritual offerings be presented with fragrant devotion.

We humbly welcome the celestial procession, reverently contemplating the layered spirits. May the **Tiger-Standard and Dragon-Flag** briefly emerge from the primordial chaos, and the **cloud-chariot and crane-drawn carriage** momentarily descend to the sacred precincts. May the divine favor be manifest in its trustworthiness, and this humble ritual acknowledged—so that we may be blessed with auspicious fortune and the people universally protected.

We, the undersigned, with utmost reverence, implore the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Realms**, the **Assembled Saints of the Three Worlds**, all hoping for boundless compassion and the illumination of divine insight.

We have heard that the **Great Ultimate encompasses the Three**, dividing the **Two Principles** in the realm of indistinctness; that the **light and pure obtain the One**, manifesting the **illuminated patterns**. Grasping the **Celestial Globe**, it governs the **Five Phases**; stirring the **winds and thunder**, it harmonizes the **Four Seasons**. It shapes all things and nurtures life—though the **True Method** bestows upon creation, yet the **common truth** knows the afflictions of **Yin and Yang**.

Now, the undersigned, having long delayed the **Great Nourishment**, risk harming the flourishing life. With solemn vigilance and laboring concern, we have followed the ancient rituals of incense and prayer, sincerely seeking divine protection. May the **clouds of rain** descend abundantly, and the **snow-clouds** melt universally. With strict rites fulfilled and fragrant offerings presented, we pray for celestial favor to answer, ensuring prosperity for the people.

We, the undersigned, having received the sacred teachings and participated in the ritual, now proclaim the **sincere words of the invocation**.

As the words are proclaimed, they are deeply sincere. We look upward to the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Realms**, the **Nine Pure Ones**, the **Illustrious Celestial Worthies of the Purple Extremity**, and the **Unrestrained Immortals of the Red Terrace**, whose radiant light descends and whose divine grace is imbibed.

May the **celestial movements align**, the **heavenly torches burn evenly**, and **Yin and Yang harmonize** while the winds and rains follow their course. May auspicious blessings arrive and malevolent influences cease. May the **thousand-li territories** forever enjoy peaceful years, and the **ten-thousand households** dwell in secure harmony. May all **creatures and plants** flourish in their growth.

We, the undersigned, with utmost sincerity, bow twice and present incense, offering wine for the **secondary tribute**. Music is played.

We now, with solemn sincerity, address the **True Saints of the Five Sacred Peaks**, the **Divine Spirits of the Four Great Waterways**, the **Spirits of Auspicious Lands**, the **Masters of Named Mountains**, who summon clouds and bring rain, and all **mighty divine beings**.

We humbly acknowledge that your **vast and profound virtues** are revered across the land, whether dwelling in **cavernous palaces** or ascending as **celestial constellations**. You regulate the **winds and clouds**, distribute the **rain and dew**, and silently assist the **enlightened ruler’s governance**, aiding in the **sovereign’s administration**. All living beings universally receive your blessings.

Now, the undersigned, as the responsible governor, faces the misfortune of delayed rains and prolonged drought. With earnest prayers, we seek divine response. The ritual platform is constructed, and the solemn rites completed; the fragrant offerings are presented with strict propriety. May the **masters of Yin and Yang**, the **gentle spirits of the peaks and waterways**, the **celestial officials of the Cavernous Heavens and Purple Bureaus**, and the **saints of auspicious lands and named mountains**—all in their **true and gracious forms**—descend to aid the people.

May your protection ensure peace and security, may the **fields and villages** always thrive with moisture, and the **granaries** forever overflow with abundance. Even the slightest of **plants and creatures** shall benefit from your blessings.

We, the undersigned, with deepest reverence, offer wine for the **final tribute**. Music is played.

We now, with solemn sincerity, address the **Great Emperor of the Eastern Tree (Exalted Sun)**, the **Divine Sovereign of the Bright Valley**, the **Dragon King of the Abyssal Cavern**, the **Water Emperor of the Nine Rivers**, the **Source Kings of the Four Great Waterways**, the **Rulers of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Twelve River Sources, Streams, Valleys, and the Underworld Sovereigns**—who summon clouds and bring rain, and the **mighty spirits of the Water Realm**.

Your **encompassing heavens and girdling earth** ever shine with the virtue of nourishing below. Your **profound and boundless depths** are unfathomable, your **vast and limitless expanse** endless. Though you dwell in **immortal retreat**, your **benevolent influence** is ever clear. You govern the **rising and falling of all things**, uniting **blessings and calamities** under Heaven’s will. Your responses are swift, your insights penetrate all obscurities.

Now, the undersigned, with the **heavens’ blessings delayed**, feels urgent alarm. Our **sincere supplications** seek divine resonance. With **pure fasting and offerings** presented in solemn devotion, and the **ritual rites conducted with strict reverence**, may the **Four Seas’ Sacred Ones**, the **Spirits of the Hundred Valleys**, all **scaled and sheltered beings**, and the **deep mysteries of the Dragon Palaces**—temporarily leaving the **Pearl Gates**—descend to the **True Hall**.

May you partake in these humble offerings, behold our sincere prayers, and **support the vault of heaven**, universally blessing the people. May the **seasons align**, the **Five Phases harmonize**, and the **clouds bring rain**, nourishing all things without limit. May the **farmer’s toil be rewarded**, and the **lands enjoy abundant relief**.

We, the undersigned, with repeated and earnest supplication, in **awe and fear**, kneel twice and present incense. **Sacrificial libations** are poured. **Sacred hymns** are chanted, and the **ritual petitions** proclaimed.

We now, with solemn sincerity, address the **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Pure Ones**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Nine-Ranked High Worthies**, the **Ten-Directional Supreme Saints**, all **Heavenly Deities and Emperors**, the **True Scriptures and True Masters**, the **Circumambient Celestial Hosts**, the **Sea and Mountain Dragon Gods**, the **Responsive Beings of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**.

Now, the **ritual rites are complete**, the **fasting sincerity has reached its peak**, the **celestial music has ceased**, and the **immortal teachings have concluded**. The **mundane world hums with activity**, yet the **celestial chariot lingers**; the **cloudy heavens are distant**, and the **immortal abode is about to return**. May **a hundred blessings** be extended to the **abundant year**, and **three harvests** secured in the **annual cycle**.

The humble servant, along with the **officiating priests** and all others, is deeply moved by longing and the urgency of seeking grace, and thus offers this **supreme petition** with utmost reverence and trepidation. Bowing and kowtowing twice, we humbly address the **Celestial Chariot**.

We **perform the ritual** (举) to chant the **Hymn of the Departing Spirit** (送神颂).
We **perform the ritual** (举) to maintain the **Spirit’s Presence** (存神) and burn incense.

The **High Master** re-ignites the **altar furnace**. The **incense officials and messengers**, the **Dragon-Tiger Generals** of left and right, and all the **attendant Spirit Officials**, should now command that the humble servant’s previous **sacrificial site** spontaneously produce **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** (金液丹碧), **herbal essences and myriad sacred beings** (芝英百灵), whereupon the **multitude of True Ones** will gather and convene at this very **incense and fire altar**.

We pray that the **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens** may attend to the **fragrant mist**, swiftly conveying the humble servant’s **earnest supplications** as previously offered, to the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless and Limitless True Sovereign** (俓御至真无极大道), the **Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity**, and before the **Celestial Sovereign Emperor of the Jade Vault** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).

We **know the strike of the ritual bell** (知磬举), and **chant the hymn** as we exit the hall (出堂颂).
We **step outside the door** (出户) and **lead the procession** to the **Six-Curtained Hall** (六幕堂).

**Compendium of Daoist Ritual Precepts, Volume Seventeen** concludes.
**Compendium of Daoist Ritual Precepts, Volume Eighteen**—compiled and revised by **Master Guangting Du** of the **Broad and Complete School** (广成先生杜光庭删定)—

**Evening Ritual of the Dao/Way** (夕景行道).

The ritual ascends the altar as prescribed.
The **ritual bell is struck**, and each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Daoist precepts.

The **High Functionary** proclaims the **Sacred Lingbao Incantations**.
The **Five Stars** shine forth, illuminating the **Five Directions**.
The **Water Star** repels calamity, and the **Wood Virtue** brings prosperity.
The **Uranus** dissipates misfortune, and the **Jupiter** wards off war.
The **Mars** steadies, and the **Four Celestial Guardians** bring blessings to the family and state.
Their names are inscribed upon **Jade Tablets**, and their records kept in the **Imperial Archives**.
They ride the **gales**, scattering their radiance, soaring through the **Supreme Void**.
They move unseen yet traverse the **Ten Directions**.
The **Five Clouds** float as canopies, summoning deities and harnessing the winds.
They command the **Ten Thousand Spirits**, standing guard in the **Celestial Patrols**, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way** and attaining **True Unity**.

The **Sacred Daoist Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

The **High Functionary** ignites the **Sacrificial Furnace**.
The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originating Qi**, the **Highest Dao/Way Lord**, the **Highest Venerable Lord Lao**, summon forth from within our bodies the **Three Five Officials of Merit**, the **Left and Right Attendants**, the **Incense-Bearing Officials**, the **Dragon-Courier Messengers**, the **Golden Boy Attendants**, the **Flower-Scattering Jade Girls**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, and the **Direct Day Incense Officials**—each numbering **thirty-six**—to emerge.

Those who emerge are clad in **solemn ceremonial attire**, their **headdresses and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons**, opening the **Mysterious Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits**, and the **Regional Deities**.

Now, as I establish this altar and practice the Dao/Way, I sincerely offer my **devoted intentions**.
My **earnest supplications** have already been recorded and heard.
I pray that the **Supreme Dao/Way’s Ten Directions’ True Qi** and the **Sacred Lingbao Auspicious Light** descend, flowing into our bodies, so that my **sincere petitions** may swiftly reach the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless and Limitless True Sovereign**, the **Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity**, and before the **Celestial Sovereign Emperor of the Jade Vault**.

I request the **proclamation of the ritual rank**.

**I, [Name], of such-and-such rank**, together with the **assembled officials of the altar**, sincerely and unitedly address:

The **Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Natural Emptiness**, the **Supreme Dao/Way Lord of the Boundless**, the **Highest Venerable Lord Lao**, the **Mingyuan Emperor of Supreme Virtue**, the **Highest Sovereign Who Opens Heaven, Holds the Symbols, Governs the Calendar, and Embraces the True Body of the Dao**—the **Celestial Sovereign Emperor of the Jade Vault**—
The **Celestial Emperor of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure**, the **Great Emperor of the Northern Heaven’s Pole**, the **Holy Ancestor of Highest Dao**, the **Heavenly Venerable Emperor Who Preserves Life and Governs Destiny in the Nine Heavens**, the **Earthly Sovereign Who Emulates Heaven’s Laws and Possesses Great Virtue**—the **Great Earthly Sovereign**—
The **Primordial Heavenly Holy Empress**, the **True Lord of the Five Blessings and Ten Deities**, the **Thirty-Three Heavenly Emperors**, the **Emperors of the Eastern Clarity, Southern Polarity, Western Spirit, Northern Truth, Daoist Metropolis, Jade Capital, Seven Treasures, and Jade Terrace**, the **Lingbao Emperor and Illuminated Dao/Way Lord**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mysterious Middle Dao**—
The **Supreme Chancellor, Supreme Prime Minister, Supreme Protector, and Supreme Tutor**—
The **Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors**, the **Eleven Great Luminaries of the Stars**, the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**, the **Nine Palaces and Ten Celestial Precincts’ True Lord of the Supreme One**, the **Four Celestial Guardians of the Northern Pole**, the **Great Emperor of the Eastern Expanse**, the **Divine Lord of the Yang Valley**, the **Dragon Kings of the Cavernous Abyss**, the **Ten Caverns and Five Sacred Peaks**, the **Nine Rivers’ Water Emperors**, the **Eight Sea Dragon Kings**, the **Three Rivers, Four Seas, Five Lakes, Seven Marshes, Streams, Valleys, and Sources**, the **Named Mountains and Cavernous Palaces**, the **Peaceful Lodges and Auspicious Terrains**, the **Five Directional Rain-Dispensing Dragon Kings**, the **Wind Lord and Rain Master, Thunderer and Lightning Mother, and the Cloud-and-Mist Officers**—
The **Prefectures, Counties, and Local Temple Deities**—
The **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits**, and **all True Essences**.

I have heard that **serene stillness and subtlety** are called **Dao/Way**;
That **yin and yang’s expansion and contraction** originate from **Heaven**.

Only Heaven can thus bless the people below,
Only the Dao/Way can thus nourish all things.

When the seasons are out of order and the land suffers drought,
And the people are in distress, withered and parched,
We purify the grand halls and hang the sacred banners.
We invoke the true formulas of the Three Caverns,
And summon the true essences of the Nine Purity.
We await the true blessings of the Mysterious,
Hoping to harmonize with the responsive **spirits/qi**,
To thank the Clouds for their luminous **virtue/power** and beseech the **Essence of the Dao**,
Swiftly to harmonize with the responsive **spirits/qi**.

Now, having completed our supplications,
We present this tablet in reverence and declare our merits.
We, the disciples, submit our bodies, our **spirits/qi**, and our lives
To the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless Extreme**,
And to the **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits**.

May you graciously look down upon us,
And ascend to the presence of the **Boundless Extreme Dao/Way**.
We chant,
And pay homage to the Ten Directions.

We have heard that the **high and luminous** respond,
Though it be said without sound;
That the **vast and encompassing** bestow private blessings,
Which are clearly manifest and not in vain.

Indeed, the **Dao/Way’s** profound and subtle teachings
Are embodied in the **exorcism and purification** rites of the **Three Caverns**.
Let the blessings first be granted,
For the **Essence of the Dao** is pure and reaches its peak.
May calamities be dispelled,
And yin and yang restored to harmony.

In years when flames scorched the earth,
Or times when famine struck the people,
If we sincerely pray with devotion,
We must receive the **Essence of the Dao’s** blessings.

Now, for this region,
As the **qi** is disordered and the seasons are amiss,
The **Rain-Dispensing Dragon Kings** fail to act.
We humbly revere the **Mysterious Essence**,
And sincerely offer our prayers to the **Highest Dao/Way**,
Hoping that the **Supreme Sage**** will take pity on us,
And shower abundant grace to nourish all equally.

We pray to the **Thunder and Cloud Spirits**:
May auspicious colors rise in the sky,
And all fields be thoroughly moistened.

We thank the **Rain Cloud Spirits**:
May the **Supreme Sage**’s grace take pity on us,
And shower abundant blessings to nourish all equally.

We thank the **Thunder Cloud Spirits**:
May the **Supreme Sage**’s grace descend,
And bring **auspicious rain** to thoroughly moisten.

Let the blessings touch all within this realm,
And the **virtue/power** of the Dao extend to all beings.

We disciples, though unworthy,
Have partaken in the **Dao/Way’s** fragrant offerings
And fulfilled the **Dao/Way’s** grand rituals.
Yet we still fear that our words may be misguided,
Or that our recitations may falter and be forgotten,
Accumulating these sins beyond measure,
And inviting the dreaded retribution from the **Netherworld**.

Daring to offer our own bodies as atonement,
We beg for mercy and forgiveness,
To pardon our past transgressions,
And to attain the great blessings of the Dao.

May our petitions be measured and harmonious,
With yin and yang expanding and contracting in due time,
Answering the sincere devotion of the prefectures and counties,
And bringing joyful livelihood to the black-haired masses.
May misfortune sink to the Nine **Netherworlds**,
And blessings reach the Ten Directions.

We kneel and pay homage in thanks to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** Three Treasures.

*Compiled and Revised by Master Guangting Du, with the Filial Offering Chapter of the Wenchang Star*

**Ritual Procedure for Ascending the Platform and Conducting the Dao/Way:**

When the ritual is properly elevated, the Grand Master presides, and all pay homage to the Teacher in accordance with the Dao/Way’s precepts.

The High Functionary proclaims the Sacred Protective Incantations.
Five luminaries shine resplendent in their cardinal quarters—
Mercury repels calamity, Wood’s virtue brings prosperity,
Mars dissipates misfortune, Jupiter wards off war,
The Constellation Star steadies the four directions, benefiting family and state.
Our names are inscribed upon jade tablets, our words recorded in the Celestial Archives.
Riding the gale, we scatter our radiance, soaring through the boundless void,
Entering and exiting the Netherworld, feasting in the Ten Directions.
Five clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and harnessing winds,
Commanding ten thousand spirits, guarding the Celestial Sage,
In perfect harmony with the Dao/Way’s True Essence.

The Law-Drum is struck twenty-four times.
The High Functionary ignites the furnace.

**Invocation of the Three Treasures of the Supreme Dao/Way:**
The Most High Three Celestial Primordials of the Three *Qi* of the Supreme Void-Natural Primordial Origin,
The Most High Dao/Way Lord,
The Most High Laozi,
are summoned to extract from our bodies the Thirty-Five Officials of the Three Five,
Left and Right Attendants, Incense-Bearers, Dragon-Courier Scribes,
Incense-Serving Golden Boys, Flower-Dispersing Jade Girls,
The Five Imperial Direct Symbols, the Direct-Day Incense Officials—
thirty-six each—
who emerge in resplendent attire, adorned with flowing sashes and trailing ribbons,
opening the Dao/Way’s Pure Platform and the territorial spirits of the domain.

Tonight, in solemn stillness, we ascend the platform to conduct the Dao/Way,
and humbly present our sincerest intentions—
our deepest aspirations already recorded and heard.
We pray that the Most High Ten-Directional True Dao/Way’s *Qi* and Sacred Treasure-Light descend,
flowing into our bodies,
so that our petitions may swiftly reach the Supreme, Boundless Dao/Way of the Most High,
the Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness,
the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign.

**Invocation of Titles and Ranks:**
We, the lowly officials of the rank [blank] and those assembled at the platform,
sincerely unite in supplication to:
The Most High Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Void-Natural Spontaneity,
then to the Nine Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens,
the Thirty-Six Great Heavenly Emperors,
the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,
all Heavenly Emperors,
the Star Lords of the Purple Enclosure and the Celestial Wall,
the Five Emperors,
the Three Primordial True Ones,
the Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mystic Middle,
the Eleven Great Luminaries,
the Star Lords of the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole,
the Twenty-Eight Constellations,
the Eastern Star of Literature and Art,
the Seven Stars of Virtuous Worthies,
the Twelve Palace Spirit Lords,
the Wenchang Star Lord,
the Three Platform Star Lords,
the Star Lord of Advancing Merit,
the Star Lord of the Minor Multitude,
the Round Celestial Star Host True Lord,
the Supreme Clarity’s Wenchang True Person of the Southern Vermilion,
the Nine *Qi* Wenchang Palace Celestial Officials of the Most High,
the Star-Fight True Lord of Life-Giving,
the Nine-Heaven Elder of Qingcheng Mountain,
the Nine-Heaven Life-Directing True Lord of the Hidden Peaks,
the Nine-Heaven Investigating Envoys of Lushan,
the Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks,
the Four Great Waters’ Source Kings,
the Officials of Filial Piety and Merit,
the True Lords of Examining and Recording,
the King of Martial Valor, Loyal Aid, and Broad Relief,
the Officials of Filial Piety, Merit, and Examination Records,
the Moral Resonance of the Dao/Way,
and all True Spirits.

We now burn incense, offering these merits
for the ancestral temples of our lineage,
the emperors and kings,
the territorial and ancestral spirits,
the masters of scriptures and transmigration,
the recluse scholars dwelling in mountains and forests,
our fellow students in the Dao/Way,
the ritual officials of this assembly,
our myriad ancestors, parents, teachers, and kin,
all people of the world, winged and crawling beings,
and all sentient life—
now burning incense, we repent and devote body, spirit, and fate
to the Most High Ten-Directional Sacred Treasure of Natural True Boundless Dao/Way.

We humbly beseech pardon for all past and present transgressions,
for the karmic debts of life and death,
for repeated offenses now spared,
freeing us from the Three Evils, Five Paths, Ten Sufferings, Eight Hardships, and Nine Calamities.
May our minds grow luminous, our actions forever aligned with the Dao/Way.
Our petitions, when answered, shall ascend before the Most High True Boundless Dao/Way.

**Recitation of the Square and Repentance Square:**
We, the ritual officials and assembly, with sincere hearts,
devote body, spirit, and fate to the Ten-Directional Boundless Dao/Way,
the Most High Sacred Treasure Heavenly Venerable.
Through this established platform and incense-burning repentance,
we hear that the Dao/Way follows nature—
innately free of wisdom or folly;
yet through attachment to things, distinctions of sage and common arise.
If one dares to amend faults without hesitation,
what obstacle remains to entering the Dao/Way?

We, the ritual officials of this assembly,
from our earliest lives to this day,
though endowed with lofty wisdom, have been obscured by things;
though possessing the subtle body, have been clouded by desires.
Our true nature cannot be preserved, our senses are ever disturbed—
evil accumulates, virtue wanes.
We have not sincerely served our parents,
our conduct lacks resolve,
our clear minds are muddled in response to the world,
our desires run wild, our emotions unchecked.
We have justified wrongs, concealed faults,
pursued gain at the expense of righteousness,
with stingy conduct betraying our teachers,
with narrow views slandering the True Wind.
Our intentions have been deceitful, our paths hidden.
We have concealed others’ virtues and magnified their faults,
shielded our own flaws while boasting of our strengths,
insulted the True Spirits, scorned our superiors,
humiliated others to seek victory,
flaunted our wills, wielded unjust authority,
and amassed the sins of the Three Karmas, the Six Roots.
Some are recorded in the Three Officials, Nine Departments;
others inscribed in the Five Emperors, Four Ministries.

Now, invoking the Sacred Treasure’s Ritual of the Dao/Way,
we establish our Pure Hall as a temporary abode,
facing the assembled saints to repent and atone,
and cultivate the Mystic Dao/Way with utmost devotion.

We humbly pray that the saints extend their mercy,
that boundless grace encompass all,
erasing past transgressions, severing future karmic fruit,
purifying our bodies and restoring our untainted nature,
awakening the hearts of all beings,
reverently upholding the Three Treasures’ dignity—
that our petitions may be answered,
that the ritualists’ supplications shall be granted,
that blessings extend to all living things,
and that grace permeates the Netherworld.

We kneel and pay homage three times to the Supreme True Three Treasures.

**Translation:**

We once again proclaim our sacred rank.
Your humble servants, [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity, now humbly petition:

To the **Dongzhen Natural Yuan Shi Tianzun** (Lord of Primordial Natural Perfection),
To the **Dongxuan Great Dao Yucheng Daojun** (Lord of Mysterious Dao in Jade Canopy),
To the **Dongshen Great Dao Hunyuan Laojun** (Lord of Mysterious Dao in Primordial Unity),
To the **Hao Tian Yuhuang Dadi** (Celestial Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao),
To the **Nanji Tianhuang Dadi** (Southern Pole Celestial Sovereign Emperor),
To the **Beiji Zimwei Dadi** (Northern Pole Purple Micro Emperor),
To the **Hou Tu Huangdi Qi** (Empress of the Earth),
To all **Illustrious Sovereign Dao Lords**,
To the **Seven-Bend Mountain Official of Fate**,
To the **Zhi Gong Ju Zhenjun** (Lord of True Offerings),
And to all **Worthy and Spiritually Mighty Ones** who oversee the **Guizi** (Spiritual Register) and attendants—

We have heard that the **Mysterious Dao** is nameless, yet vast as the origin of Heaven and Earth;
Though called **"Great,"** it encompasses all things in their natural course.
As its origin, it flows eternally without end;
As its fulfillment, it nurtures all things to their true nature.
The Emperor’s Dao is subtle and mysterious,
The Divine manifests the power of creation,
Bathing in the Emperor’s molding and refining,
And aided by the Illuminated Spirits’ guidance.
Thus, the Two Principles possess ungoverned virtue,
And the Illuminated Spirits establish their creative function.

We, the ritual officers, though born of the Emperor’s creation
And nurtured by the Spirits’ transformation,
Though our coarse nature is ground and refined,
And our mediocre essence is chiseled—
With reverence, we follow the Grand Architect’s will,
And invite the Spirits’ blessings to guide us.
We have long prepared the ritual hall,
And now humbly address the Highest Worthies,
Assuming the role of Daoist ritual officers,
Offering our sincere hearts’ devotion.

How could we dare not report this with utmost sincerity?
With hearts pure and true, we now solemnly declare our petition.

**Proclamation of Words:**
The words are examined with clarity, and our sincerity is evident.
As we focus our thoughts upon the Sacred Altar,
Our hidden communion reaches the True Realm.
The incense’s fragrance ascends to the distant heart,
And the celestial processions draw near in misty splendor.
The jewel-throned seats are arrayed in purity,
And sacred lotuses bloom in the numinous domain.

May the **Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness**,
The **Ten Directions of Highest Worthiness**,
The **Great Master of Mysterious Law**,
And the **Illuminated Treasure of Perfect Truth**
Look down with compassion,
And graciously respond with manifest signs.
Command the **Inspectors of the Divine Office**,
The **Guardian Spirits of Scripture**,
The **Local True Officials**,
And the **City Deities and Community Lords**
To unite in harmony and virtue,
To guard and purify the ritual grounds,
To cleanse both within and without,
And to dispel all malevolent forces.

Thus may we, your servants, attain stillness of **qi** and concentration of spirit,
So that our thoughts, once aroused, may swiftly ascend,
Our petitions reach the heights,
And our ritual merits be perfectly fulfilled.

With deepest awe and fear, we kneel and bow twice,
Humbly submitting this petition.

**Raising the Twelve Vows.**
**Raising the Offering of Spirit and Incense.**
**The High Functionary relights the incense burner.**

O **Incense Officials, Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and Attendant Spirit Officials of Incense**—
Let it be decreed that at the places where we have previously practiced in quiet nights,
Golden elixirs and emerald jade shall spontaneously arise,
With mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits,
As the assembled Worthies gather before this incense burner.

May the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens**
Attend the fragrant banquet,
And swiftly convey our earlier sincere petitions
To the **Supreme Dao of Boundless Extremes, the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, and the Celestial Jade Emperor’s Presence.**

**Know the gong’s strike; exit to chant the Praise.**
**Exit the door, leading to the Six-Curtained Hall.**

**Know the gong’s strike; exit to chant the Praise.**
**Exit the door, leading to the Six-Curtained Hall.**

The **Grand Master** proclaims the **Sacred Incantations of the Spirit Officials**.
**Qingyang** shines with empty brilliance, illuminating the sun and returning the spirits.
The **Divine Tiger** repels malevolence, while the **Flying Celestial** tolls the bells.
The **Wicked are crushed, and the evil are exterminated**; all demons are bound in form.
The **Nine Mysteries** return the Dao, and the **Eight Wonders** subdue the vital essence.
The **Thousand Worthies** inspect the records, and the **Three Elements** dispel the turbid.

The **Left and Right** exhort the **Central Yellow** and command the **Six Ding**.
The **Seven Rotations and Eight Harmonies** revolve through the **Celestial Scriptures**.
The **Holy Transformations** stand majestic; the **Great Dao** rises in action.
The **Auspicious Clouds** flow and spread, uniting with **Huangting** in harmony with the **True Dao**.

The **Grand Master** strikes the **Law Drum** twenty-four times.
The **High Functionary** relights the incense burner.

The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin of the Three Essences**—
**Taishang Daojun**, **Taishang Laojun**—
Summon forth from our bodies the **Three Five Spirit Officials**,
The **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Incense Bearers**,
The **Dragon Couriers and Cavalry Officials**, the **Golden Youth Attendants of Incense**,
The **Jade Maidens of Spoken Petitions and Scattered Flowers**,
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, the **Direct Sun Incense Officials**,
Each **thirty-six** in number, to emerge.

Those who emerge must wear **solemn and resplendent attire**,
With **crowns and sashes trailing their ribbons**,
And open the **Mysterious Daoist Gate for the Land and Domain Spirits**.

Now, in this **Morning of Clarity**,
As we ascend the platform to practice the Dao,
We humbly present our **entreaties from the heart**,
Our **sincere and earnest devotions**,
Already recorded and heard by the **True Dao of the Ten Directions**,
And pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Essence of the Three Pure Ones**,
The **Sacred Treasure of Auspicious Light**,
May descend and flow into our bodies,
So that our **earnest petitions** may swiftly reach
The **Supreme Dao of Boundless Extremes, the Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness, and the Celestial Jade Emperor’s Presence**.

We request the **invocation of the Law Positions**.

With the **Grand Master and all assembled officials**,
We humbly present our **sincere entreaties**,
To the **Supreme Heavenly Worthy of Natural Emptiness and Primordial Origin**,
The **Sacred Treasure of Auspicious Dawn**,
The **Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of Supreme Holiness**,
The **Great Emperor of the Southern Pole**,
The **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole**,
The **Earthly Sovereign of the Imperial Soil**,
The **Holy Mother of the Primordial Worthy**,
The **Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors**,
The **Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors**,
All **Heavenly Emperors**,
The **Five Emperors**,
The **Three Elements of Supreme Worthies**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of the Primordial Middle Sacred Law Masters**,
The **Eleven Great Illustrious Stars**,
The **Northern Dipper and Southern Celestial Stars**,
The **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,
The **Eastern Star of Literary Brilliance**,
The **Seven Stars of Virtuous Excellence**,
The **Twelve Palace Spirit Worthies**,
The **Literary Success Star**,
The **Three Platform Stars**,
The **Star of Advancing Virtue**,
The **Star of Minor Celestial Worthies**,
The **Star of the Rounded Vault**,
The **Supreme Pure Primordial Southern Star of Literary Brilliance**,
The **Supreme Nine Qi Literary Brilliance Palace**,
The **Star of the Nine Heavens and the Dipper**,
The **Nine-Heaven Elder of Qingcheng Mountain**,
The **Nine-Heaven Life Officer of Qianshan Mountain**,
The **Nine-Heaven Messenger of Lushan Mountain**,
The **Five Sacred Imperial Peaks**,
The **Four Celestial Rivers and Their Kings**,
The **Officers of Auspicious Offerings**,
The **Worthy of Examining and Selecting Officials**,
The **King of Martial Brilliance and Auspicious Aid**,
The **Officials of Auspicious Offerings and Record-Keeping**,
The **Divine Response of Virtue and Dao**,
And **all true spirits**.

We have heard that **you shape and perfect all things**; who can fathom the **pages of the Dao’s Virtue**?
That **you oversee all beings**; how can one discuss the **governance of the unseen realms**?

The distinctions of noble and humble ranks,
Which bind the scholar’s rise and fall,
Establishing the hundred officials—ancient and modern call this the **Heavenly Art**,
Setting forth the Five Sacrificial Garments—sages attribute this to **Heaven’s Mandate**.

Thus, to harmonize all undertakings with due propriety,
To govern the myriad people with just administration,
To uphold the **Dao’s Virtue** as sovereign authority,
To assist and guide the governance of the unseen realms.

Your humble servant, **Official of the Daoic Ritual**, reflecting upon my own mediocrity,
Yet equally blessed by the **Transformative Nurturing**,
Studying the **Confucian Way** to cultivate myself,
Hoping for advancement through scholarly merit,
With sincere devotion and respectful intent,
I now erect this **Sacred Altar**,
At the very beginning of our rites,
As the first act of **Communing with the True**.

Now the night-watch has ended, the morning light ascends.
The **Celestial Path** is clear and bright—all behold the **subtle essence** of drifting mists;
The **Incense Altar** stands serene—together we gaze upon the **refined and solemn** presence.
With **feathered insignia** and **cranes’ grace**, the **scholar’s cap** stands erect like a **wild goose**,
Bearing aloft the **Divine Model**, reverently addressing the **True Spirits**,
Hoping through my **sincere and earnest longing** to fulfill my **earnest petitions**.

Your servant, **Certain**, dwelling in the **Daoic Realm**, entrusting myself to the **Mysterious Stages**,
Revealing the **tilted piety** of this turbid age,
Guiding the **Great Benevolence** to spread far and wide.
Moreover, presenting these **respectful words**, how dare I not submit them above?

With a heart sincere, I now **declare my petition**.

**Examine closely these words**, and **see clearly my true intent**—
The **Most August Sage** deigns to hear within the **dim and distant**,
While the **common mortal** exhausts their nature in the **fleeting and illusory**.

Since the **unseen realms** have now been contacted,
It is fitting that my **earnest prayers** be granted in harmony.
Perhaps this humble form may receive the **showering blessings**,
To continue offering **fragrant incense**, humbly presenting **devoted reverence**.

Your servant has heard:
There exists a **Primordial Unity**, first before Heaven and Earth;
Its name does not fade, eternally manifest through ancient and modern times.
Those who attest to it call it **Saint** or **Divine**,
Those who ponder it observe its **wonder** and **boundaries**.

It encompasses the **Vast Daoic Qi**—who can discuss its **Root Source**?
Only through **clarity**, **tranquility**, and **spiritual purity**,
Does its **harmonious unity** prevail;
All **capacities**, **actions**, and **guardianships**,
In essence, return to the same **principle**.

The **flow of the Dao** depends upon
The **enlightenment of the individual**.

At this pure and clear dawn,
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
We invite the assembly of law to kindle the first incense strand,
Praying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,
Offering devotion to the **Natural Primordial Lord of the Perfected Caverns**,
The **Jade Throne Lord of the Mysterious Dao**,
The **Lord of the Great Dao, the Venerable Old Lord of the Mixed Unity**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven**,
And all the **Illustrious Dao Lords**.

With body, spirit, and life surrendered,
We prostrate ourselves in reverence,
And with this incense strand’s merit,
We bless the current emperor.

May his blessings be as boundless as Heaven,
His virtue ever renewed like the sun,
His merit saving all living beings,
His grace extending to all plants and creatures,
So that all tribes within and without submit to **Ren**,
And all nations embrace the **harmonizing Dao**.
May the wind of **Mixed Unity’s purity** spread,
And the **Great Dao’s harmonious transformation** flourish,
With the virtuous ascending to office,
And the wicked vanishing into obscurity.

Now, through this incense offering,
We take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
We preserve Heaven’s eternal life,
And align with the **True and Perfect Way**.

We have heard:
The **Thirty-Six Divisions of Mysterious Speech** transcend the mundane and establish the Dao;
The **Infinite Billions of Victorious Treatises** transcend desire and reveal the True.
They illuminate the **Celestial Scriptures of the Constellation**,
Unfold the **River-Luo diagrams**,
Explain the **unspeakable principles**,
Exhaust the **limitless depths**,
Open the **Dao’s Triple Mystery**,
And proclaim the **multitude of wonders**.
They unfold the **Mixed Unity’s secrets**,
And reveal the **Sages’ divine hearts**.

At this auspicious moment,
How could we forget repaying our roots?

At this pure and clear dawn,
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
We invite the assembly of law to kindle the second incense strand,
Praying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,
Offering devotion to the **Three Supreme Lords of the Jade Emperor**,
The **High Perfected Ones who expound the Law**.

With body, spirit, and life surrendered,
We prostrate ourselves in reverence,
And with this incense strand’s merit,
We dedicate it to the **certain family’s Nine Mysterious, Seven Ancestral ritual officials**,
And to the **lingering spirits and lost souls**.

May sins be purged and the **Red Cliff’s path** opened to salvation;
May we transcend the Dao’s shores and wander freely at the **Xian’s Gate**.
May blessings flow endlessly,
And virtuous fragrance blaze brightly,
So that living kin may share in these joys.
May the **Black Register’s guilt be erased**,
And the **Green Tablet’s lifespan extended**,
Restoring the **Dao’s innate clarity**,
And securing **pure and lasting happiness**.

Now, through this incense offering,
We take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
We ascend to the **Formless Realm**,
And align with the **True and Perfect Way**.

We have heard:
**"Mysterious, yet more mysterious—
Great, yet transforming—this is called Sage."**
The Dao is not the ordinary Dao;
Divine and enlightened, it resides within humanity.

From **One**, the **Three** emerge—
Who contains the **Three** yet remains **One**?
Only through **verification’s mystery**,
Can the **rare and wondrous winds** be fully realized.

Now, donning the scholar’s cap,
We humbly await the **True One’s chariot**.

At this pure and clear dawn,
Ascending the altar to perform the Dao,
We invite the assembly of law to kindle the third incense strand,
Praying that this fragrant smoke may ascend to the heavens,
Offering devotion to the **Three Realms’ Supreme Lords and Saintly Assemblies**,
The **High Spirits who transmit the Law and save beings**.

With body, spirit, and life surrendered,
We prostrate ourselves in reverence,
And with this incense strand’s merit,
We dedicate it to **certain ritual officials**,
Registering their names in the **Luck Ledger**,
And adding their years to the **Lifespan Book**.
Bathing in the **Three Realms’ radiance**,
And receiving the **Thousand Perfected Ones’ blessings**,
May calamities vanish and blessings abound.

Now, through this incense offering,
We take refuge in the **Great Saintly Perfected Ones’ supreme virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
We eternally preserve life,
And align with the **True and Perfect Way**.

**Chanting the Square Array, Repenting the Square Array, Commanding Demons—**
Three awakenings, three rites.
Reaffirming the **Law’s station**.

The **certain humble subject**, along with the assembled ritual officials,
Solemnly and sincerely petition:
The **Supreme Boundless Dao**,
The **Three Realms’ Supreme Lords**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of Boundless Heaven**,
The **Ten Directions’ Great Saints**,
The **Thirty-Six Divisions’ Venerable Scriptures and Mysterious Master of the Great Law**,
The **Spirits of the Sacred Treasure**,
The **Five Emperors and Three Officials**,
The **Round Sky’s Mysterious Symbols**,
All **Celestial Tribunals and Spirits**,
The **Cavernous Peaks and Sacred Waters’ Saints**,
The **Luck Registrars**,
The **True Lord who Oversees Offerings and Examinations**,
The **Officials who Record and Assess**,
The **Responsive Virtues of the Dao and Its Manifestations**,
And all **True Spirits**.

We have heard:
The **Dao’s Law is natural**,
Uniting the **Great Harmony** to universally save.
**Supreme Goodness, like water**,
Follows all desires that arise.

In silence, we trace the **origin of descent and oversight**,
And clearly perceive the **principle of mutual causation**.

We humbly reflect:
**Loving virtue** is one of the **Five Blessings**,
And **accumulating goodness** precedes **achieving renown**.

Like a spring’s source or a tree’s roots,
Thus, **Heaven’s bestowal** must be nurtured by **virtue’s foundation**,
And the **Bright Spirits’ guidance** must lead through **goodness’ path**.

The **certain ritual official**, from ancient times,
Has received the Dao’s transformation,
Fortunate to bathe in the **True Wind’s influence**,
Knowing that **virtuous deeds** open the **source of blessings**,
And that **accumulating goodness** establishes **renown’s foundation**.

Fearful of past transgressions obstructing progress,
And mindful of frail humanity’s anxieties,
We now invoke the **True Science of the Jade Register**,
And summon the **Chariot of the Celestial Capital**,
Hoping that **Heaven may bestow wisdom**,
And the **Bright Spirits illuminate our hearts**,
So that through **virtue**, demonic obstacles may not intrude,
And through **goodness**, malevolent fates may not prevail.
May we enjoy the **Five Blessings of a complete body**,
And fulfill our **lifelong aspiration to aid all**,
With the **young and old of our household** all sharing in rest,
And the **entire assembly of officials and scholars** alike enjoying blessings.

Yet we fear that **certain ritual officials**,
From past lives to this one,
May have committed **transgressions in the Three Realms**,
Or **accumulated sins through the Six Senses**,
Or remain unpardoned in the **Day Palace or Moon Bureau**,
Or be unexcused in the **Celestial Tribunals or Earthly Offices**—
All we beseech for **pardon and universal grace**.

May the **East’s Green Tablet** and the **South’s Red Script** record their **accumulated goodness**,
And bestow **honor and longevity’s blessings**.
What we pray for may reach the heavens,
And our sincerity may be fulfilled—
So that the **departed may escape suffering and ascend**,
The **living may extend their years and increase their blessings**,
And all **sentient beings** may thrive in life’s fulfillment.
Above, we honor the **Heavenly Sage’s nurturing benevolence**,
And below, we fulfill our **subjects’ sincere devotion**.
With reverence, we present this petition.

The **knowing gong sounds**,
And the **Twelve Wishes** are declared.

「At the outset, the practitioner must focus the mind and burn incense.
The High Functionary re-establishes the altar.
The Incense Officials, Dragon and Tiger Attendants of the Left and Right,
and the Celestial Spirits attending the incense—
let them command the practitioner’s previous sites of morning devotion and ascension to the platform,
whereupon golden nectar and elixir jade shall spontaneously arise,
along with rare herbs and myriad sacred beings,
all gathering before this incense altar.

May the practitioner’s pious sincerity be swiftly conveyed
by the Ten Directions’ Immortal Boys and Jade Girls,
who attend the fragrant clouds,
to the Supreme Sovereign’s Most High and Pure Dao of the Utmost Extremes,
the Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity,
and the Jade Sovereign of Heavenly Highness before the Celestial Court.

At the outset, the practitioner exits the hall to chant.
Stepping outside, they are led to the Six Canopied Hall.

**Ritual of the Liturgical Hall of Wenchang’s Auspicious Blessings**
**Midday Dao Ritual**

The ceremonial rites ascend the platform as prescribed.
The Master of the Lecture begins the recitation,
each officiant paying homage in accordance with the ritual’s intent.
The High Functionary proclaims the **Sacred Talismans of the Spirit Guard**.

The **Jade Spirit** and **Crimson Flame** ignite,
flaming clouds and gusting winds surge in might.
The **Eight Radiant Celestial Wheels** of the Heavenly Light revolve with vigor,
their **omnipresent awe** enveloping all realms.
Their **dynamic interplay** spans the Ten Directions—
**Golden Elixir cascades**, vanquishing all demons.
They **banish deceit and subdue malevolence**,
illuminating the **Primordial Merit**.
**Golden Talismans** summon and command,
**Cloud-riding banners** control the dragons.
**Sacred hymns** resound in celebration,
**Flowers of the void** scatter through the cosmos.
The **Divine Influence** is auspiciously manifest,
the **Four Quarters** secure in peace and harmony.
Bowing before the Celestial Sovereign,
we are ever reverent and aligned with **Dao and True Essence**.

At the outset, the **Law Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.
The High Functionary opens the altar.
The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin** of the Three **Qi** (炁),
the **Most High Dao Sovereign**,
the **Most High Lao Sovereign**—
let them summon forth from the practitioner’s body
the **Three Five Officials of the Spirit Bureau**,
the **Left and Right Attendants and Messengers**,
the **Left and Right Incense Bearers**,
the **Dragon Couriers and Mounted Officials**,
the **Golden Boys attending the incense**,
the **Jade Girls scattering words and flowers**,
and the **Thirty-Six Direct Talismans**,
the **Thirty-Six Direct Incense Officials**,
each in groups of **Thirty-Six**—
all emerging in **solemn attire and radiant robes**,
with **crowns and trailing ribbons**,
invoking the **Mysterious Platform’s Land and Spirit Lords**,
the **Regional Deities and Celestial Worthies**.

The practitioner, now at midday,
ascends the platform to perform the Dao Ritual,
and humbly presents this as their **sincere intent**—
their **earnest devotion** already inscribed and reported.
May they receive the **Most High Dao’s Ten-Directional True Qi**,
the **Spirit Treasures’ Auspicious Light**,
descending to infuse their bodies,
so that their **pious sincerity** may swiftly reach
the **Supreme Sovereign’s Utmost Extremes Dao**,
the **Three Pure Ones of Highest Sanctity**,
and the **Jade Sovereign of Heavenly Highness** before the Celestial Court.

The practitioner requests the **invocation of the Liturgical Rank**.
With the **Assembled Officials** and all present,
they **united in sincerity** humbly petition:

The **Most High Void-Natural Primordial Origin Celestial Sage**,
then the **Nine Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens**,
the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Sovereigns**,
the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**,
the **Celestial Sovereigns of All Heavens**,
the **Purple Cloud and Great Cloud Enclosure Celestial Seats’ Star Lords**,
the **Five Emperors**,
the **Three Primordial Worthies**,
the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures’ Master of the Mysterious Middle**,
the **Eleven Great Luminaries’ Star Lords**,
the **Northern Dipper and Southern Pole Star Lords**,
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations’ Star Lords**,
the **Wenchang’s Eastern Tablet and Literary Star Lords**,
the **Seven Stars of Virtuous and Sage Worthies**,
the **Twelve Palace Spirit and True Star Lords**,
the **Wenchang Star Lord**,
the **Three Platform Star Lords**,
the **Progression of Virtue Star Lord**,
the **Minor Assemblies’ True Star Lords**,
the **Round Canopy Star Host’s True Lords**,
the **Most High of the Upper Clarity’s Great Cloud Southern Crimson Wenchang True Person**,
the **Most High Nine Qi**,
the **Wenchang Palace’s Immortal Officials**,
the **Master of the Star Host’s Auspicious Manifestation**,
the **Nine Heavens Elder of Qingcheng Mountain**,
the **Nine Heavens’ Life Registry Official of Linshan Mountain**,
the **Nine Heavens’ Inspection Messenger of Lushan Mountain**,
the **Five Sacred Peaks’ Imperial Sovereigns**,
the **Four Sacred Rivers’ Source Kings**,
the **Auspicious Blessings’ Registrars**,
the **True Lord of the Moral and Auspicious Examinations**,
the **Heroic and Loyal King of Martial Splendor and Universal Salvation**,
the **Examiners and Subordinate Officials of Auspicious Blessings and Moral Registers**—
all **responsive to virtue and aligned with the Dao**,
the **Sacred Spirits without exception**.

The practitioner hears that they **encompass all with boundless embrace**,
their **Mysterious Influence** unfathomable and profound;
they are **all-knowing and righteous**,
assisting the **Dao’s Transformation** in endless cycles.
They are **keenly perceptive and upright**,
endorsing the **Dao’s Influence** without end.

「For the **Dao/Way** is most supreme,
hence it serves as the foundation for all ranks;
For the **Dao/Way** is most divine,
hence it is entrusted to the common and the vulgar alike.

From the **primordial simplicity** it disperses to form vessels and officials,
each must rely upon its own kind—
the virtuous become teachers to the unvirtuous,
the talented nurture those without talent.

**This humble servant**, dwelling in the midst of worldly filth,
has practiced the **scholar’s cap** and its traditions.
**Holding fast to antiquity while mastering the present**,
to serve as a net for the **auspicious blessings of the current reign**;
**delving deeply into learning and pondering with precision**,
to meet the demands of the **examiners of the Moral and Auspicious Registers**.

**Reflecting upon fate’s decree** in gain and loss,
**knowing wealth and noble status** lie in **Heaven’s will**.
Those who seek but fail to obtain
are bound by the **innate hindrances of the lowest rank**;
Those who feel and must comply
are blessed by the **boundless compassion of the supreme Dao/Way**.

Thus, with **sincere and earnest devotion**,
I invoke the **Mysterious Influence** of the **True Lord of the Moral and Auspicious Examinations**.

Gazing toward the **Celestial Gate** in the distant void**,
my spirit wanders the **jade steps of the Divine Palace**;
**Disseminating fragrant incense through the boundless expanse**,
in silent contemplation, I envision the **Golden Countenance**.

**We, Your servants**, bearing the **sacred scriptures of the Dao/Way**,
proclaim the **pure teachings of the Celestial Capital**,
now humbly present this petition—
**to earnestly plead for divine favor**,
and with **midday sincerity**, declare our **supreme devotion**.

**The declaration is made.**

Upon **scrutinizing these words with clarity**,
**the True Lord perceives our utmost sincerity**.
**Surely the Most High will show mercy**,
**and regard this heart’s submission**—
**forgiving even the gravest offenses**,
**bestowing blessings abundantly as rivers overflow**,
**with incense rising in praise**,
**and bowing in humble reverence**.

**This servant hears** that within the **Four Great Realms**,
**Your Majesty reigns supreme**;
and that in the **Nine Categories of the Great Range**,
**the Imperial Sovereign establishes the ultimate foundation**.

The **worthy and capable** rely upon You to ascend in office,
the **people** depend upon You for peace and security.

At this **midday hour**, ascending the altar to perform the **Dao**,
we request the **law-assembled** to light this first incense strand,
wishing its fragrant smoke to ascend to the heavens,
offering **supreme reverence** to the **Three Realms’ Most Honorable Sovereign**,
the **Primal Dao’s Precious Treasure**.

We submit **body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrating with heads to the earth,
and with this incense’s merit,
we pray for our **current Emperor**.

May his **lifespan endure like Southern Mountain’s grandeur**,
his **virtue/power** vast as the boundless sea.
May **arms lay down in repose**,
and the **Great Unity** endure without end;
may the **four seas** know tranquil peace,
and the **Five Stars** align in harmony.

Let **worthy scholars** rise from obscurity,
and **talented people** gather beneath the **pure radiance**;
bestow blessings upon the common folk,
and flourish the myriad multitudes.

Now, through this incense-burning,
we **take refuge** in the **Dao’s Great Sage’s Most Authentic Virtue/Power**.
After attaining the **Dao**,
we **preserve Heaven’s eternal existence**,
harmonizing with the **True and Authentic**.

We hear that in **corrupt ages**, no grace surpasses **nurturing life**;
and that **mortal bodies**, once abandoned,
are **hardly repaid** in this world.
This **body** depends upon it for **action**,
this **Dao** relies upon it for **establishment**.

「With the present moment upon the **Midday Star** (☉),
ascending the altar to perform the **Dao’s rites** (道),
we humbly request the **lawful assembly** (法眾) to take this second pinch of incense,
wishing that this incense smoke may **ascend to the heavens** (腾空俓上),
offering reverence to the **Celestial Jade Emperor** (太上琼楼玉检),
and to all **sacred scriptures** (一切經寶).

We, the subjects, **take refuge** (皈) in **body** (身),
**take refuge** in **spirit** (神),
and **take refuge** in **fate** (命),
prostrating our heads to the earth.
Through this act of lighting the incense,
we **dedicate its merit** (功德)
to the **current ritual master** (今辰醮官某家),
for the **ascension and guidance** (資度) of our **ancestors** (曾萬祖),
and the **nine generations of departed spirits** (九世先靈).

May we **refine and purify** (煉沐) our **spirit and soul** (神魂),
and **transcend the path of delusion** (超出群迷之徑).
May we **cleanse our sins** (浄除愆咎),
and **enter the realm of blessed fortune** (別生景福之天).

May we **ascend to the Mysterious Gate** (入希夷門),
**sever the cycle of rebirth** (斷輪迴路),
and **illuminate the realm of existence** (光生阀阅).
May our **descendants** (子孫) rejoice in this merit,
and our **present revered kin** (見在尊親)
share in the **blessings and joys** (利樂).

May the **True Qi** (真氣) gather and flourish abundantly,
and the **Spirit of the Grain** (穀神) be complete and harmonious,
strengthening the **foundation of blessings** (福基),
and extending the **measure of longevity** (寿算).

Now, through this incense-burning,
we **take refuge** in the **Sutra’s Great Sage’s Most Authentic Virtue/Power** (經尊大聖眾至真之德).
After attaining the **Dao** (得道之後),
we **ascend to the Formless** (升入無形),
harmonizing with the **True and Authentic** (和與道合真).

We hear that **rank and fortune** are **not bestowed in vain** (禄岂徒致),
for their attainment **must have its foundation** (致之必有其基);
and that **reputation and name** are **not achieved without cause** (名岂徒成),
for their fulfillment **must have its root** (成之必有其本).
**Rank comes from accumulated goodness** (禄以善积而始致),
and **reputation arises from cultivated virtue** (名因德修而及成).

With the present moment upon the **Midday Star** (☉),
ascending the altar to perform the **Dao’s rites** (道),
we humbly request the **lawful assembly** (法眾) to take this third pinch of incense,
wishing that this incense smoke may **ascend to the heavens** (腾空俓上),
offering reverence to the **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Mysterious Capital** (太上玄都瑶阙证真),
and to all **sacred scriptures** (一切師寶).

We, the subjects, **take refuge** (皈) in **body** (身),
**take refuge** in **spirit** (神),
and **take refuge** in **fate** (命),
prostrating our heads to the earth.
Through this act of lighting the incense,
we **dedicate its merit** (功德)
to the **current ritual master** (醮官某).

May **Heaven enlighten our wisdom** (天启智能),
and the **Divine aid our virtuous deeds** (神扶德業),
so that our **accumulated goodness may grow like a mountain** (俾善功之山積),
and **rank and fortune arrive like a cauldron** (致科名之鼎来).
May we **cleanse past transgressions** (除已往之愆),
and **gather abundant blessings** (集有餘之慶).

For all those in their **years of life** (行年之上),
or **fateful moments** (命運之中),
whether they face **hidden calamities** (暗曜) or **silent misfortunes** (默符),
or encounter **critical reversals in fortune** (值運元之衝破),
or **the decline of their vital essence** (當氣本之衰微),
we humbly pray that each may **bathe in celestial grace** (各沐玄休),
and **revere the Dao’s influence** (仰承道荫),
transforming **ill fortune into good** (變凶為吉),
and **bestowing rank and prolonging life** (注禄延龄).

Now, through this incense-burning,
we **take refuge** in the **Teacher’s Great Sage’s Most Authentic Virtue/Power** (師尊大聖眾至真之德).
After attaining the **Dao** (得道之後),
we **eternally preserve Heaven’s existence** (永保長存),
harmonizing with the **True and Authentic** (和與道合真).

**Recite the spell** (唱方), **confess the spell** (忏方), **command the demon** (命魔),
**three invocations** (三啟), **three obeisances** (三禮).
**Reaffirm the sacred position** (重稱法位).

We, the **subjects of each rank** (具位臣某),
along with the **assembled ritual officials** (合坛官眾等),
sincerely and together **invoke** (上启):
the **Celestial Way of the Supreme Extremity** (太上無極大道),
the **Three Realms’ Most Revered Sovereign** (三境至尊),
the **Heavenly Jade Emperor of the Supreme Clarity** (昊天玉皇上帝),
the **Ten Directions’ Great Sages** (十方大聖),
the **Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scripture** (三十六部尊經),
the **Mysterious Master of the Supreme Middle Law** (玄中大法師),
the **Spiritual Treasures of the Numinous Jewel** (靈寶眾真),
the **Five Emperors and Three Officials** (五帝三官),
the **Celestial Bureau of the Rounded Concave and Mysterious Symbols** (圓穹玄象天曹一切靈仙),
the **Holy Assembly of the Penetrating Peaks and Sacred Altars** (洞天岳渎聖眾),
the **Celestial Registrars of Rank and Fortune** (司禄主者),
the **True Lord of the Imperial Examinations** (職貢舉真君),
the **Celestial Officials in Charge of Records and Examinations** (掌籍考校官屬),
the **Divine Response of the Dao and its Moral Influence** (道德應感),
and all **true spirits** (一切真靈).

We hear that the **high and low** (高者下者),
are all **manifestations of the wondrous Dao** (皆妙道之委形).
All **life and nurturing** (生之畜之) are **the vital breath of the Great Unity** (尽一元之冲气).」

The Dao is indeed the primordial ancestor of the Great Unity—who can fathom its divine mystery?
Humans dwell within the dual forces of yin and yang, yet alone possess the refined essence.

Though the Nine Schools differ in doctrine, all partake of the harmonious Five Phases.
Some stars and constellations store their essence, some mountains and rivers nurture their purity—
truly relying on the molding of Creation,
to become the flutes and drums of virtue and the Dao.

Endowed with noble spirits, granted wondrous functions,
simple yet vast as the uncarved block, profound as the valley,
acting virtuously when opportunity arises, responding to the times with goodness—
thus establishing governance among the common folk,
and spreading harmony across all lands.

This humble ritual official, entrusted with the keys of mystical power,
carrying the embryo of Creation’s work,
has yet to repay the boundless grace with even a speck of dust,
and drifts through this transient world, vainly consuming years in vain.

Now, I wish to respond to the call of the enlightened age,
to repay the sincerity of past days.
Yet I fear my karmic obstacles are profound, my blessings meager—
reverently offering pure and solemn rites,
earnestly opening the altar of purification,
relying on the wondrous patterns to present my sincerity,
through incense and smoke, to convey my earnestness.

I humbly pray that the Nine Celestial Worthies look down with favor,
that the assembled saints radiate their light,
that they take pity with boundless compassion,
and open the path of great forgiveness.

As for this ritual official, from countless past lives,
down to this present incarnation,
unaware of the True Way, ignorant of scriptures and precepts,
indulging in licentious desires, abandoning righteousness for wrong,
with accumulated sins too numerous to count—
my ancestors are already condemned, my descendants suffer calamity.

Now, having entered the gate of repentance,
I seek the path of renewal.
May those not yet pardoned be pardoned,
those not yet absolved be absolved—
granting my earnest wish for merit and fortune,
heeding my sincere desire to return to the Way,
transforming my fate of decline into one of joy,
fulfilling my lifelong aspiration for the crimson cassia’s high rank;
may I, like the aged yellow crane, share in the prosperity of this flourishing age.

May blessings be evenly bestowed upon all beings,
may the radiance of grace extend to the eight extremes—
above, illuminating the Heavenly Sovereign’s boundless mercy,
below, fulfilling the devotion of these humble servants.

With deepest reverence, I present this petition.

*(Know the gong’s strike, twelve wishes fulfilled.)*
**Ritual:** Focus the spirit, burn incense.

**High Functionary:** Rekindle the incense burner.
**Incense Officials and Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Spirits of the Incense—**
Command that the place where this humble one formerly ascended the altar at noon,
now spontaneously generates golden elixir, emerald jade, mushrooms, and hundred-spirits’ herbs,
as the assembled worthies gather before this incense burner.

May the celestial youths and jade maidens of the Ten Directions
attend to the fragrant mist,
and swiftly convey the sincerity of this humble one’s petition
to the presence of the Most High Dao of the Boundless Supreme,
the Three Pure Ones, and the Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Sovereignty.

**Ritual:** Exit the hall to chant the hymn.
**Exit the door,** lead to the Six-Curtain Hall.

**Second Petition:**

**Ritual:** Lift the incense, focus the spirit and burn incense.
**High Functionary:** Rekindle the incense burner and proclaim the **Spirit-Safeguarding Incantations**.

As the Five Stars shine brightly and auspicious **qi** floats aloft,
**Yuan Shi** gathers the divine essence, and Heaven and Earth exchange their cycles.
With jade talismans and sacred seals in hand, the **Dao/Way’s** subtle command resounds—
Flame is cast and majesty displayed, leaving no room for malice or deceit.
Ten thousand demons are subdued, their chaotic forms dispelled;
Monstrous beings and evil forces are crushed, as the **Dao/Way’s** vital **qi** circulates freely.
Divine light illuminates the night, dispelling all darkness.
Ten thousand spirits descend in order, riding the gusts of celestial breeze,
And all living beings prosper, with blessings spread across the **Dao/Way’s** sacred land,
In perfect harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.

Strike the **Dharma** drum twenty-four times.

**High Functionary:** Open the incense burner.

Convoke the **Supreme Three Heavens’** **Xuan Yuan Shi**—the **Three Five** (of the Three Pure Ones),
the **Supreme Dao Lord**, and the **Supreme Old Lord**—
to summon forth from our bodies the **Thirty-Six Officials of the Dao/Way**,
the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
the Left and Right Incense Bearers,
the **Cavalry Dragon** and **Brilliant Officials**,
the **Golden Boys** who attend the incense,
and the **Jade Maidens** who scatter flowers and transmit words.
Also, the **Five Emperors’** direct talismans,
the **Direct Day** incense officials,
each thirty-six in number, shall emerge.

Those who exit shall don solemn and resplendent attire,
with caps and sashes trailing their fine ribbons.
Open the **Mysterious Dao/Way’s** altars, summoning the **Land Spirits** and **Divine Beings** of the realm.

This humble one, in quiet night,
ascends the altar to practice the **Dao/Way**,
and now humbly presents this **sincere petition**,
with all earnestness of heart already recorded and heard.
May the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** most exalted **qi** of the Ten Directions,
the **Sacred Treasure’s** luminous blessings,
descend and flow into our bodies,
so that this humble one’s sincere supplication
may swiftly reach the **Most High Dao/Way’s** presence of the Boundless Supreme,
the **Three Pure Ones**, and the **Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Sovereignty**.

**Ritual:** Invoke the **Dharma** positions.
**All Officials and the High Functionary of this humble one**,
in unison with the assembled worthies,
now humbly present this **sincere petition**,
addressing the **Supreme Natural Yuan Shi** of **Voidless Primordial Heaven**,
then the **Nine Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens**,
the **Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors**,
the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors**,
all **Heavenly Sovereigns**,
the **Star Lords** of the **Purple Enclosure (Zi Wei)** and **Supreme Enclosure (Tai Wei)**,
the **Five Emperors**,
the **Three Primordial True Ones**,
the **Eleven Great Luminaries**,
the **Star Lords of the Northern Dipper (Bei Dou)** and **Southern Dipper (Nan Chen)**,
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,
the **Star Lord of Eastern Literature and Talent (Dong Bi Wen Chang)****,
the **Seven Stars of Virtuous Worthies (Xian Liang)****,
the **Twelve Constellations of the Celestial Lodges (Shi Er Gong)**)**,
the **Star Lord of Literature and Prosperity (Wen Chang)****,
the **Star Lords of the Three Platforms (San Tai)****,
the **Star Lord of Advancing Virtue (Jin Xian)****,
the **Star Lords of the Minor Multitude (Shao Zhong)**)**,
the **Star Lords of the Round Enclosure (Yuan Qiong)**)**,
the **Supreme Pure Star Lord of the Southern Vermilion (Nan Zhu)**)**,
the **Supreme Nine Breaths (Qi)** of the **Dao/Way**,
the **Celestial Officials of the Literature and Prosperity Palace (Wen Chang Gong)**)**,
the **Star Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Cavalry Dragon (Jian Sheng Dou)**)**,
the **Star Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Ninefold Sage of Qingcheng Mountain (Qingcheng Shan Jiu Tian Zhang Ren)**)**,
the **Star Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Commanding Officer of Lushan Mountain (Lushan Shan Jiu Tian Cai Fang Shi Ren)**)**,
the **Star Lord of the Nine Heavens’ Messenger of Lushan Mountain (Lushan Shan Jiu Tian Cai Fang Shi Ren)**)**,
the **Five Sacred Peaks’** **Holy Emperors**,
the **Four Great Waters’** **Source Kings**,
the **Officials of Auspicious Registration and Examination (Si Lu Zhu Ren)****,
the **Star Lord of Examination and Registration (Gong Ju Zhang Ji Kao Xue Guan Shu)**)**,
the **Mighty and Loyal King of Martial Splendor and Broad Salvation (Ying Xian Wu Lie Zhong You Guang Ji Wang)**)**,
the **Examiners and Registrars** who oversee records and assessments,
and all **Divine Beings** who respond to moral conduct.

This humble one has heard that the **Dao/Way** was established in the **Mixed Primordial** era,
and all beings were classified under the **Great Balance (Hong Jun)**.
The **Listed Saints** govern their respective domains,
nurturing and refining the **Great Virtue** of the **Perfectly Molded** (i.e., humanity).
The forests and myriads of celestial lodges
correspond to the **Central Kingdom (Zhong Hua)**.
The **Purple Enclosure (Zi Wei)** and **Supreme Enclosure (Tai Wei)****
oversee the selection of worthy talents,
while the **Southern Pole (Nan Ji)** and **Northern Pole (Bei Ji)****
determine the bestowal of ranks and blessings.
The **Eastern Literature and Talent Star (Dong Bi)**** governs the repository of books,
the **Southern Star (Nan Xing)**** ranks the worthy in the **Palace of Virtuous Worthies (Xian Liang Gong)**)**,
where officials of noble and lowly station are appointed,
and where the fates of life and death are sealed.
All are under the jurisdiction of the **Celestial Ruler (Zai)****,
who governs both **Heavenly Officials** and **Earthly Spirits**.
The **Grand Mountain (Tai Shan)**** holds sway over all official duties,
while the **Seven Curves (Qi Xu)**** controls the affairs of examination and registration.
The **Mysterious Dao/Way’s** exalted mechanisms and sacred regulations
intertwine like the **Great Principles** and **Minor Details**,
promoting the worthy and governing the state.
Thus, we witness the **Heavenly and Human** correspondence,
and understand the **Hidden and Manifest** mutual support—
harmonizing the **Great Unity** for all living beings,
and applying **subtle support** to the **Buddha’s vital breath (Fan Qi)**)**.

This is not merely a weighty tradition of the **Imperial Dao/Way**,
but also a profound mechanism of the **Heavenly Sovereign**.

The **Ritual Official** (of this humble one),
gratefully receiving the **Dao/Way’s** refining and nurturing,
and bearing the **Bright Spirits’** protective favor,
hopes to achieve renown in this age,
and to fulfill one’s conduct in these prosperous times,
to repay the **Great Grace** above,
and to realize one’s innate aspirations below.
With **Garments of the Clouds** as pure companions,
and the **Cloudy Registers** opened in the **Spiritual Hall**,
this humble one cleanses the heart and harbors the spirit,
praying to **Heaven** and petitioning the **Commanding Spirits**.

This humble one has devoted their life to the **True Realm**,
and expounds the **Teachings of the Dao/Way** among mortals.
When called upon to **transmit the Dao/Way** through fasting and ritual,
one must faithfully proclaim its **Loving Benevolence**.
How much more so when entrusted with the **Sacred Essence** and **Solemn Vows**—
dare one not present this petition to **Heaven**?
In this quiet night, with words of sincerity,
one now humbly proclaims the **supplication**.

**Proclamation of the Petition:**

Upon careful observation of the words,
one sees the **Supreme Sincerity** clearly revealed.
Thus, the **Dao/Way** is informed of this humble one’s **devotion**—
the utmost sincerity of their **innermost heart**.
And thus, the **Auspicious Favor** is obtained—
for the **Dao/Way** must surely answer the **sincere wishes** of their supplication.

The fragrant vapors ascend in unbroken succession,
as I pour forth my devout and concentrated essence,
my reverent contemplation deepening,
and I humbly pray for Heaven’s luminous discernment.

I have heard that **Taqing** expounds the Teachings,
valuing emptiness and stillness as the essence of the heart;
**Master Ni** [Confucius] proclaimed the two principles—
the **Middle Way** and the **following of one’s nature**.
He fanned the **Mysterious Wind** beneath the pillars,
and transmitted the **Hidden Meaning** by the **Zhou River’s banks**.
Only because **Heaven** has not abandoned this **Sacred Tradition**,
has the **Holy Dao/Way** endured unbroken, like a sash.

Now this **Supreme Teaching** is truly entrusted to the **Enlightened Ruler**.
In this still night, ascending the altar to perform the **Dao/Way’s rites**,
I pray that the assembled faithful may first light their incense,
and that this fragrant smoke may rise to the heavens,
offering reverence to:
**Dongzhen, the Natural and Original Heavenly Venerable**,
**Dongxuan, the Jade Canopy Dao/Way Lord**,
**Dongshen, the Great Dao/Way Lord of the Mixed Primordial**,
**Tai Shang Haotian, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign**,
and **all the Illustrious Dao/Way Lords**.

With **surrender of body, spirit, and fate**,
we prostrate ourselves in homage,
and with this incense-lighting merit,
we bless the **current Emperor**.

May **virtue/power** flourish ever greater,
and the **Celestial Pattern** endure eternally.
May all the people be nourished by the **Teaching’s rain**,
and scholars alike bathed in its **Dao/Way’s winds**.

May officials and ministers shine like stars of excellence,
and those in governance be as steadfast as mountains and rivers.
May longevity match the **extreme of the Eight Wings**,
and blessings equal the **unshakable foundations of the hills**.

Now, the offering of this incense,
from the outset, **surrendering to the Dao/Way’s** Illustrious Sage, the Great Perfect **Virtue/Power** of the **Most Authentic** Assembly.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
we safeguard the **Celestial Longevity** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.

We have heard that the **Precious Pearl** descends like autumn grains,
spreading the **wondrous and incomprehensible methods**;
the **Jade Array** transmits the **Sutra**,
expounding the **most authentic and correct** interpretations.

We kindle the **flame of the Primordial Dao/Way**,
illuminating the **lost paths of all ranks**.

With this **Dao/Way’s** transcendence to **supernality**,
we must ever recall the **original foundation of this body**.

On this **quiet night**,
ascending the altar to perform the **Dao/Way’s** rites,
we, the **Assembly of All Laws**, solemnly offer these **two incense sticks**,
wishing this incense smoke,
to rise high into the **void**,
and pay homage to the **Most Supreme Lord of the Three Boundless Realms**,
the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign**,
and all the **Illustrious Dao/Way Lords**.

We, the subjects,
**surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrate our heads to the earth,
and with this merit of lighting incense,
we dedicate it to the **officiant of the certain household**,
the **Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors**,
and the **historical lineage of the clan**.

May our **guilt and karma dissolve** like ice in water,
and our **innate nature** shine bright as the moon.
May we roam freely through the **Three Realms**,
and wander in the **Forest of the Sage’s Treasures**.
May **blessings and prosperity** descend upon our **future descendants**,
and **glory and honor** radiate to our **future lineage**.
May our **present parents and kin** alike share in these **benefits and joys**.

May the **True Primordial Essence** grow ever more steadfast,
and **longevity extend to the Southern Pole’s extreme**.
May **blessings and fortune** come in pairs,
and we forever bask under the **shade of the Supreme Clarity**.

Now, the offering of this incense,
from the outset, **surrendering to the Sutra’s** Illustrious Sage, the Great Perfect **Virtue/Power** of the **Most Authentic** Assembly.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
we safeguard the **Celestial Longevity** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.

We have heard that to **proclaim the Dao/Way’s mysteries**,
one must rely on the **Supreme Virtue/Power of the Dao/Way**;
to **spread the winds of the Profound Dao/Way**,
one must depend on the **Most Holy Sage of the Triple Profound**.

We discern the **root qualities of all beings**,
and respond to the **pure sincerity of the common folk**.

In **rank between Heaven and humanity**,
our **principles** permeate the **obscure and manifest**.

On this **quiet night**,
ascending the altar to perform the **Dao/Way’s** rites,
we, the **Assembly of All Laws**, solemnly offer these **three incense sticks**,
wishing this incense smoke,
to rise high into the **void**,
and pay homage to the **Most Supreme Lord of the Dao/Way’s** Sacred Texts, the **Precious Heavenly Sage**,
the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign**,
and all the **Illustrious Dao/Way Lords**.

We, the subjects,
**surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrate our heads to the earth,
and with this merit of lighting incense,
we dedicate it to the **officiants of the certain households**.

May **grace extend to the Six Paths**,
and **mercy reach the Four Generations**.
May all **sentient beings rejoice in the Three Ascensions**,
and the **Four Seas attain the Five Blessings**.

We raise the **Bridge of the Law** to the **Dao/Way’s** shore,
and all escape the **cycle of rebirth**.
We issue **talismans and decrees** to the **netherworld’s gates**,
and universally grant **liberation and enlightenment**.

May the **officiant of the certain household**,
have **evil connections severed**,
and **good fruits perfected**.
Whether it be **a single inch of merit to record**,
to fulfill **renown and fame**,
or to **promote broad salvation**,
we aspire to **repay the refining and nurturing** of the **Dao/Way’s** **Molding**.

Now, the offering of this incense,
from the outset, **surrendering to the Teacher’s** Illustrious Sage, the Great Perfect **Virtue/Power** of the **Most Authentic** Assembly.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
we safeguard the **Celestial Longevity** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.

We **chant the Square**,
**repent the Square**,
and **command the Demon**,
with **three invocations** and **three obeisances**.

We **reaffirm the Law’s station**.
We, the **subjects of all ranks**, along with the **officiants of the altar**,
sincerely present this **humble invocation**,
to the **Supreme Most Boundless Dao/Way**,
the **Most Supreme Lord of the Three Boundless Realms**,
the **Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Sovereign**,
the **Great Sages of the Ten Directions**,
the **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Sutra’s Profound Middle Law**,
the **Sacred Assembly of the Numinous Treasure**,
the **Five Emperors and Three Officials**,
the **Circular Vault of Mysterious Symbols of the Celestial Tribunal**,
all the **Spiritual Immortals**,
the **Holy Assembly of the Caverns and Peaks**,
the **Keeper of Blessings and Officials**,
the **True Lord of Recorded Merit and Examination**,
the **Superintendent of Officials and Moral Retribution**,
and all **True Spirits**.

We have heard that the **Heavenly Sovereign favors none**,
only **the virtuous** are His recipients;
the **Dao/Way’s** **illumination** is **obscured** if not **practiced**,
and it is **precious** for the **superior scholars** to **diligently follow**.

「The **Golden Mouth’s** teachings,
the **Jade Classics’** writings firmly established,
thus knowing that **self-perfection leads to perfecting others**,
**governed by the virtue/power of sincerity and clarity**.

**Those with virtue must speak**,
**their words rooted in conduct and practice**.
For the **scholar’s** study is the **Dao/Way**,
and the **Dao/Way’s** transmission is through **scripture**.

If **conduct** is **abundant** yet **scripture** is **mastered**,
then **scripture** shall not **float above** true practice—
**both conduct and scripture** in harmony,
**bringing radiance to one’s undertakings**.

This is why **finding worthy talent** has always been **difficult**,
and **wise discernment** has ever been **a burden**;
**trusting in the Highest Truth’s** protection,
**conduct and scripture must surely align**.

**Officials of the ritual** (hereafter), humble **Confucian scholar** though I be,
**studying the Sage’s Dao/Way**,
yet my **nature is dull and obtuse**,
my **conduct low and common**—
I **know the Dao/Way** yet **see it dimly**,
I **grasp the difficulty of practice** yet **act with feeble resolve**.
I **wear out my senses** in chasing trivial gains,
I **exhaust my spirit** while turning from the True,
leading to **countless errors in my black records**,
and **lamenting the long road ahead** still **blocked by obstacles**.

Now I **turn to the Great Dao/Way**,
**repenting my past transgressions**,
**walking the hundred paths without arrogance**,
**preserving the One True Principle** while **overcoming self**—
to **establish the foundation for worldly success**,
to **fulfill the rites of serving Heaven**,
**humbly hoping for the True Mercy**,
that my **intentions may harmonize**,
**bestowed with wings of transcendence**,
**opening the path to virtuous governance**.

I **solemnly present** the **model for ascension** in the **Lanfang Register**,
the **Heavenly Decrees’** **cloud-etchings**,
**declaring the Three Realms**,
**repenting to the Ten Directions**,
**fixing my thoughts and offering words**,
**following the proper timing to walk the Dao/Way**.

The **lamp’s** **law-flame** burns brightly,
**dispelling darkness** with its **radiant light**;
the **incense’s** **sincere fragrance** ascends,
**piercing the void** to **reveal its purity**.

**I earnestly pray** that the **Mysterious Capital of the Purple Palace**,
the **Golden Gates and Jade Canopy**,
may **bestow the Ten Directions’** **Sages’** **boundless compassion**,
and **spread the Thousand Truths’** **protective grace**—
**commanding the Three Realms**,
**proclaiming to all Heavens**,
to **grant longevity and blessings**,
to **remove calamities and dispel obstacles**,
**freeing me from the twelvefold misfortunes of the Hostile Stars**,
**clearing the disasters of the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams’** **field divisions**,
all **accumulated sins**,
**endless retributions**,
**past grievances and debts**,
**wrongful killings and unintended harms**—
through **the Three Karmas and Six Roots**,
even **excesses and transgressions**,
**now, through repentance**, I **beg for complete absolution**,
so that I may **earn my merit early** and **fulfill my aspirations**.

**Above**, I pray for the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** **blessings** to **last eternally**,
for the **Imperial Design** to **be firmly rooted**—
**no wars shall arise**,
**border alarms shall cease**,
**droughts and locusts shall not plague**,
**auspicious omens shall come to fruition**.

**Below**, I hope for the **Seven Ancestors’** **transcendent ascent**,
for the **Nine Abysses’** **cessation of judgment**,
that the **Five Sufferings** may **all attain the Dao’s shore**,
and the **Three Paths** may **all be bathed in the Mysterious Wind**—
**spreading the Great Compassion’s** **enlightened grace**,
**equally bestowing merit and virtue**,
**above, clarifying the Heavenly Sovereign’s** **Great Mercy**,
**below, fulfilling my subjects’** **sincere devotion**,
**thus I humbly report**.

**Knowing the Ritual of the Chime-Stone**,
**twelvefold aspirations** (presented).
**Aspiration**: **Concentrating spirit and burning incense**.

**High Functionary restores the furnace**.
**Incense Officials, Messengers, and the Dragon-Tiger Attendants**,

**naturally producing golden nectar and emerald elixir**,
**mushroom and herb essences of myriad spirits**,
**as the assembled Truths gather**,
**here, before this incense furnace**.

**Aspiration**: **Tenfold Sages and Jade Maidens** of the **Ten Directions**,
**attending the fragrant clouds**,

**Aspiration**: **All** pay homage to the **Master**—**concentrate the spirit** and **offer incense** as the law dictates.
**The High Functionary** proclaims the **Soul-Guarding incantations**.
**The Five Stars** align in radiance, **illuminating the Five Directions**.
**The Water Star** repels calamities, **the Woodly Virtue** brings prosperity.
**The Wandering Star** dispels misfortune, **the Great White Star** wards off soldiers.
**The Steady Star** secures fourfold blessings, **benefiting family and nation**.
**Names inscribed on jade tablets**, **characters recorded in the Imperial Archives**.
**Riding the gusts**, **dispersing the brilliance**—
**soaring through boundless space**, **entering and exiting the unseen realms**,
**feasting in the Ten Directions**.
**Five clouds** hover as canopies, **summoning deities** and **restraining the winds**.
**Commanding myriad spirits**, **protecting the Celestial Elder**,
**harmonizing with the Dao/Way’s True Essence**.

**Aspiration**: **Strike the Law-drum twenty-four times**.
**The High Functionary** ignites the incense furnace.
**The Supreme Sovereign’s Three Heavens**—**Primordial Beginning of the Three Mystic Breaths (Sanqi)**, **Most Exalted Five Spirits Elder Lord (Laojun)**—
**summon forth** from my body the **Three Five Officials (Sanwu Gongcao)**,
**left and right attendants and messengers**, **left and right incense-bearers**,
**Dragon-riding couriers and officials**, **golden boys attending the incense**,
**jade maidens transmitting words and scattering flowers**, **the Five Emperors’ direct talismans**,
**incense officials of the True Sun**, **each thirty-six in number**.

**Aspiration**: **The departed**, **strictly attired in resplendent garments**,
**turbans and sashes trailing their emblems**,
**opening the Mystic Platform’s earthly guardians** and **territorial deities**.
**I now ascend the platform to practice the Dao/Way**,
**sincerely presenting this as my heart’s intent**—
**all my earnest aspirations already inscribed and reported**.

**Aspiration**: **I pray** that the **Most Exalted Dao/Way’s True Essence of the Ten Directions**,
**the Spirit-Treasury’s Auspicious Radiance**,

**so that my sincere offerings may swiftly reach**—
**directly presenting to the Most Exalted Boundless Dao/Way**,
**the Three Pure Ones, Most Exalted Sages**,
**and the Heavenly Sovereign’s Jade Emperor’s Numinous Presence**.

**Aspiration**: **Invoke the Law’s station**.
**In my official station**, **I**, **lowly servant** **[name]**, together with the **assembled platform officials**,
**sincerely unite in offering**—

**the Official of True Merit (Zhigong Zhenjun)**—**the Illustrious and Martial Sage of Loyal Aid and Universal Salvation (Yingxian Wulie Zhongyou Guangji Wang)**,

**Aspiration**: **I hear** that **divine mysteries are unfathomable**,
**expanding wisdom beyond all measure**;
**the common folk cannot comprehend**,

---

**We humbly look up to the True Sovereign of the Water Realm,**
**whose abode rests upon the peerless peak of Seven Bends,**
**where the Purple Enclosure shines over the Tong River,**
**and the Imperial Lodge spreads its grace across all prefectures.**
**Clouds march and rains descend, thunder roars and winds soar,**
**your august spirit discerns all without remainder,**
**your enlightened virtue flows ceaselessly without end.**
**You nurture the vast heavens’ transformations,**
**hold the pivot of calamity and blessing—**
**no petition goes unanswered, no inquiry remains unfulfilled.**

**With reverence for the Mysterious Canon,**
**we solemnly invoke the Celestial Rites.**
**May the Sacred Seal and Vermilion Standard**
**temporarily depart the Cavernous Palace,**
**and the wind-driven chariot gather at the Splendid Altar.**

**Overseeing our earnest devotion,**
**your boundless grace shines forth in its purity,**
**and we, your servants, are moved to the utmost sincerity in our reverence.**
**We present our first libation.**
**Music is played.**

**We, the assembled officials and servants,**
**with utmost sincerity, humbly petition the Sovereign of Seven Bends,**
**the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,**
**and all the numinous spirits of the congregation.**

**We hear that the Dao is ever kind in aiding humanity,**
**yet never abandons them;**
**the Most Exalted does not dwell in unvirtue,**
**thus virtue is ever manifest.**

**With the mundane seeking the Sacred, doubt arises from its lofty distance;
With the Sacred responding to the mundane, it shines forth in boundless compassion.**

We humbly revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,
Who penetrates the subtleties of the Dao, delving deep into the Sacred Realm.
For seven score and three generations as a Confucian sage,
Spanning countless centuries through the ages of Han and Cloud,
Illuminating the brilliance of words and deeds,
Standing resolute as frost and thunder—
Slicing through demons in an instant,
Shaking the winds and thunder with but a breath.
His benevolence flows like rivers, his grace permeates all;
He rescues the Shù people from the jaws of wolves,
Restoring the Black Thread’s land to the domain of longevity.
Yet the ignorant remain blind, the foolish unaware.

Though the Shù Mountains were carved and stones inscribed,
Their virtue cannot be fully recorded;
Though the Mín River’s waters were drained to ink the deeds,
Their glory cannot be fully written.

How could the Most True, in responding to the common,
Appear as but a fleeting dream of half a night,
Or fulfill a single plea in the blink of an eye?

This is called the Dao’s exalted height—never abandoning humanity,
And virtue’s grandeur—yet claiming no ownership of it.

Now, we, the ritual officials, in awe of your sacred might,
Solennly open the Splendid Altar,
Humbly praying for your compassionate gaze to descend,
And for your grace to fulfill our earnest devotion.

We submit our petition through the Minister of the Gate,
Daring not to delay—
Our sacred scripture shall be duly proclaimed.

**Proclaim the words.**
**Examine the scripture’s sincerity—its truth is manifest.**

With utmost sincerity and reverence,
Our hearts pour forth in every word;
In solemn purity and devotion,
We seem to draw near to the Divine’s discernment.

We partake in this evening’s grand rites,
Basking in the radiant fortune of auspicious light—
All shall be prosperous, all shall come to fruition.

We, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious supplication,
And present our second libation.
**Music is played.**

We hear that Heaven acts without action,
Yet relies on divine might for its support;
The Great Dao is most wondrous,
And draws upon divine virtue for its manifestation.

Like the twin luminaries illuminating the heavens,
Or the Northern Dipper as the Emperor’s voice—
It is the harmony of virtue and the Dao,
Uniting essence and function in perfect accord.

We revere the Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,
Who walks with Heaven as his companion,
Holds the ancient Dao,
And receives the Mandate from the Most High,
Commanding the vast principles of the lower realm.

When the wooden horses sweat in battle,
It reveals the Great Compassion’s courage;
When the rain-soaked paths burn with fire,
It shows the attainment of One’s radiant spirit.

Now, we in awe of your virtue and might,
Once more extend our sincere devotion.

May your presence come without need of summoning,
Displaying the boundless wonders of your workings;
May all desires be fulfilled,
Aligning with Heaven’s heart to bestow blessings.

We, your servants, are moved to the utmost in pious prayer,
And present our final libation.
**Music is played.**

We, the officials, in utmost sincerity, once more petition:
The Sovereign of Seven Bends, the Master of Offerings and True Virtue,
The Illustrious and Loyal King of Broad Salvation, Warlike Virtue,
Who governs the celestial registers and attends with officials,
And all the numinous spirits of the congregation.

We hear that symbols establish the hierarchy of Heaven and Earth,
And the trigrams weigh the coming and going of great and small;
No age exists without relying on worthy talent,
No talent thrives without the age’s support—
Thus, the principle of mutual benefit dictates
That there must be those who take the lead.

We reverently behold the vast Heaven and august Sovereign,
Who turns His gaze westward,
Entrusting the celestial register to the True One of Seven Bends;
Incomprehensible in thought,
He establishes the mighty hook for the four quarters’ virtuous.

Thus, in harmony with the effortless transformation,
He achieves the wondrous workings of yin and yang’s awe,
Spreading joy among all beings,
And opening enlightened governance across the six directions.

We, the ritual officials, reflect that our nature is dull and blunt,
Our station low and meager—
Yet we have received the boundless grace of your favor,
And been touched by your unfathomable virtue.
Though we have long cherished the classics,
We have yet to attain the broad path.
Relying on the Daoist ranks and talismans,
We seek to fulfill the scholar’s ambition for officialdom—
May the great numbers of your blessings be answered,
And our humble prayers granted:
That the firewood of the lower stove may burn bright,
And our remaining talents may flourish;
That the moon’s immortal osmanthus may grow anew.

May the Sacred Sovereign live long, and the four seas prosper in peace,
His august might tremble the nine barbarians into submission.
Let the scholars gather in harmony, achieving the auspiciousness of advancement;
Let the officials unite in reverence, fulfilling the rites of communication.

May all living things, great and small, be bathed in your blessings.

We, the ritual officials, may have impurities of body or mind,
Or failings in ritual propriety—
Yet with all assembled officials and spirits,
Our myriad faults and sins,
We humbly pray for your boundless compassion to descend,
And grant us pardon—
Above, to honor the Divine’s boundless grace,
Below, to fulfill our collective pious devotion.

**We proclaim the Twelve Wishes.**
**We focus the spirit and burn incense.**

The High Functionary restores the censer.
The Incense Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
And the attendant spirit officials of incense—
Let them command that the place where I once stood in quiet night,
Ascending the altar to practice the Dao,
Shall naturally produce golden elixirs and jade-green herbs,
Hundreds of numinous plants,
As the spirits gather here before this censer’s flames.

May the celestial children and maidens of the ten directions
Attend the fragrant mists,
And swiftly convey my sincere petition
To the presence of the Most High, the Supreme Dao of Non-Extreme,
The Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty.

**We proclaim the return of the Heavenly Sovereign’s crane and chariot.**

**We focus on virtue, transform wealth, and dedicate merit to the multitude.**

**Thirty-six each, now emerge.**

**Those who appear must don resplendent attire,**
**Hats and sashes trailing their emblems,**
**Opening the sacred Daoist altars and summoning the local deities and domain spirits.**

**I now establish this *jiao* (ritual offering) and ascend the altar to practice the Dao.**
**With solemn sincerity, I present my petition as an inner offering—**
**All my earnest devotions have been recorded and conveyed.**
**May the Most High Dao *Qi* of the ten directions descend,**
**The numinous treasures and auspicious radiance flow into my body,**
**So that my sincere petition may swiftly reach**
**The presence of the Most High, the Supreme Dao of Non-Extreme,**
**The Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty.**

**Let the ritual positions be invoked.**
**In my name, [official rank] certain, along with the assembled ritual officials,**
**With united sincerity, I humbly petition:**

**The Most High Primordial Origin of Natural Emptiness,**
**Next, the Nine Sovereigns of the Nine Heavens,**
**The Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors,**
**All Heavenly Sovereigns,**
**The Purple Enclosure and Great Micro-Enclosure Imperial Throne Stars,**
**The Five Emperors, the Three Primordial Sovereigns,**
**The Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures, the Supreme Master of Mystic Dao,**
**The Eleven Great Luminaries, the Northern Dipper and Southern Pole Stars,**

**The Literary Star Sovereign, the Three Platform Stars,**
**The Sovereign of Merit and Worth, the Minor Assembly Stars,**
**The Round Enclosure Stars,**
**The Supreme Pure One of the Great Micro-Enclosure, the South Red Literary Star,**
**The Nine *Qi* (vital essences) of the Literary Star Palace,**
**The Sovereign of the Starry Dipper of Life,**
**The Nine-Heavened Old Man of Qingcheng Mountain,**
**The Nine-Heavened Life Officer of the Hidden Mountain,**
**The Nine-Heavened Commissioner of Gatherings from Lushan Mountain,**
**The Five Sacred Peaks, the Four Sacred Rivers,**
**The Officers of Literary Star and Merit,**
**The Sovereign of Loyal Auxiliary and Broad Salvation,**
**The Merit Officials overseeing records and examinations,**
**The responsive *virtue/power* of Dao and Teachings,**
**All numinous spirits.**

**I have heard that the Great Dao is most tranquil,**
**Widely opening paths for prayer and petition;**
**The High Heavens are kind in response,**
**Broadly unveiling gates of deliverance and salvation.**

**With sincerity, there is sure passage;**
**With no concealment, there is no oversight.**

Thus, through fasting and purification, one may serve the Sovereign,
And with humble offerings, one may venerate the numinous spirits.
If one offers prayers with pure intent and concentrated devotion,
Surely one’s wish for celestial descent will be fulfilled.

This humble *science-officer* [醮官], **[Name]**, steadfastly upholds the Confucian path,
Aspires to success in the imperial examinations,
And earnestly hopes that the **Divine Treasures** [灵宝] may grace him with rules of reverence,
And that the **Sacred Talismans** [仙箓] may mark his rites with hallowed authority.
With utmost sincerity, I establish a solemn altar,
To atone for sins and purify my person, that my **body and vessel** [身器] may shine with clarity;
To attend the descent of the **High Worthies** [高真], that my **mind and spirit** [心神] may transcend earthly bounds.
In grand scale, I emulate the **Heavenly Pattern** [法天] and **Earthly Symbol** [象地];
In modest scope, I offer libations of water and flowers,
Reciting the **Cloud Chapters** [云章] of the *Jade Saddle* [玉笈],
And chanting the **Phoenix Scriptures** [凤篆] of the *Treasure Repository* [宝函].

Now, in perfect stillness, not a speck of dust disturbs,
Nor a murmur stirs the ten thousand sounds.
Faintly, the **jade ornaments** [琼佩] sway in resonance,
As the **Celestial Melodies** [仙韶] begin to play.
Incense swirls, sealing the **sandalwood decrees** [檀篆],
And the **vessels** [器] are cleansed, their **gourd cups** [匏樽] purified.

I humbly pray that the **Assembled Saints** [列圣] may take pity,
And that the **Numinous Worthies** [众真] may respond in harmony.
With **whirlwind chariots** [飙轮] and **cloud-borne thrones** [云驾],
Let them descend together in the **Six Void Realms** [六虚];
With **jewel-palaces** [玉宇] and **crystalline towers** [琼楼],
Let them preside over the **Nine Earthly Regions** [九地].

I summon all spirits to gather in assembly,
To partake in the **concentrated sincerity** [一意] of my devotion,
To embrace the **hundred blessings** [百禄] bestowed upon the **ornamented and dignified** [簪绅],
And to receive the **profound benevolence** [湛恩] of the **ranked and refined** [品汇].

This humble *science-officer* [醮官] and I,
With boundless reverence and earnest supplication,
Prostrate ourselves in hope of celestial favor,
To welcome the **Worthy’s Procession** [仙驾].

Descend the **Saints** [圣], offer tea,
Pour the **first libation** [初进酒], and play music.
The assembled officials, **[Name]**, with utmost devotion present this petition:

To the **Most Venerable of the Three Void Realms** [三境至尊],
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝],
And to the **Saints of All Heavens, All Earths, All Waters, All Mountains** [诸天诸地诸水诸山],
And the **Ten Directions of the Three Realms** [三界十方],
To the **Assembled Saints** [证明列圣].

I have heard that the **Great Dao** [大道] acts without action yet accomplishes all,
And that the **Supreme Saints** [上圣] save all beings without abandoning any.
The **Dao** relies upon humanity to flourish,
And **virtue/power** [德] depends upon humanity to manifest.

Thus, it is said that the **Dao** does not proceed in vain,
Nor does **virtue/power** stand alone.
Above, it draws and nurtures the **scholar-officials** [群士],
Below, it transforms and guides the **common folk** [烝人],
Expanding the **unifying wind** [抱一之风] of the **Dao**,
And opening the **keys to the utmost truth** [至真之教].

This humble *science-officer* [醮官], **[Name]**, has from early days been bathed in the **Mysterious Transformation** [玄化],
And clothed in the **Great Benevolence** [洪恩].
Though I have not yet attained the **Dao’s subtleties** [道微],
I bear the **inherent resources of the fixed and true** [固有之资],
And though I have not yet elevated my **virtuous deeds** [德业],
I possess the **innate potential of good ability** [良能之素].
Now that the **Holy Ruler** [圣主] opens the path to **worthy scholars** [进贤],
And the **examiners** [有司] display the **standards of merit** [较艺之章],
I have awakened the **pure resolve of mutual salvation** [兼济之纯衷],
And kindled the **great vow of active practice** [力行之大愿].
Thus, I rely on **auspicious omens** [羽],
And lift my gaze to the **high vault** [高穹].

What I contemplate is the **Dao**—the **Dao** accomplishes all;
What I depend upon are the **Saints**—the **Saints** abandon no being.
I lay bare my heartfelt plea with utmost sincerity,
Focusing my thoughts and refining my devotion,
Hoping to gather the **wondrous causes** [妙因],
And to swiftly fulfill my **lifelong aspirations** [素志].

The **Assembled Saints of the Circumambient Heaven** [周天众圣],
Shall surely witness my **vermilion sincerity** [丹诚];
And the **Earthly Spirits** [大地灵神],
With compassion, shall surely accept my **pure night’s offering** [清夜].

I submit this petition with solemn reverence—
How dare I fail to present it above?
The **science-officer’s words** [醮词] are sincere,
And I shall faithfully proclaim them.

**Proclamation of the Petition.**

With careful scrutiny of the words,
And piercing insight into the **supreme sincerity** [至诚],
My **heart’s design** [心画] ascends to the **Highest** [上通],
And immediately reaches the **Worthy’s hearing** [高真之听];
The **benevolent light** [慈光] descends to illuminate below,
And surely grants the **desired compliance** [所欲之从].

The **Dao-official** of humble station reflects deeply—
How rare the chance of life’s encounter,
How swiftly the years pass by!
He strives to master learning in anticipation of inquiry,
Hoping to fulfill his aspirations and act upon them.

With deepest reverence, he prays:
May the **Dao’s luminous grace** descend and spread,
May **Heaven’s blessings** be vast and far-reaching,
Purifying the sins of all living beings,
So that he may harmonize with the **prosperous age’s** examinations,
Find his **true master** and meet his **proper time**,
Practice **righteousness** and thereby realize the **Way**.

He humbly hopes that his **ancestors of old**—
Both near and distant, both high and low—
May forever depart the **dark paths**,
Ascending to the **Nine Heavens’** divine ranks;
May their **dense blessings** descend eternally,
Transmitting the **hundred-leaf glory** to posterity.

The **Dao-officials** kneel with utmost devotion,
Offering wine in the **second libation**.
*Music plays.*

They have heard that the **Great Dao** is profound and wondrous,
Shaping all with a single **qi**;
The **Supreme Truth** is natural and spontaneous,
Nurturing all with a single **spirit**.
**Qi** permeates and unites all things,
**Spirit** animates and inspires the multitude—
Though their names differ, they arise from one source,
Mingling as one, yet unseen by things,
Yet endowed in humans as **soul**.
Thus, the **most noble body** is truly a **vessel of the True**,
Whereby its **mysteries** unfold,
And its **heavenly depths** are preserved.
To achieve this harmony of function,
One must ensure **longevity’s permanence**.

The **Dao-official** receives **divine qi** from the **Great Dao**,
And cultivates his **affairs** as a **scholar**.
Like a **sprout that blossoms**,
He must then be worthy of **action**;
Like a **blossom that bears fruit**,
He must then be capable of **fulfillment**.

With deepest prayer, he beseeches the **Worthy Ones**—
May they **springtime regard** him,
May the **Holy Saints** illuminate his path,
Descending **true spirits** to nurture his **spirit**,
Flowing **Dao-qi** to fill his **qi**.
If granted **clever wisdom**,
He shall surely be bestowed with **honored name**;
If granted **honored name**,
He shall surely be extended **longevity’s grace**.
Thus, his **sincere heart’s intent** may take effect,
And the **vision of mutual aid** be realized.

He humbly hopes that his **present revered elders**—
May their **calamities be dispelled**,
Their **auspicious signs** gather,
Their **pine-like faces** resist aging,
Their **jade-like essence** endure eternally,
So that **blessings** may flourish in the future,
And **pure fragrance** descend upon descendants.

The **Dao-officials** kneel with utmost devotion,
Offering wine in the **final libation**.
*Music plays.*

With solemn sincerity, they petition above:
To the **Supreme, Boundless Great Dao**,
The **Three Sovereigns of Ultimate Veneration**,
The **Jade Emperor of Heaven’s Highest Court**,
The **Ten Directions’ Great Saints**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of Esoteric Law**,
The **Soul Jewel’s Assembled Worthies**,
The **Five Emperors and Three Officials**,
The **Celestial Bureaucracy of the Round Sky’s Mysterious Symbols**—
All **spirits and immortals**,
The **Holy Multitudes of the Cavernous Peaks and Sacred Waters**,
The **Officials of Destiny and Merit**,
The **True Prince Who Oversees Sacrificial Offerings**,
The **Registrars and Examiners of Moral Worth**,
All **responsive moral forces** and **true spirits**.

They have heard:
Though the **mysteries** are unobserved, their **auspices** are manifest;
Though **stillness** is clear and **tranquil**, **movement** brings forth life.
To enter **being** without losing **non-being**,
Though responding to **action**, one must not depart from **stillness**.
This is how the **Dao’s function** operates,
And how **virtue’s practice** is realized.

Since the **Ancient Worthies** decreed the **eternal patterns**,
They valued **diligent learning** and **entering governance**,
Not neglecting the **ruler-subject relationship**,
Thus upholding the **moral winds** of the **Way**.

The **Dao-official**, reverently following the **True Principles**,
Duly examining the **Sages’ instructions**,
Eagerly cultivating his **self**,
Anxiously seeking his **sovereign**,
With a **single, upright heart**, awaiting his **time**,
To respond to the **pure dynasty’s** selection.

With deepest prayer, he beseeches:
May the **Emperor** awaken his **wisdom**,
May the **Spirits** guide his **innermost sincerity**,
So that he may **penetrate the mysterious roots**,
Forever unfolding the **mysteries’ functions**,
Storing **rainbow-hued treasures** in his **chest**,
Displaying **embroidered brilliance** at his **pen’s tip**,
Swiftly advancing upon the **great thoroughfare**,
Practicing **scholarly affairs**,
Above, wishing the **Emperor** **longevity without bound**,
That **virtuous ministers** may fulfill their **assisting roles**,
That the **five grains** flourish as the **five offerings** are refined,
And that the **four seas** be at peace while the **nine barbarians** submit.

The **Dao-officials**, with no words to express their **gratitude and reverence**,
Kneel and present the **soup offering**.
*The proclamation is declared.*

The **officers of the assembly**, with utmost sincerity, petition above:
To the **Golden Gate’s Void Three Pure Ones**,
The **Six Celestial Sovereigns of Heaven’s Highest Court**,
The **Heavenly Worthies** and **Heavenly Emperors**,
The **Soul Jewel’s Assembled Worthies**,
The **Five Emperors and Three Officials**,
The **Celestial Bureaucracy of the Round Sky’s Mysterious Symbols**—
All **spirits and immortals**,
The **Holy Multitudes of the Cavernous Peaks and Sacred Waters**,
The **Officials of Destiny and Merit**,
The **True Prince Who Oversees Sacrificial Offerings**,
The **Registrars and Examiners of Moral Worth**,
All **responsive moral forces** and **true spirits**.

They have heard:
The **Sages’ writings** unfold the **Heaven’s profound intent**;
The **examination system** follows the **Jade Records**,
Establishing the **sacred platform for merit’s invocation**.
The **offerings** are now presented,
The **fragrant sacrifices** prepared—
The **Dragon’s chariot** lingers through the **eternal night**,
The **cinnamon wine** ascends in **three reverent libations**.

The **Grand Music Master’s** **august spirit** descends to the **impure realm**,
The **Hundred Spirits’ Sovereign Ruler** pierces through to the **heart-mind**.

The humble petitioner, together with the **officiants of the Daoist ritual (jiào)** and others,

In past lives and this present existence,
Has never yet awakened to the **Dao/Way**;

The **six senses** and **three activities**,
Long steeped in transgressions and errors,
Either killing and harming **sentient beings (yǒuqíng)**,
Or encroaching upon the **common folk (shùlèi)**,
Betraying the **true spirits (zhēn)** and straying from the **Dao/Way**,
Thus committing misdeeds and accumulating guilt,
Our crimes reaching the **Upper Palaces (Shàng Gōng)**,
Our names inscribed in the **Black Registers (hēi bù)**.

Some are bound within the **Seven Elemental Bureaus (Qí Yuán Cáochú)**,
Some within the **Three Officials’ Palaces (Sān Guān Gōngfǔ)**,
Some as **keepers of the Five Sacred Peaks (Wǔ Yuè zhǐshǐ)**,
Some as **clerks of the Four Sacred Waters (Sì Dú zhǔshǔ)**,
Yet we have not received pardon,
Nor have we repented and been absolved.

Again, we fear the **Seven Celestial Luminaries (Qí Yào)**** may descend with censure,
The **Five Agents (Wǔ Xíng)** may inflict retribution,
The **branches and stems (zhīgàn)** of our fate may be exhausted,
Our **great and minor destinies (dàxiǎo yùn)** may reach their end,
Our **three life-spans (sān mìng)** may decline,
The **Nine Celestial Palaces (Jiǔ Gōng)** may be blocked,
**Curses and hexes (zhòuzhòu)** may become obstacles,
**Litigious specters (zhǒngsòng)** may bring calamity—
Unless we entrust ourselves to the **Highest True Ones (Shàngzhēn)**,
There is no means for redemption and release.

Now, we humbly extend our **repentance and purification (chànxǐ)****,
Hoping for universal **pardon and absolution (shèchú)**.
We pray that the **ancestral halls (Zōngmiào)** may be forever safeguarded,
That **arms and conflict (gāngē)**** may forever cease,
That the people shall be free from **epidemic afflictions (yìlì)**,
And the times shall know no **deficiencies of water or drought (shuǐhàn)**.

That the **worthy and talented (xiánjùn)**** may rise to office,
That **thieves and bandits (dào zéi)**** may vanish,
That **barbarians and outsiders (mán yí)**** may submit in harmony,
And that **auspicious qi** may flow universally—
Far and near, all shall cease to voice complaints,
And **all living things** shall flourish in their **natural inclinations**.

That the **Three Paths of Suffering (sān tú)**** may be abandoned,
And the **Six Realms of Rebirth (liù cù)**** may be transcended—
Long receiving the **blessings of the Ultimate Dao/Way (Zhìdào)**,
Forever repaying the **transformations of the Highest True Ones (Gāozhēn)**.

Now, the rites are complete with **three reverent libations (sān xiàn)**,
And no further words need be spoken—
We dread the **ritual lapses (yíjiǔ)**** that may befall,
The **faults of the common and unenlightened (fán yú)**,
And the **profanity (xièdú)**** of our humble acts—
All are earnestly implored for **pardon and forgiveness**.

We look upward, hoping the **Highest True Ones of the Upper Realm (Shàngjiè Gāozhēn)****
May swiftly return to the **Jade Gates (Yáo què)**;
And below, that the **ranked Saints of the mortal world (Lièshèng)****
May once more ascend to the **Palaces of the True Spirits (Xiān cáochú)**.

May the **radiant light (liúguāng)**** return to our ritual hall,
And all our **sincere supplications (sùyuàn)**** be answered.

The humble petitioner and the **officiants of the Daoist ritual (jiào)**,
With no words to express our deepest gratitude—
In truth, trembling and fearful,
We **kneel and prostrate ourselves (qǐshǒu dùnshǒu)**,
Twice bowing to offer the **True Saints (Zhēnshèng)**.

**We present twelve vows (shíèr yuàn)**.
**We present the invocation to preserve the spirit and burn incense (cúnshén shāoxiāng)**.
The **High Functionary (Gāo Gōng)**** restores the furnace.
The **Incense Officials and Messengers (Xiāng Guān Shǐzhě)**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials (zuǒyòu Lónghǔ Jūn)**,
And the **attendant spirits (shìxiāng zhūléng guān)**—
May they now command that the places where we formerly **established the Daoist ritual (shèjiào)** and **ascended the platform (shēngtán)****,
Naturally produce **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade (Jīnyè Dānbì)**,
**Mushroom and herb spirits (Zhīyīng bǎilíng)**,
And that all **True Spirits (Zhōngzhēn)**** may gather here before this incense furnace.

May we vow that the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens (Shífāng Xiān tóng Yùnǚ)****
Will attend to the **fragrant mists (lán yān)**,
And swiftly convey our **sincere petitions (chéng)****
To the **Great Dao of the Supreme Lord (Wújí Dàdào)**,
The **Three Pure Ones (Sān Qīng)**,
The **Highest Saints (Shàngshèng)**,
And the **Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Lord (Hàotiān Yùhuáng Dìshì)**—
Before the **Supreme Lord’s august presence (Zhìzhēn Wújí Dàdào)**.

**We present the eulogy as we depart the hall (chūtáng sòng)**.
**We exit the hall and lead to the Six Canopied Pavilion (Liúmù Táng)**.

The humble servant hears that the transformations of the Most High God must be measured by those who follow the Dao in their deeds, and the gates of all wonders must be sought by those who grasp the mysteries of wondrous things. In silent exploration of the ever-renewing principle, and in secret mastery of the ceaseless functions, all things flow in form, spanning heaven and coiling earth. Only the august Sovereigns of the Three Realms and the ranked Saints of the Ten Directions are vast beyond the rivers and seas, lofty beyond the mountains and peaks—yet their blessings endure through the unbroken lineage of their descendants, and their virtue is revered by all virtuous folk.

The **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name] of modest virtue, though unaware of his own merit, has accumulated good deeds that now shine forth. At the outset, he sought the harmony of his descendants; at the end, he prayed that this son might be forever preserved. Together, they align their forms with the Nine Qi and share their fate with the Three Primordials. The **Born Gods** respond in reverence as they do in song, and the **Minister of Fate** obeys with respect as he does with deference. They examine the month of birth and expand the functions of life, harmonizing the Six Qi at the Great Balance and opening the Eight Desolations into the Domain of Longevity. Thus may they attain enduring blessings and maintain a solemn, reverent heart.

In accordance with the Daoist rites, I now invoke the True Vehicles, praying for the prosperity of my descendants from the Sacred Axis and offering sincere devotion to the Jade Void. As the first wishes are uttered and the grand rites commence, I give thanks to Heaven and Earth for their creative grace and pray for the longevity and prosperity of my descendants. The humble servants, with utmost reverence, prostrate themselves twice and present incense. Pure tea is offered in tribute. Flowers are scattered.

With sincere hearts, we now address the **Natural Three Pure Ones of the Void**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, and the ranked Saints of the Three Realms and Ten Directions.

The humble servant hears that the **Work of Transformation** secretly moves within the floating, dreamlike realms of the **Dharma Realm**, while the **Great Dao** remains hidden yet reveals its virtue of nurturing life. It divides the Three Talents to establish order and distributes the Nine Qi to form all things. All people under heaven are born through the nurturing of their parents, yet their essence connects to the **Jade Purity**, and their spirits are transformed by the **Primordial Origin** as it sows its essence and moves its spirit, universally delivering all beings.

Thus, reflecting inward, one finds that one’s fate is decreed by Heaven. Since the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], took his wife, no child has been born. Fearful of failing to uphold the ancestral rites and grieving that the line of sacrifice may not continue, he now humbly appeals to the High Saints, guiding and welcoming their blessings. With sincere devotion, he follows the ritual precepts and invokes the sacred altar.

Now, as incense is burned, I turn my body, my spirit, and my fate toward the **Boundless Dao of the Ten Directions**, wishing to dedicate these merits to all beings, seen and unseen. May the Three Realms shine their light, and all spirits guard and protect. May they perceive this sincere red heart and illuminate it, and may the winds of the **Celestial Chariot** descend to attend. May my petition be inscribed in the Imperial heart, and may my descendants flourish eternally. The divine response shall be conveyed to the **Supreme True Boundless Dao** on high.

**Chanting the Square**, **Repentance**, **Three Invocations**, **Three Offerings**. The **True Scriptures** are proclaimed. The **Law Positions** are solemnly repeated. The humble servants, [Name] and the assembled officials of the altar, with sincere hearts, now address:

The **Supreme Boundless Dao**, the **Sovereigns of the Three Realms**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Hook-and-Line**, the **Great Sovereign Emperor of the Purple Forbidden Enclosure and Northern Pole**, the **Earthly Sovereign Empress Who Follows Heaven’s Law**, the **Nine Sovereign Emperors of the Divine Constellations**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors**, the **Celestial Sovereign Emperors of All Realms**, and all **True Spirits** who respond to invocation.

The humble servant hears that in the **Primordial Ancestral Eon**, the **Origin** gave birth to all heavens; when the **Two Complements** emerged from the womb, the vast oceans and lands were established. The seven orifices were carved from **Chaos**, and the five sacred marks were planted by the **Divine**. When the winds return, they fan the **Azure Palace** with empty song; when the mists gather, they pierce the **Purple Void** with lush brilliance. Distinguishing life and classifying beings, they open the way for all things and fulfill their functions; observing footsteps and omens, they reveal the lessons of blessing the virtuous and punishing the licentious. All transformations of things dare not ignore this heartfelt devotion.

The **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has cultivated the cause of countless eons and the Daoic nourishment of the Three Primordials. Reflecting on the aged without children—called "lonely"—he laments the plight of the common folk, yet knows that Heaven’s greatest virtue is to give life. Thus, he follows the ancient teachings and devotes himself to incense and offerings, humbly beseeching mercy.

Though unworthy, the humble servants have been entrusted with this ritual office and now reverently perform the **Taoist Rites**. To preserve the living and restore the extinct is to rely upon Heaven’s might; to benefit all beings and nurture life is to spread the Dao’s transformations. With sincere hearts, we dare not fail to report this, and with true devotion, we now proclaim our petition.

The words are examined in detail, and the utmost sincerity is revealed. We humbly pray for Heaven’s attentive ear and its gracious, far-reaching blessings. We consider the officials of the Nine Heavens and the ministers of the Three Realms—those who record crimes and deeds, who always present their petitions in order. Both seen and unseen shall rely upon this, with nothing great or small omitted.

Now, the **Taoist Official of the Ritual Hall**, [Name], has purified his spirit and devoutly observed the fasts, modeling himself after Heaven and Earth. He has erected the star altar, offered water and flowers, and taken refuge in the Dao’s treasures. He recites the **Sacred Chapters** at noon and in the pure night, presenting cloud-inscriptions to the heavens. The **Upper Saints** descend, and our highest wishes are extended. Incense is burned to demonstrate sincerity, spread throughout the Ten Directions; lamps are lit to continue their glow, illuminating the Nine Nights.

In accordance with the fast’s precepts, we now host the invocation and report it to the **Supreme Three Honored Ones**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Great True Master of the Mysterious**, the **Supervising Master of the Fast**, the **Most Sacred Treasures of the Lingbao**, and the officials of the Three Realms. May they descend to inspect and review what has been presented.

We pray that the **Attendant Spirits of the Scripture**, the **Supervising Officials of the Ministry of Punishments**, and the **True Officials of the Lands and Districts** may cooperate in heart and strength, encircling and guarding, sweeping away external forces, purifying the altar, subduing demons and spirits, and annihilating malevolent influences. Thus may we attain peace of mind and stillness of spirit, with divine responses clearly communicated. When the rites are complete, we shall continue to report, and the fast shall be fulfilled without obstruction.

On the following morning, the Dao will be enacted, and further reports shall be made. This is now declared.

**The Twelve Vows** are recited. The incense burner is relit. The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirits of the Incense** shall now cause the place where the humble servant has invoked the Dao to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green herbs**, **hundreds of sacred plants**, and the gathering of all True Ones before this incense burner.

The **Twelve Vows** are fulfilled. The incense burner is reignited.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon and Tiger Lords**, and the **Attending Spirits of the Incense** shall now cause the place where the humble servant has invoked the Dao to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green herbs**, **hundreds of sacred plants**, and the gathering of all True Ones before this incense burner.

---

On this morning of purity, the Dao is enacted as prescribed. The rites are performed in full. The **Incense Officials and Messengers** solemnly offer their obeisance to the Master, invoking his presence as per the Dao.

The **Vigilant Spirit Incantations** are proclaimed: the **Green Yang Illumination** shines forth, its radiance returning the sun’s essence. The **Divine Tiger Repels Evil**, its celestial bells tolling as it soars. The **Subduing of Deceit and Annihilation of Trials** binds all ten thousand demons in form. The **Nine Mysteries Revert to the Dao**, the **Eight Wonders Subdue Spirits**. The **Thousand True Ones** inspect and verify, the **Three Elements** disperse impurities. The **Left Whistle** summons the **Central Yellow**, the **Right Drum** commands the **Six Ding**.

Through **Seven Rotations and Eight Harmonies**, they circle the **Celestial Scriptures**. The **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic, the **Great Dao** now unfolding. The **Auspicious Clouds** flow and spread, merging with the **Yellow Court of Illumination**, their essence blending with the **True Dao of the Way**.

The **Supreme Law Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

The **Three Sovereigns of the Highest Heaven**—**Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Three Essences**, **Supreme Daoist Lord**, and **Supreme Old Lord**—now summon from within the humble servant’s body:
- the **Three Five Officials of Destiny**,
- the **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**,
- the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**,
- the **Postal Dragon and Mounted Officials**,
- the **Golden Boys Attending the Incense**,
- the **Jade Girls of Transmission and Scattering Flowers**,
- the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,
- the **Direct Incense Officials of the Sun**,
each in groups of **thirty-six**.

Those who emerge are clad in **splendid robes and official attire**, their **headgear and ribbons** trailing in reverence. They open the **Mysterious Daoist Altars** to the **Local Deities and Territorial Spirits**, and to the **Divine Ones of the Realm**.

Now, on this morning of purity, as the humble servant invokes the Dao, we earnestly pray that the **Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions**, the **Numinous Treasure of Illuminating Light**, may descend and flow into the servant’s body, ensuring that all supplications are swiftly conveyed to the **Supreme Dao of the Highest Heaven** and the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Clarity**.

We request the **Proclamation of the Daoist Stations**.

We, the humble servants, hear that there exists a **Substance of Chaos**, which gave rise to the **manifested** before **Heaven and Earth**; and that there is a **Void of Independence**, which transcends even **Yin and Yang**.

---

Though it may be recorded without seeing its form,
And though its name be unknown, it is called **Dao**.

Thus, the **Yang** abides in **Great Xia**,
Nurturing and fostering all things as its duty.
The **Heavenly Ancestor** encompasses all beings,
And embraces and covers all without distinction.

All things, great and small, are entirely entrusted to its cultivation.
Without words, it is understood;
The four seasons proceed, and all things are born.
No malevolent *qi* can prevail—
The five grains ripen, and the myriad people flourish.
The **transformative work** depends upon it,
And blessings are bestowed in due measure.

The **Temple Official** [Name], having long cultivated virtuous roots,
Has now heard the **True Dao**.
Reflecting upon himself and acknowledging faults,
How dare he not reverently fear the **Celestial Above**,
And observe the precepts while fasting in devotion,
Hoping to appease the **Childless**,
That I, the humble servant, may present this plea,
And seek the **Sage’s return and reliance**,
With sincere words at dawn,
Dutifully declaring my intent.

**Proclamation of Words:**
As stated in the petition, the sincerity is profound and earnest.
With reverence, I await the **Celestial’s gracious hearing**,
And humbly beg for **merciful indulgence**.
I pray for the **greatest of blessings**,
That my **long-lasting prayers** may be granted.

I have heard that the *Yijing* speaks of the **Great Ultimate**,
From which the **Two Principles** arise.
Great is the **Primordial of Heaven**,
The origin of all things.
All who dwell beneath Heaven and tread upon Earth
Naturally balance **Yin and Yang**.
Those who receive the **Great Dao** attain a nature of **Purity and Harmony**;
Those who receive but little manifest as **soaring and crawling creatures**.
Thus, no thing fails to be nourished by **dew and rain**,
And all sentient beings emerge from **molding and refining**.

All who rely upon this **transformative birth**—
How dare we forget to return and align with it?
Though the **sunflower’s heart** be distant,
Its sincerity still turns toward the **Sun**;
Though the **otter’s sacrifice** be humble,
It still performs rites to **Heaven**.
How much more so for those in **humanity’s path**,
Residing in this **transitional age**—
With offerings and prayers,
We must be **precise and singular** in devotion.

The **Temple Official** [Name], in fasting and ceremonial attire,
Choosing this auspicious day,
Reverently obeys the **Celestial Above**,
And solemnly serves the **Most High Emperor**.
Hoping the **hundred spirits** will come to witness,
I pray that **one prayer may yield a son**,
Fulfilling my supplication,
And glorifying the **transformative power**.

With this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **first incense offering**.
May this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,
And offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Dao Treasures of the Ten Directions**.

We, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
Prostrate ourselves in devotion,
And dedicate the merit of this incense offering
To bless the **Current Emperor of China**.
May he and his **descendants for a hundred generations** live **ten thousand years**,
With **royal lineage secure** and **Heaven’s decree fulfilled**.
Following **Jiang Yuan’s** footsteps in **military virtue**,
Nurturing the people as **Di Xin** did;
Exceeding **Di Jian’s** prayers to Heaven,
And receiving the **auspicious phoenix**.
Enhancing the **prosperity of the ancestral halls**,
And fulfilling the **blessings of longevity**,
May this grace extend to the **Temple Official**,
And flow to his **future descendants**.

Thus, the **ancestral halls** shall flourish like **sage and bamboo**;
**Sincerity in harmony with Heaven** shall bring **auspicious cranes and harmonious offspring**.
Now, with this incense offering,
We **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Dao’s Most True Assembly**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we shall **preserve Heaven’s eternal life**,
And merge in **harmony with the True Way**.

With this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **second incense offering**.
May this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,
And offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Scriptural Treasures of the Ten Directions**.

We, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
Prostrate ourselves in devotion,
And dedicate the merit of this incense offering
To the **Spirits of the State and Ancestral Temples, the Revered and Sacred Forefathers**.

May the **clan and ancestral halls** be **cared for with compassion**,
And the **ancestral temples** maintained in **solemn reverence**.
Though the **ancestors above** may be distant,
Their blessings extend as **nine autumns of longevity**;
The **glory of the lineage** shall align with **Heaven’s decree**,
And **match the Emperor’s virtue without partiality**.
Descending to the **Temple Official**,
May **ancestral grace** be bestowed upon his **forebears**,
And may he **joyfully ascend to the Imperial Abode**,
His praises **resounding in the Celestial Court**;
His **sorrowful incense** shall **shine in the divine *qi***,
And his **humble offerings** shall **bring blessings to the living**.

Now, with this incense offering,
We **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Scriptural Treasures’ Most True Assembly**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we shall **preserve eternal life**,
And merge in **harmony with the True Way**.

With this **dawn ritual**, I request the **assembly of the Law** to perform the **third incense offering**.
May this **incense cloud** ascend to the heavens,
And offer homage to the **Supreme and Most True Master Treasures of the Ten Directions**.

We, the servants, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
Prostrate ourselves in devotion,
And dedicate the merit of this incense offering
To **all distant and near, encompassing the dim and the luminous**.

May the **three luminaries** move in **harmonious order**,
And the **four seas** unite in **civilization**;
May **floods and droughts** be forever **dissipated**,
And **wars and punishments** **cease**.
Let there be **five days of wind and ten days of rain**,
Without fear of **broken branches or shattered earth**;
Let there be **ten thousand granaries and ten thousand chests**,
With **ease in tilling and reaping**.
May **one household’s blessings** extend to **all under Heaven**,
And all **share in the happiness of Hua Xu**,
Ascending to the **Mystic and Wondrous**.

Even the **calf of the plow-ox** shall bear **fine horns and multiply**;
The **old clam** shall **radiate brilliance**, its **pearls fully formed**.
Grace shall be **equally bestowed upon all living things**,
Each fulfilling its **natural destiny**.

Now, with this incense offering,
We **return in reliance to the Great Saints of the Master Treasures’ Most True Assembly**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we shall **permanently prosper and flourish**,
And merge in **harmony with the True Way**.

**Chant the Square**, **Confess the Square**, **Three Invocations**, **Three Rites**.
Reaffirm the **Law’s station**.
The **officiating servants** [Names],
With **sincere hearts**, now **humbly present our petition** to:
The **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,
The **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms**,
The **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,
The **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,
And **all True Spirits**.

I have heard that when **disaster strikes**, one should **fear and reflect**,
And **great virtue** shall **descend in guidance**.
Seeing **goodness**, one must **follow its path**,
As the **Teachings of Righteousness** instruct.
**Heaven is supreme**—
**Repentance must come first**.
When **sacrificial rains return** and **winds reverse**,
**Bright Virtue** is **manifested**.
When **Mars retreats**,
It **aligns with virtuous speech**.
Though it may lack **sound or scent to trace**,
Its response is **as certain as the echo of a hollow vessel**.

「Then how much more so for wicked men who fast and bathe in purification,
Yet still may **manifest reverence** before the **Supreme Emperor**;
For the **Noble Ones** who fear and reflect in **self-cultivation**,
May also **preside over sacrifices** as the eldest sons.

Not only do they transform calamity into auspicious fortune,
But they turn hearts back toward the **Dao/Way**.
This **Dao/Way** is the **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,
The **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms**,
The **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,
The **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,
And **all True Spirits**.

I, **a Daoist Official**, humbly reflect:
Since my **past lives** until this present birth,
My **mind-monkeys** have galloped wild,
My **heart-demons** have raged unrestrained,
Shaming **Heaven and Earth**,
Defaming **sages and teachers**,
Disobeying my **two parents**,
Severing ties with my **nine clans**.
I have **forgotten filial piety**, neglected rites—
Sometimes **not venerating** my **ancestors**;
Or **abandoning children**, **destroying fetuses**,
Long ago **inflicting harm** upon my own **kin**.

With **treacherous deceit**, I **offend superiors**,
Conceal the **virtuous**, harm the **able**,
Gleefully **corrupt** without restraint,
**Hoarding grain** while ignoring the people’s suffering.
If **profit** lies at the **tip of a needle**,
I **privately covet** **honor and wealth** in **land monopolies**;
I **rejoice in disaster**, **delight in others’ ruin**,
**Arbitrarily severing** the **sacrifices of rival sects**;
**Exploiting orphans**, **ravaging graves**,
**Cunningly expanding** my own **fields and gardens**.

I **lack compassion**—
My deeds are those of the **tyrant and oppressor**.

Or I **burn mountains**, **exhaust marshes**,
**Boil silkworms**, **overturn nests**,
**Wrongfully harming** **all living beings**,
Yet **unfulfilled** my **past karmic debts**,
**Bringing ruin upon myself**,
And thus **offending the Divine**.

Or as a **subject**, I **fail in loyalty**,
**Condemning men to death** under false pretenses.
I **exhaust the people**, **disturb the masses**,
Becoming the **chief of calamity** in an age;
I **hold office without merit**, **feasting idly**,
**Wasting Heaven’s work** among the **hundred officials**.
I **fell the sacred cows** of **Mount Niu**,
**Piercing the vast net** of **Heaven’s justice**.

All my actions—
**None know their limits**,
And if one **engages in such deeds**,
**None shall escape ruin**,
Leading to **licentious partners** in my home,
And **extinction of my lineage**,
**Lacking virtue and greatness**,
My **clan shall fall**.

These are the **precepts of the sages**,
And **Heaven’s will** is **dreadful indeed**.
Thus, I **preserve sincerity**, **purify myself**,
**Rectify my past**, **cultivate my future**,
With **vigilant devotion** all day long,
And **trepidation** in my smallest thoughts,
**Confessing my karmic sins**,
And **humbly beseeching mercy**.

I pray that the **vast and august Heaven**,
The **magnificent Sovereign Emperor**,
May **unleash the great virtue of life-giving**,
And **bestow boundless compassion**,
So that **all may renew their hearts**,
And **this humble clan** alone **may be spared**,
Its **lineage preserved**, its **rites upheld**.
**Nurturing and sustaining life**,
May we **raise noble offspring** like **lan and jade** in the courtyard;
**To inherit and continue**,
May we **learn the arts** of **archery and metallurgy**,
Like **Ji and You**—
So that the **Eight Dragons of the Xun Clan** may **not shame**,
Nor the **Three Phoenixes of Hedong** **be dishonored**,
And may we **receive Heaven’s favor**,
**Emulate the virtuous descendants** of the **Empress**.

My **earnest prayers** are **offered day and night**,
And **prolific blessings** depend **on moral cultivation**.
The **lonely one in Zhao** became a **feudal lord for ten generations**,
And the **meritorious in Liang** was a **prime minister for eight**;
Some **advised their rulers** and **earned descendants** like **Zang and Sun**,
Others **accumulated hidden virtue** and **were trusted** like **the Bing Clan**.

Though **publicly renowned** like **Zhang Tang and Yang Shen**,
Even if **one or two** were counted,
Though **a thousand or ten thousand** were named,
**None would be exhaustive**—
These are the **hundred auspicious signs** of **doing good**,
And **Heaven’s aid** comes **from a single virtue**.

If **one perseveres in difficulty** afterward,
**Dragged by past deeds**,
Yet **reviews ancient precedents**,
**Heaven’s warnings** remain clear.

The **Han Marquis** who **broke the law**—
His **clan perished** in **four or five generations**, leaving **no survivors**.
**Yu Xu** who **harbored many grudges**—
His **lineage died out** in **twenty years**, **not passing a single mouth**.

Some **schemed treacherously** and **overthrew their rulers**,
Others **plotted to destroy** the **Three Dynasties** and **ruin their clans**.
Even if **one receives the jade seal** and **falls into disgrace**,
**Evil retribution** shall **still be incurred**;
If **one marries first** and **buries their parents last**,
**How can auspicious fortune** be **guaranteed**?

Yet **Heaven’s condemnation** is **plainly evident**,
Even if **other virtues** exist, **none can redeem** it.
If **one sees their faults** and **reflects inwardly**,
They shall **return to righteousness**—
**No greater joy** than this.

I, **a humble petitioner**, dare **not defy Heaven’s might**,
But **submit to the creative transformation**,
And **pledge from this day forward**,
Until **future lives**,
To **rectify my errors** and **renew my heart**,
And thus **invite auspicious fortune** and **gather blessings**.

**Life and its beginnings** rely **on the interplay of Heaven and Earth**,
**Form and completion** owe **their debt to Heaven and Earth**.
**Early signs of good fortune** descend,
**To comfort all beneath**,
And **to reveal Heaven’s great mercy**,
While **below**, my **sincere submission** is **fulfilled**—
Thus, I **humbly present** this **petition**.

**Twelve Vows** are **restored**.
The **Incense Official and Messengers**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals**,
And the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**,
Shall **command** that at my **former sites of Daoist practice**,
**Golden elixir and emerald dew**,
**Mushrooms and herbs of all kinds**,
And **gathered True Spirits**,
May **naturally appear**, **converging** at this **incense burner**.
Then shall **my karmic sins be absolved**,
And **sources of blessings be expanded**.

With **devoted heart**, I **receive the Dao’s guidance**,
And **shall attain the auspicious sign** of **the fish and the tortoise**;
**Blessed by the Dao**, I **shall be born anew**,
And **earn the joy** of **holding jade and pearl**.
My **entire household** shall **be favored**,
And **all under Heaven** shall **share its glory**.

Next, I **vow** that **celestial children and jade maidens** from the **Ten Directions**,
Shall **attend the fragrant incense**,
And **convey my former petitions’ sincerity**,
Swiftly **reaching the presence** of the **Supreme and Limitless Dao**,
The **Jade Emperor of Heaven**,
And the **True Spirits of the Three Realms**.

**Hymns of praise** are **offered from the hall**,
**From the doorway**.

**The Compendium of Daoist Rituals and Precepts—Volume Twenty-Six Completed**

At noon, the **Dao** is practiced. The ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.

Each pays homage to the Master with sincere reverence, as the law directs.
The **Guardian Spirit’s** incantations are proclaimed.
**Dan qi** and **Jiuhuo** blaze forth—
Flames and winds surge, radiant and fierce.
The **Red Wheel** rolls with mighty force,
Its light piercing the **Eight Directions**.
Its **thundering power** envelops all,
Its **cyclic transformations** span the **Ten Thousand Worlds**.
**Liquid gold** cascades, **magical barriers** collapse—
All **demons and malevolent forces** vanish without trace.
**Evil spirits** and **fiends** are repelled,
The **radiant brilliance** of the **Primordial Work** shines forth.
**Golden talismans** summon and command—
**Cloud-striding officers** and **Dragon-taming scribes** appear.
**Hymns of joy** and **celebratory songs** resound,
**Flowers of praise** scatter across the **void**.
**Divine efficacy** runs smoothly,
The **Four Quarters** stand in tranquil splendor.

Humbly **submitting before the Celestial Sovereign**,
I **bow in reverence**, with **no trace of disrespect**,
And **harmonize** with the **Dao’s true essence**.

The **law-drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

The **Supreme Three Heavens’** *Xuan Yuan Shi* of the **Three Qi**,
The **Supreme Dao Lord** and **Supreme Old Lord**,
Are invoked to summon forth from my body the **Three Five Functionaries**,

Their **headdresses and sashes** adorned with trailing **ribbons**.
The **Mysterious Daoist Altars’** *Tudi* and **regional deities** are opened.

Now, at noon, I practice the **Dao**,
And **solemnly present** my **sincere petition**.
With **heartfelt devotion** and **unfaltering sincerity**,
My **vows** have already been **recorded and heard**.
I pray that the **Supreme Dao’s** *Qi* of the **Ten Directions**,
The **Sacred Treasure’s** *Gui Guang* radiance,
May **descend and flow** into my body,
So that my **petition** may **swiftly reach** the **Supreme Limitless Dao**,
And the **Jade Emperor of Heaven’s** *Huangdi* presence.

**Invoke the sacred titles** as prescribed.

I have heard:
**"No vessel is more precious than the eldest son**,
For he **bears the weight of lineage and transmission**.
**Heaven’s Dao** always **favors the virtuous**,
And **secrets of transformation** are **bestowed upon those who create harmony**."

「Though speechless, yet responsive with kindness,
Though silent, yet attuned to all sensations—
Since ancient spirits and gods,
Who rule as sovereigns over all things.
In times past, High Qí [高祺] sought thee with solemn reverence,
And the Emperor Yáo [尧], with many sons,
Also relied on Huàfēng’s [华封] invocation.
How much more so I, a humble mortal,
Dare I neglect to offer my devout surrender?
I now wholeheartedly pray,
Hoping the **Three Primordial** [三元] **Dao** may nurture me.

Revered be the **Nine Heavens**,
Where Kǒng Fǔ [孔父] prayed at Níqiū [尼丘],
And Shēn Fǔ [申甫] descended upon Sōngyùe [嵩岳].
Some are born from **Yuanjīng’s** [元精] fixed essence,
Others reserved in the **Mǎoxiù’s** [昴宿] celestial storehouse.
When **Yì Jiāng** [邑姜] dreamed of the Emperor,
She held a scripture in hand and called it **Yú** [虞].
When **Yān Gū** [燕姑] dreamed of the orchid,
She made **Shēn Yǔ** [申甫] proclaim himself **"Heaven’s Decree"** [称天] and bestow it upon her.
None can escape the **Dao’s** influence in **transformation** [造化],
Yet still achieve fulfillment in their **birth and growth** [生成].

I, the **Ritual Official** [醮官],
Humbly reflect:
My virtues are shallow, my deeds meager,
Guilt and misfortune have piled high.
I have strayed after profit, am filled with grievances,
And though **virtue’s dwelling** [仁宅] stands open, I do not reside there.
I have incurred Heaven’s wrath,
And now face the trials of my descendants.
I fear that one day I may perish before dawn’s dew,
Leaving my **Nine Springs Ancestral Domain** [九原] in shame before the **ancestral spirits** [先灵].
I behold only my fading shadow,
A fragile thread that may not break.
With age, I am dishonored in **Jiàng Xiàn’s** [绛县] muddy depths,
Like the **Ghost’s Weeping** [鬼哭] at **Ruò** [若敖],
I am near exhaustion in my search for sustenance.
Each day, I feel isolated and fearful,
And constantly tremble in prayer to Heaven.

Moreover, the **litigation of Yú’s Tomb** [虞冢讼] entangles me,
I beg for **Great Mercy** [洪恩] to universally deliver all.
Thus, I purify my dwelling,
And offer **sincere homage** [嘉诚] with utmost devotion.

We, Your **devoted servants** [臣等],
Have received the **Golden Precepts** [金科],
And partaken in the **Treasure Scrolls** [宝箓].
We pray for sons and descendants,
And our voices echo through the **examinations of life** [监生].
We seek **transformation into the Dao** [仙化] and human perfection,
And have heard the **supreme teachings** [上品] within the scriptures.

In accordance with our earnest sincerity,
We humbly petition to declare this.

Examine our words with care,
And witness our heartfelt devotion.
I have heard:
**"Unfiliality has three forms, but the gravest is having no descendants**,
And **"the Way of birth** [生道] is not singular—
It originates from the **Primordial Void** [虚]."

To emulate Heaven and Earth,
And align with the **Central Harmony** [中和] that nurtures all things,
I should first adhere within my own self,
So that I may resonate with the **spirits of all** [万灵].

With **incense offerings** [荐芯芬] and **devout prayers** [祈盻蠁],
I invoke the **Ninefold Celestial Hierarchy** [九重金格],
And deliver the **Sacred Dao’s** [灵宝] secret words.
At the **Threefold Jade Platforms** [三级瑶坛],
I summon the **multitudes of True Ones** [众真] to the **Pearl Hall** [珠馆].
The **Eightfold Cloud Seals** [八天云篆] of the heavens
Are set to pacify the **Nine Palaces** [九宫],
And the **Two Celestial Poles’** [两极] stars
Shine brightly, connecting the **Five Battlements** [五斗].

I pour forth my **sincere supplications** [丹悃],
And bow to the **Vermilion Scripture** [朱章],
Hoping through the **wonders of all spirits** [众妙],
To achieve the **blessing of many sons** [多男].

Now, at this **hour of the Ox** [临午],
As we follow the **Dao’s path** [行道],
We beseech the **Assembled Lawful Ones** [法众] to ignite this **first incense** [初捻],
May this **incense-cloud** [香云] ascend,
Piercing the heavens to offer homage,
To the **Supreme Dao-Treasures** [无上道宝] of the **Ten Directions** [十方],
The **Heavenly Sovereign** [天尊].

We, Your **devoted servants** [臣等],
Surrender our **bodies** [皈身], **spirits** [皈神], and **fates** [皈命],
Prostrate ourselves with heads to the ground,
And dedicate these **incense merits** [捻香功德]
To bless the **current Emperor** [当今皇帝] of **Vermilion Majesty** [陛下].

Humbly we wish:
For the **Celestial Sphere** [璇玑] to regulate in harmony,
And the **Tortoise and Tripod** [龟鼎] to bring **peaceful tranquility** [燕宁].
May all **disasters and omens** [灾异] cease to be recorded,
And **demonic influences** [妖氛] be forever dispelled.
May the **Dragon Palaces** [龙楼] and **Crane Forbiddances** [鹤禁]
Continue to radiate **august brilliance** [重明].
May the **Hall of Painted Portraits** [甲观画堂] be filled with **honeyed blessings** [含饴].
May the **Hundred Sons** [百子] harmonize their **prayers of prosperity** [协螽斯],
And the **Six Palaces** [六宫] sing the **poems of the wild millet** [歌芣苡],
So that all things may find their rightful place,
And none shall be deprived of their destiny.

Now, we burn this incense,
And surrender ourselves to the **Supreme Dao-Treasures** [无上道宝] of the **Great Holy Multitudes** [大圣众],
The **True Ones’** [至真] **virtue** [德].
After attaining the **Dao** [得道],
We shall **preserve Heaven’s longevity** [永天长存],
And achieve **harmony with the Dao** [和与道合].

Now, at this **hour of the Ox** [临午],
As we follow the **Dao’s path** [行道],
We beseech the **Assembled Lawful Ones** [法众] to ignite this **second incense** [二捻],
May this **incense-cloud** [香云] ascend,
Piercing the heavens to offer homage,
To the **Supreme Scripture-Treasures** [无上经宝] of the **Ten Directions** [十方],
The **Heavenly Sovereign** [天尊].

We, Your **devoted servants** [臣等],
Surrender our **bodies** [皈身], **spirits** [皈神], and **fates** [皈命],
Prostrate ourselves with heads to the ground,
And dedicate these **incense merits** [捻香功德]
To flow back to our **family’s ancestral line** [某家], spanning **nine generations and seven ancestors** [九世七先],
And to the **myriad descendants** [亿曾万祖].

Humbly we wish:
For **Heaven’s Mercy** [天慈] to forgive and pardon,
And for the **Dao’s Qi** [道气] to spread and flourish.
May we be **extracted from suffering** [拔苦] and **cleansed of offenses** [除愆],
And may all **grievances and disputes** [冤对] be resolved.
We summon the **Nine Abysses** [九幽] and the **curved springs** [泉曲],
And hasten to the **Vermilion Lingering Court** [朱陵], where **flaming trials** [流火] await.
May we receive the **flaming birth** [生方] and **roam freely in the Celestial Realm** [逍遥仙界],
Severing **evil roots** [恶根] and **cutting off their destruction** [断灭],
So that our **fetal destiny** [胎注] may be **relieved and absolved** [蠲除].
Thus, we may avoid **untimely death** [夭横],
And forever preserve the **blessing of continuous prosperity** [绵长].

Now, we burn this incense,
And surrender ourselves to the **Supreme Scripture-Treasures** [无上经宝] of the **Great Holy Multitudes** [大圣众],
The **True Ones’** [至真] **virtue** [德].
After attaining the **Dao** [得道],
We shall **preserve Heaven’s longevity** [永天长存],
And achieve **true harmony with the Dao** [和与道合真].

Now, at this **hour of the Ox** [临午],
As we follow the **Dao’s path** [行道],
We beseech the **Assembled Lawful Ones** [法众] to ignite this **third incense** [三捻],
May this **incense-cloud** [香云] ascend,
Piercing the heavens to offer homage,
To the **Supreme Teacher-Treasures** [无上师宝] of the **Ten Directions** [十方],
The **Heavenly Sovereign** [天尊].

We, Your **devoted servants** [臣等],
Surrender our **bodies** [皈身], **spirits** [皈神], and **fates** [皈命],
Prostrate ourselves with heads to the ground,
And dedicate these **incense merits** [捻香功德]
To flow back to our **family’s ancestral line** [某家], seeking **longevity and virtue** [寿德齐明],
And **clarity of soul** [魂神澄正].

May we **bind the Heavenly and Earthly Qi** [氤氲],
And **channel it through the Hundred Passages** [百关].
May we **inherit the virtues of Yin and Yang** [禀阴阳],
And **resonate with the Eight Auspicious Signs** [冥符八景].
May our **children be born upright** [婴端就],
And **sleep peacefully without fear** [寝息无惊].
May those who **receive the blessings** [肯获] of this
Be **bestowed with abundant fortune** [流以有余].
With **mulberry bows and rush arrows** [桑弧蓬矢],
We shall **undertake matters in the Four Quarters** [四方],
And with **swan necks and tiger heads** [燕颔虎头],
Some may be **enfeoffed as marquises** [封侯] in **ten thousand leagues** [万里].
May **mercy permeate the Nine Realms** [九有],
And **blessings extend to all living beings** [含生].

Now, we burn this incense,
And surrender ourselves to the **Supreme Teacher-Treasures** [无上师宝] of the **Great Holy Multitudes** [大圣众],
The **True Ones’** [至真] **virtue** [德].
After attaining the **Dao** [得道],
We shall **forever enjoy benefits** [永保利享],
And achieve **true harmony with the Dao** [和与道合真].

**Chant the Four Quarters** [唱方],
**Repent the Four Quarters** [忏方],
**Command the Demons** [命魔],
Three **invocations** [三启], three **bowings** [三礼].
We **reaffirm the Lawful Positions** [重称法位].

We, Your **servants of fixed rank** [具位臣某等],
With utmost sincerity, **declare our petitions** [上启],
To the **Golden Gate of the Void** [金阙虚无],
The **Three Treasures of Heaven** [三宝天尊],
The **Supreme Celestial Jade Emperor** [昊天至尊玉皇上帝],
The **Great Sovereign of the Gōuqín Star Palace** [勾陈星宫天皇大帝],
The **Grand Star Lord of the Central Heaven** [中天星主紫微大帝],
The **Earthly Sovereign, Hòutǔ** [后土皇地祇], who **receives Heaven’s mandate** [承天效法],
The **True King of the Divine Dawn** [神霄真王长生大帝],
The **Heavenly Sovereigns of All Realms** [诸天天尊],
The **Heavenly Emperors of All Realms** [诸天天帝],
The **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits** [三界应感],
And **all True Spirits** [一切真灵].

I have heard:
**"The vast Nine Realms** [九有] are boundless,
For when the **form and substance** [形质] are divided..."

「**The teeming vitality of all living beings** [含生蠢蠢] is profound and boundless.
Though the **worldly realms of existence and nonexistence** [世间有有无有] may vary,
All remain **obscured in the beginning and end** [暗昧於始终].
Yet the **single breath of eternal generation** [一气生生] truly **emanates from Water and Fire’s primordial unity** [实全繄於水火].

If **bestowed with form within the cosmos** [赋形於宇内],
All **entrust their transformation to the Daoist domain** [总托化於仙乡].
Only the **Six Stars of the Southern Dipper** [南斗六虚] govern
And the **Central Heaven’s celestial capital** [太微之都紏].
They oversee the **Two Celestial Provinces of Heaven’s Pivot and Daoist Mechanism** [领天枢天机之二省],
And the **Heavenly Registrars of Fate and Records** [有司命司录之尊神].

To **prolong life and enhance numerology** [延寿益算],
One must **cross the calamities under the Long-Life Lord** [度厄於长生大君].
To **revive the dead and restore skeletal integrity** [起死回骸],
One must **submit to the Heavenly Registrar, Lord Hàn** [主录於韩君司马].

All **manifest the virtues of created beings** [咸彰品物],
Known as the **Upper Palace of the Southern March** [号南昌之上宫];
They **rescue from the Three Trials** [济拔三涂],
And **establish the Fire Bureau of Zhūlíng** [置朱陵之火府].

If one **ascends beyond the mortal realm into the yin domain** [超离於阴境],
One must **first bathe in the Heavenly Pool** [先沐浴於天池].
There, one **hears the hidden speech of the Eight Heavens** [闻八天隐语之音],
And **receives the Daoist breath of the Three Caverns** [接三洞飞玄之气].

The **jade pupils refine essence** [玉眸炼质],
And the **yellow blossoms dissolve form** [黄华荡形],
Thus **returning to the human cycle twice** [再返人寰],
Each **restoring their innate nature and vital essence** [各正性命].

Yet, **considering the worldly beings’ sins and blessings** [念世人罪福],
All are **fully known by the Heavenly Registrars** [尽达天司].
With the **crimson brush’s precise judgment** [丹笔善分],
They **are categorized into ranks without bias** [列为等级].
Once **distinctions by lineage are made** [姓类既别],
Not even a **hair’s breadth is overlooked** [毫发无私].

For those whose **conduct aligns with the Eight Hundred Daoist Precepts** [行齐八百者],
They **attain fruition and ascend to Truehood** [即证果以登真].
For those whose **offenses belong to the Three Thousand Karmic Debts** [刑属三千者],
Their **merits are weighed to compensate for past sins** [乃计功而补过].
The **Three Officials strike their registers** [三官鼓笔],
Ever **distinguishing individuals by their fate** [常料别於种人];
The **Ten Thousand Saints supervise the Daoists** [万圣督仙],
**Without interruption day or night** [实无间於昼夜].
All **proceed in orderly sequence** [皆有条而不紊],
Thus **responding harmoniously in every direction** [故善应以无方].

**Supreme is this Vermilion Heaven** [唯此丹天],
Whose **merits surpass the Purple Extremity** [功高紫极].
All who **proliferate under the Dao’s influence** [繁道荫],
Their **names inscribed in the Heavenly Registers** [注上生名],
Are **retrospectively traced to their three-lifetime karmic causes** [逆推三世之业因],
To **determine their fate’s rank in this life** [以计定一生之禄等].
The **Jade Calendar marks their birth month** [玉历考诞弥之月],
And the **Auspicious Clouds open the gates of Heaven’s nurturing** [庆云开化育之门].

Thus, **the souls fully refined** [全受炼之魂]
Are **assigned to their new rebirths** [即注更生之所].
Some **take root in humble, impoverished wombs** [寄胞於贫寒之所],
Others **are formed in households of accumulated virtue** [或赋形於积善之家].
With **precise calculations and thorough scrutiny** [考算毫分],
They **search out every human disposition** [搜罗人品].

For **thousands of generations of parents** [千生父母],
There are **preordained causes of benevolence** [有夙世之良因];
For **millions of eons of descendants** [万劫子孙],
They are **also gatherings of the Three Affinities** [亦三缘之和会].
Shared karmic causes **bind them into one family** [共业所感，聚为一家].

Then, the **Nine Breaths harmonize** [九炁齐并],
And the **Two Principles unify** [二仪同化].
The **Celestial Lords decree their fates** [帝君品命],
And the **Heavenly Mothers uphold the cosmic order** [圣母履纲].

The **Dao bestows their appearance** [道与之貌],
And **Heaven grants their form** [天与之形].
The **yang essence becomes their spirit** [阳为之魂],
And the **yin essence their soul** [阴为之魄].
The **four limbs and five bodies** [四肢五体]
Are **each fully formed in their physical and spiritual nature** [各整具於形神];
The **Six Stars and Three Elements** [六甲三元]
**All support and sustain their prenatal vitality** [悉扶承於胎命].

Again, **thousands align and ten thousand coalesce** [千和而万合],
Reaching **ten months and nine cycles** [至十月以九周].
Only the **Heavenly Registrar of the Nine Heavens** [九天司马]
Does **not descend to the Fate Charts** [不下於命章];
Yet **all ten thousand types of life take root** [万品生根],
And **none surpass the mysteries of their divine origins** [莫彰於神奥].

**Great indeed is this—**
Awe-inspiring to Heaven and Earth,
Its **nobility is hard to bear** [贵亦难胜].
It **refines souls and molds spirits** [陶魄铸魂],
In **divine subtleties beyond measure** [神灵微妙].

**Your humble servant** [斋官某],
**Reflecting on the fading path of life** [念日暮途远],
And the **waning lineage of the world** [嗣绪世微],
Shames the **decline of our ancestral gates** [耻门户之雕零],
And **seeks the source of life’s origin** [究生源之本始].
Having **purified this sacred space** [载严净宇],
And **yearning for the Supreme Truehood** [遐企上真],
I **hope to convey sincere devotion** [庶通蠲洁之诚],
To **reach the lineage of Auspicious Prosperity** [以格蕃昌之裔].

**With deepest reverence, I pray:**
That the **Heavenly Mother of the Nine Heavens** [九天圣母]
**Descends upon the Cloud-Carriage** [浮驾云轮],
And the **Eight-Directional Fetal Deities** [八方胎神]
**Each lead their respective officials** [各领官属].
May they **dispense the breath of Supreme Truth** [流布至真之气],
And **irrigate the gates of prenatal life** [灌溉胞命之门].
May the **Fetal Essence be knotted in the Yellow Chamber** [胎元结於黄房],
And the **Auspicious Smoke seal the doors of mortality** [祥烟塞於死户].

At the **auspicious month and favorable day** [时贵月吉],
When the **Three Realms gather in unison** [拥三界以齐临],
And **form and spirit are complete** [形具神全],
May they **preserve the Ten Thousand Spirits in celebration** [保万灵而称庆].
I **trust in Heaven’s blessings** [允获自天之佑],
And **lean upon the benevolent grace of the Celestial Deities** [旁依锡类之仁].

Thus, **my descendants and their descendants** [乃子乃孙],
May **build halls and construct ancestral temples** [肯堂肯构],
**Honoring the Heavenly Emperor’s vast mercy** [上明天尊大慈之泽],
And **fulfilling our sincere submission to fate** [下副臣等皈命之诚].
**Respectfully declared and submitted** [谨启以闻].
**Twelve Petitions** [十二愿].
**Reignite the Incense Altar** [复炉].
**Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and Attendant Spirits of Fragrant Incense** [香官使者、左右龙虎君、侍香诸灵官],
May **command my humble servant to ascend to the Daoist practice at the meridian hour** [当令臣向来临午行道之所],
Where **golden nectar and crimson elixir naturally form** [自然生金液丹碧],
And **mushroom sprouts and myriad sacred herbs flourish** [芝英百灵].
May **all True Spirits gather here before this incense altar** [众真交会],
And **my sincere petitions be swiftly conveyed** [在此香火炉前].

**My first prayer is:**
That **my devotion reaches Heaven** [当愿忱诚上达],
And **divine grace flows to all sides** [睿泽旁流].
May **my past transgressions be forgiven** [赦已往之愆尤],
And **the path to self-renewal be opened** [开自新之轨路].
May the **Nine Mysteries and Seven Ancestors** [九玄七祖]
**Release me from karmic disputes and elevate my form** [释注讼以升形];
And may the **Six Stars and Three Elements** [六甲三元]
**Protect the prenatal Truehood and solidify my foundation** [保胎真而固本].

Thus, **I may attain a peaceful and fragrant child** [庶获宁馨之子],
And **lead them to the Daoist realm of Ren’s longevity** [率归仁寿之乡].

**My second prayer is:**
That **the Ten Thousand Daoist Immortals and Jade Maidens** [十方仙童玉女]
**Attend to the fragrant incense** [接侍兰烟],
And **transmit my humble petitions** [传臣向来所启之诚]
**Swiftly to the Supreme Court of the Jade Emperor, the Highest Dao** [速达径御太上无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].

**With reverence, I depart the Hall** [出堂颂].
**With reverence, I exit the Gate** [出户].

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Code, Volume Twenty-Eight: The Great Ritual for Seeking Descendants**

**Evening Dao Practice**

Proceed with the ritual rites as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao.

**Invoke the Sacred Protective Incantations.**
The Five Stars shine resplendent, auspicious *qi* ascends in flight.
The Primordial Sovereign gathers the spirits—heaven and earth unite in harmony.
The Jade Talismans and Sacred Nodes command with celestial might;
Their summons pierces the depths of the unseen.
Fires are cast, their might proclaimed—evil and malevolence are banished.
Ten thousand demons are subdued, their chaotic forms dispersed.
Monstrous and wicked forces are crushed, the Dao’s *qi* flows universally.
Divine radiance illuminates the night, all obscurity vanishes.
Ten thousand spirits descend in order, their blessings sweep across the land like a breeze,
And all living beings prosper, grace permeating the sacred land—harmony with the Dao, truth perfected.

**Strike the sacred drum twenty-four times.**

The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Sovereign of the Three *Qi*,
The Most High Dao Sovereign,
The Most High Laozi,
**summon forth from my body the Three Five Officials of Merit,**
the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers,
the Post-Station Dragon Riders, the Incense-Serving Golden Boys,
the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
the Five Emperors’ Direct Talisman-Bearers,
the Direct-Day Incense Officials—
each thirty-six in number—**to emerge.**

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
their headgear adorned with trailing streamers.
They open the Daoist altar’s gates, invoking the local deities and territorial spirits.

**Now, in this quiet night of Dao practice, I humbly present my sincerest petition.**
My deepest aspirations have been recorded and heard.
I pray that the Most High’s Ten Directions’ **True Dao *qi* and Sacred Treasures of Auspicious Light descend,**
flowing into my body,
so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Supreme Court of the True, Limitless Dao,**
before the **Celestial Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Highest Heaven.**

**Now, proclaim the ritual rank.**

**I, [Name], of [Rank], together with the assembled officials at the altar,**
**with utmost sincerity, petition:**

The **Emperor of Natural Primordial Heaven, Sovereign of the Jade Dawn Dao’s Sacred Treasures,**
the **Teacher of Ten Thousands, Sovereign of Virtue and Dao,**
the **Celestial Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Highest Heaven,**
the **Starry Enchen Emperor of the Starry Enchen Palace,**
the **Purple Forbidden Star Sovereign, Great Emperor of the Northern Dipper,**
the **Earthly Sovereign, who follows Heaven’s model,**
the **True King of Divine Retreat, Great Emperor of Eternal Life,**
the **Great Emperor of Verdant Splendor, who registers life at the Eastern Pole,**
the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign of Auspicious Voice, Universal Transformation,**
the **Nine-Heaven Thunder Sovereign, Great Emperor,**
the **Great Sovereign of the Purple Forbidden, Spotted Jade Palace, the One Supreme Heavenly Emperor,**
the **Six-Heaven Cavern Sovereign, Great Emperor of the Six Waves,**
the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign of Benevolent Birth, the Revered Elder of the Nine-Heavens,**
the **Nine-Heaven Sovereign of Inspection and Auspicious Transformation,**
the **Nine-Heaven Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Five Elderly Emperors,**
the **Dao Sovereign of Eastern Hua, the Golden Mother of Western Spirit,**
the **Emperor of the Sun Palace, the Sovereign of the Moon’s Domain,**
the **Five Directional Star Sovereigns of the Five Virtues,**
the **Twenty-Eight Constellation Star Sovereigns,**
the **Seven Celestial Worthies of the Northern Dipper, Supreme Daoist Sovereigns,**
the **Six Celestial Worthies of the Southern Dipper, Supreme Sovereigns of Birth,**
the **Five Blessings and Ten Gods, the One Supreme True Sovereign,**
the **Four Residuals and Four Luminaries of the Upper Clarity,**
the **Divine Officials of the Celestial Tribunals,**
the **Three Celestial Sovereigns of the Three Offices,**
the **Three Celestial Sovereigns of the Three Provinces,**
the **Word-Submitting Spirit Official,**
the **Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks,**
the **Daoist Officials of the Cavernous Palaces and Auspicious Abodes,**
the **Primordial True Teacher of Our Domain, the Revered Worthies,**
the **Worthy Ones of Scriptures and Transmissions,**
the **Great Emperor of the Northern Netherworld,**
the **Great Emperor of the Vermilion Phoenix and the Dan Forest,**
the **Dragon Kings of the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Five Lakes, and Four Oceans,**
the **True Sovereigns of Mountains and Great Waters,**
the **Two Worthies of Golden and Jade Celestial Gates,**
the **Mighty Sacred Hosts of Wind, Cloud, Thunder, and Rain,**
and **all spirits of city gods, village shrines, and ancestral halls.**

**I have heard that in the Azure Heaven’s floating mists,**
one receives the **Six Jia’s prenatal protection;**
and in the **Purple Yang’s Jade Registers,**
the **Nine-Heaven’s chapter of divine birth is opened.**

All are the **hidden harmonies of the hundred spirits** and the **congealed qi of the Three Caverns’ soaring mysteries**.

When recited **eight times**, women conceive and beasts bear young;
When read **nine times**, all spirits sing in reverence, and the **Minister of Fate** bows in assent.

All are the **Most High’s boundless virtue of cherishing life**, commanding the **Primordial Yang** to open the people of **Great Possession**—
teaching the people to know the **Dao** and thus know their bodies,
so that none lack **lineage** or **origin**.

Yet, considering the **later generations** who aspire to the **Immortal Way**—
without this text, the **life-giving breath** has no passage, and the **Nine Gates** are sealed;
with this scripture, the **embryonic spirit** shines forth, and the **Three Palaces** blaze with vitality.

Bestowing **qi** and extending years, it is the path to **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood**,
the ladder to **obtain the Dao**.
Not only can women practice it,
but it also ensures the **form and spirit** remain undivided.

From the day we were entrusted with this duty,
we have harbored the intention to **save and guide**,
earnestly cherishing the **sacred verses**,
pledging to transmit the **rituals and disciplines**.

Having risen at dawn to purify ourselves,
and at dusk to diligently cultivate,
we follow the **Heavenly etiquette of reverence and humility**,
offering the **Golden Talismans** to solemnly swear our oaths,
pitying the **common hearts** that pray,
and gazing toward the **celestial expanse** to present our petitions.

With **sincere hearts**, we now humbly proclaim our supplication.
**Proclamation of the Petition.**

According to the intent of the words,
we have laid bare our **crimson sincerity**.
We pray for the **Mysterious Favor** to **pierce through and renew** the **Great Creation**.

In awe of the **Great Dao**, we have always striven with **single-minded devotion**;
with **urgent humility**, we do not shrink from **repeatedly offending** in our earnestness.

---

**On the Human in the World,**

From within the womb, we are called **body**—
born from a single source,
yet branching into six functions:
the eyes perceive the five colors,
the ears hear the five tones,
the nose discerns the five fragrances,
the tongue discerns the five flavors.
Sometimes we move the arms and bend the fingers,
sometimes we wield strength and race like the wind—
all from that single **spark of luminous spirit**,
the workmanship of **transformation**.

Like shaping clay into vessels,
turning the potter’s wheel to perfect them;
or like carved wooden figures,
activated by their mechanisms to serve their purpose.
How much more so for those in the **Human Way**—
truly endowed with **self-cultivation**—
who kindle the **Lan-cauldron’s flame** at midnight,
shake the **cloud-axe** beyond the heavens,
halt the **Nine-Dragon celestial chariot**,
and dance the **Three-Layered Embryonic Immortal**.

We humbly pray that the **Lofty Vision** descend and illuminate,
that its radiance descend upon us.
May the **World-Nurturing Dao** descend its **piercing qi** to harmonize;
may the **Jade Infant** be nourished without interruption.
Further, we hope for **abundant blessings**,
extending to all **sentient beings**.

Now, in this **quiet night of Dao practice**,
we request the assembled **Law Assembly** to light the **first pinch of incense**,
wishing this incense-smoke to ascend to the heavens,
offering to the **Ten-Directional Supreme Dao-Jewel Heavenly Sovereign**.

We, the subjects, **surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender fate**,
prostrate ourselves with our heads to the ground,
and with this incense-lighting merit,
we bless the **Current Emperor of the Han Dynasty**.
May the **foundation be as firm as the **Pan Stone**,
and the governance as refined as **hanging robes**.
May the **Red Canopy** be ever-august,
protecting the **sovereign’s lineage and household**;
may the **Imperial Foundations** be unshaken,
gathering **timely blessings** for the common folk.
May the **abundance** be as boundless as **plum and willow**,
and the **faithfulness** as steadfast as **the tracks of the qilin**.
Thus may the **ten thousand years** endure,
hearing the **Song of Mount Song**;
then may the **hundred sons** be virtuous,
harmonizing with the **blessings of the Hua Seal**.

Now, we light incense in devotion,
**surrendering to the Supreme Virtue of the Great Sage, Perfect Truth Assembly of the Dao-Jewel Sovereign**.
After attaining the Dao,
we **preserve Heaven’s longevity**,
harmonizing with the **True and Real**.

Now, in this **quiet night of Dao practice**,
we request the assembled **Law Assembly** to light the **second pinch of incense**,
wishing this incense-smoke to ascend to the heavens,
offering to the **Ten-Directional Supreme Scripture-Jewel Heavenly Sovereign**.

We, the subjects, **surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender fate**,
prostrate ourselves with our heads to the ground,
and with this incense-lighting merit,
we **return blessings to the ancestral lineage of the [specific family]—**
a hundred generations, ten thousand descendants—
ascending in form to the **Effulgent Platform of the Kalpa**;
all children and grandchildren,
obeying in the **Great Harmony Era**.

May the **Dao-Eye** be illuminated,
and the **roots of evil** extinguished;
may the **five viscera** flourish,
and the **three palaces** be serene.
As **Heaven’s children**, may we preserve the **breath of the womb** in the **Mysterious Female Root**;
as **Original Qi** descends into the body,
may we **receive the Wu-Ji** in the **Spirit Storehouse**.

Now, we light incense in devotion,
**surrendering to the Supreme Virtue of the Scripture-Jewel Sovereign, Great Sage, Perfect Truth Assembly**.
After attaining the Dao,
we **permanently preserve longevity**,
harmonizing with the **True and Real**.

Now, in this **quiet night of Dao practice**,
we request the assembled **Law Assembly** to light the **third pinch of incense**,
wishing this incense-smoke to ascend to the heavens,
offering to the **Ten-Directional Supreme Teacher-Jewel Heavenly Sovereign**.

We, the subjects, **surrender body, surrender spirit, surrender fate**,
prostrate ourselves with our heads to the ground,
and with this incense-lighting merit,
we **return blessings to the vast and boundless karma of [specific family] across the Three Realms**—
nothing left unbestowed;
we **scatter virtuous fruits** in the Ten Directions—
all forms **transcended**.

May **weapons cease**, and both **Yi and Xia** submit;
may **epidemics not arise**, and **auspicious omens** manifest.
Our **teachers, preceptors, and benevolent friends**,
all **realizing fruit** and ascending in form;
the **guardian spirits**,
all **speaking of merit** and advancing in office.
Awaiting the **bestowal of decrees**,
extending to both **living and dead**,
bathed in this **auspicious cause**,
all may ascend to the **Dao-shore**.

Now, we light incense in devotion,
**surrendering to the Supreme Virtue of the Teacher-Jewel Sovereign, Great Sage, Perfect Truth Assembly**.
After attaining the Dao,
we **permanently preserve Heaven’s longevity**,
harmonizing with the **True and Real**.

**Chanting the Square Array, Confessing the Square Array,**
**Three Invocations, Three Salutations.**
**Reaffirming the Law Position.**

The **officiating subjects**, including **Certain [Name] and the assembled officials at the altar**,
with **sincere hearts**, now humbly present our petition to the **Golden Threshold’s Supreme Three Pure Celestial Sovereigns,**
the **Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,**
the **Responsive Spirits of the Three Realms,**
and **all True Essences**.

We have heard that the **Heavenly Dao values life**,
and the **Mystic Gate universally saves**.
Above, there is no **return to the Original Ancestors**,
for the **Azure Realm** is the **Heaven of the Native People**;
nearby, within our own bodies,
**Primordial Beginning** resides above the **muddy sphere**.
The **Five Phases** are examined together,
and the **Seven Deities** share the same category.
Thus, the **Dao generates One**,
One generates Two,
Two generates Three,
Three generates the **Ten Thousand Things**—
the **source of the womb’s vital breath**;
while **humanity follows Earth**,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
and the Dao follows **Spontaneous Nature**—
the **foundation of form and appearance**.

The **commoner’s nature and fate** all depend on the **Dao’s generation**;
all **sages and worthies** emerge from the **womb’s nurturing**.
Thus, within a single body,
the **infant and maiden** embody the **law of yin and yang**,
with no distinction between **refined and coarse**,
nor separation between **metal and wood**.
The **pearl congeals from qi and fluid**,
holding the **mechanism of the Five Phases’ inversion**;
the **fire refines the golden essence**,
concealing the **meaning of the Three Fields’ reversal**.

For those who cultivate—
they may **merge with the Hundred Spirits**;

The enlightened may transcend the **Three Realms**.

Here, there is one who takes the **Dao** as his **宗 (master/ultimate principle)**.
Not only may he seek **posterity**,
but also achieve the **sacred embryo’s fulfillment**.

We, your humble servants, of **coarse qi and turbid essence**,
with shallow virtue and meager practice,
bow before your **numinous heart**,
devoutly relying on the **Supreme Goodness**,
with sincere and earnest resolve,
hoping to gain divine response.

Now, the **ritual officer** [name] with **profoundly concentrated incense**,
freed from all **doubtful snares**,
ascends transgressions and treads upon faults,
ashamed to become a **scapegoat for calamity’s roots**;
cultivates **virtue and self-refinement**,
guarding against plunging into the **evil fruit of misdeeds**.

We **take refuge in the Purple Extremity**,
concentrating our knocks at the **Mysterious Pass**,
with **crimson sincerity exhausted within**,
and **lofty aspiration upward** to the **Great Work’s creation**.

May the **Jade Capital’s Three Realms**,
the **Golden Gate’s High Immortals**,
the **Embryo-Protecting Spirit Kings**,
and the **Great Saints of Longevity**,
witness our sincerity,
bestow their **profound grace**,
and command the **Five Emperors and Three Officials**,
as well as the **Four Directors and Nine Ministries**,
to bear our **talismans and decrees**,
opening the way for life and death,
illuminating with **divine radiance**,
and conveying it to the **Celestial Registry**.

The **Seven Ancestors and Nine Forebears** shall all receive the **refinement of essence**;
the **Four Companions and Three Teachers** shall each attain the **fruit of Non-Action**.

May our **guilt be erased from the Northern Bureau**,
our **life records inscribed in the Southern Palace**,
may we **nurture the Crimson Infant within the heart**,
and **subdue the Demon Kings** to safeguard our ascent.

Entering and exiting without ailment,
we **elevate the One Yang at the beginning of *Gui Fu***;
our **voice and qi seek each other**,
fulfilling the **Three Summons** within the **pure *Qian* body**.

Then, all **dusty defilements exhausted**,
the **Six Perfections** complete,
our **refined qi forms the body**,
and we attain **longevity and enduring vision**,
honoring above the **Heavenly Sovereign’s great compassion**,
and below fulfilling our servants’ **sincere vow of submission**.

With reverence, we present this **Twelvefold Wish**.

**Reigniting the Furnace**.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers**,
the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of Incense**,
shall now cause the places where I have practiced in **quiet nights** to naturally generate
**golden elixir, lapis lazuli, and the hundred spirits of herbs and flowers**,
as the **multitudes of immortals gather** before this incense furnace.

May I wish that the **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens**
attend the **orchid mist**,
transmit my previous petition,
and swiftly convey it directly to the **Supreme Ultimate Great Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky**.

**Exit the Hall in Praise**.
**Exit the Door**.

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 28 Complete**
**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 29**
**Exhortation to the Three Caverns Scripture and Ritual Disciples**
**Prayer for the Great Ritual Assembly**
**Dispersed Ritual Platform, Conducting the Dao**

**Ritual Procedures Ascend the Platform as Prescribed.**
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.
**Proclaim the Sacred Spirit Incantations.**

The Five Stars shine in array, illuminating the Five Directions.
Mercury repels calamity, Wood’s virtue brings prosperity.
Mars dissipates misfortune, Jupiter wards off war.
The Star of Destiny steadies, benefiting the family and state.
Names inscribed on jade tablets, words recorded in the Imperial Archives.
Riding the wind’s gusts, soaring through the boundless sky.
Entering and exiting the void, wandering in the Ten Directions.
Five clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and harnessing winds.
Commanding ten thousand spirits, protecting the Daoist Sage above,
harmonizing with the Dao and attaining True Unity.

**Twenty-four strokes of the Supreme Law Drum.**

The **Supreme Three Heavens, Primordial Origin of the Three Qi,**
the **Most High Dao Lord,**
the **Most High Laozi,**
summon forth from my body the **Three Five Functionaries,**
the **Left and Right Official Messengers,**
the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers,**
the **Dragon-Courier Clerks,**
the **Attendant Golden Boys,**
the **Speaking Scattered-Flower Jade Maidens,**
the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,**
the **Direct-Day Incense Officials—**
each thirty-six in number—**now emerge.**

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
with caps and sashes trailing ribbons.
They open the **Mysterious Platform’s Land and Domain Spirits.**

I now establish this **Great Ritual Assembly** and conduct the Dao.
With sincerity, I humbly present my petition.
My earnest devotion has already been recorded and reported.
May the **Most High Dao Qi of the Ten Directions** descend in **Sacred Treasure Radiance,**
flowing into my body,
so that my petition may swiftly reach the **Supreme Ultimate Great Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky.**

**Request the invocation of the Law Position.**

I, **Position-Holding Official [Name],** together with the assembled ritual officers,

the **Nine-Heavens Golden and Jade Palaces, Sacred Rescue, Great Mercy Two True Lords,**
the **Wind, Cloud, Thunder, and Rain Departments’ Mighty Sacred Hosts,**
the **City Gods, Village Shrines, Temple Deities—all true spirits.**

I have heard that the **Dragon-Han Jade Calendar** clearly records the merit of opening the eon;
the **Sacred Treasure Cavern Chapters** secretly note the ranks of those who pray.

「Thus, I, [Your Name], have repeatedly submitted humble petitions in earnest, seeking to enrich humanity.

At the **jewel-strewn banquets** and **jade platforms** of the **Sacred Daoist Altars**,
I reverently offer my wholehearted devotion;
With **cloud-chariots** and **wind-horses**,
I await the **ascended steps** of the **Celestial Journey**.

I present **sacrifices to the **Mining Spirits****, offering sincerity to honor them,
And may the **Guardian Spirits** hear my prayers and bestow blessings in return.

I humbly pray that the **Five-Colored Clouds** may dissolve and vanish,
That all **immortal spirits** may ascend to the **Eon-Peaks**,
And that I may **assist the myriad immortals**,
Ever enjoying the **offerings of the **Sacred Daoist Altars****.

May the **endless virtues** of the **Dao** flow forth,
And blessings extend to all under heaven.

I, [Your Name], along with the **officiating officials**,
Am deeply moved by the **supreme reverence** of our devotion—
We kneel twice, gazing toward the **Celestial Clouds**,
And respectfully welcome the **Great Procession** of the **Holy**.

May the **Holy One descend**,
And first receive our **sacrificial offerings**,
Then bless us with **scattered flowers**.

I, [Your Name], with utmost sincerity, now declare:
The **Primordial Natural Sovereign of the **Dao’s Beginning****,
The **Sacred Realm’s True Sovereign of the **Lingbao Dao****,
The **Highest Daoist Realm’s Sovereign of the **Moral Way****,
The **Supreme Celestial Emperor of the **Jade Sovereign****,
And all **Three Realms** that respond to devotion—
All **mighty and sacred spirits**—

I have heard that the **Great Dao** is profound and mysterious,
And that the **true spirits** first established its foundation.

The **Primordial Qi** of the **Dao’s Beginning**,
Unfurled the **cosmic diagram** at the **first eon** of the **ten billion kalpas**;
The **sun, moon, and stars**,
Were exalted above the **ten thousand heavens**.

Together they **divided and governed** all things,
And **jointly aided** the living in harmony.

Now, I, **officiant [Your Name]**, reflect upon my **unfulfilled desires**,
And my **deep anxiety** over my **offspring’s lack of prosperity**.

For **life is not solely my own**—
It is the **manifested form** entrusted by **Heaven and Earth**;
Yet **all things are born of the Dao**,
And owe their existence to the **harmonious Qi** of **Yin and Yang**.

On this **auspicious day** of **prayer and purification**,
I **sincerely present** my **devoted offerings**,
Hoping the **Celestial Journey** may pause,
And the **jewel-wheeled chariots** may descend before my gaze.

I humbly pray that the **immortal spirits** may **lower their presence**,
And the **ranked saints** may **return their radiance**.

The **Six Celestial Stems** and **Three Heavenly Cycles**,
May each **fulfill their role** in **protecting the fetus**;
The **ten billion chariots** and **millions of mounted escorts**,
May **circulate and sustain** the **command of life**.

With **pure and fragrant offerings**,
May all **prosper and multiply**.

I have **received the True Doctrine**,
And **participated in its sacred rites**—
Thus, I now **solemnly present** my **devoted words**,
To be **proclaimed to the heavens**.

**Proclaiming the Words**:
I carefully examine each **sacred phrase**,
And **display my utmost sincerity**.

I reflect that **humans are the most refined of all living beings**,
And without this refinement, we would not differ from other creatures;
That **children are the descendants of their parents**,
And without proper lineage, there would be no **continuation of the ancestral line**.

With **unceasing sincerity**, I **present my prayers**,
Hoping the **highest heavens** may **listen with favor**.

I humbly pray that the **celestial realm** may **bestow its grace**,
And that the **imperial lineage** may endure **without bounds**.

May the **empress and consorts** bear **auspicious omens** of **peace and abundance**,
And the **matchmaking officials** display **divine signs** of **harmony and union**.

May the **heir apparent** receive **favor and blessings**,
And the **imperial records** shine with **augmented glory**.

May the **ruler and ministers** all rejoice in **enlightened virtue**,
And the **barbarians and the civilized** alike follow **the Dao’s refined path**.

The **highest heavens** may **broaden their vast blessings** across the **four seas**,
And the **lowest realms** may **fulfill their duty** in **protecting the lineage**.

Then may blessings **reach the officiating officials**,
And grace **flow to our descendants**.

May we **align with Heaven** and **align with the Emperor**,
And dare to **pray for the five blessings** of the **four generations**;
May we **bow to the past** and **bow to the present**,
And hope to **attain the prosperity** of the **ten thousand stones in one gate**.

With **devotion**, we **pray to the True Creator**,
And with **humility**, we **seek the Emperor’s insight**.

I, [Your Name], along with the **officiating officials**,
Am deeply moved by our **earnest supplications**—
We kneel twice, **presenting incense**,
And **pour libations** as **final offerings**.

**Scattering flowers**.

I have heard that the **primordial principles** unfold in **endless succession**,
And the **three luminaries**—**sun, moon, and stars**—
Are **established at the roots of Heaven**;
That the **mechanisms of creation**,
**Govern all spirits** beneath the **Big Dipper’s handle**.

The **Five Phases** are **divided and cyclically activated**,
And the **Four Seasons** are **regulated in harmony**.

The **eleven luminaries** of the **astrological system**,
Record **calamities and blessings** in the **celestial calendar**;
The **four stars and seven constellations**,
**Influence longevity and fate** through the **fetal and animal spirits**.

Now, I **solemnly entrust** the **Minister of Yin**,
To **devote all my sincerity**,
And **pray with a pure heart**.

I **reflect upon my humble lineage**,
And my **years of service**—
Attending to **imperial meals** and **offering respectful inquiries**,
As **direct descendant of the ancestral line**,
I have **repeatedly presented petitions** for **purification and blessings**,
And **humbly hope** for the **descent of the immortal spirits**.

I pray that the **auspicious stages** may **be level and harmonious**,
And that the **fire star** may **remain centered** while **cold and heat** are **properly balanced**.

The **three hundred sixty-five degrees** of the **celestial sphere**, divided into **four quarters**,
May all **align perfectly** with the **seasons and years**;
The **ten thousand and five hundred twenty** stars,
May **none deviate** from their **proper celestial positions**.

Then may they **receive my sincere offerings**,
And **transmit them to the Southern Celestial Palace**,
**Passing on the **Sacred Daoist Talismans**** to **ensure continuity**,
And **protect the **auspicious sounds**** while **securing blessings**.

May **Venus** appear in my **dreams**,
And my wishes **align with the **Luminous White Star**’s **precision**;
May the **stars of the Big Dipper’s tail** ascend to the **heavens**,
And my prayers **harmonize with the **auspicious blessings of the **Divine Rocks****.

I, [Your Name], along with the **assembled officiants**,
Am deeply moved by our **supplications for grace and command**—
We **pour libations** as **final offerings**.

**Scattering flowers**.

I, [Your Name], with **renewed sincerity**, now declare:
All **Heavenly Emperors** and **Highest True Ones of the **Ten Extremes****,
May **all gaze upon** the **great compassion**,
And **pierce the mysteries** of the **radiant decrees**.

I have heard that the **mountains stand firm** and the **seas are clear**,
And that even without **scriptural teachings**, the **Dao** is **manifest**;
That the **mouth’s utterances** and **words**,
Are all **formed on earth** and **transmitted to Heaven**.»

There are **1,520 stars**,
All **lying dormant** beneath the **vast expanse**—
Then they **receive** the **sincere offerings** of our **auspicious blessings**,
**Pouring libations** to the **Southern Celestial Palace**,
**Transmitting** the **ritual purity** to **assume their roles**,
And **safeguarding** the **humble and reverent** to **obtain good fortune**.

**Longreg** enters dreams—
May the **auspicious talismans** **align** with the **essence of Taibai**;
**Jiwei** ascends to Heaven—
**Humbly** **cooperating** with the **auspicious blessings of the Divine Rocks**.

I, **[Your Name]**, with the **assembled officiants**,
**Feel unworthy** of the **utmost supplications for grace and command**—
Yet we **pour libations** as **final offerings**.

**Scattering flowers**.

I, **[Your Name]**, with **renewed sincerity**, now declare:
All **Heavenly Emperors** and **Highest True Ones of the Ten Extremes**,
**May all gaze upon** the **great compassion**,
And **pierce the mysteries** of the **radiant decrees**.

---

Now, the **auspicious blessings** **originate** from the **mountains and rivers**,
And the **nurturing of life** **arises** from the **transformative power** of **Creation**.
The **emergence of a sage** in **Guandong**,
**Already depends** on the **favorable winds** and **auspicious sounds**;
Only the **mountains descend the Dao**,
**Their logic** also **draws support** from the **harmonious qi**.

Some are the **many scholars** of **Ru-Ying**,
Others are the **literary talents** of **Bashu**—
**Truly** they belong to the **earthly numinous**,
**Devoutly** **relying** on the **Dao’s protective shade**.

I, **[Your Name]**, a **Daoist officiant** by birth,
**Suffer** from **illness in the womb** and **childhood afflictions**,
And my **descendants are few**—
**Fearful** of **litigious disputes** **entangling** my lineage,
Or of **land disputes** **bringing misfortune**—
Thus I **present offerings** and **ritual provisions**,
**Hoping** to **propitiate** the **Highest True Ones**.

**Humbly** I pray:
May the **numinous brilliance** of the **Yangtze and Han rivers** **permeate**,
And the **mountains and marshes** **channel the harmonious qi**—
**Observe** my **sincere devotion**, even as **inconsequential** as an **ant**,
And **accept** my **modest oblations**, though **impure** as the **muddy waters**.

The **seas do not raise waves**—
There are **nine marshes** that **do not overflow**;
The **Earth’s vast capacity** **nourishes all**—
Yet **three rivers** **do not all shake** in **turbulence**.

**Universal salvation** of the **living and the dead**,
**All may receive** the **blessings of virtue**,
**Forgiving** their **offenses and transgressions**,
And **granting** them **future prosperity**.

With **rituals and music, scriptures and calculations**,
May **prosperity flourish** within our **household**;
With the **four great elements** of **earth, water, fire, and wind**,
May **harmony be preserved** in the **four directions**.

The **Han dynasty’s officials** **illuminate** the **local communities**,
**Shining** with the **glory of learning**;
The **Jin dynasty’s ministers** **support** their **descendants**,
**Flowing** like the **Huai River’s currents**—**unbroken**.

The humble servant and the assembled officials of the fast, with deepest sincerity and fervent devotion, prostrate ourselves twice and present incense and sacred wash.

**Step on the Void**—
**Reaffirm the Dao’s station.**

With the assembled officials and the humble servant [name], we humbly unite in sincere supplication before:

The **Jade Purity Emperor, Yuan Shi Tian Zun**,
The **Upper Clarity Emperor, Ling Bao Tian Zun**,
The **Great Emperor of the Supreme Clarity, Dao De Tian Zun**,
The **Most High Sovereign of the Azure Sky, Jade Emperor of the Supreme**,
All the **Heavens, the Earths**,
All the **Waters, all the Mountains**,
The **Three Realms of responsive spirits**,
And all **true and numinous essences**.

We have heard that **fasting and Daoist practice**, though following the **six seasons’ disciplines**,
And **sacred wine and grand offerings**, must be **complete in the three presentations**.

Yet, alas, we—**mired in dust and filth**—
Have **repeatedly offended the Celestial Hearth**,
Offering **meager tributes of coarse grains and herbs**,
And **delaying the proper rites and attendants**.

We humbly reflect: our **learning of the Dao is incomplete**, our **transgressions manifold**,
Our **actions contrary to ritual**, our **words careless and unrefined**,
Every movement **inviting guilt**—
All we **beg for pardon and absolution**.

We only **hope that the High Immortals of the Upper Realm** may **return to their jade palaces**,
That the **saints of the Lower World** may **all ascend to the ranks of the Dao**,
That **blessings descend and grace flows**,
That **calamities be dispelled and hardships crossed**.

May the **Heavens restore their order**, their **echoes fading in an instant**;
May the **Great Ultimate’s breath** **preserve the embryonic qi** in the **Hall of Prolonged Life**.

We, the servants, **fix our gaze on the Dao’s path**, **concentrating on the boundless void**,
Yet **lament the mire of dust**—
**Unable to retain the Sacred Footsteps**.

The humble servant and the assembled officials of the fast, with all the gathered congregation,
With deepest **yearning to gaze upon the Celestial Stairs** and **prostrate before the Divine Procession**,
With **uttermost devotion and longing**, now **humble our words**.

**Reignite the furnace.**
The **incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense**—
Let it be decreed that at the place where we have **previously established the ritual**, there shall **naturally arise golden elixirs, emerald-green herbs, and the hundred numinous essences**,
Where the **multitudes of true ones gather** before this **incense furnace**.

May it be our **wish that the ten-direction celestial children and jade maidens**,
**Attend to the fragrant mists**,
And **transmit our sincere supplications** directly to the **Most High, the Supreme Dao of the Non-Extreme, before the Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky**.

**The Complete Collection of Daoist Rituals and Precepts, Volume 29, concludes.**

**We, the officials of such-and-such rank, humbly offer:**

With sincere supplications to:
**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void-Natural,**
**The Supreme Daoist Lord,**
**The Supreme Old Lord,**
**The Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky,**
**The Nine Sovereigns Most High,**
**The Ten-Directional Saints,**

**The Masters of the Mountains and Waters,**
**The Three Realms of Responsive Spirits,**
**All True and Numinous Essences.**

**May all behold Your Boundless Mercy and Condescend to Pierce with Insight.**

We now **proclaim Your Will**—our **sincere devotion** has been laid bare before You.
**Trusting in Heaven’s Grace and the Clarity of Our Ritual Offerings,**

We humbly submit that the **Lord of the Southern Fire-Star, the Upholding Star (Mangzhuo),**
**Oversees all things, illuminates the hidden and profound,**
**Bestows blessings on the virtuous and calamity on the licentious,**
**Assists Heaven in its transformations.**
**Examining past dynasties, the evidence is clear:**

According to the *Han Records on Astronomy*:
*"When the Upholding Star emerges, great armies rise;
When it retreats, armies disperse and cease hostilities.
Its appearance portends death, robbery, and chaos.
If battles are fought in its domain, victory is unattained."*

In the **fourth year of Emperor Jing’s reign (150 BCE), on the seventh month’s *gengwei* day,**
it entered the **East Well, traversing the Yin Path.**
Again, in the **ninth month’s *gengwei* day, it entered the *Yuche* constellation.**
On a *wuren* day, it emerged—**the omen read: ‘Execution, warfare, and fire calamities.’**
When it guarded the **Southern Dipper during the Yuan Ding era,**
the omen read: **‘The realm it guards will face rebellion, bandits, and military defeat.
Its nation will sever worship of the Southern Dipper,
transgressing its celestial domain—**
**later, the king and empress dowager will be slain in mutual slaughter.’**
The Han armies exterminated them, and their state perished.
**In the Han, the Upholding Star manifested seventeen or eighteen times—**
**each instance heralded disaster and chaos.**

In the **second year of Zhongyuan (57 BCE) of the Later Han,**
when the **Fire Star invaded the Southwest stars of Taiwei,**
it foretold the **dismissal of high officials—**
**the Grand Commandant and Minister of Works—**
**for their offenses.**
In the **thirteenth year of Yongping (70 CE),**
when it invaded *Yuche*, **great mourning ensued;**
when it invaded *Zhi*, **high officials were executed.**
Later, **King Ying of Chu and Yan Zhong** were exposed for treason and put to death.
**In the Later Han, the Upholding Star manifested twelve times—**
**each time, calamity struck.**

From the **Jin, Song, Sui, and Five Dynasties onward,**
the records are too numerous to enumerate.
**Such are the disasters that arise within its celestial course.**

According to the *Five Stars’ Manifest Essence Scripture*:
*"When the Upholding Star shines upon a person,
their lifespan is shortened, poverty ensues.
If they submit to fate, they may live to fifty,
but **wives and sons will suffer misfortune,**
and **obstacles will multiply.**
If it shines upon sickness or peril,
**wind and labor will bring affliction.**
If it opposes the celestial station,
**death will come within the year.**
**Such are the calamities it brings when it illuminates mankind."**

**When Zhūróng and Huìlù manifest in the mortal world,**
**fire descends from Heaven—this is called *disaster*.**
**It arises from the accumulation of humanity’s sins.**
**The Qin built the Alang Palace, spanning three hundred *li*,**
**with a pavilion every five steps and a gallery every ten,**
**exhausting every grain of wealth like dust and sand.**
**The Chu burned it, and the flames raged for three months—**
**this was the work of humanity.**

**Mo Chu once returned to Luoyang by carriage from home.**
Before arriving, a woman begged for passage.
As they parted, she said:
*"I am a Heavenly Being.
I was sent to burn the Mo family’s eastern sea estate.
Now that I’ve borrowed your carriage,
I cannot fail to set it ablaze.
You must return quickly—I will come later."*
Mo Chu hurried home, gathered his valuables to flee,
and by noon, the fire blazed fiercely—**a warning to all.**

**Huán Jǐng of Sìnán was told by Fèi Chángfáng:**
*"On the ninth day of the ninth month,
your home will face a fire calamity.
Quickly depart—**
**have each family member carry a crimson pouch of *zhūyú* berries,**
ascend a high mountain, and drink chrysanthemum wine.
Only then will the disaster be averted."*
Jǐng followed his words, leading his household to the heights.
**Soon after returning, he saw his cattle, poultry, and dogs—**
**all violently dead.**

Subsequent generations thus retained this practice, establishing methods of exorcism and disaster warding.

During the Han Dynasty under Emperor Huán, at the New Year’s grand assembly with his ministers, Lè Bā held wine and spat toward the southwest. The Emperor asked the reason, and he replied: *"Shu is suffering from a fire calamity, so I am warding it off."* The Emperor sent envoys to investigate, and indeed, it was said that a great rain came from the northeast, carrying the scent of wine within—this was a method of salvation and relief.

In the past, when *Xīnghuǒ* (Mars) occupied the *Xīn* (Heart) constellation, corresponding to the celestial division of the State of Sòng, Duke Jing of Qi was troubled by it. He then issued three imperial edicts, and the calamity shifted three times.

When **Liú Kūn** governed Jianglíng, a household fire broke out. Kūn knelt before the flames, begging forgiveness, and soon, the wind reversed, extinguishing it—this was a method of turning disaster.

For indeed, the coming of calamities and blessings all stem from human summoning. The Heavenly Will is benevolent and loving, and the Dao permits supplication and exorcism. Now, certain Daoist practitioners—[names omitted]—with sincere devotion, have constructed a solemn vow-fire exorcism ritual platform. They command us to proclaim the rites and regulations, to pray for blessings and ward off disasters, and to safeguard the peace of the land.

At the beginning of the platform’s establishment, if we do not first recite the ritual matters and expound the precepts and prohibitions, how then can we move the High Celestial Spirits?

Now, we shall proclaim the **Ten Precepts for the Ritual Platform** to all assembled here, that each may receive and uphold them. Listen carefully:

**The First Precept:** Do not disturb the body and spirit. Maintain unwavering focus—let joy, anger, sorrow, and delight not arise within. Strive for clarity and precision to commune with the Most Holy Above.

**The Second Precept:** Do not treat the Sacred and True with arrogance or neglect. Hold reverence and awe, gazing upon the honored images. With sincere devotion, the Heavenly True Ones descend from the void to receive you.

**The Third Precept:** Do not slight the Sacred Scriptures. Hold them with faith and weight. Study, recite, and ponder the Three Caverns’ classics, awakening to their truth and seeking the fruit of the Dao.

**The Fourth Precept:** Do not slander the Dao’s teachings. Hold them with respect, spreading the Way and clarifying the Law. Save both the living and the dead, guiding all to take refuge and gain liberation.

**The Fifth Precept:** Do not defile the ritual grounds. Maintain purity—bathe and fast before approaching the sacred platform. Avoid foul odors, blood, and slaughter. Keep poultry, dogs, and livestock from intruding.

**The Sixth Precept:** Do not indulge the body and mind—no shouting, cursing, idle chatter, or drunken revelry. Serve the Celestial Worthies with solemnity, as before one’s sovereign and parents.

**The Seventh Precept:** Do not falter in Daoist resolve. Hold firm—let no petty frustration extinguish your sincerity. Persevere in devotion, and boundless blessings shall follow.

**The Eighth Precept:** Do not neglect the ritual duties. Be diligent and earnest—chant the Dao, recite the scriptures, and pay homage to the True Ones. Let your merits be complete, that both the living and the dead may share in the grace.

**The Ninth Precept:** Do not err in petitioning or ritual offerings. Be precise—if reckless or careless, without proper deliberation, the Three Heavens may reject your supplications, turning blessings into misfortune. This is deeply to be feared.

**The Tenth Precept:** Do not haggle over profit. Be humble and yielding—let giver and receiver both rejoice, without resentment. Do not harm your own field of merit.

**These Ten Precepts—can the assembled officials uphold them?**
*Answer:* We can uphold them.

The Celestial Worthy speaks: *"When petitions are made and the Dao is practiced, the Four Heavenly Sovereigns ride upon flying clouds in green palanquins and eight-scenery jade carriages. Attended by True Persons and Jade Maidens bearing flower-adorned banners, they are preceded by phoenix hymns and followed by the Celestial Balance. White cranes and lions chant in unison, while incense smoke and scattered flowers drift from the void. Those who observe the rites and hear the Law shall see the Heavenly True Ones descend, and all spirits gather in homage. How then can one not exhaust the fullness of the ritual?"*

First, receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Walk with measured steps, quiet the mind, and still the will. In sitting, standing, or repose, do not stray from proper form. Let the Heavenly True Ones rejoice, and your name shall be inscribed among the Upper Clarity Immortals—thus attaining the Dao’s gate within the mind.

To the ritual officials: The ritual’s solemnity is strict, its prohibitions grave. Sweep and purify the courtyard, ensuring absolute cleanliness. Discipline both inner and outer attendants—great and small—to maintain perfect silence. Do not mix mundane affairs with the Sacred, lest you offend the Celestial Spirits.

If any devout men or women wish to hear the Dao, let them bathe and fast in purity, then come to the ritual platform to pay homage and take refuge, sharing in the blessings. But if they are insolent or dismissive, unfaithful to the True—such shall surely invite retribution in the dark. Let those who partake in the ritual take heed.

**The vow is sealed; the platform is closed.**

On the morrow, we shall proceed according to the prescribed rites,

**Invoke the Lawful Rank.**

With my rank, I, the humble servant [name], along with the assembled officials at the altar, sincerely present our united petitions to:
**The Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Void-Natural Origin, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Venerable Lord, the Most High Jade Sovereign Emperor of the Celestial Vault, the Purple Micro Heavenly Sovereign Emperor, the Purple Micro North Pole Emperor, the Sacred Ancestral Heavenly Venerable Emperor, the Earthly Sovereign of the After-Soil, the Great Saintly Empress of the Primordial Heaven, the Ten-Directional Boundless Dao, the Celestial Emperors of All Heavens, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mystic Middle, the Rounded Dome’s Celestial Symbol Fire-Star Enforcing True Lord, the Transformed and Manifested Star Lords of the Constellations, the Thick-Earth Cavernous Peaks and the Masters of the Mountain and Water Altars, the Southern Fire Department Officials of the Separate Position (Homing, Ding, Si, Wu), the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.**

I have heard that **aligning the Celestial Compass to harmonize the seven celestial movements is recorded in the *Yu Book*; dividing the star degrees to observe the five celestial bands is chronicled in the *Zhou Classics*.**

Reverently contemplating the **Fire Virtue**, it governs the Vermilion Heaven, upholding the authority of the Flame Emperor, wielding the Fire Star’s law. In the **Summer Order**, it manifests as the Wind Lord to respond to the season; in the **Li Trigram’s domain**, it guards the Taiwei and receives its duties. When the Five Calamities arise, it acts in transformation; embodying the Ten Virtues, it brings auspicious signs. It moves through the degrees with sovereign presence, its radiance ever-shining and illuminating.

I, born in the dusty world, my life inscribed in the star charts—
**My comings and goings long bear the grace of its illumination;**
**My actions and silences often falter in guilt.**

Bound by the **Fire Star’s strictures**, how much more fearful is its flaming might! Without sincere supplication, how could I avert its private terrors?

Thus, I lead the assembly in earnest prayer, reverently conducting the Great Ritual, reciting the *Langhan* to cross the threshold, gazing upon the Vermilion Gate in awe. All this is to atone for past transgressions and welcome blessings.

We, dwelling in the True Lodgings yet teaching among mortals, see that those who deeply hold sincerity may truly fear Heaven’s command.

Now I solemnly vow across the **Three Realms**, pouring out my reverence to the Heavens, beseeching the **Supreme Celestial’s numinous response** to fulfill our collective prayers.

Moreover, with heartfelt words, how could I not present them above?

**Proclaim the Words.**

As the words are spoken, my sincerity is manifest.
May the **Celestial Hearing** discern them, and I humbly await the **Enlightened Response.**

I have heard that from the **Jade Terrace and Phoenix Gate to the Precious Gardens and Dragon Mounds**, since the **Primordial Green’s inception** and the **Elemental Yellow’s revelation**, the **Golden Scripts and Jade Characters** have appeared in the Heavens, the **Emerald Tablets and Vermilion Texts** have circulated in the Thick Earth.

The **vast transformations of the Great Dao**, the **majestic functions of the Divine**, benefit all sentient beings, permeating the Boundless—thus I follow the prescribed rites, solemnly erecting the Numinous Altar, awaiting the True Sages’ arrival, hoping for their auspicious blessings.

Now, at this dawn, as the ritual proceeds, I request the assembled Law-Masters to light the **first incense strand**, wishing this fragrant smoke to ascend and supply the **Most High Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Saints.**

We, the servants, **submit body, submit spirit, submit fate**, prostrating ourselves to the ground. With this incense-strand’s merit, we pray for the **current Emperor**, that he may **embody Yao’s benevolence in ruling the world, surpassing Shun’s filial piety in pacifying the people.**

May his **Precious Destiny endure**, establishing the **Revived Prosperity’s work;**
May his **Sacred Plans expand**, further solidifying the **Great Peace’s foundation.**
May his **lifespan rival the heavens’ height, his fortune flow like rivers.**
May the **Six Palaces be serene, the Hundred Ministers loyal and virtuous,**
The **Golden Branches flourish for a thousand springs, the Jade Candles burn evenly in the Four Qi.**

Now, with this incense, we **return to rely upon the Teacher’s Great Saintly, Most True Virtue.**

After attaining the Dao, we **preserve Heaven’s eternal life, harmonizing with the True Dao.**

Now, at this dawn, as the ritual proceeds, I request the assembled Law-Masters to light the **second incense strand**, wishing this fragrant cloud to ascend and supply the **Most High Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Saints.**

The disciples **return to rely upon** the Teacher’s **Great Saintly, Most True Virtue** with **body, spirit, and life** in submission,
**prostrating heads to the earth**—now offering this incense strand’s **merits and virtues**,
**to flow back** to our **Nine Ancestors and Seven Forebears**, both **departed and living**.

May we be **delivered from the netherworld’s exile**,
**ascend to the Celestial Court of the Saints**,
**return in form to wander the boundless void**,
**free the self from the Five Turbidities**,
**forever abandon the Nine Abysses’ hells**,
**eternally depend upon the Ten-Directional Heavenly Sovereigns**,
**quickly grasp the True Dao**,
**constantly uphold the Right View**.

Now, with this incense, we **return to rely upon** the Teacher’s **Great Saintly, Most True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao, we **ascend to the Formless Realm**,
**harmonizing with the True Dao**.

At this dawn, as the ritual proceeds, we request the assembled **Law-Masters**
to light the **third incense strand**—
wishing this fragrant cloud to **ascend and pierce the heavens**,
**to supply the Most High Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Saints**.

The disciples **return to rely upon** the Teacher’s **Great Saintly, Most True Virtue** with **body, spirit, and life** in submission,
**prostrating heads to the earth**—now offering this incense strand’s **merits and virtues**,
**to flow back** to our **house**.

May the **Fire Virtue** descend with grace,
the **Yang Spirit** bestow blessings—
**let the Upholder not linger in exile**,
**let the Mischief-Maker’s plundering cease in the radiance of light**.
May we **heed the threat and fear the might**—
wishing to **retreat and guard the abode of the mind**;
**following the celestial paths**, may we receive **auspicious gifts**—
**not to exalt the stars that dwell at the door**.

May **Prosperity’s work** shine forth in the **Royal Court**,
**Bright Clarity’s splendor** illuminate **all beings**,
the **boundaries of the realm** remain tranquil,
**households flourish with abundant people**,
all together **seeking the harmonious gathering** of blessings,
**uniting to fulfill the Most High’s Bright Clarity**.

Now, with this incense, we **return to rely upon** the Teacher’s **Great Saintly, Most True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao, we **forever preserve eternal life**,
**harmonizing with the True Dao**.

**Repentance complete**.
**One, two—begin the invocation**.

**Threefold rites.** Reverently proclaiming the sacred rank.

With utmost sincerity, we—**this humble subject** and the assembled officials at the altar—**solemnly unite in petitioning**:

The **Most High Three Pure Ones, Supreme Saints**,
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault, Sovereign of the Highest Heaven**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of Ultimate Veneration**,
The **Ten-Directional Supreme Saints**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, the Mystic Lawmaster of the Primordial Center**,
The **Supreme True One of the Fire Deity**,
The **Responsive Ones of the Three Realms**,
All **True Spirits** without exception.

We, your subjects, have heard:
The **Teaching of Clarity and Stillness** was **greatly expounded in the Western Zhou**;
The **Orthodox Unity’s winds** were **proclaimed in the Eastern Han**.

From the **Emperor of the Void’s** creation of the cosmos, the **Dao** has held supreme;
Since **Pangu’s** opening of Heaven, **Divine Transformation** has reigned as master.

East and west align the **positions of Yin and Yang**,
South and north establish the **palaces of Kan and Li**,
The sun and moon traverse their courses,
Stars and constellations weave their patterns—
Thus they **regulate the interplay of the Two Qi**,
**Command and govern all spirits**.

How much more so the **Fire Deity’s** exalted star,
The **Central Heaven’s radiant beacon**!

It **oversees theft and disease**,
**Commands hunger and war**;
Where it resides, the land suffers calamity;
Where it turns, the realm falls into chaos.
The native ruler **fails in governance**, leading to
**unusual celestial omens** and **disorder in Heaven**.

Now, this **ritual official** reverently observes:
The **Southern Dipper’s handle** aligns with **Kan’s position**,
The **Fire Star** occupies its **summer station**, its **hexagram fixed in Li’s palace**.

To **prevent disaster**, we must **anticipate misfortune**;
To **avoid ruin**, we must **reflect and revere**.

Seeking **serenity and peace**,
We dare not **neglect supplication and expiation**.

The humble servants, long revering the **Void and the Uncarved**,
Delving in darkness to fathom the **Dao’s profound depths**,
Studying the **Canons** and donning the **Sacred Talismans**,
Following the **Law** to perform the **Ritual Steps**,
Seeking to **move the True Spirits** with sincerity,
Certain to **purge the defilements** of dust and filth.

We humbly pray:
May the **Yellow Flower** cleanse our essence,
May the **Red Star** refine its brilliance,
Purifying the **hundred obstructions** of **Yin’s impurities**,
Preserving the **eight pure substances** of **Soul-Light**,
Clearing the **altar hall** with solemnity,
Invoking the **hurricane talismans** to descend,
Reverently following the **clear rituals**,
Upright in venerating the **pure symbols**.

With our humble **ritual assembly**,
We chant the **mystic verses of Great Possession**,
Slightly extending our **sincere gratitude**,
Devoutly awaiting the **blessings of the Soaring Immortals**.

Now, at this **critical announcement**,
We pour forth our **earnest words**.

We humbly pray:
May the **aligned stars** withdraw their **menacing influence**,
May the **Law-Star** cease its **ominous radiance**,
May the **August Sage** bestow **abundant blessings**,
May **Tai Bai** repel **war and calamity**,
May **Fire** bring no **burning disasters**,
May **Water** cease its **flooding afflictions**.

May the **Jade Emperor of Vermilion Mounds** grant **eternal life**,
May the **Old Man of the Southern Pole** bestow **supreme longevity**.

The **Divine Ones** under the **Dan Spirit’s** command,
Transform **misfortune into auspice**;
The **disaster-stars**, altered and transmuted,
Follow their **proper courses** in orderly motion.

May all under Heaven be **blessed and protected**,
Every household **bathed in grace**,
All freed from **sudden violent terrors**,
Together enjoying **serene and peaceful happiness**,
The **Primordial One’s** reign **pure and flourishing**,
The **Earth’s records** in **tranquil order**,
The **Sacred Lineage** **enduring and vast**,
The **people** **prosperous and united**,
Above fulfilling the **Heavenly Lord’s** **Great Compassion**,
Below answering our **humble devotion**.

With **twelve prayers**,
We **reignite the furnace**.

**Incense Officials and Messengers, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, Attendant Incense Spirits**—
Let them command that at our **former pure dawn rituals**,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** naturally arise,
**Mushrooms and Hundred Spirits** bloom,
As **multitudes of True Ones** gather here before this **incense furnace**.

We pray that the **Ten-Direction Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**
Attend to the **Orchid Smoke**,
Transmit our **earlier petitions** swiftly,
Directly to the **Most High, Supreme Dao of the Unoriginated, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**.

**Exit the Hall with Chanting**.

**Ritual of Oath-Fire to Repel Disaster** (Continued)

The **Law Assembly** ascends the platform as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Master with reverent devotion as the **Way** dictates. The **Vigilant Spirit Talismans** are proclaimed.

The **Danling** and **Zhuhuo**—flaming essences and winds—blaze forth. The **Red Wheel** rolls with unyielding vigor, its radiance piercing the **Eight Directions of Heaven**. A surge of **Thunderous Might** envelops all, shifting and transforming the **Ten Thousand Worlds**. **Golden Elixir** cascades, and **hostile spirits** vanish without trace. **Evil schemers and demons** are vanquished, their **Original Merit** laid bare. **Golden Talismans** summon and command, while **Cloud-Stepping Dragon Officers** and **Incense-Bearing Golden Boys** attend. **Messenger Maidens** who scatter **Jade Flowers** and **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, along with the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**, each **thirty-six in number**, now emerge.

The **emerging ones** wear **solemn attire and radiant garments**, their **crowns and sashes** trailing **pendant plumes**. They open the **Mysterious Gate** to summon the **Earthly Sovereigns** and **Domain Spirits**. The **True Ones**.

At this **noon hour of the Way**, I humbly present my **sincere intentions**. My **true devotion** has already been recorded and heard. May the **Supreme Dao of the Unoriginated** descend its **Spiritual Treasure and Auspicious Light**, flowing into my being, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Most High, Supreme Dao of the Unoriginated, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**.

I request the **recitation of the Law Position**. With the **Law Assembly** gathered, I now light the **first incense strand**. May this **Incense Cloud** ascend into the heavens, offering homage to the **Ten-Direction Dao Treasures of the Celestial Sovereigns**. I, along with the **Law Assembly**, **submit body, submit spirit, submit life**, bowing my head to the earth. With this act of lighting incense, I pray for the **merits** to bless the **current Emperor**.

May the **Jade Calendar** endure in its **Great Flood**, the **foundations of the Throne** last forever. May his **lifespan match Heaven and Earth**, his **virtue rival the sage-kings Tang and Yu**. May the **Yin-Brightness** of his **constant illumination** be ever-present, and the **Yang-Vigor** of his **great governance** extend far and wide.

The **Empress**, bearing the **Kun Virtue** of nurturing, may her **moonlike radiance** shine in harmony, assisting the **Sacred Sovereign** and bringing prosperity to the **Grand Enterprise**. May she **perpetually promote benevolence and frugality**, upholding the **Inner Precepts** within the **Nine Enclosures**; may she **forever bestow harmony and grace**, celebrating the **Root Branch** for all **ten thousand generations**.

**Recite the Petition**. Examine the words carefully—they reveal my **sincerest devotion**. Heaven has no scent nor sound, yet it hears the **goodly**; the **Dao** has **sentience and nature**, and its response is never in vain. Those who seek to **move Heaven with sincerity** must rely on **uttermost devotion**; those who wish to **pray for hidden communion** must depend on **skillful invocations**.

I have heard that from the **Primordial One Qi**, the **Great Transformation** of **Yin and Yang** was established. The **Dao’s vast illumination** fills the **Great Void**, and its **flying essences** nurture the **Supreme Pole**. The **Lofty Sacred Mountains** rise majestic, and the **Heavenly Stairways** stretch boundless. **Ten Thousand Spirits** guard the **Primordial Sovereign**, while the **Celestial Hosts** maintain order among the **moving multitudes**.

In ancient times, the **Blue Boys** inscribed the **Trigrams**, the **Red Emperor** cultivated the people, the **Tortoise and Dragon** bore the **River and Luo** scriptures, and the **Lynx and Phoenix** responded to the **auspicious commands** of the **Five Emperors**. The **Great Bear** governed the world, the **Golden Mother** transmitted talismans, and the **Great Ruler** presented his **full array**. The **Heavenly Symbols**, though hidden, were revealed; when **one person elevated his virtue**, the **Ten Thousand Worlds** shone in prosperity. When **one hundred rulers obeyed in harmony**, the **thousand generations** followed with reverence. All ascended to their **assigned stations**, dwelling at the **Center** to **dispense virtue**.

Now, the **fragrant winds** follow the **heavenly rhythms**, the **fear of the sun’s brilliance** is timely. I revere the **unbiased radiance**, offering devotion to the **sensitive might**. On this **auspicious day**, I solemnly invoke the **Dao’s sacred standards**, hoping to **conciliate the Highest Truths** and **prolong the Emperor’s blessings**.

With the **Law Assembly** gathered, I light this incense at noon. May this **Incense Cloud** soar through the heavens, offering homage to the **Ten-Direction Dao Treasures of the Celestial Sovereigns**. I, along with the **Law Assembly**, **submit body, submit spirit, submit life**, bowing my head to the earth. With this act of lighting incense, I pray for the **merits** to bless the **current Emperor**.

May the **Jade Calendar** endure in its **Great Flood**, the **foundations of the Throne** last forever. May his **lifespan match Heaven and Earth**, his **virtue rival the sage-kings Tang and Yu**. May the **Yin-Brightness** of his **constant illumination** be ever-present, and the **Yang-Vigor** of his **great governance** extend far and wide.

The **Empress**, bearing the **Kun Virtue** of nurturing, may her **moonlike radiance** shine in harmony, assisting the **Sacred Sovereign** and bringing prosperity to the **Grand Enterprise**. May she **perpetually promote benevolence and frugality**, upholding the **Inner Precepts** within the **Nine Enclosures**; may she **forever bestow harmony and grace**, celebrating the **Root Branch** for all **ten thousand generations**.

Now, the **burning of incense** is done in homage to the **Dao/Way-Embodied Great Saint**, the **Supreme Assembly of the Most True Virtue/Power**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**, may the **Heavenly Longevity** be preserved, and may **harmony** abide with the **True Dao/Way**. With this **midday Dao/Way practice**, the **Assemblies of the Law** are invoked, and thus we offer **three twists of incense**, hoping this **incense-cloud** may rise and ascend through the heavens, to **venerate the Celestial Lord of the Ten Directions** and the **Treasure of the Scriptures**.

We, the subjects, **surrender our bodies, our spirits, and our lives**, prostrate our heads to the earth, and with this incense-twisting **merit/power**, we **dedicate it to the nine ancestral generations of our family**, the **seven ancestral deities of divine mien**, past and present kinsfolk, and departed loved ones. May we **humbly pray** that the **Golden Scriptures decree longevity**, the **Jade Repository** present offerings to the **spirits**, the **Spiritual Treasury** be congealed in **yellow clouds**, the **Celestial Gate** give birth to **purple portals**, that **old impurities be cleansed and new vitality renewed**, ascending to the **Crimson Court**. May **blessings and benefits** be shared among **a hundred generations**, and may **abundant grace** extend to **future descendants**.

Now, the **burning of incense** is done in homage to the **Scripture-Embodied Great Saint**, the **Supreme Assembly of the Most True Virtue/Power**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**, may one **ascend to the Formless Realm**, and may **harmony** abide with the **True Dao/Way**. With this **midday Dao/Way practice**, the **Assemblies of the Law** are invoked, and thus we offer **three twists of incense**, hoping this **incense-cloud** may rise and ascend through the heavens, to **venerate the Celestial Lord of the Ten Directions** and the **Treasure of the Teachers**.

We, the subjects, **surrender our bodies, our spirits, and our lives**, prostrate our heads to the earth, and with this incense-twisting **merit/power**, we **dedicate it to our family’s elders and young, high and low**, kinsfolk and loved ones, the **Three Officials** in purity, the **Nine Portals** in radiant clarity, the **Eight Auspicious Scenes** in flourishing form, and the **Seven Primordial Elements** in harmonized **qi**. May we **bring forth the unadulterated joy of the Pure Capital**, and **greatly match the vast felicity**; may we **fulfill the sincere intention of divine communion**, and **manifestly augment the sacred calculations**.

The Five Phases are invoked to summon the might of the **Fire Virtue/Power**,
The Eight Trigrams are arranged to pray for deliverance from the **Li Palace**’s trials.
Withdrawing and abandoning this place, the **Returning Star** shall not arrive.

Now, through the burning of incense, we **surrender ourselves to the Teacher-Lord’s** most exalted and true **virtue/power**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we shall forever preserve **long life**, harmonizing with the **Dao’s** true essence.

**Repentance**, **commanding demons**, three **invocations**, three **rites**—
We **reaffirm our sacred station**.
We, the **officer of rank** [name], along with the **officiants at the altar**, humbly and sincerely petition:
The **Three Pure Ones** of **Primordial Void-Naturalness**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Nine Sovereigns Most Exalted**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’** **Great Lawmaster of Mystic Center**, the **Supreme True One of Fire Virtue/Power**, the **Responsive Ones of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**.

We have heard:
The **Celestial Luster** spreads its radiance, towering above the **Great Emptiness**;
The **Stars of the Dipper** encircle the **Polar Axis**, enthroned in the **Boundless Void**.
They **govern transformation** and **propagate essence**, **assist creation** and **disseminate virtue/power**,
Subduing the **Ten Thousand Demons** of the **Three Realms**, arraying the **Lunar Lodges** in the **Heavens**.
They **proclaim the true function**, universally **delivering all beings**.

The **officiant** [name], though dwelling in the **Dao’s** shelter and ranked among humanity,
Reflects on his **single thread of insignificance**, yet still basking in the **Three Celestial’s** glow.
Yet bound by the **colored body’s** shackles, **deluded thoughts** persist unchecked,
Drowning in the **field of profit-loss**, lost in the **realm of love-hate**.
Knowing the **internal heat’s** peril, he must avoid the **self-immolation’s** doom,
Fearful of the **Returning Star’s** unforeseen wrath, thus **preemptively** **petitions and accuses**.

This **morning of the Valley**, we establish this **unique ritual**,
With **heart-intent** refined, **incense-flowers** fragrant,
Reciting the **Hidden Melodies of the Jade Scrolls**, chanting the **Empty Songs of the Jade Ledger**,
Unwearied through endless days, hoping to reach the **High True Ones’** ears.

May the **Multitudes of True Ones** descend in response, their blessings ever-growing.
**Plagues** shall be **cleansed before manifestation**, spirits **unable to harm**;
**Calamities** shall be **warded before arrival**, **fire** shall **not become disaster**.
Thus, the **villages and wards** shall all be **secure**, households **preserved in prosperity**.
All **offenses** shall be **forever extinguished**, **ten thousand calamities** shall **not approach**,
So that **doorways flourish**, **lives receive deliverance**.
May **generations** thrive, **children and grandchildren** endure;
Through **aeons**, may it **last eternally**, from **this day to ancient times**.
The **True Root** shall **not be obscured**, **deluded thoughts** all **eradicated**.

**Upper Petition for the Emperor’s** brilliance to match **Xī’s** and **Hòu’s** splendor,
For **Nóng** and **Huáng** to follow **Zhuó’s** footsteps,
Ascending **Ào’s Peak** in equal **fortune**, expanding the **Peng’s Sea** to **lengthen years**.
May the **Empress, Consorts, and Princes** **stabilize the Great Treasure**,
**Literati and Martials** **support the Bright Foundation**.
May the **Two Symbols** later **radiate in harmony**, the **Three Lights** **remain true and upright**,
The **Fragrant Winds** **conform to rhythm**, the **Harmonious Qi** **regulate the seasons**.
May **agricultural labors** accumulate in the **capital’s plains**, **people’s customs** **ascend to **Ren’s Longevity**.
The **Three Attendants and Nine Nights**, **moving, growing, flying, and sinking**—
All shall **equally share the boundless grace**, **together fulfill the true fruit’s promise**,
Above **manifesting the Celestial Lord’s** **Great Compassion**, below **matching our subjects’** **earnest sincerity**.
Humbly **petitioned and reported**.

**Twelve Petitions** completed.
**Relighting the censer**.

**Incense Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, the **Attendant Spirit Officials**—
Let them **cause** where we **previously performed the midday Dao-work**,
**Naturally** generating **golden elixir and jade-green**, **mushrooms and hundred-spirits’** **essences**,
**True Ones** gathering—**here**, before this **incense-fire censer**.
May the **Ten-Directional Celestial Children and Jade Maidens** **attend the orchid-scented smoke**,
**Transmit our previous petitions** swiftly to the **Direct Presence of the Supreme True One of Boundless Dao**, before the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**.

**Exit the Hall in Praise**.
**Exit the Door**.

Conduct the Dao-affairs upon the elevated platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Law.
Proclaim the Sacred Spirit Incantations.

The Five Stars shine resplendent,
Auspicious qi ascends in flight.
The Primordial Gathering of Spirits,
Heaven and Earth in harmonious cycle.
Jade Talismans and Sacred Seals,
Summoned by the Whispered Command of the Profound.
Hurl the Fire, Display the Might—
Wickedness and malevolence have no refuge.
Ten Thousand Demons cower subdued,
Chaotic omens disperse.
Monstrous evils crushed, malevolence extinguished,
Dao-qi circulates universally.
Divine Light illuminates the night,
Darkness and obscurity vanish.
Ten Thousand Spirits descend in order,
Waving banners, bearing the wind.
All living beings prosper,
Grace pervades the Land of God—
In harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.

**Strike the Law-Drum twenty-four times.**

The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Originator of the Three Qi,
The Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Laozi,
Summon forth from within my body the Three Five Functionaries,
Left and Right Officials and Messengers,
Left and Right Incense-Bearers,
Postal Dragon Cavalry Clerks,
Attendant Golden Boys,
Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens,
The Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans,
Direct-Day Incense Officials—
Each thirty-six in number—**to emerge**.

Those who emerge must don resplendent attire,
Crowns and sashes with trailing ribbons,
Opening the Mysterious Daoist Altars of Land and Domain,
Inviting the territorial and divine spirits of the region.

Now, in this quiet night of Dao-work,
I humbly petition with sincere intent.
My earnest devotion is recorded and reported.
May the Most High Dao-qi of the Ten-Directional True Ones descend,
The Sacred Treasure Light of Auspiciousness flow into my body,
So that my petition may swiftly reach the Direct Presence of the Supreme True One of Boundless Dao,
Before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault.

**Invoke the Law-Position.**

With my rank and name, I and the assembled officials
Solemnly present our sincere petition to:
The Void-Natural Primordial Heavenly Venerable,
The Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Laozi,
The Most High Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault,
The Purple Cloud Heavenly Sovereign Emperor,
The Purple Cloud North Pole Emperor,
The Sacred Ancestor Heavenly Venerable Emperor,
The Earthly Sovereign of the Rear Soil,
The Great Saintly Mother of the Primordial Heaven,
The Ten-Directional Boundless Dao,
All Heavenly Emperors,
The Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mysterious Middle,
The Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord of the Rounded Canopy,
The Star Lords of the Manifested and Transformed,
The Sovereigns of the Thick Earth Caverns and Mountain-Spirit Altars,
The Southern Fire Department Officials of the Vermilion Position (Homogeneous and Fire Branches),
The Three Realms of Responsive Spirits,
All True and Sacred Spirits.

I have heard that the Yang-Spirit manifests auspiciousness,
The Fire Virtue inherits Heaven,
Dividing the solar domain to perpetuate brightness,
Commanding the Vermilion Quarter to establish position.
Thus, it governs the summer calendar,
To rectify the annual functions.
Hence, it ascends and descends through the Crimson Expanse,
Circulating the Yellow Dao,
Responding to its appointed time without fail,
Manifesting without partiality.

Though it suspends the celestial symbols for the sake of the nation,
Its disasters and blessings also extend to all living beings.
We, though favored by divine grace,
Dwelling in this prosperous age,
Have yet to purify our hearts and refine our essence,
Retreat to the misty peaks,
Mingling in the turbid world, conforming to mundane affairs.
Yet, to aid humanity and the state,
To rescue beings as our priority—
All who seek sincerity must be elevated in response.
How much more so when we present our heartfelt words,
Daring not to withhold them—
Thus, we solemnly proclaim our petition.

**Proclaim the Petition.**

As the words declare,
The sincerity is fervent and urgent.
When questioned, it is indeed so—
When examined, it does not stray.

It is reported that in the lofty vault above,
The profound and subtle realm,
The Fire Virtue shines resplendent—
The Imperial Response is the Quail Star.
Counting the Earth-Two Spirit’s power,
Its influence grows ever stronger;
Positioned at the Vermilion Bright’s apex,
Its eminence is unmatched.

Earth generates Metal, emerging from the Tiger Hour, entering the Dog Hour,
Examining the hot and cold to discern concealment and manifestation,
Observing the celestial symbols to distinguish calamity and blessing.
In its appointed duties, it is rewarded with the honor of the sacrificial feast;
When supplicating for relief from illness, it demands the solemnity of incense and fire.

Though we are but humble mortals,
Ever indebted to the True Ones’ grace,
We have long harbored the resolve of the deep ice,
Offering the sincerity of the wolf and badger,
Reverently consulting the secret texts,
Humbly presenting our clear offerings.

Now, in this quiet night of Dao-work,
I request the assembled Law-Masters to light the first pinch of incense.
May this incense-cloud ascend to the heavens,
Offering to the Most High Three Venerables.
We devote our bodies, our spirits, our fates,
Prostrating with our heads to the ground,
Supplicating the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord.

We humbly pray that You temporarily abandon Your mansion,
To preside over this assembly from afar.
With crimson banners and scarlet flags,
Purple mists and red clouds,
Sacred flames converging,
The fierce spirits in attendance.
Radiant at the celestial threshold,
Nurturing all beings.
The clear wind blazes forth,
Illuminating the void.
When You descend, blessings follow—
Where disaster lingers, it departs;
Where none arrive, they come.
Golden embers and orchid incense,
Illuminating the nine abysses of darkness;
Sandalwood smoke and jade waters,
Driving away the misfortunes of unvirtuous times.

We earnestly hope that the Great Fire flows in tranquility,
That the Gradual Departure is banished,
Joining the Five Phases in auspiciousness,
Warding off the Three Scorches with no fear,
Raising the hundred blessings of cessation,
Returning to the multitude of virtuous scholars,
Obscure yet vast—this humble heart.

Now, we burn this incense,
Solemnly devoting ourselves to the Dao-Venerable Great Saints’ True Essence.
After attaining the Dao,
We preserve Heaven’s longevity,
In harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.

Now, in this quiet night of Dao-work,
I request the assembled Law-Masters to light the second pinch of incense.
May this incense-cloud ascend to the heavens,
Offering to the Most High Three Venerables.
We devote our bodies, our spirits, our fates,
Prostrating with our heads to the ground,
With this pinch of incense’s merit,
Supplicating the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord,
Whose void contains the Vermilion,
Embodying the Water-Stilling Virtue;
Whose essence is the Sun’s crystal,
Embracing the Moon’s generation and transformation.

With bitterness nurturing sweetness,
Ever bound by propriety,
Our pious sincerity is answered,
Illuminating without partiality.

We earnestly hope that the ancestral altars and sacred spirits,
The ancestral halls and forefathers,
May delight in the Vermilion Palace,
Attest to the Vermilion Court,
Flow their blessings upon the Imperial Map,
Perpetuate the Great Undertaking,
Flourish for ten thousand years,
Gathering a thousand auspicious signs.

Now, we burn this incense,
Solemnly devoting ourselves to the Scripture-Venerable Great Saints’ True Essence.

---

After attaining the Dao, ascending into the Formless,
And harmonizing with the True Essence of the Way.

Now, in this tranquil night of Daoic practice,
We humbly request the gathered assembly to perform these three incense offerings,
May this incense smoke ascend and billow,
Piercing the heavens to venerate the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** [太上三尊].
We, the subjects, **return our bodies, spirits, and fates** [皈身、皈神、皈命],
Bow our heads to the earth in reverence,
And with these incense merits, **solemnly invoke the Great Saint Fire Star Law-Enforcing True Lord** [大圣火星执法真君].

May we **hide from the dreadful radiance and light** [藏烜惧威光],
So as not to incur the **fault of harming the gate or fish** [不致侵门害鱼之咎];
May we **beg to halt the fierce and violent manifestations** [乞止赫烈形势],
And forever **avoid the calamity of burning stables and injuring people** [永无焚厩伤人之忧].
Before any **evil arises**, may all **auspicious signs manifest** [凶悉未萌，吉皆来兆],
Our prayers heard without error, our requests granted upon sight [闻祈不忒，见请皆从].

Moreover, we earnestly hope that for our household,
The **Vermilion Talismans** [丹箓] may **ward off disasters** [祛灾],
That **Pure Virtue** [清都] may **bestow blessings** [介福],
Our family’s **prosperity may flourish** [家门叶泰],
And our **benevolent thoughts may renew** [善念惟新].
Within the **gathered assembly of the Daoic scriptures** [旁周品汇之中],
All may **align with the wondrous constancy of the True** [俱契真常之妙].

Now, we burn this incense,
And **devote ourselves to the Virtue of the Scripture-Venerable Great Saints** [自归依经尊大圣众至真之德].
After attaining the Dao, we **forever preserve peace and tranquility** [永保平康],
And harmonize with the True Essence of the Way.

Three **invocations**, three **reverences** [三启，三礼].
We **repeatedly proclaim the sacred Daoic ranks** [重称法位].
We, the subjects of all **Daoic stations** [具位臣某], along with the **officers attending the altar** [与临坛官众],
Solemnly **offer our sincere prayers**:
To the **Supreme Three Pure Ones and Saints** [太上三清上圣],
To the **Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Vault** [昊天玉皇上帝],
To the **Nine Sovereigns of Ultimate Reverence** [九皇至尊],
To the **Ten Directions’ Scripture-Venerable Saints** [十方上圣],
To the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mystic Dao** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],
To the **Fire-Deity Supreme True One** [火德上真],
To the **Three Realms’ Responsive True Spirits** [三界应感],
And to **All True Spirits** [一切真灵].

We, the subjects, have heard that **misconduct in human affairs** [滥处人伦]
And **erroneous residence in the sacred age** [缪居圣世],
Fortunately **received the nurturing grace of the Numinous Treasures** [幸承灵宝荫育],
And **glimpsed the true Daoic teachings** [得睹蕊笈真科].

We know that **blessings arise from virtue, calamities from licentiousness** [有福善祸淫],
And that **they originate from the intentions of the heart** [在操心之所致].
We fear that if one **believes in falsehoods and reverses one’s vision** [信邪倒见],
They may **fail to repent and return to the Dao** [莫反念以归依].

Only the **Supreme Most High** [无上之元尊],
Through **marvelous Daoic methods of the provisional** [假有为之妙法],
Has **manifested in sacred scriptures** [昭垂经典],
And **forever enlightens the obscured and ignorant** [永觉昏蒙],
**Warding off calamities even before their signs appear** [禳於未兆之间],
So that **there may be no regret for past deeds** [安有追前之悔].

Now, the **Daoic official** [醮官] humbly **devotes himself to the Great Dao** [投诚大道],
And **earnestly supplicates all the heavens** [沥恳诸天].
We **often reflect upon our own unawareness** [每惟自不觉知],
And how **small transgressions may lead to great consequences** [渐小愆而致甚].
We **constantly worry about shifting fate and cosmic cycles** [常忧变更运数],
Or that **accumulated karmic deeds may prove inescapable** [或积业以难逃].

Day and night, we **never cease in our vigilance** [夙夜靡遑],
And **our actions and retreats are guided by reflection** [行藏在念].
We **consider the seven treasures and five grains** [七珍五谷],
Lest they **bring accumulated harm and misfortune** [虑有积而不散之非].
We **fear for the six livestock and two silkworms** [六畜二蚕],
For their **extreme abundance may invite retribution** [恐昭物极恶盈之罪].

Now, we **present these humble Daoic rites** [陈菲薄醮礼],
And **pray to the Upholder of the Fire Star** [祷谢荧惑星君],
**Reverently following the rules of the Celestial Gate** [恭按阙伯之规模],
And **hoping to fulfill the benevolent response of Duke Jing** [愿遂景公之仁感].

We **take pity on this humble reverence** [悯兹惕若],
And **grant it peace and security** [锡以安然],
So that our **neighborhoods may know no sudden disasters** [里域无卒暴之惊],
And our **abodes may rest in tranquil comfort** [居止有清闲之慰].

In **all four seasons**, we **enjoy serenity** [四时宁谧],
And in **the eight festivals**, we **rejoice with delight** [八节欣怡].
We **extinguish the improper light of lamps and candles** [绝灯烛非次之光],
And **quell the unusual flames of stoves and hearths** [息炉灶殊常之焰].

We **extend this blessing universally to all households** [普及各门],
Bringing **peace and prosperity to every realm** [康泰一境],
**Purifying and harmonizing** [澄清], so that **all may dwell in virtuous contentment** [乐业],
And **reside in tranquility and embrace benevolence** [安居怀仁].
We **sincerely pray for the flourishing of goodness** [率善上愿],
May the **Two Principles** [二仪] **shine in harmony** [昭泰],
The **Three Illuminations** [三景] **radiate in splendor** [辉华],
The **nine grains** [九谷] **prosper abundantly** [滋丰],
The **five weapons** [五兵] **be sheathed in restraint** [韬戢],
And the **Dragon Spirits** [龙神] **stand guard in vigilance** [警卫],
So that **plagues and poisons may not intrude** [疫毒无侵].
For those **who plan their livelihood**, may they **find ease and joy** [谋生遂安逸之欢],
And for those **dwelling in the wilds**, may they **sing in celebration** [在野有讴歌之乐].

May **all things rise and fall in accordance with nature** [飞沉遂性],
And **movement and growth flourish in harmony** [动植舒荣].
May the **Nine Nights of Illumination** [九夜开光] **be fulfilled**,
And the **Three Paths of Judgment** [三途] **cease their demands** [罢对].
May we **witness the boundless responses of the Great Dao** [见大道无方之应],
And **fulfill the prayers that invoke the enlightened Saints** [契圣明有感之祈].

We **extend this grace to the distant and obscure** [普及幽遐],
All may **ascend to the shores of blessings** [俱升福岸],
Above **manifesting the Celestial Sovereign’s vast compassion** [上明天尊大慈之泽],
Below **fulfilling our subjects’ sincere devotion to the Dao** [下副臣等皈命之诚].
We **reverently present these prayers and report them** [谨启以闻].

**Twelve Prayers** [十二愿].
**Return to the Furnace** [复炉].
The **Incense Officials and Messengers** [香官使者],
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** [左右龙虎君],
And the **Attendant Spirits of the Incense** [侍香诸灵官],
Should **command that in our subjects’ former places of Daoic practice** [臣向来静夜行道之所],
There **naturally arise golden elixirs, dan-blue jade waters** [自然生金液丹碧],
And **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** [芝英百灵].
May the **gathered True Spirits** [众真交会]
Assemble **before this incense furnace** [在此香火炉前].

May we **pray that the Ten Directions’ Immortal Children and Jade Maidens** [十方仙童玉女],
**Attend to the fragrant smoke** [接侍兰烟],
And **transmit our subjects’ former prayers** [传臣向来所启],
**Swiftly reaching the Celestial Vault of the Jade Sovereign** [速达径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].

**Exit the Hall and Chant** [出堂颂].
**Exit the Doorway** [出户].

「The Complete Daoist Ritual Regulations, Volume Thirty-Four concluded. Volume Thirty-Five begins.

Compiled by the **Three Caverns** [三洞] Ritual and Precept Disciple, Zhòng Lì [仲励].

**Ritual of the Oath-Fire for Averting Disasters** [誓火禳災儀]

The **ritual proceedings ascend the platform** [法事升坛] as prescribed. Each pays homage to the **Master of the Precepts** [師] with reverent devotion in accordance with the **Way** [法].

**Proclaim the Sacred Incantations** [宣衛靈咒] to safeguard the **Way** [道].

The **Five Stars** [五星] align and radiate their brilliance, illuminating the **Five Directions** [五方].
The **Water Star** [水星] repels calamity,
The **Wood Virtue** [木德] brings prosperity.
**Yinghuò** [荧惑, Mars] dissipates misfortune,
**Tàibái** [太白, Mercury] wards off war.
**Zhènxīng** [镇星, Jupiter] holds firm in fourfold dominion,
Benefiting **family and state** [家国].
Their names are inscribed on **jade tablets** [玉简],
Their decrees recorded in the **Imperial Archives** [帝房].
They ride the **tempests and disperse the mists** [乘飙散景],
Ascending and descending the **vast void** [飞腾太空].
Entering and exiting the **dark and formless** [出入冥无],
They traverse and revel in the **Ten Directions** [游宴十方].

The **Five Clouds** [五云] float as banners,
Summoning **divine spirits** [招神] and restraining the **winds** [摄风].
They **command and subdue the myriad spirits** [役使万灵],
Guarding the **Immortal Sage** [上卫仙翁],
In harmony with the **True Dao** [和与道合真].

**Sound the Daoic Drum** [鸣法鼓] **twenty-four times** [二十四通].

We now **invoke the Supreme Three Heavens’** [无上三天] **Primordial Origin of the Dao** [玄元始三炁],
The **Supreme Dao Lord** [太上道君],
The **Supreme Old Lord** [太上老君],
And **summon forth** [召出] from within our subjects’ bodies the **Thirty-Five Officials of the Dao** [身中三五功曹],
The **Left and Right Officials and Messengers** [左右官使者],
The **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** [左右捧香],
The **Dragon-Courier and Mounted Attendants** [驿龙骑吏],
The **Golden Boys Attending the Incense** [侍香金童],
The **Jade Maidens of the Transmitted Words and Scattered Flowers** [传言散花玉女],
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans** [五帝直符],
And the **Direct-Day Incense Officials** [直日香官],
Each **thirty-six in number** [各三十六人], to appear.

Those who emerge are **arrayed in solemn, resplendent garments** [严装显服],
With **headdresses and sashes trailing their ribbons** [冠带垂缨],
Opening the **Mysterious Daoic Altars** [关启玄坛] to the **Land Spirits** [土地] and **Divine Sovereigns of the Regions** [方域神真].

Our subjects now **establish this Daoic Feast** [今设醮行道],
And **solemnly present this invocation** [谨奏为入意],
Having already **recorded and transmitted** [已录告闻] the **sincere intentions** [诸诚意].
May we **obtain the Supreme Dao’s** [太上十方至真道炁] **blessed light and luminous treasures** [灵宝瑞光],
Descending and **flowing into our subjects’ bodies** [下降流入臣身中],
That our subjects’ prayers may **swiftly reach the Celestial Vault of the Jade Sovereign** [令臣所启速达径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].

**Request the proclamation of the Daoic ranks** [请称法位].

In full assembly, our subjects **so-and-so** [某] and the **officiating officials** [临坛官众],
**Together present this sincere invocation** [谨同诚上启] to:

The **Primordial Origin of the Jade Sovereign of the Natural Void** [虚无自然元始天尊],
The **Supreme Dao Lord** [太上大道君],
The **Supreme Old Lord** [太上老君],
The **Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Vault** [昊天玉皇上帝],
The **Grand Sovereign of the Purple Cluster** [紫微天皇大帝],
The **Grand Sovereign of the Northern Polarity** [紫微北极大帝],
The **Divine Ancestor, Sovereign of the Dao** [圣祖天尊大帝],
The **August Land Spirit, Earthly Sovereign** [后土皇地祇],
The **Primordial Great Sage, Empress of Heaven** [元天大圣后],
The **Dao of the Ten Directions’ Limitless Extent** [十方无极大道],
The **Sovereigns of All Heavens** [诸天天帝],
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, Master of the Mysterious Central Dao** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],
The **True Lord of the Dao Who Executes the Law of the Fire Star in the Round Dome** [圆穹上象火星执法真君],
The **Manifested and Transformed Celestial Hosts and Star Lords** [所变所化、列宿星君],
The **Sovereigns of the Earthly Caverns and Mountainous Altars** [厚地洞天、岳渎主宰],
The **Officials of the Southern Fire Position, Ranked Homogeneous and Heterogeneous** [南方离位丙丁巳午火部官属],
The **Three Realms of Response and Sensation** [三界应感],
And **all True Spirits** [一切真灵].

Our subjects **hear** that the **Great Dao is profound and mysterious** [大道玄妙],
The **origin of the Supreme Ultimate** [混成太极之初];

That the **Ultimate Truth is naturally so** [至真自然],
The **ancestor of Heaven and Earth** [悼为天地之祖].

With **mechanisms and powers of transformation** [机权造化],
They **open and close the yin and yang** [开阖阴阳],
Dividing the **Eight Trigrams** [八卦] to nurture all forms,
Establishing the **Four Seasons** [四时] to fulfill all gatherings.

Thus, the **Yang** resides in the **Great Summer** [大夏],
As the **region of long cultivation** [长养之方];
The **Southern Fire** responds in **divine resonance** [南讹],
Focusing on the **matters of transformation and nourishment** [化育之事].

Therefore, the **Flame Emperor governs the Celestial Vault** [炎帝御宇],
And **Yinghuò** [荧惑] **oversees the region** [司方],
Dividing the **Five Affairs** [五事] in the **ritual texts** [礼文],
And **specializing in the Fourfold governance of Fire** [专四方之火政].

Sometimes they **appear and then suddenly vanish** [或当见而忽伏],
Sometimes they **withdraw and then reemerge** [或既缩而复盈].
Their **changes are not constant** [其变不常],
All for the sake of **manifesting just punishments** [皆为明罚].

「Now the **Ritual Master of the Dao** [醮官] **reverently presents** [某严陈] **ancient precedents** [故事],
Devoting himself solely to the **Yang Spirit** [阳灵],
Aligning with the **Fire Star’s proper season** [火之正时],
Repaying the **radiant virtue of the Fire Deity** [报离明之盛德],
Inviting **Daoist companions** [道侣] to gather,
Strictly adhering to the **auspicious timing** [冲科],
Formally establishing the **ritual altar** [坛场],
And earnestly summoning the **celestial winds and chariots** [飙驭].

**Humbly praying** [伏愿],
That the **Imperial Chariot** [帝车] **arrives swiftly** [接轸],
From the **Tiger Pass and the Celestial Gates** [虎关阊阖];
That the **Star Chariot** [星驭] **moves in harmony** [交骖],
Descending from the **Lion’s Tail and the Hooked Array** [豹尾勾陈].

The **sacrificial wine** [涧苹] is offered,
And the **libations** [浻酌] are made in solemnity [有严].

With **deepest reverence and longing** [无任瞻望激切屏营之至],
I twice bow and gaze toward the clouds,
To **reverently welcome the Celestial Procession** [奉迎仙驾].

**Descending the Sage** [降圣],
**Offering tea** [献茶],
First **presenting** [初献], then **scattering flowers** [散花].

I now **solemnly and sincerely** [谨虔诚] **report to** [上启],
The **Supreme Three Pure Ones** [太上三清],
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault** [玉帝],
The **Jade Sovereign of the Supreme Heaven** [昊天玉皇],
And the **Three Realms’ responsive spirits** [三界应感],
All **true and genuine essences** [一切真灵].

I have heard that the **Great Sun** [太阳] **divides its light** [分景],
This is the **Star of Yinghuò** [荧惑之星];
The **Virtue of Fire** [离德] **declares its essence** [宣精],
It is also called the **Son of the Vermilion Sovereign** [赤帝之子].

It **ascends eighty myriads of li** [八十万里] **and radiates colors** [腾彩],
And **spans over a hundred days** [一百余日] **to complete its celestial cycle** [周天].

Wherever it **remains or departs** [居留],
It **certainly shapes calamities or blessings** [必形灾福].
When it **disturbs the natural order** [乱常],
It serves as a **warning against corrupt governance** [以戒昏政];
When it **follows its appointed course** [循度],
It **clearly marks the passage of time** [以表明时].

When it **converges with the Five Stars** [同五星聚],
The world **unifies in harmony** [而天下咸归];
When it **aligns with the Four Stars** [与四星合],
The **rulers receive congratulations** [而王者受庆].

Should **chaos and disorder arise** [亡乱],
And **virtue be lost** [失德],
Then its **fluctuations** [盈缩] **become erratic** [无常].

Gazing upward at the **Celestial Patterns of Heaven** [乾文],
The **divine records of calamities** [灾数] **are preserved** [皇存].

When it **converges with the Year Star** [合岁星], there will be **famine** [则饥馑];
When it **aligns with the Great White Star** [合太白], there will be **upheaval and migration** [则播迁];
When it **unites with the Earth Star** [与土合], governance **becomes increasingly misaligned** [则政益乖];
When it **joins with the Star of the Hour** [与辰合], the **armies fare poorly** [则兵不利];
When the **moon eclipses its mansion** [月蚀其宫], there will be **war and strife** [则为战乱];
When the **heart of the star deviates from its course** [心孛其度], there will be **conflagration and burning** [则主燎焚].

Only by **cultivating virtue** [修德] can such calamities be **warded off** [可禳],
And by **self-reflection and reverence** [省躬而知畏].

Though **celestial cycles and omens** [运数] **concern the fate of nations** [关於国论],
**Calamities and auspices** [灾祥] are **indeed bound to the people’s lives** [寔系於民生].

The **Dao Master** [醮主] of humble name, deeply concerned by accumulated karma inviting calamity, humbly composed this supplication and petitioned for divine favor. With reverence, I dare to unfold my sincere words before the **Celestial Assembly** [法席], and now solemnly proclaim them.

**Proclamation of the Supplication:**

As the words declare, my sincerity is profound and earnest.

The Dao Master, born in this age of wondrous transformation, has long revered the **True Wind** [真风]. Now, at the height of summer’s heat, the **Mars** [荧惑] traverses its degree. Though I have always relied upon **virtue** [德], my heart has long held **awe and reverence** [祇畏]. Yet when disasters arise, I must invoke the **preemptive rites of warding** [预禳之典].

I recite the **secret incantations of the Precious Scripture** [宝经], reveal the **true characters of the Cloud Sigil** [云篆], and present the **wondrous patterns** [妙范] in full array, with all rites meticulously observed. **Heaven and humanity interact**, relying upon the **sublime essence** [精祲] to incline in devotion; the **ritual implements are abundant**, and the **fragrant offerings ascend in splendor** [馨香之昭格].

With the **multitudes of the True Ones** [众真] in attendance, I gaze upon the **Celestial Sovereign’s lofty seat** [上帝之端居], my single mind devoted in reverence, as the **hundred spirits converge**.

I humbly pray that the **Dragon Banner and Phoenix Canopy** [龙旗凤葆] may open **auspicious blessings** [休祥] upon the lower realms, and that the **Sun’s Chariot and Radiant Clouds** [日毂霞车] may amplify the **sublime might of the Celestial Officials** [炎官之威烈].

Your servants, overwhelmed by this petition for grace, now present the **first offering of wine**.

**Scatter flowers.**

I have heard that **diligence in ending as one begins** [谨终如始] is the foundation of human conduct, and that **fearing calamity while turning to virtue** [惧灾向善] is the natural order. Life’s formation depends upon **Heaven and Earth** [乾坤], and all motion and stillness are governed by **Water and Fire** [水火].

**Yin and Yang** [阴阳] form the cosmic framework, overseeing **spirit and vital essence** [魂魄]. In winter, they govern affairs through the **Hour Star** [伺辰], and in summer, they wield authority through **Mars** [荧惑].

Now, in this ninth month of summer, the **Three Stars** [三星] appear in the twilight. How could one not recognize that the **cyclical records of the ancient sages** [阏伯之纪时] align with the **procession of Zhurong** [祝融之行度]?

The Dao Official, reflecting upon my mundane existence and my place among humanity, kindles fire by day and lights the **Dao’s lamp** [烛道] by night. Though my actions depend upon **human flame**, I may yet fall prey to **celestial disaster** [天灾].

The **impartial virtue** [无私之德] is boundless, yet common folk ever fear their **transgressions** [有过之民]. With utmost sincerity, I purify my **community altar** [祓社], heeding the **exhaustive rites of Zheng Xia** [郑侨之尽礼], yet I lack the **insight of the Fire Official’s omens** [裨灶之知天].

I now unfold the **secret scriptures** [秘典] once more, bearing my wishes before the **Lofty True Ones** [高真], hoping the **Heart Star** [心星] may retreat and restore the **Celestial Degrees** [天度] in the **high vault** [高穹], nurturing the **abundance of all things** [万物之丰成], so that all beings may **cross safely** [群生之共济].

May we **roast or boil our offerings** [可燔可炙] without fear of **poisonous winds** [扇毒之虞], and may we dwell and reside **without dread of shifting flames** [徙薪之虑].

Now, the **lotus lamps** [莲灯] flicker toward extinction, yet the **glowing sun’s remnants** [赫曜日之余光] persist. The **precious sigils** [宝篆] are fading, dissolving into the **light mist of floating clouds** [浮云之轻霭]. The **thousand True Ones** have gathered, and the **three offerings** [三献] have concluded.

The **Dragon returns to the Vermilion Celestial Heights** [丹霄], and the **Phoenix attendants** [鸾仗] prepare to withdraw to the **Crimson Palace** [绛阙]. Fearful of further presumption, I dare not linger beneath the **imminent celestial威**.

I further pray for **boundless compassion** [洪慈] to descend, granting **forgiveness and mercy** [宽贷].

Your servants, overwhelmed by this final petition, now present the **concluding offering of wine**.

**Scatter flowers.**

**Reaffirm the Dao’s station.**

The humble servant of lowly rank, **Dao Official** [醮官], now humbly reiterates this supplication to the **Nine Pure Ones, Supreme Saints** [九清上圣], and the **True Spirits of the Three Realms** [三界真灵].

Your servants have solemnly performed the **ritual of the sacred censer** [祭爟之仪] to purify the **original calamity** [燎原之厄].

To the **Supreme Saint of the Jade Capital** [玉京上圣], who receives the **auspicious radiance** [迂景] upon the **Purple Altar** [紫坛], and to the **Stars of the Southern Pole** [南极众星], who also incline their light upon the **embroidered seat** [黼座], we have already exhausted the **flowing wine offerings** [流霞之献] and now ascend the **bright candles’ glow** [明烛之辉].

Again, we pour out our **earnest prayers** [沥恳] before the **Heavenly Hosts** [诸天], beseeching the **cessation of calamity** [弭灾] from the **Celestial Symbols** [上象]. Having already unfolded the rites at **Mars’ degree** [荧惑之度], we now extend our **sincerity to the Variable Star** [变化之星].

Only the **residual light of the Law** [执法之余光] disperses the **flaming essence** [炎精] to demonstrate **divine retribution** [示罚].

The **Dawn Star** [析旦] grows strong in **sovereign governance** [君道], and **Zhaoming** [昭明] presides over **war and mourning** [兵丧]. **Chiyou’s banner** [蚩尤如旗] signals the **sovereign’s campaigns** [王者之征伐], while **Tian Chan** [天搀如剑] foretells the **slaying by generals** [将帅之杀伤]. **Si Wei** [司危] serves to **pacify discord** [平乖争], and the **Red Comet** [赤彗] wields **authority over extermination** [掌诛灭]. These are all **phenomena linked to the Sun** [附日而有象], yet there are also those **associated with the Moon** [因月而垂芒], such as the **Heavenly Obscuration** [天阴晋若] and the **Celestial Official’s Outbreak** [天惑官张].

The **Red Comet’s strange hues** [赤若异彩] and the **Heavenly Chui’s anomalous forms** [天崔殊形]—all are **officials of calamity** [灾厄之官], each with their **mandate of oversight** [照临之分].

When they descend, they become the **Wind Lord** [风伯]; when they manifest as deities, they are called the **Fire Spirits** [火精].

Their **flames and forces** [势焰] surge in tandem, their **portents and marvels** [光怪] intertwine. I pray that, under the **Celestial Sovereign’s Dao-essence** [天尊之道炁], the **residual might of the Fire Virtue** [火德之余威] may be fully harnessed.

May the **nation’s path be unburdened** [国步无艰], lest **martial might be unleashed upon the multitudes** [扬威於多垒]; may the **realm rejoice in prosperity** [邦家有庆], so that the **four classes may pursue their labors in harmony** [乐业於四民].

May there be no **small conflagrations consuming stables** [焚厩之小栽], nor **premonitory warnings of bandits on the roads** [表道之先警]. May the **summer rains arrive in season**, so that **epidemic miasmas** [沴气] do not arise, and may **Yin and Yang harmonize**, yielding **abundant harvests year after year** [年谷屡丰].

Yet I still fear the **Five Stars’ transgressions** [五星凌犯] and the **comets’逆流**, for if they appear in the **eastern quadrant of the Azure Dragon’s seven mansions** [青龙七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Green Emperor** [青帝真文] for **dissolution and warding** [解禳].

If the **Five Stars transgress and the Red Comet逆流** in the **southern quadrant of the Vermilion Bird’s seven mansions** [朱雀七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Red Emperor** [赤帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.

If the **Five Stars transgress and the White Comet逆流** in the **western quadrant of the White Tiger’s seven mansions** [白虎七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the White Emperor** [白帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.

If the **Five Stars transgress and the Black Comet逆流** in the **northern quadrant of the Dark Tortoise’s seven mansions** [玄武七宿分野], I beseech the **True Characters of the Black Emperor** [黑帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.

If the **Five Stars transgress and the Yellow Comet逆流** in the **central region of the Hooked Array’s Three Enclosures and the Imperial Seat of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars** [勾陈三垣帝座北斗七元星君], I beseech the **True Characters of the Yellow Emperor** [黄帝真文] for **dissolution and warding**.

May the **Emperor and Sovereign reign for ten thousand years** [帝主万年], their **lineage enduring a hundred generations** [本支百世]. May the **celestial patterns remain in order** [天文有序], and the **earthly cycles endure** [地纪常容]. May the **nation grow wealthy and families prosperous** [国富家康], the **times harmonious and the people flourishing** [时和俗阜].

Only then shall the **Dao Official and his household** [醮官某家等] find **spiritual peace and bodily ease** [神安体裕], their **fortunes extended and longevity assured** [益算延龄], their **blessings and merits renewed** [福禄维新], with **no return of misfortune** [凶衰不作], their **kinfolk thriving and their dwellings serene** [眷属亨泰，所止肃清], their **towns and villages at rest** [井邑静安], and their **regions in tranquility** [方隅宁谧].

**Ritual of Invoking Fire and Exorcising Calamities with Three-Time Universal Repentance**

**Dawn of Purity**

We, Your servants, with utmost sincerity, **submit to the command of the Great Fire Star Exorcist True Lord of the Southern Realm** [南方大圣火星执法真君],
the attendant spirit officials and celestial ministers,
the star court deities and all spirit officials.

We, Your servants and followers, humbly hear that **the Celestial Sovereign’s will is unfathomable** [上帝匪忱],
and that **the Dao does not discriminate in its judgments** [道无私於降鉴].
**The Highly Pure respond to sincerity** [高真应感],
and **the divine is moved by genuine devotion** [诚自格於灵承].

Thus, we lay bare our sincere hearts,
and **supplicate the august creation** [仰干洪造].

We observe that **the stars align with their seasons** [纬星应候],
and that **Mars governs the vermilion brightness** [祀关伯於朱明].
The **celestial luminaries mark their positions** [列曜奠方],
and **Zhùróng is paired with the quail’s peak** [配祝融於鹑首].

In silence, they govern the celestial order,
and **hold supreme authority over transformation** [优持造化之权].
Their **manifestations are timely** [其伏见有时],
and their **auspicious or inauspicious signs are clear** [其吉凶有兆].
The heavens act without disorder,
and their responses are without favoritism.
If one harbors **reverence for the stern and the awe-inspiring** [严知畏之心],
then **uncommon blessings shall descend** [必降殊常之祉].

We, the Daoists of such-and-such lineage, are fortunate to dwell in an era of enduring peace,
and to **partake in the harmonious unity of the age** [膺保合之和].
The **Five Phases’ transformations** [化被五行]
and the **Six Ministries’ governance** [政修六府]
are in perfect order.

The **Fire Officials**, who **consume the heart and the pearl** [食心食珠],
and the **Fire Rectifiers**, who **take willow and sassafras** [取柳取槐],
adhere to the **four-seasonal laws** [法有四时之变].

The **qi and symbols harmonize in sequence** [象气交顺],
and **sincere devotion communicates with the divine** [精诚感通].
The **celestial alignment is auspicious** [运合升明],
and **no disasters or calamities arise** [祥无灾燀].

The **sounds echo the Flame Emperor’s order** [音阐炎帝之纪],
**upright and unerring** [充正而不乖];
the **origin of the Great Yin** [太阴之原]
**neither exceeds nor falls short** [无过与不及].

From the capital to the remotest lands,
**fire rituals are meticulously performed** [火焚具修],
and **seasonal offerings are duly made** [时令咸举].
Families fear **displaced hearths** [徙薪之虑],
and people suffer from **burning afflictions** [烂额之伤].

Thus, we **devote ourselves to the Golden Precepts** [刻意金科],
and **knock at the Jade Throne with sincere hearts** [叩心玉陛].
We present **elaborate pure offerings** [设苹繁之净供],
and **offer humble sincerity** [荐豺獭之微诚].
With **wholehearted devotion**, we submit to the command of:
the **Upper True Dao Lord of the Crimson Heavenly Realm** [南方离位丹天赤皇上真道君],
the **Fire Virtue Exorcist True Lord** [火德执法真君],
the **Lord of the Manifesting Dawn Star** [析变析旦昭明星君],
the **Lord of the Deceptive Star, Chiyou** [蚩尤司诡星君],
the **Lord of the Crimson Comet Star** [天搀赤彗星君],
the **Lord of the Dark Quail Star** [天阴晋若星君],
the **Lord of the Celestial Disruptive Star** [官张天惑星君],
the **Lord of the Crimson Ruinous Star** [赤若天崔星君],
and **all deities and spirits within the Great Fire Constellation**.

We humbly pray that the **Dao’s vision illuminate and protect** [道眼照临，灵威覆护],
that **the wandering star be guided along its path** [耀荧惑以循轨],
and that **the backflowing star bring blessings** [弭回禄而降休].
May **auspicious signs gather across ten thousand li** [千里储祥],
and **ten thousand households receive divine favor** [万家蒙佑].

May the people **live in peace and prosperity** [人民平泰],
free from **water, drought, pestilence, or famine** [无扎瘥水旱之殃];
may the **celestial patterns harmonize** [气运协和],
and **dispel the ominous brilliance of the sun’s variations** [消伏明赫曦之变].

Then shall the **lands be tranquil** [方隅宁静],
and the **residences secure** [居止镇安].
All shall **depend on the Dao’s shelter** [咸依道荫].

After attaining the Dao,
one **ascends to the Formless** [升入无形],
and **harmonizes with the True Dao** [和与道合真].

We, Your servants, humbly hear of the **crimson flames of the divine crossbow** [赤熛神弩],

Above, You **purify the radiant emotions of the Sun’s warmth** [上则洁阳燧感格之情],
and below, You **enforce the strict prohibitions of the Metal Bell** [下则严木铎修行之禁].
When **dikes fail or are lost** [堤防或失], Your **stern punishment descends from Heaven** [厉降自天];
when **mercy is extended or delayed** [延发有加], none **escape Your grace** [幸免无地].
We fear the **habit of reckless ignorance** [大惧昏顽之俗],
and the **unrepentant hearts that defy sacred prohibitions** [罔悛僭戒之心].
For Heaven **detests excess** [天恶其盈],
and the **Ghosts observe and impose retribution** [鬼瞰而罚].
May we **forever cease from burning ruin** [永惟焦头烂额而遏绝],
and instead **purify our thoughts and wash our hearts** [涤虑洗心而祷祠],
so that **repentance arises at the first stir** [悔悟一萌],
and **Your mercy shines like the depths of a mirror** [昭回渊鉴].
We, Your servants, **devote our lives to the Dao’s shelter** [捐躯道荫],
and **bow in reverence to Your True Benevolence** [稽首真慈].
Though we are **mere creatures like wolves or jackals** [豺獭报微],
we **dare not neglect Your inspection** [敢图省察];
though we are **humble as ants or crickets** [蝼蚁诚至],
we **all earnestly seek Your complete hearing** [咸冀彻闻].
We pray that **Your sacred radiance ascends to the celestial hour** [惟灵辉上次之辰],
and **Your divine chariot descends to the mortal realm** [与仙驭下游之分].
May You **relieve Your wrath and bestow hidden blessings** [望蠲威命],
so that **our homes are serene and our wells tranquil** [阴锡庬休，里闬清宁，井闾澄泰],
with **no fears of calamity** [不虞自息] and **no unintended offenses** [非意罔干].
In **wars and fires** [兵火灾伤], we **measure the perils of destruction** [寻度危亡之厄];
in **eclipses and winds and rains** [晦明风雨], we **rely on Your auspicious favor** [更叨利顺之功].
How could we **not submit in devotion** [敢不皈依] to repay Your **nurturing of all** [以酬化育]?

With **sincere hearts**, we **submit to the command of the South**:
**the True Sovereign of the Crimson Heaven** [南方离位丹天赤皇上真],
**the Dao-Master of the Fire Virtue** [道主火德荧惑星执法真君],
**the Celestial Spirits born of the Sun’s essence and Moon’s breath** [精炁所变传日旁月彗孛异星星君],
**and the divine officials among the stars** [星中神仙诸灵官].
May You **extend compassion to the world below** [垂慈人世],
**take pity on the common and lowly** [悯察凡庸],
**descend to the dusty realm** [俯降尘寰],
**oversee our earnest sincerity** [监斯诚悃],
**pour forth Your blessings and grant forgiveness** [流恩赐福，赦罪释愆],
**extinguishing the flames that spread like wildfire** [绝焰焰之燎原],
and **banishing the deceitful whispers of calamity** [无嘻嘻之妖语].
May **no birds cry at the sacrificial grounds of Mò** [鸟不鸣於亳社],
so that **our households may dwell in peace** [家以靖安];

so that **all may prosper in health** [人皆康阜].
May **the crows and magpies vanish** [鷝鴭消去],
**preventing baseless disasters** [预禳无妄之灾];
and may **the quails rest content** [鹑首居饮],
**reaping the joy of great fortune** [终获大来之庆].
After attaining the Dao,
one **ascends to the Formless** [升入无形],
and **harmonizes with the True Dao** [和与道合真].

**Quiet Night**

We, Your servants, humbly hear of the **Crimson Heaven’s Vermilion Palace** [丹天绛府],
which **holds dominion over life and death without favor** [掌生录以无私];
and the **Jade Palace of the South** [离位朱宫],
which **spreads the Sun’s radiant might** [布阳威而有赫].
You **emanate Your luminous essence to dispel darkness** [运灵芒而烛暗],
and **vigorously dispense Your pure *qi*** [腾正气以流辉].
All who dwell beneath Your light
**may follow and submit in reverence** [得遵皈仰].

Now, we, Your servants,
**present humble offerings of wild plants and clay** [择芹捧块],
and **bare our hearts and livers at the Vermilion Terrace** [露肝胆於朱陵].
With **pure intentions and tranquil hearts** [洁志清心],
we **invoke the clouds and mists at the Crimson Palace** [降云霞於赤府].
With **sincere devotion**, we **submit to the command of the South**:
**the Great Sage of Fire Virtue** [南方大圣火德上真荧惑星真君],
**the True Person among the stars** [星中真人],
**the Great God among the stars** [星中大神],
**the Celestial Spirits of the Star Palace** [星宫神仙],
**and the divine officials** [诸灵官].

We **earnestly pray that the Earth’s threefold return** [地回三舍]
**confirms the brilliance of past decrees** [验彰前典之中];
and that **the Dao’s praise ascends to the Nine Heavens** [道赞一人，珠贯九霄之上].
May Your **sacred insight turn back** [回圣鉴],
and **long observe our crimson sincerity** [久察丹诚].
May You **ascend upon the red mists and clouds** [蹑丹霞红雾以上流],
and **descend in the radiant crimson carriage** [拥绯饰明舆而下降].
May You **accept our earnest devotion** [纳斯垦悃],
and **grant us extraordinary blessings** [锡以殊祥],
**removing the disasters that plague our bodies** [祛身罹命偶之灾],
and **clearing the faults that arise from our words and deeds** [除口发心为之过].

May **the wild grasses and humble huts** [草茅生聚]
**enjoy the cooling of summer’s heat** [度暑景以清凉];
and may **the earthen and wooden dwellings** [土木形骸]
**align with the sequence of the Primordial Yang** [计元阳之气序].
May **every household be free from fear of flying embers** [比屋免飞烟之恐],
and **every connected roof unalarmed by fierce flames** [连甍无烈焰之惊].
May **all creatures alike** [普及群生]
**depend on the Great Transformation** [同依大化].

After attaining the Dao,
one **ascends to the Formless** [升入无形],
and **harmonizes with the True Dao** [和与道合真].

**Strike the Ritual Drum twenty-four times.**
**Ignite the Furnace.**
**Invoke the Law’s Titles.**

**The present officials and all others humbly unite with the assembled congregation of all officers, now offering incense in devotion. By this merit, we honor the Heavenly Sovereign, kings and princes, all ministers and officials, the land and territorial deities, scripture masters, and those who dwell in mountains and forests, cultivating the Dao and seeking True Immortality. We also honor all fellow students, the nine degrees of kin, and all people of the world—both living and sentient beings alike.**

**Now, with sincere hearts, we extend universal repentance. The undersigned and all disciples humbly submit our bodies, our spirits, and our lives to the Supreme Ten-Directional Numen, the Natural and Primordial Dao of Boundless Truth. We beseech thee to grant us forgiveness—ourselves and the officiating assembly—for all transgressions of past and present lives, freeing us from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings and Eight Hardships, and the Nine Calamities, that we may attain the Dao’s True Essence, traverse the void, ascend to Heaven in broad daylight, and attend upon the Dao Sovereign in the Boundless Golden Threshold and the Seven-Treasured Natural Palace, forever harmonizing with the Dao.**

**All petitions of Mysterious Grace are presented before the Supreme Dao of Boundless Truth.**
**Repentance is offered.**
**The Law’s Titles are solemnly invoked once more.**

**The present officials and all others, with united sincerity, hereby present our petition. To the Supreme Dao of Boundless Truth, the Primordial Celestial Venerable, the Supreme Dao Sovereign, the Supreme Lord of Old Age, the Jade Emperor of Augmented Heaven, the Great Imperial Sovereign of the Starry Enchen Court, the Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Celestial Pole, the Earthly Sovereign of the Five Empires, the Supreme Lord of Natural Earth, the Boundless Dao of Ten Directions, the Celestial Venerable of Moral Dao and Sacred Worthies, the Great Emperor of Supreme Truth, the Heavenly Emperor, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, and the Mysterious Master of the Central Dao—we humbly invoke thee, the Five Celestial Masters of Wuji and the True Spirit of Central Yellow.**

**In the Dragon and Han epochs, spanning countless kalpas, we were lost in the nameless chaos. When the Imperial Sovereign’s plan unfolded, the people’s customs were shaped by desire. The Primordial Dao divided its essence to respond to transformation, and the Divine Sacrificial Ox emerged with wisdom to awaken potential. After shifting from caves to dwellings, we raised beams and pillars. Through agriculture and cultivation, we gained the advantage of pestles and mortars; refining fur and blood, we found the utility of stoves and cauldrons. The Six Ministries were well-ordered, and the Three Hierarchies established. Thus, from the warmth of Yang and the chill of Yin, the harshness of Jia and the softness of Yi, life and death were hidden in the formless, and blessings and misfortunes concealed in the unfathomable. Only through the study of scriptures did we gradually perceive the ties of mundane existence.**

**Though we are but humble grass and insignificant dust, weak in nature and lowly in origin, we have been fortunate to inherit the lingering blessings of past ages and to encounter this enlightened time. Having secured a dwelling to reside in, we now earnestly seek the Heavenly Sovereign’s gracious favor, reverently observing the fasts and rites of purification, and giving thanks to the True Spirits.**

**As we have been entrusted with the office of the True Ministry and honored as leaders of the Dao, our duty is to propagate its teachings and our aspiration to establish merit. None who seek sincerity shall be left unanswered. Today, we present our heartfelt words and dare not withhold them. Our petition is now declared.**

**According to our words, we solemnly vow: We shall purify our five limbs with bathing, refine our six emotions, follow the rites for averting disasters and calamities, and perform the methods for securing a tranquil abode and harmonious dwelling. We arrange the altar as prescribed, and its design mirrors Heaven. With the offerings of the officiating household—silk, brocade, and devotional tokens—we pacify the Five Directions. With incense, flowers, lamps, and candles, we affirm our sincere and earnest resolve.**

**From this day forward, we establish this fast as its beginning. When the appointed time arrives and our petition is heard by the Supreme Truth, we shall pray for blessings and grace, for the peace of spirits and the resolution of offenses, all in accordance with the fast’s precepts. Previously, we have already presented our petition, and our gratitude is directed to the Supreme Three Venerables and the Ten-Directional Sacred Worthies, who deign to inspect and reflect upon our supplications. We now command the appointed inspectors, the land and territorial deities, to unite in heart, to join in strength, and to sweep away all impurities within and without. May the altar be cleansed and the path to the void be opened, that the True Saints may descend in response, granting our hearts tranquility and our spirits steadfastness. With our thoughts focused and our petitions heard, let our good deeds be fulfilled without obstruction.**

**On the following bright dawn, we shall continue our Dao practice and renew our petition.**
**Twelve Vows are hereby declared.**

**Reigniting the Incense Altar**

The incense officials and messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense—now command that the places where I have previously established the altar and practiced the Dao shall spontaneously generate golden elixir and jade-green herbs, numinous grasses and spirits, as the myriad True Ones gather before this incense altar.

May I now vow that the celestial youths and jade maidens of the Ten Directions attend to the fragrant mists, transmitting my sincere supplications directly to the Supreme True One of the Unfathomable Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Court. **Exit the hall to chant.** **Exit the door.**

*Volume Thirty-Eight of the Grand Compilation of Daoist Rituals and Precepts*
*Compiled by the Three Cavern Scripture and Talisman Disciple Zhong Li*
**Ritual Thirty-Eight: Anning and Exorcism Ceremony – Conducting the Dao at Dawn**

**Conducting the Dao at Dawn**
Perform the ritual rites upon the altar as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.

**Proclaim the Spirit-Guarding Incantations.**
The Azure Yang radiates in void, illuminating the sun’s return to life.
The Spirit Tiger repels malevolence; the flying heavens toll their bells.
The wicked are crushed, the trials extinguished—ten thousand demons bound in form.
The Nine Mysteries circle the Dao; the Eight Powers subdue the essence.
The myriad True Ones register their ranks; the Three Primordials sweep purity.
The Left summons the Central Yellow; the Right wields the Six Ding.
Seven rotations, eight harmonies—revolving through the Celestial Canon.
The Sacred Transformation stands majestic; the Great Dao is set in motion.
Auspicious clouds flow abroad, merging with the Yellow Court—harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.

**Strike the Law-Drum twenty-four times.**

The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin of the Three Breaths—
The Supreme Dao Lord,
The Supreme Laozi—
summon forth from within my body the Three Five Functionaries, the Left and Right Official Messengers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Relay Dragon Cavalry, the Attendant Golden Boys, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols, the Direct-Day Incense Officials—each thirty-six in number—**to emerge.**

Those who emerge must don their formal robes and adornments, their headbands and trailing ribbons, opening the gates to the Mystic Altar’s land and territorial spirits, the domain’s numinous worthies.

Today, at dawn, I conduct the Dao with utmost sincerity, my earnest intentions already recorded and presented. May the Supreme Dao’s numinous breath of the Ten Directions descend in its radiant treasure-light, flowing into my body, so that my supplications may swiftly reach the Supreme Unfathomable Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Court.

**Declare the Legal Title.**
With the assembled officials of the altar, I, [Name], humbly unite in sincerity to present our petition to:
The Supreme Unfathomable Dao,
The Primordial Heavenly Venerable,
The Supreme Dao Lord,
The Supreme Laozi,
The Celestial Sovereign, the Jade Emperor of the Highest,
The Gouchen Star Constellation’s Heavenly Emperor,
The Purple Forbidden’s Celestial Star Master,
The Earthly Sovereign who follows Heaven’s law,
The Ten-Directional Supreme Dao,
The Heavenly Venerables of Dao and Virtue,
The Supreme True Emperor,
The Heavenly Emperor,
The Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mystic Middle Law,
The Five Emperors of the Soil Palace—Great Sovereign, Great Origin,
The Central Yellow’s Steward of the Five-and-Six Responsive Spirits.

I have heard that the Heavenly Venerable’s transformation gives birth, the Great Dao bestows its work—
the Two Breaths shape form, all spirits derive their beginning.
The Round and Pure above bind, suspending sun and moon, arraying stars;
The Square and Impure below congeal, spreading mountains and rivers, blending seas and peaks.
Thus, the hundred spirits take their posts to stabilize the cardinal quarters;
The Five Emperors govern their divisions, each securing their place.
Even the Celestial Metropolis of Pure Clarity, its hundred-tiered nine-enclosed halls,
the counties, cities, human dwellings—
all bear their lawful symbols, corresponding to Heaven and Earth,
relying on the function of tranquil settlement to fulfill the blessings of universal peace.

My duty lies in teaching and assisting the state in its achievements. Whatever I petition must logically be presented. How much more so when commanded by decree—how dare I not report it?

**Proclaim the Petition.**
As the words state, the sincerity is urgent and profound—
through the power of spiritual resonance, it ascends to the True Spirits.

We, the disciples, follow the Dao’s flow, adhere to the ritual forms, arrange the altar in its proper pattern—
the ritual ground mirrors Heaven, the dragon’s brilliance spreads to the Ten Directions,
our sincere words ascend to the Three Realms.

At this dawn, conducting the Dao, I request that the assembled ritualists light the first incense strand.
May this incense cloud ascend to the Supreme Dao-Treasure Heavenly Venerable of the Ten Directions.

We, with body, spirit, and fate, prostrate ourselves in homage,
offering this incense’s merit to bless the current Emperor.

May I humbly pray that the Five Mountains stabilize the land, forever aligning with grand designs;
that the Eight Seas float beneath Heaven, eternally harmonizing with auspicious ages.

「Thus, the blessings surpass those of the Zhou and Han dynasties, while the sage’s virtue excels that of Xīn and Nóng.

The consorts and heirs of the royal line are filled with the radiant virtue of the Sage Emperor.
The princes and princesses are granted harmonious auspicious signs.

The wheels of the chariot blend with the Nine Enclosures,
the ladders and stakes gather in the Ten Thousand Abodes.

Now, in this solemn burning of incense,
I humbly return to rely on the Dao-Way’s Venerable Great Sage, the Most True and Universal Virtue.

After attaining the Dao, I preserve Heaven’s enduring existence,
harmonizing with the True and Perfect Way.

At this dawn, conducting the Dao,
I request the assembled ritualists to light the second incense strand.
May this incense smoke ascend to the Supreme Dao-Treasure Heavenly Venerable of the Ten Directions.

We, with body, spirit, and fate,
prostrate ourselves in homage,
offering this incense’s merit to bless the household of the Ritual Official [name],
for nine generations and seven rebirths,
that they may transcend the Night Realm;
and for the six kinsfolk and five clans,
that they may all attain the Immortal Stage.

May their dwellings remain serene and peaceful,
with dragon spirits guarding them,
evil calamities extinguished,
and malevolent forces not arising.

Now, in this solemn burning of incense,
I humbly return to rely on the Scripture-Way’s Venerable Great Sage, the Most True and Universal Virtue.

After attaining the Dao, I ascend to the Formless,
harmonizing with the True and Perfect Way.

At this dawn, conducting the Dao,
I request the assembled ritualists to light the third incense strand.
May this incense smoke ascend to the Supreme Teacher-Way Heavenly Venerable of the Ten Directions.

We, with body, spirit, and fate,
prostrate ourselves in homage,
offering this incense’s merit to flow throughout Heaven and Earth,
benefiting all sentient beings,
that they may universally partake in the Dao’s blessings,
and all attain the True Fruit.

The Ritual Official’s [name] misfortunes are dispelled before they manifest,
and boundless blessings descend.
All ride upon the wondrous Dao’s merit,
and eternally verify the essence of longevity.

Now, in this solemn burning of incense,
I humbly return to rely on the Teacher-Way’s Venerable Great Sage, the Most True and Universal Virtue.

After attaining the Dao, I preserve Heaven’s enduring existence,
harmonizing with the True and Perfect Way.

Repentance is offered three times, three bows are made.
The sacred titles are reverently invoked once more.

The Ritual Official [name] and all present,
with sincere hearts, humbly petition:
The Heavenly Venerable of the Formless and Most True Three Realms,
the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao,
the Heavenly Venerable of the Universal Virtue of the Thirty-Six Divisions of Sacred Scriptures,
the Soil Realm’s Five Sovereigns of the Supreme Yellow Emperor and the Stewarding Five,
and the Responsive True Spirits of the Central Yellow Emperor and the Stewarding Five.

We hear that before the Dao’s transformation,
the primordial chaos was the origin of all.
The Formless Virtue was not yet carved,
and the True One was in perfect unity with Non-being.
When the Two Symbols divided and spirits emerged,
the Three Talents established their positions,
clearing and turbid harmonized with the essence of Heaven and Earth,
darkness and brightness distinguished the day and night.

The myriad spirits of yin and yang
each govern their respective duties.

Thus, we construct these dwellings,
replacing the layered nests of old.
Taking the Dao from the Celestial Pass,
we proclaim it through the Yin Veil.

Therefore, the Heavenly Stem’s (乾) beneficence and the Earthly Branch’s (兌) abundance
each have their sovereigns to oversee,
and the Fire of Separation (離) and the Wind of Gathering (巽)
alternate in their waxing and waning.

To follow them brings certainty of fidelity and good fortune,
to defy them invites retribution and blame.

From ancient times to the present,
all have adhered to this Dao-Way.

The Ritual Official [name], having divined and built,
fears transgressions may have occurred,
making the divine path unclear,
and human understanding obscure.

Having completed the work of earth and wood,
we now present the rites of incense and lamp,
offer repentance for sins and pray for mercy,
dispel calamities and atone for offenses,
greatly expand the Ritual Offerings,
and ascend to the Most True.

Thus, we arrange and establish the ritual platform,
following the prescribed forms and rituals.

The orchid lamps scatter their brilliance,
illuminating the Nine Abysses below;
the incense strands condense their smoke,
ascending to the Three Realms above.

As we chant the scriptures and conduct the Dao,
we universally repent and pray.

For offenses against the divine spirits,
or for harming the souls of the Underworld;
for slaughtering living beings or defiling sacred traces,
or for provoking the dragon deities and violating prohibitions—
whether through labor or disputes,
or by relocating without proper timing and direction,
accumulating grievances and entanglements,
or dwelling within the Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams,
or within the Twelve Earthly Branches,
or offending the seventy-two gods of yin and yang,
binding them to the earthly officials—

We now petition the Celestial Realm,
through today’s repentance and atonement,
to also beg for their sweeping removal,
that the Ritual Official’s blessings may universally extend,
and their virtuous merits reach far and wide.

Descending the Nine Dragon Talismans,
we proclaim to all the heavens;
invoking the Three Treasures’威神,
we command the Three Realms.

This reaches the Night Realm,
opening all luminous paths,
securing the Emperor’s celestial domain in the Nine Heavens,
and spreading the mysterious peace throughout the Ten Thousand Lands.
The Five Armies rest in order,
and the hundred grains flourish in abundance.

In the Ritual Official’s household,
both the living and the dead are at peace,
the clans prosper in auspicious harmony,
the children and grandchildren are loyal and filial,
their descendants flourish in glory,
their faults are pardoned in the Underworld,
and their names are inscribed in the True Realm.
The duties of yin and yang,
both inner and outer deities,
protect the Dao and bring peace to all,
benefit the times and aid living beings,
together extolling the Dao’s transformation,
assisting the righteous and repelling the evil,
reaching even to the distant and obscure,
all attaining the wondrous Dao-Way.
Above, we honor the Heavenly Venerable’s vast salvation,
and below, we fulfill our sincere devotion to fate.
Humbly, we petition and submit.

**Twelve Vows.**

**Reignite the Incense.**

The incense officials and messengers,
the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals,
and the attendant spirits of incense,
should now command the Ritual Official’s previous place of ritual,
where naturally arise the golden elixir and emerald-green essence,
mushrooms and herbs of myriad blessings,
and the gathering of all the True Ones,
right here before this incense burner.

May it be so that the Ten Directions’ Immortal youths and maidens
attend to the orchid incense,
and swiftly convey the Ritual Official’s previous petitions
to the Supreme Court of the Formless, Most True, and Boundless Great Dao,
and before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign.

**Exit the Hall and Chant.**

The ritual platform is ascended as prescribed.
Each pays respect to the Master in accordance with the law.
The **Wei Ling** incantation is proclaimed.

The **Dan Ling** and **Zhu Fire** blaze,
flaming clouds and gusting winds surge.
The **Red Wheel** rolls with vigor,

**Twenty-four strikes of the sacred drum.**

The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Beginning Three Qi**,
the **Supreme Dao Lord**,
the **Supreme Venerable Lord**,
summon forth from within my body:
the **Three Five Officials of Merit**,
the Left and Right Official Messengers,
the Left and Right Incense-Bearers,
the **Postal Dragon Cavalry Clerks**,
the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**,
the **Speaking and Flower-Scattering Celestial Maidens**,
the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,
the **Direct Sun Incense Officials**—
each, thirty-six in number, now emerge.

The departed don **solemn ritual attire and vows**,
adorned with caps and trailing ribbons,
opening the **Mysterious Platform’s Land and Domain Spirits**,
the **Regional Deities and True Ones**.

Now, as I perform the midday ritual,
I humbly present my sincerest petition.
My deepest aspirations are recorded and conveyed.
May the **Supreme Dao’s Ten Directions’ Most True Qi**,
the **Numinous Treasure Radiance**, descend and flow into my body,
so that my petitions swiftly reach the **Supreme Boundless Dao**,
before the **Celestial Sovereign Jade Emperor**.

**Proclaim the Legal Title.**

I, **Position-Holder [Name]**, along with all platform officials,
sincerely present our petition to:
the **Supreme Boundless Dao**,
the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable**,
the **Supreme Dao Lord**,
the **Supreme Venerable Lord**,
the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Boundless Dao**,
the **Moral and Virtue Holy Saints of Heaven**,
the **Most True Great Emperor**,
the **Heavenly Emperor**,
the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mysterious Middle**,
the **Earthly Bureau’s Grand Imperial Five Emperors of Origin**,
the **Central Yellow Steward of the Wu-Ji Responsive True Spirit**.

We have long been favored by the Mysterious Grace,
encountering the Dao’s transformation.
The Five Scripts illuminate the landscape,
the Three Caverns radiate light—
drawing profound principles from the Heavy Mysterious,
unfolding divine power in wondrous application.
Having attained the secrets of the arcane,
we now present our vows and deeds.
From the outset of our pledge,
we established merit as our foundation.
All who turn toward the Dao—
how could we fail to report upward?
Our sincerest aspirations are now proclaimed.

**Proclaim the Words.**

As the words declare, our devotion is sincere and exalted.
We, who bear the Mysterious Sciences,
ought to open the path to enlightenment.
The **Ritual Official [Name]**, having recently undertaken repairs,
with earthworks and construction underway,
fears offending the True Spirits.
Thus, we humbly petition for expiation.

We dare to follow the **Three Pure Ones’ ordinances**,
unveil the **Nine Petitions’ rites**,
present our faith-filled words,
and request the **Fast’s Direct Petition**,
hoping to rely on the **Gate’s Petition**,
to reach the Most True above.

Now, as we perform the midday ritual,
we request the assembled ritualists to light the **first incense strand**,
wishing this incense cloud to ascend and supply the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Dao-Treasure Heavenly Venerable**.

We, having **surrendered body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrate our heads to the ground,
offering this incense-strand’s merit
to nourish the ancestral temples’ numinous spirits,
the ordered ranks of saints,
ascending to the sacred grades above,
bestowing blessings upon the imperial lineage below.

The Emperor’s virtue follows **Xīn and Nóng**,
illuminating like the sun and moon,
holding the **Golden Mirror** over the Four Seas,
adjusting the **Jade Candle** to nurture all under heaven.
Loyal ministers serve in court,
no talent is left untapped in the wilds.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return to rely on the Dao-Venerable Great Saints’ Most True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
we preserve the Heavenly Eternal—
harmony with the Dao, unity with the True.

Now, as we perform the midday ritual,
we request the assembled ritualists to light the **second incense strand**,
wishing this incense smoke to ascend and supply the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Scripture-Treasure Heavenly Venerable**.

We, having **surrendered body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrate our heads to the ground,
offering this incense-strand’s merit
to flow back to the **Ritual Official [Name]’s ancestral nine generations’ solemn rites**—
ascending to heaven, awakening to the Dao;
the **Seven Mysteries’ swift ascent**, attaining the True grades.

Even the **Residence Dragons and Spirits**,
the **Yin-Yang Officers and Clerks**,
each return to their appointed domains,
harmonizing with the **Non-Action**,
ascending in rank upon the numinous stages,
achieving singular merit in the Dao’s fruits.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return to rely on the Scripture-Venerable Great Saints’ Most True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
we ascend to the **Formless**—
harmony with the Dao, unity with the True.

Now, as we perform the midday ritual,
we request the assembled ritualists to light the **third incense strand**,
wishing this incense cloud to ascend and supply the **Ten Directions’ Supreme Teacher-Treasure Heavenly Venerable**.

We, having **surrendered body, spirit, and fate**,
prostrate our heads to the ground,
offering this incense-strand’s merit
to flow to the **Ritual Official [Name]’s blessings**—
the **Dao-Wind’s far-reaching influence**,
longevity extending to eternal fortune,
guilt erased, calamities extinguished.
Then, in the **Nightly Bureau’s Cold Courts**,
through the **Three Realms and Six Paths**,
all are liberated from stagnation,
united in contracting with the Most True.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return to rely on the Teacher-Venerable Great Saints’ Most True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
we endure the **Heavenly Eternal**—
harmony with the Dao, completeness with the True.

**Chant the Square, Repent the Square, Command the Demons—**
three petitions, three rites.

**Re-proclaim the Legal Title.**

I, **Position-Holder [Name]**, along with all platform officials,
sincerely present our petition to:
the **Golden Gate’s Void-Nothing Nine Pure Celestial Sovereign**,
the **Earthly Bureau’s Grand Imperial Five Emperors of Origin**,
the **Central Yellow Steward of the Wu-Ji Responsive True Spirit**.

We have heard:
When the Great Dao was divided,
the Sage established teachings,
drawing from the **Easy Symbols**,
modeling the **Upper Mysterious**.

He framed the **rules for dwellings**,
replaced the **animal nests’ customs**,
for the benefit of all under heaven,
to shelter all living beings.
Thus, he commanded the **Heavenly Earthly Deities and Spirits**,
the **Yin-Yang Officers and Clerks**,
to rank in stages, each with their appointed roles.
Ancient and modern alike adhere—
no discrepancy in auspicious or inauspicious matters.

The **Ritual Official [Name]**, having recently undertaken repairs,
with earthworks and construction underway,
fears piercing the **Spirits’ sacred traces**,
intruding upon the **Deities’ positions**,
offending the **auspicious Kingly Qi**,
violating the **forbidden prohibitions**.

---

**Translation:**

Thus, we open the ritual hall,
to extend our sincere repentance and gratitude.

We, the officials, follow the **rankings of the River Chart**,
unfold the **rites of the Three Caverns**,
strive to emulate the **Dao’s flowing law**,
and diligently refine our **fasting and rectitude**.
We bow our heads beneath the **Three Primordials**,
and bare our hearts before the **Ten Thousand Saints**,
to repent our sins and blemishes,
and pray for mercy and pardon,
hoping through our devout sincerity
to move the **True Spirits** to descend in favor.

We humbly petition on behalf of disciple **[Name]**:
to the **Lord of the Granary** who rescues the defeated,
the **Lord of the Golden Gate** who secures the celestial realm,

the **Lord of the Divine Clerks** who calculates peace,
the **Lord of the Beginning** who oversees construction,

to remove disasters and repel malevolent spirits,
to exterminate and annihilate the **malignant Qi**,
to subdue and tame the **evil essences**,
to crush the **poisonous influences** and repel the **hostile forces**,
to eliminate the **malevolent and demonic** and extinguish their breath.

We further petition the **Lord of the Han Dynasty’s Brightness**,
the **Lord of the Supreme Supervising Qi**,
the **Jade Maiden of the Furnace Flame**,
to lead the **Vanguard of the Great Army**,
and to collect the spirits dwelling within the residence,
as well as those of the **well and hearth**.

We also petition the **Lord Yang Fangping of the Stone**,
to collect the **earthly Qi** and the **harmful earthly spirits**.

We further petition the **Lord Gao of the Celestial Artisan**,
to collect the **Qi of the mounds and tombs beneath the earth**,
and the **forbidden and taboo spirits**,
so that the **right qi** may circulate freely,
and the **malevolent and evil** be crushed and subdued,
allowing us to dwell in **purity and celestial peace**,
to always enjoy **health and harmony**,
to have **auspicious omens** in our homes,
to be free from **untimely calamities**,
to let the **six kinsmen** share in blessings,
and to grant the **nine ancestors** ascension to **Heaven**,
to extend our **longevity and fortune**,
to dissolve our **guilt and blame**,
to reconcile our **grievances and feuds**,
to silence our **litigations and disputes**,
to ensure **inner and outer tranquility**,
and to make our **actions and stillness** clear and unobstructed.

May we pray that the **Sages’ designs** endure eternally,
and that our **lineage’s blessings** extend far and wide,
so that the **ten thousand nations** may dwell in harmony,
and the **eight trigrams** align with **nature’s transformations**,
that the **heavens be clear and the earth bright**,
that the **land be rich and its people joyful**,
that **auspicious omens** and **harmonious signs** appear,
that **propitious days** be recorded in the calendar,
that the **winds and clouds** display their **bountiful blessings**,
and that the **seas and mountains** rest in **serenity**.

May all beings in the **Six Realms** and **Nine Depths**,
those with life and sentience,
share in this **great benevolence**,
and each attain **freedom and ease**.

The **Dragon Gods of the Residence**,
the **proper officers of Yin-Yang**,
the **meritorious deeds of the Daoists**,
and the **peaceful settlement of the four directions**,
from the **dark to the bright**,
let all ascend to **celestial harmony**.

We, your disciples, seek to repay the **Lord’s boundless grace**,
and to fulfill our **sincere vows of submission**,
thus humbly present this petition.

**Twelve Vows.**

We renew the **furnace**.

The **Incense Officials and Divine Messengers**,
the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
and the **Attendant Spirits of the Incense**,
should now command us to visit the **midday ritual site**,
where **golden nectar and emerald elixir**,
**mushrooms, herbs, and myriad sacred essences**,
and the **gathered True Ones**,
will naturally arise at this **incense burner**.

May we vow that the **Ten Thousand Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**,
attending the **fragrant incense vapors**,
will swiftly transmit our **earlier petitioned sincerity**
directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Primordial**,
before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor**’s **Celestial Court**.

**We exit the hall and chant.**
**We exit the door.**

For any petition or plea,

We, the fasting officials, according to this sincere petition,

Wandering joyfully in the Azure Palaces;

**Chant the Square, Confess the Square, Three Invocations, Three Homages.**
**Law Position is invoked again.**
I, **Subject of Rank [X]**, with all platform officials,
Solemnly together present with sincerity:
To the **Three Realms’ Void Sovereigns of the Six Palaces**,
**Ten Thousand Directions’ Attained Dao Heavenly Saints**,
**Five Emperors of the Soil Bureau’s Grand Primordial Sovereign**,
**Central Yellow Steward of the Wu-Ji Responsive True Spirit**.

We have received the Most True teachings,
Studied the profound mysteries,
Yet our merit has not extended to plants and creatures,
Our transformations not perfected for all living beings.
Ever mindful of assisting the realm and guiding people,
Promoting the Dao and upholding the Law,
Proclaiming the Mysterious and Profound,
Broadly benefiting humans and heavens.

**Fasting Official [X]**, in constructing his dwelling,
Moved earth and stone—
Perhaps disturbing Dragon spirits;
Or raised low and lowered high—
Perhaps violating prohibitions;

「。
　　Yet further, we humbly beseech:
　　Perhaps the site of his dwelling harbors ancient **sacred sites** and **spirits’ abodes**;
　　Or the direction of excavation contains **ruined shrines** and **collapsed ramparts**;
　　Perhaps it defiles **immortal realms**;
　　Or intrudes upon **renowned traces**;
　　Perhaps it disregards the **Five Soil Classifications’** auspiciousness;
　　Or it contravenes the **Two Residences’** advantages.

　　Through his repairs and embellishments,
　　Misfortune and calamity ensue—
　　We devoutly establish **altars and ritual grounds**,
　　And broadly petition for **atonement and expiation**.

　　In accordance with the **Celestial Master’s** rank and dignity,
　　And following the **Orthodox Unity** scriptural tradition,
　　We respectfully request the **Twelve Departments of Salvation**—
　　The **Celestial Officials**, **Generals**, **Soldiers**, and **Ministers**—
　　To expel the **residual *qi***,
　　To purify and disperse **demonic malevolence**,
　　To repel the **earthly spirits of soil and wood**,
　　And the **wandering corpses and dependent ghosts**,
　　To alleviate the **Earthly Deities’** predatory harm,
　　To dissolve the **Five Directions’** forbidden calamities,
　　So that all **disastrous demons** are utterly banished—
　　Thus auspicious omens gather, and misfortunes vanish.

　　We humbly pray that the **Supreme Celestials**,
　　May extend their **merciful gaze**,
　　Descend **flowing *Dao-qi***,
　　And cover with their **auspicious protection** that place.

　　By imperial decree, let **orthodox spirits** be settled,
　　And let their **positions be secured**,
　　Ever in harmony with **purity and good fortune**,
　　Forever preserving **tranquility and prosperity**.

　　May the **Imperial Dao** flourish and the **Celestial Mandate** extend far—
　　The **three borders** be at peace,
　　The **eight seas** without turmoil,
　　Plagues and poisons not intrude,
　　And the **stars and constellations** align benignly.

　　Thus, within the **nightly domains of the underworld**,
　　He may long behold **radiant light**;
　　And all **sentient beings**,
　　Shall not lose their **rightful abode**.

　　For the **Fasting Official’s** household,
　　May **high purity** be attained,
　　And **spiritual rank** be confirmed in **Heavenly Birth**,
　　So that descendants perpetuate **loyalty and filial piety**,
　　And both near and far enjoy **eternal peace and blessings**—
　　With **Dragon spirits** in secret guardianship,
　　And **tranquility** in all **movements and stillness**,
　　Universal immersion in **mysterious efficacy**,
　　And joint ascent to the **true realm**.

　　Above, we honor the **Heavenly Celestials’** great **merciful grace**,
　　Below, we fulfill the **devout sincerity** of the petitioner—
　　Thus, we humbly submit and report.

　　**Twelve Petitions** completed.
　　Return to the **incense altar**.

　　**Incense Officials** and **Envoys**,
　　The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Celestial Generals**,
　　And the **attending spirits** of the **Incense Altar**,
　　Shall command the **Fasting Official** to return to his **serene nightly Dao-practice**,
　　Where **golden elixir** and **emerald jade** naturally arise,
　　And **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad sacred essences** flourish—
　　Thus all **true spirits** gather here,
　　At this **incense and fire altar**.

　　May the **Ten Thousand Directions’** **celestial children** and **jade maidens**,
　　Attend to the **fragrant vapors**,
　　And swiftly convey the **Fasting Official’s** sincerely submitted petitions
　　Directly to the **Great Dao of the Boundless Supreme**,
　　Before the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heaven**.

　　**Exit the Hall** in praise.
　　**Exit the Door**.」

**The Complete Daoist Rituals and Precepts, Volume Forty-First, Compiled by the Disciple Zhongli of the Three Caverns Canon**

**Ritual for Pacifying the Home and Resolving Crimes**

At the appointed hour, the **Way** is practiced, and the ritual is performed according to the prescribed manner. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.

The **Sacred Guardians’ Incantations** are proclaimed,
As the **Five Stars** align in radiance, illuminating the **Five Directions**.
The **Water Star** repels calamities, the **Wood Virtue** brings prosperity.
The **Uranus Star (Yinghuo)** dissipates misfortune, the **Mars Star (Tai Bai)** wards off soldiers.
The **Jupiter Star (Zhen Xing)** holds firm its fourfold dominion, benefiting the **home and state**.
Their names are inscribed on **jade tablets**, their words recorded in the **Imperial Registry**.

Riding the **tempestuous winds**, they scatter their **auspicious light**,
Soaring through the **vast expanse**, entering and exiting the **mysterious void**.
They roam and feast across the **Ten Thousand Directions**,
With **five clouds** floating as their canopy, summoning **spirits** and restraining **winds**.
They command the **Ten Thousand Spirits**, ascending to guard the **Dao** in harmony,
And align with the **true essence of the Way**.

Twenty-four **supreme incantations** are struck upon the **law-drum**.

The **Supreme Three Heavens**—**Primordial Beginning (Xuanyuan Shi)** of the **Three Essences (San Hun)**, the **Supreme Dao Lord (Taishang Daojun)**, and the **Supreme Old Lord (Taishang Laojun)**—
Call forth from my body the **Thirty-Six Officials of the Five Agents (San Wu)**, the **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Incense Bearers**, the **Dragon Couriers and Mounted Attendants**, the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**, the **Jade Maidens Conveying Petitions and Scattering Flowers**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Direct Day Incense Officials**—each **Thirty-Six in number**—to emerge.

With **headdresses and sashes** trailing their **pendant ribbons**.
The **land and domain spirits** of the **mysterious hall** are invoked,
And the **divine beings** of the **Four Quarters** are summoned.

Now that I ascend the **altar** to practice the **Way**,
I humbly present this **prayer** to express my **true intent**.
My **sincere petitions** have already been recorded and heard—
I pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Essence of the Ten Thousand Directions**,
The **precious blessings** of its **radiant light**,
May descend and flow into my body,
So that my **petitions** reach the **Supreme Boundless Dao**,
Before the **Heavenly Sovereign, Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heaven**.

I request the **invocation of the Law’s station**.

**Heavenly Emperor**,
**Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures, Supreme Law Master of the Mysterious Middle**,
**Earthly Officials, True Sovereign Emperors of the Five Agents**,
**Central Yellow, the Fifth and Sixth Agents, and the Responsive True Spirits**.

I have heard that the **Great Dao harmonizes the True Essence**,
The **Primordial Sovereign rules the celestial operations**,
The **Five Talismans** open their **teachings**,
And the **Three Caverns** proclaim their **rituals**.

The **Heavenly Sovereign** bestows the **Great Compassion’s Precepts**,
The **Supreme Lord** spreads the **Boundless Blessings**,
Molding all beings and rescuing all life.
I, with **countless eons of good karma**,
Have been blessed by the **mysterious transformations**,
And through the **Dragon Scriptures** and **Phoenix Records**,
The **jade decrees** and **precious texts**,
I have been able to **cultivate and refine**,
And thus **ascend and attain**—
While at the **beginning of my oath**, I have taken **rescue as my priority**.

Whatever I may **present in supplication**,
Shall not be **left unanswered**,
And since I **offer these words in accordance with the Dao’s will**,
How dare I **fail to submit them**?
With **sincere fasting intentions**,
I shall **proclaim them faithfully**.

**Proclamation of the Petition**.

As the **words are spoken**, my **sincerity is profound and my devotion fervent**.
The **situation calls for** the **Dao’s compassionate intervention**.
I humbly consider that before the **Five Supreme Lords**,
The **Three Spirits** differentiated from the **Primordial Essence**,
Since the **Great Antiquity**,
They have not mingled with the **profane and impure**.
In **winter’s hollows** and **summer’s nests**,
They **embrace the Dao** and **hold virtue**,
Each finding their **proper place** in **mysterious unity**.

From the **countless myriads of yin and yang**,
The **celestial symbols** descend upon the **foundations of the world**.
**Good and bad fortune**, **virtue and vice**,
Depend upon **alignment or defiance**.
To **follow them** brings **auspicious blessings**,
To **violate them** invites **calamity and misfortune**.
The **Saints and True Ones** guide with their **teachings**,
Their **compassion** is boundless—
**Confessing sins** and **praying for mercy**,
So that **sacred fasting** may be **properly honored**.

I and my **compatriots**, holding hands in **unity**,
Follow the **rituals and precepts**,
Establish the **altar** in its **proper form**,
To **divide and bestow blessings**.

Now, as I **ascend the altar** to practice the **Way**,
I request the **Law Master and assembly** to perform this **first incense offering**.
May this **fragrant incense** ascend to the **Supreme Dao’s Precious Heavenly Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Directions**.

I and my **compatriots**,
**Repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**,
Bow our **heads to the earth**,
And dedicate the **merits of this incense offering** to:
The **spirits of the ancestral halls and state**,
The **ancestors and venerable saints**,
The **Pure Celestial Court** and **Luminous Essence**,
The **Violet Extremity (Zixi)** and its **auspicious blessings**,
The **blessings descending upon the Imperial Residence**,
And the **joy spreading to the Heavenly Descendants**.
May we **compare with Mount Song and Mount Heng** in **virtue**,
And **align with the sun and moon** in **clarity**.

The **Prince and all the Kings**,
Shall **support and uphold the sacred work**.
The **virtuous ministers and loyal advisors**,
Shall **commend and assist in the planning**.
All **states shall ascend in order**,
And all **beings shall prosper in clarity**.

Now, through this **incense offering**,
I **take refuge in the Dao’s Supreme Sovereign and the True Essence of the Saints**.
After **attaining the Dao**,
I shall **preserve the Heaven’s longevity**,
And **harmonize with the True Essence of the Way**.

Now, as I **ascend the altar** to practice the **Way**,
I request the **Law Master and assembly** to perform this **second incense offering**.
May this **fragrant incense** ascend to the **Supreme Scripture’s Precious Heavenly Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Directions**.

I and my **compatriots**,
**Repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**,
Bow our **heads to the earth**,
And dedicate the **merits of this incense offering** to:
The **Nine Ancestors and Seven Mysterious Ones** of my **fasting official’s family**,
The **spirits of my ancestors** and **subtle essences**,
The **Divine Abode of the Vermilion Gardens**,
The **Refining Platform of the Cinnabar Field**,
The **inheritance of my mother’s essence** to **ascend the True**,
The **riding of the celestial clouds** to **embody transformation**,
The **blessings bestowed upon my descendants**,
The **mercy extending to the living and the dead**,
The **bearing of the Dao’s rest**,
And the **constant reception of Primordial Auspiciousness**.

Now, through this **incense offering**,
I **take refuge in the Scripture’s Supreme Sovereign and the True Essence of the Saints**.
After **attaining the Dao**,
I shall **ascend to the Formless**,
And **harmonize with the True Essence of the Way**.

Now, as I **ascend the altar** to practice the **Way**,
I request the **Law Master and assembly** to perform this **third incense offering**.
May this **fragrant incense** ascend to the **Supreme Teacher’s Precious Heavenly Sovereign of the Ten Thousand Directions**.

I and my **compatriots**,
**Repent our bodies, repent our spirits, repent our fates**,
Bow our **heads to the earth**,
And dedicate the **merits of this incense offering** to:
The **relatives and kin** of my **fasting official’s family**,
So that **auspicious blessings** may **prolong their lives**,
And **calamities and misfortunes** be **dissipated**.

To the **Dragons and Spirits of the Home**,
The **Yin and Yang Officers and Messengers**,
I **transfer the merits** of **abundant rewards**,
And **bestow ranks and honors**.
May **auspicious fortune** be **received in the Central Palace**,
And **disasters and malevolence** be **cleansed from the Four Quarters**.

Now, through this **incense offering**,
I **take refuge in the Teacher’s Supreme Sovereign and the True Essence of the Saints**.
After **attaining the Dao**,
I shall **permanently preserve the Heaven’s longevity**,
And **harmonize with the True Essence of the Way**.

**Chant the Directions**, **confess the Directions**, three **invocations**, three **homages**.
**Reaffirm the Law’s station**.

I, the **disciple of such-and-such rank**, along with all the **officers of the altar**,
Humbly present this **sincere petition** to the:
**Golden Gate of the Void, Nine Pure Heavenly Sovereigns**,
**Jade Platform and Precious Gate, Marvelous and Existent High True Ones**,
**Earthly Officials, True Sovereign Great Emperors**,
And **all responsive true spirits**.

「The disciple hears that the **Dao’s transformations** have been manifest,
And the **mysterious winds** spread far and wide,
Giving rise to **spirits of life** and their **variations**,
To fully display the **virtue/power** of the **spirits**.

From this, **feathered halls and misty chambers** emerge,
Where **clouds condense** and **qi coalesces**,
Floating clouds symbolize **forms**,
Responding to things and manifesting **spiritual efficacy**.

In the **Upper Antiquity**, the **saints** followed Heaven and embodied the Dao,
Establishing **palaces** to replace **cavernous nests**,
Taking the **principles of the Two Poles** (yin-yang) as their model,
And dividing the **five types of qi** (wuxing),
Thus setting the **positions of yin and yang**,
And clarifying the **distinctions between calamity and auspiciousness**.

The **Heavenly and Earthly officials** govern their duties accordingly.
When **virtue** prevails, it **prolongs blessings** and **brings good fortune**,
Ensuring **safety and tranquility**;
When **evil** prevails, it **invokes misfortune** and **brings disaster**,
Leading to **calamitous retribution**.

Thus, the **rites for rectifying and averting** were established,
To solemnly **express prayers of thanks and repentance**.

Moreover, our **intentions lie in achieving merit**,
And **solely in benefiting others**.
All who **petition and appeal**,
How could we **dare not present** their cases?

The **disciple of such-and-such rank**, through the **construction of this dwelling**,
Not knowing the **prohibitions and taboos**,
Fears that due to **repairs and renovations**,
We may **offend the spirits** and **transgress the Dao**.

We dread **offending the Heavenly Sovereign**,
The **four seasons and six qi** (six climates),
**Defying the True Dao** and **inviting calamity and decline**.

We also fear **offending the Celestial Officials**—
The **Grand Duke of the Year** (太岁), **Grand Duke of the Moon** (太阴), **Flying Yen** (飞廉), **Tiger’s Tail** (豹尾),
The **officers of yin and yang**, the **gods of punishment and slaughter** (刑杀), and the **Ten Celestial Stems and Twelve Earthly Branches deities** (支干众神).

We further fear **offending the Earthly Officials**—
The **Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams** (九宫八卦),
The **Earthly Palaces and Soil Sovereigns** (地宫土府),
The **spirits of the yin realm** (阴境灵祇),
And through **construction and labor**,
**Disturbing the Dao’s harmony**.

We also fear that the **land where we reside**,
May be **deeply marked by time and fate**—
Perhaps it was once an **ancestral homestead or field**,
A **ruined palace or imperial site**;
Or a **sacred mountain or spirit’s trace** (灵迹),
A **blessed land of eminent residence** (福地胜居);
Or the **mounds and tombs of ancient sages and virtuous ones** (先哲古贤);
Or the **city gods’ shrines and ancestral altars** (城隍社庙, 郊祀坛场);
Or a **collapsed fortress or abandoned camp**,
A **battlefield**;
Or a **site of oaths and alliances** (盟坛誓处);
Or a **ruined marketplace**;
Or a place where **corpse-ghosts** (腐骨穷魂) linger as **support**,
Or where **wandering spirits** (游神之鬼) still **rely upon**—
When **malevolent apparitions** appear and **disasters arise**,
Human emotions cannot **fathom them**,
And **rites of rectification and repentance** are **without method**.

Now, according to the **Scripture of the Numinous Treasure** (灵宝真经)
And the **Orthodox One’s Grades** (正一科品),
We **carry the Dao’s faith** and **revere the sacred space**,
Establishing a **Daoist altar** that **mirrors the Heavenly pattern**,
And **pray for blessings** while **repenting past sins**.

We **follow the established rites** with **devotion**,
And **sincerely prepare** the **incense offering and purification**,
To **report to the Supreme True Ones**,
**Dissolving disasters and atoning for guilt**,
And **repenting and purifying** the **Ten Directions**.
We **return to the Three Treasures** (三宝) in **humble reliance**.

We **humbly hope** that the **Supreme Saints** will **shine their light**,
And the **High True Ones** will **descend to aid**,
Commanding the **Four Celestial Officials and their attendants** (四司官属),
The **Five Celestial Emperors’ awe-inspiring spirits** (五帝威灵),
To **wash away and dispel** our **transgressions and misfortunes**,
And **bestow Heavenly blessings**,
So that the **Dragon-spirits** may **fulfill their duties**,
And **calmly govern their regions**,
While **noxious qi and malevolent essences** (沴气邪精)
**Retreat into the depths of the Earth**,
And **calamity and disaster** are **extinguished**,
**Impure qi vanishes**,
Our **residence becomes tranquil**,
And our **lives are secure and prosperous**.

The **Five Plagues and Four Toxins** (五瘟四毒) shall **not harm humanity**;
**Floods, fires, knives, and weapons** (水火刀兵) shall **not injure the world**.

The **Seven Mysteries** (七玄) shall **open their degrees**,
And **eternal night** shall **radiate with clarity**,
**Longevity and prosperity** shall **extend far**,
And our **descendants** shall **be loyal and filial**,
With **no untimely deaths within**,
And **auspicious omens** (祯祥) **abounding in the home**.

The **Heavenly Sovereign’s benevolent influence** (帝泽宸波) shall **permanently secure the North Pole**;
The **Five Winds and Ten Rains** shall **all be in harmony with the Central Sky**.

**Hundreds of grains** shall **abundantly flourish**,
And the **Five Types of Armies** (五兵) shall **lay down their weapons**,
While **flying and submerged creatures** (飞沉蠢动) shall **submit to the Dao’s efficacy**,
And the **Nine Nights and Three Paths** (九夜三途) shall **share in the merit of this purification**.

We **solemnly present** this **petition** to the **Heavenly Sovereign**,
And **the Twelve Vows** (十二愿) are **fulfilled**.
The **incense burner** is **replaced**.

The **Incense Officials and Messengers** (香官使者),
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals** (左右龙虎君),
And the **attendant spirits of incense** (侍香诸灵官),
Shall **command** us so that in **all our past Daoist practices**,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** (金液丹碧) shall **naturally emerge**,
Along with **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** (芝英百灵),
And the **multitude of True Ones** shall **gather here** before this **incense burner**.

We **vow** that the **Ten Directions’ immortal children and celestial maidens** (仙童玉女),
Shall **attend and receive** the **fragrant incense**,
And **transmit our petition** directly to the **Supreme True One, the Boundless Dao** (至真无极大道),
Before the **Grand Celestial Jade Emperor, Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Praise upon leaving the hall.**
**Praise upon leaving the door.**

To the **Supreme True Dao/Way of the Boundless** [至真无极大道, *Zhìzhēn wújī Dàodào*],

**Request the invocation of the Daoist ranks** [请称法位, *Qǐng chēng fǎwèi*].

**The Daoist of this rank** [具位臣某, *Jùwèi chén mǒu*] and the **entire assembly of ritual officials** [阖坛官众等, *Hétán guānzhòng děng*],
**Together with utmost sincerity** [谨同诚, *Jǐn tóngchéng*] present our **supplication** [上启, *shàngqǐ*]:

To the **Great Dao/Way of the Boundless** [无极大道, *Wújī Dàodào*],
The **Primordial Origin Celestial Lord** [元始天尊, *Yuánshǐ Tiānzūn*],
The **Great Dao Lord** [太上道君, *Tàishàng Dàojūn*],
The **Venerable Old Lord** [太上老君, *Tàishàng Lǎojūn*],
The **Boundless Dao/Way of the Ten Directions** [十方无极大道, *Shífāng wújī Dàodào*],
The **Celestial Lords of Virtue and Power** [道德众圣天尊, *Dàodé zhòngshèng Tiānzūn*],
The **Great Sovereign of Supreme Truth** [至真大帝, *Zhìzhēn Dàidì*],
The **Heavenly Sovereign** [天帝, *Tiān Dì*],
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scripture, Grand Master of Mysterious Middle Dao** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师, *Sānshíliù bù zūn jīng xuánzhōng Dàfǎshī*],
The **Five Sovereigns of the Earthly Palace** [土府太皇太始五帝, *Tǔfǔ Tàihuáng Tàishǐ Wǔdì*],
And the **Nine Yellows, Five Olds, and Stewardly Spirits of the Eight and Fourteen Residences** [中黄戊己应感真灵, *Zhōnghuáng wùjǐ yìnggǎn zhēnlíng*].

I hear that **all phenomena** [万象, *Wànxiàng*] were **not yet formed** [未形, *wèixíng*],
When the **Primordial One** [一元, *Yīyuán*] **first began** [肇启, *zhàoqǐ*].
The **Dao/Way of the Void** [虚无大道, *Xūwú Dàodào*] is the **root origin of life and transformation** [生化之根元, *shēnghuà zhī gēnyuán*],
The **Pure and Tranquil True Wind** [清净真风, *Qīngjìng zhēnfēng*] is the **source of yin and yang** [阴阳之宗本, *Yīnyáng zhī zōngběn*].

Thus, **first dividing the Two Qi** [先分二气, *Xiān fēn èrqì*],
Then **manifesting the Three Talents** [后显三才, *Hòu xiǎn sāncái*].
The **ranked positions of high and low** [尊卑之位, *Zūn bēi zhī wèi*] were **clearly established** [既彰, *jìzhāng*],
And the **functions of covering and loading** [覆载之功, *Fùzǎi zhī gōng*] were **attained** [攸着, *yōuzhuó*].

The **cycles of winter retreat and summer habitation** [冬穴夏巢之代, *Dōng xué xià cháo zhī dài*] **remained unchanged** [淳朴未移, *Chúnpú wèiyí*],
While the **rituals of upper eaves and lower rooms** [上栋下宇之仪, *Shàng dòng xià yǔ zhī yí*] **were yet to be formed** [易象方作, *Yìxiàng fāngzuò*].

None failed to **measure the form of Heaven and Earth** [裁形天地, *Cái xíng tiāndì*],
And to **take the pattern of the Sky and the Earth** [取法乾坤, *Qǔfǎ qiánkūn*],
**Establishing the rules of square and round** [定方圆之规, *Dìng fāngyuán zhī guī*],
And **listing the numbers of yin and yang** [列阴阳之数, *Liè yīnyáng zhī shù*].

To **follow them** [顺之, *shùnzhī*] is to **naturally receive Heaven’s blessings** [自天垂佑, *zìtiān chuíyòu*],
With **endless fortune** [福被无疆, *Fú bèi wújīang*].
To **violate them** [违之, *wéizhī*] is for **all things to suffer calamities** [万物延灾, *Wànwù yánzāi*],
And for **disasters to arise unmeasured** [祸生不测, *Huò shēng bùcè*].

**Auspicious and inauspicious events** [吉凶斯在, *Jíxiōng sīzài*] thus **lie in wait**,
And **ancient and modern beings** [今古攸遵, *Jīngǔ yōuzūn*] **must adhere** to them.

Moreover, **in this world of manifold paths** [处世多端, *Chǔshì duōduān*],
If **cultivation of the heart** [修心未至, *Xiūxīn wèizhì*] is **not yet complete** [未至, *wèizhì*],
Then **every action brings regret and loss** [动贻悔吝, *Dòng yí huǐlìn*],
And **faults easily accumulate** [易积愆瑕, *Yì jī qiānxiá*].
Without **entrusting oneself to the Supreme True** [非托上真, *Fēi tuō shàngzhēn*],
There is **no means to dispel and atone** [无由解谢, *Wúyóu jiěxiè*].

I have heard that the **Celestial Lord** [天尊, *Tiānzūn*] **established teachings** [设教, *Shèjiào*],
And the **True Scripture** [真文, *Zhēnwén*] **initiated the methods of expiation and suppression** [启禳镇之科, *qǐ rángzhèn zhī kē*].
The **Great Dao/Way** [大道, *Dàodào*] **bestowed its mercy** [垂慈, *chuízī*],
And the **Sacred Treasure** [灵宝, *Língbǎo*] **possesses rituals of repentance and supplication** [有忏祈之典, *yǒu chìqí zhī diǎn*].

Daring to **follow this intent** [敢缘斯旨, *Gǎn yuán sīzhǐ*],
I have **prepared the Daoist fast altar** [辄备醮坛, *Zhé bèi jiàotán*],
And **earnestly petitioned all the Heavens** [沥恳诸天, *Lìkěn zhūtīan*],
**Pledged to the Five Sovereigns** [告盟五帝, *Gàoméng wǔdì*],
Hoping to **receive their discerning blessings** [冀蒙鉴佑, *Jì méng jiànyòu*],
And **condescending descent of their sacred power** [俯降威灵, *Fǔjiàng wēilíng*].

So that the **Heavenly Soil and Earthly Deities** [天地灵司, *Tiāndì língsī*],
And the **yin and yang ministers** [阴阳僚属, *Yīnyáng liáo shǔ*],
**Returning clouds and bending the landscape** [回云迂景, *Huí yún yū jǐng*],
May **descend to observe my petitions** [下察启祈, *Xiàchá qǐqí*],
**Adopt and accept my sincere offerings** [采纳丹诚, *Cǎinà dāncéng*],
And **bestow upon me the mist of boundless fortune** [雾流鸿福, *Wù liú hóngfú*].

I, along with the **fasting officials** [斋官, *Zhāiguān*] and the **assembled ritual officials** [合坛众等, *Hétán zhòng děng*],
With **no limit to our reverent anticipation** [无任瞻望天衢激切钦伫皈向之至, *Wú rèn zhānwàng tiānqú jīqiè qīnzhù guīxiàng zhī zhì*],
**Solemnly bowing and prostrating twice** [诚惶诚恐, *Chénghuáng chéngkǒng*; 稽首再拜, *Qǐshǒu zàibài*],
**Solemnly welcome the Celestial Procession** [奉迎仙驾, *Fèngyíng xiān jià*].

**Descend the True Ones** [降真, *Jiàngzhēn*],
**Offer tea** [上茶, *Shàngchá*],
**First presentation** [初献, *Chūxiàn*],
**Scatter flowers** [散花, *Sǎnhuā*].

I **earnestly present my sincere supplication** [谨重诚上启, *Jǐn zhòngchéng shàngqǐ*] to the **Nine Pure Celestial Saints** [九清上圣, *Jiǔqīng shàngshèng*],
And the **Three Realms’ Sacred Spirits** [三界威灵, *Sānjiè wēilíng*].

I **hear that supreme sincerity** [至诚, *Zhìchéng*] can **move the spirits** [感神, *gǎnshén*],
And that **creating virtue** [作德, *zuòdé*] can **dissipate transformations** [销变, *xiāobiàn*].
**King Jing of Qi** [景公, *Jǐ

If one has offended the **Ten Heavenly Stems’ Great Deities** [甲、乙、丙、丁、戊、己、庚、辛、壬、癸十干大神], may the **Celestial Censor Lord** [天上御史君] absolve and atone.

If one has offended the **Eight Trigrams’ Great Deities** [乾、坎、艮、震、巽、离、坤、兑八卦大神], may the **Dao/Way and Virtue Lord** [道德君] absolve and atone.

If one has offended the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions’ Deities** [建除满平定执破危成收开闭神], may the **Heavenly Nobleman Lord** [天一贵人君] absolve and atone.

If one has offended the **Heavenly Dao, Earthly Dao, Human Dao, and Spirit Dao** [天道、地道、人道、神道], may the **Lord of Eternal Life** [长生君] absolve and atone.

**Humbly praying** that all may **settle peacefully in their stations** [各安乃位], **eternally secure in their abodes** [永奠厥居], **forgive faults and pardon transgressions** [赦罪宥愆], **bestow grace and confer blessings** [流恩注福], **extend the nurturing virtue of Heaven and Earth** [敷佐天育物之德], **and promote the benevolent intent of the Dao/Way’s transformation** [推助道兴化之心], **safeguarding the household’s tranquility** [保家宅之安宁], **and inviting the harmony of the numinous** [冀神明之协相], **thus manifesting the august creation** [式彰洪造], **and humbly soothing the common heart** [俯慰凡情].

**I, the servant**, along with the **fasting officials and the assembled congregation**, are **utterly remorseful and grateful for the divine favor** [无任忏谢希恩之至], **presenting the secondary wine offering** [酒陈亚献].

**I, the servant, earnestly and sincerely supplicate** the **Supreme Three Venerables** [太上三尊], **Five Elders of the Celestial Sovereign** [五老上帝], **the Three Treasures and All Saints** [三宝众圣], **the Inner and Outer Spirit Officials** [内外灵司], **the Six Heavenly Stems’ taboos** [六甲禁忌], **and all divine manifestations** [一切神明].

**Humbly hearing** that the **True Dao/Way is profound and mysterious** [真道杳冥], **embodying non-action yet transforming all things** [体无为而化物]; **the Sage spreads its marvelous teachings** [圣人敷妙], **establishing doctrine to perpetuate its scriptures** [因立教以垂文]. **Good and evil must be manifest** [善恶必彰], **and auspiciousness and calamity shall not err** [吉凶无爽].

Now, **I, the servant**, **a ritual officiant of such-and-such**, **fear that in my actions and undertakings** [运行举措], **I may have transgressed against the divine** [违悮神明]; **in selecting a dwelling through divination** [相宅卜居], **I may have violated the Heavenly Stems’ prohibitions** [犯干禁忌].

「The Daoist disciple Zhònglì, having compiled the *Three Caverns Canon Register* (三洞经录), now performs the **Ritual of Absolution and Blessing for Household Protection** (安宅解犯谢宠仪) in the stillness of night, ascending the altar as prescribed. The ritual proceedings follow the usual course.

The undersigned [certain rank] and the resident Daoist practitioner [name], together with this household, now humbly offer incense and earnestly invoke the following deities:
The **Great Sage of the Celestial Allocation** (大圣司命君) and his consort,
The **Six Jǐ Jade Maiden** (六癸玉女),
The **Lady Guang’s Attendant** (光姑室女),
The **Fire Hearth Cooking Mother** (下炊母),
The **Fire Force Officer** (行火力士),
The **Fire Father and Fire Mother** (火父火母),
The **Literati and Ink Officials** (文墨小吏),
The **Firewood-Carrying Laborer** (担柴力士),
The **Gao Liang Gentleman** (膏粱君子),
The **Upper Attendant** (上女),
The **Pestle Mortar Boy** (硎上童子),
The **Five Directions’ Auspicious Deities** (五方旺相君),
The **Great and Lesser Lords of the Five Directions** (大小君),
The **Purple Palace Celestial Deity** (紫微天神),
The **Lady of the Jade Pool** (玉池夫人),
The **Five Directions’ Six Bureaus’ Deities** (五方六府神),
The **Left Exhortation Celestial Emperor** (左扶天帝神) and the **Right Enclosure Celestial Emperor** (右房天帝神),
The **Left Nurturing Celestial Emperor’s Cherished Son** (左温天帝娇孙) and the **Right Nurturing Celestial Emperor’s Cherished Daughter** (右温天帝娇女),
The **Thirty-Six Lords Above Heaven** (天上三十六君) and the **Thirty-Six Lords Below Earth** (地下三十六君),
The **Three Primordial and Four Initiating Deities of the Five Soils** (三元四始、五土众神),
The **Filial Devotion and Benevolent Attendant Deity** (主簿孝眷神),
The **Five Prohibitions of Heaven and Earth’s Deities** (天禁地忌五行神),
The **Returning Soul General** (回灵将军),
The **Daily Guardian Earthly Deity** (日直土地),
The **Five Directions’ Dragon Kings and Celestial Emperors** (五方龙王天帝),
The **Lords’ Subordinates** (君部属),
And all **Spirits and Beings** (一切众灵).

Humbly, we acknowledge that our establishment of this altar and acceptance of official status are names already recorded in antiquity; our use of golden vessels and observance of these rites are also documented in the earlier scriptures.»

「The **Yellow Emperor** (黄帝) established the ritual rules for filial and respectful sacrifices to the **Hearth Deity** (灶君), and for ten thousand generations, none dared to neglect the **personal sacrifice** (躬之祭).

Within our household, the **highborn and lowly** (良贱之人), from dawn till dusk, engage in myriad deeds without understanding or discernment. They transgress the **divine hearth** (神灶), their worries unceasing, and in both public and private affairs, their schemes and undertakings are fraught with **entanglements and setbacks** (虑结迍邅之事). Sometimes, they invoke **misfortune and malevolent spirits** (祸横之灵), and though they offer thanks and apologies, they lack proper means. Only **fear and trepidation** (惶惧) follow.

Now, we select this **auspicious day** (良日), and perform the **rites of sacrifice and offering** (礼仪) with utmost solemnity. We **invite all the deities** (众神), humbly beseeching their **mercy and compassion** (慈怜) and praying for **universal blessings** (普降).

The **sacred spirits within and without** (中外神圣) graciously accept our sincere **devotions** (虔祈). They follow the **fragrant incense** (香雾) to our **ritual fast** (斋临), their hearts inclined toward us in **favor and grace** (流贶). Their **enlightened wisdom** (圣智) shines forth, **never neglecting our earnest efforts** (靡怠情勤).

Your humble servant, **unworthy of such devout prayer** (虔祷), prostrates and bows twice, presenting the **initial offering of wine** (初献). Scattered flowers.

A **proclamation or invocation** (宣牒或词) is made. Now, we **burn incense again** (焚香), earnestly reiterating our **supplications to the deities above** (上启). To the **Greatest Saints of Antiquity** (太古大圣), the **Heavenly Hearth Deity and his retinue** (灶君部属), the **Heavenly Hearth Deity who presides over the Five Spirits of Hearth** (司命五灵灶君), and all **divine beings who respond to inner and outer offerings** (内外感应), and **every spirit** (一切神灵),

We **humbly reflect** that in the **prosperous Three Dynasties** (繁昌三代), the **auspicious yellow ram** (黄羊) appeared at **morning and evening** (晨昏); in **all ages, this singular moment** (万世一时), the **white house** (白屋) may be **added to daily rituals** (日用). Your **power is shared with the Fire Element** (威分火德), your **radiance aligns with the Sun’s Dao** (道合太阳). Your **name is inscribed in Heaven** (名应上天), your **virtues proclaimed to Earth** (功宣下土). There exists the **principle of transforming calamity into auspice** (变祸为祥之理), and the **demonstration of dispelling malevolent forces and warding off evil spirits** (祛魔却怪之能). Your **transformative and nurturing power** (化生熟) extends blessings to **both ancient and modern times** (古今), while your **unimpeded spiritual efficacy** (运灵通) encompasses **mercy as vast as the universe** (恩如寰海). Your **divine might is unfathomable** (神威罔测), your **wondrous efficacy boundless** (妙用无穷).

Yet, this humble servant, **unworthy of refined understanding** (卑凡性识), entangled in **mundane affairs** (尘俗行藏), along with our **elders, young, females, and males** (老幼女男), and **those of high and low station** (尊卑良贱), have **recklessly stirred intentions and actions** (起心运意), **offending the sacred and defying the divine** (误圣违神).

At the **commencement of building the hearth** (建灶之初), and in its **very construction** (营造之始), we **moved earth without regard to omens** (动土工而无论凶吉), **laid bricks and stones without knowing their auspiciousness** (加砖石而岂识利宜). Sometimes, the **structure was flawed** (状失规模), **mixing old and new elements** (□杂新故); sometimes, the **clay was unclean** (泥涂不洁), the **design improper** (式样乖疏). We **chose days rarely auspicious** (择日罕遇於良辰), and **offered sacrifices without following proper rites** (奉祭莫遵於轨范). The **cauldron was once used in unclean places** (釜曾经於秽所), the **ground may have been buried with the dead** (地或瘗於伏尸).

Among our **kinsmen and attendants, near and distant** (眷属亲疏), some **treated the deities lightly** (轻神), **offered insufficient rites** (薄礼). We **mistakenly prioritized great and small offerings** (大小误错), **sampling food before the sacrifice** (於未祭以先尝). Even in **gathering firewood for domestic use** (入宅樵薪), we **recklessly ventured into ancestral mounds and shrines** (宁测於丘陵社庙). In **preparing meals and cooking** (供时烧爨), we **did not heed the harm of winds and □** (焉知其风□雷伤).

Our **ritual fasts were improperly conducted** (困损误修), **our Dao names violated taboos** (道名触讳). Our **cups and bowls for food** (杯盂食器) were **not made in accordance with the Hearth Deity’s standards** (罔同制於灶君); our **chickens and pigs** (鸡豚), along with **hair and feathers** (毛发), were **offered without proper reverence** (冒冲於前后).

We **did not guard against forbidden omens** (不防於忌讳) in our **soup and water**, **pouring them out or extinguishing flames**; we **did not consider the weight of offerings** (弗顾於重轻) in our **cooking and steaming**, **presenting high or low sacrifices**. We **failed to offer sacrifices at the auspicious hours of the Tiger and Rabbit** (无生於寅卯), **neglecting the proper timing for water and metal elements** (水金乏祭於时辰).

Now, we **offer sincere repentance** (忏谢必伸), **begging for divine forgiveness and pardon** (乞垂赦宥).

Your humble servant, **unworthy of utmost devotion** (不任精诚恳祷之至), bows twice and burns incense, presenting the **secondary offering of wine** (亚献). Scattered flowers.

We **earnestly reiterate our supplications** (谨重诚上启), to the **Greatest Saint, Hearth Deity of the Five Spirits** (司命五灵灶君), and all **seated sacred spirits** (合坐一切众圣).

Now, we **devout disciples** (奉道弟子某), both **elders and juniors** (一家长少), **pour out our sincere offerings** (再倾丹赤), **collectively informing all the deities** (共告诸神).

We **humbly pray for your consideration** (乞念凡微) of our **lowly and devout reverence** (鉴其虔仰). **Benevolently open your divine creation** (俯开圣造), and **bestow extraordinary blessings** (深布殊休).

This humble servant and all our **household, young and old** (合家幼艾等), **confess our past errors and misdeeds** (从来之误作故为), **sincerely repenting and offering thanks**. For your **future grace and forgiveness** (此去之垂恩降宥), we **solemnly vow to reform** (惟卜自新).

We **pray for honor and advancement in public office** (仕公有迁达之荣), and **prosperity and flourishing in private life** (处私获昌隆之福). In **times of wind, cold, heat, and dampness** (风寒暑湿之候), may we **borrow your divine light and protection** (各假恩光). In **cooking and steaming at all times** (炊蒸动作之时), may we **especially receive your benevolent grace** (尤加善贶).

May all **transformations and nurturing be complete** (化生成熟), **all blessings and auspices depend on your divine power** (锡福储祥). Truly, we **universally accept your boundless mercy** (寔普承於惠渥).

The **Hearth Deity’s celestial consort** (灶上姹女), the **Purple Darkness Heavenly Spirit** (紫微天神), **guides the smoke and flames to ascend the sky** (扶烟焰以飞空), **collecting warmth and radiance** (拘收燠赫). They **dissipate malevolent influences** (散神威而荡恶), **warding off evil spirits** (屏绝妖精).

The **Lady of Jade Pond** (玉池夫人) **removes all ills from smoke and fire** (蠲除烟火); the **Highly Virtuous Gentlemen** (高良君子) **bring joy and contentment to all spirits** (悦豫众神).

The **Celestial Emperors of Heaven** (天帝天皇) **gather auspicious blessings in our homes** (集庆祥於家宅); the **Heavenly Hearth Deity and his record-keeper** (司命司录) **bestow longevity and fortune on high and low alike** (注福寿於尊卑).

Our **sincere offerings rival those of Han Zhang** (投诚难比於汉张), and our **sacrifices are as earnest as those of the aged matriarch** (致祭朵敦於老妇).

Your humble servant, **unworthy of heartfelt devotion** (不任激切虔□), bows twice and burns incense, presenting the **final offering of wine** (终献). Scattered flowers.

We **earnestly reiterate our supplications** (谨重诚上启), to the **Greatest Saintly Lord** (大圣君), all **seated sacred spirits** (合座众圣), **who partake in our humble offerings** (共饮菲薄), and **graciously accept our prayers** (俯纳祷祈).

Your humble servant **devotes our sincere intentions** (发意精虔), **pouring out our hearts in gratitude** (倾心致谢), **fully confessing our mundane shortcomings** (具陈凡□), and **looking up to your divine mercy** (仰望圣恩).

We **humbly receive your compassion** (伏沐慈怜), **pray for universal consideration** (普垂鉴念). The **rites are complete, offerings presented** (礼陈荐献), and the **ceremony now concludes with prayers for expiation** (事毕祈禳). We **dare not linger further**, hoping for your **returning celestial presence** (回云驾), to the **abode of the Red Cloud of Freedom** (自在红霞之府), the **Palace of the Wandering Flame** (逍遥飞焰之宫), so that we may **forever wear the great benevolence** (永戴洪慈) and **swear to follow devoutly** (誓遵虔奉).

Your humble servant, **unworthy of lingering affection** (不任攀恋), bows twice in **final farewell** (奉送).

**Rites for Settling the Hearth and Invoking the Hearth Deity** (安宅谢仪 祭灶法).»

The Scripture states:

The Yellow Emperor, while gathering herbs on Mount Kunlun, encountered a woman. Astonished, he inquired: *"This is not a place where one should wander—how did you come here?"*

The woman replied: *"I am neither mortal nor a spirit, but the **Hearth Deity’s Cook** (灶中炊母). Though I possess divine transformations, I dwell among humanity. I come here each time to await your august presence, seeking to inquire about human fortunes and misfortunes."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to proclaim this for you."*

The Cook replied: *"In matters of human destiny, the **Hearth Deity** (灶君) is paramount—above as a celestial omen, below as a talisman, and among mortals as the **Hearth Deity**. All calamities fall under their purview, from the highest realms of state to the lowest of common folk. If one sincerely reveres them, blessings will follow. I now present the most essential teachings—pray grant them to be observed.

The **Hearth Deity** has **forty-two divine attendants**, some of whom appear on certain days, others not. If worshipped on their appointed days, blessings will come; if worshipped otherwise, misfortune will follow. Moreover, each month they consume different offerings, and their taboo names must be avoided—never to be spoken or transgressed. Now I shall detail these carefully; pray record them for the sake of humanity."*

The Emperor said: *"I wish to hear their names."*

The Cook replied: *"The **Hearth Deity** bears the surname **Zhang** (张), given name **Dan** (单), with his father named **Ji** (吉) and mother **Li** (利). He has six daughters:
1. **Gui-you** (癸酉),
2. **Gui-wei** (癸未),
3. **Gui-si** (癸巳),
4. **Gui-mao** (癸卯),
5. **Gui-chou** (癸丑),
6. **Gui-hai** (癸亥).

Additionally, the following are forbidden before the **Hearth Deity**:
- Appearing in **赤形** (naked or exposed form), disheveled hair, cursing, or shouting in anger;
- Weeping or wailing, whether loudly or softly;
- Offering firewood while pouring boiling water onto flames, arranging burning wood improperly, or placing copper or lacquered vessels in the hearth;
- Placing knives, axes, or brooms above or below the **Hearth Deity**;
- Burning disordered hair, nails, feathers from fowl, or branches of peach or plum trees;
- Pouring water over the ashes before the **Hearth Deity**.

If any of these transgressions occur, disaster will strike immediately. Furthermore, one must not sleep before the **Hearth Deity’s door**, discard unclean ashes nearby, or bathe children in their presence. Should these prohibitions be violated, one will suffer from poverty, eye ailments, or festering sores.

Instead, one must daily dispose of ashes in the **Southern Homogeneous Direction** (南丙地), ensuring prosperity and avoiding the listed calamities. If these precepts are disregarded, misfortune will persist—harvests will fail, litigation will multiply, and private grievances will fester. Be most cautious, for adherence will bring extraordinary fortune."*

*"Three Caverns Canonical Scriptures: The Disciple Zhòng Lì’s Compilation
**Explanatory Ritual for Mitigating Celestial Portents and Star Disasters**

With reverence, according to the *Daoist Canon: Scripture of the Numinous Terrace* (灵台经):
The Sun and Moon are the essence of **Yin and Yang** (阴阳);
The Five Stars are the essence of the **Five Phases** (五行).
When the Sun and Moon eclipse each other, the **Divine Manifestation** (神) is disrupted in its beginning and end.
When the **Great Star** (建星) falls, or the **Moon’s Eclipse** (月孛) disrupts the **Five Phases’ calamitous qi** (五行之沴气), it becomes the **Sweeping Star** (彗星);
The **Purple Enclosure’s Celestial One** (紫微天一), located beside the **Purple Enclosure** (紫微), is the **Dao Star** (道星).
Their movements in the heavens vary in speed and direction—some proceed with haste, others with delay, some in harmony, others in opposition—
and their yearly and monthly cycles differ in measure.
They traverse twelve divisions, with seven strong and five weak **Lunar Mansions** (宫).
These are the **Temples** (庙) and the **Kings** (王),
the degrees traversed by the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodges** (二十八宿).
Here, calamity and fortune are apportioned;
should they lose their proper station,
even auspicious stars may bring disaster.
If **obscure or malevolent stars** (暗曜灾星) appear in a **fortune-bearing direction** (吉方),
then there may be a **transformation of calamity into blessing** (转祸为祥).
By calculating the **natal year** (人行年) and tracking the **illuminations of the Five Stars** (五星之曜临照),
one may determine their respective portents of calamity or fortune—
the influences are without variation.
Thus, it is proper to follow the **rituals for mitigation and resolution** (依法禳解),
to depict their **sacred forms** (圣像),
and to offer incense, flowers, and named fruits in reverence.

One should invite **adepts of the Dao** (有道之士)
to recite the *Scripture for Delivering and Dissolving Calamities* (度人消灾经),
prohibiting entry into **ghostly or divine shrines** (鬼神祠庙),
and forbidding inquiries about illness or condolences for the deceased.

Further, the *Scripture of the Eleven Illuminations* (十一曜经) states:
If the Five Stars act contrary to their natural order,
overriding or clashing with the **Lunar Mansions and Lodges** (宫宿),
then one should **sculpt or paint their forms** (塑绘十一曜形仪)
and establish a **Daoist ritual hall** (道场) in a **pure and serene place** (清静处),
reciting scriptures and performing the **Way** (行道).

Again, the *Secretly Transmitted Scripture of the Five Stars* (五星秘授经) says:
With rare flowers and precious fruits,
clear water and named incense,
devoted sincerity and utmost reverence,
offer these as **sustenance** (供养).
All these are the **Most High’s** (太上) admonition to humanity:
**Fear the heavens and dread disaster** (畏天惧灾).

The **Master of the Du Clan** (杜天师) formerly had:
*A Ritual for the Eleven Illuminations of the River Chart* (河图九曜醮仪) in one volume,
and later, *A Penance for the Eleven Illuminations* (十一曜忏) in one volume.
When performed at the **three ritual times** (三时), they were incomplete,
so the **calamity-dissolving rituals** (消灾仪) were often incorporated.

Now, referencing the *Celestial Scriptures and Star Calendars of All the Heavens* (诸天文星历),
we supplement the missing rites as follows:
The **ritual diagram** (坛图) should correspond to the **four pillars** (四柱) of the practitioner.
For the **current day** (今日者), one must calculate the **Lunar Mansions** (宫) where the Eleven Illuminations preside,
dividing the **star altar** (星坛) accordingly.
The altar should align with the **four cardinal directions’ pillars** (四方之柱),
using a **crimson cord** (绛绳) of twelve *zhang* (丈),
wrapping it around the pillars in **two layers** (两层).

With **yellow paper**, craft the **twelve Lunar Mansions** (十二宫),
the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodges** (二十八宿),
and the **four fundamental stars** (四本),
as well as **placards** (牌) for the **Eleven Illuminations’ stars** (大小运十一曜星官).
Arrange these above the crimson cord,
and below, place **lamps for the Eleven Illuminations** (十一曜星灯),
offering **sustenance** (供养) according to their respective directions.
Each station should receive **incense, flowers, wine, and fruit**,
all in accordance with the prescribed method.
**Ritual Diagram for the Eleven Illuminations**
**Ritual for Mitigating Celestial Portents and Star Disasters** (解禳星运仪)"

「Opening the altar and performing the **Dao** ritual, the proceedings follow the prescribed order. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the **Dao** method.
Proclaiming the **Ling** (灵) and **Wei** (卫) sacred incantations,
the Five Stars align in radiance, illuminating the five cardinal directions.
**Mercury** (水星) repels calamities, **Mars** (木德) brings prosperity.
**Antares** (荧惑) dissipates misfortune, **Venus** (太白) wards off military disasters.
**Jupiter** (镇星) secures stability, benefiting the family and state.
Their names are inscribed upon jade tablets,
their words recorded in the **Di Fang** (帝房).
Ascending and dispersing in glory,
they soar through the boundless **Tàikōng** (太空).
Entering and exiting the unseen realms,
they traverse and revel in the ten directions.

Five **Yún** (云) clouds float as canopies,
summoning **Shén** (神) and restraining the winds.
Commanding all spirits,
they guard the **Xian** (仙) before the **Dao**,
harmonizing with the **Dao** and the True **Jūn** (君).

**Drumming the Law** (呜法鼓) twenty-four times,
we invoke the **Three Sovereigns of the Three Heavens** (三天玄元始三尊),
the **Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君),
and the **Supreme Old Lord** (太上老君),
calling forth their **Sanwu Gongcao** (三五功曹) ministers—
the **Left and Right Officials** (左右官使者),
the **Left and Right Incense Bearers** (左右捧香),
the **Dragon Relay Officers** (驿龙骑吏),
the **Golden Boy Attendants** (侍香金童),
the **Jade Girl Messengers** (传言散花玉女),
the **Five Sovereigns’ Direct Symbols** (五帝直符),
and the **Direct Day Incense Officials** (直日香官)—
each in groups of thirty-six.

Those who emerge are clad in splendid ceremonial attire,
their **guān** (冠) and **dài** (带) adorned with trailing ribbons,
opening the **Xuan Tan** (玄坛) to summon the **land spirits** (土地) and **regional deities** (方域神真).
I now establish this altar and perform the **Dao** ritual,
offering this with utmost reverence and sincerity.
All my earnest prayers have been recorded and heard—
I beseech the **Supreme Ten-Directional True Lord** (太上十方至真道君),
the **Lingbao** (灵宝) of radiant auspicious light,
to descend and flow into my being,
so that my invocation may swiftly reach the **True Dao of the Boundless Supreme** (至真无极大道),
before the **Celestial Jade Emperor** (昊天玉皇上帝).

I, [Name], along with all the assembled participants,
now offer incense to **return to the Dao** (归道),
to **return to the spirit** (归神),
and to **return to the command** (归命).
With these merits, I dedicate them to:
the **Heavenly Child** (天子) and his royal ministers,
all officials and their attendants,
scholars and **Du Shi** (度师) of the scriptures,
those dwelling in **Yan Qi** (严栖) forests and **Xiu Zhen** (修真) practitioners,
fellow students of the **Dao**,
all kin and relations,
the people of the world,
the **Fei Xing** (飞行) and **Dong Zhi** (动植) beings,
and all sentient life—
as well as my disciples and their kin.

I now offer incense,
universally extending repentance,
and **return to the command** of the **Supreme Ten-Directional Lingbao Dao** (太上十方灵宝自然至真无上大道).

I humbly beg for forgiveness—
for myself and all participants,
for the **Dao** ritual officials and their kin,
for all sins committed in past and present lives,
so that we may escape the **San Zai Ba Nan** (三灾八难),
the **Shi Ku Jiu E** (十苦九厄),
and attain **Dao** truth,
ascending in broad daylight to the heavens,
serving the **Dao Lord** (道君),
and wandering freely in the **Jin Que** (金阙) of the **Seven Treasures** (七宝),
the **natural Dao palaces** (自然宫殿),
eternally harmonized with the **Dao**.
My invocation shall be felt—
before the **True Dao of the Boundless Supreme** (至真无极大道) and all the **saints** (圣).

Repentance is proclaimed,
and the **true words** (真文) are announced.
I repeat the invocation of the **Law Position** (法位).

I, [Name], along with all the assembled participants,
with united sincerity, raise this to the **Supreme Boundless Dao** (太上无极大道),
the **Primordial Heavenly Venerable** (元始天尊),
the **Supreme Dao Lord** (太上大道君),
the **Supreme Old Lord** (太上老君),
the **Celestial Jade Emperor** (昊天玉皇上帝),
the **Purple Cloud Imperial Seat** (紫微帝座) and **Chen Ji** (辰极) **Heavenly Sovereign** (天皇),
the **Supreme Lords of the Ten Directions** (上方诸天大帝),
the **Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures** (三十六部尊经) and **Xuan Zhong** (玄中) **Great Law Masters** (大法师),
the **Eleven True Lords of the Great Illuminations** (十一大曜真君),
the **Southern and Northern Two Dipper Star Lords** (南北二斗星君),
the **Twenty-Eight Lunar Lodges Star Lords** (二十八宿星君),
and the **Twelve Divisions of the Heavenly Cycle** (十二分次周天) **Kan Xiang** (乾象) **Native Star Officials** (本命元辰星官).

I have heard that the **Primordial Sovereign** (元始) extends mercy,
embodying the **Great Primordial** (太元) to manifest the **Dao**.
With **Qing Luo** (青罗) attendants at his side,
he pities the **Yu Jie** (欲界) and speaks in golden words.
Whether it be the **division of fields** (分野) encountering disasters,
or the **auspices of the people** (兆民) facing calamities,
his benevolent will is felt,
and his words of guidance are revealed.

The **sun and moon**, along with the Five Stars,
adorn the heavens—
their movements are measured;
the **Tàipú** (太紫) stars and **Júxù** (朱序) constellations,
though their changes may bring calamities,
are governed by the **Di** (帝) above and the **regional deities** (臣庶) below,
to show the **division of auspices and portents** (谴告之祆祥).

Thus, he bestows the **Kan Wen** (乾文),
to exhaust the **Li Shu** (历数) through calculation;
and ascends the **Xuan** (玄) incantations,
to pacify and stabilize the **Jing Chan** (经缠).
All are decreed by the **Heavenly Sovereign** (天尊) for the world,
and the **variations of the stars** (星曜变) should be for good fortune.

I, [Name], a humble **Xiaotǔ** (下土) of the **Dao** teachings,
reverently receiving the **Xuan** (玄) mysteries,
though sometimes **E Yao** (恶曜) stars may appear,
or **Ji Xing** (吉星) stars lose their position,
I dare not evade celestial calamities—
thus, I make this supplication and perform the **Dao** ritual,
following the **Yi Ji** (笈) texts,
and solemnly conducting the **Zhuan Tu** (璇图) ceremony.

I, as a **Jiao Shu** (教首) of the **Dao**,
am ignorant of the **Wei Shu** (纬书).
When the **Heavenly Principle** (天理) moves westward,
I am deeply ashamed before **Guan Yin** (关尹);
when the **central stars** (中星) fail to hold their course,
I look up in vain to the **Heavenly Immortal** (昊仙).
Yet I know only to worship the moon and observe the stars,
perhaps to benefit others and aid all things.

Having received these words,
I dare not fail to present them above.
I proclaim the words—
let them be carefully examined,
and let my sincerity be clearly seen.
I focus my thoughts upon the **golden visage** (金容),
and tremble as if beneath the **Yujing** (玉京).
I direct my spirit to the **Xiang Wei** (象纬),
and shine brightly within the **Huang Dao** (黄道).

The **heavenly drums** (天鼓) sound of their own accord,
the **jewel bells** (琼锺) ring in response.
The **Ten Directions** (十方) and **Three Realms** (三界) resound with their presence;
the **Two Illuminations** (二曜) and **Nine Stars** (九星) gleam in alignment.

The **Yin Lin** (骞林) assembly gathers in solemnity,
yet their splendor remains undiminished;
the **Yujing** (玉衡) stars are perfectly aligned,
and none are out of place.

Our oaths are sincere and trustworthy,
and the **Jian Guan** (监观) watches above.

I, along with all participants,
now purify my body and mind with ablutions,
meditate upon the **secretly transmitted** (秘授) teachings,
and perform the **Dao** ritual in accordance with the **true exposition** (真诠).

With rare flowers and precious fruits,
I offer them alongside **incense of faith** (信香) and **clear water** (明水),
as I prepare my sincerity.
In **red footwear** (朱履) and **star-shaped crowns** (星冠),
I stand solemnly, like those clad in **golden swords** (金剑) and **cloud-garments** (霞衣).

I dare not forget my duties,
only awaiting the **Gan Tong** (感通) response.

The humble wish is that the **Supreme Three Venerables** (太上三尊),
the **Great Saints of the Ten Directions** (十方大圣),
and the **Enlightened Officials of the Lingbao Palace** (敕勒灵宝官属),
attended by the **Sutras of Awe and Spirit** (侍经威神),
with hearts united in harmony,
descend upon this altar,
purifying within and without,
subduing demons and malevolent forces,
illuminating the **Void of Non-Being** (虚无),
and manifesting the **True Spirits** (真灵),
so that my **fasting merit** (斋功) may be fulfilled
without obstruction or hindrance.

At the **auspicious hour** (明辰) the **Dao** is performed,
the **vigil** (续更) is maintained,
and the **incense** (香) is lit—
I now humbly commence.

**Twelve Vows** (十二愿).
Reignite the **incense furnace** (炉).

Incense Officials and **Messengers of the Dragon and Tiger** (香官使者、左右龙虎君),
along with the **Attendant Spirits of the Fragrant Incense** (侍香诸灵官),
should now command that at the place where I have established this altar and performed the **Dao**,
**golden elixir and emerald-green nectar** (金液丹碧) naturally arise,
along with **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad sacred spirits** (芝英百灵),
and the **multitude of True Ones** (众真) gather here
before this **incense furnace** (香火炉).

May it be so that the **Celestial Children and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions** (十方仙童玉女)
attend to the **fragrant vapors** (兰烟),
and swiftly transmit the **sincerity** (诚) I have humbly declared
directly to the **Supreme Ultimate Dao of the Boundless Heavenly Sovereign** (径御至真无极大道),
before the **Imperial Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Recitation upon leaving the hall** (出堂颂).
**Depart the door** (出户).

The **Comprehensive Daoist Rituals and Precepts** (道门科范大全集) concludes in its **forty-fifth volume** (卷之四十五).
**Volume forty-six** (卷之四十六) of the *Comprehensive Daoist Rituals and Precepts*,
edited by **Master Guangting of the Broad Nourishment** (广成先生杜光庭删定),
**Ritual for Mitigating Star and Fate Calamities** (解禳星运仪).
**Dao performance at dusk** (入夕行道).

「The ritual is performed with the altar raised as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Daoist rites, invoking the sacred spells of the **Spiritual Guardians** (宣卫灵咒).

The **Five Stars** (五星) align in radiance, illuminating the **Five Directions** (五方).
**Water Star** (水星) averts calamities,
**Wood Virtue** (木德) brings prosperity.
**Uranus** (荧惑) dissipates misfortune,
**Jupiter** (太白) repels malevolent forces.
**Mars** (镇星) secures stability,
benefiting **family and state** (家国) alike.

Their names are inscribed upon the **Celestial Jade Tablets** (玉简),
their words recorded in the **Imperial Register** (帝房).
They ascend beyond mortal sight, soaring through the **Boundless Void** (太空),
entering and exiting the **Mystic Darkness** (冥无),
wandering freely across the **Ten Directions** (十方).

The **Five Clouds** (五云) float like canopies,
summoning deities and restraining winds.
They command all **spiritual beings** (万灵),
protecting the **Celestial Sage** (仙翁),
harmonizing with the **Dao and True Essence** (道合真).

The **Law Enforcing Drum** (法鼓) is struck **twenty-four times** (二十四通).

We invoke:
The **Supreme Three Heavens** (无上三天)—**Primordial Heavenly Sovereign** (玄元始) of the **Dao of the Mystic Supreme** (三无极大道),
**Supreme Daoist Lord** (太上道君),
and **Supreme Venerable Lord** (太上老君)—
to summon forth from my body the **Three Five Officials** (三五功曹),
the **Left and Right Attendants** (左右官使者),
the **Left and Right Incense Bearers** (左右捧香),
the **Postal Dragons and Mounted Messengers** (驿龙骑吏),
the **Golden Boy Incense Attendants** (侍香金童),
the **Jade Maiden Messengers of the Five Flowers** (传言散花玉女),
the **Five Sovereigns’ Direct Talismans** (五帝直符),
the **Direct Day Incense Officials** (直日香官),
and the **Thirty-Six Assemblies** (三十六人) to emerge.

Those who depart are clad in **ceremonial robes** (严装) and **splendid attire** (显服),
with **headdresses and trailing ribbons** (冠带垂缨),
opening the **Mystic Daoist Gate** (玄坛) to the **Local Deities** (土地) and **Divine Beings of the Realm** (方域神真).

I now establish this altar and perform the Dao,
offering it with utmost sincerity.
All my **sincere declarations** (诸诚个) have been recorded and heard.
May the **Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions** (太上十方至真道) and the **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light** (灵宝瑞光) descend,
flowing into my body,
so that my words may swiftly reach the **Supreme Ultimate Dao of the Boundless Heavenly Sovereign** (至真无极大道)
and the **Imperial Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Recitation of the Law Enforcing Position** (请称法位).
In my **Law Enforcing Station** (具位), I humbly declare with sincerity to:

The **Supreme Ultimate Dao** (无极大道),
**Primordial Heavenly Sovereign** (元始天尊),
**Supreme Daoist Lord** (太上道君),
**Supreme Venerable Lord** (太上老君),
**Imperial Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝),
**Heavenly Sovereign of the Celestial Axis** (天皇辰极),
**Highest Supreme of the Highest Heaven** (上帝高真),
the **Ten Directions of the Dao** (十方得道),
all **Venerable Masters** (诸君丈人),
the **Great Law Master of the Mystic Middle** (玄中大法师),
the **Eleven Great Luminaries** (十一大曜星君),
the **Circular Enclosure of the Highest Symbol** (圆穹上象),
the **Southern Celestial Pole and Northern Dipper** (南辰北斗),
the **Twenty-Eight Constellations and Native Star of the Primordial Hour** (二十八宿本命元辰星君),
and all **responsive spiritual beings of the Three Realms** (三界应感),
and **every true essence** (一切真灵).

I have heard that the **Dao gathers in the Void yet has form** (法集虚而有容), named **Supreme Ultimate** (太极);
the **Heavenly accumulation has no substance** (天积无而无质), yet the **Three Celestial Lights** (三辰) alone are seen.

The **Sun and Moon** (日月) are the **essence of yin and yang** (阴阳之宗),
their waxing and waning marking the **sequence of cold and heat** (寒暑之序).
They disperse as the **Five Celestial Stems** (五纬),
their paths tracing the **stars** (列星).

All that the **Seven Luminaries** (七曜) govern
can be verified in **calamities and omens** (灾祥);
when the **celestial cycle is disrupted** (历周天而失次),
**misfortune and fortune are arbitrarily bestowed** (祸福爰私).

Only when they follow the **Yellow Dao** (黄道) without deviation
can the **greatest harmony of the state** (国家之至治) be seen.

The **Thirty-Five Divisions** (三十五分) determine **auspicious and inauspicious trends** (逆顺) under the **Celestial Stem’s governance** (乾纲);
the **Twelve Earthly Branches** (一十二辰) distinguish **China and the Western Regions** (华戎) in the **Earthly Branch’s records** (坤纪).

All within this **scope of influence** (范围),
are subject to their **radiant illumination** (临照之中).
When **virtue is cultivated** (修德), the **disastrous luminaries can be mitigated** (灾曜可禳);
when **meritorious deeds are accumulated** (积行), the **stars of virtue may gather** (德星或聚).

I believe in the **response of human affairs to Heaven’s mechanisms** (人事天机之应),
as **shadows follow echoes** (如影随响), and **declarations are answered** (答之符).

I, **a Daoist Practitioner** (奉道某), have long relied upon the **Three Celestial Lights’ guidance** (三景之照临),
and understood the **generation and restraint of the Five Agents** (五行之生克).

When disaster strikes, I am fearful, holding **a trembling and reverent heart** (懹震惕之心);
when virtue appears, I am moved, using **auspicious blessings to guide future fortune** (迪泰来之庆).

I dare to rely upon **divine spells** (神咒),
ascending to **align with the celestial luminaries** (格光灵).

Though my **professional duties** (职) are as humble as those of **a mortal scribe** (效於笺天),
my **studies** (学) have not yet mastered the **Heavenly Night’s revelations** (谙於宣夜).

Yet I am **mindful in dawn and dusk** (晨昏有觉),
observing the **rooster and dog** (鸡鹄) to **embrace shame and modesty** (包羞);
I **never forget the rites of eating and drinking** (饮食无忘),
still honoring the **wolf and badger** (豺獭) as symbols of **respect** (知敬).

Having received this **divine commission** (词捆),
how dare I not **report it to Heaven** (上闻)?

**Declaration** (宣词).
As prescribed in the **divine words** (词语),
I humbly present them to the **lofty celestial courts** (层宸).

**Great Luo’s Jade Purity** (大罗玉清) sits in the **assembly of the Ten Thousand Saints** (万圣闻经之坐);
**Taiwei’s Imperial Seat** (太微帝座) opens the **court where the Three Celestial Lights receive service** (三光受事之庭).

All **bow low beneath the celestial lights** (俯景以下临),
and **lean their brilliance to shine upon me** (倾光而垂照).

At the **rising sun and setting moon** (朝日夕月),
I follow the **prescribed rites** (采仪) of the **Celestial Register’s annotations** (璘存注之方);
in **worshipping the Dipper and the Honorable Stars** (祭斗荣星),
I adhere to the **steps of the Void-Walking Ritual** (步蹑空常之法).

Thus, I **entrust myself to the celestial lights’ protection** (托霄宸之荫),
using this to **mitigate the disparities in fate and destiny** (禳运数之差).

Now, in this **serene night** (静夜), as I perform the Dao,
I request the **Law Enforcing Assembly** (法众) to **kindle the initial incense** (运兹初捻上香).
May this **fragrant vapor** (香烟) ascend through the void,
offering **sustenance to the Supreme Three Venerables** (太上三尊) and the **Ten Directions of the Saints** (十方众圣).

I, **the Practitioners** (臣等), **return my body, return my spirit, return my fate** (归身、归神、归命),
and with these **merits and virtues** (功德),
I **pray for the current Emperor** (祝今上皇帝陛下).

I humbly pray that the **Imperial Virtue remains effortless** (帝德无为),
governing the **Northern Celestial Pole** (枢北辰) with **high and lofty authority** (高拱);
that the **Longevity Star** (寿星) shines **brilliantly and endlessly** (有烂),
facing **south with eternal splendor** (正南面以灵长),
that the **two celestial lights** (二景) are **united like a pair of jade tablets** (璧连),
and the **five stars** (五星) are **strung like pearls** (珠贯),
together proclaiming the **auspice of great peace** (太平之瑞),
and **manifesting the germination of the Supreme Virtue** (至德之萌).

Now, I **kindle incense once more** (故烧香),
**returning to rely upon the Daoist Venerables and Saints of the Supreme Dao** (皈依道尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
I **ascend to the formless** (升入无形),
harmonizing with the **Dao and True Essence** (和与道合真).

Now, in this **serene night** (静夜), as I perform the Dao,
I request the **Law Enforcing Assembly** (法众) to **kindle the second incense** (运兹二捻上香).
May this **fragrant vapor** (香烟) ascend through the void,
offering **sustenance to the Supreme Venerable Scriptures** (太上尊经) and the **Ten Directions of the Saints** (十方众圣).

I, **the Practitioners** (臣等), **return my body, return my spirit, return my fate** (归身、归神、归命),
and with these **merits and virtues** (功德),
I **flow back to my ancestral home** (归流), to the **billions of descendants** (亿曾万祖),
and the **nine generations of departed ancestors** (九世先亡).

I humbly pray that the **Heavenly lights of the Sun and Moon** (日月之明) be **revealed and unobstructed** (揭),
breaking all **darkness and confinement** (诸幽闭);
that the **celestial arrangement of stars and luminaries** (星辰之列) be **restored and illuminated** (复被灵光).

In the **refining courtyard of the celestial fire** (炼形流火之庭),
and the **purifying waters of the Yellow Flower** (濯质黄华之水),
may I **become a star or a moon** (为星为月),
and **reborn in the land of benevolent longevity** (还生仁寿之乡);
may I **take on celestial forms** (成象成形),
and **not depart from the age of the enlightened** (不外圣明之世).

Now, I **kindle incense once more** (故烧香),
**returning to rely upon the Venerable Scriptures and Saints of the Supreme Dao** (归依经尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
I **ascend to the formless** (升入无形),
harmonizing with the **Dao and True Essence** (和与道合真).

Now, in this **serene night** (静夜), as I perform the Dao,
I request the **Law Enforcing Assembly** (法众) to **kindle the third incense** (运兹三捻上香).
May this **fragrant cloud** (香云) ascend through the void,
offering **sustenance to the Supreme Three Masters** (太上三师) and the **Ten Directions of the Saints** (十方众圣).

I, **the Practitioners** (臣等), **return my body, return my spirit, return my fate** (归身、归神、归命),
and with these **merits and virtues** (功德),
I **flow back to the household of my Daoist lineage** (归流), to the **affiliates of the Practitioner** (奉道某等一门眷属).

I humbly pray that the **Lord’s table** (君表) **preserves auspicious omens** (储祥),
that **dark spirits be dispelled** (阴灵消慝),
and **benevolence and trust be profound** (仁深信厚).
May the **earth and wood** (土木) bring **rest and peace** (垂休),
and the **rites and justice** (礼重义荣) be **honored and illustrious** (介福).
May the **water virtue** (水德) **open and flourish** (潜开) in the **wise of the highest intelligence** (上智),
and the **comet star** (彗星) **remain pure and unsoiled** (无滓) in the **Supreme Clarity** (太清).

Thus, may I **fulfill the household of accumulated goodness** (积善之家),
and **share in the blessings of unending peace and prosperity** (均燕无灾之福).»

「Now I burn incense, humbly relying upon the **virtue/power** (德) of my **Daoist teacher, the Great Sage, the Perfect Ones** (皈依师尊大圣众至真).
After attaining the **Dao/Way** (道), I ascend into the **Formless** (无形), harmonizing with the **True Dao** (道合真).

I chant the **Four Directions** (方), confess the **Four Directions** (忏方),
thrice invoke, thrice bow in reverence.
I solemnly proclaim the **rank of the Law** (法位).
The **lowly disciples** (具位臣某等) of this **Daoist lineage** (奉道某),
with utmost sincerity and solemnity, present our supplication to:

The **Supreme Ultimate Dao** (太上无极大道),
**Heavenly Sovereign of Primordial Beginning** (元始天尊),
**Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君),
**Supreme Old Lord** (太上老君),
**Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault** (昊天玉皇上帝),
**Celestial Sovereign of the True Polestar** (天皇辰极),
**Highest True Emperor** (上帝高真),
the **illustrious Daoists of the Ten Directions** (十方得道诸君丈人),
**Mysterious Central Dharma Master** (玄中大法师),
the **Eleven Great Luminaries** (十一大曜星君),
**Circular Dome and Celestial Symbols** (圆穹上象)、**Southern Polestar and Northern Dipper** (南辰北斗)、**Twenty-Eight Lunar Mansions** (二十八宿),
**Native Star of My Primordial Destiny** (本命元辰星君),
and all **sentient spirits of the Three Realms** (三界应感一切真灵).

We have heard that when the **Heavenly Gate opens** (天开), the **Azure Palace** (碧落) shines forth its **radiant essence** (精耀) upon the **Three Stars** (三辰);
that the **stars reverence the Purple Enclosure** (紫微), fulfilling their duty in **shifting the Five Banners** (五纬).
When the **Moon adorns with three pendants** (月三珥), the world rejoices;
when the **Sun is twice central** (日再中), the imperial enterprise thrives.
When **Jupiter** (岁星) shines bright, the harvests are abundant and the nation prospers;
when **Mars** (镇星) lingers, the land is secure and its people enjoy profound blessings.
When **Venus** (太白) upholds **righteousness**, wars are restrained;
when **Jupiter’s Comet** (荧惑) guards the **heart**, one hears of **retreat and withdrawal** (退舍).
When **Saturn** (辰星) does not stray from its course, the years bring **abundance and joy** (丰年乐岁);
when **the Comet Star** (彗星) appears in the evening, the old is removed and the new is established.

The **Dark Void** (暗虚) is the **star of calamity** (建坠之星), hence it causes **eclipses of the sun and moon** (日月之蚀);
**Heavenly Yì** (天乙) is the **luminous manifestation of Dao/Virtue** (道德之曜), hence it governs the **appropriateness of auspiciousness and inauspiciousness** (吉凶之宜).
Descending upon mortals, it becomes a **deity** (神);
adhering to Heaven, it forms a **celestial symbol** (象).
Its waxing and waning are measured with precision,
its advance and retreat are without deviation.
Among the **three hundred sixty-five degrees** (三百六十五度) and the **myriad stars spanning thousands of leagues** (万有一千余里之众),
all are **constant stars** (经常之宿), yet they all return to the **hidden and concealed** (见伏之中),
bringing **fortune or calamity**, sometimes **slowly, sometimes swiftly**.

The **lowly Daoist Practitioner** (奉道某), reflecting upon my **humble station** (一介之贱),
yet equally sharing in the **harmony of the Two Principles** (两仪之和).
**Tigers encircle, dragons coil** (虎绕龙盘), yet I often **harm myself at the furnace tripod** (自戕於炉鼎);
**Yang opens, Yin closes** (阳开阴闭), yet I remain **unrestrained in the pivotal mechanisms** (居不检於枢机).
All this arises from **a single errant thought** (一念之差),
leading to **the wrath of the Five Emperors** (五帝之戾),
damaging the **proportions of Benevolence, Righteousness, Rites, Wisdom** (仁义礼智之节),
and injuring the **cycles of Metal, Wood, Earth, Fire** (金木土火之行).
**Ghosts blame mortals for their transgressions** (鬼责人非), and **Heavenly calamities weigh upon things** (天灾物累).
When **stars and constellations collide and trespass** (星辰凌犯), the **celestial omens of fate** (运数) bring **blocked and strange occurrences** (屯奇);
when **the stars of my native constellation are in abeyance or imprisonment** (叶本休囚), it causes **obstruction in my official duties and personal affairs** (身官之滞塞).
When **Yin and Yang become bandits** (阴阳为寇), **cold and heat defy harmony** (寒暑乖和),
I do not encounter **the flourishing of the worldly Dao** (世道之亨),
knowing that all misfortune stems from **my own errors** (自人为之误).

The **lowly Daoist Practitioner** (奉道某) now **purifies my heart and repents my sins** (洗心谢过),
takes responsibility upon myself and **reveres the Heavenly威** (畏威),
follows the **rotation of the Celestial Axis** (璇轴) to **lay out my intentions** (铺陈),
and **establishes the Star Altar** (星坛) to **prolong my devotion** (延伫).
I humbly beseech the **Exalted Saints of Heaven** (霄宸上圣),
the **celestial symbols and banners of the multitude of True Ones** (象纬群真),
to **specially grant the favor of dispelling calamities** (特施涣汗之恩),
and **graciously pardon my accumulated offenses** (曲赦贯盈之咎).
May You **balance the celestial degrees** (调平星度) and **settle the Heavenly script** (安镇乾文).
Let **the Three Destinies and Five Phases** (三命五行) **all be absolved of their wrath** (悉蠲於战克);
and the **Seven Governors and Twenty-Eight Constellations** (列星七政) **be equally bestowed with auspicious omens** (同赐於休祥).
May I **reach the Horn** (躔角) and **attain longevity** (寿考耆庬),
**traverse the Tail** (历尾) and **prolong my descendants** (嗣昆繁衍).
May **Antares** (心宿) **strengthen the bonds of filial piety** (笃父子室家之好),
and **the Room Star** (房星) **secure the keys to my household’s prosperity** (固关键管钥之机).
When **the Southern Dipper flourishes**, may **rank and wealth flow** (南斗盛而爵禄行);
when **the Eastern Wall brightens**, may **virtuous talent be recognized** (东璧明而贤能举).
**Kui** (奎) is the **armory of martial virtue** (武库), and may it **never lack its provisions** (罔或不充);
**Wei** (胄) is the **Heavenly Granary** (天仓), and may all **receive abundant blessings** (咸臻有衍).
May **Pì** (毕) **conceal** (晦) **thieves who climb walls** (绝踰垣之盗),
and **Ghosts retreat**, with no **demonic mischief daring to enter my home** (鬼藏无敢室之妖).
May **Jī** (箕) and **Xī** (歙) **silence slanderous tongues** (而口舌消),
and **Void and Darkness** (虚暗) **banish malevolent disasters** (而凶丧弭).
May I **proclaim this to all under Heaven** (尽一天而遍告),
and **protect my household with universal blessings** (佑举室以咸宜).

My **uppermost wish** (上愿) is that the **nation’s longevity be extended like the Great Flood** (国寿延洪),
the **imperial reign endure eternally** (帝图悠久),
**times be harmonious and customs flourish** (时和俗阜),
**resources be abundant and people at peace** (物富人安).
May I **attain the concord of the Five Stages** (式臻五纪之和),
and **each living being fulfill its nature** (各遂群生之性).
Above, may I **align with the Heavenly Sovereign’s vast saving grace** (上明天尊广济之泽),
and below, may I **fulfill the sincerity of my repentance** (下副臣等皈向之诚).
I present this with utmost reverence and humility.

**Twelve Vows** (十二愿).
**Replenish the Furnace** (复炉).
With solemnity, I **invite the incense officials and attendants—Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (香官使者、左右龙虎君),
and the **incense-serving spirit officials** (侍香诸灵官),
to **oversee the place where I have established the altar and practiced the Dao** (臣向来建坛行道之所).
May it **naturally produce elixir** (金液丹碧) and **precious herbs** (芝英百灵),
and may **all the True Ones gather here** (众真交会) at this **incense and fire furnace** (香火炉前).
May the **Daoist Immortals and Celestial Maidens of the Ten Directions** (十方仙童玉女)
**attend to the fragrant incense** (接侍兰烟),
and **transmit my sincere supplications** (传臣向来所启之诚)
**directly to the presence of the Supreme Ultimate Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault** (径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Exit the Hall and Recite** (出堂颂).
**Exit the Door** (出户).」

summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Functionaries**, the Left and Right Officials, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Dragon-Courier Messengers, the Golden Boys Attending Incense, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, the Direct-Day Incense Officials—**thirty-six in total**—to emerge.

**Those who emerge** don their solemn ceremonial attire, headdresses with trailing ribbons,
opening the **Mysterious Platform’s Land and Domain Spirits**.

I now ascend the platform, establish the **Great Ritual**, and practice the Dao,
sincerely offering my heart’s intent. My earnest supplications have been recorded and transmitted.
I pray for the **Supreme Ten-Directional True Dao Sovereigns** to descend their **Sacred Treasure Radiance**,
flowing into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Supreme Ultimate Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**.

**Proclaim the Ritual Rank.**

**The humble officials** [names],
with utmost sincerity, humbly address:
The **Primordial Sovereign of the Void-Natural**, the **Most High Dao Sovereign**, the **Most High Laozi**, the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault**, the **Nine Sovereigns Most High**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Sacred Scriptures’ Grand Master of the Mysterious Middle**, the **Sun and Moon, Nine Luminaries, Star Sovereigns**, the **Southern Dipper, Northern Dipper, Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Celestial Diagrams of the Revolving Heaven**, the **Native Star Sovereign of My Destiny**, and all **True Spirits responsive to the Three Realms**.

I have heard that from the undifferentiated chaos, the clear and turbid were first divided.
The Two Principles took their places, the Nine Luminaries shone forth.
Life and creation bestowed the ungoverned merit, illuminating the impartial virtue.
Ancient and modern remain unerring, celestial omens held in reverence.
Thus, following the established path brings blessings to ruler and subject;
heeding celestial warnings brings prosperity to family and state.
Divine transformations manifest, the sacred function accomplished.
Heaven’s Way is near—sentiments, when sincere, are answered.
The Holy Vision is not distant—no prayer goes unanswered.

**Repeat the Ritual Rank.**

**The humble officials** [names],
once more with united sincerity, address:
The **Nine Sovereigns Most High**, the **Ten-Directional Saints**, the **Five Stars and Six Luminaries**, the **Three Realms’ Mighty Spirits**.

I have heard that **Heaven’s yang and Earth’s yin**, in union, form the pattern;
the **moon’s fullness and the sun’s decline**, in alternation, regulate the times.

The **Five Celestial Stems** divide their duties with strict governance,
and traverse the **Circumference of Heaven** with measured steps.
Sometimes they manifest as **revolving wheels** of auspicious signs,
sometimes they cluster in **stellar mansions** where destinies arise,
sometimes they serve as **symbols of the highest virtue**,
and **illuminate the boundless compassion** of the **Way**.

Following their **lunar stations** and **celestial tracks**,
they **burn brightly** as the **radiant symbols of governance**;
when their **colors change**, they **foreshadow calamities**,
and **reveal the subtle omens** of fate.
Their **auspicious and inauspicious portents** are deeply tied to the **state’s affairs**,
and **celestial anomalies** likewise affect the **people’s lives**.

I have been granted **life by Heaven**,
yet **eclipses occur upon Earth**.
If the **Six Directions** regard me with scrutiny,
how much less than a **locust plague** am I?
If the **Five Agents** measure me for form,
how can I endure like **grass and trees**?

I **coarsely** know that **doing good** is the **greatest joy**,
yet I **fail to cease my faults** and cannot achieve it.
When the **Divine Calendar** reaches its fullness,
and the **eclipses converge** in their **awarding of punishments**,
the **Heavenly Sovereign** descends with **wrathful splendor**,
and **confusion brings forth disasters** once more.

I still **aspire to the path of enlightenment**,
to **attain the blessings** of the **Way’s guidance**.
Thus I **revere the Dao’s principles**,
and **solemnly open the Star Altar**,
sending my **refined essence** to the **Pivot of Heaven**,
and **invoking the luminous Spirits** of the **Dark Symbols**.

I now **submit my petition**,
daring not to **fail in reporting it upward**.

**Proclaim the words**, then **offer the secondary libation**.
**Carefully examine** the **prayer’s language**,
and **clearly see** the **veneration and reverence**.
The **Supreme Most High** stands **perched in majesty**,
and **graciously descends** to the **Dharma seat**,
while the **True Ones** gather in **abundant splendor**,
all **respectfully attending** the **Empty Sovereign**.

I trust that **Heaven’s discerning gaze** will **illuminate my sincere devotion**,
and that **certainly** the **Saints** will **take pity** on my **earnest supplication**.

May I **rectify the Celestial Pivot** in the **Jade Dipper**,
and **smooth the Celestial Loom** in the **Heavenly Chart**,
to **dispel the Five Agents’ calamities**,
and **break the Three Fates’ malevolent decrees**,
to **lengthen and supplement** what is lacking,
and **remove dangers** to achieve **tranquility**,
so that I may **attain the years of the wise and aged**,
and **forever cease** the **disasters of calamity**.

I and my companions,
with **uttermost devotion** in our **supplications**,
**present the final libation**.

**Scatter flowers**.

I **sincerely and reverently** submit:
The **Empty Origin’s True Saints**,
the **Nine Manifestations of Auspicious Stars**.

I have heard that **celestial symbols descend from the vault**,
and **illuminate the lands below**.
**Gold, Wood, Water, and Fire**,
**borrow the Agents’ auspiciousness** to **establish merit**;
**Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter**,
**fulfill their cycles** to **complete the year**.

To **benefit the family and the state**,
and **bless all living beings**,
how **great** is the **Divine Auspiciousness**,
**praised throughout Heaven and Earth**!

Yet I **fear** that within my **allotted domain**,
there may be a **time when I am harmed by hooks**;
and in the **sequence of stations**,
there may be **delays, detentions, or rebellious omens**.

The **greater disasters** may **ensnare the districts**,
bringing **wars, floods, droughts, and locust plagues**!
The **lesser calamities** may **afflict my years**,
bringing **misfortune, grief, sickness, and adversity**.

With **constant vigilance and dread**,
like **ice and fire** in my heart,
I deeply fear that **my actions may often stray**,
and **my conduct may deviate from the Dao**,
that **the Six Passions** accumulate **guilt**,
and **the Three Karma** lead to **transgressions**.

Having **amassed many crimes**,
and **further encountering inauspicious conjunctions**,
good deeds **fail to take root**,
while **evil actions readily arise**—
without **rites of expiation and supplication**,
there is **no way to purify** them.

Thus I **dare to solemnly kindle incense and fire**,
and **meticulously prepare the expiatory feast**,
**looking upward** to the **Purple Bureau** with **devoted heart**,
and **gazing toward the Vermilion Celestial Realm** with **prostration**.

I **utterly devote** my **sincere essence**,
and **fully reveal** my **mundane emotions**.

I **humbly beg** the **Saints’ compassion**,
that the **stars** may **take pity and protect**,
and **bestow true virtue**,
**mold me with Supreme Harmony**,
**illuminate me with luminous light**,
and **bathe me in divine grace**,
so that **blessings flow and descend**,
**disasters are resolved and calamities dispelled**,
the **Five Stars** are **harmonized and bright**,
and the **Four Seasons** are **balanced and clear**,
with **no rebellious eclipses**,
and **no partial obscurations**,
all **manifestations** achieving **serenity**,
and **all grains** ripening **in due time**,
the **Five Calamities** **ceasing their ravages**,
and the **Four Seasons** **restored to order**,
the **Sage-Ruler** **virtuous**, the **loyal minister** **steadfast**,
the **people at peace**, and **all things flourishing**.

Even if I **reside within the Twelve Lunar Mansions**,
or **among the Celestial Hosts**,
may **disasters not arise unchecked**,
and **evil spirits not act wantonly**.

The **twelve divisions of the Celestial Mansions**,
each **preserving their own auspicious signs**;
the **twenty-eight constellations**,
**forever free** from **harmful vapors**.

The **Six Stars** in the **Southern Memorandum**,
**extend life** through the **Scriptures of the Lord of Destiny**;
the **Nine Palaces** in the **Northern Origin**,
**grant longevity** through the **Tablets of the Supreme Sovereign**.

The **Three Luminaries** **align in brightness**,
and **all good things** **come to pass**.

If **disasters and calamities** **befall** me,
and I **reside in the mansions of the Great Sun or the Wandering Star**,
I **request the True Scriptures of the Red Sovereign** for **atonement**.
If **disasters and calamities** **befall** me,
and I **reside in the mansions of the Great Moon, Chen Star, God’s Head, or God’s Tail**,
I **request the True Scriptures of the Black Sovereign** for **atonement**.
If **disasters and calamities** **befall** me,
and I **reside in the mansion of the Year Star**,
I **request the True Scriptures of the Green Sovereign** for **atonement**.
If **disasters and calamities** **befall** me,
and I **reside in the mansion of the Great White Star**,
I **request the True Scriptures of the White Sovereign** for **atonement**.
If **disasters and calamities** **befall** me,
and I **reside in the mansions of the Stationary Star or other luminaries**,
I **request the True Scriptures of the Yellow Sovereign** for **atonement**.

Even if **all calamities vanish**,
and **thousandfold disasters cease**,
may **the Spirits be tranquil** and **rites harmonious**,
**fortune and longevity** **ever increase**,
**blessings and wealth** **ever renew**,
**misfortune and decline** **never arise**,
my **kin** **prospering in peace**,
and **public and private affairs** **thriving as desired**,
my **household flourishing**,
like **dark green leaves** upon the **roof**,
and **dew** descending as **I pray**—
forever **receiving the vast mercies**.

I and my companions,
with **uttermost devotion** in our **supplications**,
**sincerely and reverently** present **the final libation**.

**Invoke the True Scriptures**, and **proclaim the incantation**.

I **earnestly and sincerely** submit:
The **Nine Purity’s True Saints**,
the **Three Treasures’ True Spirits**,
the **Celestial Symbols’ arrayed stars**,
and the **Earthly Pattern’s principal deities**.

Now the **rites are complete** in the **pure night**,
and the **words ascend** to the **vast vault**.
The **Golden Gate’s True Procession**,
**dwells in the dusty world** with **attendants’ carriages**;
the **Jade Celestial Symbols**,
**follow the Dao** through the **Star Altar**.

My **heart** is **devoted** to **reverent acceptance**,
and my **conduct** is **already aligned** with **respectful farewell**.
My **devotion** does not **follow the words of the incantation**,
but **seeks to emulate** the **path of cultivation**;
my **mundane self** **longs to join** the **Celestial Dao**,
yet **remains deeply attached** in vain.

I **hope for** a **grant of universal amnesty**,
and **that my sincere supplications** will **be fully accepted**,
as the **True Guards** **revolve with words**,
and I **behold the Pure Light** in **orderly homage**.

I and my companions,
with **uttermost devotion** in our **supplications**,
**present the words** to the **Celestial Procession**.

**Express my vows**. **Reignite the incense**.

**Incense Officials, Messenger Officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals, and the Attending Spirits**,
you must **command** that the **place where I have set up the rites**,
**naturally produce** the **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade**,
**mushrooms and spirits of a hundred kinds**,
and that the **True Ones** **converge** here at the **incense and fire altar**.

May I **vow** that the **Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens**,
will **attend** the **Orchid Smoke**,
and **transmit my sincere petitions** directly to the **Supreme Ultimate’s Great Dao**,
and **before the Jade Emperor’s Heavenly Sovereign’s Court**.

**Send the Saints forth**, and **burn the effigy**.

**Ritual for Invoking the Stars: The Grand Petition Ceremony**

**At the quiet night of the ascension to the platform, perform the rites in proper order.**

**With utmost reverence, address the Eleven Great Luminaries of the Celestial Orbs;**
**the Twelve Constellation Deities, my natal star’s Great Saint, the Black Talisman Star True Lord, and all assembled Saints.**
**Humbly, we beseech Your Sacred Benevolence to condescend to our mortal plea.**

**Now, with sincerity, we offer our devotion.**
**Let the pure *qi* ascend as Heaven, arraying the likenesses of the sun, moon, and stars;**
**let the turbid *qi* descend as Earth, arranging the forms of male and female, beasts and birds.**
**When the sun and moon are eclipsed, the world knows no peace;**
**when men and women clash, the lofty vault of Heaven is imperiled.**
**Human fortunes and misfortunes are bound to the stars.**
**Without ritual invocation, how could we ascend to Heaven’s ear?**

**My misfortune star is in motion, and calamities press near.**
**With utmost sincerity, I implore the radiance of the Celestial Pivot,**
**and with reverent devotion, I knock upon the luminaries of the Mysterious Yellow.**
**With a heart in darkness, I prostrate myself,**
**moved by Heaven’s merciful love for the common folk;**
**with incense and talismans ascending to the skies,**
**I pray that the Emperor’s virtue may dissolve my afflictions.**

**May my misfortunes be dispelled, and my blessings and longevity flourish—**
**for Heaven’s aid is upon me, and virtue spreads far.**
**Yet my humble prayers are insufficient.**

**Next, summon the ritual officials in order to proceed with incense offerings and star invocation.**

**The Solar Palace:**

**governing the life-giving light that illuminates the myriad beings.**
**It shapes the spirit and body, commands yin and yang,**
**and the Vermilion Bird’s ceaseless day-and-night patrol,**
**while the Azure Emperor oversees virtue and vice.**
**Each time it fulfills its celestial course,**
**all things thrive and prosper.**
**Now, with incense and lamps prepared, we extend our utmost reverence.**

**May Your radiance illuminate and discern my decline,**
**strengthen my fate’s calculations,**
**and expand my blessings and fortune.**
**I vow with sincere devotion to endure Your boundless grace,**
**and now present my petition for Your proclamation.**

**Next, recite the talisman incantation:**

**Incantation of the True Lord of the Sun:**
*"Eastward, I gaze upon the Fuxiang Palace,*

*The Sun’s luminous brilliance—*
*vast and boundless, what thoughts does it hold?*
*Let me kneel in gold, awaiting Heaven’s noble form.*
*The Imperial Flower’s maidens descend,*
*now before the hall’s threshold."*

**The Lunar Palace:**
**With utmost reverence, address the Lunar Palace’s Sovereign of the Dark, and the attending celestial assembly.**
**Humbly, the Most Holy Purple Light of the Lunar Palace,**
**who governs the Northern Celestial Pole’s Yin Pass,**
**oversees the right *po* (ethereal soul) of humankind,**
**and wanders without rest, shining without end.**
**Its light divides short and long, revealing virtue and vice,**
**its movements and stillness arise from measured deliberation,**
**its expansion and contraction follow the cardinal directions,**
**and it brings forth fortune and misfortune—now full, now void,**
**bestowing calamity and blessing without error.**

**Now, with sincere prayers, I beseech Your discernment,**

**Next, the Talismans and Incantations are declared:**

**Incantation to the Water Virtue Star Lord:**

O wondrous talisman of the Five Stars,
As if gazing upon the True Gate.
Lofty in the *Chǒu* position,
The *Rén-Dì* Spirit Lords of the Caverns.
Their radiance congeals in purity,
The barbarians bow in reverent thought.
Celestial songs rise with dancing,
Ascending to the Golden Heaven for long.

**To the Earth Star:**

With reverence, I address the Earth Star, the True Lord of the Earthly *Tǔ* [Domain],
Attended by celestial retinues.

I humbly submit that the Central Sovereign is most august,
And the Five Stars rank first among them.
In the four seasons, they pay homage to the Supreme Deity,
Commanding all living beings,
Illuminating the ten directions for the common folk,
Circulating and protecting all classes.

Their austerity is profound, their will unyielding,
Most holy and exalted—
To encounter them is to invite calamity,
Yet to supplicate them brings peace and fortune.

Now, in this supplication of the Elixir Prayer,
I humbly beseech Your Grace to grant discernment,
To follow the True Talismans of the Most High,
To pardon the sins of all living beings,

The lofty vault bears the *Wu-Ji* [talisman],
Hidden lands rise to the Nine Heavens.
The Five Phases’ Lord shines in dark radiance,

Sweet stones [are] pushed aside, buried deep,
Potters and shamans calculate the void’s expanse.
The Celestial Sage descends with dew and rain,
The lowly bow in homage to the empty hymn.

**To the Luo[*] Star:**
With reverence, I address the True Lord of the Luo[*] Star, attended by celestial retinues.

Humbly, I acknowledge that Your Majesty’s virtue and power are most stern,
The Great Saint of Luo[*]—
Whose wheel illuminates the twelve mansions,
Whose influence flows through the twelve constellations.
If fortune is sought in wealth and silk,
Ancestral estates crumble, treasures vanish.
When Your radiance descends upon them,
Their might and authority are unshaken.
When You arrive at the *Kui-Gāng* [positions],
Hardships and calamities multiply.

Ever bestow your sacred light and grace.

My movements and dwellings secure and tranquil.
With this vow, I pledge this life to eternal reliance upon the Great Constructor.

With devout heart, I invoke the Great Sage of Wisdom and Longevity,
Whose inconceivable virtues and merits are beyond measure.

**Opening the Altar and Conducting the Dao**

The ritual proceedings commence as prescribed.
Each officiant maintains proper reverence in accordance with the rites.

**Invocation of the Guardian Spirits:**

The Five Stars shine in orderly array,
Illuminating the Five Directions.
Mercury repels calamity,
Wood’s virtue brings prosperity.
Mars dissipates misfortune,
Jupiter wards off warfare.
The Star of Stability governs with firmness,
Bringing benefit to family and state.
Names inscribed upon jade tablets,
Words recorded in the Celestial Registry.
Riding the clouds, they scatter their radiance,
Soaring through the void of ten thousand directions.
Entering and exiting the unseen,
Feasting in all realms.
Five clouds float as canopies,
Summoning spirits and controlling winds.
Commanding all spirits,
Protecting the Daoist Sage,
In harmony with the Dao and the True.

The Law-Drum is struck twenty-four times.

To the Most High Three Celestial Sovereigns of Primordial Beginning—
The Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Laozi—
We summon forth from within my body the Three Five Officials of Destiny,
Left and Right Attendants, Official Messengers,
Left and Right Incense-Bearers, Dragon-Courier Clerks,
Attendant Gold Boys, Flower-Dispersing Jade Maidens,
The Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans,
Direct Day Incense Officials—
A total of thirty-six officials.

Those who emerge are attired in solemn, resplendent robes,
Their headgear adorned with trailing ribbons.
The gates of the Mysterious Altar are opened,
Inviting the local deities and territorial spirits.

I, your humble servant, now conduct this ritual with sincere devotion,
Offering this as my heart’s intent.
May all who are earnestly sincere be recorded in the Celestial Hearings.
I pray that the Most High Ten-Directional True Dao of Black Soul,
The Sacred Treasure of Radiant Light, descend upon me,
Flowing into my body,
So that my petition may swiftly reach the Most High, the Supreme Ultimate Dao,
Before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault.

**Proclamation of Rank:**

Your humble servant [Name], along with all assembled here,
Now properly incense-offering,
With these merits, we dedicate on behalf of:
The Son of Heaven, kings and princes,
All ministers and officials,
Sages of scripture and ritual,
Mountain-dwelling hermits,
Seekers of the Dao,
Scholars of the Caverns,
Nine kinds of kin and relatives,
All under heaven,
Flying, walking, and growing beings,
All sentient life—
That they may return their bodies, their spirits, and their allegiance
To the Most High Ten-Directional Sacred Treasure,
The Natural, True, Supreme Dao.

I humbly beseech the Most High to grant absolution
To my ritual assembly and to the household of the Ritual Master,
For all sins of past and present lives,
Freeing us from the Three Calamities and Eight Hardships,
From all evil influences,
So that wisdom may be clear and radiant,
And our spirits steadfast and pure.
To depart from the path of delusion,
To ascend to the gate of supreme mystery,
Attaining the Dao’s True Essence,
Soaring through the void,
Ascending to Heaven in broad daylight,
Serving the Dao Lord in the Natural Jade Palace of Seven Treasures,
Forever united with the Dao.
My petition is now conveyed,
Directly before the Supreme Ultimate Dao.

**Ritual Homage to the Ten Directions, Confession of Sins.**

**Reproclamation of Rank:**

Your humble servant [Name], along with all assembled here,
With utmost sincerity, we now invoke:
The Primordial Heavenly Sovereign of Natural Void,
The Most High Dao Lord,
The Most High Laozi,
The Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault,
The Nine Celestial Sovereigns,
The Ten-Directional Perfected Saints,
All True Ones and Noble Lords,
The Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures,
The Grand Masters of Mysterious Symbols,
The Celestial Canopy, Sun, Moon, and Stars,
The Northern Dipper Emperor,
The Seven Celestial Ministers,
The Southern Polar Emperor,
The Lord Marshal,
The Six Celestial Ministers,
The Native Command Star,
The Cavern-Heavens and Ocean-Mountains,
The Officials of the Three Realms,
All True Spirits.

We humbly hear that the Dao is formless,
Yet its profound essence is sought by all.
When the True descended into the world,
The path of guidance was gradually revealed.
The Sage was summoned by the Celestial Master,
And the True Form manifested in Shu.
Where the Dragon Chariot passed,
The Jade Array preceded.
First expounding the Northern Dipper’s scriptures,
Then elucidating the Southern March’s teachings.
The Dao governs life and death,
Its officials overseeing the transformations of water and fire.
To those who understand the principle of separation,
They are the officials of Yang’s movement—
Ever still, yet never changing.
To those who master the principle of the Abyss,
They embody the One’s number—
Operating secretly without fixed form.

Thus, the mysteries of the scriptures’ opening
Reveal the essence of fixed contemplation.
If sentient beings hold fast to this with unwavering devotion,
Like the two poles adorned with celestial patterns,
They will not be swayed by external things,
Holding the Dao’s pivot to transform all.
Ascending to the rank of Spirit Sovereign,
Their wisdom illuminates, their spirits complete.
Thus, their hearing, speech, and actions are regulated,
And longevity and well-being are fully attained.

How much more so when the Sage points to the image and expounds the teachings,
Guiding them toward the Dao and turning their hearts.
If they fail to awaken to the Mysterious Words,
How could they transcend calamity and obstruction?
They must revere virtue and goodness,
Gradually attaining peace and prosperity.

I, your servant, have confined my physical form to the duality of question and answer,
Inheriting the spirit from the One.
I recognize the principles of health preservation,
Discerning the mechanisms of illness and misfortune.
Fortunate am I that the True Talisman has opened the gate of repentance,
So that the path of delusion may be illuminated.
I now properly initiate the Purple Altar Ritual,
Extending the Mysterious Symbols to their utmost,
Confronting the radiant spirits,
Welcoming the blessings of virtue.

I dare not fail to report this.
**The Petition is Complete.**

「According to the words of the Petition,
With sincere and earnest devotion,
I strive to honor the Two Extremes with equal reverence,
And exalt the Sovereign of the Nine Heavens with supreme veneration.

With heartfelt sincerity, I proclaim the One’s ultimate truth,
And with fragrant incense, I kindle the virtues of all beings.
I adorn the sacred seat upon the Mysterious Void,
And present the divine offerings before the Celestial Symbols.

In humble attire, my thoughts pure and focused,
The Star Altar radiates auspicious signs;
As the Bear Constellation traverses the heavens in majesty,
The Cloud Path shines with luminous grace.

With steadfast and lingering devotion,
No coldness lingers, but uprightness prevails;
With refined and concentrated intent,
If there is feeling, then understanding is assured.

I humbly pray to the Supreme Three Venerables,
The Ten-Directional Great Saints,
And the Mysterious Law Master of the Dao,
That You may extend Your divine discernment,
Oversee my humble supplications,
And command the officials of the Spirit Treasures,
Who attend the sacred scriptures and divine power,
The officials of the Vermilion Seal and Embroidered Robes,
Who bear the Yedra-Sheep offerings,
To traverse the skies with swift steps,
Assemble at the ritual grounds,
And record my virtues, manifesting my merits.

Let the gates of the vaulted heavens hear my plea,
And may the flowing essence scatter,
Dissolving the dark **Yin** forces of the **Camp** and **Wei** spirits.
I and my disciples, in body,
Shall be cleansed within and without,
Subduing demons and evils,
Reaching the Primordial Void,
All descending to the True Saints,
So that our fasts and rituals may be fulfilled,
Without obstruction or hindrance.

At dawn, I shall continue the Dao,
And once again humbly report.

**The Twelve Vows are Complete.**
**The Censer is Renewed.**

With solemn reverence, I now summon
The incense officials and spirit messengers,
The Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
And the attending spirit officials of the fragrant incense,
That they may naturally arise at the place where I have previously initiated the ritual,
Generating golden elixir and verdant jade,
Divine herbs and myriad spirits,
As all True Ones gather here before this censer.

I pray that the Ten-Directional Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens
May attend and convey the smoke of my sincere supplications,
Swiftly transmitting my earnest vows to the Supreme Dao of the Unbounded,
The Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven.

**The Praise is Complete upon leaving the Hall.**
**The Praise is Complete upon leaving the Door.**

**The Complete Canon of Daoist Rituals, Volume Forty-Nine Complete**
**The Complete Canon of Daoist Rituals, Volume Fifty**
*Edited by Master Guangting Du of the Broad Achievement*
**The Unified Ritual of the Northern and Southern Dipper Constellations**

At dawn, the ritual is performed as prescribed.
The assembled officials observe the Master’s intent in accordance with the Dao.

The **Sacred Guardians’ Incantations** are proclaimed:
The **Azure Yang Void** shines forth, its radiance reviving the numinous.
The **Divine Tiger** repels malevolence, the **Flying Celestial** tolls its bells.
The wicked are crushed, demons bound—ten thousand spirits submit.
The **Nine Mysteries** return to the Dao, the **Eight Awe-Inspiring Powers** gather essence.
A thousand True Ones are summoned, the **Three Primordials** purge the impure.
The Left **summons the Central Yellow**, the Right **deploys the Six Ding**.
Seven rotations, eight harmonies—revolving through the Celestial Scriptures.
The **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic, the **Great Dao** now unfolds.
Auspicious clouds disperse, merging with the **Yellow Court**—harmony with the Dao’s True Essence.

The **Supreme Law Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

We invoke:
The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Beginning** [三清],
The **Most High Dao Lord** [太上道君],
The **Most High Laozi** [太上老君],
To summon forth from my body:
The **five deceased officials of the Five Departments** [五功曹],
The **Left and Right Official Messengers** [左右官使者],
The **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** [左右捧香],
The **Relay Dragon Cavalry Clerks** [驿龙骑吏],
The **Attending Golden Boys** [侍香金童],
The **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens** [传言散花玉女],
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols** [五帝直符],
The **Direct-Day Incense Officials** [直日香官],
A total of **thirty-six**—all now emerge.

The departed array themselves in solemn splendor:
Crowns and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons,
Opening the **Mysterious Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits**.

Now, at this dawn ritual, I solemnly offer my sincere devotion.
My heart’s earnest supplications have already been recorded and presented.
I pray that the **Most High Dao’s Ten-Directional True Ones** [十方至真道尊]
May descend with **Sacred Treasure Radiance**,
Flowing into my body,
That my vows may swiftly reach the **Most High Unbounded Dao** [无极大道],
Before the **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝].

**The Law Position is Invoked.**

I, **Position-Holder [某]**, along with all assembled officials of this altar,
Solemnly unite in sincere invocation to:
The **Emperor of the Primordial Beginning in the Void-Natural** [虚无自然元始天尊],
The **Most High Dao Lord** [太上大道君],
The **Most High Laozi** [太上老君],
The **Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝],
The **Nine Sovereign True Ones** [九皇上真],
The **Ten-Directional Perfected Saints** [十方已得道大圣],
All **True Ones and Lords** [众至真，诸君丈人],
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mysterious Middle Law** [三十六部尊经玄中大法师],
The **Circular Vault’s Celestial Symbols, Sun, Moon, and Stars** [圆穹玄象、日月星辰],
The **North Dipper’s Venerable Emperor** [北斗尊帝],
The **Seven Celestial Ministers of the Primordial Stars** [七元辅弼星君],
The **Great Emperor of the Southern Dipper** [南极大帝],
The **Lord Marshal** [丈人司马],
The **Six Celestial Ministers** [六司星君],
My **Native Star and Hour** [本命元辰],
The **Peak-Hall and Sea-Mountain Spirits** [洞天海岳],
The **Three Realms’ Officials and All True Spirits** [三界官属，一切真灵].

I have heard:
The **Northern Dipper** dwells in the **Kan position**, where **Primordial Essence** is stored;
The **Southern Dipper** presides over the **Li mansion**, where **Supreme Divinity** resides.

The **Essence** descends to become the **vital spark** [精], to guard the form;
The **Spirit** condenses into the **soul** [神], to gather and sustain life [因以聚**生**].
All living beings depend upon them—
The **Two Poles** govern them in turn.

Their **virtue/power** benefits all sentient life,
Their **virtue/power** endows all movement and function.
Since the **Two Principles** [二仪] were divided,
They became the root from which all beings receive their fate.

**Heaven’s Yang** and **Earth’s Yin**—
The **Two Principles** respond and interact;
All classes gather in their kinds,
And the myriad things take form without deviation.

They shape the **transformative capacity** of **molding and refining** [成资陶冶],
To complete the **transformation of form** [遂器形之化],
Increasing the **rank and stipends** of scholars and commoners,
Bestowing **titles and orders** upon humans and celestial beings,
Extending or shortening lifespans,
Bringing or removing calamities and blessings.
Wherever life takes form,
None can escape their **granting or withholding**.

This **Ritual Master** [醮主] has long revered the **Daoist lineage**,
Yet has not yet transcended the **profane realm**.
Under the **lofty vault’s** shelter,
Beneath the **Dippers’ luminous governance**,
I govern myself—
How could I merely follow the **Middle Way**?
In dealing with others—
I fear only the **weight of excessive virtue**.

Advancing, I lack the **accumulation of merit**;
Retreating, I bear the **regret of later times**.
I wish to **invite blessings** and **sweep away misfortune**.

Thus, I dare to present the **Sacred Jewel’s ritual rites** [灵宝之彝仪],
To unfold the **clarity of the River Diagram** [河图之明训],
And join the **Ritual of the Two Dippers** [合醮乎南北二斗],
To reverently address the **Heavenly and Earthly Spirits** [遍仰乎天地众真],
To confess faults and pray for grace,
To **appease calamities** and **implore blessings**.

I have been granted access to **mystic profundities**,
And stand among the **True Officials**.
Gazing upon the **residual radiance of the Cross-Dipper’s rotation**,
I now present my **reverent submission at the beginning of the **Tian** hour**.

Having received this sincere petition,
I dare not fail to report it.
**Proclamation:** As the words state,
The **sincerity is profound and earnest**.

Thus, I rely upon the **Divine’s coming aid**,
To implement the **proper rituals of the **Zuo Valley** [敔谷之攸宜].

When **good deeds are done**, blessings descend—
As in the **clarity of Shang’s scriptures** [效商书之明训];
When **calamity strikes**, one fears—
As in the **precepts of Zhou’s music** [闻周雅之格言].

Now that this **sincere intent** has been revealed,
I hope for **Heaven’s compassionate response**,
That **pure winds may spread far**,
And **blessings flow abundantly**,
Committed to the **Ritual Master’s devotion**,
Illuminating the **Heavenly Sovereign’s supreme virtue**.

On this **clear morning**, the **Dao** is performed.
I request that the **assembly of **Law** bearers** light the **first incense strand**,
That this **incense smoke** may ascend directly to the heavens,
To **venerate the Three Supreme Ones** [太上三尊],
And the **Ten Directions’ Holy Saints** [十方众圣].

I and my followers **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**,
With this **incense-offering’s merit**,
To pray for the **Emperor’s longevity and prosperity**.
May the **Divine Plan endure eternally**,
And the **Sage’s life extend far**.

With the **Golden Mirror** held low,
All lands shall shine with prosperity;
With the **Jade Tassels** held in solemn dignity,
The **Eight Seas** shall be serene.

Let **loyal ministers** serve in the morning,
And the people attain **wealth and longevity**.
Let the **Empress and Consorts** be reserved,
To **assist in the auspicious period**.

Let the **Princesses and Princes** be secure,
And the **state’s fortunes rest in peace**.
Beyond the **Fire Rat and Dragon’s torch**,
Let **treasures and tributes** rush to come;
In the **lands of Yu’s springs and Meng’s valleys**,
Let **wagons and documents** flow as one.

Now I burn incense,
In **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—"Most True").

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
I ascend to the realm of **wuwei** (non-action),
In harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.

With today’s **auspicious dawn** and **Dao/Way’s** practice,
I invite the **Law’s Assembly** to take this **second twist** of incense.
May this incense’s smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To **offer homage** to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** sacred scriptures,
And to the **Sages** of the **Ten Directions**.

We submit our **bodies, spirits, and fates**,
That through this **merit/virtue/power**,
It may flow back to the household of **disciple** [name omitted],
Through **nine generations and seven mystical lineages**,
Countless ancestral branches—**a hundred million generations**—
And to our **living and departed kin**, as well as **spiritual rites**.

We humbly pray that, riding the **purple talisman’s** profound efficacy,
We may ascend to the **vermilion realm** of the **Immortal**s.

May **yang radiance** refine our essence,
And **fiery alchemy** transform our form;
Let **black records** be erased, and **blue registers** sealed.

In the **effortless realm of truth**,
May all **afflictions and misfortunes** be forever dispelled;
In **auspicious blessings** granted,
May we enjoy **peace and prosperity’s** enduring grace.

Now I burn incense,
In **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—"Most True").

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
I ascend to the **formless realm**,
In harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.

With today’s **auspicious dawn** and **Dao/Way’s** practice,
I invite the **Law’s Assembly** to take this **third twist** of incense.
May this incense’s smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To **offer homage** to the **Supreme Dao/Way’s** three **Masters**,
And to the **Sages** of the **Ten Directions**.

We submit our **bodies, spirits, and fates**,
That through this **merit/virtue/power**,
It may flow back to **disciple** [name omitted],
With **calamities and misfortunes** now stilled,
And **hardships** dissolved—
May the **Dao/Way’s** essence permeate our beings,
And **numinous truths** guard and protect us.

**Nanchang Master of Fate**,
Opens the **red ledger** to extend our years;
**Beifu Imperial Lord**,
Crosses out the **black records** to avert our deaths.

May our **souls and spirits** be cleansed and upright,
So that **all ten thousand beings** may long endure.

Our **kin and loved ones** share in **verdant blessings**,
Together basking in **auspicious fortune**.

**Ascending and descending** differ in **essence**,
**Movement and stillness** vary in **form**—
Yet all may be **bathed in celestial repose**,
And **attain bodily well-being**.

Now I burn incense,
In **sincere reverence** to the **Dao/Way’s** august and sacred **Sages**—the **ultimate virtue/power** of the **至真** (*Zhìzhēn*—"Most True").

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
I ascend to the **formless realm**,
In harmony with the **Dao/Way’s** true essence.

I **chant the directions**, **confess the directions**, and **walk the void**—
Three **rites of homage**.

I **reaffirm the Law’s ranks**,
And with **sincere devotion**, we now address:

The **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** of **emptiness and nature**,
The **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**,
The **Supreme Old Lord**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor**,
The **Nine Sovereigns** of **ultimate truth**,
The **Sages** of the **Ten Directions** who have attained the **Dao/Way**,
The **Most True** **Sages**,
All **honored ancestors and lords**,
The **Thirty-six Divisions** of **sacred scriptures** and **profound Dao/Way**,
The **Circular Vault** of **mystic symbols**—
The **sovereigns of the sun, moon, stars, and Northern Dipper**,
The **Seven Primordial Stars** of **auxiliary assistance**,
The **Southern Polar Emperor**,
The **Lord of the Six Ministries**,
Our **native star and fateful hour**,
The **Celestial Peaks and Oceanic Mountains**,
The **officials of the Three Realms**,
And all **numinous truths**.

We hear that the **Seven Primordial Stars** reside to the **north of Taiwei**,
As the **pivotal mechanism** of **creation and transformation**;
And the **Six Ministries** are to the **east of Shuo**,
Guiding the **termination and renewal** of the **sun and moon**.

Thus it is known that the **Fire Official** holds the north as noble,
The **Water Deity** the center as exalted—
One governs the **cycling of Heaven and Earth**,
Setting in motion the **balancing mechanisms** of **creation and transformation**;
One **honors the worthy and advances scholars**,
Illuminating the **profound virtue/power** of **rank and reward**.

They embody **Dao/Way and virtue/power**, casting their luminous influence,
Aiding **Heaven and Earth** in nurturing all things.

To **ascend in fortune and longevity**,
One must **pray to the numinous and true**.

From my **past life** to this day,
My **offenses accumulate like mountains and seas**,
While my **merit is as light as a feather**—
Sometimes defying **Heaven and Earth’s benevolent embrace**,
Sometimes betraying the **virtue/power of the sun and moon’s illumination**,
Violating the **nature of the Five Phases**,
Disrupting the **harmony of the Three Lights and Six Seasons**,
Unaware of **karmic causes and effects**,
Ignorant of **taboos and prohibitions**,
Transgressing sacred teachings,
Daring to offend celestial portents,
Never having **repented or atoned**—
Lest I invite **calamity and retribution**.

Now, **returning to the True** and **knowing my fate**,
I **repent in my heart**,
Hoping to **open the boundless mercy** of the **Great Forgiveness**,
That I may **find the path of self-renewal**.

I **revere the Six Ministries of the Southern Celestial Palace**,
And the **Seven Primordial Stars of the Northern Dipper**—
They **measure the essence of transformation**,
And none escape their **decree as the source of life**;
They **uphold the teachings of creation**,
And all things **rely upon them for sustenance**.

The solemn and reverent rules of the **Altar of Serenity** are observed,
With humble offerings of **incense and prayers** presented,
Words and sincerity poured forth in devotion,
Exhausting all intent to return with true faith—
Repenting past transgressions,
Amending future shortcomings,
Invoking a hundred blessings,
Purging all calamities,
Ensuring the unity of my family,
And praying for the peace of the realm’s borders.

To cease lawsuits and disputes,
That stagnant paths may open wide;
To attain prosperity and honor,
Hoping my petitions may be granted.

May I be **released from the register of the Underworld** in the **Domain of Ultimate Yin**,
And ascend to **renown in the Hall of Celestial Yang**.

May the **Imperial Vision** endure in **Enlightened Clarity**,
And the **Four Seas** forever resound with **abundance and prosperity**.

May the **beacons be extinguished**, the valleys at peace,
With no warriors at the frontiers;
May taxes be light and burdens few,
That every household may have scholars and poets.

May officials **align with the Celestial Pole**,
And the people **settle in harmony**—
Fitting that all hearts may flourish,
That all malevolence may return to rectitude.
May **Grace permeate all things, living and growing**,
And **Bounty extend to the remotest reaches**,
That the departed may escape suffering and be reborn,
And all beings may transform with the times.

Above, I honor the **Great Compassion of the Heavenly Venerable**,
Below, I fulfill my subjects’ **sincere return to fate**.

With reverence, I submit this petition.

**Twelve Vows.**

**Reignite the Furnace.**

With solemnity, I command the **Incense Officials and Envoys**, the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**, and the **Attendant Spirit Officials of Incense**—
That at the place where I formerly performed **morning Dao practices**,
**Golden Elixir and Jade Green Essence** may spontaneously arise,
Along with **Mushrooms, Herbs, and Hundreds of Spirits**,
As the **Immortal Assemblies gather before this incense furnace**.

May I now pray that the **Celestial Children and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions**,
Attending to the **fragrant mists**,
Convey my sincere petitions directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**.

**Exit the Hall.**
**Exit the Door.**

**The Complete Ritual Canon of the Dao Gate, Volume Fifty-One**
*Broadened and Refined by Master Guangting Du of the Southern and Northern Dipper Conjunction Rites*
**Midday Dao Practice**

The ritual ascends the platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.
The **Spirit-Warding Incantations** are proclaimed.

The **Cinnabar Spirits and Vermilion Fires** blaze forth, their flames surging like crimson clouds and gusting winds.
The **Red Wheel** rolls with unyielding force, its radiance piercing the celestial void.
Its might envelops all directions, transformations weaving through the ten thousand realms.
Molten gold cascades, demons vanish without trace—
**Evil is dispelled, fiends are shattered**, the **Original Virtue** shines forth.
**Golden Talismans** summon and command; the **Cloud-Striding Dragon** obeys.
Hymns of joy resound, petals scatter across the boundless sky.
Divine transformations unfold—**the Four Quarters prosper in harmony**.
Beneath the **Imperial Presence**, none dare be disrespectful—**harmony aligns with the True Dao**.

The **Supreme Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

**The Most High Three Celestial Sovereigns of the Primordial Beginning**—
**The Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi**—
**Summon forth from within my body** the **Three Five Officials**, the **Left and Right Attendants**, the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**, the **Dragon-Courier Clerks**, the **Golden Boy Incense Attendants**, the **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, the **Direct-Sun Incense Officials**—**each thirty-six in number**—to emerge.

Those who emerge are **arrayed in solemn splendor**, their **headdresses adorned with trailing ribbons**, opening the **Mystic Platform’s Earth and Domain Spirits**.

Now, as I perform the **Midday Dao Practice**, I humbly present this as my **sincere intent**. My **earnest petitions** have already been recorded and conveyed. May the **Most High Dao of the Ten Directions** descend with **Divine Treasure Radiance**, flowing into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the **Most High Supreme Dao of the Great Ultimate, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**.

**I now invoke the Law-Position** and, together with all the assembled officials, **sincerely present this petition** to:
**The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign of the Void-Natural, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi, the Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth, the Ten-Directional Perfected Saints, the Crowd of Supreme Truths, the Noble Masters of the Thirty-Six Departments, the Rounded Vault of Mystic Symbols—the Celestial Sovereigns of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, the North Dipper Emperor, the Seven Celestial Ministers of the Five Agents, the Southern Polar Emperor, the Marshal of the Stars, the Six Celestial Officials, my Native Star, the Cavern-Heavens and Ocean-Peaks, the Three Realms’ Officials, and all Divine Spirits.**

I have heard that the **Round Vault hangs its symbols**, the **waxing and waning** first governed by the **Seven Celestial Stems**; the **Luminous Patterns** shift in their courses, their rotation originating from the **Two Celestial Ministers**. The **Dipper Constellation** marks the celestial calendar, its meaning illuminated in the classics; the **Polar Star** governs the **Celestial Sovereign’s Chariot**, its **Jade Balance** establishing the moon’s course. The **Southern Dipper** resides in the **Tiger Position**; the **Northern Polar Star** truly rules from the **Central Axis**. The **Throat and Tongue** transmute the cosmos, their authority extending to **calendar and symbol**. The **Three Hundred Sixty-Five Degrees** uphold the **Celestial Temple’s guiding principles**; the **Ten Thousand Plus Stars** all submit to the **Dipper’s Ladle’s command**. The **Four Seasons** are regulated by the **Jade Candle**, the **Three Celestial Stems** respond to the **Bronze Instrument**—all governed by the **Two Poles**, assisting the **One Ultimate’s motion**.

All who dwell within mortal bounds **draw their essence from the Heavenly Pattern**. Though their ranks differ, their **principles converge in unity**.

I, **Dao-Practitioner [Name]**, though granted the **imperial mandate’s destiny** and endowed with **jewel-like purity**, am born of **water and fire’s fundamental nature**, the **Southern and Northern Dipper’s divine descent**. Though I wield the **four elemental forms**, I cultivate the **One True Root**. How dare I not **revere the Mystic**, striving to **return to the Origin**?

I establish the **Platform as the Dipper’s likeness**, encircling the **Imperial Seat with radiant light**; I offer **water and flowers**, gazing toward the **Celestial Pivot’s axis** with unwavering faith. The **rites follow the Secret Edicts**, the **solemn observances adhere to the unique laws**. With reverence for the **nearby威 (awe)**, I dare to **threefold prostrate my petitions**.

I dwell in the **Secret Hall**, ascending the **True Stages**. Though I follow the **Celestial Steps’ order**, I am unworthy of **Pengzi’s daughter’s ascension**; though I **light the lamp for the Dipper**, I lack **Deng De’s sincerity in subduing rebellion**. Yet, if I **proclaim the Mystic Teachings**, perhaps **auspicious blessings** may descend upon the virtuous.

Having received these **earnest words**, I dare not withhold them. **The Petition is Proclaimed.**

As the words declare, **my sincerity is profound and urgent**. May my offering ascend to the **Imperial Presence**, permeating the **Celestial Platform**.

The **Shared Governance** is just, the **Assisting Sovereigns** are impartial. **Life’s sustenance** is equally bestowed; **daily needs** are mutually dependent. Though the **Treasure-Sword** lies hidden, its light still shines in its sheath; though the **Abundant Fox** is of strange kind, it still extends its reverence to the **Dipper’s Ladle**. Since I possess the **most refined essence**, I must recognize **the Origin of All Life**.

The **True Body of the Dao** manifests through the **transformations of water and fire**; the **Heavenly Form** is ever-changing in the **celestial courses**. Thus, I **conduct the Conjunction Rites on this unified platform**, solemnly revering the **Supreme Celestial’s brilliance**.

The **lofty Heavenly Beam** spans the **Yellow River’s source**, its pillars interlocked; the **resplendent Jade Dipper** rotates with the **Dragon’s Ladle and Horn**, its motion ever-leftward. I **fix my thoughts on the high vault**, my spirit **soaring through the Mystic Symbols**, wishing to **descend upon the winds and clouds**, humbly casting aside past shame.

May all who pass be **transformed**, all who remain be **deified**—**bringing blessings to family and nation**. May **flourishing prosperity** bring **longevity and joy**, extending **blessings to both the visible and unseen**.

With **fragrant incense rising**, I **attain the boundless grace**. Now, as I perform the **Midday Dao Practice**, I request that the **Law-Assembled** kindle the **first incense strand**. May this **smoke ascend directly to the heavens**, offering **sustenance to the Most High Three Sovereigns and the Ten-Directional Saints**.

I, along with all present, **submit my body, my spirit, my fate**—
With these **merits and virtues**, I **pray for the current Emperor**.

May **clarity and brilliance** shine together, the **Celestial Pivot and Polar Star** align in harmony.
May **forms and symbols** be perfected, surpassing even my own body in reverence;
From **south to north**, may all be **molded by the Dao’s transformations**.

May the **Heavenly Steps** be unobstructed, **human culture** flourish eternally.
The **principles** gleam like the **order of stars**; the **land endures as Heaven does**.
**Grain and rice** abound like **water and fire**; the **seasons are harmonious, the years bountiful**.

Now, as I **burn this incense**, I **take refuge in the Dao’s Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**.
After attaining the **Dao**, I shall **ascend to the Formless**, **harmonizing with the True Dao**.

「Now, as the hour of **midday** approaches and the **Way** is practiced, I humbly **invite the Dharma Assembly** to move these **two incense sticks**, and **offer incense** to the **Perfected Saints and Supreme Truths**. May this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens, **supplying reverence** to the **Perfected Venerable Scriptures** and the **Saints of the Ten Directions**.

We **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, and with these **meritorious virtues**, we **return to the ancestral spirits** of our family’s past generations—both near and distant, kin and relations, the **shades of the night realm**, the **lingering souls of the departed**, those who dwell in the **lands of the rising sun** and the **boundless seas**, and those who traverse the **realms of Dan and Huo**, the **caverns of Yang**.

We **embrace the sun and grasp the moon**, **borrowing the force** of **Yin and Yang**;
We **mold the soul and cast the spirit**, **restoring the True Form** to the **voids of Li and Kan**.
We **attain life’s flourishing realm**, **bestowing blessings** upon future descendants.

Now, as we **offer incense**, we **take refuge in the Perfected Venerable Scriptures and the Supreme Truths of the Saints**. After attaining the **Way**, we shall **ascend to the Formless**, **harmonizing with the True Dao**.

**Practice the chant of the Square**, **confess the chant of the Square**, **command the demons**, and perform **three invocations, three obeisances**. We **request the proclamation of the Dharma Assembly’s ranks**.

We, **the assembled officials of this hall**, including **Subject [Name]** and all others, **sincerely unite in faith** to **invoke the following**:
The **Emperor of Natural Spontaneity and Primordial Beginnings**, the **Perfected Sovereign of the Great Dao**, the **Perfected Lord Lao**, the **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Supreme Heavenly Realm**, the **Nine Sovereigns of Supreme Truth**, the **Ten-Directional Perfected Saints who have attained the Way**, the **Supreme Truths of all Saints**, the **Venerable Masters**, the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Perfected Venerable Scriptures and Mystic Dharma Teachers**, the **Circular Celestial Mystic Symbols**, the **Sun, Moon, and Stars**, the **Venerable Sovereign of the Northern Dipper**, the **Seven Auxiliary Stars**, the **Great Sovereign of the Southern Pole**, the **Venerable Marshal**, the **Six Official Stars**, the **Native Star of Fate**, the **Celestial Caverns and Sea Mountains**, the **Officials of the Three Realms**, and **all True Spirits**.

We **hear in awe** that the **Creator** has no created things, yet nothing is without universal cultivation among the **mortals of the earth**.
With life comes birth, yet who among us **seeks in return** the **One Self**?

The **unaware** embrace of firm and yielding,
The **lonely** birth of vigor and compliance.

Lost in origin, forgotten in truth,
They stray and err, treading in transgression.

None awaken to **ascend** in this world,
Yet all receive their **inherent qi** from the **Celestial Balance**.

Lament the **embryo’s** first dawn—
Truly like the **primordial chaos** at its start.

The **true fire of the alchemical furnace** and the **divine water**,
Form the **Dan Tian** and **Vermilion Palace** of the human body.

At the **separation of self**, the **soul congeals** in the day;
In the **Kan-Wu month**, the **spirit** is shaped.

The **six viscera** and **five organs**,
The **nine orifices** and **hundred bones**—
All **gradually** take form,
Until **perfection** and **birth** are complete.

Some grow **wealthy**, some **noble**,
Some **lowly**, some **poor**—
Each follows the **emergence of their passions**,
None escapes the **world’s entangling snares**.

The **six desires** veil the **luminous nature**,
The **seven emotions** sever the **root of lasting vision**.

Having **drifted from the Dao** with **growing distance**,
They **rightfully** endure the **world’s hardships**.

**Celestial calamities** and **worldly burdens**,
**Ghostly accusations** and **human blame**—
The **celestial cycles** bring **Pisces, Hexagram 23, and Hexagram 24** upon them,
While **misfortune** and **hardship** assail like **summer’s heat and winter’s cold**.

The **mechanisms of rise and fall** are all hidden in **perilous □**;
The **paths of avoidance and pursuit** must be **heeded at the crossroads**.

The **Jade Bureau’s**遗言 **reveals the rites of expiation**;
The **Purple Court’s** secret edicts **grant the rituals of confession and atonement**.

Thus, **misfortune may be turned to fortune**,
And **virtue may be cultivated to avoid guilt**.

Now, **we humbly follow** the **Daoist Master’s** foresight of impending calamity,
Anxious in heart, and **diligently adhere** to the **Golden Mouth’s** teachings,
**Reverently opening** the **Idyllic Court’s** ritual assembly.

We **humbly pray** to the **Supreme Saint of the Void**,
The **Lofty and Vast Perfected One**,
To **enlighten us in self-renewal**,
To **rejoice in our repentance**,
And **command** the **Six Records of the Southern Palace** and the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper**—
To **tilt the celestial influences**, to **pour forth blessings**—
That **deep calamities and grave afflictions** may be **dissipated by the **Gang**’s pointer;
That **primordial sincerity** may be **augmented by the **Dou** and **Shou** stars**.

To **harmonize the celestial degrees**,
To **settle and pacify the heavenly orders**—
That **no calamity of the Five Phases** may flow contrary,
That **no fateful obstruction** may hinder the **Three Destinies**.

To **nurture longevity** by **strengthening the roots**,
To **preserve life** by **embracing the precious pearl and jade**.

Thus, **dwelling in security**, all actions bring **good fortune**,
**Extending blessings** to kin and **prosperity** to the household,
**Praying** for the **nation’s longevity** and the **Emperor’s enduring rule**,
For **no alarms at the borders**, for **all under heaven returning to virtue**.

May **all beings** thrive in **great harmony**,
Securing **peace** and fulfilling **nature’s intent**;
May **excessive darkness** be **dissipated by abundant light**,
Ascending beyond **suffering** to **transcendence**.

Our **devotion is insufficient**, yet Your **mercy is boundless**.
Above, we **honor the Heavenly Sovereign’s** boundless compassion;
Below, we **fulfill our subjects’ sincere surrender**.

**Twelve wishes** are **humbly presented**.

**The furnace is relit**.

**Reverently**, we **consecrate** the **incense officials and envoys**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
The **attendant spirit officials**—
That at the place where **we previously performed the noonday rites**,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** may **naturally arise**,
**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** gather,
As the **multitude of Perfected Ones** assemble before this **incense altar**.

May we **pray** that the **Ten-Direction Celestial Youths and Maiden**,
Attending the **fragrant mists**,
**Swiftly convey** our **earlier petitions**,
Directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extreme**,
The **Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Clarity**—

**Exit the hall in praise**.
**Depart the door**.

**The Ritual of the North-South Dipper Conjunction (Continued)**

The **Celestial Dipper** ascends to its proper station, the **Five Emperors** rest in reserve.
This incense is now burned, humbly paying homage to the **Master and Great Saints**—those who have attained the **Way’s true virtue**.
After attaining the **Dao**, one ascends to the **Formless**, blending in harmony with the **Dao’s true essence**.

Threefold repentance, threefold obeisance.
The **Law’s title** is invoked.
With sincerity, we—**officiants of all ranks**—prostrate ourselves before the **Natural Void**, the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning of Heaven**, the **Supreme Dao Sovereign**, the **Supreme Old Sovereign**, the **Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven**, the **Nine Sovereigns of the Highest Truth**, the **Ten Directions’ Great Saints** who have attained the **Dao**, the **Sages of All True Virtues**, the **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Profound Law**, the **Venerable Sovereign of the Heavenly Enclosure**, the **Celestial Dipper and its Seven Stars**, the **Supreme Emperor of the Southern Pole**, the **Sage Commandant**, the **Six Ministers of the Stars**, the **Native Star of One’s Destiny**, the **Divine Peaks and Oceanic Mountains**, the **Officials of the Three Realms**, and **All True Spirits**.

We hear that the **Three Luminaries** shine upon the heavens, all things benefiting from their **impartial illumination**;
The **Five Deities** descend in radiance, all growth receiving their **encompassing grace**.

Thus, the **Southern Pole** governs life’s birth,
while the **Northern Enclosure** presides over death,
overseeing the grand design and measuring the hidden and manifest.

From the **Primordial Chaos** to this very day,
the cosmic order remains unbroken,
the celestial cycles never err.
Above, the **Sovereign Emperor** reigns supreme;
below, all subjects—noble and common—
stand in dependence upon the **Celestial Master’s** rule,
relying upon the **Divine Grace** that sustains them.

Your humble disciple, [Name], has sincerely laid forth his petition,
which has already been fully presented.
By the grace of accumulated blessings,
I have been favored by the **Mysterious Virtue’s** power.

Yet the **Six Qi** govern the spirits’ movements,
while the **Five Emperors** refine their natures—
constant vigilance is hard to maintain,
while transience and retreat are easily lost.
Daily, I tread the path of **accumulating merit**,
yet also step into the realm of **transgressions unrepented**.
Whether from past deeds or present actions,
my offenses are recorded in the **Five Emperors’ ledgers**,
my sins inscribed by the **Three Officials’ pens**.
Without repentance and atonement,
there is no absolution.

Moreover, I fear the **Lunar Mansions’** influences may converge,
and the **fated years** of my destiny may now be upon me.
The years I have lived have passed through **critical junctures**,
and **calamitous encounters** may soon descend.
Perhaps I have caused **unintentional harm**,
or perhaps my **thoughts and deeds** have strayed into evil.
I have offended the **Heavenly Primordial** above,
and violated the **Earthly Virtue** below,
transgressing the **taboos of Yin and Yang**,
betraying the **Divine Light of Sun and Moon**.
My sins are vast and boundless—
without sincere repentance and supplication,
there can be no forgiveness.

It is said that the **Southern Palace** governs the **Yang Virtue**,
giving rise to all things;
while the **Northern Pole** is the **Hall of Final Judgment**,
commanding all spirits.
Life and death, fortune and misfortune—
all are recorded under its authority.
To remove calamities and resolve crises,
one must truly rely upon the **Sage’s Merciful Grace**.

«Thus I dare to unveil my **vermilion-hearted sincerity**,
and take refuge in the **mysterious symbols** of the Dao.
With devotion, I extend my **sacrificial prayers**,
and above, I kneel to the **august spirits**,
laying bare my heart in the **quiet realm**,
and revealing my earnestness beneath the **pure altar**.

I humbly hope that the **Six Palaces of the Celestial Mandate**,
will descend with their **merciful aid** and **compassionate grace**.
The **Seven Heavenly Guardians** of the **Celestial Support** and **Celestial Pass**,
will bestow their **compassionate blessings** upon me.

When the **Three Clouds** summon the **Divine Chariot**,
may it descend upon this dusty world;
when the **Eight Dao** gather their luminous essence,
may it bend to bless this sacrificial feast.

May the **True One** confer its **auspicious retinue** and bestow **divine favor**,
and open the **great celestial treasury** to prolong **auspicious fortune**.

I specially pray for the **suppression of Heavenly calamities** above,
and the **warding off of Earthly disasters** below.
To dispel the **ill-fated influences** of the **Five Stars, Nine Palaces, and Eight Trigrams**,
and to resolve the **misfortune** of the **Five Luminaries, Three Celestial Elements**, and **malevolent stars** lurking in darkness.

May the **Ten Celestial Deities** spare me from the **fear of harmful influences**,
and the **Mandate** cease its **obstructive punishments**.
May the **Residence Spirit** pardon its **divine reprimands**,
and break the **malevolent ghosts’** **oppressive dominion**.

Let the **Six Heavenly Stems** and **Five Earthly Branches** not suffer **decline and decay**,
and may the **supporting and opposing influences** of the **stellar palaces** not bring **harmful clashes**.

May I sever the **invasions of demonic spirits, witchcraft, and poisonous afflictions**,
and cut off the **plots of evil ghosts and malevolent humans**.

May the **palaces of the Three Officials** and **Five Emperors**,
**dismiss all accusations** and **resolve the lingering debts** of my past.
May the **souls of the departed and recently deceased**,
be **examined and released** from their suffering.

Under the **protection of the Seven Stars**,
and within the **auspicious jurisdiction of the Six Records**,
may **virtuous blessings** flourish and **disasters** dissipate like mist.

For all my **six senses’ offenses** and **three acts’ transgressions**,
and the myriad **thousand sins and ten thousand faults**,
may they all be **pardoned and forgiven**.

May the **Divine Light** guard and protect,
and the **True Essence** descend in **graceful flow**,
safeguarding my **frail and delicate form**,
and granting me a **longevity of firm and unyielding strength**.

Above, may I receive the **Heavenly Lord’s** **great compassionate blessings**,
and below, may I fulfill the **sincerity of my humble petitioners**,
thus safeguarding this **unveiling of my prayers** to present them.

**Twelve Vows** are made.
The **incense burner** is restored.
I solemnly command the **Incense Officials and their messengers**,
the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals**,
and the **attendant spirits** of the **Incense Assembly**,
to now order my sincere supplications,
which were uttered in the **stillness of night**,
to naturally produce **golden elixir and jade-green essence**,
and **herbs of myriad blessings and spiritual efficacy**.
May all the **Sages** gather here at this **incense burner and sacred flame**.

May it be so that the **Ten Thousand Directions’ Celestial Children and Jade Maidens**,
attend to the **fragrant clouds**,
and swiftly convey my **sincerely petitioned words**,
directly reaching the **Ultimate True Dao of the Boundless Supreme**,
before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Great Lord of the Celestial Realm**.

**Hymns of departure** are chanted.
**Steps from the hall** are taken.
**Exits the door**.»

They move freely through the **mysterious void** [冥無], feasting across the **Ten Thousand Directions** [十方].
The **Five Clouds** [五云] float as canopy, summoning **spirits** [神] and restraining **winds** [風].
They command the **myriad spirits** [萬靈], guarding the **Daoist retinue** [仙翕] above,
and harmonizing with the **True Dao** [道合真].

The **Sacred Law Drum** [法鼓] is struck **twenty-four times** [二十四通].

We invoke:
The **Supreme Sovereign of the Three Heavens** [無上三天], the **Primordial Beginning of the Mysterious** [玄元始三尊],
the **Great Lord of the Dao** [太上道君], the **Great Lord of the Daoist Way** [太上老君],

their **headdresses and sashes** [冠帶] trailing **pendant ribbons** [垂缨].
They open the **mystic gates** [玄坛] for the **local deities** [土地],
and the **regional spirits** [方域神真].

I now set forth this **Conjunction Ritual** [醮],
and humbly offer my **sincere devotion** [入意].
My **earnest petitions** [諸誠悃] have been recorded and heard.
I pray that the **Supreme Daoists of the Ten Thousand Directions** [太上十方正真道尊],
the **Sacred Treasures of Auspicious Light** [靈寶瑞光], descend,
flowing into my being,
so that my **supplications** [所啟] may swiftly reach
the **Ultimate True Dao of the Boundless Supreme** [至真無極大道],
before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Great Lord of the Celestial Realm** [昊天玉皇上帝御前].

I request the **recitation of the Sacred Law** [稱法位].

I, **the humble servant** [具位臣某], along with all the **ritual officials** [醮官] on this **platform** [坛],
offer our **collective sincerity** [同誠] in supplication:

To the **Primordial Sovereign of the Void** [虛無自然元始天尊],
the **Great Daoist Lord** [太上大道君],
the **Great Lord of the Daoist Way** [大上老君],
the **Heavenly Jade Emperor, the Great Lord of the Celestial Realm** [昊天玉皇上帝],

the **Venerable Northern Dipper Emperor** [北斗尊帝],
the **Seven Auxiliary Stars** [七元輔弼星君],
the **Southern Dipper’s Great Emperor** [南極大帝],

the **Six Official Stars** [六司星君],
my **Native Star and Birth Hour** [本命元辰],
the **Celestial Caverns and Oceanic Peaks** [洞天海嶽],
the **Three Realms’ Officials** [三界官屬],
and **all true spirits** [一切真靈].

I, the humble servant, have heard that the **Supreme Sovereign** [上极] is **boundless** [无上],
and the **Great Luo** [大罗] pervades all **Heavens** [诸天].
The **Mysterious** [玄] is profound yet again profound,
and the **Great Creation** [洪造] takes root in the **Primordial Qi** [元气].
Adorned with the **Three Celestial Lights** [三辰], their **symbols** [象] descend;
the **Purple Extremity** [紫极] is exalted, its **decrees** [图] proclaimed.
The **Four Directions** [四布] are spread, the **Seven Governors** [七政] are held in place by the **Southern Dipper** [南斗],
its **handle** [柄] raised to the **West**.
The **Nine Heavens’ Throat and Tongue** [九天喉舌] are stationed in the **Highest Heaven** [上天].

They **oversee the Celestial Pivot** [乾枢] above, and **embrace the Earth’s Measure** [地纪] below.
They **administer the rules of the Jade Canon** [玉局], in accordance with the **shared principles of the Two Extremes** [两极].
They **verify the records of the Bronze Ritual** [铜仪], observing the **limits of the Revolving Heaven** [周天].

All **circular-headed, square-footed** [圓首方趾] **efficacious images** [肖像]
are **descended spirits** [降神] of the **Southern Dipper’s Separation** [南離] and the **Northern Dipper’s Abyss** [北坎].
How dare I not **surrender in reverence** [皈依]?
I only hope to **return to Your grace** [冀回恩贶].

I, the humble servant, **devotedly maintain the purity of the Mystic Platform** [坛靖],
**fix my gaze on the celestial movements** [凝睇经躔],
and **offer pure, unblemished** [圭洁] **libations of tea and incense** [茶火],
with **steamed rice and fragrant clouds** [蒸馔], **dates and plump offerings** [枣云腴之荐].

The **Nine Bright Stars** [九微] rise in flames, the **Hundred Stars of the End** [百末] ascend in smoke,
forming a **strictly ordered feast** [严秩秩之筵].
I await the **graceful descent of the Divine Procession** [降飘飘之驾].

I pray that the **Nine Gates of the Mystic Caverns** [九扇] open for all,
and the **Ten Thousand Directions’ spirits** [十方] descend into the **ritual vehicles** [轮舆].
The **Phoenix canopy** [鹤盖] casts its shadow,
and the **auspicious procession** [扈和銮] moves with **proper order** [有节].
The **Rainbow banners** [霓旌] reveal the **Dao’s path** [启道],
and the **solemn retinue** [森仪仗] advances without **disorder** [无哗].

**Bending low** [俯临], You **oversee the pure and unblemished field** [圭洁之场],
and **graciously respond** [曲副] to my **earnest, urgent pleas** [翘勤之请].

I, the humble servant, along with the **ritual officials** [醮官] and all on this **platform** [坛],
cannot bear the **urgency of our fervent supplications** [激切延请之至].
With **deepest trepidation** [诚惶诚恐], we **bow repeatedly** [稽首再拜],
and **humbly welcome the Divine Procession** [奉迎圣驾].

The **True Ones descend** [降真], **tea is offered** [献茶],
**first offering** [初献], **flowers are scattered** [散花].

I, the humble servant, **devoutly supplicate** [虔诚上启]:
To the **Nine Pure High Saints** [九清上圣],
the **Ten Extremes’ Highest Immortals** [十极高真],
the **Venerable Northern Dipper Emperor** [北斗尊帝],
the **Seven Auxiliary Stars** [七元輔弼星君],
and the **True Sovereign within the Dipper** [斗中真宰].

I have heard that the **Primordial Qi** [元气] is **formless** [无形],
yet the **Dipper’s ladle** [斗杓] measures it.
The **Revolving Heaven** [周天] has **limits** [有度],
and the **Jade Balance** [玉衡] governs its **movements** [斡旋].
They **establish the Four Seasons** [四时], completing the **year’s function** [成岁功],
and **balance the Five Elements** [五材], holding the **fates of the people** [握民命].
The **Six Degrees** [六度] descend from **Heaven’s Son** [天子] to the **common folk** [庶人],
and the **year’s cycle** [一年运行] begins at **Han’s Ford** [汉津] and ends at **Camp Room** [营室].

There is the **Venerable Emperor** [尊帝] who **oversees the Daoist Path** [主仙道],
and the **Seven Auxiliaries** [建辅弼] who **assist the Dipper’s function** [佐斗功].
The **punishments and virtues** [刑德] of **life and death** [生杀] are **interwoven** [相参],
and the **official ranks and blessings** [官禄] of **longevity and wealth** [寿富] are **inextricably linked** [攸系].
If one **preserves a voided heart** [虚心以存],
then one may **ward off evil and resist harm** [御邪而敌害].
If one **follows the Dao’s method** [按法而步],
then one **can summon True Ones and attain immortality** [招真以致仙].

The **august power of the spirits** [巍巍神功] is **incalculable** [纪赞莫尽].
I, the humble servant, **trust my fate beneath the luminous Dao** [托迹光明之下],
and **rank among those who dwell in security** [伦安临照之中].

In the **stillness of the night** [清夜沈寥],
I **raise my gaze to the radiant light** [仰光芒] and **pay homage with reverence** [肃敬].
Amid the **turbulence of mortal life** [浮生胶扰],
I **offer incense and fire** [於香火] where they are **lacking or deficient** [之缺违].

I **seek longevity and health** [欲寿而康],
and **know fear when facing calamity** [遇灾知惧].
I **pledge swift response** [许亟伸] to my **ritual petitions** [醮告],
and **respectfully begin** [爰恭启] with the **platform’s rites** [坛仪].
I **follow the Golden Rules** [敬按金科] and **extend my humble supplications** [辄伸恳请].

Since I have **received Your compassionate words** [承词悯],
how dare I not **report them above** [上闻]?

**Words are proclaimed** [宣词].
**As spoken**, my **sincere, earnest petitions** [如词言] are **uttered with deep sincerity** [丹诚恳切].
I trust they **penetrate the Nine Heavens’ listening** [谅彻九重之听],
and **do not fail even the slightest good** [不违片善之微].

「Should disciples such as I—**whose palaces are obstructed** [身宫滞塞], **whose vital *qi* is imprisoned and weak** [气本休囚], **who suffer unjust afflictions from yin-yang imbalance** [忧致冤於阴阳], **and who seek to preserve life beneath the heavens’ shelter** [欲全生於覆载]—then I pray to **the Lord of the Acquisitive Wolf Star** [贪狼太星君] to act as our **protector** [保护].

Should one’s **fate be bound by hardship** [命元羁蹇], **with celestial influences causing obstruction and harm** [星度刑妨], **and who wish to escape peril and attain security** [去危而即安], **or to transform misfortune into blessing** [转祸为福], then I pray to **the Lord of the Great Gate Star** [巨门元星君] to **dissolve and mitigate** [消解] these afflictions.

Should one **aspire to officialdom** [弹冠愿仕], **seeking wealth and favor instead of tilling the fields** [干禄代耕], **and who inquire about the gates of imperial service** [问官海之要津], **or who step upon the illustrious paths of the celestial court** [蹑天朝之华贯], then I pray to **the Lord of the True Prosperity Star** [禄存真星君] to **facilitate our advancement** [迁达].

Should one’s **foundation of virtue and fortune be thin** [福基不厚], **with meager offspring and no abundance** [产殖未饶], **and who seek prosperity in both righteousness and material blessings** [於义利之交兴，愿富仁之兼美], then I pray to **the Lord of the Literary Harmony Star** [文曲纽星君] to **augment and bestow** [增注] upon us.

Should one **embrace the complete teachings of Confucianism** [行全儒素], **and excel in the arts of eloquence and refinement** [艺绝词华], **while aspiring to the highest ideals of virtue** [期志在崇高之美], **and who desire the honor of being chosen by the court** [得身膺宠擢之荣], then I pray to **the Lord of the Stern Integrity Star** [廉贞纲星君] to **manifestly assist** [显佑] us.

Should one **follow the natural course of longevity** [顺考寿历], **and who wish to reach old age in tranquility** [致耆年图安], **to leave a legacy for future generations** [以遗后昆], **and who delight in virtue while securing the Five Blessings** [好德而全五福], then I pray to **the Lord of the Martial Harmony Star** [武曲纪星君] to **extend and benefit** [延益] our lives.

Should one’s **descendants be few** [嗣息未蕃], **and the household face many hardships** [室家多难], **while pondering the stability of the pine and bamboo** [思保松萝之固], **and who wish to perpetuate the lineage like gourds and melons** [更延瓜瓞之绵], then I pray to **the Lord of the Star of the Broken Army** [破军关星君] to **fully safeguard** [全护] us.

I beseech that **our aspirations may be deeply felt and answered** [志愿感通], **that the true spirit may descend to meet us** [真灵降接], **and that all our wishes may be fulfilled** [万愿咸遂], **while goodness and virtue flourish** [众善兴修].

With **all the disciples** [臣与阖坛众等], **unworthy as we are of such gracious requests** [不任所请之至], we **reiterate the Great Sage’s Auspicious Northern Dipper Cauldron’s Vow** [再诵大圣北斗都管吉祥咒] daily:

*"The Northern Dipper’s Nine Stars, the Celestial Sage supreme,*
*Above attend the golden gates of the imperial court,*
*Below shelter the peaks of Kunlun.*
*They regulate the cosmic order,*
*Commanding the cycles of heaven and earth.*
*The Great Arc of the Acquisitive Wolf,*
*The Great Gate and the True Prosperity,*
*Literary Harmony and Stern Integrity,*
*Martial Harmony and the Broken Army.*
*The Lofty Jade Emperor, the Purple Micro Lord.*
*The Great Heavenly Cycle, refined to the subtlest dust.*
*What calamity cannot be extinguished,*
*What fortune cannot be attained?*
*The Primordial Sovereign’s decree is just,*
*Now merging with my form.*
*The Heavenly Ganges’ arrows strike,*
*Day and night, my life is prolonged.*
*Though dwelling among the vulgar,*
*I seek the Dao for lasting peace.*
*May I behold Your sacred presence,*
*And forever preserve eternal life.*
*The Three Palaces’ pure essence,*
*The Six Stars’ harmonious flow.*
*They give birth to me,*
*Nourish me,*
*And safeguard my mortal frame."*

**We humbly prostrate** [稽首致恭], **and respectfully present our offerings** [谨陈亚献]. **The incense is scattered.**

**Your devoted disciple** [具位臣某], **with utmost sincerity** [谨虔诚], **now humbly invokes** [上启]:

*"Nine Pure Celestial Sovereign,*
*Ten Directions’ Supreme Sage,*
*The Great Emperor of the Southern Dipper,*
*Venerable Master Sima,*
*The Six Departments’ Star Lords,*
*The True Ruler within the Dipper.*

**We hear that** the **Sun Palace’s radiant yang essence** [日宫至阳之精] **originates from the left boundary** [发轫於左界]; **the Southern Dipper’s stars’ celestial records** [南斗列星之纪] **proclaim their essence at the Yellow River’s source** [宣精於河源]. **Though named the Southern Dipper** [虽称南], **they align with the Sun’s course** [准日以生成], **and thus their influence extends to the North** [而在北].

**At the Han Dynasty’s capital**, they **supervise the selection of virtuous officials** [专贤良命禄之司]; **in the cosmic calendar**, they **oversee the affairs of generals and ministers** [主将相府庭之事]. **When celestial movements harmonize and the diagram of fate is correct** [运会而灵图正], **then the bright reign of the Sage’s Dao flourishes** [盛明则君道兴].

**They are the origin of all entanglements** [悼为缠度之元], **and they govern the fate of all beings** [宴主生民之命]. **With sincerest hearts, we make our petitions**, **and no wish shall remain unanswered** [倾心以请，无愿不从].

**Though we, the disciples of the Dao**, have **heard of the sacred elixir’s teachings** [闻挹酒之言], **we lack the strength to ascend to its power** [难接乘搓之武]. **Gazing upward at the celestial divisions**, we **find the North and South in confusion** [仰观分野，南北迷方]; **below, in constructing our ritual platforms**, we **establish positions according to the trigram of Water and Fire** [俯建坛场，坎离定位].

**We offer fragrant incense** [荐苾芬] **upon our humble seats**, **and with benevolent anticipation** [仁盼蠁], **we await Your descent in the misty heavens** [於烟霄].

**For the alleviation of calamities and afflictions** [有灾有患之禳除], **and the continuation of blessings and longevity** [延福延生之迓续], **we pray:**

Should one’s **fate be frail and fortune meager** [命元谫薄], **with scant *qi* of prosperity** [禄气单微], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Treasury** [天府司命君] to **augment and enrich** [增益] our lives.

Should one’s **name be recorded in darkness** [黑录着名], **and their celestial register be erased** [青宫削籍], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Response** [天相司录君] to **restore and amend** [回改] our records.

Should one’s **lifespan be unfulfilled** [寿历不修], **and their path in life be obstructed** [世途多梗], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Beam** [天梁延寿君] to **extend and bless** [延佑] our years.

Should one’s **health be discordant** [卫生乖和], **and their fortunes be limited** [布算有限], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Concord** [天同益算保生君] to **fully preserve** [保全] our lives.

Should **hardships assail relentlessly** [厄难相凌], **and our spirits fail to remain steadfast** [魂神不守], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Pivot** [天枢度厄炼魂君] to **alleviate and pacify** [禳镇] these trials.

Should one’s **life’s purpose be desolate** [生意萧条], **and their affairs meet with reversals** [事机紏逆], then I pray to **the Lord of the Heavenly Mechanism** [天机上生君] to **enlighten and guide** [启迪] us.

**Even if we, the disciples of the Dao**, **may only partially receive Your gracious spirit** [对服宠灵], **and imperfectly lead Your descent** [导迎休证], **with countless blessings bestowed** [百祥纷委], **and all evils suppressed** [众恶伏藏], **may the benevolence of Your response be evident** [式昭感应之仁], **and our humble petitions be granted** [少付倾虔之请].

**Though unworthy of such earnest supplication** [臣与众等不任恳梼之至], we **recite the Great Sage’s Southern Dipper Six Stars Celestial Vow of Longevity** [诵大圣南斗六星天纪延寿颂] daily:

*"The Southern Dipper’s Six Stars,*
*The Celestial Ministers supreme,*
*Above align with the Primordial Transformation,*
*And the Seven Governors follow in reverence.*
*Below they oversee the Yangzhou region,*
*And the lands of Wu and Yue are their domain."*

**The Celestial Registrar and Keeper of Fate** [司命司录] **hold in reserve the essence of life’s destiny.**
**The Celestial Beam and Celestial Harmony** [天梁天同] **preside over the reckoning of longevity.**
**The Pivot and Mechanism Constellation** [枢机之宿] **stands as the celestial court’s grand hall.**
**The Milky Way’s Bridges** [津梁云汉] **weave the cosmic threads of the Primordial Pattern** [纲纪乾文].
**Their radiance is luminous and pure** [光耀明莹], **embodying the Dao’s harmonious rule** [君道清平].
**They govern noble ranks and rewards** [掌理爵禄], **elevating worthy ministers and neighbors** [褒进臣邻].
**They assist the Heavens in upholding the Dao** [助天体道], **benefiting all things and securing the people** [利物安人].
**They determine the departure or prolongation of calamity and fortune** [去留灾福], **extending or shortening the span of life** [延促年龄].
**With sincere devotion, all petitions are fulfilled** [倾心求请，无愿不成].
**When the spirit is purified and rectified** [魂神澄正], **longevity renews itself** [寿命增新].
**Where their luminous essence reaches** [光灵所被], **eternal blessings and integrity endure** [永享利贞].

**This disciple, [某], humbly seeks eternal life** [弟子某命，愿得长生].
**The undersigned, with utmost reverence, prostrates twice and presents this final offering** [臣等稽首再拜，致恭谨陈终献].
**Flowers are scattered. Date wine is offered** [散花。献枣汤].

**The humble servant [某], with sincere devotion, now petitions above:**
To the **Nine Pure Ones, Ten Extremes** [九清十极], **the Three Manifestations of the Celestial Worthies** [三景诸真],
To the **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** [北斗七元], **the Six Celestial Records of the Southern Palace** [南宫六纪],
To the **Native Celestial Stem and Birth Command** [元辰本命],

To the **Earth-Water Yin Spirits** [地水阴灵], **the Sovereigns of the Void and Space** [虚空主宰],
To the **Responsive Spirits of the Three Realms** [三界应感], **and all True Essences** [一切真灵].

**Though we presumptuously incur celestial transgression** [臣等辄冒渎天之罪],
**as when the Imperial Throne of the Celestial Worthies was established** [如陈类帝之坛],
**when the Celestial Bureau was temporarily upheld** [王局暂扶], **and the assembled True Ones took their seats** [众真侍座],
**when the Precious Pearl was about to be presented** [宝珠将入], **and the three offerings were fully laid out** [三献毕陈]—
**O Celestial Dragons and Immortal Cranes** [龙鹤天仙],
**Hasten to return to the Jade Capital’s procession** [促返玉京之驾];

「O Turtles and Cloud-Eyed Spirits [Urturtle and Cloud-Sign Spirits],
As you rise in the vapor of blue incense [ascend in the azure incense fumes],
**We fear to offend the ritual etiquette of reverence and obeisance** [lest we violate the proper posture of veneration],
**And hasten our own doom in the realms of darkness and light** [and invite the retribution of the unseen and seen].

Yet we gaze back upon the **Celestial Procession** [Divine Convoys] with lingering affection,
And bear the **radiant thorns and brambles** [illustrious punishments] to atone for our faults.

**We humbly pray for Your mercy** [May You grant us compassion],
**And beg for special pardon** [and extend Your magnanimous forgiveness].
May the **stars of the Celestial Realm** [Celestial Stellar Hosts]
**Return to their proper order** [resume their fixed courses];
And the **immortal ranks of the Three Realms** [Sublime Assembly of the Three Worlds]
**Revert to their pristine essence** [rejoin the Mystic Source] **without trace**.

Though the **Divine Presence lingers as before** [the Sacred Communion remains],
How shall we **direct our gaze** [seek You with our eyes]?
Only by **day and night devotion** [unceasing morning and evening veneration],
May we **offer our sincere homage from beginning to end** [fully demonstrate our reverent submission].

**We, the petitioners of this entire assembly** [I, along with all assembled here],
**Cannot bear the depth of our longing and fervor** [are overwhelmed by our profound yearning],
**In deepest trepidation and terror** [with heartfelt dread and trembling],
**Kneel and bow twice in utmost sincerity** [prostrate ourselves twice in humility].

**The Twelve Vows** [Twelve Aspirations].
**Reignite the Furnace** [Reignite the Cauldron].

**In solemn reverence**, we **convey the incense officers and messengers** [entrust the Fragrant Officials and Envoys],
**The Left and Right Celestial Dragons and Tigers** [the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Celestial Worthies],
**And all attendant Spirits of the Incense** [and all Incense-Spirits in attendance],
To **directly oversee this very place where I have long offered incense and invoked the Dao** [superintend the site of my past supplications],
Where **golden elixir and verdant alchemy** [the Golden Elixir and Emerald Elixir] **will spontaneously arise**,
And **hundreds of rare herbs and spirits** [the Hundred Spirits of the Divine Herb] **manifest**,
As **the gathered True Ones convene** [the assembled True Essences gather]
Within this **incense-burning furnace** [fragrant altar-furnace].
**May they swiftly convey my heartfelt sincerity** [transmit my earnest supplications]
**Directly to the Supreme Dao of the Boundless and Limitless, the Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** [to the Most High Jade Emperor of the Celestial Worthies].

**Hymns of Departure** [Eulogies of the Departure].
**Exit the Hall** [Leave the Hall].
**Exit the Doorway** [Leave the Portal].

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 53 Complete**
**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 54**
*Revised by Master Guangting Du of Broad Achievement*
**The Unified Dao Ritual of the Northern and Southern Dipper Constellations for the Precious Lamp**
**Conducting the Dao in Quiet Night**

The ritual proceedings ascend the altar as prescribed.

Recite the **Calm Heaven-Earth Spell**, sprinkle water.

We, **the humble officials [insert names]**, with utmost sincerity, humbly petition the **Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Natural Spontaneity, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven, the Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth, the Ten Directions’ Already Enlightened Great Saints, the Many True Ones, the Noble Lords, the Thirty-Six Departments of Supreme Scripture Masters of the Mystic Law, the Rounded Celestial Symbols—Sun, Moon, and Stars—the Revered Dipper Emperor, the Seven Celestial Ministers of Auxiliary Virtue, the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole, the Lord Marshal, the Six Bureau Star Lords, our Native Celestial Stems, the Cavernous Heavens and Oceanic Mountains, the Three Realms’ Officials, and all True Spirits**—may they condescend to descend upon the Lamp Altar and verify our devout prayers.

We solemnly proclaim our intentions: **our earnest supplications have been fully revealed**. Now, with the **Star Lamp of the Current Hour**, we request all to chant the **Sacred Titles of the Heavenly Worthy** for the sake of **our household and kin**, to dispel calamities, avert misfortunes, prolong blessings, and extend life.

**Prostrating and taking refuge**, we devoutly extol:
**The Supreme Star Lord of the Great Luo Heaven, the Purple Micro Emperor.**

We, the humble officials, with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Central Star Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Acquisitive Wolf (Tānlang) and Bright Clarity**, the **Divine of the Dipper’s Core**, harmonizing with the Spirits.

We have heard that **the Morning Flight converges with the Radiance of the Hour**, while the Central Star governs the **power of the Great Cycle**; **the Bright Clarity oversees the Celestial Globe’s movement**. He **rules the transformations of the Nine Heavens above, oversees the numinous essences of the Five Peaks below, and encompasses all human affairs**. He **partitions the categories of life and death, judges good and evil without bias**.

Now, we, the humble [name], with reverent sincerity, **bow in obeisance to the Mysterious Pattern**, and with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Central Star Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Acquisitive Wolf and Bright Clarity**. May we **invoke the radiant return of luminous guidance**, that your **profound discernment illuminate this Mystic Altar**; may **blessings and longevity be extended**, and our **names inscribed upon the Azure Tablets**.

**Prostrating and taking refuge**, we devoutly extol:
**The Supreme Star Lord of the Purple Micro Enclosure, the First Star of the Dipper, the Acquisitive Wolf.**

**Acquisitive Wolf prolongs life**, the **Four Spirits of Primordial Truth scatter**. **His luminous glow descends**, penetrating the **Mysterious Darkness**. **Recorded in the Seven Celestial Registers**, his name is inscribed in the **Purple Court**. **He preserves the body and extends life**, ensuring **perpetual prosperity and purity**. **Ears and eyes sharpen**, the **soul and spirit remain at peace**—may our **sincere wish for eternal life be fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Celestial Globe Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Giant Door (Jùmén) and Yin Essence**, the **Divine of the Dipper’s Core**, harmonizing with the Spirits.

We have heard that **the Stars have Five Gates**, surpassing the **Three Luminaries in distant radiance**; **the Gates open to Four Illuminations**, gathering the **Ten Thousand Qi to ascend in splendor**. They **oversee promotions in the Celestial Bureau** and **govern the fortunes and lifespans of the people**. **No offering escapes your profound discernment**, and **all beings cross the Celestial Bridge by your luminous decree**.

Now, we, the humble [name], with **sincere devotion to the Jade Palace**, **dispatch our earnestness to the Golden Threshold**, and with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Celestial Globe Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Giant Door and Yin Essence**. May we **transcend a thousand calamities**, **extend our lifespan to a hundred blessings**, and **the Heavens open the Divine Realm**, while **Qi envelops the True Source**. **Our names shall be inscribed on the Azure Tablets**, **eternally recorded upon the Effulgent Stone**; **the Vermilion Platform’s Registers** shall **augment our celestial tally upon the Sacred Cypress**.

**Prostrating and taking refuge**, we devoutly extol:
**The Supreme Star Lord of the Purple Micro Enclosure, the Second Star of the Dipper, the Giant Door.**

**Giant Door prolongs life**, the **Primordial Spirits disperse**. **The Elixir Field flows freely**, the **Qi harmonizes with the Dao**. **Recorded in the Seven Celestial Registers**, his name is inscribed in the **Purple Text**. **He sustains the body and extends life**, **blessings and prosperity renew**. **He banishes demons and evils**, **auspicious omens daily manifest**. **Coming and going are unobstructed**, **we align with the Divine**. **Longevity is natural**, **ascending to the Jade Capital**—may our **sincere wish for eternal life be fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Celestial Globe Palace, the True Person of Longevity (Lùcún) and True Imperial Lord**, the **Divine of the Dipper’s Core**, harmonizing with the Spirits.

We have heard that **the Celestial Canopy rests**, yet none know its **empty stride’s name**; **it penetrates the Great Void**, its **flying body’s marvel is unfathomable**. **Above the Eight Scenes of the Nine Heavens**, it **contracts with the Blue Talismans to communicate with the True**; **above the Five Peaks and Four Rivers**, it **registers with the Yellow Platform to receive its duties**. **How much more so for the lowly scholar**, who **truly relies on your residual light**.

Now, we, the humble [name], with **purified self and solemn oath**, **establish the Dao as our revered altar**, and with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Celestial Globe Palace, the True Person of Longevity and True Imperial Lord**. May we **celebrate years of prosperity**, **blessings spanning vast eons**. **The Three Thousand Ten Thousand cycles of Heaven and Earth endure**; **the Twelve Divine Gates**—**Yang opens, Yin closes**. **Leisurely in broad daylight**, we **savor the harmonious flavors of the Void**.

**Prostrating and taking refuge**, we devoutly extol:
**The Supreme Star Lord of the Purple Micro Enclosure, the Third Star of the Dipper, the Longevity.**

**The Dipper measures calamities**, **High Immortals ascend**. **His luminous glow pervades**, **inner and outer realms purified**. **Recorded in the Seven Celestial Registers**, his name is inscribed in the **Purple Court**. **He supports the body and extends life**, **blessings and rank endure**. **Organs and viscera brighten**, **movement and stillness bring peace**. **His luminous movement harmonizes with the Radiance**—**we share in the Divine’s glory**. **Calamities are naturally averted**, **ascending to the Jade Capital**—may our **sincere wish for eternal life be fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with utmost sincerity, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Authority Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Dark Clarity (Wénqū) and Mysterious Darkness**, the **Divine of the Dipper’s Core**, harmonizing with the Spirits.

We have heard that **the Star of Mysterious Darkness**, in its **position as Marshal of the Vanguard**, **conceals its brilliance while leading the Three Palaces of the Dipper**; **it bestows blessings upon the virtuous and calamities upon the licentious**, **commanding the Five Qi of the Black Spirits**. **Sometimes it exterminates ferocious tyrants**, **flying the Fire Armor of the Six Heavens**; **sometimes it decapitates inauspicious forces**, **displaying the Crimson Weapons of the Four Frontiers**.

**All who dwell among the living and the growing** are born of their own accord.
With utmost sincerity, we now **purify the altar and the sacred grounds**, dispel dust and filth, and **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Authority Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Dark Clarity (Wénqū) and Mysterious Darkness (Xuánmíng)**.

We humbly pray that **our sins may be erased and our transgressions removed**, so that we may **escape the Nine Yin’s demonic records**; that **our souls may be bound and our spirits controlled**, granting us **the Seven Returns’ Daoist formula**. May our **actions and retreats be free from peril**, and our **breath and repose align with the Auspicious Harmony of the Great Peace**. May we **receive the blessings of the Highest Good**, forever **bearing the mark of extraordinary fortune**. With **prostrations and devotion**, we **sincerely praise and revere**.

We **swear allegiance to the Supreme Dark Clarity (Wénqū) Star of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi)**, the **Fourth Star of the Northern Dipper (Běidǒu)**.

**The Northern Dipper dispels calamities**, and **Mysterious Darkness and Bright Yellow** open the **Yang’s radiance**. The **Divine and Spirits appear and vanish**, their **clarity piercing all ten directions**. The **Seven Origins oversee the records**, their names inscribed in the **Purple Chamber**. They **guard our bodies and extend our lives**, perpetually **inviting blessings and fortune**. Their **true essence descends with grace**, washing away **ferocious misfortunes**. Their **refined qi coalesces**, and we **share their divine lineage**. **Calamities are dispelled naturally**, ascending to the **Jade Hall**, our **sincere wish for eternal life fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with **utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Great Saint of the Balance Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Chaste Purity (Liánzhēn) and Vermilion Darkness (Dānyuán)**.

We **swear allegiance to the Supreme Chaste Purity (Liánzhēn) Star of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi)**, the **Fifth Star of the Northern Dipper (Běidǒu)**.

**The Northern Dipper supports the weak**, and the **True Doctrine descends with spirit**. **Flowing dewdrops scatter and spread**, while **divine weapons intermingle in abundance**. The **Seven Origins’ records are established**, their names inscribed in the **Purple Camp**. They **fortify our bodies and nurture our lives**, their **auspicious blessings harmonizing with the cosmic cycles**. The **High and Mysterious guide us**, as we **leisurely wander the Five Celestial Clarities**. They **ride the luminous stars and soar**, their **spirits aligned with ours**. **The weak are supported naturally**, ascending to the **Jade Hall**, our **sincere wish for eternal life fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with **utmost sincerity, take refuge in the Great Saint of the Splendid Yang Palace, the True Imperial Lord of Martial Clarity (Wǔqū) and the Northern Pole (Běijí)**.

With **prostrations and devotion**, we **sincerely praise and revere**.

We **swear allegiance to the Supreme Martial Clarity (Wǔqū) Star of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi)**, the **Sixth Star of the Northern Dipper (Běidǒu)**.

**Martial Clarity scatters calamities**, and **Mysterious Darkness reflects in the heavens**. Their **mighty spirits stand guard**, and **evil and malevolence vanish without trace**. The **Seven Origins’ records are inscribed**, their names published in the **Purple Book**. They **govern our bodies and add to our lives**, forever **dwelling in joy**. The **Flying Immortals dance**, feasting in the **Mysterious Capital**. Their **vision penetrates all layers**, and we **share their divine abode**. Their **spirits align with ours**. **Calamities are scattered naturally**, ascending to the **Jade Void**, our **sincere wish for eternal life fulfilled**.

We, the humble officials, with **devoted hearts, take refuge in the Great Saint of the Radiant Light Palace, the True Imperial Lord of the Army-Breaking Heavenly Gate (Pòjūn Tiānguān)**.

We humbly pray that **our Dao may harmonize with the Vermilion Platform**, and we **ascend southward to gain the elixir of prolonged life**; that **our sins may vanish in the hidden courts**, and we **enter the northern capital to erase the name of death**. The **Four Seasons’ formations are complete**, and we **all exhale the radiant blessings**; the **entire household follows their steps**, and we **all embrace the pure and auspicious winds**. With **prostrations and devotion**, we **sincerely praise and revere**.

We **swear allegiance to the Supreme Army-Breaking (Pòjūn) Star of the Purple Enclosure (Zǐwēi)**, the **Seventh Star of the Northern Dipper (Běidǒu)**.

We, the humble officials, with **devoted hearts, take refuge in the Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s First Palace, the Heavenly Treasury of the Lord of Life (Sīmìng), the Supreme Marshal who Pacifies the Realm**.

We have heard that **the Heaven grants all spirits life**, and **each possesses its natural destiny**; that **humans harbor the Great Origin**, all **returning to the sovereign authority of the Yellow Emperor’s Pole**.

Those who **revere** the **Way** are the ones from whom **blessings** arise;
those who **defy** it are the ones from whom **calamities** spring.

The **Heavenly Sovereign** indeed **governs and regulates**—
its **power** is embodied in the **Lord of Life (Sīmìng)**.

If there are **prayers and expiations** to be made,
one must **cultivate sincerity and earnestness**.

Now, we **purify our hearts and clear our thoughts**, **nurturing our *qi* and preserving our spirits**,
with **long-held aspirations toward the Dao** and **reverence for the august celestial patterns**.

With **devoted hearts**, we **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s First Palace, the Heavenly Treasury of the Lord of Life (Sīmìng), the Supreme Marshal who Pacifies the Realm**.

We **humble pray** that the **Heaven may hear our sincerity**,
and **grant us all the Way of Eternal Life**;
that **humans may receive eternal decrees**,
and **be free from all untimely misfortunes**.

With **profound obeisance**, we **take refuge and chant in devotion**.

We **faithfully worship** the **Highest Sovereign of the Lofty Mansion (Tàiwēi)**, the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s First Palace, the Supreme Marshal who Pacifies the Realm**.

With **profound obeisance**, we **revere the Southern Pole (Nánchén)**,
the **first star** of its constellation,
named the **Lord of Life (Sīmìng)**, who truly **controls the roots of life**.

Now, we have **disciples** who **establish an altar and invoke the star**.
We **present our supplications to the Celestial Lord**,
and **cast our offerings to the Heavenly Compass**.

Oh, **Heavenly Sovereign and Supreme Marshal**,
**Commander of the Realm’s Forces**!
We **pray for a share of your radiant light**,
and **hope you may look favorably upon our sincere hearts**.

May you **extend our life with the essence of decrees**,
and **permanently safeguard our peace and security**,
so that our **sincere wish for eternal life** may be fulfilled.

We, the humble officials, with **devoted hearts**, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Second Palace, the Recording Official (Sìlù), the Supreme General who Pacifies the Mountains**.

We have heard that **the Lofty Mansion (Tàiwēi) at its origin**,
the **Dao has no fixed form**;
and **since our birth**, **all things have definite names**.

Calamities and blessings arise from **virtue/power**,
yet high and low alike are subject to their sway;
Fortune and misfortune depend on human conduct,
yet wisdom and folly make no distinction.

Now, this **Heavenly Sovereign** bestows upon us the **qi** of nature.
If we earnestly extend our **sincere supplications**,
we shall surely receive **manifest and glorious responses**.

With **our hearts now steadfast and our intentions pure**,
we turn to the **Dao** and seek **True Essence**,
revering the **Celestial Pattern’s luminous manifestation**,
and relying on the **Supreme Spirit’s** benevolent aid,
we **devotedly take refuge in the Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Second Palace, the Recording Official (Sìlù), the Supreme General who Pacifies the Mountains**.

We **humbly pray** that you may **unfold the vast **Dao** above**,
and **silently gather the **qi** of scrutiny and inspection**;
that you may **universally rescue all living beings**,
and **establish the order of **ritual expiation** and **meritorious deeds**.

With **prostrations and devotion**, we **take refuge and chant in reverence**.
We **affirm our faith** in the **Lofty Mansion’s** Supreme Sovereign, the **Southern Dipper’s Second Palace’s Pacifying Marshal**.

With **prostrations to the Southern Dipper’s Second Star**,
the **Recording Official**, who **truly records the births of mortals**,
we, your disciples, **light incense and proclaim the True Ones**.

Focusing our minds on the **Cinnabar Celestial Court**,
the **Hall of Eternal Life**,
we address the **Heavenly Marshal**, the **Pacifying Marshal commanding the forces**,
and **share in your radiant light**,
so that your **favor may illuminate our earnest devotion**.
We **inscribe our names in the Cinnabar Registers**,
and **eternally bestow upon us longevity and vitality**,
so that our **sincere wish for eternal life** may be fulfilled.

We, the humble officials, with **devoted hearts**, **take refuge in the Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Third Palace, the Heavenly Beam (Tiāngliáng), the Prolonging-Life and Preserving-Life True Lord**, the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper**, and the **Harmonious Spirits**.

We have heard that **eternal life and longevity** are the **constant essence of the Great Dao**,
and that **preserving life and extending years** are the **common desires of all mortals**.

「When in Heaven, life is fixed and immutable,
yet when in man, birth is precious for its unharmed passage.
If one seeks to prolong it, why not pray?
To knock upon the **Office of the Life-Preserver** (司存),
one must cultivate **sincere reverence** (瞻向之诚).
Thus, we, the humble **certain** (某), with **unshaken resolve** (专意志明),
look upward to the **Celestial Manifestations** (观象),
hoping that the **True Spirits** (真灵) may descend in grace,
so that our **longevity and merit** (寿考) may be elevated and magnified.
With **devoted hearts**, we take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Third Palace, the Heavenly Beam (Tiāngliáng), the Prolonging-Life and Preserving-Life True Lord** (延寿保命真君),
the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper** (斗中神仙),
and the **Harmonious Spirits** (和诸灵官).

We humbly pray that the **Grace of the True Lord** (真灵) may spread and bless us with **prolonged and abundant longevity** (绵长之算).
May **life-preserving virtue** (生德) be extended,
so that we may **forever be free from untimely demise** (永无夭横之虞).
With **devoted hearts**, we take refuge and **sincerely chant** (虔诚赞咏),
paying homage to the **Supreme High Lord of the Azure Enclosure (Tàiwéiyuán)** and the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Third Palace, the Prolonging-Life True Lord** (南斗第三延寿真君).

We bow to the **Southern Dipper** (南辰),
the **Third Star** (第三之星),
named **Prolonging-Life** (延寿),
which **regulates and governs lifespan** (主制年龄).
Now, we, the humble **弟子** (disciples),
**symbolically align with the Dipper’s Prolonging-Life True Lord** (象斗延真).
With **focused minds**, we gaze toward the **Southern Pole** (南极),
the **Celestial River’s crossing** (河汉之津).
It is the **Heavenly Beam of the Dipper** (斗天梁),
the **savior guiding all beings** (济度群伦).
We pray for **blessings and guidance** (赐降接),
to **escape calamities and misfortunes** (免灾述),
and to **continue with distant longevity** (遐寿),
so that our **fortunes may flourish like spring** (介福如春),
and our **sincere wish for eternal life** (和愿得长生) may be fulfilled.

We, the humble officials,
with **devoted hearts**, take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Fourth Palace, the Equalizing-Benefits and Preserving-Life True Lord** (同益算保生真君),
the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper** (斗中神仙),
and the **Harmonious Spirits** (和诸灵官).

We humbly hear that **life arises from numerical fate** (数肇而存),
and **many blessings are its beauty** (多斯为美);
yet when **fate is reduced and shortened** (命降而短),
**longevity becomes a sign of auspiciousness** (长乃为祥).」

「If the mind remains unbetrayed by falsehood,
then surely the years will grow more enduring.

The True Spirits are manifest and gracious,
and earnest sincerity is the proper way to seek them.

Now, I, the humble one, wish to extend my aged years,
reverently following the radiant and responsive signs of the Dao.

The Dao exists in the form of elusive wonder,
its echoes resonating in sound and shape—
with devoted heart, I take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Fourth Palace, the Equalizing-Benefits and Preserving-Life True Lord** (同益算保生真君),
the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper** (斗中神仙),
and the **Harmonious Spirits** (和诸灵官).

I humbly pray that **Great Compassion** may descend to aid me,
and that my life may flourish like spring’s endless growth;
that my **numerical fate** may greatly increase,
and that my longevity may endure like mountains’ steadfastness.

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly praise.
I sincerely vow to the **Supreme and Lofty True Lord of the Southern Dipper’s Fourth Palace, Equalizing-Benefits and Preserving-Life** (高上太微垣、南斗第四保生真君),
the **Fourth Star of the Southern Dipper** (南辰第四之星),
named **Equalizing-Benefits** (益算),
**Master of Vital Qi and Divine Life** (御炁生神).

Now, I, the humble disciple, make offerings to the **Divine Immortal** (仙真).
My resolve is fixed upon the **Southern Dipper’s Court** (南昌),
the **Lofty Hall of the Southern Dipper** (太微之庭).
Only the **Celestial Dipper’s Equalizing-Benefits** (斗天同) can guide my **life and fate** (寿命所经).

I pray that You may **extend Your favor and grant my wish** (垂矜允),
and that my name be **inscribed in the Celestial Register** (丹录书名).
May I be granted **advanced years** (介以耆年),
and **eternally preserved from decline** (永保无倾),
so that my **sincere wish for eternal life** (和愿得长生) may be fulfilled.

We, the humble officials,
with **devoted hearts**, take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Fifth Palace, the Overseeing-Destiny and Removing-Calamities True Lord of Literary Brilliance and Soul-Refinement** (枢度厄文昌炼魂真君),
the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper** (斗中神仙),
and the **Harmonious Spirits** (和诸灵官).

I humbly hear that **vital qi** (二炁) shifts subtly,
and that there are **principles of flourishing and decline** (亦有盛衰之理);
that the **Five Phases** (五行) cycle in succession,
and that **there is no absence of their transformative signs** (岂无消息之机).
Even those with **toilsome lives** (劳生) are not spared **calamitous fate** (厄运).
Since the **True Saints** govern **salvation and guidance** (救度),
the **black-haired masses** (黔黎) should earnestly **revere and purify their hearts** (谨於忱恂).

Now, I, the humble one, fearing **unforeseen misfortunes** (恐惧饬躬),
reverently observing the **auspicious signs** (钦崇观象),
swear to take refuge in the **Great Dao** (大道),
and pray to be **guided by the True Rest** (真休).
With devoted heart, I take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Fifth Palace, the Overseeing-Destiny and Removing-Calamities True Lord of Literary Brilliance and Soul-Refinement** (枢度厄文昌炼魂真君).

I humbly pray that my **destiny** be endowed with **a hundred blessings** (命资百福),
and that **hidden calamities** be **dissipated** (潜消不测之虞);
that my **body may escape the Three Catastrophes** (身度三灾),
and that I may **constantly enjoy the blessings of self-preservation** (常保自身之庆).

With bowed head, I take refuge and devoutly praise.
I sincerely vow to the **Supreme and Lofty True Lord of the Southern Dipper’s Fifth Palace, the Removing-Calamities True Lord** (高上太微垣、南斗第五度厄真君),
the **Fifth Star of the Southern Dipper** (南辰第五之星),
named **Removing-Calamities** (度厄),
**Dissipating Disasters and Calamities** (消荡灾述).

Now, I, the humble disciple, summon the **Divine Immortal** (招真致灵)
and **aspire to the Vermilion Mound** (翘想朱陵),
the **auspicious hour of Literary Brilliance** (文昌之辰).
Only the **Celestial Dipper’s Pivot** (斗天枢) opens the **gates of transformation** (开闱化钧).

I pray that the **flow of Dao and qi** (流道炁) may **control the spirit** (制魄),
and **bind the soul** (拘魂).
May You **grant me long years** (赐以长年),
and **renew my virtuous deeds** (善业增新),
so that my **sincere wish for eternal life** (和愿得长生) may be fulfilled.

We, the humble officials,
with **devoted hearts**, take refuge in the **Great Saint of the Southern Dipper’s Sixth Palace, the Vitality-Overseeing and Life-Sustaining True Lord of the Celestial Mechanism and Grand Register** (机上生监簿大理真君),
the **Divine Immortal within the Dipper** (斗中神仙),
and the **Harmonious Spirits** (和诸灵官).

I humbly hear that **immortals cultivate virtue** (仙人作德),
and **shame ignorance of even one thing** (耻一物之不知);
that the **Sage’s Dao** responds to the times,
and that its **essence is the marvelous function of the heart** (为中心之妙用).」

*«Humbly submitting my heart and establishing my fate,
I receive the *qi* and am endowed with form.
With reverence, I grasp the vital threads of life and creation,
Daring to bow in devotion and pray with sincerity.

Now, I, [Name], with a pure heart in this ritual fast,
Turn my mind toward the Dao, focus my intent on the heavens,
And contemplate the boundless nurturing grace of the Celestial Mechanism.
Though unworthy, I dare not neglect the rites of petition and expiation,
And with a devoted heart take refuge in the **Vitality-Overseeing and Life-Sustaining True Lord of the Celestial Mechanism and Grand Register** (机上生监簿大理真君).

I humbly pray to embody the **virtue/power of the Heavenly and Earthly** (乾坤之生德),
To wield the **Dao’s balancing authority** (运权衡),
To safeguard my **nature and fate** (性命) by entrusting them to harmony,
And to all return under the **Dao’s protective shade** (道荫).

With bowed head and refuge taken,
I devoutly extol and praise in faith.

I believe in and honor the **Supreme True Lord of the High Upper Enclosure** (高上太微垣),
And the **Vitality-Overseeing True Lord of the Southern Dipper’s Sixth Star** (南斗第六上生真君).

With bowed head, I take refuge in the **Southern Dipper’s Sixth Star** (南辰第六之星),
Named **Vitality-Overseeing** (上生),
Who **grasps the celestial principles** (掌握天经).

Now, I, a disciple of the Dao,
Aspiring to the Way and seeking immortality,
Turn toward the **High Celestial Palace** (高宫),
The **court of the Star Record** (星纪之庭).

Behold the **Celestial Dipper’s Vitality** (斗天机),
The **patterned threads of the Heavenly Text** (组织乾文).

I pray You may **bestow Your luminous presence** (垂光景),
And **shelter my body and form** (庇护身形).
May You **oversee and lead the Grand Register** (监领簿录),
**Record my blessings and extend my years** (注福延龄),
So that my **sincere wish for eternal life** (和愿) may be fulfilled.

[End of the *Sutra/Scripture*] (□经).

From past to present, I have worshipped the Dipper,
Offered prayers for the **meritorious deeds of the lamp** (祝灯功德),
And completed the **circumambulation of the seven stars** (并已周圆).

I humbly recognize that the Dao **gathers in the void and responds to all things** (集虚而应物),
That the **celestial transformations generate without end** (生化以无穷),
And that the heavens **display symbols to guide humanity** (垂象以示人),
Revealing **auspicious and inauspicious signs** (吉凶) that may be discerned.

The **True Sovereigns of the Two Offices** (二司之真宰),
Are the **fundamental principles of the ten thousand phenomena** (万象之元纲).
Without **previously attaining the true source** (夙习真源),
How could I now **unfold the treasures of the Dao** (披宝蕴)?

With my **ritual fast official**, [Name], now pure in heart and free of worldly concerns,
I command the **celestial messengers** (羽流),
And set up the **altar beneath the Star Axis** (辰极),
Establishing the **Celestial Dipper’s pattern** (法璇玑而建斗).

The **jade chimes resound with ethereal melodies** (琼钟逸韵),
Truly **communicating with the transcendent realm beyond symbols** (通象外之天);
The **jade seals congeal with misty clarity** (玉篆凝烟),
And I **envision the Saints within the Dipper** (想见斗中之圣).

I humbly hope that the **Six Celestial Offices may radiate in unison** (六司合照),
And that this may **be the cause of all auspicious deeds** (美成众善之因).
May the **Seven Celestial Governors distribute their light equally** (七政分辉),
And **bestow complete blessings upon my household** (均赐全家之福).

Thus, I pray for **countless generations of my ancestors** (亿曾万祖),
Both **distant and near**, both **living and departed** (远化近亡),
To **all depart from the realm of darkness** (尽离幽暗之乡),
And **enter the domain of radiant clarity** (俱入光明之界).
From the **highest celestial canopy** (上穷圆盖) to the **lowest earthly expanse** (下雨方舆),
May we **all bathe in the auspicious blessings of the Dao** (同沐胜缘),
And **ascend together to the Dao’s shore** (齐登道岸).

With bowed head, I take refuge in the **Boundless Dao** (无极大道).

Again, I invoke the **Celestial Sovereign of the Shifting Stars and Dipper’s Rotation** (星移斗转天尊),
The **Celestial Sovereign of Eternal Life and Preserved Fate** (长生保命天尊),
Whose **incomprehensible merits** (不可思议功德) are limitless.

**The *Comprehensive Daoist Ritual Precepts Collection* – Master Guangtong Du’s Revised *North Dipper Prolonging Life Pure Ritual Rites***

**On Establishing the Ritual Platform**

Should one who serves the **Supreme Celestial** (上真) fail to align with the **Heavenly Symbols and Earthly Patterns** (法天象地), constructing the platform according to the **Dipper’s Ladle** (随斗杓而建坛), they violate the **Dao’s Teachings** (违道训). It is better not to perform the rites at all than to proceed thus. The ritualist must first purify their **inner realm** (内境), clarifying their **spirit and vital essence** (召魂集神), so that the **Ten Thousand Things** respond to their command and transform in accordance with their will. Only then can their sincerity be manifest—otherwise, though offerings may be abundant, they will yield no benefit. Thus, **invoking the incense** (祝香) must come first.

Next, one must **recite the ritual precepts and teachings** (叙陈科教), for without this, the **Daoist and layfolk** will lack proper cause and effect, and their **faith will wane**, making it difficult for the **Celestial Worthies** to descend. Thus, **reciting the ritual’s purpose** follows.

Once the purpose is declared, if one cannot **describe the celestial patterns** (纪述天文) and **proclaim the Primordial Mystery** (对扬元妙), they will fail to honor the **Dipper’s Sovereignty** (北斗之尊). Thus, **narrating the Worthies’ virtues** comes next.

After recounting the Worthies’ virtues, if no **sincere words** are spoken, sincerity cannot stand. Thus, **proclaiming the invocation** follows.

Yet even then, if one’s **petitions for blessings and averting of calamities** are not made with **practiced Dao and vowed aspirations**, placing others before oneself, they cannot align with the **Celestial Intent**. Thus, **offering the three incense** follows.

Once the incense is offered, one’s **past karmic burdens and grave offenses** must be **repented**. The **Mysterious Virtues and Marvelous Benevolence** must be **striven for**. Without this, sins will not be extinguished, and blessings will not descend. Thus, **repentance** follows.

After repentance, one must **contemplate the Seven Celestial Worthies’ Virtues** (七元之德), holding them in mind as if they were present, so that their **auspicious aid may be secured**. Thus, **praising their virtues** follows.

Once the virtues are praised, one must **take refuge**, exhausting their **sincere aspirations**, so that the **Divine Presence may surely accept them**. Thus, **the Seven Refuges** follow.

After taking refuge, one may **offer the coarse wine** (浊醪) as a ritual expression of the heart. Thus, **the three libations** follow.

Once the libations are complete, the **ritual decorum is fulfilled**, the **gracious blessings obtained**, and the **words of thanksgiving** must be spoken to **send the Worthies back to the void**, while **gazing upward in reverence**. Nothing further can be added, so the **dismissal of the platform** concludes the rites—**a single phrase suffices**.

---
**The Invocation of Incense**

*"Dao Incense, Virtue Incense, the Incense of Effortless Naturalness*—now burning in the heated censer—**I summon the Three Treasures of the Great Luo, the Jade Seal Celestial Sovereigns, the Golden Gate Jade Emperor, the Central Heavenly Star Sovereign of Purple Micro, the Native Star Sovereign of the Southern Dipper and Northern Dipper, and all the Celestial Worthies of the Encompassing Heavenly River and Constellations.**

With this **true incense**, I **universally offer reverent homage**.

I, **your humble disciple of the [Surname] household**, now **proclaim the ritual precepts and practice the Dao**, petitioning for blessings and averting calamities. First, I shall **recite the ritual’s chapters and extol the virtues**, so that within this **ritual platform**, both **Daoists and layfolk** may witness and hear, and all generate **reverent devotion**.

I **humbly pray for celestial favor**, seeking even a slight alignment with the **Heavenly Will**. It is proper to **lay this out in detail**; I pray you **deign to inspect it with favor**.

I have heard that the **Most High established Virtue**, setting forth the **lofty winds of purity and stillness**; the next was to **establish Teachings**, expounding the **marvelous scriptures of compassion**.

They compiled the **Daoist canons**, hiding them in **sacred mountains**, sometimes revealing their traces to **deliver beings**, or bestowing **ritual precepts to save the world**.

They **detailed the cycles of the Lower Primordial** and **expounded the causes of one’s native star**, opening the way for all people to **take refuge in the Great Dao**, so that they might **cultivate the heart and nourish the qi**, confess sins to **prolong life**, and at the **times when Celestial Worthies descend**, always **grant sincere prayers**.

At the **Three Primordial Festivals and Eight Seasonal Nodes**, at one’s **native star’s birth hour**, they **solemnly established the ritual platform**, **reverently observing fasts and pure rites**, whether in **temple halls or domestic settings**.

They held **various incense and flowers**, offering them with **sincere devotion**; they arranged **fragrant wines and fruits**, their **virtues shining bright**. They **modeled the rites after Heaven and Earth**, **embodying the decorum of awe** in their offerings.

When observing fasts, they **extended from one day to seven**, according to their **capacity to perform merit**; when commissioning the Dao, they **gathered from one person to seven**, inviting them to **conduct the rites**.

Some **recited the numinous spells**, others **acknowledged the true forms**, directing their hearts to the **Dipper’s Sovereignty**, bowing beneath the **Purple Micro**, **humbling themselves before the Three Officials and Five Emperors**, **reaching sincerity to the Nine Palaces and Four Departments**, **offering blessings to prolong life**, **dissipating calamities and warding off misfortune**, **broadening boundless blessings**, and **receiving the greatest of celestial favor**. They **pondered the True Worthies’ unerring will**, **avoided false sects**, **purified the decay of calamities**, **shared in the dissolution of sins**, **attained virtuous fruits for the body**, and **secured blessings and longevity for life**, **ascending to the Ten Extremes**, **never sinking into the Three Abysses**. All this is the **power of invocation**, none other than the **support of the Worthies’ virtues**.

Yet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** born into lands afflicted by **epidemic scourges**, where **plagues spread**; or years struck by **famine and scarcity**, where **harvests fail and goods are not produced.**"

The corpses lie sprawling across the plains, the *qi* congealing beneath the vaulted heavens. Many face the specter of famine and hunger, while lands are ravaged by blade and war.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus summoning the **Thunderous Spirit’s** might to the earth. We deploy **celestial chariots** across the four quarters, cast nets a thousandfold, and unleash **flaming arrows** ten thousand *li* far. We gather the **five demonic weapons’** malevolent *qi* and ensure the **five grains** flourish in harmony. The year shall rejoice in abundance, and the people shall know no untimely death.

Yet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** afflicted by sudden calamities, where pestilence and miasma cannot be evaded, and they often encounter the **Six Cavern Demons**, suffering countless torments. Their homes are plagued by misfortune, and they know no rest. Disaster and decay lurk, seizing them at their most vulnerable. Their vital breath is bound, and chronic illness ensnares them for long. Some wander in hardship, others are choked by debt. Their fortunes show signs of decline, their lives lack smooth prosperity—calamities multiply beyond description.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, presenting our mortal pleas and chanting divine incantations—thus augmenting **divine insight** and **fate’s calculations**, trimming death’s register while extending life’s. Demonic scourges are dispersed, and all undertakings bring auspicious fortune.

Yet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** whose fields are ravaged by **locusts and borers**, whose lands teem with **plague insects**, destroying crops and leaving no harvest. Though they yearn for abundance, they reap nothing.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, solemnizing the fields with ritual purity and arraying the **threatening implements** in order. Following the **science**, we recite the incantations and dispatch petitions to the heavens—thus invoking the **Thunderous Spirit’s** stern command to slay the **disaster insects**, nurturing the **grains** to double their yield.

Yet there are those of the **Lower Primordial** who pray for descendants at their gates, whose women bear the joy of pregnancy. Some suffer within the **Six Hexagrams**, their fetal *qi* damaged; others perish within the **Ten Years**, their lives cut short. On the critical day of their pregnancy, they encounter the **Demoness’s** calamity, harboring malevolent *qi* that cannot be preserved, consuming the **essence of life** without securing it. They suffer from **withering yellow sickness** and are plagued by **strange dreams**—cats, mice, dogs, and monkeys transform into ominous forms, secretly devouring their offspring, leading to frequent deaths and deepening the sorrow of their parents, severing the lineage of their ancestors.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, expressing mortal sincerity and chanting divine incantations—thus moving the **Thunderous Spirit** of the upper realms to descend as the **Jade Maiden**, guarding the inner chambers and harmonizing the **five viscera**, ensuring the **auspiciousness of childbirth** and the **longevity of life**.

Yet there are women who labor in childbirth with agonizing pain, their suffering caused by the **Ghost Mother’s** devouring, weakening their **blood and viscera**, obstructing them for over a decade in endless terror.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, performing the **Way** with utmost sincerity and reciting the incantations—thus summoning the **Spirit Boy** to descend alongside the **Jade Maiden**, safeguarding the **grass mat** of childbirth in peace and ensuring swift, smooth deliveries for both mother and child.

Yet there are women who, as **tiger-wolf consorts**, consume the **essence of their children’s viscera**, desperately seeking sons yet bearing none in their lifetimes.

In reverence to the **Northern Emperor**, we erect the **Star Altar** below, purifying the hall with solemnity and offering **incense and flowers** in abundance, focusing our hearts on **single virtue** and reciting the incantations ten thousand times—thus sweeping away demons and banishing evil, ensuring **abundant progeny**.

All these **divine responses** are recorded in the **Precious Scrolls**. Thus it is known that the **Nuns’** atonements and the **Seven Primordials’** salvation encompass all.

This is the **Most High’s** expedient means, the **Most Holy’s** compassionate mercy, their **sincere devotion** for the people and **wholehearted benevolence** for all things. If one purifies the heart with fasting, presents humble pleas, prepares the rites with meticulous words, and invokes their wishes—what desire shall not be fulfilled, what petition shall not be granted?

Now, I, **[Name Redacted]**, pondering deeply and reflecting earnestly, bathe in **virtue** and purify my body, dedicating my intent to the **True Science** and aligning my heart with the **Mysterious Way**. I establish this **altar platform**, modeling it after the **vault of heaven**, adjusting the **celestial measurements**, lighting the **lamp of the Dipper**, reverently presenting the **law of faith**, and solemnly preparing **incense and flowers**, inviting the **Celestial Drivers** to descend and witness the **mortal’s** sincere prayers.

With deepest reverence, I now set forth this **preliminary exposition**, expounding the **True Function**, declaring it to all officials, that they may follow the **law’s instruction**, examine their intentions, and redouble their diligence. May this move the **Thunderous Spirit**, accomplish the **merit**, and then proceed according to the **rites**, continuing with the **petitions**.

We, the mortals, are overwhelmed with awe at the **Dao’s power**, the **divine light’s** descent, the **spirit’s** soaring brilliance, and the **urgent, protective** grace.

**Dao Gate Ritual Standards Complete Collection**
*Master Guangting Du’s Revised and Edited*
**North Dipper Prolonging Life and Warding Off Calamities Rite**
*Quiet Night Dao Practice*
*Standard Procedures for Ascending the Platform*

Each ritual master maintains reverent mindfulness in accordance with the law.
Proclaim the **Sacred Protective Incantations**.
The Five Stars shine in array, illuminating the five directions.
**Mercury** repels disasters, **Wood Virtue** brings prosperity.
Burning **Mars** dissipates calamities, **Jupiter** wards off war.
The **Lunar Star** steadies in place, benefiting family and state.
Names inscribed on jade tablets, characters recorded in the Imperial Archives.
Riding the gale, scattering brilliance, soaring through boundless space.
Entering and exiting the unseen, feasting in the ten directions.
Five clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and harnessing winds.
Commanding all numinous beings, protecting the celestial and human realms—
harmonizing with the **Dao’s True Essence**.

Strike the **Law Drum** twenty-four times.

The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin Qi**—
**Most High Dao Lord**, **Most High Laozi**—
summon forth from my body the **Three Five Officials of Merit**, left and right ministers, left and right incense-bearers, **Dragon-Courier Officials**, **Attendant Golden Boys**, **Messenger Flower-Sprinkling Jade Maidens**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, and the **Direct Day Incense Officials**—each thirty-six in number.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
with crowns and pendants trailing.
They open the **Mysterious Platform’s** lands and domain spirits,
and the territorial deities.

Now, in this **Quiet Night Dao Practice**, I humbly present my sincerest petition.
All my earnest devotions are recorded and conveyed.
May the **Most High’s Ten-Directional True Dao Qi** and **Sacred Treasure Light**
descend and flow into my body,
so that my supplications may swiftly reach the **Most High’s Supreme Boundless Dao**,
before the **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**.

Reaffirm the **Law’s Station**.

With utmost sincerity, I, **Subject of Rank [X]**, along with all officials of the platform,
humbly unite in offering this petition to:
**Primordial Heavenly Venerable of Natural Emptiness**,
**Most High Dao Lord**,
**Most High Laozi**,
**Celestial Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**,
**Nine Sovereigns of Supreme Truth**,
**Ten-Directional Perfected Saints**,
**All Honored True Ones**,
**Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of Mysterious Central Law**,
**Celestial Vault’s Mysterious Symbols—Sun, Moon, and Stars**,
**North Dipper Venerable Emperor**,
**Seven Celestial Ministers of the Seven Stars**,
**Southern Pole Great Emperor**,
**Lord Marshal**,
**Six Bureau Star Lords**,
**Native Star of Destiny**,
**Pervading Heavens and Seas, Three Realms’ Officials**,
**All True Spirits**.

I have heard that **Yin-Yang Qi** molds and refines,
the **Five Phases** transform and generate,
to nourish all ranks of beings,
to nurture all numinous life.
Life and death are bound to the **Seven Palaces**,
fortune and misfortune recorded in the **Nine Heavens**.
Good and evil, auspicious and inauspicious—
none escape scrutiny.
Guilt and merit, hidden or revealed—
all are meticulously recorded.
Above, the fate of the nation;
below, the order of humanity—
all are measured and governed by the **Polar Star**.

The **Mysterious Minister Emperor** rules the Six Heavens and governs the myriad realms;
the **Highest Celestial Jade Emperor** spreads boundless compassion and blesses the Three Realms.
Their **Spiritual Resonance** responds without fail.

We, the subjects, have long benefited from **Mysterious Grace**,
encountering the **Dao’s Auspicious Era**.
As **True Teachings** descend, both hidden and revealed beings receive blessings.
We thus prepare **Ritual Offerings of Gratitude**,
sincerely pledging our **Solemn Devotion**,
with utmost reverence, to express our heartfelt prayers.

Humbly hoping that the **Assembled Saints** will proclaim their mercy,
that blessings may flow from the Nine Heavens,
that they may pity our humble state,
bestow **True Winds** of grace,
relieve our mortal plight,
descend to this platform,
open their benevolence and spread their virtue,
and grant audience to our petitions.

For those who sincerely devote themselves,
how could their prayers be left unanswered?
Much less when we present these **Sacred Words**—
how dare we fail to submit them?

**Proclaim the Words.**

Examine the sincerity of our speech,
behold the clarity of our devotion.
Without relying on **Illustrious Might**,
how could we attain **Pure Valley**?

May we be accepted as **Sacrificial Offerings**,
so that we may follow **Heaven and Earth’s Benevolence**.
Spread **Auspicious Qi** through the layered heavens,
pour forth **Virtue’s Dews**;
fan **Spiritual Winds** across the unified cosmos,
broadly disseminate **Compassionate Waves**.

No divine wrath shall be invoked,
no ghostly blame shall arise.

I, **Disciple [Name]**, repeatedly reflect on my fortunate place beneath the **Dao’s Shelter**,
trusting in the **Divine Pivot**.
Day and night, I gaze upward in awe—
how could I comprehend the **sequence of stellar movements**?
As seasons pass in succession—
how could I know the **methods of Ritual Offerings**?

Thus, I prepare incense and lamps,
solemnly arranging pure offerings.
I bow beneath the **Polar Star’s** authority,
and with a silent heart, I dwell in the **Sacred Precincts**.

For **three hundred and sixty decades**,
may blessings descend with the **Dipper’s Ladle**.
For **seventy-two seasonal shifts**,
may responses align with the **Celestial Patterns** to store auspiciousness.

Disasters melt like ice,
guilt shatters like tiles.
My personal aspirations rise ever higher;
all under my care enjoy boundless prosperity,
sharing the blessings of the coming age.

**With the Dao of today’s practice,**
I follow the **Law of All Beings** at its dawn,
now offering incense with **three twists of flame**,
and bowing to the **Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures**,
the **Most Holy in the Northern Palace**.

Through this **virtue and power**,
I dedicate my **years of service** and **fated span**,
to escape the **Nine Calamities and Three Disasters**,
the **Ten Sufferings and Eight Hardships**.
Though **stars and constellations** pierce my being,
and **ill-fated encounters** strike like ice—
not by sickness or affliction do they bring misfortune,
nor by accumulated guilt do they seek retribution.
I hope that **like clouds and winds**, they all disperse,
and that **fragrant vapors** sweep them away,
that **a thousand blessings** renew,
and **a hundred calamities** dissolve.

Now, by this offering of incense,
I **take refuge in the Great Sage’s Dao Virtue**,
the **Most Holy of All Perfections**.
After attaining the **Dao**,
I ascend to the **Formless**,
and blend with the **True and Perfect Way**.

**With the Dao of tonight’s stillness,**
I follow the **Law of All Beings** at its second dawn,
now offering incense with **three twists of flame**,
and bowing to the **Supreme Venerable Scripture**,
the **True Sage within the Dipper**.

Through this **virtue and power**,
I dedicate my **years of service** to my **seven ancestral spirits**,
and all **shades of the departed**.
I humbly pray that **sacred blessings** flow far and wide,
and **auspicious winds** extend their reach.
May **long-standing stains** be cleansed and swept away,
and the **black registers of guilt** erased;
May **accumulated offenses** be dissolved,
and my **red talismans of life** restored.
Let **auspiciousness** endure and **protection** persist,
and blessings extend to all who live.

Now, by this offering of incense,
I **take refuge in the Great Sage’s Dao Virtue**,
the **Most Holy of All Perfections**.
After attaining the **Dao**,
I ascend to the **Formless**,
and blend with the **True and Perfect Way**.

**Repentance is complete.**

I, the **Law Official and All Beings**, with **sincere hearts**, now bow to the **Three Pure Ones, Great Sages**,
the **Ten Extremes of High Perfection**,
the **Great Emperor of the Northern Polarity**,
the **Seven Stars of the Dipper, True Star Lords**,
the **Assisting and Rectifying Star Lords**,
the **Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**,
the **Three Officials and Five Sovereigns**,
the **Nineteen Divisions of Immortal Deities**,
and all **Spirits of Officials**.

We humbly hear that **the Two Qi harmonize**,
and **the Five Phases** bear their fruits—
born into **humanity’s Dao**,
our lives belong to **Heaven’s administration**.
Though we differ by **barbarian or civilized lands**,
or by **common folk and noble ranks**,
all arise from **generative transformation**,
and all lie under **illuminating governance**.
We owe **abundant grace and favors**,
yet often neglect **burning incense in devotion**,
knowing neither the **threads of cosmic order**,
nor the **merits of heavenly shelter**.

We forget our **original nature and fate**,
unworthy of **human form**—
walking this path of guilt,
how can we be saved?

Next, we **transgress Heaven and defy Earth**,
harming life and violating the **Dao**,
neither **Dao-compliant** nor **benevolent**,
neither **loyal** nor **filial**.
We indulge the **Six Emotions** in chaos,
and align with the **Six Thieves** in delusion—
disrespecting **teachers and scriptures**,
envying the **virtuous and good**,
taking joy in disaster,
and greedily clinging to misfortune.
We act with **covetous cruelty**,
entangle **endless grudges**,
indulge in **fraud and deceit**,
and harm the **loyal and upright**.

Thus, in this life,
I suffer **worldly afflictions**—
sometimes facing **bandit raids and calamities**,
sometimes encountering **demons’ and spirits’ plagues**,
sometimes injured by **insects and beasts**,
sometimes struck by **official disasters**,
sometimes my **household suffers epidemics** and **deaths**,
or my **home is plagued by malevolent spirits** and **wealth is depleted**.

Even the **Six Heavenly Ghosts**,
and the **Five Sacred Mountains’ Deities**,
exploit my **guilt and misfortunes**,
and **foment disasters** to aid in my ruin.
The **Eight Hardships** follow close,
and the **Three Calamities** press together—
so that my **ancestors are punished**,
and my **names are obliterated**.
None can escape—
how great is this pain!

I **frequently invite unjust deaths**,
yet cannot **fulfill ancestral rites**.
The **Ghostly Officials** do not record,
and my **departed soul** has no resting place.
Awakening to this **cause and effect**,
I must now **seek repentance and atonement**.

May I **cleanse the defilements of a hundred lifetimes**,
and **dissolve the offenses of countless eons**.
I pray for **escape from calamities** and **warding of disasters**,
to **prolong life** and **invoke celestial mercy**,
to achieve **unending auspiciousness**,
and **fulfill blessings and wealth** in abundance.
May I **complete my Dao-practice to verify the True**,
and **avoid disasters while escaping misfortune**.

Moreover, the **Sages** have **paths of atonement**,
and the **Heavens** open **gates of repentance**—
so that I may **return with sincerity**,
and **seek divine forgiveness**.

Now, I, the **Law Official**, have **prepared offerings and declared faith**,
following the **ritual procedures**,
and **invoking the True Spirits**,
with **earnest devotion**,
and **one heart** bow to the **Three Pure Ones, Great Sages**,
the **Ten Extremes of High Perfection**,
the **Great Emperor of the Northern Polarity**,
the **Seven Stars of the Dipper, True Star Lords**,
the **Assisting and Rectifying Star Lords**,
the **Thirty-Six Venerable Scriptures**,
the **Three Officials and Five Sovereigns**,
the **Nineteen Divisions of Immortal Deities**,
and all **Spirits of Officials**.

I humbly pray that **True Benevolence** spreads widely,
and **Dao Power** resonates deeply—
that **Heaven’s Compassionate Insight** descends,
and **Earth’s Mercy** accepts my **humble pleas**.

I fear that, from **beginningless time** to today,
I, the **Law Official**, have been **nature-darkened and heart-veiled**,
chasing **fame and gain** in the **arena of desire**,
shackled by **worldly toil**,
wandering from the **True Dao**,
and straying into **false sects**.
My **love and anger** accumulate like **floating foam**,
and I **sink toward hell** as swiftly as **fleeting waves**.
My **clinging attachments** are hard to sever,
my **foolish ignorance** persists—
as **sensual cravings** overwhelm **loyalty and filial piety**,
and **self-interest** eclipses **benevolence and righteousness**.

In **life’s conflicts**,
**right and wrong** clash—
I **kill and feast** without restraint,
and **revel in cruelty** as my skill.
I **slander the good** and **obscure the virtuous**,
**defy Heaven and Earth**,
**pursue licentiousness** and **amass evil**,
**luxury and waste** as my way of life.
I **indulge in licentious schemes** while **disturbing yin-yang**,
and **recklessly perform rituals** that **violate prohibitions**.

Year after year,
I **pursue worldly matters** with **zeal**,
and **toil endlessly**—
yet **never repent**,
and **never seek atonement**.

「In the years of **Gengshen (庚申)** and **Jiazǐ (甲子)**, my sins and transgressions are merely recorded without absolution;
At my **natal hour and birth year (本命生辰)**, I fail to rectify the **fatalistic calculations (年算)**.

This has led to my **soul and spirit being bound (魂神被系)**,
and **calamities ringing like bells (祸患来鍾)**.
Perhaps I suffer **grave illnesses that never heal (重病不痊)**,
or **demonic malevolence seizes me (妖邪克害)**;
Year after year, **I am beset by hardship (困笃)**,
Decade upon decade, **I stumble in misfortune (迍邅)**.
**Legal disputes haunt my grave (冢讼征呼)**,**
and **the departed return to torment me (先亡复连)**.

Perhaps **Heaven above condemns me (上天谴责)**,
or **the ghosts below slander me (下鬼所诬)**;
Day by day, **I accumulate disasters (灾殃)**,
Evermore, **I face calamities (厄难)**.

Now, I **purify my heart and reflect on my faults (斋心念咎)**,
**cleanse my thoughts and seek mercy (涤虑求哀)**,
Praying that **all my sins may be forever erased (万罪以永消)**,
And that **all my grievances dissolve like mist (百冤而雾散)**.

May my **black records be expunged (黑书削籍)**,
And my **name inscribed in red (丹录记名)**;
That my **ancestors may be liberated from the Nine Abysses (九幽)**,
And my **kinfolk transcend the Three Realms (三界)**.

Free from **disaster and harm (灾害)**,
I may **rejoice in the far-reaching blessings of benevolence (溥博之休)**;
**Extend my fortune and life (延福延生)**,
And **aspire to the vast, encompassing grace (涵洪之泽)**.

My **gratitude is to the Most Venerable of the Northern Stars (北方至圣七元星君)**,
The **Lord of Creation and Command (主张造化号令乾坤)**.
Though **the Nine Ministries and Four Departments (九府四司)** all follow His decree,
Yet **the Three Officials and Five Emperors (三官五帝)** stand under His sovereign rule.

His **love for life resonates in human hearts (好生洽於人心)**,
And His **nourishing grace spreads across the world (膏泽霈于天下)**.
If I **lay bare my humble supplications (罄刍荛之恳)**,
He **must surely bestow the radiance of sun and moon (垂日月之光)**.

**Guilt shall be forgiven (有罪斯原)**,
**No disaster shall remain unresolved (无灾不解)**.
The **Five Phases and Six Calamities (五行六害)**,
The **Four Killers and Seven Injuries (四煞七伤)**,
**Countless worldly misfortunes (世厄)**—too many to recount—
Shall all be **dispelled by His boundless grace (大惠加而溥度)**.

I **establish the Supreme Dao of the Imperial Heaven (皇天太极)**,
And **strive to be the compassionate vessel for all beings (慈航)**.
Now, I **return to the Dao in repentance (皈依)**,
And **extend my sincere regrets (伸悔谢)**.

I humbly pray:
May the **Heavenly Heart (天心)** be moved by **compassion (恻隐)**,
And hear my **earnest pleas (恳布闻)**;
May my **sins be erased (罪愆削落)**,
And my **grievances lifted (冤对解除)**;
May **all disasters be forever extinguished (千灾永殄)**,
And **all calamities vanish (众厄自消)**;
May my **parents be blessed (庆及二亲)**,
And my **extended kin honored (荣分九族)**;
May my **ancestors’ names be recorded in the Purple Scriptures (先祖书名於紫策)**,
And my **descendants offered at the Vermilion Steps (子孙委质於丹墀)**;
May **fortune and blessings come as they should (福禄来宜)**,
And my **years endure unbroken (年龄永固)**.

Furthermore, I pray for **myself and the ritual officials (醮官)**,
That our **Daoist hearts may unfold (道心开发)**,
And our **wisdom and nature attain perfection (智慧性圆)**;
May we **wash away worldly toil (洗荡尘劳)**,
And **dispel delusion (祛除迷妄)**;
May we **gradually ascend to the wondrous fruit (渐登妙果)**,
And **reestablish the profound merit (重立玄功)**;
May our **names be inscribed among the celestial registers (仙籍之中)**,
And our **bodies harmonized with the Great Void (太虚之表)**;
May we **become virtuous men (良士)**,
And **all awaken from ignorance (迷情)**;
May our **merits benefit both the living and the dead (善及存亡)**,
And **our deeds permeate land and water (功沾水陆)**;
May we **forever transcend the mundane net (永超俗网)**,
And **ascend to the Golden Gate (升入金门)**;
May we **uphold the True One’s teaching (克扶真一之宗)**,
And **all align with the Mysterious Intent (契希夷之旨)**.

After attaining the **Dao (得道)**, we shall **enter the Formless (升入无形)**.
With **three invocations (三启)** and **three rites (三礼)**,
I, **a sincere subject (臣某)**, along with **all assembled officials (阖坛众官)**,
**Solemnly offer our prayers (重诚上启)** to:

The **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable (虚无自然元始天尊)**,
The **Supreme Daoist Lord (太上大道君)**,
The **Supreme Old Lord (太上老君)**,
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault (昊天玉皇上帝)**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of Supreme Truth (九皇上真)**,
The **Great Saints of the Ten Directions who have attained the Dao (十方已得道大圣)**,
The **Multitudes of Supreme Truths (众至真)**,
The **Exalted Lords and Masters (诸君丈人)**,
The **Thirty-Six Departmental Venerable Masters of Supreme Law (三十六部尊经玄中大法师)**,
The **Circular Celestial Symbols (圆穹玄象)**—
**Sun, Moon, Stars, and the Northern Dipper Celestial Emperor (北斗尊帝)**—
The **Seven Elemental Star Lords who aid and assist (七元辅弼星君)**,
The **Great Emperor of the Southern Pole (南极大帝)**,
The **Master of the Six Ministries (丈人司马)**,
The **Six Ministerial Star Lords (六司星君)**,
The **Natal Star of my Birth Year (本命元辰)**,
The **Celestial Peaks and Oceanic Mountains (洞天海岳)**,
The **Officials of the Three Realms (三界官属)**,
And **all True Spirits (一切真灵)**.

We **humbly recall that in this dusty world (生处尘寰)**,
We are **but floating filth (边惟浮秽)**,
Unenlightened to **true principles (未明真理)**,
And **mired in ignorant cultivation (多昧禀修)**.
Some **follow the fateful calculations of the heart (念运心)**,
**Defying the Great Dao (乖违大道)**,
In every **action and rest (行藏动息)**,
**Offending the True Spirits (犯冒真灵)**;
Others **carry sins from past lives into this one (前代今生愆瑕未涤)**,
Or **increase their faults through conduct (立身履行过咎旋增)**,
**Binding their sins to the Underworld Ledger (结罪目於酆都)**,
And **incurring demonic peril in the Earthly Records (着凶危於地简)**;
Or **face years of stagnation (年逢厄滞)**,
And **encounter declining fate (命值衰微)**,
When the **Eight Auspicious Stars are at their most dire (八禄当绝尽之期)**,
And the **Three Fates meet the calamitous number (三命遇休囚之数)**;
When the **Five Stars traverse their courses (五星行度)**,
And **some bear ill omens (有所照临)**;
When the **Eight Trigrams fly their flags of misfortune (八卦飞旗)**,
And **I am struck by penal calamities (罹刑厄)**;
Or **indulge in reckless rituals (兴修任性)**,
**Defying the gods (抵犯神祇)**;
Or **slaughter without restraint (烹宰恣情)**,
**Creating karmic debts (因成冤对)**.

As described above,
I have **never repented or atoned (曾未忏除)**,
Thus **my calamities multiply (厄滞多端)**,
And **my disasters are incalculable (灾凶莫测)**.
Morning and night, **I am plagued by anxiety (忧惧)**,
And **dare not rest in peace (不敢遑宁)**.

I have heard that the **Jade Emperor opens the path of compassion (玉皇开慈悯之科)**,
And the **Great Emperor establishes the ritual of atonement (大帝垂醮陈之典)**;
Thus, I **rely on sacred teachings (凭宝训)**,
And **prepare the ritual platform (备醮坛)**,
**Daring to invoke the sacred presence (冒渎威灵)**,
And **summon the True Saints (延降真圣)**.

I **humbly beg that the primordial grace may descend to the mortal realm (胎恩下俗)**,
And that **the sacred favor may reach the common folk (介福凡愚)**,
Granting **permission to reform (许以自新)**,
And **accepting my repentance and purification (容其忏洗)**.

I **aspire that the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault (玉皇上帝)**,
The **Seven Venerable Star Lords (七元尊神)**,
May **specially absolve me of past calamities and accumulated sins (解除宿殃积罪)**,
Of **old and new disasters (旧厄新灾)**;
Within the **Three Fates and Nine Palaces (三命九宫)**,
And the **Five Phases of stellar alignment (五行列宿)**,
May **disasters and calamities cease (灾凶殄息)**,
And **the path to fortune open (厄难开通)**.

I **humbly beg for the removal of calamities from years, months, days, and hours (岁月日时灾厄)**,
And those **calculated by fate (算尽之厄)**;
Of **calamities from the Eight Trigrams and Nine Palaces (八卦九宫)**,
And the **Five Ghosts’ fatal strikes (五鬼绝命)**;
Of **calamities from the Six Jiǎn and Three Fates (六壬三命)**,
From **Earthly Nets and Heavenly Snares (地网天罗)**,
And the **Five Phases’ decaying and clashing penalties (金木水火土五行衰绝刑克)**;
Of **calamities to my kin and the Six Relationships (眷属六亲)**,
And those **that obstruct and harm (妨害之厄)**;
Of **public and private slander (公私口舌)**,
And **unjust disasters or horizontal calamities (非灾横祸)**,
And **imprisonment (囚系)**;
Of **calamities from malevolent thieves and bandits (恶人盗贼)**,
And **violent assaults or plots to harm (侵暴谋害)**;
Of **calamities from construction and labor (起造兴工)**,
And **infringements or offenses (侵伤触犯)**;
Of **calamities from the four directions and five routes (四方五路)**,
And **blockages that impede progress (滞塞不通)**;
Of **calamities from travel by land and sea (水陆游行)**,
And **misfortunes with boats, carriages, oxen, and horses (舟车牛马)**;
Of **calamities from debtors and enemies (冤家债主)**,
And **litigious disputes or fate’s scrutiny (诉讼考注)**;
Of **calamities from the departed returning to haunt the living (先亡家墓复连)**;
Of **calamities from neighbors in the four directions (四方邻里)**,
And **ill omens from broken arrows, direct talismans, or fate’s marking (破射直符注煞)**;
Of **calamities from unsettled residence (居止不安)**,
From **lost wealth and spirits’ depletion (财帛遗亡、神鬼益耗)**.

If **a child is born in the year of Geng (庚) or Shen (申)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Northern Dipper’s Star of Greed (贪狼星君)** to absolve them;
If **a child is born in the year of Chǒu (丑) or Hài (亥)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of the Great Gate (巨门星君)** to absolve them;
If **a child is born in the year of Yín (寅) or Xū (戌)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of Auspicious Retention (禄存星君)** to absolve them;
If **a child is born in the year of Mǎo (卯) or Yǒu (酉)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of Literary Grace (文曲星君)** to absolve them;
If **a child is born in the year of Chén (辰) or Shēn (申)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of Chastity and Integrity (廉贞星君)** to absolve them;
If **a child is born in the year of Wèi (巳) or Wèi (未)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of Martial Grace (武曲星君)** to absolve them;

If **a child is born in the year of Wǔ (午)**,
And **suffers disasters at any hour (年月日时灾厄)**,
I **invoke the Star Lord of the Shattered Army (Pòjūn Star Lord, 破军星君)** to absolve them.

May I **pray that no calamity intrudes unnaturally**,
That disasters and decline be cleansed away,
That the soul and spirit be steadied,
That dreams and waking align with truth,
That **Dao-qi nourishes within**,
That **original harmony pervades fully**,
That past misfortunes be washed clean,
That grievances and debts be dissolved,
That pestilence and epidemics do not approach,
That blessings and longevity increase,
That the living and the departed be graced,
That kin and dependents share in honor.

Thus, **I humbly receive the grace of the myriad sages’ protection**,
The benevolence of the **Most True’s compassionate regard**,
The **Heavenly Venerable’s great mercy from above**,
And **fulfill my sincerity in repentance below**,
Devoutly presenting this petition.

**Twelve Vows.**
**Reignite the furnace.**

With solemn reverence, I **dispatch the incense-official messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of incense**,
To command that **my former place of nocturnal Dao-practice**
Shall naturally birth **golden elixir and jade-green essence, numinous herbs and spirits**,
Where **multitudes of True Ones gather**—
All before this incense furnace.

May I **pray that the celestial boys and jade maidens of the Ten Directions**
Attend to the fragrant mists,
And swiftly convey my sincere petition
Directly to the **Most True, Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extreme, before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**.

**Exit the hall with chant.**
**Exit the gate.**

「The Complete Daoist Ritual Precepts—Volume Fifty-Six concluded. Volume Fifty-Seven: *Broadly Virtuous Master* Du Guangting’s Revision.

**The Extended Life Ritual of the Northern Dipper.**
**Setting the醮[jiào] and practicing the Dao.**
**Ascending the platform—observing the prescribed rites as laid out.**

Each reverently honors the Master’s intent in accordance with the Dao.

**Declaring the sacred incantations for protection,**
The Five Stars arrayed in radiance, illuminating the five quarters.
The Water Star repels calamities, the Wood Star brings prosperity.
The Upholder Star[荧惑] dispels misfortune, the Great White Star[太白] wards off soldiers.
The Firm Star[镇星] secures fourfold blessings, benefiting both family and state.

**My name inscribed on the jade tablets, my words recorded in the Celestial Registry,**
I ride the gusting winds, scattering my essence through boundless space.
I traverse the unseen void, feasting among the Ten Directions.
The Five Clouds float as my canopy, summoning spirits and harnessing winds.

**I command the myriad sacred beings,**
To guard above and shield the Daoist Sage,
In harmony with the **Supreme True Dao**.

**I strike the sacred drum twenty-four times.**

**The Most High Three Heavens’ Primordial Sovereign of the Three Qi[三炁],**
The **Supreme Daoist Lord,**
The **Supreme Old Lord,**
**Summon forth** from my body the **Three Five Officials of Vitality[三五功曹],**
The Left and Right Official Messengers,
The Left and Right Attendants of Incense,
The **Postal Dragon and Mounted Clerk[驿龙骑吏],**
The **Golden Boys Attending Incense,**
The **Jade Maidens of Spoken Petitions and Scattered Flowers,**
The **Five Sovereigns’ Direct Talismans,**
The **Direct Day Incense Officials,**
And the **Thirty-Six Persons**—all to emerge.

**Those who exit** shall be attired in solemn and resplendent robes,
Their headgear adorned with trailing streamers,
**Opening the way** for the **Land and Domain Spirits of the Mysterious Platform,**
And the **Territorial Sacred Beings of the True Dao.**

**I now practice the Dao in quiet night,**
And humbly present this as my deepest intention.
My sincerest devotions are already recorded and conveyed.
May the **Supreme True Dao of the Ten Directions** descend,
Its **Sacred Treasure of Auspicious Light** flowing into my body,
So that my petitions may swiftly reach
The **Supreme Boundless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign,**
Before whom the **Nine Sovereigns of the Highest Truth** preside.

**I request the invocation of the sacred ranks.**

**The humble petitioners—[臣某等]—**
With utmost sincerity, present this plea to:
The **Primordial Sovereign of the Void and Naturalness,**
The **Supreme Daoist Lord,**
The **Supreme Old Lord,**
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign,**
The **Nine Sovereigns of the Highest Truth,**
The **Ten Directions’ Great Saints Who Have Attained the Dao,**

The **Master Marshal [丈人司马],**
The **Six Official Stars,**
My **Native Star and Hour of Fate,**
The **Celestial Caverns and Oceanic Peaks,**
The **Officials of the Three Realms,**
And **All True Spirits.**

**We humbly hear that:**
The human body is rare to attain,
The Central Lands are rare to be born in,
And even if one is born there,
The **True Law** is rare to encounter.
The **Daoist Scriptures** teach that
This is only possible through the **Dao’s power**—
A power that cannot be reconciled without **firm faith**,
And one’s **fate is determined by past habits.**

**Moreover, I am of the utmost Primordial Essence,**
Ever the **root of the True Saints.**
The **Mysterious Virtue** is vast and resplendent,
The **Illustrious Might** is awe-inspiring and grand.
Those who **aspire to it** escape birth and death,
Those who **revere it** preserve life and extend years.
Its depths are unfathomable, its blessings eternal—
**Life and death depend upon it.**

**The醮[jiào] officials, with one heart, surrender in devotion,**
All distractions cast aside,
Grateful to Heaven and Earth for their creation,
Awed by the transformations of **Yin and Yang,**
Diligently unflagging;
**With solemn reverence, our sincerity grows ever greater,**
Following the prescribed rites and offering the sacred chapters,
Conforming to the sacred rituals and repenting our transgressions,
**Committing to the profound weight of our Daoist faith,**
And **refining the solemnity of our rites,**
We pour out our prayers in earnest,
**Humbly trusting in their fulfillment.**

**We humbly pray for:**
The **virtue/power of the Sun and Moon’s illumination,**
The **function of Heaven and Earth’s complete embrace,**
The **favor akin to rain and dew’s private grace,**
The **blessings vast as mountains and rivers.**

**May the醮[jiào] officials—[臣某等]—**
Instantly dissolve all dangers and hardships,
**Swiftly secure enduring peace and well-being,**
And **long-lasting talismans** fulfill their words,
**Forever uniting with the incantations that pierce the unseen.**

**The Three Platforms and Five Talismans[三台五纬]**
Shall universally extend their **mercy of salvation and protection;**
**The Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand True Ones**
Shall all **respond in earnest to our reverence and support.**

**Our words have yet to conclude,**
But our sincerity grows ever deeper.
**We shall fully surrender in reverence,**
And **exhaust our humble efforts in honoring the rites.**
**Thus may our prayers reach the common folk,**
And **ascend to please the Celestial Heart.**
**We hope for eternal communion,**
To **forever rely upon blessings and longevity.**

**The臣[臣] and the醮[jiào] officials, together with the assembled multitude,**
Unable to bear the **urgent fervor of our devotion,**
**With profound humility and fear,**
We **kowtow and bow twice** to welcome the **Sacred Presence.**

**The True One descends,**
We **offer tea in reverence,**
**First presentation,**
And **scatter flowers.**

**The humble petitioners—[臣某等]—**
With **renewed sincerity**, present this plea to:
The **Primordial Sovereign of the Void and Naturalness,**
The **Supreme Daoist Lord,**
The **Supreme Old Lord,**
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign,**
The **Nine Sovereigns of the Highest Truth,**
The **Ten Directions’ Great Saints Who Have Attained the Dao,**

The **Master Marshal [丈人司马],**
The **Six Official Stars,**
My **Native Star and Hour of Fate,**
The **Celestial Caverns and Oceanic Peaks,**
The **Officials of the Three Realms,**
And **All True Spirits.**

**We humbly hear of:**
The **vast virtue/power and solemn deeds**—
Our **deepest reverence** has already been offered;
**The awe-inspiring威仪[wei yí] and majestic rites**—
We shall **fulfill our devotions with fragrant incense.**

**With the finest wine as our offering,**
We pray it may **align with the Celestial Will;**
**With our rites performed in earnest,**
We dare **hope they will be reflected in the Imperial Throne.**

**We humbly pray that the Northern Dipper’s Seven Auxiliary Stars**
May **possess boundless威容[wei róng],**
Their **virtue/power** ever-expanding,
**Nurturing all things without partiality,**
**Guiding all sentient beings without ceasing,**
**Forever illuminating the high and bright,**
**Endlessly extending the mercy of creation.**

**May the醮[jiào] officials—[臣某等]—**
**Fulfill this mortal aspiration without fail,**
**Receive the radiant blessings and be resplendent,**
**Gradually bask in the refreshing, cooling grace.**

**The humble servant**—**with all present officials**—**with utmost sincerity addresses:**
**The Primordial Void-Natural Beginning-of-Heaven Sovereign**, **the Supreme Dao Lord**, **the Supreme Venerable Lord**, **the Jade Emperor of the Augmented Heaven**, **the Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth**, **the Ten Directions’ Already Enlightened Great Sages**, **All Perfect Truths**, **All Noble Lords**, **the Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of Esoteric Middle Teachings**, **the Rounded Vault of Mysterious Symbols—Sun, Moon, and Stars—the Venerable Dipper Emperor**, **the Seven Stars of Auxiliary Assistance**, **the Great Emperor of the Southern Pole**, **Lord Marshal**, **the Six Bureau Star Lords**, **the Native Celestial Stem**, **the Cavern Heavens and Ocean Peaks**, **the Three Realms’ Officials**, **All True Spirits.**

We hear: **In the ancient Dao’s completeness**, **all preserved their purity.**
When the **lower primal numbers exhausted**, **the world became corrupt.**
The **Great Sage extends mercy**; **the heavens open to repentance.**

**Translation:**

By the sacred rites, we invoke the descent of the Holy—
To purify the vulgar heart through cleansing.
By the teachings’ prescribed words, we earnestly plead at the Celestial Throne—
To receive the Emperor’s compassion.

We present offerings complete,
Like humble reeds and rushes in shared humility;
We proffer wine and libations,
Like turbid waters flowing in sinful streams.

Yet our sincerity is clear,
Our loyalty unyielding—
To fulfill the rites of repentance,
And restore the pure nature of our original essence.

Thus may we avoid transgression’s doom,
And escape the guilt of error.

With rites and sincerity exalted,
Words follow the heart’s deepest intent.
We display the solemnity of this day,
And convey our meaning in this hour.

May the crimson banners and rainbow standards
Not linger long upon the mortal earth,
While the cloud-chariot and crane-canopy
Shall return to the lofty vault above.

May the blessings of Your grace
Flow eternally, nurturing virtue’s growth,
And magnify the boundless恩 of nurturing care,
To soothe the common heart and manifest the Dao’s glory.

Thus may the officiant of this ritual,
**South Palace** receive blessings and **North Bureau** avert calamities,
With households welcoming a thousand auspices,
And gates inviting a hundred fortunes.
May descendants flourish,
And sickness and pestilence retreat.
May hidden disasters of water and fire dissolve,
And clarity protect both public and private fortune.

May ancestors be liberated,
And grievances ascend to transcendence—
All wishes fulfilled, no plea unanswered.
We rely on the boundless blessings of the Supreme,
To attain the greatest felicity.

Yet, reflecting on our many offenses,
Defilement lingers, dust remains uncleansed,
Externally lacking the adornments of ritual,
Internally forgetting the unity of the refined essence—
We cannot yet invite the descent of blessings,
Lest we first incur guilt and punishment.

Oh, the **Seven Stars of the Big Dipper** and the **Assisting Celestial Lords**,
The gathered **True Saints** of the Assembly—
Have mercy on our ignorance and folly,
And grant universal pardon.

Thus, this is fitting and proper,
To eternally honor our devout and reverent supplication;
Like the **Big Dipper’s stars** or wings of a crane,
We humbly receive Your far-reaching grace.

With bowed obeisance, we send forth the cloud-chariot,
Our longing too deep to bear.

**The officiant and ritual master**, with deepest reverence,
Prostrate in awe before the Sacred Procession,
And with utmost devotion, submit this prayer.

**Twelve Wishes** fulfilled.
**The incense burner is extinguished.**

With solemnity, we command the **Fragrant Officials and Envoys**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
And the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**—
To manifest, at the place of our former nocturnal Daoist practice,
The spontaneous emergence of **golden elixir and jade-green essences**,
**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits**,
As the **Celestial Worthies** gather before this incense burner.

May the **Ten Directions’ Immortal Youth and Jade Maidens**
Attend the fragrant mists,
And swiftly convey our sincere supplications
Directly to the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless and True**,
Before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor’s Celestial Throne**.

**The hymn of departure is chanted.**
**Exiting the hall, the Holy Procession is sent forth.**

**The Complete Daoist Canon of Rituals and Regulations, Volume Fifty-Seven, concluded. Volume Fifty-Eight, edited by Master Guangting Du: The Ritual of the Northern Dipper’s Prolonging Life and Expiatory Lamp.**

**The ritual proceeds as usual.**
Recite the **Heavenly Earthly Natural Spell**, sprinkle to purify.

Burn incense and offer reverence to:

The **Lamp Altar** seals the sacred oath,
And our prayers are granted.

**Humbly heard**, the **Primordial Sage** opened his teachings,
And bestowed them universally upon all living beings;
The **Supreme Primordial Lord** extended his mercy,
And all creatures received the blessings of his virtues.

Thus, the **Golden Tablets and Jade Registers** were revealed,
Displaying the **Fast Rituals and Regulations**.
The **Golden Tablets and Glistening Records** were proclaimed,
To spread the **Great Expiation Method**.

**This path of prayer and atonement** is now opened,
And the **Ritual of Expiation and Repentance** is broadly extended.

All who receive life and form,
Should indeed **faithfully adhere** and **revere**.

Now, the **disciples of the fast** [certain],
By fortune, receive the **True Shade’s protection**,
And dwell long in the **auspicious cycle of time**.

Yet, though they possess wealth and extravagance,
They fail to grasp the **principles of ascetic discipline**.

**Reflecting**, their years may be in peril,
And calamities may cling to them.

Following the **True Ritual of the Yellow Registers**,
And the **Heavenly Hosts of the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars**,
With **sincere devotion**, they establish the **Expiation Seat**,
And raise the **Star Altar**.

**The Celestial Worthies** gather in the **Perfect Circle of the Sky**,
And the **Northern Dipper’s Ladle** ascends in due order.
**Luminous Radiance** illuminates,
And the **Divine Incantations** softly spread,
To **attain blessings and rescue the departed**.

**Humbly praying**, the **Heavenly Worthies** may witness our offerings,
And the **Divine Vehicles** descend from afar.
Beholding our **sincere prayers and devotions**,
They grant **auspicious blessings and signs**—
That calamities be dispelled this very day,
And blessings descend upon this very hour.
Thus, all beings may **fruitfully bask in the divine light**,
And rejoice in **universal harmony**.

**With bowed heads**, we **faithfully adhere** and **revere**,
And with **sincere devotion**, we **chant praises**.

We serve the True Spirit of the **Fighting Star** at the Dipper’s Pole.
With reverence, we prepare incense and lamps,
And solemnly arrange the altar platforms.
The fragrant **orchid wax** burns bright,
As lotuses bloom in the midnight hour;
The precious flames shine in unison,
Illuminating the constellations below.

Bathing in the divine light’s dual radiance,
Our sins are dispelled;
Under the **Confession Law’s** proclamation,
Our ignorance and delusion are cleared.

Now, we pray for grace and atone for our transgressions,
As the rites conclude and the work is perfected.

They have already been laid out and proclaimed (已对敷宣).
We trust in Your **heavenly benevolence** (天恩) and **clear recognition** (洞鉴) of our sacred rites (祀事).

We, the disciples, have heard that at the **commencement of setting up the ritual hall** (建斋之始),
One must first **receive the precepts of cultivating Perfection** (修真之戒),
To **examine and purify the body and mind** (检察身心),
And **appease and transform Heaven and Earth** (感格天地).

Today, this **Daoist ritual hall** (道场) is established by disciple **某** (某),
As the day when the **native star of our life** (本命上属北斗某星君) descends.
The **Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper** (北斗七星),
Located north of **Taiwei** (太微, the Pleiades),
Symbolize the **sovereign of humanity** (人君之象),
And serve as the **master of commands and orders** (号令之主).
They **measure the primordial *qi*** (斟酌元气),
**Oversee the four directions** (临制四方),
**Establish the four seasons** (以建四时),
**Balance the five phases** (以均五行),
And **govern the central flow of Heaven and Earth** (运天地之中),
While **human life is derived from them** (人禀之以为命).

The first is **Star of Yangming and Greedy Wolf, the Great Star** (阳明贪狼太星君), governing those born in the **year of the Rat** (子).
The second is **Star of Yin Essence and Great Gate, the Primordial Star** (阴精巨门元星君), governing those born in the **years of the Ox and the Pig** (丑、亥).
The third is **Star of the True Person and Wealthy Storage** (真人禄存真星君), governing those born in the **years of the Tiger and the Dog** (寅、戌).
The fourth is **Star of Mysterious Darkness and Literary Bend, the Knot Star** (玄冥文曲、纽星君), governing those born in the **years of the Rabbit and the Monkey** (卯、酉).
The fifth is **Star of Vermilion Primordial, Chaste and Just** (丹元廉贞刚星君), governing those born in the **years of the Dragon and the Rooster** (辰、申).
The sixth is **Star of the Northern Pole and Martial Bend, the Record Star** (北极武曲纪星君), governing those born in the **years of the Snake and the Goat** (巳、未).
The seventh is **Star of the Celestial Gate and Breaking Army** (天关破军关星君), governing those born in the **year of the Horse** (午).

The first governs **Heaven** (天),
The second governs **Earth** (地),
The third governs **Fire** (火),
The fourth governs **Water** (水),
The fifth governs **Earth** (土),
The sixth governs **Wood** (木),
The seventh governs **Metal** (金).

The first governs **Qin** (秦),
The second governs **Chu** (楚),
The third governs **Liang** (梁),
The fourth governs **Hao** (昊, the sky),
The fifth governs **Yan** (燕),
The sixth governs **Zhao** (赵),
The seventh governs **Qi** (齐).

The first governs **Yang Virtue** (阳德),
The second governs **Yin Punishment** (阴刑),
The third governs **Midst Calamity** (中祸),
The fourth governs **Military Campaigns** (征伐),
The fifth governs **Slaughter and Execution** (杀戮),
The sixth governs **The Five Grains** (五谷),
The seventh governs **Weapons of War** (兵戈).

Stars one to four are the **Pivot Stars** (魁魁, the first four stars of the Big Dipper),
And the **Raven’s Eye Stars** (璇玑, the third and fourth stars of the Big Dipper).
Stars five to seven are the **Ladle Stars** (杓杓, the last three stars of the Big Dipper),
And the **Jade Balance Star** (玉衡, the central star of the Big Dipper).

All aspects of **human life**—**fortune, longevity, and fate** (福禄寿命),
As well as **affiliated beings, slaves, and servants** (眷属奴婢),
Are governed by the stars of the Dipper (斗中主之).

According to the **Most High Laozi’s** (太上老君) words:
**The five components of human nature and life** (凡人性命五体),
Are all under the dominion of the **native star officials** (本命星官之所主掌).
The **native star generals and officials** (本命神将、本宿星官),
Constantly **bestow their auspicious shade** (垂荫佑),
**Oversee human life** (主持人命),
And **ensure the preservation of one’s Heaven-bestowed years** (使保天年).

The **True Saints of the Native Star** (本命真圣),
Each year descend **six times** (每岁六度) to the mortal realm.
The day of descent is the **critical period of one’s native star** (本命限期),
When one may **plant various incense and flowers, fresh seasonal fruits** (种种香花、时新五果),
**Model oneself after Heaven and Earth** (法天像地),
And **invite Daoist priests of the Orthodox Unity School** (请正一道士);
Either at **temples and observatories** (宫观),
Or within **domestic settings** (家庭),
To **establish ritual halls and perform expiatory rites** (修斋设醮),
And **invite and pray to the Northern Dipper’s Three Officials and Five Emperors** (启祝北斗三官五帝、九府四司),
Presenting **two petitions: one for bestowing blessings, the other for dispelling calamities** (荐福消灾二奏章恳愿),
And **fulfilling merits according to one’s capacity** (随力建功),
To **conduct the ritual affairs** (请行法事).
The **merits and virtues** (功德) are profound and weighty;
Their full extent cannot be enumerated (不可具陈).

For those whose **native star’s critical period** (本命限期) is approaching,
Yet who **do not know** (自身不知),
And **do not set up ritual halls or perform incense rites** (不设醮筵，不修香火),
Unable to **inform and pray to the Northern Dipper** (不能投告北斗),
Or **thank the True Sovereigns** (醮谢真君),
Nor to **recite and transmit the True Scripture** (转真经),
And **acknowledge the name of their native star’s True Sovereign** (认本命真君名号),
This is **reckless disregard for life and ignorance of one’s roots** (轻生迷本),
**Disdaining the human body** (不媿人身),
**Causing Heaven’s officials to strip one’s fortune** (天司夺禄),
**Reduce one’s lifespan and subtract one’s years** (减算除年),
And **result in many untimely deaths** (致多夭丧).

After **expressing gratitude to the native star** (身谢之后),
One falls into the **three abysses** (三涂, the three lower realms),
And **drifts through the six paths** (漂诸六趣, the six realms of rebirth),
A state deeply **worthy of lamentation and sorrow** (深可悲哀),
**Self-inflicted suffering** (自致斯苦).

Today, as disciple **某** (某) establishes this ritual,
We reflect upon the **day of our native star’s descent** (本命之日),
The **beginning of receiving our form from *qi*** (禀气受形之始),
And the **source of our transformation and birth** (化生之本).

The **Daoist teachings on the Great Cavern of the One** (道家大洞帝一之法),
All emphasize **cultivating and refining the spirit** (练神),
**Gathering *qi* to preserve life** (结气保命),
On the **day of one’s native star** (皆以本命之日).

The **method of generating the True and transmitting it to others** (生真诵度人之法),
Also requires **cultivating and preserving the soul-spirit** (行持魂神),
**Purifying and rectifying the ten thousand *qi*** (澄正万炁),
So that one may **long retain the roots of one’s native star** (长存则知本命之根本),
And **never pass over this day in vain** (不可虚过).

Today, all gathered in this **Daoist ritual hall** (道场),
Should know that **Heaven’s command is most weighty** (天命至重),
And **cannot be lightly prayed for** (不可轻祷).
Though we **wear the badge of the Most High Perfection** (佩至真),
And **participate in the Great Dao’s cultivation** (参修大法),
Our **bodies dwell amidst the five impurities** (处身五浊),
And our **traces are stained by the six dusts** (染迹六尘),
Yet even in **presenting our petitions** (启奏之间),
There may be **obstacles and hindrances** (不无窒碍).

First, we must **purify our spirits and calm our thoughts** (澄神静虑),
**Devoutly uphold the precepts** (仰奉戒约),
**Keep our bodies and minds clean and tranquil** (清静身心),

**Opening the Hall and Practicing the Dao**
**Ascending the Platform and Performing the Law Affairs as Prescribed**

Each reverently salutes the Master, holding thoughts in accordance with the Dao.

**Declaring the Sacred Warding Talismans**
The Five Stars arrayed in radiance, illuminating the five directions.
The Water Star repels calamity, the Woodly Virtue brings prosperity.
The Wandering Star dispels disaster, the Great White Star wards off soldiers.
The Stationary Star holds firm, benefiting the family and state.
Names inscribed on jade tablets, characters recorded in the Celestial Palace.

Riding the gusts and scattering brilliance, soaring through the boundless void.
Moving unseen in the dark, wandering and feasting across the ten directions.
Five clouds float as a canopy, summoning spirits and capturing winds.
Commanding myriad souls, guarding the Dao’s true and authentic essence,
And the Celestial Master of the Way, in harmony with the Dao’s primordial essence.

**Striking the Law Drum Twenty-Four Times**

Invoked are the Three Sovereigns of the Supreme Three Heavens—**Heavenly Primordial Origin (玄元始)**, **Heavenly Primordial Essence (始三炁)**, and **Heavenly Primordial Virtue (无上三天)**—
**The Supreme Dao Lord (太上道君)**, **The Supreme Lao Lord (太上老君)**,
And the **North Dipper Longevity-Sustaining Celestial Emperor (北斗延生尊帝)**,
Who summon forth the **Three Five Officials of the Middle (三五功曹)**—
Subordinates, left and right attendants, incense-bearers,
Postal dragon couriers, bridesmaids of the **Golden Boy (金童)**,
**Jade Girl messengers (玉女)** who convey words and scatter flowers,
**Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans (五帝直符)**, **Direct Day Incense Officials (直日香官)**,
And the **Thirty-Six (合三十六人)** in full array.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
With headgear and sashes trailing streamers,
Opening the **Mysterious Dao Hall’s (玄坛)** earthly and territorial spirits,
And the **authentic deities of the domain (方域神真)**.

I, the humble servant, now practice the Dao in quiet night,
And earnestly present this invocation to enter the sacred intent.
With all sincerity and devotion, my pleas are already recorded and heard,
May the **Supreme Dao’s Ten-Directional True Essence (十方至真道炁)** descend,
And the **Luminous Treasure of Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光)** flow into my being,
So that my invocation may swiftly reach the **Supreme Boundless Dao (无极大道)**,
Before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor of the Supreme (昊天玉皇上帝)**.

**Requesting the invocation of the Law’s station.**

The assembled servants, [name] and others,
With utmost sincerity and reverence, now invoke:
The **Emperor of the Natural Void and Primordial Origin (虚无自然元始天尊)**,
The **Supreme Dao Lord (太上大道君)**,
The **Supreme Lao Lord (太上老君)**,
The **Heavenly Jade Emperor of the Supreme (昊天玉皇上帝)**,
The **Nine Celestial Sovereigns of the Upper Truth (九皇上真)**,
The **Ten-Directional True Saints Who Have Attained the Dao (十方已得道大圣)**,
All **Honorable Lords and Masters (众至真，诸君丈人)**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Supreme Scriptures and the Great Law of the Mysterious Middle (三十六部尊经玄中大法师)**,
The **Celestial Emperor of the Rounded Concavity (圆穹玄象)**,
The **Luminaries of the Sun and Moon, Stars and Dipper (日月星辰)**,
The **North Dipper Celestial Emperor (北斗尊帝)**,
The **Seven Primordial Stars of Auxiliary Support (七元辅弼星君)**,
The **Great Emperor of the Southern Pole (南极大帝)**,
The **Honorable Lord Marshal (丈人司马)**,
The **Six Departments of Celestial Officials (六司星君)**,
The **Native Star of My Fate (本命元辰)**,
The **Peaked Mountains and Encompassing Seas of the Perfected Realms (洞天海岳)**,
The **Three Realms’ Official Retainers (三界官属)**,
And **All Authentic Spirits (一切真灵)**.

We, the humble servants, now dedicate [name] as a disciple,
Who, in this hour, falls under the **Native Star of My Fate (本命所属)** and the **North Dipper’s [specific star] Celestial Official (北斗某星君)**.
Last night, we established a **flower-decked altar (华坛)**,
And solemnly prepared a **Luminous Treasure of Auspicious Light for Longevity and Blessings (延生注禄灵宝清醮)**.
We command the humble servants to perform this **month’s day and hour’s (月日时)** fasting and ritual,
To **offer blessings and dispel calamities (荐福消灾)**,
To **present petitions with earnest wishes (奏章恳愿)**,
To **augment longevity and fortune (增延福寿)**,
And to **rescue and guide the living and the departed (济度存亡)**.

I, the humble servant, consider that my disciple [name]’s life is bound to the mortal realm,
And their fate originates from the **Celestial Bureau (天府)**.
If we do not **perform the expiatory rites (醮)** and thank the **True Lords (真君)**,
Or **recite the scriptures and practice the Dao (转经行道)**,
Then the **Celestial Records of fate (天曹命历)** lack means to extend their calculations,
And the **Underworld’s register of sins (阴司罪簿)** lacks means to erase their names.

We, the humble servants, now earnestly and sincerely beseech,
And humbly pray for the **Heavenly Grace (天恩)** to wash away and forgive,
All the **innumerable sins from eons past (亿劫以来)**,
Even unto this very day, of the **three karmas and six senses (三业六根)**;
Or when the **soul and spirit are ensnared (魂神被系)**,
And **calamities strike like a bell (祸患来锺)**;
Or when **grave illnesses persist without cure (重病不痊)**,
And **malevolent spirits prevail in harm (邪妖克害)**;

Or when **tomb disputes summon the dead (冢讼征呼)**,
Or when the **departed return to haunt (先亡复连)**,
Or when **Heaven itself sends reproach (上天谴责)**,
Or when **ghosts below bring false accusations (下鬼诉诬)**—
All these woes we now beseech to sever,
That our bodies may be cleansed and tranquil,
Our petitions heard by the **Celestial Bureaus (天司)**,
And our fate aligned with **True Grace (真恩)**.

May we grant our disciple [Name] within his allotted lifespan
To **lengthen his years and fulfill his virtue (增绿增寿)**,
That he may **stand in merit, aid living beings (立功济物)**,
And when his **virtue is complete (功满德就)**,
Serve before the **Imperial Dao of Boundless Mystery (帝宸无极道)**.

**Repentance (忏悔)**.
**Reaffirmation of the Dao’s rank (重称法位)**.

We, the humble servants, in utmost sincerity,
Prostrate before the **Primordial Sovereign of Natural Void (虚无自然元始天尊)**,
The **Supreme Dao Lord (太上大道君)**,
The **Supreme Venerable Lord (太上老君)**,
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault (昊天玉皇上帝)**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of Truth (九皇上真)**,
The **Ten Directions’ Perfected Saints (十方已得道大圣)**,
The **众至真 (Crowd of Ultimate Truths)**,
The **Honored Masters (诸君丈人)**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of Mysterious Great Law (三十六部尊经玄中大法师)**,
The **Celestial Vault’s Rotating Symbols—Emperors of Sun, Moon, Stars, and the Northern Dipper (圆穹玄象、日月星辰、北斗尊帝)**,
The **Seven Celestial Ministers of the Five Elements (七元辅弼星君)**,
The **Southern Pole Emperor (南极大帝)**,
The **Honored Marshal (丈人司马)**,
The **Six Celestial Bureaus’ Star Lords (六司星君)**,
The **Native Star of Fate (本命元辰)**,
The **Immortal Peaks and Sacred Isles (洞天海岳)**,
The **Three Realms’ Officials (三界官属)**,
And **all True Spirits (一切真灵)**.

We humbly hear that the **Zen Patriarchs expounded teachings (禅黎演教)**,
Opening the gate to **ward off calamities and deliver from peril (开禳灾度厄)**;
That the **Jade Bureau transmitted scriptures (玉局传经)**,
Holding the **method to erase death and prolong life (有削死延生之法)**.

Thus, we follow the **ritual canons (遵依科教)**,
Establishing the **fasting altar (开建斋坛)**,
Inviting **Heaven’s blessings (迎集天祺)**,
Cleansing the **sand of time (被除时沙)**,
Extending **luminous fortune (上延景贶)**,
And **preventing lingering misfortunes (以弭余迍)**.

From the outset of our petition,
We declare the fast’s beginning,
To **propagate the Dao’s transformation (宣行於道化)**,
To **broadly benefit all (洪济於斯人)**,
To **prolong life eternally (延永命於无穷)**,
And to **fulfill sincerity with response (达至诚於有感)**.

Moreover, receiving this edict,
How dare we not report it above?

**Proclamation of the Petition:**
As the words are clear and our devotion sincere,
We offer **incense of fragrant devotion (致苾芬)** to intercede,
And **burn sacred herbs (燎馥郁)** to ascend to Heaven.
With **sword and battle array (执锋步斗)**, the hundred demons retreat;
With **seal and scripture proclaimed (披篆宣文)**, the thousand calamities disperse.

We array the **Celestial Musicians in their pavilion (命霓裳於清馆)**,
And set the **expiatory feast in the Hall of Splendor (设醮席於华堂)**.
The **lamps blaze with radiance (明烛腾辉)**,
The **incense mills scatter sacred mist (灵磨散影)**,
The **bells and chimes mark the hymns’ rhythm (锺磬节空歌之奏)**,
And the **banners summon the Celestial Procession (旌幢引仙驭之临)**.

With **one chant, our focused intent ascends (一讽精意之升闻)**,
And the **multitudes of True Ones gather in response (感众真之来格)**.

May the **Three Pure Ones of Supreme Holiness (三清上圣)**,
The **Ten Extremes’ High Perfected (十极高真)**,
Descend in spirit to **oversee and inspect our sincere hearts (垂神省览，监察丹衷)**.
We pray that the **Overseers of Inspection (勒监察使者)**,
The **Local True Officials (里域真官)**,
The **Golden Boys who transmit petitions (奏事金童)**,
The **Jade Maidens who bear messages (传言玉女)**,
And the **Soul Jewel Officials (灵宝官属)**,
All in **unified devotion (一合同心)**,
May they **purify within and without (肃清内外)**,
And **guard this Dao-field (营护道场)**.

Thus may our spirits remain steadfast,
Our thoughts instantly answered,
Our petitions ascend unobstructed,
And the **fast’s merit be fulfilled (斋功成就)**,
So that our disciple [Name] may
**Attain rounded wisdom (智慧性圆)**,
**Awaken the Dao-heart (道心开发)**,
**Exit the path of delusion (出群迷径)**,
**Enter the Gate of the Mysterious (入希夷门)**,
**Return to the True Tradition (皈奉真宗)**,
And **realize the realm of life’s honor (达生荣界)**.

We, unworthy servants, prostrate in deepest supplication,
Twice bowing in reverence.

**Twelve Vows (十二愿)**.
**Reignite the Incense (复炉)**.

We now command the **Incense Officials and Messengers (摄香官使者)**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords (左右龙虎君)**,
And the **Attendant Spirit Officials (侍香诸灵官)**—
At the place where we formerly **practiced the Dao in quiet nights (静夜行道之所)**,
May **golden elixir and jade-green essence spontaneously arise (自然生金液丹碧)**,
And **mushrooms, herbs, and hundred spirits gather (芝英百灵)**,
As the **multitudes of True Ones assemble (众真交会)** here before this incense burner.

May we now pray that the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Maiden (十方仙童玉女)**,
Attending the **fragrant mist of orchids (接侍兰烟)**,
Transmit our **earlier sincere petitions (传臣向来所启之诚)**,
Swiftly to the **Presence of the Supreme Dao of Boundless Mystery (速达径御至真无极大道)** before the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault (昊天玉皇上帝御前)**.

**Exit the Hall in Praise (出堂颂)**.
**Depart the Gate in Chant (出户)**.

The ritual ascends the platform as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Daoist Master in accordance with the law.

**Proclaim the Sacred Incantations of Protection:**
The Five Stars align, illuminating the Five Directions.
The Water Star wards off calamities, the Wood Star brings prosperity.
The Wandering Star dispels misfortune, the Great White Star repels soldiers.
The Fixed Star steadies its position, benefiting the family and the nation.
Their names are inscribed on the Jade Tablets, their characters recorded in the Imperial Archives.

They ride the gusting winds and scatter across the boundless sky,
Entering and exiting the unseen realms, feasting in the Ten Directions.
The Five Clouds float as banners, summoning spirits and capturing winds.
They command the myriad spirits, attend the Daoist Sage, and harmonize with the True Dao.

**Strike the Law Drum Twenty-Four Times.**

Invoking the **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Beginning Three Qi (无上三天玄元始三炁)**,

Those who exit are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,

Opening the **Mysterious Daoist Hall (玄坛)** and summoning the **Land and Domain Spirits (土地方域神真)**.

Now, as we **practice the Dao in quiet nights (静夜行道)**,
We humbly present our petitions to enter the spirit.
All our sincere desires have been recorded and heard—
May the **Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions’ Boundless Mystery (太上十方至真道炁)**,
The **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光)**,

And all **True Spirits (一切真灵)**.

We hear that the **Seven Celestial Energies (群张元气)**,
The Northern Dipper serves as the pivot for the Seven Governors;
Its commands stir all things to life, the Northern Dipper as the throat of the Celestial Realm.

Behold these **multitudes of celestial symbols (群象)**,
Bound to our **Native Star of Fate (命元)**,
As their movements traverse the heavens and earth,
Their essence descends to determine our **short or long lifespan (短长之命)**.
They oversee the years and govern their respective domains,
Their total transformation the great origin of all life.
From the noble to the common folk—**emperors and officials (王公)**,
To the **scholars and peasants (士庶)**—
All are equally granted, their destinies aligned with the **Celestial Primordial (天元)**;
Their hidden movements cycle endlessly, each in turn presiding over our **Native Star (辰次)**.
Within a single year, we observe the **cycles of time (时运)**,
As the **Six Degrees (六度)** descend upon the mortal realm.

When the **Northern Dipper’s influence descends (飙驭下翔)**,
Its **spiritual blessings are vast and all-encompassing (灵恩博济)**,
It fixes the **limits of our lifespan (寿数之期限)**,
As the **foundation of our nature and form (性相之本根)**.
Though the **Celestial Dao is impartial (天道公而无私)**,

We, the **Thirty-Six Personages (备位真司)**,
Devote our hearts to the **fasting laws (斋法)**.
The **Dragon Talismans and Phoenix Seals (龙章凤篆)**,
Unfolding their **wondrous teachings (妙蕴)** to spread far and wide;
The **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light (宝笈琅函)**,
Assisting the **Daoist winds (仙风)** to manifest and disperse.

Moreover, we present our **sincere petitions (奉词旨)**,
Daring not to withhold them—
The **fasting intentions inscribed in green words (斋意青词)**,
Will now be **proclaimed and presented (谨当宣奏)**.

We rely on the **Supreme Law of the Daoist Bridge (无上之法桥)**,
To **universally save both the living and the dead (存亡普度)**.

With this **Quiet Night Dao Practice (静夜行道)**,
We request that the **assembled ritual officials (法众等)**,
Light the **first pinch of incense (运兹初捻上香)**,
And **offer tribute to the Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures (供养十方一切道宝)**.
We, the **Thirty-Six Personages (臣等)**,

To the **Supreme Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable (太上元始天尊)**,
The **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault (昊天玉皇上帝)**,
And the **Nine Grades of Supreme Saints (九品上圣)**.

With these **meritorious deeds (是功德)**,
We **humbly pray for the current emperor’s glory (仰祝今上皇帝陛下)**.
May his **auspicious lifespan be illustrious (景命有赫)**,
His **lifespan endless (万寿无疆)**.
May **jade and silk offerings be swift as galloping steeds (玉帛骏奔)**,

Now, as we **burn this incense (故烧香)**,
We **return to our reliance on the Daoist Sage’s Supreme Virtue (自归依道尊大圣众至真之德)**.
After attaining the Dao,
We **ascend to the Formless Realm (升入无形)**,
And **harmonize with the True Dao (和与道合真)**.

With this **Quiet Night Dao Practice (静夜行道)**,
We request that the **assembled ritual officials (法众等)**,
Light the **second pinch of incense (运兹二捻上香)**,
And **offer tribute to the Ten Directions’ Scriptural Treasures (供养十方一切经宝)**.
We, the **Thirty-Six Personages (臣等)**,
**Return our bodies, return our spirits, return our fates (皈身皈神皈命)**,
To the **Supreme Jade-Canopied Daoist Lord (太上玉宸大道君)**,
The **Purple Clump Heavenly Emperor (紫微天皇大帝)**,
And the **Nine Grades of Supreme True Ones (九品上真)**.

With these **meritorious deeds (是功德)**,
We **return to our reliance on the Daoist Sage’s Supreme Virtue (归流醮主某九世七玄)**,
To the **Ten Thousand Ancestors (亿曾万祖)**,
To the **Nightly Dao Hall of the Underworld (阴宫夜府)**,

And **be freed from the bonds of ghostly servitude (断鬼神连逮之役)**,
So that their **descendants may rejoice (庆流后裔)**,
And their **merits extend to their kin (功及宗人)**.

Now, as we **burn this incense (故烧香)**,
We **return to our reliance on the Scriptural Sage’s Supreme Virtue (自归依经尊大圣众至真之德)**.
After attaining the Dao,
We **ascend to the Realm of Non-Action (升入无为)**,
And **harmonize with the True Dao (和与道合真)**.

With this quiet night of Dao practice,
We now invite the assembled **Dharma Assembly** to take up these three pinches of incense,
And offer them to the **Ten Directions’ Venerable Treasures**.

We, the humble servants, **surrender our bodies, spirits, and fates** to the **Supreme Jade Throne Dao Lord of the Golden Gate**, the **Purple Micro Emperor of the Northern Pole**, the **Nine-Ranked Supreme Immortal**.

Through these merits, we dedicate them to the **Ritual Master** [Name],
At this auspicious hour of his **Native Celestial Stem-Branch**,
To bestow upon him **uncommon blessings**.

May he **extend his lifespan** to match the longevity of tortoises and cranes,
And **remove all calamities**, aligning his virtue with the **jade and bi discs**.

For all years of his life,
And through the cycles of his fate—
Whether **dark eclipses** afflict him,
Or **black talismans** mark his destiny,
Or he encounters the **clashing of his Native Celestial Stem-Branch**,
Or his **native qi weakens**—
May his **Native Celestial Stem-Branch Star Officials** and **Native Constellation Deities** all come to guard him,
So that he **never falls into peril**,
Transforming death’s decree into life’s renewal,
And turning misfortune into fortune.

We rely on the **Dao’s protective influence**,
And gratefully accept the **Mysterious Rest**.

Now, as we burn this incense,
We **surrender to the Teacher’s Supreme Virtue**.

After attaining the Dao,
We **ascend to the Realm of Non-Action**,
And **harmonize with the True Dao**.

**[Chanting the Square]**, **[Repentance]**, **[Three Invocations]**, **[Three Salutations]**.

We, the humble servants **[Name]**, together in sincerity, now humbly petition:

The **Primordial Void-Natural Beginning-of-Heaven Venerable Sovereign**,
The **Supreme Dao Lord**,
The **Supreme Old Lord**,
The **Jade Emperor of the Azure Sky**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of Supreme Truth**,
The **Ten Directions’ Already Dao-Attained Great Saints**,
The **Crowd of Supreme Truths**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scriptural Masters of the Mysterious Law**,
The **Circular Vault of Heavenly Symbols**, the **Monthly Stars**, the **Northern Dipper Venerable Emperor**,
The **Seven Celestial Officials of the Five Agents**,
The **Southern Pole Emperor**,
The **Lord Marshal**,
The **Six Celestial Ministers**,
The **Native Celestial Stem-Branch**,
The **Cavern-Heaven and Ocean-Peak Officials**,
The **Three Realms’ Attendants**,
And **All True Spirits**.

We, the humble servants, **prostrate ourselves** before the **Supreme’s boundless compassion**,
Which acts as **parent to all beings**;
And the **Native Celestial Stem-Branch Scriptures and Incantations**,
Which serve as the **crossing to this age**.

If not for this **Compassionate Ark**,
Who could reach the **Dao’s shore**?
From the **Domain of the Saints and Truths**,
Permission is granted for its **proclamation across the world**.

Since the **beginning of the Eternal Life Reformed Era**,
Until this very day;
From the **Great Clarity’s Propagation of the Teaching**,
Passed down to these humble servants.

Though unworthy of our **frail mortal nature**,
We dare to **recite the Mysteries of the True Science**.

「We humbly beseech the **Nine Celestial Worthies** to renew their blessings,
And the **Three Caverns’ Radiant Light** to shine forth.
With **great compassion**, they pity us,
And with **great forgiveness**, they open the way.

We pray to absolve this disciple from **all past karmic transgressions**,
From the **beginningless aeons** down to this very life,
Where we have **sacrificed our bodies** to receive this command,
And **entered suffering from suffering**—
Drifting through the **Six Paths of Rebirth**,
Mingling with the masses of beings,
Some rich, some poor,
Some noble, some lowly,
Some born in barbarian lands,
Some in the Central States,
Yet **none have awakened to the True Dao**,
Nor known the **Sutras and Precepts**.

We chase fleeting trends,
To gain worldly wealth,
**Losing our nature** and following **desires**,
**Greedy for gain**, betraying **virtue**.
We **envy the virtuous** and resent the good,
Not befriending those who surpass us;
We **flaunt false teachings** to commit evil,
Not fearing the **Yin Court’s records**.

Our **roots of sin** run deep,
Our **karmic bonds** entangle us.
Some offend the **Gods of Grain and Silk**,
Others face retribution from the **Yin Judges and Yang Punishments**—
Violating the **True Science’s doctrines**,
Breaking the **Three Caverns’ sacred canons**.

The **Five Emperors and Four Officials** note our **self-made sins**,
The **Three Officials and Nine Ministries** examine our **transgressions**.
We are **doomed by Heaven’s reckoning of years**,
With no **meritorious deeds** to **dispel disasters or atone for sins**.

Our **souls are bound**,
And **calamities chime** in.
Some suffer **year after year** with unhealing illnesses,
Others endure **decade upon decade** under **demonic and malevolent harm**—
Near at hand, **premature deaths** and **endless rebirths**,
Far afield, **ancestral disputes** and **summonings to the grave**.

Accused by **lower ghosts**,
Condemned by **Heaven’s decree**,
Our misfortunes **chain our ancestors**,
And **flow down to our descendants**.

Now we **enter the Gate of Redemption and Gratitude**,
And **beg release from the agony of ruin**.

For those **not yet pardoned**, grant pardon;
For those **not yet forgiven**, grant forgiveness—
Answering our plea for **blessed longevity**,
Hearing our vow to **offer vegetarian rites and Daoist expiations**.

Those who have **fallen from grace**,
All face **three calamities and nine adversities**;
Those who are **guarded and protected**,
Are under the **ten thousand saints and myriad truths**.

We **transform our shortened lifespan** into **extended years**,
And **change our fate of decline** into **auspicious fortune**.
May we attain **wealth, nobility, wisdom, and clarity**,
Standing as **the most exalted among mortals**;
And **joy and ease**, securing **boundless longevity**.

May blessings be **equally shared** among our household,
And **graces extend** to our posterity.
Above, we **acknowledge Heaven’s Worthies’ boundless compassion**,
Below, we **align with our humble servants’ sincere devotion**—
**Respectfully submitted** for their **hearing and approval**.

The **Twelve Vows** are fulfilled.
The **Sacrificial Tripod** is restored.

**Respectfully, we summon** the **Fragrant Officials and Messengers**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals**,
And the **Attendant Spirits of Incense**—
To **manifest at this disciple’s former quiet Daoist retreat**,
Where **golden elixir and verdant jade** naturally arise,
And **hundreds of sacred herbs and spirits** gather.
May all **true spirits** convene here,
Before this **fragrant sacrificial tripod**.

May the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens**
Attend to the **sandalwood incense**,
And **carry forth** the sincerity of this disciple’s supplications,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless and Limitless**,
Before the **Celestial Jade Emperor of the Highest Heaven**.

**Hymn of Departure from the Hall**.
**Hymn of Departure from the Household**.

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume 62**

**Ritual Procedure:**
The officiant ascends the platform as prescribed.
Each disciple reverently invokes the Master’s presence in accordance with the law.
The **Sacred Protective Incantations** are proclaimed.

The **Five Stars** shine forth, illuminating the **Five Directions**:
The **Water Star** repels calamity,
The **Wood Star** brings prosperity,
The **Mars Star** dissipates misfortune,
The **Jupiter Star** wards off war,
The **Lunar Star** steadies the land—
For the **state and family**, auspicious and upright.
Their names are inscribed on **Jade Tablets**,
Their records filed in the **Celestial Archives**.
They ride the **gales**, scattering their radiance,
Soaring through the **vast heavens**,
Entering and exiting the **mystic void**,
Feasting and reveling across the **Ten Directions**.

**Five-colored clouds** float as banners,
Summoning spirits and harnessing winds.
They command **ten thousand spirits**,
Guarding the **Celestial Sage** above,
In harmony with the **Dao** and the **True**.

The **Supreme Law-Drum** is struck **twenty-four times**.

We invoke:
The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin Qi**,
The **Most High Dao Lord**,
The **Most High Laozi**—
To summon forth from this disciple’s body:
The **Three Five Officials of Merit**,
The **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**,
The **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**,
The **Dragon-Courier Clerks**,
The **Attendant Golden Boys**,
The **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens**,
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,
The **Direct-Sun Incense Officials**—
**Thirty-six in total**, now manifesting.

Those who emerge are **arrayed in solemn splendor**,
Their **headdresses and sashes** adorned with trailing ribbons.
They open the **Mystic Altar’s Earth and Domain Spirits**.

This disciple, now in **quiet nightly Dao-practice**,
Humbly presents this **sincere petition**,
With **heartfelt devotion already recorded and reported**.
We pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Ten Directions’ True Qi**,
The **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light**,
May descend and flow into this disciple’s body,
So that our supplications may swiftly reach
The **Supreme Dao of the Boundless and Limitless**,
Before the **Celestial Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven**.

**Law-Position is proclaimed.**

We, the **officiating disciples of such-and-such rank**,
Humbly and sincerely petition:
The **Primordial Origin Heavenly Worthy of the Void-Natural**,
The **Most High Dao Lord**,
The **Most High Laozi**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of Highest Truth**,
The **Ten Directions’ Already Enlightened Great Saints**,
The **Assemblage of True Ones**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Worthy Masters of Mystic Law**,
The **Round Dome’s Celestial Symbols**—
The **Sun, Moon, and Stars**,
The **North Dipper Sovereign Emperor**,
The **Seven Elemental Ministers of Stars**,
The **Southern Pole Great Emperor**,
The **Sire Marshal**,
The **Six Bureau Star Lords**,
The **Native Star of Our Fate**,
The **Peak-Hall and Sea-Mountain Caverns**,
The **Three Realms’ Officials and Spirits**,
And **all True Spirits**.

We, your disciples, **prostrate in awe**, for:
**Life and fate** depend on the **Mystic Dao’s** birth,
**Form and body** are governed by our **Native Star’s** domain.
Our **Native Star** rides the **Celestial Steed**,
Bearing the **Heavenly Edict** to dissolve harm and disaster;
The **Seven Elemental Stars** observe human affairs,
To augment **auspicious virtue and longevity**.

When **sacred威仪** manifests in the world,
The **True Saints** surely hear its **resonant spirit**.

We reverently acknowledge the **North Dipper Native Star True Lord**—
The **Pivot of Creation**, the **Root of Yin-Yang**,
Who **presides over human fate** and **commands ten thousand spirits**,
With the **power to reverse death and bestow life**,
And the **method to atone for sins and dispel calamity**.

For the **Dao is the mother of ten thousand qi**,
And **Heaven is the ancestor of all spirits**.
Though **fate is governed by the Seven Stars**,
All matters **pertain to the Celestial Treasury**.
Thus, the **Five Phases** share their influence,
And the **Seven Celestial Officials** follow the same law.

When the **Native Star’s hour arrives**,
The **Assemblage of Spirits** descends in full.

The **officiating disciple of such-and-such name**,
Humbly extends **filial devotion**,
Unveiling the **essence of ritual**,
Elevating **sacred rites** upon the **Spiritual Altar**,
And receiving the **august presence** in the **quiet night**.

The **cloud-gongs resound in succession**,
Singing the **celestial hymns of the void**;
The **treasured scrolls are proclaimed anew**,
Releasing the **luxuriant, verdant qi**.

**Sacred feasts and fragrant wines** are prepared,
In **reverent accord with the Spirit’s timing**—
How dare we forget our **original source**?

We humbly pray:
May the **Eight Precious Ones** pause their journey,
The **Three Pure Ones** descend in pairs,
Their **Celestial Procession** descending from the sky,
Their **Jade Flowers** raining upon the courtyard.
**Five-colored clouds** drape the earth,
As the **Celestial Procession arrives**;
**Nine-Heaven True Qi** showers the altar,
And the **Emperor’s Presence** blazes forth.

**Ten thousand spirits** attend in guard,
**All Heavens** descend to witness—
Overseeing this **unwavering sincerity**,
Bestowing **inexhaustible longevity**,
Fulfilling the **Five Blessings**,
Accumulating the **Hundred Auspicious Fortunes**,
Erasing the **Three Ages’ sins**,
Gathering the **One Body’s divine essence**.

Thus may the **officiating disciple of such-and-such name**
Have **no deeds unrequited** yet naturally fall away,
And **meritorious acts** ever multiply—
May their **lineage bear loyal and filial descendants**,
Their **person accumulate Daoist and Immortal virtues**,
Living to receive **transcendence**,
And **water and land alike** be blessed by their grace.

We, the **officiating disciples and ritual attendants**,
Are **profoundly devout**, **earnest in prayer**, and **humble in supplication**,
Beseeching with **utter sincerity**—
We **prostrate and kowtow twice**, welcoming the **Sacred Procession**.

**The Saint is invoked.**
**First Offering.**
**Flower-Sprinkling.**

**Law-Position is proclaimed again.**

We, the **officiating disciples of such-and-such rank**,
Humbly and sincerely petition:
The **Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness**,
The **Celestial Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven**,
The **Thrones of All Heavens**,
The **Three Treasures’ Divine Lords**.

We have heard:
The **Six Jia** are tamed within,
Following the **mechanisms of fate’s balance**;
The **Five Phases** succeed in cycles,
Marking the **tortoise-and-bird omens**.

Within the **three hundred and sixty decades**,
All **seventy-two seasonal shifts** are recorded.
A **year’s cycle** is ruled by **one star**—
Examine the **shift of Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches**,
And the **hidden correspondences of geomancy** unfold.

Upon the **Emerald Tower’s Hall**,
The **consuming-disaster text** was spoken in the **Year of the Horse (丙午)**;
Within the **Jade Bureau’s Seat**,
The **prolonging-life secret** was revealed in the **Year of the Sheep (乙未)**.

The **Years of the Tiger (丁丑), Rabbit (丁卯), and Snake (丁巳)**—
The **Jade Maiden** presides;
The **Years of the Rat (甲子), Tiger (甲寅), and Monkey (甲申)**—
The **Three Sovereigns** govern.

**Lord Guan** met the **Most High** at **noon on a Gengwu day**,
**Ge Xuan** received the **Celestial True One** at **night on a Jingyin day**.

Thus it is known:
When the **Native Star’s hour arrives**,
The **hundred spirits** gather.

The **officiating disciple of such-and-such name**,
With **incense and flowers as offerings**,
First **aligns the body in sincerity**.
Gazing upon the **North Dipper’s Celestial Pole**,
They **direct the heart in petition**;
Standing at the **ritual’s incense-table**,
They **focus the mind on the august spirits**.

The **First Offering’s rites** are completed,
And the **Heavens’ and All-Heavens’ Saints** descend in rank.

To **honor the gods**, we value **virtue**, not **flavor**—
May we drink the **fragrance of Illuminated Virtue**;
To **sacrifice to Heaven**, we seek **substance**, not **form**—
Hoping to **transmit sincere and earnest prayers**.

---

With heartfelt words and earnest petition,
We open this **Red Character’s** scroll,
Summoning your **Purple Clarity’s** shade.

We beg for the **gale’s swift return**,
To behold our **solemn oaths**—
The disciple’s **green petitions** now unfold.

**Proclaimed words** are declared:
With **devout sincerity** clearly seen,
We seek **Original Command from Heaven**,
And solemnly perform the **science of rites**.

To preserve the **nature of the Sage-born**,
We eternally honor the **august spirits**.

May the **Supreme Saint** descend with grace,
The **Virtuous Sovereign** turn with favor.
Within arm’s reach, the **Celestial Capital’s** chariot arrives,
The **True Companions** gather in solemnity;
With **composed bearing**, the **Celestial Truth** descends,
Their **serene faces** radiant and dignified.

We station the **Celestial Ritual’s** array,
And convey our **sincere devotion** to the **Imperial Hearing**.

May the **divine response** align with our prayers,
And the **subtle omens** manifest—
Granting **auspicious responses** in secret.

Daring to seize this **Original Command’s** moment,
We pray for **Heaven’s universal blessings**.

We, the disciples and ritual officers,
With boundless joy and reverent exultation,
Prostrate ourselves in awe,
And humbly present the **Second Offering**.

**Scatter flowers.**

We, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,
With united sincerity, petition:
The **Northern Dipper’s Imperial Seat**,
The **Seven Stars of the Dipper’s Core**,
The **Five Blessings and Ten Gods**,
The **Twenty-Eight Constellations**,
The **Encircled Heavens’ Celestial Luminaries**,
All **august spirits**.

We have heard:
**Fate is decreed by Heaven**—
Who does not rely on the **Great Creator’s** work?
The **Northern Dipper** truly governs all beings.

From the **Great Polarity’s** emergence,
The **Three Lights** shone in succession—
The **Dipper’s Handle** above,
Called the **Imperial Chariot**, moving at the center.

It alone holds the **Symbolic Measure’s** exalted rank,
Turning the **Heaven and Earth** with precision;
Its **subtle transformations** work in mystery,
Bestowing **life’s essence** upon all beings.

The **radiant light of a single star**,
Governs the **fates of ten thousand folk**.

The ritual officer of such-and-such name
Remembers his **Original Nature’s** source,
Reflecting on the **beginning of his birth**—
His **Command** was opened first,
And his **form** was nurtured today.

He fears the **ancestors’ past delusion**,
And dreads the **Heavenly Lord’s** punishment for neglect.

He solemnly sets the **Daoist Ritual’s** feast,
And renews the **offerings’ rites**.

Incense curls in **auspicious mist**,
Divine lamps gleam with **sacred light**.
The **Law’s sounds** resound,
The **Celestial Ritual’s** steps are orderly.

At the **Heavenly-Human convergence**,
The time of **blessings and fortunes descending**,
The **spiritual contract** is fulfilled—
**Supreme sincerity** moves the divine.

May our **lifespan extend**,
Our **domain of longevity** boundless;
May we be **granted divine felicity**,
And our **foundation of blessings** forever firm.

The **Seven Thousand Gods of the Northern Dipper** guard and protect,
The **Three Thousand Officials of the Southern Mound** follow in attendance,
Sweeping away **disasters and obstructions**,
Dispelling **demons and malevolent spirits**.

The **Five Visceral Gods** ever preserve,
The **Three-Life Men** endure forever.

For women, it is said:
**Preserving the form** is supreme—
None may depart from the body.

The **Imperial Seat’s** radiance flows,
**Heavenly Essence** scatters its hues—
Each guards their **constellation’s station**,
Together storing **auspicious fields**.

We, the disciples and ritual officers,
With utmost **devotion and trembling reverence**,
Prostrate ourselves in awe,
And humbly present the **Final Offering**.

**Scatter flowers.**

We, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,
With renewed sincerity, petition:
The **Five Sacred Peaks and Ten Mountains**,
The **Three Rivers and Four Seas**,
The **Ten Isles and Three Lands**,
The **Four Great Waters and Nine Rivers**,
The **Blessed Earths and Tranquil Abodes**,
The **Cavern Heavens and Sacred Transformations**,
The **Three Bureaus’ Official Administrations**,
All **mighty and spiritual beings**.

We have heard:
**East, the Morning Star shines; West, the Long Regard**,
**South, the Basket Weave; North, the Dipper stands**.
Gazing upward at the **Celestial Patterns**,
Their **resplendent and dazzling** marks appear—
These **Seven Stars**, each one
**Inspiring life’s fundamental source**.

They **emanate supreme purity** beyond form,
And **direct the Great Creator’s** work in Heaven.

Recognizing the **star of our Original Command**,
We set the **Spiritual Treasure’s** rites to the **True**.

This is to **know one’s roots**,
And thus **not treat life lightly**.

The disciple of such-and-such name,
At the **auspicious hour’s selection**,
Now **formally presents** the **clear offerings**—
Yet fears that though his **intent is self-exhorted**,
His **conduct may not align with the Dao**.

He **clears his mind of distractions**,
Turning toward virtue and away from guilt;
He **consults the Celestial Maps’** paths,
Seeking the **Way** and pursuing **spiritual efficacy**.

He **deepens his pure intentions**,
Hoping for the **spirits’ repeated blessings**.

Now the **ritual is strictly observed without cessation**,
And the **three offerings** are fully completed;
The **mysterious responses** have already communicated—
May we **preserve a hundred years of eternal life**.

We humbly hope the **Three Pure Ones** bestow their gifts,
And the **Ten Directions’ High Worthies** shower their light.

May the **roots of sin be extinguished**,
So we may **reverently receive the sacred luminaries**;
May the **Great Auspicious Assembly** be restored,
And **never fade from human life**.

Let the **three calamities and four killings** be dispelled,
The **five afflictions and six harms** removed—
Without the **Seven Injuries**, yet under the **Seven Celestial Protectors’** guard,
Without the **Eight Difficulties**, yet under the **Eight Heavenly Observers’** watch—
May husbands and wives **preserve their lifelong union**,
May men and women **know the joy of family**,
May women **avoid childbirth’s misfortune**,
May ghosts **no longer entangle** the living,
May all **diseases be cured**,
May **epidemics spare us**,
May **evil spirits be subdued**,
May **wolves and tigers hide**,
May **official disasters and lawsuits** be forever erased,
May the **Earthly Nets and Heavenly Snares** dissolve,
May our **associations lack curses and slander**,
May our **travels be free from bandits and robbers**—
Together in our homes,
All may **attain peace and well-being**.

We, the disciples and ritual officers,
With **uttermost piety and solemn vigilance**,
Prostrate ourselves in awe to report.

**Proclaim the Merit and Virtue Sutra.**

We, the humble officials of such-and-such rank,
With **renewed sincerity**, petition:
The **Three Pure Ones and Supreme Saints**,
The **Ten Extremes’ High Worthies**,
The **Ocean-Mountains’ Spirits**,
The **Heavenly and Earthly Celestials**,
The **Three Realms’ Officials**,
All **mighty and spiritual beings**.

We humbly establish the **Clear Science**,
And **solemnly proclaim the fragrant offerings**.

**Ascending to the Celestial Pole**,
We **pay homage to the Vermilion Palace’s** august might;
**Inviting the True Spirits**,
Their **jade light** shines in the **void**.

We **three times draw the pure nectar**,
And **once present our supplicating words**—
**Overseeing from on high**,
Our prayers **lack no response**.

We reflect:
The disciple of such-and-such name
Has no other **affections**—
Only **virtue** he cultivates,
Hearing and **acting without delay**,
And **ritual fasting** he holds supreme.

When the **auspicious hour** arrives,
And the **Original Command** draws near,
The **evening’s spiritual platform** opens,
And the **six degrees of clouds** descend in pairs.

**Imperial Clarity** now illuminates,
And **karmic obstructions** vanish—
**Separately extending Heaven’s Palace’s** fate,
And **never severing humanity’s seed**.

May we **flow with True Qi**,
And be **nourished by Great Harmony**,
**Shine with Mysterious Light**,
And be **bathed in Divine Dew**—
So that the disciple of such-and-such name
May **gradually ascend to wondrous fruit**,
And **reestablish the Mysterious Merit**,
**Attaining the Dao’s emptiness**,
And **possessing perfect penetration in sagely wisdom**,
**Soaring in the Purple Clouds’ realm**,
**Ascending through the Golden Gate’s door**,
**Harmonizing with the Ten Thousand Saints**,
**Transcending the Three Realms** in freedom,
**Forever free from the Wheel of Rebirth**,
With **lifespan boundless**—
Silently speaking of the **Dao’s path now opened**,
All beginning **from this very day**.

Next, I humbly pray that the seven ancestral spirits of my disciple’s family may ascend,
And the nine generations of ancestral rites be honored in the realm of the departed.
May they bathe in the **Hall of Flowing Fire**,
And walk the path of **Zhu Ling’s Palace**.

Riding the **Qi of the Cavernous Yang**,
They receive the **Record of the Three Pure Ones**;
Free from the **multitude of ghosts**,
They depart the **bends of the spirit springs**.

Suffering is forever severed,
And toil is no longer heard—
Their blessings extend to future generations,
And their lineage’s fortune is prolonged.

Next, for parents, brothers, sisters,
Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters—
All sins and blemishes are cleansed,
And all receive blessings and protection.

The **Purple Register** records their virtues,
Increasing their fortune and rank before the **Jade Emperor’s ledger**;
The **Yellow Ledger** marks their deeds,
Inscribing their names in the **Great Imperial Hall above**.

All within the household receive their grace,
And a hundred generations share in their blessings.

May the **Nine Sovereigns’ calamities** be removed—
Though punishments strike, they cause no harm;
May the **Two Celestial Cycles’ misfortunes** be averted,
And their years instead grow longer through cosmic void.

The young and old live in peace,
And the clan remains harmonious.

Next, I pray for the **sword to rest and punishments to cease**,
And the **Dao to spread pure and refined**.
May great celebrations fill the land,
Without the calamity of **overturned caps**;
May divine blessings descend upon the people,
And songs of praise return to the heavens.

Let the **mixed teachings of chariot and scripture** be unified,
And the heavens and earth be steadied in peace.
The **Nine Suns** are tempered to six,
Controlling the **Eon’s cycle** without worry;
The **Four Celestial Assistants** govern a thousand officials,
Honoring loyalty and repaying the state.

Let boundless grace extend to all things,
And duties be bestowed upon all ministers.
All who dwell beneath the **covering canopy**,
Share in the harmonizing transformation of like-minded hearts.

Now, the **heavenly fragrance lingers in the air**,
And the **celestial guards are returning**—
The **Immortal Children** bear the scepter in advance,
And the **Cloud Chariot** ascends with the wind’s swiftness.

The disciples of the **True Class** have retired,
And the **fasting rites are complete**—
We have already received the **Heaven’s favor**,
And forever share in the **harmonized sacred period**.

Your disciple and the disciples who conducted the **rites of expiation**,
With deepest longing and gratitude,
Humbly present this petition.

**Twelve Wishes fulfilled.**
**The furnace is restored.**

With reverence, I command the **Fragrance Officials and Envoys**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
And the **Attendant Spirit Officials**—
That in the place where I have formerly practiced in quiet nights,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** will naturally arise,
Along with **Immortal Mushrooms and Hundred Spirits**,
And the **multitude of True Ones** will gather here before the incense furnace.

May I pray that the **Ten-Directional Immortal Children and Jade Maidens**
Attend the **Lantern Smoke**,
And swiftly convey my sincere petition
To the **Most High, Supreme, and Limitless Dao of the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign** before the **Heavenly Court**.

**Recite the Praise at the Hall’s Exit.**
**Depart the Door.**

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 62 concluded.**
**The Complete Daoist Ritual Standards, Volume 63**
*For the Three Caverns Scripture and Ritual Disciples, Composed by Zhong Li*
**The Grand Ritual of True Martial’s Responsive Virtue (真武灵应大醮仪)**
**The Auspicious Sovereign Ritual (佑圣醮仪)**, in three editions:
1. *Qianyao Chao’s* hidden and radiant version,
2. *Master Shi’s* great edition,
3. A recently compiled edition.

All are single-day rituals, lacking the full observances of night and day. Now, these three editions are merged, incorporating the *Du Tianxiang’s* Northern Emperor’s Ritual from *Guangting*, with the two *San Shang Xiang* (Three Upper Incense) sessions interwoven, expanded into *Qǐsàn* (ritual invocation and dismissal), and structured into three periods of practice, forming five volumes for ritual use.

**Ascending the Platform’s Ritual Procedures** follow the prescribed order.

**Courtly Attendance (Tíngcān):**
With humility, we, the positioned disciples, burn the **Dao-Qi (Way-Qi) incense**, **Virtue incense**, and **Non-Action-Natural incense**, and with sincere devotion, bow twice to petition:
The **Law-Lord, North Pole Pacifying Heaven True Martial Responsive Auspicious True Lord (北极镇天真武灵应佑圣真君)**,
The **Dark Heaven Primordial Holy Benevolent and Mighty Sovereign Emperor (玄天元圣仁威上帝)**,
The **Holy Father, Pure Joy King (圣父净乐国王)**,
The **Holy Mother, Virtuous Victory Empress (圣母善胜皇后)**,
The **North Pole Tianpeng Marshal of the Celestial Hosts, Azure Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极天蓬都元帅苍天上帝)**,
The **North Pole Tianyou Vice-Marshal, Vermilion Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极天猷副元帅丹天上帝)**,
The **North Pole Yìshèng Preserving Virtue True Lord, Azure Heaven Sovereign Emperor (北极翊圣保德真君昊天上帝)**,
The **North Pole Officials Ranked Beneath the Celestial Gate (北极阙下列班真宰)**,
The **Three Great Marshals of Thunder and Lightning—Deng, Xin, and Zhang (雷霆邓、辛、张三大元帅)**,
The **Two Marshals of the Thunder Gate—Gou and Bi (雷门苟、毕二元帅)**,
The **Two Host Deities of Xuwei (虚危二宿神君)**,
The **Black Tiger Great God Liu Tianjun (黑虎大神刘天君)**,
The **Fufu Deities and the Four Heavenly Lords—Cui, Lu, Deng, and Dou (阜纛神君、崔、庐、邓、窦四天君)**,
The **Four Great Marshals—Ma, Zhao, Guan, and Wen (马、赵、关、温四大元帅)**,
The **City Deities and Temple Spirits (城隍祀典，庙社神祇)**,
The **Three Realms’ Functionaries (三界功曹)**,
The **Oath-Keeping True Officials (证盟真宰)**—
All are summoned by the **True Incense**, universally honored with offerings.

We, the disciples, humbly reflect:
The **Round Canopy’s pure brilliance**—
A refined qi, untainted by smoke;
The **Northern Spirit’s manifest response**—
A harmonious time for celestial descent.

We purify our hearts, uphold the fast’s precepts,
And with reverence, perform the **Courtly Attendance rites**,
Aspiring to invite the **Imperial Dao’s sojourn**,
Exhausting our sincerity, renewing our earnest petitions.
With utmost devotion, we prostrate and take refuge.

**Issue the Edict.**
**Recite the Spell and Sprinkle Purification.**

The **Dao of Heaven** is lofty and distant,
Without sound or scent that can be heard;
The **Divine Response** is profound and unfathomable,
Yet only the **Yin and Yang** remain unmeasured.

Where sincerity is directed, the response is boundless.
Thus, the **Spiritual Officials** are capable of conveying petitions.
We dare to offer the **fragrance of a single incense burner**,
And humbly invite the **Four Celestial Rectifiers’** sacred might.

We hope to be granted **spiritual communion**,
And that **inspection and approval** may soon descend.
Now with this incense, we solemnly summon
The **Year-Rectifier Functionaries**,
The **Month-Rectifier Functionaries**,
The **Day-Rectifier Functionaries**,
And the **Hour-Rectifier Functionaries**,
Only wishing for their descent to receive our humble entreaties.

We, the disciples, reverently acknowledge:
The **Four Celestial Rectifiers** are the most **exalted and supreme** among all directions;
They traverse **ten thousand li** without pause,
Nor do they linger for an instant.

By **jade gates and golden courts**, their commands are transmitted,
And they oversee the **knocking at the threshold**;
With **cloud chariots and wind steeds**, they pass through the capital,
As dense as **journeying through the celestial realms**.

We rely on the **Holy Power’s** swift conveyance,
To reach the **Divine Hearing’s** fourfold expanse.
If our prayers are **precise and clear**,
They shall never face obstruction or delay.

Now, this **Dao Ritual Official** of humble virtue,
From birth endowed with **auspicious connections**,
Has encountered the **True Dao**,
And with **morning and evening incense**, dares not forget the **True Sage’s** boundless grace;
With **seasonal offerings and reverent devotion**, seeks to align with the **Spiritual Officials’** swift descent.

We humbly pray that the **Divine Presence** may descend to inspect,
And that all who dwell in this age may witness
**Auspicious mists ascending to the heavens**,
**Blessed winds and rains upon the earth**,
**Jade scripts unfolding on emerald tablets**,
**Sacred sincerity emanating from crimson hearts**,
To rely on the **preceding entreaties**,
And achieve **harmonious ascent**,
That our prayers and petitions may be **granted and heard**.

**Issue the Edict.**
**The previous edict has been properly sealed and submitted.**
Now, we **unfold the rituals** in the **mortal realm**,
And **dispatch our sincerity** to the **mystic domain**,
Though our deepest contemplations may not reach above,
We **invite the descent** on this **auspicious day**,
Daring to disturb the **Highest Spirit’s** hearing.

We humbly pray that the **Rectifiers** may **convey our words**,
That our **endeavors may succeed**,
Our **petitions be fulfilled**,
Our **exorcisms repel evil**,
Our **actions bear fruit**,
And that this **modest sincerity** may not be in vain.

**Recite the Precepts.**

We reverently acknowledge:
The **True Martial Spirit of the North**—**Lord of Sacred Response**—
Is the **manifest form of the Highest Venerable Lord**,
Associated with the **Sixth Star of the Northern Dipper**, **Mars**,
Who governs **Military Conquest**.

In the North, the **constellations of Xu (虚)** and **Wei (危)** are likened to **serpents**,
And the **stars of Yingshi (营室)** and **Dongbi (东壁)** to **tortoises**.
The **tortoise** bears a shell to **defend itself**,
The **serpent** forms an array with **head and tail both present**,
Thus embodying the **symbol of martial prowess**.
When the **tortoise and serpent unite**, they become the **True Martial Spirit**,
With **Divine Sovereignty**—this is the **True Lord in Heaven**.

He wears the **Azure Jade Crown**,
And robes of **dark hues**,
Together with **Tiānpéng (天蓬)**, **Tiānyòu (天猷)**, and **Yìshèng (翊圣)**,
Known as the **Four Celestial Saints of the Northern Pole**.

Descending to the **human realm**,
He **loosens his hair and goes barefoot**,
Wields a **sword to sever heresy**,
And commands the **Six Ding (六丁)** and **Twelve Jade Maidens (玉女)**,
The **Eight Killing Generals (八杀将军)**,
The **Six Celestial Guardians (六甲直符)**,
The **Twelve Divine Generals (十二神将)**,
Each with **twelve attendants**,
And **clerks bearing talismans**, numbering **one hundred and twenty**,
With **divine soldiers**, **five hundred million strong**,
And the **deities of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain**,
Who always accompany him.

The **True Lord** often descends in **Sichuan**,
As **Sichuan** has the **County of Mysterious Tortoise** (玄武县).
Now, to avoid the **Sacred Ancestor’s** name,
It is renamed **Zhōngwāng (中汪)**.
From the **Han** to the **Sui**, it was under **Chéngdū (成都)**.
In the **third year of Emperor Wǔdé’s reign (武德三年)** of the **Tang**,
It was divided and placed under **Zǐzhōu (梓州)**.
The county boasts the **most sacred traces of the True Lord**,
Leaning against **high mountains**.
The **mountains above and below** all have **temples**,
Facing the **great river**.
The **river’s stones** naturally form the **shape of tortoises and serpents**.

In recent times, there were **no Daoists maintaining the temples**,
So it became the **Golden Immortal Daoist Hall (金仙道场)**,
And the **sacred might** still frequently **manifests**,
Even descending with **divine messages** to **Chéngdū**.
At the **beginning of the Song dynasty’s rise**,
There was a **Li surnamed Jiāohuī (燂灰李)** in **Chéngdū**,
Who established a **single incense burner** to worship the **True Lord’s** sacred fire.
The **True Lord descended** to his household,
And bestowed upon him **five measures of sacred scriptures**,
Which were **passed down through generations**.

There was also **Dù Míng (杜明)**,
Who was **diligent in his reverence**,
And the **True Lord often descended** to speak with **Míng**.

During the **Xiánpíng era (咸平中)**,
**Wáng Jūn rebelled**,
And the **bandit leader sent soldiers** to summon **Míng**.
**Míng went** to see the **rebel commander**,
Yet **unbeknownst to him**, his mouth **uttered the True Lord’s sacred words**.
The **rebel commander ordered him sent back home**.
After some time, **Míng’s family realized he was still at home**,
And the whole household was **overjoyed**.
After the **rebels were pacified**,
**Míng** **exhausted all his wealth** in offerings to the **Three Treasures of Tiānqìngguān (天庆观)**,
Selected a **site to build the foundations**,
Constructed **halls and pavilions**,
And **sculpted the True Lord’s image**,
As well as **portraying the Spiritual Officials and their attendants**,
To **repay the debt** for escaping the **rebel’s calamity**.

On the **Festival of the Upper Element (上元节)**,
When the **halls and pavilions were newly adorned**,
**Crowds of visitors gathered**.
**Dù Míng** had passed away,
And his **brother struck the ritual gong**,
**Arranging the incense and lamps** with utmost reverence.
By night, **scholars and commoners filled the hall**.
His **brother**, at the **silk screen window**,
**Watched the calamitous women**...

The True Lord, in his wrath, caused [his own] eyes to nearly burst.

In the year **Xiángfú (祥符)** the fifth,
He again descended with words:
*"If Tiānpénggē (天蓬哥) arrives, he will be the guest,
And I shall be the host to welcome him."*
Numerous times, the **Highest True Ones (上真)** descended thereafter.

One day, while **Míng** was paying homage with incense and fire,
The True Lord descended with words, commanding him to summon **Daozhèng Míng**,
the **Master Jìng of Chán (寒道冲)**, saying:
*"I have descended here for several years.
Later, I shall descend in the **Eastern Capital (东都)** to safeguard the **imperial lineage (帝祚)**,
And you must not abandon your earlier resolve."*
From that time onward, he no longer heard the True Lord’s voice,
Until ten years later, when the **tortoise and serpent (龟蛇)** appeared at the **Holy Water Temple (圣水观)** in the capital,
As if confirming the prophecy.

In the late **Chóngníng (崇宁)** period,
**Jìtáng (纪堂)** of **Chéngdū (成都)** excelled in both **martial prowess (力学)** and **literary skill (能文)**.
The **Língshòu Temple (圣寿寺)**’s **Liú family (刘氏)** ordered their descendants to follow him in study.
The True Lord descended with words:
*"Jìtáng is unfilial to his stepmother,
And the **Celestial Register (天曹)** no longer accepts his name.
Later, he will achieve nothing—
He will die in exile at the **medicine stall (药水铺)**."*

At the beginning of **Jìngkāng (靖康)**,
When the capital fell,
The True Lord again descended in **Chéngdū**.

**Yáng Guǎng (扬广)**, a **Cháoqǐng Láng (朝请郎)**,
Due to **malicious influence (祟害)** harming his daughter,
Came to the **Yùjú Observatory (玉局观)**,
And established a **Four Saints Ritual (四圣醮)**.
The True Lord descended upon the seat,
And the entire observatory was struck with awe—
The True Lord dispelled the **malicious influence** for him.

Then, when he inquired about the **ancestral deeds (祖先以来事)** of the **ritual officers (斋官)** and others,
The True Lord **witnessed them with his own eyes (目击)**.

He also requested the **Jiāngshān Spirit King (江读神王)**,
Who arrived in response at once.

The **Earthly Officials (地司主者)** tremble in fear below the steps and obey your command.

In the **Jiànníng (建炎)** era,
At the **Cháo Dū (广都)** nest observatory,
He dreamed that the **True Lord (真君)** sent someone to summon him,
His heart filled with great dread.

Upon arrival, the **True Lord descended the steps (降阶)** to greet him,
With a **divine countenance (圣颜)** warm and gentle,
And a **refined voice (玉音)** clear and bright,
Treating him as an honored guest.

Awakening, he thus devoted himself to **establishing the ritual (修醮仪)**,
And his entire household **observed the precepts (奉戒)** with ever greater sincerity and reverence.

The reason for these offerings is that one must not **treat them lightly (轻媟)** from the very beginning of the **ritual foundation (建斋)**.
You should know these precepts—there are seven in total.
All must listen carefully.

The **First Precept (第一戒)** is this:
One must not **place faith in false Dao (邪道)**,
Or **invoke demonic rites (祷祭魔法)** and **beg for extra blessings (谄求余福)**,
Letting oneself fall into **confusion and delusion (昏迷沉乱)**.
One must always **aspire to purity of body and mind (清净身心)**,
And **take refuge in the Great Dao (归依大道)**.

The **Second Precept (第二戒)** is this:
One must not **be disloyal or unfilial (不忠不孝)**,
Or **act unjustly or without compassion (不义不仁)**.
One must always **serve one’s superiors with reverence and diligence (恭勤事上)**,
And **treat others with kindness (慈爱接物)**,
Never forgetting the **Dao’s teachings (道训)**.

The **Third Precept (第三戒)** is this:
One must always **remember one’s ancestors and parents (累世父母)**,
And the **departed relatives (过去亲萝)**,
Who were **wrongfully killed by the Six Heavenly Demons (六天魔鬼)**,
Or **died before their time (未尽天年)**,
Or **were slain by violence (横被伤杀)**.
One must **return to orthodox teaching (归投正教)**,
And **rescue their tormented spirits (拔济幽魂)**,
So that **both the living and the dead (幽明存亡)**,
And **all beings (均)**,
May **share in the blessings (沾利泽)**.

The **Fourth Precept (第四戒)** is this:
On days when the **True Lord descends (真君降日)**,
One must not **include taboo characters (犯讳字)** within **memorial petitions (章奏)**.
Nor must one **offer early prayers for begging (烧奏早钱)**,
Or **burn incense with oil lamps and paper (油灯油纸)**,
For **all offerings must be made with proper reverence (焚热所奏)**.

The **Fifth Precept (第五戒)** is this:
On days when the **True Lord descends (真君降日)**,
One must not **consume pungent meats or flesh (食荤辛杂肉)**,
Nor **black carp (黑鲤鱼)**, **cloud-platform greens (云台菜)**, **barbarian’s wild horse (胡婪马)**, **toothed amaranth (齿苋)**, **garlic (大蒜)**, or **seven-star fish (七星鱼)**.
Nor must one **allow their breath and qi to come near these things (气息相近)**.

The **Sixth Precept (第六戒)** is this:
Women who have not yet reached **fifty years of age (五旬)**,
Must not **be allowed near the divine seat (近神座)**.
Nor must **servants or attendants (童仆)** whose **bodies emit foul qi (气息臭秽)**,
Be permitted to **approach the altar (诣前)**.
One must always **purify oneself (务蠲洁)**,
To **honor the True Lord above (以奉上真)**.

The **Seventh Precept (第七戒)** is this:
When **offering petitions to the True Lord’s spirit (奏对真灵)**,
One must not **face north while spitting or weeping (北向涕唾)**,
Nor **urinate or defile oneself uncleanly (旋溺不洁)**.

The above **seven precepts (七戒)**—can you uphold them?
In unison: *"We can uphold them!"*

The **True Lord (真君)** once **received the Heavenly Sovereign’s Dao (奉天尊教)** to save all.
During the years of **Jia (甲子)** and **Gēngshēn (庚申)**,
And on the **seventh, twenty-first, and twenty-seventh days of each month (每月三七日)**,
He **descends into the mortal realm (下降人间)**,
Accepting **human ritual offerings (醮祭)**,
And **observing their virtues and vices (察人之善恶)**,
As well as **their cultivation and transgressions (修学功过)**,
Determining the **length of their lives (年命长短)**.

All who follow the **ritual procedures (依科行道)**,
Must **obey these seven precepts (奉此七戒)**,
To **discipline body and mind (检饬身心)**,
And **avoid inviting retribution (无招罪戾)**.
Thus may the **True Lord’s spirit descend graciously (真灵降格)**,
And **accept our sincere devotion (歆纳勤诚)**,
While **demonic forces are subdued (魔精消伏)**,
And **all inauspiciousness is extinguished (断灭不祥)**.
May the **departed be liberated (过去超生)****,
And the **living attain blessings (见存获庆)**,
So that **all beings may dwell in peace (生人安泰)**,
And the **land remain tranquil (国土清平)**.

All must **clearly understand (明知)** these precepts,
And **never forget them (无忘于心)**,
Obeying them **as prescribed (奉戒如法)**.

Now **recite the ritual ranks (称法位)**.

The **officiating ministers (具位臣某等)**,
With utmost sincerity and reverence,
Prostrate ourselves and **invoke the Supreme Dao of the Boundless (太上无极大道)**,
And the **Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures (三十六部尊经)**,
The **Great Master of the Mystic Center (玄中大法师)**,
The **Spiritual Treasure Chief Preceptor (灵宝主教)**,
The **Five Masters, True Lords (五师真君)**,
The **Three Heavenly Venerable Teachers (三天圣师)**,
The **Supreme Sage of Great Mystery (泰玄上相真君)**,
And the **Celestial Attendants of the Jade Hall (玉堂演教侍宸仙众)**,
As well as **all True Lords of the Three Realms and Ten Directions (三界十方一切真宰)**,
All **rely on the true incense (悉仗真香)**,
And **offer universal reverence and support (普同供养)**.

The **intent is declared (宣意)** and the **matter is sincere (事悃)**—already declared.
The **divine ears are clear and listen (圣聪昭听)**.

We further **reflect on our own inadequacies (谬以凡庸)**,
And **dare to oversee the Dao’s teachings (辄司科教)**,
Fearful that our **bodies may not be pure enough (检身之弗类)**,
And **dread incurring the True Lord’s wrath (获戾于上真)**.
Thus we **request the full assembly (会请备员)**,
And **do not dare to decline our duties (不容逊职)**,
To **purge accumulated impurities (蠲洗埃氛之累)**,
And **strictly promulgate the Dao’s ordinances (宣行教典之严)**.

We **humbly pray (伏望)** that the **Celestial Master of the Jade Capital (玉京山应供玄中大法师)**,
The **Three Teachers of the Spiritual Treasure (灵宝三师)**,
And the **Supervising Master of the Ritual (监斋大法师)**,
May **descend to the altar (降临坛所)**,
And **graciously bestow their blessings (俯垂佑助)**,
Flowing **true qi (真炁)** into our **bodies (臣等身中)**,
So that we may **successfully complete the ritual (斋事克成)**,
And **all True Lords may come in response (众真来格)**.

We are **overwhelmed by the depth of our supplication (不胜延伫恳祷之至)**,
And **respectfully report this (谨启以闻)**.

**Meritorious Dedication (回向)**.

The Supreme Three Heavens’ Mysterious Primordial *Qi* [无上三天玄元始三炁],
The Supreme Dao Sovereign [太上道君],
The Supreme Great Dao Sovereign [太上大道君],
The Supreme Old Sovereign [太上老君],
The Supreme Jade Sovereign of the Celestial Vault [太上昊天玉皇上帝],

The *Zhenwu* [真武] Auspicious True Lord of the Northern Pole [北极佑圣真武灵应真君],
The Three Realms’ responsive spirits [三界应感],
All true spirits [一切真灵].

I humbly hear that the *Jinguo* [金阙] transformed body,
Emerges from the Jade Palace [玉宫] with courage and might;
The *Qianyuan* [乾元] has its general,
Who surveys the Five Sacred Peaks [五岳] with equal renown.
The myriad True Ones [万真] reverently look to your mighty spirit,
The Six Directions [六合] have no escape from your vigilant inspection.
Thus, we now raise the *Hongting* [彤庭] Great Ritual,
Humbly praying for your arrival beneath the *Zaozhan* [皂纛] banner.

「允升地宝，毖涌神泉。」
May the treasures of the earth ascend,
And the divine springs gush forth in abundance.

「掬清润之云浆，徧愈都人之疾；建琳琅之宝宇，遂成圣水之名。」
Gathering the pure, life-nourishing elixir of the clouds,
To universally cure the maladies of all people;
Constructing a hall adorned with precious treasures,
Thus establishing the fame of the Sacred Spring.

「加以徽称，昭其懿实，普及寰瀛之内，咸知变化之神。」
With honors bestowed and its virtues illuminated,
Its divine transformations are known throughout the world.

「矧惟靖邦，素彰殊应。」
Especially in this land of peace,
Where its extraordinary responses have long been renowned.

「岂钦承之敢怠，冀孚佑以潜臻。」
How could we dare to neglect its revered blessings,
And hope for its hidden grace to reach us?

「臣职在宣扬，理难缄默，况奉词旨，敢不上闻。」
Our duty lies in proclaiming its glory,
And silence is impossible;
Moreover, having received this divine command,
We dare not fail to report it.

「宣词。」
We now proclaim:

「按如词言，丹诚恳切。」
As the words have been spoken with sincere devotion,
Our hearts are deeply earnest.

「臣等谨为沐浴五体，澄炼六情，依崇真谢圣之科，祈注禄延祥之泽，施坛列纂，法地象天，所赍镇信供养之具，证质丹诚。」
We humbly purify our five senses with ritual ablutions,
And clarify our six emotions through solemn discipline;
Following the established rites of the *Zhenxie* [真谢] Saints,
We pray for the blessings of longevity and auspiciousness to descend;
Setting up the ritual platform in proper order,
The sacred ground mirroring the heavens,
We offer the *Zhenxin* [镇信] supplies of devotion,
To attest our sincere and earnest hearts.

「以今日今时启坛，依仪行道，至某日某时，关奏上真，请福延生，祈恩谢过，辄依斋法，宿、先以启闻。」
On this very day and hour, we commence the ritual platform,
Conducting the rites in strict accordance;
Until a certain day and time,
We shall present our offerings to the *Shangzhen* [上真],
Praying for blessings and extended life,
Seeking grace and expressing gratitude,
Then proceed according to the fast regulations,
And notify the *Su* [宿] and *Xian* [先] in advance.

「恩惟太上三清，十方大圣，垂神鉴映，省览所陈。」
We beseech the *Taishang* [太上] Three *Qing* [清],
And the Great Saints of the Ten Directions,
To descend and witness our divine offerings,
And graciously review our humble petitions.

「乞敕勒灵宝官属，土地真官，一合同心，并力营卫，扫荡内外，清净坛场，降伏妖魔，馘灭邪祟。」
We pray that the *Lingbao* [灵宝] officials and the *Zhen* [真] officers of the lands,
With united hearts and combined efforts,
Guard and protect this sacred space,
Cleansing and purifying the ritual grounds within and without;
Subduing and vanquishing malevolent spirits and demons,
And utterly annihilating all evil influences.

「使臣等心安神定，思念立感，启奏御达，善功成就，无有窒滞，所愿随心。」
May this enable us to remain at peace in mind and spirit,
Our thoughts and prayers instantly answered;
May our petitions reach the divine ear,
Our righteous deeds accomplished without hindrance,
And all our wishes fulfilled as we desire.

「臣等虽佩正真，参修大法，处身五浊，染迹六尘，三关未调，六情放诞，先凭禁戒，然后登坛，格降上真，导迎灵贬。」
Though we bear the *Zhengzhen* [正真] badge,
And practice the *Dafa* [大法] of the Great Dao,
Our bodies dwell amidst the Five Turbidities [五浊],
And our traces are stained by the Six Dusts [六尘];
The Three Passes [三关] remain unrefined,
And our Six Emotions [六情] are undisciplined—
We first rely on prohibitions and precepts,
Then ascend the ritual platform,
To invite the *Shangzhen* [上真] to descend,
And guide the sacred spirits to our presence.

「上明天尊大慈之泽，下副臣等归向之诚，谨启以闻。」
Above, we illuminate the *Tianzun* [天尊]'s boundless compassion,
Below, we align with our own sincere devotion—
We humbly report this to the heavens.

「十二愿。」
The Twelve Wishes:

「复炉。」
Reigniting the Incense:

「谨摄香官使者、左右龙虎君、侍香诸灵官，当令臣向来静夜行道之所，自然生金液丹碧，芝英百灵，众真交会，在此香火炉前。」
We solemnly gather the *Xiangguan* [香官] messengers,
The *Longhu* [龙虎] Lords of left and right,
And the *Shixiang* [侍香] spirits of incense attendance;
On the nights of our ritual practice,
May golden elixirs and emerald nectars spontaneously arise,
Along with herbs and sacred plants of myriad virtues,
And all the True Ones convene before this incense burner.

「当愿十方仙童玉女，接侍兰烟，传臣向来所启之诚，速达径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前。」
We wish that the celestial youths and maidens of the Ten Directions,
Attending to the fragrant incense,
May swiftly convey our sincere petitions
Directly to the *Zhen* [至真] *Wujing* [无极] Great Dao,
And to the *Hao Tian* [昊天] *Yuhuang* [玉皇] Emperor of Heaven.

「出堂颂。」
Departing the Hall, we chant:

「出户。」
Exiting the Door.

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Precepts, Volume 64 completed, Volume 65 begins: The Three Caverns Scripture and Ritual for the Disciple Zhong Li’s Cultivation of the *Zhenwu* [真武] *Lingying* [灵应] Great Expiation Rite**

**Morning of the Pure Day: Ritual Practice**
The ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master, focusing their spirit as taught.
The sacred incantations of protection are proclaimed:
The *Qingyang* [青阳] *Xuming* [虚映] shines forth, illuminating the sun’s return to life.
The *Shentian* [神虎] *Pixie* [辟邪] dispels malevolence, while the *Feitian* [飞天] *Liuqing* [流铃] soars, scattering celestial bells.
The *Cuijian* [摧奸] *Miexiong* [灭凶] crushes deceit and extinguishes ferocity—ten thousand demons bound in form.
The *Jiuwei* [九微] *Huidao* [回道] and *Baxia* [八威] *Shejing* [摄精] restore the Dao’s subtle currents and gather the vital essences.
A thousand True Ones oversee the records, while the Three *Yuan* [元] dispel impurities.
The left *Zhao* [啸] resounds through the *Zhonghuang* [中黄], and the right *Ce* [策] invokes the Six *Ding* [丁].
Seven circuits, eight harmonies—revolving through the *Tianjing* [天经] of the Dao.
The sacred transformation stands majestic, and the Great Dao takes form.
The *Qingyun* [庆云] flows in abundance, merging with the *Hueting* [黄庭] radiance—united in Dao and True essence.
The *Fagu* [法鼓] is struck twenty-four times.

The *Wushang* [无上] Three Heavens’ *Xuan Yuan* [玄元] *Shi* [始] *Sanqi* [三炁],
The *Taishang* [太上] Dao *Jun* [君],
The *Taishang* [太上] Lao *Jun* [君],
And the *Hao Tian* [昊天] *Yuhuang* [玉皇] Emperor of Heaven,
Summon forth from my body the Three *Wu* [五] *Gongcao* [功曹],
The left and right officials and messengers,
The left and right incense-bearers,
The *Yilong* [驿龙] couriers and mounted officers,
The golden youths and jade maidens of incense attendance,
The maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers,
The Five *Di* [帝]’s straight seals,
The *Zhiri* [直日] incense officials,
And the thirty-six in total, arrayed in procession.

**Procession Departure**
Those who depart must wear solemn attire and fine robes,
Their caps and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons,
Opening the *Xuan Tan* [玄坛] to the land spirits and domain deities.
I now, on this morning of the Pure Day, conduct the ritual,
And solemnly present this as my proclamation of intent.
My heartfelt petitions have been recorded and heard—
I wish to receive the *Taishang* [太上] Ten Directions’ *Zhidao* [至真] Dao *Qi* [炁],
The *Lingbao* [灵宝] radiance and auspicious light descending,
Flowing into my own body,
So that my words may swiftly reach and directly govern
The *Taishang* [太上] *Wujing* [无极] Great Dao,
And the *Hao Tian* [昊天] *Yuhuang* [玉皇] Emperor of Heaven.

**Invocation of the Sacred Assembly**
I, [Disciple’s Name], along with the assembled officials of the platform,
Solemnly present our united sincerity:
To the *Taishang* [太上] *Wujing* [无极] Great Dao,
The *Yuan Shi* [元始] Heavenly Venerable,
The *Taishang* [太上] Great Dao *Jun* [君],
The *Taishang* [太上] Lao *Jun* [君],
The *Taishang* [太上] *Hao Tian* [昊天] *Yuhuang* [玉皇] Emperor of Heaven,
The Nine *Huang* [皇] Venerables,
The Ten Directions’ *Wujing* [无极],
The *Taishang* [太上] *Lingbao* [灵宝] Heavenly Venerable,
The *Yidao* [已道] Great Saints,
The myriad *Zhidao* [至真] and all Noble Ones,
The thirty-six divisions of sacred scriptures and profound *Zhong* [中] *Dafa* [大法],
The *Beiji* [北极] *Yousheng* [佑圣] *Zhenwu* [真武] *Lingying* [灵应] True *Jun* [君],
The responsive deities of the Three Realms,
And all True spirits.

I have heard that yin and yang alternate in succession,
And that the north alone bears the *Taiyin* [太阴] Dao *Qi* [炁];
That water and fire wax and wane in their own vigor,
Yet only the True *Jun* [君] embodies the essence of water’s position.
He governs the *Kan* [坎] officials of administration,
Assists the *Chenji* [宸极] in cosmic functions,
And completes the beginning and end of all things—
Overseeing the unfolding and contraction of transformative forces.
He aids the Emperor of Heaven in his *Taojin* [陶钧] crafting,
And encompasses the vital mechanisms of all spirits.

Sometimes he soars within the vast heavens,
Sometimes he lingers in the Five *Qi* [炁] realms,
His banner raised as the seas and mountains tremble,
His sword *Qi* [炁] surging as clouds and thunder resound.
The *Qin* [祆] mists are swept away by lightning,
His commands carried forth by the wind’s swift flight.
All who turn to him in reverence
Shall receive his manifest blessings.

I have purified the *Dantan* [坛度] platform,
And await the wind’s final descent.
With earnest devotion, I humbly receive his grace,
And stand in awe of the spirit’s transformative power.

Having received the sacred words,
How dare I not present them above?
**Proclamation of Words**
The words are carefully examined,
Their sincerity clearly seen.
Without relying on his luminous might,
How could I attain the *Jian* [戬] *Gu* [谷]?
I pray to be offered the *Pingfan* [苹蘩]’s sacred guidance,
So that I may follow Heaven and Earth’s benevolent will.

From the layered heavens, his auspicious *Qi* [炁] descends,
A shower of *De* [德] *Zi* [泽];
Through all the realms, his spirit winds fan forth,
Broadly spreading waves of mercy.
No spirit shall dare to offend,
Nor shall any ghost accuse!

At this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these first three strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Palace of Supreme Clarity, nourishing the manifested body of the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Golden Gate Lord Lao, and the Three Pure Ones, the Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty.

I humbly pray that the Great Dao may descend its benevolence in splendor, crowning the ranks of the Perfected with its auspicious grace, so that frontier beacons may shine brightly, blades may fall silent, and in court there be no ministers who deceive the sovereign or betray the state, while throughout the lands officials may govern with love for the people and loyalty to the realm. May there be no more bandits or rebellions, and may all enjoy the peace of *Shengping*.

Now, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.

At this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these next two strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Northern Pole Bureau of Eternal Rites, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage’s subordinate, the Star Lord of the Martial Chord, and the assembly of the Northern Pole Saints.

I humbly pray that you manifest your wondrous responses to spread far and wide, shining your sacred radiance afar, so that the officiant, this humble one’s ninth-generation ancestor seven generations back, may not be delayed at the nether gates. May my living father, now departed, be freed from all guilt. May the burdens of past-life enmity be severed, and the cries of ancestral lawsuits in the underworld be silenced. May the spirits of malevolent demons be bound, and the ghosts of the Six Peaks be beheaded. May the vast *Hongfan* qi be restored, and this people be eternally protected.

Now, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Great Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.

At this pure dawn of the Dao’s practice, I respectfully invite the assembly of the Law to take these final three strands of incense and offer them upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the Divine Seat, nourishing the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage.

I humbly pray that you embody the Golden Gate’s resplendent might, serving as the primordial minister of the Jade Capital, patrolling with decisive authority, cutting off all inauspicious omens, so that the officiant, this humble one of the *Kan* mansion, may be freed from perilous calamities and endowed with the enlightened nature of Water’s virtue. May he, who has long studied the Cloud Research Scriptures with profound mastery and unmatched eloquence, swiftly ascend to the honors of officialdom, then stride upon the lofty path of prosperity. May he who lacks such study possess a firm Daoist root and a keen, luminous nature, so that in all his comings and goings, no external evils may cling to him, and in his rest and nourishment, no temporal illnesses may afflict him. May disasters melt away like ice, and blessings grow ever longer as the sun. May he who holds office flourish in his career, distinguished by his lofty virtue, swiftly receiving the honor of promotion to perilous posts, ascending to the favor of the exalted, so that the seas may look to his statesmanship and all officials may revere his weighty bearing.

Now, having offered this incense, I take refuge in the Virtue of the Teacher-Sage, the Perfected Assembly of the Most True. After attaining the Dao, I shall ascend to the Formless and harmonize with the True and the Way.

With renewed reverence, the humble official, this one, along with the assembled officiants, sincerely presents this petition to the Supreme Without Extremes, the Primordial Heavenly Venerable, the Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Highest Sovereignty, the Nine Sovereigns, the Ten Directions Without Extremes, the Supreme Spirit-Treasury Heavenly Venerable, the Perfected Saints who have attained the Dao, the Assembly of the Most True, all Revered Lords and Masters, the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures and the Mystic Great Master of the Central Dao, the Northern Pole Auxiliary Saint, the Venerable and Responsive True Martial Sage, the Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits, and all True Essences.

I have heard that the mist of the Immortals drifts through the layered stages, granting those of worthy virtue the chariot of timely ascent; that the sacred grounds are opened with pure offerings, where the solemn rites are arranged in strict order. I have exhausted my humble devotion, relying on the divine presence to scrutinize me.

Yet, reflecting deeply, this humble officiant’s grasp of the Dao is shallow, his birth fraught with hardship, and he has recklessly burdened the workings of Transformation without benefiting the enlightened age. Navigating the world’s paths, he has endured countless perils, his name obscured by dust. He has always feared becoming one who toils diligently at the start but grows slack at the end, or who walks the world with many faults and few merits, or whose lifespan is not long, or whose foundation is not deep.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when the Supreme One expounds the Scriptures, and on the third day of the third month, when the Venerable Sage descends, my rites of offering have been deficient, and I have truly fallen into dread. In the years *Jiazi* and *Gengshen*, my prayers were sparse; to the Seven Elements and Four Saints, my reverence was delayed. I have dwelled in filth as my norm, partaken of meat and spice without restraint, approached the dying and the dead, and followed worldly customs, observing evil winds. Some have sought fleeting honors, indulging recklessly and bringing ruin upon their ancestors; others, relying on a single family’s wealth, have grown arrogant and licentious, incurring guilt before the underworld officials. There have been those who, without law, coveted wealth, or who, violating the Dao, sought advancement through improper means.

All these transgressions I now abandon, hoping to restore the divine favor. I humbly pray that you condescend to examine my sincerity, broadly extending the shelter of the Dao, so that this officiant’s household may flourish, with blessings and longevity ever increasing, his descendants multiplying and thriving, his spouse and he aging together in harmony, his granaries ever full and his gold and silk ever abundant. May he forever dispel unforeseen disasters and eternally preserve boundless life.

This disciple, this humble official, reflects once more: righteousness and heresy cannot coexist, and good and evil cannot walk together. Because the teachings of virtue have declined in the age, the ghosts of night have grown rampant. Those who revere the Dao are few, while those who believe in heresy are many. Due to the greed of the common folk, desiring sudden wealth for their households, they fawn upon wasteful spirits, plundering their neighbors, gorging on blood in their starving bellies, and displaying monstrous transformations in the night. Some hurl tiles and stones from emptiness, while others, taking advantage of the dark, steal wealth. Some mock the spirits of the dead, and often the deceitful nature of ghosts is exposed.

This disciple, this humble official, further reflects: some harm the young and innocent, while at times they manifest as terrifying seizures and convulsions. Others blow upon the mouth to create sounds and call out people’s names, or knock upon doors and pound on gates to disturb their dwellings. Some scatter filth in chaotic disorder, while others linger around food trays, feasting without restraint. Some send false dreams in sleep to deceive, or summon the departed to wreak havok. Others display wealth to win favor, or set fires to cause alarm.

Indeed, these most vile **Xie Dao** (邪道) heresies thrive in the mortal world. Without fail, I shall uncover all secrets, and I pray to ride upon the **Liuhuo Bell** (流火之铃) to strike. No crime shall go unpunished, and I shall spare no retribution, even if it be as vast as the **Great Heaven’s** (巨天) execution.

I shall carry out the **Taishang’s** (太上) command and uphold the **Zhenjun’s** (真君) authority. Let no land dare to withhold its offerings—first, I shall dispatch the **Yin soldiers** (阴兵) to slay and behead.

I shall cut off the hundred heresies’ (百邪) rampant harm and deliver all beings to safety and peace. With the **Magu** (魔精) spirits extinguished and the **Huosi** (火死) flames reduced to ash, disasters shall vanish like clouds dispersing and mists scattering.

May all hearts reverently pray, and may this humble offering be their refuge. Above, I honor the **Heavenly Sovereign’s** (天尊) boundless compassionate grace; below, I align with my officials’ sincere devotion. I respectfully submit this petition.

**The Twelve Vows** (十二願).
**Reverently Rekindle the Furnace** (复炉).
Respectfully, I command the **Fragrant Officials and Messengers** (香官使者), the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Generals** (左右龍虎君), and the **Attendant Spirits of Incense** (侍香諸靈官): they shall cause this humble official’s offerings, made at the dawn of each clear day, to spontaneously produce **Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** (金液丹碧), **Herbs and Spirits of a Hundred Kinds** (芝英百靈), and gather all the **Perfected Ones** (衆真) at this furnace of incense.

May the **Ten Directions’ Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens** (十方仙童玉女) attend to the fragrant vapors and swiftly convey this humble official’s petition to the **Supreme Ultimate Great Dao’s** (無極大道) and the **Celestial Jade Emperor’s** (昊天玉皇上帝) presence.

**Exit the Hall and Proclaim** (出堂頌).
**Exit the Door** (出戸).

**The Grand Ritual of True Martial’s Responsive Virtue (真武灵应大醮仪)**

**At the Hour of Wu (临午行道):**
The ritual ascends the platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.
The **Sacred Guards’ Incantations** (卫灵咒) are proclaimed:

**To the Northern Void, the Dark and Mysterious Lord (玄天杳杳神君):**
With myriad transformations, the **Mysterious Tortoise’s Perfected Spirit** (玄武灵真) unfurls—
Ascending the heavens, overturning the earth, driving thunder and dispersing clouds.
With legions numbering ten thousand, sweeping away the miasma of demons.
**Thunder Lords** attend, **Jade Maidens** command—
Ghosts and spirits cower, dragons and tigers flee in haste.
The Five Peaks tremble, all spirits obey.
The **Celestial Bell and War Drum** resound, traversing heaven and earth.
Hunting rogue ghosts, shattering demonic souls,
Expelling evil and aiding the righteous—
The **Dao-qi** ever ascends, harmonizing with the True.
**The Law-Drum is struck twenty-four times.**

**The Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin-qi (三炁),**
The **Most High Dao Lord (太上道君),**
The **Most High Laozi (太上老君),**
Summon forth from within this humble servant:
The **Three Five Functionaries (三五功曹),**
The **Left and Right Officials and Messengers (左右官使者),**
The **Left and Right Incense-Bearers (左右捧香),**
The **Relay Dragon Cavalry Clerks (驿龙骑吏),**
The **Attendant Golden Boys (侍香金童),**
The **Speech-Bearing, Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens (传言散花玉女),**
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans (五帝直符),**
The **Direct-Day Incense Officials (直日香官)—**
A total of **Thirty-Six** emerge.

Those who depart are adorned in solemn, radiant attire,
Their headgear and sashes trailing ribbons.
They open the **Void Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits (玄坛土地),**
The **Territorial Deities and Perfected Ones (方域神真).**

At this hour of Wu, as the ritual commences,
This humble servant respectfully petitions to declare intent:
With sincerity unshaken, already recorded and reported,
May the **Most High’s Ten Directions’ Perfected Dao-qi (十方至真道炁),**
The **Sacred Treasure’s Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光),**
Descend and flow into this humble servant’s body,
That what is petitioned may swiftly reach the presence of
The **Most High’s Supreme Ultimate Dao (無極大道)**
And the **Celestial Jade Emperor (昊天玉皇上帝).**

**The Law-Position is invoked.**
This humble servant of such-and-such rank, together with the assembled officials,
Solemnly and sincerely petition above:
To the **Most High’s Supreme Ultimate Dao (無極大道),**
The **Primordial Heavenly Venerable (元始天尊),**
The **Most High Dao Lord (太上大道君),**
The **Most High Laozi (太上老君),**
The **Most High Celestial Jade Emperor (太上昊天玉皇上帝),**
The **Nine Sovereigns Most Exalted (九皇上尊),**
The **Ten Directions’ Supreme Ultimate (十方無極),**
The **Most High Sacred Treasure Heavenly Venerable (太上灵宝天尊),**
The **Already Dao-Realized Great Saints (已得道大圣),**
The **All-Perfected Spirits (衆至真),**
The **All Noble Lords (諸君丈人),**
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Scripture Masters of the Mysterious Middle (三十六部尊经玄中大法师),**
The **North Pole’s Auxiliary Saint, True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord (北极佑圣真武灵应真君),**
The **Three Realms’ Responsive Spirits (三界应感),**
And **All True Spirits (一切真灵).**

This humble servant has heard:
That which sustains life and origins,
All things derive from the **Two Principles (二仪).**
With **righteousness and wisdom (有义有知),**
Humans are the most enlightened of all creatures.
The **Nine Heavens unite in virtue (九天合德),**
The **Three Caverns manifest form (三洞化形).**
The **Three Myriad Six Thousand spirits** all come to guard and assist,
The **Three Hundred Sixty bones and joints** are all harmoniously connected.

Yet, through **obstinate delusion and false paths**, the True is obscured;
Through **deep-rooted malevolence**, goodness is blotted out.
When the **cycles of yin and yang are exhausted,**
And the **eons of great and small calamities conclude,**
Demons proliferate, cutting short humanity’s allotted span;
Seeking false blessings, all fall into **perverted, foolish ignorance.**
They do not reflect upon their **original nature**—
Following **evil paths**, they suffer **confusion and chaos,**
Lacking **loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness.**
Though not yet their destined time of death,
They are struck down by the **Six Heavens’ injuries and killings;**
Sudden loss of life brings forth **the grievances of the multitudes.**
The young and old do not fulfill their natural years,
Their souls drift, bereft in the mortal realm.
Thus, the **impure qi** swirls in tangled knots,
While the **True One’s form** finds no refuge.

To alleviate the **lower realm’s suffering and distress,**
We rely upon the **True Martial’s Divine Lord (真武神君).**
Severing demonic essences, rescuing lost souls,
We wield the **Compassionate Sovereign’s might,**
Commanding **ten thousand armies,**
To slay demons and exterminate evil—
Thus the **Four Quarters are purified,**
The **Three Lights shine pristine,**
The **True Law flourishes,**
The **Evil qi dissipates,**
Restoring **peace to the world,**
Dissolving the **people’s doubts,**
Bringing **eternal tranquility to all nations,**
Silencing the **Nine Abysses’ accusations.**
The **Divine Function’s grace** extends,
Reliance upon it spans **ten thousand eons.**

The **Ritual Disciple**, though unworthy, has long partaken of the **True Shade (真荫),**
Yet dwells in the dusty world.
Ever contemplating **auspicious deeds of virtue,**
Dedicated to the **rites of the True.**
As a humble grass-and-thatch mortal,
Only harboring **loyal devotion;**
As a fleeting ant’s life,
Ever grateful for **the river’s flow of grace.**
Drowned in the years of neglect,
Unable to repay this light—
Thus, at this **auspicious hour of the Holy Dew’s birth (诞圣涓吉辰),**
A **Ritual of Welcoming Auspiciousness (迎祥之醮)** is specially established.
With **Daoist companions**, we humbly thank the **Northern Spirit (北灵),**
Revering the **Supreme Symbol’s Exalted One (上象之尊),**
Daring not to neglect the **Square Enclosure’s petition (方函之奏).**
Though the **sincere words may follow ancient forms,**
The **divine principles defy full comprehension—**
Our **devout supplications** arise from **precise intent.**
May the **whirlwind’s swift passage** pause,
And the **Heavenly Sovereign** look down upon this **crimson sincerity.**
This disciple’s **green petition** shall be duly presented.

**The Petition is Proclaimed:**
As the words declare, the sincerity is profound and devoted.
Gazing back upon the **Five Clouds’ Seat,**
Where **Hundred Harmonies’ smoke ascends,**
The **Heavenly Emperor and Perfected Ones** gather,
As at the **Upper Primordial Hall (上元之殿);**
The **Northern Capital’s Sovereign** leads,
Advancing toward the **Eight Scenic Palaces (八景之宫).**
The **Lofty Pavilion stands solemn in the void,**
The **Celestial Music drifts ethereal in the Azure Void (碧落),**
The **Perfected Ones attend in ranks,**
The **Demons bind their forms in submission—**
How dare we not **exert utmost sincerity,**
**Reverently prostrate in devotion,**
Hoping to receive the **Heavenly Sovereign’s favor,**
That **the family and nation may prosper.**

At this hour of Wu, as the ritual commences,
We request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **first incense-twist,**
That this **incense-smoke may ascend directly to the Pure Clarity Palace (太清宫),**
Offering to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord’s manifested form (真武灵应真君所化之身),**
To the **Golden Threshold’s Laozi (金阙老君),**
To the **Three Pure Ones Most Holy (三清上圣),**
And the **Jade Emperor (玉皇上帝).**

This humble servant **surrenders body, spirit, and fate,**
And with this **incense-twist’s merit,**
We pray for the **Current Emperor’s blessings:**
May his **virtue spread across the Eight Seas,**
His **lifespan equal the Two Principles (二仪).**
Like the **glory of sun and moon,**
Illuminating without end;
May his **boundless virtue encompass heaven and earth,**
Covering all beneath the vault of heaven.

The hundred affairs are in order, the three borders at peace,
A thousand spears laid aside, all bearing children return home.
The year’s bows and hooks are hung away,
Mountain paths open of their own accord.
Ice-silk divine beasts cross the seas to our gates.
All living things move with vitality, all ascend to benevolent longevity.

Now, we burn incense to return and take refuge in the **Dao-Honored Great Saints’ Most Authentic Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the Formless,
Harmonizing with the True and merging with the Way.

With today’s midday ritual, we request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **second incense-twist**,
That this incense-smoke may ascend directly to the **Northern Pole’s Eternal Office (北极太常府)**,
To offer to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord’s subordinate, the Martial Chord Star Lord (武曲星君)**,
And the **Northern Pole’s Sacred Assembly**.
We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
And with this incense-twist’s merit,
We dedicate to the **certain household of the Dao’s transmission**—
Nine generations of divine rites,
A hundred million ancestral spirits,
Freed from endless night, ascending to behold the radiant light.
Shining in the **Court of the Vermilion Dan**,
Ascending to the **Palace of Piercing Brightness**,
With celestial robes gleaming in splendor,
Our names inscribed in the **Immortal Registers**,
Bestowing blessings upon descendants,
Partaking in the **True Celestial Realm**.

Now, we burn incense to return and take refuge in the **Sutra-Honored Great Saints’ Most Authentic Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend into the Formless,
Harmonizing with the True and merging with the Way.

With today’s midday ritual, we request the **Law-Assembled** to kindle the **third incense-twist**,
That this incense-smoke may ascend directly to the **Divine Seat**,
To offer to the **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord**.
We surrender body, spirit, and fate,
And with this incense-twist’s merit,
We dedicate to the **certain household of the Dao’s transmission**—
Six kinships and nine clans,
All relations bound by fate,
All attaining auspicious connections,
Ever under the Dao’s protection,
Secretly dispelling guilt and calamity,
Silently resolving disasters and entanglements,
Debts and lawsuits settled in harmony,
Grudges and enmities reconciled.
Wicked men and malevolent ghosts lack schemes to harm;
Dark omens and black talismans avoid their doomed influence.

The **Divine Seat’s True Martial** bestows protection and auspiciousness in all actions.
With today’s incense-burning, we humbly dedicate ourselves to the **Law-Assembled**’s **True Martial’s Responsive Perfected Lord**—
The **Virtue/Power of the Supreme True**,
Which, after attaining the **Dao/Way**, ascends to the formless, harmonizing with the **Dao/Way’s True Essence**.

We repeat the **Law’s sacred rank** in earnest.
**Official Certain** and the **Assembled Officials of the Ritual Platform**, with sincere devotion, jointly petition:
The **Supreme Way of the Limitless**, the **Heavenly Sovereign of Primordial Beginnings**,
The **Supreme Lord of the Great Dao**, the **Supreme Sage of the Lao**,
The **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heavenly Sovereign**,
The **Nine Sovereigns Above**,
The **Ten Directions of the Limitless**,
The **Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure**,
The **Perfected Saints of the Dao** who have already attained the **Dao/Way**,
The **Assembled True Martial of the Supreme Law**,
All **Responsive Perfected Lords**,
And the **True Spirits of the Three Realms**.

We, the **Officials**, have heard of the **Responsive Perfected Lord’s** miraculous birth and deeds,
And we beseech guidance from the **Wondrous Practices**;
We, the **Officials**, have heard of the **Wicked Qis** stirring up calamities,
And we pray to sever and remove the **Malevolent Spirits** that once relied on the **Responsive Perfected Lord’s** **威神** (awe-inspiring spirit).

In the **endless age**, we fear the **proliferation of disasters**,
As the **host of demons** grows ever more rampant.
They dare to raise **noxious qi**,
Disturbing the **virtuous folk**;
They seek to **purge and cleanse**,
Yet only deepen the **suppressed grief** of the people.

The **Officials** humbly reflect:
Beneath the **urban settlements and suburbs**, the **malevolent spirits** take refuge;
Between the **mountains, rivers, forests, and valleys**, the **precise souls** dwell.
Some cling to **thin groves and sparse clusters**,
Others roam freely in the **sandy shallows**.
With **wind howling and rain shrieking**, they raise **grievous cries** across the **four wilds**;
When **clouds gather and moonlight wanes**, they emit **phosphorescent flames** in the **midnight hours**.
If one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.
Some fall into **ravines and gullies**,
Others meet **blades and axes** at the **sharp edge**.
Some **leap into fire or wade through rivers**, acting in **madness or epilepsy**;
Others **endure bitterness and swallow acidity**, forever haunted by **fear and dread**.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—
Together with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.

The **Officials** further reflect:
In the **realm of ghosts**, the **crafty and domineering** tread upon **palaces and courts** in empty wanderings;
The **malevolent and cunning spirits**, unrestrained, **spread delusion and deceive the living**.
Some **nest in lofty towers and pavilions**,
Others **dwell in mountain forests**.
When **night grows dark**, their **lanterns flicker and flames blaze**;
In **desolate wilderness**, their **reeds and pipes** play in **chaotic return**.
They **spread their foul qi**, secretly **stealing treasures and hoarding wealth**.
They **bring calamity to the people**, demanding **sacrifices of wine and blood**;
They **boast false strength**, able to **snatch the souls of the young and vigorous**.

If one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.
Some **suddenly shift from poverty to wealth**, only to **lose it all again**;
Others **gain fortune, then swiftly perish**.
They **roam without rest**, exploiting the **prayers of the greedy**;
They **assault without cease**, leading to **ruin and decline of the body**.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—
Together with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.

The **Officials** further reflect:
In the **lakes, rivers, and seas**, there are **cryptic dragons, hidden crocodiles, aged turtles, and giant tortoises**,
Whose **spirits** lurk in the depths.
In the **woods, groves, and mountains**, there are **wild boars, long serpents, venomous insects, and fierce beasts**,
Whose **kinds** dwell in the wilds.
They **ride the waves’ dangers**, swiftly **swallowing ships whole**.
They **await the sound of footsteps**, then **harbor poisonous intent**.
Sudden **disasters arise**, and **death comes in an instant**.
If one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.
Some **are crushed beneath the **pine forests and ravines**,
Or **buried in the depths of the fish’s belly**,
Or **consumed by foul qi**, their **bodies swelling with thunderous pain**;
Others **are devoured by ferocious beasts**, their **bodies drained and bones exposed**.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—
Together with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.

The **Officials** further reflect:
In **Sichuan**, they say the **world’s ghostly pits** are here,
In the **southeast**, the **lands of Jing and Min-Yue** teem with **venomous insects and malevolent spirits**.
The **wilds of mountains and forests**, the **fields and villages**,
Are plagued by **malevolent shamans** who **work their tricks**.
They **hurl flying talismans and sprinkle cursed water**,
**Cutting mouths and burning bodies**,
**Pointing at the void with curses**—
And indeed, one **hears of unjust deaths**,
While the **spirit lingers within itself**, only to **be seized and imprisoned**.
They **desire to taste the sacrificial broth**, yet **midday brings harm from blood-sucking demons**;
They **raise their iron rods**, and one **suddenly falls stiff and lifeless**.

If one encounters these **wicked ones**, one’s **true life** will surely be harmed.
Some **whistle all day long**,
Others **remain in a stupor for years**.
Some **fall into madness without cause**, mistaking **empty flowers** for companions;
Others **groan silently in darkness**, struck by **sudden violent illness** and **dying in haste**.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—
Together with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.

The **Officials** further reflect:
From the **graves and mounds**, the **rotting bones** transform into **corpse spirits**,
And from the **cliffs and vast seas**, the **stinking vapors** rise as **misty miasmas**.
They **spread like currents**, or **seep and permeate** through **gradual influence**.

Before the breath has fully parted, signs of rebirth already arise;
When the **spirit** and **qi** grow weary, **illness** of **midlife stagnation** ensues.

Should one encounter these **malevolent forces**, their **true vitality** will surely be harmed.
Some wither like skeletal frames, others collapse as **qi** surges wildly.
Some see their **crown of glory** droop and fall, their blood spilling beyond the **soul’s chamber**;
Others drain their **elixir pool**, their essence overflowing into the **cinnabar field**.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And they **forever cease to prey upon the innocent**—
Together with all **living beings**, we rejoice in this **great aspiration**.

The **Officials** further reflect:
Across the boundless **dusty kalpas**, they drift through the world,
The **wronged spirits** of the dead, their grudges festering behind.
Some bear stolen wealth, others maimed flesh—
Their **karmic curses** bind tightly, their vengeance deep and relentless.
Those who find opportunity will dwell among mortals, appearing as **living kin**;
Those who lurk in shadows will haunt **hidden paths**, becoming **malevolent ghosts**.
They seize the moment to stir strife, wait for the chance to strike in secret.
Should one encounter these **malevolent forces**, their **true vitality** will surely be harmed.
Some suffer lingering **illness**, others face battles with ten thousand armies.
Some groan in sickness upon bed and pillow, with no path to life;
Others lie stiff and lifeless upon streets and crossroads, with nowhere to appeal.

The **Officials** deeply dread that all **living beings of the world** may suffer such torments,
And we earnestly hope the **Perfected Lords** will not betray their **vows**,
But **unfurl their numinous might**,
Driving these **malevolent demons** back to **emptiness and stillness**,
So that **heaven is clear and earth is tranquil**,
And all **sentient beings** may universally attain the **supreme Dao/Way**.

To honor the **Celestial Sovereign’s** vast compassion from above,
And to fulfill the **Officials’** sincerity in submission below,
We humbly present this plea.

**Twelve Vows** completed.
**Incense burner** restored.

We respectfully summon the **Incense Officials** and **messengers of the Dao**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** and all **attendant spirit officials**,
To command them to make my offerings appear at the **Incense burner** where I perform the **Dao/Way** at noon:
There, **golden elixir** and **jade-green essence** will naturally form,
**Herbs of longevity** and **hundreds of spirits** will gather,
And all **Perfected Ones** will assemble before this **Incense burner**.

May the **celestial children** and **jade maidens** of the **Ten Directions** attend,
Conveying the sincerity of my supplications through the **fragrant mists**,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless Extremes**,
Before the **August Heavenly Jade Emperor** in the **Celestial Court**.

**Exit the Hall** and recite.
**Exit the Door**.

**The Complete Daoist Rituals and Regulations, Volume Sixty-Six Complete**
**The Complete Daoist Rituals and Regulations, Volume Sixty-Seven**
*Disciple Zhong Li, studying the Three Caverns Scripture of the Daoist Rituals*
**Ritual of the True Martial Spirit’s Miraculous Response to the Great Expiation**
*Evening Dao/Way Ritual*

The ritual platform is raised as per the prescribed manner.
Each reverently honors the Master, focusing their spirit in accordance with the Dao/Way.

**Recite the Protective Spirit Incantations**:
The Great Yin transforms and gives birth,
The essence of the Water position.
The **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless Extremes** responds above,
The Tortoise and Serpent coalesce in form.

Circumnavigate the Six Extremes,
Dominate the myriad spirits with awe.
No hidden thing escapes scrutiny,
No wish remains unfulfilled.

At the end of the kalpa and its beginning,
Sever and subdue the **demonic essences**.
Rescue and protect all beings,
Ensuring peace for the family and the state.

Should any **minor specters** dare to approach and manifest,
With one glance, the Five Sacred Mountains will crumble—
In harmony with the Dao/Way’s True Martial Spirit.

**Beat the Law Drum twenty-four times**.

The **Supreme Three Heavens**—**Heavenly Primordial Sovereign** of the Three **Qi**,
**Supreme Dao Lord**,
**Supreme Old Lord**—
Summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Officials** of my **Triple Five**,
The **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**,
The **Left and Right Bearers of Incense**,
The **Postal Dragon Cavalry Officers**,
The **Golden Boy Attendants of Incense**,
The **Jade Maiden Messengers of Flowers**,
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**,
The **Direct Day Incense Officials**,
**Thirty-six persons in total**—to emerge.

Those who exit must don **auspicious ceremonial attire**,
Wearing **headdresses and sashes with trailing ribbons**,
Opening the **Mysterious Daoist Altar** to the **Land Spirits** and **Territorial Deities**,
And the **regional spirit officials and Perfected Ones**.

Now, in this quiet evening, as I practice the Dao/Way,
I humbly present this to declare my intent—
All sincerity has been recorded and conveyed.
I pray that the **Supreme Dao’s Ten-Directional Boundless Essences**,
The **Numinous Treasures’ Auspicious Light**,
May descend and flow into my body.
My current supplications,
Swiftly reaching the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes**,
Before the **August Heavenly Jade Emperor** in the **Celestial Court**.

**Request the invocation of the Dao/Way’s station**.

I, **Disciple** [Name], along with the **Thirty-six Officials of the Platform**,
Humbly present our united sincerity:
The **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes**,
**Primordial Sovereign of the True Martial Spirit**,
**Supreme Dao Lord**,
**Supreme Old Lord**,
**Supreme Heavenly Jade Emperor**,
**Nine Sovereigns Above**,
**Ten-Directional Boundless Dao**,
**Supreme Numinous Treasures Sovereign**,
The **Perfected Ones who have attained the Dao**,
The **Supreme True Martial Spirit**,
The **Thirty-six Departments of Sacred Scriptures and Mysterious Daoist Masters**,
The **True Martial Spirit of the Northern Pole**,
The **Responsive Deities of the Three Realms**,
All **Perfect Spirits**.

I have heard that the **Great Ultimate** first divided,
And the **Two Qi** established the hierarchy of **Emperors and Deities**.
The **Primordial Essence** having been apportioned,
The **Five Agents** promulgated the methods of transformation.
Though the rise and fall are endless,
The **Root Source** remains inherently true.
Dwelling in **Kan**, it returns to the **Root and Command**,
In **Gèn**, it aids the **Beginning and End**.

Thus, **Yang** must arise from the **Yin**,
And the **Emperor** first manifests in the **Zhen** position.
Drawing from the **Heaven’s One Supreme Essence**,
It becomes the **foundation for all beings** under the **Auspicious Sun**.

Therefore, my **True Martial Sovereign**,
Resides in the **Northern Gate**,
Embodying the **virtue/power of creation** from Heaven and Earth,
Wielding the **spirit of harmonizing Yin and Yang**.
How could this be without inherent cause?
It is also achieved through deliberate means.

The **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,
Have reverently studied the **Daoist classics**,
Traced the **footprints of the Perfected**,
And in the **Kaihuang** era,
Our land was named **Pure Joy**.
The **Yang Essence** radiates auspiciousness,
Awakening the **extraordinary pregnancy of the Tortoise and Serpent**.
The **White Spirit** bears the **Perfect Roundness**,
Revealing the **exceedingly miraculous birth of the Jade Maiden**.
Descending into the **Purple Hall of Spirits**,
Nurturing the **virtue/power** in the **Green Palace**.

Open and unrestrained,
The **spirit** roams freely in **Heaven’s vast expanse**;
Pure and self-sufficient,
Viewing wealth and nobility as fleeting clouds.

Having completed the **True Martial** practice,
My body ascends to the **Pivot of the Sky**,
Following the **Jade Emperor’s** wondrous teachings,
And pacifying the **remote regions of the Northern Pole**.

The **Child and the Ox** (hours) converge,
Leading all **Palaces** with my singular preeminence;
The **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes** and the **True Martial Spirit** stand as twin supports,
Surrounding and augmenting the **illustrious luminaries**.

Now, as the **Ten Earthly Branches** decline in transformation,
And the **Six Heavens** teem with **demonic forces**,
The **ominous aura** spreads unchecked,
The **killing qi** pervades and corrupts.
It has both **cut short the vitality of living beings**
And **obscured and deceived the Heavenly Observation**.
The cries of the wronged reach the heavens,
The **Heavenly Sovereign’s** compassion responds with pity.
The **miraculous Dao/Way** is invoked and revealed,
The **attendant spirits** hasten to summon.

The **wind** moves, the **thunder** shakes—
The **courageous and mighty** are proclaimed;
The **lightning** sweeps, the **clouds** dissipate—
All **demonic and malevolent** are eradicated.

Thus, all beings are now rescued and protected.
The **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,
Have long basked in your **blessings**,
And humbly heard your **sacred teachings**.
We have engaged in **incense rituals** since the seasons began,
And now, as the **stars align in their proper order**,
We dare to offer our **pure and sincere prayers**,
To repay the **virtue/power of the Auspicious Dao** above,
And to express our **sincere remorse and gratitude** below.
We await your **compassionate acceptance**,
And humbly confess our **earthly defilements**.
Trusting in your **high and boundless vision**,
You will surely descend with **merciful regard**.
Gazing upon us through the **clouds and mists**,
No distance will hinder your arrival—
We earnestly implore with **urgent sincerity**,
Daring not to withhold this offering.

**Recite the Invocation**.

As per the **formal invocation**,
All sincerity is fully displayed.

We humbly invoke the **Sovereign’s virtue/power**, majestic and towering,
Pressing down upon the **near attendants of the Purple Micro**;
The **spirit’s prowess** is swift and keen,
Proclaiming the **Jade Emperor’s** mighty **aura**.

Though you bestow **commandments upon the Northern Pole**,
Your **Heavenly Observations** extend across the **Nine Realms**.
Your **essence** is stored in the **Water virtue/power**,
Your **position** is anchored in the **Stellar Stream**.

Your **movements** are unrestrained,
Responding to human hearts like an echo;
Your **clarity and wisdom** never falter,
Punishing **demonic beings** without fail.

This is where my **vows** are fulfilled,
And the **vast region** relies upon your **blessings**.
Now, the **Ritual Officials**, [Name] and others,
Our hearts incline like **loyal plants**,
Our offerings are inscribed in **auspicious writings**—
The **incense** emits **fragrant vapors**,
The **lamps** align with the **stars** in radiance.
The **phoenix wax** releases the **spring’s splendor**,
The **snowflake buds** generate the **wind of rain**.

Ascending to the **clouds and mists**,
We are borne aloft by the **wind-horse**;
Illuminating the **palaces and treasuries**,
We are also conveyed by the **golden coins**.

Reciting the **Secret Edicts** beneath the **Pure Sky**,
Inviting the **True Ones** to gather at the **humble seat**.

With this **quiet night** of **Dao practice**,
We, the **Law Assembly**, now light the **first incense strand**,
Wishing this **fragrant smoke** to ascend the heavens,
To **offer** to the **Three Pure Ones**, the **Supreme Saints**,
The **August Sovereign of the **Boundless Sky**,
And the **True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**.

We, the **subjects**, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
And with this **meritorious act of incense-offering**,
We **pray for** the **current Emperor**.

May we humbly wish:
That the **Two Principles** remain steadfast,
The **Three Lights** shine in harmony,
That **benevolence** match **Emperor Yao and Tang**,
And **transformations** surpass **Xī and Hòu**.

May the **consorts and princes**, the **heir and nobles**,
Receive **virtue’s praise** in the **Purple Court**,
And **merit** uphold the **Royal Polarity**.

May the **ministers and officials**, both **inner and outer**,
Spread **abundant grace without favoritism**,
And achieve **harmony and prosperity** to **cultivate the Way**.

May **weapons** forever be **sheathed**,
Floods and droughts **never arise**,
Plagues and poisons **be extinguished**,
And **demonic influences** **withdraw**.

Now, with this **incense-burning**,
We **surrender** to the **Dao’s Supreme Saints**, the **Great Saints**, the **Most True Assembly**.

After attaining the **Dao**,
We **ascend to the Formless**,
And **harmonize** with the **True Dao**.

With this **quiet night** of **Dao practice**,
We, the **Law Assembly**, now light the **second incense strand**,
Wishing this **fragrant smoke** to ascend directly,
To **offer** to the **True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**,
And his **attendant Star Lord of the Martial Chord**,
And all **saints of the Northern Dipper**.

We, the **subjects**, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
And with this **meritorious act of incense-offering**,
We **return** to **reverence the Dao** in the **Certain House**,
For **nine generations and seven mystic lineages**,
To **ascend the soul** in the **Dark Night**,
To **refine the spirit** in the **Crimson Palace**,
To **bathe in the flowing fire** and **attain the True**,
To **be inscribed in the Jade Registers** and **verify rank**,
To **hang blessings** and **receive auspicious fortune**,
And to **see living benefits**.

Now, with this **incense-burning**,
We **surrender** to the **Scripture’s Supreme Saints**, the **Great Saints**, the **Most True Assembly**.

After attaining the **Dao**,
We **ascend to the Formless**,
And **harmonize** with the **True Dao**.

With this **quiet night** of **Dao practice**,
We, the **Law Assembly**, now light the **third incense strand**,
Wishing this **fragrant smoke** to ascend the heavens,
To **offer** to the **True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**,
And the **Three Realms’ Responsive Ones**, all **mighty and numinous spirits**.

We, the **subjects**, **surrender body, spirit, and fate**,
And with this **meritorious act of incense-offering**,
We **return** to **reverence the Dao** for **Certain and others**,
To **reward the virtuous** with **auspicious influences**,
And to **receive divine praise and assistance**.

May the **Five Phases and Three Fates**
Never bring **calamitous punishments**;
May **past debts and grievances**
All **align with peace and joy**.

May **lifespans expand**,
And **guilt be cleansed**.

Now, with this **incense-burning**,
We **surrender** to the **Teacher’s Supreme Saints**, the **Great Saints**, the **Most True Assembly**.

After attaining the **Dao**,
We **ascend to the Formless**,
And **harmonize** with the **True Dao**.

We **reaffirm our Lawful Station**.

We, **Certain**, the **officer of this rank**, along with the **congregated officials of the altar**,
Solemnly and sincerely **petition above**:
To the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless Extremes**, the **Primordial Heavenly Sovereign**,
The **Supreme Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Old Lord**,
The **Supreme Jade Emperor of the Boundless Sky**,
The **Nine Sovereigns of High Rank**,
The **Ten Directions of the Boundless**,
The **Supreme Spirit Treasure Heavenly Sovereign**,
The **Already Dao-Attained Great Saints**,
The **Most True Assembly**,
All **Honored Lords and Masters**,
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Sacred Scriptures**, the **Great Lawmasters of the Mystic Middle**,
The **Aid-Spirit True Martial Lord of the Northern Dipper**, the **Responsive True One**,
The **Three Realms’ Responsive Ones**, all **true spirits**.

We have heard:
That the **proud, extravagant, and licentious**
Are **close to evil**;
That the **upright, serene, and reverent**
Are **beloved by the spirits**.

「Though the **Most True Assembly** may be unfathomable,
This principle is **inevitably so**.

In reverence of the **Holy Dao**, though vast, the **upright** align with it.
If one seeks to dwell beneath the **Dao’s shelter and aid**,
One must first **purify** from accumulated **sins and errors**.

We look up to the **Great Mercy** above,
And below, we manifest the **Sincere Devotion**.

In humility, we confess:
That beings like us, bound by the **dusty world’s entanglements**,
Ensnared by the **worldly net**,
Assailed by the **Six External Demons**,
And deceived by the **Three Internal Emptinesses**,
Have, in the years **Gengshen-Jiazzi** (庚申甲子),
Failed to fulfill our **meritorious deeds**;
In the four seasons and three **cosmic phases** (四序三元),
Our **incense cultivation** (熏修) has been neglected and abandoned.

The **Five Senses** (五情) have been **polluted** by the **Five Sins** (五辛),
And the **Three Poisons** (三毒) have been **brewed** by the **Three Emptinesses** (三).
We indulge in **luxurious garments and abundant food**,
Yet never reflect on their **origins**;
We **slander and speak ill**,
And **heed no warnings** of virtue.

Some **scheme** for wealth and bribes,
Accumulating **grudges** from **worldly petty folk**;
Others **slay and harm living beings**,
Severely **injuring** the **great virtue** of **Heaven and Earth**.

We hold **direct and unfiltered views**,
Yet our **hearts lack remorse** for past wrongs.

Our **petty actions** go unacknowledged,
While **true spirits** remain distant.

**A hundred evils** find opportunity,
And **ten thousand deaths**—how could we endure?

We dare to **petition** beneath the **Celestial Procession’s clouded palanquin** (天仗之云軿),
And **pour forth** our **sincere, humble prayers** (愚衷之血恳).

We **pray for universal forgiveness** (肆赦),
And **seek permission to renew ourselves**.

May we, the **incense officials** (醮官),
**Internally purify** the **Spirit Platform** (灵台),
**Externally align** with the **stillness of water** (止水),
That the **Three Palaces** (三宫) may shine with clarity,
And the **Six Qi** (六气) be in harmony,
Ever maintaining the **unshaken spirit** (不二之神),
And **silently guarding** the **Heavenly Primordial Mystery** (天元之妙).

May the **Elixir Field** (丹田) be **secure and sealed**,
And our **refining work** yield the **vast nourishment** (养浩之功);
May the **Jade Nectar** (琼液) descend and ascend,
So we may **ascend** and grasp the **Essence of the Valley Spirit** (谷神之要).

By **breathing** to **irrigate** the **Three Lights’ true Qi** (三光之真炁),
We may **prolong** our **Nine Transformations’ distant lifespan** (九转之遐年).
May the **Blue Scriptures** (青篇) record our **meritorious deeds**,
And the **Black Registers** (黑簿) note our **transgressions and sins** (愆尤之字).

We shall **constantly depend** on the **True Law** (正法),
And **borrow secretly** the **Merciful Light** (慈光).
In our **comings and goings**, may the **One Spirit** (明一神) **harmonize** with our **sincerity**.
May we **adjust** to the **cool and warm**,
And **banish** all **epidemics and calamities** (疫疠).
May we **never encounter** **demonic creatures** (魑魅魍魉),
And **inevitably attain** **wealth, longevity, health, and peace** (富寿康宁).

We **pray** that **Heaven may be clear and Earth still**,
That the **land flourish** and its **people be at ease**,
All **returning** to the **pure and tranquil wind** (清静之风),
And **sharing** in the **joy of the Auspicious Transformation** (升平之化).

We **declare** the **Heavenly Sovereign’s great mercy** (天尊大慈之泽),
And **fulfill** our **sincere devotion** (臣等皈向之诚).
Thus, we **respectfully submit** our prayers.

**Twelve Vows** (十二愿).
**Re-entering the Furnace** (复炉).

We **respectfully summon** the **incense officers and messengers** (香官使者),
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (左右龙虎君),
And the **attendant spirits** (侍香诸灵官),
So that they may **command** the place where we **now turn toward the Dao** (臣向来静夜行道之所),
Where **golden nectar and elixir jade** (金液丹碧),
**Herbs of longevity and myriad spirits** (芝英百灵) naturally arise,
And the **true spirits** (众真) **gather** here at this **incense furnace**.

May we **vow** that the **Ten Directions’ celestial youths and jade maidens** (十方仙童玉女),
**Receive and attend** to the **fragrant clouds** (兰烟),
And **transmit** our **sincere petitions** (所启之诚),
Swiftly reaching the **Primordial Dao’s Most True and Boundless Sovereign** (至真无极大道),
And the **Heavenly Sovereign’s Divine Presence** (昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Requesting the invocation of the Dao’s rank** (请称法位).
**I, [Name], of the Conjuration Officials** (醮官某), along with the **assembled spirits of the platform** (合坛众等),
**Solemnly present my sincere vows** (谨同诚上启):

To the **Most High Boundless Dao** (太上无极大道),
The **Primordial Sovereign of Heaven** (元始天尊),
The **Most High Dao Sovereign** (太上大道君),
The **Most High Lao Sovereign** (太上老君),
The **Most High Heavenly Sovereign of the Jade Palace** (太上昊天玉皇上帝),
The **Nine Sovereigns Above** (九皇上尊),
The **Ten Directions’ Boundless Dao** (十方无极),
The **Most High Celestial Sovereign of the Sacred Treasure** (太上灵宝天尊),
The **Already Dao-Attained Great Saints** (已得道大圣),
The **Multitude of True Essences** (众至真),
The **Honorable Lords** (诸君丈人),
The **Thirty-Six Departments of Supreme Scriptures** (三十六部尊经玄中大法师),
The **True Martial Spirit of the Northern Pole’s Auspicious Response** (北极佑圣真武灵应真君),
The **Responsive Spirits of the Three Realms** (三界应感),
And the **All-Encompassing True Spirits** (一切真灵).

I have heard that at the **beginning of the Han Dynasty’s celestial era** (龙汉纪号之初),
On the **day when the Primordial Dao was manifested** (元始演法之日),
The **Five Clouds** spread beneath the **wondrous seat** (敷五云之妙座),
And the **multitude of True Spirits from the Ten Directions** gathered (会十方之众真).
At the **Upper Primordial Dao’s Celestial Palace** (上元仙宫),
The **heavenly music resounded** on its own (天乐自响),
When suddenly at the **Gan Position** (艮位),
A **great tremor of seven sounds** shook the heavens (大震七声),
And the **Celestial Gate was swiftly opened** (奄辟天门),
To **descend and observe the world** (下观世界).

The **Essence of Dark Poison and Blood Light** surged upward from below (黑毒血光之炁，自下而冲);
Within the **Dao’s realm of the Great Sun** (太阳道境之中),
**All was visible** when gazing downward (俯目皆见).

Then arose the **wondrous deeds** (妙行),
The **strange causes** for inquiry (发问异因),
To **request the Sovereign’s might and splendor** (欲请威光),
To **descend and eliminate demons and spirits** (下除魔鬼),
**Acknowledging the Heavenly Sovereign’s compassionate teachings** (感天尊之慈训),
And **recounting the True Martial Spirit’s sacred traces** (述真武之灵踪).

The **King of Pure Joy** (净乐国王) and the **Queen of Good Victory** (善胜皇后),
**Swallowed the Sun’s Light in their dreams** (吞日光於梦寐),
And **gave birth to the Holy Child in the palace halls** (诞圣子於宫闱).
They **inherited the natural divine spirits** (禀自然之神灵),
And **bore the courage of humanity** (负过人之勇猛),
**Assisting the propagation of the orthodox teaching** (辅行正教),
**Undaunted by obstacles**, their **sincerity was unyielding** (难遏勤诚),
**Vowing to exterminate the world’s demonic spirits** (誓断天下之妖魔),
And to **universally save all beings** (普救世间之群品).

At **Mount Wudang**, their **Dao cultivation was perfected** in **forty-two years** (武当修道，功成於四十二年);
On **the White Day**, they **ascended to Heaven** (白日登天),
Their **virtue and power** aligned with the **Northern Pole’s Water Position** (德正於北方水位).
Thus they **laid aside the attendance of the Golden Boys** (辍金童之侍),
And **held the talismans to summon the True Spirits** (俾持招真之符).
They **journeyed to the distant Northern Capital** (遥往朔都),
**Summoning their divine generals** (召其神将).
The **celestial rites ceased**, and **swiftly they arrived here** (仙仪萃止，欻驾来斯).
They **received the mandate from the True Sovereign** (奉眷命於真皇),
**Determined to clear the lower realms of impurities** (期肃清於下境).
Their **hair blackened by dark clouds**, their **feet bare upon the empty void** (披发而乌云拂踵，跣足而白玉莹空).
They **rode upon the Eight Trigrams’ divine tortoise** (蹑八卦之神龟),
And the **mythical serpent followed** (螣蛇亦附);
They **wielded the Seven Stars’宝剑** (仗七星之宝剑),
And the **sacred waters accompanied them** (神水相随).
**Thunder and lightning displayed their might** (雷电扬威),
**Winds and clouds bore them aloft** (风云捧步).

The **Thirty-Six Heavenly Soldiers** (六丁玉女) and the **Thirty-Six Earthly Soldiers** (六甲直符),
**Dispatched the swarming poisonous dragons and ferocious beasts** (毒龙猛兽之纷纭),
**Scattered the encircling giant tortoises and lions** (巨虬狮子之围绕),
And **commanded over thirty million divine troops** (统吏兵之三十余万).
They **judged between humans and spirits** within **seven days** (判人鬼於七日之中),
And the **demonic essences of the heavens were dispersed** (弥天之妖炁荡除),
The **suffering souls of transgressors were liberated** (作孽之冤魂解散),
So that **living beings were at peace** (生人安泰),
And the **land was free from calamities** (国土清平).
They **returned to pay homage before the Heavenly Sovereign** (复朝见於天尊),
And **forever dwelled in the Northern Pole’s domain** (永临镇於北极).

Now, **I, the Conjuration Official**, having **reviewed the extraordinary merits** (阅殊勋於宝恢),
**Cannot fully express my gratitude** (难尽偷扬);
I **received the True Martial Spirit’s command** at the **auspicious hour** (奉真驭於灵辰),
And **desire to seek their assistance** (欲资佑助).

Now, **selecting a site of auspicious reserve** (爰择储祥之地),
To **extend the sacred rites** (用伸延圣之仪).

**Laying out** the **sacred wine and rice wine** (陳醪醴以惟馨),
**Offering** the **pure grains and pure vessels** (荐粢盛而有洁).

**Scattering** the **hundred-blended incense** (散以百和之香).
**Devoutly exhausting** the **sincere heart** (悉罄精衷),
**Supplicating** the **Heavenly Sovereign’s discernment** (上祈冲鉴).

May we **receive boundless blessings** (庶被无疆之福祉),
And **forever rely upon the august and mighty** (永依有赫之威灵).

**I, the Conjuration Official**, together with the **assembled ritualists and officials** (臣与醮官合坛众等),
**Humbly await**, **with utmost reverence and longing**, to **petition above** (无任伫望仰请之至),
**With profound awe and fear**, **prostrate twice** (诚惶诚恐，稽首再拜),
**To solemnly welcome the True Martial Spirit** (奉迎真驭).

**Descend, True Martial Spirit!** (降真)
**Offer tea.** (献茶)
**First offering—scatter flowers.** (初献，散花)

**I, the humble servant** (具位臣某),
**With utmost sincerity**, **now humbly petition**:
To the **Emperor of the Golden Peak of the Void-Nothingness** (虚无自然金阙至尊),
The **Ten-Direction Limitless** (十方无极),
The **Supreme Lord of the Numinous Treasure Dao** (太上灵宝天尊),
The **Great Sage Who Has Obtained the Dao** (已得道大圣),
The **Many True Ones** (众至真),
The **Honorable Masters and Lords** (诸君丈人),
The **Thirty-Six Departments’ Venerable Masters of the Mystic Middle Scripture** (三十六部尊经玄中大法师),
The **North Pole’s Auspicious and Holy True Martial Spirit Who Responds to Prayers** (北极佑圣真武灵应真君),
The **Three-Realm Responsive and All-Encompassing True Spirits** (三界应感，一切真灵).

**I have heard** that **heroic spirits** (英灵)
**Merge with the myriad** (混合),
**Forming the ten thousand qi** (结万炁)
To **harmonize with the Immortals** (以齐仙);
**Dispelling falsehood**, **life emerges** (浇伪兹生),
Yet **grouped darkness** brings **strange transformations** (有群阴之变异).
**Greatly**, the **sun and moon are eclipsed** (大则日月薄蚀),
**Lesser**, the **ogres and demons rage** (小则魑魅猖狂).
When **spontaneous transformation falters** (自动化失),
**It strays from the Central Harmony** (谬於中和);
**Thus**, the **ranks and gatherings** become **errant** (使品汇遂),
**Contradicting the Ultimate Principle** (乖於至理).

**Greatly**, the **Dao** (洪惟大道),
**Truly** **pities the black-haired masses** (寔念黔黎).
**Commanding** the **Heavenly Rectifying Spirit** (命灵天正肃之神),
**To sweep away** the **errant qi of the lower earth** (扫下土妄行之炁),
**With one stroke of the black banner** (一挥皂纛),
**All the ringleaders are exterminated** (咸殄渠魁).

**We, the Dao-conjuring officials** (奉道醮官某等),
**Long devoted to the True Light** (久奉真光),
**Ever indebted to its sacred protection** (每叨灵荫),
**Now fortunate** that the **Celestial Vanguard descends upon this day** (幸仙仗降临於是日),
**Gazing toward the celestial thoroughfare** to **reverently await the Imperial Might** (望霄衢祇迓於皇威),
**Offering the sincerest devotion of an ant** (少输蝼蚁之诚),
**To welcome the Dragon and Phoenix’s Vanguard** (以接龙鸾之驭).

**Fortunate to receive Heaven’s favor** (幸蒙降鉴),
**With utmost reverence**, **we humbly accept** (益谨钦承),
**Repeatedly submitting our earnest pleas** (据情捆之再三),
**Facing the sacred light at close proximity** (对灵光於咫尺).

**Having received Your gracious words** (臣既承词悃),
**How dare I not report above?** (敢不上闻).
**Proclaim the words.**
**As the words declare**, **our devotion is profound** (按如词言，诚深皈奉).
**Indeed**, **this lower earth** (矧兹下土),
**Truly relies upon Your mighty influence** (寔仰余威).
**Verified by form and sound**, **it resonates like echo and response** (验若形声，应同影响).

**Reflecting upon my insignificance** (言念某蟪蛄末品),
**A mere blade of grass and insignificant life** (草芥微生),
**Only diligently tending to incense and fire** (惟勤香火之修),
**Yet failing to fathom the Mysterious and Lofty** (莫究希夷之妙),
**Each action violates the sacred prohibitions** (动违科禁),
**Fearful of incurring blame** (恐获谴尤),
**Trembling in self-examination** (抚己兢惶),
**With heart pounding in dread** (扪心怵惕),
**Respectfully offering this morning’s tribute** (敬涓谷旦),
**Solemnly establishing the sacred precinct** (肃建灵场).

**Humbly relying upon the Sacred Decree’s embrace** (仰圣度之含容),
**Praying for Heaven’s auspicious grace to be universally bestowed** (祈天休之普洽).
**May our flaws be cleansed and impurities dispersed** (涤瑕荡垢),
**Immediately receiving the blessing of a thorough purification** (即蒙一洗之恩);
**May we transcend calamity and extend life**, **equally sharing in the renewing grace** (度厄延生均荷维新之泽).

**We, the servants**, **are overwhelmed with urgent and heartfelt petitions** (臣等无任激切祈请之至),
**Prostrate twice**, **now humbly present the secondary offering.** (再拜，谨陈亚献)
**Scatter flowers.** (散花)

**I, the servant**, **with renewed sincerity**, **now humbly petition**:
To the **Emperor of the Golden Peak of the Void-Nothingness** (虚无自然金阙至尊),
The **Ten-Direction Limitless** (十方无极),
The **Supreme Lord of the Numinous Treasure Dao** (太上灵宝天尊),
The **Great Sage Who Has Obtained the Dao** (已得道大圣),

The **North Pole’s Auspicious and Holy True Martial Spirit Who Responds to Prayers** (北极佑圣真武灵应真君),
The **Three-Realm Responsive and All-Encompassing True Spirits** (三界应感，一切真灵).

**I have heard** that **the Emperor of Heaven’s Nine Gates** (上帝九门),
**Can only be moved by sincerity** (惟精诚而可格);
**The Five Auspicious Blessings of the Great Plan** (洪范五福),
**Depend upon virtuous deeds to attain** (系明德之能徼).

**Now**, **perfuming the ritual ground** (辄以熏场),
**Gazing upward to the celestial banners** (仰延霞旆),
**The sacred rites are roughly complete** (仙科粗息),
**And all sincere pleas are laid bare** (凡悃毕陈).
**May You inspect the Imperial Heart** (上简帝心),
**Piercing the vastness of the Great Luo** (彻大罗之渺渺);
**May we lay our petitions before Heaven’s ear** (仰陈天听),
**Gazing upon the boundless celestial color** (棱正色之苍苍).

**May we transform groundless calamity into great fortune** (愿迁无妄之灾，变作大来之福).
**The libation of wine is now offered** (酌醴已伸於潦荐),
**And my sincere heart is devoted like the sunflower’s tilt** (丹心惟效於葵倾).

**Humbly awaiting Your boundless compassion** (仰望洪慈),
**Reverently receiving Your gracious intentions** (俯歆素志).

Now, **the red carriage and green attendants** (今则丹舆绿辈),
**Parting the celestial path to return in splendor** (排天路以回轩);
**The coral canopy and jade wheels** (珊盖琼轮),
**Gazing upon the cloudy thoroughfare as the procession departs** (望云衢而返驾).

**We, the servants**, **behold Your swift departure into the clouds** (臣等仰瞻飙驭，已在云霄),
**Yet our hearts ache with longing** (徒切倾心),
**Humbly sending You on Your sacred journey** (奉送圣驾).

**Our deepest sentiments** (臣等下情),
**Are overwhelmed with urgent yearning** (无任激切攀恋之至),
**Now humbly reporting this** (谨启以闻).
**The Twelve Petitions.** (十二愿)
**Reignite the incense burner.** (复炉)

**With solemn reverence, the Incense Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Attendant Spirit Officials of the Incense are now summoned.**

Let them now direct the places where I have previously practiced in quiet nights—where golden elixir and emerald-green essences naturally arise, where mushrooms and hundred-spirited herbs flourish, and where assembled immortals gather before this incense burner.

**I now pray that the celestial children and jade maidens of the Ten Directions may attend to the fragrant mists, swiftly conveying my sincere words to the Supreme and Most High Dao of the Unoriginated and Boundless Great Way, before the august **Hao Tian Yu Huang Di, the Jade Emperor of Heaven.**

**Exit the Hall and Recite the Praise.**
**Exit the Gate.**

Merging with the Dao naturally, ascending to the Purple Court.
The Sacred Treasures’ Talismans universally benefit all beings.
The Original Sovereign’s Qi arrives, merging with my body.
My merit surpasses all—Heaven and Earth are at peace.
Merging with the Dao.

**Five Qi of Dark Heaven, the Primordial Beginning wanders.**
The Star of the Hour shines brightly, illuminating the Great Enclosure.
The Black Spirit Venerable God, named **Ceng Wei.**
Commanding the flying crown, with silk robes and feathered garments.
Guarding the Five Gates, inspecting and capturing the guilty.
Dare any to provoke—let them be shattered and felled.
The Jade Talisman declares, the God’s might subdues the Eight Powers.
Evil gates are sealed, the True Dao clearly opens.
Illuminating my body, the Three Lights shine together.
Riding the void, floating in flight, my form ascends as an immortal.
Merging with the Dao.

**One Qi of Yellow Heaven, harmonizing Heaven and Earth.**
Forging Yin and Yang, commanding the Mysterious True.
The Star of the Constellation radiates, its brilliance flowing through the Nine Heavens.
Awakening the Bright Child, named **Tian Lian.**
The Original Qi’s Yang essence flames upward in vermilion mist.
Piercingly illuminating all under Heaven, and my body.
A hundred evils are crushed, ten thousand ghosts slain.

The Five Spirits are pacified, my body ascends as an immortal.
Merging with the Dao.

**Strike the Law Drum twenty-four times.**

**The Supreme Three-Heaven Primordial Beginning, Three Qi—**
**The Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Laozi—**
**Summon forth from my body the Three Five Functionaries, the Left and Right Officials and Messengers, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Dragon Post Cavalry Officers, the Attendant Golden Boys, the Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ True Talismans, the Direct-Sun Incense Officials—**
**A total of thirty-six persons emerge.**

**Those who emerge are arrayed in splendid attire, with caps and trailing ribbons.**
**Open the gates of the Mysterious Altar to the Land and Domain Spirits.**

**Now, in this quiet night as I practice the Way, I humbly present my sincere intentions.**
**All my earnest sentiments have been recorded and reported.**
**May the Ten-Directional True Dao Qi and Sacred Treasures’ Radiant Light descend, flowing into my body,**
**So that my words may swiftly reach the Supreme Most High Unoriginated and Boundless Great Dao, before the august **Hao Tian Yu Huang Di, the Jade Emperor of Heaven.**

**Request to declare the ritual rank.**
**The humble servant of rank [position], along with all the assembled officials of the altar, now burns incense,**
**Offering these merits to the Heavenly Son, kings and lords, ministers and officials, scriptural masters, mountain-dwelling and rock-dwelling cultivators, fellow students of the Way, kin and relatives, all people under Heaven, flying and rooted beings, and all sentient life.**

**Now, burning this incense, I dedicate my body, my spirit, and my command to the Supreme Sacred Treasures of the Natural, True, Unoriginated, and Boundless Dao.**

**I beseech the granting of forgiveness for myself and the ritual assembly, as well as the fasting Daoists of this practice, including my teachers and disciples, for all past and present transgressions and grave offenses.**
**May we escape the Three Evil Wheels of Rebirth, free from the Ten Sufferings, Eight Hardships, and Nine Calamities,**
**Attaining the Dao’s True Essence, flying through the void, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight,**
**Serving the Dao Lords in the boundless Golden Palace of the Seven Treasures, eternally merging with the Dao,**
**As my words are conveyed and felt before the Supreme Most High Unoriginated and Boundless Dao.**

**Repentance. Proclaim the True Text.**

**The humble servant of rank [position], along with all the assembled officials of the altar,**
**Sincerely address the Three Pure Ones of Highest Holiness, the Ten Extremes of Highest Perfection, the Ten-Directional Sacred Treasures Heavenly Venerables, the Venerables of Erasing Offenses and Extinguishing Sin, the Venerables of Great Compassion and Extended Longevity, the Venerables of Everlasting Life and Preserved Command, the Nine-Heaven Natural-Generated Divine Sovereign of Heaven, the Degrees of the Primordial Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Heavenly Venerables and Heavenly Emperors, the Upper Clarity Sun, Moon, Stars, and Milky Way Assembly of True Ones, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Teachers and Three Ministries True Lords, the Nine-Heaven Celestial Registrars, the True Lords of All Dynasties Who Transmitted the Lineage and Opened the Teachings, the Thunderous Tiger Divine Physicians and All Official Commanders, the Supreme Stages of Scriptures and Talismans’ Immortal Officials and Clerks, the Emperor of the Underworld’s Acid Fields, the Holy Assembly of the Netherworld, the Emperor of the Water Palace’s Vermilion Forest and Immortal Grove, the True Immortals of Langyan, the Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Heavens, the Acid Fields’ Earthly Deities, the Commanding Generals of the Dry Element, the Tai Sui Earth-Fire, the Temperate Officials and Holy Assembly, the Gods of States, Counties, and City Walls, the Gods of the Local Shrines and Altars, the True Officials of the Land, the Ritual Altar’s Subordinate Officials and Commanders, the Three Realms’ Soul-Snatching and Spirit-Binding Messengers, the Four Realms’ Direct-Talisman Functionaries, the Masters of the Ritual Feast, and all Mighty and Spirited Ones.**

**In humble reverence, we behold Your boundless mercy, Your all-pervading and enlightening gaze.

We, Your servants, have heard that the Primordial Ancestor of the Eon *(元始祖劫)* is a name too lofty to be fully articulated; the Void of Naturalness *(虚无自然)* is the realm where the Soaring Mysteries *(飞玄)* unfold and manifest. You give birth to Heaven and Earth, forming their shapes and essences. From the extreme convergence of **Qi** *(一气之极)*, all things flow and are harmoniously complete *(流通，万物之得咸备)*.

Among all beings, humans alone are deemed most noble and must possess a fundamental root *(根元)*; the **Dao** *(道)* originates from this very source, and thus we recognize the Primordial Ancestor *(祖始)*.

Since the dawn of creation *(开辟)*, we have been ensnared in the cycle of birth and death *(缠生死之缘)*. We know the suffering of transmigration *(轮回之苦)* yet remain trapped within it; we grasp the true nature of life and death *(性命之真)* yet fail to fully embody its purity. In vain, we have studied the scriptures, worn the precepts, expounded teachings, and proclaimed doctrines, seeking the root of the Supreme Primordial *(太上希夷之根)* and exploring the origin of the mixed formation of existence *(有物混成之始)*. May those who now understand the **Dao** and their true bodies *(知道知身者)* swiftly return to their pristine and unadulterated essence *(还纯返素)*; may those who refine spirit and **Qi** *(炼神炼气者)* quickly transcend the realm of existence and enter the Void *(出有入无)*.

In the past, we once vowed to uphold the transmitted teachings, striving to broaden our understanding and enlightenment. Now, as we humbly submit and offer gratitude, our earnest intentions may be fulfilled. Our disciples’ words are sincere; we shall diligently proclaim them.

**Proclamation of Words.** With meticulous care, we scrutinize our language, and our hearts’ sincerity is manifest. Our fervent resolve has been fully expressed; the purity of our intent does not wane. We reverently observe the prohibitions and precepts, meticulously follow the canonical rituals *(典彝)*, establish the altar with solemnity *(肃严)*, and gaze toward the vault of Heaven *(穹窿)* as we earnestly petition.

May our steadfast single thread of devotion *(一缕之念)* ascend to the Supreme Truth of the Ten Extremes *(十极之真)*. We realize that our primordial **Qi** *(元炁)* is obscured through countless rebirths, and our harmonious essence *(冲和)* is scattered among all things. We cling to worldly attachments *(世缘)* without cultivating the **Dao** above, ensnared by habits of love *(爱习)* and unable to return to the Mysterious Root *(玄根)*. Without true sincerity, how can we hope for universal enlightenment?

Let us now abandon all past impurities in a single purification, and from this very day, we shall earnestly renew our practice. We, Your servants, shall solemnly bathe our five bodies *(五体)*, refine our six emotions *(六情)*, align ourselves with the Earth yet mirror Heaven *(法地象天)*, and carry incense with unwavering faith *(赍香奉信)*. With this day and hour, we open the altar, adhering to ritual propriety *(依仪行事)*.

On the appointed day and hour *(至某日某时)*, we shall invite the descent of the Supreme Truths *(延降上真)*, offer thanks and repentance *(谢过忏愆)*, and beseech blessings and divine commands *(祈恩请命)*. In accordance with the prescribed rites *(科法)*, we shall report this in advance *(宿以启闻)*.

May the blessings of the Supreme Primordial Three *(太上三清)*, the Ten-Directional Supreme Saints *(十方上圣)*, descend upon us with mercy and illumination. May they oversee and inspect our humble petitions, and command the Spirited Officials of the **Lingbao** *(灵宝官属)*, the True Officials of the Land *(土地真官)*, to unite in heart, combine their strength, and protect us—cleansing and purifying the altar within and without, subduing demons and malevolent spirits *(降伏妖魔)*, extinguishing all evil influences *(诚灭邪祟)*—so that our minds may be at peace and our spirits steadfast. May our sincere thoughts be immediately answered, and our petitions swiftly conveyed to the Celestial Sovereign. May our virtuous deeds be accomplished without obstruction, and our wishes fulfilled as we desire. Without hindrance, our aspirations shall be realized.

Though we wear the badge of the Supreme Truth *(佩正真)*, study the Great Law *(参修大法)*, dwell within the Five Turbidities *(处身五浊)*, and bear the stains of the Six Dusts *(染迹六尘)*, our Three Passes *(三关)* remain unaligned, and our Six Emotions *(六情)* are unrestrained. We rely solely on the prohibitions and precepts to restrain our bodies and minds *(捡身心)*.

Then, may the Supreme Truths descend upon us, guiding and welcoming the radiant blessings *(导迎景贶)*. At dawn, we shall perform the **Dao** *(明晨行道)*, and continue the rites as we report *(续更以闻)*. Respectfully proclaimed.

**Twelve Vows.** Restoring the Furnace. We earnestly summon the Incense Officials and Messengers *(香官使者)*, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officials *(左右龙虎君)*, and the attendant Spirited Officials of the Incense *(侍香诸灵官)*. May they command that at the place where we formerly solemnly invoked and walked the **Dao** *(臣向来肃启行道之所)*, there shall naturally arise the Golden Elixir and Azure Jade *(金液丹碧)*, the Hundred Spirited Herbs and Blossoms *(芝英百灵)*, and the gathering of all True Ones *(众真交会)*, right here before this Incense Furnace.

May it be our vow that the Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens of the Ten Directions *(十方仙童玉女)* attend and receive the incense smoke, swiftly transmitting our sincere invocation *(所启之诚)* to the Supreme Primordial, the Boundless Great **Dao** *(至真无极大道)*, and the Celestial Jade Emperor’s august presence *(昊天玉皇上帝御前)*.

**Eulogy Upon Exiting the Hall.** Exiting the Hall, we chant. Departing the Gate.

**The Complete Ritual Standards of the Dao Gate, Volume 69 Complete**
**The Complete Ritual Standards of the Dao Gate, Volume 70**
**Ritual of Daoist Cultivation and Repentance for Offenses**

At dawn, the Dao is walked in solemnity. The ritual ascends the platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the law.
The **Spirit-Guardian Incantation** is proclaimed.

The **Pure Yang** shines forth, its radiance returning the numinous.
The **Divine Tiger** repels malevolence, the **Flying Celestial** tolls its bells.
The wicked are crushed, the false are annihilated—ten thousand demons bound in form.
The **Nine Mysteries** return the **Dao**, the **Eight Powers** subdue the essence.
A thousand **True Ones** inspect the records; the **Three Primordials** purge the clear.
The **Left Whistle** summons the **Central Yellow**, the **Right Baton** marshals the **Six Ding**.
Seven revolutions, eight unions—circulating the **Heavenly Classics**.
The **Sacred Transformation** stands majestic; the **Great Dao** moves in action.
Auspicious clouds flow abroad, merging with the **Yellow Court**—harmonizing with the **Dao** and the **True**.

The **Supreme Law-Drum** is struck twenty-four times.

The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin’s Three Qi**—
The **Most High Dao Lord**, the **Most High Laozi**—
summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Functionaries**, the **Left and Right Officials and Messengers**, the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**, the **Postal Dragon Riders**, the **Incense-Serving Golden Boys**, the **Flower-Scattering Jade Maidens**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**, the **Direct-Sun Incense Officials**—
a total of **Thirty-Six** emerging.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
their headgear and sashes adorned with trailing plumes.
They open the **Mysterious Altars** of the **Land and Domain Spirits**, the **Territorial Deities and True Ones**.

I, your servant, now walk the **Dao** at dawn in solemnity,
and humbly offer this as my sincere intent.
My deepest emotions have been recorded and presented—
may the **Most High’s Ten-Directional True Dao-Qi** and the **Numinous Treasure Auspicious Light** descend,
flowing into my body,
so that my invocation may swiftly reach the **Most High’s Boundless Great Dao** and the **Celestial Jade Emperor’s august presence**.

**Invocation of the Law-Position.**
Your servant of such-and-such rank, along with the assembled officials of the altar,
sincerely and together present our invocation to:
The **Three Pure Ones, Most Sacred**, the **Ten Extremes’ High True Ones**, the **Ten Directions’ Most High Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthies**,
the **Worthy Who Extinguishes Faults and Annihilates Offenses**, the **Worthy of Great Mercy and Extended Longevity**, the **Worthy of Eternal Life and Preserved Vitality**,
the **Natural-Generated Divine Sovereign of the Ninth Heaven**, the **Supreme Sovereign Who Transmits Humankind**, the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Sovereigns**,
all **Celestial Worthies and Sovereigns**, the **Upper Clarity Sun-Moon-Stars-Constellations-Galaxy Cluster of True Ones**,
the **Three Officials and Four Saints**, the **Five Teachers and Three Provincial True Lords**,
the **Nine Heavenly Celestial Registrars**, the **True Lords of All Generations Who Transmit the Lineage and Open the Teachings**,
the **Thunder-Tiger Divine Physicians and All Officials and Generals**, the **Celestial Officials and Clerks of the Most High’s Various Stages of Scriptures and Talismans**,
the **Named-Mountain Immortals Who Have Attained the Dao**,
the **Dengtu Emperor of the Underworld**, the **Holy Assemblies of the Netherworld**,
the **Fu-Sang Cinnabar Forest Emperor of the Water Palace**, the **True Immortals of Langyuan**,
the **Five Peaks and Five Celestial Sacred Emperors of Humanity**, the **Yingdu Earth Deities**,
the **Commanders-in-Chief of All Departments**, the **Year-Lord Earth-Fire**, the **Temperate Officials and Sacred Assemblies**,
the **Local Temple and Shrine Deities**, the **True Officials of the Blessing Court**,
the **Altar Officials and Generals**, the **Three Realms’ Spirit-Soldiers Who Extract Souls and Seize Spirits**,
the **Four Realms’ Direct-Symbol Functionaries and Messengers**, the **Ritual Feast Overseers**,
and **all True Immortals**.

With reverent gaze upon their boundless mercy,
and penetrating insight into their profound discernment—
we, your servants, by fate’s early appointment,
have attained the **Law-Gate**,
following the **Primordial Standards of the Great Polarity**,
bearing the **Secret Talismans of Upper Clarity**,
broadly proclaiming the **Deepest Intentions**,
to offer our sincere devotion.

Now, the **Jade Palace** is pure and clear,
the **Treasure Altar** solemn and august.
We present the **Celestial Regulations** with utmost reverence,
and stand in awe before the **True Ones’ Vehicles**,
enjoying this pure cultivation,
responding to their manifest proclamation.
Having received their words,
how dare we not present them above?

**Proclamation of the Words.**
As the words are laid out, the sincerity is as deep as cinnabar.
The **Orthodox Unity Daoist** your servant of such-and-such rank,
by fortune’s grace, has wished to be touched by the **True Wind**,
and happily relied upon the **Pure Gate**,
hoping to awaken to the **Mysterious and Profound Intentions**.

Yet, considering the obscurations of dusty toil,
the remorse and vexation of clinging to attachments,
my heart races in vain toward the **Three Pure Ones**,
while my footsteps cannot escape the **land and sea**.
My merits are as slight as a hair’s breadth,
while my offenses accumulate like mountains and rivers.
The **Five Phases** shape my fate’s cultivation,
and the **stars and constellations** weave the calamities of their illumination—
without repentance and atonement,
how could these be dispelled?

Thus, with **sincere faith and pure heart**, we extend true rites,
commanding the **Orthodox Unity Pure Assembly** to open the **Numinous Treasure Pure Altar**,
and for ages have we perfumed and refined our practice,
now fulfilling our destined resonance.

At this dawn, as we walk the **Dao**, we request the assembled **Law-Crowd** to light this **first incense-stick**,
wishing this incense-smoke to ascend directly to the heavens,
offering sustenance to the **Supreme True Dao-Treasure**.

We, your servants, **return our bodies, return our spirits, return our fates**,
and with this merit,
pray for the **Current Emperor**.
May the **Sacred Map** be firmly established,
and the **Sage’s longevity** extend far and long.
May **Sovereign Governance** renew daily,
and the **Royal Virtue** uphold the **Great Middle Dao**;
may the **Imperial Virtue** be heaven-supported,
enduring through ten thousand ages as an unshaken foundation.
May the **myriad peoples** take root in harmony,
and the **civil and martial ranks** assist the flourishing dynasty.
May the **Jade Lineage and Golden Branches** proclaim auspicious destiny,
and **grace extend near and far**, benefiting both the living and the dead.
May we be blessed by the **Dao’s Transformation** to call forth harmony,
and bathed in the **Mysterious Wind** to achieve great peace.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return in devotion to the Dao-Emperor’s Great Sacred Assembly of True Ones**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we ascend to the **Formless**,
harmonizing with the **Dao** and the **True**.

At this dawn, as we walk the **Dao**, we request the assembled **Law-Crowd** to light this **second incense-stick**,
wishing this incense-smoke to ascend directly to the heavens,
offering sustenance to the **Supreme True Scripture-Treasure**.

We, your servants, **return our bodies, return our spirits, return our fates**,
and with this merit,
offer it to the **Orthodox Unity Daoist** your servants of such-and-such rank,
the **Three Teachers and Nine Ancestors**, the **Recently Deceased Who Were Transformed**,
our **Daoist and Secular Kin**, our **superiors and inferiors, our relatives**—
may their **earthly records be erased**,
their **forms and spirits refined**,
their **debts and grievances extinguished**,
their **resentments and feuds laid to rest**,
so they may enter the **Realm of Bright Dews**,
be bathed in the **Court of Flowing Fire**,
and forever depart the **Nine Hells**,
ascending to the **Pure Domain**.

May the **True Teachers and Mysterious Friends** grant **Divine Medicines and Sacred Elixirs**,
and rescue the **bewildered**, bestowing **enlightened resonance**.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return in devotion to the Scripture-Emperor’s Great Sacred Assembly of True Ones**.
After attaining the **Dao**, we ascend to the **Formless**,
harmonizing with the **Dao** and the **True**.

At this clear dawn, we perform the Dao,
and invite the assembly of the Law to kindle these three strands of incense.
May this incense smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
offering homage to the **Supreme True Teacher**.

We submit our bodies, spirits, and lives in devotion,
and with these merits, we return to the **Orthodox Unity Daoist** [submissive name].
To our **preceptors and juniors**, our **legal kin and ancestral roots**—
though we have not yet escaped the entanglements of the mundane,
we pray to expand our response to the Dao’s embrace.

In the **Court of Blessings**, may we attain reverent vision,
secure our abode without fear;
with **jewel-engraved scriptures**, may we delve deeply and gain insight.

Forever abandoning worldly burdens,
we shall proclaim the **True Wind**,
and see one child ascend to the Immortal,
while nine generations receive their blessings.

Now, we burn this incense,
and **return in devotion to the Teacher-Emperor’s Great Sacred Assembly of True Ones**.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
harmonizing with the **Dao** and the **True**.

**Repentance, command the demons, tread the void**—three obeisances.
We reaffirm our **Lawful Station**.

With **this humble servant** and the assembled officials,
we solemnly and sincerely petition:

**Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Natural Emptiness,**
**Supreme Daoist Lord,**
**Supreme Venerable Lord,**
**August Jade Emperor of Heaven,**
**Hookuan Heavenly Sovereign,**
**Polar North Purple Micro Emperor,**
**Earthly Sovereign of the Southern Soil,**
**Heavenly Worthy of the Three Treasures of Daoist Scripture,**
**Highest True Ones of the Rounded Canopy,**
**Lowest Rulers of the Four Quarters,**
**Those with Spirits and Saints,**
**Teachers and Ancestors of Past and Present,**
**True Immortals gathered at this ritual feast—**

With reverence, we gaze upon your boundless mercy,
and pray for universal illumination.

We have heard that the **Teaching of Purity and Stillness**
was grandly expounded in the **Western Zhou**.

**The Wind of the Zhengyi Dao** spread in the **Eastern Han**.
From the **Primordial Heavenly Worthy’s** creation of the cosmos,
the **Dao** was held as supreme;
When **Pangu** opened the heavens,
the **divine transformations** took precedence.

To the east, the **Flying Phoenix** arrayed its splendor,
to the west, the **Spiritual Peaks** stood in ranks;
to the south, the **Crimson Ridge** ascended,
to the north, the **Primordial Gate** loomed.

Thus arose the **Supreme Sage** who wields the **Symbol of Authority**,
the **Highest True Ones** who rule the **Celestial Pole**,
seated in dominion over the **Nine Purity**,
overseeing the **Three Realms**,
guiding the **Two Qi** in harmony,
convening the **Ten Thousand Spirits**,
broadly dispersing the **gentle winds of mercy**,
graciously descending upon the **lower earth**.

Now, in this age of the **Heavenly Treasure’s** auspicious cycle,
the **Dragon Han**’s **transformative source** is uniquely manifest,
universally benefiting all humankind,
that they may attain the **Domain of Longevity**.

The **Zhengyi Daoist** of humble station,
born in this **radiant era**,
long enduring fortunate times,
once gained entrance to the **Mysterious Gate**,
received the **wondrous teachings**,
and was guided by **master and lineage**,
bearing the **sacred texts** in reverence.
Yet through **accumulated karmic weight**,
I was ensnared in **erroneous realms**.

At the **Three Assemblies** and **Five Grand Rituals**,
I fell short in fulfilling the **morning tribute’s** duty;
During the **Eight Festivals** and **Three Celestial Cycles**,
I neglected the **rituals of advancement and cultivation**.

The **Six Yang** and **Ten Rectitudes**,
I honored yet still transgressed;
In the **Jiazi** and **Gengshen** years,
I performed **sparse and incomplete rituals**.

The **Nine Grades of Abstinence**,
I did not fully comprehend the **True Doctrine**;
The **Three Thousand Meritorious Deeds**,
I lacked reliance upon the **Sacred Teachings**.

The **precepts** are most grave,
and my observances often failed;
The **disciplinary laws** are stern,
yet my practice left gaps.

My **mind was not pure**, my **intentions disordered**,
violating the **One Hundred and Eight Precepts**;
My **wisdom was shallow**, my **understanding dim**,
transgressing the **Three Hundred Great Vows**.

The **Six Passions** and **Ten Evils**,
my offenses piled like mountains;
The **Nine Knots** and **Ten Entanglements**,
my faults sank deep as oceans.

My **transgressions filled the Black Register**,
my **guilt bound for the Underworld Judges**,
leading to ever-deepening calamities,
as disasters and perils swiftly approached.

Therefore, I knock upon the **Mysterious Gate** with prayer,
and gaze toward the **Crimson Gate** to seek return;
I **pledge my days** in sincere devotion,
and **bare my heart** in faithful submission.
Now I **spread the ritual platform**,
and **propose the clear precepts**,
**bowing in homage** to the **Honored Ones of the Three Realms**,
**vowing allegiance** across the **Three Realms**,
offering **fragrant incense** to the **Hundred Harmonies**,
and **illuminating the Nine Lights** with **flowering lamps**.
The **Five Spirits** gleam in the **Crimson Seal’s** talismans,
and the **Eight Assemblies** unfold the **Mysteries of the Dark Realm**.

As I **oversee the Daoist rites**,
the **Three Masters** bestow their **saving grace**;
For my **abstinence and meritorious deeds**,
the **Four Officials** decree the **Ordinances of Fate**.

The **transgressions are pardoned, the calamities dispelled**—
the **fruit of the Dao** attains its perfect roundness,
delving deep into the **principle of Non-Action**;
the **true source** shines forth,
gazing alone upon the **gateway of myriad mysteries**.

The **root of birth-and-death** is severed,
freeing from the **suffering of vexation**.

The **Three Masters and Nine Ancestors** ride upon **auspicious virtue** in **effortless ease**;
the **Five Clans and Six Relatives** bathe in **divine grace** and **prosperity**.

Above, I pray that the **Three Lights** shine resplendent,
the **Five Stars** follow their courses,
the **harmony of qi** be balanced,
and all living beings rejoice in common.

**Weapons rest in silence**, with no fear of **border alarms**;
**harvests abound**, and the **Nine Territories** flourish in **agricultural prosperity**.

I extend this grace to the **Three Realms of the Underworld**,
the **Six Paths of Rebirth**—
all immersed in **divine waves**, bathed in **sacred dew**,
ascending universally to the **Realm of Longevity**,
and rejoicing in the **True Wind**.

Through the **transformations of the Dao**, all beings thrive in **harmony**—
above, honoring the **Heavenly Venerable’s** vast compassion,
below, fulfilling the **sincerity of my humble devotion**,
I humbly submit this prayer.

**Twelve Vows fulfilled.**
**The Furnace Reborn.**

I solemnly command the **Incense Officials and Messengers**,
the **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords**,
and the **Attendant Spirits of Fragrance**—
let them now cause the place where I formerly performed **morning rites** to spontaneously generate
**golden elixir and emerald jade**,
**hundreds of numinous herbs and spirits**,
as the **multitudes of True Ones** gather here before this **incense furnace**.

May I pray that the **celestial children and jade maidens of the Ten Directions**
attend to the **fragrant smoke**,
and swiftly convey my **earnest supplications**
directly to the **Supreme Dao of Non-Extreme Perfection**,
the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s** august presence.

**The Hall Hymn is completed.**
**The Doorway is crossed.**

**The Completion of the Daoist Canon of Rituals and Precepts, Volume Seventy**
**The Daoist Canon of Rituals and Precepts, Volume Seventy-One**

**The Daoist Rite of Repentance for Cultivating the True Way**

At noon, the ritual is performed.
The **sacred rites** ascend the platform as prescribed.

Each pays homage to the **Master of the Dao** in reverent remembrance.
The **Guardian Incantations of the Spirit** are proclaimed.

**Danling** [丹靈] and **Zhuhuo** [朱火] blaze,
**Flame and Cloud** [炎霞] surge with the wind.
The **Red Wheel** [赤輪] moves with unyielding force,

**Divine Manifestation** [神化] flows auspiciously,
**Four Quarters** [四極] stand in harmony.
**Submission before the Celestial Sovereign** [伏御帝前],
none dare be disrespectful—
**aligned with the Dao and the True** [與道合真].

The **Law Drum** [法鼓] resounds **twenty-four strokes** [二十四通].

Invoked are:
**The Three Primordial Powers of the Three Heavens** [無上三天玄元始三炁],
**The Supreme Daoist Lord** [太上道君],

**headgear and sashes** [冠帶垂缨],
opening the **Mysterious Daoist Platform** [玄坛] to the **Land Deities** [土地],
and summoning the **Spirits of the Region and Domain** [方域神真].

I now perform the ritual at noon,
offering this **entreaty of sincerity** [入意].
All my **earnest supplications** [情悃] have been recorded and presented.
I pray that the **Supreme Daoist Spirit of the Ten Directions** [太上十方至真道炁],
**Sacred Treasure and Auspicious Light** [靈寶瑞光],
descend and enter my body,
so that my **supplications** may swiftly reach
the **Supreme Non-Extreme Dao** [無極大道],
the **Celestial Jade Emperor** [昊天玉皇上帝] in His august presence.

I request the **proclamation of my sacred rank** [稱法位].

With **reverent awe** [恭望洪慈], we **implore the piercing insight** [洞垂昭鑑].

We, the Daoists,
have **accumulated past blessings** [先缘积庆],
received **Imperial Grace** [获奉皇恩],
and **uphold the True Precepts** [持真戒] to cultivate our bodies,
**wield the Sacred Talismans** [执灵符] to save our lives.
Yet, we **shamefully lack even an inch of merit** [愧无寸效],
and **dare to provoke the Primordial Wind** [将迪元风].

We **stir our sincerity** [激励於精衷],
and **proclaim our secrets** [用宣行於秘赜].

O **Heaven above** [惟天在上],
**look down** [俯怜] upon our **earnest prayers** [有祷之诚];
**especially now** [況日之中],
we **all reverence the boundless light** [共仰无私之照].

With the **sacrifice hall now solemn** [登斋既肃],
and **devout recitations earnest** [荐叹惟勤],
my **ritual words are sincere** [行道词诚],

**Proclamation of Words** [宣词].

**Carefully examining each phrase** [谛详词语],
I **fully recount my sincere entreaties** [备述丹衷].
I **hope for divine response** [仰冀感通],
and **pray for fulfillment of my wishes** [俯从至愿].

**Daoist Certain** [正一道士某],
in **gratitude for the harmonious vital breath** [幸禀冲和之气],
has **returned to the School of Serenity** [获归恬淡之宗].

Though my **body is stained by worldly dust** [身染俗尘],
my **heart is inscribed with the Mysterious Workings** [而心铭玄造],
I **fear slackness and neglect** [常虞懈怠],
and **fail to answer the call of life** [罔答生成].

On this **auspicious day** [涓吉之辰],
I **specially establish this rite of supplication and expiation** [特设祈禳之醮],
**devoutly extending my sincere prayers** [虔伸丹悃],
**reaching the Pure Void** [上渎清虚],
**repenting past transgressions** [谢已往之愆尤],

We **follow the prescribed rituals** [遵依科简],
**erect the sacred platform** [启建坛场],
**unfold the Daoist Canon of Sacred Treasures** [披灵宝科文],
and **adhere to the ranks of True Immortals** [按真仙品格].
With **reverent fasting** [恭修斋直],
we **neither slacken at dawn nor dusk** [匪懈晨昏].

We **declare to the Spirits above** [告上灵],
**open the Five Billions of Heavens** [关五亿之天];
we **reach the prayers below** [达下恳],
**pervade the Three Thousand Realms** [徧三千之境].

We **hope for their discerning blessings** [冀回鉴佑],
**universally descending grace** [普降恩光],
and **fulfillment of our hearts’ desires** [克洽灵心],
**earnestly repaying our deepest wishes** [恪酬至愿].

With this **noon ritual** [临午行道],
I **request the assembly of the Law** [请法众] to **kindle this initial incense** [等运兹初捻上香].
I pray that this **fragrant smoke** [香烟] may **ascend to the heavens** [腾空俓上],
**offering worship to the Three Supreme Lords** [供养太上三尊].

We **return our bodies, spirits, and lives** [皈身、皈神、皈命],
and with this **merit**, we **bless the present Emperor** [上祝今上皇帝].
**May his life equal Heaven’s** [伏愿寿与天齐],
**his blessings flow like rivers** [福如川至],

and **the merit of this Sacred Treasure rite** [承灵宝之斋功]

Now, as we **burn incense** [故烧香],
we **return in devotion to the Daoist Lord’s virtue** [自皈依道尊大圣众至真之德].

After **obtaining the Dao** [得道之后],
we **ascend to Non-Action** [升入无为],
**harmonizing with the True and the Dao** [和与道合真].

With this **noon ritual** [临午行道],
I **request the assembly of the Law** [请法众] to **kindle this second incense** [运兹二捻上香].
I pray that this **fragrant smoke** [香烟] may **ascend to the heavens** [腾空俓上],
**offering worship to the Supreme Daoist Scriptures** [供养太上尊经].

We **return our bodies, spirits, and lives** [皈身、皈神、皈命],
and with this **merit**, we **dedicate to Daoist Certain** [归流正一道士某],
**future generations of our ancestors** [多生上祖],
**the spirits of past ages** [奕世先灵].
Though we **owe the Daoist bones and immortal wind** [虽负其道骨仙风],
we **shall not dare to act lightly** [莫谐轻举空服乎].

With **hempen robes and jade sashes** [荷衣蕙带],
we **cannot escape the depths of suffering** [难脱沈沦].
I pray to **ride the merit of the Sacred Treasure** [乘灵宝之功],
and **receive the Daoist Ordination of Ascension** [受以飞仙之箓].

To **stand among the ministers of the Celestial Sovereign** [侍臣於上帝],
and **join the ranks of the Law** [并参法从於高穹].

Now, as we **burn incense** [故烧香],
we **return in devotion to the virtue of the Scripture Lords** [自皈依经尊大圣众至真之德].

After attaining the Dao, ascending into the Formless, and harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence,
we **return our bodies, spirits, and lives** [皈身、皈神、皈命],
and with this **merit**, we **dedicate to Daoist Certain** [归流正一道士某],
**lightening our bodies, freeing our spirits** [身轻体逸],
as though we were **innocent as a newborn babe** [如婴儿之未孩];
**our qi is steadfast, our spirits undisturbed** [炁固神安],
even when confronted by **fierce beasts** [逢猛兽] we **do not fear** [不据].

In the **sequence of the four seasons** [处春夏秋冬之序],
we **avoid the ills of wind, cold, heat, and dampness** [无风寒暑湿之愆];
**no six piercing ailments** [六凿] arise,
**a hundred diseases disperse** [百痾荡散].
The **Daoist lineage** [法裔] together **bears the blessings of Great Peace** [共膺於泰定],
and the **gates of our halls** [门庭] forever **gather in Auspicious Harmony** [永集於祥禧].
All **calamities vanish** [有厄俱消],
and there is **no journey without rejoicing** [无往不庆].

Now, as we **burn incense** [故烧香],
we **return in devotion to the Scripture Lords and True Daoists** [自皈依师尊大圣众至真之德].

After attaining the Dao, ascending into the Formless, and harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence,
we **repent our sins** [忏方],
**command the demons** [命魔],
**walk the Void** [步虚],
and **pay homage with three obeisances** [三礼].
We **reaffirm our Daoist vows** [重称法位].

**Certain, a Daoist of the Orthodox Unity**, [正一道士某]
having **severed worldly ties** [迹离尘缘],
living in this **sacred age** [生逢圣世],
as a **novice of the Yellow Hat** [处黄冠之末学],
dwells in **deep seclusion within the Azure Palace** [即绀宇以深居],
**cutting poisonous influences and subduing evils to accumulate merit** [馘毒伐恶以积功],
**proclaiming the teachings to benefit the world** [奉教宣科而济世],
yet still **entangled in the mundane web** [仍缠俗网],
often **mixing with ordinary Daoists** [每混常流].

Though **frugal enough to ensure tranquility** [俭足静安],
we **do not uphold the precepts of the Red Pine** [不念赤松之戒];
if we **covetously indulge** [苟贪损志],
we **fail to follow the Sacred Edicts** [莫遵翊圣之文].

At the **Six Yang and Ten Rectitudes**, yet **fearing to keep fasts**;
At the **Three Assemblies and Five Gatherings**, yet **forgetting to confess sins**.

Ignorant of the **Three Passes’ harmony** [三关之调适],
I invite the **Six Bandits’ conflicts** [六贼之相攘],
Chasing petty **fasting and exorcism rites** [斋醮之小缘],
Drowning in the **bitter sea of disputes** [是非之苦海],
Greedily grasping, ever seeking—
Now joyful, now wrathful.

Frequently transgressing **Altar Precepts** [坛规],
Ignorantly violating **Taboos** [禁忌],
Breaking **Scriptural Precepts and Vows** [科戒],
Unrestrained in **mind and spirit**.

Within the **Three Clarities and Six Obscurities** [三明六暗],
I am lost in **false realms** [邪境];
In the **Eight Nodes and Four Seasons** [八节四时],
I achieve **no merit** [善功].

A hundred **vital pathways** [百渎] are drained,
**Qi fades, fluids leak** [气亡液漏].
The **Three Peng’s schemes** [三彭] take hold,
**Misfortune binds, the form withers** [祸结形枯].

Deeply grieved that **ancestors strayed from the True Way** [先世以迷真],
I fear **following the fleeting life’s untimely end** [逐浮生之夭丧].
Seeking **repentance and expiation’s method** [忏禳之法],
I offer **sincere contrition** [首谢之诚].

I **reverently follow the Sacred Statutes** [典彝],
**Diligently observe fasts and rectitude** [斋直].
The **Jade Flower’s scattered light** [玉华散景]
Forms the **Dragon’s incense smoke into a celestial carriage** [龙烟凝车盖之形];
The **Lotus flame ascends in radiance** [莲焰腾辉],
Illuminating the **Phoenix candle’s orchid-lantern qi** [凤烛灿芝兰之气].

I present **pure offerings of lotus and rush** [苹蘩之洁],
With **ornate patterns to cleanse** [文彩之蠲],
Fruits most **excellent**, **sacred wine refined** [酒醴既旨],
Praying that **ten thousand spirits attend** [万神之来享],
To **refine the One Virtue’s essence** [格一德之精纯],
And **proclaim the subtle and mysterious** [微妙之音],
Transcending to the **Void Sovereign’s hearing** [虚皇之听].

I **hope the Three Pure Ones and Ten Extremes’ High Worthies** [三清上圣、十极高真]
Will **graciously accept my humble sincerity** [俯纳微诚],
And **bestow great blessings** [垂巨贶],
Commanding the **Three Officials to record** [三官掌录],
And the **Five Emperors below to witness** [五帝以下观],
Pardoning **past sins and flaws** [已往之罪瑕],
Granting **future merits and fate** [将来之禄算],
Secretly revealing the **Edict of Longevity** [长生之旨],
And **concealing the Method to Abide in the World** [驻世之方].
May my **name ascend to Heaven’s observation** [飞天下观],
And **great merit be bestowed** [大勋保举],
With **clouds gathering at the Sacred Hall** [云凝灵府],
And my **name inscribed in the True Ranks** [名入真阶].

**Abstaining from grains and rice** [断谷辟粮],
I **nourish myself on the harmonious Yang-Yin qi** [食至和阴阳之气];
**Burning incense and extending my hands** [烧香接手],
I **enter the Celestial Hall’s Vermilion Gate** [入太室璇玑之门].

**Adrift in the Upper Clarity** [逍遥上清],
I **transcend the Three Realms** [超波三界],
Attaining the **Fruit of Non-Action** [无为之果],
And **forever banishing the encroachments of karmic fall** [堕业之侵].

**My highest wish** is that the **nation’s lineage flourish** [国祚兴昌],
The **imperial plans be secure** [帝图安镇],
The **four seas attain tranquility** [海宇即臻於康静],
And the **people rejoice in peace** [黎民共乐於升平].
May **granaries overflow** [岁赡仓箱],
**No sickness or blemish afflict** [物无疵疠],
With **imperial grace extending far** [恩波所及],
Both **hidden and manifest beings blessed** [幽显俱沾],
Each **fulfilling their proper place** [各遂攸宜],
And **all finding their due** [咸得其所].

We, **having perfected the Six Perfections** [功圆六度],
And **attained the Three Easeful Paths** [道证三便],
**Retiring to cold seclusion** [谷隐寒栖],
Have **ascended to the True Fruit** [克登真果],
**Above, repaying the Heavenly Venerable’s boundless mercy** [上明天尊大慈之泽],
**Below, fulfilling our sincere conversion** [下副臣等皈命之诚].
**Respectfully submitted** [谨启以闻].

**Twelve Wishes.**
**Reignite the Furnace.**
**Respectfully, I command the Incense Officials and Messengers—**
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** [左右龙虎君],
And the **Attendant Spirit Officials** [侍香诸灵官]—
To **order that at my former midday ritual site** [午朝行道之所],
**Gold Elixir and Jade-Green Dan** [金液丹碧],
**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits** [芝英百灵]
Naturally **converge**, with **all Worthies assembling** [众真交会],
**Before this incense furnace.**

I **pray that the Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens** [十方仙童玉女]
Will **attend the orchid incense** [接侍兰烟],
And **transmit my sincere petition** [传臣向来所启之诚]
**Swiftly to the Supreme Ultimate Great Dao’s Presence** [径御至真无极大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前].

**Exit the Hall and Chant Praises.**
**Exit the Door.**

**To take refuge in the Sutra-Honored Great Saints** [经尊大圣], **seeking the Perfect Virtue of the Most Authentic Ones** [众至真之德].
**After attaining the Dao**, I rise into the **Formless** [无形],
And **harmony aligns with the True Dao** [和与道合真].
With my present **falling into the luminous Dao** [落景行道],
I **invite the Law-Bearing Assembly** [请法众等] to carry this **three-pinched incense** [三捻上香],
**May these incense fumes ascend directly to the heavens** [愿此香烟，腾空径上],
**To venerate the Nine Grades of Supreme Celestial Ones** [供养九品上仙], **and the Most Venerable Saints of the Ten Directions** [十方上圣].
**We devote our bodies, spirits, and lives** [臣等皈身、皈神、皈命],
And **dedicate these merits**
[以是功德]—
**To flow back into Daoist Certain One’s life** [归流道士某身中].
**Humbly wishing the Dao-nature be perfectly illuminated** [伏愿道性圆明], **and the Sacred Heart be revealed**.
**May our actions meet no obstacles** [行运不逢於坎坷], **and our appearance remain forever youthful** [相貌长新];
**May our years forever avoid calamity and decline** [流年永绝於凶衰], **and the spirits and gods shield and bless us** [鬼神荫佑].
**May joy and anger not linger within our hearts** [喜怒不留於胸臆],
And **our vital essence be steadfast within the elixir field** [精神内固於丹田].
**Nurturing vastness like spring’s renewal** [养浩如春],
**May we dwell in this world with a youthful, immortalized body** [住世生身之难老];
**With an empty heart attuned to the Dao** [虚心契道],
**May we transcend the mundane and enter the sacred, enduring forever** [超凡入圣以长存].

Now I burn incense,
**To take refuge in the Teacher-Honored Great Saints** [师尊大圣], **seeking the Perfect Virtue of the Most Authentic Ones** [众至真之德].
**After attaining the Dao**, I rise into the **Formless** [无形],
And **harmony aligns with the True Dao** [和与道合真].
**Repentance** [忏方], **subduing the demon of life** [命魔], **walking the void** [步虚]—
**Three reverences** [三礼].
**Repeatedly proclaiming the sacred ranks** [重称法位].
**The assembled officials and I**, in solemn sincerity, **now make this offering**:
[具位臣某与合坛众官等，谨重诚上启]
To **Primordial Heavenly Lord of Natural Voidness** [虚无自然元始天尊],
**Supreme Daoist Lord** [太上大道君],
**Supreme Old Lord** [太上老君],
**Celestial Jade Emperor of Highest Heaven** [昊天玉皇上帝],
**Gouchen, the Heavenly Sovereign Emperor** [勾陈天皇大帝],
**Purple Microdipper Emperor of the Northern Pole** [北极紫微上帝],
**Empress Hou Tu, the Earthly Sovereign who Upholds the Dao and Follows the Law** [承天效法后土皇地祇],
**Heavenly Lord of the Three Treasures of Daoist Scripture** [道经师三宝天尊],
**The Most Authentic Ones who span the highest vault** [上穷圆盖之高真],
**And the sovereigns who rule the four cardinal directions** [下极方舆之主宰],
**The arrayed deities of the ritual feast** [醮筵列圣],
**And all true spirits** [一切真灵].
**Reverently beholding their boundless compassion** [恭望洪慈],
And **their penetrating insight and clear discernment** [洞回昭鉴].
**We humbly hear that the primordial chaos is vast and boundless** [臣等伏闻混沦荡荡],
**Ever-changing yet without measure, and it alone is the first principle** [变通莫得而为先].」

「The radiant **Mángjué** [芒角] stars mark the moment when the primordial chaos was opened and the **Pì** [辟] was thus distinguished.
The **Huángrén** [皇人] transmitted this through the **Great Brahman** [大梵], and the **later sages** [后圣] compiled it in the **divine diagrams** [灵图].
The grand symbol was established, and the vast source was first distinguished.
When **scattered**, it illuminates the **Three Manifestations** [开明三景]; when **settled below**, it spreads the **Five Classics** [下镇则敷落五篇].
The **imperial edicts** [典诰] flow abundantly, and the **profound mysteries** [渊微] are widely disseminated—
All deities respectfully listen, and all beings derive their blessings.
We, the humble disciples, born with utmost stupidity,
Devoted to the **highest learning** [上学],
Following the **mysterious teachings** [玄教],
And confronting the **Supreme Truths** [上真],
Have since receiving our **Daoist precepts** [命] striven to cultivate our bodies,
Ever adorning ourselves and diligently practicing our studies.
Though we have **roughly grasped** [粗识] the **golden scriptures and jade decrees** [金文玉札] from the **fishing nets and hoofprints** [筌蹄],
We have never **glimpsed** [莫窥] the **sacred realms and celestial stages** [圣域仙阶].

Only through **sincere faith and unwavering trust** [坚诚信信],
Do we hope to **attain divine communion** [冀获感通],
For **the True Pattern** [真格] will be revealed,
And the **august spirits** [尊灵] will surely descend.

A **Daoist practitioner** [道士] of humble station,
Residing in the **Daoist domain** [道域],
Seeking shelter under the **celestial truths** [霄真],
Yet unable to **sever ties with the dusty world** [谢绝於尘寰],
Still **entangled in worldly snares** [沉迷於世网].
Though we **recite scriptures and bear precepts** [参经佩戒],
Our resolve is **insufficiently driven** [虽加策励之心];
Though we **practice secret virtues and hidden merits** [密行阴功],
Our strength remains **lacking in advancement** [尚缺进修之力].
Our **natural aptitude** [机灵] is **obscured** [素昧],
And we have yet to **attain all virtues** [众善弗臻].
Our **habitual tendencies** [习气] are not yet **cleansed** [未除],
And we are **constantly entangled in karmic causes** [诸缘常染].

We have **delved into the minute practices** [细行] of the **Eight Hundred Schools** [八百],
Yet **no guiding principle** [未见指归] has been revealed;
We have **assembled the full array of ritual decorum** [威仪备列] of the **Three Thousand Precepts** [三千],
Yet **no true diligence** [曾无精进] has been achieved.
Our **karmic roots** [业根] are **deeply entrenched** [深固],
And the **fruition of the Dao** [道果] is **difficult to attain** [难成].
We have not yet **entered the gate of enlightenment** [未登悟解之门],
Lest we **fall into the obstructions of worldly toil** [恐堕尘劳之障].

Now, we **prostrate ourselves at the feet of the Most High** [首体投地],
Morning and evening **reporting to Heaven** [晨夕告天],
Examining the **clear precepts** [稽按明科],
And **earnestly presenting the pure ritual feast** [严陈净醮].
We **open the jade scripture** [经开玉笈],
And **establish the golden ritual** [像礼金容].
The **celestial harmonies** [灵音] resound within the **emptiness of the cosmos** [振空洞之章],
And the **common folk** [黎土] gather the **jewels of the assembly** [集宝珠之众].

The **fragrance** [香] is conveyed through the **seven stations** [七驿],
Reaching the **sincere devotion** [达诚悃] of the **Heavenly Sovereign** [虚皇];
The **lamps** [灯] shine brightly in the **Nine Celestial Regions** [九微],
Dispelling the **darkness and obscurity** [破幽昏] of the **nightly abyss** [夜壑].
We **fulfill our aspirations for profound cultivation** [曲尽黑修之志],
And **do not neglect our morning praises** [不违朝赞之勤].
To **harmonize with the True Spirits** [格真灵],
And **achieve resonance with the Radiant Responses** [克谐昭应],
All deities attend as **guardians** [万神侍卫],
And the **Three Realms** [三界] observe as **sentinels** [监观].
We **petition the Mysterious Capital** [奏简玄都],
And **address the Red Celestial Throne** [列言丹陛].

Humbly awaiting the **imperial decree** [勅] descending to the **Three Realms** [三界],
We **universally proclaim to all heavens** [普告诸天],
Seeking **blessings and benevolent flow** [降福流恩],
And **prolonging life while safeguarding existence** [延生保命].
May **wisdom penetrate and profound enlightenment endure** [智通玄悟],
And **eternally dispel our ignorance** [永息昏迷].
May **rich rewards and long lifespan** [厚禄遐龄] be ours,
And may we **always dwell under the protection of the Law** [常居法荫].
May **harmony and peace dissolve grievances and debts** [和平冤咎],
And **dissipate calamities and misfortunes** [消解灾凶].
May the **Five Phases** [五行] suffer **no destructive or oppressive calamities** [无刑克之殃],
And the **Three Manifestations** [三景] cease **illuminating the gatherings of misfortune** [息照临之会].

May we **resolve the celestial afflictions** [上解] of the **Lunar Lodges and Solar Stations** [璇玑天文宿曜十二分次之厄],
And **dispel the terrestrial disasters** [下解] of the **mountains, rivers, and cosmic divisions** [山川岳渎九宫八卦分野之灾].
May **ancient sins and accumulated offenses** [夙罪积愆],
**Deep calamities and heavy retributions** [深殃重衅],
**Past grievances and debts incurred** [前冤往债],
And **wrongful killings and unintended injuries** [故杀误伤],
As well as the **endless transgressions of the Three Karmas and Six Emotions** [三业六情],
All be **expiated from this day forth** [自今忏谢],
And **universally cleansed** [咸乞荡除].

Our **uppermost aspiration** [上愿] is that the **Imperial Dao** [帝道] may **forever be secure and flourishing** [永安洪基益茂],
And that the **Three Lights** [三光] may **shine brightly** [朗照],
While the **Four Seasons** [四序] are **harmoniously regulated** [均调].
May it **encompass the vast seas of Shùn** [包舜海以涵濡],
And **broaden the radiant light of Yáo** [广尧曦而照烛].
May the **Five Winds and Ten Rains** [五风十雨]
**Ever nourish the abundance of all things** [常滋物产之丰];
And may the **Eight Grains and Nine Silkworms** [八谷九蚕]
**Greatly benefit the hopes of farmers** [大足农民之望].

May the **qi** [气] be **without errant influence** [无缪盭],
And the **Year of the Hare** [岁兔] be **free from calamitous mists** [灾氛].
May this **extend to all living beings** [普及群生],
And **benefit the Nine Realms** [旁资九有].
May we **fulfill the Daoist path of inheritance** [成承道果],
And **all attain the True Vehicle** [俱契真乘].
Thus, we **acknowledge the Most High’s compassionate transformation** [上明天尊大慈之化],
And **align with the disciple’s sincere repentance** [下副弟子谢罪之诚].
We **respectfully submit this prayer** [谨启以闻].

**Twelve Aspirations** [十二愿] **completed.**
**Returning to the furnace** [复炉].

We **solemnly gather** [谨摄] the **fragrance officers and envoys** [香官使者],
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** [左右龙虎君],
And the **attendant spirits of incense** [侍香诸灵官].
They shall **guide us to the places of our past transgressions** [当令臣向来落景行道之所],
Where **golden nectar and azure jade** [自然生金液丹碧],
**Mushrooms and herbs of a hundred spirits** [芝英百灵],
And **all True Ones** [众真] will **converge in assembly** [交会],
At this **incense and fire furnace** [在此香火炉前].

May we **wish that the Ten Directions of Celestial Youths and Jade Maidens** [十方仙童玉女]
**Attend to the fragrant vapors** [接侍兰烟],
And **transmit our sincere prayers** [传臣向来所启之诚]
**Swiftly to the Supreme Dao of the Boundless Ultimate** [径御至真无极大道]—
Before the **Heavenly Sovereign of Jade Clarity** [昊天玉皇上帝御前].

**Exiting the hall to chant** [出堂颂].
**Exiting the door** [出户].」

**With reverence, I await the Great Compassion** [《伏望洪慈》],
**And pray for the profound understanding** [《洞回照鉴》].
I hear that the **Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets** dwell **above the Azure Sky and Jade Void** [《臣闻日月星辰，在碧汉瑶空之上》];
The **Immortal Spirits and Sovereign Masters** reside **within the Pure and Serene Forest’s slopes** [《仙灵主宰，居清虚林麓之间》].
Some **oversee the Sacred Daoist Platform**, some **hide in auspicious lands** [《或管摄於灵坛，或隐居於福地》],
Some **govern the head of a Direction**, some **are honored as the Five Earthly Deities** [《或镇一方之首，或为五土之尊》],
**Recording the two books of good and evil**, **holding the two ledgers of merits and transgressions** [《录善恶之二书，举功过之两簿》],
Thus **they have no private favoritism**, **only the Dao is followed** [《故无私蹈，惟道是从》].

**In reflection**, I and my **assembled Daoist officials** have **long embraced the True Dao’s winds**, **early relied on the Dao’s transformation** [《伏念臣等早簉真风，夙依道化》],
**Received the blessings of the Daoist Gate**, **taken refuge in the Hall of Sacred Treasures** [《受法门之庥荫，寄琳馆以安居》],
Yet **I am ashamed to have lost the cause of the Ten Virtues** [《惭亡十善之因》],
**How can I repay the Three Pure Ones’ benevolence** [《何赞三清之惠》]?
Since **I first donned the Daoist robes**, **many cycles of time have passed** [《自从披戴，几度光阴》],
Yet **I have not been able to deeply move the Divine Beings** [《未能感彻於神明》],
**And often have lightly violated the Precepts** [《动有轻违於科戒》].
**Initially diligent yet finally negligent**, **with a beginning but no end** [《初勤末怠，有始无终》],
**My devotion to the Dao is flawed**, **my compassion and virtue are not upright** [《奉法心邪，慈仁不正》],
**I burn incense without proper ritual**, **my prayers violate the Dao’s words** [《焚香失节，存念违言》].
I fear that **my three transgressions** [《虑三彭》] may be **secretly recorded in the ledgers of guilt** [《暗奏於愆辜》],
And that **my nine offenses** [《惧九府》] might be **clearly inscribed in the registers of sin** [《明书於罪目》].

Now, **I humbly present my sincere and earnest prayers** [《今则辄倾丹悃》],
**Extensively arranging incense and lamps** [《广列香灯》],
Invoking the **Divine Beings of the Heavenly and Void Realms** [《请天界空界之群真》],
And summoning the **Holy Assembly of the Underworld and Water Realm** [《延地府水府之众圣》],
The **Five Sacred Mountains’ Sovereign Masters** [《五岳主宰》],
The **Ten Sacred Caves’ Spirit Officials** [《十洞灵官》],
I pray that **they may accept the humble offerings** [《愿歆苹藻之羞

The Five Winds and Ten Rains bestow upon me the longevity of Tang and Yu;
The seas grow tranquil, the rivers clear, harmonizing with the transformations of Xī and Xuān.

We, Your humble servants, have been graced by the Master’s teachings,
And entrusted with our duties—
For all who seek refuge, it is proper to report them.
How much more so when we receive Your sacred words—
How dare we fail to present them above?

**The Edict is proclaimed.**
The Edict is fully proclaimed; our sincerity is earnest and sincere.

We lay bare our hearts and lungs,
Pour forth our deepest intentions,
Hoping to express the loyalty of Your servants and children,
And to repay the humility of our station.

We humbly pray to the **Celestial Sovereign of the Void and Natural**,
To the **Highest Dao Lord**,
To the **Supreme Old Lord**,
To the **Jade Emperor of Heavenly Sovereignty**,
To the **Great Emperor of the Gourd Cluster**,
To the **Great Emperor of the Northern Pole’s Purple Micro**,
To the **Earthly Sovereign of the Posterior Soil**,
To all the **Heavenly Lords**,
To all the **Heavenly Emperors**,
To the **Highest Worthies of the Round Canopy** above,
To the **Sovereign Masters of the Four Quarters** below—
To all the **Spiritual and Holy Ones**, past and present,
To the **Teachers and Ancestors of the Ritual Assembly**—
That Your boundless compassion may pierce the depths and return with wisdom.

We have heard that the **Void and Natural** is the **Mystic Sovereignty of the Three Pure Ones**,
And that the **Southern Pole’s Record-Keeper** truly holds the **Total Authority of the Nine Departments**.
They oversee the **Records of Fortune and Misfortune**,
Judge the **Length of Life and Death**—
Where merit is added, guilt is erased;
Where virtue is recorded, vice is removed.
Thus, there is no door of partiality,
Nor room for frivolous petition.

We, Your humble servants, are of frail **Lower Elemental** constitution,
Our bodies burdened by the **Three Delusions**.
Though we have received the Master’s guidance,
And been pointed toward the path of ascent—
Alas! The **Sacred Scriptures and Precious Laws** are transmitted but once in seven hundred years;
The **Phoenix Seals and Tortoise Diagrams** appear but once in six cycles of the Heavenly Stems.
They are not given to mortals,
Nor transmitted without the Dao.

In the boundless **Pure Void**, in the distant **Purple Bureaucracy**,
The path to **Long Life** is obtained—
Yet none shall meet **Early Death**.

We rely on the **Great Vehicle of Single Aspiration**,
Abandoning the **Three Delusions**,
Freeing ourselves from the **Net of Attachment**,
And severing the **Causes of Affliction**.

Thus, the Dao naturally aligns with the **Three Existences**,
And the person attains **Oneness**.
By preserving the **Spirit-Body**, one nurtures longevity;
By banishing the **Ghostly Corpse**, one secures full years.

Yet the **Mysterious Symbols** remain elusive,
And **Conditional Beings** have not yet been abandoned—
Still dwelling in the **Abode of Immortals**,
Yet lingering in the **Filth of the Dust**.

The Dao is scarce in its **Adaptability**,
And our practices are **Negligent in Concealment and Manifestation**.
Our nature is **Obscured by Ultimate Truth**,
Our conduct **Falls short of Profound Subtlety**.

Thus, the **Three Calamities** return to assail,
And the **Four Great Elements** are invaded.
We follow the **Heavenly Master’s Ritual of Atonement**,
And establish the **Soul-Jewel Altar of True Declaration**.

We kneel and supplicate at the **Mysterious Gate**,
And pour forth our **Sincere Prayers**.

We humbly pray that the **Jade Ledgers of the Three Officials** may pardon our **Violations of Scripture and Precepts**,
And that the **Jade Tablets of the Five Emperors** may absolve our **Past Mistakes and Unintentional Offenses**.

Then, the **Law-Waters of the Merit-Mountain** shall wash away our **Dusty Filth**,
And the **True Winds of the Wisdom-Forest** shall revive our **Decayed Wood**.

The **Breakers of Grievances** shall preserve our **Steadfast Vows**,
And the **Protectors of the Law** shall uphold the **Practitioners of the Path**.

The **Ten Sage Disciples** and the **Four Categories of Adepts** shall perceive the **Mysteries of the Three Teachings**,
And behold the **Doors and Windows of the Multitude of Worthies**.

We hope that the **True Court** may flourish and be revered by the **Four Seas**,
And that we may be graced by the **Personal Guidance of the Most Sacred**,
Transmitting the **Mystic Instructions of Non-Action**.

Yet we reflect that our time in the **Law-Gate** is brief,
And our seeking of the Teacher has been shallow.
We do not grasp the **Essence of the Teaching**,
Nor fully recognize the **Principles of Ritual Decorum**.

Thus, though we act to benefit others,
Our merit yields no immediate response;
Though we follow the Teachings in practice,
Our devotion rarely brings manifestation.

We fear the **Four Departments of Punishment**,
And the **Heavenly Rebuke for False Speech**—
Now, as we humbly prostrate and confess,
We pray for Your mercy and forgiveness.

We further hope that our petitions may be answered,
That the **Teachings may spread throughout the Ten Directions**,
And that the **Ritual Offerings to the Worthies** may be proclaimed far and wide.

May all **Humans and Celestials** hold us in reverence,
May the **Altar’s Faith** remain pure and fragrant—
All shall be nourished by Your **Bountiful Grace**,
And attain the **Favor of the Phoenix and the Great Bird**.

We, Your humble servants, are overwhelmed by our **Repeated Prostrations and Earnest Petitions**.

**The Wine Offering is presented and the final libation poured.**
**Flowers are scattered.**
**The Ritual Positions are reaffirmed.**

We, **Your humble servant of such-and-such rank**, together with the **Assembled Officials of the Altar**,
Solemnly and sincerely petition above—
To the **Nine Pure Ones and Ten Extremes**,
To the **Ten Thousand Saints and Thousand Worthies**,
To the **Descending Spirits of the Ritual Assembly**,
To all the **Holy Beings**—

We have heard that the **Sacred Worthies are distant and exalted**,
Their **Mysteries hidden within the Mysterious**,
Their **Dao-Realm lofty and void**,
Residing in the **Symbol beyond Symbols**.

We rely on the **Fragrance of Incense** to reach their presence,
And with utmost sincerity, hope to touch their **Divine Response**.
The **Original Creator is without bias**,
And their **Piercing Insight** is all-encompassing.

We arrange the incense sticks in abundance,
And kneel before the **True Immortals**,
Reflecting on our **Conduct and Concealments**—
Our countless lifetimes of encounters,
Our adherence to the **Transformations of Your Majesty**,
Our propagation of the **Winds of the Great Dao**,
Our blessings bestowed upon **Humans and Celestials**,
Our **Universal Beneficence in Life and Death**—
Since we first donned the **Feathers of Immortality**,
And stepped upon the **Star Altar**,
We have surpassed **Ten Years of Honor**,
And early been graced by the **Fortune of a Hundred Lifetimes**.

The **Fragrance of Incense** is offered with reverence and sincerity,
To pay homage to the **Nine Celestial Worthies** and **Ten Extremes**,
To the **Ten Thousand Saints** and **Thousand True Ones**,
And to beseech the **Divine Response** at the ritual feast.

We **humble ourselves**, lamenting that the **Three Passes** remain unsettled,
And that the **Single Nature** still lies in darkness.
Before our eyes, the **Five Desires** and **Six Emotions**—
How can we even briefly abandon them?
Within our bodies, the **Three Calamities** and **Nine Afflictions**—
How can we not feel shame at their approach?

Again, we fear that our learning is dimmed by **Divine Clarity**,
Our **Essential Teachings** obscured by dulled perception.
How can we recognize the **Principle of Forgetting the Trap**?
How can we enter the **Gate of Liberation from Illusion**?
Morning and evening, we ponder deeply—
To whom shall we first reveal our sincerity?

Thus, we devoutly adhere to the **ritual precepts and laws**,
And humbly present our **heartfelt petitions**,
To atone for past **transgressions and offenses**,
And to resolve future **calamities and encounters**.

We earnestly pray that **Great Benevolence** be widely bestowed,
And that **Divine Rain and Dew** shower their profound grace;
That **Abundant Blessings** extend far and wide,
And that **Mountain and River’s Favor** be generously bestowed.

May **Azure Dragon** and **White Tiger** ever provide **sheltering protection**,
And may **Luminous Crane** and **Mysterious Tortoise** grant **longevity and auspicious blessings**.

Again, we fear that gazing upon the stars and saints to touch the **Extraordinary Dao**,
Wearing strange garments and speaking of the **Way**,
**Exaggerates the Six Bandits** and **increases the Five Tastes**,
Disrespecting **Master and Sage**,
Lightly defying **Heaven and Earth**,
And **recklessly climbing**—
All of which harm the **sentient beings**.

We pray that through the **power of incense and flame**,
We may all attain the **path of dispelling calamities**,
And that the **Spiritual Passes** may be brightly illuminated,
Our **Enlightened Nature** made clear,
To obtain the **Scriptures of Eternal Life and Longevity**,
And to master the **Alchemy of the Golden Elixir**.

The **Precepts of our Ancestral Master** are followed,
And the **Teachings of our Lineage** are upheld.
All depart from the **Land of Darkness**,
And enter the **Realm of Clarity**.

**Flying, swimming, crawling, and moving creatures**,
All **sentient beings** with awareness,
Rely upon the **Dao’s Benevolence**,
And ascend together to the **Domain of Longevity**.

We, your humble disciples, gaze upon the **Law** with fixed attention,
And meditate upon the **Great Void**.
Deeply regretting the **dust of worldly affairs**,
We struggle to retain the **Divine Footsteps**.

Our **lower emotions** cannot bear the **longing for attachment**—
Thus, we bow in reverence and offer our **sincere devotion**.

**Offering the Sage**, **transforming wealth**.
**Forward and return**, **dedicating merit**.
The **Complete Collection of Daoist Ritual Precepts**, Volume Seventy-Three concludes.
The **Complete Collection of Daoist Ritual Precepts**, Volume Seventy-Four begins.

**Daoist Ritual of Repentance for Cultivators of the True Way**
**Repentance for Ignorance of the Dao**

**Eastward Repentance for the Sin of Not Knowing the Dao**

We, the humble Daoists bearing talismans, humbly hear that wood arises from the Three [Heavenly Stems], taking form beneath Heaven and Earth; the Sovereign emerges from *Zhen* [Thunder], nurturing all things in *Tun-Meng* [Difficulty and Obscurity]. The Azure Dragon governs the first key of the year, the Big Dipper marks the beginning of celestial passage, and the Minor Yang presides with boundless virtue beyond naming.

Now, we, the Daoists of such-and-such lineage, have long practiced purity in cultivation. In this lifetime, blessed by the Teacher’s grace, we have received transmission and uphold the teachings with reverence. Yet, we remain ashamed of our shallow roots and obstructed spiritual source.

Though we walk the Dao, we do not know it truly;
Though we nurture the form, we cannot forget it.
We move, yet cling to appearances.
Some boast in idle speech, self-satisfied;
Others hear the Dao yet grasp it faintly—now present, now absent.
Between wealth and poverty, we fail to equalize all things;
At the touch of joy, anger, likes, and dislikes, we burn with discord.

How then do we mingle with Heaven and humanity in the same path,
Realize the unity of birth and death,
Betray the Great Sage’s nurturing virtue,
Defy the Mysterious Teacher’s transformative precepts?
Thus, we are recorded in the Three Officials’ ledgers,
And our names are struck from the Five Emperors’ registers.

With deepest reverence, we now repent.
We humbly offer incense, flowers, and the rites of faith,
With sincere hearts turning to the East:
The **Supreme Soul of the Limitless, the Most High Treasure of Heaven**,
The **Nine-Qi Heavenly Sovereign**,
The **Eastern Court Immortals**,
And all **Spiritual Officials**.

We pray to the Most High Virtue, who cherishes life,
The Boundless Mercy that benefits all beings,
The Green Scriptures that pardon transgressions,
The Eastern Heavens that decree immortality—
Opening the heart to the Natural Void,
Granting the Dao of the Supreme One’s Embracing Truth.

Neither delayed nor hastened, it endures eternally;
Without gates or barriers, it permeates the Four Reaches.
Transforming the world, turning hearts toward the Dao,
Equalizing all under the Sage’s compassionate gaze.

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the Formless,
And harmonize with the True.

**Southward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying the Nation’s Grace**

We humbly hear that from the Void arises *Li* [Fire],
And all things emerge to grow and be nourished.
On the second day, Fire follows,
The Great Person continues the radiance, illuminating all.

From the Wood we receive transformation and nurture for all living beings,
By the Water we are shaped and refined in character and destiny.
The virtuous Sage draws upon these—
Great deeds accomplished through their embrace.

Now, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,
Born in the Central Land, steeped in the Sage’s radiance,
Bow to the Sovereign’s benevolent rule,
Hearing the people’s devotion and return.

Thus, we may bear the breath of purity,
And aid the Sage’s bright and virtuous way.

Yet, lingering in idle life, content with fleeting ease,
We lack the embrace of the Dao or cultivation of virtue to transform others,
Failing to restore the ancient simplicity or return to the uncarved,
Adorning worldly rites and seeking fame in mortal affairs,
Emptyly claiming the nation’s grace,
And presumptuously standing among the Daoist ranks.

Our names are not inscribed in the Southern Celestial Register,
And the Yin Mountains record our countless transgressions.

Only the Sage sits facing south to govern,
Only the nation’s great virtue commands Heaven’s mandate.
Having invoked the decree from the boundless sky,
We dare now submit our hearts to the stars’ appointed regions.

With utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,
And bow our sincerest vows to the **Southern** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,
The **Three Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,
The **Southern** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,
And all the **Spiritual Officials**.

We humbly acknowledge that **virtue** thrives in Fire,
The Sage turns toward radiance,
Granting longevity and reverence to all people,
Rooting blessings across generations.

Next, we pray that we Daoists with talismans at our sides,
May find pardon in the **Six Ministries**,
And receive the **Three Breaths’** luminous grace.

In our **inner alchemy**, may we **cultivate** the **Heart** with **emptiness**,
And **nourish** the **Spirit** so that it remains ever tranquil.
In the **outer alchemy** of summer, may we **harness** the **Yin**,
And **restrain** the Fire within so that it does not scatter.

Thus, we may **embrace** the **One** and **guard** the **Middle**,
And **hope** to attain **longevity** and **transcend** the world.

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

**Westward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying Ancestors’ and Parents’ Grace**

We humble ones hear that the **严凝** [austerity and solemnity] is **义** [righteous],
All things depend upon it to achieve their **西成** [westward fulfillment].

The **正** [upright] and **和** [harmonious] prevail,
The people return to the **兑说** [Joyful Teachings of the West].

First, it enforces **杀** [rigor and restraint] to aid the **Great Transformation**,
Later, it **静退** [withdraws in stillness] to manifest the **少阴** [Lesser Yin].

In accordance with Heaven and the people,
Firm within, yielding without.

Now, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,
Though lacking innate wisdom, we recognize the **大本** [Great Principles] of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust,
And through transmission, we point to the **真乘** [True Vehicle] of the Natural Void and purity.

Our **virtue** rivals that of Heaven and Earth,
Our **grace** surpasses that of parents.

Yet, we fail to uphold the **禁戒** [precepts],
And neglect the **禀修** [cultivation] of the Dao.
The **Eight Festivals** do not advance our **表章** [manifestation of virtue],
And the **Five Sacrifices** are not performed with **严** [rigor].

Though our **才分** [talents and fates] and **形器** [bodies and destinies] are bestowed by our parents’ life-giving grace,
Even across the ages, we have **亏** [failed] in our **子职** [duties as offspring].

Yet, parents’ love is tender and without reproach,
And Heaven and Earth are just yet without favor.

Our own sins cannot be escaped,
And **不孝** [filial disobedience] has no pardon.
Daring to forget repentance and atonement,
We now humbly confess our faults,
Sending our sincerity to the **七宝金门** [Golden Gate of the Seven Treasures],
And focusing our thoughts on the **西那玉国** [Jade Realm of the Western Retribution].

We seek the **境** [domain] of the **上智** [Superior Sage] to repay our **恩** [grace],
And rely upon the **元尊** [Primordial Venerable One]’s **说法** [teaching hall].

With utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,
And bow our sincerest vows to the **Western** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,
The **Seven Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,
The **Western** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,
And all the **Spiritual Officials**.

We humbly acknowledge the **金光** [Golden Light] that illuminates below,
The **玉简** [Jade Tablets] that clearly return our deeds.
Our ancestors all receive blessings of **升迁** [promotion and ascent],
Our parents each gain **殊胜** [exceptional merit].

Next, we pray that we Daoists with talismans at our sides,
May receive the **Western** **Tortoise’s** transmission of the Dao,
And visit the **仙母** [Immortal Mother] to refine our **甲庚** [first and sixth heavenly stems].

May the **金虎** [Golden Tiger] dwell in **离** [the Fire position],
And we **交** [interact] with the **真龙** [Authentic Dragon] to enter **戊己** [the Earth position].

Without **暴** [excessively] depleting our **气** [vitality],
May our **真元** [True Essence] be **守** [preserved],
And without **劳** [overworking] our **神** [Spirit],
May our **寿命** [lifespan] be **无期** [boundless].

Free from **魔试** [demonic temptations],
Our **心源** [source of the heart] may be **自定** [self-stabilized].

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

**Northward Repentance for the Sin of Not Repaying the Master’s Grace**

We humble ones hear that before the **太极** [Supreme Polarity] was divided,
It contained the **三才** [Three Powers: Heaven, Earth, Man] in **混沌** [primordial chaos].

When the **五行** [Five Phases] were distinguished,
They followed the **一炁** [Single Breath] in their **循环** [cyclical course].

The **阳** [Yang] lies dormant within,
And all things are **藏** [concealed].
The **辰** [stellar positions] reside in their places,
And the **众星** [multitudes of stars] bow in reverence,
The **枢机** [pivotal mechanisms] of transformation,
The **主宰** [lords] who govern all living beings.

Now, we humble Daoists with talismans at our sides,
Though lacking innate wisdom, we follow the Master’s guidance.
From the **训提** [early instruction],
We know the **大本** [Great Principles] of filial piety, fraternal duty, loyalty, and trust,
And through **传度** [transmission],
We are directed toward the **真乘** [True Vehicle] of the Natural Void and purity.

Our **德** [virtue] ascends to the heights of Heaven and Earth,
Our **恩** [grace] surpasses that of parents.

Yet, we fail to **尊承** [properly honor] the **素昧** [unseen and profound],
And our **给养** [nourishment] is insufficient.
We **负** [betray] the **抠衣授道** [Master’s humble teaching],
And **违** [violate] the **歃血引盟** [oath of blood and covenant].

We **泄** [leak] the **机微** [subtle secrets] to the **尘世** [mundane world],
And **传** [reveal] the **道** [Dao] to those **非人** [unworthy].

Even when **遇祸** [facing calamity] and **招殃** [inviting retribution],
We still **怨师** [blame the Master] and **咎道** [accuse the Dao],
Fearing our **罪书** [record of sins] in the **九府** [Nine Palaces],
And dreading our **身谢** [life’s termination] at the hands of the **三官** [Three Officials].

We believe that to **迎师** [invite the Master] is to face north in **尊崇** [reverence],
Thus, we confess our faults and plead with the **坎宫** [Kan Palace of the North].

With utmost reverence, we offer incense, flowers, scriptures, and devotional rites,
And bow our sincerest vows to the **Northern** Boundless **Supreme** **Jewel** **Heavenly** **Venerable** **Lord**,
The **Five Breaths** Heavenly Sovereign,
The **Northern** **Mansion** **Divine** **Immortal**,
And all the **Spiritual Officials**.

We humbly acknowledge that the **北辰** [Northern Dipper] holds the **仙名** [names of the Immortals],
And the **壁宿** [Wall Constellations] oversee the **道术** [arts of the Dao].

The **宗师** [Master] transmits the Dao,
And **永隆** [eternally upholds] the **弘教** [great teaching].
Through **保举** [recommendation] and **监盟** [oversight of covenants],
They **益务** [further strive] to **成人之美** [fulfill the potential of others].

Without a **师** [Master], there is no **度** [transmission],
And even the **有翼** [winged] must **飞** [soar].
All together we aspire to the **功行** [meritorious deeds],
And share in the **升仙** [ascension to immortality] **果** [realization].

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

**Northeastward Repentance for the Sin of Imperfect Teaching and Transmission**

We humble ones hear that the **神功** [Divine Function] does not **宰** [rule],
It serves as the **始终** [beginning and end] of Heaven and Earth.
The **妙本** [Wondrous Source] is **自然** [self-so],
It governs the **动止** [movement and rest] of **阴阳** [Yin and Yang].

We stretch forth the **Hand of Transformation** [伸其转物之手],
And bestow the **Dragon of Emergence** [授以出震之龙],
Its **changes and constancies** [变化有常] are **unforced** [推移不武].

Now, we sincerely present **Daoists bearing talismans and scriptures** [有佩箓道士某等],
As **descendants of the Most High** [太上之子],
And **proponents of the Daoist tradition** [道家者流],
Yet we have not **hidden in secluded valleys to preserve the spirit** [隐谷以存神],
Nor **abided in quietude to expound the teachings** [约以居寂而演教].
Instead, our **sincere hearts grow scattered** [诚心易散],
And **wondrous methods prove difficult to refine** [妙法难精].
Our **doctrines lack coherence** [宣科而条理乖张],
And our **conduct falters in dignity** [临事而威仪跛倚],
While the **Six Demons** [六魔] mock our **erroneous practices** [想法乱],
And the **Ten Thousand Spirits** [万神] refuse to dwell where our **meditation is deficient** [存思缺].

Our **endeavors are feeble** [力么微],
And we **lean neither on the profound nor the manifest** [幽明无所依赖];
Our **nature and emotions are disordered** [性情挠乱],
Making **communication with Heaven and humanity arduous** [天人难以感通].
Unable to **bridge the sacred and the mundane** [契圣以契凡],
How can we **fulfill the Dao’s purpose for all beings** [孰为成物而成务]?

We fear the **records of the Dark Classics** [黑书] may **note our faults** [纪过],
And dread that the **registers of immortals** [仙籍] may **sever our merit** [断功].
In **humility and negligence**, we confess our failings [苟慢自陈],
Lest we **incur celestial censure** [贻阴谴].

With **devoted offerings of incense, flowers, and sincere vows** [香花拷信供养之仪],
We **wholeheartedly submit** [至心归命] to the **Most High Sovereign of the Primordial Dao** [东北方无极太上灵宝天尊],
The **Celestial Lord of the Five Essences** [梵炁天君],
The **Divine Immortals of the East-North** [东北方神仙],
And the **Assemblage of Spirits** [诸灵官].

We **solemnly beseech** [仰惟] the **Four Celestial Overseers** [申敕四司],
And **hear the commandments of the Nine Celestial Departments** [告闻九府],
That our **meritorious deeds may accumulate** [复功行於铢积寸累],
And our **transgressions be pardoned** [赦过尤]—
**Like clouds dispersed by mist** [雾卷云披].

May **celestial intent be conveyed through speech** [驿意传言],
And **resonance ascend to the Divine** [感应声而上彻];
May our **petitions reach the heights** [升章谒款],
So that our **wishes may align** [俾随愿以克谐].

Then, we **elevate our aspirations to the heavens** [抗志云阿],
And **dwell in mountain caverns** [栖身山洞],
Achieving **effortless transcendence above the age** [得逍遥於一世之上],
And **resting the Wheel of Rebirth within the Three Realms** [息轮转於三界之中].

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

**East-Southward Repentance for the Sin of Neglecting the Sacred Scriptures, Precepts, and Talismans**

We humble ones hear that the **Primordial Transformation** [元化] **shapes existence** [裁形],
And there must be **those who uphold its authority** [必有主张之者];
The **Numinous Wind** [灵风] **nurtures all things** [煦物],
And the **Celestial Bureaus** [皇司] hold **commanding sway** [命令之权].

**East-Southward Repentance for Neglecting Sacred Scriptures, Precepts, and Talismans**

Harmonizing with the **Receptive** [Xún] and resounding with **flourishing brilliance** [振美盛明],
Assisted by the **Sieve** [Jī] to gather and disperse, **nurturing and inspiring** [歙扬鼓舞],
The **Great Virtue** remains hidden, unknown to the common folk.

Now, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士], of humble birth and mortal form [挺质凡胎],
Shelter beneath the **Dao’s shelter** [栖身道荫],
Wander through the **ornate halls of the Dao** [优游琳宇],
Yet sometimes fail in **diligence in burning and refining** [或不谨於焚修];
Left and right, the **sacred texts** [洞章] are not held with **due reverence** [或不严於敬重].
We bear talismans yet **transgress ranks and order** [佩箓而踰阶越次],
Hold fasts yet **disrupt days and times** [持斋而废日乱时].
Officials, soldiers, and clerks—**three assemblies** [三会]—speak not of merit and reward;
**Gowned and armed**, we dwell yet **often mingle with the profane** [常居而多见混淆].
Our **Daoic power is weak and shallow** [道力寡浅],
While **ghosts and demons assail us** [而尸鬼交攻];
Our **precepts are slight and feeble** [戒行细微],
And the **numinous protection fails** [而威神不护].
We **master the scriptures yet distort their essence** [通经而驳杂本旨], clinging to petty wisdom;
We **teach the Dao yet cloak ourselves in empty words** [行教而□袭浮辞], failing to embody the **Great Purity** [大淳未至].
Thus, we **serve Heaven yet see no response** [奉天而事无响应],
And **violate the laws, bearing guilt from birth** [违科而罪与生俱].

We now **offer the rites of repentance** [用陈忏谢之仪],
Hoping for **forgiveness and grace** [以冀赦原之泽].
With **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],
We **devoutly submit** to the **East-Southward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],
The **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],
The **East-Southward Immortal Deities** [东南乡神仙],
And the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].
We **humble ourselves**, trusting in **divine mercy** [仰冀圣慈赦宥],
That **spiritual grace may gradually transform us** [灵泽渐陶].
May the **thunder move and the winds race** [雷动风驰],
Dissolving our **multitudinous faults** [散愆尤之纷委];
May the **clear waters and clouds moisten** [清渊云润],
Nurturing our **reverent and composed thoughts** [沃念虑之恭庄].
Thus may we **preserve the True Essence of life** [使保全性命之真],
And **harmonize with the unity of Heaven and humanity** [遂和同天人之际].
May the **Divine Followers of the Talismans** [随符仙从] and **Numinous Protective Officials** [护法灵官]
Record our **meritorious service** [录显绩之服劳],
And **advocate for our Daoic ascension** [计仙真之保奏].
After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

**West-Southward Repentance for Failing to Cultivate Humility in Interacting with Others**

We, the humble ones, hear that **Heaven’s decree is supremely orderly** [承天至顺],
And **Yang vigor shapes existence** [配刚健以成形];
The **Earth’s reach is boundless** [行地无疆],
Its **encompassing virtue nurtures all** [扩含弘而役物].
**Yin’s merit is immeasurable** [阴功莫大],
And **great virtue is beyond name** [厚德难名].

Now, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士],
Endowed with the **five elements’ refinement** [禀秀五行],
Possessing **solitary numinous essence** [独灵万物],
Though born of dust, we **entered the Dao’s gate** [均有生於尘世，幸入道於玄门],
Yet **should have cultivated self-transformation** [益宜自化以修心],
So as to **receive others with emptiness** [庶可虚含而接物].

Instead, we **fail to govern our qi** [自以不能御气],
And **yield to emotion** [动必纵情],
Our **heart unharmonized, clashing with others** [不和其心而与物交争],
Our **body unyielding, defying the world** [不顺其身而与世相忤].
We **lack enduring virtue** [无一德而为常安之术],
And when **two passions meet, we spew malicious words** [合两怒则多溢恶之言].
We **defend our flaws, unaware of our own failings** [护短而己不自知],
And **harbor grudges, though others resent us** [敛怨而人岂无憾].
Our **errant thoughts harm the harmonious qi** [缪於心而伤和气],
And our **reckless speech defiles the Daoic body** [溺於言而污法身].
We **stand beside others yet fail to transform them** [与人并立而无以化人],
And though we **nourish the form with false Dao** [伪道养形],
We **have not yet attained the Dao itself** [未能造道].

We **dare not deceive ourselves** [敢昧自欺之过],
Lest we **invite Heaven’s retribution** [以贻天降之殃].
We **confess our guilt first** [敬负罪以首陈],
And **solemnly vow to amend** [誓责躬而悛改].

With **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],
We **devoutly submit** to the **West-Southward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],
The **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],
The **West-Southward Immortal Deities** [西南乡神仙],
And the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].
We **trust in the Receptive’s perfect fidelity** [仰惟坤仪至信],
And the **Earth’s Dao of humility** [地道流谦],
Hoping to **share in the radiant virtue of bearing all** [愿分厚德载物之休光],
That we may **constantly practice saving others** [使有常善救人之功用].
May our **Daoic nature be pure and luminous** [虚明道性],
And **all contradictions harmonized** [一顺逆以和融];
May our **refined thoughts and speech be steadfast** [粹熟心声],
And our **mechanisms of conduct be stable** [谨枢机而安定].
May **blessings naturally arrive** [福将自至],
And **calamity find no cause to arise** [祸莫由生].
We further **pray for unshakable compassion** [更祈不动之仁],
And **complete forgiveness for past transgressions** [尽赦从前之罪].

After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the **Formless**,
And harmonize with the **True**.

---

**West-Northward Repentance for Misusing Heaven’s Symbols and Earth’s Patterns in Invoking Spirits**

We, the humble ones, hear that the **Supreme Ultimate contains the Three** [太极含三],
And the **Two Principles divide to establish order** [两仪判而定位];
The **Heavenly Principle manifests the Nine** [乾元用九],
And **all things perceive and take form** [万物睹而流形].
With **One Qi preserved in purity** [得一气以贞纯],
We **ride the Flying Dragon without ceasing** [御飞龙而不息],
**Unfolding into the trigrams** [发挥入卦],
And **preserving the Great Harmony** [保合太和].

Now, we, the **Daoist adepts bearing talismans** [佩箓道士],
With **lofty aspirations for the Mysterious** [宅志希夷],
And **hearts wandering in the boundless** [游心浩素],
Store **divine essence within** [内存神而炼道]
And **practice teaching to transform others** [外行教以化人].
Though the **ritual implements exist** [虽科法之具存],
They are **not the task of the common** [岂凡庸之是任].

Yet, with **form and spirit most impure** [重以形神至浊],
And **Daoic practice unheard** [道行无闻],
We **adorn our caps with star patterns** [攒星斗於峨冠],
And **embellish our robes with cloud-and-mist designs** [饰云霞於羽服].
We **tread upon the Pole Star’s might** [蹑魁罡於履屐之下],
Yet our **roots are earthly and our deeds mundane** [地秽人凡];
We **command spirits and ghosts** [驱神鬼於掌握之中],
Yet our **merit is slight and virtue thin** [功微德薄].
We **tread the Eight Trigrams’ patterns on the altar** [践八卦之文於坛墠],
And **descend the Ten Directions’ qi into our bodies** [降十方之气於身田].
Sometimes we **nurture the prenatal breath in the Three Primordials** [或养胎息於三元],
**Stealing the essence of Yin and Yang** [暗窃阴阳之气];
Sometimes we **refine the inner elixir in the Nine Transformations** [或炼内丹於九转],
**Chasing the light of sun and moon** [高奔日月之光].
We are **no true Daoist forms** [素非仙相之人],
Yet **presume to learn the Saints’ great deeds** [冒学圣功之道].
**No act is without presumption** [无非僭越],
And **we have offended the Radiant Spirits** [有犯光灵].
We **now humbly confess our transgressions** [敬伸忏谢之诚],
Seeking to **atone for our faults** [以这谴尤之责].

With **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],
We **devoutly submit** to the **West-Northward Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [无极太上灵宝天尊],
The **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],
The **West-Northward Immortal Deities** [西北乡神仙],
And the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].
We **trust in the Heavenly Principle’s vigor** [仰惟乾元至健],
And that **Heaven’s Dao is not defied** [天道弗违].
May we be **granted pure Yang** [锡以纯阳],
To **exchange our earthly, vulgar bones** [为换尘凡之胎骨];

「Revealing the essential Dao/Way, so that one may know the fundamental source of **transformation into Immortality** [仙化].
**The Four Bodies** [四体] are harmonious and at peace,
**The Hundred Spirits** [百神] are firmly ensconced.
Thus, **all who diligently cultivate the Higher Laws** [庶精修於上法]
May achieve **no shame in their prior merits** [得无愧於前功].

After attaining the Dao/Way,
One ascends into **Formlessness** [无形],
And **harmony unites with the True Dao/Way** [和与道合真].
**We of the lower realms** [下方] now confess our transgressions:
From ages past, we have **offended the Three Radiant Lights** [冒犯三光],
Ignorant of the **Heavenly Covering** [覆载].
**All of us** [众等] have heard in awe:
**Brahmanic Qi** [梵炁] extends to **Maha-Brahman** [弥罗],
Reaching the **Supreme Void** [上极虚无] of the highest realm.
The **Primordial Principles** [元纲] flow and manifest,
Transforming into **the myriad eons of Heaven** [化开万亿之天].

**Oh, the Venerable Dao/Way’s grandeur** [洪惟至道之尊]!
It governs **the Natural Transformations** [统御自然之化],
Its **Divine Powers** [神功] are everlasting,
And **its vast efficacy** [浩劫] endures eternally.

Now, **we humble Daoist officials bearing talismans** [有佩箓道士某等],
From **the beginningless** [无始] to the **manifested** [有形],
Have **one numinous essence** [一灵] diminished and lost,
Unable to return to the **five primordial purities** [五太之淳].
**The Six Bandits** [六贼] have clouded our minds,
Bringing upon ourselves the **karmic burdens of the Three Realms** [三生之业].

We have **soared beyond the Desire Realm and Form Realm** [超於欲界色界],
Yet **fallen back into the Wheel of Rebirth** [复堕轮回].
We have **practiced the causes of the Lesser and Middle Vehicles** [修於小乘中乖],
Yet **ourselves generated decline and backsliding** [自生退转].
Some have **dwelled in the Central Lands** [居中土] but **failed to return to their origins** [本原不返],
Others have **journeyed to distant realms** [处殊方] yet **the Dao/Way’s teachings remain unheard** [声教无闻].

The **Great Vehicle’s Dao/Way** [大乘之道] is hard to fulfill,
And the **karmic cycles of the Three Realms** [三界之业] are easily perpetuated.
**Bearing Heaven above and Earth below** [戴天履地],
**Embracing Yin and Yang** [负阴抱阳],
We have **failed to repay the Heavenly Grace** [莫酬覆焘之恩],
And **every action brings guilt and offense** [动有乖张之罪].

We have **missed the four seasons’ harmonious shifts** [四序寒暄之愆],
And **lament the Heavenly timing** [嗟怨天时].
We have **contradicted the luminous courses of the Three Celestial Marks** [逆三辰经纬之昭明],
And **offended the Radiant Dao/Way’s light** [犯冲光景].

Our **sins span countless lifetimes** [逆数千生之罪],
And **our transgressions fill myriad kinds** [贯盈万种之愆].
From this day onward, **we seek renewal** [自此自新],
And **pray for Your boundless forgiveness** [愿垂肆赦].

With **incense, flowers, and offerings of faith** [谨赍香花法信供养之仪],
We **devoutly submit** to the **Supreme Sovereign of the Numinous Treasure** [上方无极太上灵宝天尊],
The **Thirty-Six Heavenly Emperors** [三十六天帝君],
The **Jade Capital of the Immortals** [玉京仙都],
The **Purple Forbidden Enclosure and Golden Celestial Gate** [紫微金阙],
The **Three Pure Ones of the Three Realms** [三清三界],
The **Celestial Qi Sovereign** [梵炁天君],
The **Divine Deities of the Upper Realm** [上乡神仙],
And the **Numinous Officials** [诸灵官].

We **aspire to the Great Dao/Way’s benevolent proclamation** [仰冀大道宣慈],
And **pray for the High True Ones’ compassionate regard** [高真垂悯].
May You **forgive the ten directions’ worlds** [下十方之世界],
And **pardon our myriad eons of transgression** [赦万劫之愆尤].

**Purple Forbidden and Supreme Mysterious** [紫微太微],
**Urge the auspicious moment for ascension** [催促举仙之运].
**Southern and Northern Dipper** [南斗北斗],
**Dispel the calamities of our lifespans** [解消临命之灾].

May **our Primordial Essence** [元精] be **full within the Mudball** [满於泥丸],
And **our True Qi** [真炁] be **congealed in the Numinous Palace** [凝於灵府].
May **Divine Light** [神明] **descend and dwell** within us,
And **our organs and viscera** [脏腑] be **cleansed and cool** [清凉].
May **our wisdom-nature** [慧性] be **illuminated and bright** [高明],
And **our blessings and karmic connections** [福缘] be **exceptional** [殊胜].
May we **receive the descent of the Perfect Ones** [得至人之降接],
And be **guided in the profound mysteries of Daoist learning** [指道学之玄微].
May we **transform all sentient beings** [回化有情],
And **together ascend to the state of Non-Defilement** [同登无漏].

After attaining the Dao/Way,
One **ascends into Formlessness** [升入无形],
And **harmony unites with the True Dao/Way** [和与道合真].
**We of the lower realms** [下方] now confess our transgressions:
**Harming living beings and injuring life** [害物伤生之罪].

The multitude humbly hears that the Great Square without corners
Expands the eight strings and bears them thickly;
The Original Form governs the earth, containing all things to transform and give birth.

Now, the sovereign of the Later Soil, who holds authority,
Distributes the duties of the hundred spirits.
Without speech, yet trustworthy—
With One, all is at peace.

Now, we, the humble Daoist adepts bearing talismans, certain in name,
Were born in the chaos of the beginning,
Lost the Dao in the aftermath of Honghuang.
Ren, yi, li, zhi arose alongside great falsehood;
The wise and foolish, the good and evil, received their nature from Heaven’s spontaneity.
We were born as those who abandoned the root,
Our actions ever stained by greed for life.
We rely on all things for sustenance,
Yet fail to recognize the恩 of the covering and bearing.
We indulge our selfish ease,
Unmindful of those who suffer hunger and cold.
We gluttonously indulge in desires of mouth and belly,
And recklessly harm living beings.
We flaunt the beauty of adornments and luxuries,
And wrongly destroy the formed.
We know not to turn inward,
And this becomes our habitual nature.

The five peaks and four great rivers hold records of our crimes—
A tangled web of offenses.
The officials of the Black Registers and the Yin Valley
Pile up our dark deeds.

Fortunately, in this age, we take refuge under the Dao’s shelter,
Confessing our myriad sins of past lives before the Mysterious Tribunal,
Vowing to cultivate the future,
Hoping to reach a state without fault.

With solemn offerings of incense, flowers, and the rites of faith,
We wholeheartedly submit to the **Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerable of the Lower Realm’s Limitless Extremes**,
The High Sovereign of the Nine Soils,
The Twelve Immortals,
The Most Numinous Later Soil,
The Four Great Rivers and Five Peaks,
The Lower Realm’s world,
All Immortals and Spirits,
All Numinous Officials.

We humbly pray that all spirits respond to our sincerity,
That their virtue is vast and their mercy boundless,
That they extend the boundless grace of forgiveness,
Pardon our boundless transgressions,
And awaken compassionate intentions,
Unleashing the source of blessings.

May stillness and gentleness prevail,
Harmonizing with all without obstruction;
May emptiness and purity be attained,
Swiftly realizing the Dao and attaining longevity.

From the highest reaches of the Azure Palace to the deepest depths of the Yellow Springs,
May all return to their roots,
And all things flourish in life.

After attaining the Dao,
One ascends into Formlessness,
And harmony unites with the True Dao.

*The Dao Gate’s Comprehensive Regulations, Volume Seventy-Four ends.
The Dao Gate’s Comprehensive Regulations, Volume Seventy-Five begins.*

May the teachings of Master Guangcheng (杜光庭) be followed,
*The Ritual of Ascension and Divine Transformation at the Upper Clarity Dao/Way Hall of the Transcended Immortals*
This ritual employs the **Yellow Arrow** (黄箓) to cultivate the True Dao of the Ten Precepts (十戒),
and the **Hosted Initiation** (明真宿启) to perform the rites—
the ancient rites of the Five Refining (五炼) for generating the sacred body (生尸).

The **Hosted Initiation** (宿启) is thus the means
to invoke the souls of those who have been **transcended and drawn forth** (迁拔),
or **extinguished and liberated** (灭度).

Master Wanfu (万福天师) composed *The Ritual for Fellow Dao Seekers* (《同学行道仪》),
which mandates that from the onset of suffering to the final passing,
one must **confess and repent** (忏谢),
**rescue and draw forth** (救拔),
**alleviate calamities** (解灾),
and **regret past transgressions** (悔过).

Indeed, to **cultivate the Dao and ascend as an immortal** (修道升仙),
one must not rely on oneself alone—**a master is required to guide** (非师不度);
to **transcend the mundane and attain sainthood** (超凡证圣),
one must not act alone—**a fellow Dao seeker is essential** (非友不成).

A master is like **parental figures** (父母),
and fellow Dao seekers are like **brothers** (兄弟).
How can one, lacking **reverence and filial devotion** (不敬孝),
**friendship and love** (不友爱),
or **compliance and accord** (不承顺和悦),
follow their teachings?

When **masters and fellow Dao seekers** depart,
leaving kin and kindred behind,
dwelling in **mountains and forests** (栖庇山林),
with **flesh and bone distant** (骨肉远矣),
and **affection now sparse** (亲爱疏矣),
upon their **illness or decline** (修短有常),
when they **pass away** (奄从沦化),
one must **recite scriptures and perform Dao rites** (诵经行道),
**offer petitions and memorials** (拜章上表),
**confess sins and atone for faults** (忏罪谢愆),
and **assist in their transcendence and liberation** (以相迁度).

In matters of **life and death and Dao principles** (生死道义),
this is the foremost duty.

Should a **master or fellow Dao seeker perish** (沦没),
all **disciples and fellow Dao seekers** must **assemble in unison** (齐集),
and designate the **highest in virtue** (高德者) as the **ritual leader** (法师).
The rest shall follow in **ranked order** (依位次第),
**purifying themselves through bathing and changing robes** (沐浴更衣).
Then, a **sacrificial platform may be erected** (可设坛出官),
and the **rites of invocation and exorcism** (关启) conducted.

In cases of **urgent sickness or dire peril** (疾厄危切),
or **grievous loss and profound sorrow** (亡殁极伤),
one must **immediately perform the rites** (应急就修),
without awaiting the **Hosted Initiation** (不须宿启).
Each shall **stand in their appointed rank** (各在依位),
and **fulfill their designated duties** (主其职司).

If the rites are to be **conducted as a Hosted Initiation** (宿启),
then they shall proceed **according to established methods** (即依常法).

**Morning rites for the Dao:**
The **ritual proceedings commence upon the platform** (法事升坛如式).
Each **offers homage to the master’s lingering essence** (各礼师存念如法).
The **exorcising incantations** (卫灵咒) are proclaimed.

The **Golden Truth Record** (金真录霞) shines radiant,
illuminating the **Three Heavens** (三天).
**Flying Clouds ascend to the Azure Expanse** (丹霄),
as the **hosts of all the heavens** (诸天) **control their celestial wheels** (控轮).
At dawn’s first light (晨晖启旦),
all **shadows and obscurations** (阴翳) are dispelled.

The **Nine Mysterious Winds** (九微) shake the void,
as the **Five Stars** (五星) **revolve in harmony** (回旋).
The **Ten Thousand Heavens** (万天) respond in kind,
manifesting **wondrous and profound mysteries** (自然妙玄).

The **dim and obscure** (杳冥) scatter into myriad forms (分形百千).
The **Dark Pearl** (玄珠) gleams with splendor,
as **auspicious signs descend upon the sacrificial altar** (瑞降坛乾).
The **hidden and the luminous** (幽明) receive **divine grace** (蒙惠),
purified by the **Golden Spring** (金泉).

The **demonic king** (魔王) trembles in fear,
as the **Three Radiant Fields of Light** (合景三田) align,
and **harmony unites with the True Dao** (与道合真).

The **Supreme Law Drum** (法鼓) is struck **twenty-four times** (二十四通).

The **Three Highest Heavens** (三天)—
**Primordial Beginning Heavenly Sovereign** (玄元始天尊),
**Supreme Dao Lord** (太上道君),
**Supreme Old Lord** (太上老君)—
**summon forth** (召出) their **subordinate officials** (臣等),
the **Three Five Functionaries** (三五功曹) within our bodies,
**left and right celestial attendants** (左右官使者),
**left and right incense bearers** (左右捧香),
**Dragon Couriers and mounted officers** (驿龙骑吏),
**Attendant Golden Boys** (侍香金童),
**Messenger Jade Girls** (传言散花玉女),
the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols** (五帝直符),
and the **Direct Day Incense Officials** (直日香官),
totaling **thirty-six** (三十六人).

Those summoned **array themselves in solemn attire** (严装显服),
**adorned with crowns and sashes** (冠带垂缨),
and **invoke the sacred platform’s earthly and celestial deities** (关启玄坛土地，方域神真).

Today, at this **morning of purity** (清旦),
we **burn incense and perform the Dao rites** (烧香行道),
**devotedly offering this as an act of sincerity** (谨奉为入意).
All **earnest sentiments** (诸情悃) have been **recorded and presented** (已录奏闻).
We humbly pray that the **Supreme Ten Directions’ Most Authentic Dao Essence** (十方至真道炁),
the **Spiritual Treasure’s Auspicious Light** (灵宝瑞光),
may **descend and flow into our bodies** (下降，流入臣身中),
so that our **invocation** (所启)
may **swiftly reach the Supreme Limitless Dao** (径御太上无极大道),
the **Celestial Jade Sovereign of the Highest Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝),
and the **Sovereign of the Eastern Extremity, the Green Heavens, who rescues suffering** (东极救苦青玄上帝).

We request **the proclamation of our ritual ranks** (请称法位).

**The assembled officials** (具位臣某与合坛官众等),

**The Thunderous Divine Tiger, the Great Physician, and all subordinate officials and soldiers** (雷霆神虎大医诸司官将),
**The Immortal Officials and Soldiers from the Supreme Stages of Scripture and Arrow** (太上诸阶经箓中仙官吏兵),
**The Immortal Deities of All Famous Mountains and Caverns** (天下名山洞府得道神仙),
**The Great Emperor of the Underworld, the Acid Fields** (地府酆都大帝),
**The Sacred Hosts of the Shadow Realm** (幽阴圣众),
**The Great Emperor of the Water Fields, the Exalted Phoenix** (水府扶桑大帝),

**The Divine Clerks who Record and Present Memorials and Offerings** (誊奏表钱神吏),
**The Ritual Master of the Feast** (醮筵主宰),
and **all True Immortals** (一切真仙).

**With reverence and humility** (恭望洪慈),
we **seek the penetrating and manifesting gaze** (洞回昭鉴).

We, **lowly and humble mortals** (微生贱质),
**erroneously partaking in the Dao’s flow** (谬预法流),
**early attuned to the divine promise** (早契神期),
**devotedly follow the profound mysteries** (奉遵玄秘).

「Not yet able to transcend the physical form and dwell beyond the material world,
to vanish within the forests and mountains,
to practice the Dao and ponder its mysteries,
to study and master its essential subtleties.

We merely follow human customs,
using incense and fire as our means of merit,
to rescue and deliver those trapped in the **Netherworld** (幽涂),
to elevate them to higher realms.
On the day we received the **Law** (法),
we solemnly pledged to uphold and practice it,
to save both humans and celestial beings,
to proclaim the **Great Dao** (洪道德).

How much more so when we now present our **petition** (词旨),
how dare we not humbly submit it?

We **solemnly present our petition** (宣词).
In accordance with the **petition’s intent** (词旨),
our hearts are filled with deep longing and reverence.

Thus, we **devoutly gather and lead** (携率),
strictly adhering to the **ritual ordinances** (典仪),
and **pay homage to the Ten Directions** (十方),
**secretly invoking the Three Treasures** (三宝),
**observing the fast and practicing the Dao** (修斋行道),
to **entreat the Mandate** (请命) and **implore mercy** (祈哀).

May the **Supreme Dao** (至道) extend its grace,
and **compassionately pardon all beings** (哀原群品),
both **dark offenses** (阴罪) and **bright transgressions** (阳过),
all imploring forgiveness and absolution.

Grant that we may ascend to the **Daoist Realms** (仙都),
elevate to the **Divine Upper Realms** (上境),
and **proclaim your boundless deliverance** (洪济),
though but slightly **assuaging our lamentations** (副哀鸣).

With this **clear morning** (清旦) as we practice the Dao,
we **entreat the Law Assembly** (法众) to **offer this first incense** (初捻上香).
May this incense smoke **soar directly to the heavens** (腾空径上),
to **venerate the Three Supreme Ones** (太上三尊),
as we **wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives** (至心皈身、皈神、皈命).

With these merits,
we **dedicate them to our ancestral Daoist lineage** (宗祧先圣),
to the **sacred spirits of the land and grain** (社稷尊灵),
to **command the morning mists** (控御晨霞),
to **feast in the celestial heights** (宴游霄极),
to **broadly spread your virtue and blessings** (旁敷德泽),
and to **multiply our roots and branches** (蕃大本支).

May the **Emperor’s sacred lifespan be prolonged** (皇帝圣寿延长),
and the **two luminaries** (二景) be **harmonized in brightness** (明齐);
May the **virtuous winds of benevolence be pure and deep** (仁风淳厚),
and the **Emperor’s virtue surpass the Three Dynasties** (德迈三宗).

The customs of the people flourish in peace, and weapons rest in stillness.
Now, we burn incense to **wholeheartedly devote ourselves** (皈依) to the **Dao/Way’s Most Venerable Great Saints, the Most True Ones** (道尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the **Formless**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).

With this **pure morning Dao/Way practice** (清旦行道), we invite the **assembly of the Law** (法众) to offer this **second incense** (二捻上香).
May this incense smoke **soar directly to the heavens** (腾空径上) and **venerate the Dao/Way’s Most Venerable Scriptures** (供养大道尊经).
We **wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives** (至心皈身、皈神、皈命).
With these merits, we dedicate them to **the Dao/Way’s transformation of [name]** (仙化某), extending to the **Three Teachers and Mysterious Ancestors** (洎三师玄祖), and the **predeceased of both Law and俗** (法俗先亡).

May we **wander as spirits at the Purple Extremity** (游神紫极), **refine our essence at Broad Cold** (镈质广寒), **roam freely in the Celestial Courtyard of Azure Void** (逍遥碧落之庭), and **wander at will in the Three Pure Realms** (纵适三清之境).
May we **dispel lawsuits and disputes** (消除冢讼) and **shelter and protect our disciples** (庇佑门徒).

Now, we burn incense once more to **wholeheartedly devote ourselves** to the **Dao/Way’s Most Venerable Great Saints, the Most True Ones** (经尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the **Formless**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).

With this **pure morning Dao/Way practice** (清旦行道), we invite the **assembly of the Law** (法众) to offer this **third incense** (三捻上香).
May this incense smoke **soar directly to the heavens** (腾空径上) and **venerate the Three Most Venerable Teachers** (供养太上三师).
We **wholeheartedly devote our bodies, spirits, and lives** (至心皈身、皈神、皈命).
With these merits, we dedicate them to **disciple [name]** (弟子某).

May our **Dao/Way practice daily renew itself** (道业日新), our **wisdom-lamp be boundless** (智灯无量),
our **mind open and intent resolved** (心开意解), our **body comprehend Nature** (体悟自然),
our **Dao/Way practice achieve Truehood** (学道成真), and our **name be inscribed on the Celestial Register** (名题青箓).
May the **cosmos be serene and still** (观宇肃静), and all—great and small—be at peace (大小咸宁).

Now, we burn incense once more to **wholeheartedly devote ourselves** to the **Teacher’s Most Venerable Great Saints, the Most True Ones** (师尊大圣众至真之德).
After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the **Formless**, harmonizing with the **True Dao/Way** (和与道合真).
**Repentance, command the demons, tread the Void, and perform the Three Bowings** (忏方，命魔，步虚，三礼).
**Reaffirm the Law’s station** (重称法位).

We, **officer [name] of the prescribed rank**, along with the **assembled officials of the altar** (合坛官众等),
**solemnly and sincerely address** (谨重诚上启):
**The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Empty-Nothingness and Naturalness** (虚无自然元始天尊),
**The Most High Dao/Way Lord** (太上大道君),
**The Most High Laozi** (太上老君),
**The Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven** (昊天玉皇上帝),
**The Heavenly Sovereign of the Gourd Cluster** (勾陈天皇大帝),
**The Supreme Sovereign of the Northern Pole** (北极紫微上帝),
**The Great Emperor Who Registers Life of the Southern Pole** (南极注生大帝),
**The Supreme Sovereign of the Eastern Pole, the Green Heavenly Worthy Who Saves from Suffering** (东极救苦青玄上帝),
**The Earthly Sovereign Who Follows Heaven’s Law** (承天效法后土皇地祇),
**the Highest Worthies of the Round Canopy above** (上穷圆盖之高真),
**and the Masters of the Square Compass below** (下极方舆之主宰),
**both the Spirited and the Sacred** (有灵有圣),
**the Teachers and Ancestral Lineages of past and present** (今古师宗),
**the Masters of the Ritual Feast** (醮筵主宰),
**all belonging to the True Worthies** (合属真仙).

**Reverently gazing upon your boundless mercy** (恭望洪慈), we **pray for your enlightened response** (洞回昭格).
We, born of the **three luminaries** (育质三光), shaped by the **nine breaths/qi** (造形九炁),
**mere mortal forms of filth and decay** (凡胎尸秽), **leaky and empty in essence** (漏质庸虚),
though **blessed with past merits** (宿庆弥纶), now **encounter the Dao/Way’s era** (兹逢道运).
Fortunate to be born in this **Sage’s age** (圣代), we **early donned the Yellow Robes** (蚤佩黄裳),
**bathed in the Great Pardon’s grace** (沐大宥之垂休), and **witnessed the True Scriptures’ aid to the world** (睹真经之辅世).
Though unworthy, we **presume to uphold the Sacred Pledge** (叨逢秘检，缪奉丹盟),
**dare to assume the Law’s duties** (不揆凡材，辄居法任),
**study the Classics and refine our arts** (科文肄业),
and **devote our incense and fire with sincerity** (香火倾心),
**for ourselves and others**, seeking **mercy and blessings** (祈恩请福).

Now, **disciple [name]**, having **reverently taken [name] as the Dao/Way’s transformative Teacher** (奉为仙化本师某),
**early followed the Teacher’s guidance** (早从师范) and **revered the True Worthies** (宗奉仙真),
though our **incense and fire were sincere**, our **form and spirit remain unrefined** (形神未炼),
our **spiritual roots unstable** (灵根不固), and our **heavenly fate limited** (天运有终).
We **fear that our lifetimes’ deeds** may **transgress the True Laws** (悮犯真科),
**offend the Divine** (抵触神明), **dare to provoke Heaven and Earth** (冒干天地),
**violate prohibitions** (违越禁忌), and thus **invite this calamity and decline** (构此凶衰).

We also **fear the mutual clashes of the Six Li and Five Phases** (六甲五行),
the **Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams** (九宫八卦),
**preventing our fate from being fulfilled** (莫遂考终).
We **fear ancestral curses** (先世流殃), **malevolent curses** (恶人咒诅),
**past grudges and debts** (宿冤往债), **provoked conflicts** (结衅所成),
**binding the deceased** (伏连传尸), and **spreading to the living** (新故延染).
We **fear the registration of vital forces in disputes** (考气注讼), **harassing our spirits** (侵逼魂神).
We **fear malevolent spirits and demonic essences** (魍魉邪精) **riding upon us to cause untimely death** (乘为夭害).
After **our transformation**, we **lack the means to be guided across** (超度无由).
We **fear being entangled with ghostly groups**, **bringing misfortune to the living** (殃延见在).

Thus, we **dare to perform this ritual fast and Dao/Way practice** (修斋行道),
**wholeheartedly devoting ourselves to the Most True** (归命至真),
**humbly beseeching your great compassion** (仰乞大慈),
**to specially bestow your blessings** (特垂惠泽),

**with radiant light enveloping their bodies** (圆光附体),
**illuminating the boundless cosmos** (洞照太空),
**guiding and transforming all beings** (导引世人),
**eternally freed from the Long Night** (永超长夜).

Our hope is that **the borders may rest in tranquility** (边疆静息),
**winds and rains be balanced** (风雨均调),
**the Sage’s blessings endure** (圣祚延长),
and the **Imperial design be forever secure** (皇图永固).

**clarify our minds and perceptions** (心识光明),
**quickly attain the Realm of Mysterious Enlightenment** (速登玄解之乡),
and **forever be the shelter of both humans and heavens** (永作人天之庇).

May our **departed Teacher be guided across** (先师超度),

Above, may we **manifest the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassionate transformation** (上明天尊大慈之化),
and below, may we **fulfill our disciples’ sincere petitions** (下副臣等祈向之诚).
**Thus, we humbly present our prayer** (谨启以闻).

Those who emerge must be solemn, dignified, and resplendent in their attire, with **headdresses and trailing ribbons**. Open the **Mysterious Platform’s Earth and Domain Spirits**.

Today, as I perform the midday Dao/Way practice, I sincerely offer this with utmost devotion. My sincerity has been recorded and reported. May the **Most High Ten-Direction True Dao/Way qi** and the **Numinous Treasure Auspicious Light** descend and flow into my body, so that my petitions may swiftly reach the presence of the **Most High Boundless Dao/Way, the Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven, and the Eastern Pole Saving-Suffering Green Heavenly Emperor**.

**Invoke the Law Position**.

I, **Subject of Rank [X]**, along with the assembled officials of the platform, humbly and sincerely petition:
The **Void-Natural Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable One**, the **Most High Dao/Way Lord**, the **Most High Venerable Lord**, the **Jade Emperor of the Broad Heaven**, the **Hook-Array Heavenly Emperor**, the **Northern Pole Worthy of the Purple Micro**, the **Southern Pole Life-Granting Emperor**, the **Eastern Pole Saving-Suffering Green Heavenly Emperor**, the **Heaven-Supporting Earth-Modeling Sovereign of the Yellow Soil**, the **Ten-Direction Most High Numinous Treasure Heavenly Venerables**, the **Heavenly Venerables**, the **Heavenly Emperors**, the **Upper Clarity Sun-Moon-Stars-Constellations-River-Han Host of True Ones**, the **Three Officials and Four Saints**, the **Five Teachers and Three Provincial True Lords**, the **Nine Heavenly Celestial Bureaucrats**, the **True Lords of All Ranks**, the **Transmitted Lineage and Doctrine-Granting Great Masters**, the **Thunder-Peal Spirit-Tiger Heavenly Physicians and All Officials**, the **Most High Ranked Scriptures and Talismans’ Immortal Officials and Clerks**, the **Named-Mountain Cave-Dwellings’ Dao-Achieving Immortals**, the **Underworld Acid-Field Emperor**, the **Yin-Spirits’ Holy Assembly**, the **Water Realm’s Eastern-Soaring Emperor**, the **Lingyuan True Immortals**, the **Five Peaks and Five Heavens’ Holy Emperors**, the **Acid-Field Earth Spirits**, the **Grand Marshal of the Five Elements**, the **Yearly Stem-Branch Earth-Fire**, the **Temperate Official’s Holy Assembly**, the **Prefectural-County City Deities**, the **Local Temple and Shrine Spirits**, the **Blessed Court’s Earthly True Officials**, the **Law Platform’s All Officials**, the **Three Realms’ Soul-Extracting Spirit-Clerks**, the **Four Realms’ Direct-Talisman Functionaries**, the **Petition-Recording Money-Spirit Clerks**, the **Ritual Feast’s Sovereigns**, and **All True Immortals**.

With reverence, we gaze upon your boundless mercy and profound discernment.

We, born of mortal form in the Central Land, endowed with ordinary nature, by the fate of past virtues, encountering the Dao/Way’s auspicious age, though of lowly station, may partake in the True. Refining qi and congealing spirit, yet still deficient in True stillness, wandering in thought—we have not yet grasped the Mysterious Void.

Now, my disciple **X**, relying on my former teacher **Y**, all share the same past gathering. Our bonds are as vast as heaven’s cover and earth’s load, our ranks ordained since birth. Ascension and decline in transformation—it is only right to recommend and elevate them, as decreed by the Celestial Edict. With utmost sincerity, we humbly implore the Mysterious Ford, praying for auspicious aid.

Today, by the decree of the Word, we dare not fail to report it.

**Proclaim the Word**.

As the Word states, our devotion is profound and sincere.

Disciple **X**, with the transformation of my former teacher **Y**, once received the Mysterious Strategy, dwelling in the Dao/Way’s domain, yet his virtuous deeds were not manifest, his immortal name unrecorded, his lifespan measured—he passed away in the natural course. Grief-stricken and sorrowful, we earnestly pray, solemnly preparing the ritual platform to perform the fast and rectitude.

We have carefully examined the ritual precepts, broadly constructing this bridge, so that this departing soul may be extinguished from the wheel of rebirth.

Now, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the first incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Three Venerable Ones of the Great Dao/Way**. With utmost sincerity, we **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, dedicating these merits to pray for the Emperor’s eternal longevity, the prosperity of the ancestral temple, the enduring blessing of the imperial lineage, and the peace of the realm.

May the **Three Teachers and Nine Ancestors**, the people of the land, and all who receive the Mysterious Grace attain the Dao/Way.

Today, we light this incense and **take refuge in the Venerable Ones’ True and Most High Virtue**. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.

Now, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the second incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Most High Venerable Scripture**. With utmost sincerity, we **take refuge in body, spirit, and fate**, dedicating these merits to **Disciple X**, dissolving his offenses, absolving his transgressions, freeing him from the Nine Yin Prisons and the Five Suffering Courts, so that he may no longer wander in the cycle of birth, eternally receiving blessings, ultimately attaining the Dao/Way, enduring blissful non-action, extending even to the submerged and forgotten, encompassing all sentient beings within the nine boundaries—all relying on this vast mercy to achieve the Dao/Way’s transformation.

Today, we light this incense and **take refuge in the Scripture-Venerable Ones’ True and Most High Virtue**. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.

Now, as we perform the midday Dao/Way practice, we request the assembled ritualists to light **the third incense strand**, wishing this incense smoke to ascend directly to the heavens and offer itself to the **Most High Three Teachers**.

We, Your humble servants, with utmost sincerity, take refuge in body, spirit, and life—devoting these merits to disciple [name] and all descendants. The True *qi* lies dormant as latent treasure, while the Perfected One descends to receive. Within, the *yuan* and *qi* congeal into purity; without, malevolent forces are repelled. The Northern Palace extends the year of boundless ease, while the Southern Bureau records the register of eternal life. Grievances dissolve, debts are reconciled, and harmony spreads through the nine clans, all peoples under heaven, both seen and unseen, and all living things—all sharing in this boundless blessing.

Now, we again light incense and take refuge in the Teacher-Venerable Ones’ Most High and True Virtue. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True.

**Repentance, command the demon, and step upon the void**—three rites performed. We humbly repeat the sacred ranks.

We, Your devoted servants [name] and the assembled ritual officials, with utmost sincerity and reverence, address:

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of Natural Void,
The Most High Dao/Way Lord,
The Most High Venerable Lord Lao,
The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,
The Heavenly Sovereign of the Gourd Cluster,
The Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Northern Pole,
The Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Southern Pole,
The Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole,
The Earthly Sovereign who follows Heaven’s law,
The Highest Celestial Worthies of the Round Canopy,
The Royal Governors of the Four Quarters,
All Spirits and Saints, both past and present,
All True Celestials assembled at this ritual feast—

We humbly pray for Your boundless compassion and Your penetrating insight.

By fortune and merit, we have partaken in the True Transformation. The secrets of the Celestial Scriptures were early attained through practice. Examining the True Scriptures, we deeply understand their teachings. The Teacher’s grace is most profound, equal to that of a heavenly kin—one who turns the Wheel of Life and Death. Thus, we must solemnly offer this petition.

Now, we dare to submit our plea: Your disciple [name] humbly acknowledges that our revered Celestial Master [name]—through virtuous causes—once attained the True Rank, wore the lofty mysteries, and revered the True One. Yet, our Celestial Rank remains incomplete, worldly toil unsettled, and suddenly bound by sickness and calamity, we nearly perished. Though all things must end, the fault lies with later generations, whose recklessness we now regret too late. The suffering is unbearable, and we fear our accumulated sins may hinder the Master’s ascension. We seek repentance to benefit both the living and the dead.

Your disciples [name], from countless kalpas past, since taking birth, have:
- Betrayed sovereigns and parents, failing to honor our elders;
- Abandoned truth for falsehood, betraying teachers and deceiving friends;
- Committed murder and cruelty, harming the innocent, envying the virtuous, and slighting kin;
- Consumed life-bearing substances, violated purity, misused sacred scriptures, and blasphemed the Celestial Worthies, deceiving even our own forms;
- Misinterpreted sacred teachings, recklessly revealing Heaven’s secrets, violating rites, and defying celestial decrees;
- Practiced deceit, acted unjustly, enriched ourselves while neglecting kin;
- Broken vows, violated precepts, and transgressed the Mystic Arts—failing humanity below and the scriptures above. Our names are inscribed in the Black Register, our merits lost in the Blue Ledger. Our sins have led to annihilation, and our misdeeds have brought ruin upon our teachers.

In the endless night of darkness, where has our vital essence gone? Without confession, how could we hope for salvation?

Now, through fasting and Dao/Way practice, we repent our errors, seeking to purge both the living and the dead of their transgressions.

We humbly pray that the Most High Dao/Way and the Venerable Worthies command the Twenty-Seven Prisons of the Underworld and the One Hundred Twenty Departments of Yin-Yang Water-Fire to erase the karmic debts of seven lifetimes, granting us broad pardon, releasing our forms and spirits, and allowing us to be reborn in the Central Realm, receiving *qi* of wisdom. May we uphold the Mystic Arts, propagate the sacred teachings, become teachers for humanity and gods, and realize the Dao/Way of the Void.

Next, we pray for the longevity of the Emperor, the unity of ministers, the harmonization of all under heaven, and the alignment of the eight directions. May all realms of suffering and the nine layers of darkness witness the light, free from all torment. May all creatures, great and small, across the land, share in this boundless grace and ascend to the shores of blessing.

May this illuminate the Heavenly Worthy’s great compassion above and reflect our sincere repentance below. We humbly submit this petition.

**Twelve Wishes Completed. The Incense Altar is Rekindled.**

We solemnly command the incense officials, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials to gather at the place where we performed the midday Dao/Way practice. There, gold elixir and jade-green pills shall spontaneously arise, along with herbs and hundred-spirits’ blessings, as the Celestial Worthies converge before this incense altar.

We pray that the Celestial Maiden and Boy attendants of the Ten Directions receive the fragrant smoke and swiftly convey our sincere petition to the presence of:
- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,
- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,
- The Supreme Saviour of the Eastern Pole.

**Daoist Rituals Comprehensive Collection, Volume Seventy-Six Complete**

**Ritual of the Upper Clarity Dao/Way’s Ascension and Transformation for the Departed Spirits**

**Evening Dao/Way Practice**

The ritual assembly ascends the platform as prescribed. Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao/Way’s teachings. The sacred incantations are proclaimed, and the divine light shines brightly, while auspicious *qi* swirls in abundance. The celestial tripod and dipper [箕斗] cast their radiance, and the sacred grove [芝宇] lies serene. The jade pupils [玉眸] hold the true essence, and the precious altar [宝坛] remains pure and dry. The night transforms into day, and the cycle returns to midday. The Great Summit [太华] flows with pearls, and the vermilion phoenix [丹凤] soars in the *Xuan* [玄].

The evil spirits are quelled, and the wicked are extinguished. With lofty steps, we ascend amid fragrant smoke. The Celestial Worthies gather in full, all arriving before the Emperor’s presence, merging with the Dao/Way’s true essence.

The sacred drum [法鼓] is struck twenty-four times.

We summon the Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless, the Three Primordial *Qi* [三炁] of the Heavenly Origin, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, and the following officials from within our bodies:
- The Three Five Functionaries [三五功曹],
- The Left and Right Officials,
- The Left and Right Incense Bearers,
- The Relay Dragons and Mounted Bridesmen [驿龙骑吏],
- The Golden Boy Attendants of Incense,
- The Jade Girl Scatterers of Flowers,
- The Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,
- The Direct Day Incense Officials,
and all thirty-six in total.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn and dignified robes, their headgear and ribbons hanging in proper order. They open the gates of the Mystic Daoist Altars [玄坛] and the local deities [土地], as well as the regional spirit officials [方域神真].

Now, as the sun sets and we perform the Dao/Way practice, we humbly offer this as our heartfelt intention. All our earnest entreaties have already been recorded and presented. We pray that the Supreme Dao/Way’s true essence of the Ten Directions, the Sacred Treasure and Auspicious Light, descend and enter our bodies, so that our petitions may swiftly reach the presence of:
- The Most High Dao/Way of the Boundless,
- The Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven,
- The Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*.

We request the proclamation of the sacred ranks.

We, the undersigned [具位臣某] and all the assembled ritual officials, sincerely present this petition together. To the Heavenly Venerable of the Natural Void, the Supreme Dao/Way Lord, the Supreme Old Lord, the Jade Emperor of the Boundless Heaven, the Hook-and-Arrow Heavenly Sovereign, the Great Purple Emperor of the Northern Pole, the Southern Pole Emperor of the Vital Breath, the Eastern Pole’s Supreme Saviour of the Green *Xuan*, the Earthly Sovereign of the Posterior Soil who follows Heaven’s law, the Supreme Venerable of the Ten Directions’ Sacred Treasure, the Heavenly Venerables of all realms, the Heavenly Emperors of all realms, the Upper Clarity Worthies of the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Milky Way, the Three Officials and Four Saints, the Five Masters and Three Provincial Spirit Lords, the Nine Heavenly Celestial Functionaries, all the Spirit Lords, the Great Masters of successive generations who uphold the Dao/Way’s lineage and teachings, the Thunder and Lightning Spirit Tigers and Heavenly Physicians of all departments, the Daoist officials and officers from the Supreme Scriptures and Ordinances, the named mountain and cave deities who have attained the Dao/Way, the Great Emperor of the Underworld, the Holy Multitude of the Netherworld, the Great Emperor of the Eastern Pole’s Exalted Phoenix, the True Worthies of the Langyan Palace, the Five Sacred Emperors of the Five Peaks and Five Heavens, the Earthly Sovereign of the Netherworld, the General of the Ten Thousand *Gan*, the Grand Marshal of the Earthly Branches, the Sacred Multitude of the *Wen* Command, the deities of the prefectures and counties, the city gods, the local spirit officials of the auspicious courtyard, the ritual officers of all departments, the Three Realms’ deities who extract souls and seize spirits, the Four Realms’ direct symbols and functionaries, the scribes who record and present petitions, the deities presiding over the *Jiao* feast, and all the seated True Worthies.

With reverence, we gaze upon Your boundless compassion and profound discernment. We, Your devoted disciples, have long benefited from Your sacred grace, drawing upon the pure *qi* to return to the Dao/Way’s transformation and partake in the true winds. Through the hidden precepts and sacred texts, the profound rituals and wondrous doctrines, we have attained harmony and enlightenment. Heaven’s blessings are vast and deep.

Yet, this disciple [弟子某], through the Master’s personal bond, once by fate’s convergence, was held in high regard by the Dao/Way’s teachings and prioritized in the Master’s true instructions. Together, we have transcended life and death, ascending and descending, guiding one another toward the Dao/Way. Now, in obedience to Your sacred words, we dare not fail to present this petition. The words are proclaimed.

As per the words spoken, our devotion is profound and sincere. We fear that our former Master, having ascended to the Daoist transformation, may wonder where our spiritual awareness resides. Their radiant presence has fled, and their voice and form are distant. Previously, we dwelled in the turbid world, now taking refuge in the Mystic Daoist Gate. Our practice is incomplete, our cultivation often neglected, and we struggle to transcend the Dao’s realm, still hindered by the Netherworld’s path. Our body has passed beyond the Three Officials’ jurisdiction, and we suffer the torments of all spirits. In these dark nights, our sorrow is genuine and deep.

Thus, we adhere to the ritual precepts and solemnly proceed together, following the Daoist teachings and venerating the true essence. We rely on Your grace to open the path and pray to repay the force that gave us life. We prepare the incense with utmost reverence, hoping to express our earnest aspiration. We purify our thoughts and focus our minds, devoutly observing the *Jiao* feast and its strictures.

With this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this first pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Three Supreme Venerables. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to the ancestral temples, the spirits of the earth, and the celestial Worthies. May our virtuous *qi* rise to the Nine Pure [九清] and our spirits ride the clouds to the Eight Extremes [八极]. May Your blessings descend upon us, protecting our nation and bringing peace to its people.

May the Emperor of the Northern Pole extend longevity, and the Southern Mountain Emperor bestow prosperity upon all. May the world be at peace and harmony prevail within and without. May the court be filled with virtuous ministers, and the countryside have no abandoned talents. May all under heaven follow the Dao/Way’s transformation, uniting in the harmony of non-action.

Now, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.

With this evening’s Dao/Way practice, we request the ritual assembly to take this second pinch of incense and offer it upward. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, paying homage to the Supreme Venerable Scriptures. We surrender our body, spirit, and fate, dedicating these merits to our former Master [先师某].

May the True Vehicle guide and protect us, and the Most Holy preserve and uphold us. May we bathe in the divine fire’s court and refine our spirits in the realm of penetrating *yang*. May we ascend to the jade gates of the True Worthies and receive the name in the Pearl Palace. May we praise the Dao/Way’s compassionate winds and open the path of wisdom for all beings.

Together with the Nine *Xuan* and Seven Ancestors, the Masters of scriptures and ordination, the upholders and monitors of the alliance, and the mountain-dwelling kindred spirits, may we all share in the blessings of victory and ascend to the true stages.

Now, through this act of burning incense, we have taken refuge in the Supreme Scriptures and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.

As the sun now sets, ascending the platform to practice the Dao/Way, we humbly request the assembled Dharma assembly to kindle these three strands of incense. May this fragrant smoke ascend the celestial path, offering reverence to the Most High Three Masters.

We, the disciples, take refuge with body, spirit, and life, and with these merits, dedicate them to the lineage of our teacher [Name], extending blessings to our countless ancestors and kindred spirits, both living and departed. May the living inherit the resources of fortune and protection, while the deceased attain the grace of ascension.

To all within the revolving heavens and the eight extremes, to all sentient beings of earth and plant, to the Nine Nights and Three Paths, to wandering souls and stagnant spirits—may they all receive the Most High’s proclaimed benevolence and be bathed in the True One’s salvific grace, achieving boundless ease and eternal auspiciousness.

Now, through this act of burning incense, we take refuge in the Teacher’s supreme virtue and the Great Saints’ true essence. After attaining the Dao/Way, we ascend to the formless and merge with the Dao’s true essence.

**Repentance completed.**
*East Azure, West White, South Vermilion, North Dark*—valid for all three watches.

We have heard that the Mysterious Dao responds to all circumstances and attends to every sentiment. The Celestial Sovereign’s boundless aid extends mercy in response to thought. Repentance clears the threefold karma, and atonement opens the Nine Abysses to prosperity.

Now, through this turning of the scriptures and practice of the Dao/Way, we bow in homage to the Ten Directions’ Limitless Supreme, the Soul-Treasury Celestial Worthy, the Three Lights and Five Peaks, the Three Rivers and Four Seas, and the Thirty-Six Departments of Venerable Scriptures. We, disciple [Name], with our teacher [Name], sever worldly dust and ascend the True Path.

Reflecting on past lifetimes and this very existence, from birth onward, we have accumulated merits and demerits—sometimes practicing compassion to save beings and teaching to guide people, yet violating scriptural precepts and transgressing prohibitions; sometimes applying Daoist methods while yielding to human emotions, favoring or resenting by circumstance, fostering grudges; sometimes constructing observatories, diverting waters, or tunneling mountains, disturbing dragon spirits and felling trees, leaving some harmed while others prospered, merits turning to faults. Or in transmitting the Dharma and teaching scriptures, disregarding proper timing, where kindness became a burden to the Dao and good intentions led to error. The Five Emperors and Four Officials have not granted pardon, and the Three Officials and Nine Departments still strike our offenses, confining us in dark prisons with no means of liberation.

Through this fasting and Daoist practice, we now confess our faults and seek mercy, hoping to purge countless transgressions. May the Three Venerable Saints respond to our sincere pleas, descend boundless grace, and forgive boundless guilt. Whether great or small, may all be cleansed.

Thus, may our names be erased from the Red Register, our sins expunged from the Black Ledger, the Dark Moon refined, and our souls ascend to the Vermilion Palace. May we traverse the Wheel of Fortune, attain True Rank, fulfill the Dao’s fruit, and forever escape the cycle of transformation.

To all ancestors, living and deceased, across countless generations, may they receive blessings, and all sentient beings share in honor. May the Dao’s light spread, benefiting future disciples, perpetually turning the Wheel of Teaching and magnifying divine transformation.

Our petitions and supplications are now presented to the Mysterious Insight. May past karmic calamities dissolve, and present blessings descend.

Above, may the Celestial Sovereign’s benevolent grace be manifest; below, may our sincere homage be fulfilled. We humbly submit this prayer.

**Twelve Vows completed.**
*Restoration of the incense burner.*

We solemnly command the incense officers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Officers, and the attendant spirit officials of incense: May they now cause gold elixirs and jade-green herbs, as well as all hundred spirits, to naturally arise at the place where we previously set the sun and practiced the Dao. May the Ten Directions’ immortal youths and jade maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying our sincere petitions to the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Vault, and the Sovereign of the Eastern Pole, the Green Celestial Emperor Who Saves from Suffering, before the Celestial Throne.

**Exit the hall in praise.**

We have heard that the **Numinous Treasure** transmits the Dao/Way, its teachings profound and joyous.
The **Jade Circle** bestows scriptures, its oath to spread them far and wide.
The lineage of **Masters and Disciples** follows in succession, like ancient and modern lamps.
From the heavens above to the realm of humanity, the Dao/Way is divided into **refined and profound** teachings.
Yet the **Highest True Ones** and the **novices** differ in their understanding and capacity.
All acknowledge that the Dao/Way has been transmitted, surpassing the **mechanisms of transformation and ascension**.

This disciple, serving as **Master** [name]’s successor, fears that though I have received the **auspicious Dao/Way**, I have not yet ascended.
I rely upon the **Ritual Feast’s power** to beseech the **Ascension-Transformation of the Dao/Way**.

With **fragrant incense and pure offerings**, I invite the **True Ones’ presence** to this **sacred field**.
I yearn for their **ascended wanderings**, hoping to witness the **radiant affairs** of the Dao/Way.

The **Jade Wheels and Feathered Canopies** drift through the **pure qi of the heavens**.
The **Moon Garments and Star Crowns** illuminate the **vast expanse of midnight**.

I await the **gathering of the Hundred Spirits**, pointing toward the **Nine-Night Celestial Ferry**.

We, the disciple and the assembled officials, cannot contain our **eager reverence** in inviting and prolonging their presence.
We humbly welcome the **Holy Procession**.

**Descent of the Holy Ones.**
Offer tea.
**First presentation.**
Scatter flowers.

**Second invocation of the Law position.**
The **named disciple** and the **assembled Ritual Platform officials**, with renewed sincerity, present our petition to the **Nine Clarities’ Supreme Saints**, the **Three Caverns’ Masterly Lords**, and the **True Spirits of the Ten Directions and Three Realms**.

With reverent gaze, we behold the **Great Compassion** and **Piercing Insight**.

We have heard that the **Primordial Origin** of the **Hun-Dun** (Mystic Cavern) ascended westward with the **White Deer**.
The **Yellow Emperor** of the **Cauldron Lake** soared aloft upon the **Bearded Dragon**.
All sought **longevity** as their foundation, **repelling death** as their priority.

The Dao/Way’s **lofty mysteries** are tied to the **aspirations of humanity**.
Yet **laborious efforts** are like **embroidered silks**—difficult to achieve.
The **analogy of the rising wind** reminds us: if one does not **diligently cultivate the heart**, how can one **specialize in embracing the One**?

To **abandon oneself to desires**, indulge in **worldly affairs**, deepen **attachment to pleasures**—these lead to **decline and decay**.
When **qi is lost** and **essence leaks**, when **blood fades** and **bones wither**,
The **Dao/Way’s vitality** gradually diminishes,
And the **fate of one’s karma** accelerates.

This disciple, serving as **Master** [name]’s successor, though born in an **auspicious era** and **striking the Mystic Gate** with my name,
Though I have **partially studied** the scriptures and teachings,
My **form and qi** remain unrefined.
Suddenly, I have **followed the transformation** and **temporarily perished**,
Fearing that my **accumulated practices** have **many transgressions**,
And that my **Daoist rank** has not yet been achieved,
For my **life’s path** still faces obstacles.

I humbly rely upon the **Heavenly Lords’ teachings**, the **Supreme Old Lord’s codes**,
For there are **rituals of ascension and transformation** to achieve **Daoist transcendence**,
And **methods of refining and purifying** to **revive the body**,
So that the **spirit may ascend to the Upper Realm**,
And the **soul may transcend the Great Darkness**,
Entering early the **Daoist Source**,
And forever departing the **Underworld Exile**.

Thus, I dare to **return and depend upon the Supreme Dao/Way**,
To **establish this Ritual Feast**,
Using the **pure and refined** **Crane Robes**,
And **knocking at the towering** **Tiger Gate**.

The **wind carries the pure chants**, enveloping the **dragging clouds and flags**.
The **dew embraces the fragrant incense**, shining upon the **lantern-lit jade mats**.

We **store our spirits in the heavens**, maintaining **serene simplicity** at the **midnight altar**.
We **report our original woes**, hoping to **reach the lofty discernment** of the **Heavenly Lords**.

「Thus, the **Sacred Officials** of the **Daoist Canon** have been summoned,
And the **Minister’s duty** is to **ascend and report** their words.
The **ritual supplications** are now humbly presented for **propagation**.

**Supplication Declared.**
In truth, I deeply **revere and cherish** the **Heavenly Lords’ teachings**.
I pray that my **sins may be cleansed by the Celestial Hearers**,
And that **mercy may descend upon the souls in the Underworld Path**.

May the **Great Compassion** be **widely bestowed** like **sweat of benevolence**,
And the **Broad Way** be **established** as a **crossing for all beings**.

**Reflecting upon my own past transgressions**—
From countless **kalpas (eons)** since my **first embodiment**,
Until this very **lifetime in the mortal world**,
The **sins I have committed** are **deeply rooted**:
By the **Six Senses**, I have been **tainted and burdened**;
Through the **Three Karmas (body, speech, mind)**, I have been **entangled and dragged**.

These are **inversions of right conduct**, where **good deeds fail to offset wrongdoing**.
Sometimes, I **misinterpreted the scriptures** or **transgressed the clear teachings** of the **Dao/Way**,
Or **blamed the dharma and faulted the masters**, thus **offending the Heavenly Constitution**,
And **violated the true Daoist precepts** and **Three Elements’ sacred texts**,
So that my **body was consigned to the Underworld Gate**,
And I **suffered retribution** beyond measure—
**Boundless sins and offenses**, too numerous to recount.

Now, I **return in submission** to the **Heavenly Lords**,
And **offer my lamentations** to the **Sages above**.
For every **fault, great or small**, I **humbly beg for absolution**.

May **lost souls be redeemed** from **suffering in the Underworld**,
And **embodied spirits** **break free from torment**.
May the **Divine Elixir** **purify my spirit** in the **Hall of Transformation**,
And my **body attain Daoist transcendence**, nourished by **consuming clouds and breathing dews**,
As I **unceasingly cultivate**, **accumulate learning**, and **achieve true realization**,
Gradually **ascending to the Void** without **falling into rebirth**,
My **form dispersing like mist**, yet my **spirit ever-present**—
**Unbounded in existence, yet boundless in departure**,
In **harmony with the true Dao/Way**, my **essence aligning with the Mysterious Principle**.

The **Three Teachers and Primordial Ancestors** shall **transcend and verify** my **Daoist rank**,
And the **Nine Generations of departed forebears** shall **rise upon the Celestial Path**.

May **all sentient beings** be **freed from the suffering of the Three Realms of Torment**,
And **all souls** **cross the Six Realms of Existence** with **purity**,
As **four types of rebirth** are **equally benefited**.

The **Minister and all assembled** dare not **cease in their utmost sincerity** of **seeking truth and redeeming the departed**,
And **offering this humble supplication**.
**Scatter the flowers.**

**Reaffirming the sacred ranks**—
The **Minister and all officers** of the **ritual assembly**,
With **deep reverence and sincerity**, now **prostrate and address**:
The **Three Pure Ones**, the **Sages above**, and the **Ten Directions of Marvelous Existence**,
All **responsive to the ritual**, and the **true spirits of the Dao/Way**.

Though **my traces are extinguished** and **my life has ended**—
Even if **human fate** has **its natural conclusion**,
Yet **my body remains untransformed** due to **unfulfilled Daoist merits**.

I **entrust my essence to the Great Darkness**,
And **send my heart to the boundless Underworld**.
I **hear of the Supreme Dao/Way’s teachings**,
That there are **methods to refine and transform the mortal body**,
And **sacred talismans** for **ascending to Heaven** as a **Daoist Immortal**.

Thus, my **form and spirit may return to the Celestial Path**,
And my **body not be confined to the Underworld**.

The **Five Emperors guard and protect**,
And the **Three Realms’ officials welcome**—
Through **countless kalpas**, **transmission flows freely**,
And the **Daoist lineage** **passes down its teachings**.

Now, I **establish this Ritual Feast** in **memory of my departed master**,
And **rely on the Great Mercy** to **expiate my past sins**.

I fear that my **departed master**,
Who **embodied the Great Law** and **devotedly revered the Dao/Way**,
May have **his name recorded in the Daoist Register** yet **his cultivation interrupted**,
And **his accumulated sins** lead to **untimely death**—
His **green tablets (records of merit)** may **fall into obscurity**,
And the **Underworld officials** **hold his faults against him**,
As the **Heavenly Gate is barred** and the **Earthly Path is flooded**,
Leaving him **lost in the Ghostly Marshes**, **suffering imprisonment and accusations**.

I **humbly hope** for the **Great Pardon**,
That **past calamities may be washed away**,
And **the Three Officials (of the Underworld)** be **commanded**,
As the **Five Emperors** are **invoked**,
To **abandon evil and embrace goodness**,
And **revive the dead**, restoring their **corporeal remains**.

May **my departed master** **soar like a celestial bird**,
And **wander freely in the Divine Abodes**,
As his **cultivation transcends the Six Desires**,
And his **Dao/Way realization** **enlightens all lost souls**,
Bringing **equal benefit to ancestors and descendants**,
And **enduring blessings to future generations**.

Then, **this disciple** shall **reside peacefully in the Daoist Retreat**,
And **attain the worldly honors of Daoist robes**,
Driving away **malevolent spirits from tombs and dwellings**,
And **warding off the envy of others**.

May the **Daoist Lamp** **continue unbroken**,
And my **longevity surpass the purity of Tao Qing**,
As I **pursue the vision of longevity** like **Pine and Willow Immortals**.

May **all worldly attachments dissolve**,
And **Daoist aspirations renew eternally**,
With **no selfish thoughts**, only **benevolent transformation for all beings**.

The **Minister and all assembled**,
In **uttermost sincerity and trepidation**,
**Bow repeatedly with prostrations**,
And **offer this humble prayer to the Sacred Procession**.

**The Twelve Vows.**
**Reignite the furnace.**»

**Translation:**

With solemn reverence, I summon the incense officials, the left and right Dragon and Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit officials of the incense—
That they may command this humble one’s past sites of **Daoist rites and summoning of the True Ones** to spontaneously generate **golden elixir and jade-green pills**, **mushrooms and hundred-spirited herbs**, as the assembled **True Ones** gather before this incense furnace.

I now pray that the **celestial children and jade maidens of the Ten Directions** may attend the **fragrant mists**, and swiftly convey this humble one’s sincere supplications to the **Most High, Boundless, and Supreme Dao**, the **August Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**, and the **Savior of Suffering, the Azure Mystic Emperor of the Eastern Pole** before their august presence.

May the **Sacred Offerings be sent forth**, **transformed into merit**, and **returned with blessings**.

**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume Seventy-Eight complete.**
**The Complete Daoist Ritual Canon, Volume Seventy-Nine.**
*Edited by Master Guangting Du, the Eastern Peak Rite of Rescue and Salvation, the Great Rite of Petition.*
*Ascending the Platform—ritual procedures as prescribed.*

This humble official, **[name omitted]**, with due reverence, burns **Daoist incense, incense of virtue, and incense of Effortless Nature**, and in utmost sincerity, petitions the **Seven-Treasured Golden Palace Emperor of the Void and Nature**, the **Eastern Palace Master, the Great Savior, the Celestial Lord of the Great Pole**, the **lineage of scripture-transmitting and teaching True Ones of past and present**, the **Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue, the Sacred and Renowned Sovereign of Mount Tai**, the **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress**, the **Prince and Noble Consort**, the **Illustrious Spirit Lord of the Hall**, the **Soul King of Western Qi**, the **martial and civil officials beneath the peak**, all **clerks and attendants**, the **sentient beings of the Three Realms**, and all **True Spirits**—
That they may all **rely upon the sacred incense** and **universally receive this offering**.

This humble one, in deepest humility, reflects that though the **Boundless and Impartial** holds the power of transformation,
Yet among the living multitudes, there are still **differences in virtue and folly**.

「The heavens and the earth are separated by eight ten-thousand *li*,
Yet for common mortals, this distance is difficult to comprehend;
The Twelve States of the realm were established by decree,
Indeed, the ghosts and spirits govern their respective domains.

To discern good deeds from evil, this principle determines life and death.
If one harbors a heart of fear and reverence,
One should wholeheartedly resolve to submit to it.
Though we risk offense in presenting this plea to convey our intent,
Our sincere sentiments have already been laid bare before you.

May the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue, the Sacred and Renowned Sovereign of Mount Tai,
Extend his boundless compassion and blessings to us,
So that our sincerity may be recognized and our prayers granted;
May his divine favor descend upon us,
And the spirits come without constraint to answer our call.
With the gathered officials under his command, like thunderous judgment,
And the assembled saints descending as clouds,
Temporarily leaving their lofty abodes,
To grace this humble offering of incense and solemn rites.

Pitying the world’s sorrowful and afflicted,
Rescuing the lost souls burdened with guilt,
So that they may escape from the depths of *yōuliáo* [幽牢, netherworldly prisons],
And perhaps attain the shores of the Dao/Way.

Now, the altar is erected and the rites begin,
The proper forms are set forth,
As we earnestly turn our gaze toward the sacred,
And focus our thoughts as if the deities were present.
We aspire to the highest realms of the Dao/Way’s transcendence,
And hope to harmonize with the solemnity of this *zhāi* [斋, fast].

Our humble petitions are thus presented to the utmost.

**Recitation of the Precepts:**
The Dao/Way prioritizes fasting above all else.
In ancient times, sacrifices required fasting,
And fasting required adherence to precepts.
One first observed the precepts before fasting—
The so-called *"seven-day precepts and three-day fasting"*.

To disperse the fasting over seven days is called *precepts* [戒].
The *precepts* [戒] are what enable one to reverently follow the sacred standards,
To avoid transgressions and wrongdoings,
To strictly abide by the precepts and laws,
And to never stray from them.

To concentrate the fasting over three days is called *fasting* [斋].
The *fasting* [斋] is what enables one to purify the mind and spirit,
To clarify thoughts and intentions,
To focus one’s essence,
And to seek communion with the divine.

The *Zhōu Li* [周官] records the duties of the *Tàizǎi* [太宰, Grand Overseer],
Who, when sacrificing to the Five Emperors,
Supervised the oaths and precepts of all officials.
Ten days before the ritual, he led the attendants in divination
To determine the auspicious day for taking the precepts.

Moreover, the *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇, Grand Marshal of Punishments]
Oversaw the swearing of all officials,
And the precepts were observed by all clans.

The *Tàizǎi* [太宰], as the official in charge of governance,
Administered the precepts to emphasize their importance;
The *Dà Sī Kòu* [大司寇], as the official in charge of justice,
Presided over them to underscore their severity.

The *Lǐjì* [礼记] also states in *"Jiāo Tèshēng"* [郊特牲]:
On the day of divination for the *Jiāo* [郊, sacrificial field],
The king stood by the marsh,
Personally listening to the oaths and instructions,
And receiving counsel—
This was the essence of admonition.

Within the *Xiànmìng* [献命] gate,
The precepts were administered to all officials.
At the ancestral temple,
The precepts were administered to all people.

Thus, the ancients sought communion with the divine,
Strict in their precepts,
Serious in their fasting,
And so the heavenly spirits descended at the *yuánqiū* [圆丘, circular mound],
The earthly deities emerged at the *fāngzé* [方泽, square marsh],
And the ancestral ghosts were pleased at the ancestral temple.

Though these were the fasts of sacrifice,
They were not the *fast of the heart* [心斋].

In days past, *Yán Huí* [颜回] received teachings from his master,
And though he abstained from wine and meat for months,
His master did not yet permit him to practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋],
For he wished *Yán Huí* [颜回] to listen not with his ears,
But with his mind,
And not with his mind,
But with his *qi* [气].

*Qi* [气] is empty and receptive to all things,
And only when the Dao/Way gathers in this emptiness
Does emptiness become the *fast of the heart* [心斋].

The *Zhōu Yì* [周易] states:
"The sages use this to wash their hearts,
Retreating and concealing themselves in seclusion,
Fasting and observing precepts to manifest their divine virtue."

Thus, the worthy receive the Dao/Way from the sages,
And the sages, who share divine virtue with the celestial,
Must practice the *fast of the heart* [心斋] to attain the Dao/Way.
Therefore, it is known that only after the ritual of sacrifice
Can one seek the *fast of the heart* [心斋],
And then the divine and the Dao/Way will be born within.

Later generations of Daoists established *jiǎo* [醮, expiatory rites] and called them *fasting* [斋],
For though the Five Classics record the fasts of sacrifice,
They differ in name but share the same essence,
And their purpose remains unified.

Now, during this fasting at Mount Tai’s altar,
We invite the Nine Grades of High Worthies to descend and occupy the sacred platform,
May the Heavenly Emperor of Equal Virtue review our fasting merits,
Be moved by our supplications to the Netherworldly Officials,
And rescue the guilty souls.
The heavenly spirits will descend here,
The earthly deities will emerge here,
And the human ghosts will be pleased here.

Now, in conjunction with this fasting,
We recite the precepts,
And all present at the altar
First receive the precepts and their constraints,
As a lasting foundation for the Dao/Way.
Immediately, one should regulate body and mind,
Banish external distractions,
And focus on the Supreme Truth,
So that our petitions may proceed unobstructed,
And our prayers be answered with certainty.

The words of the Celestial Worthies,
The true precepts transmitted—
Today, we present seven conditions,
All should accept and believe them.

**First Precept:** Do not kill or harm.
Pity all sentient beings as if they were your own life.
Those who kill will face six retributions:
1) A short lifespan,
2) Many illnesses,
3) Ugly and repulsive appearance,
4) Physical mutilation,
5) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],
6) Being reborn as one of the six domestic animals,
   To repay others’ flesh and blood.

Now, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,
One must not kill or harm any living being before or behind the altar.

**Second Precept:** Do not indulge in alcohol.
Those who indulge in alcohol will face four offenses:
1) Impeding the sight of the world,
   Causing loss,
2) Preventing the practice of good laws,
3) Generating excessive sleep and lethargy,
4) Bringing madness and confusion.

Now, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,
One must not indulge in alcohol or licentiousness,
Nor offend the High Worthies.

**Third Precept:** Do not harbor rebellious or deceitful thoughts,
Nor speak dishonestly.
The offense of dishonesty brings five retributions:
1) Being subjected to cruel punishments,
2) The destruction of one’s family and clan,
3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],
4) Being reborn as a tiger or wolf,
5) Living in barren lands,
   With no peace of mind.

Now, within the Dao/Way’s sacred precincts,
One must always speak honestly and truthfully,
And await the scrutiny of the High Worthies.

**Fourth Precept:** Do not lack filial piety,
Nor disobey one’s parents.
The offense of unfilial piety brings five retributions:
1) Being punished by earthly law,
2) Being abandoned by all sentient beings,
3) Suffering in the *Dìyù* [地狱, hellish realms],
4) Being reborn as a crow or owl,
   To inflict harm upon one another,
5) Even if one regains human form,
   To live in poverty and hardship.

Now, after hearing the precepts,
One must always uphold a heart of filial devotion,
And await the judgment of Heaven.

**Fifth Precept:** Always cultivate a heart of compassion.
If one sees sentient beings nearing the end of their life,
One should perform meritorious deeds for them.
Even insects and plants—
One must especially refrain from harming them.»

「Cherish the elderly and pity the poor,
Extend universal salvation to all,
So that today’s efforts shall not be in vain—
May the **Dao/Way**-hall hear and accept the precepts’ command.

**Sixth Precept:** Do not defame the Three Treasures,
Nor disparage any **Dao/Way**-master or worthy,
Whether lay or monastic,
All **Dao/Way**-images alike.
The offense of defamation brings four retributions:
1) Ever beset by malevolent illnesses,
2) Death and confinement in dark realms,
3) A split and wandering tongue,
4) Ever encountering adversaries—
   None shall love or honor you.
Now, having heard the precepts,
One must always revere the Three Treasures,
Accumulating merit and virtuous deeds.

**Seventh Precept:** Within this **Dao/Way**-hall today,
One must always maintain reverence,
Never slacking in devotion.
Must strive with diligence,
Both inwardly and outwardly,
Day and night, unceasingly—
Do not slacken, do not neglect.
Diligence brings benefit,
Negligence brings none.
For self-benefit and benefit to others,
One must hasten toward the True Extremes.

Do the above seven precepts
Collectively apply to those in the **Dao/Way**-hall?
The Celestial Worthy replies:
"True disciples of the Great Dao,
Who receive the True Precepts,
Must next make a vow:
May my precept-root be steadfast as Mount Kūnlún,
My precept-practice upright as the Jade Capital Hall,
My precept-light radiant as the Sun-Moon Pearl,
With diligent effort and progress,
May I find peace in the **Dao/Way**-hall,
Attaining the True and Three Pure Ones,
As my original source.
With precepts as my guide,
I shall not fall into heretical teachings.

In the past, there were **26,000 Dao/Way**-adepts,
Who upheld the scriptural precepts,
With unwavering focus and no retreat,
Following the law in their cultivation.
In twelve years,
They were recommended by the earthly officials,
Their names petitioned by the heavenly hosts.
In a hundred years,
They ascended to heaven in broad daylight.

Again, there were **72,000 women**,
Who did not uphold scriptural precepts,
But instead engaged in destruction and defamation,
Suffering in this world and dying into the Nine Abysses.
Thus it is known:
The merit of upholding precepts is inconceivable.
Breaking precepts and evil deeds are hard to absolve.
Especially in this **Dao/Way**-hall today,
Devoted to redeeming past transgressions,
Cleansing faults,
Rescuing the departed,
And observing precepts in fasting—
One must especially strive with diligence.
All heavenly hosts, celestial children,
Golden **Dharmakāya**-bodies and **Vajra**-gods,
The Three Realms’ Five Emperors,
Divine and immortal armies,
All come to guard and attend.

Moreover, within Mount Tài,
There are the Three Palaces of the Empty Void Heaven.
Divine chambers and halls of **Āhā**,
Golden beds and jade tables—
All are gatherings of the celestial hosts.
If one strictly adheres to the precepts above,
Then the Eastern Peak **Dìyù** [地狱, hellish] officials,
The Celestial Chief of Life and Death,
And the **Yòushèng Zhēnjūn** [佑圣真君, Venerable Lord Who Assists the Sacred],
With the myriad enlightened worthies,
Descend to the **Dao/Way**-hall,
To record the merit of fasting,
And pardon the guilty spirits of the departed.
If one instead indulges in arrogance and disrespect,
Breaks the fast or violates the precepts,
It shall not suffice to redeem the departed—
Rather, one shall be punished by the **Dìguān** [地官, earthly officials],
And suffer the torment of the **Fēngdāo** [风刀, wind-blade].
All those gathered in this hall,
Examine and act accordingly.

Your servants are deeply moved,
And humbly submit this report to hear Your decree.»

One **Qi** of Yellow Heaven, regulating Heaven and Earth.
Nurturing and refining **Yīnyáng** [阴阳, Yin and Yang], commanding the **Xuánzhēn** [玄真, Mysterious True Ones].
The **Zhènxīng** [镇星, Pacifying Star] emits radiance, flowing and illuminating the Nine Heavens.
The **Xīnmíng tóngzǐ** [开明童子, Enlightened Child] is summoned, named **Tiānlín** [天璘, Heavenly Pearl].
The **Yuánmì** [元忞, Primordial Radiance] refines the **Yángjīng** [阳精, Yang Essence], flames rising as crimson mist.
Piercingly illuminating all under Heaven, including my servants.
Crushing the myriad **Bāixié** [百邪, Hundred Evils], slaying ten thousand ghosts.
The **Zhōngshān** [中山, Central Peak] divine incantations, universally effective across the land.
The Five Spirits pacified, my body ascends as a **Shàngxiān** [上仙, High Immortal],
And merges with the **Dao/Way**’s true essence.

**Striking the Law Drum Twenty-Four Times.**
**Igniting the Furnace.**

The **Wúshàng** [无上, Peerless] Three Heavens—**Xuányuánshǐ** [玄元始, Mysterious Primordial Origin] Three **Qi**—
**Tàishàng Dàojūn** [太上道君, Supreme Dao Sovereign],
**Tàishàng Lǎojūn** [太上老君, Supreme Venerable Lord],
Summon forth from my body the **Sānwǔ Gōngcāo** [三五功曹, Three Five Merit Officials],
Left and Right **Guānshǐ** [官使者, Official Envoys],
Left and Right **Pěngxiāng** [捧香, Incense-Bearers],
**Yìlóng qí lì** [驿龙骑吏, Dragon Courier Riders],
**Shìxiāng Jīntóng** [侍香金童, Golden Attendants of Incense],
**Chuányán Sǎnhuā Yùnǚ** [传言散花玉女, Jade Maidens Who Transmit Words and Scatter Flowers],
**Wǔdì zhífú** [五帝直符, Direct Talismans of the Five Sovereigns],
**Zhídì xiāngguān** [直日香官, Incense Officials of the Direct Sun],
And all **Sānshíliù rén** [三十六人, Thirty-Six Persons] to emerge.

Those who emerge must be clad in **Yánzhuāng xiǎnfú** [严装显服, Solemn Attire and Manifest Garments],
With **Guānbài chuíyīng** [冠带垂缨, Crowns and Sashes with Pendant Tassels],
Opening the **Xuán táng** [玄坛, Mysterious Platform] and **Tǔdì** [土地, Earthly Deities],
And the **Fāngyù shénzhēn** [方域神真, Regional Spirits and True Ones].

My servants now ascend the platform to invoke the **Dao/Way**,
And humbly present this supplication to declare our intentions.
All sincere sentiments have already been recorded and reported.
We pray that the **Tàishàng shífāng zhìzhēn dàoqi** [太上十方至真道气, Supreme Dao Qi of the Ten Directions],
The **Língbǎo ruìguāng** [灵宝瑞光, Auspicious Radiance of the Spirit Jewel],
May descend and flow into our bodies,
So that our supplications swiftly reach the **Tàishàng Wújí Dàodào** [太上无极大道, Supreme Boundless Great Dao],
And the **Hàotiān Jīnquè Yùhuáng Dìshàng** [昊天金阙玉皇上帝, Jade-Gated Celestial Sovereign Emperor of Heaven].

**Requesting the Designation of Ritual Rank.**

With our ranks thus established, we humbly and sincerely present this supplication to:
The **Xūwú zìrán Jīnquè qībǎo Dìshàng** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝, Void-Natural Jade-Gated Seven-Treasured Emperor],
The **Dōnggōng jiàozhǔ Tàiyǐ jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊, Eastern Palace Teaching Sovereign, Great Unity Saving the Suffering Heavenly Worthy],
The **Chuánjīng yǎnjiào lìdài shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真, Lineage Masters Who Transmit Scriptures and Explain Teachings Across Generations],
The **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝, Eastern Peak Great Mountain Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sacred Emperor],
The **Shúmíng huánghòu** [淑明皇后, Virtuous and Illuminating Empress],
The **Tàizǐ guìfēi** [太子贵妃, Noble Prince and Noble Consort],
The **Diànshàng bǐnglíng gōng** [殿上炳灵公, Palace Hall Illustrious Spirit Lord],
The **Xīqí língwáng** [西齐灵王, Western Equal Spirit King],
The **Yuèxià wénwǔ kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校, Civil and Martial Officials Beneath the Peak],
All **Yīqiè cáoliáo** [一切曹僚, All Officials],
The **Sānjiè yìnggǎn** [三界应感, Three Realms Responding to Sentiments],
And **Yīqiè zhēnlíng** [一切真灵, All True Spirits].

All earnestly hope for Your boundless compassion,
And Your benevolent gaze to descend upon us.

We have heard:
When the Seven Orifices are drilled, **Húndùn** [混沌, Chaos] dies and all beings contend;
When the Five **Qí** [綦, Limits] are reached, **Yínpì** [淫僻, Licentiousness] arises and chaos ensues without governance.

In the midst of such abundance and multitude,
Who shall rule and who shall prevail?

The **Rénjūn** [人君, Human Sovereign] serves the **Tiāndào** [天道, Heavenly Dao] to establish the realm,
And must delegate authority to the **Mùbó fān bǐng** [牧伯藩屏, Regional Governors and Protective Ministers];
The **Shàngdì** [上帝, Supreme Emperor] grasps the **Huàquán** [化权, Transformative Authority] to govern all things,
And truly entrusts the **Yuèdú shénqí** [岳渎神祇, Mountain and Altar Deities] with this duty.

Thus, the **Zhěngshén chénshì** [主圣臣贤, Sovereign of Saints and Minister of Worthies]
Holds authority over rewards and punishments to govern their lives;
The **Tiāndì shénqí** [天地神祇, Heavenly and Earthly Deities]
Record merit and determine their deaths.

The ritual is set forth for the **Jīshàn jī'è** [积善积恶, Accumulation of Good and Evil],
So that none may escape the **Yīshēng yīsǐ** [一生一死, Cycle of Life and Death].

The **Míng** [明, Bright] has its basis in human judgment,
The **Yōu** [幽, Dark] must suffer the **Guǐzé** [鬼责, Ghostly Retribution].

Thus, those who conceal their faults and adorn their vices,
Shall not escape the **Guānxíng** [邦刑, Realm’s Punishments];
Those who harbor deceit and conceal wickedness,
Shall surely receive the **Tiānfá** [天罚, Heavenly Punishments].

Even those who are first to be punished for their transgressions,
Are also contained within the **Guófǎ** [国法, National Law];
Those who plead for mercy and beg for compassion,
Must surely be explained by the **Míngsī** [冥司, Netherworld Officials].

Hence, there is the **Chóngzhēn** [崇真, Venerating the True] **Dàojiào** [大醮, Grand Ritual],
Truly exerting **Qínhuǐ** [勤悔, Sincere Repentance] for past transgressions.
We kneel and reverently address the Four Quarters,
And turn our hearts to the **Yuèdì** [岳帝, Peak Emperor].
We pray to entrust our supplications to Your benevolent discernment,
And open the gates of pardon and forgiveness.
Examine our humble pleas in this moment,
And rescue the **Zuihún** [罪魂, Guilty Spirits] from eternal night.

Our supplications are divinely inspired,
And presented before the **Zhìzhēn Wújí Dào** [至真无极道, Supreme True Boundless Dao].

**Repentance and Supplication, Threefold Declarations, Threefold Homages.**

We humbly and devoutly present this supplication to:
The **Xūwú zìrán Jīnquè qībǎo Dìshàng** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝, Void-Natural Jade-Gated Seven-Treasured Emperor],
The **Dōnggōng jiàozhǔ Tàiyǐ jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊, Eastern Palace Teaching Sovereign, Great Unity Saving the Suffering Heavenly Worthy],
The **Chuánjīng yǎnjiào lìdài shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真, Lineage Masters Who Transmit Scriptures and Explain Teachings Across Generations],
The **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝, Eastern Peak Great Mountain Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Sacred Emperor],
The **Shúmíng huánghòu** [淑明皇后, Virtuous and Illuminating Empress],
The **Yuèxià wénwǔ kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校, Civil and Martial Officials Beneath the Peak],
All **Yīqiè cáoliáo** [一切曹僚, All Officials],
The **Sānjiè yìnggǎn** [三界应感, Three Realms Responding to Sentiments],
And **Yīqiè zhēnlíng** [一切真灵, All True Spirits].

With sincere devotion, I humbly appeal to Your boundless compassion and pray for Your radiant illumination of my earnest plea.

I have heard that the wood element thrives in the East, truly the domain where souls are enshrined;
That the mountain overlooks the State of Lu, especially revered for its rites of veneration.
Crowned among the Five Peaks as the sole exalted one,
Encompassing all spirits as the most noble.

Examining the records of ancient intent, its name is held in greater esteem than that of the Heavenly Son;
Following the customs of the age, its scriptures are preserved in the Golden Repository.
Life’s allotted span, whether long or short, is verified by the auspicious omen of the Martial Emperor’s inspection of the ledgers;
The registers of duties, as seen when the Green-Browed Officials arrive with their records.

For indeed, the origins of life and its end are all governed by the Mountain Spirit’s decree.
From beginning to end, it both bestows life and presides over death.
The Twenty-Four Prisons eternally bind malevolence and weave deceit;
The Eighty-Six Offices meticulously record merit and transcribe faults.

Thus, with unwavering devotion, I reflect upon the departed souls of the past.
Considering the perils of mortal existence, one may incur the sins of countless rebirths.
Once confined within the **Yòuláo** [狴牢], escape from imprisonment is difficult;
Frequently subjected to cruel beatings, the suffering is unbearable.

Therefore, I earnestly seek Your mercy for expiation,
And with utmost reverence, offer prayers in supplication.

The ministers, at the outset of our rites and the very beginning of the altar’s establishment,
now follow the Celestial Worthy’s decree and reverently proclaim the Sincere Words of the Ritual Master.
We solemnly present the Altar’s Invocation.

**Proclamation of Words:**
Carefully examining each phrase, their depth is filled with profound sorrow.
For we lament the dead and mourn the departed,
laying bare our hearts and pouring forth our souls.
Deeply concerned that accumulated sins may bind the soul to the Underworld,
or that unclear records may bring disgrace at the hands of prison guards,
we humbly present our plea and pray for mercy and compassion.

We seek to purge transgressions—
spared from ignorance and unawareness,
yet granted the sincerity of the common and devout,
knowing their reverence and filial piety.

As the wind-steeds and cloud-chariots descend upon the fasting altar,
and the rainbow banners and crimson flags welcome the celestial procession,
we gaze upward to True Compassion,
and below, we seek to bestow hidden blessings.

The ministers, with utmost sincerity, now establish this pure space
and initiate the grand rites.
We humbly beseech the Supreme Three Sovereigns and the Ten Directions’ Holy Assembly
to descend in spirit, inspect, and discern our sincere devotion.

We pray that the Celestial Officials of this land and domain be commanded
to unite in harmony, exert their strength in defense,
cleanse both within and without, purify the altar grounds,
subdue demons and quash malevolent spirits,
so that we may find peace of mind and spirit,
our devotions instantly fulfilled,
our petitions ascending without obstruction,
and our virtuous deeds completed as desired.

Now, in accordance with the ritual stages, we proceed step by step.
**Twelve Vows.**

**Reigniting the Incense Furnace:**
We solemnly command the Incense Officials, the Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords,
and the Attendant Spirit Officials—
that at the very place where I have previously conducted nocturnal rites,
golden elixirs and emerald jade, mushrooms and sacred herbs,
and all the numinous spirits shall naturally gather.
May the Ten Directions’ Celestial Youth and Jade Maidens attend to the incense smoke,
transmitting my sincere invocations directly to the Supreme, Boundless, and Ultimate Dao,
before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Celestial Court.

**Exiting the Hall to Chant Praises.**
**Exiting the Door.**

**Daoist Rituals Comprehensive Canon, Volume Eighty-First: The Great Ritual of the Eastern Peak (Jizhu) for Salvation and Petition**

**Morning Rites:**
At dawn, the ritual stages proceed as prescribed.
The ritual platform is ascended according to form.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Daoist rites.

**Proclaiming Sacred Incantations for Protection:**
The Azure Yang (青阳) casts its radiant light,
Illuminating the sun’s return to life.
The Spirit Tiger wards off malevolence,
The Flying Heavens toll their celestial bells.
The wicked are crushed, the evil destroyed,
Ten thousand demons bound in form.
The Nine Mysteries (九微) circulate the Dao,
The Eight Powers (八威) subdue the spirits.
A thousand numinous beings (千真) register their presence,
The Three Realms (三元) dispel impurities.

Left, the Yellow Dragon is summoned,
Right, the Six Celestial Officials (六丁) are invoked.
Seven revolutions, eight harmonizations,
Orbiting the Heavenly Scriptures.
The sacred aura stands majestic,
The Dao begins its course.
Auspicious clouds flow forth,
The gathered brilliance of the Yellow Court (黄庭) aligns with the Dao,
As the true and the Dao merge.

The Sacred Law Drum (法鼓) is struck twenty-four times.

**Reigniting the Incense Furnace:**
We summon the Supreme Three Heavens, the Primordial Origin of the Three *Qi* (三炁),
The Most High Dao Lord (道君), and the Most High Lao Lord (老君),
To bring forth from my body the **Thirty-Five Celestial Officials** (三五功曹),
Left and Right Officials and Messengers (左右官使者),
Left and Right Bearers of Incense (左右捧香),
The Postal Dragons and Mounted Envoys (驿龙骑吏),
The Golden Youth Attendants (侍香金童),
The Jade Maidens who transmit words and scatter flowers (传言散花玉女),
The Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols (五帝直符),
The Incense Officials of the Direct Sun (直日香官),
And all **Thirty-Six Persons** (三十六人) to emerge.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
With caps and sashes trailing their ceremonial plumes.
The Land and Spirit Officials of the Mystic Platform (玄坛) are opened,
And the regional deities and numinous spirits are invoked.

Now, at this dawn ritual,
I humbly present my intentions.
My sincerity is profound,
Already recorded and heard by the Celestial.
I pray that the Most High Dao *Qi* (十方至真道炁) of the Ten Directions,
The Sacred Treasure of Auspicious Light (灵宝瑞光),
Descend and flow into my body,
So that my invocations may swiftly reach
The Most High, Boundless Dao (无极大道),
And the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Gate (金阙玉皇上帝御前).

**Requesting the Invocation of the Sacred Law Position:**
The assembled petitioners of the **Sacred Law Position** (法位),
With utmost reverence and sincerity,
Beseech the **Supreme, Natural, Golden Gate, Seven Treasures Emperor** (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),
The Eastern Palace’s **Great Unity Teacher, the Most High Saviour of Suffering** (教主太乙救苦天尊),
The lineage of Masters who transmit the scriptures and expound the teachings (传经演教历代师真),
The **Eastern Peak, Tai Mountain, Celestial Harmony and Benevolence Emperor** (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),
The **Virtuous and Auspicious Empress** (淑明皇后),
The **Noble Prince and Consort** (太子贵妃),
The **Illustrious Spirit Official of the Hall** (殿上炳灵公),
The **Spirit King of Western Harmony** (西齐灵王),
The **Literary and Martial Examiners beneath the Peak** (岳下文武考校),
All Celestial Officials (一切曹僚),
The Three Realms’ responsive spirits (三界应感),
And all numinous beings (一切真灵).

All look upon the boundless mercy,
And descend to manifest the sacred compassion.
We hear that within the **Five Celestial Officials** (五明官),
The Celestial Sovereign pities those in the cycle of rebirth;
And in the **Eastern Extremity Officials** (东极官),
The Great Unity (太乙) always rescues those in suffering.

Indeed, for the ignorant masses,
They do not know the noble ones of Heaven and Earth,
And drift like boats in the boundless sea of desire,
Drowning in the river of attachment.
Their sins have already accumulated,
Their karmic bonds are difficult to escape,
Because of their greed for life, they lose life,
And because of their pursuit of suffering, they obtain suffering.
Once they depart this world,
They long strike the **Yin Court** (阴司).
Thus, the Most High opens the **Gate of Salvation** (济度之门),
And only those of true virtue (真格) may be recommended for elevation,
Allowed to return with sincerity and repent their sins,
And attain liberation from judgment to ascend.

While worldly entanglements remain,
They cannot escape the **Six Roots of Impurity** (根尘之六);
But the **Broad Reach of the Sacred Law** (冲科广被)
Will surely hear the **Three Declarations of Pardon** (赦宥之三).
How could they not take pity on the foolish?
And yet, they may still deeply harbor those who repent.

The humble petitioners of the Dao,
With sorrow and suffering as our offerings,
And blood shed in sincerity,
Lament the swift passage of time,
And reflect deeply on the suffering of the **Netherworld** (幽圄).
We look to the **Peak’s Celestial Court** (岳府),
Which truly receives the lost souls of the departed;
And with reverence, we set up the **fasting altar** (斋坛),
Hoping to move the Emperor’s intentions.

Having prepared our words and intent,
We dare not fail to present them.

**Proclaiming the Words:**
As the words are spoken,
The deep lament and pity are manifest.
Indeed, the rites for the departed are called **Great Matters** (大事),
And those who face mourning must double their sorrow.
Though the departed cannot be recalled,
And the **Elixir of the Night** (夜丹) cannot be retained;
Yet the living truly hold sorrow and gratitude,
And the sincerity of the fasting rites extends.

Deeply contemplating the **Netherworld’s Judges** (管摄之冥司),
Who are indeed the **lofty Eastern Peak** (崇高之岱岳),
We fear that the souls may still be bound in **affliction** (缧绁),
And thus, we must **widely establish the means of salvation** (津梁).

With utmost sincerity and devotion,
We pray for purification and transcendence.
On this pure dawn,
We perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),
And request the **Law Assembly** (法众) to light the first incense strand.
May this fragrant smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To offer homage to the **Jade Purity Supreme Venerable** (玉清圣境元始天尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Dao Treasures** (十方道宝).

We, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
And dedicate these merits to bless our present Emperor.
Thus, under the **Emperor’s virtuous reign** (尧日),
The eight directions equally bask in his radiance;
And the **harmonious winds of Shun’s era** (舜风) bring prosperity to all beings.
Weapons rest without conflict, prisons stand empty without punishment,
For **virtue’s power** (德) is vast in cherishing life,
And the realm attains **Ren’s eternal longevity** (仁寿).

The **Yellow Banner** advances southward,
With auspicious qi eternally descending upon **Fighter and Ox** (斗牛);
The **Green Sea** returns westward,
Where no wails disturb the **war spirits** (战鬼).

The **Five Auspicious Blessings** (五福) are bestowed upon the virtuous people,
And the **Great Peace** (泰治) endures for ten thousand years,
Preserving the boundless **imperial mandate** (无疆之历).

Now, we burn incense in devotion,
And **take refuge in the Supreme Sage’s most authentic virtue** (至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
We ascend to **Non-Action** (无为),
And harmonize with the **True Dao** (道合真).

As it is said:
The **Pearl Mouth Gathering** (珠口) gathers the True,
And aligns the **halted light of sun and moon** (停景);
The **Cavernous Chapter** (洞章) emits a call,
And the mountains and rivers swallow the mist.

Through the **resonant clouds** (流响之云营),
The wandering celestial sages (游空之仙圣) are moved.

On this pure dawn,
We perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),
And request the **Law Assembly** (法众) to light the second incense strand.
May this fragrant smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To offer homage to the **Supreme True Realm’s Venerable** (上清真境灵宝天尊),
And the **Supreme Scripture Treasures** (无上经宝).

We, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
And dedicate these merits to the **Ritual Master** (醮主) and his household,
To the **Yearly Star Deity** (太岁尊神) presiding over this dwelling,
And to the **tabooed branches and stems** (支干禁忌),
The **door and gate officials** (门丞户尉),
The **monthly and daily calamities** (月煞日游),
So as to avert misfortune and offense,
And invite the blessings of peaceful abode,
Free from fear and resentment,
Each coming with reverence and delight,
Their thoughts pure and their words auspicious,
Listening to the **introduction of blessings** (介福).

Now, we burn incense in devotion,
And **take refuge in the Scripture Sage’s most authentic virtue** (至真之德).
After attaining the Dao,
We ascend to the **Formless** (无形),
And harmonize with the **True Dao** (道合真).

As it is said:
Reciting the **Nine-Heaven Scripture Treasures** (九天之宝章),
One attains the **Three Officials’ records** (三官之考算);
Studying the **Three Caverns’ doctrines** (三洞之科典),
One earns the protection of the **Hundred Spirits** (百灵之护持).
If one follows the **Great Pattern’s grandeur** (大范之巍巍),
One shall surely receive the **distant blessings** (遐福之简简).

On this pure dawn,
We perform the **Celestial Assembly Rites** (朝元行道),
And request the **Law Assembly** (法众) to light the third incense strand with mercy,
May this fragrant smoke ascend straight to the heavens,
To offer homage to the **Supreme Clarity’s Celestial Realm’s Venerable** (太清仙境降生天尊),
And the **Ten Directions’ Teacher Treasures** (十方师宝).

We, the subjects, **surrender body, spirit, and fate** (皈身、皈神、皈命),
And dedicate these merits to the **Ritual Master** (醮主) and his household,
That their gates flourish and their clans prosper,
Their homes ever sing of **Peach Blossom’s joy** (桃夭),
And their children forever praise **the harvest’s abundance** (芣苢).

Calamities are swept away like mist dissolving into ice,
While blessings multiply like mountains halting the floods.
Auspiciousness grows ever grand.

---

Let those who **master scriptures and enter officialdom** (明经入仕) swiftly ascend to **high rank** (青紫);
Those who till the fields and labor at harvest (服田力穑) accumulate wealth in their granaries (倉箱).

The **rites of virtue and merit** (式彰善积) honor households where good deeds abound,
And such families need not fear **spectral scrutiny** (鬼瞰) of their halls.

Now, as we burn the incense,
We **surrender ourselves** (皈依) to the **Ritual Master’s Venerable Great Saints** (師尊大聖), seeking the **Perfect Virtue** (至真之德).
After attaining the **Dao/Way** (得道), we rise into the **formless** (升入無形),
And harmonize with the **Dao/Way’s True Essence** (和與道合真).

**Repentance and homage** (忏方) are offered—three invocations, three rites.
We, the **humble subjects of various ranks** (具位臣某等),
With **sincere devotion** (同誠上啟), now address:
The **Natural Void’s Golden Gate, Seven Treasures’ Celestial Sovereign** (虛無自然金闕七寶上帝),
The **Eastern Palace’s Preceptor, the Great Primordial Saving-Suffering Celestial Master** (東宮教主太乙救苦天尊),
The **Transmission Masters of successive generations** (傳經演教歷代師真),
The **Eastern Peak’s Celestial Equal of Benevolence, Venerable Holy Emperor** (東嶽泰山天齊仁聖帝),
The **Chaste and Illustrious Consort** (淑明皇后),
The **Noble Prince** (太子),
The **Noble Concubine** (貴妃),
And the **Luminous Spirit Official** (殿上炳靈公),
The **Spirit King of Western Qi** (西齊靈王),
The **martial and civil examiners beneath the peak** (嶽下文武考校),
All **clerks and officials** (一切曹僚),
The **Three Realms’ responsive spirits** (三界應感),
And all **true numinous beings** (一切真靈).

May they all **respond to our profound mercy** (咸望洪慈),
And **descend to reveal our sincere supplications** (俯昭丹懇).

We, the subjects, have heard:
That **mourners for the deceased** (哀死事亡) must cherish **firm resolve as if they still lived** (要笃如存之志);
And those who **tread frost and damp** (履霜濡露) will **always bear remembrance of the past** (必懷追往之心).

With **books filling the forests** (書籍滿林), one may **trace their former deeds by hand** (驗手容而可想);
With **ink and paper on the desk** (桮槎在案), one knows **their words still linger** (知口澤之猶存).

In their **living days**, we knew their **sickness, pain, and afflictions** (疾痛痾痒);
Now, in their **departed state**, how dare we **forget their bonds and torments** (拘滞沉迷)?

Though the **path divides the living and the dead** (路隔幽明),
Their **sufferings are hard to bear vicariously** (苦惱虽難於代受);
Yet **affection binds us**, and our **solemn offerings are for their deliverance** (情緣親愛，荐嚴專務於追修).

No spirit is **greater than the peak’s ancestral guardian** (神莫大於嶽宗),
Whose **authority oversees the spectral records** (權常司於鬼錄),
Ever discerning **deeds of merit and fault** (每察知於功過),
And **governing life and death** (式兼制於死生).

Deeply reflecting on the **departed souls** (往逝之魂),
We fear their **transgressions may not be absolved** (愆尤難免);
Lest they linger in the **realms of confinement** (拘囚之地),
With **no means of liberation** (解脱無由).

With **all our mortal sincerity** (用罄凡誠),
We **pray for benevolent pardon** (仰祈善貸),
To **cleanse their sins from the black register** (洗罪名於黑簿),
And **refine their mortal essence into the yellow flower** (煉生質於黃華),
Swiftly passing the **underworld gates** (速出泉關),
And **early ascending to the Dao’s shore** (早登道岸).

Above, we **acknowledge the Celestial Master’s vast mercy** (上明天尊大慈之澤),
Below, we **fulfill our subjects’ surrender of fate** (下副臣等皈命之誠),
And **submit our supplications** (謹啟以聞).

**Twelve Vows** (十二願).
**Reignite the censer** (復爐).

We **solemnly dispatch the incense officials and messengers** (謹摄香官使者):
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords** (左右龍虎君),
And the **attendant spirits of the incense** (侍香諸靈官),
That they may **command our former sacred assembly** (當令臣向來清旦行道之所)
To **naturally produce golden nectar, emerald jade, and numinous herbs** (自然生金液丹碧，芝英百靈),
Where **all true spirits gather** (眾真交會),
At this **incense censer** (在此香火爐前).

We **now vow** that the **celestial youths and jade maidens of the Ten Directions** (十方仙童玉女)
Shall **attend and receive the fragrant vapors** (接侍蘭煙),
And **transmit our former supplications** (傳臣向來所啟之誠)
Swiftly to the **Primordial, Boundless Dao/Way of the Supreme Celestial Sovereign** (速達径御至真無極大道、昊天玉皇上帝御前).

**Exit the hall and chant** (出堂頌).
**Exit the door** (出戸).

The **Supreme Unoriginated Three-in-One Primordial Dao/Way** (无上三天玄元始三炁),
The **Supreme Dao/Way Lord** (太上道君),
The **Supreme Venerable Lord Lao** (太上老君),
**Summon forth** from within my body:
The **Three Five Functionaries** (三五功曹),
The **Left and Right Official Messengers** (左右官使者),
The **Left and Right Incense-Bearers** (左右捧香),
The **Dragon-Courier Officials** (驿龙骑吏),
The **Golden Boys Attending Incense** (侍香金童),
The **Jade Maidens Scattering Flowers** (传言散花玉女),
The **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans** (五帝直符),
The **Direct-Day Incense Officials** (直日香官),
**A total of thirty-six** (合三十六人) **emerge.**

**Those who exit** (出者) **don their solemn robes and adorned headgear** (严装显服, 冠带垂缨),
**Opening the Mystic Altars of the Local Deities and Territorial Spirits** (关启玄坛土地, 方域神真).

**My solemn declaration at high noon:**
I **humbly present my intentions** (谨奏为宣意),
**My sincere supplications have been recorded and transmitted** (其诸情悃, 已录告闻).
I **pray that the Supreme Dao/Way’s Ten-Directional True Qi** (太上十方至真道炁) and **Numinous Treasures of Auspicious Light** (灵宝瑞光) descend,
**Flowing into my body** (流入臣身中),
So that **my supplications may swiftly reach** (令臣所启, 速达) the **Supreme Unoriginated Dao/Way** (太上无极大道) and the **Celestial Jade Gate Sovereign Emperor of the High Heaven** (昊天金阙玉皇上帝御前).

**Invoke the ritual ranks** (请称法位).
**The undersigned officials** (具位臣某等),
**With utmost reverence and sincerity, humbly present our supplications to:**
The **Void-Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Celestial Sovereign** (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),
The **Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Celestial Lord of the Tao** (东宫教主太乙救苦天尊),
The **Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral Worthies of Past Ages** (传经演教历代师真),
The **Eastern Peak, Mount Tai, Celestial Equilibrium Benevolent and Righteous Emperor** (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),
The **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress** (淑明皇后),
The **Crown Prince and Noble Consort** (太子贵妃),
The **Illustrious Spirit Lord of the Hall** (殿上炳灵公),
The **Western Qi Spirit King** (西齐灵王),
The **Civil and Martial Officials Beneath the Peak** (岳下文武考校),
**All functionaries and spirits of the Three Realms** (一切曹僚, 三界应感),
**All True Spirits** (一切真灵).

**May all behold the boundless compassion** (咸望洪慈),
**And graciously descend to fulfill our earnest prayers** (俯垂丹恳).

**My understanding:**
The **Trigram Zhèn governs the Great Way** (处震卦而为大涂), **rightfully ranking first among all things.**
**Ascending Mount Tai, one surveys the world** (登泰山而小天下), **ever presiding over the foremost of all sacrifices.**
The **East is the origin of life** (东乃始生之方), **Tai the pivot of cosmic governance** (岱为管摄之地).
**Life begins facing east** (生必东首), **as ancient wisdom knew the proper orientation.**
**Qi arises from the eastern horizon** (气起东隅), **manifesting the Creator’s benevolent and nurturing intent** (造物全温厚之致).
Thus, **the Peak Emperor’s Virtue** (岳帝之德) **truly aligns with Heaven’s Benevolence** (实符天道之仁).
**Virtue seeks life** (德本好生), **and must absolve the guilty.**
**Benevolence aids all** (仁惟济众), **and surely extends boundless grace** (岂不广布於洪恩).
**He governs life’s passage** (既司出入之机) and **determines the measure of existence** (皇制短长之命).
**If one turns to the True Dao,** they **shall be spared death and granted rebirth** (必蒙释死以兴生).
**For the dead are most pitiful** (况死者人之所甚), **long lost in endless night.**
**While the living are most fortunate** (而生者人之所大), **longing to dwell in the radiant age** (欲愿长处於明时).
**Since life and death differ by merit and sin,** some **meet early demise** (享年有寿夭之异).
**Once severed from the mortal world,** they **suddenly perish** (迹已绝於人世, 遽至殂亡);
**Their spirits must journey to the Eastern Peak** (魂必往於岱宗), **yet their sins remain unexpiated** (未蠲罪累).
**Though they seek mercy and repentance,** they **cannot atone for past transgressions** (未能补过以涤除).

**My family, devoted to the Dao,** **lament the dead and mourn the departed** (奉道某家哀死悼亡), **reflecting on past and present.**
**The grave separates us forever** (念重泉之顿隔), **with no means to ascend.**
**Only the Marvelous Dao offers salvation** (惟妙道之可凭), **and I humbly seek transcendence** (仰干超度).
**Now, the path to the Central Altar is opened** (爰企升中之地广开), **the gate of deliverance stands ajar** (解厄之门于时).
**At high noon, the sun’s brilliance illuminates all** (阳景方中, 尽幽遐而徧照);
**The midday incense clock marks the hour** (昼漏停午), **the platform stands pure and unsoiled** (肃坛陛以无尘).
**I envision the saints’ arrival** (想众圣之来临), **and the ascent of mortal sincerity** (顾凡情之上达).
**May boundless blessings be bestowed** (大颁善利), **and the departed swiftly guided** (速度亡魂).
**With these words of noon, my heartfelt plea is now proclaimed** (临午词诚, 谨当宣奏).

**Proclamation of the Words:**
**As the text declares, the sorrow is profound and unbearable** (按如词旨, 深切悲

With today’s midday Dao practice, we humbly request the assembled Daoists to light this first incense strand, praying that its fragrant smoke may ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Yuqing** [玉清] Holy Realm’s **Yuanshi Tianzun** [元始天尊], the Dao treasures of the Ten Directions.

We, the petitioners, **surrender our bodies, surrender our spirits, surrender our lives**, dedicating these merits to the departed soul of **[Name]**. May this merit cleanse the sins of countless past lives and earn the boundless grace of the **Sìqīng** [四清] [1].

With heartfelt sincerity, we silently move the **Emperor’s** [帝] heart to compassion; our prayers reach the heavens, beseeching mercy from above.

Knowing their past folly, we now implore this moment’s repentance—commanding the prison guards to release their chains, entrusting the **Sìmìng** [司命] to preserve their form. May they swiftly depart the path of darkness and attain the realm of **xiāoyáo** [逍遥].

Thus, we now burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.

As the teachings of **Yuanshi** declare, all are boundless in their salvation of beings.

---
[1] *Sìqīng* (四清): A Daoist triad of deities associated with purity and liberation (often linked to the **Yuqing** realm’s highest echelons). Retained here for conventional religious context.

At this moment, when the sun is at its zenith, we perform the Dao/Way’s rites, and humbly request that the assembled **Sìqīng** [四清] bear this two-pinched incense aloft. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Shàngqīng** [上清] True Realm’s **Língbǎo Tiānzūn** [灵宝天尊], the peerless **jīngbǎo** [经宝].

We now dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives—may this merit return to our departed ancestors and wayward souls. We earnestly pray for the erasure of their sinful records, the cessation of their **yīnsī** [阴司] reckonings, the extinguishing of their evil roots, and liberation from the suffering of their past lives. May they escape the **Shānhuǒ** [山火] prison’s unyielding bonds and be granted the mercy of the **Leiyǔ** [雷雨] deliverance.

Their transgressions of body, speech, and mind shall be cleansed; the **shénqí guǐ** [神祇鬼] who ensnare them shall be commanded to yield to the **Hánhóng** [涵洪] grace. May they meet the hour of resurrection, receive the transformation of rebirth, and follow the path of the lost to their wandering’s end, while witnessing our heartfelt sincerity.

Now we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.

We have heard: with the **yuán guī** [圆规] in hand, the **Tàihào** [太皞] presides over the square of the **Fāngzhě** [司方] realm; without waiting for dawn, the **Gōngyáng** [公羊] records the **Chùshí** [触石] merit. Indeed, the sacred peaks’ spirits strive to bestow blessings upon all mortals.

At this moment, when the sun is at its zenith, we perform the Dao/Way’s rites, and humbly request that the assembled **Sìqīng** [四清] bear this three-pinched incense aloft. May this fragrant smoke ascend directly to the heavens, offering reverence to the **Tàiqīng** [太清] Celestial Realm’s **Jiàngshēng Tiānzūn** [降生天尊], the Ten Directions’ **Shībǎo** [师宝].

We now dedicate our bodies, our spirits, and our lives—may this merit return to our departed ancestors and wayward souls. We earnestly pray for the **Àihé** [爱河]’s stilling waves and the **Kǔhǎi** [苦海]’s ceasing tides; that they, once deceived and unaware, now hear and instantly awaken.

The sacred peaks’ spirits descend their grace—may their souls soar free in the boundless void. The **Kōngdòng** [空洞] gives birth to spirits, merging their **Zhuī** [炁] essence with the **Fànfǔ** [梵辅] realm. Ever freed from the depths of suffering, swiftly granted the mercy of **Liàndù** [炼度].

Now we burn this incense, **taking refuge in the Dao’s Great Saints’ supreme virtue**. After attaining the Dao, they shall ascend to the formless, harmonizing with the True and the Way.

**Chànyuán** [忏方], three invocations, three obeisances.

Your humble servants of the **Jùwèi** [具位] ranks, with utmost sincerity, now prostrate ourselves before the **Xūwú Zìrán Jīnquè Qībǎo Shàngdì** [虚无自然金阙七宝上帝], the **Dōnggōng Jiàozhǔ Tàiyǎ Jiùkǔ Tiānzūn** [东宫教主太乙救苦天尊], the **Chuánjīng Yǎnjiào Lìdài Shīzhēn** [传经演教历代师真], the **Dōngyuè Tàishān Tiānqí Rénshèng Dì** [东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝], the **Shúmíng Huánghòu** [淑明皇后], the **Tàizǐ Guìfēi** [太子贵妃], the **Diànshàng Bǐnglíng Gōng** [殿上炳灵公], the **Xīqí Língwáng** [西齐灵王], the **Yuèxià Wénwǔ Kǎoxiào** [岳下文武考校], all **Yīqiè Cáoliáo** [一切曹僚], the **Sānjiè Yìnggǎn** [三界应感], and all **Yīqiè Zhēnlíng** [一切真灵].

May they all behold the vast mercy and descend to illuminate our humble supplications.

We have heard: when the **Wèitóng** [会同] gathers the Five Elders, the **Tiānzūn** [天尊] always listens to the Law; when the **Guāngzhào Jiǔyōu** [光照九幽] shines upon the Nine Depths, the **Fǎjiě** [法解] arises through prayerful invocation.

Deeply moved by the suffering of the **Sāntú** [三涂], we are especially grieved by the hardships of the **Wǔkǔ** [五苦]. To examine and punish the guilty spirits, there are the **Jùtiān Lìshì** [巨天力士]; to enforce the strict laws of the **Yīnyù** [阴狱], there are the **Zhífǎ Shénbīng** [执法神兵].

The **Jiànshù Dāoshān** [剑树刀山] sever sinews and shatter bones; the **Liàngtāng Lúitàn** [镬汤炉炭] reduce flesh to ash. The **Niǎozhuó Shéyīn** [鸟啄蛇吞] and the **Lígēng Jùjiě** [犁耕锯解] bring torment beyond measure. Such suffering is truly lamentable.

Fortunately, the **Shàngshèng** [上圣]’s boundless compassion teaches the causes of their plight; the **Zhēnrén** [真人]’s pity allows them to know the path of virtuous conduct.

Though bound by the **Sānyè** [三业] and stained by the **Liùchén** [六尘], they follow their desires, unaware that the **Shíhuǒ** [石火] moment cannot be halted. In receiving retribution and calamity, they only prolong the **Yèfēi** [夜扉]’s endless closure.

Yet even now, they may reform their hearts and turn toward the Dao, all granted deliverance from judgment and purification from sin.

To cultivate vast fields of merit, they must rely on the **Lánghán** [琅函] scriptures; to exalt the **Shènghào** [圣号], none surpass the **Dōngjí** [东极] **Tiānzūn** [天尊].

Truly, this clears the roots of doubt and allows them to grasp the **Xīyí** [希夷] mysteries.

Your humble servant, **Dìngguān** [醮官], in deep reflection, fears that the **Àifāng** [哀方] suffer more in death than in life, their sins accumulating even in their brief existence. The **Yèwǎng** [业网] remains unbroken, and the **Fǎqiáo** [法桥] is yet unreached. They must now depend on the **Miàoshàn** [妙善] to purge their past transgressions.

Thus, we solemnly prepare the **Zhāi tán** [斋坛], and with utmost reverence, perform the **Rùlǐ** [褥礼] rites.

Named **Xiānshēng** [先嵩], we ever raise our heads to gaze afar; our faces turn toward the **Yúntíng** [云亭], our hearts yearning for divine compassion.

The **Dānyú** [丹舆] and **Lǜbèi** [绿辈] await the swift arrival of the **Biāoxū** [飙忽]; the **Yǔgài** [羽盖] and **Níqíng** [霓旌] hope for the descending **Wēirúi** [葳蕤].

May they discern our sincere devotion and open wide the gates of deliverance. May the **Jiùkǔ Shàngzhēn** [救苦上真] respond in kind; may the **Zhìchuí** [坠魄] souls, once submerged, now submit and take form.

Swiftly may they meet the **Nánjí** [南极]’s **Zhùshēng** [注生], and also gain the **Běidū** [北都]’s **Bùwèi** [部卫]. Gradually ascending the **Xiānlù** [仙路], they shall not stray from the path, and all shall be granted equal harmony in life and death.

Above, we honor the **Tiānzūn** [天尊]’s vast mercy; below, we fulfill our servants’ **Guīmìng** [皈命] sincerity. Thus we humbly report.

**Shíèr yuàn** [十二愿]. **Fùlú** [复炉].

We now solemnly command the **Xiāngguān Shǐzhě** [香官使者], the **Zuǒyòu Lónghǔ Jūn** [左右龙虎君], and the **Shìxiāng Zhūlǐngguān** [侍香诸灵官], to bring us to the place where we once performed the Dao/Way’s rites at noon. There, **Jīnyè Dānbì** [金液丹碧] and **Zhīyīng Bǎilíng** [芝英百灵] shall naturally arise, and all **Zhōngzhēn** [众真] shall gather at this incense altar.

May the **Shífāng Xiānróng Yùnǚ** [十方仙童玉女] attend to the **Lántián** [兰烟], swiftly conveying our servants’ sincere supplications to the **Zhìxīng Wújí Dàdào** [至真无极大道] and the **Hàotiān Yùhuáng Shàngdì** [昊天玉皇上帝] before the **Yuè** [御].

**Chūtáng sòng** [出堂颂]. **Chūhù** [出户].

**Dao/Way Gate Ritual Standards Complete Collection, Volume Eighty-Two Complete**
**Dao/Way Gate Ritual Standards Complete Collection, Volume Eighty-Three**
**Eastern Peak Rescue and Salvation Petitionary Great Ritual Ceremony**
**Evening Dao/Way Practice**

The ritual proceedings ascend the platform as prescribed.
Each pays homage to the Master in accordance with the Dao/Way.

**Proclaim the Sacred Protective Incantations.**
The Five Stars shine resplendent, auspicious *qi* ascends in flight.
The Primordial Sovereign gathers the spirits; Heaven and Earth complete their cycles.
Jade talismans and sacred seals resound with imperious command to the hidden realms.
Flames are cast forth in display of might—evil and malevolent forces shall not linger.
Ten thousand demons submit in trembling; chaotic passions dissolve.
Monstrous evils are crushed, malevolence extinguished—Dao/Way *qi* circulates universally.
Divine radiance illuminates the night; all obscurity is dispelled.
Ten thousand spirits descend in order, their banners borne on the wind.
All living beings prosper; divine blessings pervade the land, harmonizing with the True Dao/Way.

**Strike the ritual drum twenty-four times.**
**Ignite the incense.**

To the **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Sovereign of the Three *Qi*** [三炁], **Supreme Dao/Way Lord**, **Supreme Venerable Lord Laozi**—
We now summon from within our bodies the **Three Five Officials of Merit**, the **Left and Right Official Envoys**, the **Left and Right Incense-Bearers**, the **Relay Dragon Cavalry Clerks**, the **Incense-Serving Golden Boys**, the **Speech-Conveying Scattered-Flower Jade Girls**, the **Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Direct-Sun Incense Officials**—**thirty-six in total**—to emerge.

Those who emerge shall don resplendent attire and ceremonial insignia, their headgear adorned with trailing ribbons.
The **Mysterious Platform’s Earth and Domain Spirits** are hereby opened.

Now, in this quiet night of Dao/Way practice, we humbly present our intentions.
All sincere supplications have been recorded and reported.
May the **Supreme Dao/Way’s Ten Directions’ True *Qi*** and **Sacred Treasure Auspicious Light** descend upon us, flowing into our bodies,
So that our petitions may swiftly reach the **Supreme Dao/Way of the Boundless**, the **Jade Gate Celestial Sovereign of the High Heaven**.

**Request the proclamation of the ritual rank.**

We, the officials of rank **[具位臣某等]**, with utmost sincerity, now humbly present our supplications to:
The **Void-Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasures Celestial Sovereign**,
The **Eastern Palace Preceptor, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Venerable of the Jade Tripod**,
The **Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral Masters of All Generations**,
The **Eastern Peak Tai Mountain, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor**,
The **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress**,
The **Crown Prince and Noble Consort**,
The **Splendid-Spirit Official of the Hall**,
The **Western Qi Spirit King**,
The **Literary and Martial Examiners Beneath the Peak**,
All officials and attendants,
The **Three Realms of Responsive Spirits**,
All **True Spirits and Sacred Beings**.

May they all behold the vast mercy and deign to reveal the crimson sincerity.

We have heard:
*"Sealing the golden mud"*—this duty remains with the sovereign;
*"The jade scroll’s transmission"*—this decree governs the order of humanity.
Above, it connects with the empty void of Heaven, thus called the **Celestial Realm of the Immortals**;
Below, it governs life and death, serving as the **Yin Officials’ registry**.

Yet we reflect upon the recently departed souls—
Their **black ledgers** of sins may yet remain unexpunged.
Though crimes are not yet recorded, their severity must be weighed in lightness and depth;
Though intentions seek severe punishment, they must be allowed room for **repentance in sorrow**.

All may thus tread the path of renewal, knowing the period of transformation.

Moreover, the **Heavenly Venerable of Rescue and Life**—
All originate from the **Eastern Residence** to enlighten;
Even the **Chanting Officials of Reverence and Compliance**—
Follow the **Eastern Direction** in reciting their hymns.

We know the **Peak Emperor’s benevolence** does not reject the pleas of mortals.

The ritual officials, grieving the swift passage of life like a galloping steed—
Already separated from the living by the veil of death;
Fearful of the **unwholesome *qi* of the horse**, ever drawn to perilous paths—
In life, they violated the **Awakened Ones’ intentions**;
In death, they suffer boundless torment.
Falling into Hell, they must harbor pain and regret;
In the human world, they should strive for **posthumous rectification**.

Thus may they move the **Emperor’s heart**, or even turn his **wrathful *qi**—
The roots of karma and the nets of sin shall dissolve like mist and ice;
The fruits of virtue and fields of blessing shall unfold like clouds and rain.

The **Three Primordials** nurture their essence—
Now they hear the **Great Unity’s talisman-bearer**;
The **Eight Auspicious Scenes** manifest their spirits—
Again, they receive the **Emperor’s decree of rank**.

Now, with the **midnight watch** just struck and the **first hour’s tally** announced,
The **bright moon** hangs high, framing the boundless sky—
It is fitting to **present our grievances**,
To offer our **sincere fasting words**,
And solemnly **proclaim our petitions**.

**Proclamation of Words:**
As the words declare, with profound pity and sorrow—
We have heard:
*"Without the Primordial Sovereign’s talismans and decrees, one cannot ascend the stages of transcendence and elevation;
Without the Jade Emperor’s proclamation of names, one cannot attain the realm of immortality."*

We must rely on the **Supreme Dao/Way** to rescue the lost souls,
Transforming the **artificial into the natural**, the **formed into the formless**,
Following the **Direct Path’s regulations** to present our petitions,
Hoping the **Celestial Chariot** may swiftly arrive,
Further revealing our **grief and sorrow**, and beseeching **compassionate mercy**.

Now, as the evening’s light fades and the Dao/Way practice begins,
We request the assembled ritualists to take this **first incense offering**,
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
To offer worship to the **Pure Celestial Sacred Realm’s Primordial Sovereign** and the **Ten Directions’ Dao/Way Treasures**.

We, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,
And dedicate these merits to the **ritual official’s household**, all kin and dependents—
May those who have passed receive early elevation to the **Path of the Immortals**;
May the living enjoy longevity and blessings, reaching **venerable old age**.
With **snow-white hair and furrowed brows**, they shall stand as pillars, never faltering like the **distant crane**;
With **hunched backs and protruding teeth**, they shall lean on their staffs, as sturdy as the **sacred tortoise**.
The **Yellow Register** shall erase the records of death;
The **Green Flower** shall inscribe the ledgers of extended years.
The **Heavenly Bestowal** shall grant the **rare blessing of non-aging**,
And the **Great Sovereign’s lament** shall be silenced.

Now, we burn this incense in **sincere devotion to the Dao/Way’s Great Saints and True Virtues**.

After attaining the Dao/Way, one ascends to the **Formless**,
And harmonizes with the **True Dao/Way**.

We have heard:
*"The Jade Boy Attending the Immortals"*—
His divine origin first unfolded in the **embroidered brocade**;
*"The Great Saint of Longevity"*—
First rescued mortals from the **Eastern Quarter**.

Now, as the evening’s light fades and the Dao/Way practice begins,
We request the assembled ritualists to take this **second incense offering**,
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
To offer worship to the **Most High Pure Realm’s Sacred Treasure Sovereign** and the **Supreme Scriptural Treasures**.

We, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,
And dedicate these merits to the **ritual official’s two ancestral gates and seven generations of forefathers**.

May they swiftly ascend the **Golden Tablet’s path** to the **Jade Capital**,
Transcending the **Three Realms**, and be **commended by the Demon King**.

Ascend in name to the **Nine Palaces**,
And proceed to pay homage at the **Great Sovereign**.

Hasten to the **Dragon Gate** to receive the assembly,
And gain the **Bird Mother’s** guidance as a **Sacred Treasure Sovereign**,
No longer entangled in **grave disputes**,
Nor subject to the calamities of descendants.

Now, through this incense offering,
We **take refuge** in the **Supreme Teacher’s** **Great Saintly Assembly’s** **Most True Virtue/Power**.
Obtaining the Dao/Way thereafter,
We enter the **Formless Realm** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.

I have heard that the **Nine Refining Transformations** truly **revive the dead**,
And that **Ten Directions without limit** hold no greater merit than **saving beings**.

Through tonight’s **auspicious Dao/Way practice**,
We request the ritual assembly to present this **third incense offering**,
May this incense smoke ascend directly to the heavens,
And worship the **Supreme Pure Sacred Treasure Sovereign of the Celestial Realm** and the **Ten-Directional Teacher Treasures**.

We, the servants, **take refuge in body, spirit, and life**,
And dedicate these merits to the **five surnames of the departed**,
Male and female lonely spirits, and the **four types of sentient beings**.
Withered corpses and decayed bones,
Yet to leave the **land of darkness and stagnation**;
Wearing horns and bearing fur,
Not spared from the **whips and lashes of suffering**.

In the **dim underworld**, where **demons and spirits** lurk,
Squirming and writhing like **serpents and maggots**,
They lose their **vital essence** and remain utterly confused,
Clinging to **blood and qi** yet lacking awareness.
Some starve in **hunger and thirst**,
Falling into **ravines and ditches**;
Others perish in **warfare and conflict**,
Their bodies **rotting in grass and marshes**.

Cliffs and valleys, drowning in water or burning in flames,
Imprisoned in **jails and cages**,
Or dying by the **roadside**—
All suffer **harsh wrongs**,
Yet none encounter the **merit of commendation and guidance**,
Wandering the **Three Paths**, cycling through the **Six Realms of Rebirth**.

Humbly, we pray to **ride upon the Dao’s power**,
And **rely entirely on the True Compassion**.
To **abandon past ignorance** and avoid **falling into error**,
And to **meet tonight’s guidance**,
That all may swiftly **transcend and ascend**.

Freeing ourselves from **demonic spirits’** clutches,
Shedding our **traces in dust and sand**,
We all return to birth as **human beings**,
And hear the **lawful sounds** of the **Dharma**.

Now, through this incense offering,
We **take refuge** in the **Supreme Teacher’s** **Great Saintly Assembly’s** **Most True Virtue/Power**.
Obtaining the Dao/Way thereafter,
We enter the **Formless Realm** and harmonize with the **True Dao/Way**.

**Repentance of the Ten Directions**,
Three invocations, three obeisances.
The humble servants, **[names omitted]**, sincerely and earnestly present this plea:

To the **Natural Void Supreme Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Sovereign**,
The **Eastern Palace Master, the Great Sovereign of the Celestial Way**,
The **Sutra-Transmitting and Teaching Sovereigns of Past Ages**,
The **Eastern Peak, Grand Imperial Sovereign of the Jade Equilibrium**,
The **Virtuous and Benevolent Empress**,
The **Crown Prince and Noble Consort**,
The **Illuminating Spirit Official of the Hall**,
The **Spirit King of the Western Equilibrium**,
And all **clerks and officials** beneath the **Eastern Peak**,
The **Three Realms’** responsive beings,
And all **True Immortals**.

May they **hear our earnest prayers** and **reveal their compassion**.
I have heard that even those **who govern the year**,
Granting **ascension to the mountain** to **subdue demons**,
And those **who enjoy abundant food and salary**,
Yet still **record the dead’s names** as **officials of life**—
For the **thirty-six Formless Void Sovereigns**,
The **True Spirits** must surely gather;
And how much more so for the **seventy-two Sovereigns of the Seal Offerings**,
Whose rites are **especially esteemed**!

They **oversee the underworld**,
And **specialize in managing calamities and blessings**.
Though their names are **registered in the living ledgers**,
They must first **judge the departed spirits**.
Examining deeds and calculating merits,
There is **distinction between righteousness and wrongdoing**;
Ascending names or **falling into the tablets**,
How could there be no **differences in fate’s speed**?

If not for **purifying the mind** to **cleanse the heart**,
How could **expiation of sins** and **repairing past faults** be possible?

The **ritual official’s household**,
Now **awakening grief and sorrow**,
**Shedding tears** and **aching in the heart**,
With **painted images** yet **unseen**,
No **gentle admonition** heard;
Though **offerings are made**,
The **emotion is still deeply sorrowful**.

Joy is **suddenly cut off** at the **gates of the home**,
And **arrest and return** are **only now** sent to the **Eastern Peak’s office**.

Without **rites**, none can be **guided**—
May we **fulfill the merit of guidance**;
Without **rites**, none can **ascend**—
May we **earn the fruit of rebirth**.

To request **entrustment** from **the departed**,
It is **difficult to match past examples**;
To **seek guidance** in **youthful years**,
How could we **again** be **fellow students**?

Only in reciting the **wondrous methods of the Incense Forest**,
And passing on the **Void Songs of the Verdant Abyss**,
Shall we **establish a Pure Altar**,
With **lamps blazing** to **dispel darkness**;
And **devote ourselves to the Sacred Treasure Sovereign**,
With **fragrant incense** ascending to the heavens.

May our **sincere sincerity** be **fully exhausted**,
And our prayers **directly reach the lofty peaks**.

Humbly, we pray that the **frost and ice of the night office may melt**,
And that **rain and dew** may **pour upon the dark gates**.

Through **five refining transformations**,
May they be **molded anew** in **rebirth**;
With **all sins cleansed and released**,
May they **once more** behold **the light of clarity**.

The departed, if they **have awareness**,
Shall **harmonize with sudden enlightenment**;
The living, filled with **gratitude**,
Shall **ever more deeply take refuge**.

Extending **universal compassion**,
All shall **be saved and guided**.

Above, we **fulfill** the **Supreme Sovereign’s** **Great Compassion**,
Below, we **align** with our servants’ **sincere refuge in life**,
And humbly submit this plea.

**Twelve Vows** completed.
**Return to the altar**.

The humble **incense officials and messengers**,
The **Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Sovereigns**,
And all **attendant spirit officials**,
Shall now **command** that in the **servant’s** past **quiet nights of Dao/Way practice**,
**Golden Elixir and Azure Jade** shall naturally **generate**,
Along with **mushrooms, herbs, and myriad spirits**,
And the **gathering of all True Ones**,
At this **incense fire altar**.

May the **Ten-Directional Immortal Children and Jade Maidens**,
**Attend and escort the fragrant incense**,
And **transmit** the **servant’s** past **sincere pleas**,
Swiftly **reaching** the **Supreme, Limitless Great Dao/Way**,
Before the **Heavenly Jade Emperor**.

**Praise outside the hall**.
**Praise outside the door**.

**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume 83 Complete**
**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Dao Gate, Volume 84**
*Compiled by Master Guangting Du, with revisions by the Eastern Peak [Mount Tai] Master of Rescue and Salvation*
**Great Ritual of the Eastern Peak [Mount Tai] – Scattered Altar Dao Practice**

**Ritual Ascension to the Altar as Usual**
Each pays respect to the Master in accordance with the law.
**Proclaim the Spirit-Guarding Incantations.**

The Five Stars shine forth, illuminating the Five Directions.
Mercury repels calamity, Wood virtue brings prosperity.
Mars dissipates misfortune, Jupiter wards off war.
The Star of Stability holds firm—blessing the family and state with harmony.
Names inscribed upon the Jade Tablets, words recorded in the Imperial Archives.
Riding the gale, scattering brilliance, soaring through the boundless void,
Entering and exiting the unseen, feasting across the Ten Directions.
Five clouds float as canopies, summoning spirits and harnessing winds.
Commanding ten thousand spirits, guarding above with Dao harmony—
**Striking the Dao Drum twenty-four times.**

**Ignite the Altar.**

The Most High Three Celestial Primordials—**Heavenly Primordial Beginning of the Three Qi,**
**Supreme Dao Lord, Supreme Laozi**—
Summon forth from within the servant’s body:
The **Three Five Officials of Merit,**
Left and Right Official Messengers,
Left and Right Incense-Bearers,
Postal Dragon Cavalry Officers,
Attendant Golden Boys,
Incense-Transmitting Jade Maidens,
The Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols,
Direct-Sun Incense Officials—
A total of **thirty-six** emerging.

Those who emerge are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,
With headgear and trailing ribbons,
Opening the **Mysterious Altar’s Land and Domain Spirits.**

The servant, now in quiet night Dao practice,
Humbly presents this proclamation of intent.
All sincere pleas have been recorded and reported—
May the **Supreme Dao Qi of the Ten Directions** descend,
The **Sacred Treasure Radiance** flow into the servant’s body,
So that what is presented may swiftly reach
The **Supreme Limitless Great Dao,**
Before the **Heavenly Golden Threshold Jade Emperor of the Highest Void.**

**Request the proclamation of rank.**
The servant of such-and-such rank, with utmost sincerity,
Humbly presents to:
The **Void-Natural Golden Threshold Seven-Treasured Supreme Emperor,**
The **Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**
The **Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**
The **Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**
The **Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**
The **Crown Prince and Noble Consort,**
The **Illuminous Spirit Duke of the Hall,**
The **Western Qi Spirit King,**
The **File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**
All **clerks and officials,**
The **Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**
All **True Spirits.**

The servant hears:
At the **Great Peak, the sacrificial rites were first established,**
And the hunt was revered by the **Yu Emperor;**
At the **sacrificial field, the mandate was sought,**
And the **Rites of Ru were held in utmost respect.**

**Translation:**

---
**Responding to the Wood Virtue’s reign and upholding benevolence,**
Well able to lead as the first of spring’s seasons,
Where life’s origin begins.
**Indeed, the Mountain Emperor’s benevolence**
Stems from his love of life and hatred of slaughter as his purpose;
**He governs the celestial populace’s register,**
And records births and deaths as his merit.
**All these myriad beings, vast and orderly,**
Are all nurtured by the transformative *qi* of life.
**How could he bear to oppress those crying out in slaughter’s fields,**
Or wish to confine them in the dark prisons of the netherworld?
Yet because of the multitude’s ignorance and folly,
Their crimes are self-inflicted;
**Each follows base desires of love and hatred,**
And their greed knows no end.
**Indulging in licentiousness and deceit in myriad forms,**
**Giving free rein to cunning and guile in countless guises,**
If their crimes are not rectified, they must face judgment;
If the law is applied, they cannot escape punishment.
**Still, they hope for mercy’s tears to absolve their guilt,**
And pray for the prison’s records to be reconsidered.
**If they can reform, why not cease like the tillers of the field?**
**If they die in wrong, they will wail as ghosts in the thorny groves.**
**Thus, they seek pity and plead for life,**
Wishing to amend their faults and atone for their errors,
**Following the Dao’s Way as a bridge to law,**
**Conforming to the Dao’s teachings as a lamp of wisdom,**
**Seeking the Dao’s shelter as a protective cloud,**
**Relying on the Dao’s compassion as saving rain,**
**Hoping to bathe in the dew of mercy,**
**And swiftly rescue souls from the dark night.**
**With utmost reverence and sincerity, day after day,**
**Focusing on the Pure Clarity’s realm,**
**Praying for the descent of the Feathered Canopy’s grace;**
**Reciting the *Step-on-the-Void* hymns,**
**Aspiring to the paired clouds’ arrival.**
**Temporarily departing the Golden Gate,**
**First, the Nine Phoenixes harmonize in song;**
**Descending to the mortal feast,**
**Then, the Eight Cranes dance in flight.**
**The Holy Will communicates in an instant,**
**The True Ones come and go in a flash,**
**Surely granting human desires as Heaven approves,**
**Responding to the lower’s petitions and transmitting them above.**
**The servants, with utmost devotion,**
**Humbly welcome the Sacred Procession.**
**Descend, O Holy One!**
**First Offering, Scatter Flowers.**

**The servants, with utmost devotion,**
**Humbly address:**
**The Formless, Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Emperor of Heaven,**
**The Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**
**The Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**
**The Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**
**The Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**
**The File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**
**All clerks and officials,**
**The Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**
**All True Spirits.**

**The servants hear:**
**The Five Peaks are established across the world,**
**Yet only Mount Tai stands as the foremost.**
**A hundred spirits converge at the Mountain’s Hall,**
**For it governs the fate of the people.**
**Not only does it reveal omens through divination,**
**But also manifests auspices through signs.**
**The Sample Stone stood upright,**
**And the grandson truly succeeded the Tang Dynasty;**
**The violent wind scattered it,**
**And the First Ancestor of Qin was ultimately overthrown by the Qin.**
**For kings, it foretells success or failure,**
**Yet for the common folk, it determines life and death.**
**Thus, in memory of the departed,**
**We do not exceed the common practice.**
**When moved by emotion, some act out of greed, jealousy, or delusion in anger;**
**When following desires, others indulge in depravity and extravagance.**
**The Three Karmas wield the axe of self-destruction,**
**And myriad sins brew the poison of ruin.**
**In their past lives, they fell into nets, traps, and pits without knowing;**
**Now in the underworld, they suffer chains, shackles, and torture.**
**Though their names and crimes are recorded,**
**And though they face punishment,**
**Yet the boundless virtue still hopes for pardon.**
**The Dao originates from benevolent forgiveness,**
**And the humble heart dares to seek renewal.**
**Thus, we rely on the Yellow Hat,**
**And solemnly present the Pure Rites.**
**Baring our hearts and pouring forth our sincerity,**
**We lay bare our words of repentance;**
**Stretching our necks and focusing our minds,**
**We earnestly hope for their arrival.**
**At the Jade Seal’s Enfeoffment Ground,**
**We envision the Sacred Procession ascending in the Cloud Chariot;**
**At the Stone Gate’s Descending Meditation Site,**
**We await the Void’s slow arrival in the Celestial Procession.**
**With reverence and devotion, we merge our spirits,**
**And hope for their arrival and blessings, abundant and vast.**
**Not offering humble baskets of bronze and pottery,**
**But presenting pure offerings of lotus and orchids.**
**The rites proceed with the First Offering,**
**And sincerity is fully expressed in its purity.**
**Though we are unworthy of the Holy Virtue’s fragrance,**
**We still present our heartfelt prayers.**
**May you perceive our sorrow today,**
**And swiftly free us from the suffering of the underworld’s gate.**
**The Pure Rites’ words are sincere,**
**And we solemnly declare them.**
**Declare the Words.**
**Carefully examining the language,**
**Clearly seeing the depths of our grief.**
**Why must we journey to Qufu’s capital**
**Before we turn toward you?**
**Why must we ascend to the Great Treasury’s hall**
**Before we fully rely on you?**
**Remembering the departed souls have a home,**
**It is the Mountain’s Spirit who governs them all.**
**Nourish their withered flesh and bones,**
**And grant them the tenfold merit of rebirth;**
**Endow them with life’s origin,**
**And open for them the mysteries of the Nine Heavens.**
**Provide them with the calculations of the Eastern Dipper,**
**And let them receive refinement in the Southern Palace.**
**Lamenting the dead and mourning the departed,**
**Though it is said that humans return to the earth;**
**Yet seeking rebirth and transformation,**
**We pray that Heaven grants them form once more.**
**The servants, with utmost sincerity,**
**Bow twice, heads touching the ground,**
**And humbly present the Second Offering.**
**Scatter Flowers.**

**The servants, with utmost devotion,**
**Together address:**
**The Formless, Natural Golden Gate Seven-Treasured Emperor of Heaven,**
**The Eastern Palace Patriarch, Great Unity Savior of Suffering, Heavenly Lord,**
**The Transmitting Scriptures and Teaching Ancestral True Ones of Past Ages,**
**The Eastern Peak Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal and Benevolent Holy Emperor,**
**The Virtuous and Illuminating Empress,**
**The File and Martial Officials beneath the Peak,**
**All clerks and officials,**
**The Three Realms’ responsive spirits,**
**All True Spirits.**

**The servants hear:**
**Heaven does not cut short the lives of the people,**
**For their original fate stems from self-destruction;**
**If humans fall into crime,**
**Even the Sage on High does not hesitate to enforce punishment.**
**If evil is not punished,**
**Then virtuous deeds remain unseen.**
**Since the path is blocked by the Three Pure Ones’ distance,**
**They must sink into the Nine Underworlds’ depths.**
**Once fallen into darkness, some endure countless kalpas.**
**The South’s prison is called Fire Obscurity,**
**And those who fall there suffer burning brows and heads;**
**The West’s prison is Iron, the Diamond Fort,**
**And those who enter are crushed with hammers and pierced with spears.**
**The Cold of the Northern Abyss is extreme,**
**Where they suffer the hundred poisons’ frost;**
**The Central Prison of Universal Sweeping**
**Is where they fall from the Eight Reaching Trees.**
**The tortures of the Copper Pillars and the slaughtering fields,**
**The agonies of the Iron Chariots and boiling cauldrons,**
**All stem from their past indulgence in desires,**
**And thus they now endure these sufferings.**
**Moreover, this Eastern prison**
**Is also called the Wind-Thunder Realm;**

**Moreover, the spirit of the Lord Guan must surely exert its divine authority.**
**Fortunate is the radiant light of the Celestial Sage, pervasive and illuminating,**
**That it does not allow all to be utterly lost in darkness;**
**Though the Yin Officials enforce strict punishments,**
**Surely there are also opportunities for leniency.**

**With utmost sincerity and devotion, we earnestly pray**
**To receive the saving grace and blessings of deliverance.**

**The fragrant incense has already ascended to the Three Heavens,**
**And the sweet wine is now offered in the second presentation,**
**Mimicking the arrival of the sacred banners,**
**And faintly resembling the imperial procession’s presence.**

**We humbly wish to feel the divine response through mutual resonance (交孚),**
**And that our lamentations may not fall upon deaf ears (无告).**

**Under the radiant gaze of the Vaulted Sky (穹窿),**
**May we soon emerge from the realms of darkness and light (幽明);**
**Near the Hidden Mystic Gate of the Celestial Realm (奥天门),**
**May we immediately depart from suffering and distress (苦恼).**

**May we be permitted to repent our wrongs and turn to goodness,**
**So that we may attain the Dao and ascend to True Reality (登真).**

**Your humble servants, with reverent devotion, prostrate ourselves twice,**
**And respectfully present our final offering.**
**Scatter flowers.**

**Your servants of the lowest ranks, [names redacted],**
**With profound sincerity and earnestness, humbly address the following:**

**To the Peerless Golden Palace Supreme Deity of the Natural Void (虚无自然金阙七宝上帝),**
**To the Eastern Palace Great Unity Saving Suffering Celestial Sage (太乙救苦天尊),**
**To the lineage of scripture-transmitting and doctrine-performing sages across generations (历代师真),**
**To the Heavenly Lord of Equality and Virtue, the Eastern Peak Tai Mountain (东岳泰山天齐仁圣帝),**
**To the Virtuous and Illustrious Empress,**
**To the Crown Prince and the Noble Consort,**
**To the Radiant Spirit Marquis of the Hall,**
**To the Mystic King of Western Qi,**
**To the Heavenly Marshal and the Celestial Officials of the Five Directions,**
**To all the bureaucratic spirits (一切曹僚),**
**To the Three Realms that respond to our devotion,**
**And to all True Spirits (一切真灵).**

**We have heard that since the Dragon Han era produced scriptures,**
**The path of the Dao has finally been broadly revealed.**
**From the beginning of the Red Brightness Kalpa (赤明开劫),**
**The sole purpose has been to guide beings toward liberation.**

**Divine spirits universally flourish,**
**And the Dao transforms mortals into immortals.**
**The Holy Mother guards the room while the Marshal oversees the court,**
**The Record-Keeper registers the deeds while the Life Official determines their fates.**
**Would they desire to torment the people and cause their suffering?**
**Rather, they wish to multiply the myriad beings and grant them life.**

**Yet, humans may sometimes incur the offense of defying Heaven,**
**And thus, the Yin Prisons inevitably fall upon them.**

**When grievances accumulate and the spirits of darkness exact retribution,**
**Those who sow unvirtuous causes reap great suffering in return.**

**Thanks to the Original Beginning’s sacred decree (符命),**
**We may hope for timely elevation and advancement.**
**Also, through the Black King’s esoteric chapters (洞章),**
**We may be recorded for our meritorious efforts and recommended.**

**Thus, the departed souls may undergo refinement,**
**And obtain vital *qi* to solidify their essence.**

**In the Northern Capital of Luo and Tang,**
**To be freed from calamity is to depart from the Spirit Bureau (泉府).**
**In the Southern Capital’s palace and gates,**
**The living souls’ fate further depends upon Your divine benevolence.**

**With the sacred talismans in hand and the registers held,**
**We present ourselves before the Heavenly Lord.**
**Having received the decree and been granted form,**
**We circulate through the cosmos,**
**All owing to the boundless compassion of the Original Primordial (元梵),**
**And each attaining the lower cultivation at the Mud Mound (泥丸).**

**This ritual master, [name redacted], deeply mourns the departed souls,**
**Who have yet to ascend to the realm of the living.**
**In the land of Lu where they were once honored,**
**They still linger in the Spirit Bureau.**
**Reflecting on the withered songs of Confucius,**
**They have long departed from the mortal world.**

**Moreover, their misfortunes remain unwashed,**
**And they are truly overwhelmed by the Black Poison’s torments.**

**Thus, we beseech the Daoist Realm of Immortal Wandering (仙游),**
**And fully confess our repentance.**
**We also purify the sacred space and solemnly arrange the offerings,**
**Carrying incense and devotion to pledge our hearts,**
**And bow before the True Spirits to atone for our sins.**

**Now, with the three presentations of wine complete,**
**And at the fifth watch of the night,**
**We strive ever harder to be reverent and devout,**
**Hoping thereby to receive Your gracious favor.**

**We humbly wish to cleanse our transgressions and crimes,**
**And that Your divine insight may accept our sincerity.**
**May You deign to acknowledge the merit of the Three Treasures (三宝),**
**And erase our names from the Black Register (黑簿).**
**May we soon receive the command of the Nine Dragons (九龙),**
**And be inscribed in the Green Palace of blessings (青宫).**

**Riding the morning light and ascending toward the luminous (阳翘),**
**We open the Great Existence and pass through the Mystic Gate (玄户).**
**Having received our form and undergone refinement,**
**We attain the Hall of Flowing Fire (流火之庭).**
**Following our wishes to be reborn,**
**We ascend to the Realm of Equality and Longevity (仁寿之域).**

**Your servant and this ritual master, [names redacted],**
**Cannot adequately express our deepest reverence and prayers.**

**Twelve Vows.**
**Return to the Furnace.**

**Respectfully summoning the incense officials and messengers,**
**The Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords (龙虎君),**
**And the attendant spirits of the incense (侍香诸灵官),**
**To command them to guide Your servant to the place of past nightly Daoist practice,**
**Where naturally arise golden nectar and emerald elixir,**
**Mushrooms, herbs, and myriad sacred essences,**
**And where all True Ones gather—**
**Right here before this incense furnace.**

**May the Ten Directions’ immortal youths and celestial maidens**
**Attend to the fragrant vapors,**
**And swiftly convey the sincerity of our past petitions**
**Directly to the Primordial Supreme Dao of the Jade Sovereign (无极大道) and the Heavenly Lord (昊天玉皇上帝).**

**Exit the Hall, recite the praises.**
**Exit the Door.**
**Escort the Sacred.**
**Turn back the merit.**

**The Complete Collection of Daoist Rituals and Precepts, Volume 85 begins.**

**The Ritual Compendium of the Daoist Gate, Volume 85 (East Peak Salvation Ritual for Three Times of Repentance)**

**Dawn of Pure Clarity**
The humble servants, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and entrust themselves to the **Ten Directions’ Primordial Supreme Daoist Lord of the Soul’s Treasure (无极太上灵宝天尊)**, the **Five Sacred Peaks’ Imperial Saints (五岳圣帝)**, the **Four Great Waters’ Source Kings (四渎源王)**, the **Three Realms and Ten Directions (三界十方)**, all **Divine Beings and Immortals (神仙)**, and the **Assemblies of Spirits (诸灵官)**, devoutly repenting our transgressions.

We humbly hear that the **Divine Officials’ Celestial Abodes (仙官洞府)**
can dissolve calamity and dispel disaster;
that the **East Peak Water Sovereign (东岳水司)**
holds life over death by the **Heavenly Lord’s decree (皇主生而制死)**.

All under heaven revere and gaze upon them,
for they govern the fate of mortal lives.
A single thought of devotion and reliance
shall surely earn the **Heavenly Lord’s compassionate regard (帝心之回眷)**.

We pray for Your gracious pity,
to look down upon our mortal plight,
and grant us repentance for our sins,
cleansing our stains and purging our defilements.
May we be absolved of our offenses.

Today’s ritual master, **so-and-so**, deeply regrets the transgressions of the departed, **so-and-so**.
From birth, humans are bound by the **Four Great Elements (四大)**,
and our senses are formed by the **Six Roots (六根)**.
From the roots arises dust,
and dust accumulates into defilements,
which grow worse and cannot be concealed,
leading to grave sins that are hard to escape.

To rescue the **Nine Nights’ soul (九夜之魂)**,
we must repent the **Six Roots’ sins (六根之罪)**.

For we see the cause of suffering—
the **illusion of form (色)**—yet fail to recognize its emptiness (**空**),
and thus let external things disturb us.
*"Do not gaze upon what is improper"*—
yet we still bear guilt before **Yan Yuan (颜渊)**;
*"Blind yet seeing"*—
we are deeply shamed before **Zhuangzi’s teachings (庄叟)**.

Delighted by the allure of beauty,
we indulge in the sight of **splendor and finery (青黄黼黻)**.
Even more, when gold blinds us to true humanity,
how can we scrutinize the **footprints of virtue (视履)**?

Such sins stem from the **eye-root (眼根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

Again, if we take pleasure in **lewd speech (亵语)** and incline our ears,
or revel in **heretical teachings (邪说)** and find joy in hearing,
when we encounter the **whispering voices of clouds and dust (遏云绕尘之声)**,
we cannot help but be ensnared;
when we hear the **urgent strings and hasty drums (急弦促柱之响)**,
we cannot resist lingering.

Believing in **erroneous doctrines and wild schemes (谬论狂谋)**,
we crave **licentious words and filthy speech (淫言秽语)**,
yet fail to heed *"Do not listen to what is improper"*—
how can we claim to uphold **virtue and wisdom (尚德而为聪)**?

Such sins stem from the **ear-root (耳根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

Again, if we are intoxicated by **the hundred scents (五臭所熏, 百物交感)**,
like guests who steal fragrance in the dark,
or husbands who abandon all for the **coastal allure (海畔之夫)**,
chasing only the **pleasing odors (逐臭)**,
we demand **rich flavors (厚味)** and compete for the **savor of meat and wine (饮膳之膻香)**;
we covet **fine garments and rare fabrics (美衣奇, 绮罗)**,
and delight in the **scent of orchids and musk (兰麝)**.

Yet we do not know that **the nose’s penetration leads to trembling (鼻彻为颤)**,
and only bring weariness to our brow.
Such sins stem from the **nose-root (鼻根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

Again, if we indulge in **the five tastes (五味)** and cling to **the eight delicacies (八珍)**,
we scorn **Yan Hui’s simple fare (颜回之箪瓢)**,
and prefer **Yi Ya’s elaborate cuisine (易牙之刍豢)**,
seeking only to satisfy our **mouth’s desires (口腹之足欲)**,
yet unaware that **the cauldron’s heat breeds resentment (鼎镬之生冤)**.

Moreover, **sweet-tongued treachery (利口覆邦)** and **crafty words that disrupt virtue (巧言乱德)**—
these wound like **spears and javelins (矛戟)**,
and we lack **the modesty of the Duke of Zhou (雅之莫扪)**;
we **dishonor the sacred pivot (枢机)**,
and follow **Zhang Yi’s deceit (张仪之尚在)**.

Thus, **words bring calamity (召祸)**,
yet we fail to see that **taste is also emptiness (味即是空)**.
Such sins stem from the **tongue-root (舌根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

Again, if we seek **the body’s ease (安佚)** and neglect others’ toil,
or push our **four limbs to their limits (优游)** in self-indulgence,
we **boast of our lofty halls and vast mansions (高堂广厦)**,
and **lust after fine food and silks (美食鲜衣)**,
making ourselves proud while harming others,
and failing to **relieve the suffering of the world (博济)**.
When told *"Do not harm others for your own gain (害人而利己)"*,
we **glance with scheming eyes (睢盱)**;
when we **destroy others to fulfill our own desires (坏人以自成)**,
we do not consider **bestowing kindness (施恩)**.

Such sins stem from the **body-root (身根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

Again, if the **heart’s nature (心妄性本)** is unrestrained,
and **intentions wander into the field of emotions (意入情田)**,
we are **disturbed by greed, jealousy, and rivalry (贪嫉妬)**,
and **driven by joy, anger, sorrow, and delight (喜怒哀乐)**,
yet we do not **follow Confucius’ Four Absolutes (四绝)**,
and only **err in Xun Kuang’s Five Constraints (五綦)**.

We cannot **subdue the Heavenly Lord (天君)**,
for the **mind-monkey (心猿)** keeps escaping;
we cannot **restrain the breath-horse (气马)**,
for its **wild spirit (志帅)** cannot be tamed.
We **abandon what is right for what is wrong (舍是为非)**,
and **follow what is crooked (径行)**,
nurturing our nature without **reducing desire (寡欲)**.

Such sins stem from the **mind-root (意根)**.
Today, at this time, we vow to repent.

As above, we repent the **sins of the Six Roots (六根之罪)**.
We humbly pray that the **Noble Worthies (高真)** may forgive our offenses,
that the **Assemblies of Saints (众圣)** may shower mercy upon us,
and grant us **awakening after others’ awakening (觉后而觉先)**,
as well as **rebirth and death in accordance with the Dao (更生而更死)**.
May our **black ledgers of karmic debts (黑簿)** be dissolved by accumulated merit,
and our **red sins of departed souls (朱陵)** be transcended through this ritual.
May Your blessings extend to future generations,
and may we forever dwell under the **Dao’s shade (道荫)**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way (道)**,
we ascend to the **formless (无形)**,
harmonizing with the **True Dao (道合真)**.

**Midday Repentance for the Ten Directions**
The humble servants, with utmost sincerity, prostrate and entrust themselves to the **East Peak Jade Treasure Supreme Heavenly Lord (东方玉宝皇上天尊)**, the **Nine Breaths’ Heavenly Sovereign (九炁天君)**, all **Divine Beings and Immortals (神仙)**, and the **Assemblies of Spirits (诸灵官)**, devoutly repenting and offering thanks.

We humbly hear that **wood binds us in the world (束为木)**,
and **virtue governs by benevolence (德主仁)**.
When humans **lose the heart of benevolence (昧仁心)**,
they **depart from virtuous conduct (乖仁德)**.
If we cannot **repent and purify (忏洗)**,
how much longer shall we **accumulate guilt (愆尤)**?

The ritual master, **so-and-so**, offers this repentance on behalf of the departed, **so-and-so**.
From countless past lives to this present one,
we have **forgotten compassion (恻隐之心)**,
and **lacked the resolve of kindness (宽慈之志)**.

At home, we **failed to love our parents (爱亲之念)**,
and **our filial piety was utterly neglected (孝养全亏)**;
in office, we **did not sincerely care for our lord (忧主之诚)**,
and **our loyalty and diligence were lost (忠勤顿阙)**.
We **ignored the widow, the orphan, and the lonely (鳏寡孤独)**,
and **did not relieve the suffering of the sick and poor (疾苦困穷)**.
We **pushed away those in need (推内沟)**,
and **deeply regret not offering aid (不被泽)**,
like **Yi Sheng’s sorrow (伊生)**;
we **laughed at those in peril (有刀)**,
yet **killed them secretly (潜杀人)**,
like **Yi Fu’s hypocrisy (义甫)**.

We **abandoned our kin (宗族)**,
causing **one-sided resentment (相怨於一方)**;
we **neglected our brothers (弟兄)**,
yet **preferred to dwell together in shared deceit (同居而共被)**.
We **refused to guide those seeking the Dao (问津莫答)**,
and **only schemed to harm (挤壑是图)**.
Since we **failed to practice the Six Virtues (六行)**,
we **cannot escape the fate of a single wrongdoer (一夫之不获)**.

Such crimes **harm benevolence and compassion (宽仁)**.
We deeply fear that the departed, **so-and-so**, after death,
may fall into the **prison of East Peak’s winds and thunders (东方风雷之狱)**,
or be **judged under the East Peak Sacred Emperor’s authority (东岳圣帝考官之司)**,
suffering in **dark dungeons (幽关)**,
with no way to **escape their torments (解脱)**.

Today, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Eastern World’s Jade Treasure Sovereign of Heaven, the Nine-Qi Heavenly Lord**.

I humbly pray that **You command** from **Mount Tai**,
and **grant me salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,
**washing away all unvirtuous crimes**,
and **receiving the blessings of the Dao’s virtue**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
I shall **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Southern World’s Mysterious True Ten-Thousand Blessings Heavenly Lord, the Three-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Southern Fire Bureau**,
**virtue is expressed as propriety**.

If **humans offend the Fire Virtue**,
they **fail to understand the precepts of propriety**.
With **accumulated transgressions and sins**,
they **must seek purification and absolution**.

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crimes of improper conduct**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **lacked the mind of modesty and humility**,
and **did not cultivate the spirit of diligence and reverence**.

My **conduct violated the precepts of humility**,
my **actions failed to uphold harmony**,
I **demeaned the exalted while in lowly stations**,
and **offended superiors while in weakness**.
I **neglected the humble seat at feasts**,
and **pursued precedence on the path of the Dao**.
I **oppressed my neighbors with arrogance**,
and **scorned my elders and betters**.

I **sat insolently and sprawled**,
yet **aspired to equal the Sage**;
I **walked naked and exposed**,
yet **never lagged behind the wise**.

How could I know that **Master Yan** (颜子) **grieved over the faults of sight and hearing**,
and **remembered the virtues of the ancient kings**—
their **behavior, their words, their demeanor**?
I **fell into pride and sloth**, which **mutually reinforced**,
and **arrogance and haughtiness**, which **grew together**.
Thus, **my licentiousness was complete**,
and **all propriety lost**.

Now I deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,
they may **succumb to the Southern Fire’s dark prison**,
or **be judged under the Southern Sacred Emperor’s authority**,
**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,
with **no path to liberation**.

Today, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Southern World’s Mysterious True Ten-Thousand Blessings Heavenly Lord, the Three-Qi Heavenly Lord**.

I humbly pray that **You command** from the **Southern World**,
and **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,
**washing away all crimes of improper conduct**,
and **elevating them to the realm of joy**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
they shall **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Western World’s Supreme Marvelous Ultimate Heavenly Lord, the Seven-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Western Metal Bureau**,
**virtue is expressed as righteousness**.

If **humans offend the Metal Virtue**,
they **fail to grasp the way of righteousness**.
With **accumulated transgressions and sins**,
they **must seek purification and absolution**.

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crimes of unrighteousness**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **lacked the mind of shame and revulsion**,
and **willingly endured the insults of others**.
I **indulged in favors and flattery**,
and **even betrayed my lord**.
I **pledged loyalty with severed necks**,
yet **still sought to sell my friends**.

My **actions were driven by petty disputes**,
and **self-interest prevailed over harmony**.
I **did not ponder Master Meng’s response to the Duke of Liang**,
but **only mimicked Song Jiao’s flattery of Chu**.
If **I could not resist desire**,
then **my nature aligned with Xia You and Ge Ren** (夏癸, 商辛);
if **I was deemed cruel**,
then **my wickedness matched Shang Xin and Jiang Zhi** (商辛, 江志).

I **could not cease from trespassing and harming others**,
yet **failed to recognize that gradual cultivation leads to the right path**.
I **took what was not mine**, nearing **theft**;
how much more so when **I seized gold in the marketplace**?
I **executed the innocent**, exceeding **just severity**;
yet **I manipulated laws to frame prisoners**.

Such **crimes are beyond redemption**,
and **no path can absolve them**.

I deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,
they may **fall into the Western Metal’s prison of retribution**,
or **be judged under the Western Sacred Emperor’s authority**,
**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,
with **no way to escape**.

Today, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Western World’s Supreme Marvelous Ultimate Heavenly Lord, the Seven-Qi Heavenly Lord**.

I humbly pray that **You command** from the **Western World**,
and **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,
**washing away all crimes of unrighteousness**,
and **receiving the blessings of the Dao’s ultimate function**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
they shall **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Northern World’s Mysterious Supreme Jade Chariot Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Northern Water Bureau** (居坎),
**virtue is expressed as wisdom**.

If **humans offend the Water Virtue**,
they **lack the mind of wisdom**.
With **accumulated transgressions and sins**,
they **must seek purification and absolution**.

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crimes of folly**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **did not discern the rites of right and wrong**,
but **only harbored ignorance and stupidity**.

I **knew not myself nor others**,
yet **claimed to uphold rectitude**—
how could I **straighten others while bent myself**?
My **eyelashes obscured my vision**,
and **my heart grew darker with seclusion**.
I **fixed my gaze on the four cardinal points**,
yet **my mind was in chaos**;
the **Heavenly Lord must know of my two errors**,
for **I was lost in deeper darkness**.

I **trampled propriety and violated righteousness**,
yet **did not recognize reverence and love for elders and betters**.
I **abandoned trust and betrayed loyalty**,
yet **failed to understand harmony with friends**.

**Light could not return** when **reflected back**,
and **deceit now merged with my present folly**.
The **Dao/Way is easy to know yet hard to practice**,
but **I sought to defy it**.
**People may know late and awaken late**,
yet **I still fall short of the common folk’s shame**.

I **toiled in vain, seeking only punishment**,
and **did not realize truth nor know restraint**.
**Crimes are hard to avoid**,
and **wisdom is fully obscured**.

I deeply fear that after **the departed, so-and-so’s** death,
they may **succumb to the Northern Boundless Cold’s prison**,
or **be judged under the Northern Sacred Emperor’s authority**,
**wandering through shadowed dungeons**,
with **no path to liberation**.

Today, with sincere devotion, I **repent and submit** to the **Northern World’s Mysterious Supreme Jade Chariot Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.

I humbly pray that **You command** from the **Northern World**,
and **grant salvation** to **the departed, so-and-so**,
**washing away all crimes of folly**,
and **elevating them to the realm of joy in this very life**.

After attaining the **Dao/Way**,
they shall **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with sincere devotion, **repent and submit** to the **Northeast World’s Immortal-Saving Supreme Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Northern Water Bureau**,
**the virtue of benefiting others is supreme**.
If **humans fail to benefit others**,
they **hoard greedily and covet resources**.
With **accumulated transgressions and sins**,
they **must seek purification and absolution**.

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crimes of greed**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **could not sacrifice myself to benefit others**,
but **only sought to harm others for my own gain**.

But only knowing **worry over insufficiency**,
how could one know **one’s share requires no excess**?
Counting **fields by the thousand** to become a **landlord**,
hoarding **millions in coins** to become a **money-tyrant**.

Not knowing **life’s swift passage**—like a **fleeting moment**—
one **plucks not even a hair** to avoid misfortune.
Some **cheat orphans and widows**, seizing their **household wealth** and refusing to return it;
if **trading as a merchant or peddler**, they **double prices** and take pride in it.
They **slander monks and defame Daoists**, utterly lacking **generosity in giving**;
seeing **starvation or cold**, they **never show pity or compassion**.

They **lend at double interest**, yet still **covet more**;
they **spend hundreds on guests**, already **showing displeasure**.
How much more those who **kill for gain**—
**never sharing wealth** with others.
Such **transgressions**, piled high, **bring calamity and ruin**.

In deepest fear, **the departed so-and-so**, after death,
will **fall into the Northeast’s Boiling Cauldron Prison**,
to be **tried by the Officials of Mount Tai’s Judgment Bureau**,
endlessly trapped in **dark dungeons**, with **no way to escape**.

Now, with **sincere devotion**, we **repent to the Northeast World’s Immortal-Saving Supreme Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.
We **humbly pray** that the **saints show mercy**,
that the **departed soul be guided**,
and that **all greed’s sins be cleansed**,
so they may **be reborn in the Heaven of Joy**.
After attaining the **Dao**, they will **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with **sincere devotion**, **repent to the Southeast’s Life-Nurturing Soul-Saving Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Eastern Wood Bureau**,
**the virtue of nurturing life is supreme**.
If **humans fail to nurture life**,
**slaughter becomes rampant**.
Without **purification**, how could **transgressions be absolved**?

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crime of slaughter**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **only craved the taste of fat meats**,
never **pausing to fear life’s fragility**.

I **drew bows and held arrows**, shooting **birds mid-flight in the clouds**;
I **cast nets and sank hooks**, dragging **scaled creatures from the depths**.
Before **feathers were plucked**, their **manes were already severed**;
while **winds were still being hunted**, their **wings were already broken**.
Dogs, pigs, oxen, and sheep—
all were **slaughtered to excess** with **blade and spear**;
chickens, ducks, geese, and wildfowl—
were **cooked at will** before my **table**.

Their **cries echoed before the knives**,
their **blood dripped upon the cooking pots**.
Though **flayed and butchered**, I **never considered their flesh as my own**;
though **boiled, roasted, or fried**, I **only thought of filling my mouth**.
I **tamed pheasants like Lu Gong’s**, with **no different intent**;
I **hunted deer like Xi Ba’s**, with **no divergent heart**.
Not that I **could not bear to see them die**—
but **many more perished** because of me.
Such **transgressions**, piled high, **must lead to ruin**.

In deepest fear, **the departed so-and-so**, after death,
will **fall into the Copper Pillar Prison**,
to be **tried by the Officials of Mount Tai’s Judgment Bureau**,
endlessly trapped in **dark dungeons**, with **no way to escape**.

Now, with **sincere devotion**, we **repent to the Southeast’s Life-Nurturing Soul-Saving Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.
We **humbly pray** that the **saints show mercy**,
that the **departed soul be guided**,
and that **all slaughter’s sins be cleansed**,
so they may **be reborn in the Heaven of Joy**.
After attaining the **Dao**, they will **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with **sincere devotion**, **repent to the Southwest’s Most Sacred Void Emperor, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Southern Fire Bureau**,
**the virtue of propriety is strict**.
If **humans fail in propriety**,
they **fall to depraved acts**.
Without **purification**, how could **transgressions be absolved**?

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crime of depravity**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **harbored lustful desires**,
and **lost my guard over chastity**.

I **schemed for trysts by the Han River**,
and **planned meetings in the mulberry groves**,
admiring the **lush lotus of Bi Pond**,
and **offering peonies from the Lacquered Brook**.
A **maiden in spring’s bloom** was **lured by a scholar**,
not coming to **trade silk**, but **seeking my schemes**.

In **fine attire**, I **forced her to yield** like a **captive bird**;
over **walls**, I **embraced her** like a **maiden’s lover**.
My **ambitions sought high rank**—
though my **teeth were broken**, I **felt no shame**;
my **desires craved union**—
though my **heart was pierced**, I **felt only joy**.

I **only knew of painted faces and dyed eyebrows**,
of **beautiful features**—
but **never considered** that **eyes and gestures betrayed** deep **violation of rites**.
My **deeds were clear as stealing a brother’s wife**,
my **tracks led to abducting a husband’s spouse**.
Such **sins**, piled high, **must bring calamity and ruin**.

In deepest fear, **the departed so-and-so**, after death,
will **fall into the Southwest’s Butchery Prison**,
to be **tried by the Officials of Mount Tai’s Judgment Bureau**,
endlessly trapped in **dark dungeons**, with **no way to escape**.

Now, with **sincere devotion**, we **repent to the Southwest’s Most Sacred Void Emperor, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.
We **humbly pray** that the **saints show mercy**,
that the **departed soul be guided**,
and that **all depraved sins be cleansed**,
so they may **be reborn in the Heaven of Joy**.
After attaining the **Dao**, they will **ascend to the Formless**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s true essence**.

We, the **officiants**, with **sincere devotion**, **repent to the Northwest’s Boundless Taihua Heavenly Lord, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**, and all **divine immortals, spirit officials**.

We **humbly hear** that in the **Western Metal Bureau**,
**the virtue of forbidding wrong is strict**.
If **humans fail to forbid wrong**,
**theft becomes rampant**.
Without **purification**, how could **transgressions be absolved**?

The **officiant** now **entrusts the departed, so-and-so**,
and **repents for the crime of theft**.
From **countless past lives**,
until **this present life**,
I **did not value the height of Western Mountains**,
but **coveted the cunning of Eastern Tombs**.
With **eyes watching and hands probing**,
I **stole by day and lurked by night**.

**For the crime of theft, we now confess:**

Alas, our greed was boundless—
like the Xiang of Song, who fell to avarice,
yet knew not the Dao—
shameful as Guisheng of Qi, who lacked its way.

Not wealth earned through toil was our aim,
but only the art of burglary and bribery.
Shouldering sacks, we rejoiced in sealed cords;
forcing gates, we scorned locks and bars.
A dropped hat won us hidden treasure—
like Zu Ban’s cunning plunder.
A shared room demanded false gold—
yet who could match Zhizi’s honesty?

Marked by rusted hem, we fell to Zhang En’s snare;
eyebrows betrayed us—no escape from Yonghe’s gaze.
Bold in theft, yet cowardly in virtue—
how like Wang Cang’s deceitful reliance on guile.
Such wickedness accumulated,
now we reap our calamity and blame.

We fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,
shall fall into the fiery prison of the Northwest,
entangled in the Taihua and Taishan officials’ scrutiny,
trapped in dark dungeons with no path to liberation.

Now, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Boundless Taihua Heavenly Lord of the Northwest, the Five-Qi Heavenly Lord**.
We humbly pray that the holy ones take pity,
that the wandering soul be guided,
that all sins of theft be cleansed,
and that rebirth in the blissful realm be attained.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,
harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.

**For the crime of broken faith, we now confess:**

The Heavenly Dao values rectitude and sincerity—
one must preserve truth to align with Heaven.
Without rectitude, how can one avoid transgression?

We, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,
and repent for the sin of dishonesty.
From countless past lives to this present one,
we spoke in vain, betrayed oaths and covenants.
Armor could not save the fallen soldier,
yet we still claimed safety;
a broken cart’s wheels did not stop our false claims of travel.
Gold, unlike Ji Bu’s word, brought no honor—
blame fell on friends who trusted us.
Our sashes differed from Zi Zhang’s honest letters—
resentment festered in the neighborhood.
We did not ponder the unyielding virtue of gold and stone,
yet still dared to deceive the spirits.
Our words, once spoken, were soon abandoned—
like the ruined speech of Lu’s people.
Our virtue was divided—
shameful as the *Odes* of Zhou.

Deceitful and hollow, we deceived both others and ourselves;
crafty and false, we failed to move even mortals—
how could we hope to sway Heaven?
We sought only to blind the world’s blind,
unafraid of the sun and moon’s judgment.
With sincerity lost, how could we escape transgression?

We fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,
shall sink into the dark paths of the underworld,
entangled in the Three Officials’ scrutiny,
with no means of escape.

Now, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **Celestial Sovereign of Jade Emptiness, the One-Qi Heavenly Lord**.
We humbly pray that the Three Officials intervene,
that the departed ascend,
that all sins of dishonesty be erased,
and that the fruit of effortless wandering be attained.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,
harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.

---

**For the crime of crookedness, we now confess:**

The Earthly Dao values sincerity and straightness—
one must walk upright to align with the land.
Without straightness, how can one avoid transgression?

We, the officiants, now entrust the departed, so-and-so,
and repent for the sin of perversity.
From countless past lives to this present one,
our bodies bent like crooked hooks,
our deeds strayed from the straight path—
we abandoned the righteous road and trod only the wicked.
Deceitful and harmful to the good,
crafty and jealous of the virtuous.
The upright had no place for us—
like Yiwu’s stacked arrows in vain.
Though the land had order, none shared the loyalty of Yu’s arrow.

Praise and blame found no truth in our actions,
while our cunning earned infamy among the shameless.
A child of five could outwit us in the market’s deceits;
though the *Three Hundred Poems* were revered,
we knew no shame in hiding our deceit.
Our efforts were spent in twisting and turning,
yet we never considered the virtue of returning to rectitude.
Such transgressions accumulated,
bringing only guilt and calamity upon ourselves.

We fear that after death, the departed, so-and-so,
shall fall into the Nine Abysses’ prison,
entangled in the Tangdu and Quancu officials’ scrutiny,
trapped in the cold realms with no path to liberation.

Now, with sincere devotion, we entrust ourselves to the **True Sovereign of the Cavern Spirit, the Nine-Piled Earthly Lord**.
We humbly pray that Tangdu’s interrogations cease,
that Quancu spare the soul,
that all sins of perversity be cleansed,
and that the fruit of effortless wandering be eternally attained.
After attaining the Dao, we ascend to the formless,
harmonizing with the Dao’s true essence.

**The All-Encompassing Night of Repentance**

We, the officiants, with wholehearted devotion, entrust ourselves to the **Ten Directions’ Great Yi Savior of Suffering, the Heavenly Sovereign of Tianqi’s Ren and Saintly Virtue, the Auspicious and Illustrious Empress of Pure and Gentle Earthly Virtue, the True Lord of Fate, the Brilliant and Trustworthy Auxiliary King, the Protector of the Realm and Manifested Marquis, the Great King of Western Qi, the True Lords of the Ten Palaces, the Eighty-Four Officials of the Six Divisions, all divine immortals, and all spirit officials**, and humbly repent.

We hear that even the ancient mirror, though bright,
may dim with filth;
the luminous toad, though radiant,
is still obscured by clouds.

The mirror’s flaw is none—defilement comes from without;
the moon’s blemish is false—clouds arise from beside it.
When filth is ground away, the mirror’s light shines clear;
when clouds are rolled back, the moon’s radiance knows no end.

How much more so for humankind, equally endowed,
whose nature is round and bright as dawn.
Yet nature drifts with passion, desire lured by things;
the mind neglects nurturing virtue, indulging instead in lust,
forging sins and evils without knowing,
forgetting origin, forgetting first principles, and failing to return.

Should one day awaken to this truth,
all ten thousand offenses shall be swept away.
Thus the Celestial Sovereign opens the great gate of **Yòu** [pardon],
and the saints widely bestow the transformation of renewal.
The benevolent wind stirs, sweeping clean the dust of the **color realm**;
the **Dharma-rain** flows, washing away the barriers of countless lives.

With sincere hearts, all find refuge in repentance—
today’s devotion is exhausted in **returning to the Dao**.

The officiant **[Name Redacted]**, reflecting on the sins of **[Name Redacted]**, deeply fears that in life,
he habitually overcame the true with the false,
abandoned enlightenment for the mundane,
disrespected sovereign and kin,
oppressed and scorned teachers and elders,
lacked benevolence toward all while hoarding selfishness,
and condemned others while justifying himself.

Though he piled up rotting grains like ancient dust,
did he ever feel pity for the widowed and orphaned?
Though he feasted on fresh meats and wore fine silks,
did he ever truly care for the hungry and cold?

The net ensnares aquatic and terrestrial **beasts and fish**,
yet heedless of losing life or body;
The whip lashes his household slaves and servants,
yet does he ever pity their wounds to the bone or flesh?

He delights in arrogance and pride, boasting of his own virtue,
and enjoys mockery and ridicule, debasing others to lose their **virtue/power**.

In weighing and measuring, there is deceit in light and heavy, large and small;
In contracts and pawns, there are falsehoods of smearing and erasing.

He slanders monks and **Daoists**,
inflicts suffering through cowardice and deceives the simple.
He often practices **spells and incantations**, profaning **spirits and gods**,
relying on his own might to defy **Heaven and Earth**.
He acts brutally in his village and neighborhood,
and envies the virtuous and the good.

Seeing gold and treasures, he is filled with greed,
secretly plotting to seize them;
Dividing fields and property, he enriches himself,
yet would he ever willingly share equally?

He privately instructs officials to frame the innocent,
and conspires with ruffians to assault the virtuous.
He seduces noble sons,
and fraternizes with **Bhikṣuṇī**;
He lends without intent to repay and breaks his promises,
and sells false goods for profit while flaunting deceit.

Such crimes and sins,
all stem from **perversity and evil**.
Today, he returns to the **high and true Daoist masters** with sincere repentance,
and earnestly seeks profound punishment for his misdeeds.

May the abundant grace of **Daoist blessings** flow,
cleansing stains and purifying filth,
breaking the dark prison of endless night,
and pointing out the path to enlightenment for those lost in delusion.

May his sins be absolved in the **Eastern Palace of Pure Radiance**,
and swift relief be granted from judgment and retribution;
May he be reborn in the **Southern Pure Land**,
and thereby attain transcendence.

May he escape the **River of Suffering**,
and reach the **Shore of Ease**,
extending even to the **Nine Mystic Realms and Seven Ancestral Abodes**,
and the **Six Paths and Three Routes**—
all freed from **Yin曹**, born into **Heavenly Dao**,
where disputes cease for the departed,
and his sins do not bind those yet to come.
May his blessings extend to both the living and the dead,
and his merit touch all beings.

After attaining the Dao,
he ascends to the **Formless**,
harmonizing with the **Dao’s true essence**.

*End of Volume Eighty-Five of the Daoist Canon of Great Rules and Regulations*
*Beginning of Volume Eighty-Six of the Daoist Canon of Great Rules and Regulations*

**The *Lingbao Chongshen Great Ritual* of Master Guangcheng Du Guangting**
*Natural Dao Practice Ceremony*

The ritual master ascends the platform in proper form.
Each reverently invokes the Dao as prescribed.
The Sacred Protective Incantations are proclaimed.
The Five Stars shine resplendent, auspicious *qi* ascends in flight.
The Primordial Gathering of Spirits—Heaven and Earth in harmonious cycle—
The Jade Talismans and Sacred Nodes command the unseen with their breath.
Fire is cast, might is displayed—wickedness and malevolence are banished without trace.
Ten thousand demons are subdued, their chaotic blooms dispersed.
Monstrous evils are crushed, Daoist *qi* flows unobstructed.
Divine radiance illuminates the night, all shadowy obstructions are withdrawn.
Ten thousand spirits descend in order, their banners borne upon the wind.
All living beings prosper, blessings pervade the land—
in harmony with the Dao’s true essence.

The Supreme Law Drum is struck twenty-four times.
The furnace is ignited.

The **Supreme Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin’s Three *Qi* of the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao,**
summon forth from within my body the **Three Five Functionary Officials, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Incense-Bearers, the Relay Dragon Cavalry, the Attendant Golden Boys, the Speech-Bearing Flower-Sprinkling Jade Maidens, the Five Emperors’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officials—**
a total of **thirty-six**—
who emerge in solemn ceremonial attire, their caps and sashes adorned with trailing ribbons.
They open the **Mysterious Dao’s Land and Domain Spirits**.

Now, in this quiet night of Dao practice, I humbly petition to declare my intent.
All sincere hearts have been recorded and heard.
May the **Supreme Ten-Directional True Dao’s *qi* of the Most High, the Lingbao Auspicious Light**, descend upon my body,
so that my invocation may swiftly reach the **Supreme Boundless Great Dao, the Jade Gate of the Celestial Sovereign, before the Jade Emperor of Heaven’s Supreme Court**.

I request the proclamation of my ritual rank.
**The humble servant [name],** in deepest reverence, now addresses:
The **Three Pure Ones, the Supreme Emperors, the Solar and Lunar Deities, the Southern Celestial and Northern Dipper, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Four Sacred True Immortals,**
the **transmitting teachers and sacred assemblies of all ages,**
the **Yingdu officials, the Mountain and Marsh Spirits, the Constitutional Bureau’s Caverns, the Water Realm’s Thunder Lords, the City Gods and Warming Departments, the local temples and ancestral shrines,**
and **all responsive spirits**.

May they all gaze upon the boundless mercy, pierce through the crimson sincerity.

I have heard:
*"Great and transforming—this is called sagehood;*
*sagehood fills the space between Heaven and Earth.*
*Sensitive and responsive—this is called divinity;*
*divinity adapts across the four seas.*

*From the stars of the vault above,*
*emanates the awe-inspiring spirit below,*
*governing mountains and rivers in Heaven’s stead,*
*observing the people’s excesses and blessings.*

*At the utmost of goodness, one attains blessings;*
*at the depth of vice, one invites calamity.*
*Impartial without favor—*
*only the upright may be rectified.*

*Heaven, through divine decree, punishes transgressions;*
*man, through divine decree, bestows prosperity and omens.*
*Divine and human rely upon each other,*
*Heaven’s Way must oversee and illuminate.*

*Virtue earns divine favor,*
*mercy is never withheld.*

The ritual master **[name]**, though placed among mortals, relies utterly upon divine protection.
Though I offer the sacrificial rites, my reverence may yet be insufficient;
though I present my pure intentions, I hope to merit a clear response.
I recite the hidden verses of the **Jade Chapters**, sing the profound hymns of the **Azure Void**.

With deepest awe, I honor the Primordial Mercy,
and thus extend my blessings.

My duty is to propagate the Dao,
my resolve to aid the age—
to cultivate merit through deeds,
to rescue the people and benefit all things.

All matters revealed, how could I fail to report?
All words sincere, I now declare them in full.

**Proclamation of the Petition:**
The words are examined with care, the sincerity is evident.
Without proper ritual procedures, how could the Dao’s spirits be moved to their utmost?
Without the Dao’s established forms, how could divine power be augmented?

Thus, I rely upon my Daoist companions
to reverently perform the **Heavenly Sciences**,
hoping to restore the abundant mercy of Heaven,
and amplify the boundless power of the spirits.

I have heard:
*"If the ruler does not govern himself,*
*he entrusts the officials to rule the people;*
*Heaven, though silent,*
*delegates the spirits to aid transformation.*

*All who share responsibility in sacred shrines and blessed lands*
*propagate the Dao’s flow in mighty counties and renowned domains.*
*They curb excess, reward humility,*
*recompense the virtuous and punish the wicked.*

*All signs of fortune or calamity*
*are reflected in their influence."*

With today’s reverent worship of the gods and practice of the Dao,
I beseech the multitude of teachings to kindle this **first incense offering**,
wishing that this incense smoke
may nourish the **Supreme Three Sovereigns** and all the **Celestial Worthies and Supreme Deities**.

With these **meritorious deeds**,
I offer prayers to the divine ranks.
**Humbly I pray** that my **true understanding** may swiftly awaken,
that my **Daoist attainments** may be ever greater,
to partake in the **spirits’ boundless blessings**,
and ascend to the **highest grades of Immortality**.

Then may **blessings flow upon the imperial lineage**,
and **protection extend to the sacred realm**,
so that the **four seas may be at peace**,
and the **eight directions may be tranquil**.

Now, as I burn this incense,
I myself **take refuge in the Dao’s Most Honored, Great Saints, and Perfectly True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
I shall rise into the **Formless Realm**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s True Essence**.

I have heard:
*"Secret speech transmitted to the world*
*is the gateway to all wonders;
*The Dao’s formlessness*
*ever resides in the **profound designs** of the scriptures.*

*The teachings and laws are fundamentally one principle,*
*yet the wise and foolish diverge in their paths.
*If one can **quietly reflect** to **fathom its meaning**,
*then one may **direct the heart** to **grasp the Dao**."*

With today’s reverent worship of the gods and practice of the Dao,
I beseech the multitude of teachings to kindle this **second incense offering**,
wishing that this incense smoke
may nourish the **Celestial Saints of the Constellations** and the **Highest True Ones of the Purple Extremity**.

With these **meritorious deeds**,
I offer prayers to the divine ranks.
**Humbly I pray** that my **spiritual clarity** may be further illuminated,
that my **divine martial power** may be upheld,
to be **venerated in the temple offerings** and **enduringly honored**,
and to fulfill the **highest Immortal duties** at the **Lantern Platform**.

Then may **grace extend to the unseen realms**,
and **blessings descend upon the dark passes**,
so that all **souls trapped in the netherworld’s prisons** may swiftly attain transcendence to the **Immortal Realm**.

Now, as I burn this incense,
I myself **take refuge in the scriptures’ Most Honored, Great Saints, and Perfectly True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
I shall rise into the **Formless Realm**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s True Essence**.

I have heard:
*"To **openly guide all beings**,
and **recite the primordial teachings**;
*For the **roots of all virtues**,
it is right to **revere the Master’s authority**.*

*The wonders of **realization** are already attained beforehand,*
*The **lofty and refined** manner holds sway thereafter.
*May this **devoted follower** be cherished,*
*And may your **virtuous deeds** be held in awe."*

Now, with reverence for the Dao and its practices,
we humbly request the assembled assembly of the Law to kindle these three incense sticks.
May this fragrant smoke ascend to nourish the **Mountain and River Deities, Imperial Sovereigns, and Water-Land Immortals**.

Through this merit and virtue,
we dedicate it to the **Master of the Rite, the [Family Name] household**.
May divine blessings pervade far and wide,
and calamities and misfortunes be concealed and dispelled.

May descendants inherit noble titles,
their halls filled with **Cui Lin’s** scepters;
may filial piety be passed through generations,
their granaries overflowing like **Guo Ju’s** gold.

Those who manage affairs shall abound in wealth,
and officials shall prosper in all state matters.
May fortune flow like rivers,
and lifespan endure as **Mount Song’s** heights.

Let there be rain every ten days and wind every five,
so the people may hope for autumn harvests;
let three years of tilling yield nine years of reserves,
so the world may know no sorrow of barren years.
May every household live in peace,
and every well be filled with prosperity.

Now, as I burn this incense,
I myself **take refuge in the Master’s, the Great Saints’, and the Perfectly True Virtue**.
After attaining the Dao,
I shall rise into the **Formless Realm**,
and **harmonize with the Dao’s True Essence**.
I reaffirm my devotion to the **Law’s station**.

We, the humble servants **[Name] and others**,
with utmost sincerity and reverence,
address the **Three Pure Ones, Supreme Deities, the Celestial Sovereign and Lunar Emperor, the Southern Celestial Ensign and Northern Dipper, the Three Officials and Five Emperors, the Four Holy Immortals, and all venerable teachers and saints who have transmitted the teachings and scriptures across generations**—
as well as the **Spirits of the Netherworld, Mountain and River Deities, the Constitutional Bureau of the Underworld, Celestial Peaks, Water Realm Thunder Lords, City Gods and Warm Departments, and all responsive spirits**—
all hoping for your boundless mercy,
and humbly seeking your illumination to release our bonds.

We have heard:
*The Three Heavens and Ten Extremes are the abode of the Holy Ones;
The Nine Provinces and Eight Strings are governed by deities and spirits.*
For the Emperor rules with decrees from the Nine Enclosures,
and his spirits spread across the Four Seas.

Thus, the relationship between Heaven and spirits is like water bearing a boat;
the harmony between spirits and humans is like echoes responding to sounds.
When the people suffer misfortune or blessing, the spirits’ gaze is swift as lightning;
when calamities or auspicious signs arise, Heaven’s oversight is clear and manifest.
Sometimes they assist the nation in great deeds,
sometimes they aid the people in removing harm—
as when the wooden horse sweated in omen,
or the golden rooster heralded dawn.
There were the marvels of the **Copper Beam and Jade Ramparts’** defenses,
and the grand events of the **Wei River and Pearl River**.

How much more so, when Heaven does not bestow its great responsibilities,
can Earth truly know boundless peace?
The mountains and rivers stand firm on unbroken foundations,
and the logic of human and ghostly coexistence is unharmed.
All these are the **Dao’s protective guidance**,
ensuring the people live in tranquil security.

This **Master of the Rite, [Name]**, has long revered the divine,
and though he has often undertaken **mining sacrifices** with sincerity,
his rites have not yet been perfectly devout,
and he has always feared the calamities of disrespect,
unable to attain the joy of lasting honor.
Thus, he now humbly follows the **Mysterious Canon**,
solemnly establishes the **Orchid Platform**,
and arranges the rites of **offerings, incense, and sacred texts**,
presenting his heartfelt and earnest petitions.
Facing the divine light, he conducts the **Rite of Expiation**,
and before the spirits, he proclaims his devotion.
May the divine power turn from its wrath,
and in mercy, regard his repeated supplications.

May the Five Stars follow their courses,
bringing frequent abundance to the people’s grains;
may the Three Stages of Great Peace arrive,
so that rain and sun fall in perfect harmony.
Let the people bask in the **North Star’s** virtuous governance,
and scholars glimpse the **East Wall’s** literary brilliance.
May merchants flock to the **Celestial Market’s** walls,
and officials ascend to the **Literary Luck’s** hall.

May farmers’ seeds take root with bountiful blessings,
and maidens’ silkworms thrive with plentiful harvests.
Further, may the **Star of Greed** vanish without trace,
and the **Heavenly Dog** turn its head in retreat.
Let the **ten-thousand-mile miasma of demons** be swept away by the **Celestial River’s** waters,
and the **myriad spirits** receive their rewards,
their **Dipper’s Handle** restored and reinforced.

Next, we pray for the purification of counties and districts,
for universal tranquility across all lands,
that no household suffer fire or flood,
and no region endure plague or pestilence.
May harmonious *qi* fill the land,
and the era of **Great Peace** be shared by all.
We humbly receive the **transformative decrees** of the divine,
and gratefully acknowledge the **renewed blessings** of salvation.
Above, we honor the **Divine Lord’s** boundless virtue,
and below, we fulfill the people’s reverent aspirations.

With utmost reverence, we submit this petition.
**Twelve Wishes fulfilled.**
The incense burner is now extinguished.

We solemnly charge the **Incense Officials, Dragon and Tiger Messengers, and Attendant Spirit Officials**—
let them now guide this servant’s past **Dao-practicing sites**,
where **golden elixirs, jade-green herbs, and hundred-spirited numinous plants** shall naturally arise.
May all the **Celestial Children and Jade Maidens** of the Ten Directions
attend to the orchid smoke,
and swiftly transmit this servant’s sincere entreaties
directly to the **Supreme, Boundless Dao, and before the Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign**.

**Exit the Hall in Praise.**
**Exit the Door.**

**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Daoist Gate, Volume Eighty-Six Complete**
**The Complete Ritual Codes of the Daoist Gate, Volume Eighty-Seven: The Grand Ritual of the *Lingbao* Venerable and Sacred**

**Ritual Procedures for Daoist Practice and Offerings**
The ritual platform ascends as usual.
Each pays homage to the Daoist Master in accordance with the prescribed rites.
The sacred incantations of the *Lingbao* are proclaimed.
The Five Stars array themselves in radiance, illuminating the Five Directions.
The Water Star repels calamities; the Woodly Virtue brings prosperity.
The Wandering Star dispels misfortune; the Great White Star wards off armies.
The Steadfast Star holds firm; the realm and family flourish in harmony.
Their names are inscribed upon the Jade Tablets; their words recorded in the Celestial Archives.
Riding the gusts, they scatter their blessings through the boundless expanse,
entering and exiting the unseen, feasting and wandering across the Ten Directions.
The Five Clouds rise as banners, summoning the gods and restraining the winds.
They command all ten thousand spirits,
guard the Daoist Sage with their sacred vigil,
and unite with the Dao in its perfect truth.

**Twenty-four Beats of the Ritual Drum are sounded.**
The incense burner is lit.

**Invocation of the Supreme Three Heavens and the Primordial Dao**
The **Supreme Primordial Origin of the Three Heavens** and the **Celestial Dao Lord**,
the **Supreme Old Lord**,
now call forth from this servant’s body the **Three Five Officials of Power**,
the **Left and Right Official Messengers**,
the **Left and Right Incense Bearers**,
the **Dragon and Tiger Couriers** and **Mounted Attendants**,
the **Golden Boys Attending Incense**,
and the **Jade Maidens Transmitting Words and Scattering Flowers**,
along with the **Five Emperors’ Direct Symbols**,
the **Incense Officials of the Direct Sun**,
and the **Thirty-Six Combined Attendants**—all now emerge.

**Those who depart are clad in solemn, resplendent robes,**
with **headgear and trailing ribbons**,
opening the **Mysterious Gate** to the **Land and Soil Deities** and the **Territorial Spirits**.

This servant, in the quiet of night, now practices the Dao.
With utmost sincerity, we present this petition to declare our intent,
and all our earnest supplications are already recorded and conveyed.
We pray that the **Supreme Dao of the Ten Directions**,
the **Sacred Light of the *Lingbao***,
may descend and flow into this servant’s body,
so that our words may swiftly reach the **Supreme Boundless Dao**,
before the **Jade Emperor of the Celestial Sovereign’s Golden Gate**.

**The Ritual Position is Invoked.**
This servant, along with the **Assembled Attendants of the Dao**,
now humbly and sincerely presents this petition
to the **Three Pure Ones of the Celestial Sovereign**,
the **Ten Supreme Dao Lords**,
the **Sun Emperor and Moon Empress**,
the **Southern Celestial and Northern Dipper**,
the **Three Officials and Five Emperors**,
the **Four Sacred Dao Immortals**,
and the **Lineage of Teachers and Saints** who have propagated the Dao and transmitted scriptures through the ages,
as well as the **Spirits of the Netherworld and Mountain Altars**,
the **Celestial Bureaus and Earthly Enclosures**,
the **Water Realm and Thunderous Commanders**,
the **City Deities and Benevolent Departments**,
and all **Responsive Spirits of the Local Realm**,
who all look upon this servant with **abundant compassion**,
and **piercingly reveal the sincerity of our prayers**.

We hear that the **Dao of Heaven is profound and mysterious**,
and **virtue alone is its support**.
The **Divine and Sacred** are upright,
and **depend upon humanity**.
With reverence, we purify our **common hearts**,
and **awaken the bright virtue** within.
The **spirits and numinous beings** are ever-present,
and their **refined essence** shall surely manifest.

We humbly consider the **Divine Positions**—
they **protect the realm and shelter the people**,
**eliminate harm and promote prosperity**,
their names inscribed in the **sacrificial records**,
and their brilliance as clear as the stars.
On this auspicious day of **dispelling ill fortune**,
we joyfully present our **fragrant incense offerings**,
and all beings share in the celebration,
while the myriad classes flourish in harmony.

We hope for a **favorable response to our petition**,
and that our **earnest efforts** may be slightly granted.

**The Sacred Descent is Invoked; the First Offering is Made; Flowers are Scattered.**
This servant, with all sincerity, now presents this petition
to the **Three Pure Ones of the Celestial Sovereign**,
the **Ten Supreme Dao Lords**,
the **Grand Ritual Assembly and Sacred Oaths**,
and all the **True Sovereigns**.

We pray that the **abundant compassion** may be **piercingly returned**,
and that the **clear divine insight** may be **fully revealed**.
We hear that the **Divine** is ever-ready to lend aid to humanity,
and **never abandons those without virtue**—
for the **Supreme Sage** does not dwell where there is no virtue,
and thus virtue is the means to attain the Sacred.

If we **seek the Sacred with our common nature**,
we may doubt its **remoteness and inaccessibility**.
But if the **Sacred responds to the common**,
it does so through **compassionate radiance**.

We humbly consider the **Divine Positions**—
with **one radiant spirit**, they descend to the earth.
To **sever demons and expel sins** is as easy as plucking wood;
to **assist the realm and prosper the state** is to **wield their mighty power with vigor**.

The auspicious hour is graciously met,
and repaying virtue is never forgotten.

With millet, rice, gourds, and flowers,
we humbly offer our reverent rites;
with wisdom and uprightness,
we await the **mysterious response** of the **hidden forces**.

Now we present our **sincere words**,
and solemnly declare them.
The **words are proclaimed**, the **secondary offering** is made,
and **flowers are scattered**.

The **words clearly announce**,
and their meaning is **fully understood** by the wise.

Now, your disciple, [name omitted], with **earnest and fervent prayer**,
has **fully expressed** the sincerity of his heart;
the **mighty spirit** is **unfathomable**,
like the **hope of a response** from a **deep valley**.

We humbly pray that, though the **Divine Presence** is above
and our **sincerity** lies beside,
you may **graciously respond** to the prayers of the **common and unworthy**,
and with **hearing that is keen** and **vision that is respectful**,
bestow upon us your **greatest mercies**.

We hear that the **Divine** is **self-illuminating**,
and that the **rites** record its **foreknowledge**;
to **wield virtue and bestow blessings**,
is the **foundation** of the **established Dao**.

Only through the **profound and reverent** nature of the **Divine**,
does this **small and humble light** arise.

Though the **Divine Insight** is vast and **piercingly clear**,
it is the **flowing radiance** of its **wise and enlightened** nature.

We humbly consider the **Divine Positions**—
the **celestial orbits** divide their **luminous brilliance**,
and the **mountains and peaks** display their **splendid essence**.
They are **both Sage and Divine**,
able to **establish Heaven** and **establish the Dao**,
with **mighty power** and **radiant spirit**,
and **auspicious titles** bestowed in praise.

Your disciple, with **firm resolve** and **earnest cultivation**,
offers **fragrant incense and pure libations** in reverence,
humbly hoping that the **Divine Essence** may be **present as ever**,
and **wondrous transformations** come to **gratify us**.
May they **oversee our rites** and **record our sincerity**,
listen to our **words** and **observe our deeds**.

The **Divine’s beloved children**,
their blessings are **endless for the people**.

All here are **devout and reverent**,
and humbly present their **final offering**.
**Flowers are scattered**.

Your disciple, with **renewed sincerity**, solemnly addresses the **Three Pure Ones**,
the **Ten Celestial Extremes** of the **Highest Truths**,
the **rites of expiation** and **binding oaths**,
and all **True Sovereigns**.

May they all **aspire to the mighty compassion**,
and **look down with clear discernment**.

We hear that **humanity** is the **heart of Heaven and Earth**,
and without it, Heaven and Earth would **lack their purpose**.
The **Divine** is the **source of yin and yang**,
and without it, yin and yang would **lose their efficacy**.

Heaven does not act without humanity,
and humanity does not **hold dominion** without Heaven.
When **Heaven and humanity interact harmoniously**,
then the **Three Talents** govern together;
when **Divine and ghosts align in accord**,
then **one virtue** is **deeply established**.

We humbly consider the **Divine Positions**—
they **consort with Heaven**,
hold the **ancient Dao**,
and receive the **favor of the Supreme Divinity**,
**guiding the threads of the lower realm**.

Our **revered state**, with **devout rites**,
honors those who **bring no calamity** with **temple titles**,
and bestows **auspicious names** upon those with **meritorious deeds**.

Thus, they may **support and protect** the **nation and its people**,
and **bring lasting peace** to the **community and its dwellers**.

Your disciple, under **Divine Grace**, has **many days**,
yet **repaying virtue** is **ever delayed**.
He **briefly extends** the **rite of humble offering**,
to **sincerely express** his **deepest gratitude**.

Now, with **threefold offerings complete**,
the **words are no longer repeated**,
praying that **great virtue** may **be inclusive**,
and **blessings** may **never fail** the **common folk**.

From this day forward,
**guilt** will be **revealed like dew** and **immediately forgiven**;
**blessings** will **flow like rivers**,
and **never cease** for those who **seek them from the east or west**.

The **Dao’s path** will be **smooth and unobstructed**,
families will be **secure and peaceful**,
and **official and private conflicts** will **all be eliminated**.
**Bandits and ferocious beasts** will **be kept at bay**,
and all who **dwell and move** will **long rely upon Divine Protection**.

Yet our **lowly sentiments** are **unworthy** of such **devout prayers**.

**Twelve Vows** are made.
The **incense burner is returned**.

The **humble** Daoist officials—**Incense Master** and attendants, the **Dragon-Tiger Lords** at left and right, and the **Attendants of the Incense**—
shall now command that **wherever I have previously established** the **sacrificial rites** and **practiced the Dao**,
there will **naturally arise** the **golden nectar** and **emerald elixir**,
the **herbs and spirits of myriad blessings**,
and the **multitude of worthies** will **gather and assemble**,
right here before this **Incense Altar**.

I now **solemnly vow** that the **celestial children and maidens** of the **ten directions**,
will **attend and receive** the **fragrant incense vapors**,
and **convey my sincere entreaties** as I have previously **offered**,
**swiftly reaching** the **Supreme Dao of the Boundless and Limitless**,
the **Heavenly Jade Emperor** and **Divine Sovereign** before the **Celestial Court**.

**Reciting the scriptures** upon leaving the hall,
**taking leave of the Master**.
**Escorting the Holy**,
**transforming wealth**.

**Complete** the **Daoist precepts and regulations**—
the **Comprehensive Collection of Daoist Doctrines and Rituals**, Volume **Eighty-Seven**, **concluded**.
