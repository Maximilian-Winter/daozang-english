**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Great Highest’s Reversion to the Hidden Dao for Removing Sins from the Registers**

The Great Highest’s Jade Perfected Conceals the Primordial in Inner Contemplation. On the six *ding* days within the six *jia* cycles, at midnight—the hour when generative *qi* arises—Heaven’s Primordial unfolds its array, the womb’s bonds are doubly secure, the seven *po* ascend in speech, and the three *hun* record transgressions. Ancestral errors of seven generations and accumulated punishments of the Three Yin thus necessitate the method of dissolution to absolve transgressions and sins.

Those who practice this Dao are called seekers of immortality. Regularly, on the *ding-mao* day within the *jia-zi* cycle, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the bedchamber, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly intone the incantation:

*"First, the Supreme Star: Dark Pivot, Yang Brightness, Hun Spirit, Supreme Mystery, Nine Lords of the Upper Primordial."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the Yang sins and Yang transgressions of my seven generations past, down to my own person, all be dissolved. May all aspirations be fulfilled, all affairs align with the heart, and may I ascend the Seven Primordials, attaining harmony with Heaven. May my name be inscribed in the Dipper’s dawn, and my lifespan extended for billions of years."*

Upon completion, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into the heart. Envision the starlight illuminating within and without, penetrating all. Focus intently upon this—this is called *Dissolving the Morning’s Entangling Net and Illuminating the Inner Dao*.

On the *ding-chou* day within the *jia-xu* cycle, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the bedchamber, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly intone the incantation:

*"Second, the Primordial Star: Northern Terrace, Yin Essence, Celestial Rotator, Hun Spirit, Supreme Jade, Nine Lords of the Upper Mystery."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the Yin sins and Yin transgressions of my seven generations past, down to my own person, all be dissolved. May the Six *Qi* fill and overflow, the Four Spirits be rendered empty and receptive. May I ascend the Seven Primordials, my name inscribed in the Jade Scriptures, ascend to the Purple Clarity, ride the Dark Chariot of Emptiness, and move in harmony with Heaven’s decree, prosperous and upright."*

Upon completion, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into the lungs. Let their light penetrate within and without, making the Five Viscera distinct. Again, visualize the stars entering your mouth, sensing their radiance scattering and filling it. When warmth is felt within the mouth, this is the sign of the stellar essence’s arrival.

In all contemplations of the Seven Primordials and the Dao of the Nine Mornings, the bed and mat must not be shared with others, nor should clothing. Those who sleep together, male and female, are recorded in the Registers of Northern Mystery’s Sins. If one violates defilement, calamity is inscribed in the Earth Prison.

However, sharing with a master or fellow disciple of the same *qi* is not considered a violation.

On the *ding-hai* day within the *jia-shen* cycle, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the bedchamber, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly pray:

*"Third, the Perfected Star: Nine Ultimates, Supreme Perfected, Upper Primordial Person, Heavenly Mechanism, *Po* Essence, Supreme Simplicity, Nine Lords of the Upper Plain."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the death sins and death transgressions of my seven ancestors past, down to my own person—accumulated evils, private wickedness, and offenses against the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water—all be dissolved. May my eyes see clearly, penetrating the obscure and unseen. May I ascend the Seven Primordials, my name inscribed in the Supreme Clarity, command the myriad spirits, ascend to the Jade Court, ride the luminous chariot through the void, and attain harmony with Heaven."*

Upon completion, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into the liver. Let their light illuminate the Five Viscera, penetrating within and without. Then, facing north, bow twice. Upon rising, swallow saliva nine times, or stand and bow.

On the *ding-you* day within the *jia-wu* cycle, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the bedchamber, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly pray:

*"Fourth, the Pivot Star: Rotating Root, Dark Obscurity, Celestial Balance, *Po* Essence, Supreme Emptiness, Nine Lords of the Upper Void."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the sins of ingratitude and lack of virtue, of unkindness and unfiliality—myriad Yin evils of my seven generations past, down to my own person—all be eradicated. May I ingest essence and absorb *qi*, daily advancing in attainment. May I ascend the Seven Primordials, my name recorded in the Great Mystery, listed among the Jade Emperor’s ranks, ride the luminous chariot through the Nine Heavens, command spirits and govern numina, and share the heart of the sun and moon."*

Upon completion, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into the spleen. Let their light shine brilliantly, illuminating the Five Viscera. Then, swallow saliva fourteen times.

On the *ding-wei* day within the *jia-chen* cycle, at midnight, sit upright on the bed in the bedchamber, face north, clasp the hands, and knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly pray:

*"Fifth, the Principal Star: Celestial Balance, Cinnabar Primordial, Jade Pivot, *Po* Spirit, Upper Primordial Lord, Supreme Mystery, Nine August Lords."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the inner and outer defilements and transgressions of my seven generations past, down to my own person—myriad errors recorded in the Dark Pass—all be dissolved. May my body fill the Yellow Court, stabilizing the stomach’s center. May I ascend to the Great Simplicity, ride the luminous chariot to the Purple Palace, with Jade Maidens attending on the right and Jade Lads on the left. May I share the radiance of the sun and moon, and be enthroned as a Perfected King."*

Then, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, flying into your mouth, and entering directly into your stomach, their radiance illuminating and distinctly revealing the five viscera. This done, swallow saliva thirty-six times.

On a *ding-si* day within the *jia-yin* ten-day period, at midnight, sit upright on your bed in the bedchamber, facing north with hands clasped. First, knock the teeth seven times. Then, gazing upward, visualize the Seven Stars shining brilliantly in the north. After a long while, softly pray:

*"Sixth, the Star of Destiny’s Mechanism: Northern Culmen, Opening Yang, *Po* Spirit, Upper Cinnabar, True Sovereign of the Void, Nine Lords."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the sins and transgressions of my seven generations past, down to my own person—all the thieving, malevolent, treacherous, rebellious, and reckless crimes I have committed or enacted, those that have implicated the celestial records and imperial officials—all be dissolved. May the hundred ailments be healed, the body’s qi flow smoothly and uprightly, my name inscribed on the Terrace of Immortals, engraved upon golden tablets of the Upper Clarity. May I command the ten thousand spirits and soar through the Nine Luminaries."*

This done, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, entering directly into your mouth and settling in the kidneys, their radiance penetrating and distinctly revealing the five viscera. This done, swallow saliva twenty-eight times.

On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left kidney; on yin days, the right kidney. The first day is yang, the second yin. This practice strictly forbids exposure to blood, filth, foul odors, or the consumption of meat and pungent foods. Violation will bring calamity upon the seven ancestors above and oneself below, reducing one to a lowly ghost after death, erased from the gates of the celestial court.

On the evening of the last day of the lunar month, before the cock crows at the dawn of the new moon, sit upright on your bed in the bedchamber, facing east with hands clasped. Knock the teeth seven times, then gaze upward and visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly to your left. After a long while, softly pray:

*"Seventh, the Pass Star: Mysterious Yang, Celestial Pass, Jade Radiance, Great Brilliance, Supreme Jade Sovereign of the Dao."*

Invoke it seven times, then pray:

*"May the hidden and obscured sins of my seven generations past, down to my own person—all the violations of the Celestial Net, the Five Punishments, and the myriad spirits within the body, recorded in the Ghost Bureau of the Northern Emperor—all be dissolved. May my spirit and essence flow freely in eight directions, enabling me to sit or stand at will, to hear sounds beyond hearing, and to see with eyes that emit purple light. May my name be carved upon the jade tablets of the Great Simplicity, my vision penetrating the formless. May my name be inscribed in the records of the Celestial Lords, my destiny equal to the Two Luminaries. May I soar through the Seven Primes and repose in the Purple Court."*

This done, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens, entering directly into your mouth, and passing into the pupils of your eyes, illuminating both within and without, enabling you to see the five viscera distinctly. On yang days, visualize the stars entering the left pupil; on yin days, the right pupil.

On the six *jia* days, at the hour when generative qi arises at midnight, lie or sit on your bed in the bedchamber with your head facing any direction. Clench your fists, close your breath, and settle the spirit. After a long while, knock the teeth nine times. Then visualize the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper shining brilliantly above your neck, their rays extending so that two stars appear before the Dipper’s handle, their radiance intermingling. Softly pray:

*"Eighth, the Imperial Star: Most High Jade Sovereign, Spirit of the Eight Effulgences, Primordial Lord. Ninth, the Venerable Star: Jade Sovereign of the Great Tenuity, Spirit of the Seven Dawns of the Primordial Simplicity."*

Invoke them nine times, then pray:

*"May the sins and transgressions of my nine generations of ancestors, down to my own person—all the great and small offenses committed against hills, mountains, rivers, and streams, those inscribed in the registers of the dead, the hidden malevolence, concealed treachery, and myriad deceptions recorded in the Ghost Bureau of Mount Feng—along with the capital crimes listed in the black ledgers of the Nine Primes of the Great Ultimate before the Northern Emperor, beseech the Most High Jade Sovereign of the Nine Primes to dissolve them all. May I soar through the Seven Paths, ascend to the Jade Clarity, and wander the Great Void. May I ride the luminous chariot of dawn’s birth, feast in the Eight Simplicities of the north, and rival the sun in splendor. May I join the celestial assembly, command the ten thousand spirits, and govern the myriad numina."*

This done, visualize the Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper descending from the heavens and entering the Purple Chamber of the Muddy Pellet, their radiance illuminating it so that light suffuses the entire body and the five viscera, both within and without, generating clouds of purple qi that billow densely. Hold this vision steadfastly. This done, swallow saliva fifty-four times.

Should the days of the six jia or six ding, or the last day of the lunar month, find one’s meditative focus nearing completion, one may then proceed with gradual refinement, weighing and cultivating the practice without undue frequency or intensity. In all matters, follow this example, ensuring the true method remains wholly intact.

Herein concludes the Dao of the Most High’s Return to the Origin and Atonement for Transgressions.

The Most High sealed the Five Penetrations on the Five Marchmounts’ jade caskets. The Dao of Returning to the Origin was concealed within the Palace of the Nine Dawns. Having cultivated the Five Penetrations, one must practice the Return to the Origin: the Five Penetrations open at the Sovereign’s Beginning, while the Return to the Origin is bound to the Mysterious End. Thus, those who cultivate the Five Penetrations and traverse the Seven Primes’ Hidden Dao of Return must abstain from blood, raw flesh, and pungent foods. Should one encounter corpses or impurities and transgress, they shall face the Great Mysterious Judgment.

The Five Penetrations are the Most High’s auspicious days; the Return to the Origin, the Most High’s days of renewal. Without knowledge of the Five Penetrations, one cannot dissolve transgressions or erase faults; without knowledge of the Return to the Origin’s Hidden Dao, one cannot be enrolled among the Perfected of the Upper Realms. On these days, one should meditate upon auspicious matters, first atoning for the transgressions within one’s body—thereby untying the knots of seven generations and escaping the bonds of punishment and fate. Only then may one be revealed to the immortals of the Nine Palaces.

For all who cultivate the affairs of the Cavern Chamber and Purple Chamber, or visualize the Nine Primes and Seven Primes, at the onset of sleep or upon first lying down, and before and after meals, first offer this subtle invocation:

*"Five Stars, Five Penetrations,
Six Harmonies, Purple Chamber,
Return to the Origin, Hidden Dao,
Vast and Lofty Seven Dawns.
The soul’s begetter is the Mysterious Father—
the Father transforms into the One, becoming spirit.
The spirit’s begetter is the Mysterious Mother—
the Mother transforms into the Two, giving birth to the body.
The Lord Son gathers my sinews and bones;
White Prime governs my essence and qi.
Long life and enduring vision,
soaring as an immortal through the Ten Heavens."*

This done, ensure no ear hears the sound of the invocation. This is the Most High’s Hidden Invocation, for dispelling pernicious qi, summoning spirit and essence, and ensuring one remains untroubled by obscurity throughout life.

Here ends the *Upper Clarity Scripture of the Most High’s Hidden Dao of Returning to the Origin for Erasing the Registers of Transgressions*.
