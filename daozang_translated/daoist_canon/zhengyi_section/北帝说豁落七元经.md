# 北帝说豁落七元经

**The Northern Emperor’s Scripture of the Seven Luminaries of the Vast Expanse**

At that time, the Primordial Perfected ascended the Phoenix Tower of the Purple Gold Hall, expounding the ranks and titles of the Three Origins, delivering and liberating the multitudes of beings, that they might know the law of karmic retribution.

At that moment, the Three Clarities congealed their qi, the sun and moon shone brightly, the Three Luminaries radiated solemnity, and divine birds sounded their music as the celestial perfected gathered in assembly. Then, the Great Perfected of the Nine Heavens of the North arrived, pacing the stars and treading the Dipper, clad in a cloud-robe of single brocade, and presented himself before the seat. He wished to expound for all beings the methods of prolonging life and preserving destiny, to propagate them throughout the Middle Kingdom, dispel demons and annihilate spirits, dissolve calamities and deliver from peril, rescue those in dire straits, and bring universal peace and tranquility.

He entreated the Emperor to proclaim widely, admonishing all demonic forces under heaven to recognize the source of their transgressions, to cultivate wholesome thoughts, and to cease harming living beings, that they might daily accrue merit.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: "Above the Three Realms, the Great Demon King of the Northern Emperor governs below in the mountains of the summit of Luofeng in the northern seas of heaven and earth. The mountain rises two thousand six hundred li in height and spans thirty thousand li in circumference. Within and without, all is adorned with halls and chambers of the seven treasures, forming a magnificent capital. He presides over the registers of the life and death of all people, and none among the spirits and gods of the world do not submit to him."

The Northern Emperor said: "My exalted position commands the thirty-two offices of the heavens, binding the ledgers of all the heavens. The Celestial Emperor comes to bow in reverence, the myriad gods of the world come to pay homage, and the ten thousand ghosts and thousand spirits all tremble in submission. I now reveal the names of these Six Heavenly Palaces, which belong to the lords of the Six Great Demon Kings. They know the teachers of the myriad ghosts and hold sway over the hun and po of living people. Bound in heavy fetters, they are imprisoned by the yin spirits. Their names are recorded in the offices of the ghost officials, entangling and burdening the living. Descendants suffer lawsuits and trials, illnesses and decline persist for years, and misfortunes and calamities assail them. If one knows the names of my Six Palaces and recites them morning and evening, evil ghosts will not dare approach, and malevolent spirits will be subdued and destroyed. Disasters will be unable to encroach, the hun and po will be clear and upright, the spirit and qi will remain at peace, and the myriad spirits will tremble in awe."

The Northern Emperor addressed the Seven Perfected, saying: "In former times, my master cultivated the Dao and performed purification rites, establishing merit to save people, aiding beings according to their needs, and perfecting his virtues. Through diligent offerings of incense and lamps over countless kalpas, he practiced the transformations of the Dao, delivering and uplifting the multitudes, enabling them to know the law of retribution, escape the demonic realms, and together enter the Dao of the True and Upright. Those who cultivate and wear the numinous writ, pray and perform offerings to the perfected officials, reverse fate and extend their years, resolve calamities and remove obstacles, dispel all inauspicious omens, light lamps and practice the Dao, and recite the true scriptures and divine incantations—whether for one seven-day period or two—submit memorials and petitions. The masters of healing must concentrate their minds, sever distracting thoughts, and focus their contemplation on the method. I shall dispatch the Eight Divisions of Prohibited Troops, the armies of the Five Directions’ Celestial Emperors, the twenty-eight constellations’ forces, the troops of the Five Lakes and Seven Marshes, and countless legions of cavalry. Arraying the armaments of the Three Armors, riding the qi of the Three Slaughters, they shall descend to the ritual arena, surround and protect as needed, sweep away demonic specters, sever and intercept evil spirits, rescue and deliver the living, and free them from ghostly afflictions. The master shall attain the opportunity to ascend to heaven; take care not to transgress lightly. Violations will be examined and punished for seven generations, and names will be recorded in the offices of the ghost officials. This is the sin of treating the method lightly and disrespecting the master without paying homage, the fault of failing to adhere to the statutes of the Dao."

The Seven Perfected said: "Those who wish to cultivate this method should establish a pure chamber within their home, one zhang square, with four doors. They should inscribe the true form of the Northern Emperor within the quiet room. Arrange nine lamps, with seven additional lamps, keeping them constantly lit and bright. Extinguish them by day and illuminate the room by night. Place one incense burner, two sand altars each four cun in size, a central incense censer, five bowls of pure water, and one sword, ensuring no impurity touches them. Before the pure chamber, construct the Altar of the Seven Origins, twelve chi in width and three chi in height, with three tiers. Through offerings and sacrifices, the Seven Great Demon Kings of Heaven shall constantly guard and protect it. Those who are not of like mind must not gaze upon the numinous altar."

The Seven Perfected said: "The qi of the essence of heaven and earth transforms into the Seven Qi, arrayed in the positions of the Seven Lodges. The Nine Qi form the Nine Luminaries, the Five Qi become the Five Stars, the Three Qi constitute the Three Origins, and the Eight Qi establish the Eight Numinous Spirits. The qi of the descending perfected is distributed and arranged as the qi of the True Kings, complementing the stars and constellations. All categories of living beings are governed by them, and they all preside over the registers of life and death. Later students of the Dao must specialize in one method, deliver and uplift the deluded laity, and free them from the demonic and mundane. All should arouse wholesome thoughts and may be ordained with talismans and registers. According to the ailment being treated, matters may be great or small. Subdue and restrain demonic spirits, and safeguard the clarity of the hun and po. Carry and wear silk talismans, keeping them constantly with you in all your comings and goings. The myriad spirits will transmit and receive them, escorting you wherever you go. Array the qi of the Seven Kings of the Origins and ride the essence of the Nine Origins. Those who wear them shall travel as great masters under heaven. Entering the homes of the afflicted, the myriad ghosts will tremble in fear. Evil spirits will vanish, lurking and hiding their traces. Their awe-inspiring power will be boundless, bringing fortune and aiding living beings, delivering and uplifting the souls of distant ancestors."

The Seven Perfected said: "If there are those in future generations who encounter this method, they may shift the stars and constellations, riding the qi of the Three and Five. They may pluck stars and move the Dipper, flying and pacing the Seven Origins. Ascending the guiding principles and driving the records, they may subdue and restrain evil demons, assist the state and aid in times of peril, sheltering and protecting the people. They may dispel calamities and disperse misfortunes, annihilating all monstrous evils. Practice in accordance with the method, and do not violate the statutes of the unseen. Offerings of faith should consist of the people’s property, all of which should be distributed to the poor and pitied, compassionately aiding those in distress. Act in accordance with the mysterious statutes. The unseen will assist the power of the Dao, and the yin soldiers will join in governance—there will be no ailment that is not cured."

The Seven Perfected say: Those of shallow learning among Daoist adepts who wish to heal the sick, subdue demonic spirits, and practice our wondrous methods must observe strict and rigorous statutes—difficult to uphold. Yet by aligning with the positions of the Seven Origins, kindling lamps and performing the Dao, prostrating and submitting vermilion memorials, their prayers may ascend to the Celestial Perfected. First, they must visit the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water, who preside over the registers of life and death. They must also invoke the Lords of the Three Palaces, Nine Bureaus, and One Hundred Twenty Offices of the Registers to absolve karmic forms and avert misfortune. First, they absolve the torments of deceased ancestors, then resolve the grievances of the afflicted, and only afterward proceed with treatment. They kindle seven lamps, bind them with hempen cords dyed in cinnabar, and connect them to the stellar net. They offer seven cups of wine, seven slices of dried meat, five burners of incense, and five bowls of pure water. Additionally, they establish a separate altar for the Five Earth True Officials, ensuring their attendants guard it so that no defiling influences may touch it. Within the lamps, they place a talisman, inscribing it in vermilion and immersing it in oil to summon the Celestial Perfected.

The Seven Perfected say: The Great Dao, in its compassion, bestows grace upon the people. Thus, it establishes the methods of prolonging life, opening the path of salvation for those of limited learning, that they may know the consequences of sin and blessing. Should a state or prefecture face peril—warfare, strife, or turmoil, with the realm in chaos—one may establish a Seven Origins altar of the Northern Dipper within the auspicious direction of the state’s fortune, within the palace gardens. There, they kindle lamps, perform the Dao, and submit memorials to suppress the nation’s calamities. They recite scriptures, chant incantations, visualize and regulate breath, perform the Dao thrice daily, and contemplate the true essence. They invoke the Heavenly Dragons that guard the state, the armies of the Five Emperors, the Celestial Officials of the Three Caverns, and a thousand chariots with ten thousand cavalry to array along the nation’s borders. They annihilate the aggressive forces, and all will naturally submit. The eight directions will be at peace, and the nation will enjoy great tranquility. When ruler and ministers employ the Dao, their virtue will flourish and support one another. They should establish a grand fast of the Northern Emperor’s divine incantations, performing the Dao for three days and two nights, five times daily, prostrating and submitting memorials. Above, they give thanks to the celestial might; below, they benefit the Five Earths. Thus, they harmonize Heaven and pacify Earth, safeguarding the state and securing the household, stabilizing the altars of soil and grain. All true spirits will attain the blessings of the Dao.

The Seven Perfected say: Among the people of the Lower Origin, if there are those afflicted by illness, suffering for months on end, their bodies wracked with pain—if their souls are tormented by the Water Official, the Earth Official reports their sins to the Heavenly Official, and their illness grows severe, with no cure in sight—then they should invite the True Masters of the Three Caverns to descend into their home and establish a ritual arena. For seven days and seven nights, thrice daily, they perform the Dao, recite divine incantations, and expel disasters and epidemics. We shall dispatch fierce celestial beasts and mighty spirits to protect the people. The Three Officials will absolve their sins, sending them directly to the Mysterious Capital. Their names will be erased from the Black Registers and inscribed in the Left Palace. After receiving this grace, they must offer thanksgiving rites to the Three Officials.

The Seven Perfected say: Among the people of the Lower Origin, if any are harassed by malevolent spirits or spectral entities, suffering from unrelenting illness year after year, they should invite the Daoist Masters of the Three Caverns to establish a quiet chamber. They kindle seven lamps and, after seven days, place the talismans of the Five Star Spirits to guard the five directions. They inscribe peachwood boards in vermilion, three inches wide and seventeen inches long. They take a green bamboo stalk seventeen feet long, bind it, and use it to kindle the lamps while performing the Dao. They chant incantations and employ various talismans. When worn or carried, these will invoke the True Spirits of the Five Peaks and the Divine Generals of the Four Waterways to constantly guard and protect them. The demonic entities will be forever eradicated, and the people will recover. After receiving this grace, they must offer thanksgiving rites to the Spirit Officials of the Five Peaks and the Four Waterways.

The Seven Perfected say: Among the people of the Lower Origin, if they newly construct a spirit abode and suffer harm from earthly qi, official misfortunes, or entanglements, with calamities arising in concert, they may invite the True Masters of the Three Caverns to enter their home and sweep clean a chamber. Aligning with the positions of the Seven Origins of the Northern Dipper, they kindle lamps and perform the Dao, prostrating to submit a petition absolving the Six Harms. They inscribe the memorial in vermilion on yellow silk and submit it to the Five Emperors, also giving thanks to the Five Stars. Thus, the Controller of Destinies will erase their names from the registers, the Earth Official will pardon their transgressions, illnesses will vanish, and both official and private misfortunes will be eradicated. After receiving this grace, they must offer thanksgiving rites to the Spirits of the Five Emperors, the Twelve Monthly Generals, and the Seven Constellation True Officials. They should inscribe the Seven Treasures Divine Talisman on catalpa wood boards, two feet and four inches long, and hang them at the four corners of the home. They encircle the home with the Dipper’s mouth, following the established methods of sealing the abode. The unseen prohibitions are strict; those of shallow learning must not violate these mysterious statutes, lest they bring ruin to nine generations and be eternally enslaved among the ghostly officials.

The Seven Perfected say: We reside in the Northern Culmen of the Seven Origins’ celestial positions, ever attended by canopies of splendor, with the Emperor dwelling at the center. These stars are born of the Seven Treasures, their radiance resplendent, and are called the Supreme Tenuity Northern Culmen Emperor Lord. On the third and twenty-seventh days of each month, we descend to the mortal realm to receive offerings and sacrifices. We observe the good and evil of the people, their cultivation and transgressions, and the length of their lifespans. On these nights, one may set up a ritual mat in the central courtyard, arranging nine portions of spirit money and horses, fine delicacies, exquisite offerings, wine, dried meat, and incense to present in supplication. They may seek deliverance from disasters and misfortunes, prolong life, and increase their allotted years. They may request the methods of the Dao to save and aid the people, to seek vows for subduing evil, and the methods for interrogating ghosts and annihilating spectral entities. On these nights, before retiring, they should first visualize the Nine Stars of the Canopy above their head, with the Northern Dipper to the left, the Northern Dipper to the right, the Northern Dipper above, the Northern Dipper below, and the Three Terraces covering the center. In the eastern part of the bedchamber, they visualize the True Officials of the Twenty-Eight Constellations in the form of infants, clad in brocade skirts and purple gauze capes, holding green tablets. They exhale the royal qi, which enters the practitioner’s mouth, transforming entirely into true qi and filling their body. After attaining this method, they become a master who commands spirits and may serve as an enlightened teacher to the world. All ghosts will fear them, and wherever they go, they will subdue and command. Mountain spirits, ferocious beasts, mountain specters, and wild demons will all be eradicated. This true scripture and precious secret is transmitted to only one person every forty thousand kalpas. If a true person transmits this method, they must use forty feet of white silk, gold coins as a token of sincerity, rice, flour, incense, and oil as offerings for the ritual.

Should this method be transmitted to one person, yet no perfected being is found, a copy may be inscribed and cast into the great mountains or deep marshes. Inscribe upon it the sealed taboo-name, and one shall attain longevity. The Earth Officials shall raise it, the name engraved upon golden tablets, the words and resonance preserved—then the ten thousand spirits will attend and guard, and the true Dao shall be immediately revealed.

The Seven Perfected say: Those who wish to cultivate and study this Dao must be diligent, steadfast, and devoted to this single method. They must not begrudge worldly wealth but instead practice hidden virtue and almsgiving. Following the ritual codes in prayers and offerings, all matters shall be answered. Yet this is not merely for warding off the afflictions of ghosts and spirits—beware of carelessly revealing it to the unworthy, lest calamity engulf the nine generations, for the netherworld’s prohibitions are not trifling, and the talismans are not to be treated lightly.

The Seven Perfected say: Those who wish to heal the sick and save others by investigating the methods of ghosts must first visualize their root master. Next, they must visualize the Three Primordial Great Generals, leading ninety million cavalry, with three masters and eighty thousand troops. Then, they must visualize the Great Emperor of the North, leading five hundred million soldiers, all clad in black, descending into the ritual space. Next, they must visualize the Seven Primordial Perfected Officials, each wearing seven-jeweled crowns, adorned in brocade and resplendent garments, holding seven-jeweled divine talismans, descending into the ritual space. Lamps are then lit, and talismans are placed within the lamp bowls. Two more talismans are inscribed and posted at the two sides of the ritual gate.

The next day, spirits are summoned, and the Perfected descend—this is the method of driving and circling the stars, and nothing lies beyond it. The primordial essence and true qi coalesce naturally, all converging at the Phoenix Pavilion of the Great Mystery’s Northern Gate, called the *Talisman of Yin’s Broad Numinosity*. The descent of the Seven Perfected is named the *Talisman of Longevity*. The divine emerges from the Dark Palace, the Northern Sea’s Cliff of Ultimate Mystery, the Yin-Shuo-Shan Realm, the Terrace of the Five Dragons, and the Southern Veranda—untransmitted elsewhere. Those lower immortals who obtain it become Perfected of the Five Peaks, freely roaming the Three Realms, ascending to the heavens in broad daylight.

The First Primordial Essence Perfected, the White-Robed Lord of the Lesser Existence Heaven, imparts the *Jade Instructions and Numinous Sounds*, encountered but once in three thousand years. After inscribing these seven talismans and invoking the descent of the Seven Perfected to their positions, the talismans are then deployed to seal the qi, from one to seven, without allowing defilement, impurity, or exposure to the uninitiated. These talismans, when used in the ritual space, are placed within a basin. Spirits are summoned, the Perfected descend, and the ten thousand impurities are dispelled. Thus concludes the *Scripture of the Seven Primordials of the Vast Release*, as expounded by the Northern Emperor.
