**The Supreme Clarity Highest Sage, Most High Lord of the Great Dao, *Dongzhen Jin Yuan Eight Radiant Jade Register***

**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Highest Sage, Most High Lord of the Great Dao’s Dongzhen Jin Yuan Eight Radiant Jade Register* (abbreviated as *Dongzhen Jin Yuan Eight Radiant Jade Register*).

Author unknown, approximately dating to the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity tradition. Originally one scroll, later erroneously divided into two. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, Orthodox Section, Part One.

---

The Eastern Flower Supreme Immortal calls it the *Eight Hidden Writings of Supreme Simplicity*; the Southern Flower Supreme Immortal calls it the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*; the Western Flower Supreme Immortal calls it the *Golden True Jade Radiance Illuminating Heaven’s Cavern-Observing Jade Scripture*; the Northern Flower Supreme Immortal calls it the *Desolate Nine Luminaries, Expansive Seven Mysteries Upper Scripture*; the Supreme Immortal of the Jade Emperor’s Central Flower calls it the *Most High Sage’s Eight Radiant Jade Register*.

The Central Yellow Elder Lord and the Southern Pole Primordial Lady concealed and recorded these two scriptures within the Jade Simplicity’s Jasper Terrace and the Mystic Cloud Feather Chamber, sealing them in a fragrant, dense casket with the jade seals of the Three Primes of Jade Clarity. They then commanded seven hundred Jade Maidens of the Northern Frigid Golden Terrace and seven hundred Jade Lads of the Western Numinous Jade Palace of White Emptiness to attend and guard the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern* and the *Jade Register of the Great Concealment of the Most High’s Void-Born* therein.

The Supreme Clarity Highest Sage, Most High Lord of the Great Dao, was the essence of the Two Dawns’ *qi*, the purple mist of auspicious clouds, his jade radiance blazing, golden reflections streaming with truth. Congealing transformation, embracing refinement, he enfolded the mysterious spirit, entrusted to a mother’s womb, and took human form. His taboo name was [obscured], his style *Shang Kai*. His primordial mother carried him for three thousand seven hundred years before he was born beside the Crimson Mystery Slope of the Floating Mount Luo in the Western Heaven’s Yu Cha Mountain.

His primordial oversight shone at the first dawn; the Eight Caverns spread through the Great Beginning. Surveying the nine wefts of the cosmos, he descended to the sweet springs of the Li River. Roaming freely to nurture life, he gathered truth and consumed essence. Soaring in mystery, spreading his plumes, he rinsed and sipped from the Great Clarity. Receiving the register from the Purple Emperor, he was appointed to govern the Highest Immortals. Stirring the vermilion winds, he convened the ten thousand spirits. The dark abyss and towering peaks resounded with the great sound’s boundless fragrance. Yearning for the jade truth of the void’s rosy clouds and the numinous dawn of Supreme Clarity, he then cast aside worldly thoughts, trod the void, and dwelled in truth. Plunging the vermilion jade tablet into the depths, he doffed his cap of the Nine Heavens. Gazing upon the bright hills and mountains, he traversed the myriad peaks of the caverns. His spirit grasped the Five Luminaries; his form coiled with the Seven Origins. Moved by the essence of the Great Stillness, he yearned to summon the Mystic Clarity. Thus, his vast radiance stilled its brilliance; flying pearls bathed his spirit. Hidden mushrooms formed their splendor; night-born jewel lights arose. At dawn, he explored the flowery morning, consuming the morning’s supreme essence. Riding clouds and descending mists, the Eight Ways blazed with light. Divine lightning whirled in the winds; green *qi* shrouded the depths. His vast gaze spanned the Eight Vastnesses; the Nine Origins encircled him. Ascending the purple steps again, thrice flying through the jasper towers, four times attending the Great Simplicity, five times feasting in the gem chambers, he grasped the Five Elders, plumbing the caverns’ utmost mysteries. The Highest Lord of the Heavens, none who did not tread this path.

His wisdom flowed through the jade chapters; he savored the subtle flavors. Lingering in the hidden void, he turned toward the drifting, ethereal clouds. His form sank into the Eight Mysteries; his light concealed the ten thousand sources. Vast and boundless, profoundly penetrating, each strand of rosy clouds soared. His spirit’s refinement awakened outwardly; his *qi* suffused the tranquil realms. In harmony with the great transformation, he roamed the vastness of the original void. The great emptiness bore his intent; form dissolved with the passing hues. The pure wind filled the peaks; his tranquil mechanism governed joy. Heaven’s sounds rang clear; the lofty path was deep and distant. His mysterious heart filled with rare resonance; his soaring brush flourished amid auspicious mists. The dragon lurked in a single surge; the phoenix’s grace spread faintly. Thus, he embraced the Four Greats, encompassing the weak and lost. Thereupon, he received the scriptures of Jade Emptiness, gazing upon the scenes of Supreme Clarity, and was enthroned as the Most High Sage, Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao. He governed the Palace of the Elixir Pearl Sun, dwelling in the Sevenfold Radiance Purple Chamber. Three hundred thousand jade lads and maidens attended him, dispersing incense.

He wore a robe of nine-colored parted silk and a gown of flying frost-pearls. His cap changed a hundred times in an instant; his belt bore the Morning Light Sun Bell and the Sword of Nurtured Essence. His dominion extended infinitely, serving the Void Emperor. At times, he transformed repeatedly with the constant flow, entering the mists with the wind. Stirring the Three Ways, he gazed below upon the Eight Beyonds. Ascending the hills and mounds, he staffed the myriad lands. The mysterious chant resounded in four directions. Leading and uplifting with grand intent, his roc’s wings brushed the Eight Supports. Harmonious sounds flowed and gathered; he entrusted the melody to the clouds and rosy clouds above. Briefly releasing his distant, subtle elegance, he gazed down upon the vast earth, advancing ever onward.

To resolve doubts and illuminate delusions, to revere the numinous virtue’s model: he illuminated dragon patterns in the azure abyss, blazed with rosy clouds over rivers and marshes. He bathed his heavenly countenance in orchid jade, emitted golden essence from secluded valleys. Riding the Great Compliance to govern the supreme images, roaming the mysterious spirit to blend the Five Impurities, he stilled the Nine Falls without wearying his feet. Congealing his form in the center, he upheld honor and disgrace—such was the Most High’s subtle teaching.

As for his delighting in dwelling in numinous observances, feasting in the Seven Awakenings, his mechanism’s edge swift as the wind’s tip, plumbing the spirit’s utmost mysteries: his vast pattern swirled and stilled, his emptiness shifted through hidden realms. The spirit’s waves were rare and silent; the Nine Sounds hung in suspension. Having forgotten the mysterious stillness, he lodged in the flowery garden. Brightly shining, the dharma’s standard; clearly luminous, his merits complete. Subtly arousing the profound principle, his doors opened to the myriad thousands. Dancing scenes fanned the void; riding emptiness, he embraced the mist. Coiling through the Seven Records, he ascended the register’s summit. Numinous talismans blazed and scattered; hidden chapters unfolded. Encompassing the sunken and obscure, he turned the stagnant wheel, weaving together the Five Images, leading the hosts of heaven—such was the Most High’s transformative governance, by which he oversaw the multitudes.

As for dispersing teachings to nurture form and hastening to rescue the spirit’s *qi*: he clearly established the Three Palaces, the solitary peace of the profound spirit. The Two Compliances were vast and bright; the Primordial Harmony gathered in joy. Casting aside杂念, forgetting burdens and relinquishing externals, he traversed the hidden void, accumulating mysteries to achieve greatness. Exhaling the old, receiving the new, he gathered essence and expelled filth. Dispelling the tangled thoughts of deviant intentions, he treasured the preciousness of true uprightness. Rinsing the morning’s splendor to summon the Sun Emperor, he drew in the night’s brightness to embrace the Moon Pearl.

Amidst the vast expanse, Yu Yi’s horizontal traverse ignites the radiance of Supreme Non-Being; entwined jade brilliance inhales the dawn, as twin luminaries conjoin in their celestial sojourn. Flying zhi-mushrooms unfurl their dark petals, their numinous essence cloaking the mountain peaks; phoenix brains beat their wings upon the golden calendar, while scaled spirits prick their ears to rouse their forms. Night’s glow illumines the Five Peaks, its resplendent tendrils trailing to weave blossoms. Hidden dragons cry amidst the clouds, and jade fruits rise in startled encounter.

Then do spirit melons spread across the fields, purple stalks flourish on mist-laden mounds; cinnabar scatters in a thousand unions, jade clusters hang dense upon the cliffs. Treading the Seven Origins, one ascends the void to ride the floating clouds. In the west, the Numinous One offers vast nectar; in the east, vermilion libations are established. Drinking deeply of cinnabar jade-essence may transform the Nine Mysteries; savoring tiger froth suffices to encircle the decaying husk.

Behold the Four Petals of Purple Nectar, the Three Flowers of Dark Perfection: azure vases float with zhi-mushrooms, dark branches gleam with langgan jade. Pristine abundance fills the void, crimson blooms with fivefold splendor. Drawing from the dark channel’s sweet dew, one alters white-haired age to youthful prime.

Should one ascend the towering peaks, the vast harmony of heaven and earth unfolds; nurturing the radiant, delicate silk, the divine branches unfurl their luminous fans. At dawn, ethereal herbs flourish; at dusk, cinnabar orchids fall through the forest. Spreading numinous majesty, the cliffs stand empty, wreathed in drifting mist. Offering fragrant incense in the valley, presenting blossoms and aromatic essences, one congeals form in purple and azure, crimson clouds and golden boughs. The dazzling essence gathers at the root, as Mount Taihua exhales and inhales. Seven darknesses and six blessings wield wisdom’s eight liberations; dwelling in subtle clarity, one soars afar with effortless grace. Cutting off the mind’s dark stillness, calming its rhythms, one turns back the infant’s bondage.

Thereupon, settled awareness engenders trust; luminous order aligns with the equal. Jade perfected ones greet the dawn, bathing upon the numinous mound. Pure guests ascend in audience; with focused mind, they open to joy. The flourishing Three Passes pair with the luminous shadows, weaving in harmony. The inner resonance of profound stillness embraces the lofty and gentle song. Wielding the banner, they summon the immortals; refining the spirit, they tread the primal. Traversing the Nine Heavens in stately array, the Seven Sages ascend the ladder, their noble bearing a standard. With the bright model established, they govern the Four Floatings in unison.

Then, in tranquil chant within the jade hall, one delights in the Great Possession. A numinous breeze scatters the light; six clouds arise at the window. Leisurely at the zenith of dawn, gazing down upon the lofty mounds, the myriad valleys stretch desolate, reins gathered over the empty fields. Casting the wheel into the numinous ford, flying beasts howl in procession; divine lads flank the canopy as the Western Flower feasts upon stone. Fragrant mists coil about the lapels; aromatic vapors arise from the vast and solitary mountain vessels. Gold hides within jade thickets; the Five Symbols and Eight Vastnesses settle their luminous union. Roaming to observe the hidden mysteries, one thus attains enduring permanence.

At times, one unbinds the sash to the myriad streams, sun’s journey and moon’s revolution their companions. Summoning the wind to fan the wings, one drifts through ninefold transformations. Bright clouds mirror the radiance; profound darkness enfolds the profound. The cloud chamber contains the luminous; gathering the true, one orders the principles within. In the secluded abode of the abstruse, the spirit pervades the void’s expanse. Inner radiance reflects within; the Three Palaces remain pure and fresh. A thousand ailments do not arise—thus is there constant healing.

Then, brandishing the staff through the Seven Gardens, raising the azure banner with vermilion tassels, one soars through the void, dancing the pennants, driving the light to race the whirlwind. Lingering amidst the eight mists, circling the empty paths, one pins the sun’s splendor to the hair, gathers the moon’s fallen pearls. Plucking the langgan fruits from the crimson grove, feeding upon the purple lotuses of the Dark River, one reclines in the numinous carriage, governing the imperial scriptures. Myriad spirits enter to pay homage; the Five Powers grasp the talismans. Supreme perfected ones attend the dawn; the Heavenly Sovereign embraces the charts. The Four Supreme Ones proclaim the decrees; the Central Scroll establishes the model. The Six Records flow to fullness; refining the *qi*, one embraces the void.

Thereupon, gazing into the void and lifting one’s voice, one chants and declares: If you wish to become a perfected one, you must meditate upon the Lord Within the Sun, driving dragons and phoenixes to harness the celestial radiance and clouds. Journey east to the Sparse Grove, then enter the Emperor’s Gate. If you must ascend to heaven, contemplate the Lady Within the Moon, driving ten flying dragons to harness my flowing essence. Journey west to the Six Ridges, then proceed to the Emperor’s Hall. With focused root and moving thought, ascend to pay court to the Jade Sovereign. The verdant expanse of Yu Yi treads the light; the scattered brilliance of Jie Lin reaches the dawn. The Nine Latitudes cast their traverse; the Seven Symbols flash like lightning through the dark. Numinous winds intermingle in their drumming; the Two Dawns and Eight Paths gallop in purity to attend the court. Three clouds blaze with splendor at the northern pole; ten thousand dragons gallop and sing in chorus. The Eastern Peng beats the rhythm; purple blossoms unfurl their petals. Soaring high, the round essence unites; the luminous void brings carefree wandering. The Twin Sovereigns join their chariots, outpacing heaven in their flight.

Then, the hidden and the manifest merge in ease; spirit and *qi* dissolve into equilibrium. Numinous guests stand in solemn array, parting the jade courtyard’s pristine expanse. In the left hand, the dragon talisman; in the right, the tiger scripture. Eight winds pierce the void; their resonance flows through the Five Cities. Dark and yellow brilliance scatters, dense as a net of stars. The Three Treasures intermingle their fans; treading the grand, one searches for jade. The lofty ancestor plucks the blossoms; clanging, the jade rings resound. Dark tones continue to rise; the golden root’s langgan chimes. Simurghs dance upon the cloud pools; flying phoenixes sing their melodies. Purple cassia and orchids revolve, encircling the void and the numinous. Leaping through the great auroras, their radiance illumines the Supreme Clarity. The dragon’s path unleashes the whirlwind, startling the Eight Luminaries. Accumulating kalpas upon kalpas, one preserves this benefit and integrity.

At times, the teachings transform and divide the Dao, borrowing names to shift forms. The Six-and-One restrains the unformed; dark clouds nurture completion. Flying cinnabar, water jade, leaping through snow and frost, the numinous blossoms shoot forth in eight directions; purple wanderings traverse the nine expanses. Lingering in chaotic turns, veiled in the Three Yellows, crimson essences transmute the spirit; the Nine Jades emit their rays. Langgan jade transforms a hundredfold; azure reflections mirror the waters and sunlight. Eight jades take flight in the radiance; elegant stamens yield green nectar. At dawn’s curve, one rides the dawn; flowing gold and moonlit brightness. Dark ford and jade libation, numinous reflections of the Five Lords. Light discards its resonance; one chant summons eight unfoldings. Waves like fire essence, Yi and Li’s jade ginger, golden *qi* at the hundred convergences. Relics bind the fragrance; luxuriant, the numinous treasure transforms the literary patterns. Once the knife and measure are arrayed, longevity becomes immeasurable—truly the rare medicine of the true origin, the secret treasure of the Supreme Emperor.

Or refining the five clouds and jade blossoms, one ingests the numinous gold’s purity. Vermilion souls and green lotuses, lush blossoms and azure essence, southern candles and kingfisher-green *□*, cinnabar sand and empty azure. At dawn, one gathers the Five Dawns’ jade pool and pristine nectar—this too can reverse the old and restore the new, transforming age to regain infancy.

Thus, the Four *Qi* harmonize their movements; the Eight Winds fan the void. Gazing in leisure upon the purple groves, one shakes the robes at the nine corners. Fusang flourishes in lushness; the Jianmu dances upon the mound. Myriad perfected ones circle in procession, dipping their wings in the azure streams. A hundred grasses knot their branches; the Five Blossoms radiate their splendor. Ming pods sprout at dusk, floating in rhythmic accord.

Should one ascend the fast and enter the chamber, first expel and dispel to ward off demonic afflictions, then guard against all trials. Only then, with eyes closed and inward gaze, press the heart and invoke, facing north to strike the teeth thirty-six times. Whisper to the Jade Clarity’s Radiant Primordial Sovereign:

"The Six Heavens’ Great Demon Kings, bound in the dark and desolate void,
Giant beasts of crimson armor, four-throated venomous dragons,
White eagles shrieking aloft, claws brandished and bristles raised—
All myriad spirits lurk in concealment, vanquishing evil and shattering demons.
Let the Heavenly Soldiers’ wrath arise, the Five Peaks bow in audience,
Wind and fire launch their campaign, the Nine Heavens fan their radiance."

Thereupon, bolt the gates and seal the vision, refine the spirit and guard the essence. Harmonize the Three Palaces, meditate upon the Heavenly Court. The Thearch holds his banquet; his ministers and aides illumine all. Harmonizing the qi-fluid, one pays homage to the Nine Numinous Ones. The Five Spirits settle in turn; the spring’s source flows full. White Prime unfolds the true, Flourishing Hero spreads its life. The cavern’s light shines in concealment; the Four Powers attain balance. Inner treasures knot their radiance; one sings the Cavern’s purity and plays in clarity. The Great Simplicity arrays its charts—longevity shall not falter.

At times, one gazes broadly into the vast emptiness, the clamor fading beyond the Milky Way. Riding the wind, one shakes the reins at the dawn’s edge by the azure shore. The heart unfolds across the Eight Wilds; the spirit alone beams in splendor. Ascending the numinous terrace of Emerald Waters, one gazes upon the Purple Mansion of the Azure Isle. Vast and distant, rosy clouds scatter like mist, trailing vapors carve the skies. Veils of radiance shimmer and blaze. Glancing at paired reflections, a myriad dawns flicker in an instant. Ethereal tones race and intertwine; the Dark Wind joins in praise. The Primordial fans its might; the sun’s glory blazes. One roams the celestial vastness—thus is eternal feasting achieved.

Should one gather jade from the Dark Mound or pluck mushrooms from the Jade Garden, the lofty perfected ones, towering Celestial Worthies, their jade blossoms winging the light, golden truths encircling their chariots, crimson waves surging from the peaks, the heart leaping in harmonious freshness—then, with hands plucking the Seven Luminaries and stilling the Eight Gates, one floats upon the Gourd River and treads the peaks beyond mountains. Leading and ordering the highest concord, chewing and savoring the profound mystery, grasping the ritual implements, embracing essence and containing spirit, one soars aloft, borne by the wind, following the new. Vast and resplendent in virtue’s pattern, the hidden blossom unfolds in wholeness—thus accumulating the cedar’s age in long contemplation, ever preserving the flow of benefit.

At times, amidst verdant groves and towering cliffs, where idle light knots the mounds, one wanders in dark enlightenment, observing the transformations of the Jade Void. Ten thousand measures are not real; the root-substance lies in nothingness. Divine maidens unfurl their talismans as the divine chariot whirls in the gale. Feathered skirts pool in the heavens; kingfisher capes spread in shade. Chanting high to the Jade Clarity, one expounds the origins of the primordial. The Grand Tenuity attends the banquet; the Five Sovereigns illumine the pivot. The cavern’s mechanism declares the obscure; the supreme image unites the distinct. Jade lads pluck the *ao*-zither; the Northern Flower unveils the zither. Heavenly maidens array themselves in ranks, a hundred hundred in perfect alignment. The Dark Harmony sounds in fourfold resonance; a thousand tones chime and scatter. Purple phoenixes preen their wings, rinsing their flutes in unison. Cloud phoenixes advance in staggered flight, beaks poised to sing. Divine feathered skirts call out; flying chimes raise their *zheng* and *shang* notes. Azure dragons roar aloft; clustered clouds rise in thickets. Divine tigers roar in fury; the Eight Winds fan the courtyard. Bronze is struck and jade shattered; bells are tapped and chimes clapped. Vermilion mists surge in billows; the Three Simplicities—green and azure—glow. Round essences slumber in radiance; flying rosy clouds gaze into darkness. Then the Supreme Thearch descends from his seat, scattering his spirit and releasing his numen. Gazing upon the celestial talismans, luminous and resplendent, he points left to the Southern Chamber and right to the Literary Prosperity. Advancing toward the wondrous and lush, meeting the rhythm in harmonious flight, he wanders the morning’s depths, pacing the azure waves. Qi courses through the secluded halls; □ brushes the void. Banners are raised and standards halted; flags are grasped to summon the light. Lingering in inward chant, heart harmonized and soul at ease, the gaze encompassing all—one attainment endures forever.

Thereupon, each sings the wondrous subtleties, discoursing on the primal principles of the numinous. Jade echoes resound across the Eight Directions; golden tones shake the courtyard. The Great Simplicity is unfolded; the hidden and obscure are guided forth. Myriad embellishments flourish in profusion; whispered words continue to appear. Radiant branches scatter in abundance, the essence of utmost subtlety. Encountering the towering and dense in throngs, branching and entangled in scattered glory, one surpasses the southern glow of the Gate of Heaven, or seems to circle the red blossoms’ beams. Flowing light gathers in lushness; flying mists billow in haze. The Nine Hues shine upon the Thearch’s chart; the Purple Void’s harmony is sung in resonance. Broad hearing attends the jumbled sounds at the Jade Terrace; stones are struck and waters boil in the Golden Hall. Five Clouds coil the canopy; Eight Simplicities illumine the chapters. Summoning the sun and moon’s lofty essence, commanding the Seven Lodgings’ numinous net, grasping the tally to pace the Six Heavens, brandishing the vermilion cords in blazing splendor, dancing the Ten Absolutes beneath the Northern Candle, waving the flowered banners in the White Void—riding the divine wind to gaze upon the Eight Sceneries, what need has one for the Nine Phoenixes or Eight Wolves? The green canopy dances in distant leaps; the crimson standards flutter in reverse ascent. Nine reins in one accord, treading the clouds of heaven in galloping flight. Plucking the azure cinnabar’s curling petals, scattering the flying blossoms’ returning fragrance, suspending the five-fold refined pear to soften the waters, the Nine Jade Gems merge in cavernous harmony to form jade. Fire-rubies yield pearls; flowing gold gathers radiant jade. Turning toward the Northern Ridge of the Curved Array, one scatters the stars of the dawn’s farthest reaches. Grasping the wheel of the vast emptiness, one circulates the qi in campaign. Towering and profound, the true and mysterious—laws and constants are fulfilled. Aligning with the highest concord, how could one’s destiny ever falter?

Should the primal stillness wander the marsh, subtle tones stirring clarity, one grasps and savors the Three Wisdoms, reflecting and embracing the Yellow Tranquility. Vast is the sagely mystery; subtle the dark script. The cavern arises from non-being; the empty and idle unfurl their banners. Firmly grasping the spirit’s court, entwining the numinous pass, the outer barbarians of the Four Mirrors—treasures lie in the Six Origins. Radiant and resplendent, jade virtue’s form and vessel suddenly extend. This may be called warmth and harmony in ten thousand patterns, guiding the reins to steer the round.

As evening’s twilight settles, one completes the Eight Transformations. Embracing life in pure tranquility, the spirit’s traces stretch into the distant. Gracefully unfolding the principles of transformation, plumbing the obscure to the utmost, one’s wondrous workings and marvelous subtleties lodge in the flowing brush. Dragon blossoms gleam in embroidered clouds; the Five Radiance’s hidden leaps dance in the great rosy clouds. Cinnabar light flashes like lightning; the Scenery Wind fans harmony. A lofty gathering in the Upper Palace, floating waves upon the empty waves—vast and distant, the dark and true bathe their qi in the Jade River. Shaking and draping the Eight Paths, fragrance flows through the celestial ridges. Thus is jade ordered, daily renewed without abiding. Therefore, accumulating kalpas of numinous layers, there shall be no end thereafter.

Herein lies the method of refining the soul and restraining the poised spirit, of congealing the spirit within the womb—though it unfolds in but a few dozen words, it can settle the body and unite with the Dao, scattering all demonic hosts. This is the supreme incantation of the celestial realms, the esoteric revelation of the Mystic North beneath the Dragon Candle. Its purport cannot be expounded, its layered phrases cannot be translated; whether the cries of birds or beasts, the entwining winds or descending clouds, the hidden chants of the Nine Heavens—none can be fully interpreted.

Should one briefly gather the wondrous brushstrokes, drawing qi into the cavernous abode, encompassing the Nine Nether realms and expanding the inner resonance of the obscure melody, then the jade tones and golden currents may be bestowed upon the southern portal. On the day of one’s original destiny, or in a place where the heart trembles, one seals the passes and concentrates the essence, striking the teeth thrice, settling the qi and regulating the breath. Facing north with upright posture, the heart holds these subtle words:

*"Luole Nahuan, Fangnai Elian, Banmu Bosui, Danhan Jushe,
Chicha Baixiang, Danli Damo, Zhenyun Guangfu, Xuling Zhixiao,
Zonglan Jixiong, Fadong Changyou, Wumian Zhongpin, Lingkuo Fantiao,
Baifang Qiantu, Moni Huoliao, Tiandi Qidu, Shu yun neng diao?"*

Thus concludes the invocation. To resolve myriad obstructions, sever stubborn doubts, harmonize sounds with rhythm, and manifest the Four Radiance in brilliance—where celestial luminaries shift and gleam without transmission or teacher—the Eight Winds revolve and dissolve. The Heavenly Emperor then proclaims:

*"Luolai Xiuguang, Yuxu Sisi, Jishu Batan, Bingandingwei,
Yousheng Wuying, Xuanjing Zhisi, Youhuo Jidong, Wufei Wochi,
Hunxing Tongcai, Yan neng jizhi?
Jiayan Hanjin, Zuoqi Dayi, Erchang Yuewu, Sanhe Wuli,
Daluo Liuhui, Kongtong Jiuzhuan, Qiqing Chengguang, Siyuan Qianquan,
Tishen Wangjue, Wanlü Feijin, Huawen Kongsi, Yulang Zazhen,
Yinyun Chongxuan, Miaonei Lunyun, Qiji Dongbiao, Mingxin Yuannin,
Xichen Lu’an, Yuanzong Guidai, Renxing Toukong, Zaoshen Neiwai,
Mingmo Miaopian, Ziran Gaohui, Chongling Dujing, Huihui Yuantai,
Silü Shouqi, Yunze Xiuyong, Jiuguan Yuanyuan, Xin yi huojing,

Dahui Yishi, Yutian Tongxiu, Wanshi Baixiang, Moneng Huiyu."*

When true subtleties and numinous verses arise without bound, in the indistinct and wondrous caverns, gazing loftily upon the circular realm—seizing this divine resonance, all categories dissolve into nothingness. With awe, one ascends the heavens, fragrance wafting and flourishing. Looking up, one grasps the celestial measures in the remotest spaces; looking down, one rescues the myriad harmonies from feeble decay. The Four Wheels radiate splendor, the true origin drifts and shifts; the Great Marshal holds the helm, grasping the register of luminous scriptures. Riding the whirlwind and spurring the light, dragons soar through the Nine Heavens. The dharma drum resounds through the caverns, the luminous disk gleams resplendent. The Vermilion Emperor of the Southern Palace shines forth, floating the Seven Canopies upon the Jade Ford. Fanning and casting feathered banners, one lingers by the numinous source. Green clouds trail the standards, the northern winds stir the throng. Flowing bells and arrayed arrows, the Whirlwind Sovereign’s pennants arise. Guiding the myriad transformations, they respond to the rhythm and fan the mist. The Vermilion Tiger flanks the light, the Poison Dragon wings the chariot, awaiting the missteps of the malevolent and overawing the great villains of the Six Heavens. Evil is inevitably punished, good inevitably preserved. A thousand demons bow their heads, mountain spirits tear themselves apart. Echoes drift through the Great Void, the Two Effulgences gleam and scatter their brilliance.

Then, roaming among the myriad beings, one’s form drifts through ten thousand dawns. Above, one ascends the Jade Empyrean; below, one reaches the furthest dispersals. Assuming temporary forms, a thousand arts display their wonders; bestowing blessings upon the multitudes, each regains their former state. From the highest to the lowest, the black-haired masses open and encompass the primordial life. Names are inscribed in the registers, spirits are measured and essences probed. Those who can apply this method ascend to the Upper Clarity, chanting the mysteries of the Cavernous Origin. Emerging from obscurity and entering darkness, one compiles the *Supreme Scripture of the Eight Effulgences of Jade*, revealing the marvels of the Perfected Ones and illuminating the wisdom of the Emperor. Having obtained this scripture, you are titled the Left Minister of Primordial Effulgence. Cultivating the Cavernous Dao, you become the Left Duke of the Upper Clarity, circling the Three Primes and roaming the Purple Empyrean.

To govern the multitudes is to embrace and guide the myriad streams, to regulate the movements of the ten thousand things, to survey the vast emptiness and illuminate the Eight Beyonds. One exhausts the revered foundations of the Empty Same and encounters the ultimate luxuriance of the Mystic Radiance. Clouds converge at distant shores, winds traverse the gathering mists—rarely does one attain such lofty tranquility amidst the rosy clouds, pointing to the refined governance of the Two Modes.

How could one remain silent in the Three Clarities, allowing the Six Qi to drift aimlessly? Thus, one binds the heart to the level observation, brightening the spirit across the Ten Peaks. Thereupon, the Eight Emperors are commanded, and the myriad spirits are summoned. The yin armor of the water sources is notified, the guardian lords of the Five Emperors are called forth. Rivers and seas are arrayed in solemnity, the thousand Perfected turn the Wheel of Principle. The fire armor sharpens its edge, the Heavenly Soldiers wield their axes. Mountains and peaks open their paths, the sun and moon illuminate the dawn.

Then, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sets forth to wander the Nine Empyreans, gazing upon the spirits of the outer heavens, gathering the hidden verses from the Jade Void, seeking the concealed talismans from the Purple Emperor, and illuminating the Eight Directions to thoroughly penetrate all regions. Thereupon, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao first mounts the chariot of a single effulgence, driving the Eight Primes of Purple Clouds. He summons the Subtle Emperor of the Vast Granary, named Luzi of the Abundant Register, and together they journey eastward to the Jade Terrace of the Heaven of Joyous Forests, where they behold the Supreme Lord of the Jade Clarity and the Purple Dao, the Empty Sovereign, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Nine Radiance of the Great Dawn.

Then the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of twofold effulgence, driving the Seven Primes of Crimson Clouds. He summons the Subtle Emperor of the Central Vermilion, named Ding Wuyan, and together they journey southward to the Lofty Peach and Fierce Surge Dragon Net Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Winged Sun Empty Sovereign, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Contemplation of the Numinous Origin of the Dawn.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of threefold effulgence, driving the Six Primes of Red Clouds. He summons the Purple Tenuity White Emperor, named Qu Yuanshi, and together they journey westward to the Azure Fall and Empty Song Jade Pear Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Prosperous Yang Origin Empty Sovereign, the Lofty Primordial Lord, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Nine Poles of the Grand Dawn.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of fourfold effulgence, driving the Five Primes of Azure Clouds. He summons the Mysterious Tenuity Black Emperor, named Qi Yuanxuan, and together they journey northward to the Vast Desert and Towering Obscurity Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Sevenfold Stillness Life-Guiding Lofty Supreme Empty Sovereign Lord and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Overlapping Radiance and Rotating Root.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of fivefold effulgence, driving the Four Primes of Yellow Clouds. He summons the Primordial Tenuity Supreme Emperor, named Jie Kongzi, and together they journey northeastward to the Supporting Blade and Canopy Flower-Floating Net Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Supreme Brilliance Empty Sovereign, the Cavernous Clarity Lord, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Mysterious Effulgence of the Level Dawn.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of sixfold effulgence, driving the Three Primes of Green Clouds. He summons the Numinous Tenuity Central Emperor, named Bing Juwen, and together they journey southeastward to the Possessing Flourishing and Initial Silence Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Primordial Origin Empty Sovereign, the Supreme Empyrean Lord, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Converging Radiance of the Dawn Mandate.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of sevenfold effulgence, driving the Two Primes of Purple Clouds. He summons the Proclaiming Tenuity Lower Emperor, whose lord is named Hong Fuzi, and together they journey southwestward to the Surging Harmony and Nurturing Separation Sand Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Sevenfold Contemplation Non-Birth Empty Sovereign, the Golden Numinous Lord, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Aligned Radiance of the Mysterious Dawn.

Next, the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the chariot of eightfold effulgence, driving the One Prime of Numinous Clouds. He summons the Cavernous Tenuity True Emperor, named Si Chengshu, and together they journey northwestward to the Solitary Green and Scrutinizing Treasure Wheel Dharma Heaven, where they behold the Jade Clarity Eightfold Contemplation Lofty Primordial Empty Sovereign, the Tranquil Effulgence Lord, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Lofty Dragon Mist.

Then the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao mounts the Cavernous Effulgence Jade Chariot, driving the Grand Auroral Purple Mist and Mysterious Effulgence’s radiance. He summons the Ninefold Tenuity Inner Emperor Lord, named Shen Mingxian, along with the Supreme Sovereign, the Ninefold Mysterious, and the Nine Heavens’ various perfected immortals and transcendents, and together they ascend to the Mijianluo Terrace, the Empyrean’s Utmost Desolation Mound, the Soaring Non-Cloud Root Capital of the Jade Clarity Upper Heaven. There they behold the Jade Clarity Purple Radiance Supreme Jade Sovereign, the Illustrious Supreme Lord of the Great Dao, and receive the Hidden Talisman of the Lofty Clarity, Supreme Void, and Boundless Upper Dao Lord.

Such is the solemnity of the Supreme Lord’s ninefold journey, the inception of his soaring ascent. The eightfold effulgent chariots proceed in sequence, the eightfold primes wafting mists; the jade chariot’s flying banners, the grand aurora encircling its wheels. Sun and moon are drawn together, escorting the imperial carriage and raising its canopy. The Five Emperors drive forth, illuminating the Nine Heavens; the Primordial Rigidity grasps the register, the Northern Culmen commands the spirits. The Supreme Emperor unfolds the Dao, the Grand Simplicity gathers the clouds. Seven thousand divine tigers roar mightily, nine hundred venomous dragons open the ford. Fierce beasts sing the path, sixfold leaders bear mountains in their jaws; eagles and birds of prey brandish their talons, severing the nets of myriad treacheries. The Nine Emperors gird themselves with the sun’s effulgence, the Five Marchmounts cleave the nine barriers.

Behold the fiery armor of blazing cypress, the circular array of forest-like weapons. Wielding hundred-fathom halberds, they topple mountains and drain rivers. The Heavenly Soldiers and Martial Troops, myriad upon myriad of coiling serpents; the female cavalry rides a thousand leagues, their feathers drifting in the void. They hurl fire-bells upward, leaping through the air in dazzling streams. Molten metal surges in reverse, bursting asunder the eight corners. The majestic wind penetrates the source, uprooting forests and tearing out trees.

Auspicious clouds darkly soar, dragon mists obscurely interweave and support. Girded with the seven dawns’ nocturnal effulgence, they bind the nine luminances’ moon-pearls. Black tigers roar and howl, scattering and spreading the celestial array. Jade is struck and bells resound; the Northern Feng unfolds the dawn. The bright reins traverse the nine thoroughfares, precious incense and blossoms scatter. The effulgent chariot hurls through the empyrean, the eight primes dance upon the canopy. A thousand myriad paths, yellow-robed master soldiers; feathered canopies float in the void, cinnabar banners extend their essence. Brocade-fanged dragon standards, myriad upon myriad, vie in splendor. Flying mists press against the sun, their luster dimming its brilliance; fivefold auroras entwine its radiance, surging and filling the empty courtyard.

Grasping the tally to subdue demons, brandishing swords to tread upon spirits. Dragon-men blow upon flutes, patterned tigers play upon zithers. Jade drums shake with thunder, the ninefold radiance turns day to dusk. Eight wolves govern the pitch-pipes, their harmonious tones resounding. Cloud harps are strummed in the void, traversing the falling notes of gong and shang. Horn and feather receive the zhi, merging with the empty and cavernous brilliance. Eight hundred divine maidens sing and dance in the Upper Clarity. Cloud-veiled brocade sleeves, feathered kerchiefs fluttering in the azure. To the right, they wave the Vast Perfected; to the left, they summon the Dawn Mulberry. Graceful and distant, the cloud array; emerald canopies flow like meteors. Soaring and wheeling in formation, sleeves and necks intertwined. Bathing in the Grand Void, plucking the empty space to absorb effulgence. They call forth the sevenfold Dao’s purple mists, streaming the dragon candles’ flickering glow. Ten thousand glances reach the utmost joy, carefree upon the empyrean’s ridge. Treading upon auroras, surpassing the void, fiercely ascending the jade city. The celestial harmony’s phoenix tones, feathered simurghs sing in unison. Flying blossoms snow in descent, the nocturnal sun revolves its essence. Nine-jointed jasper blossoms, pure white as frost. Grand cassia trees grow in succession, sweeping and brushing the perfect clarity. Dawn auroras array the reins, three wheels and nine chariots. Seething and penetrating the empty and mysterious, overturning the distant and obscure.

How great is the jade chariot’s majesty! What supreme virtue of numinous power! How lush is the empyrean’s effulgence! What flourishing splendor of soaring petals!

For the grand tone penetrates the cavernous, the jade Dao is profoundly remote. Lofty radiance revolves its brilliance, mysterious blossoms brightly flourish. Wondrous echoes recede like parted fans, divine maidens array in guard. The Five Elders assist his person, advancing virtue and augmenting qi. Harmonizing the hun and gathering the essence, the seven po are restrained. The Cavernous Immortals and Void Perfected, the Emperor Unity is most honored. Thereupon, the Directors of Destiny ride the whirlwind in unison, the Lords and Heirs share the chariot. Wheeling the reins upon the eight paths, flowing spirits through the ninefold essences. The Five Emperors descend to welcome, ascending to the Upper Clarity. Northward they pay homage to the Five Emperors, chanting and intoning the Cavernous Scriptures. Reposing in the Grand Simplicity, blossoming feathers in perfect clarity. Golden consorts approach the chamber, jade lads scatter incense. Upon concluding the recitation, they bow in reverence to the four directions. Thus is the honor accorded to the Cavernous Numinous, the heart’s aspiration to soar through the void.

Upon completion.

To receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture* and the *Jade Register of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*, the *Eight Winds’ Circuit of the Dao of the Emperor Unity*, one must first purify the fast for three years, or for seven hundred days, or for one hundred forty days. Bathe in the five fragrant herbs, preserve the true and meditate upon the immortals, with a profound heart earnestly entreat, prostrating at the master’s gate—only then may one receive them.

The one who transmits the scripture is called the *Master Lord*; the one who receives it is called the *Disciple*. Unless one’s heart is utterly sincere and the depths of the unseen laid bare, enduring long suffering within the numinous precincts, abasing oneself at the master’s gate and bowing the head in the hall of virtue, the *Cavern Scripture* and *Jade Register* shall never be revealed to the aspirant.

If the aspirant’s body is not naturally endowed with extraordinary *qi*, uniquely concentrated to harmonize with the spirit, if the spirit’s radiance does not inwardly illuminate and the feathered splendor does not reflect the profound, if the Grand Simplicity does not generate the five viscera and the seven numina do not enter the *niwan*, if the bones do not bear the jade radiance of the Five Emperors and the blood does not flow with the vast spring of molten gold—such are the marks of a celestial immortal.

Without these celestial signs, one shall never encounter a master of this scripture. Upon receiving the scripture, the covenant is sworn: the green jade ring is split, the pledge is opened for transmission, the belt is severed from kin—only then may one practice the *qi* of the Emperor Unity, recite the *Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, and receive the *Jade Register of the Supreme Lord*.

The scripture master originates from the primordial mystery, gathering the initial *qi* to traverse the unseen, clearing the obstructed paths to commune with the perfected, opening the cloud-crossings to guide the aspirant. Greatly crossing beyond water and fire, one must be born in clarity to achieve transcendence.

For those who become disciples of this scripture, they must devote themselves to its precepts with suffering heart, revering and serving the Master Lord, sharing the same flavors in food and drink, equally partaking in sweetness and bitterness. From beginning to end, they must mirror the divine luminaries, sharing peril and hardship as if on the same arduous path. Only then will the Emperor Unity gaze upon their goodness with enduring steadfastness, and the Supreme Lord wield the craftsman’s skill to complete the wheel. The heart’s core shall know no barrier in its devotion, the five viscera shall not sink beneath the burdens of the *niwan*. Thus, the *qi* shall meet the morning clouds, virtue shall uplift the seven mysteries, generation after generation shall be born with great fortune, descendants shall ever be noble immortals. Layer upon layer of the profound shall accumulate ten thousand myriad-fold, planting the roots of the Dao for ages to come. Ancestors shall return to the womb of rebirth, and the Supreme Lord shall aid the aspirant’s spirit.

Thereupon, the jade chamber becomes luminous and clear, the ninefold circuits merge and divide. The mirror of the heart remains ever unified, and the hundred spirits rejoice. In all expansion and contraction of suffering, the Master Lord is ever held in mind.

The *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, the highest and foremost section, concludes here.

To receive the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*, the *Eightfold Radiance Jade Register of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*, the *Eight Winds’ Circuit of the Dao of the Emperor Unity*, the *Fivefold Mysterious Return of the Concealed Cinnabar*, the *Twelve Supreme Vows of the Mysterious Mother of the Eight Intervals*, the *Golden Flower of the Cavern Chamber’s Preceding Feminine Unity and the Ninefold Mystery Array*, the *Numinous Writ of the Purple Text*, and the *Jade-Stemmed Cinnabar of the Five Viscera’s Life-Securing Treasure*—one must sever the jade ring and cut the cord to be worthy of their transmission. The regulations are as follows:

Fashion a ring of purple gold, one *cun* in diameter. Sever one ring, dividing it into two halves. The scripture master and the disciple shall each wear one half for life.

Take a cord of green silk, nine *chi* in length. Each shall cut half to bind their half-ring, then wear it together.

Take a piece of green brocade, one *chi* and eight *cun* in size. Each shall divide it in half to make a pouch, in which to store their half-ring and green silk cord.

Once the ring and cord are divided, the disciple shall bow three times to receive the scripture, and the scripture master shall kneel to transmit it. Each shall silently recite the vow:

*"I, [Name], now receive the* Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern Perfected Scripture *and the* Eightfold Radiance Jade Register of the Supreme Lord of the Great Dao*. May my body ascend to the Purple Void, attaining the immortal palaces. May my seven generations of ancestors return to the womb and be reborn. May great fortune and blessing fill my halls for generations to come. May my descendants flourish, a thousand thousand in radiant splendor. I shall not reveal the received scripture, but recite and cultivate its jade chapters, adhering to every precept and ritual to preserve my form."*

Should one violate the precepts or betray the scripture, calamity shall befall generation after generation. The severing of the silk and cutting of the ring shall be heard above by the Three Clarities, below by the Five Peaks, and by the Northern Emperor and the Three Officials.

Thus concludes the transmission.

In the eleventh year of the Yonghe reign of the Jin dynasty, in the year *yimao* (Wood Rabbit), on the first day of the ninth month at midnight, the scripture was received from Lady Wang of the Purple Tenuity. In total, twenty thousand two hundred and thirty characters, of which *The Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* comprises ten thousand characters. Here concludes the *Jade Register of the Eight Radiant Numina of the Golden Prime of the Dao*, bestowed by the Most High and Venerable Supreme Lord of the Great Dao of the Upper Clarity.
