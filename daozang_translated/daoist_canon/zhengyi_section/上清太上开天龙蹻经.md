### *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of the Celestial Dragon’s Ascent, Fascicle One*

#### **The Yellow Emperor Inquires of the Southern Lord’s Instructions (Chapter One)**

The Yellow Emperor, Xuanyuan, had long cultivated the essence of immortality. His spirit ascended to commune with the divine, and his birth was marked by extraordinary brilliance. Inheriting the mandate of the Celestial Thearch, he sought the true Dao, purified himself in the mysterious precincts, and ascended Yuntai Mountain to bow before the Lord of Nurturance. There, he inquired of the Three Caverns:

*"I have received the great legacy and govern the myriad affairs, yet whenever I seek the essential truths and uphold the mysterious decrees, my heart and form grow restless. The sagely Dao is profound and subtle, its abstruse principles empty and congealed—I have yet to attain true enlightenment.*

*The Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure’s* Five Chapters on Life-Generation, *the Cavern of Divinity and Immortality’s* Universal Manifestations of Form and Image, *the Great Cavern’s* Sagely Teachings—*their meanings penetrate the void, their substance transcends form to commune with emptiness.*

*Though the Three Treasures are equally received, the common mind remains deluded and stagnant. The supreme Dao is difficult to fathom. Do the Three Caverns, which generate all life, truly share a single origin?"*

The Perfected Lord Ning replied:

*"The primordial qi of the Mysterious Origin is the root of the Three Caverns. The Three Clarities and Three Realms universally manifest their responsive forms. The ranks of immortals and sages ascend through nine grades of the mysterious hierarchy. Though the Three Caverns intermingle, their responsive manifestations differ. Across kalpas, they adapt to transformations, and the Three Treasures descend in unison. Exalted sages incarnate below, bestowing teachings in accordance with karmic conditions.*

*The transmission of the supreme sages transcends words; the transmission of middling perfected beings relies on words to convey principles; the transmission to the lower realms depends on scriptures for cultivation. The deliverance of the worthy is thus distinguished into three grades."*

The Yellow Emperor bowed again and knelt to inquire:

*"I venture to ask: though the three grades differ, may you reveal their essentials to dispel all doubt?"*

The Perfected Lord Ning declared:

*"The Three Realms and Three Borders differ in their obstructions and perceptions. The descent of exalted sages and their enlightenment vary in depth. The unimpeded interpenetration of the Three Caverns is what defines them as such. Their responsive manifestations differ according to the Three Directions.*

*As for the transmission of the supreme sages:*
*In the Dragon Han kalpa, the Jade Thearch of the Supreme Dao manifested as the Sagely Lord of the Great Cavern of Celestial Treasure. Ascending to the Twelve Sagely Heavens of Jade Clarity, he transmitted the sagely Dao alongside the Emperor of the Yudan Heaven and the Nine Heavens’ Venerable One, the Emperor of the Shanshan Heaven and the Nine Heavens’ Perfected August, and the Emperor of the Xuyan Heaven and the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning—each teaching the nine grades of the sagely Dao across the three heavens.*

*In the Crimson Brightness kalpa, he manifested as the Perfected Lord of the Cavern of Mystery and Numinous Treasure. Ascending to the Twelve Perfected Heavens of Supreme Clarity, he transmitted the true Dao alongside the Emperor of the Jiran Heaven and the Primordial Master of Origin, the Emperor of the Bujiaole Heaven and the Highest Primordial August, and the Emperor of the Yingsheng Heaven and the Jade Thearch of the Empty Sovereign—each teaching the nine grades of the true Dao across the three heavens.*

*In the Supreme August kalpa, he manifested as the Immortal Lord of the Cavern of Divinity and the Divine Treasure. Ascending to the Twelve Immortal Heavens of Grand Clarity, he transmitted the immortal Dao alongside the Emperor of the Fanfu Heaven and the Myriad-Beginning Master, the Emperor of the Qingming Heaven and the Purple Void Emperor, and the Emperor of the Wu’ai Heaven and the Five August Ones of the Great Perfected—each teaching the nine grades of the immortal Dao across the three heavens.*
*This is the transmission of the supreme sages.*

*As for the transmission of middling perfected beings:*
*In the Grand Simplicity era, it was transmitted to the Grand Thearch Lord; in the Grand Beginning era, to the Heavenly Thearch Lord and Lingyangzi; in the Grand Initial era, to the Grand Tenuity Thearch Lord; in the Grand Ultimate era, to the Heavenly Thearch Lord of Grand Tenuity; in the Grand Prime era, to the Golden Watchtower’s Posterior Sage, the Great Peace’s Li Perfected Lord, the Prime Minister of the Plain Youth, the Prime Minister of the Azure Youth, and the Nine Mysteries Thearch Lord.*
*This is the transmission of middling perfected beings.*

*As for the transmission of scriptures to the lower realms, it encompasses twelve graded methods of responsive transformation:*
*First, the original texts, expounded by the Three Caverns;*
*Second, the divine talismans, proclaimed to affirm faith;*
*Third, the jade instructions, revealed to resolve doubts; [...]"*

Fourth, the numinous diagrams, which depict the marks of excellence;
Fifth, the genealogical records, which trace the transmission of the Dao through the ages;
Sixth, the precepts and disciplines, which guard against transgressions and restrain evil;
Seventh, the ritual decorum, which establishes the norms of conduct in the academies;
Eighth, the methods and practices, which regulate the progress of cultivation;
Ninth, the arts and calculations, which conceal the luminous and honor the form;
Tenth, the records and biographies, which transmit teachings to learners;
Eleventh, the hymns and eulogies, which sing of the sagely virtue;
Twelfth, the memorials and petitions, which present prayers and supplications.

The Three Caverns thoroughly penetrate responsive transformation, verifying the three vehicles. The accumulation of merit and verification of fruition also differ. According to the height of merit, one ascends to the various heavens. The karmic rewards of the heavens are attested by the sutras’ explanations. The thirty-six sections verify the ranks of rebirth in the heavens. The thirty-six heavens correspond to the ranks cultivated through the sutras. By ascending, one verifies the Dao-fruit. Because there is the arising of cultivation, liberation has its conditions, and the natural true nature is thus.

The Yellow Thearch bowed twice and again inquired: "The thirty-six sections correspond to three ranks of conditions; the thirty-six heavens correspond to the ranks cultivated through the sutras. The sutras verify the heavenly ranks, and by relying on the sutras, one is reborn in heaven. The three ranks respond to the sutras. Yet the common people are benighted and weak, unaware of the source of the Dao. Do they verify the ranks and achieve penetration?"

The Lord of Nurturance replied: "The scriptural methods of the Three Caverns are the gateways of the Heavenly Worthy. Responsive transformation and life’s arising all proceed from the establishment of marks. The body’s radiance illumines brilliantly, shining through the Grand Void. The realms of heaven and humanity all receive and plant these. The Three Treasures respond to images; the Nine Thearchs assist in forming them. Wondrous existence pervades and nourishes, first giving rise to the spirit’s awareness. When the spirit is clear and wisdom bright, the will mirrors and wisdom shines. When qi is turbid and the spirit dull, darkness and obscurity arise. When the body harmonizes with the Great Dao, the realm’s penetration is mysterious. In tranquil contemplation, the body’s spirits merge with the Three Clarities. The Eight Effulgences uphold and elevate, settling the cloud chariot’s course. The Nine Heavens assist in forming, subtly ascending to the pure realm. The thirty-six sections illumine your body; the thirty-six heavens’ contemplation follows the heart’s mastery. Listen carefully to my words, and I will explain it to you."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "The utmost Dao is without image, without form or name. From its root, it descends in traces, gradually manifesting the Three Bodies. From the arising of the Three Bodies, the Three Caverns unfold. The Three Realms and Three Worlds reveal the distinctions between the ordinary and the sagely. The Nine Heavens and Nine Persons respond to images and penetrate connections. The Three Treasures gradually and suddenly [transmit]; the Three Vehicles receive life. All arise from the Dharma-body, the body’s radiance and marks of excellence. The Three Bodies’ marks of excellence manifest the realm’s forms. Heavenly and human beings respond and transform, together nourishing and turning toward images. All plant their spirits from the marks of excellence, above receiving the mysterious essence, first accomplishing wondrous function.

The first is the Dharma-body, profoundly penetrating the subtle and obscure. The true and wondrous wisdom is pure and unimpeded. Above, it manifests the Dharma-body’s thirty-six gates, which unfold the Three Caverns’ thirty-six marks. Above and below correspond, forming seventy-two marks.

The second is the Response-body, which responds to the body and manifests images. The Three Realms and Three Worlds are perfectly luminous above and below. Descending qi gives rise to the spirit, forming numinous awareness. Immeasurable merits and virtues fully equip humans and heavens. Responding to karmic conditions, one verifies dwellings according to merit. Above, it manifests the Three Realms’ thirty-six heavens; below, it responds to the Three Worlds’ thirty-six Thearchs. Above and below penetrate and respond, forming seventy-two marks.

The third is the Transformation-body, which opens and transforms human spirits. All contain the Three Caverns; the nine qi give rise to life. Imitating heaven and earth, they unite to form awareness and numinosity. Internally, it manifests the Transformation-body’s thirty-six marks; externally, it displays the thirty-six marks of living humans. Internally and externally correspond, forming seventy-two marks.

The thirty-six sections are the source without marks. From principle, words are entrusted to weigh its pattern. Responding to the arising of realms, merits fill the ten directions. Returning to the root and reverting to the origin establishes the ranks of ascent. Verifying fruition and advancing in position, one transcends to the Great Network. Comprehending the Great Dao, one enters true actuality. Perfectly fulfilling purity and clarity, beneficence spreads to the black-haired people. Skillfully opening expedient means, it demonstrates conditioned dharmas. Penetrating life’s wondrous function, it gives rise to awareness. Myriad transformations respond to conditions; the one mark is empty and tranquil."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "The profound and quiescent Dharma-body gives rise to the empty and cavernous. Within the empty and cavernous, the Grand Source arises. From the Grand Source’s transformation, the three qi are born. The upper qi is called *Beginning*; the middle qi is called *Origin*; the lower qi is called *Mysterious*. The *Mysterious* qi gives rise to what issues from *Origin*; the *Origin* qi gives rise to what issues from *Beginning*. This qi’s root is the ancestral lord of images, hence it is called the *Mysterious-Origin-Beginning* qi.

The *Mysterious-Origin-Beginning* qi is the mysterious root of the Three Realms. Above, it responds to the Three Realms, establishing the Three Worthies. In the middle, it gives rise to the Three Worlds, the Three Vehicles receiving and guiding. Together, they form the Three Origins, giving rise to the Three Offices of humans. Thus, these three qi bestow ranks and give life. The three give rise to the myriad existences, the root source and original beginning."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "Within the Three Clarities’ heavens, the *Mysterious-Origin-Beginning* qi combines three with five, transforming into the Eight Effulgent Spirits. Each gives rise to the eight directions, forming the Twenty-Four Thearchs. Above, they become the Three Clarities’ Twenty-Four Palaces, the Purple Void’s immortal precincts. Descending, they become the Four Brahmās. The four eights transform and give rise to the Three Worlds’ Twenty-Four Palaces, universally forming one heaven’s twenty-four qi, which internally give rise to the human body’s twenty-four constituents. Thus, these Three Origins, Three Sections, Eight Effulgences, and Twenty-Four Thearchs—each Thearch has three origins, each origin has five spirits, combining to form three hundred sixty spirits. The six sixes’ ranked lineages combine qi to give rise to spirits. Above, they form the Three Clarities’ sixty-four Brahmā qi. Two sixes combine, forming thirty-two, which descend to give rise to the Three Worlds’ thirty-two heavens, universally forming one heaven’s thirty-two Thearchs. The twenty-eight lodges, the jade armillary sphere, thus give rise to one heaven’s three hundred sixty days, one month’s three hundred sixty hours, one earth’s three hundred sixty famous mountains, and one human body’s three hundred sixty bones."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "The *Mysterious-Origin-Beginning* qi combines to give rise to the nine qi, hence forming the Nine Thearchs. Above, they become the Nine Heavens; in the middle, they give rise to the Nine Heavens; below, they become the Nine Earths. The Nine Sages of the various heavens all fully possess form and spirit. They give rise to the nine apertures of humans, who receive the Dao and establish life."

Moreover, it gives rise to the *Bi-Di* realms, dividing the nine wilds into directions. Above, they connect with the Five Thearchs; the four movements cycle in succession. The nine qi array themselves in proper order, while yin-yang and the Five Phases give form to the peoples and all things, all receiving completion and life.

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "The Three Pures and Nine Heavens each generate the eight directions, thus forming the seventy-two offices. The Three Origins each possess twenty-four Thearchs: above, they become the twenty-four Perfected; in the middle, the twenty-four Spirits; below, the twenty-four Living Beings. The Three Origins and Eight Sceneries give rise to the divine clans. Combined with the Central Nine Palaces, they number eighty-one, universally generating the eighty-one divisions of the various heavens, universally producing the eighty-one domains of the various earths, and internally forming the eighty-one joints of the human body."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "The Orthodox Unity of the Great Dao issues forth the True Thearchs. The Orthodox Unity of the Mysterious Perfected gives birth to the Great Spirits. When the Three Origins resolve and transform, they are what the One generates. Thus, the mysterious work returns to the One, and the myriad affairs arise therefrom—this is the ancestral origin of the Supreme Dao, the root and beginning of the primordial qi. From the root, traces descend, universally planting form and spirit. Through the nameless, the named is established; through the named, the nameless is expounded. They interpenetrate as realms, responding to qi to generate spirit.

The Three Caverns interpenetrate and transform, becoming the Three Duke Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. The Nine Heavens interpenetrate and transform, corresponding to the Nine Minister Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. The ranks of immortals, perfected, and sages each certify the nine grades, thus comprising the three nines—twenty-seven ranks—hence the Twenty-Seven Grand Master Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. When the Nine Heavens first took shape, layered above and below, and in their responsive divisions, they arrayed the eight directions, thus comprising nine nines—eighty-one ranks—hence the Eighty-One Primordial Scholar Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies.

Combining the Three Dukes, Nine Ministers, Twenty-Seven Grand Masters, and Eighty-One Primordial Scholars, each generates its qi and manifestations, thus forming the One Hundred Twenty Prefecture Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. Within these One Hundred Twenty Prefecture Heavens, there are the Five Offices internally and the Five Bureaus externally, each generating ten spirits, together forming the One Thousand Two Hundred County Official Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. Within each of the One Thousand Two Hundred Counties, there are the Three Origins, and each Origin has five townships, thus forming the Eighteen Thousand Township Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. Within each of the Eighteen Thousand Township Heavens, they receive the five qi to form the Five Heavenly Pavilions, thus forming the Thirty-Six Thousand Pavilion Heavens of the Heavenly Worthies. Within each of the Thirty-Six Thousand Pavilions, each pavilion has five watchtowers, together forming the One Hundred Eighty Thousand Watchtowers of the Heavenly Worthies.

Thus, these officials and subordinates universally generate the various heavens and fully equip the spirits of humans. Each receives its qi and manifestations, all attaining stability and planting the roots of life. The Purple Gates and Jade Chambers, the thirty-six thousand joints—all simultaneously generate spirit from the root and original beginning."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "Formerly, I received the *Heavenly Scripture of Opening the Heavens* from the Jade Thearch. The Three Caverns’ Dharma Gates are the root and beginning of the myriad transformations. They descend to generate realms and plant form and spirit, responding to and perceiving the multitude of numina, universally receiving their offices and subordinates.

The Three Pures’ Upper Realms are the mysterious roots of the Three Caverns. Below, they generate the Three Realms. The Two Sceneries interpenetrate, the Four Threads govern the movements, the Five Qi arise in succession, and the Hundred Sixteen Numbers intersect. Kalpas have arising and ceasing; the lifespans of the various heavens differ in length, high and low. According to merit, certifications and retributions manifest distinctions.

Thus, the Three Caverns are expounded. The Dao Lords proclaim and transmit them, bestowing upon the worthy to be delivered, opening and receiving across kalpas. You now ask about the previously mentioned responsive generations—listen carefully to my words, and I shall reveal to you the precious instructions.

The Primordial Beginning opens and transforms, universally pervading heaven and humanity. The body generates marks of excellence; realms universally receive and endow. The formless responds to the embodied; through images, words are established. Through cultivation arising from the conditioned, one then ascends to emptiness and quiescence. The Three Caverns provide guidance; the nine grades descend in gradation. The wondrous extremity of the Dao’s source darkly communicates with the Mysterious One. The body resolves the profound and vast; understanding illuminates the subtle and wise. The wondrous gates of the Three Pures condescend to perceive these responses."

The Lord of Tranquility addressed the Yellow Thearch: "Formerly, I received from the Great Thearch that in the primordial kalpa of the past, when the Dragon Han revealed the chart, within the inner vastness of primordial chaos, the Ten Titles manifested bodies, entrusting traces to the various heavens, establishing the various Dharmas, and discoursing the Dao beyond words.

The Heavenly Barrier generated the Heavenly Juice, the Heavenly Worthy within the heavens. The formless transformed and generated within the Bright Rosy Clouds Observatory of the Great Luo Heaven, expounding the Three Caverns and thirty-six sections, descending to generate the Three Realms and thirty-six heavens. The Dharma Gates of the Three Caverns are the root and beginning of the myriad practices. Below, they generate the Three Realms, where the forms of beings and things flow forth. From the eight directions downward, each generates five myriad, five thousand, five hundred, and fifty-five myriad, and so on—limitless Three Realms and *Bi-Di* heavens. In the eight directions, each possesses three thousand great thousandfold worlds.

The limitless Three Realms all receive from the Three Pures. The Three Origins above and below comprise thirty-six heavens. Each heaven has four directions, and four nines array the ranks, above corresponding to the thirty-six gates of the Heavenly Armillary Sphere, universally forming the thirty-six tones of the *Bi-Di* realms. Within a single mote of dust are thirty-six qi. Heavenly beings and humans mutually perceive and together receive the Dao to generate life.

The thirty-six earths universally perceive and respond to the images. The Three Caverns interpenetrate and transform; the ordinary and sagely differ. Responses follow the mechanisms, and there are further nine kinds: the Upper and Lower Sagely Teachings, which above communicate with the Jade Pure; the Middle-Upper Perfected Teachings, which next communicate with the Highest Pure; the Lower-Upper Immortal Teachings, which next communicate with the Grand Pure; the Upper-Middle Sagely Teachings, which next communicate with the Formless; the Middle-Middle Perfected Teachings, which next communicate with the Heaven of Form; the Lower-Middle Immortal Teachings, which next communicate with the Realm of Desire; the Upper-Lower Sagely Teachings, which below connect with the keen-rooted; the Middle-Lower Perfected Teachings, which below connect with the average-rooted; and the Lower-Lower Immortal Teachings, which below connect with the dull-rooted.

The Three Vehicles proceed gradually or suddenly; the three roots differ. The heavenly beings and humans of the Three Realms are guided by the Three Treasures. The sagely teachings of the Three Pures are the mysterious steps of the Three Caverns. The Divine Homeland of the Thearchs is vast in principle and empty and silent, universally generating the wondrous existence of the various heavens as good ladders. The nature of the Dao is empty and congealed, neither arising nor ceasing, neither coming nor going. It reveals the gates of the multitude of wonders, appearing and disappearing in the indistinct, demonstrating the true and real Dharma.

The various heavens receive bliss. From arising and cultivation, through karmic conditions and actions, from root to fruition and beginning, certifying fruition and transcending—all proceed from these six gates."

The heart holds compassion, mercy, kindness, and forbearance—all four equal perfections. In yielding gentleness and earnest faith, it admonishes and pacifies, ceasing contention. It delights in virtuous conduct and relinquishes the mind of non-virtue. With each thought expanding and broadening, blessings, virtue, and wisdom flourish. The celestial eye perceives clearly, discerning the absence of conceptual thought. Once thought is gone, form and shape also vanish. Abandoning discriminative consciousness and deepening cultivation, there is no weariness or exertion. Without movement or action, even the lightest dust is forgotten. Transcending worldly arising and ceasing, one reaches the realm of the Four Sages. Lifespan and blessings span vast kalpas without obstruction. Manifesting transformation bodies, one descends to save the ordinary. Accumulating merit and ascending step by step, one rises through the mysteries to certify fruition.

Further ascending to the Four Brahma Heavens, one gradually ascends to the Grand Clarity. Entering the Nine Immortals, one next ascends to the Highest Clarity. Entering the Nine Perfected, one next ascends to the Jade Clarity. Ascending to the Nine Sages, one reaches the highest sagehood, the supreme-most fruition. Merit and virtue become full, ascending the Dao to enter the formless. Forgetting merit and forgetting fruition, the natural true nature merges with the Dao, obscurely uniting with the Heavenly Worthy of Empty Silence. The entire body eternally abides in profound stillness.

Ning Jun declared: The Three Caverns open and transform, universally planting the seeds for heavenly beings and humans. All officials and retainers receive and uphold them. The Lord of Living Beings exists without form yet is eternally present. The responsive bodies of the realm all become Heavenly Thearchs, universally serving as the Thirty-Six Heavenly Worthies of the upper and lower realms.

Moreover, in this realm, there are thirty-six sounds governing the heavenly worlds, encompassing thirty-six thearchs. From the lower forms to the upper earthly regions, they universally oversee thirty-six qi of thirty-six divisions, universally delivering the boundless Thirty-Six Heavens, ascending through graded ranks.

The sagely hosts of the Three Pures abide in wondrous stillness and constancy. The Three Realms and Nine Lands revolve through the four seasons with swift appropriateness.

When the kalpas of the Three Realms are destroyed, all returns to primordial chaos without arising. The Three Pures and Three Treasures descend primordial qi anew. With each kalpa’s reconstruction, the Three Qi serve as the foundation, and the Three Treasures universally generate life. The nine revolutions are not uniform.

Thus, at the summit of the Formless Realm, the Upper Primordial Heaven’s qi converges for 3,300 degrees, forming the Lesser Yang Nine and Lesser Hundred Six. When its qi converges for 6,600 degrees, it forms the Middle Yang Nine and Middle Hundred Six. When its qi converges for 9,900 degrees, it forms the Greater Yang Nine and Greater Hundred Six. The lower realms of form and desire differ from the upper, with the lower being shorter and the upper longer, their years and months distinct.

At the summit of the Formless Realm above, qi converges for 3,300 degrees. Below it, at the summit of the Middle Primordial Heaven of the Form Realm, qi converges for 6,600 degrees. Further below, at the summit of the Lower Primordial Heaven of the Desire Realm, qi converges for 9,900 degrees. Above lies the Lesser Yang Nine of the Formless Realm; in the middle, the Middle Yang Nine of the Form Realm; below, the Greater Yang Nine of the Desire Realm.

In the Desire Realm below, ten thousand kalpas reduce all to dust. In the Form Realm, a hundred kalpas bring destruction. In the Formless Realm above, one kalpa brings universal dissolution.

Moreover, within the Desire Realm, the nine lands differ. When heaven and earth converge for 3,300 degrees, three lands suffer decline—water, fire, warfare, disease, famine, and starvation cause death. When they converge for 6,600 degrees, six lands suffer harm. When they converge for 9,900 degrees, all nine lands are damaged.

Thus, the Great One distributes qi in circulation. The qi of the Grand Year Palace shifts and adapts, pervading households and nations, extending even to the human body. Wherever it reaches, illness follows the spirit. Three periods—adverse and favorable—intertwine with the eight directions. After thirty-six years, twelve cycles complete, forming a minor convergence. Accumulating numbers brings calamity. Reciting this scripture averts such misfortune.

At the convergence of great and small kalpas, when the nine qi reach their end, karmic retribution is uncertain, and rewards differ above and below.

At this time, the Yellow Thearch bowed and attended upon Lord Ning, inquiring about the transmission of the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures and their three ranks. Having posed his question, he bowed again, touched his forehead to the ground, and further sought instruction, saying: “The Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures give rise above to the Three Realms and the thirty-six heavens. Once the thirty-six divisions are born, each realm possesses its own thirty-six heavens—are these thirty-six heavens also the thirty-six divisions?”

Lord Ning replied: “The primal qi of the Mysterious Origin, the profound root of the Three Realms, and the thirty-six divisions establish the celestial abodes as their dharma-seats. The Three Caverns bestow virtue as the life-giving lords of heaven and humanity; the Nine Sages’ interconnected transformations serve as the mysterious root of the Image Emperors. The thirty-six divisions are the life-gate of the realms, and the thirty-six heavens are the graded steps to enter the Dao.

Thus, through the scriptures, one is guided; through the illumination of qi and images, one connects with the scriptures. Paths are opened to verify the Dao’s homeland; through verification and cultivation, one ascends to the fruit of sageliness. The body and spirit are purified to commune with the Dao’s realms; covenants are cultivated to dispel deluded passions.

The thirty-six divisions’ cave-visions descend in unison; the thirty-six heavens respond according to the heart’s orientation. The Three Clarities’ upper realms and the lower worlds correspond through karmic conditions. Ascents and descents within the Three Realms depend upon the heart’s intent. As the graded steps are unequal, realm-names are established. According to root and response, there are five kinds in all. Listen carefully to my words, and I shall explain them to you.”

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Thearch, saying: “In the past, I received the transmission from the Dao’s Lord, the Dharma-King of Life and Transformation, the Most Honored in the Heavens, and all were bestowed upon me.

At the initial descent of the Wondrous One, the sagely transformation began. It arose from the Origin, and the Origin connects with the true Dao. The Origin arises from the Mysterious, and the Mysterious presides over the teachings of immortality. The perfected immortals and sagely ranks, the Three Caverns’ profound honored ones, establish the Three Treasures’ positions, and the Three Titles also differ.

Thus, at the beginning of the Dragon Han kalpa, the Origin opened the chart and manifested as the Heavenly Treasure Sagely Lord of the Jade Clarity, titled the Great Cavern’s Formless Heavenly Worthy. He expounded the *Twelve Divisions of the Great Cavern Scripture* and instructed the twelve sagely heavens of the Jade Clarity.

Next, during the Crimson Brightness kalpa, he manifested as the Numinous Treasure Perfected Lord of the Upper Clarity, titled the Cavern-Mysterious Nameless Heavenly Worthy. He expounded the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Mysterious Scripture* and instructed the twelve perfected heavens of the Upper Clarity.

Next, during the Supreme Sovereign kalpa, he manifested as the Divine Treasure Immortal Lord of the Grand Clarity, titled the Cavern-Spirit Origin’s Heavenly Worthy. He expounded the *Twelve Divisions of the Cavern-Spirit Scripture* and instructed the twelve immortal heavens of the Grand Clarity.

The thirty-six divisions of scriptures arose among the various heavens, and the heaven-dwellers examined and received them, thus naming the Three Realms. The Three Vehicles’ gradual and sudden teachings universally guide and ferry across; they open and deliver the worthy. Manifesting bodies in response, they descend to receive and transmit teachings through the ages. The Heavenly Worthies’ divine Three Caverns’ treasure scriptures display their functions according to the directions.

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Thearch, saying: “The Origin’s manifested bodies, possessing seventy-two marks, give rise above to the Three Realms and below to the Three Worlds, all receiving the Three Caverns. The ranks of beings flow into form, born from the heaven’s Origin—hence the title ‘Heavenly Worthy.’

The thirty-six divisions of Heavenly Worthies transform within the Three Worlds; the Three Treasures receive and give life, responding to differing karmic conditions. Thus, they become the Formless Realm, the Form Realm, and the Desire Realm. Moreover, as the roots and natures of sentient beings vary, even within a single heaven, there are five kinds.

The first is the Three Caverns’ Three Realms; the second is the Responsive Transformation’s Three Realms; the third is the Reversed Departure from the Three Realms; the fourth is the Flowing Arrival into the Three Realms; the fifth is the Cyclic Rebirth within the Three Realms.

The first, the Three Caverns’ Three Realms: the thirty-six divisions give rise above to the Three Realms’ thirty-six heavens, in the middle to the Three Worlds’ thirty-six emperors, and below to the nine ramparts’ thirty-six earthly sovereigns. Heaven-dwellers and humans interconnect; the Three Vehicles ferry across. Essence and qi interpenetrate, all receiving the Three Caverns. Those who cultivate goodness obtain birth.

The second, the Responsive Transformation’s Three Realms: the three divisions’ eight luminaries respond as yin and yang, transforming through the four seasons. One sees birth, aging, illness, and death.

The third, the Reversed Departure from the Three Realms: the wondrous qi of the utmost Dao nourishes and nurtures the life-spirit. Though dwelling in attachment, one is not defiled by it. Rising above the crowd and transcending the mundane, one departs from the gate of conditioned existence, reverses this clamorous dust, and alone transcends to the supreme Dao.

The fourth, the Flowing Arrival into the Three Realms: from the Dao’s wondrous origin, one temporarily resides in yin and yang. The form is defiled by the six passions; one sees arising and clings to attachments. Good follows good, and evil follows evil, flowing and turning to receive retribution, entering the gates of good and evil.

The fifth, the Cyclic Rebirth within the Three Realms: one is deeply attached and defiled, falling into the Three Wretched Realms, flowing and turning in evil destinies, unable to escape. Forever sinking in the sea of suffering, eternally drowning in craving and desire.”

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Thearch, saying: “The Origin manifested and expounded the Three Caverns’ sacred scriptures, unifying and completing the realms, guiding and ferrying across the graded steps. From non-being, being arises; the heaven-dwellers are transformed and enlightened, enabling them to ascend to the origin’s appearance, enter emptiness and liberation, and above, reveal the Three Realms. The Three Caverns universally connect; below, they give rise to the Three Worlds, responding to three kinds of karmic conditions: first, the vast and empty void; second, the obstructive form and color; third, the conditioned mind and its essence.

The first, the vast and empty void: the Dao’s qi pervades the Great Void, responding to images and establishing non-being, thus forming the realms. Mountains, rivers, and stone walls, perilous and secluded places, upright and beautiful or crooked and ugly—all become attachments. The six destinies of heaven-dwellers and humans perceive and respond to the origin, hence called the first, the vast and empty void.

The second, the obstructive form and color: the responsive transformation of the Three Worlds’ thirty-two heavens, born in yin and yang, forms corporeal existence. From the Dao’s wondrous One, the good obtain life’s essence, temporarily lodging in the womb. In the world, father and mother unite their halves, grasping at form. The sense faculties are complete—this is the aggregate of form.

Once the faculties are established, the six kinds of consciousness arise, giving rise to discrimination—this is the aggregate of consciousness. Having falsely aggregated dust, one discriminates illusory appearances, generating attachment—this is the aggregate of perception. After the inversion of perception, false love and hate arise, giving rise to greed and anger—this is the aggregate of volition.”

Having beheld the aggregates’ convergence, deluded thoughts solidify, clinging views and ignorance arise, giving birth to evil deeds. Sinking into the Three Wretched Realms, one cannot escape—this is what is called the obstructive form and color.

As for the conditioned and contemplative essence of the mind: this essence is itself karmic retribution, born from karmic conditions. Those of wise virtue return to the Dao and revert to the Source, while the ignorant, defiled, and debased drift and wander through evil destinies. According to the retribution they incur, they perceive the six desires and the four minds, which serve as the boundaries of their realm—this is what is called the conditioned and contemplative essence of the mind.

Thus, the differentiations of karmic response within the Three Realms yield distinct retributions, of which there are five kinds:

First, the state prior to entering the bonds of the Three Realms: though born within their domain, it is not a cause of the Three Realms. Transcending birth and extinction, one ascends to the Four Deva Heavens of Humanity.

Second, the karma that begets birth in the formless realm: transcending form and desire, one relinquishes the four subtle dusts of the senses, intensively cultivating delusive form to purify the spirit.

Third, the karma that begets birth in the form realm: due to the profound weight of form, one gradually relinquishes the six dusts and three measures, and further relinquishes the eighteen heavens’ retribution.

Fourth, the karma that begets birth in the desire realm: the six desires lead to infatuation, thus incurring the six heavens’ retribution.

Fifth, the karma that begets birth in the Three Evil Destinies: due to infatuation with the six desires, the three poisons arise, causing one to fall into the destinies of beasts, hungry ghosts, and hell.

*Upper Clarity Scripture of the Most High on the Opening of Heaven and the Dragon’s Ascent, Scroll Two: Chapter Three, "The Office of Universal Generation"*

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: In former times, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, within the Bright Rosy Clouds Observatory of the Great Luo Heaven, responded to the realm of arising existence and expounded the Three Caverns and their thirty-six divisions.

The twelve scriptures of the Upper Grade of the Great Cavern possess the merit of all the Three Caverns’ thirty-six revered scriptures. Why is this so? The sagely teachings of the Great Cavern universally give rise to immortals and transcendents, encompassing all scriptures and their attendant offices. Thus, there are the merits of the Upper Grade of the thirty-six divisions within the Caverns of Mystery and Spirit. The Cavern of Mystery does not extend to the uppermost but only reaches the lower, while it embraces the Cavern of Spirit, hence possessing the power of the twenty-four divisions of true transcendents. The immortals’ scriptures of the Cavern of Spirit do not reach the uppermost but only hold the merit of the twelve divisions’ scriptures for giving rise to immortals.

The Three Caverns respond to transformation, universally initiating the source of arising; the Three Treasures guide and receive, with distinctions between the coarse and the subtle. From the subtlety of the Dao, the qi descends in traces to give rise to spirit. From non-being, being arises; from being, non-being is possessed. Comprehending the Great Dao in its embodiment, one arouses the unsurpassed mind, liberates from non-action, and abides in the eternal joy of the self’s contention.

The true teachings of the Cavern of Mystery, the middle vehicle responding to conditions, descend from the sagely to the true, penetrating the mysterious to enter the subtle. Thus, they expound responsive transformation, opening the gate of expedient means. Knowing being as non-being, one arises from being to cultivate, without the mind of attachment or defilement, departing from the realm of action to practice right contemplation and dwell in the Middle Way.

The immortals’ teachings of the Cavern of Spirit, lodged in preparatory causes and conditions, establish the offices of the various heavens and their attendants, transforming humans and spirits, and establishing all dharmas. The Three Treasures universally transform, with immortality as the gate of arising. From arising, one arises to cultivate, entering the formless body. Thus, responsive transformation is revealed: the yang of immortality arises first, from arising one ascends to immortality, from immortality one ascends to the true, from the true one ascends to the sagely, and from the sagely one ascends to the Dao.

The wondrous being of the Three Caverns takes qi as its origin. The origin arises from the beginning, the beginning from the primordial, and the primordial from the mysterious. The beginning qi communicates with the sagely, giving rise above to the Jade Clarity; the primordial qi presides over the true, giving rise in the middle to the Highest Clarity; the mysterious presides over the immortals’ teachings, giving rise below to the Grand Clarity. The Three Clarities respond to images, the Three Treasures universally descend, the thirty-six divisions respond to heavenly instruction, the thirty-six heavens are the roots of the Three Caverns’ arising, the three realms receive qi according to their realms and cultivate their grades. Seventy-two marks manifest the forms of their realms, eighty-one excellences express the great being of arising.

Thus, during the Dragon Han kalpa, he was named the Formless Heavenly Worthy, responding as the Heavenly Treasure Sagely Lord of Jade Clarity, serving as the revered Jade Emperor of the Great Cavern. He gave rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion myriad qi, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion myriad miles, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine billion myriad years. When the years and miles reached their end, their divisions combined and extended downward to the three realms, forming the great kalpa.

Next, during the Red Clarity kalpa, he was named the Nameless Heavenly Worthy, responding as the Numinous Treasure Perfected Lord of Highest Clarity, serving as the revered Lord of the Cavern of Mystery. He gave rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad qi, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad miles, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad years. When the years and miles reached their end, their divisions combined and extended downward to the three realms, forming the middle kalpa.

Next, during the Highest Sovereign kalpa, he was named the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, serving as the revered spirit of the Cavern of Spirit. He gave rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety myriad qi, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad miles, each qi giving rise to ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine myriad years. When the years and miles reached their end, their divisions combined and extended downward to the three realms, forming the lesser kalpa.

The Heavenly Worthy declared: Now, responding to images, my realm pervades my body, manifesting above to the various heavens and responding below to the myriad images. Through kalpas of responsive transformation, I open the path to salvation for countless beings. The superior worthies of the Dao descend to serve as masters and preceptors, or are born in the lower realms, mingling with beings in obscurity, assuming forms to communicate with the mundane. Sinking and floating, indistinguishable, they transform in accord with the Dao, responding to and receiving those with karmic affinity. For those who receive these scriptures, they open wisdom and understanding, silently practicing salvation without claiming merit, with pure resolve and clear spirit, to proclaim this Dharma.

Lord Ning further addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: The Three Clarities and Nine Emperors, the eight luminaries universally pervading all directions, respond to the arising of the three realms, universally serving as guides. Descending to the three realms, they give form to all grades of beings, opening the minds of heavenly and human beings, who together receive their offices.

Thus, the mysterious, primordial, and beginning qi each give rise to eight luminaries, forming the twenty-four emperors. The nine heavens each give rise to eight luminaries, forming the seventy-two offices. The twenty-four emperors transform into twenty-four spirits, the twenty-four spirits transform into twenty-four qi. Qi also becomes spirit, spirit also becomes qi. Scattered, they become clouds and mists; gathered, they become forms and shadows. Emerging, they become creation and transformation; entering, they become the True One. Above, they conjoin the Three Origins, giving rise to the myriad things in speech.

The transformations of spirit and the true have no fixed names. Among the hundred spirits, all form virtue through the union of three. At the ultimate of heaven and earth, the upper realm has twenty-four emperors, and below, the three realms have twenty-four qi. The twenty-four emperors each have three origins, each origin has five spirits, together giving rise to three hundred sixty spirits. Intermingling through the three realms, the three hundred sixty spirits each give rise to one heaven with three hundred sixty palaces, each giving rise to one year with three hundred sixty days, and one month with three hundred sixty hours. Each gives rise to the three hundred sixty bones of the human body and universally gives rise to the three hundred sixty famous mountains of the earth.

Below, the heavenly qi communicate, the eight luminaries descend in unison, above they irrigate the vital fluids, conjoining qi to plant together. The boundless three realms universally receive this origin. Heaven and humans communicate, all realms universally pervade. The eight luminaries open transformation, responding to images to establish the origin. The twenty-four emperors above give rise to three hundred sixty spirits, forming through six positions, combining into sixty-four brahma qi. The six positions conjoin, forming thirty-two, and thirty-two years make one cycle of Heavenly One.

Thus are the Three Realms and the thirty-two heavens made manifest. The Three Clarities and the nine qi communicate with the divine above and below, laterally penetrating the celestial pivot, with the four movements shining brightly. The Three Caverns’ celestial reckoning marks the year as three origins, the six yang positions and celestial stems as the six fasting months. The eight luminaries circulate their motion, the eight nodes as the gates of cultivation; the ten straight days for venerating the honored, upholding and practicing the ten virtues. Burning incense and vowing mindfulness, merits move the various heavens; lighting lamps to continue brightness, delivering the living and rescuing the dead. Fragrant flowers and jeweled canopies offer reverence to the various heavens; reciting and reading the honored scriptures enables penetrating wisdom and understanding. Above, repenting for the seven generations of ancestors and former transgressions; below, for all sentient beings to equally receive the moisture of the Dharma’s grace. The multitude of sages of the Three Clarities condescend to witness the cinnabar sincerity; the palace attendants of the Three Realms together bestow their luminous oversight. The Three Palaces are pure and serene, the nine portals perfectly radiant; the five viscera dawn with clarity, the six bowels communicate wisdom. The eighty-one excellences give rise to light in the eighty-one joints; the thirty-two marks illuminate the three hundred sixty bones. The thirty-two emperors manifest the mysterious and empty; the thirty-six heavens display the ascent to the summit’s appearance. The eight luminaries are fully arrayed in guard, the nine heavens wing the form, riding the luminous and spurring the dragon to ascend the Jade Clarity.

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: The great Dao of generation and transformation communicates with all things, nothing excluded; vast, it encompasses without boundary, minute, it enters without gap. Nothing fails to receive it, yet nothing gives rise to it; nothing fails to be delivered, nothing fails to be perfected. It opens and expands the great void, dividing it into ten ranks. From the Great Luo above down to the Three Clarities, it forms seven divisions; above and all around, all is encompassed by the great void, established as the realm of the Dao. Thus, upon the Mysterious Capital’s Jade Capital Mountain, there are the seven qi of enlightenment.

Below the Great Luo arise the Three Realms, together forming seven divisions, all around encompassing the great void, communicating as the sacred realm. Furthermore, the Three Clarities and the eight directions’ central points each form another division below, giving rise to the five hundred million myriad, five myriad myriad, five thousand myriad, five hundred myriad, fifty myriad, and five times fifty myriad. The boundless Three Realms all respond to the five qi and five movements to generate and complete, thus communicating the fifty-five numbers of Heaven and Earth. The three origins above and below all unite the Three Caverns to communicate with the nine emperors and twelve heavens, altogether forming the three origins and thirty-six emperors. The central point and eight directions universally receive the Three Clarities, only responding to the four seasons and thirty-two heavens, the three hundred sixty degrees, to complete the twenty-eight lodges. Though the five movements generate and transform, responding to the origin of the Dao, they divide and correspond to the ordinary, from the eighth division above.

Furthermore, each forms another division below the boundless Three Realms, establishing the nine ramparts and thirty-six earthly emperors. All receive the Three Realms, communicating above with the Three Clarities. On each year’s eight nodes and four seasonal days, they record human good and evil, reporting above to the Three Clarities. Good and evil, transgressions and blessings are calculated and tallied above and below—this communicates from the ninth division above. Below the nine ramparts are the eight gates and nine dark hells; above are the yang examiners, below the yin punishers. Above and below, each nine, also named the eighteen great earthly hells. Beneath these hells is the great wind-marsh qi, resembling wind yet not wind, resembling water yet not water, where suffering dulls perception, distinctions cannot be made, supporting and sustaining the earthly wheel without the slightest tilt—this is from the tenth division above.

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: The Three Caverns communicate transformation, the nine qi intermingle and arise. Heaven has thirty-six bureau lords, Earth has thirty-six administrative offices. The Three Realms descend, the nine qi communicate and arise; the nine ramparts ascend, the Three Realms communicate and respond. One heavenly realm’s domain, two luminaries unite in brightness, three lights descend in unison, four threads are all prepared, the celestial pivot intermingles and unites, governing and encompassing the vast expanse. It broadly covers the gods of generation, responding to qi to bring maturity. The celestial reckoning of the revolving heavens and the degrees of the mysterious passes, the nine-rampart earth gods each form a comparative earth. The Great Year, Great Yin, and Great General, the deities of the year’s virtue, establishment, and destruction.

If there are practitioners who uphold and cultivate the Three Caverns’ Three Clarities’ upper scriptures, they should earnestly entreat the nine earthly numina of the lower realms, that they may not cause harm. Thus, the first earth is named Primal Virtue; its qi is green above and yellow within. It is governed by the Minister of Primal Earth, with a depth of eleven thousand one hundred ten li, where the earthly bureaucracy all resides within. The second earth is August Virtue; its qi is black throughout. It is governed by the Assistant Minister of Primal Court, where the earthly bureaucracy also resides within. The third earth is Imperial Virtue; its qi is blue-green throughout. It is governed by the Tiger-Mouth Earth Dragon, where the earthly bureaucracy also resides within. The fourth earth is Kingly Virtue; its qi is yellow throughout. It is governed by the Great General of Primal Heart Earth. The fifth earth is Human Virtue; its qi is red throughout. It is governed by the Magistrate of Primal Blessing Earth. The sixth earth is Earthly Virtue; its qi is white throughout. It is governed by the Elder of Primal Bone Earth. The seventh earth is Village Virtue; its qi is purple throughout. It is governed by the Six Parents of Beginning Jia. The eighth earth is Returning Virtue; its qi is green throughout. It is governed by the Ancestral Rectifier of Beginning Worth Earth. The ninth earth is Flourishing Virtue; its qi is greenish throughout. It is governed by the Two Thousand Stone Official of the Xuanshi Earth.

The earth officials of the nine lands each oversee earthly offices, communicating above with the twelve divine officials of the comparative earths.

*Upper Clarity’s Most High Scripture of Opening Heaven and Mounting the Dragon, Scrolls Two and Three*

The Fourth Section on the Manifestation of the Dharmakāya of the Supreme Dao and the Primordial Establishment of Marks and Characteristics

At that time, the Yellow Emperor ascended Cloud Terrace Mountain, paid homage to Lord Ning, and inquired about the Three Caverns and their three grades of liberation, as well as the reception of heaven and humanity. He further asked about the realms through which the Three Treasures communicate life, and how these realms connect to the generation of heaven and humanity, how humanity connects to the generation of the Dao, how generation connects to the essence of the Dao, and how the Dao connects to the boundless. All forms and spirits are universally endowed; the Supreme Dao is impartial—how then does its transformative response differ?

Lord Ning replied to the Yellow Emperor: The Three Caverns and Nine Emperors, the Nine Celestial Gates of Life, and the sacred ranks of immortals and perfected beings each possess nine grades and twenty-seven ranks. The graded ranks of the Three Caverns, from mortal to immortal, comprise eighty-one levels, originally established as the Three Vehicles to serve as graded ranks due to the confusion and darkness within the Three Realms.

The Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao, whose merit pervades the ten directions, established the Three Treasures. The Three Honored Ones differ in manifestation, each displaying a distinct trikāya. Thus, during the Dragon Han kalpa, responding to the sacred teaching, he was titled the Heavenly Worthy of the Formless; during the Crimson Brightness kalpa, responding to the true teaching, he was titled the Heavenly Worthy of the Unenlightened; and during the Supreme August kalpa, responding to the immortal teaching, he was titled the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning.

The Three Treasures respond to teachings, the Three Vehicles differ in grade, and the responsive transformation bodies vary in their original and manifested traces. In the primordial Dragon Han kalpa, within the Bright Rosy Clouds Observatory of the Great Luo Heaven, he unfolded the Three Caverns and thirty-six sections, each corresponding to a realm of generation, with thirty-six heavens therein. He expounded the Ten Titles of the Primordial Chaos of Heaven. The mysterious primal qi transformed into the mysterious image, radiant with luminous brilliance, layered in ninefold splendor, and perfectly round in eightfold clarity. From this arose the marks and characteristics, the realms of generation, and the transformation of bodies into humanity. The karmic retribution of heaven and humanity, whether mortal or sage, differs. The trikāya and their marks vary in superior, middle, and inferior grades. The establishment of human spirits all relies upon the transformed body.

Lord Ning told the Yellow Emperor: In the primordial kalpa, the Jade Emperor of the Supreme Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of the Formless, within the Bright Rosy Clouds Observatory of the Great Luo Heaven, expounded the Ten Titles of the Three Caverns’ responsive generation. He spread the Nine Emperors to establish the Nine Heavens, with the sacred ranks of immortals and perfected beings serving as the mysterious ford of the Three Treasures, and the twenty-seven ranks as the cultivation grades of the realms. The thirty-six sections, above, form the mysterious root of the Three Realms, and below, serve as the responsive abodes of the Three Realms and thirty-six heavens. The seventy-two marks manifest the forms of the realms; the eighty-one excellences are the origin of the generation of heaven and humanity. Their ebb and flow, their transformations, pervade the great chiliocosm. Through exhalation and inhalation, they respond with bodies, generating five hundred million beings. The boundless Three Realms stretch infinitely, their realms connecting to the spirit, universally endowed above and below. In each kalpa, they manifest differently, their names and titles varying. Across successive kalpas, their transformation bodies and honored names differ.

The first title is *Yuan* (Source), the source and origin;
The second is *Hun* (Mixed), undifferentiated and inseparable;
The third is *Dun* (Chaotic), vast and uncarved;
The fourth is *Ming* (Abysmal), profound and obscure;
The fifth is *Xing* (Vast), boundless and infinite;
The sixth is *Meng* (Misty), like fine mist;
The seventh is *Hong* (Surging), like billowing waves;
The eighth is *Shi* (Beginning), where the primal qi congeals in the Great Luo;
The ninth is *Yuan* (Primordial), the eldest of virtues;
The tenth is *Xuan* (Mysterious), lord of the upper heavens.

Mysterious beyond the mysterious, the Heavenly Lord, addressed as "Your Majesty," is the supreme origin of generation. Thus, the Heavenly Worthy of the Nameless, from the eighth title *Shi* (Beginning Qi) of the Great Luo, first generated the Jade Clarity, responding with the sacred teaching of the Great Cavern Dharma Gate. Next, from the ninth title *Yuan* (Primordial Qi) of the Jade Clarity, descended the Supreme Clarity, responding with the true teaching of the Cavern Mystery Dharma Gate. Then, from the tenth title *Xuan* (Mysterious Qi) of the Supreme Clarity, descended the Grand Clarity, responding with the immortal teaching of the Cavern Spirit Dharma Gate.

Furthermore, the Three Realms descend from the Three Realms above. The realms respond to one another, the Three Vehicles differ in grade, and the Three Realms guide accordingly, each distinct. The Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity connects below to the Formless Realm; the True Realm of Supreme Clarity connects below to the Form Realm; the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity connects below to the Desire Realm.

Moreover, the Three Caverns generate human spirits, connecting heaven and humanity, harmonizing the nine portals. The Sacred Realm of Jade Clarity generates the upper one of humanity, the Upper Palace of Mud Pill; the True Realm of Supreme Clarity generates the middle one of humanity, the Crimson Palace of the Perfected; the Immortal Realm of Grand Clarity generates the lower one of humanity, the Yellow Court Immortal Palace. Thus, the Primordial King of the Yellow Court below humanity serves as the life-spirit, the master of breath and destiny.

The Dao of immortals governs life, and through life, cultivation is practiced. The word "immortal" (*xian*) means "to ascend" (*qian*); ascending to the Grand Clarity is immortality. Ascending from immortality to perfection enters the Supreme Clarity; ascending from perfection to sageliness enters the Jade Clarity; ascending from sageliness to the Dao enters the Great Luo. The realm of the Supreme Dao is vast, principle congealed in stillness.

*Upper Clarity’s Most High Scripture of Opening Heaven and Mounting the Dragon, Scroll Three*

The Fifth Section on the Primordial Establishment of the Thirty-Six Marks of the Three Caverns as Responded and Expounded by the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning

At that time, the Yellow Emperor, having received and bowed to Lord Ning’s exposition of the Heavenly Worthy’s transformative affairs, further inquired about the origin of the generation of heaven. The mysterious primal qi, the mysterious root of the Three Realms, descends to generate the Three Realms, universally endowing all phenomena. The Ten Titles of the Heavenly Worthy, the origin of the generation of the Three Caverns, the Three Realms and Three Realms above, all universally respond to this influence. The transformative descent of Primordial Beginning responds with marks to complete heaven—since heaven has generation, where lies the gateway of marks?

Lord Ning replied to the Yellow Emperor: In the past, I received the Heavenly Worthy’s decree in the primordial realm of generation within the Great Luo Heaven, unfolding the transformation of forms and spirits. Thus, the Heavenly Emperor was established, the life-essence constructed, and for all great sages, the *Most High Scripture of Opening Heaven* was expounded, with seventy-two marks and three kinds of responsive bodies, eighty-one excellences. Three degrees of transformed bodies descend from origin to trace, gradually manifesting activity. Thus, the dharmakāya is revealed, followed by the sambhogakāya, and then the nirmāṇakāya.

The realms of generation universally endow the responsive bodies. All heavenly and human beings respond to the function of generation, first forming spiritual consciousness and thus possessing the knowing spirit. The mysterious primal qi, the original source of the Three Caverns, the thirty-six sections, and the graded ranks of the realms—within the Jade Capital’s Mysterious Terrace, the Three Caverns respond and complete. Within the Purple Tenuity’s Golden Palace, the nine qi universally establish.

Thus the Dharma-body is revealed to manifest the celestial countenance, its responsive transformations universally pervading the mundane, wherein humans and heavens attain their abodes. The wondrous root of the Three Caverns establishes the radiance of the body, while the realms project form, and responsive conditions arise accordingly.

Unobstructed wondrous eloquence is called the sagely perfected; none surpass the exalted, for this is the form-body. Therefore, the nine transformations are displayed, the ninefold unity shaping form, the four nines universally pervading, comprising thirty-six grades. The thirty-six marks correspond to the three degrees of responsive bodies, liberation from the dust of clamor being the true and ultimate reality.

Wondrous and unobstructed, it responds as the Supreme Unity;
Radiant and unsurpassed, it responds as the August Unity;
Lord of the hundred spirits and sagely ancestor, it responds as the Imperial Unity;
Pure and serene, it responds as the True Unity;
Foremost of the ten thousand virtues, it responds as the Primal Unity;
True sovereign of yin, it responds as the Celestial Unity;
Vacuously pervading and unobstructed, it responds as the Mysterious Unity;
Great lord of longevity, it responds as the Grand Unity;
Dharma-king of the covenant’s majesty, it responds as the Orthodox Unity.

Within these nine unities, the inner display of vacuous function—quiescent and vast, the primal abode—thus manifests as the rare. Vast and unobstructed, it appears as the level; wondrous eloquence without limit responds as the subtle. All-embracing without beyond, universally complete as emptiness; receiving and containing all things, universally pervading as the cavernous; unbounded and unobstructed, it responds as the wondrous non-being.

From this wondrous non-being, responsive teachings gradually manifest, first revealing the spirit of intent, then establishing the spirit of will, and further the spirit of thought. The three thoughts trace their origin, and responsive teachings arise in function. Thus from orthodox wisdom arises true wisdom, and from true wisdom arises expedient wisdom. From this expedient wisdom, the Three Treasures are revealed: essence, spirit, and qi.

Essence is governed by numinous wisdom; spirit, unfathomable, operates through transformation; qi, as configuration, functions through generation. Though their functions differ, they are called the Three, yet their substance is indivisible, hence named the Three-in-One. Within this Three-in-One, three bodies are further revealed: first, the body of form and mind; second, the body of the Three Caverns; third, the body of wondrous virtue.

The body of form and mind: the fundamental body of the quiescent earth, with the True Unity’s wondrous wisdom as its essence. The body of the Three Caverns: the stages of cultivation and ascent, establishing the origin in accord with rank, verifying fruition and ascending position, universally delivering all beings—this is great wisdom. Originally, form is a fetter, obstructing the stages of ascent. From the nine sages downward, all seek advancement in rank; bound by the fetters of desire, they are collectively called possessors of form. When the fetters of the true Dao are exhausted, only the wondrous mind remains.

Those who verify the Dao-fruit possess all virtues; quiescent and invisible, they are called wondrous non-being. When active, they respond and welcome, sharing substance with things, though mind and form are wondrous, they become visible—hence named wondrous being. Through position, retribution is felt; form congeals, ascending the mysterious. Advancing to become an exalted sage, attaining the supreme sagely fruit, forgetting cause and forgetting effect, naturally aligning with true nature, merging with the great Dao, blending indistinguishably with things—none surpass the exalted, thus first called the Heavenly Venerable.

Therefore, from the Heavenly Venerable, responsive bodies gradually manifest, generating realms. The primal qi of the Mysterious Origin universally pervades the radiance of the body; the three qi transform form, unfolding the Three Caverns. The Origin emits blue radiance, ascending to generate heaven; the Primal emits white radiance, arising in the midst to generate humanity; the Mysterious emits yellow radiance, descending to generate earth. From these three colors, the Heavenly Venerable of the Primal Origin generates ninefold radiance, universally emanating the Dharma-body, its luminosity pervasively illuminating.

First generated from chaos, chaos as dark blue radiance;
Chaos generates the cavernous, the cavernous as red radiance;
The cavernous generates the vast, the vast as blue radiance;
The Primal generates the luminous, the luminous as green radiance;
The luminous generates the bright, the bright as yellow radiance;
The bright generates the fleeing, the fleeing as white radiance;
The Mysterious generates the harmonious, the harmonious as purple radiance;
The harmonious generates the flaming, the flaming as azure radiance;
The flaming generates the flowing, the flowing as black radiance.
The ninefold radiance shines brilliantly, suffusing the Dharma-body.

From this ninefold radiance, realms universally arise: above, generating the three realms and thirty-six heavens, manifesting the celestial countenance, vacuously and cavernously luminous; below, generating the three realms and thirty-six emperors, provisionally manifesting responsive bodies, benevolently bestowing the gate of life, gradually and suddenly guiding to tranquility—hence named the Three Caverns and thirty-six marks.

*Upper Clarity’s Most High Scripture of the Heavenly Dragon’s Ascent, Scroll Three*
*The Heavenly Venerable’s Dharma-body Generates the Three Realms and Thirty-six Marks, Chapter Six: The Primal Establishment*

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "Formerly, I received from the Heavenly Venerable on the Great Brahma Heaven the *Scripture of the Primal Establishment of the Heavenly Venerable’s Responsive Generation of Marks*, wherein responsive bodies generate marks, and realms project form. Above, they become the Three Clarities and thirty-six Heavenly Venerables; below, they generate the three realms and thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, thus manifesting the seventy-two marks universally pervading the mundane and sagely.

The retribution of humans and heavens differs. Within the Three Clarities’ upper realms, wondrous quiescence is constant; the nine grades of the mysterious ascent forget merit and verify retribution. Within the three realms, there are beings of perception, deluded thoughts congealing firmly, clinging and indulging. Therefore, thirty-two heavens of responsive interaction are established, provisionally containing yin and yang, universally generating and embracing. The primal qi of the Mysterious Origin, the eight luminaries perfectly radiant, above become the four Brahma heavens at the summit of the three realms.

The Heavenly Venerable, in successive kalpas, unfolds generation, below forming the three realms. Above and below interpenetrate, the thirty-two Heavenly Emperors collectively govern the four eights. The great image interweaves, the nine qi mutually interpenetrate, forming the revolving kalpa. The thirty-two Emperors laterally traverse the celestial pivot, each constituting one heaven of the twenty-eight constellations. The nine heavens layer upon one another, also corresponding to the eight directions and nine palaces of the earth. The heavens of the Four Heavenly Kings interpenetrate above and below, also corresponding to the four directions and four eights of life’s lords. All receive the nine qi, the two halves harmonizing. Origin and trace merge, pervading the thirty-six positions—hence the thirty-six Emperors interpenetrate above and below.

Heaven descends one qi, and the five qi are generated, provisionally containing yin and yang, harmonizing qi to form bodies. Thus yang has lesser yang and greater yang, while yin has lesser yin and greater yin."

Thus within yang, yin becomes Wood; within yang, yang becomes Fire. Within yin, yang becomes Metal; within yin, yin becomes Water. The harmony within harmony becomes Earth.

The qi of lesser yang each constitute one heaven, all forming the Azure Heavens of the nine qi in the East, giving rise to the Great August Yellow-Canopy Heaven and the Great Brightness Jade Sovereign, corresponding to the Orthodox Unity. Within this ninefold unity, the inner reveals its empty function—serene and vast, the primordial aperture—thus manifesting as the rare. Subtle and unobstructed, it appears as the level. Wondrously discerning without fixed form, it responds as the subtle. Vastly encompassing without beyond, it universally pervades as emptiness. Harmoniously receiving and containing, it flows unimpeded as the cavernous. Open and unobstructed, it responds as the wondrously non-existent.

Within this wondrous non-existence, it gradually manifests in accord with the teachings, revealing the intent-spirit, then establishing the will-spirit, followed by the念-spirit. The three念 unfold their traces, responding to the teachings to initiate function. Thus from orthodox wisdom arises true wisdom; from true wisdom arises expedient wisdom. Within this expedient wisdom, the Three Treasures are revealed: essence, spirit, and qi.

Essence is governed by numinous wisdom; spirit is unfathomable, its achievement lying in transformation; qi is the qi-phase, its function in generation. Though their functions differ, they are called the Three; as their substance is indivisible, they are named the Three-in-One.

Within this Three-in-One, three bodies are further revealed: first, the body of form and mind; second, the body of the Three Caverns; third, the body of wondrous virtue. The body of form and mind refers to the quiescent foundation of the self, with the true one’s wondrous wisdom as its essence. The body of the Three Caverns refers to the stages of cultivation, establishing the origin in accord with the ranks, verifying fruition and ascending positions, broadly delivering all beings—this is great wisdom. Originally, form is a fetter, obstructing the stages of ascent. From the Nine Sages downward, all seek to advance in rank. Bound by desires and fetters, all speak of having form; when the fetters of the true Dao are exhausted, only wondrous mind remains.

Verifying the Dao-fruit above, possessing all virtues, quiescent and invisible, it is named the wondrously non-existent. When active, it adapts to encounters, sharing substance with things. Though mind and form are wondrous, they become visible to beings—thus named the wondrously existent. By position, it responds to retribution, forming the ascent to the mysterious. Progressing to ascend as the highest sage, reaching the supreme sagely fruit, forgetting cause and forgetting fruit, naturally aligning with the true nature, merging with the great Dao, blending indistinguishably with things—none surpasses this height, hence it is first called the Heavenly Venerable.

Thus from the Heavenly Venerable, the response-body gradually manifests, generating realms. The primordial qi of the Mysterious, Original, and Beginning pervades the body’s radiance. The three qi transform into forms, unfolding the Three Caverns. The Beginning becomes azure light, ascending to generate heaven; the Original becomes white light, arising in the midst to generate humanity; the Mysterious becomes yellow light, descending to generate earth. From these three hues, the Heavenly Venerable of the Original Beginning coalesces to generate nine lights, universally emanating the Dharma-body, its luminosity penetratingly radiant.

First arising from the Chaotic, the Chaotic becomes deep azure light; from the Chaotic arises the Cavernous, the Cavernous becomes crimson light; from the Cavernous arises the Vast, the Vast becomes azure light; from the Original arises the Luminous, the Luminous becomes green light; from the Luminous arises the Scenic, the Scenic becomes yellow light; from the Scenic arises the Fleeting, the Fleeting becomes white light; from the Mysterious arises the Fusing, the Fusing becomes purple light; from the Fusing arises the Blazing, the Blazing becomes jade-green light; from the Blazing arises the Unfolding, the Unfolding becomes raven-black light. The nine-colored radiance illumines the Dharma-body.

From these nine lights, realms are universally generated: above arise the three realms and thirty-six heavens, revealing the celestial countenance, empty and cavernously luminous; below arise the three realms and thirty-six Emperors, provisionally responding with transformed bodies, bestowing blessings upon the gate of life, gradually and suddenly guiding to tranquility—hence named the Three Caverns and thirty-six forms.

*The Upper Clarity Scripture of the Heavenly Dragon’s Ascent, Scroll Three: The Nine-Colored Treasure Lights, Each Generating Eight Effulgences and Eighty-One Excellence, Establishing the Grades, Seventh Chapter*

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "Formerly, I received from the Heavenly Venerable in the Great Canopy Heaven the *Scripture of the Heavenly Establishment of the Original Grades*, entrusting the body to establish forms. Within the myriad-image Dharma-gate, the inner is quiescent, the Dharma-body responding as the transformed body. The body’s radiance penetrates and shines, manifesting the mysterious and empty, responding to forms to generate heavens, thereby perfecting forms and excellences.

Form is the root, arising from quiescence to proclaim; excellence is the trace, through speech to clarify principle. Through speech to proclaim principle, delivering those with affinity; from principle to entrust speech, guiding and elevating through stages. Thus the manifested body-forms penetrate all heavens; within forms, excellences arise, further revealing the generated body. The nine lights penetrate and shine, above and below universally radiant. The realm is perfectly luminous, universally without obstruction.

The nine heavens layer upon one another, each generating the eight directions, internally containing the nine heavens, with root and trace doubly responding. The eighty-one excellences universally pervade form and spirit; the thirty-six divisions verify affinities without obstruction. The ninefold unity universally transforms, wondrously discerning without fixed form. The nine-colored treasure lights, with the first unity as the principal, the primordial qi of the Mysterious, Original, and Beginning coalesce to generate nine gates. The three appellations each have three, hence the ninefold unity.

The Ultimate Unity’s first sage, the Chaotic becomes deep azure light; the August Unity’s first sage, the Cavernous becomes crimson light; the Imperial Unity’s first sage, the Vast becomes azure light; the Original Unity’s original perfected, the Luminous becomes green light; the True Unity’s original perfected, the Scenic becomes yellow light; the Heavenly Unity’s original perfected, the Fleeting becomes white light; the Mysterious Unity’s mysterious immortal, the Fusing becomes purple light; the Great Unity’s mysterious immortal, the Blazing becomes jade-green light; the Orthodox Unity’s mysterious immortal, the Unfolding becomes raven-black light.

The nine heavens unite in virtue, universally nurturing form and spirit. The eight effulgences are perfectly luminous, the realm universally established. The wondrous unity of the nine heavens, above and below layered in radiance, also corresponds to earth, generating the body of excellence.

The highest of the highest, the first *Ūrdhva-Saṃbhava* Sage Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the first palace of earth, the gate of the nine qi generating life. The first heaven’s lord, all are the wilds of *Ūrdhva-Saṃbhava*, the pure world.

Next, the second *Dhyāna* Goodness Sage Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the second palace of earth, the Heaven of Extended Blessings, the benevolent and tranquil world.

Next, the third *Su-Yāna* Sage Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the third palace of earth, the Heaven of the Great Hall, the world of receiving goodness."

Next, the fourth *Tushita* Perfected Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the fourth palace of earth, the Heaven of No Merit Fields, the world of employing the worthy.

Next, the fifth *Nirmāṇarati* Perfected Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the fifth palace of earth, the Heaven of the Great Hall of Blessings, the central world.

Next, the sixth *Paranirmita-vaśavartin* Perfected Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the sixth palace of earth, the Heaven of Blessing and Virtue, the world of extending worthiness.

Next, the seventh *Brahma-purohita* Immortal Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the seventh palace of earth, the Heaven of the Blessing Hall Province, the world of flourishing conduct.

Next, the eighth *Śubhakṛtsna* Immortal Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the eighth palace of earth, the Heaven of Blessing-Gathered Teachings, the world of enduring peace.

Next, the ninth *Bṛhatphala* Immortal Heaven, also constitutes one heaven, corresponding to the ninth palace of earth, the Heaven of Wanli City, the world of forsaking the worthy.

The nine heavens are layered in tiers, each possessing eight directions, thus forming the eighty-one excellences.

**Chapter Eight: The Original Establishment of the Thirty-Six Forms of the Three Pure Ones’ Response Bodies**

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: In former times, I received the Heavenly Venerable One’s decree in the Great Brahmā Heaven, where I expounded the *Scripture of the Original Establishment of the Primordial* to all the great sages. My body generated seventy-two response forms, ascending to the three realms and thirty-six heavens above, and descending to the three realms and thirty-six emperors below.

The thirty-six divisions constitute the three Caverns’ Dharma gates, the nine grades of transformation, and the ten thousand images’ fundamental source. Born from the primordial origin of heaven, this is called the Heavenly Venerable One, the Supreme Dharma King, styled the Jade Emperor.

The thirty-six divisions form the mysterious ladder of realms; the thirty-six heavens ascend through the three Caverns’ grades.

The primordial *qi* of the Mysterious Origin, triply conjoined, composes the body, its nine-colored precious radiance enveloping this Dharma-form.

At first, the primordial chaotic *qi* coalesced into a verdant light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. This verdant manifestation, flourishing and exuberant, spread its variegated hues, named *Yudan*. Vastly equipped to open and generate life, it responds with boundless forms, verifies fruition, and establishes ranks. Ascending to the Jade Clarity above, its merit and virtue are immeasurable. Having first attained the sagely fruit, it thus establishes the *Yudan* Immeasurable Heaven and the Nine Heavens’ Elder, leader of all virtues.

Thus, the first *Upper Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Formless Pure Subtle Heaven.
Next, the second *Lofty Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Primordial Essence *Pāramārtha* Heaven.
Next, the third *Great Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the □-Colored Immeasurable Virtue *Dhara* Heaven.

Proceeding to the second sequence: the chaotic *qi* generates the Cavern, which becomes a crimson light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the body of meditative goodness, enabling the cultivation of meditative virtue. With boundless lifespan, it is thus named the *Uppermost Meditative Virtue Heaven* and the Nine Heavens’ True King. Perfecting the middle sagely Dao, its blessed retribution is immeasurable, and this heaven is established, its divine transformations wondrous.

Thus, the fourth *Divine Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Mysterious Subtle Upper Void *Yuyu* Heaven.
Next, the fifth *Mysterious Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Mysterious Clarity *Nāgaśiras* Pure Heaven.
Next, the sixth *True Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Brahmā-Conduct *Ketu* Border Pure Heaven.

Proceeding to the third sequence: the Cavern generates the Vast, which becomes a blue light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the elevation of those who cultivate longevity, revealing the three *qi* to open and deliver the obscure and the luminous. Thus named the *Brahmā-Supervisor Xu Yan Heaven* and the Primordial Heavenly King, it penetrates the real and verifies the sagely.

Thus, the seventh *Immortal Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Mysterious Brahmā *Rāga* Pure Bright Heaven.
Next, the eighth *Spiritual Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Primordial Uppermost Spiritual Red Heaven.
Next, the ninth *Supreme Sage Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Great Brahmā-Conduct *Tathā* Heaven.

Proceeding to the fourth sequence: the Primordial generates the Vast, which becomes a green light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests solemn quiescence and soundlessness, broadly accommodating and universally delivering. Its virtuous deeds universally embrace, ascending to advance the Dao’s realm. Thus named the *Quiescent Doushu Heaven* and the Primordial Heavenly King, it establishes true and real wisdom.

Thus, the first *Upper Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Precious Radiance Mysterious Wondrous Heaven.
Next, the second *Lofty Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Flying Brahmā Blessed Virtue Heaven.
Next, the third *Grand Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Void Brahmā Border Pure Heaven.

Proceeding to the fifth sequence: the Vast generates the Scenery, which becomes a yellow light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the practitioner’s joy without arrogance, its blessings and secrecy belonging to them. Thus named the *Unarrogant Joy Heaven* and the Lofty Primordial August Sovereign, teaching the true Dao within.

Thus, the fourth *Divine Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Great Brahmā Near Border Heaven.
Next, the fifth *Mysterious Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Conduct Brahmā Swift Benefit Heaven.
Next, the sixth *Immortal Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Void No Attachment Heaven.

Proceeding to the sixth sequence: the Scenery generates the Reclusion, which becomes a white light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the true Dao’s resonance with sound, thoroughly cultivating the true precepts to prevent confusion and disorder. Some fear the demon kings’ resonant transformations, which follow desires to disturb practitioners. Responding to these forms, it deeply restricts desires, thus revealing this heaven to prevent regression. Thus named the *Cavern Origin Resonant Transformation Heaven*, its heavenly lord is the Void August Jade Emperor, who proclaims the correct conduct.

Thus, the seventh *Heavenly Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Great Brahmā Virtue Heaven.
Next, the eighth *Spiritual Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Brahmā-Conduct *Sudatta* Heaven.
Next, the ninth *Supreme Perfected Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Ultimate Brahmā *Āṭana* Heaven.

Proceeding to the seventh sequence: the Mysterious generates the Fusion, which becomes a purple light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the numinous transformation’s governance, boundless and limitless across the three realms, universally supervising the heavenly passes. All ascend as the middle grade; above, they form the seven origins, universally serving as humanity’s head. Penetrating the seven gates, it is thus named the *Numinous Transformation Brahmā-Assistant Heaven* and the *Wanshi* Primordial Master, universally generating the wondrous chaos. Responding as the immortals’ lord, it governs the gates of life.

Thus, the first *Upper Immortal Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Penetrating Brahmā Virtue Heaven.
Next, the second *Lofty Immortal Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Void Brahmā Wisdom Heaven.
Next, the third *Heavenly Immortal Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Empty Brahmā *Idaṃ* Heaven.

Proceeding to the eighth sequence: the Fusion generates the Flame, which becomes a jade-green light, independent of sun and moon, naturally luminous. It manifests the layered empyrean’s emptiness, lofty and distant, pure and bright, penetratingly illuminating. Its lustrous mirror reflects forms, descending the three origins’ *qi* to generate humanity’s three palaces. Internally, it forms the five viscera, nine palaces, and canopy; above, it corresponds to the golden efflorescence and the heavenly efflorescence palace. Thus named the *Lofty Void Pure Bright Heaven* and the Imperial Perfected, the efflorescence palace’s life origin.

The Purple Void Emperor Lord universally irrigates the living bodies. The people of this heaven, through lofty deeds and conduct, ascend to the layered empyrean above, transcending the three realms. Advancing in immortal grades, they ascend the liberation gate.

Thus, the fourth *Divine Immortal Verification Grade* is revealed, establishing the Conditioned Brahmā Wisdom Entry Heaven.

Next is revealed the fifth *Mysterious Immortal Verification Grade*, establishing the *Mysterious Brahmā Contemplative Wisdom Heaven*. Next is revealed the sixth *Perfected Immortal Verification Grade*, establishing the *Cloud Brahmā Ātāna Heaven*.

Furthermore, the ninth: *Yan* is born from *Yan*, and *Yan* becomes black light. Without relying on sun or moon, it is naturally luminous, demonstrating non-thought and non-desire. It severs the bonds of the womb and eliminates attachment to form, attaining a mind of non-thought and karma without fetters. Those who attain the ultimate fruit ascend to this heaven, hence it is called the *Non-Thought, Non-Fetter, Non-Attachment Heaven*. Its heavenly sovereign is the *Supreme Perfected Jade Emperor*, who expounds the five desires and the illusory emptiness of thoughts and imaginings.

Thus is revealed the seventh *Heavenly Immortal Verification Grade*, establishing the *Cavernous Subtle Containing Heaven*. Next is revealed the eighth *Spiritual Immortal Verification Grade*, establishing the *Mysterious Upper Extinction-Nothingness Heaven*. Next is revealed the ninth *Ultimate Immortal Verification Grade*, establishing the *Utmost Form Ruo Na Heaven*.

The ninefold unity corresponds to the body, manifesting the *Response Body*. The three caverns interpenetrate form, unfolding the thirty-six sections, responding to the three realms and thirty-six heavens. From non-being to being, gradually entrusted to language, yet not abiding in being—its nature is unimpeded. This is called the *Response Body’s Thirty-Six Aspects*.

*The Highest Clarity Scripture of the Celestial Dragon’s Ascent*, Scroll Four
*The Heavenly Worthy’s Response and Descent: The Primordial Establishment of the Three Realms and Thirty-Six Aspects*, Chapter Nine

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: In the ancient *Dragon Han* kalpa, the *Primordial Beginning* unfolded the chart. Without form or name, the *Heavenly Worthy* in the *Great Veil Heaven* above generated the *Three Clarities* and thirty-six heavens, and below generated the *Three Realms* and thirty-six emperors. His body emitted five-colored *Response Transformation Body* lights, and for the various heavenly emperors, he expounded the *Scripture of the Primordial Establishment of the Heavenly Origin*.

First were established the *Four Brahmā Northern Perfected Upper Heavens*, serving as the *Eastern Florescence*, *Western Numinous*, and *Southern Ultimate*. The four heavens were layered, their four threads interwoven, each generating eight luminous scenes. Four times eight interflow, thus forming the four times eight thirty-two heavens. Internally containing the four *Brahmā* and thirty-six aspects, responding to the ten titles, they entrust their traces to the various heavens:

1. *Self-So*, the root of all things;
2. *Without Limit*, unfathomable in its depth;
3. *Great Dao*, universally embracing and nurturing;
4. *Utmost Perfected*, true and utterly pure;
5. *Supreme*, utmost in greatness and height;
6. *Venerable Lord*, responding across the ages;
7. *Lofty Emperor*, radiant and supremely exalted;
8. *Heavenly Worthy*, the honored one among heavens;
9. *Jade Emperor*, the noble and honored lord of jade;
10. *Your Majesty*, the supreme lord of all heavens.

None is higher above; among heavens, none is more honored. The title *Your Majesty* admits no surpassing. Seventy-two aspects illuminate above and below; eighty-one excellences radiate boundlessly. Above, there are no four emperors; below, the four directions are complete. The four *Brahmā* interflow to generate, establishing four threads. Four heavens, each with eight gates, totaling thirty-two. Combining the central four nines yields thirty-six grades.

Thus, the wondrous *qi* of the *Upper Three Clarities* and nine heavens descends to generate the *Three Realms*. The nine [missing character] respond to generation. From the first above, the *Yūdāna Immeasurable First Upper Heaven*, born from *Hun*, *Hun* as azure hue, above it coalesce the four *Brahmā* and *Great Clarity* heavens. Next are born the four persons, generating twenty-two thousand two hundred *qi*, forming the *Great Ultimate Level Nurturing Jia Yi Heaven*. The people of this heaven live for one trillion nine hundred thirty-two billion seven hundred thirty-five million two hundred eighty thousand three hundred twenty million years.

Above it generate fifty-five thousand *qi*, forming the *Great Void Utmost Constant Fusion Heaven*.

Next is the sixth *Cavern Origin Transformative Responsive Sound Heaven*. From this heaven, *qi* gradually flows downward, *Jing* born from *Dun*, *Dun* as white hue.

As forms and appearances are already exhausted, and color and shape are no more, they preserve heart-consciousness and enter *qi*-contemplation, thus ascending to the *Abyssal Penetration Primordial Cavern Heaven*. This is the formless realm, where all gross colors are absent; in contrast to the lower realms, it retains only the six subtle dusts—color, sound, fragrance, taste—without bodily touch, hence it receives the retribution of the four heavens above the three realms.

*Upper Clarity Highest Supreme Unfolding Heaven Dragon-Steed Scripture*, Scroll Four
*Nine Capitals Nine Mountains Interconnected Birth of Celestial and Human Eighty-One Perfections: Primal Establishment Chapter Tenth*

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: "I once received from the Heavenly Worthy, in the Great Veil Heaven, the *Highest Supreme Unfolding Heaven Primal Establishment Chapter Scripture*, wherein the responsive body generates perfections, universally extending forms and images. Thus, the Dharma-body is revealed, responding to beings and establishing categories, descending to be born in the boundary of the Ford of Life, interpenetrating the Three Clarities’ sacred realms.

The Mountain of Jade Capital possesses ten tiers, each with its own name: first, *Canopy Heaven’s Summit Mountain*; second, *Vast Mystery Upper Mountain*; third, *Veil Mystery Cavern-Emptiness Mountain*; fourth, *Lofty Supreme Perfected Origin Mountain*; fifth, *Multitude of Treasures Dark-Kalpa Blade Mountain*; sixth, *Formless Great Awakening Mountain*; seventh, *Circumambulating Cavern Mystery Mountain*; eighth, *Scenic Florescence Grand Perfected Mountain*; ninth, *Inconceivable Mountain*; tenth, *Grand Mystery Capital Jade Capital Grand Mountain*.

The highest tier of the mountain is the canopy of the Three Clarities Heaven, governing the entirety of the Veil of Mystery. Above it is the Mysterious Terrace, while below the nine tiers correspond to the nine heavens, each generating the eight directions’ nine *qi* celestial barriers, blending into nine nines—eighty-one palaces."

Within, the Heavenly Venerable manifests with perfect bodily form, universally generating the Great Existence to cultivate both form and spirit. The realm’s boundaries share the same dharma-image as heaven and humanity. The mountain’s heights and distant peaks are difficult to ascend by land, yet the radiance of the Seven Treasures reveals no obstructions. Thirty-six Emperors and nine-colored streaming luminosities shine forth, while the Jade Capital’s heavenly canopy displays the ascended summit-visage.

This mountain’s responsive transformation universally generates heaven and humanity, descending to give birth to the Three Realms. Above, it becomes the Four Brahmā Heavens; below, it generates and transforms the Thirty-Two Heavens, which in turn constitute the Three Realms. At the heart of each heaven stands a Mysterious Terrace.

The Upper Palace of Kunlun is also called the Jade Capital. The mountain of the Mysterious Capital, with its ninefold golden walls, governs the nine *qi* below. Twelve jade towers stand, and the Eight Sceneries hold their domains, each presiding over a heaven. The Four *Qi* engender tranquility, with the Heavenly Pillar at their center, ascending to connect with the Celestial Barrier. The total *qi* of the Upper Prime divides into thirty-five parts, converging as the revolving mechanism of the Six Hundred Life-Masters. It also generates the human head, whose form mirrors Kunlun, governing the Three Palaces. Nine portals compose the body, while the Three Primes and Eight Sceneries each furnish the spirits of life. The Five Movements and Seven Primes form the body’s floral canopy. Below, the kidneys’ watery essence flows far to the Numinous Barrier, where the divine tortoise breathes, stirring clouds and rain—all endowed with the Jade Capital Kunlun’s life-bestowing excellence.

**The Primordial Beginning’s Transformation of Form: Establishing the Three Clarities and Thirty-Six Aspects, Chapter the Eleventh**

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: In former times, I received the Heavenly Venerable One’s mandate in the Great Luo Heaven, where I expounded the *Scripture of the Primordial Establishment of Heaven’s Origins* as the Emperor of All Heavens. Borne in form and manifesting appearance, I left traces of my realm’s boundaries.

The Mysterious Primordial qi, shared by the Nine Sages in their entirety, perfected the seventy-two aspects throughout gods and humans, their nine-colored bodily radiance penetrating and illuminating all with clarity. The upper section undergoes nine transformations, its three realms interflowing in form; the middle section’s nine apertures interlink with the Nine Ones in transformation; the lower section’s nine names interflow with the Nine Lands in spirit. The thirty-six aspects reveal themselves through the Three Palaces.

The head mirrors the Great Luo, perfectly interpenetrating without obstruction. The brain contains nine palaces, corresponding to the nine heavens’ responsive forms. The heart holds nine apertures, through which the Nine Sages perceive with luminous clarity. The lower section’s nine names correspond to the descending bodily forms.

As for the brain’s nine palaces:
The first is the Supreme August Palace, where the Most High Lord and Queen reside;
The second is the Jade Emperor’s Palace, where the Jade Clarity Divine Lord resides;
The third is the Heavenly Court Palace, where the Upper Clarity Divine Lord resides;
The fourth is the Ultimate Perfection Palace, where the Supreme Ultimate Divine Lord resides;
The fifth is the Mysterious Cinnabar Palace, where the Perfected Lord resides;
The sixth is the Flowing Pearl Palace, where the Divine Immortals reside;
The seventh is the Cinnabar Field Palace, where the Upper Prime’s Red Child, the True Person and Imperial Lord, and the Minister of the Heavenly Emperor reside;
The eighth is the Grotto Chamber Palace, where on the left dwells the Peerless Lad, on the right the White Prime Lord, and in the center the Yellow Elder’s Three Hun reside;
The ninth is the Hall of Brightness Palace, where on the left dwells the Bright Youth Perfected Official, on the right the Bright Maiden Perfected Official, and in the center the Bright Mirror Perfected Official.

The Great One True Person is the brain’s essence, generating humanity’s Three Primes and the nine palaces’ life-spirits.

The middle Crimson Palace’s heart holds nine apertures, interlinked with the Nine Perfected. The Middle Prime True Person dwells in its central palace, where the Cinnabar Sovereign and the August Minister jointly govern the Crimson Palace, upholding the Way of the Crimson Palace’s Nine Perfected. Harmonizing with all things, they manifest as the Utmost Person; transforming without limit, they manifest as the Sage; in true purity and wondrous transformation, they manifest as the Perfected Person; universally delivering and ascending, they manifest as the Immortal; in unimpeded divine penetration, they manifest as the Divine Person; penetrating existence and nonexistence, they manifest as the Numinous Person; in wondrous discernment and subtle penetration, they manifest as the Worthy Person; embracing the Dao and cherishing virtue, they manifest as the Dao Person; in meritorious deeds and universal salvation, they manifest as the Practitioner.

The heart’s nine apertures generate nine persons, nine kinds of universal penetration, completing the middle aspect’s single form.

The Lower Prime’s Infant guards the Primordial Yang Palace, enthroned as the Yellow Court’s Primordial King. On the right, the Protector Minister guards the Lower Prime’s Yellow Court Palace. The Peach Vitality Lord’s essence interflows with the mysterious image of purple auroras, threefold encircling yellow clouds, fourfold binding the womb’s embryo, master of the Life Gate’s life-spirits. Above, it interlinks with the nine heavens; below, with the nine earths. Within, it generates the body’s nine spirits, above which are nine persons, arrayed in threes. On the left is Han Zhong, on the right Fan Li, and in the center the Great Accomplished Master. The left kidney is the Minister of Instruction, the right kidney the Minister of Works, and in the center the Great One Lord. On the left is the Azure Waist Jade Maiden, on the right the White Simplicity Jade Maiden, and in the center the Mysterious Radiance Jade Maiden.

The Mysterious Radiance Jade Maiden is the Dao’s primordial qi, mother of generation and completion. Descending qi to the lower womb’s palace, the Three Clarities’ wondrous transformations and nine qi’s descent of spirits generate humanity’s Three Palaces and twenty-seven positions, internally uniting the nine spirits and thirty-six aspects.

**The Primordial Beginning’s Transformation of Form: Generating the Three Realms and Thirty-Six Aspects, Chapter the Twelfth**

Ning Jun addressed the Yellow Emperor, saying: In former times, I received the Heavenly Venerable One’s mandate in the Great Luo Heaven, where I expounded the *Scripture of the Primordial Establishment of Heaven’s Origins*. Borne in form and manifesting appearance, I responded with bodily generation in heaven, unfolding the transformation of human spirits and universally extending manifest images.

Above, as the Three Clarities’ formless transforming lords, the thirty-six Heavenly Venerables descend to generate the Three Realms’ responsive transformations, establishing the forms of the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors. The two luminaries interflow in motion, the Five Unions generate and complete, each becoming the Heavenly Pass and Heavenly Sovereign Great Emperor, the Eastern Culmen’s Central Stellar Center. I serve as their foremost, father of humanity’s generation.

From the Dao’s father and mother, entrusted with karmic conditions, I lodged in yin and yang’s transformations to complete bodily existence. Azure Yang’s primordial qi becomes the Supreme Yang’s essence, the Eastern King Father. The Supreme Harmony’s qi becomes the Yin’s essence, the Western Queen Mother. Above, it binds the Four Brahmās, the Three Realms’ crown of heaven; below, it governs Kunlun, above interlinking with the nine qi. Ninefold golden walls, twelve jade towers, universally govern the two luminaries and the Four Movements’ [missing characters].

Above, it generates the human eye, interlinking with the sun and moon’s radiance; below, it generates the two breasts, where the sun and moon converge. Day and night ascend and descend, fortune and misfortune alternate, heaven and humanity share the Dao, though dark and manifest differ in appearance.

The Three Clarities’ Three Venerables, the Imperial One and Great One’s Imperial Lords and other spirits universally generate gods and humans, all endowed with qi and image. The boundless wondrous unity congeals as the Purple Chamber, the heavenly kingly qi above becoming the brain’s essence. The head, round in imitation of heaven, the crown as the Mysterious Canopy, is the hundred spirits’ numinous ancestral seat and the body’s dwelling. The fluid mountain springs are the body’s life-master; the head is the lofty terrace, mirroring heaven’s Kunlun. Hair is the Hall of Brightness, where morning stars descend in essence; the brain holds nine palaces, interlinked with the Three Clarities. The face is the foot’s dwelling, the Perfected Person’s palace, above interlinking with the seven portals, the Seven Primes’ mutual communication. The body is the jade tree, the feet the earthly pass, the mouth the heart’s pass, the hands the heavenly pass. Eyebrows are the White Prime, humanity’s floral canopy, above as the convergence point uniting the Three Primes.

The Imperial Lord’s generative qi nurtures the divine youths; the left and right Perfected Persons interlink radiance and penetrate vision. From this, the Great One interlinks with the sun and moon’s spirits, the left as the King Father, whose solar radiance nourishes the body, the right as the Queen Mother, whose lunar radiance stabilizes the form. The nose is the heavenly gate, interlinking with heaven’s jade fluids, the Golden Treasury’s realm, the spirit’s gate and portal.

Above clasping the sun and moon, returning to the Central Dipper, within the Celestial Palace lies the jade pivot and balanced armillary. The mouth is the Crimson Palace, the heart’s vermilion abyss; the tongue is the numinous root, golden key of the five tones.

The Lord of Non-Flourishing is the Longevity Dragon’s axle; the teeth are the flourishing embryo, the Stomach Palace’s mighty blade. The ears are the Imperial Lord, gateway of resonant acuity; the throat is the Mysterious Pass, essence of the Pool of Responsibility.

Receiving the talisman and descending further, transmitting it to the Great Granary: the intestines are the City of Qi, the abdomen the Township of Qi; the kidneys are the Mysterious Valley, corresponding above to the Southern Dipper. The large intestine coils thirty-six folds, life endowed by the thirty-six heavens. The small intestine measures twenty-four feet in each, universally sensing the eight luminaries and twenty-four emperors.

The primordial qi of the Lower Prime is the Grand Herald; the primordial qi of the Middle Prime is the eighty-one primordial officers; the original qi of the Upper Prime is the High Chariot Envoy, communing with the Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens of Highest Sovereign.

The gallbladder is the Celestial Son, Lord of the Great Dao; the spleen is the August Empress, Noble Lady; the heart is the Grand Commandant; the left kidney is the Minister of Education; the right kidney is the Minister of Works. The liver is the Azure Yang Eastern Palace, refining the Three Hun in the Orchid Terrace Mansion; the lungs are the Jade Hall Western Palace, refining the Seven Po in the Chancellery Mansion; the heart is the Crimson Palace, Vermilion Bird Pass Gate, Primordial Yang Mansion; the kidneys are the Northern Culmen’s Mysterious Pass, Dark Warrior’s Inner Gate, Mysterious Prosperity Palace of Supreme Harmony; the spleen is the Hall of Light Palace, Gate of the Inner Attendants’ Ministry, Palace of Primordial Simplicity—within lies the Celestial Son’s Great Granary, my dwelling.

The gallbladder is the Purple Tenuity Palace, Boundless Mansion; the stomach is the Upper Sea, where sun and moon lodge; the navel is the Lower Sea, where sun and moon alternate. Within resides the spirit’s image: breath and flowing qi generate wind and rain, circulating through the four limbs, reaching everywhere without fail. Beside the navel lie five cities, spirits of the five viscera. Twelve vermilion towers correspond to the twelve branches; externally dwell eight spirits, guardians of the eight luminaries’ knowledge, internally generating the human body, corresponding to heaven’s eight seasons.

The Three Burners’ six spirits—Left Millet and Right Sacrifice, Wind Earl and Rain Master, Thunder Duke and Lightning—serve as the awakening shock to rouse the spirit of perception. Above and below, yin and yang; sun and moon alternate lodging. The Kunlun’s Weak Waters gleam darkly, profoundly abstruse, an unfathomable abyss. The sun and moon’s course: thus heaven’s sun by day shines down upon the earth, and all things receive its light. Humans emulate this: by day the sun shines down upon the navel’s base, so all things receive its light; by night the sun rests in the stomach, shining upward into the chest, where myriad spirits sport and converse—human perception intermingles, hence arise dreams.

Thus the Three Caverns’ primordial original qi, threefold union generating spirit: the Upper Prime’s original qi generates the human’s Upper One, beneath the floral canopy in the Muddy Pellet’s Upper Palace, the Upper Crimson Child, communing above with heaven’s qi, enthroned as the Brain Essence, Muddy Pellet Heavenly Emperor. To the right dwells the Imperial Minister, guarding the Upper Palace’s Three Hun and Seven Po, arriving every five days to receive affairs. The Crimson Palace’s primordial qi generates the Middle Prime’s Perfected Person, born in the human’s Central Palace; to the right dwells the Assistant August Minister, jointly governing the Central Palace, presiding over the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, bones, five interiors, Three Hun, and Seven Po, arriving every three days to receive affairs. The Yellow Court’s primordial qi generates the Lower Prime’s Infant, guarding the Primordial Yang Palace, enthroned as the Yellow Court’s Primordial King; to the right dwells the Guardian and Stabilizing Minister, jointly guarding the Gate of Life’s fluid spirits, Three Hun, and Seven Po, arriving thrice daily to receive affairs.

The Three Caverns’ flowing distribution, nine qi structuring form, thirty-six heavens together nourishing the body’s phases. Hair is the Azure City Lord; the head is the Three Terraces Lord; the two eyebrows are the Eight Poles Lord; the two eyes are the Mysterious Clarity Lord; the left ear is the Acute Hearing Lord; the right ear is the Decisive Clarity Lord; the nose is the Heavenly Gate Lord; the mouth is the Tooth Gate Lord; the lips are the Jade Gate Lord; the teeth are the Twenty-Eight Poles’ Primordial Officer Lords; the tongue is the Primordial Culmen Lord; the throat is the Commandant Lord; the larynx is the Nine Ministers Lord; the liver is the Crimson Palace Lord; the lungs are the Mysterious Clarity Lord; the gallbladder is the Longevity Lord; the heart is the Cinnabar Field Lord; the vessels are the Purple Silk Lord; the stomach is the Great Granary Lord; the spleen is the Yellow Court Lord; the left kidney is the Mysterious Wonder Lord; the right kidney is the Primordial Rectitude Lord; the large intestine is the Great Granary Lord; the small intestine is the Guiding and Conducting Lord; the abdomen is the Great Dao Lord; the Three Burners are the Mysterious Elder Lord; the left foot is the Small Chariot Lord; the right foot is the Lingering Lord; the left sole is the Thunder and Lightning Lord; the right sole is the Cloud and Qi Lord.

The Heavenly Worthy declares: The thirty-six Lords of Generative Qi correspond to and arise within my body, universally planting heaven and human, jointly nourishing perception and function. The Heavenly Worthy declares: Should one suffer distress or illness, fear and unease, recite and invoke the Generative Spirits—sages descend, spirits approach, the generative Dao augments, life’s end is further extended. If one knows the source of generation, obscurely communing with the upper realms, heaven and human interlink, above sensing the mysterious root, the eight luminaries’ mirror shines clearly, the nine heavens’ perception connects, the body’s spirits respond, the shadow follows the form. Secret thoughts breed transgressions, calamity strikes from without; karmic retribution of sin and fortune is precise to the finest detail.

The Dharma Gate of Realms arises as thought follows the heart; to seek the mysterious path, advance step by step before the sun. With mind serene and spirit clear, the Dao flows unimpeded.

*Upper Clarity’s Highest Sovereign’s Scripture of the Heavenly Dragon’s Soaring, Scroll Five*
*The Primordial Beginning’s Transformation Body: Communing with the Generative Realm and Planting the Eighty-One Human Perfections, Chapter Thirteen*

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor: “Formerly, I received from the Heavenly Worthy in the Great Network Heaven the *Scripture of the Primordial Beginning’s Establishment of Perfections*, the Primordial Beginning’s responsive embodiment, the Dharma Gate of myriad images, the Three Caverns’ and Nine Emperors’ generative body’s dharma dwellings, the Three Realms’ and Three Treasures’ connection to the nine heavens’ nine humans. The Three Vehicles’ universal resonance corresponds to this dharma body, universally preparing the ten directions, entrusting qi to transform form, all endowed with perfected images.”

Thus the responsive transformation body, wondrously unified in oneness, is one with Heaven in Heaven, one with humanity in humanity, and one with Earth on Earth. In mutual resonance with the wondrous oneness, the two halves generate spirit.

The Three Origins first divide, and the Eight Sceneries take distinct forms. The Upper One scatters into the Twenty-Four Perfected, the Middle One into the Twenty-Four Spirits, and the Lower One into the Twenty-Four Worthies. The Three Origins, Eight Sceneries, and Seventy-Two Spirits follow the Seventy-Two Directions Scripture in their transformations. Each of the Three Heavens has Twenty-Four Emperors, internally containing the Nine Palaces and Eighty-One, thus responding to the nine nines to generate their perfections.

The Upper Origin’s Eight Sceneries belong to the Cavern Real Department, the Middle Origin’s Eight Sceneries to the Cavern Mystery Department, and the Lower Origin’s Eight Sceneries to the Cavern Spirit Department. The Three Departments’ Eight Sceneries and Twenty-Four Spirits precisely correspond to the Twenty-Four Qi. Qi also becomes spirit, and spirit also becomes qi. Scattered, they form clouds and mist; gathered, they become form and shadow. Emerging, they are creation and transformation; entering, they are the True One.

Above, they bind the Three Origins; below, they bind the myriad things. The transformations of spirit and the Perfected have no fixed names. Among the hundred spirits, all are completed through the virtue of the Three Caverns’ threefold union.

The supreme realm of Heaven and Earth’s Twenty-Four Emperors precisely corresponds to the Twenty-Four Qi of the lower regions. Each of the Twenty-Four Emperors possesses Three Origins, totaling Seventy-Two Origins. Each Origin has Five Spirits, generating the Three Realms’ Three Hundred Sixty Spirits, which combine into Sixty-Four Brahma Qi. The mixed qi forms the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors.

Thus, one heaven generates Three Hundred Sixty Spirits, and one person has Three Hundred Sixty bones. Above, the Three Palaces generate humanity’s Twenty-Seven Heavenly Passes; in the middle, the Three Palaces generate humanity’s Twenty-Seven Spirit Mechanisms; below, the Three Palaces generate humanity’s Twenty-Seven Numinous Joints. Interpenetrating the Three Origins, they total Eighty-One. Through this dharma image, form and spirit are planted, the Dao is penetrated to generate fluid, and numinous consciousness first takes shape. Thus, they respond to generate humanity’s Eighty-One Perfections.

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor: “Formerly, I received from the Primordial Beginning Heavenly Worthy the exposition of the Three Caverns’ body, light, and auspicious marks, the responsive transformation that universally generates the Seventy-Two Marks. Root and trace are doubly manifest: above, they generate the Three Realms’ boundless merit, adorned with the Thirty-Six Marks of virtuous power; below, they generate the Three Realms’ karmic responses, revealing the good and evil life-roots of sentient beings.

Following karmic conditions and dwelling-places, they respond to the Three Realms’ Thirty-Six Marks. The realms universally respond, demonstrating to humans and heavens the Three Bodies, each displaying the Seventy-Two Marks. Internally, the Three Caverns are illuminated to plant the spirit; externally, the universal generation first responds to the celestial body. Through this celestial image, the human form is universally generated, planting the black-haired people. All examine the Three Caverns’ Thirty-Six Gates, generating the spirit-consciousness and the Thirty-Six Marks.

The Three Caverns’ universal mystery manifests the Seventy-Two Marks. The realms interpenetrate, forming the Eighty-One Perfections. The nine nines transform to generate the Three Bodies’ responsive marks. Threefold universal resonance all arises from the nine ones, generating the Nine Heavens’ Nine-Colored Treasure Lights. These interpenetrate as Nine Gates, pervading these realms, universally preparing the Great Void. All respond to the Dao’s source, forming the function of consciousness. Externally, they interpenetrate the mysterious images—all are transformation bodies. Internally, in quiescent emptiness, they interpenetrate—this is my true nature.”

At that time, the Yellow Emperor bowed and received Lord Ning’s teaching, then inquired about the Great Dao’s universal generation of humanity.

Lord Ning expounded the Upper Proclamation of the Jade Emperor’s celestial transformation body, the responsive marks that form humanity, the Three Caverns’ transformation of form, the Nine Heavens’ union of virtue, the interpenetration of heaven and humanity, the equal advent of dharma images, the wondrous oneness’ shared nourishment, the Five Virtues’ complete preparation, and the essential secrets of Heaven’s Opening. He resolved doubts, dispelled obstructions, and illuminated the Cavern Mystery’s ford, drawing near to respond to distant resonances.

Again, the Yellow Emperor respectfully inquired of Lord Ning: “The Three Caverns’ sagely path, the Primordial Beginning’s universal generation—heaven interpenetrates humanity, humanity interpenetrates the Dao. Cultivating virtue and the Dao to refine the Real—where lies the mysterious pass?”

Lord Ning replied: “The spirit talismans proclaim the mandate; the myriad emperors all pay homage. Wearing and serving the talismans, the Three Caverns universally open. The Nine Lands protect and elevate; the Eight Sceneries shape the form. The sagely realm’s true homeland—secretly ascend and proceed there.

You may carefully listen and receive my *Soaring Talisman*. Ascending emptiness and entering nonbeing all begin here. This scripture is the path, the reason for pursuing the Dao. The talisman is the mysterious pivot, the dharma gate for entering the Dao.”

The Yellow Emperor bowed in gratitude, then respectfully inquired: “The celestial marks of birth, the responsive images forming the body—spirit purified, body luminous, the urgency of entering the Dao. Aspiring to the immortal path, I wish to behold the treasure scripture. I am fortunate to approach your numinous countenance and receive your sagely gaze. I humbly request to receive and uphold it, to reverently cultivate the secret instructions.”

Lord Ning addressed the Yellow Emperor: “The Primordial Beginning’s responsive marks, the realm’s bestowed form—heaven and humanity interpenetrate, karmic power follows resonance. The Nine Heavens’ responsive transformations are not uniform. The Nine Grades’ superior persons all differ in bone and mark, with variations in weight and gravity. Karmic responses are without error. Those with prior mysterious names first possess immortal marks.

Your former lives held wisdom; blessings extend to this life. Ascending the immortal ranks, receive this register from me. The Great Dao is without image; responsive marks establish form. Responsive marks generate heaven—this is called the mark-body.

All who study the immortal Dao cannot immediately succeed; all rely on prior conditions. Immortal marks respond later. The *Dragon’s Soaring Talisman*—the cloud net soars, ascending emptiness and entering nonbeing, riding qi and driving dragons, ascending to the Jade Emperor. The Primordial Beginning proclaims the mandate; the Most High proclaims it, only then dispatching me to transmit it.

Now I proclaim the Dao and expound the scripture for you. Responding to resonance, you see me—yet I am not present. The Dao interpenetrates without bounds. I bestow upon you the treasure chapter. The immortal register interpenetrates heaven; heaven also interpenetrates you. Responding to what is fitting, your name is raised for the future. First receive your talisman—this is the mandate’s confirmation.

Spirit talismans and spirit registers are the Gate of the Primordial Heaven’s Mandate. Spirit seals and spirit scriptures—the Three Heavens proclaim the beginning. With focused mindfulness, swallow and serve them. The Six Talismans attain perfect clarity. Wear the numinous chart. The Seven Origins universally open. The Nine Heavens command and summon; the Nine Lands memorialize names. Spirit ascends to heaven; scripture and Dao are doubly manifest.

Talismans and scriptures have distinct names; their transmission and explanation differ. Next, the *Soaring Talisman* is separately recorded. It may be transmitted to later generations’ sagely lords of the Dao. Secretly cultivate it—it is not bestowed upon the unworthy.”
