The Golden Flower Heavenly Worthy decrees,
The Scripture of Extending the True and Saving from Calamity.
The Perfect and Boundless Dao,
The Most Exalted Honor of the Void Sovereign.
Ever concealed, ever saving from calamity,
Arising in the *ren* cycle of time.
Samādhi and the Nine True Forms,
The Great Cavern stirs with transcendent radiance.
Driving out the qi of rebellion and perversity,
The True Dao saves the multitude of beings.
In the kalpa’s meeting of life and death,
Good and evil’s karmic reckoning is apportioned.
The Primordial August Jade Emperor commands,
To examine and record all under heaven.
The virtuous transcend the Three Realms,
Even demon kings come to pay homage.
Those with transgressions sink into the Nine Hells,
Enduring ten thousand kalpas in the nether darkness.
All heavens jointly examine and judge,
Not a hairbreadth escapes concealment.
When the Pure and Void descends in due time,
The myriad immortals are scrutinized.
The Primordial Flower’s True and Great Dao,
In the final kalpa, petty men belittle it.
The clever and self-satisfied are abandoned,
Those who revere and trust encounter it and succeed.
Blue lotuses bloom across the land,
Plucked even from the mire.
Saint and mortal alike have their allotted portion,
How can one speak of noble or poor?
Those with affinity must reverently receive it,
Upon encounter, they will attain the Golden Body.
All under heaven hear the Orthodox Dao,
All descend to dwell in the mortal dust.
Vying to obtain the title of Golden Heaven,
All seek the indestructible cause.
Thus, when yin and yang are in discord,
Heaven darkens and earth is shrouded in chaos.
Demons of the Six Caverns emerge,
Monstrous fiends of the Nine Heavens arise.
The Six Harmonies achieve completion,
Water and fire naturally intermingle.
All is a vast, undifferentiated whole,
Each seeking the true within.
Fire forges and refines the true essence,
Rebellious and perverse demons collapse.
The pure and unadulterated child of yin and yang,
Radiant essence coalesces into the True Person.
The Primordial One forms the śarīra,
Impurities are transformed into dust.
Within it lies numinous efficacy,
Slaying the myriad demonic hordes.
The Seven Emperors receive the Primordial Mandate,
The Pivot descends to the Purple Court.
Breaking martiality, humbling civil fortune,
The vastly greedy become imperial perfected ones.
The true light of the Five Virtues shines,
Demons and fiends lose their power.
The thunderbolt triumphs in the Southern Cinnabar,
The True One of the Northern Pole’s Breaking Army.
The White Emperor’s Son of the West,
The Life-Protecting Lord of the Eastern Realm.
The Heavenly Primordial of the Center,
Striking lightning to dispel demonic miasma.
Heavenly might aligns with the Grand Year-Star,
Thunderous generals number in the billions.
Feathered ones manifest their golden bodies,
Wielding whips to protect the auspicious.
The Celestial Stem drives out filth and evil,
Ten thousand times ten thousand slay demonic forms.
The Martial Ancestor of the Golden Flower decrees,
The Eight Trigrams assist the divine soldiers.
*Qian*’s primordial and *Kun*’s responsive virtue,
*Zhen* and *Xun*’s thunderous winds.
*Gen* crushes demonic fiends to dust,
*Li* burns the hundred monstrous evils.
*Dui*’s marsh flows for ten thousand miles,
*Kan*’s auspiciousness guards the heavenly people.
The Celestial Stem and the Vast Heaven decree,
Recitation and wearing ensure no cause for disaster.
Those with affinity who encounter it,
Must swiftly and diligently practice.
Those without affinity will surely perish,
Prepared to be transformed into yellow dust.
Divine response is swift as lightning,
The receiver must not treat it lightly.
Recite and uphold with unwavering heart,
Close your doors to witness purity and peace.
Before your eyes lies the *ren-chen* Dao,
On land, one ascends to the clouds.
The foolish and deluded remain utterly unaware,
Slandering and recklessly inviting misfortune.
Stubborn and closed-hearted fools,
Bear guilt for obstructing this wondrous scripture.
This is the Heavenly Primordial Dharma,
Encountered once in ten thousand kalpas.
Those who meet it transcend the Three Realms,
Never again descending into the mortal dust.
Birth and extinction are without distinction,
Only by venerating the Scripture of Salvation from Calamity.
Hearing the supreme words of the decree,
I bow my head and pay homage to the Merciful Worthy.
The unobstructed and non-active body,
Serenely passes through blades and weapons.
I bow my head to the Seven Primordial Heavenly Star Lords,
Swiftly come to save from calamity and protect the heavenly people.

I am the Son of the Blue Lotus,
Grandson of the Primordial August Dao Ancestor.
The Celestial Stem comes to aid me,
The Seven Emperors guard my body.
The Eight Trigrams are my divine power,
Ten thousand misfortunes are transformed into [nothingness].
Ascending mountains, I traverse mighty realms,
Crossing waters, I lead yin to follow.
When I go forth, the Mandate of Heaven protects me,
Entering battle, the Nine Radiance Army surrounds me.
Those who follow me attain the True Dao,
Those who oppose me are destroyed in their rebellious forms.
Swiftly, swiftly, by the Golden Flower’s decree,
The Vast Heaven’s Jade Emperor’s scripture.
