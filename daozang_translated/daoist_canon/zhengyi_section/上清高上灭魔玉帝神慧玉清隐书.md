### *The Supreme Perfected Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Divine Wisdom for Annihilating Demons from the Jade Purity Hidden Writ*

#### **Inner Text of the Jade Purity Inscribed Stone Hidden Inscription**

The inner text of the Supreme Perfected inscribed stone, the hidden inscription of spirits and gods on the northern wall of the Jade Purity Upper Palace, was transmitted by the Supreme Jade Emperor to the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity. The Three Ways establish rectitude, and the Celestial Emperor of the Grand Tenuity bestowed it upon the Later Sage, the Lord of the Dao of Great Peace, who inscribed it upon the Six Palaces of Fengdu and commanded the Northern Emperor to govern the mountains of Fengdu.

The Lord of the Dao inscribed its words, traversing the Ten Heavens to summon spirits and annihilate demons, overawing the myriad essences, sealing the Five Peaks, binding the host of spirits, ascending to unlock the Celestial Pass, revolving the Five Stars, unfurling a myriad transformations of radiance. The true light illumines with clarity, molten gold intermingles in splendor, and the Ten Heavens darken in obscurity. Those to be slain are slain, those to be executed are executed; all accords with the will, and life and death are judged with equity.

This Way is solemn and wondrous, the essence of the Jade Emperor. Those who behold its text achieve mastery without study. The dead of the Northern Fengdu are erased, names recorded in the Azure Flower Register, and perfected immortals come to pay homage, ascending to the royal court of the Upper Realm.

The Jade Purity Hidden Writ holds the mysterious purport of numinous subtlety, its jade-like tones penetrating the profound, its wondrous import luminous and penetrating. The eight thunders unleash their might, commanding spirits and deploying qi, directing the turning of the celestial pivot, rotating the Five Celestial Bodies. The Seven Stars hasten in motion, seated to command the Nine Heavens. The myriad spirits submit in totality, the Jade Bureau assumes its floating station, the Two Radiant Ones pause their brilliance, a thousand essences cower in retreat, and the host of demons are crushed and annihilated. Chanting its verses opens the Celestial Pass; reciting its incantations loosens the hearts of the myriad perfected. Purple auroras flow in reflection, golden immortals attend in spirit, the Primordial Heaven spreads across the court, the Eight Winds are solemn and clear. The mysterious light lingers in obscurity, the Three Radiant Ones merge in brightness, the celestial abyss lies in tranquil waves, mighty dragons stand in solemn array, divine tigers display their might, venomous beasts gather as troops, severing the heads of inauspicious omens. Demons and monsters assume their proper forms, ten thousand times ten thousand receive their duties, a thousand times a thousand are all pacified. The Five Penetrations and Seven Unions align, and the Three Qi converge as one.

You who possess jade bones must seek the treasure scriptures, cultivate with diligent and arduous practice, and ascend to the Cloudy Encampment, reaching the Mysterious Palace to pay homage to the Three Pure Ones.

The Fengdu Mountains lie in the northern *gui* region, rising three thousand six hundred *li* in height, with a circumference of thirty thousand *li*. The grotto-heaven within the mountains spans fifteen thousand *li* in circumference, both above and below containing palaces of spirits and gods. Atop the mountain stand Six Palaces, and within the grotto lie another Six Palaces, each palace extending a thousand *li* in circumference. These are the palaces of the Six Heavens’ spirits and gods, twelve in total, with the upper palaces governing ghosts and the grotto palaces governing spirits. The registers of life and death derive their names from here, all subject to the Northern Emperor.

The Jade Purity inscribed stone hidden inscription comprises two chapters: one to govern ghosts, the other to restrain spirits. On the northern walls of the twelve palaces, one chapter of the hidden inscription is engraved in each.

**First Palace:** Palace of the Cut-Off Yin of Zhou;
**Second Palace:** Palace of the Grand Execution and Faithful Affairs;
**Third Palace:** Palace of the Bright Dawn Enduring Transgressions in the Martial City;
**Fourth Palace:** Palace of the Tranquil Illumination of Sinful Qi;
**Fifth Palace:** Palace of the Seven Errors of the Ancestral Numinous;
**Sixth Palace:** Palace of the Daring Controller of Repeated Offenses.

The above Six Palaces govern the Fengdu Mountains, presiding over the myriad ghosts and administering the life and death of the people upon the earth. The Jade Emperor’s inscribed stone hidden inscription is written upon the northern walls of the palaces to restrain the host of malevolent forces, preventing them from wanton violence and unjust harm to the living. Those who obtain and bear this text shall be guarded by the myriad ghosts, their names erased from the Northern Fengdu, their fate transferred to the Southern Palace, and they shall become perfected beings.

The Six Palaces within the grotto of the Fengdu Mountains govern the myriad spirits. The Jade Emperor’s hidden inscription of names is written upon the northern walls of the palaces to restrain the numinous powers of the Six Palaces and their myriad spirits.

**First Palace:** Palace of the Radiant and Illuminating Grotto-Heaven of Total Numinosity;
**Second Palace:** Palace of the Mysterious Controller of the Weighty and Upright Ancestral Void;
**Third Palace:** Palace of the Unifying Immortals Ascending to the Subtle and Rare;
**Fourth Palace:** Palace of the Upright and Perfected, the Luminous Controller of the Curved;
**Fifth Palace:** Palace of the Cloudy Jade Record of Luminous Clarity;
**Sixth Palace:** Palace of the Lofty Void and Crimson Reflection of the Cloudy Origin.

The above names of the Six Palaces within the Fengdu Mountains govern the myriad spirits, and the registers of life and death are all bound to them. Those who know the names of the Six Palaces within the grotto and bear the Jade Emperor’s hidden inscription shall have the Southern Spirits pay inner homage, no longer harming people. Their names of death are erased from the Northern Fengdu, their fate transferred to the Southern Palace, with perfected spirits as guards and attendants, ascending to heaven in broad daylight.

The Jade Purity inscribed stone hidden text is to be written in vermilion on a three-*chi* length of blue-green silk and worn upon the body. Additionally, write it in blue-green upon the northern wall of one’s dwelling. When coming and going, near and far, the myriad ghosts shall pay homage to you, and a thousand ghosts shall guard the perfected. This is the mysterious ancient Dao, the Jade Purity hidden text. Those who obtain it become divine immortals, no longer subject to the palaces of Fengdu.

Those who receive it must keep it secret and take care not to show it to others. Those with golden bones and jade names, whose names are recorded in the Azure Bureau, having obtained this text, must follow the mysterious regulations. Within seven hundred years, they are permitted to transmit it three times. If transmitted to an unworthy recipient, the Northern Emperor shall report the offense, extending punishment to the seven generations of ancestors, who shall forever bear the burden of ghostly retribution. Their bodies shall perish, their forms be destroyed, and they shall never attain immortality.

The inscribed text within the Jade Purity’s carved stone hidden script comprises ninety-one words. The Jade Emperor engraved this upon the northern wall of the Six Palaces of Fengdu Grotto-Heaven to govern and restrain the myriad spirits. Those with jade bones, whose names are recorded in the Purple Purity, upon encountering this text, must transcribe it in vermilion upon a three-foot length of green silk and wear it, and also inscribe it in vermilion upon the northern wall of their dwelling. Then true immortals shall descend, the ten thousand spirits shall guard their form, the thousand demons shall flee in terror, the heavenly demons shall lose their essence, their might shall command the Ten Heavens, and they shall govern all beings. Their luminous spirit shall transform their body, and the ten thousand transformations shall be instantly accomplished. They shall ride the void and mount the floating clouds, soaring through the Jade Purity. To lightly divulge this precious script brings calamity upon the seven mysteries; the body perishes into the offices of ghosts, and one shall never attain immortality.

All who receive the Jade Purity’s hidden script, the *Dongjing Jinxuan* chapter, must recite it ten thousand times and constantly invoke the names of the upper and lower Six Palaces of Fengdu ten thousand times. Then they shall naturally comprehend the hidden names inscribed upon the stone. This sound emanates from the Highest Jade Void Heaven, a spontaneous composition, wherein the inner names of heavenly demons are recorded, or the jade tablets of the Nine Heavens are displayed. Its words are profound and distant, beyond the comprehension of beginners or ordinary mortals. Unless the Great Emperor descends, seated upon a jasper chariot, ascending the dawn clouds, riding the floating radiance of the Luo River and the purple heavens, one cannot thoroughly master this inscription. Those of later learning who are earnest, upon seeing this text, shall have their names recorded in the Eastern Florescence, their bones and appearance aligned with immortality, and the heavenly perfected shall descend in response—thus they receive this script. They must only follow the method and wear it upon their person to repel the myriad spirits. When the Dao is fulfilled and qi is clarified, they shall surely attain insight into the hidden sounds, roaming through the Jade Purity.

All who receive the Jade Purity’s hidden script, the *Dongjing Jinxuan* chapter, yet lack the inner text of the Jade Emperor’s carved stone hidden inscription, may not recite the *Jinxuan* chapter. To recite it lightly stirs the Highest Heavens, and the ten thousand demons seize the opportunity to arise. Those who possess only the inner text of the hidden inscription but do not receive the *Dongjing Jinxuan* likewise have no means to restrain demons. When the upper and lower are mutually aligned, the two practices are equally employed, and the Three Radiant Ones harmonize, the ten thousand qi become solemn and clear.

The *Golden Root Scripture* states: "Those who cultivate the Great Grotto must sit in the numinous thunder; those who cultivate the *Jinxuan* must wear the hidden inscription." This Dao is most wondrous, concealed within the Nine Bends Chamber of the Jade Void, guarded by golden spirits and attended by jade maidens bearing towels. The thirty-six perfected oversee the jade tablets. Those who violate the regulations or transgress the prohibitions shall be reported to the Three Purities, their bodies perishing into the offices of ghosts, forever bearing punishment in the Dark Springs. The heavenly statutes sternly warn: do not recklessly proclaim this.

All who receive the Jade Purity’s hidden script and the inner inscription of the carved stone must first purify themselves with a seven-day fast. Upon completion of the fast, they shall present thirty feet of brocade silk, nine pairs of golden rings, and make an oath before the Northern Emperor, swearing an alliance before transmission. Those who maintain long fasts must sever ties with the mortal world, their bodies untouched by impurity, their forms pure and qi clarified, before they may cultivate and practice this Dao. The Great One shall oversee the trial, the Controller of Destinies shall determine their life, the mysterious response shall wondrously inform, ascending to the Jade Purity. The Imperial Lord shall rejoice in fear, and the assembled perfected shall attend the court. When the Dao is perfected through ten thousand recitations, they shall ascend in a green chariot, joining the dark floating clouds to reach the Imperial Court.

**Highest Method for Diminishing Demons and Slaying Ghosts**

On *jiǎ*-*yǐ* days, the Ghost-Culling Capital Officer, surnamed Song, named Ju Ying, presides over the register of the ten thousand ghosts of *jiǎ*-*yǐ* days.
On *bǐng*-*dīng* days, the Ghost-Culling Capital Officer, surnamed You Tong, named Fa Sheng, presides over the register of the ten thousand ghosts of *bǐng*-*dīng* days.
On *wù*-*jǐ* days, the Ghost-Culling Capital Officer, surnamed Huang, named An Zheng Li, presides over the register of the ten thousand ghosts of *wù*-*jǐ* days.
On *gēng*-*xīn* days, the Ghost-Culling Capital Officer, surnamed Bo, named Xi Zi Liu, presides over the register of the ten thousand ghosts of *gēng*-*xīn* days.
On *rén*-*guǐ* days, the Ghost-Culling Capital Officer, surnamed Zheng, named Xuan Qiu Bo, presides over the register of the ten thousand ghosts of *rén*-*guǐ* days.

The Jade Emperor states: These Five Emperors’ Ghost-Culling Capital Officers all receive the title of Pure Void from the Northern Emperor. Though they preside over the culling of ghosts, their rank is not insignificant, for they are revered by the Five Peaks and relied upon by cultivators. Every 2,400 years, they ascend to the Jade Purity to become the officials of the General Immortals. If cultivators do not know the inner names of the Capital Officers or lack the jade script for slaying ghosts, demons and ghosts shall surely test them, corrupting their immortal rectitude.

All the myriad ghosts of the Northern Emperor, the demons of the world, and the suffering souls who have not yet ascended, whose names are recorded in the Northern Fengdu, are entirely governed by these officers. Those who know their names shall diligently record them in the Nine Heavens, the ten thousand demons shall be extinguished, the myriad ghosts shall hide their forms, and there shall be no further trials or defeats—immortality shall naturally be achieved. Yet this is a secret of the Highest Heavens, concealed within the Jasper Terrace and not transmitted to the lower world. Those who lightly divulge it shall be subjected to the trials of the wind and blade, and their seven generations of ancestors shall be punished upon Mount Meng.

These divine officers wear crowns of interwoven seven treasures and kingfisher feathers, jade hairpins, robes of purple silk edged with golden flowers and kingfisher feathers, white sashes, crimson skirts, vermilion shoes, and red-embroidered narrow garments, bearing five-colored ceremonial banners.

The *Northern Emperor’s Cold Numinosity Jade Scripture for Diminishing Demons and Slaying Ghosts* is received from the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by thirty-six jade maidens. It is also called the *Nine Heavens’ Life-Numinosity Scripture*, worn by the Highest Divine Numinous-Shao King. To slay the ghosts of *jiǎ*-*yǐ* days, one must transcribe the script in vermilion and present a white memorial [above], one foot and two inches in length, three inches and two fen in width, placing it upon the west at *gēng*, or upon *xīn* on *yǐ* days. Hold the breath for seven breaths, knock the left teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*"Riding the heavens, treading the qi, I carry out the mighty decree. The Highest Jade Scripture universally subdues the ten thousand evils. The Cold Numinosity receives restraint, stern as the heavenly bell. I solemnly command the Capital Officer to govern and restrain the Northern Fengdu. First execute the ghostly souls, then sever the demon kings. Great and small shall be extinguished, high and low shall be overthrown. As the heavens command, cut off their breath in the Palace of Fire. The Great One oversees the decree, the Five Elders hasten the work. Heaven is clear, earth is bright, the ten thousand passages are opened. All under the charge of *jiǎ*-*yǐ* shall respectfully obey."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi and swallow it seven times to conclude. Practicing this for seven days, the heavenly demons will bind their forms and manifest their images, submitting to service before your eyes. Ghostly souls shall be extinguished, and the myriad spirits will perish of themselves. Inscribe in vermilion on white silk and wear it upon your person, and you may traverse the world—all demonic trials shall be eradicated, and the ten thousand ghosts will dare not interfere. You may command eight Vermilion Elixir Jade Maidens. These divine officers wear robes of golden splendor with green and crimson silk, yellow skirts, and azure gauze undergarments, with sashes, crowns, and footwear as before.

The Vermilion Numinosity Jade Text for the North Emperor to extinguish demons and slay ghosts was received in the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by sixty-four Jade Maidens of the Vermilion Palace. One is named *She-Slaughtering Statute*, worn by the Highest Vanquisher of Demon Kings.

To slay ghosts on *bǐng*-*dīng* days, inscribe the text in yellow on a black memorial, one foot and two inches in length, three inches and two fen in width. Place it in the north at *rén* on *bǐng* days, or at *guǐ* on *dīng* days. Hold the breath for five breaths, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*"The Highest proclaims the decree, universally subduing the ten thousand spirits. The Capital Officer receives the talisman, reviewing the cases in Jade Clarity. Supervising the Northern Fengdu, he itemizes and delivers the names of demons. What the Celestial Emperor requires, none shall delay in presenting. The August Elders oversee the decree, the Five Immortals command the troops. Heavenly Unity wields the halberd, slaying without cease. Ten thousand times ten thousand shall submit to the law, a thousand times a thousand shall have their forms destroyed. All under the *Slaughtering Statute*’s restraint shall be utterly purged."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi and swallow it five times to conclude. Practicing this for five days, ghosts and demons will bind their forms and reveal their images, submitting to service before your presence. The myriad evils shall be eradicated, and the thousand spirits will perish of themselves. Inscribe in yellow on dark silk and wear it upon your person, and as you traverse the world, all demonic evils shall be vanquished, and the host of spirits will dare not interfere. After five years, you may command twelve Yellow Silk Jade Maidens. These divine officers wear robes of golden splendor with black trim and purple silk, crimson skirts, and yellow brocade undergarments, with sashes, crowns, and footwear as before.

The White Numinosity Jade Text for the North Emperor to extinguish demons and slay ghosts was received in the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by thirty-six White Numinosity Jade Maidens. One is named *Nine Heavens’ Military Missive*, worn by the Jade Clarity and Jade Firmament Kings.

To slay ghosts on *gēng*-*xīn* days, inscribe in black on a vermilion memorial, one foot and two inches in length, three inches and two fen in width. Place it in the south at *bǐng* on *gēng* days, or at *dīng* on *xīn* days. Hold the breath for three breaths, knock the left teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*"Heaven opens, earth communicates, the mysterious qi shines clear. Sweeping away floating obscurities, the Five Paths gleam brightly. Bearing the Emperor’s decree, I review and restrain the ten thousand spirits. Those under the Northern Fengdu’s charge shall be strictly bound to their true forms. What the Highest restrains shall promptly manifest their qi. The demonic hordes shall come of themselves, ghostly souls shall be extinguished of their essence. Wind arises, lightning strikes—from heaven, all is sternly pacified. All shall obey the mysterious talisman, submitting to the law in the Emperor’s court."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi and swallow it three times to conclude. Practicing this for three days, ghosts and demons will bind their forms and manifest their images, submitting to service before your eyes. The myriad demons shall submit to the law, and the host of evils shall be eradicated. Inscribe in black on vermilion silk and wear it upon your person, and as you traverse the world, the ten thousand demons shall flee in hiding, and the host of spirits will dare not interfere. After three years, you may command five Great Mystery Jade Maidens. These divine officers wear robes of golden splendor with green trim and crimson silk, black-edged, red skirts, and azure gauze undergarments, with sashes, crowns, and footwear as before.

The Mighty Numinosity Jade Text for the North Emperor to extinguish demons and slay ghosts was received in the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by twenty-five Great Mystery Jade Maidens. One is named *Mighty Divine Jade Tally*, worn by the Jade Clarity Vanquisher of Demon Kings.

To slay ghosts on *rén*-*guǐ* days, inscribe in azure on a yellow memorial, one foot and two inches in length, three inches and two fen in width. Place it in the center at *wù* on *rén* days, or at *jǐ* on *guǐ* days. Hold the breath for twelve breaths, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and recite the incantation:

*"Heaven topples, earth surges, the four seasons restrain their light. The Five Phases hasten to review, examining and fixing the ten directions. The Celestial Emperor ascends his floating throne, the August Elders emerge from their chambers. What the Highest punishes shall be sternly eradicated without mercy. First execute the ghostly souls, then sever the host of evils. A thousand demonic trials, ten thousand tests—none shall fail to submit. All shall obey the Jade Text, the Flowing Bells of the Eight Directions. The *Huoluo* cross in flight, mountains and peaks collapse. Upholding heaven and obeying the decree, the Capital Officers unite in merit."*

Upon completion, draw in the qi and swallow it twelve times to conclude. Practicing this for twelve days, ghosts and demons will bind their forms and manifest their images, submitting to service before your eyes. The myriad demons shall be extinguished, and the host of demonic trials shall perish of their essence.

After twelve years, you may command nine Azure-Waisted Jade Maidens. These divine scribes wear robes of golden splendor with kingfisher trim and vermilion gauze, red-edged crimson skirts, and white-embroidered undergarments, with sashes, crowns, and footwear as before.

The Cavern Numinosity Jade Text for the North Emperor to extinguish demons and slay ghosts was received in the Highest Three Heavens, guarded by twelve Yellow Silk Jade Maidens. One is named *Yellow Divine Mighty Tally*, worn by the Highest Jade Emperor Lord.

To slay ghosts on *wù*-*jǐ* days, inscribe in white on a cyan memorial, one foot and two inches in length, three inches and two fen in width.

Hastening to supervise the North Emperor, they bind and deliver demonic forms. The host of evils shall be blinded, unable to shift or escape. What the Celestial Emperor proclaims shall be pursued and captured without exception. Should any dare to transgress, they shall be swiftly restrained at Fengdu Mountain. Clear as the Emperor’s trust, I face the Jade Dawn."*

The Jade Emperor states: The Jade Text for Slaying Ghosts emerges from the Hidden Void of the Nine Heavens, bestowed by the Most High upon the Chief Scribe for Slaying Ghosts to govern the myriad demons and eradicate the host of malevolent spirits. Even the Demon-Quelling King and the Divine Empyrean King received it from the arcane incantations of the Most High’s divine wisdom, concealed within the Jade Purity. All who aspire to immortality and traverse renowned mountains, enduring perilous obstacles, must adhere to and perform these rites. When ascending to recite scriptures in purification or seeking the Dao of flight, they should likewise employ these methods to repel demonic trials. In places where ghosts abound among mortals, these rites must also be performed to extinguish ghostly and demonic influences. Those who practice this Dao must do so with utmost sincerity, unwavering resolve, and no trace of doubt, following the prescribed days. Then, the heavenly demons shall reveal their forms and submit to judgment. Should any fail to manifest their true forms, it is because their own impurities remain unresolved, though the ghosts and demons shall still be bound in darkness and receive their forms from the Chief Scribe. If frivolous practitioners, lacking purity of intent, rashly summon ghosts, the ghosts shall instead harm them, bringing great calamity. Be vigilant and do not act carelessly.

The Jade Purity Divine Empyrean King states: Ghosts and demons are cunning and endlessly transformative—now sinking, now rising; now appearing, now vanishing; now gathering, now concealing; now hiding, now manifesting; now in qi, now dead, now alive; now soaring in clouds, now dwelling in empty caverns. Their five-colored forms flicker and shift, never constant. All such beings derive their power from the governance of the Six Heavens, subject to the decree of the Three Heavens, existing within their allotted span. Thus, they indulge in their malevolence. The Most High, observing that later learners are often crafty and mortal hearts impure, with harm proliferating and wickedness flourishing, permits their existence to awe the people, aligning the true to punish the false, and employing them as officials to examine and test. Therefore, their root and kind are not eradicated. When their allotted span ends, their qi shall naturally dissipate, and mortal hearts shall spontaneously purify, allowing learners to naturally attain immortality.

Ghosts, as entities, are greedy and impure, their malevolence born of their own nature. They test later learners, no longer possessing truth, for the Nine Heavens reveal their forms in reverse. Thus, the Five Emperors’ Jade Text for Slaying Ghosts was established to restrain their violence. If later learners obtain this text, the ghosts and demons shall self-destruct, and their malevolent trials shall not interfere. The prohibitions of the Nine Heavens, in accordance with the Bright Statutes of the Four Poles, permit transmission to one person every seven hundred years. Those who lightly disclose or neglect it shall suffer great calamity. Adhere carefully and practice diligently.

The Most High Demon-Quelling King states: Even perfected True Persons who have attained transcendence are tested by malevolent demons—how much more so for ordinary learners? Those who fail to achieve immortality yet are not tested are protected by the Nine Heavens’ demonic restraints. Thus, demons must first test their alignment with truth or falsehood. Those who receive demonic protection shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight—how could they be faulted by demons? Yet demons seek only to cause failure, not to allow success. Therefore, the Most High exposes their violence and establishes the Jade Text for Slaying Ghosts, the chapters for extinguishing demons, and the Jade Emperor’s divine wisdom, all to prevent and eradicate this violence. If demons test with reason, there is no need for further methods of eradication. Later learners must therefore diligently cultivate and employ the Jade Text, reciting the Jade Emperor’s divine wisdom to avert such disasters. Without receiving the qi of the Jade Void and forming the radiant jade embryo, those who vainly seek bodily flight shall only weary themselves in futile toil, achieving nothing of their aspirations.

The Supreme Method of the Nine Heavens for Expelling Malevolent Spirits and Divine Wisdom
The Great Wisdom of the Hidden Mystery Jade Emperor of the Highest Clarity, also called the Inner Method of the Nine Heavens’ Divine Incantation for Expelling Demons.

These scriptural texts embody the supreme Dao of the August Void, the divine secrets of the Most High, gathering the true essence of spiritual destiny, extinguishing demonic influences, and commanding the Six Heavens. They summon and guard divine soldiers, shatter malevolent spirits, and execute perverse essences. They were established during the Jade Emperor’s great trial as the law of the Three Heavens. When the resounding tones of jade chime, malevolent impurities are dispelled, mountain spirits are annihilated, and the myriad spirits submit to service. Divine transcendents assist and protect, the Nine Demons submit their forms, cold spirits lose their qi, the Celestial Blade shines upward, and divine might presses downward. Poisons are repelled, trials are averted, and the myriad demons vanish without trace.

This method must never be lightly disclosed. Those who transmit it must swear solemn oaths and vow not to reveal it. Should they violate their oaths and disregard the prohibitions, their bodies shall become lowly ghosts, eternally confined in hell, while their seven generations of ancestors shall suffer the punishments of the Wind Blade.

The Divine Incantation of the Nine Heavens Jade Emperor states:
The transformation of the Nine Heavens perpetually generates the Dao,
Preserving the luminous Great Prime, its radiance veiled in vermilion jade.
Abiding in the cinnabar mystery, receiving service in the Jade Purity,
Ten revolutions, nine passages, seven blends, five completions.
Divine splendor blazes, shaking the imperial court with its strategy.
The Dao attains three transformations, recording the destiny of spirits and numina.
The Jade Emperor disperses wisdom, the Hidden Mystery Feathered Scripture,
A thousand perfected ones incline their wheels, the Five Emperors command their expeditions.
Clad in vermilion kerchiefs and feathered robes, they array themselves in the imperial court,
Girded with the divine tiger on the left, wielding golden soldiers on the right.
The Nine Heavens’ expedition, brandishing fiery bells,
Extinguishes demons, shatters spirits, severs perversity, and corrects essences.
Wind and fire resound in majesty, the Six Heavens collapse,
The Northern Fengdu is breached, the Nine Demons’ spirits are sealed.
Those who oppose the Dao are executed; those who follow transformation live.
The Emperor delegates command, ordering divine soldiers to guard.
A thousand perversities are extinguished, ten thousand ghosts find no rest.
Should any dare to test or interfere, they are delivered to the Celestial Soldiers.
Demons are extinguished, poisons are punished;
Once extinguished and punished, perversity is restrained and essence recorded.
The Six Heavens are executed, their might shaking the Seven Spirits.
Precious spirits drive out impurity, the Empyrean surges through the Three Clarities.
The myriad perfected ones receive service, assembling in the imperial court.
The Six Symbols harmonize, the Seven Dawns shine brightly.
Divine winds scatter demons, the Dao flows without name.
Divine wisdom extinguishes demons, the Jade Emperor’s incantation arises.
The Nine Heavens bestow command, gathering the true and governing the numinous.
I humbly receive the Emperor’s mandate—thus the immortal Dao is revealed.

Upon completing the incantation, strike the teeth thirty-six times and swallow saliva ten times. Thus the ritual concludes, and one may retire.

Should a Daoist travel alone or lodge in a place of unsettling energy—whether in forests, temples, or regions where mountain spirits and malevolent ghosts abound, ever eager to assail and test mortals—those who feel their spirit tremble in fear ought to recite the Jade Emperor’s divine incantation to dispel and repel them. Once the numinous sound resounds, celestial demons are vanquished, myriad evils scatter, and divine perfected ones encamp in defense.

If one lodges among a multitude of ten thousand, on that very night, wondrous spiritual responses shall arise: divine soldiers will manifest in protection, striking down treacherous fiends, driving out inauspicious impurities. The Three Palaces receive the true, the Five Emperors lend their aid, the inner numinous gates are fortified, and outer pernicious qi is subdued. Thus the spirit is serene, the body at peace, and all fear dispelled.

**The Jade Emperor’s Incantation for Ghostly Defense and Numinous Protection**

The Jade Emperor’s incantation states:
The Nine Heavens issue command, upholding the Jade Clarity.
Hasten the summoning of a thousand perfected ones, assembling in the imperial court.
The Supreme One gazes below, the Twin Sovereigns flank his form.
They survey the myriad evils, ordering qi and safeguarding life.
Should any inauspicious force dare test the divine,
Invoke the Emperor’s Dao, dispatching the divine soldiers to order.
Seven spirits wield halberds, celestial blades march to the right.
Brandishing swords at the vanguard, they hurl flaming bells.
Summon the armored couriers, the martial legions of Heavenly Soldiers.
Wind and fire unite in battle, vanquishing evil and refining essence.
Above, they overawe the Six Heavens; below, they subdue demonic spirits.
Once awed and subdued, the myriad fiends are extinguished in form.
Divine spears sweep like lightning, leaving no trace of treacherous demons.
The Immortal Sovereigns hold the tally—who dares delay the command?
Those who defy the tally or violate the decree shall be executed and punished.
Let each respect and take heed, preserving this Yellow Tranquility.
The Nine Heavens proclaim the mandate—let all spirits heed with reverence.

Should you, the adept, walk at night in fear, your heart trembling and resolve faltering—whether in the grip of nightmares, when demons test mortals, or when malevolent forces violate the true and disrupt qi, seeking to sicken and harm—hasten to perform the Jade Emperor’s method for numinous protection.

The adept must concentrate the mind upon the utmost Dao, seeking deliverance from the imperial realm. Face north, strike the teeth thirty-six times, hold the breath, and silently recite the incantation to completion. Then strike the teeth ten more times as before, and swallow saliva ten times. Thus treacherous evil is shattered, demonic forces subdued and extinguished. The Seven Spirits entwine in defense, the Supreme One surveys and subdues. The myriad spirits guard the true, and outer pernicious qi is overawed.

This may also be recited daily, vibrating the voice in recitation, whether seated or reclining, to bar the approach of all demonic tests and seal the inauspicious traces of treacherous ghosts. Before retiring each night, one may also recite it, ensuring the spirit’s peace, dispelling nightmares and malevolent influences, dissolving all poisons and evils, and securing a life free from fear.

On days when the incantation is practiced, one need not face north or hold the breath. The purpose of holding the breath and reciting silently is this: when demonic forces have already tested one’s surroundings and treacherous spirits have violated the chamber of the spirit, the divine command is issued to the true to reclaim and suppress their malevolence. The incantation for external repose, however, does not follow this same method.
