### **The Method of Reverting the Spirit, Soaring through the Empyrean, Ascending the Void, and Summoning the Five Stars**

The Dao of reverting the spirit, feeding upon the celestial essence, and summoning the Five Stars to ascend the void pierces the Seven Mysteries above and dissolves the myriad forms below. It unifies the ten thousand transformations, establishes the ascent to the Mysterious Framework, bathes in orchid fragrance, enters the chamber in purity, and cultivates its methods. The Five Viscera radiate clarity, the Seven Orifices shine resplendently, the spirit guards the Crimson Palace, and the form ascends the Five Mornings. This is the most wondrous method—it is not transmitted to the untrue.

Those who know the Dao find it easy; those who cultivate the method find it difficult. For this arduous path, how could it not be guarded in secrecy?

On the days of *jiazi*, *jiawu*, *yiyou*, *yimao*, *jichou*, *jiwei*, *wuchen*, and *wuxu*, bathe in purity, fast, and enter the chamber. Sit or recline as you wish, close your eyes, and clasp your hands over your heart. Visualize the Azure Emperor of the East, whose taboo name is *Tongming* and style *Gaiqing*. He wears a cyan turban, cyan robes, a cyan crown, and cyan shoes, and bears the insignia of *Tongguang Yangxia*. Enter my body.

Next, visualize the Four Perfected of the Liver, named *Qingming Jun* and styled *Minglun Tongzi*, who eternally guard my liver, protect the gate of my stomach duct, and beneath the adipose membrane, block the dead qi. They bestow upon me the Azure Essence, the Lunar Water, and the Jade Mushroom. Then, visualize the luminous essence of Jupiter, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it ninety times, allowing the qi to fill the Liver Palace. After nine years of practice, nine Azure Waist Jade Maidens of the East will attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Vermilion Emperor of the South, whose taboo name is *Taiyang* and style *Huanlin*. He wears a crimson turban, crimson robes, a crimson crown, and crimson shoes, and bears the insignia of *Silang Zhubi*. Enter my body.

Next, visualize the Primordial Cinnabar Sovereign of the Crimson Palace, named *Shenyun Zhu* and styled *Zinan Dan*, also called *Shengshang Bo* and *Shiyun Ju*, who eternally guards my Crimson Palace, protects the gate of my cervical vertebrae, and severs the path of dead qi. He bestows upon me the Cinnabar Essence, the Vermilion Water, and the Jade Mushroom. Then, visualize the luminous essence of Mars, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it eighty times, allowing the vermilion qi to suffuse the Crimson Palace. After nine years of practice, eight Vermilion Jade Maidens of the South will serve at your side.

Next, visualize the White Emperor of the West, whose taboo name is *Tongyin* and style *Yuanqi*. He wears a white turban, plain robes, a white crown, and white shoes, and bears the insignia of *Haoling Fuxi*. Enter my body.

Next, visualize the Six Perfected of the Lungs, named *Shangsu Jun* and styled *Liangnanzhong Tong*, who eternally guard my lungs, protect the Twelve Passes, and sever the path of dead qi. They bestow upon me the Plain Mushroom, the Lunar Water, and the Jade Essence Elixir. Then, visualize the luminous essence of Venus, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it sixty times, allowing the stellar qi to fill the lungs. After nine years of practice, six Supreme Plain Jade Maidens will attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Black Emperor of the North, whose taboo name is *Tongshen* and style *Zigui*. He wears a dark turban, black robes, a dark crown, and dark shoes, and bears the insignia of *Yuzhen Xiaofeng*. Enter my body.

Next, visualize the Seven Perfected Sovereigns of the Kidneys, named *Xuanyang Jun* and styled *Mingguang Xiansheng*, who eternally guard my two kidneys, protect the Earth Gate of my spine, and block the path of dead qi. They bestow upon me the Mysterious Yin Elixir and the Nine Liquids of the Jade Mushroom. Then, visualize the luminous essence of Mercury, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it fifty times, allowing the stellar qi to fill the two kidneys. After nine years of practice, five Supreme Mysterious Jade Maidens will attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Yellow Emperor of the Center, whose taboo name is *Wanfu* and style *Taicang*. He wears a yellow turban, yellow robes, a yellow crown, and yellow shoes, and bears the insignia of *Zhongyuan Bawei Yumen*. Enter my body.

Next, visualize the Five Perfected Sovereigns of the Spleen, named *Yangguang Jun* and styled *Taichang Zi*, who eternally guard my spleen, protect the gate of my root extremity, and sever the path of dead qi. They bestow upon me the Yellow Water, the Lunar Radiance, and the Jade Embryo Elixir. Then, visualize the luminous essence of Saturn, drawing it into the mouth and swallowing it twelve times, allowing the qi to fill the spleen. After nine years of practice, twelve Yellow Plain Jade Maidens will attend at your side.

Next, visualize the Supreme Mysterious Primordial Father, whose taboo name is *Gaotongsheng* and style *Zuohuiming*, and the Lower Mysterious Primordial Mother, named *Shuhuowang* and styled *Youhuiguang*. These two spirits guard the root of my original destiny, block the source of dead qi, and bestow upon me the Yang Mushroom and Yin Essence to nourish my body.

Visualize the radiance of the Two Luminaries (Sun and Moon), illuminating my form. Draw their light into the mouth and swallow it thirty-six times, allowing the luminous qi to fill the Cinnabar Field below the navel. After nine years of practice, your face will assume a golden countenance, your eyes will emit flowing light, and you will command the Six Jia and summon the Six Ding, fulfilling every desire.

When the Perfected One has completed the visualization of the Five Emperors and the Two Luminaries, recite the incantation:

> *"The Five Stars entwine and weave, their light flowing within to illuminate.
> The Two Luminaries soar with rosy clouds, irrigating the Five Essences.
> The Perfected Spirits guard and store, eternally preserving the Yellow Tranquility.
> The Great Unity’s grand design transforms the embryo and reverts to infancy.
> Liver and lungs blossom in splendor, heart and kidneys brim with radiance.
> The spleen guards the Central Mystery, the Five Mushrooms receive life.
> The precious light of the Sun and Moon merges with the Emperor.
> Soaring through the void, ascending to the Jade Clarity."*

The practice of reverting the spirit, feeding upon the celestial essence, and summoning the Five Stars to ascend the void concludes here. After nine years of unwavering cultivation and visualization, the true numina will inwardly radiate. The Three Origins will attend the chamber, severing the dead qi in the Nine Chambers and delivering the Register of Life to the Southern Palace. Receiving the mysterious infusion of the Five Spirits and swallowing the Two Luminaries, one attains eternal existence. The Five Viscera blossom in splendor and never decay; the hun and po are preserved and guarded, prolonging the years.

**The Supreme Method of Stabilizing the Spirit, Nurturing Life, and Inwardly Visualizing the Flight to Immortality**

The Perfected Lord of the Grand Tenuity Heaven stabilizes the spirit through inward visualization, dissolving the fetal bonds, dispersing knots, securing the *hun*, and congealing the *po*—the Dao of blending and transforming the Mysterious True. Opening the Six Bowels, the Five Offices receive numina. Swallowing *qi* and contemplating the True, fragrant mushrooms spontaneously grow. The stomach’s tubes and networks solidify; the spirit clarifies, the body purifies. The Jade Chariot arrives at once, and one ascends the dawn in broad daylight.

One must always fast in purity, bathe, burn incense, and enter the chamber. Calm the heart, cast off burdens, and abandon dust—suddenly, all obstructions vanish. Focus the mind without sleep, and then the true form may be seen, the wandering spirit may return.

Each morning at dawn, face east and sit upright. Close the eyes and inwardly visualize the form and color, bright and clear. Call their true names to return and stabilize their original palaces, then knock the teeth thirty-six times.

Next, visualize the spirit of the hair, named **Canghua**, styled **Taiyuan**, two *cun* and one *fen* in height;
the spirit of the brain, named **Jinggen**, styled **Niwan**, one *cun* and one *fen* in height;
the spirit of the eyes, named **Mingshang**, styled **Yingxuan**, three *cun* in height;
the spirit of the nose, named **Yulong**, styled **Lingjian**, two *cun* and five *fen* in height;
the spirit of the ears, named **Kongxian**, styled **Youtian**, three *cun* and one *fen* in height;
the spirit of the tongue, named **Tongming**, styled **Zhenglun**, seven *cun* in height;
the spirit of the teeth, named **Efeng**, styled **Luoqian**, one *cun* and five *fen* in height.
The seven spirits of the face all wear flying silk skirts, each in the form of an infant. Visualize them distinctly, arrayed across the face, each stabilizing its palace. When complete, knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow *qi* twelve times, and recite the incantation:

*"The numinous source disperses *qi*,
knits *qi* into spirit,
distinguishes front and back,
governs the Muddy Pellet.
Above and below support one another,
the seven spirits array themselves.
Flowing forms shift and change,
nurturing the radiant origin.
Guiding and drawing the Eight Numinous,
they surge upward through the Cavernous Gate,
guarding the body and gathering the luminous,
ascending to the Emperor’s Dawn."*

When finished, next visualize the spirit of the heart, named **Danyuan**, styled **Shouling**, nine *cun* in height;
the spirit of the lungs, named **Haohua**, styled **Xucheng**, eight *cun* in height;
the spirit of the liver, named **Longyan**, styled **Hecangming**, seven *cun* in height;
the spirit of the kidneys, named **Xuanming**, styled **Yuying**, three *cun* and six *fen* in height;
the spirit of the spleen, named **Changzai**, styled **Hunting**, seven *cun* and three *fen* in height;
the spirit of the gallbladder, named **Longyao**, styled **Weiming**, three *cun* and six *fen* in height.
The true spirits of the Six Bowels all wear cinnabar brocade flying skirts, dwelling within the Five Viscera and the palaces of the Six Bowels, their forms like infants, their colors like radiant youths. Visualize them distinctly, arraying their forms from dawn to dusk, contemplating without forgetfulness. Knock the teeth twenty-four times, swallow *qi* twelve times, and invoke:

*"The Five Viscera and Six Bowels,
true spirits unite as one,
governing the Crimson Palace together,
above and below following one another.
The Golden Chamber’s Red Child
dwells opposite the Four Gates.
The Dark Chamber and Mysterious Portal,
the Spirit Hall’s pivotal mechanism—
blending and transforming to generate spirit,
true *qi* refined and subtle.
Preserve and refine the Cinnabar Field,
shining with the sun’s splendor,
to join the Eight Luminous,
unite form and ascend in flight."*

When finished, next visualize the Three Perfected of Essence and Blood, named **Yuansheng Jun**, styled **Huangningzi**, eternally stabilizing the source beneath my two apertures;
the Two Perfected of Bones and Joints, named **Jianyu Jun**, styled **Ningyuzhu**, stabilizing my Granary Storehouse and the mouth of the Five Intestines;
the One Perfected within the heart, named **Tianjing Jinye Jun**, styled **Feisheng Shangying**, stabilizing the mouth of the Four Extremities in my chest;
the True Male of the Nine Origins, named **Jouzhi**, styled **Sanyang**, stabilizing the Gate of Hidden Dawn in my left ear;
the Imperial One’s *Hun*-Female, named **Shanggui**, styled **Dizi**, stabilizing the Gate of Hidden Dawn in my right ear;
the Left Primordial Perfected of Purple Simplicity, named **Yiyu Wuren**, styled **Anlai Shang**, stabilizing the region of my head and face;
the Central Primordial Perfected of Yellow Simplicity, named **Yuanhua Huangren**, styled **Taizhang Shang**, stabilizing the region of my chest and abdomen;
the Right Primordial Perfected of White Simplicity, named **Qiming Xiaoren**, styled **Jinmen Shang**, stabilizing the region of my lower barrier;
the Director of Destiny in the Sun, named **Jiesheng**, stabilizing my left hand;
the Peach Lord in the Moon, named **Fangying**, stabilizing my right hand;
the Primordial White *Qi* Lord of the Womb, named **Wuxuanzi**, styled **Yushangsheng**;
the Supreme One’s Essence and *Hun*, named **Xuanguizi**, styled **Shengchang**—these two spirits stabilize the knot above my Five Viscera, the root of the throat’s junction;
the Azure *Qi* Lord of the Junction, named **Anyanchang**, styled **Heheying**;
the Perfected *Hun* of the Primordial Lord, named **Baogutong**, styled **Mingfu**—these two spirits stabilize below my Five Viscera, above the Great Stomach;
the Black *Qi* Lord of the Nodes, named **Binlaisheng**, styled **Jingshangmen**;
the Imperial True Perfected *Hun*, named **Youtaisheng**, styled **Guanshangsheng**—these two spirits stabilize the mouth of my Nine Intestines, beneath the Hidden Source;
the Yellow *Qi* Lord of the Womb, named **Zumingche**, styled **Shenwuji**;
the Heavenly Emperor’s Essence and *Hun*, named **Liweizang**, styled **Fazhu**—these two spirits stabilize within my lower abdomen, the root of the two apertures;
the Red *Qi* Lord of the Blood, named **Hunlizi**, styled **Shubaojian**;
the Director of Destiny’s Essence and *Hun*, named **Faniuzi**, styled **Qingxuan**—these two spirits stabilize beneath the severed nodes of the hundred joints in my blood;
the Upper Primordial Father Lord, named **Gaotongsheng**, styled **Zuohuiming**;
the Lower Primordial Dark Mother, named **Shuhuowang**, styled **Youhuiguang**;
the Imperial Supreme One, named **Chongmingkong**, styled **Youliaowu**;
the Nine August Emperors, named **Mingzhen**, styled **Zhongdisheng**;
the Supreme Emperor’s Essence and *Hun*, named **Youyangtangyu**, styled **Baling**;
the Nine Barriers’ *Hun*, named **Lühuidao**, styled **Xueming**;
the Heavenly Register’s Imperial *Hun*, named **Zhaowua**, styled **Guangshen**—these seven spirits stabilize the root of my original destiny, sealing the gate of my death’s path.

Visualize and invoke the host of Perfected from the head to the navel, none not radiant and clear. Then let the Golden Fluid flow in circuits, the Jade Splendor illuminate the *hun*, the numinous *qi* overflow the hidden intestines, and the Emperor’s *qi* fill the Nine Barriers. The Seven Ancestors are released from the Three Realms, receive rebirth in the Southern Palace, stabilize the life-spirit within the body, and spread true *qi* to secure the years.

Upon completion, strike the teeth thirty-nine times and invoke:

The *qi* arises from nothingness, coalesces with the spirit;
Yang *qi* steadies without, Yin *qi* matures within.
The two images intertwine, fusing with the primordial numen.
The inner Perfected guard and protect, the nine apertures receive life.
Preserve the *hun*, secure the *po*, the myriad spirits rest in peace.
Safeguard my Three Barriers, let the flowering mushrooms fill and overflow.
Ascend with me together, jointly attain the Jade Clarity.

Upon completion, swallow the *qi* thirty-nine times to stabilize the thirty-nine portals, allowing the *qi*-moisture to circulate and suffuse the entire body.

Should one cast off burdens, untether from worldly dust,
calm the heart and pacify the intent,
clearly perceive the empty chamber,
gaze inward in contemplation,
stabilize the spirit and secure the *hun*,
seal the death-*qi* at the nine portals,
and anchor the life-palace at the Upper Barrier—
revolving in cycles of visualization and invocation,
as though speaking face-to-face—
then after three years, day and night,
the true spirit will manifest in form.
Radiant splendor returns to the root,
rotten teeth regrow,
the Five Viscera knit their networks,
the inner fills to abundance.
One may command the Six *Jia*, dispatch the Six *Ding*,
summon guests from the Nine Empyreans,
and welcome the gods descending in the Three Primes’ chariot.
The spirit soars, the form ascends—
by daylight, one mounts the dawn.

This is the divine treasure of the Supreme Perfected, named the "Inner Character,"
which stabilizes within the human body,
circulates the *qi* of the Nine Heavens,
and secures the mechanisms of the Six Palaces.
The myriad essences transform and arise—all through the spirit.
When the spirit is anchored, life endures; when the spirit departs, life perishes.
Through diligent cultivation and accumulated resonance,
one may uplift the body’s form to ascend to the Dark Palace.

The Dao of seeking immortality—
without knowing the inner names of form and spirit,
without knowing how to seal the portals of death—
how can one hope for life?

In practicing this Dao,
one must not dwell in filth or impurity,
nor consume the five pungents, wine, or meat—
such things offend the true *qi*, and the spirit will depart.

People know that rich delicacies please the palate,
and ranks and emoluments glorify the body,
yet they do not desire the sweetness of the palate’s food—
this is the axe that wounds life.
Extravagant ranks and luxuries are the wellspring that drains the true.
Thus do the spirit-people cherish seclusion,
neither lodging the body nor revealing their form in the mundane world.

Those who cultivate life—ought they not be cautious?
