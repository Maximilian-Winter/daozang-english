5. Refrain from lust and lewdness.

### **The Ten Virtues**

Those who perpetually practice these Five Sincerities and Ten Virtues shall be guarded by celestial and numinous spirits, forever dispelling calamities and perpetually attaining blessings and protection—this lies solely in unwavering resolve.

### **The Six Annual Fasts**
The first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, and eleventh months.

### **The Ten Monthly Fasts**
1. The first day: when the Northern Dipper descends.
2. The eighth day: when the Northern Dipper’s Deity of Slaying Spirits descends.
3. The fourteenth day: when the Messenger of the Great One descends.
4. The fifteenth day: when the Heavenly Thearch and the Three Officials descend together.
5. The eighteenth day: when the Great One descends.
6. The twenty-third day: when the Eight Divine Messengers of the Great One descend.
7. The twenty-fourth day: when the Northern Asterism descends.
8. The twenty-eighth day: when the Lower Great One descends.
9. The twenty-ninth day: when the Middle Great One descends.
10. The thirtieth day: when the Upper Great One descends.

On the days of the Lower, Middle, and Upper Great Ones, all the honored deities of Heaven, Earth, and Water descend together, traversing the world to observe the good and evil of humanity.

- On *jiǎzǐ* days, the Great One reviews the records of spirits.
- On *gēngshēn* days, the Crouching Corpse reports human transgressions.
- On one’s *bĕnmìng* (natal) day, one’s merits and conduct are calculated.
- On the Eight Seasonal Nodes, eight spirits record human good and evil.
- On the Three Primordial Days, the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water examine human transgressions and blessings.

### **The Three Assembly Days**
1. The seventh day of the first month: the Assembly of Promotion and Reward.
2. The seventh day of the seventh month: the Assembly of Celebrating Life.
3. The fifth day of the tenth month: the Grand Assembly of Establishing Life.

On the Three Assembly Days, the Three Officials assess merits and transgressions; it is fitting to receive talismans and registers, observe fasts, and present memorials to pray for abundant blessings.

### **The Five La Days**
1. The first day of the first month: *Tiān Là* (Celestial La).
2. The fifth day of the fifth month: *Dì Là* (Earthly La).
3. The seventh day of the seventh month: *Dàodé Là* (Dao-Virtue La).
4. The first day of the tenth month: *Mínsuì Là* (People’s Year La).
5. The La day of the twelfth month: *Hóuwáng Là* (Marquis-King La).

On the Five La Days, one should always make offerings to ancestral spirits, thereby becoming a filial child and attaining boundless blessings. All other days are considered excessive or improper sacrifices.

Together with the Three Primordial Days, these form the Eight Liberation Days, on which one may set up pure offerings to seek blessings.

### **The Method of Fasting and Upright Conduct**
The essentials lie in abstaining from rich flavors, meat, pungent foods, alcohol, and lust; eliminating malice, jealousy, and delusive thoughts; and refraining from all evils. One should only burn incense, light lamps, recite scriptures, perform repentance rites, and pray for the universal deliverance of all from disasters and misfortunes—this constitutes fasting.

Formerly, Confucius said to Laozi: “I, Qiu, live in poverty and have long abstained from alcohol and meat.”
Laozi replied: “This is the fast of sacrificial offerings. You must unify your will: do not listen with your ears but with your mind; do not listen with your mind but with your *qi*. Purify your mind, cleanse your spirit, and shatter your intellect—I shall then speak to you.”

### **Discourse**
According to the fasting methods in various scriptures, there are roughly three levels:
1. **Offering Fast**: By which one accumulates virtue and resolves transgressions.
2. **Abstention Fast**: By which one harmonizes the spirit and preserves longevity. This is the sacrificial fast, practiced by those of middling capacity.
3. **Mind Fast**: This entails purifying the mind and eliminating desires, cleansing the spirit and removing defilements, shattering one’s intellect and cutting off thoughts. Without thought or worry, one focuses solely on the Dao; without craving or desire, one delights in the Dao; without defilement or encumbrance, one unites with the Dao. Since the mind harbors no dualistic thoughts, it is called “unified will.” This is practiced by those of superior capacity.

In essence, “fasting” (*zhāi*) means “to align” (*qí*). The essentials lie in aligning and rectifying the Three Karmas—only then does it constitute fasting. If one merely observes dietary abstention while the mind remains unaligned, or if one merely unifies the will, then the mouth will not crave flavors. These two methods—outer and inner—mutually support one another. Thus, the *Scripture of the Great Precepts* states: “Calm the mind and still the breath, focus on single-mindedness without duality; do not eat after noon; maintain inner and outer purity and emptiness.”

Though Confucius was skilled in dietary abstention, he had not yet mastered the regulation of the mind. Therefore, this fasting method was shown to him so that he might receive the Dao. Yet how many of the later learners can truly empty their minds and unify their wills? Those who vulgarize the teachings of sacrificial fasting, claiming to have grasped the principles of the Mind Fast, are merely arrogant and indolent. Though they may speak of mystery and quiescence, their eyes reveal no understanding—they merely pride themselves.

The *Book of Changes* states: “The sage uses this for fasting and vigilance.”

Each person is born with a specific year, month, day, and hour, determined by their corresponding constellation, which defines their poverty or wealth, nobility or baseness, lifespan, and fate. Yet the six kinds of possessions—gathering and scattering, life and death, success and failure, flourishing and decline—are the eternal patterns of the world, the natural oppositions of the cosmos.

The five colors are awls that pierce the eyes.
The five tones are hammers that deafen the ears.
The five flavors are axes that sever the tongue.
Wealth and goods are things that confuse people.

Thus, no misfortune is greater than death, and no blessing is greater than life. Therefore, the fame that is sought is the sack that buries the self.

The nameless name is the dwelling that nurtures me.
The coveted wealth is the thief that destroys me.
The wealth that is not coveted is the blessing that nurtures me.

No sin is greater than lust,
no misfortune greater than greed,
no fault greater than transgression—
these three are the chariot of calamity.
In small measure, they ruin the self;
in great measure, they ruin the household.

To cultivate life and nourish nature,
to bear the spirit and uphold destiny,
is to depart from suffering and ascend to joy,
where blessings and felicity flow endlessly.

Human life arises from the spirit:
when the spirit abides, life endures;
when the spirit severs, death follows.
Thus, diligent devotion and accumulated sincerity
can lift the form to ascend to the Mystic Palace.

People only know to indulge in rich delicacies to please the mouth,
to seek ranks and emoluments to glorify the self,
yet do not consider that the food that pleases the mouth
is the axe that severs life,
and that extravagant ranks and luxuries
provoke the resentment of all under heaven.

The Perfected Lord says:
The Dao is the utmost truth of numinous penetration.
Technique is the mysterious art of transformation.
From form to the formless,
one relies on technique to aid others.
Human beings possess numinosity,
and through cultivation, they unite with the Dao.
If one can study this,
transformation arises naturally.

The essence of the Dao
lies in its simplicity and ease of practice.
The secrets of its defense
reside in talismans, medicines, and qi.
Talismans are the numinous script of the Three Luminaries,
the true pledge of heaven.
Medicines are the blossoms and essences of the Five Phases,
the refined essence of earth.
Qi is the harmonious qi of yin and yang,
the numinous vitality of the myriad things.
Though you may master one aspect,
you must still rely on talismans, medicines, and the Dao to complete it.
Medicine refines the form;
talismans summon the spirit.

One who cherishes the self
cannot be harmed even by heaven and earth.
One who guards their resolve
cannot be defeated even by all under heaven.
One who is content in poverty
cannot be enriched even by all under heaven.
One who delights in lowliness
cannot be ennobled even by all under heaven.

Never has there been reverence without all things revering,
never humility without all things yielding,
never pride without all things esteeming,
never kindness without all things bestowing kindness.

Guard straightness with crookedness,
whiteness with disgrace,
eloquence with simplicity,
skill with clumsiness.
Take non-boasting as fulfillment,
non-knowing as nobility,
love and favor as alarm.

Do not tread where there is no ground for safety,
and thus the hundred misfortunes cannot befall you.
Do not follow treacherous or uneven paths,
and thus peril and obstruction cannot endanger you.
Do not defile your resolve with emoluments and rank,
and thus punishments cannot be imposed upon you.
Do not take slander and praise as joy or anger,
and thus vilification cannot follow you.

The hundred misfortunes cannot befall you—
thus you grasp the essence of the myriad things.
Peril and obstruction cannot endanger you—
thus you preserve the blessing of eternal peace.
Punishments cannot be imposed upon you—
thus you fulfill the years of a long life.
Vilification cannot follow you—
thus you perfect your pure and unadulterated truth.

If one can be empty, tranquil, and pure,
compassionate, kind, loyal, and trustworthy,
filial, respectful, harmonious, and compliant,
humble, diligent, frugal, gentle, sincere, and plain,
then one is in accord with the Dao.

Thus, when the Dao is applied to the self,
the mind is enlightened and the will is unobstructed.
One values the spirit and cherishes qi,
disdains things and scorns fame.
Thoughts are not confused,
blood and qi are harmonious,
sinews and bones are nimble,
ears and eyes are keen,
skin and flesh are moist and lustrous,
the face radiates glory,
the spirit is focused and steadfast,
the body is light and strong,
the void and the full follow one another,
and the temples are lustrous.

When the Dao is applied to the household,
fathers are kind and children filial,
husbands trustworthy and wives chaste,
elder brothers good and younger brothers compliant,
the nine clans harmonious.
Farming and sericulture are timely and abundant,
granaries and storehouses are amply stocked,
the six livestock multiply,
and undertakings are well-ordered—
there is always surplus.

Thus, when ruler and minister follow the Dao, there is loyalty and kindness.
When father and child follow the Dao, there is benevolence and kindness.
When scholar and commoner follow the Dao, there is mutual love.
Where there is the Dao, there is harmony;
where there is no Dao, there is discord.
From this, we see that the Dao
cannot be departed from even for a moment.

Wenzi asked Laozi:
“What are the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual?”

Laozi said:
To be formless and non-active,
to cultivate the self within
and govern others without,
to accomplish works and establish affairs,
and to neighbor with heaven—
this is the Dao.

To nurture and rear,
to foster and grow,
to benefit all without distinction,
and to unite with heaven and earth—
this is virtue.

To be above without boasting of merit,
to be below without shame in hardship,
not arrogant in greatness,
not negligent in smallness,
to love universally without partiality,
and to endure without decline—
this is benevolence.

To support the weak when above,
to uphold integrity when below,
to be unrestrained when successful,
to remain steadfast when impoverished,
to follow the principle in uniformity,
and not to bend or distort for private ends—
this is righteousness.

To be reverent and solemn when above,
to be humble and respectful when below,
to yield and remain gentle,
to be the female of all under heaven,
to stand in non-daring,
and to establish in non-ability—
this is ritual.

Thus, cultivating the Dao leads the below to submit and serve;
cultivating virtue leads the below to follow commands;
cultivating benevolence leads the below to not contend;
cultivating righteousness leads the below to be just and upright;
cultivating ritual leads the below to revere and respect.
When all five are cultivated,
the state and household are at peace.

All the scholars of the present age
who are keen, perceptive, and discerning,
yet draw near to death,
do so because they delight in discussing others’ faults.
Those who are broadly learned, eloquent, and grand,
yet endanger themselves,
do so because they delight in exposing others’ evils.

As for those who model heaven and emulate earth,
whose kindness extends to the moving and growing,
who forget and do not cling—
they are in accord with the Great Dao.

Thus it is said:
Profound practice is called Dao and virtue;
shallow practice is called benevolence and righteousness;
superficial practice is called ritual and music.
From this perspective,
it is better to embrace the Dao and hold to virtue,
naturally pure and unadorned.

The Venerable Lord said to Lingyangzi:
“Previously, I expounded with the Gatekeeper Yin Xi
the wondrous and essential explanations in a million words,
the *Nine Chapters of the Void and White*.
The void and the white—
this is my dwelling.
The clear and the pure—
this is my abode.”

Non-action and spontaneity—this is my essence.
Simplicity and unity—this is my name.
Harmony without form—this is my function.
Responsive transformation without end—this is my change.

Spontaneity is the truth of the Dao.
Non-action is the constancy of the Dao.
Vacuity and nothingness are the honor of virtue.
Serenity and stillness are the palace of virtue.
Silence and tranquility are the spring of virtue.
Purity and clarity are the neighbors of spirit.
Sincerity and integrity are the gate of spirit.
Equilibrium and harmony are the source of all affairs.

When humans practice the Dao, those who can be spontaneous—thus the Dao may be attained and penetrated.
Those who can practice non-action—thus life may be attained and prolonged.
Those who can embody vacuity and nothingness—thus qi may be attained and circulated.
Those who can abide in serenity—thus the will may be attained and shared.
Those who can dwell in silence—thus sound may be attained and dissolved.
Those who can maintain purity—thus spirit may be attained and radiant.
Those who can uphold sincerity—thus the will may be attained and followed.
Those who can preserve equilibrium—thus transformation may be attained and obeyed.

Therefore, when ordinary people practice the Dao, they should:
With spontaneity establish their name,
With non-action nurture their form,
With vacuity and nothingness nourish their spirit,
With serenity preserve their will,
With silence cultivate their body,
With purity pacify their heart,
With sincerity guard their will,
With equilibrium preserve their spirit.

To settle the heart and roam the will—let it be like great waters naturally still.
To dwell in seclusion and quietude—let it be like the hidden dragon’s retreat.
To embrace emptiness without constraint—let it be like the bellows drawing in the void.
To transform and preserve spirit—let it be like the altars safeguarding their merit.
To establish honor and abide in spirit—let it be like ancestral temples upholding benevolence.
To make none see me—like the great fish dwelling in vast waters.
To make none know me—like the sun rising without east.
To make my life endless—like the boundless Great Dao.

The mutual attraction of the Dao is like:
Lofty mountains and vast marshes naturally drawing beasts and wolves,
Deep forests and giant trees naturally drawing birds and insects,
Rivers, seas, lakes, and ponds naturally drawing fish, turtles, and dragons,
Virtue in fullness and great peace naturally drawing qilin and phoenixes,
Sincerity and purity naturally drawing jade maidens and magic herbs,
Equilibrium and auspicious response naturally drawing virtuous omens and blessings,
Calamities and evil deeds naturally drawing misfortune and disaster.

People often depart from the Dao—it is not the Dao that departs from people.
People often lose life—it is not life that loses people.
If only the Dao and life could preserve each other,
Life and the Dao could guard each other,
And the two would never part—then one could attain longevity.

Among all that has form, humans are the most numinous.
Though their heavenly nature is the same, their cultivation differs.
Why? Those who practice goodness gradually assume the bearing of perfected beings,
While those who engage in evil transform into malevolent spirits.
Thus the Venerable Lord pitied them and commanded them to study the Dao.

The Dao of self-cultivation is the treasure of the state—
It must be cherished, it must be honored.

The root of the human body has three aspects:
First is spirit, second is essence, third is qi.
These three originate from the qi of heaven and earth.
Spirit is received from heaven,
Essence is received from earth,
Qi is received from equilibrium.
Together they form the one Dao.

Thus spirit is the chariot of form,
Qi is the carriage of spirit,
Essence dwells within.
The three assist each other in governance.

Those who desire longevity must love qi, honor spirit, and value essence.
For qi is born of essence,
Essence is born of spirit,
Spirit is born of clarity.
Humans are fundamentally the qi of yin and yang—
Qi transforms into essence,
Essence transforms into spirit,
Spirit transforms into clarity.

Therefore, those who do not wish to age should focus on guarding the primordial qi and uniting with essence,
So that it does not leave the body, but unites as one.
Then vitality will naturally appear,
The body will grow lighter,
The will will become refined—
This is the spirit-light about to arise.
The heart will be greatly at peace,
Joyful as if delighted.

If one closes the eyes and lies down,
Directing the will inward,
Not letting the inner intent stray—
Then the body will refine and the form will transform.
Thus the true principle is attained,
And great peace naturally responds.

Wondrous is this Dao!
Spirit is the ruler,
Essence is the minister,
Qi is the people.

Thus the Dao of self-cultivation:
Pacify the spirit and nourish qi,
Do not indulge in joy or anger.
If one can master this,
Qi will naturally strengthen,
The will will naturally be fulfilled,
All evil will depart,
All illnesses will vanish,
Light will naturally appear,
Good spirits will naturally respond.

Thus it is said:
The Great Dao is smooth and broad, not far from the body.

The first initial fruit among practitioners:
The nine transformations of immortal conduct.
First: follow goodness,
Second: block evil,
Third: broadly give life and aid beings,
Fourth: encourage and assist the good,
Fifth: distribute wealth and resources,
Sixth: vow to benefit others,
Seventh: be physically kind, not harming beings,
Eighth: be verbally kind, not harming beings with speech,
Ninth: be mentally kind, constantly contemplating goodness.
Always practice these nine deeds—none may be lacking.

Here ends the *Supreme Cavernous Numinous Treasure Scripture of the Six Fasts and Ten Upright Sacred Records*.
