**The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon**

Great is the Seven Treasures Palace,
Naturally born of the lotus blossom.
Resplendent, it unfolds the night’s brilliance,
In the dim and distant, the radiance of the divine abode.

Gazing upward at the Dark Truth Terrace,
Cloud towers rise in towering majesty.
Flowing splendor illumines the dark void,
Its martial might subdues the ten thousand demons.
It plucks the suffering from the depths of sin and tribulation,
Accumulating the fragrant jade of the Infant.
Through chanting and praise, the seven ancestors are delivered,
Virtue and fortune harmonize in their wake.

Supremely wondrous, the divine radiance emerges,
Formless, still, and without shadow.
Beyond all bounds, transcending all limits,
Vast and open, it universally saves all beings.
Lifting the seven mysteries from their bitter toil,
In boundless emptiness, profound and enduring stillness.
It ferries across the five rivers of suffering,
Responding to karmic resonance, ascending upon the clouds.
The Lamp King pervades the ten directions,
In the unseen, nothing remains unillumined.

Resplendent is the Dark Truth Terrace,
Its brilliance shining across the ten directions.
In the desolate cold passes, bonds are released,
The multitudes in peril secretly pass through.
The seven ancestors and the three paths are freed,
No longer dwelling in sorrow and affliction.
I bow my head to the Lamp King,
Delivering names to the Eastern Flower Palace.
I am the helmsman of the sea vessel,
Thus able to ferry the three returns.

The night’s light penetrates the hidden valleys,
Body and mind cleansed, barriers dissolved.
Misty vapors scatter to the eight extremities,
Bright illumination enters the Great Subtlety.
Revering and reciting the supreme teaching,
How towering is the fortune and blessing!

Swift winds weave through the falling void,
Silence fills the eight mounds.
The Three Primes generate shadowy clouds,
Their empty radiance illuminating the Great Nothingness.
Gazing through the ten directions,
Carefree, the sorrows and worries disperse.
The flying wheel hovers in the vast heavens,
Formless, traceless.
Footsteps vanish as the flying wheel turns,
Whispering into the profound stillness.

Donning the coarse robe, I chant the night’s light,
The myriad heavens descend to bestow their grace.
Sin and fortune arise not from fixed origins,
Near or far, they depend on the self.
If merit is not amassed in abundance,
Morning and evening, cultivate the field of fortune.
I take refuge in the Dao of Non-Action,
Ultimately embodying the Perfect Truth.

Resplendent and radiant, the light shines,
Bright and clear, no hidden corner remains.
Its brilliance transcends the darkest beyond,
Fortune descends, misfortune departs.
In orderly sequence, I observe the ten directions,
Universally saving all beings.
I adorn my Dark Truth reins,
Hand in hand, we grasp the jade tally.
The bright lamp strikes the jade bell,
Its resonance already enters the formless.
A single gaze pierces the Three Treasures,
Releasing me from the accumulated darkness of past lives.

I linger in the Seven Treasures Palace,
The wheel turns through the winding mountain valleys.
Resting beneath the canopy of karmic affinity,
Who knows how many years have passed?
My mouth rinses with the essence of golden fluid,
The cedar’s age begins with the Infant’s blossom.
Those below vie in worldly glory,
Unaware, what can be done?

The dark radiance reflects the winding valleys,
Bright and clear, it penetrates the abyssal springs.
Its flowing light intertwines in luminous splendor,
Encircling the Jade Capital Mountain.
The seven ancestors return to womb-born life,
Ascending beyond all intervals.
Lush and dense, it hovers in the empty void,
Vigorously entering the Great Clarity.

Heavenly hounds flank left and right,
The wheel turns, inclining toward the south.
Beyond the nine years of trance,
A fleeting awakening, yet the spirit remains unopened.
The seven ancestors attain womb immortality,
In the Southern Palace, they are reborn anew.
The flying wheel hovers in the empty cavern,
Gazing down a thousand, ten thousand fathoms.

Through understanding, all perceptions align,
The five mists inhale and scatter.
The body, light and free from action,
The fourfold clarity responds to the scene’s judgment.
The hells and the three evil paths,
All escape the cage of tribulation.
Whistling and singing on the Nine Mysteries Terrace,
By the cliffs, rinsing in the rushing rapids.

The mind awakens, the six senses flow freely,
Daily casting off the dust and defilement.
Rosy clouds illuminate the golden chamber,
The empty hall disperses the dark fragrance.
Through refined resonance, the numinous descends,
Though the form is solitary, the Dao is also divided.
Glancing in an instant across ten thousand kalpas,
Who perceives the passing of a hundred cedars?

The flourishing garden adorns the divine steps,
Crimson jade radiates in the purple court.
The flowing wind stirs the empty cavern,
Jade horns veil the void with their song.
Purple mists coil through the winding chambers,
Cinnabar radiance encircles the green carriage.
Flying essence thickens the dark canopy,
Feathered standards gleam in the Great Clarity.

The limpid scene extends to the ninefold boundaries,
Roaming and soaring through the wind city.
Revolving above the five sacred peaks,
I rein my steed along the ramparts of the city walls.
Gazing upward at the Dark Truth Gate,
Cloud towers rise in towering majesty.
Fragrance winds through the palace halls,
Bright lamps praise the numinous hymns.

The sun and moon shine upon my neck,
I take refuge in the Scripture of the Lamp King.
Vast and open, it pierces the eight extremities,
From this, the lotus blossoms arise.
The Dragon King holds the sea’s waters,
Thus able to rinse the fragrant vase.
The Brahmin receives this hymn,
Thereby ascending to heavenly birth.
The human king receives this scripture,
His lifespan equal to ten thousand myriad ages.
Fortune extends to the seven ancestors,
No longer bound in sorrow and affliction.
Future lives bear immeasurable causes,
Generation after generation, revering the worthy and true.

**Three Separate Hymns**

**Song of the Purple Prime Lady of the Southern Culmen**

Dark waves stir the blue-green tides,
Vast currents surge through the ten thousand streams.
I ride the light, gazing through the six voids,
Longing to wander with the perfected ones.
Yet the wondrous song finds no response in me,
To whom can this pure sound be offered?
Amid the clouds, I urge the jade wheel,
Who could be my companion in the dust?

White clouds merge with the numinous scene,
Dense and lush, entering the Great Subtlety.
Green reins gather the feathered wheels,
The emerald canopy follows the wind’s return.
Golden gates open the jade chambers,
The wind terrace and jade towers stand in array.
They welcome me to the Dragon Chariot’s hall,
Ascending the steps of the Void Sovereign.

Though the body cycles through worldly transformations,
The soul and spirit never perish for a moment.
The fortune of past lives accumulates profound karma,
Former vows now fulfilled in this present.
Wondrous is the wisdom of emptiness,
The perfected one, embodying truth, emerges.
Heavenly dragons lave at the fragrant ford,
Washing and refining my womb-born form.

To whom can these wondrous words be entrusted?
The numinous summons of the dark calling is complete.
The heart of the Dao transcends the three realms,
Merging to manifest the primordial unity.
Alone, I awaken to the formless,
Roaming freely in the great vehicle’s ease.

**Thus concludes *The Supreme Clarity Scripture of Revolving Radiance and Flying Light: Essence of the Sun and Moon*.**
