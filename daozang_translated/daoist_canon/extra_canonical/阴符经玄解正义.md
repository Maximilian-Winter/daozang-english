**"The Profound Explication of the *Yin Fu Jing* – Rectified by Ming Yi’s *Return to One* Annotation**

The *Yin Fu Jing*’s *Profound Explication* (*Xuan Jie*) was composed by **Fan Yizhong**, yet its name belies its adherence to orthodox meaning—its errors are not slight. Thus, I expound the original text’s true intent to correct them.

I too fear the punishment of idle chatter, yet *Yin Fu Jing* has been annotated by tens of scholars, each offering profound interpretations. How dare I presume to assert correctness while my own understanding remains shallow?

My late master, **Tai Xu Master**, left behind a clay bead text by **Li Zhenren**, titled *Three-in-One Resonance Symbols* (*San Yi Yin Fu*). Later, he appended a note:

*"The *Yin Fu Jing* is a single scripture from the **Kongtong** lineage, not to be spoken aloud, nor grasped by the mind alone. I once received instruction from **Er Wu Dao Ren**, but though his words were close, his claim that the Great Dao was already contained left me unsettled. For years, I pondered and re-examined it.

One day, **Li Zhenren’s teacher** arrived from afar and told me: ‘What I first heard was **Xing Xian’s** interpretation—his meaning conveyed through the text. The essence lies in transcending traces to grasp the profound. Only then will you attain it.

Recently, I heard of **Mu Ji’s** *Unveiling the Secrets of the *Yin Fu Jing***, yet his words fail to universalize the heart’s connection. The *Yin Fu Jing*’s true lineage was transmitted by the **Laozi** to the Western Regions. When **Bodhidharma** returned to China, he transmitted it once more—this is the **secret transmission beyond worldly teachings**, the marvelous principle of **mind is Buddha, form is emptiness**.

Our sect’s founder, **Zhang Chun Zhenren**, embodied and practiced it. His Dao descended from **Huolong Zhenren**, then **Chongyang Wang Zu**. In his later years, **Wang Zu** heard it and verified it with **Chunyang Lu Zu**. **Lu Zu** said: ‘The scripture’s profound essence lies in **observing Heaven and holding Heaven** (*guan tian zhi tian*). Adapt according to circumstances, act when the moment aligns. Its core secret is the **harmony of sun and moon** (*ri yue yi jie*).

**Yin and Yang** differ in essence, yet their foundation diverges—each has marvelous applications in the **foolishness of the sage** (*yu ren yi jie*). It unfolds a fresh perspective, piercingly lucid at every touch, all converging in the **return to the source** (*gui yuan yi miao*) within humanity’s **harmony** (*ren yi jie*).

Delving into its awakening and heart-transmission, the key lies in the **‘not’** (*bu*). The ultimate secret is found in the scripture’s final passage—all is derived from **ultimate stillness within the void** (*xu ji ding du*). Yet its initial approach is **stillness** (*jing*), and its culmination in **central balance** (*zhong he*) rests on the **‘kill’** (*sha*, *killing*—as in *nei sha*).

Further, nurture within the final **‘strange vessel’** (*qi qi*)—this is the ultimate path to sainthood. The sage’s method lies in **the Dao not being external to the body**, refining it into a **divine dwelling** (*shen she*). When active, it moves like **cranes in flight and fish in leaps**; when still, it is **silent as the ten thousand sounds cease**. The **True One** (*zhen yi*) returns to **original essence** (*chang zhen yuan*), and no longer is there ‘I’ or ‘divine dwelling’—**tranquility** (*jing*) is achieved.

Yet **obstacles** (*ni e*) remain unrefined. Thus, gather **precision** (*ji*) and **divinity** (*shen*), concentrate in the **void** (*xu wei*), and let the **True One** (*zhen yi*) permeate your body. **Fuse** (*hun he*) the **Three Talents** (*san cai*), awaiting the moment when **form vanishes into emptiness** (*se xiang yu xu wu*). When time arrives, the **essence of the Three Talents** (*san cai zhi yuan*) will naturally coalesce within you—abundant as if eternally possessed.

**Transformation and birth** (*hua hua sheng sheng*) unfold spontaneously, pure and ever purer. The **Three Talents’ essence** (*san cai zhi yuan*) crystallizes into a **single treasure pearl** (*yi bao zhu*), dim yet luminous, suspended before you. The **obstacles** (*ni e*) are resolved.

Then, the **pearl merges with you** (*zhu wo hu he*), and you perceive **boundless light** (*guang ming wu ji*). This is the **True One of the Three Talents** (*san cai zhen yi*) uniting with **your True One** (*wo zhen yi*)—**non-duality** (*he yi bu er*). Thus is the **embryo sealed within the vessel** (*tai jie yu qi*), the **strange vessel** (*qi qi*) itself.

The **strange vessel’s** function is vast indeed! Yet tracing its origin, it begins with **self-refinement** (*lian ji*). Only when **self-refinement is pure** (*lian ji gong chun*) may one engage the **strange vessel**. Though the scripture points to its end, this principle applies universally to **sages and commoners, men and women alike**—all who possess **inherent nature** (*xing ti*).

The world misinterprets it by clinging to male-centric explanations—this is erroneous. Its true application lies in the **unification of Heaven and humanity** (*tian ren he fa yi jie*). Hence, it states: ‘It cannot be transmitted by mouth, nor grasped by the mind alone.’

Such is the gist of this scripture. Those who read it must **clarify their heart’s insight** (*xin yan gui ming*). Though **‘separation’** (*li*) and **‘union’** (*he*) of characters and forms appear profound, they must be **integrated and understood** (*hui yi tong zhi*), sustained and nurtured, and applied with **penetrating insight** (*chu lei yuan tong*). There is **no fixed method** (*fa wu ding fa*), yet all revolves around the **four principles of ‘consumption’** (*xiao*), **‘message’** (*xi*), **‘birth’** (*sheng*), and **‘killing’** (*sha*).

There are **dual paths** (*shuang guan qi xia*), too numerous to enumerate—each holds its own. Do not neglect them, nor force interpretations. A single deviation from the true meaning leads to **falling into the three calamities** (*san zhi*), beyond redemption.

Now, I instruct you: the steps of this Dao are **threefold**. First, **humanity within the void** (*you ren wu ren*); next, **void within humanity** (*wu zhong you*); finally, **absorbing humanity into the void** (*she you gui wu*). This is the **hidden within the secret** (*tui mi yu mi zhi yi*), all emerging from **naturalness** (*ziran*).

The **Great Dao of Heavenly Immortals** (*tian xian da dao*) is fully contained in this scripture. To practice the Dao while abandoning it is to stray—where else would one follow?

If this scripture is taken as **foundation** (*ti*), its **great application** (*da yong*) can **heal the world**; its **small application** (*xiao yong*) fulfills the **Three Thousand Lines of Practice** (*san qian xing man*) and **Eight Hundred Functions** (*ba bai gong yuan*), and it can also **attain fruition** (*zheng guo*). **Wang Zu** bowed and received it.

This discourse, **Wang Zu** transmitted; **Qiu Zu** recorded. Never committed to script, it was passed orally until reaching me. Recently, those with misguided intentions have twisted the true meaning, veering into **obscenities of Yin and Yang** (*yin yang xie shuo*). Such texts bring calamity to the world. For the sake of the Dao, I expound its profound essence.

You must **take this to heart** (*zhi zhi*)." **Tai Xu Master** bowed and received it, inscribing these words at the end of *Three-in-One Resonance Symbols*.

This book indeed corresponds internally and externally with the *Yin-Yang Classics*. I have held it for forty years.

Now, my disciple Shi Sheng Zhaolin presented *The Profound Explication of the Yin-Fu Classic* (*Yin-Fu Jing Xuan Jie*) on my desk for my review. Upon examining it, I could not help but sigh three times.

This work belongs to Master Pan Yang, whose given name was Fan, of Rongyi. He derived his understanding from what he had heard, and though his intent was commendable, his transmission was incomplete, leading to an incorrect interpretation. His language is steeped in heretical doctrines, and he uses the world’s conventional *character-dissection keys* (*zhaizi jue*) to validate it—precisely aligning with what the True Person of the *Níhuán School* warned as *calamitous texts for the world*. I shall now include it in the Daoist Canon.

My ancestors and teachers must have known this long ago, hence the need to clarify the profound essence eighty years prior to avert future confusion. Thus, it is evident that the Great Dao does not remain obscured forever.

Having received the teacher’s transmission, how dare I evade the mysterious retribution? Therefore, I have carefully annotated it after Fan’s commentary, titling this work *The Rectification of the Profound Explication of the Yin-Fu Classic* (*Yin-Fu Jing Xuan Jie Zhengyi*), aiming to uphold the teacher’s transmission and illuminate the true Dao.

Moreover, I note that the *Yin-Fu Classic*’s exegeses collected in *The Daoist Canon’s Essentials* (*Daozang Jiyao*) include the *Ten True Explications*. The Ten True Ones are: *Chisongzi* (赤松子), *Zhang Zifang* (子房张真人良), *Ge Xuanweng* (太极左宫葛仙翁玄), *Xu Xun* (西山许真人逊), *Zhongli Quanshi* (正阳帝君钟离祖师权), *Lü Yanshi* (纯阳帝君吕祖师岩), *Shi Jianwu* (华阳施真人肩吾), *Cui Zhiyi* (至一崔真人), *Liu Haichan* (明公海蟾帝君刘祖), and *Cao Daochong* (玄英清虚曹真人道冲). These are all based on *sand-writing* (*sha shuo*) transmissions.

Its texts include the Tang-era *Zhang Guofu’s* (*Zhang Tongxuan*) *Explication*, the Yuan-era *Wang Daoyuan’s* (*Hunranzi*) *Explication*, and the Ming-era *Gao Shiming’s* (*Shifuxu Dao Ren*) *Corrections*—all mere scribbles. There is also *Shen Yafu’s* version, the *Cangya School’s* version, and *Yuanyangzi’s* version—all *spirit-writing* (*ji pen*) works. Beyond these, ancient annotated editions include: *Zhang Hongyang’s* preface version, *Chen Ximu’s* treasure version, *Li Qian’s* annotated version, and *Zhu Ziyang’s* annotated version. *The Essentials* did not include them—collecting texts requires discernment.

**The *Yin-Fu Classic***
Fan said: *Yin* refers to the Great Yin (month), while *Fu* denotes the interaction between Great Yin and Great Yang. A year has twelve conjunctions and twelve full moons, and the period of these conjunctions and full moons is called *Fu* (omens). Since the Great Yin borrows light from the sun, it internally contains true fire, hence it is also called the *Fire Fu*. As for *Jing* (Classic), it refers to the five-six numbers of lunar nodes, like the tides of the sea, never failing. Previous scholars mistakenly interpreted *Yin* and *cun-yin* (inch-yin) divisions as obscure—this is entirely erroneous. This is a clear exposition of the Great Yin’s true sight: within the Great Yin lies the true fire of the Great Yang. To depend on this *Fu* to steal (the essence) is indeed the profound standard for Daoist cultivation—these three characters hold the chapter’s ultimate secret.

I say: This interpretation is supremely close and unerring. Scholars who grasp this will return to the true path, avoiding empty speculation. If one clings rigidly to this interpretation and seeks it superficially, one will fall into heterodox paths and risk one’s life.

**Upper Section: Observing the Dao of Heaven, Grasping Heaven’s Practice—Exhausted.**
Fan said: *Dao* (Way) implies mutual interaction, like the initial function descending from the head—merging the head and descending, is this not the meaning of *Dao*? Yet the Dao’s function requires two persons to achieve greatness. Now speaking of *Heaven*, it refers to *Pure Yang*. This Pure Yang cannot be occupied by one alone; it requires two, and these two characters signify *Yin*. When the two merge into one, is this not the meaning of *Heaven*? As for *Observing* (*guan*), it contains profound implications: using two *mouths* (口) upon a *flower* (花), there must be a mechanism of daily revelation, hence the *Observing* character subtly contains its meaning. The opening and closing of Yin and Yang, like Heaven’s emptiness and stillness, naturally manifest their intersecting radiance. One must emulate Heaven’s retrograde motion, grasp the central transition, and fortunately attain the *Nine* as the pivot of transformation. Applying this practice to the human body reveals the *Yin-Fu*’s secret.

These two sentences serve as the entire Classic’s framework, introducing the following text.

I say: Fan did not receive the true transmission, blindly adhering to *character-dissection keys*, thereby falsely accusing the Sage and misleading the masses. Though his transmission may have origins, it is ultimately a heterodox path. This passage is the entire Classic’s overarching principle—directly interpreting the text yields *Observing Heaven, Grasping Heaven*. Thus, *Heaven* is the essence, while *Observing* and *Grasping* are its applications. Hence it is said: *Dao*, *Practice*. The character *Dao* requires no dissection. Dissecting *Dao* belongs to the lowest tier of Yin-Yang schools, unworthy of entry. This path originated with foreign monks, transmitted to China after the Han—those blue-eyed barbarian monks. Though their texts exist, our school despises them.

The direct interpretation of *Dao* is correct, as is *Heaven*. Only when dissecting *Observing* does profound meaning emerge—yet not through conventional character dissection. Dissecting *Grasping* also yields meaning. However, the method must enter through *Observing*’s true form, applying effort to emptiness and stillness, where boundless wonders unfold—truly the luminous and mysterious secrets. I wish scholars would combine and verify these interpretations. The most central and correct meanings are already revealed in this passage’s dual approach.

If one knows to dissect *Observing* through its true form, the profound exegesis will naturally appear—every aspect will align with the Dao.

Heaven has five thieves; those who see them prosper.
The five thieves reside in the heart, manifesting in Heaven.
The universe lies within the hand; ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

Fan said: The two persons’ *Heaven* encompasses the five senses—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and body—these are the five burdens.

Recognizing these five as my burdens, one can see them, yet within practice, one never departs from the use of the five thieves. The key lies in the human heart recognizing the five thieves, then applying their function to others—making them their burdens, never allowing them to become my own.

Indeed, applying the five thieves to the *Heaven* of the two persons is but like the use of a hunting hound: to grasp yin and yang in one’s hand, to let the five thieves trouble others, one must respond with ten thousand transformations as circumstances demand—thus, ten thousand transformations arise from my own body.

One scholar remarked: *"Fan’s interpretation is utterly perverse!"*
He argued that the Scripture was written solely for men, revealing his selfishness—his vital essence and spirit at work. Those who pursue deceitful Dao to achieve their ends shall surely be struck by thunder and die, or become serpentine foxes, or worse, descend into the realm of geckos, used as aphrodisiacs in men’s chambers. Such karmic retribution is inevitable.

How could he know that this passage is the Sage’s discipline of self-examination, elucidating the meaning of *manifestation* and *grasp* from the previous section? It states that when the Five Phases are upright, they become the Five Virtues; when perverted, they become the five thieves—with emphasis on the word *see*. Partial excess becomes the five thieves; if the heart discerns them and aligns with Heaven’s operation, one may then wield them in the palm and let ten thousand transformations arise from the body.

Both men and women receive the central essence of Heaven and Earth to be born, each rectifying their nature and vital force—how could there be a Heavenly Way that harms one to benefit the other?

Carefully examining the Scripture’s intent: the use of the Five Phases contains both virtue and punishment; restraining their excess and employing their moderation ensures that the source of ten thousand transformations does not become a thief.

This encompasses both men and women in demonstrating the discipline of self-examination—this is called the Great Dao.

Heavenly nature is humanity; human heart is the mechanism; establishing Heaven’s Way to define humanity.

Fan said: The *Heaven* of the two persons is inherently small, possessing natural five thieves. This mechanism of the five thieves manifests before the human heart. When the heart recognizes this mechanism, using the eyes to perceive it, it is called the *mechanism-heart*. Those who know it must still this mechanism-heart within and apply it to the *Heaven* of the two persons to establish the foundation of the Dao. Yet this foundation of the Dao does not depart from the *preheaven ‘Six-One Lead’*—the term *Six-One* is precisely what directs humanity to establish it.

Thus, heart and nature, Heaven and humanity, are essential to the Dao. There is no inch of deviation, no thread of confusion.

One scholar remarked: *"This interpretation’s core is already erroneous—what need to discuss the man who proposed it?"*

Having obscured this passage’s true intent and failing to grasp the *True One*, their heretical doctrines ensnare the heart, leading them to dissect the character *立* as *"Six-One."* They do not realize this passage speaks of humanity inheriting Heaven’s nature, with the heart as the mechanism of ten thousand transformations. The text’s essence instructs one to exhaust nature to establish fate—exhausting nature is the very foundation of the Dao! What use has the paltry *Six-Lead* for such a foundation?

Those who mistake *Six-One* for the *True One* fail to see that *Six-One* is the *True Essence*, thus confusing the common for the sovereign. This passage speaks of *nature*, the next of *fate*, yet preserving fate depends on nature, hence the necessity of exhausting nature to establish the foundation. Only by following natural principles and true understanding will the upper and lower passages cohere—why dissect the character *立*?

When Heaven unleashes its killing mechanism, stars shift their lodges; when Earth unleashes its killing mechanism, dragons and serpents rise from the land; when humanity unleashes its killing mechanism, Heaven and Earth reverse. When Heaven and humanity jointly unleash it, the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.

Fan Zhi said: The Yang principle manifests through the luminous mechanism of stars and lodges shining downward—this is Heaven’s emission. The Yin principle manifests through the mechanism of dragons and serpents surging upward—this is Earth’s emission. This is but a divided explanation.

Yet when considered holistically, Earth’s rising *qi* clusters beneath Heaven’s *qi* in mutual exchange, and Heaven’s luminous emission likewise depends on Earth’s ascending *qi*. When humanity perceives the responsive mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, manipulating Yin and Yang to invert and reverse, this *qi* lies entirely in the undivided unity of the two persons. At this juncture, they steal the *True One*’s *qi* from Heaven and Earth, seizing the mysterious essence of Yin and Yang’s transformation. This is the non-birth that generates, the non-transformation that transforms—it reverses to fulfill the profound use of *Buqian* [the uncarved block]. It is nothing but stabilizing the fixed to stabilize one’s primordial root.

This phrase—*"Heaven and humanity jointly unleash"*—holds the entire text’s deepest secret.

One scholar remarked: This passage expounds the most profound and vast principle—how Fan Zhi misapplies heretical doctrines to interpret it, truly a fool speaking in dreams! This passage establishes fate, with full attention on cultivating nature. As the saying goes: *"Let others ride the waves; I steer my own ship."* One must observe messages in stillness—after the rain, the sky clears; after the clouds part, the sun shines. Welcoming the mechanism with the Dao, ten thousand transformations arise naturally—why exert human effort?

Speaking directly by principle, one may awaken to understanding. The so-called *"killing"* contains the logic of transformation. For the Five Phases’ generative *qi*, none does not lie dormant within destructive *qi*—as when Metal generates Water, Water generates Wood, making Wood the ancestor, yet Wood encounters Metal and is imprisoned in death. Thus, generative *qi* hides within destructive *qi*—this is the mechanism of contraction and expansion, not *"killing."*

Stars and lodges, dragons and serpents—these are the traces of Yin and Yang’s waxing and waning, their successive transformations. *"Heaven and Earth reversing"* refers to the principle of Yin and Yang’s inversion. The mechanism of transformation arises from inversion—*generation* is顺 (*shun*, "harmony"), *killing* is逆 (*ni*, "inversion"). Inversion yields harmony, and thus the foundation of ten thousand transformations is set.

The first six sentences broadly describe the marvels of the Three Powers’ responses; the next two reveal boundless profound meaning, with the key lying in the initial natural emission of the mechanism—responding appropriately, neither excessive nor deficient, neither premature nor delayed, with no room for error. This demands the utmost emptiness and deepest stillness to act—Fan Zhi’s claim that this is the text’s ultimate secret is correct.

Yet by mistakenly taking *Kan* [坎] as the *True One* and forcibly dissecting *合* as *"two persons combining"*, he aligns with the three erroneous schools. How greatly does this deviate from the text’s intent?

One interpretation reads *"killing"* with a falling tone, aligning with the *I Ching*’s *Qian* [谦] hexagram. The emotions and natures of the Three Powers all abhor excess and favor humility. Yet this meaning applies only after the mechanism is unleashed, serving as a technique for transition and interaction—also a critical move in Daoist alchemy.

The character *定* in this passage also contains the dual meanings of *"stabilizing"* and *"affirming."* All such actions serve to obtain the *True One*’s foundation. Once the *True One* is attained, the foundation is established. Yet this cannot be artificially acquired through cleverness.

If one remains ignorant, they will fail to act when they should kill, or act when they should stabilize, seeking unity when they should not. A hair’s breadth of error leads to miles of deviation—this is the passage’s pivotal crux.

Nature has skill and clumsiness, capable of concealment. The nine orifices’ malevolence lies in the three essentials, governable by motion and stillness. Fan Zhi said: The *True One*’s *qi* arises from the small—without cultivation, it cannot be drawn; without technique, its use cannot be manifested. Its appropriateness depends entirely on the heart’s generation. If controlled by nature, even skill becomes clumsy. If not controlled by nature, clumsiness becomes genuine greatness. Skill demands retreat into hidden concealment—this is the apparent clumsiness, the true operation of skill.

Plundering the *True Yin* within the *True*, concealing it in secrecy, circulating through the anterior and posterior pathways, ascending and descending along the Governing and Conception vessels, flowing without stagnation—this is how one achieves enduring longevity. The vulgar fail to grasp the mystery of concealment, neglecting the nine orifices’ malevolence, thus losing their life.

Of the nine orifices, none are more vital than the ears, eyes, and mouth—the three essentials. In motion and stillness, they function as the *Taoist Canon* states: *"To close, one must first open; to weaken, one must first strengthen; to abandon, one must first establish; to take, one must first give."* The three are contained within one, and one contains the three. Though specifically referring to these three, they do not depart from the *Western Woman* [a Daoist alchemical term], hidden within—this is the critical juncture for sacred cultivation.

One scholar remarked: The *nature* here refers to the *qi*-nature that is concealed and unmoving. The *clumsy* are shackled by the burdens of turbid Yin;

The adept, too, is ensnared by the burdens of myriad responses to affairs.
All must practice concealment and stillness.
With time, great wisdom may arise—
the adept has no need for words,
the clumsy none for harm.

Carefully examining this passage, it follows the earlier discussion of *"foundation"* [基],
stating that though people are born with cleverness or clumsiness,
those who know to conceal and remain unmoving
need not be led astray by the nine orifices’ malevolence.

To forget cleverness and transform into clumsiness—
the key lies in guarding the three essentials.
One must move without moving,
for even in stillness, one is still;
even in motion, one is still.
This passage reveals the meaning of stillness generating wisdom,
showing the method for nurturing one’s nature.

Fan Zhong’s [范氏] erroneous teachings further obscure
the essence of *nature* and *fate*.
What is this "hooking and supporting with the hand"?
*Nature* may be awakened but not grasped,
*fate* may be perceived but not seized—
both are utterly empty, lacking substance.

*Nature* and *fate* dwell within the void and quietude,
alive with vitality, as the ancient texts say.
Yet to "hook" and "support with the hand" from the ordinary body of the *Western Woman*—
is this not merely the water of *geng* [癸水]?
The *Elixir Scriptures* state:
*"What is seen cannot be used;
what is used cannot be seen."*

Fan Zhong must also have known this—why then did he speak in such crude, vulgar terms?

Even the *Kun* [坤] containing *Kan* [坎]—one—still belongs to the true *yuan* [元]. What relevance does this have to *nature* [性]?
What does he take *nature* to be?

This passage follows the errors of the previous section’s lost grasp, and the next section does the same.
The focus here lies in *hidden treasures* [伏藏], while the next section builds upon the last sentence of this one.
Its core organ is the heart—only when the heart is clear can one discern the *machinations* [机].
Fire arises from its root; when disaster strikes, it must be overcome.
Delusion arises within the realm; when it moves, it must collapse.
To know this and refine—this is called the *sage* [圣].

Fan Zhong says:
The first two lines speak of those lacking sincere *precepts* and *meditation*, enslaved by the *spirit-recognition* [识神], casting their bodies into reckless action, losing their true essence, and turning into decay—like fire burning wood.

The middle two lines are a double entendre, also interpretable as the first two lines, but they also point to the *Three Women* [三女] as delusion.
Because there is movement generated within their bodies, and I, in response to their movement, cause their hearts to collapse—at the moment when *heaven* and *human* merge, I unleash my natural *killing intent* [杀机], reversing *post-heaven* into *pre-heaven*.

To know and apply this *arrow-mouth* [矢口] refinement—this is the work of the *sage*.
But this *sage* [圣]—its root is *Kan* [坎], it is *Li* [离].
It speaks of *Kan* and *Li* intersecting, drawing in the *qi* of one to return to the central earth as *king*.

Do not overlook this *sage* [圣]!

One critique says: Fan’s annotations are utterly erroneous and should not be followed.
Not only is his explanation of *knowing* [知] mistaken, but his interpretation of *sage* [圣] also violates the character’s meaning.
The *sage* [圣] is properly composed with *ren* [壬], not *wang* [王].

According to this text, *knowing* [知] is the foundation, *refinement* [修] the application—following the last sentence of the previous section.
Its essence lies in the single *knowing*—only with a foundation can there be application.
How can one refine without knowing?
Refinement is to cultivate the *machinations* of motion and stillness before they manifest.
Only by knowing the *machinations* can one act—thus, the passage’s emphasis is on *knowing*.

One may interpret it straightforwardly without seeking hidden meanings in the characters.
Its essence lies in the dissemination of the *Five Phases*—they must not be allowed to run wild without restraint.
It hangs upon the preceding text, warning: do not forget the meaning of *killing*.

The first two lines speak of *killing intent* hidden within life.
The middle two lines speak of the danger of complacency.
The last two lines speak of the subtlety of knowing how to refine.

Interpreting it directly: if life’s excesses lack restraint, disaster and delusion arise—*sages* warn against them.
The *Way* of governing the world and cultivating oneself is one and the same—this is the text’s true meaning.
Fan Zhong’s explanations are utterly mistaken and twisted. Calling it *sage-work* is a true slander of the *sage*.

As for dissecting *knowing* [知] into *arrow* [矢] and *mouth* [口], there are the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Precepts* [三皇玉诀] to verify.
Fan Zhong’s interpretation stems from later transmitted oral precepts, unaware that the *Jade Precepts* are grand and majestic—even in broad daylight, the *arrow-mouth* has its use.
It is not merely for loosening the farmer’s belt or adjusting one’s sash—even when facing an enemy, near or far, it makes no difference.
It is said: mountains, rivers, and the earth are all protectors of the *cauldron*; even the dullest living beings are potential medicines.
One must transcend the self’s form and color, still the mind’s deliberations, and retain only *qi*—boundless, without edge or limit.
The six directions and three talents are as insignificant as grains of millet.
My inner radiance shines forth, responding as if summoned—straight as an arrow, revealing *sage sun* and *sage moon*, golden light illuminating, five-colored clouds and mists floating in space, descending swiftly like a gust of wind, unimpeded.
Then the sun and moon merge, suspended in my golden court, gradually nearing and contracting, small as a bean—like a lotus lantern before the Buddha, containing all within its vastness, admitting all in its subtlety.
At this moment, not a single thought arises.

Initially, something emerges from the void, and I sense within myself a myriad of harmonious flavors and sensations—only to be intuited, never to be grasped.
The *Three Sages* [三圣] say this is the peak of *true yuan* [真元], yet still not *true one* [真一].
When *true one* arrives, it enters suddenly and silently, leaving no trace of sound or form—only an awareness of boundless tranquility, steadfast as a mountain, beyond description.

*True yuan* and *true one* move like an arrow to its mark—this is the *arrow*.
It is what the *Buddha* calls *Muni Alaya* [牟尼阿利].

As for *mouth* [口], it is the *Daoist* term for the *mysterious orifice* [玄窍], corresponding to the *wonderful instrument* [奇器] at the end of this text.
A single punch shatters it—this is the *Buddha’s* *other shore*, the *Confucian* *Non-Extreme* [无极].

In the past, when the *Thus-Come-One* taught in that land, five thousand disciples gathered.
Within the *silent treasure-light* [寂宝光], they saw a light straighten and enter the Buddha’s embrace.
The Buddha seemed as if in a drunken stupor, then awoke—hence the tale of the five thousand withdrawing.
It was said the disciples mistakenly thought the Buddha was weary and left.
This serves as proof of the *arrow-mouth*.

Fan Zhong has never heard of this.

The text within the *scripture* concerning the character **"故"** need not be deciphered through the *dismantling-character* key. Even if analyzed through such a method, its proper meaning remains intact.

This speaks of the principle of *textual mastery*—one must revert to antiquity, embodying the *Laozi’s* teaching of *"wandering in the primal essence of things."* How could one verify this through the *Sanfeng* school’s *actions*?

The preceding hundreds of words exhaust the *Heavenly Immortal’s* Dao entirely. Originally, this should not have been recorded here, but since the *arrow-mouth* was pierced through, if not fully revealed, the profound essence of the character **"知"** would remain obscured. It is not that this knowledge is only applied at this juncture—rather, its meaning is embedded within the two phrases *"self-so of Heaven and man"* from the opening. Let the reader discern this.

---
**Middle Section**

*"Heaven generates, Heaven slays"*—this is the principle of the *Dao*.
Fan Zhong says: *Heaven’s generation* is the natural unfolding of the eternal *Dao*; *Heaven’s slaying* is the inverted return against the *Dao*.
Now, with a body that follows the natural, forward-moving *Dao*, one enters the inverted, counterflowing *mystery*—thus it is called *"Heaven generates, Heaven slays."*
Yet this relies solely on the wondrous, inverted logic of *upside-down reversal*, which alone constitutes the *Great Dao* of attaining sainthood and true transcendence.

*One who grasps this* says: This passage continues the meaning and structure of the earlier *"Heaven’s killing intent"*—if the *Five Phases* lack this killing intent, the four seasons would act chaotically, and the principle of cyclical return would collapse. Within *slaying* lies *generation*; *generation* is concealed within *slaying*—thus order arises, and transformation proceeds endlessly.

*"Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things;
All things are the thieves of man;
Man is the thief of all things."*
When these three thefts are right, the *Three Powers* are at peace.

Fan Zhong says: The flourishing and withering of all things follow the revolutions of Heaven and Earth—thus Heaven and Earth are the thieves of all things. Man, unable to preserve himself, is ravaged by all things, stripping away his true nature—thus all things are the thieves of man. If man can guard himself without loss, seizing the true essence of all things, then man becomes the thief of all things. These three acts of theft complete one *trigram*; nine such thefts fulfill the *Qian* hexagram. The sequence within is merely the use of man’s *mouth* to harmonize what is fitting—thus the three *trigrams* are without fail secured through the *female*.

*One who grasps this* says: The old interpretation—*"Heaven and Earth are what all things steal; all things are what man steals; man is what all things steal"*—is the most direct.

Carefully examining the *scripture’s* intent: It follows the first profound principle of this section, using the *Three Powers* to symbolize the *Three Fields*. Applying them appropriately, without violating nature, each finds its proper place—bound as one, stabilizing the *Dao* of the *Three Powers*.

The meaning of *"thief"* is as explained above. *Taixu Wong* says that the *wonderful instrument* of the next section is inherently possessed by all things, enabling mutual theft. To fully grasp this character’s profundity, oral transmission is required. Yet it ultimately rests in being *as if foolish, as if clumsy, yet as if empty*—thus all things find peace, fundamentally relying on the principle of *harmony*. Yet Fan Zhong speaks of *"securing through the female"*—how strange! This refers to what is both *proper* and *secure*. It means the *Three Fields* must all be abundantly nourished. The abundance of the *third field* depends on a single thing, leading step-by-step to fullness. When *essence* is abundant, *qi* is abundant; when *qi* is abundant, *spirit* is abundant; when *spirit* is abundant, *essence* is fully sufficient—this is yet another *Dao*.

Such is the profound essence of this passage. The secret intent of stabilizing the *Three Powers* is revealed in the following passage. Hence it is said:
*"Eat in season, and the hundred bones harmonize;
Stir the mechanism, and the ten thousand transformations are at peace."*

Fan Zhong says: The *"故"* here follows the *"安"* [peace] of the preceding text, placing the ten characters *"安"* within the *mouth* to restore the *true one* within. Thus arises the phrase *"故曰"*—*"food"* refers to the *Great Elixir*, meaning *"those who obtain it are ever as if drunk."* Yet this must await the opportune *time*. And that *time* must manifest its *mechanism* and *symbols*. The *symbols* are the movements of the *mechanism*—this is the true moment of consumption, when man becomes the thief of all things. But with the possession of *rabbit marrow* and *crow essence*, a single consumption makes the hundred bones throughout the body harmonize. The turbid *yin* is dispelled, transforming into pure *yang*—this requires daily practice of *retreat of the yin符* and *advance of the yang fire* circulating the *Microcosmic Orbit*. With ten thousand transformations of *essence, qi,* and *spirit*, thus one meal suffices to attain peace in transformation. How could this peace be achieved without the *female*?

*One who grasps this* says: Only by not missing the *time* can one eat in season; only by not neglecting the *mechanism* can one stir the *mechanism*. The characters *"故曰"* conceal a profound meaning, also seen in the *Three Sovereigns’ Jade Key*. Its key lies in *returning*, not straying back to the ancient *"initial restoration of command."* The secret of *unification* rests in the character *"曰."*

*"Day"*—within it lies *oneness*.
Following the myriad *affairs*, the mind contracts within the *self, world, people,* and *individual*—its vastness is boundless. One lets *qi* and *mechanism* flow freely, like clouds and mist; suddenly, all sounds cease, and inner and outer are at peace. Then, with the mind focused, one feels a natural, silent stillness—*the Three Saints* call this the *true one’s* return. This is the *mysterious symbol* of *"day,"* the so-called *"formless form."*

To fixate on the *form* leads only to falsity. Only by beginning with *emptiness* can *"day," "time,"* and *"mechanism"* align with the *Dao*.

「Master Fan’s account, though ostensibly a recitation of ancient Daoist immortals’ external techniques for internal cultivation, errs when it states *"Shall one not depart from the female to attain peace?"*—this is a deviation into heretical teachings.

In my view: ancient *characters* (古字), *knowing* (知字), *affairs* (故字), *day* (曰字), *Yu* (虞字), *sage* (圣字), and others all hinge upon discerning the *times*. Yet Master Fan only understands fixation upon a single *time*, failing to grasp that *times* may be used flexibly at all moments.

Indeed, *times* have two modes—*fixed* and *active*—not confined solely to the *active* hours of *zi* (子) and *wu* (午). From *zi* (子) to *hai* (亥), each bears its own *fixed* and *active* properties.

The so-called *true one* and *true essence*, though rooted in the *self*, transcend mere fixation upon the *self*. Roughly speaking, at the onset of practice, one must intuitively perceive the prevailing circumstances to determine the *time*—this method is the most *active* and responsive.

When considering the *self* alone, the *time* has *fixed* and *active* distinctions;
When encompassing the *Three Powers* and *Six Harmonies*, the *time* likewise holds *fixed* and *active* nuances.
Thus, their mutual resonance: *fixed* responds to *fixed*, *active* to *active*—without delay, for within *times* lies *mechanism*.

When the *time* arrives, the *mechanism* stirs; when the *mechanism* moves, *transformation* unfolds—this is the wondrous principle of nature, the supreme *Dao*.

Master Fan merely sits upright and gazes at the heavens—his ears attuned to the *times*!
Men know the *divine* of the *divine*, yet fail to recognize the *non-divine* source of its divinity.
Master Fan says: *Divine* is *yang* (神者，阳也).
The *divine* of the *divine* is *yang* within *yang*—the *mysterious* yet deeper *mysterious* (即玄之又玄之谓也).
Yet this *true yang* dwells concealed within *true yin*, and seizing it is done through *direct* utterance—Brü’s *mouth-to-mouth* divine technique.

Consider: within the *knowing* (知) character, is not *direct* (矢) and *utterance* (口) implied?
Thus, it is termed *knowing the divine of the divine*.
This very technique, though seemingly mundane and unadorned, holds no trace of artificiality—it appears as *non-action* yet is *action*, and within *action* lies *non-action*.
Hence, it is called *knowing the non-divine source of divinity*.

To grasp this *yang qi*, one must employ a *strange* vessel (奇器), using the *non-divine* divine method, for when the *yang qi* arises, it is the *initial breath* of the *parents* before their birth.

A critic remarks: these two *knowings* (知), Master Fan failed to receive the true transmission, drifting into heresy. He overlooked the wondrous interplay of *exchange* within *emptiness*—the essence generated by the resonance of *self* and *other* within the void.

The upper line refers to the *true essence* born from the convergence of *self* and *other* in *emptiness*.
The lower line speaks of the *Three Powers’* *true essence* ascending through the *yang qi*, resonating with one’s own *qi* and *divine*—thus, within *emptiness*, the *true one* emerges from their union.

Examining the scripture’s intent: the *essence* drawn from the mutual resonance of *self* and *other* is merely *true essence*—thus, it is termed *the divine of the divine*, yet unworthy of reverence.
If one attains the *great resonance* of *self* and *other’s qi* and *divine*, where the *essence* descends and merges within *emptiness*, generating the *true one*—this is the seed of *sagehood*, the supreme treasure.
*Divine* meets *divine*, hence *the divine of the divine*.
Within the ultimate union, the *one* born is *emptiness* at its zenith—beyond mere *divinity*, thus termed *the non-divine source of divinity*.
The emphasis shifts downward, hence the distinction between *knowing* and *not knowing*.

The sun and moon follow their set cycles, their *fixed* and *active* properties yielding practice and enlightenment.
Master Fan says: the sun’s *yang* nature belongs to *li* (离), the lesser *yin*;
The moon’s *bright* nature aligns with *kan* (坎), the greater *yang*.
Each has its own count: the sun requires sixteen, the moon five thousand four hundred eighty.
Men mistakenly speak of the sun and moon’s degrees—this is incorrect.
The *"three before, three after"* refers to the pairing of *jia* (甲) and *geng* (庚), the union of *ding* (丁) and *ren* (壬).

For instance, in the *initial line* of the *Qian* (乾) hexagram:
First, employ *jia*’s inverse sequence paired with *wu* (午) from *gui* (癸) to *ren* (壬);
Next, use *geng*’s forward sequence paired with *wu* (午) from *gui* (癸) to *ren* (壬)—this is *jia*’s inverse sequence paired with *wu* (午) from *gui* (癸) to *ren* (壬);
Lastly, again employ *jia*’s inverse sequence paired with *wu* (午) from *gui* (癸) to *ren* (壬).
This is the *mechanism* of *"three before, three after"*—the *ascending* and *descending* phases.

Thus, three such pairings complete the *Qian* (乾) hexagram’s *initial line*,
And nine such pairings fulfill the *Qian* (乾) hexagram’s *third line*—
Only then does one reach the *pure yang* state.

This requires the sun and moon’s *times* to be *fixed* and *active* in measure—
To perfect the *sage’s* practice, gathering the *Five Phases* within the *central palace*,
Wherefrom *divine beings* and *men* arise, emerge.
This is the *divine* and *men*’s fulfillment—
Not through the sun and moon’s union yielding *brightness*, but by the *non-divine* source of divinity.

The *"three before, three after"* and *"ascending, descending"* references to *jia-geng-ding-ren* (甲庚丁壬) are indeed the *fire talismans*.
When the sun and moon’s counts are fulfilled, the *fire talisman’s* count is complete.
The moment of revelation is the very *knowing* of the *non-divine* source of divinity.

As Brü’s master taught: *"Pointing afar at the celestial sun and moon"* and *"below the earth’s tides, above the moon’s glow"*—
And as Cui Xi-Fan said: *"Heaven responds to stars, earth to tides"*—
All derive from this understanding.
This is the *Yin Symbol’s* supreme *Dao*, the untransmitted mystery of ages.

A critic concedes: counting *geng-jia* (庚甲) for the sun and moon, and *yin-yang* (阴阳) for *great* and *small*—
This is indeed the *principle* of the *Yijing*.
Master Fan’s words are correct.

Yet, this passage elucidates the *"men know"* (人知) line’s meaning—
A secret transmitted through the *nose’s center*, passed down orally for millennia,
Yet the scripture speaks of it as *"men know"* (人知).
During the Yellow Emperor’s era, practitioners of the *Dao* were many—
This teaching was universal, hence it is said: *"Men know the divine of the divine."*
Master Fan fails to comprehend, deeming this an untransmitted secret—
Thus, he calls it *"the non-divine source of divinity,"*
Unaware that the *Yin Symbol’s* highest *highest* cultivation lies beyond his grasp.»

「This passage further elucidates the *Yin Symbol’s* (阴符) *principle* (理) of the *Dao/Way* (道) as the supreme path (大道) to sainthood (成圣), the untransmitted (不传) mystery (奥义) of millennia.

　　A scholar remarks: the sun and moon are reckoned by *geng-jia* (庚甲), and *great* and *small* by *yin-yang* (阴阳)—this is indeed the *principle* (理) of the *Yijing*. Yet, Master Fan’s interpretation is correct.

The *Yin Symbol* (阴符) reveals that this section aligns with the *yin-yang* (阴阳) schools’ teachings, arriving at the *critical juncture* (机动) of their *tilting balance* (倾) and the *favorable moment* (火候) of *evenly penetrating* (平透) and *evenly responding* (平感). Though it has not yet spoken of the *Six Coordinates* (六合) and the *Three Talents* (三才), universal sensation (普感) and universal response (普应) are already present—*completely* (浑) *unifying* (合) *harmonious interaction* (交合) and *generative cultivation* (生). Yet sainthood’s *virtue/power* (功) is born here, and *divine clarity* (神明) emerges.

The *First Master* (先师), Great Emptiness (太虚) *Venerable*, thus said this section is in harmony with the opening phrase of the text. As for the *highest highest cultivation* (最上上乘), it originates from the time before *Heaven and Earth* (天地) existed and before *parents* (父母) were born—its foundation (落脚) lies beyond *yin-yang* (阴阳), *Five Phases* (五行), years, months, days, and hours. Once the *critical juncture* (机动) arises, *emotional restraint* (节情) returns to *true nature* (归性), forming a *precious gem* (宝珠) and absorbing it into the *strange vessel* (奇器). Through daily and monthly accumulation (日积月累), it ultimately merges with the *Three Talents’* (三才) *true unity* (真一)—*one without duality* (合一不二)—thus forming the *saintly embryo* (圣胎). So it is that the *Three Talents* (三才) decay, yet I endure eternally.

This is the *playful cultivation* (玄修) of the *Three Sovereigns* (三皇), still not the *secret* (秘) known by the Yellow Emperor’s era. The following passage refers to this, hence the phrase *"the unknown"* (不知). The *method* (功法) of the *hundred-foot pole* (百尺竿头) is one of *universal harmony* (左右逢源), where *all under Heaven returns to benevolence* (天下归仁). This is what the *First Master* (先师) has heard.

Yet, the *First Master* (先师) further said that the *mystic principle* (玄理) of this section is the *foundation for upright conduct* (立身之本). If this section is forgotten, then the *highest highest cultivation* (最上上乘) cannot be refined further. How can this section be neglected?

As for *stealing the mechanism* (盗机), none under Heaven can see it, none can know it. The *noble* (君子) who attains it will preserve their life, while the *petty* (小人) who attains it will risk their vitality. Master Fan says: *"Stealing"* (盗) is the *Dao/Way* (道). The *saintly virtue/power* (圣功) manifests through observing its *mechanism* (机), then applying it to *steal* (盗) the *lifespans* (夭) of both the *noble* (君子) and the *petty* (小人).

The *true yang* (真阳) of the *seven* (一七) cannot be seen by the eyes, but the *true yang* (真阳) of the *lower seven* (下一七) can only be obtained through the *spear-mouth* (矢口). The *noble* (君子) knows that the *true yang* (真阳) of both the *noble* (君子) and the *petty* (小人) must be returned through the *Ten-character Great Mouth* (十字大口) and *Small Mouth* (小口) methods, to preserve their life and ensure eternal existence. The *petty* (小人) cannot self-restraint, relying on their talents while neglecting cultivation, they fall into *evil paths* (邪道), losing their life without realizing it—hence the phrase *"lightly risking their vitality"* (轻命). This illustrates the *auspiciousness and inauspiciousness* (吉凶) of *right and wrong* (邪正).

A scholar remarks: the *"its"* (其) in this section refers to the *Dao/Way* (道) mentioned in the previous section. *"Stealing"* (盗) means *secretly taking and concealing* (密取而藏). *"Mechanism"* (机) is the *interaction of self and other* (彼我所发之机). If not concealed, it will dissipate—thus, the value lies in knowing how to *steal* (盗). None can see or know it, hence it is called *"stealing"* (盗). Yet, it is crucial to *preserve the universal mind* (普心), preventing *one-sided dominance* (偏胜). This contains the dual meaning of *"taking and giving"* (取与).

To know this is to be a *noble* (君子); to be unaware is to be a *petty* (小人). Here lies the *Heavenly Mandate* (天命). Those who *observe Heaven and embody Heaven* (观天执天) cannot afford to neglect the *mechanism of stealing* (盗机). Aligning with Heaven preserves the body, while *pursuing private gains* (挟私) through stealing leads to *lightly risking vitality* (轻命). What does *"attaining"* (得) mean? It is the *Dao/Way of taking and giving* (取与之道).

This section belongs to the *initial stages of cultivation* (小试之道), hence the warning. Master Fan fails to grasp this, so his interpretations fall into the category of *lightly risking vitality* (轻命), and cannot be followed.

**Next Section:**

聋者善视，瞽者善听。
绝利一源，用师十倍。
三返昼夜，用师万倍。
范氏曰：此指功中遇用美口之时，必须如聋者之善视，瞽者之善听。
二善喻专字之义，又含用口而心无口之谓也。
要知功中用盗，非口不能取。
丝色真一源头之利，惟口一源之用最为至要。
是先以耳目之用于机，得机上始用其口，而口一用，又缘十字以得之。
果以十字而三返根源，真如兵师之危厉。
此正火里栽莲，诚有万倍之获。
是全耳目口宵旦不辍，以成盗机之利，以起下文机心之用也。
“倍”字另有妙义，未敢笔之，请勿略也。
一得曰：上中两篇言其义理之当，然个中利弊亦道及。
下篇所言乃是功法，而义理遇焉。
从而去取损益于其间，则法备矣。
统而体之，在专一，在至静极虚而中无人我，一任自然，有有无无一以气机视之。
此中常寂寂，忘其寂，则可运至常应常静。
谨按此节首二句“专”义也，第三句“一”义也。
目利视，耳利听，聋瞽能绝其歧，则源一也。
其第四句集“益”之义也，而验于此。
得三返句，“恒”义也。
师，众也，《易》师卦之象言，畜众也，此正俦人广众之中有归仁逢源之大道。
三返昼夜，三十六时也。
三十六者，阴数之极也。
言能专而恒，则阴尽化阳，三十六宫都是春也。
十倍、万倍，约词也。
言专一则能用众，恒则愈能倍用之也。
“倍”字拆看，乃阴阳门地天作用，须连十字合参。
“万”字拆看，乃“艹禺”两字，艹属坤气，禺属阴类，此就范氏解法言之。
按理而论，用倍字作用，较胜范氏所宗。」

The *deaf* (聋者) excel in *vision* (善视), and the *blind* (瞽者) excel in *hearing* (善听).
To *sever all profit from a single source* (绝利一源), one must employ the *Master* (师) tenfold (十倍).
To *return three times through day and night* (三返昼夜), one must employ the *Master* (师) ten thousand-fold (万倍).

Master Fan says: this refers to the moment in cultivation (功) when one encounters the *beautiful mouth* (美口), requiring the *vision* (视) of the *deaf* (聋者) and the *hearing* (听) of the *blind* (瞽者).
The two *excellences* (善) illustrate the meaning of *single-mindedness* (专), and also imply *using the mouth while the mind remains without attachment* (用口而心无口).
Understand that in cultivation, *stealing* (盗) must be employed, and without the *mouth* (口), one cannot *take* (取).
The *true one* (真一) of the *silken threads* (丝) and *colors* (色) lies at the *source* (源头), and the *use of the mouth as a single source* (口一源) is most critical.
First, one must apply the *ears and eyes* (耳目) to the *mechanism* (机); only after attaining the *mechanism* (机) does one employ their *mouth* (口), and once the *mouth* (口) is used, it is through the *Ten-character* (十字) method.
If one truly employs the *Ten-character* (十字) and *returns three times to the root source* (三返根源), it is like the *precise and perilous* (危厉) tactics of a *military strategist* (兵师).
This is akin to *planting lotuses in flames* (火里栽莲), truly yielding *ten thousand-fold gains* (万倍之获).
It is through *uninterruptedly preserving ears, eyes, and mouth* (全耳目口宵旦不辍) that one achieves the *advantage of stealing the mechanism* (盗机之利), thus giving rise to the *application of the mind’s mechanism* (机心) in the following passage.
The *character "bai"* (倍) holds another profound meaning, which I dare not commit to writing—please do not overlook it.

A scholar remarks: the *first two sections* (上中两篇) discuss the *correctness of their principles* (义理之当), yet they also hint at their *advantages and disadvantages* (利弊).
This *section* (下篇) speaks of the *method* (功法), while the *principles* (义理) are encountered within it.
From this, one must *discriminately adopt or abandon* (去取) and *assess gains or losses* (损益) accordingly—then the method is complete.
To *comprehend and embody* (统而体之) it lies in *single-mindedness* (专一), in *ultimate stillness and supreme emptiness* (至静极虚), where there is no *self or other* (人我), and one *fully trusts in nature* (一任自然), perceiving *presence and absence* (有有无无) solely through *qi and mechanism* (气机).
Here, there is *constant quietude* (常寂寂); if one *forgets this quietude* (忘其寂), then one can *operate* (运) to reach *constant response and constant stillness* (常应常静).
This passage’s first two lines elucidate the meaning of *single-mindedness* (专), and the third line, that of *oneness* (一).
The *eyes* (目) profit from *vision* (视), the *ears* (耳) from *hearing* (听); the *deaf* (聋) and *blind* (瞽) can *sever their distractions* (绝其歧), thus *unifying the source* (源一).
The fourth line gathers the meaning of *benefit* (益), verified here.
The phrase *"return three times"* (三返), carries the meaning of *constancy* (恒).
*Master* (师) means *the multitude* (众); in the *Yijing’s* *Master Hexagram* (师卦), it speaks of *accumulating the multitude* (畜众), which is precisely the *Dao/Way* (道) of *returning to benevolence* (归仁) and *encountering the source* (逢源) amid a crowd.
*Return three times through day and night* (三返昼夜) refers to *thirty-six hours* (三十六时).
Thirty-six is the *extreme of yin numbers* (阴数之极).
If one can be *single-minded and constant* (专而恒), then *all yin transforms into yang* (阴尽化阳), and the *thirty-six palaces* (三十六宫) are all *spring* (春).
*Tenfold* (十倍) and *ten thousand-fold* (万倍) are *approximate terms* (约词).
They mean that *single-mindedness* (专一) allows one to *employ the multitude* (用众), and *constancy* (恒) further enables *tenfold or ten thousand-fold application* (倍用).
The *character "bai"* (倍), when deconstructed, reveals the *yin-yang* (阴阳) *gateway and foundation* (门地) of *Heaven’s operation* (天作用), which must be *connected with the Ten-character* (十字) for full understanding.
The *character "wan"* (万), when deconstructed, reveals the *two characters "cao-yu"* (艹禺): "cao"* (艹) belongs to *Kun-qi* (坤气), and *"yu"* (禺) belongs to the *yin category* (阴类). This is in accordance with Master Fan’s method of interpretation.
By *reasoning* (按理), the *application of "bai"* (倍) surpasses what Master Fan adheres to.

「Yet according to the *orthodox interpretation* (正义), it merely states that the *Dao/Way* (道) is not cultivated in isolation. Scholars who follow this scripture’s *true essence* (正宗) will find that even in solitary practice within a single chamber, if one attains the *True One* (至真一) and *True Essence* (真元) of the *void* (虚空), the harvest would be *tenfold* (十倍) or *ten thousand-fold* (万倍) beyond measure.

This scripture’s *orthodox interpretation* (正义) does not lie in deconstructing characters. The intent of this passage is to establish *command* (命), while its meaning focuses on the *nature* (性). Indeed, *command* (命) is rooted in *nature* (性)! Scholars who examine it carefully will understand what they must pursue.

*The heart-mind* (心) arises from things and perishes from things; its trigger lies in the eyes. Master Fan says: When the *heart-mind* (心) is drawn by the *mechanism* (机) of things, this is the *operation of things* (物之用), though the *heart-mind* (心) may arise, it is itself hastening its own demise.

When the *heart-mind* (心) is not drawn by the *mechanism* (机) of things, it instead makes things serve its own *operation* (用), which is the *heart-mind* (心) attaining its own life through its own demise. This is the meaning of *neither death nor life, nor life nor death* (不死不生，不生不死).

However, the path of life and death is determined by using the eyes to observe the *mechanism* (机), serving as the *bridge for Dao/Way practice* (办道之津梁). The *heart-mind* (心) relies on the eyes’ *operation* (用), and must learn to remain as *immovable as the dead* (不动), which is the most crucial *observation* (上看).

*A True Attainment* (一得) says: To be drawn by things and have one’s *emotions* (情) move is to *arise from things* (生于物). To be enslaved by things and have one’s *spirit* (神) exhausted—exhaustion leading to decay—is to *perish from things* (死于物). Though the *heart-mind* (心) experiences life and death through things, in truth, it has already transcended life and death.

Whenever one *arises from things* (生于物), if one can *awaken and illuminate* (觉照), then the *mechanism of death* (死机) will vanish. The *mechanism* (机) is discerned solely through the eyes.

The eyes are the *Heavenly Eyes* (天目), located between the two brows—not the physical eyes—and serve as the *True One* (真一)’s foundation. By using the eyes to *gaze upon the mechanism* (瞩机), myriad threads of the *mechanism* (绪) emerge, shifting and unpredictable. Yet if the eyes can perceive the threads and grasp the *mechanism* (绪), the *mechanism* (机) cannot escape detection. The eyes’ *operation* (用) is indeed vast!

Thus it is said: *“The heart-mind arises from things and perishes from things”* (心生于物，死于物). And again: *“Its trigger lies in the eyes”* (机在目). This teaches that one must rely on the *True One* (至真一) for governance. Whether one employs its *operation* (用) depends on the *heart-mind* (心), hence the value of *heart-mind clarity* (心明). *Heart-mind clarity* (心明) is the ability to perceive *nature* (性), so the practice must focus on *heart-mind clarity* (明心) as both its beginning and end.

Examining the *character "mu"* (目), it aligns with the *core principle* (主脑) of the *observation* (观) in the previous section. The *Sages* (圣人) employ the eyes precisely to illuminate the *heart-mind* (心), though their intent lies beyond the words.

Reflecting on the *upper and lower scriptures* (上下经文) in stillness, their profound meaning becomes evident. Beneath the *Dao/Way*’s apparent lack of *en* (恩), the greatest *en* (恩) arises. Even the swiftest thunder and fiercest wind cannot fail to stir the *innate response* (蠢然).

The *supreme joy* (至乐) is the *nature*’s overflow, the *supreme stillness* (至静) is the *nature*’s restraint. The *Dao/Way*’s ultimate *selflessness* (至私) manifests as ultimate *public benefit* (至公). Master Fan explains: The *non-separation of two* (二人之不间) refers to those who do not indulge in the *entanglements of mundane emotions* (尘情之拘扰), maintaining the *natural flow of the constant Dao/Way* (常道顺生). This is the state of *lacking en* (无恩).

When the time arrives and the *supreme mechanism* (至机) appears, the *great medicine* (大药) is born. At this moment, one must distinguish *ren-gui* (壬癸) to harmonize *geng-jia* (庚甲). Swallowing this into the *abdomen* (腹中), it transforms back into the *primordial body* (乾体), granting *long life* (长生)—is this not the greatest *en* (恩)?

Yet the *confluence of metal and wood* (金木之并) lasts only as long as the *fierce wind* (烈风), and an additional *strike at the crown* (当头一震) causes a sudden awakening—*innate response* (蠢动)—and one breaks free from *madness and delusion* (狂迷), revealing the *Heavenly True Self* (天真吐露). This is entirely due to the *divine impact* (神此—击).

Thus, Master Lü said, *“Within the thunderous clap, the root is naturally attained”* (霹雳声中自得根), which serves as evidence.

Even a *single clod of earth* (一厶之小土) struck from the *Fu position* (兑中) produces a *thread of white gold* (一丝之白金). Though small, it can nourish the *Six Harmonies* (六合). A *single clod of earth* (一厶之小土) is inherently *pure and tranquil* (清静), receiving a *drop of celestial yang* (一滴之青阳) without struggle or contention. Though its *restraint* (廉) is slight, the *function and operation* (功用) of the *two persons’ single clod of earth* (二人一厶土) belong to the *invisible private* (不可见之私). Yet when *Great Void* (太空) strikes with a single *resonance* (震), it returns to the *True* (真), revealing the *operation* (用) within the *single clod of earth* (一厶土) of *self and others* (人我), hence also called *public* (公). Thus, these *four “zhi” terms* (四至字) all point to the essence of *central harmony and preservation* (归中守中).

*A True Attainment* (一得) says: *Supreme joy* (至乐) is the *nature*’s movement (动), *overflow* (余) is its external excess. *Supreme stillness* (至静) is the *nature*’s fixation (定), *restraint* (廉) is its internal constraint. The *dynamic response* (动) of thunder and rain is full and abundant, hence the *overflowing effect* (充溢之应). Swift thunder and fierce winds must transform, so one must guard against *excess and dissipation* (侈放之愆). *“Even the swiftest thunder and fiercest wind cannot fail to stir”* (莫不蠢动) is the *public operation* (用之公). Only those cultivating the *Dao/Way* (修道者) benefit from the wind and thunder, uniquely receiving *Heaven’s great en* (天恩) as *private* (私). The profound *Dao/Way*’s meaning here is such.

No sensation surpasses the impact of *wind and thunder* (风雷), so this passage aligns with the *orthodox interpretation* (正义) of *“good hearing”* (善听) from above. The previous passage corresponds to *“good vision”* (善视). Both passages emphasize the *spiritual acuity* (视听之灵) of the eyes and ears.

Only when one *responds to the mechanism without stagnation* (应机不泊) does the following passage on *subduing the beast* (制禽) unfold in its *operation* (用). Master Fan’s teachings can be selectively applied, but one must grasp their intent and practice within the *void and stillness* (虚寂). If one becomes mired in the *traces* (迹), it will no longer be the *Great Dao/Way* (大道).

The *subduing of the beast* (制禽) lies in *qi* (炁). Master Fan says: This passage specifically discusses *zui* (隹), illustrating the *marvelous operation* (妙用) of *Heaven and humanity* (天人) in unison. Its *operation* (用) is through *zui* (隹), not the *form* (形). This is akin to the *crane’s communication through sound* (鹤以声交).

The intent of *using zui* (用隹) is not the *zui within the body* (身中之隹). If one does not employ *cultivation strength* (功力) to control it, *zui* (隹) will not manifest. Without *zui* (隹), the *task and governing vessels* (任督) remain blocked, and the *paths of ascent and descent* (升降路) are obstructed. Even if attained, it will be lost, lacking the means for *summoning, subduing, concealing, and storing* (招摄伏藏).

Indeed, *zui* (隹) is the *yang essence in humans* (阳人), gaining *yang* (阳) brings life, losing *yang* (阳) brings death. It is the *halfway point between immortals and ghosts* (仙鬼之各半). Practitioners of this *operation* (功) must *eliminate yin and augment yang* (去阴益阳).

Yet when the *spirit* (神) is lost in the *flurry of worldly affairs* (纷华), and *qi* (气) is depleted by *attachment and desire* (爱欲), without this *mechanism of mutual response and control* (相机以制，相感以隹), how could one return to the *original foundation* (本原)?

*A True Attainment* (一得) says: Master Fan’s exposition here is worthy of the terms *profound and insightful* (玄解), with no flaw in its reasoning. It is regrettable that the *character "guan"* (观) in the previous section was not deconstructed according to the *Hongwu Zhenyun* (洪武正韵) but instead followed the *erroneous method of "tie-ti"* (贴体), leading to the misguided notion of *“applying the two mouths to the fine flower”* (用夫二口于佳花之上).*」

「If one deconstructs the *character "zhuì"* (隹) as intended, then the meaning of this passage and sentence becomes clear. For *zhuì* is a swift and sensitive bird—when its mechanism is touched, it immediately acts. Hence, the *character "jiàn"* (见) is placed on its right.

This is how one discerns the nature of *zhuì*: by using *qi* (炁) to control it, so that *zhuì* does not perceive it. When the time comes and the mechanism is at hand, the two *qi* (炁) having met, *zhuì* will naturally cling and merge, forgetting its own thrust. Such is the meaning of the *character "guān"* (观), and its application lies in the *qi* (炁).

What *qi* (炁) is this? It is the *qi* of the *Kun* (坤) element. For this bird is the *li* (离) crow, embodying the true essence of the *jīng* (精) and *liúzhū* (流珠). Its nature is swift and sensitive. Does it not say in *Cántóng Bù* (参同不云乎): *“The Great Yang flows the pearl, ever desiring to abandon [the vessel], yet ultimately attains the essence, transforming to sustain each other”*? What is this *jīnhuá* (金华)? It is the *qi* of the *Kun* element.

When the time arrives, the *kǎn* (坎) marrow ascends—this is the *tùsuǐ* (兔髓), and when *kǎn* and *lí* unite, it condenses into white fluid, solidifying until it is firm. When condensed, it does not disperse—this is the *control* (制). Such is its effect, a marvel of nature’s operation. The key to its attainment lies in its pristine, undisturbed state.

*The Classic of Changes* (易) states: *“Exalted is the *Kun* element, from which all things derive their life, thus following and conforming to Heaven.”* This is the essence of this passage, though Master Fan has not yet grasped it. Life is the root of death; death is the root of life. Grace arises from harm; harm arises from grace.

Master Fan says: *“Death is the Way’s constant operation; life is the Way’s inverted function.”* When the Way’s constant operation generates life, it means the *spirit* (神) is lost in emotional desires, and thus the *essence* (精), *qi* (气), and *spirit* (神) are depleted, inevitably leading to death. Hence, life is considered the root of death. When the Way’s inverted function generates the body, it means the *spirit* (心) is extinguished by emotional desires, so the *essence* (精), *qi* (气), and *spirit* (神) remain intact, inevitably leading to life. Hence, death is said to be the root of life. This aligns with *Zhìyáng’s* (紫阳) teaching: *“Only treat the gate of death as the gate of life; never mistake the door of life for the door of death.”*

In summary, by applying the Way’s inverted *mechanism of mutual response and control* (伏藏), one’s body not yet dead, must first learn the Way of death, only then can one achieve full life. Just as dragons and serpents rise from land due to the *tēng* (腾) of nurtured *qi* and blood; thunder and lightning strike, winds blow, because of the timing of the *Dāntái* (丹台) and *yuèyìn* (月印). Hence, grace arises from harm. When *jiānxié* (奸邪) is hidden within the realm, it marks the moment of inevitable collapse into theft and plunder; when leaves flourish and flowers bloom, it reveals the completion of *yin* depletion and *yang* return. Hence, harm arises from grace.

The following two sentences speak to the timing of the *fire candidate* (火候). Its relation to the *mechanism of mutual response and control* (相负) of *xíng* (刑) and *dé* (德) should be examined together. *A True Attainment* (一得) says: *“The five phases mutually generate life and death, hence grace and harm also rely on and conceal each other. This passage logically follows the text, and its meaning is sufficient. It serves as an introduction to the following section, continuing the significance of the *character 'zhì'* (制). The key lies in discerning *qi* mechanisms, preventing them from becoming excessive or one-sided, and responding to them with counter-control. Then success is achieved—harm is transformed into grace, death into life.”*

The next passage reveals the method for practical application. The *fire candidate* (火候) depends on timing, which is the means to verify the *qi* mechanisms’ sequence and reliance. The *adoption and extraction* (采取) lies in substances, which is the means to balance the excesses and deficiencies of *yin* and *yang* within one’s body. Its application is profound; its mechanism is subtle. Yet it does not exceed what this passage has spoken.

The purpose of this passage is to say that only those who exhaust their nature can achieve the Way’s full potential. From this passage onward, it focuses purely on the principles of life and death, yet within it still lies the nature that governs them. Master Fan’s explanation here also has merits worth adopting.

The unenlightened say: *“The patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth are sacred.”* I say: *“The patterns and principles of time and matter are profound.”* Master Fan says: *“Yú* (禺) is the mother monkey. The *Yú* of Heaven and Earth, with its abundant *qi*, naturally reveals the sacred patterns and principles, as the sign of *kǎn* and *lí* uniting, entering the center to form soil. This is the meaning of observing Heaven and Earth—it is not the mundane study of celestial omens and terrestrial features, but the profound range of the *numbers of the sun and moon* (日月有数), the *fixed order of great and small* (小大有定), and the *harmonious manifestation of Heaven and man* (天人合发). It is the Way of seizing the *spirit’s* mechanism and altering one’s fate, entirely contained here. Hence, the patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth are called sacred, as the unenlightened know them.”*

I say: *“The numbers of the sun and moon, the fixed order of great and small, and the timing of mechanisms—by using the unmanifested *spirit* (不神之神) to compel it to steal these mechanisms, and thus reveal the sacred patterns and principles, the principles of time and matter harmonize the sacred and the profound. One can further, in the midst of chaotic material inducements, command the sacred patterns and principles of Heaven and Earth to operate silently within oneself, and thus balance the *qi* mechanisms through the profound principles of matter. This timing’s patterns and principles are what we encounter from morning to evening, in the most familiar and ordinary of places—this is the crucial key for transforming the sacred and the mundane.”*

People cannot err in this; please examine it carefully.

*A True Attainment* (一得) says: *“What is manifest externally is the *patterns* (文); what is internal and harmonious is the *principles* (理). Both the sacred and the profound understand and penetrate these. Though they may know the celestial patterns of stars and constellations, and the terrestrial principles of mountains and rivers, even if they understand the omens and symbols, they are merely traces of Heaven and Earth, not the Way of Heaven and Earth itself. ‘Time’ encompasses both Heaven and man. Heaven has fixed times, the human body has its own rhythms—these shifts and manifestations all have distinct patterns and orderly principles, which must not be misapplied when practicing. The use of time is vast indeed! ‘Matter’ refers to what is opposite to me, meaning humanity. The traces and symbols seen below coalesce into human patterns. The *spirit* (神) and *qi* (气) that manifest above each have their own order, and their responses and unions do not disrupt one another. The use of matter is broad indeed! Those who dedicate themselves to the Way all seek it from Heaven, Earth, time, and matter. Yet what people overlook is that the great Way lies within time and matter themselves. The flow of *qi* mechanisms through Heaven and Earth, when calculated and verified, is what the eye perceives—”*」

「The interplay of ebb and flow in resonance with Heaven and Earth’s time and matter, silently embodied and verified, is unseen by the eye—this is the essence of *Yinfu* (阴符). Such is the principle of straightforward interpretation.

This passage illustrates the fundamental precepts of two traditions, each refining the essence of life and vitality through subtle yet profound mechanisms. The "foolish and fearful" approach to attaining sainthood refers to the female principle, as described in the *Zuozhuan* (《左传》): "Women are the *yang* (陽) of matter; their nature is singularly tranquil and focused." One must begin with the mind, thus harmonizing with the innate patterns of Heaven and Earth’s *wenli* (文理, cosmic order) to merge with the *true unity* (真一) born from the union of *qi* and emptiness, forming the *sacred embryo* (聖胎).

I, however, advocate the use of *wu xin* (無心, non-mindfulness), relying solely on the sufficiency of Heaven and Earth’s *wenli* and *qi* mechanisms. When the *qi* manifests in time, reaching ultimate emptiness and stillness, the *qi* naturally converges, and with true intent enveloping it, the *sacred embryo* is formed. For the *foolish* (愚, here referring to *Yin* or female principle) has no inherent mind; its *qi* is easily responsive. I, being inherently *zhong shi* (中實, complete and substantial), can only accept what is truly *void* (虚, empty). Such is the principle.

The core teaching of *Yinfu* reveals that the *foolish* (愚) and I each occupy our own realm, yet both possess *qi* mechanisms that transcend externally while never detaching from their own bodies. This creates a mystic interplay of presence and absence. The Three Realms (三才, Heaven, Earth, and Humanity) and the One Primordial (一元) fill the Six Directions (六合), and as we refine our practices, we each attain the realm of *voidness* (虚無). The Three Realms (三才) and Three Treasures (三宝), resting in *wu* (無, non-duality), meet in perfect harmony.

When *wu* (無) encounters *wu*, their union is seamless and undivided. Yet within this void, each contains *yin* and *yang*; in emptiness, they copulate and transform. To describe its marvels, one would exhaust the bamboo of the Southern Mountains—yet still not suffice. The deeper the void and stillness, the more vibrant the interplay of all transformations becomes, and the more abundant what is produced will be.

When one does not lose the proper timing, and in stillness receives the essence of matter, each gains their own fulfillment. The *foolish* and I, within this framework, each accumulate jade into mountains and spread gold across the earth. This is the foundation and manifestation of the earlier passage on "Heaven’s Killing Mechanism" (天发杀机).

The Sage unifies male and female, universally guiding all beings. Thus, there follows a further passage to elucidate distinct methods for transformation. Its essence is profound, yet its application is utterly simple and accessible. Yet few, past or present, have truly comprehended this text, for it was never transmitted through oral instruction.

Once one secretly grasps the master’s intent, the profound essence is revealed entirely—may those who see it strive together.

People attain sainthood through foolishness and fear, while I do so without them. People seek sainthood through the extraordinary, while I do without it.

To sink into the depths of water and fire is to court self-destruction.

Fan Zhi (范氏) says: "Foolishness" refers to one who does not discern, does not know, and remains muddled and unaware. This is the saying that one must act like the foolish. "Fear" means dreading that others might perceive my actions, and it also refers to explaining the *central palace* (中宫) through words. "Sainthood" is not aligned with ordinary paths, hence the phrase "attaining sainthood through foolishness and fear."

I, holding the universe within my grasp, see all transformations birthed from the body. The interplay of *Kan* (坎, water/yin) and *Li* (離, fire/yang), the union of *jin* (金, metal) and *mu* (木, wood), the emergence of the sacred function and divine clarity—all arise naturally from the Way of *wu wei* (無為, non-action). Thus, I attain sainthood without foolishness or fear. This is the hidden meaning behind the phrase "foolishness and fear" (愚虞).

Once one attains this understanding: Fan Zhi’s mistaken interpretations stem from treating the text as exclusively for men, clinging to the literal meaning of the characters, and failing to receive oral transmission. Relying solely on private reasoning, he further misconstrues the Primordial as merely *one* (一), exhausting his mind in vain and falling into erroneous paths.

It is better to follow the text’s straightforward meaning, and its significance will naturally become clear.

"Fear" (虞) is "degree" (度); "Sainthood" (聖) is "universal clarity" (通明). "Foolishness" (愚) means remaining fixed and tranquil like the foolish, though in truth, one is not foolish. "Extraordinary" (奇) refers to miraculous and divine applications. The Way of sainthood is natural, not extraordinary. Forcing extraordinary actions leads only to self-destruction.

The intent of this passage is to set the stage for the following discussion of "naturalness" (自然). Though it appears simple, its profundity is vast.

In the time of the Yellow Emperor (黃帝), the Way was spoken of without mention of *elixirs* (丹). Later ages introduced myriad explanations, yet they could be summarized by the two characters: *body* (身) and *mind* (心). According to this passage, it builds upon the previous one, presenting a fresh perspective—embracing the wonder of unity within multiplicity, and the grand Way of mutual completion.

Yet this is not achieved through artificial means. Hence, the following passage emphasizes the word "natural" (自然).

It states that one must enter through stillness (静), and that attaining the utmost stillness and emptiness to utilize extraordinary methods is the true practice. Even shattering the void into fragments is the ultimate goal.

The text still conceals its secrets, leaving them undivulged. The profound meaning of this passage must be unlocked through the oral transmission of Lu Zu (吕祖, Laozi’s immortal disciple).

If one says the previous passage spoke of the rules for entering, then within the cycles of day and night, large and small, there lies the application of divine clarity. This passage’ method, however, overturns all such applications—day and night, large and small, the patterns of time and matter, etc.

This is the art of encompassing the Three Realms (三才) as one, wearing lofty footwear and heavy robes, all as a single body. Moving and still, all living things are companions on the Way.

The innate nature encompasses the perfect whole like a suspended marble.

Yet, when the time comes to advance the fire or withdraw the talismans, one sits atop the marble’s apex to observe the fire’s readiness—this is the expansion of the *yīn-è* (鄞鄂) function. Once the fire’s readiness is complete, the body then penetrates into the marble, congealing and nourishing, thus resting the primordial spirit and also calming the *yīn-è*. At this moment, the ears and eyes perceive nothing, and the external form is foolish indeed—yet one does not know that great wisdom as foolishness is the path to sainthood. Heaven and earth undergo reversals, and the inner form is strange indeed—yet one does not know that harmonious interaction, not strangeness, is what makes one a sage.

For the previous passage’s method, it points to the true *qi* of the Three Realms dispersed as the expansion of my *yīn-è*—this is merely my true unity aiding, yet still unrelated to my primordial unity. This is but the Buddhist accumulation of relics in the body. The final passage’s extraordinary methods are the distinction of true unity, and their application is vast—all these are the ultimate principles of the Dao. If not aligned with the natural, one falls into peripheral doctrines. One sinks into fire and water.

The essence of the sacred scriptures is thus: The Dao of nature is still, so heaven and earth and all things are born. The Dao of heaven and earth is *jìn* (浸, permeating), so yin and yang prevail. Yin and yang interact, and transformation follows naturally.

Master Fan says: The Dao of nature being still is the primordial *Tàijí* in its pristine unity—stillness reaching its peak, then movement, generating heaven and earth as the grand ritual. The two forces interweave, then transform into all things—this reveals the natural cultivation of the primordial Dao in response to the times.

Yet the Dao of yin and yang, heaven and earth, is the ceaseless flow of *qi*, circulating and returning, gradually purifying until, at the appointed time, yin and yang prevail and interact. I then respond, filling and replenishing, making transformation smooth and ensuring all beings fulfill their nature—this reveals the phenomena of the postnatal *qi* conforming to the times. And conforming to heaven’s times is to know the moment when heaven and humanity act in unison—the time to move, the time to eat, the time of day and night’s waxing and waning—these are the roots of fire readiness.

One comment says: *Jìn* means mutual penetration and infusion. Yin within yang, yang within yin—thus, yin and yang prevail. Master Fan’s explanation here is deeply attuned to the Dao’s subtlety.

Yet one must know: when there is form, the function is equal to formlessness—reaching the point of utter formlessness while still appearing as if there were form. Upside-down, topsy-turvy—its profound meaning can be intuited but cannot be spoken. All is rooted in the utmost emptiness and profound stillness. Emptiness to its extreme means no obstruction, unhampered by postnatal influences, and able to refine with the Dao, returning to emptiness. Only then can one achieve stillness, and stillness brings clarity—when the moment arrives, one is aware, not confused, and actions are appropriate, avoiding the flaws of misaligned timing.

This is one moment, its mechanisms manifesting in primordial, postnatal, what should be welcomed, and what should be released. When it is time to advance, advance the fire; when it is time to withdraw, withdraw the talismans. Though natural, it must be guided by intent. And intent has its suppressions and elevations, its yielding and firmness, its slowness and haste, its penetration and concealment. From here, transformation arises, and saintly achievement emerges.

The late Master Tàixū Wēng said: “The sage transmits the medicine but not the fire, not because it is withheld, but because fire readiness arises with the times and acts according to the moment. Following a template like painting a gourd is impossible. The highest alchemical method is transmitted through the heart. The middle method must be orally instructed. The lowest method must be written down—its methods are cumbersome.

*The Yīnxú* scripture’s text is in cloud-like seals, spanning over ten feet, obtained by the Yellow Emperor from the *Kōngtóng* Celestial Altar. Even the Emperor’s wisdom relied on question-and-answer to clarify it. The versions revered today are those the Yellow Emperor personally inscribed, though written, their profound meaning lies in heart transmission. To rest in the essence of the text is to grasp its highest teaching.

Laozi further said: ‘Humans follow Earth, Earth follows Heaven, nothing follows the Dao, the Dao follows nature.’ The first sentence here, the Yellow Emperor has already revealed the essence. It shows that one must stand firm from before one’s parents were born, before heaven and earth existed, before creation left any trace. Knowing to align with nature is to return, drop by drop, to the source, and to merge, head by head, with the Dao.”

He also said: “The previous passage encompasses day and night’s waxing and waning, the patterns of time and matter—all things, sweeping them all away. Yet within this passage’s yin and yang transformations lies the meaning of knowing the times—this must be deeply understood. The intent of the previous passage warns against rigid adherence to forms; the intent of this text warns against neglecting the moment. My teacher, the *Níhuán* Master, said that what should be orally transmitted are precisely these profound truths.”

One comment notes: In this passage, the character “摧” (*cuī*, crush) in ancient and modern editions is uniformly written as “推” (*tuī*, push). Following the *Yìjīng*’s phrase “just and yielding push against each other,” this “摧” should indeed be “推.” The *Tàiwéi*律院’s hidden preceptor, with the national teacher and high scholar Wáng Kūnyáng, received transmitted artifacts. From the Chióu Ancestor onward, successive true persons passed down robes, bowls, scrolls, and as-you-will staves—among them, the *Kōngtóng Question-and-Answer*, bearing the Song Emperor Taizong’s imperial seal, titled as Chen Xīyí’s treasured edition, with Zhòngyáng Wángzǔ’s personally inscribed transmission precepts preserved. This is the ancient text from before the Song and Yuan dynasties, written with “摧.” Thus, this edition’s “摧” must have its source, not a scribal error.

Referring to the *Yìjīng*: “The dragon battles in the wild, its blood black and yellow”—the meaning of mutual crushing. One comment thus retains “摧” as in Master Fan’s text.

The preceding passage’s phrase *"knowing and cultivating"* is rendered as *"修之"* in the *Lǜyuàn* Lü edition alone—other versions read *"修炼"*—its syntax being more archaic. For the *Fàn* lineage’s text must derive from the *Lǜzōng* tradition, its entire structure—chapters, sections, and phrasing—conforms strictly to the *Fàn* edition, not the divided titles of other versions. Thus, the Sage knew the **Dao of Nature** could not be defied and accordingly regulated it.

The **Way of Supreme Stillness** transcends the reach of calendrical and astronomical measurements. There exists a wondrous **instrument**—the source of all things, the origin of **qi**, the foundation of ten thousand transformations, and the progenitor of the *Yīnfú*. The Sage employed it as the initial ground for practice; with it, one may **establish** and **slay**; with it, one may **plunder** and **steal**; the non-divine becomes divine through its use; the eight trigrams, *jiǎzǐ* cycles, and water-metal correspondences all reverse their motion through it; the confluence of heaven and humanity, the meeting of spirit and concealment—all depend on its function.

This **instrument** is the art of **yin-yang overcoming**. When applied, it inevitably yields the **mouth-mouth elixir-pill’s** solar essence, hence its manifest symbolism. Yet it is mentioned in the final chapter, indicating its use at the culmination of practice.

Men have identified this **instrument** as the *Xuāntāi*, the *Lúdǐng*, the *Dāntián*, or the *Tàijí*—is it not precisely the *"round three-five, inch-one-fen, mouth-four-eight, two-inch lips, length one-zhang-two, uniform thickness"* of the *Cāntóng Qìe*? Within it lies the secret of **mouth-to-mouth** and **orifice-to-orifice**. The term *"proceed"* (*jìn*) refers to its application.

When the practice reaches the stage of using this **instrument**, all else is complete. Alas! The sacred text lies before us, the marvelous key is in the mind, creation is already manifest—why would one willingly abandon it and neglect the urgent task? Exert yourself, exert yourself!

One who grasps this says: *"This interpretation of ‘instrument’ does not harmonize with the text above and below—it is not the correct exegesis. His citation of the *Cāntóng Qìe* to define its form betrays a misguided adherence to commentators’ heresies, and must be rejected. Only when the *Hétú-Luóshū* annotates the ‘round three-five’ passage does it attain precision. If the ‘instrument’ is annotated with the *Hétú-Luóshū*, then perhaps it approaches the **Dao**."*

That which transcends form is called **Dao**; that which is within form is called **instrument**. The **instrument** is the **Dao’s** manifestation. Examining the character *"instrument"* (*qì*), one should regard it as **"Dao"** or interpret it as **"measure"** (*liáng*). All **instruments** have tangible substance, yet this **instrument** lacks substance; all **instruments** have size, yet this one has none; all **instruments** have interior and exterior, yet this one transcends them; all **instruments** have limits, yet this one is boundless. Hence it is called *"wondrous **instrument**."* It encompasses heaven and earth, shapes all things—thus it is named **"instrument."** It is the means by which heaven and earth generate, the origin from which all things emerge. Hence it is said: *"It generates all things."*

When spoken of in terms of its function, it is called **"instrument."** When spoken of in terms of its essence, it is called **"Dao"**—the **Dao of Nature**. The **Dao of Nature** is still; calendrical and astronomical systems can measure the movements of **post-heaven**, but cannot fathom the stillness of **pre-heaven**. The eight trigrams and *jiǎzǐ* cycles are all numbers within motion. What governs the eight trigrams and *jiǎzǐ* is this **wondrous instrument of supreme stillness**, possessing divine subtlety and hidden efficacy.

In **pre-heaven**, it leaves no trace to name; in the human body, it is called the *Xuānqiào*—yet even this is invisible. This entity, shared by all beings in **pre-heaven**, is the foundation of their existence and the root to which they return. It is the source of all transformations, the origin of the Sage’s work. Cultivating the body through this **instrument** harmonizes the hundred bones; governing the world through it brings order to all things.

The Sage knew that heaven and earth possess the **Dao of Nature**, which no artificial **instrument** can replicate. Thus, he took this **wondrous instrument**—the origin of all things—as the foundation to regulate the patterns of **yin-yang**, probing the root of life’s emergence, so that all transformations arise within the body. Internally, it is applied to the self; externally, to the world—both yielding divine subtlety and hidden efficacy.

**"Divine"** refers to the extension of **yang-qi**, hence *"machine."* **"Ghostly"** refers to the return of **yin-qi**, hence *"concealment."* When **yin-yang overcoming** achieves balance, all things generate from this **instrument**, though it lacks form yet manifests symbolically—this is the ultimate function of observing the **Dao of Heaven** and embodying its operations.

*Fàn* relied on private speculation to distort the Great **Dao**; yet his words are preserved here. Perhaps heretical interpretations may now cease.
