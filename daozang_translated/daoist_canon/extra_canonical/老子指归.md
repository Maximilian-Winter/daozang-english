# 老子指归

**Preface to *Laozi Zhigui***

Junping’s *Exposition on the Two Classics* states:

Zhuangzi said: In ancient times, when Laozi composed his work, the transformations arose from the Dao and virtue as their mother. The *Classic* was established at the forefront, taking heaven and earth as its model. The Upper Classic corresponds to heaven, the Lower Classic to earth. The Way of yin is eight, the Way of yang is nine. With yin as the line and yang as the column, there are thus seventy-two chapters. With yang as the line and yin as the column, the text is divided into upper and lower parts. With five as the line and eight as the column, the Upper Classic begins anew at forty. With four as the line and eight as the column, the Lower Classic concludes at thirty-two.

The Way of yang is odd, the Way of yin is even; thus, the Upper Classic comes first, and the Lower Classic follows. The Way of yang is great, the Way of yin is small; thus, the Upper Classic is abundant, and the Lower Classic is sparse. The Way of yang is left, the Way of yin is right; thus, the Upper Classic unfolds forward, while the Lower Classic turns back. Reversing and repeating, they intermingle to form a single body. In profound obscurity, the Dao presides at the center. Layered signs and ordered proofs reveal their patterns.

The Lower Classic is the gate, the Upper Classic the door. The wise, perceiving the effects of the Classic, thereby grasp the numbers of heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the pairing of husband and wife, the intimacy of father and son, the propriety of ruler and minister—whereupon the myriad things unfold.

Zhuangzi said: In ancient times, when Laozi composed his work, the transformations arose from the Dao and virtue as their mother. Taking the Classics as their model and placing them at the forefront, heaven and earth served as their images. The Upper Classic corresponds to heaven, the Lower Classic to earth. The Way of yin is eight, the Way of yang is nine; using yin to arrange yang yields seventy-two chapters. Using yang to arrange yin divides them into Upper and Lower. With five as the row and eight as the column, the Upper Classic thus has forty chapters before beginning anew. With four as the row and eight as the column, the Lower Classic thus concludes at thirty-two chapters.

The Way of yang is odd, the Way of yin is even; thus, the Upper Classic comes first and the Lower Classic follows. The Way of yang is great, the Way of yin is small; thus, the Upper Classic is abundant, and the Lower Classic is sparse. The Way of yang is left, the Way of yin is right; thus, the Upper Classic unfolds forward, while the Lower Classic turns back. Reversing and repeating, they intermingle to form a single body. In profound obscurity, the Dao presides at the center. Layered signs and ordered proofs reveal their patterns.

The Lower Classic is the gate, the Upper Classic the door. The wise, perceiving the effects of the Classic, thereby grasp the numbers of heaven and earth, the principles of yin and yang, the pairing of husband and wife, the intimacy of father and son, the propriety of ruler and minister—whereupon the myriad things unfold.

**Chapter on the Highest Virtue Not Displaying Virtue**

The highest virtue does not display virtue, and thus possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue, and thus lacks virtue.
The highest virtue acts without acting and yet nothing is left undone;
the lesser virtue acts with purpose and thus has something to show.
The highest benevolence acts without purpose;
the highest righteousness acts with purpose.
The highest propriety acts, yet if none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance.

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
when righteousness is lost, propriety follows.
Propriety is the thinning of loyalty and trust and the beginning of chaos.
Forethought is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of folly.
Therefore, the great man dwells in thickness, not in thinness;
in substance, not in ornament.
He discards the latter and takes the former.

**[Exegesis]**
The origins of heaven and earth, the principles of all things—
the Dao is their source, virtue their beginning,
spirit their essence, Great Harmony their ancestor.
The Dao has depth and subtlety; virtue has thickness and thinness;
spirit has clarity and turbidity; harmony has highness and lowness.
Clarity becomes heaven; turbidity becomes earth.
Yang becomes male; yin becomes female.
Humans and things receive these endowments in varying measure:
their natures differ in refinement, their lives in length,
their dispositions in beauty and ugliness, their intentions in greatness and smallness.
Some become petty men, some become noble men—
transforming and diverging, they are divided into countless ranks.
Thus there are Dao-men, virtue-men, benevolent men, righteous men, and propriety-men.

One may ask: *What conduct distinguishes these men, that their names and titles diverge so widely?*
Zhuangzi said:
One who embodies emptiness and non-action, opening and guiding the myriad things, is called a *Dao-man*.
One who abides in stillness and responds naturally, doing what is not done, is called a *virtue-man*.
One who loves all things universally and bestows boundlessly is called a *benevolent man*.
One who orders names and rectifies realities, handling affairs with righteousness, is called a *righteous man*.
One who yields and defers, maintaining reverence and harmony, is called a *propriety-man*.
These five types of men all delight in long life,
revere profound virtue, and prize lofty renown.
Each guards his nature and employs his intelligence,
pursuing his strengths and returning to his peace.
Yet as they rush toward things, their paths diverge—
some succeed, some fail.
Transforming in different directions, they establish myriad titles.
Virtue has its gradations; the world has its flourishing and decline.
Customs drift apart; the people’s destinies differ.
Thus some dwell in primordial vastness and nameless obscurity;
some emerge from boundless chaos and are called *August*;
some abide in boundless expanse and are called *Emperor*;
some stand in luminous vastness and are called *King*;
some extend afar in uneven measure and are called *Earl*.
These are the ones that can be spoken of.
Yet the Earl is not truly an Earl,
nor the King truly a King,
nor the Emperor truly an Emperor,
nor the August truly August—
being is not truly being,
non-being is not truly non-being.
A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations—
they cannot be reckoned,
layer upon layer, countless—
they cannot be named.

How can this be illustrated?
Those who changed their surnames and became kings,
who were enfeoffed at Mount Tai and performed the Feng and Shan sacrifices at Liangfu—
seventy-two in number—
and those whose traces and omens were faint and indistinct, beyond recognition—
they cannot be spoken of.
Is this not proof that their natures and lives differed, their merits and names unequal?

Thus, the ruler of highest virtue embodies the Dao and preserves it.
His spirit moves in harmony with transformation; his virtue stirs in the depths of mystery.
The world submits to his kingship, yet none see or hear him.
His virtue returns to the myriad things, and all call it *natural*.
The ruler of lesser virtue embodies virtue and acts accordingly.
His spirit roams with transformation; his virtue matches the August Heaven.
The world submits to his kingship, and some see or hear him.
His virtue flows to the myriad things, then returns to its lord.

Why is this so?
The ruler of highest virtue receives the Dao’s most subtle essence in his nature,
grasps the One’s most refined essence in his life.
His nature and life merge with the natural;
his emotions and intentions embody spirit and illumination.
His actions align with Great Harmony; his choices accord with Heaven’s will.
His spirit thinks no thoughts; his mind harbors no concerns.
His wisdom is profound and distant; his being is still and empty.
In movement, he is formless; in stillness, as if unborn.
His achievements are like heaven and earth; his affairs like those of an infant.
He sheds his form and conceals his will, in perfect accord with the Dao.
Vast and boundless, none in the world know him.
Flowing beyond all bounds, he soars to the farthest reaches.
Yin and yang serve as his messengers; ghosts and spirits as his advisors.
His body transforms with the Dao, ascending and descending without end.
Advancing and retreating, shifting and changing, he constantly moves with transformation.
Thus, in tranquil non-action, his virtue fills the mysterious realm;
in profound silence and stillness, his influence flows without limit.
His grace cannot be measured; his depth cannot be fathomed.
He encompasses the great domain, his blessings extending to all lands.
Knowledge cannot fathom his transformations;
words cannot guide his customs.
The world hums and murmurs, all receiving his influence and enveloped in his harmony.
Such is the *Primordial Non-Being*—
cut off from all, yet none know who acts thus.

The ruler of lesser virtue receives the Dao’s upright *qi* in his nature,
grasps the One’s middle-lower essence in his life.
His nature and life approximate the natural;
his emotions and intentions approach spirit and illumination.
His actions draw near to Great Harmony; his choices embody the highest virtue.
He entrusts his spirit to the Great Void, roots his being in the depths of mystery.
In movement, he returns to softness and weakness; in stillness, to peace and harmony.
He wears the compass and follows the square, mirroring the Great Clarity.
His transformations are indistinct and fleeting, responding to the formless.
Vague and obscure, nearly without name or title,
he aligns earth with heaven, making transformation his constant.
His virtue flourishes, his blessings overflowing in all directions.
Before his fine virtue takes shape, the world is like unknowing children.
The Four Seas are as one; vast and silent, he moves in profound stillness.
He rises and falls with the people, gazing upon things as their equal.
At this time, the Great Dao remains undivided, pure virtue unsevered.
Within the Six Directions, he alone dwells.
His tasks diminish rather than increase; his affairs are cultivated, not created.
What he does is few; what he upholds is simple.
The people are honest and loyal; the age is harmonious and cautious, still and empty.
Water and plants serve as provisions; furs and coarse cloth as fine garments.
Mighty trees become halls and temples; deep caves become dwellings.

The ruler is like Heaven and Earth, the people like grasses and trees—enveloped in the Dao, united in virtue, serene and desireless. Yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things flourish and multiply. Without decrees or commands, all within the realm submits in reverence. Fine grains and crimson grasses sprout in abundance; peonies grow in profusion. Divine dragons and phoenixes entrust themselves to humankind. Sweet dew descends without ceasing; auspicious winds stir without rest.

Without benevolence or righteousness, all within the Six Directions are in harmony, as close as kin. Without rites or ceremonies, all within the Four Seas are as brothers. Though close, they are not cloying; though reverent, not obsequious. Heaven and Earth, humans and things—all merge in primal unity.

The ruler of utmost *ren* is pure in nature, clear and luminous, radiant and all-pervading. His mind is empty and still, his spirit and *qi* harmonious and compliant. He governs Heaven and Earth, encompassing all without exception. Perceiving the subtle, he grasps the essential; from the manifest, he knows the hidden. He nurtures life and abides in virtue, loving the people as his children. He illuminates things through change, responding like echo to sound, shadow to form. He comprehends the divisions of Heaven and the principles of Earth, distinguishes the proper roles of humans and things, and opens the gate to knowledge and understanding. He initiates affairs to bring fortune, benefiting the myriad people. He records the inner and overlooks the outer, guiding with kinship. He accumulates thoughts and weighs origins, illuminating distant lands. His laws and prohibitions are balanced and mild; his proclamations are lenient and gentle. His actions are timely, and the world rejoices. Thunder does not strike violently, winds and rains do not arise abruptly. Grasses and trees do not wither; the people do not die young. Creatures that walk, crawl, or breathe all delight in life; those that fly or wriggle all find their place. The old and weak roam in groups; the strong till and weave. People have great-grandchildren; the aged retain their teeth.

The ruler is like father and mother, the people like infants. Virtue flows to the Four Seas, yet he takes nothing for himself.

The ruler of utmost *yi* is even-tempered and upright, penetrating and understanding. He examines and discerns benefit and harm, distinguishes wisdom and intelligence. His mind is like the compass and square, his will like the measuring scale. He is as calm as water, as straight as a plumb line. He delights in accomplishing great deeds, establishing grand titles. He takes joy in initiating blessings and detests being the harbinger of misfortune. He wields authority and adapts to change, gauging the times. He exalts *ren* and encourages *yi*, governing the myriad people. Following the principles of Heaven and Earth, he regulates the proper order of the myriad things. He serves his parents as if attending to the spirits; he treads among the people as if over a deep abyss. He embraces the virtues of all states, moderating them with the mean. His might is not oppressive; his harmony is not indulgent. He is stern but not cruel, discerning but not harsh. He traces beginnings to determine endings, establishing influence to guide the people. Advancing and retreating with the flow of time, bending and stretching with transformation, his affairs change with circumstances, his rites adapt to customs. His proclamations are always trustworthy; his regulations and distinctions are clear. His governance is well-ordered without laxity; his laws are just without excess. All matters are decided by his ministers, yet authority and power rest solely with the ruler. He rectifies the court with cautious Dao, manifests goodness to expose treachery. He establishes the Five Norms, inscribing them on flesh and skin. He reveres the origin and values the beginning, always aligning with names. He bends with moderation, severs with principle. Power arises and influence expands; his might shakes the realm. He sets aside his own preferences, following others to benefit the people without harshness. The slightest evil is reprimanded; the faintest good is commended. Within, he serves the royal house; without, he extends to all beings. He responds to decay with change, reviving what is lost and restoring what is severed. He uplifts the weak and nurtures the young; *ren* and virtue flourish anew. Those with lands pass them to their heirs; descendants continue unbroken.

The ruler of utmost *li* is gentle in nature and tender in disposition, his mind open yet his will desirous. His undertakings align with yin and yang; his proclamations follow the four seasons. His governance adapts to a hundred changes, ensnaring the hearts of the people. He exalts the ruler and father, humbles the minister and child. He rectifies high and low, clarifies distinctions, orders elders and juniors, separates husband and wife, harmonizes human relationships, and follows the bonds of friendship. He returns to the proper order, ensuring affairs have graded ranks. Those who comply are rewarded; the unruly are demoted or punished. He indulges the strong and unyielding, enveloping customs, guiding with the middle way. He follows desires to harmonize them, restrains emotions and curbs nature, fortifying against what has not yet sprouted. He binds the world and restrains customs, preventing excess. He severs what others cannot sever, compels what others cannot do—exhausting spirit and injuring nature, multiplying affairs and wasting resources. Chaos is thus brought to order, peril to peace. Knowledge and cunning prevail; sincerity and simplicity vanish. The Great Dao is extinguished; *ren* and virtue do not flourish. Heaven’s intent is not fulfilled; the four seasons lose their regularity. Thunder and lightning destroy; the myriad things are cut short. Parents and children suffer loss, yet Heaven does not harmonize for them. Day and night grow bleak, yet the world does not transform. Bells and chimes resound, yet customs do not change. Solemn tones linger, yet the wind does not shift. Humility and deference are not trusted; yielding and submission are not embraced. Titles and rewards are offered, yet the worthy do not descend. Arms are raised and jade tablets brandished, yet the noble do not come. Why is this? Because fine words and fair appearances lack true sincerity.

Thus, the root of emperors and kings lies in the Dao as the primordial beginning. When the Dao is lost, virtue follows; when virtue is lost, *ren* follows; when *ren* is lost, *yi* follows; when *yi* is lost, *li* follows; when *li* is lost, chaos follows. These five are all aspects of the Dao, yet rulers throughout the ages have excelled or faltered in them. What they do is not what they desire; what they seek is not what they attain. They neglect the natural and pursue the trivial and superficial.

As for *li* as a practice: inner and outer conflict, splendor flourishes while substance decays, the branch is exalted while the root withers. *Li* is thinner than loyalty, authority lighter than might, trust does not reach *yi*, attainment does not match *ren*. It is the dregs of governance, the source of chaos—the wellspring of deceit and pretense, the cause of resentment and strife. Thus, establishing rites and creating music, altering standards and changing attire, regulating conduct and setting norms, ensuring actions have constant measures, foreseeing future affairs to clarify success and failure—these are the flowers of the Dao and the dregs of virtue, the laws of a single time, the techniques of a single corner.

Such practices are not suited to enduring through boundless ages or harmonizing with the customs of distant lands. Thus, they become the source from which calamities and chaos arise, the wellspring from which folly and delusion take form.

How can this be illustrated? Zhuangzi says: The responses of Heaven and Earth follow from events, and events respond to change, yet change has no fixed time. Therefore, affairs cannot be predetermined, nor can change be foreseen—just as pain cannot be soothed before it arises, nor itching scratched before it begins. The five flavors cannot be blended by measuring cups, nor can the zither and lute be tuned by fixed lengths.

Thus, the subtlest of the subtle is beyond words, and the most wondrous of the wondrous is beyond transmission. The utmost in loyalty and trust cannot be adorned by *li*, and the harmony of timing—whether early or late—cannot be preserved by calculation. Even if one’s wisdom is vast and far-reaching, one’s thoughts swift and discerning, perceiving the warp of yin and grasping the weft of yang, understanding the ways of ghosts and spirits, and comprehending the principles of the myriad things—gazing upward to see the patterns of Heaven and downward to see the patterns of Earth, ceaselessly instructing the people and tirelessly attending to affairs—such efforts to bring about peace have never been heard of.

Consider how the myriad things entrust themselves to the ruler: it is like the numinous spirit dwelling in the body or well-water residing in the courtyard. Water cannot be made clear through effort, nor can the spirit be stilled through thought. Between Heaven and Earth, the myriad things arise together—none can be made level through intervention.

Therefore, the great man’s way of transformation embodies the Dao and embraces virtue, merging with the vast emptiness and penetrating all things. Perfect yet seeming incomplete, possessing yet appearing absent. In stillness, it has no form; in motion, it makes no sound. Loyalty and trust are deep and sincere, yet he does not regard them as foremost. Profound and obscure, dark and unadorned, simplicity takes precedence. He diminishes the heart and discards intention, eschewing displays of authority. Without striving or acting, he moves like a dragon or a serpent. Rejecting *li* and abandoning *yi*, he returns to non-action, responding to the times and adapting to change without premeditation. Grasping the subtle and mastering the essential, he moves with the times, his choices and retreats, extensions and withdrawals, existing in accord with change. Calamities, chaos, suffering, and fault are sought within oneself; the hundred blessings and ten thousand fortunes arise without dependence on others.

Those who attained the One in ancient times:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
the spirits attained the One and became numinous;
the valleys attained the One and became full;
the lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under Heaven.

Yet if they push these to their extremes:
Heaven, without clarity, would fear splitting;
Earth, without tranquility, would fear erupting;
the spirits, without numinosity, would fear fading;
the valleys, without fullness, would fear drying up;
the lords and kings, without being the standard and exalting themselves, would fear collapse.

Thus, the noble takes the humble as its root, and the high takes the low as its foundation. The lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy"—is this not taking the humble as their root? Is it not so?

Thus, one constructs a carriage from what is not yet a carriage.

Do not desire to clatter like jade or clatter like stone.

The returning is the movement of the Dao;
the weak is the function of the Dao.
The things of Heaven and Earth are born from Being,
and Being is born from Non-Being.

[Annotation of *Zhigui*]:
The One is the child of the Dao, the mother of spirit and luminosity, the ancestor of Great Harmony, the progenitor of Heaven and Earth.
To the spirits, it is Non-Being; to the Dao, it is Being.
To the spirits, it is vast; to the Dao, it is small.
Thus, as a thing, it is empty yet full, Non-Being yet Being.
Round yet not compass-drawn, square yet not carpenter-ruled,
boundless and indistinct, without beginning or thread,
neither floating nor sinking, neither moving nor still,
acting through non-action, bestowing through non-bestowal,
encompassing transformations, bearing and unfolding all principles.
The Non-Being of Non-Being, the Beginning of beginnings,
without outside or inside, chaotic and undifferentiated,
vast and boundless, drifting and drifting,
it may turn left or right.
Non-Being is its constant; clarity and stillness its master.
It penetrates the ten thousand heavens, flows through the hundred million wilds.
The ten thousand things arise thus, without form or sign,
existing alone in profound mystery, dwelling alone in dark wonder.
Perfectly seamless, unchanging in its simplicity,
it merges with the vastness of Heaven, containing all things.
It shapes spirit and luminosity yet does not share their nature;
it creates and transforms Heaven and Earth yet does not dwell with them.
It endows yet does not diminish, gathers yet does not accumulate,
neither crooked nor straight, neither first nor last.
Boundless in height and greatness, unfathomable in depth and subtlety,
it cannot be concealed or discussed above or below,
nor can its lateral flow be measured.
Vast and expansive, luminous and bright,
it generates yet does not change with generation,
transforms yet does not arise with transformation.
It does not generate, yet things generate themselves;
it does not act, yet things complete themselves.
Beyond Heaven and Earth, within the finest hair’s breadth,
endowed with qi differently, assuming distinct forms and kinds,
all receive the One’s singular generation,
all attain the One’s transformation to completion.
Thus, the One is the guide of the ten thousand things and the essence of all change,
the plumb line of the ten thousand directions and the measure of all transformations.

The One is its name;
Virtue is its title;
Non-Being and Being are its abode;
non-action is its affair;
formlessness is its measure;
returning is its great reckoning;
harmony is its return;
weakness is its function.

Thus, one who knows the One is inexhaustible in a thousand changes,
unerring in ten thousand calculations.
One who does not know the One meets fortune and misfortune by turns;
those who govern states perish, and those who guard their persons are lost.

Therefore, those of old who attained the One:
Heaven’s nature attained the One’s clarity,
yet Heaven’s actions were not clarity.
Without mind or intent, without action or affair,
it followed its nature.
Profoundly still, without form or model,
it preserved its mandate.
Thus, yin and yang arose of themselves, and transformations righted themselves.
Therefore, it could be firm and vigorous in motion to reach its height,
pure, bright, and vast, luminous and harmonious,
pure and true, flourishing without admixture.
Vast and unchanging, resolute and radiant,
the ten thousand things rely on it for their beginning.
Clouds rise and rain falls, forms flow into kinds,
the origin of natures and mandates,
profound and boundless, covering all without exception.

Earth’s nature attained the One’s tranquility,
yet Earth’s actions were not tranquility.
Without knowledge or perception, without action or affair,
it followed its nature.
Without measure or number, without love or benefit,
it preserved its mandate.
Thus, mountains and rivers arose of themselves, and hardness and softness righted themselves.
Therefore, it could be faithful and yielding, soft and weak,
straight and square, harmonious and upright,
vast and boundless, deep and thick, clear and still.
The ten thousand things rely on it for their birth, and none are not borne and sustained.

The spirits’ nature attained the One’s numinosity,
yet the spirits’ actions were not numinosity.
Without thought or deliberation, without action or affair,
they followed their nature.
Without calculation or strategy, without direction or head,
they preserved their mandate.
Thus, growth and decline arose of themselves, and existence and extinction righted themselves.
Therefore, the old could regain youth, the dead could revive,
the distressed could prosper, the ruined could flourish.
Transformations knew no limit, reversals no end;
all things relied on them without losing their center.

The valleys’ nature attained the One’s fullness,
yet the valleys’ actions were not fullness.
Without desire or seeking, without action or affair,
they followed their nature.
Without benevolence or righteousness, without giving or bestowing,
they preserved their mandate.
Thus, emptiness and fullness arose of themselves, and flourishing and decline righted themselves.
Therefore, they could steam mountains and flow through marshes, becoming a thoroughfare of virtue.
Trickling without cease, continuous without end,
luminous and vast, long and boundless,
they filled rivers and seas, deep and great, unfathomable.

The lords and kings’ nature attained the One’s rectitude,
yet the lords and kings’ actions were not rectitude.
Abandoning mind and will, without action or affair,
they followed their nature.
Abandoning hearing and sight, responding through emptiness,
they preserved their mandate.
Thus, peace and harmony arose of themselves, and the ten thousand things righted themselves.
Therefore, they could embody the Dao and accord with virtue, following Heaven’s standard.
Embracing spirit and treading harmony, enveloping the ten thousand things,
their voices flew and transformed things, filling the six directions.
They guided Heaven and Earth, illuminated sun and moon,
governed the age and steered customs, unifying all within the world.

These five attained the One and practiced it,
abiding without decay, completing without lack,
flowing without cessation, shining without extinction.
Why was this so?
Their natures and mandates were spontaneous, their movements derived from the One.

Thus, if Heaven were to act and move not in accord with the One,
the high would become low, and the clear would split.
Yin and yang would be perverse and disorderly, the warp and weft of the net would break.
Harmonious qi would be blocked and obstructed, the Three Luminaries would fade and vanish.
Thunder and lightning would act recklessly, and the ten thousand things would all be lost.

If Earth were to act and move not in accord with the One,
the straight would become crooked, and the tranquil would erupt.
Mountains and rivers would collapse and break, hardness and softness would bend and snap.
Qi transformations would not circulate, the Five Phases would be destroyed and deficient.
The hundred valleys would wither, and the multitudes would suffer plague.

If spirits were to act and move not in accord with the One,
the penetrating would become obstructed, and the numinous would cease.
Transformations would lose their order, and congealings would dissolve and vanish.
That which flourishes and declines would perish, and that which tightens and loosens would die.

If valleys were to act and move not in accord with the One,
the existent would become nonexistent, and the full would become empty.
Vacuity and repletion would reverse, and flowing blessings would not enter.

If lords and kings were to act and move not in accord with the One,
the noble would become base, and the upright would stumble.
Chaos and confusion would arise, and matters would proceed from their own will.
The hundred officials would lose their center, forfeiting name and reality.
The myriad people would not return, and Heaven and Earth would be severed.

These five, in their natures and destinies, are pure and fine,
their transformations exhaustively extreme,
their advances and retreats, extensions and contractions,
never departing from the model and standard.
Abiding in the One, they endure; losing the One, they perish.
How much more so for those who are not sages yet rule the myriad people,
who discard the model and standard and follow their own hearts!

Thus, the Dao of Heaven and humanity,
the transformations of things and kinds—
the few become many, the base become noble,
the high become low, the accomplished become ruined.
That which is augmented is diminished, that which is benefited is harmed.
Dwelling in their opposites, they obtain their overturnings;
pursuing what they seek, they lose what they desire.

Therefore, worthy rulers and sage lords,
whose power is above the people,
whose ranks are honored throughout the world,
whose blessings extend to the myriad things,
whose virtue embraces the four seas—
those aided by the Dao,
assisted by Heaven and Earth,
to whom the myriad things return,
with whom ghosts and spirits unite.
They discipline themselves and rise in integrity,
calling themselves "orphaned and few,"
dwelling in lowliness and guarding the minute,
personally enduring toil and hardship,
diminishing their hearts and subduing their wills,
devoting themselves to placing themselves below the people.
Not acting as noble, they thus command the people’s destinies;
not acting as high, they thus remain above the people;
not desiring, they thus lack nothing;
not acting, they thus govern all.
The myriad things swirl in confusion,
yet they themselves have no part in it,
and thus become their root.

This is not only true of the kingly Way—all matters are so.
When a craftsman builds a carriage,
whether round or square, short or long,
curved or straight, vertical or horizontal,
he may labor his whole life in vain,
never completing the carriage,
yet by so doing, he completes the carriage and makes it usable.

Jade, as a thing, is subtle and few;
stone, as a thing, is vast and many.
Many, thus base; few, thus noble.
Jade and stone, though born of the same kind,
few and many—some are sought, some are discarded.
Thus, nobility and baseness lie in quantity,
success and failure lie in action or inaction.

Therefore, the sage
acts through reversal,
abides in harmony,
moves and yields with the times,
transforms with things.
Not acting as stone, not acting as jade,
he constantly dwells between jade and stone.
Neither many nor few, neither noble nor base,
the One as his guiding principle,
the Dao as his pillar.
Thus, he exclusively governs the world with unassailable might,
preserves and enlivens the myriad things with immeasurable virtue.
Noble yet without care, base yet without trouble,
high yet without peril, low yet ever secure.
Discerning in reversal and recurrence,
returning to profound silence,
lucid in being and nonbeing,
reverting to the Great Beginning.
Not making himself his concern, his spirit and clarity are not released;
not making the world his concern, the world accompanies him as one.
Why is this so?
He moves in accord with the Dao, follows the One in action.
The supreme reckoning of the Dao,
the great square of the One—
transformations proceed from reversal,
harmony in the minute is constant,
arising from negation, existing in annihilation.

Heaven and Earth are born of Supreme Harmony,
Supreme Harmony is born of emptiness and obscurity.

The editions of *Jindai* and *Xuejin* read "neither inner nor outer." The *Zhouyi Qian* hexagram’s *Tuan* commentary reads "the myriad things flow into form." *Zhigui* cites the *Zhouyi* here. The editions of *Jindai* and *Xuejin* read "之." The editions of *Jindai* and *Xuejin* read "当," which appears to be an error.

**The Superior Person Hears the Dao**
When the superior person hears the Dao, they diligently practice it. When the middling person hears the Dao, they hold it as if it exists and as if it does not. When the inferior person hears the Dao, they laugh loudly at it. If they did not laugh, it would not suffice to be the Dao. Thus, established sayings declare:
The luminous Dao seems dim,
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat,
The level Dao seems uneven.
Supreme virtue resembles a valley,
Great purity seems tarnished,
Vast virtue seems insufficient,
Established virtue seems remiss,
True essence seems mutable,
The great square has no corners,
The great vessel is late in completion,
The great tone is scarce of sound,
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden, without name.
Only the Dao is good at bestowing and accomplishing.

**Exegesis:**
The virtue of Dao and the power of Heaven and Earth each have their manifestations. Things have high and low, qi has short and long. Each labors in what they delight, suffers in what they dread, sees what they see, hears what they hear, their choices and abandonments perverse and tangled, their fears and joys divergent. Thus, the quail and sparrow fly high, racing all day, yet their aspirations lie in the millet; the swan and crane soar aloft, traversing east and west, spanning thousands and tens of thousands, yet their aspirations lie in the marsh; the phoenix and luan soar above the ten-thousand-*ren* heights, roaming the Supreme Clarity, yet deem it base. Stretching their necks and spreading their wings, they rise through the azure clouds, brush the sun and moon, soar high and far, fasting for long stretches, journeying across the Nine Provinces, nesting in the Eight Directions—only then do they find what suits them. These three differ in their conveniences, yet all find joy in them. Thus, the boundless spring, the thousand-*xun* deep spring, are where the divine dragon returns, and where small fish depart. Towering mountains and great hills, deep forests and vast ravines, luxuriant trees with flourishing branches, are where the great birds and tigers delight, yet where chickens and dogs abhor. Alas!

The remnant customs of the Three Dynasties, the literary currents of the Ru and Mo, reciting the *Odes* and *Documents*, cultivating rites and decorum, chanting the *Ya* and *Song*, strumming the zither, exalting benevolence and righteousness, venerating purity and integrity, tracing back to antiquity, mastering numerology and arts, determining right and wrong, weighing gains and losses, seeking bodily ease and reputed glory, transmitting their learning among their villages—these are the paths of the middling person, what the superior person discards. Dwelling in seclusion and deep thought, forcing memorization of the myriad things, fabricating falsehoods to adorn wrongs, uttering empty words about names and realities, strutting and advancing, ascending and descending, gathering and dispersing, regulating the rites of the inner chambers, aligning with the customs of the times, swaying and bowing, striving to conform to the age, flattering the rich and powerful, pandering to the masses’ perceptions, gaining esteem and favor, following the vulgar as their model—these are the steps of the inferior person, what the middling person abandons.

Thus, compass and square do not harm each other; divergent natures, who can make them harmonious? The worthy and sage do not pair; the foolish and wise do not flock together. The great person delights in tranquility; the petty person rejoices in anxiety. The grand enterprise is not understood by the common folk; the restless affairs do not please the true gentleman. Birds and beasts flourish together, each with their own inclinations. Scholars of the age each have their own destinations. Therefore, discard cleverness and wisdom, cast aside cunning and thought, return to true simplicity. Roam in primordial simplicity, hold things lightly, scorn the world, stand aloof and unstained. Joy and anger do not touch the heart; profit and harm do not reach the mind. Noble and base share the same realm; existence and annihilation are as one. Act through non-action, contemplate the mysterious and wondrous, keep the spirit serene and still, leaving no trace, embrace virtue and contain harmony, naturally reverting to transformation—these are what the great sage esteems, what the superior person pursues, what the middling person finds dazzling, and what the inferior person laughs at.

Thus, what the middling person hears is not the ultimate beauty; what the inferior person sees is not the ultimate goodness. What the middling person finds dazzling, what the inferior person laughs at—these are the most beautiful and good. To expound grand words, unfold ultimate discourse, manifest the natural, exhaust the subtle and wondrous—this dazzles the middling person and makes the inferior person laugh. To float words and wander in persuasion, generate and cease in endless change, initiate fortune and stir benefit, achieve success and complete affairs—this the middling person discusses and the inferior person awakens to. They do not prefer misfortune and detest fortune, value calamity and despise blessing. Their natures are distant from it; their emotions are contrary to it. It is as if dwelling in the Yellow Springs while listening and gazing at the Nine Heavens—so remote and utterly cut off that they cannot see or hear. Thus, the sage establishes the saying "there is." "There is" speaks of the Dao’s difficulty in being known. Only those who trace the handle of the natural’s return, unifying the ten thousand directions’ intent, can possess it—it is not what the mediocre can hear.

Why is this so? The sage’s Dao is profound, subtle, vast, and distant, towering and fleeting, dark yet luminous. Empty and still, drifting and silent, the myriad things pass through it. Minute and vast, it has no form or image. To exhaust and fathom it, even knowledge cannot grasp it; to condense and summarize it, even the mouth cannot speak it; to extend and disperse it, even writing cannot transmit it. Why? Advancing in the Dao seems like retreat; losing the Dao seems like possessing it. To govern the world, return and revert to oneself. Stillness is the door of emptiness; emptiness is the gate of the Dao. Tranquility is the root of spirit; silence is the root of harmony. Frugality is the vessel of qi; subtlety is the achievement of affairs. Dwelling in the after of non-being, existing in the before of being, abandoning and discarding the world, prioritizing one’s own self, nurturing the spirit and accumulating harmony to govern the heart. The heart is the master of the self; the self is the heart of the state. The world responds to it as if by natural disposition. Thus, the level Dao seems uneven, yet it makes the upright and mysterious arise. Remove its regulations and things, discard its divisions and principles.

Following the people’s hearts, heed what they possess, abolish their adornments, and level their obstacles. Break the barriers and shatter the bolts, that villainy may cease of itself; dismantle the walls and scatter the prisons, that the people may guard themselves. Disband the troops and lay down the weapons, to make a marketplace of the world—all directions flow toward it as rivers to the sea.

Virtue is like a valley: neither bestowing nor withholding, neither cherishing nor profiting, neither abiding nor departing. Through non-action, grace flows; without benevolence, blessings deepen. It nurtures all life, becoming the mother of the world. Pure white and verdant green, ever as though startled and fearful, it rises in power without control, gains weight in authority without reliance. Virtue intermingles with creation, becoming the world’s companion.

Emerging white, entering black, it seeks no beauty or goodness; pursuing merit and fleeing fame, it alone remains luminous. The person of abundant virtue, earnest and unassuming, seems ever insufficient, formless and featureless. Simplifying emotions and easing nature, they transform into a childlike simplicity—without action, without affairs, as if foolish, as if deaf. The body dwells in unity, the spirit illuminates a thousandfold. Transformations remain unseen, joys and desires unheard, as if closed, as if blocked, existing alone with the Dao.

Establishing virtue seems furtive, yet nothing is left unaccomplished. It obscures the people’s ears and eyes, adorns their spirits and minds. It severs the people’s desires to enrich their nature, extinguishes their pleasures to prolong their lives. It discards their adornments, leaving them without distraction; seals their hearts and intentions, granting them peace and tranquility. Unadorned and true as though dyed, it becomes the people’s profound model.

It gives life through the Dao, nourishes through virtue, guides with spirit, and harmonizes with principle. It dwells within heaven and earth, illumined by sun and moon, transformed by yin and yang, sustained by water and grain. It is governed by the formless, bound to the infinite. The world turns toward it in unison, none failing to submit; all under heaven enjoys peace, and the ten thousand things flourish.

Though not its achievement, though not its virtue, greatness seems small, purity seems thin. The greatest square has no corners, yet nothing is left unencompassed. Squaring the unsquared, straightening the unstraightened, without boundaries or edges, without laws or models—neither square nor straight, the ten thousand things attain their own. Neither straight nor square, heaven and earth proceed of themselves.

In action, it is yin; in stillness, yang. Harmony is the central master, and principles clarify themselves. United with heaven as one, constant with earth, thus the great vessel is late in completion, yet nothing is left unpossessed. It transforms without form, changes without trace, moves without sound, acts without substance. Its majesty and virtue are unseen, its achievements unobservable. Disasters vanish in obscurity, blessings arise from the profound. Silent and still, this is called supreme skill. The ten thousand things are born from it, yet none know how. Striving to completion, it endures long.

Thus, the greatest sound is soundless, instruction comes without speech. Speaking through silence, spirit and illumination transmit. Motionless and silent, the world attains great passage. Without sound, the ten thousand things are stirred; without tone, the ten thousand things resound. Heaven and earth, humanity and things, without appointment, harmonize as echo answers sound.

The great image is formless, the great form shapeless. Advancing, the ten thousand things are preserved; retreating, the ten thousand things perish—heaven and earth move with it in unison, yin and yang bend and stretch with it. Imitating and reflecting it, like shadow following form.

This is knowing the Dao’s abundance bears no name, virtue’s fullness bears no title. Merit soars without measure, yet the world does not deem it great; virtue pervades the four seas, yet the world does not deem it noble. Radiance illuminates the six directions, yet returns to obscurity. What is the reason for this?

The Dao’s transformation begins in nonbeing and ends in the ephemeral, abides in what does not abide, and lends to what does not borrow. In movement, the ten thousand things take form; in stillness, the world reaches fulfillment.

---

The *Dao* gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things bear yin and embrace yang,
blending their qi to achieve harmony.

What people despise are “orphan,” “widower,” and “unworthy,” yet kings and lords take these as their titles. Thus, what is diminished may be augmented, and what is augmented may be diminished—what others teach, I also teach. “The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death”—I take this as the father of all teachings.

**Exegesis:**
The emptiness of emptiness opens and bestows; what is not so cannot make itself so.
The emptiness within shapes and transforms; what begins life cannot itself give life.
The nonbeing of nonbeing cannot be altered by spirit and illumination; what sustains existence cannot itself sustain.
The nonbeing within is subtle and mysterious; what brings completion cannot itself complete.

Thus, the emptiness of emptiness gives birth to emptiness, the nonbeing of nonbeing gives birth to nonbeing, and nonbeing gives birth to the formed. Therefore, all that has form belongs to the category of things. Things have their origins, categories have their ancestors. Heaven and earth are the greatest of things, with humanity next. The arising of heaven and humanity depends on form, which depends on qi, which depends on harmony, which depends on spirit and illumination, which depend on virtue and the Dao, which depend on the natural—thus do the ten thousand things endure.

What makes heaven heaven is not heaven itself; what makes humanity human is not humanity itself. How can this be understood? Zhuangzi said: When a person’s body is but a rotting corpse, what is there to claim? When perception and response arise, what is gained? When transformation begins and ends, who is the master? From this, it is clear: being arises from nonbeing, substance from emptiness.

Therefore, the nonbeing of nonbeing has no beginning and cannot be grasped; it is formless and soundless, cannot be seen or heard. It bestows being upon nonbeing yet cannot be spoken of; the nonbeing of the nonbeing of nonbeing is the beginning before the beginning, the origin of the ten thousand things, the source of nature and destiny—what has no name is called the Dao.

The Dao is the emptiness of emptiness, thus it can give birth to the One. A thing emerges in chaos, indistinct and faint. Light yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling, yang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior. Without above or below, without left or right, it pervades without boundary, serving as the Dao’s guiding principle. It embraces the void, envelops the not-yet-existent, formless and nameless, vast and boundless, chaotic and obscure, dark and unfathomable. Beyond sound and color, nothing compares. Point to it and there is no direction; grasp it and there is nothing. Vast and inexhaustible, it cannot be explained. Vast and undifferentiated, without end or beginning, the dwelling of the ten thousand things, the first of the great beginning—thus it is called the One.

The One, being empty, can give birth to the Two. Two things arise together, subtle and refined, generating and sustaining. Adapting to things, they transform without fixed form, flourishing without decline, their radiance illuminating the dark. Without direction or abode, they envelop heaven and earth, yet their origin cannot be seen. They cannot be pursued by sound nor escaped by form—these are called spirit and illumination. When they abide, things abide; when they depart, things perish. Neither wisdom nor force can reach them, nor can power or virtue move them—thus they are called the Two.

The Two, being the nonbeing of nonbeing, can give birth to the Three. Three things arise as one, vast and indistinct. Look and their form cannot be seen; listen and their sound cannot be heard; grasp and their thread cannot be found; gaze and their gate cannot be glimpsed. They cannot be measured or fathomed, dark and profound, vast and boundless. One clear, one turbid, they move with harmony. The beginning of heaven and humanity, before any sign of form, rooted in the One, receiving their mandate from spirit—these are called the Three.

The Three, being nonbeing, can give birth to the ten thousand things. Clear and turbid divide, high and low are arrayed, yin and yang begin to separate, harmonious qi flows. The three luminaries revolve, the myriad kinds arise. Some have form and can be followed, some have sound and color and can be seen and heard—these are called the ten thousand things. In their arising, all originate from emptiness and begin in nonbeing. Turning from yin toward yang, embracing softness and forsaking hardness, still and unmoving, the mind and will at rest—thus do form and appearance flourish, nature and destiny flow freely, for they contain harmony and softness, and the Dao is without form.

Therefore, emptiness, nonbeing, formlessness, subtlety, scarcity, and softness are the means by which heaven and earth arise and the ten thousand things are born. What the multitude despise, kings and lords use to name themselves. They are the source of the ten thousand things, the root of all accomplishment. Thus, worthy rulers and sage sovereigns, though they hold the highest position and greatest power, dwell in orphanhood and unworthiness, pursue what they seek, flee what they desire, diminish the great to make it small, and find peace in lowliness and joy in reduction. They leave without trace, enter without sign, move ahead of fortune, and rest at the beginning of misfortune. Without action or affair, the world orders itself. Without seeing or hearing, they embrace harmony and stillness. Spirit and illumination flourish, form and appearance naturally align. Advancing and retreating follow constant principles, never altering their course.

Virtue’s transformation surpasses the wind, its principle pervades the multitudes. Heaven and earth protect it, the ten thousand things return to it. The multitude, however, are not so—they perceive and know only illness. Perceiving and knowing only illness, they conform to accomplished affairs, yet fail to see the changes not yet manifest; thus they prize firmness and hardness. Wielding great power to create momentum, they cannot govern the myriad tasks. Profound depth and softness, distant separation from the subtle and few—when they act, they contravene the Dao; when still, they oppose heaven. Spirit and illumination grow turbid, the multitude of affairs arise together. Thoughts and deliberations fall into confusion, joy and anger arise recklessly. Blessings depart through the gate, omens and calamities enter the door. Heaven’s net is cast wide—there is no escape. Suddenly, disaster arises; in sorrow, they awaken. Humbled and constrained, they speak humbly; on the verge of death, they offer fine words. Though they wish to reform their errors and renew themselves, returning to the subtle and few, nature does not release them. They drift far from the path of life, bringing ruin to states and destruction to families, with misfortune extending to their descendants.

Thus, the teaching of the multitude transforms foolishness into wisdom, weakness into strength, departs from the subtle to embrace the manifest, turns concealment into prominence, and pursues violent favor and contention, dying for the sake of glory and fame. The teaching of the sage reverses this: foolishness becomes wisdom, disgrace becomes honor, the subtle becomes manifest, concealment becomes prominence, the few become many, and weakness becomes strength. Abandoning the heart and releasing intention, they devote themselves to namelessness, to knowing nothing and recognizing nothing, returning to the profound and obscure. Different paths lead to different ends—some preserve, some perish.

Thus, mighty Qin and great Chu, in their tyrannical rule, met destruction; the divine Han, rising like a dragon, flourished through harmony and compliance. Therefore, the strong depart from the Dao, the rigid lose their spirit. Those who govern life through retreat—how can they endure long? Not seeking within themselves, they resent fate and blame heaven. The sage pities them and makes this the first lesson. Inscribed on bamboo and silk, it is clearly shown to later generations. Yet for all time, they turn away—thus they suffer its misfortunes.

The preceding text speaks of "that which has emptiness," and here it should read: "The emptiness of emptiness gives rise to emptiness." ⑵ The character "無" is superfluous. The preceding text speaks of "that which has non-being," and below it states, "Non-being gives rise to that which has form," so here it should read: "The non-being of non-being gives rise to non-being." ⑶ The *Jindai* and *Xuejin* editions read, "Now, heaven’s generation of humanity," which is incorrect. ⑷ "腐" should be "脔," a graphic error. The following text states, "That which has form and can be followed as segmented parts, that which has sound and color and can be seen and heard, is called the myriad things," which confirms this. ⑸ The *Yilan* edition reads "無." ⑹ According to the *Yilan*, *Jindai*, and *Xuejin* editions, emended. ⑺ The *Jindai* edition reads "回," which is incorrect. ⑻ The *Jindai* and *Xuejin* editions read "来," which is incorrect. ⑼ The *Jindai* and *Xuejin* editions read "纲." ⑽ The *Jindai* and *Xuejin* editions read, "Fool the wise with wisdom, shame the honored with glory, obscure the manifest with subtlety, reveal the hidden with clarity, diminish the many with fewness, strengthen the weak with weakness."

**The Utmost Softness**

The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Non-being enters where there is no gap—thus I know the benefit of non-action.
The teaching without words, the benefit of non-action—few under heaven attain them.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao is most numinous, and spirit-brightness attends it as a guest;
spirit-brightness is most formless, and Great Harmony serves it as a minister.
Clear and turbid, Great Harmony, utmost softness without form—
it enfolds heaven and earth, contains and cradles yin and yang,
governs the myriad things, and maintains all their guiding principles.
Some lie beyond the cosmos, some dwell within the heavens—
all beings borrow it to live, yet none perceive or hear it.
It is too fine to be named, too weak to be designated;
the sage preserves it in mind as a thing.

Thus it is called "utmost softness" and named "formless."
Therefore, the formless thing does not harden the hard or strengthen the strong;
thus it can wear down heaven and earth, dissolve bronze and iron,
race like the wind, gallop like lightning,
traverse the extremes of sun and moon,
circulate above and below,
outpace the swift and fleeting,
rest securely in flight,
and merge into nothingness.

How to demonstrate this?
A sound without voice cannot be exhausted,
a shadow without form cannot be fathomed,
water, through its yielding softness, penetrates metal and stone and sinks the myriad things,
earth, through its gentle compliance, accomplishes great works and overcomes plants and trees.
The tongue and ears suffer no harm, while horns and teeth break and shatter.
From this we see: the soft overcomes the hard, the empty outstrips the solid—
this is not the work of action but the nature of things.

Thus, when land is narrow and people few, arms scant and food scarce,
intentions subtle and desires faint, spirit-brightness is preserved.
In harmony with heaven, viewing all things as children,
virtue flourishes and transformation thrives, kindness runs deep and favor flows thick.
Officials are loyal, soldiers faithful; the lord worries, the general fears.
Accumulating softness, amassing weakness, they remain behind the people,
bearing shame and enduring humiliation, their state in a submissive position.
The feudal lords trust them as they would an infant;
all under heaven turn to them as to parents.
People and beings share the same desire, and majestic power arises of itself—
the strong cannot oppress them, the great cannot seize them.
From beginning to end, through cycles of reversal,
strength and weakness transform—
heaven and earth assist them, spirit-brightness aids them.
When the time comes, they cannot be controlled and become lords of all under heaven.

Why is this so?
Because they embody the Dao’s softness and weakness, its subtlety and fewness.

Thus, when land is vast and people numerous, the state rich and arms strong,
officials brave and soldiers fierce, the lord capable and the general stern,
rewards heavy and punishments severe, cutting straight and carving deep—
all officials tremble as if standing before the ruler.
With advantageous terrain and strategic position, they become lords of the seas within,
lightly regarding the enemy, delighting in war, easily mobilizing troops.
Combining changes to create wonders, defying heaven and humiliating earth,
the feudal lords submit in servitude, none daring to hold their lives in their own hands.
Their might shakes lands beyond their borders, and they are ever fierce and outstanding.
People worry, beings fear, their power moves heaven and earth.
Yet the Dao does not sustain them, spirit-brightness departs,
the weak unite in heart, the myriad people do not follow—
their persons die, their states perish, their clans scatter.

Why is this so?
Because they embody hardness and rigidity, accumulating arrogance and stinginess.

Now, the Dao ⑴, through the being of non-being,
passes through where there is no gap, roams where there is no principle,
illuminates the chamber of action, clarifies the treasury of non-action,
enters and exits without bounds, traverses pearls and jade without trace.

How to demonstrate this?
A sharp sickle cannot enter where there is no principle;
yet spirit-brightness, dwelling in the body, exits where there is no gap and enters where there is no opening,
covering a thousand miles in the space between a bow and a rise.

From this we see: action’s deeds are abandoned and fruitless;
non-action’s deeds are accomplished and boundless—
they create heaven and earth and give rise to people and beings.

A sound with voice is heard a hundred miles away;
a sound without voice moves beyond the heavens and shakes the four seas.
Words that are spoken cannot communicate across different kinds;
words that are not spoken transform yin and yang and move heaven and earth.

Moreover, the Dao through non-action completes heaven and earth,
and heaven and earth through non-speech set the four seasons in motion.
These two are the tally of spirit and people, the proof of nature.
Thus the sage
empties the heart to fathom the Dao,
calms the qi to preserve spirit-brightness,
diminishes hearing to listen to the soundless,
abandons sight to see the formless.
Observing the changes and movements of heaven and earth,
(contemplating) ⑵ the spontaneity of the myriad things,
he perceives that action is the root of disorder,
non-action the origin of order,
speech the door of misfortune,
and silence the gate of blessing.

Therefore, he cuts off sageliness and discards wisdom,
eliminates benevolence and abandons righteousness,
awakens the heart of the Dao, and raises the intent of virtue.
Following spirit and nurturing harmony, he entrusts heaven and serves earth.
Yin and yang fulfill their duties, the four seasons gallop forth;
the roots of disorder are severed, and things rest in their places.
The lord of the age is serene and indifferent, the myriad people are without trouble.
He teaches with the speech of non-speech, transforms with the transformation of non-transformation,
reveals the image of no-image, and returns to the profound and wondrous.

Silencing human passions and desires,
he accords with their nature and destiny,
rendering the people without cunning,
that they may attain long life and enduring vision.

Thus, I speak not, yet heaven and earth act not;
heaven and earth act not, and the Dao and virtue act not.
These three arise together, advancing in mutual ascent.
Harmonious qi overflows, and Great Peace flourishes.
Humans and creatures gather, the world unites as one.
The gate of misfortune is sealed, and all under heaven are as innocent as infants.
The age knows no shame or disgrace, nor witnesses fortune or calamity.
Knowledge and artifice are obstructed, and the natural Great Thoroughfare opens wide.
Households receive the blessings of spirit illumination,
and each person attains the merit of sagely wisdom.

At this time, the lord is like heaven and earth,
and the people like newborn babes.
They drink of the lord’s virtue, feed on the lord’s harmony,
yang emerges and yin enters, rolling and unfolding with the Dao.
The sovereign father presides above, now present, now absent.
All under heaven are hushed and murmuring,
like fledglings unaware of their mother,
like chicks acting without contrivance.
Born, they feel no joy; dying, they know no sorrow.
Gentle and yielding, their nature and destiny abound.
None seek it, yet the myriad blessings come of themselves.
What is the reason for this?

The lord does not speak, yet the Dao acts through non-action.
The gateway of non-action, the mechanism of wordlessness,
lies in essence-subtlety, abides in spirit-fineness.
The inception of spirit-fineness, the origin of essence-subtlety,
grows without root or stem, emerges and enters without gate.
Ever between action and inaction, at the source of harmony.
Thus it may be heard yet not displayed,
seen yet not expounded,
attained yet not transmitted,
employed yet not spoken.
Wielding it and extending it, grasping it and returning to it,
easy for the wise to expound,
difficult for the shallow of hearing to speak.
Why is this?
Vast and profound, none among the multitude can reach it;
ascending yet seeming to reverse, none among the multitude can enter it;
bland and overflowing, none in the world can hear it;
dim and obscure, none among vulgar lords can practice it.

---

**Which is closer: name or self?**
Which is greater: self or wealth?
Which is more harmful: gain or loss?
Therefore, excessive love must bring great expenditure,
hoarding much must bring heavy loss.
Thus, knowing contentment avoids disgrace,
knowing when to stop avoids peril—
this is how one endures long.

**[Exegesis]**
What is endowed by my nature to become me is virtue;
what is borrowed to give me life is spirit;
what is formed through dependence is Great Harmony;
what takes shape through reliance is heaven and earth.
All these exist through me, yet I cannot make them exist.
Thus, nothing is more exalted than virtue as a model,
nothing more lofty than spirit as a standard,
nothing more expansive than Great Harmony as a paradigm,
nothing more manifest than heaven and earth as illumination.

Virtue and spirit constantly give life without death;
the pure and turbid, Great Harmony, transform without end.
The Dao of heaven and earth persists yet is hard to destroy;
the workings of yin and yang move yet are hard to exhaust.
From this we see: calamity culminates in death,
blessing culminates in life.
Therefore, the sage
traces above to the intent of virtue,
gauges below to the heart of heaven and earth.
Lofty honor, auspicious virtue,
profound vastness, boundless esteem—
nothing surpasses life.
The myriad things arrayed, rare treasures,
gold, jade, pearls, and jade disks—
deep profit, immense gain—
nothing surpasses the self.
The craftsmen of a troubled age,
the artisans of a disordered state,
who sever and oppose heaven and earth,
who harm my self—
nothing is greater than name.
Life swollen with pride, overflowing with excess,
impoverishing the people and draining the state,
disturbing the spirit, multiplying desires,
rebelling against heaven and violating the Dao,
contending to become thieves—
the world grows estranged,
the age fills with war.
One man’s doing brings ruin to ten thousand states,
lords die, people perish,
things suffer its poison—
nothing is greater than wealth.

Thus, gain and loss may bring harm or benefit.
Gaining name and gaining wealth,
virtue does not dwell,
spirit does not remain,
the great mandate is severed,
and heaven cannot save.
Losing name and losing wealth,
virtue protects,
spirit aids,
renown arises naturally,
wealth matches heaven and earth.

Therefore, those who diminish the self for great fame
cannot discuss the ultimate Dao;
those who slight the self for the sake of the state
cannot plan for profit.
The nameless name is the dwelling that gives me life;
the named name is the sack that destroys me.
Wealth without possession is the blessing that nourishes me;
wealth with possession is the thief that ruins me.
Thus, excessive love for the self,
establishing glory for the people,
acting for it, striving for it,
exerting force and toiling,
forcing one’s nature and emotions—
this harms the spirit.
Hoarding wealth day by day,
growing proud and overflowing,
the way of pride and ruin—
wealth and name both end.
Thus, spirit cannot revive,
heaven and earth cannot preserve.
Why is this?

The transformative power of Dao and virtue follows the reckoning of heaven and earth—one yin, one yang—dividing into the four seasons, separating into the five phases, weaving into a vast net, establishing an unbroken web. The natures of the ten thousand things each have their allotted measure, never encroaching upon one another.

The heart of creation is harmonious, upright, and impartial, naturally uniform, straight and balanced, without love or aversion, communing equally with all things. It trims the long to extend the short, reduces the full to fill the empty; what is insufficient is nourished, what is excessive is lost. Greed, gluttony, and hoarding invite calamity and misfortune. Never satisfied, the mind of profit constantly arises. The cunning deceive the foolish, the strong seize from the great. Yet nature equalizes all—fame and gain return to their master.

Losing them brings sorrow, gaining them brings joy. One joy, one sorrow, and the hun and po drift; one sorrow, one joy, and the spirit departs. Body perishes, name vanishes, misfortune extends to descendants. Thus, fame and profit stand to the self as charcoal to ice—opposing in form and nature, never coexisting in the same state. Where name reaches its end and the body its limit, yet the self endures and the world thrives—such a thing does not exist under heaven.

Therefore, those who disturb the heart and deceive the mind, who employ emotion in serving the spirits, who rush about day and night pursuing affairs, who adorn their appearance and refine their words, who worry for the multitudes, who initiate projects and establish merit, who steel themselves and rise in integrity to display glory and fame—these damage what sustains the self and augment what destroys it. They exhaust sinew and strength, endure hunger and thirst, brave cold and heat, tread perilous straits; they wear thin clothes and eat coarse food, never filling mouth or belly; they greet the dawn and send off the dusk, bearing shame and enduring humiliation; their essence scatters, their spirit races, ceaselessly striving. Defying the Dao to chase glory, they take much to be their own—endangering the self to secure peace, amassing wealth while the spirit perishes. Wealth’s woes arrive on their own, pride and ruin come together. Thus, they seek fortune only to lose fortune, pursue profit only to flee profit.

The affairs of success and failure lie in acting or not acting; the way of survival and ruin lies in departing or approaching. Therefore, those who know contentment embody the Dao and align with virtue, sever fame and remove profit, establishing themselves in selflessness. They nurture others without claiming life for themselves, accompany things without asserting their own existence. In trust and compliance, this suffices to preserve the spirit; in household affairs, it suffices to see out the year. Abiding in constancy and nature, they cannot be slain; dwelling in emptiness and nothingness, they cannot be harmed. Disdaining fame and slighting things, they cannot be defiled; desiring what is undesired, they attain enduring glory.

Those who know when to stop—though honored as Son of Heaven—do not bend their will; though poor and dwelling in mountain caves, they do not darken their spirit. Advancing, they do not consider it illustrious; retreating, they do not consider it destitute. Without misfortune or fortune, without gain or loss, they neither incur guilt nor claim merit. They neither seek nor refuse, like rivers and seas, roaming the mysterious realm, their spirit and name in communion. Moving in accord with heaven and earth, they cannot be endangered; distinct in benefit and harm, they abide forever.

Thus, their essence is profound and unshaken, their spirit firm and unyielding, towering like heaven and earth, illuminating like sun and moon. Both refined and spirit-like, they preserve their selves. Knowing contentment and when to stop, they endure long. This is called fleeing fame while fame follows me, escaping profit while profit pursues me.

The *Great Perfection Appears Deficient* Chapter

Great perfection appears deficient, yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness appears empty, yet its use is boundless.
Great straightness appears bent, great skill appears clumsy, great eloquence appears inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold, stillness overcomes heat.
Only through stillness and clarity can one become the norm of the world.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao and virtue act through non-action, and the spirit and people are thus harmonized. The numinous illumination acts through non-action, and the Great Harmony arises spontaneously. The Great Harmony acts through non-action, and the myriad things govern themselves.
Some take root without being planted, some run without feet, some hear without ears, some cry out without mouths—diverse kinds and different categories all engage with it.
The mother loves her child, the child loves its mother; male and female unite, and creatures revere their lord.
Those born from nests have beaks, those born from wombs nurse; birds scatter in alarm, beasts gather in fright.
Yin creatures dwell in caves, yang creatures nest in trees; fire moves upward in flames, water flows downward in moisture.
The myriad things flourish green, growing in spring and maturing in summer, ripening in autumn and harvesting in winter—all return to the earth.
Without governance or instruction, things follow their nature.
From this perspective, action does not produce action, negation does not produce negation, brightness does not produce brightness, obscurity does not produce obscurity.
Not acting, not negating, not brightening, not obscuring—only then does one grasp the principle.
Thus, the great Dao is level and open; one need not step beyond the door, yet the farther one goes, the less one knows.
The Dao resides within the self, not in the wilds; transformation arises from me, not from others.
The myriad things are ever ordered, and wisdom does not arise.
Therefore, the sage holds harmony as his handle and walks in rectitude, governing without form.
Roaming the empty vastness, he mirrors the most subtle.
He abandons the ethereal soul and forgets the corporeal soul, resting his essence and calming his spirit.
Through non-action, things are so; through profound silence, trust is established.
Vast and boundless, luminous and solitary, he alone endures.
Faint and fleeting, his affairs are plain and true.
His use is inexhaustible, yet none perceive or hear it.
Why is this so?
Subtle and wondrous, all-pervading and dense, pure and tranquil in truth—before form or sound, it transforms its origin.
It guides like the yang, blocks like the yin, dams like the earth, and moves like the heavens.
Civil and martial arts arise mysteriously, and great virtue distinguishes itself.
Thus, fullness appears empty, substance appears void.
It does not display benevolence or righteousness, does not show models or standards, does not establish laws or engage in action.
The ruler’s desires are not desires, and the world transforms itself.
Sincere and unadorned, the people are like infants—dim and unaware of what they seek, vast and ignorant of where they go.
Its use is boundless, flowing without decline.
Without plowing, there is food; without weaving, there is clothing. In heat, one rests in nudity; in cold, one moves in furs.
Without taboos, one dwells with deer; hair unbound and mouth full, they follow one another in play.
The ruler has abundant virtue, the people have surplus wealth; transformation permeates the myriad things, accomplishing all without effort.
Light and shadow vanish, only the profound and wondrous remains. Heaven and earth, humans and things—all transform with it, riding emptiness and bearing the void, wandering with the Dao.
Traversing the four seas, circulating through the six directions, vast and boundless, it rests in the utmost nothingness.
Why is this so?
Straight yet appearing bent, upright yet appearing crooked.
The world’s ruler is the sound, and the world is the echo.
The world’s ruler is the form, and humans and things are the shadow.
Thus, without sacrifices, the heart of heaven is harmonized; without leaving one’s seat, the four seas are rectified.
Therefore, it is said, “Great skill appears clumsy.”
The Dao of heaven is naturally lowly.
Without calendars, yin and yang harmonize; without solar terms, the four seasons follow their course; without laws, the world submits; without rewards or punishments, names and realities align.
Concealing martial power and hiding might, there is nothing it does not overcome; abandoning warfare and conquest, there is nothing it does not subdue.
Without decrees, the people rectify themselves; without texts, the world becomes enlightened; without seals, the world trusts itself; without measures, the myriad things balance themselves.
Thus, abundance appears deficiency, and gain appears loss.
Without bells or drums, the people rejoice; without flavors, the people find food sweet; without fine garments, the people are beautiful; without accumulation, the people have plenty.
Why is this so?
Following the Dao and relying on heaven, not engaging in cunning or contrivance, the people are left to their nature.
The Dao of heaven and earth advances and retreats, and the myriad things achieve completion; transformation cannot be blocked, nor can expansion or contraction be obstructed.
When yin reaches its extreme, the earth cracks and ice forms; cold winds howl, frost and snow are severe; fish and turtles hibernate, and the myriad things curl up.
At such times, sitting in a warm room by a furnace, wrapped in layered furs and fine wool, one still cannot withstand it.
Yet when one stabilizes the spirit and calms the essence, moving the body and exerting the form, then principle is released, sweat flows, clothes are cast off, and one steps outside—warmth suffuses the body.
When yang reaches its extreme, sand and stones scorch, flying birds perish, water creatures flee, and the myriad things wither; rivers and streams dry up.
At such times, entering deep, clear springs, wearing light garments, resting on high terraces, or holding cold stones, one still cannot endure it.
Yet when one purifies the heart and releases the mind, entrusting the spirit to stillness, casting the body beyond the four seas, and roaming the mind within nothingness—heart level and qi harmonized—coolness suffuses the self.
As for the arts of cunning and contrivance, they govern human affairs, nurture the multitude of forms, extend virtue to heaven and earth, and match merit to yin and yang.
Yet when they give rise to chaos, it emerges from the formless, arises from the soundless, unfurling with governance and shifting with transformation.
Grasping people like moisture, overtaking them like shadows, responding like an echo to sound, inseparable like a shadow from form.

The more one acts, the more chaos arises; the more one governs, the more vexation grows. Even luminous wisdom cannot grasp it, nor can severe punishments restrain it. Yet non-action is the lord of action and the master of achievement, the origin of governance and teaching, the mother of transformation and change. Its eradication of calamity and disorder is like restlessness overcoming cold and stillness overcoming heat.

Thus, the sage discards knowledge and relinquishes thought, empties the heart and concentrates qi, cleaves to clarity and stillness, and responds naturally. Then the heart of heaven is followed, and the intent of earth is obeyed. Governance is enacted and transformation flows like the light of the sun; calamity and disorder vanish like clouds dispersed. The world mirrors this, accomplishing all without striving; the myriad things take it as their teacher, serving all without exception.

**The World Possesses the Dao**

When the world possesses the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields. When the world lacks the Dao, even mares give birth on the battlefield.

No crime is greater than indulging desire; no disaster is greater than discontent; no fault is greater than covetousness. Contentment with contentment is ever content.

**Exegesis:**
Man’s life hangs by the ruler’s command; the ruler’s standing hangs by the people’s will. When the ruler attains the Dao, the myriad people flourish; when the ruler loses the Dao, the myriad people perish. When the people flourish, ancestral temples stand in glory; when the people perish, ancestral temples collapse. Thus, the ruler is the people’s source, and the people are the ruler’s root. If the root is harmed, blossoms and fruit will not grow; if the source weakens, streams and foam will not fill.

When ruler and ruled protect one another, they endure long. Therefore, when the lord of an age attains the Dao, the realm is undisturbed, feudal lords submit in reverence, the hundred barbarians rejoice in harmony, the four seas share a single wind, and weapons of war are not raised. Those who scheme and defend have no words to offer; stalwart warriors have no deeds to perform. The wise and eloquent plow alongside the marshes; fine steeds and swift horses labor in harness. The world is at peace, each delighting in their work. Customs are honest and mores are thick; the people are single-minded, weaving to clothe themselves, tilling to feed themselves.

The heart of heaven is harmonious and mild; the myriad things ripen in abundance. Auspicious omens arrive in succession; felicitous signs gather together. This is not heaven bestowing fortune but the lord of the age embodying virtue and the Dao.

When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao, feudal lords cease their court visits. Valleys diverge and peaks stand apart; laws and systems clash and differ. The four directions rebel; strength and rectitude vie with one another. Armies are raised to contend for power; the weak become captives, the strong become lords.

Thus, the world selects generals and recruits warriors, sharpens armor and weapons, and hangs beacon fires, each side watching the other. Deep treachery and grand deceit are plotted in the ancestral temple. Mutations arise and wonders are born; alliances are formed and coalitions are forged. Light chariots and fierce cavalry engage in equal combat. Soldiers and horses are born on the outskirts, passing years without return. Cunning and force are exalted; the first to strike is deemed meritorious.

At such times, warhorses are adorned and fed, leaving no leisure for kin. Racing to the outskirts, they arrive first, often eating only beans and coarse grain. Greedy men sit as ministers; mediocre servants and slaves become bandits. The common people are utterly exhausted, their wealth depleted and strength spent. Prolonged conscription and military service continue without end. Yearning for home, they are mournful and impassioned, longing for their parents’ exhaustion and weeping bitterly. Kind fathers and loving mothers grieve and sorrow, their livers and gallbladders, qi and wills crushed within.

Soldiers tread on one another’s heels, their bones exposed, scattered across the wilds in numbers beyond counting. Roads are filled with the grieving, all orphaned children, thinking of their parents’ commands, leaping up in tears. What crime has blue heaven committed to visit this calamity upon them? Women are left without husbands; the young are left without fathers. Grief and sorrow gather unbidden. The eldest become leaders; the middle-aged become stewards. High and low protect one another; inner and outer guard each other. Though not bound by blood, they are as close as brothers.

They bind seedlings into banners, dig the earth to make drums, grasp weapons and ready tools, marching in formation. Constantly practicing combat, they deliberate on their lord, their purest intentions resonating, their qi transforming and moving as one.

Thus, heaven and earth are sealed and knotted; yin and yang are blocked and closed. Stars and constellations scatter in disarray; the sun and moon contend and eclipse. Deceit and rebellion sprout; disasters and anomalies erupt together. This is not heaven sending down misfortune but the lord of the age lacking the Dao.

One who receives heaven’s great mandate, succeeding the former sages, honored as the Son of Heaven, enriched by the four seas—his rank exalted, his favor supreme, none can compare. Yet when he wears coarse cloth and plain furs, the world deems it fine; when he eats vegetable broth and wild greens, the world calls it delicious. Transforming the age and altering customs is like the wind bending grass; the people’s compliance is like fish rushing to water.

Yet if he does not strive to exalt the Dao and broaden virtue, cultivate himself and rectify his conduct, labor on behalf of the common people, uphold sacrifices, glorify his ancestors, and transmit his legacy to his descendants—if his virtue does not rival the divine luminaries, if his name does not endure with heaven and earth—then he turns instead to arrogance and extravagance to seek fame, ceaselessly pursuing power, defying heaven and opposing earth, sparing none from humiliation.

Thus, men of boundless ambition rise in succession, lightly advancing and deeply penetrating, the first to arrive gaining the advantage. Enemies approach from afar, yet none engage with them. Factions dissolve and alliances break; inner and outer circles can no longer rely on one another. The ruler dies, the state perishes, ancestral temples collapse and decay. This is the fault of covetousness, not the world’s crime.

Therefore, those who wield coercive power and exalted favor, exhausting the people from above, whose names and titles shine with glory, covering the world—yet who know no contentment—are the instruments of calamity and the great reckoning of peril and ruin.

The Dao, virtue, and the numinous mold and transform, shaping one into human form, preserving and uniting the essence-spirit to embody great physicality. Movement is nimble, actions effortless; ears hear keenly, eyes see clearly. Roaming the realm of luminous vastness, one listens and gazes between heaven and earth. Above, one observes the patterns of nature; below, one examines the successes and failures of ancient generals. One digs a well to drink, tills the fields to eat, takes a wife and begets children, growing old alongside the people. This is the sufficiency of sufficiency. How much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots or the ruler of a thousand? Their sufficiency is self-evident.

Thus, the issue does not lie in the Dao but in the constant arising of the mind for gain—coveting others’ lands, desiring others’ wealth and treasures, ceaselessly annexing and endlessly accumulating. This is the great reckoning of pursuing disaster and the essential cause of incurring blame. From ancient times to the present, among flying birds, running beasts, and all beings that bear qi, none do not desire to obtain and preserve their lives. Therefore, those who dwell in the position of a ruler become captives; those who act as tigers become mice. Their names soar above the azure clouds, yet their bodies lie beneath the yellow springs. Those who occupy the station of oxen and horses know no suffering of oxen and horses; those who entrust themselves to the ranks of dogs and sheep incur no blame of dogs and sheep.

Thus, the ruler who attains the Dao establishes the heart in sufficiency, roams the will in cessation, relinquishes power and yields authority, standing solitary and alone. Casting aside the myriad things, one holds only to the spirit. The body endures, the name flourishes, and one remains unperishing for long. The world submits to them, and none cannot be governed.

The "Not Exiting the Door" Chapter

Not exiting the door, one knows all under heaven.
Not peering through the window, one sees the Dao of heaven.
The farther one goes forth, the less one knows.
Therefore, the sage knows without traveling, names without seeing, accomplishes without acting.

**Exegesis:**
The transformations of the Dao and virtue shape and mold the primal head, bestowing nature and life within the realm of the Great Void and the depths of the Dark and Obscure, where the myriad things begin in chaos.

When spirit and luminosity intertwine, clear and turbid separate, and the Great Harmony courses through the vast and boundless wilds and the subtle and wondrous midst, the myriad things are born.

Heaven is round, earth is square; humans stand upright, beasts move horizontally; plants root in kind, fish sink and birds soar. Things are distinguished by their kind, grouped by their category; hierarchy is established, and good and ill fortune arise.

From this perspective, heaven, earth, and all beings share the same primordial beginning, the same ancestral origin. Within the six directions and beyond the cosmos, all are interconnected as one body. Yet when qi transforms and diverges, moving vertically and horizontally, it splits into two and divides into five: some become black and white, some water and fire, some sour and salty, some minor and major keys; beings of the same kind become male and female. All these, though kin as brothers, differ in form and dwell in separate realms. Their interests and harms oppose each other, and the myriad things, being distinct, cannot be fully described.

Yet they unite in joy and anger, reverse in life and death, share the same nature and emotions, and follow the same principles of the heart and mind. How so?

Zhuangzi said: Within a single body, born of the same parents, the four limbs and nine orifices each have different functions; the five viscera and six bowels each have their own roles. The upper and lower do not know each other; the inner and outer do not see each other. The head and feet are like heaven and earth; the elbows and knees, like the four seas; the liver and gallbladder, like distant Hu and Yue; the eyebrows and eyes, like neighboring Qi and Chu. If they were not born together, with distinct bodies and separate forms, moving without mutual reliance and resting without mutual support, even the nine heavens above or the Yellow Springs below would not suffice as metaphors.

Yet when the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk; when the chest is diseased, the mouth cannot speak. When the heart is at ease, the ears and eyes are keen, the limbs are nimble, and the hundred joints are agile—this is because they share the same form.

When the ruler moves nearby, beings respond afar; when beings move here, heaven and earth respond there. That and this resonate; exit and entry have no gate, coming and going no door. Within the space between heaven and earth, in the vast and boundless void, though distant and expansive, all things respond to one another without the slightest deviation—because they share the same body.

Therefore, the sage does not step beyond the door, yet traces back to the origin of parents above and measures the descendants below. They discern danger and security, benefit and harm, reverse the discourse on life and death, examine the principles of right and wrong, comprehend the root of benefit and harm, and grasp the foundation of order and chaos. By knowing their own household, they know others; by grasping the essentials of affairs, they grasp the order of things. In action, they know where to go; in stillness, they know what to guard.

The Dao and virtue are their father, spirit and luminosity their mother, clarity and stillness their teacher, the Great Harmony their friend. All under heaven is their home, and the myriad things their body. They regard others as themselves and themselves as others; their heart dares not arise, their will dares not act. They cast aside knowledge and precedent, sever the three and five, follow without contrivance, and dwell in caves and grottoes. They do not kill living kinds, do not eat raw plants, do not wear unfinished cloth, do not gather unripe fruits. Heaven, earth, and all beings each preserve what they possess.

Tracing back to the time before my signs appeared, I know whence nature and life arise, from where spirit and essence derive, where blood and qi begin, and on what the body is founded. Thus, I know that reality is born of emptiness, being arises from non-being, the small enters where nothing does not, and the great encompasses where nothing does not.

The root of my life lies in the Dao and virtue. While still in the womb and not yet born, I know how form is completed. Upon emerging from the obscure, I know the great passage of the profound, subtle, delicate, soft, moist, and smooth; the great achievement of non-knowing, non-perception, non-action, and non-affair.

Observing myself as an infant growing into maturity and awareness, I see how the soft gives rise to the hard, the weak to the strong, the small to the great, the short to the long, the foolish to the wise, and the dim to the bright.

Examining my breathing, bending, and stretching, I know that loss is the head of gain, gain the origin of loss; advance the root of retreat, retreat the foundation of advance; fortune the beginning of misfortune, misfortune the forerunner of fortune.

Ascending slopes and gazing upward, traversing obstacles and crossing dangers, the body weary and breath panting—when one rests in stillness, spirit becomes calm and qi harmonious, inner and outer mutually preserved. Thus, I know the great achievement of clarity, stillness, emptiness, and non-action.

The four limbs and nine orifices, rushing about in disarray, with different abilities and distinct forms, all return to the one heart. Thus, I know that the harms and changes of the hundred directions and myriad things all arise from the ruler.

Examining this against heaven and earth, verifying it through past and present, movement never contradicts—thus I know that the Dao of heaven and earth is fully contained within me.

Thus, the household is the root of knowing others; the body is the deep spring of knowing heaven. To observe heaven without relying on the body, to observe others without relying on the household—small and near, yet great and distant; small knowledge leads to great confusion. Departing from the household and stepping beyond the door, one does not see the world; departing from the body and peering through the window, one does not know the Way of heaven. The farther one strays, the less one knows; roaming the four seas, the greater the confusion. The more one seeks the vast, the smaller one’s merit and fame.

Not seeing, not hearing, seeking knowledge within oneself—the meeting of heaven and humanity, the great Dao is complete. Therefore, the sage does not observe the likes and dislikes of a single household to govern the affairs of ten thousand households, nor takes a journey of a thousand miles to command the changes of the nine provinces. Without ascending to heaven, they know the heart of the nine heavens; without entering the earth, they know the intent of the nine lands. The advance and retreat of yin and yang, the transformations of the four seasons, the profound and hidden, the obscure and dark—none can escape their awareness.

Why is this so? By examining the inner to know the outer, tracing the small to know the great, using oneself to understand others, and illuminating the near to illustrate the distant. Thus, when the sage acts as ruler, it is like the heart within the self, the self within the body. Without knowledge, they follow the Dao; without desire, they respond to heaven; through non-action, they guide the world; through non-interference, they nurture the people. Profoundly still and silent, they allow transformation to arise naturally, above in accord with the spirit’s clarity, below in harmony with the hearts of the myriad things. In movement, they oppose it; in stillness, they abide with it. Empty, tranquil, and serene, they let things be as they are.

Volume III (First Proofreading)
*Daily Accumulation in Learning*

Daily accumulation in learning increases;
Daily practice of the Dao diminishes.
Diminish and further diminish,
Until reaching non-action where nothing is done.

Those who would take the world
Always do so through non-interference;
When they interfere,
It is insufficient to take the world.

**Exegesis:**
The transformative power of virtue and the Dao
Shifts and moves, empty and profound.
Vast and silent, drifting without form,
Boundless and indistinct, chaotic and without origin.
Invisible to sight, inaudible to hearing,
Yet in its opening, guiding, bestowing, and imparting,
There is nothing it does not pervade.
In the completion of works and fulfillment of affairs,
There is nothing it does not accomplish.

Non-action as action
Is the root of the myriad things.
From this perspective,
Knowledge that knows not is the ancestor of knowing;
Teaching that teaches not is the origin of teaching;
Non-action as action is the beginning of action;
Non-interference as interference is the source of interference.
All these several matters
Are what the spirit luminaries rely upon,
What heaven and earth return to,
What the profound sages follow,
And what reclusive scholars transmit.

Yet when benevolence and righteousness grow shallow,
And nature and destiny lose their authenticity,
Failing to perceive the great Dao,
One moves only in accord with the heart’s desires.

Ensnared in cunning and habit, gradually steeped in partial love and favor,
Emotions and desires multiply, spirit clings to things.
Deep schemes grate upon the ear, grand discourses offend the heart.
Rejecting the Dao, they exalt knowledge; prizing merit, they cherish fame.

Thus, they devise arts and govern by calculation,
Amass words and compose texts,
Inscribe them in books and scrolls,
To instruct the myriad people.
They frame the warp of heaven and earth,
Weave the woof of yin and yang,
Dissect and judge human affairs,
Sunder and scatter ancestral bonds.
Unadulterated simplicity transforms,
Deception arises in myriad forms,
Customs shift and turn,
Uprightness topples, norms decay.
They alter proper rites and change attire,
All matters stand fully revealed:
Bells and drums, zithers and lutes,
Interspersed with reed pipes and sheng,
Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating,
Adorning appearances, they flock and soar.
Three hundred rites, three thousand solemn observances,
Branching and conflicting, they vie in contention,
Initiating affairs and embellishing texts.
With eloquence they seek to refute,
With skill they strive to surpass,
Each fine hair raised, each minute detail magnified,
Endlessly compounding.

Thus the world turns from the root, abandons the origin,
Turns toward the branch, reverts to ornament,
Learned in breadth, probing in depth,
Each household knows, each door holds a sage.
The worst emulate the sages,
To establish lord and subject.
Those of like mind can hold no office;
Those of differing heart, though their merit be great, perish.

Thus the world grows restless,
No leisure to attend to kin;
Pursuing and practicing the trivial,
Striving to please their lords.
They blend the five flavors to nourish the mouth,
Rich, fragrant, sweet, and crisp,
Heedless of the multitudes;
They vary the five colors to nourish the eye,
Black and yellow, fine and exquisite,
Unmindful of the people’s poverty;
They harmonize the five notes to nourish the ear,
Exhausting the subtleties of bells and pitch,
Unconcerned with the world’s excess;
They raise lofty terraces, expand palaces,
To nourish their intent,
Unafraid of the people’s destitution;
They gallop and hunt to nourish their ambition,
Seeking abundant capture,
Disregarding heaven’s will.

None of these many matters are pursued as true good or duty,
But to please their lords.
The world follows suit,
Nurturing falsity, adorning deceit.
They dissolve harmony and concord,
Fostering the root of violence.
This becomes custom,
Cunning and profit are deemed worthy.
They diminish the great mandate of the people,
To increase their toil;
They harm the fine nature of humanity,
To multiply the people’s vexations.

At such a time, valleys differ in lord,
The four seas each have their king,
Honoring names, prizing power,
Might and greatness are held right.
Resentment and strife escalate,
Strength and force prevail,
The strong seize the weak,
The many control the few.
They replace order with chaos,
Substitute wrong for right.
Ministers murder their lords,
Sons murder their fathers.
The greater the contention,
The less can be preserved;
Seekers are many,
Attainers are few.

The roads are filled with sorrow and grief, all speaking of war and armies, clamor and uproar, even to the point of boiling one another alive. Why is this so? They adorn culture and multiply affairs, striving to outdo one another in rank. Thus the sage abandons benevolence and discards righteousness, returning to the great Dao, cutting off knowledge and abolishing instruction, seeking it within the self. Their words grow ever fewer, their deeds ever fewer, diminishing and dissolving them without cease, day and night. They envelop all in vast obscurity, leaving the people without shame. Culture is extinguished, affairs cease, and the world settles of itself. Diminish and diminish again, so that knowledge does not arise. Conceal one’s name and efface one’s person, preserving one’s spirit. Grasping the essence of virtue and power, abiding by the pivot of existence and decay, they neither act as masters of affairs nor serve as teachers of knowledge. Silent as though no one were present, they reach non-action. Heaven and earth act of themselves, all virtues follow in accord, the myriad things take form on their own, and the hundred barbarians harmonize naturally. The people, foolish and bewildered, know not where to turn; they follow the light in its rising and setting, entrusting themselves to the four seasons. Their spirits roam freely, their minds do not stray outward. Within, their intent is empty, like drifting wood, like resting earth, unknowing of benevolence and righteousness, unversed in rites and propriety. Their hearts know not desire, their wills know not action. Their steps falter, their gaze is unsteady, their speech is silent, their spirit and qi profound. Outwardly they resemble beasts, yet within they are singularly different. Still and inactive, as though there were no ruler or subject, they govern without governing, fostering sincerity and loyalty, attaining great peace. Spirit rests, essence is at ease, nature and life are preserved of themselves, the myriad things follow in succession, drawing near to the Dao and virtue.

Why is this so? The ruler issues no commands, and the people hear nothing. Thus, to take hold of the world, one must always remain without affairs; not speaking is the method, non-action is the teaching. Absence of desire is the treasure, unknowing is the essential. Acting in accordance with the Dao, nothing remains unopened and guided. Abandoning the hollow and returning to the real, taking the ultimate as one’s affair—above, one knows the height of heaven; below, the depth of earth. One discerns the division of yin and yang, comprehends the reckoning of the myriad things. By day, one sees stars in the sky; by night, fish in the rivers. The ear harmonizes with the eight winds, the eye surveys the fur of all creatures. This is the utmost of thought and consideration, yet it avails nothing for preservation. Strength ten times that of Wu Huo, power a hundredfold that of Meng Ben, courage a thousandfold that of Xia Yu, might sufficient to command three armies—advancing like sunlight and shadow, retreating like floating clouds, striking like thunder, unmoving as the overcast sky—this is the utmost of strength, yet it avails nothing for victory.

If one were to make all the people of the world grasp ritual and propriety, master the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, understand statutes and precedents, and know decrees and commands—each household with an official, each village with a magistrate, each district with a granary, each post with an armory—scrutinizing and adjudicating, enforcing martial law to seek out thieves, then the world would stand on tiptoe, casting sidelong glances in fear. Fathers and sons would not conceal for one another, brothers would not tolerate one another. This is the utmost of governance, yet it avails nothing for order.

Thus, to know with knowledge is to depart from heaven; to act with action is to rely on heaven; to manage with affairs is to lose heaven’s intent. In governing a state, the more one adds, the more the hundred harms are fully prepared. Acting without accomplishment, seeking without attainment, the world drives itself onward, returning to chaos.

The Sage Without a Constant Heart

The sage has no constant heart, taking the hearts of the hundred clans as his heart.
Those who are good, I treat with goodness; those who are not good, I also treat with goodness—thus goodness is attained.
Those who are trustworthy, I trust; those who are untrustworthy, I also trust—thus trust is attained.
The sage in the world, trembling and reverent, unifies his heart with the world. The hundred clans all fix their ears and eyes upon him, and the sage startles them all.

**[Exegesis]**
That the formless Dao rules the myriad heavens arises from the heart that is without heart.
That the formless heavens and earth bring the ten thousand things to compliance arises from the deliberation that is without deliberation.
From this we observe: the heart without heart is the lord of hearts; the use without use is the mother of uses.
How do we clarify this?
Zhuangzi said: That by which I am I—is it truly I? I am like one who takes the body as body, yet the body’s being body depends on my presence. And that by which I am I depends on the presence of spirit. That by which spirit abides in me is the Dao’s doing.
The art of entrusting oneself to the Dao and the method of retaining spirit take stillness as their root and emptiness as their constant. They cannot be attained by the heart’s intentions or brought about by thought and deliberation.
Thus, the dwelling of the wise: ears and eyes seeing and hearing, heart and mind thinking and deliberating, eating and drinking in due season, pursuing desires to their fullest, intelligence and clarity all at work, ceaseless day and night—traversing every path, calculating every affair, determining the origins of safety and danger, illuminating the roads of departure and approach, all to preserve the body and extend the great mandate.
Yet if this is so, then spirit is thereby diminished, blood and qi are thereby corrupted, hun and po scatter, and the great mandate is harmed and cut short.
When one sleeps, the heart’s intentions are not employed, hearing and seeing are blocked, thought and deliberation cease, eating and drinking stop. Spirit harmonizes and aligns, blood and qi are born and rest, the heart finds its peace, the body is free of the hundred illnesses. Even when meeting with misfortune and harm, great wounds heal, severed bones reconnect, the hundred joints and nine orifices all attain what they desire.
Consider this: in the body of a single person, when the heart is set aside, danger returns to peace; when the heart is employed, safety leads to ruin. How much more so for one who upholds the Dao, follows the spirit-light, accords with heaven’s heart, and nourishes the multitude of beings!
Thus the sage establishes the body that is without body, embraces the heart that is without heart, possesses the having that is without having, and entrusts himself to the abiding that is without abiding. Above, he contains the transformative power of the Dao and virtue; below, he encompasses the hearts of the myriad people.
He has no hatred, no fondness, no love, no loathing. He does not make enemies of the wicked, nor does he draw close to the fortunate. He does not ally with the sincere, nor does he resent the deceitful. He bears all as the earth, covers all as the heavens, illumines as the sun, transforms as the spirit. Beings great and small, he regards as his own body. Before they arise, he acts; before they manifest, he governs. He severs the roots of calamity and initiates the origins of fortune.
He sets aside his own passions and desires, taking what the people find peaceful. He relinquishes his own wisdom and deliberation, returning to spontaneity. He moves with harmony, guides with the uncarved. Above, he contains the intent of the Dao and virtue; below, he attains the heart of the spirit-light. His radiance stirs heaven and earth, his power connects with the myriad people. The people have no taxes or corvée, the ruler has no offices or officials. All attain their nature, each possesses its spirit. Seeing, they see nothing; hearing, they hear nothing. They forget essence and abandon will, taking the ruler as their heart. With him they rise and fall, with him they sink and swim. Following him, they lie down and rise; yielding to him, they bend their bodies. Without speaking, the world responds; without acting, the ten thousand things abide.
Within the four seas, there are no proclamations or commands—all transform their hearts. The good progress toward great goodness, growing daily more luminous. The wicked transform their natures, gradually attaining harmony. The trustworthy attain great trust, reaching impartiality. The false alter their dispositions, daily growing more sincere. The cruel and violent return to goodness, the devious and false revert to truth. Good and evil, trust and doubt—all return to spontaneity.
At this time, all is submerged in the great void, steeped in supreme harmony. The people forget their hearts and intentions, drifting and floating, losing what they loathed and obtaining what they sought. They advance and retreat with heaven, circulate with the Dao. Not compelled by prohibitions to abandon evil, not constrained by teachings to change—without acting, they transform, yet do not know it themselves.
Why is this so?
The transformation of the world’s ruler is emptiness and stillness, his demeanor like withered wood, his heart like a bellows, his will like rivers and seas, his bestowal like valleys. He does not distinguish east from west, nor differentiate south from north. He does not discern sweet from bitter, nor discriminate white from black. He does not correct squares and circles, nor determine curves and straight lines. Profound in the mysterious and subtle, he devotes himself to self-concealment. With things, he has no governance; drifting and roaming, he has no limit.
He abandons what he desires to do, aligning with what heaven desires to attain. The ten thousand things, teeming and bustling, all pour into his ears and eyes.
The world’s ruler practices non-action, appearing as if solemn yet at ease. Heaven and earth are his furnace, supreme harmony his bellows, the spirit-light his wind, the ten thousand things his iron, virtue his great craftsman, the Dao his work. The world, verdant and lush, is all moistened and nourished. Thus he can mold the people’s hearts, transform the customs of the age. Above, there is nothing he does not encompass; below, there is nothing he does not overcome. He brings the ten thousand things to completion, weighing all without exception. He moves and stirs the multitude of beings, startling the eight directions. The world, vast and boundless, does not recognize beauty or ugliness. Dark effects and obscure signs spontaneously become the model and standard.

**Chapter on Emerging from Life and Entering Death**

Emerging from life and entering death:
Of those who follow life, ten or three; of those who follow death, ten or three. Yet the people, while living, move toward the realm of death—ten or three. Why is this? Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life walk on land without avoiding rhinoceroses or tigers, and enter battle without donning armor or weapons. The rhinoceros finds nowhere to thrust its horn; the tiger, nowhere to place its claws; weapons, nowhere to lodge their blades. Why is this? Because they dwell in no realm of death.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao, spirit-light, purity and turbidity, and supreme harmony merge indistinguishably as one body, while the ten thousand things take form. That to which form clings—radiant and flourishing, yet unseen in its name—is called *life*. As a thing, life is neither yin nor yang, beyond measure or estimation. Too subtle for description, too profound for naming, it shines in elusive brilliance, without shape or sound, form or image, moving or still without fixed direction. It roams the wilds of emptiness, dwells in the realm of nothingness. Those who attain it endure; those who lose it perish.

Life in relation to form: spirit is its stem, essence its root, the ethereal soul its palace, the nine orifices its gates and doors. Hearing and sight are its envoys, emotions and intentions its chariot, the hun and po its attendants, blood and qi its soldiers. Advancing, it shifts with the Dao; retreating, it coils and unfurls with virtue. Soaring in softness and weakness, it nests in emptiness and nothingness. Bending and stretching, rising and bowing, it harmonizes with time. Those who cling to life oppose it; those who crave survival become its foe. Without cause for gain, it cannot be abandoned; with cause for use, it cannot be retained.

Thus, non-action is life’s dwelling; action is death’s abode. Standing, one forgets the body; sitting, one forgets the mind. Serene as an infant, tranquil as formlessness. Seeing nothing, hearing nothing, doing nothing, saying nothing—transforming and waning, moving and still without constancy. Inclining and rising with the Dao, floating and sinking with virtue, uniting in body with spirit, bending and stretching with harmony. Neither despising things nor prizing humanity, differing in aims from kings and lords, distinct in cares from the myriad natures. Death and life are one, thus no distinction between existence and extinction. This is the non-action of governing the self.

Spring births, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. Follow the ruler’s law, obey heaven’s mandate. Within, cherish parents; without, sever fame and profit. No thought, no worry, no contention, no seeking. Wandering alone, coming alone, embodying harmony and embracing compliance. Yielding to others, not contending with the age. This is the non-action of governing the household.

Revere heaven, honor earth, never forgetting the ancients. Cultivate the self, rectify the law, set aside the self, and entrust others. Verify facts, fix names, harmonize with things, and align with spirit. Arrange attendants left and right, linking front and back. Follow the times, adhere to principle, adapt to what is fitting. Let the ten thousand things arise together, returning to spontaneity. This is the non-action of governing the state.

Wear nothingness as a crown, clothe yourself in formlessness, embrace emptiness, tread the Great Purity. Bear the Dao, float with spirit-light, grasp supreme harmony, drive heaven and earth. Gallop through yin and yang, race the five phases, follow the multitude of beings, traverse the dark and obscure. Roam without achievement, return without fame. This is the non-action of governing the world.

Craving life and seeking longevity, fearing they may not be attained. Forcibly restraining heart and mind, blocking ears and eyes. Guiding and stretching, moving the hundred joints. Exhaling the old, inhaling the new, breathing warm and cool. Clothing oneself in the five stars, consuming the sun and moon. Body and spirit laboring together, never resting. This is the action of governing the self.

Abandoning heaven’s seasons, relying solely on human affairs. The lowly forcefully seek nobility; the poor, wealth. Hungry for fame, thirsty for power, the heart ever burdened with desire. Clothing and food in excess, affairs beyond necessity. This is the action of governing the household.

Enriching the state and expanding territory, delighting in war and relishing arms. Establishing authority, raising standards, names resounding, power ascendant. Forms severe, punishments harsh, steep and unyielding, cutting and deep. Laws meticulous, nets all-encompassing, wielding poison with little mercy. Feared and envied by feudal lords, ever the hero. Dukes strive for hegemony; hegemons, for kingship. This is the action of governing the state.

Honoring filial piety and fraternity, venerating benevolence and righteousness, cultivating rites and propriety, teaching the people refinement. Adorning flavors and appearances to please the people’s hearts. Bells, drums, zithers, and lutes to harmonize the people’s minds. The lord speaks, the ministers listen; the lord moves, the ministers follow. Displaying merit, encouraging conduct, opening with kindness and generosity. Proclamations resounding, making the people submissive and reverent. All affairs entrusted to the self, the hundred directions turning in homage. This is the action of governing the world.

Thus, emptiness, nothingness, purity, stillness, subtlety, fewness, softness, weakness, humility, diminution, timeliness, harmony, and frugality—these thirteen are the followers of life. Fullness, existence, turbidity, disturbance, clarity, multitude, hardness, strength, loftiness, repletion, excess, extravagance, and waste—these thirteen are the followers of death. Why is this?

The sage’s Dao: movement has its cause, stillness its response. The four limbs and nine orifices—these thirteen are the external instruments of life and death. The affairs of emptiness and fullness, the changes of hardness and softness—these are the internal reckonings of life and death. Thus, the thirteen are spoken of in this way.

Emptiness gives rise to fullness; nothingness, to constancy. Purity brings keen perception; stillness, inner clarity. Subtlety generates manifest brilliance; fewness, multitude. Softness gives rise to hardness and vigor; weakness, to firmness and strength. Humility generates height; diminution, increase. Timeliness brings penetration; harmony, the mean. Frugality yields abundance.

This is called "enhancing life." Those who can practice this Way align with Heaven and Earth, ensuring longevity for the body and enduring stability for the state. Even if one wished otherwise, the workings of creation would not permit it.

Fullness gives rise to emptiness; being, to dissolution. Turbidity brings deafness and obstruction; disturbance, loss of clarity. Manifestation generates subtlety; multitude, fewness. Hardness gives rise to softness and decay; strength, to weakness and calamity. Height produces lowness and debasement; repletion, depletion and void. Excess leads to blockage; extravagance, to distress and poverty. Waste invites disaster. All these are inauspicious. Those who practice this Way move toward exhaustion. Their bodies do not endure, nor do their states remain at peace. Even if one wished otherwise, Heaven and Earth would not comply.

Yet the people all possess their lives and ceaselessly seek to enhance them; all possess their bodies and endlessly cherish them. Their actions return to contrivance; their thoughts and plans constantly arise. Thus, they abandon emptiness for fullness, sever nothingness to cling to being, emerge from purity into turbidity, turn their backs on stillness to pursue disturbance, transform subtlety into manifestation, convert fewness into multitude, depart from softness to embrace hardness, discard weakness to foster strength, diminish humility to attain height, forsake diminution to seek repletion, indulge in excess, abandon harmony for extravagance, and—intent on action—replace frugality with waste. Why is this? Because they greatly value their bodies yet forget the Way of life.

Therefore, those who master the art of nurturing life possess a transcendent magnanimity, standing aloof and journeying far. Unbound by convention, untethered to the world, they reduce form to the formless realm and float their spirit in the boundless within. They do not regard life as a benefit nor death as a harm. They bestow without limit, and whether things are small or great, they view them as themselves, without partiality or attachment. Their spirit flourishes, their fortune and virtue converge, the Dao serves as their central sovereign, and its radiance shines outwardly.

In the transformations of nature, they respond with resonance. Heaven, Earth, and all beings cannot thwart them. On land, rhinoceroses and tigers cannot harm them; in battle, the five weapons cannot injure them. Not because they are invulnerable, nor because they are beyond control—rather, their spirit and qi interpenetrate, and the intent to harm is inherently nullified. Why is this? Because sound and echo respond to each other, and things follow their kind. Rhinoceroses and tigers do not attack the formless, and the five weapons do not strike the insubstantial. For those who master the art of nurturing life, the intent to harm perishes within, and the forms of death and injury likewise vanish without.

The editions of *Jindai* and *Xuejin* emend accordingly.

**Dao-Generated Chapter**

The Dao generates them, virtue nurtures them, things give them form, and circumstances complete them. Thus, all things honor the Dao and esteem virtue. The Dao is honored, virtue is esteemed—yet none bestows rank upon them, for they are ever naturally so.

The Dao generates them, virtue nurtures them, rears and fosters them, perfects and ripens them, sustains and shelters them. It generates without possessing, acts without relying, leads without dominating—this is called profound virtue.

**[Exegesis]**
The arts of sagely wisdom do not descend from heaven nor emerge from earth; they reside within the self and extend to all things. Governed by spontaneity, they penetrate all without obstruction; following patterns and emulating forms, they exhaust nothing. Thus, the Dao is empty and virtue is formless, yet they never lose their essence. Heaven is exalted and Earth is lowly, yet they never transgress their measures. Why is this? Because existence is known through non-existence, and things are recognized through human perception. From the formless arise forms, from the void arises fullness; by observing the subtle, one knows the manifest, and by witnessing the beginning, one sees the end. Without cunning or skill, these are the natural workings of things—sages follow them, aligning seamlessly with heaven.

Therefore, knowing the Dao, one grasps that the emptiness of the Great Void bestows all without exception; knowing virtue, one understands that the attainment of nothingness confers all without limit. The Dao, through non-action, ranks among the myriad directions yet has no precedence; virtue, through non-establishment, shapes the forms of the ten thousand things yet remains unburdened. Thus, it refines nature and life, smelts emotions and intentions, forges aspirations and desires, and transforms all affairs.

What are *nature*, *life*, *emotion*, *intention*, *aspiration*, and *desire*?

That which is endowed by the Dao to form the body—whether fragrant or foul, of diverse kinds, human or other, male or female, wise or foolish, brave or timid, great or small, tall or short, benevolent or upright, greedy or cruel, strong or weak, light or heavy, in sound or color, appearance or bearing, refined or coarse, high or low—is called *nature*.

That which is conferred by virtue—wealth or poverty, nobility or baseness, premature death or longevity, suffering or joy, what is fitting or unfitting—is called *heavenly mandate*.

Encounters with rulers and fathers, the movements of heaven and earth, adversity or prosperity, flourishing or decline, survival or ruin as they pertain to oneself—are called *encountered fate*.

The array of the ten thousand things, the affairs one undertakes, the actions taken or abandoned, choices made or rejected, the arrival of fortune or misfortune—are called *contingent fate*.

Movement arising from nature, responses to things upon contact, love or aversion, fondness or hatred, fear or joy, anger or sorrow, grief or resentment, advance or retreat, taking or giving—are called *emotion*.

Movement arising from fate, the arising of thought, the settling of plans, the resolution of safety or peril, the comprehension of all affairs, the discernment of right and wrong, the distinction of sameness and difference—are called *intention*.

Movement from emotion and intention, extending outward to connect with things, perpetually delighting in something, summoning fortune or misfortune, achieving merit or fame—is called *aspiration*.

Following nature and life, adapting to emotion and intention, bound by diverse kinds and myriad affairs, entangled and difficult to untie—is called *desire*.

These six all originate from the Dao and virtue, undergoing endless transformations without limit. Only those who comprehend the Dao and virtue can follow their principles.

When nature is refined and life is exalted, they may be altered or transformed; when nature is coarse and life is base, they may be diminished or enhanced. If one grasps the root, one is not hindered by existence or non-existence.

Thus, heaven, earth, and all beings—those containing minds and encompassing essences, all categories of kinds—obtain the Dao to live, yet the Dao does not claim their virtue; they attain unity to be completed, yet unity does not seek their blessing. The ten thousand things honor and esteem them, cherish and worry for them, yet do not cling to their virtue. Why is this? The Dao is lofty and virtue is vast, profound beyond words. Things cannot enrich them, ranks cannot exalt them. They act without acting for things, do not treat things as things, and are not compelled by anything—yet their nature remains ever spontaneous.

Therefore, as for the Dao as a thing: peering into it, there is no door; examining it, there is no gate. Grasping it, there is no body; imaging it, there is no form. Thought cannot exhaust it, words cannot convey it.

The ten thousand things are generated by it, yet it is not diminished; all things return to it, yet it is not filled. It is boundless above and below, vast and without limit, waxing and waning, expanding and contracting—beyond measure or estimation. It roams the tip of an autumn hair yet is not considered small; it envelops the ten thousand heavens yet is not considered large. Radiant with azure and purple, it does not alter its intent; shrouded in darkness or withered, it does not change its transformations. It moves and acts universally, without preference or attachment, bestowing and conferring nature and life, accomplishing all without exception.

Virtue flows into the ten thousand things yet cannot be reclaimed; its grace binds and its blessings weave, yet they cannot be returned. Gazing upon the world, it is not exhausted; accomplishing and fulfilling affairs, it does not wane.

As for the ten thousand things—does it merely generate them? It generates their forms, establishes and completes them, classifies and propagates them, halts and perfects them, ends and begins them, precedes and follows them. Having entrusted itself to their rear, it is also before them; dwelling in spirit and illumination, it abides in supreme harmony. The pure accumulates above, the turbid congeals below. Heaven is made round by it, Earth is made square by it. Yin attains yin through it, yang attains yang through it. The sun and moon shine by it, the stars and constellations move by it. The four seasons transform by it, the five phases overcome one another by it. Fire is made hot by it, water is made cold by it. Plants and trees are made supple by it, metal and stone are made hard by it. Flavors are made sweet or bitter by it, colors are made dark or yellow by it. Sounds are made high or low by it, changes are made vertical or horizontal by it. Mountains and hills are made stable by it, wind and rain are made to move by it. Scaled creatures swim by it, feathered creatures soar by it. Beasts run by it, humans attain wisdom by it. Diverse kinds and different clans all subsist by it.

Transformations diverge and oppose one another, yet all perish by it. The ten thousand heavens take on disparate forms, water and earth assume different shapes, customs clash, advantages and harms differ, appearances deceive, intentions and desires fail to align—where yin and yang cannot reach, where sun and moon cannot illuminate—all begin by it, all end by it.

With mouth agape and eyes wide, bending and stretching, tilting and turning, in the span of a bow or a breath, wherever spirit traverses, wherever the mind abides, wherever affection is bestowed, wherever male and female transform—there is nothing it does not guide, nothing it does not accomplish.

It gives life yet claims no possession, acts yet seeks no reward, nurtures yet asserts no ownership. The world, bewildered, knows it not.

Some say: "Virtue and the Dao are the numinous clarity of Heaven and Earth; Heaven and Earth are the forms and appearances of virtue and the Dao." How to make this clear? Virtue and the Dao enfold the ten thousand heavens.

Zhuangzi said: "Heaven and Earth have form, yet virtue and the Dao are formless. All things with form have their measures; the formless has no limit or end. To entrust what has measure to what is boundless is like grasses and trees severed from soil, or stars detached from the heavens—insufficient as analogy. To deny this is to fail to comprehend how being and non-being enfold one another, how emptiness and fullness contain one another. It is like the segments of a melon, blind to the neighboring vines; or lice hidden in furs and coarse cloth, unaware of the multitudes in cities and towns."

Thus, beyond the cosmos and within the encircling bounds, there are no prohibitions to restrain, no constraints to bind. Safety and danger, growth and decline—none know inner or outer. Sharing the same wind and direction, harmonious and compliant, all live in flawless beauty, free from harm or decay. The hundred auspices and ten thousand blessings are sheltered by the Dao. Its works are profound, its affairs obscure—unheard of in the world, unseen by all—yet it acts without cease.

The world has a beginning,
which serves as the mother of all under heaven.
Having attained its mother,
one knows her children.
Having known her children,
one returns to guard their mother—
thus, to the end of life, no peril.
Block its openings, shut its gates,
and to life’s end, no toil.
Open its openings, meddle in its affairs,
and to life’s end, no salvation.
To see the small is called clarity;
to guard the soft is called strength.
Employing its light,
returning to its clarity,
leaving no calamity to the self—
this is called following the constant.

**Pointers of Meaning:**
The Dao as a thing is formless and shapeless, without mind or intent, without forgetting or remembering, without knowledge or awareness, without beginning or direction, without action or affairs—empty and tranquil, indistinct and serene.

In its transformations, it changes within unchanging, moves within stillness, returning to generate renewal, renewing to generate return. Being gives rise to non-being, non-being gives rise to being; return and renewal mutually engender, naturally abiding in constancy.

Acting through non-action, the myriad things flourish;
affairing through non-affairs, the myriad things thrive.
Thus, non-action is the embodiment of the Dao and the beginning of heaven and earth.

Subtle and wondrous in non-action, it is all-encompassing and impermeable;
smooth, yielding, and tranquil, it governs all.
In life and growth, in keen perception and discernment, it is skillful and sharp;
in penetrating the ten thousand directions, it irrigates all without exception.
Thus it is said: The origin of action is the mother of the myriad affairs.

The sage who attains it moves contrary to things.
Thus, they comprehend the heart of the Dao, penetrate the principles of heaven, give rise to the origin of life, and open the gateway of affairs. They rely on the knowledge of all directions, exhaust the eloquence of the multitudes, master the skills of heterodox schools, and deplete the arts of the hundred masters.

Moreover, they govern human affairs in accord with the Dao, turning with the transformations of time. Following and cultivating it, they cycle endlessly, beginning anew. Sudden in transformation, they communicate with spirits and command ghosts, manifesting the formless, ordering all affairs without exception. They delve into the boundless, reach the utmost of nothingness, and though capable of carving and polishing, they return to their mother.

Having overturned and returned, they become the root of all under heaven, wandering in the profound and obscure, to life’s end without peril. Thus, they block their keen perception, close the gates of heaven, seal them with the tongue, and lock them with the heart. Without timely cause, they do not move; without harmony, they do not act. The state endures long, and to life’s end, no calamity arises.

For what reason is this so?

Hearing without listening, they share heaven’s acuity;
Seeing without gazing, they share heaven’s clarity;
Transforming without speech, they share heaven’s virtue;
Achieving without action, they share heaven’s merit.
What they uphold is essential, what they affirm is thorough—
the light of Dao and virtue remains unobscured,
and the deliberations of heaven and earth flow unimpeded.
Thus, they respond like echo to sound, follow like shadow to form,
illuminating things without end.
They are the origin of fortune, the ancestors of transformation,
pervading and spreading, merging into the great center.
While the body endures, things align; the world labors not.
For exerting sight dims clarity, straining hearing dulls acuity;
hasty speech mars virtue, artifice and deceit ruin merit.

Therefore, when the mouth gapes wide, ears and eyes strain taut,
knowledge and scheming arise together, and the ten thousand things proliferate.
The heart stirs, thoughts soar, success and fame are pursued—
once name is made and merit achieved, misfortune arrives and fortune ends.
In motion, they are ensnared in heaven’s net; in stillness, they fall into earth’s calamity.
Spirits and numina cannot protect them, creation cannot give them life.
The common people perish, the state is lost.

Thus, the sage
retreats from action, abandons the affairs of affairs,
embodies the heart of the Dao, treads the intent of virtue.
They govern the limit of the boundless, grasp the essentials of spontaneity,
soar in the unbegun, gather in the mysterious and subtle.
Acuity arises where nothing is heard, clarity where nothing is seen;
before sprouts stir, before the first signs divide,
they alone perceive the radiant transformations of the formless.
They penetrate what lies beyond form, reach what has no boundary—
not even the evil of a hair’s tip can arise, nor can blazing calamities approach.
In acting, they act; in stilling thought, they extinguish it.
They accumulate softness, embody weakness, return to non-discernment.
They punish the violent, rescue the few, and transform as spirits do—
invincible in what they do not oppose, accomplishing what requires no action.
No force can be applied against them, the world cannot scheme against them.
In governing people and ordering things, they match yin and yang.
Within, they employ their light, yet outwardly do not transgress clothing and food.
Plowing and harvesting, silkworm-raising and weaving yield abundance.
Fortune accumulates, misfortune dissolves; people are provided for, households are sustained.
The heart bears no demands; the lowly do not aspire to nobility, the poor do not envy wealth.
They honor frugality in the smallest things, neither inner nor outer exceed bounds.
They serve superiors and nurture subordinates—humanity’s way is complete.
Returning within, spirit and numen are not depleted.
They amass and store, yet dare not claim possession.
Their wisdom is like rivers and seas, their deliberations match heaven’s.
They sever the three and five, obscure them with affairs,
fill and block them, making them unrecognizable.
As mist or dragon, they unite with heaven and earth;
as darkness or silence, they reach the Dao’s utmost.
They depart from misfortune, leave behind blame,
avert calamity, abolish harm.
Bearing virtue, carrying harmony, there is nothing they cannot overcome.

Thus, when humans enter the Dao, the Dao enters humans—
Dao and self interpenetrate, merging into one.
Abiding in stillness, attaining utmost emptiness,
I become the Dao’s chamber.
With things, I am as they are, undifferentiated and all-pervading.
Returning to the origin, reverting to the beginning,
the Dao clothes me.

**The Great Dao’s Course**

Were I to possess even slight awareness,
I would walk the great Dao—
only deviation would I fear.
The great Dao is level,
yet the people prefer byways.
The court is excessively adorned, fields lie fallow,
granaries are empty.
They wear embroidered robes, gird themselves with sharp swords,
sate themselves with food and drink, hoard surplus wealth—
this is called thieves’ vainglory, not the Dao!

**Exegesis:**
The Dao does not act through cleverness,
yet it shapes heaven and earth, creates yin and yang—
and heaven and earth cannot deceive it.
Heaven and earth do not act through cleverness,
yet they contain and transform, give life and kill the myriad beings—
and the ten thousand things cannot escape them.
If the Dao abandoned spontaneity to employ cleverness,
the heart could not endure—
how then could it create heaven and earth or bring yin and yang to fruition?
If heaven and earth abandoned spontaneity to employ cleverness,
their bodies could not persist—
how then could they encompass transformation or preserve the ten thousand things?

Thus, emptiness, non-action, non-knowing, and desirelessness
are the heart of Dao and virtue, the intent of heaven and earth.
Purity, stillness, mirroring images, non-action, and responsive adaptation
are the movements of Dao and virtue, the transformations of heaven and earth.
How is this known?
Zhuangzi said:
What the Dao gives life to, heaven brings to flourish.
Beginnings begin from the unbegun, life arises from the unborn.
Existence exists from non-existence, perishing perishes from imperishability.
These are the proofs of spontaneity, the constants of transformation.

Therefore, when human actions do not accord with the Dao, the Dao does not protect them;
when they do not accord with virtue, virtue does not aid them;
when they do not accord with heaven, heaven does not cover them;
when they do not accord with earth, earth does not bear them.
Where Dao and virtue do not protect or aid,
where heaven and earth do not cover or bear—
calamity is never far, and fortune and virtue never near.

Thus, the dark sages and reclusive scholars,
embracing penetration and grasping comprehension,
lift acuity and grasp clarity,
follow the Dao and uphold virtue,
discard knowledge and forget the self,
sharpen their resolve with caution and awe,
fearing only missteps.
They strive for the skill in unskillfulness, pursue the clarity in obscurity.
Trusting in compliance and softness, they till the soil to eat,
content with sufficiency, returning to namelessness.
Trembling and vigilant, they fear losing spontaneity—
lest calamity reach heaven and earth, misfortune extend to the people.

Thus, auspicious responses and the arrival of fortune and virtue
follow like shadow to form, echo to sound—
no appointment is made, yet they arise together as if born in the same moment.
Therefore, the great Dao is level, its transformations formless.
Seemingly distant, yet near; seemingly dark, yet bright.

The Way is level and free of defilement, essential and simple to practice.
Through non-action, achievements are completed; through non-interference, blessings overflow.
Heaven and earth follow it, and the myriad things are born thereby.
Yet the people turn their backs on it, employing their cleverness and acuity.
They rely on artifice and abandon the Dao, defying earth and opposing heaven,
exalting knowledge and prizing cunning, deceiving ghosts and insulting spirits.
They adorn governance with depravity, embrace falsehood and forsake truth,
inventing and altering systems, initiating affairs to pursue success.
They build grand mansions and lavish towers, great gates and lofty doors,
adorned with the strange and extraordinary, embellished with ornate patterns.
They take knowledge as their standard, skill as their plumb line,
deceit as their axe, and falsehood as their adze.
Holding to schemes and manipulating numbers, they scorn weaving and despise farming.
Fields grow foul and untended, with weeds and crops sprouting together.
No seedlings rise in the fields, and granaries stand empty.
Their garments are layered in five hues—brocades and embroideries in black and yellow,
fine silks and damasks, resplendent and dazzling.
They wield sharp swords and sturdy armor, powerful crossbows and strong bows,
light chariots and swift horses, surrounded by ruthless men.
Their power is weighty and their names prominent, their might and influence widespread.
They slaughter and conquer villages, enslave the common folk.
They envy integrity and resent deference, detest loyalty and poison trust,
weaving webs of deceit and falsehood, turning against the good as if they were enemies.
They esteem conflict and valor, ceaselessly encroaching and oppressing,
extending their reach beyond borders, constantly plotting regicide.
Their feasts overflow with rich flavors, as they ravage and slaughter living beings,
ripping open wombs and killing fledglings, defying the will of heaven.
They live in perpetual drunkenness and satiety, insatiable in their demands,
hoarding gold and jade, amassing treasures like mountains.
Their possessions—rare jewels and precious goods—rival those of rulers,
paraded in and out with the strange and marvelous, their glory and splendor radiant.
They distance themselves from the multitude, transcending the common world,
alone and aloof. In an age of chaos, they are exalted and hailed as great men.
Their transgressions surpass the crowd, their sins grave and their misfortunes deep.
A wise father would not raise them, a enlightened ruler would not employ them.
The Dao does not protect them, the spirits do not abide with them,
heaven does not shelter them, and the myriad things resent them.
Those who act thus invite ruin and receive calamity,
suffering afflictions in life. If they themselves escape,
their misfortunes extend to their descendants.

The "Shan Jian" Chapter

What is well established cannot be uprooted,
what is firmly embraced cannot be lost—
thus descendants maintain their ancestral sacrifices without cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes genuine;
cultivate it in the family, and its virtue abounds;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue flourishes;
cultivate it throughout the world, and its virtue becomes universal.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.

How do I know this is so?
By this.

**【Pointer to the Return】**

Between Heaven and Earth, vast and distant, with diverse winds and customs, myriad beings in abundance, transformations endless, benefits and harms deceptive—thus what one can do, one cannot control, and what one cannot do, one ends up doing. If I act for the world, the world also acts for me; when self and other meet, the other is many while I am few. Meeting the many with the few, the few will surely perish.

Thus, if one establishes oneself through knowledge, knowledge will be seized; if through skill, skill will be overpowered; if through strength, strength will be subdued. Only in non-action can nothing defeat it. How to prove this? Seeking an echo in silence yields no response; seeking a shadow in darkness yields no follower. Yet fearing the echo and striking metal makes it resound all the more; loathing the shadow and standing in light makes it cling ever closer. From this we see: non-action cannot escape fortune, nor can action flee misfortune.

Therefore, the sage abandons strength, skill, knowledge, and worthiness. Establishing the Dao and embracing virtue, gathering essence and storing spirit, embodying harmony and assuming weakness, treading the earth and bearing the heavens—empty, still, and serene, as if absent yet present, inwardly and outwardly silent, transforming in the mysterious. Without action or affairs, returning to simplicity and reverting to the genuine, without laws or measures, moving with change as it is.

Embracing the small and entrusting the great, shepherding the myriad people, adapting to square and round, before and after, ever present with the self. With the body upright and spirit at peace, the lineage is passed to descendants. Virtue accumulates and transformation flows, overflowing without end, waning yet waxing again, enduring with Heaven to the end.

Thus, cultivating it in the self yields a nature simple and emotions compliant, a heart penetrating and will unobstructed—what was distant is no longer far, what was obscure becomes clear. Valuing spirit and cherishing qi, slighting things and trivial names, thoughts unconfused, blood and qi harmonious. Sinews and bones supple, ears and eyes keen, skin moist and lustrous, complexion radiant. Spirit concentrated and steadfast, life flourishing and verdant, the body light and strong, beauty enduring without end.

Cultivating it in the family yields a husband faithful and wife chaste, father kind and son filial, elder brother gentle and younger brother respectful, the nine clans harmonious and close. Farming and sericulture timely, stores abundant, the six livestock thriving, affairs well-ordered, wealth ever surplus, the village esteems them.

Cultivating it in the village yields clear standards and order, actions harmonious and balanced, names and realities aligned. Black and white distinct, right and wrong divergent in principle, truth and falsehood self-evident, treachery and deceit do not arise. Authority and dignity esteemed, commands obeyed and prohibitions upheld, superiors served and inferiors transformed, public as if father and son, reverent, loving, trusting, and devoted—all rejoice. The people harmonious and gathered, officials without arrears, duties fulfilled and reputations honored, called gentlemen, ever virtuous in surplus, secure to the end of their days.

Cultivating it in the state yields a sovereign enlightened and ministers loyal, the court not blocking the worthy, scholars not envying merit, the crooked not obscuring the upright, slander not harming the public. Harmony and compliance, superiors and inferiors without resentment, officials content in their posts, all affairs natural. Distant peoples yearn and admire, the world shares the same wind, the state wealthy and the people prosperous, borders secure without conquest. Ancestral temples revered, altars of soil and grain eternally peaceful, yin and yang in perpetual union, disasters and chaos do not arise. The myriad things abundant and ripe, the realm profoundly at peace. Neighboring states entrust their fate, descendants flourish, virtue and the Dao in surplus, enduring with Heaven as constant.

Cultivating it throughout the world yields a sovereign as yin and ministers as yang, the sovereign still and ministers active, the sovereign round and ministers square, the sovereign yielding and ministers initiating, the sovereign silent and ministers speaking. Upright, impartial, and just, harmonious and universally connected, level and effortless, still and soundless. Virtue spreads through mutual proclamation, spirit gallops through mutual transmission, movement without origin, transformation like Heaven. Knowing without acting, accomplishing without striving, merit aligned with the Dao, the world reverts to the genuine—without affairs or worries, Great Peace arises of itself.

Thus, my self is the measure of others’ selves; my family is the balance of others’ families; my village is the compass and square of others’ villages; my state is the plumb line of others’ states. The sovereign is the heart and center of the world; the world is the body and form of the sovereign. Therefore, the world shares the sovereign’s fortune and affliction, deviance and uprightness. When the sovereign and people are whole, the world is the same. Families and states mutually preserve one another, sovereigns interconnected. If one can master oneself, the world becomes natural.

Thus, one who can know me knows all; one who can govern me governs all; what benefits me benefits all; what suits me suits all. What is unsuitable for me yet suitable for others does not exist in the world.

Volume Four (First Collation)
*Abounding in Virtue*

Abounding in virtue is likened to an infant: venomous creatures do not sting it, birds of prey do not seize it, fierce beasts do not maul it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm. It has not known the union of male and female, yet its *qi* stirs—such is the perfection of its essence. It wails all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of its harmony.

To know harmony is to know constancy; to know constancy is to be enlightened. To seek excess in life is to invite misfortune; to let the mind command the *qi* is to invite rigidity. When things reach their prime, they age—this is called "not the Dao." What is not the Dao perishes early.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao is emptiness and nothingness; the numinous is still and serene. Profound and subtle, the Great Harmony flows smooth and unobstructed. Listening, one hears silence; gazing, one sees emptiness. Above and below are boundless; east and west are without limit. Heaven cannot enclose it; earth cannot contain it. Compass cannot render it round; square cannot render it square. Measures cannot measure it; quantities cannot quantify it. Gold and jade cannot shield it; water and fire cannot obstruct or consume it. The myriad things cannot master it; calamities and misfortunes cannot befall it.

It soars and sinks, vast and boundless, its heart without dwelling, its form without abode. It shapes and bestows, giving rise to the ten thousand heavens, and the myriad things receive it, flourishing and thriving. Knowledge and thought cannot grasp it; effort and action cannot attain it. The more one ponders, the more distant it becomes; the more one strives, the more elusive it grows. Grasping it, it does not capture me; releasing it, it does not let me go.

Only the desireless make their bodies its dwelling, treasuring it in their hearts—hence, "abounding in virtue." Virtue in a person is like parents to the body; its relation to the myriad things is like pearls and jade to tiles and lead. Thus, one who abounds in virtue values the self and scorns the world, like a loving father or filial son who would not trade their neighbor for themselves. To esteem the self and belittle things is like a discerning merchant who would not exchange pearls and jade for tiles and lead.

Their desirelessness is not because they despise wealth and cherish integrity, but because nothing in the world can delight their hearts. Their emptiness is not because they love stillness and hate disturbance, but because nothing in the world is worth doing. Why is this so? What they possess is weighty, while the world is light. Understanding the balance of weight and light, comprehending the shifts of benefit and harm, the myriad things cannot enslave them, and the world cannot burden them.

Thus, emptiness arises without being sought; stillness emerges without being cultivated; the spirit settles without being rested; *qi* harmonizes without being regulated. Therefore, without listening, one hears the soundless sound; without seeing, one perceives the formless form; without thinking, one grasps the meaning of right and wrong; without deliberation, one reaches the realm of sameness and difference. The spirit pervades heaven and earth; virtue surpasses yin and yang. Without seeking blessings, heaven and earth protect them; without shunning misfortune, harm departs. Without killing or punishing, the world fears them; without bestowing gifts, the world loves them.

They drum their bellies and rejoice, look up and down and delight. Grass is their feast; water is their sweet nectar. Beneath towering trees, their spirit remains whole; in mountain caves, their hearts are ever joyful. The poor delight in their work; the lowly forget their humility. In poverty, they are content unto death; in hardship, they forget peril. Their merit rivals the earth; their virtue equals heaven. They return to simplicity, reverting to the state of an infant.

Therefore, in establishing the self and governing the state, if one truly embodies the demeanor of an infant, then the world will honor the Dao and esteem virtue, each valuing their own self. Fame and power become filth; the myriad things become dust. The greedy flee from rank; the cruel return to benevolence. Softness and weakness gather; only virtue is cultivated. How then could those who create fortune and incite chaos arise?

Alas! The Dao of heaven and earth is profound and distant, wondrous and subtle. Few can recognize it; fewer still can practice it. Wisdom and intelligence cannot attain it—only the infant can embody it.

The infant, as a being, knows yet does not express, understands yet does not articulate, is capable yet does not act, is skillful yet appears clumsy. Alive, it seems dead; new, it seems worn. It acts through non-action, in perfect accord with the Dao. It lives the life of non-life, embodies the self of no-self, employs the use of non-use, hears the hearing of no-hearing. Without action, without affairs, without intention, without mind, it seeks neither Dao nor virtue, nor accumulates spirit. Without thought or obstruction, its spirit and *qi* do not stir; its faculties are without knowledge. Soft, weak, empty, and still, its hun and po are at ease. It delights in the joy of no-joy, rests in the desire of no-desire. In life, it does not squander its spirit; in death, it does not obscure its will.

Thus, it embraces the Dao and abounds in virtue, aligning with heaven and earth. Bees, scorpions, and venomous snakes do not intend to sting it; birds of prey and fierce beasts do not intend to seize or maul it. Its bones are weak, its sinews soft, yet its grip is firm. Unaware of male and female, yin and yang transform within it. Its essence is full, and the myriad beings converge upon it. Though it wails all day, its throat does not grow hoarse—this is called harmony of will. Acting in accord with it, one aligns with the Dao as constancy. Holding fast to it, one’s days and months grow wise and bright. In ten days or a month, life flourishes, and every movement accords with a hundred blessings. The heart’s intent arises mysteriously; *qi* flows smoothly and grows strong.

With nothing to do, there is nothing it cannot overcome; with nothing to desire, its movements incur no loss. Naturally penetrating and unobstructed, a multitude of virtues sprout. Heaven and earth cherish and protect it; misfortunes and chaos vanish of themselves. Why is this so? Because it abounds in virtue, harmonizes the spirit, and embodies the innocence of a child.

Yet once it gains knowledge, it departs from the One and turns to the Two, leaves darkness for light. The self is adorned daily while virtue wanes; the more wisdom grows, the deeper the confusion. Thus, it values the world and scorns its spirit, esteems fame and power while belittling its self.

Deep contemplation and far-reaching schemes scatter the spirit.
Turning from softness and abandoning weakness, one strives for hardness and strength.
Ensnared by desire for gain, drowned in the pursuit of life,
one opens the path to peril and blocks the way to perfect safety.
Thus, blessings are as vast as heaven and earth, yet seen but not perceived;
misfortunes strike like thunder, heard but not anticipated.
Emerging from non-being into being, one daily forges calamity.
Acting, one reaches exhaustion; striving, one meets destruction.
Cultivating the self and cherishing the state, one brings misfortune upon the state.
Offering sacrifices and burning incense, one provokes heaven and earth;
praying and making offerings, one loses the favor of ghosts and spirits.
This is not the fault of fate—things follow their own course.

**The Knower Does Not Speak**

The knower does not speak; the speaker does not know.
Block the apertures, shut the gates,
blunt the sharpness, untie the tangles,
soften the glare, merge with the dust—
this is called the Mysterious Sameness.

One cannot be drawn near, nor kept at a distance;
cannot be benefited, nor harmed;
cannot be honored, nor debased.
Thus, one is esteemed by all under heaven.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao has no constant method, virtue no constant form,
spirit no constant body, harmony no constant appearance.
It cannot be seen by looking, nor heard by listening.
It cannot be gazed upon, nor grasped by hand.
Thus, those who attain the Dao see alone, hear alone,
act alone, and abide alone.
A father cannot transmit it to his son, nor a minister to his lord.
It is like a mother recognizing her child, or an infant knowing its parent—
this mutual recognition arises naturally.
Yet the reason for this cannot be explained.

The five flavors are on the tongue, the five tones in the ear,
yet what is sweet is not truly sweet, what is bitter not truly bitter,
what is *shang* not truly *shang*, what is *yu* not truly *yu*—
yet Yi Ya and Shi Kuang could distinguish them.
But the means by which they did so cannot be spoken.

Thus, the form of the formless can be seen but not perceived;
the image of the imageless can be imitated but not expressed;
the action of non-action can be followed but not described;
the use of the useless can be practiced but not transmitted.
Therefore, one who has attained the Dao
perceives it as a child knows its parent,
treads upon it as the earth,
bears it as the heavens.
Clothed in it, one embodies it as the self.
In movement, one rises and sinks with it;
in stillness, one rests and rises with it;
in bending and stretching, one conforms to it.
The spirit roams with transformation; the will moves with virtue.
Wisdom and clarity arise within, yet outwardly one seems deaf and blind.
Thoughts and reflections stir mysteriously, appearing as if mad or deranged.
The mouth cannot speak it, nor the mind make it clear—
like dreaming of being a king,
treading on perilous heights, facing deep abysses,
joy and sorrow alternating, the heart alone knowing,
yet upon waking, one cannot explain it even to a neighbor.

Those who lose the Dao are not so.
They see the outer but not the inner,
recognize the flow but not the source,
grasp the branch but not the root.
Thus, what should be so is not, and what should not be is.
The Dao lies outside, not within the self.
The mind of the mediocre is unsettled, its grasp not firm;
its will is wavering, its emotions entangled with things.
Wisdom and clarity dazzle, falsehood is taken for truth,
seeming to be and not to be, as if present and absent.
Harmonious *qi* is easily disturbed, like illness in a person.
Yang dissipates, the spirit scatters, one hates silence and loves speech.
When speaking, the mind is preoccupied,
the will is lost in thought,
wisdom and clarity turn outward, the spirit departs.
The voice is exhausted within, yet seems full without;
virtue and the Dao scatter, growing ever more distant.
The more one speaks, the less is seen;
the more one pursues, the less is known.

Thus, speech is the crux of opposing the Dao,
the art of resisting virtue,
the tool that overturns heaven,
the instrument that subverts earth.
Therefore, the man of Dao diminishes his hearing and abandons his clarity,
neither seeing nor listening, as if without perception.
He seals his mouth and binds his tongue, as if speechless.
He blunts his sharpness, releases his attachments,
his mind holds nothing, his form seems bodiless.
He dissolves his thoughts, scatters his concerns,
seeming unaware, as if hidden and alone.
He eradicates misfortune at its root, returning to primal simplicity.
His countenance does not change, his attire and color remain unaltered.
He follows heaven and earth, adapts to custom,
delves deeply into the great Dao, and wanders with virtue.
He speaks without speaking, acts without acting,
governs himself with tranquility, responds to the times with equanimity.
He merges with the world’s chaos, harmonizes with the common in mystery.
He grasps the root of things, holds fast to the origin of affairs,
alone and distinct from the crowd, unknown to all under heaven.
He roams the gates of closeness and distance,
soars through the doors of profit and harm,
floats in the fields of honor and disgrace,
yet firmly guards his own spirit.
He retreats into the realm of formlessness,
wanders in the wilds of boundless abandon.
Poverty and lowliness bring no shame;
wealth and nobility cannot tempt him.
The myriad things cannot contend with him,
nor can knowledge or force dispute him.
He takes nothing, gives nothing,
gains nothing, loses nothing.
He shuts his doors and seals his gates, cutting off all beginnings and endings.
The spirit and clarity govern him; the Dao is his sovereign.
In movement, he nears transformation;
in stillness, he communes with the constant.
Harmonious and timely, he endures long.
At ease, he abides forever,
free and unbounded, without precedent or successor.
Thus, love cannot bring him near,
nor hatred drive him away;
rewards and gifts cannot add to him,
taxes and levies cannot take from him;
rank and emolument cannot elevate him,
poverty and lowliness cannot debase him.

Nothing can be done about the myriad things, thus they cannot enslave him;
he takes no account of the world, thus the world cannot possess him.

**Governing the State with Integrity**

Governing the state with integrity,
deploying troops with the unexpected,
and taking the world through non-action—
how do I know this is so?

The more taboos in the world, the poorer the people grow;
the more sharp tools the people possess, the more benighted the state becomes.
The more cunning and skill people have, the more strange things arise;
the more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear.

The words of the sage declare:
I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves;
I remain without affairs, and the people enrich themselves;
I love stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I am without desire, and the people return to simplicity.

When governance is dull and unrefined, the people are honest and sincere;
when governance is sharp and exacting, the people are lacking and deficient.
Misfortune leans upon fortune, fortune hides within misfortune—
who knows their ultimate turning?
Without the constant, the constant reverts to the strange;
goodness reverts to the ominous.
The people’s delusion has endured for long indeed.

**Exposition:**
The essence of the Dao and virtue lies in constancy and sincerity.
In change and movement, stillness and rest, being and non-being alternate.
They cover and bear heaven and earth, warp and weft yin and yang,
govern the sun and moon, nurture and sustain all living things.
Those who defy them perish; those who follow them flourish.

Thus, the Way of heaven and earth is one yin, one yang.
Yang qi governs virtue; yin qi governs punishment.
Punishment and virtue oppose each other, with harmony at their center.
Spring gives birth, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores—
ending and beginning again, declining and rising once more.
Yang ends and reverts to yin; yin ends and reverts to yang.
Yin and yang oppose each other, continuing without end.

Therefore, the kingly Way and human affairs are one yielding, one firm;
one civil, one martial, with the central and upright as their warp.
Firmness and yielding oppose each other; arms and virtue are linked.
Arms end and revert to virtue; virtue ends and reverts to arms.
Arms and virtue mutually preserve each other, with the law at their center.
Law and principle intermingle, thus achieving great penetration.

For this reason, enlightened kings and sage rulers
diminish desires to empty the mind,
empty the mind to pacify the spirit,
pacify the spirit to know the Dao,
know the Dao to rectify the heart,
rectify the heart to rectify the body,
rectify the body to rectify the household,
rectify the household to rectify the law,
rectify the law to rectify names,
rectify names to rectify the state.

When the state’s guiding principles are set in order,
with clear distinctions and discerned principles,
tracing things to their roots and origins,
linking left and right, interweaving front and back,
all things are as they should be.
Rectify names to verify reality; examine reality to supervise names.
Each name and reality align, balanced and thorough,
square and round, curved and straight—none may deviate from the other.
Rewards and punishments are applied without excess or deficiency;
names and realities are as bright as the sun and moon.

When a single name is rectified, the state prospers;
when a single name is perverse, the state is enslaved.
The subtlety of nurturing the state lies in having no fixed method—
advancing and retreating, taking and giving, moving with the times.
In times of disorder, rely on law;
in times of adversity, rely on arms;
in times of peace, hold to the Dao,
embodying virtue as the constant.

In encounters great and small, regard each other with integrity.
If integrity is lost, transform them;
if they do not follow, restrain them;
if they do not cease, control them;
if they do not submit, attack them.

As for a small state pressed between great states,
facing an unprincipled ruler—
if serving with integrity is impossible, then leave;
if leaving is impossible, then cede territory;
if ceding is impossible, then lead the people to avoid them;
if avoidance is impossible, then take up staff and flee;
if flight is impossible, and calamity will reach the people,
with disaster about to strike oneself—then devise a plan and act.
This is how contention arises and arms come into being.

I wish to select generals and train soldiers,
sharpen armor and weapons, accumulate grain and raise ramparts,
encamp and defend—
but the people will be exhausted, the state drained.
This is how war is waged, and integrity is thereby established.

I wish to enter with integrity,
but I am few while they are many, weak while they are strong—
like eggs hurled against stone, bringing disaster upon myself.
The three armies will surely be defeated, soldiers killed and wounded.
Heaven’s will will not be attained; ancestral temples will be destroyed.
Below, I grieve for the lives of the people;
above, I fear the heart of heaven and earth.
This is how judgment moves, and the unexpected is employed.

Thus, devise a plan that reverses the past,
summon affairs that overturn the present,
open the hearts of the people,
and inspire the schemes of the feudal lords.
Manifest the protection of my virtue and power,
unfold the assistance of heaven and earth,
unify the hearts of the four seas,
and harmonize the intentions of the myriad states.
The people respond to me like an echo;
neighboring states follow me like a shadow;
flying birds and running beasts go with me as one.

This is how plans are put to use, and the unexpected is carried out.
Above, align with the intent of the Dao and virtue;
below, accord with the heart of heaven and earth.
In peril or peace, benefit or harm, regard the people as oneself.
Embody the formless form,
abide in the deepest yin,
enact the action of non-action,
and raise the soundless sound.
Reveal their crimes of annihilation and transformation,
illuminate their merits of defying heaven,
display what heaven has sent down,
and show what earth has brought forth.
Some have names without reality; some have reality without names.
When names and realities conflict, some are upright, some are askew.
Moving freely and reversing, merging with the obscure—
heavenly disasters arise of themselves, and monstrous evils are born.
They estrange father and son, sever brother from brother,
kill their fierce generals, execute their loyal ministers.
The world resents them, and none share their hearts.
Standing alone and towering, they receive heaven’s arms.
Victory in battle brings great joy; the four seas are at peace.
This is the highest use of the unexpected.

Stir the world’s anger, gather those skilled in the unexpected.
Extend ears and roam with eyes, sharpening hearing and brightening sight.
Scholars travel in all directions, forming friendships and alliances.
They nurture strange transformations, responding to treachery with the Dao.
Adorn power and cultivate influence to enrich the people.

Spreading deceptive words and fabricating affairs to confuse the enemy.
Speaking humbly and lowering oneself to shut their ruler’s mind.
Offering light missions with heavy rewards to open their ministers’ hearts.
When ruler and ministers grow estranged, seize control of their spirits.
Act in secrecy and move with subtlety.
Dangle their lives by the thread, manipulating their pivotal points.
Drive the enemy to madness and delusion, leaving them powerless to act.
Advance or retreat as circumstances demand, without fixed form.
Without attack, the enemy yields of itself; without battle, the enemy falls into peril.
Overthrow their ruler without harming their ministers, execute their generals without decimating their armies.
Victory brings joy to the people, and the feudal lords stand in awe.
This is the second use of the unexpected.

Control their terrain, master their ruler and ministers.
Offer humble words and heavy rewards to comply with their outward demeanor,
while weaving a web of secret schemes to sow discord among their allies.
Treachery arises from their side, and the Dao flourishes from ours.
Grant cities in numbers to enfeoff generals, cede states to entice traitors.
Traitors come like ghosts, their plots like spirits.
Stratagems are unfathomable, unexpected changes endless.
Divide their strength, sow doubt in their hearts.
As if emerging from the earth, as if born of heaven,
separate their close advisors, scatter their alliances.
Generate shifts in power and create changes to control their fate,
thwart their plans so they cannot be trusted.
Break their strong supporters to isolate their resolve.
Seize victory by adapting to circumstances, like a ring without end.
Strike when the moment is ripe, maintaining harmony as the constant.
Attack their vulnerabilities, cut off their supplies in stillness.
Strip them and seize, starve and parch them,
weigh them down and entangle, drown them in water and burn them with fire,
exhaust and torment, freeze and heat them,
entice with profit, madden and confuse,
press them in haste, corner and press them.
Strike from high to low, use the many to control the few.
Strengthen ranks and divisions, organize troops into interlocking units.
Protect those above, rescue those below,
so the three armies safeguard one another, bound as father and son.
Deploy unexpected formations, conceal ambushes in varied positions.
Encamp ahead while striking behind, triumph on the left while feigning defeat on the right.
Dazzle with banners and confuse with gongs and drums.
Advance like surging waves, retreat like wind and rain,
charge like a landslide, engage like tigers.
Unassailable in defense, unstoppable in attack,
victory spreads awe, and the world trembles in fear.
This is the lowest use of the unexpected.

Once chaos is pacified and all things flourish in peace,
the heart of heaven is greatly fulfilled, and the world rejoices.
Conceal the unexpected and diminish cunning,
focusing on loyalty and trust.
Embrace tranquility and simplicity, withdraw from affairs and cease speech.
Why is this so?
The transformations of the Dao and virtue give rise to all things without exception.
Things have high and low, their directions diverge.
Paths taken and abandoned differ, some west, some east.
Each follows its nature to preserve its life.
The fortunate are known for their goodness,
the wicked for their evil,
the sincere for their trustworthiness,
the deceitful for their pretense.
Each employs their wisdom to avoid misfortune.
Seeking without fulfillment, the wise resort to deceit.
Toiling without rest, the loyal turn to treachery.
Constrained and distressed, the trustworthy abandon sincerity.
Driven to extremity, the worthy forsake benevolence.
Thus, if the ruler favors cunning, the people grow deceitful;
if the ruler favors profit, the people invite disaster;
if the ruler favors rewards, the people fall into hardship;
if the ruler favors punishments, the people harbor resentment.
Why? Affairs originate with the ruler, but their execution lies with the ministers.
Rewards come from the ruler, but their resources come from the people.
Laws issue from the ruler, but their enforcement lies with the ministers.
Whatever the ruler desires, the world follows the wind.
Thus, governing with impartial intent is not as great as the harmony of no-mind;
suppressing transgressions with desire is not as effective as the loyalty born of no-seeking;
regulating joy and anger with moderation is not as meritorious as the achievements of non-action;
cultivating harmony and virtue through reflection is not as expansive as the great flow of no-affairs.
Mastering the arts of Yu Fu and Qi Huang to govern is not as virtuous as a world free of illness;
wielding the strategies of the Yellow Emperor and Tai Gong, grasping the essentials of Sun and Wu to conquer,
is not as potent as relying on a world untroubled by the machinations of wisdom and force.
Thus, what the Dao and virtue generate, even love cannot benefit;
what heaven and earth accomplish, even effort cannot attain.
Only those without attachment can benefit it; only those without action can fulfill it.
Therefore, enlightened kings and sage rulers,
without desire or seeking,
without initiating or acting,
without action or affairs,
without embellishment or display,
return to the origin and restore simplicity,
and the world finds peace of itself.
How to illustrate this?
Zhuangzi said: To initiate fortune and generate profit,
to achieve success and complete affairs,
to prepare resources and put them to use,
to enrich people greatly,
leads the world to extravagance and excess,
leaving wealth and goods insufficient, and the people ever more base.
When blessings fill mountains and marshes,
gold and jade pile high,
the state grows ever more unstable,
and the people reap ever fewer benefits.
Adorning wisdom to outwit one another,
using deceit to coerce,
erecting barriers against depravity and excess,
the paths of treachery and falsehood grow dense.
Distinguishing similarities and differences,
the shifts of right and wrong multiply,
and the state darkens while governance declines.
Crafting techniques and perfecting skills,
carving and embellishing with patterns,
pursuing the strange and the bizarre,
to praise the virtuous
and distinguish the noble from the base,
cleverness and artifice flourish,
and the extraordinary grows ever more peculiar.
Swift rewards and deep punishments,
harsh penalties and severe laws,
carving flesh and severing limbs,
alienating the distant and estranging the close,
even kin grow discordant.
Crimes lead to extermination,
rewards to enfeoffment as marquises,
and heaven and earth quake in terror,
while bandits and thieves multiply.
Thus, the words of the sage declare:
*“I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.”*
Why is this so?
The ruler is the heart of the world.
Qi responds to stimulus, and the body follows;
sound and echo answer one another,
form and shadow follow suit—
the analogy is insufficient.
Therefore, if the ruler truly practices the non-action of the Dao,
the hearts of the world will have nowhere to turn,
clothed in the Dao and embracing virtue,
without thought or seeking,
without commands or laws,
the myriad people transform themselves.
If the ruler truly engages in the affairs of no-affairs,
the world will have no models to emulate, no images to imitate,
no knowledge to acquire, no understanding to grasp,
no rewards to bestow, no gifts to confer,
and the myriad people enrich themselves.

If the ruler can truly rest in the stillness of non-stillness and delight in the purity of non-purity, then the world will neither learn nor inquire, neither hear nor see, neither punish nor penalize, and the myriad people will rectify themselves. If the ruler can truly desire the desire of non-desire, then the hearts of the world will be empty and their aspirations level; whether great bodies or small things, in motion they return to stillness, in stillness they find sufficiency, unbound and unrestrained, and the myriad people return to simplicity.

Thus, the governance of the ruler—neither filial nor benevolent, neither bestowing nor granting, vast and unadorned—leaves the people yearning and toiling, weary and indistinct, unable to distinguish good from evil or right from wrong. Yet they attain what they desire, and their nature and destiny remain whole. If the ruler’s governance spreads virtue and dispenses benefit, sharp-eyed and discerning, the people become clear-sighted, all knowing fortune and misfortune, filial piety and brotherly love, benevolence and righteousness—every affair distinguished. Anxious and fretful, discerning deceit and deficiency, they lose their peace, and their nature and destiny are cut short.

Fortune arises from misfortune, misfortune arises from fortune. Fortune and misfortune share the same abode yet dwell apart, both perishing and persisting, differing in essence yet bound in the same garment. They follow one another in and out, arriving together yet diverging in extremity. Without a sage, none can grasp this alone. Thus, to abandon fortune is to be without misfortune; to be without misfortune is to be without fortune. The fortune of no-fortune is subtle and profoundly still—though the world seeks knowledge, none can fathom its depths. Only those who practice non-action can follow its principle. Rectitude lies between fortune and misfortune, overcoming all without exception. To lose rectitude is to give rise to the strange, and the people grow confused; the good become monstrous, right and wrong reverse, and the world falls into great delusion, never to recover.

**Square Yet Uncut**

Square yet uncut, sharp yet unscarring,
straight yet unforced, radiant yet ungleaming.

In governing people and serving Heaven, nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality can one be early in submission.
Heavily accumulating virtue leaves nothing unconquered.
None know its limit—thus one may possess the state.
Possessing the state’s mother ensures long endurance.
Deep roots and firm stems yield long life and lasting vision.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao encompasses all yet does not bestow,
thus it preserves the myriad things by preserving itself.
It is capable of all yet does nothing,
thus the myriad things are as they are.
How to clarify this?
The Dao’s essence is emptiness and formlessness,
yet the myriad things possess form;
it has no shape or appearance,
yet the myriad things are square and round;
it is silent and soundless,
yet the myriad things produce sound.
From this, it is clear:
the Dao does not bestow yet the myriad things endure,
does not act nor govern yet the myriad things are as they are.
Being arises from non-being,
existence from non-existence—
this is evident!

Thus, when the ruler mobilizes armies and pursues profit, the people grow desirous. When the people desire and cling to squareness, squareness becomes cutting; when cutting is taken for squareness, the crooked advance while the square retreat, loyal ministers suffer its poison, and the myriad people bear its harm. When valuing goods, the people seek; when the people seek and cling to integrity, integrity becomes wounding. When wounding is taken for integrity, the greedy flourish while the upright are ruined, loyal ministers bear its blame, and the myriad people suffer its defeat. When conflict arises, the people grow devious; when the people are devious and cling to straightness, straightness becomes unrestrained. When unrestraint is taken for straightness, the perverse soar while the upright hide, loyal ministers bear its disaster, and the myriad people suffer its ruin. When the ruler covets fame, the people grow false; when the people are false and cling to brilliance, brilliance becomes dazzling. When dazzling is taken for brilliance, great virtue is concealed while petty favors shine, loyal ministers meet their death, and the myriad people endure its calamity.

These acts of bestowal cause goods to flow and emotions to circulate, so that what is called square is no longer square, what is called integrity is no longer integrity, what is called straight is no longer straight, what is called brilliant is no longer brilliant. Names are confounded and realities exchanged; rectitude is lost and virtue perishes. The ruler stands alone while ministers wear two faces, nurturing the ruler’s intent, flattering the ruler’s heart, blocking the ruler’s ears, and obscuring the ruler’s clarity. This is why the state is imperiled and ancestral temples are lost.

Therefore, enlightened kings and sagely rulers alone possess yet do not bestow, alone know yet do not teach, alone are capable yet do not employ. They are square in themselves yet do not impose it, sharp toward the myriad things yet do not claim it, straight in accord with Heaven’s heart yet do not rely on it, their virtue shining across the four seas yet without arrogance. Why is this so?

They abandon fortune to embrace squareness, allowing subordinates to act for the public good. Cutting yet not cutting, they ensure the people do not contend. Affairs resolve themselves, and the myriad things flow freely. None act for good fortune, none act for misfortune. The world is vast and unbound, following no fixed norm. It is not that they do not cut—yet in carving, striking, punishing the proud, and restraining the violent, there are no scars or wounds.

They abandon goods to embrace integrity, allowing the world to find its own balance. Wounding yet not wounding, they ensure people do not quarrel. Greed and rapacity cease, and purity arises naturally. None act to muddy, none act to clarify. Names are not falsely conferred, and realities do not lean or topple. It is not that they do not wound—yet in promoting integrity and beauty, displaying thieves and exposing deceit, there is no concealment.

They abandon conflict to embrace straightness, allowing subordinates to overcome themselves. Unrestrained yet not unrestrained, they ensure the people submit of their own accord. They correct the perverse and quell disorder, transforming excess and rectifying customs. None act for misfortune, none act for fortune. The world is vast and boundless, and the myriad things attain their own fulfillment. It is not that they do not act unrestrained—yet in upholding the upright and extolling the straight, exposing faults and displaying evil, censuring the perverse and eradicating the crooked, illuminating people’s errors, the world is entirely rectified, and movement occurs without sound.

They abandon fame to embrace brilliance, allowing subordinates to assume their proper roles. Dazzling yet not dazzling, they ensure the people clarify themselves.

Neither striving for illumination nor striving for darkness, the world remains in primordial chaos, and the myriad things flourish and grow. Their virtue rivals Heaven, their transformation aligns with the Dao. Not that they do not shine—yet their virtue’s radiance fills the four seas, illuminating the ten thousand things and transforming without form.

Above and below mirror each other, inner and outer correspond; ingress and egress leave no trace, movement and stillness know no gap, like shadow to form, echo to sound. Thus, the Dao of governing the state and the root of nurturing the people begin with frugality. Therefore, enlightened kings and sagely lords diminish their appearance, humble their palaces, abstain from the five flavors, eliminate music and sensuality, feign ignorance in wisdom, and embrace silence in clarity. They adopt formless demeanor, establish invisible martial prowess, fearing others may know them, and conceal themselves in the unfathomable.

Thus, before they act, the world responds; before they command, the myriad people gather; before they wage war, they already possess victory; before they attack, the world submits. Therefore, without toil, the people achieve merit; without contention, they attain their roles; without punishment, the myriad people stand in awe; without subtlety, they receive Heaven’s blessings. Disasters and chaos do not arise, auspicious signs converge, they act without acting yet nothing is left undone, they contend without contending yet nothing is unconquered.

Thus, the ten thousand things merge in profound unity, the world achieves harmony, floating and sinking in accord, attaining resonance with the Dao. It is like an end that becomes a beginning, like disorder that becomes order. Empty yet full, nonexistent yet existent, sparse yet dense, slow yet swift. Without shadow or trace, without root or sign, it resembles primordial chaos, its origins unknown. Alone in knowing, alone in seeing, alone in acting, alone in refraining, its transformations are constant, its accumulations boundless.

Yin and yang separate and unite, contract and expand, tense and relax, obscure and profound, indistinct and silent. Vast as Heaven and Earth, inexhaustible and unfathomable, self-cultivation brings abundance, enabling one to possess a state. Governing people and ordering things, their descendants endure unbroken. For what reason? Because of their frugality.

The Dao of frugality does not bestow or give, cherishing subtlety with restraint. Full yet appearing empty, when its intent is truly communicated, it can endure long. Though its form is small, its spirit is vast, exceeding ten thousandfold. One bears the ten thousand, thus it can rise lightly. Unified with things, it aligns with Heaven’s Dao, deeply rooted and firmly established, dwelling with the divine luminaries. This is what the perfected person embodies and the sage preserves.

**Governing a Great State**

Governing a great state is like frying a small fish. When the Dao is applied to the world, its ghosts lose their numinosity. Not that its ghosts lack numinosity, but their numinosity does not harm people. Not that their numinosity does not harm people, but the sage also does not harm people. When neither harms the other, virtue converges and returns.

**[Annotation]**
When the sun declines, yin arises, dryness gives way to wind, valleys stir slightly, and ocean waves surge greatly—high and low stand in proximity, differing by a hundred fathoms—this is because of their great size. On thousand-fathom cliffs and ten-thousand-zhang precipices, creatures climb them, yet when the cliffs crumble, only mosquitoes, ants, and midges can flutter about, while rhinoceroses, elephants, tigers, and leopards perish—this is because of their great weight.

Fierce winds rage, tearing off roofs and snapping trees, hurling stones and flinging iron, causing mountains and hills to collapse, yet human blood and qi remain unharmed—this is because of their violent magnitude. A draft through a crack does not stir a hair, yet when it strikes a person, it breeds a hundred illnesses and leads to death—this is because of its minute penetration.

A great state is like the Yangtze and the sea, like rhinoceroses and elephants, while virtuous transformation is like fierce winds and drafts. Thus, its blessings cannot arise greatly, its power cannot surge violently, its goodness cannot reside greatly, and its evil cannot perish greatly. If blessings arise greatly, great loss follows; if power surges violently, violent collapse ensues; if goodness resides greatly, great departure follows; if evil perishes greatly, great calamity arrives. How is this known?

Zhuangzi said: One who is hungry and eats doubly, thirsty and drinks doubly, hot and jumps into water, cold and enters fire—though their suffering is relieved, their body will surely die. A mass in the chest cannot be chiseled out, an ailment in the throat cannot be scraped away, parasites on the face cannot be shot, lice on the body cannot be hacked. Why? Because one seeks to eliminate a small affliction yet invites a greater harm.

Thus, when enlightened kings and sagely lords govern a great state, it is as if grasping the most delicate thread, as if channeling the smallest stream. They observe as keenly as discerning autumn down, listen as if to silence itself. They seem absent yet present, seem not so yet so. Like form lingering, like action resting, they dwell in the realm of acting and non-acting, transform within the field of being and non-being. Blessings are subtle, gains are few; words are sparse, prohibitions are rare. They move without form, yet their merit endures across the four seas. Why is this so?

They take the Dao as father, virtue as mother, spirit and clarity as teachers, Great Harmony as companions. Stillness is their constant, simplicity their master. Heaven and earth serve as their model, yin and yang as their pattern. Sun and moon are their standards, the myriad things their outward signs. Adaptive response is their foundation, sincerity and trust their foremost principles. Distinct duties and separate offices proceed in unbroken, profound silence. They draw together the guiding threads, grasp the great essentials, and seek them within themselves.

Thus, the people are like fledglings in the nest, the ruler like a newborn child. Cunning and deceit arise from no cause, artifice and contrivance have no means to emerge. The myriad things are equal and uniform, none overfull or diminished. In harmony and compliance, all things flourish abundantly. Ghosts and spirits mingle with humans, gathering as in a marketplace. Moving by nature, each offers what it possesses. Still as if without a ruler, serene as if without ghosts, all things fully live, all people fulfill their years, none cut short or harmed before their time.

The ruler is not unkind—his virtue extends boundless love, circulating through the six directions without partiality. Ghosts are not without spirit—they drift in vagueness, ride upon the most subtle, traverse all regions, changing with the times. They spiritually complete the myriad things, yet do not harm people. Not that they would not harm people, but with the sage above, aligned with Heaven, humans and things follow in accord, and great transformation flows freely. The wise do not act, strange things do not arise. None strive to be full, none to be overfull. The world is at peace, all things equal and uniform. They neither raise heights nor dig depths. They do not attack metal and stone, nor dam water and springs. People do not wander far, food does not require killing. All in the world may be rewarded, yet nothing can be seen. Plants and trees yellow and then fall; people transform completely and then end.

Thus, what Heaven enfolds, what Earth contains, what the Great One presides over, what Heavenly One leads, what the four seasons return to, what the five phases oversee—ministers and toxins, transformations and movements—each has its proper place and does not encroach upon another. Circulating through the myriad things, none can be harmed.

Therefore, ghosts and spirits govern the yin, sages govern the yang. Those who govern yin destroy the even; those who govern yang destroy the odd. In emptiness and stillness, ghosts and spirits nurture; in subtlety and scarcity, they assist. In excess and fullness, they harm; in overabundance and extremity, they kill. What does not belong to their kind, the sage upholds. Loyalty, trust, compliance, and goodness—the sage befriends them. Boldness, brilliance, and exceptional talent—the sage examines them. Those who create change and generate strangeness—the sage destroys them.

Thus, those who act in yin are encompassed by ghosts and spirits; those who act in yang are controlled by the sage. Only those who act not at all cannot be defeated. With the sage above, the strange cannot arise, deceit cannot emerge. Thus, ghosts with their spirit nurture things in yin, while the sage with the Dao nurtures things in yang. Blessings begin in yin, virtue culminates in yang. Ghosts and spirits bestow their grace, the sage spreads his favor. Together they return to the myriad things, as if by nature itself. Flowing with the Dao, sinking into virtue, they harmonize and unite with the true.

The "Great State" Chapter

A great state is the confluence of all under heaven, the nexus of all under heaven, the female of all under heaven. The female overcomes the male through stillness; the female places herself below through stillness.

Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state, it gains the small state; when a small state humbles itself before a great state, it gains the great state. Therefore, some humble themselves to gain, while others humble themselves to be gained by others.

A great state desires no more than to unite and nurture others; a small state desires no more than to serve and join others. When both attain what they desire, it is fitting for the greater to remain below.

*[Exegesis]*
Heaven and earth arise together, yin and yang emerge as one. The four seasons share a single root, the Five Phases spring from the same source. Sorrow and joy dwell under the same roof; fortune and misfortune enter through the same gate.

Thus, what serves as peace also serves as peril; what serves as peril also serves as peace. What preserves also destroys; what destroys also preserves. How can this be made clear?

The tiger and leopard, with their vast and refined forms, sharp claws and strong teeth, thick hides and ample flesh, luxuriant fur and bright markings, thus subdue all beasts and are themselves subdued by man. Fragrant herbs and blossoming flowers, with their radiant brilliance and sweet scent, delight the common folk yet harm their own roots. The ruler of a great state, with his vast lands and numerous people, exalted power and honored form, towering might and illustrious name, thus expands his neighboring states yet endangers his own person. With the Dao, he stands firm as bedrock, secure as Mount Tai; without the Dao, he teeters like stacked eggs, lighter than a goose feather. When all are weak, he falters first; when all are in chaos, he perishes first. Thus, a great state is the ladder to hegemony and the step to ruin.

Therefore, the ruler of a great state stands alone without peer, his name resounding among the four barriers, three sides forming natural obstacles, mighty rivers converging, all things flowing downward—he becomes the hub of the feudal lords. A storehouse of fertile lands, the threshold of power, the master of authority, he pairs unfathomable strength with strategic chokepoints, vast and rich plains spanning thousands of *li*, treasures and rarities without end. His people bear few corvées, herds of horses and cattle roam freely, boats and carriages number in the tens of thousands, weapons and provisions pile high as hills. Those who dwell there live in peace; those who pass through linger. People thrive like grass and trees, filling mountains and fields. From plowing and sericulture to hunting, yields are double and deep. Thus, all under heaven yearn to submit, generals and ministers seek to ally. With chariots and cavalry striking fiercely, a million armored troops at the ready, he holds both ease and peril, leveraging terrain and advantage. Attacking in accord with heaven, defending in accord with earth, he suspends the lives of others, controls their deaths. Ally with him, and you gain power; betray him, and you lose your ancestral temples. Thus, feudal lords seek his friendship, all under heaven fear him. His virtue suffices to annex, his honor suffices to issue decrees, his might suffices to exalt benevolence, his governance suffices to clarify righteousness, his conquests suffice to expand territory, his acquisitions suffice to enrich. Thus, feudal lords favor him, and generals and ministers profit from him.

From ancient times to the present, the female of the world, through stillness, triumphs over the male—unchanged for a thousand ages, unaltered for ten thousand. Why is this so? By emptiness receiving the full, by non-being responding to being, not deeming itself great, but striving to be small; not exalting itself, but constantly humbling itself. Thus, the enlightened king and sagely lord, in ruling a great state, bestows without expectation, lowers himself without seeking gain. His lands envelop the states of feudal lords, yet he fears nothing; his virtue encompasses their strength, yet he serves all. He humbles himself to align with others’ wishes, leads with loyalty, integrity, sincerity, and trust, precedes officials with virtue. He cedes lands east and west to attract the worthy and talented, urges diligent farming and weaving to praise and accumulate, forges alliances and coalitions to guard against the unforeseen. He opens granaries, scatters wealth and goods, nurtures the elderly, feeds the orphaned and weak, aids the poor and distressed, and honors recluses. He accepts without taking, grants without giving, abides in softness, weakness, simplicity, and non-action.

Though feudal lords may be greedy, base, cruel, and oppressive, arrogant and reliant on force, unwilling to submit or follow, plotting rebellion—still, with the might of civil and martial power, the weight of virtue and authority, he remains still and lowers himself. Then they refine their conduct, mend their ways, cede lands and offer treasures, surrender their lives, and beg to become his vassal states, his fence-wall ministers. In ruling a small and weak state, he acts in accord with the Dao, conducts himself with principle, enriches with boats and carriages, fills with armor and weapons. Loyal, obedient, sincere, and plain, he values simplicity and honors farming. Plowing and weaving are divided, nothing taken from the people. Rulers and subjects harmonize, close as father and son. The lord is like the heart, the people like the body; the state is unified and whole, ready to die together. Rulers and subjects submit to one another, ready to trade with neighbors.

Though the ruler of a great state may bear a multitude of strength, wielding power on the right and virtue on the left, benevolence below, his heart like a starving tiger, his wrath like a surging spring, unwilling to bestow, always desiring to devour—still, by winning heaven’s heart and the people’s favor, with the sincerity of generals and ministers and the aid of neighboring states, he unleashes the enemy of a thousand springs, raises unfathomable might, humbles himself and exhausts his sincerity, risks his life, earnest and devoted. Then, through spiritual resonance and subtle understanding, their hearts release and intentions crumble. Anger shifts, calamity moves, and they pledge allegiance to him.

He who takes from others is vast in form and abundant in power, broad in virtue and heavy in authority—what others covet. He who is taken by others has narrow lands and few people, light power and scant virtue—what others disdain. Thus, without battle, he ruins others’ cities; without attack, he brings down others’ strongholds. His lands expand, his title is exalted, his ancestral temples shine, his merits and virtues flow—this is the great state’s aspiration. Allying with a great state, forming bonds and kinship, when years bring disaster, the great state grieves; when neighboring states face peril, the great state rescues. Bowing beneath one, he rises above ten thousand. His altars are honored, his ancestral temples illustrious, his state wealthy and his troops strong, his people whole and prosperous, his legacy endless—this is the small state’s desire.

Thus, when borders touch and power hangs in balance, the first to lower himself gains, the humble controls the proud, the still conquers the restless. In the posture of greatness, the small lowers itself to gain from the great. Why is this so? The Dao of nature cannot be forcibly attained. Water flows downward, people move toward profit. Abandoning lowliness to take charge, the weak unite as one, striking unexpectedly—this is how the strong and great perish. Thus, the great must lower themselves.

Volume Five (First Proofreading)
The Mystery of the Myriad Things

The Dao is the mystery of the myriad things, the treasure of the good, and what the ungood cannot preserve. Fair words can be traded in the marketplace, and noble conduct can be bestowed upon others. If people are ungood, how can they be cast aside?

Thus, when the Son of Heaven is established and the Three Dukes are appointed, though one may possess a large jade disk preceded by a team of four horses, it is not as good as quietly advancing this Dao.

Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times? It is not said that one seeks and thereby obtains, or that one with transgressions is thereby exempted—yet it is prized throughout the world.

**[Exegesis]**
The growth of a tree begins with its twigs, which depend on its branches; branches depend on its trunk, the trunk on its stem, the stem on its root, and the root on Heaven and Earth, which receive it from the formless.

Flowers and fruit arise from the qi of existence, the qi of existence from the four seasons, the four seasons from yin and yang, and yin and yang from Heaven and Earth, which receive them from the formless.

Thus I know: the Dao, with its formless form and shapeless appearance, opens the void, guides the spirit, harmonizes Heaven and Earth, and pacifies yin and yang. It regulates the four seasons, determines the ten thousand directions, and enables all distinct forms and kinds to attain completion. Transformation and cyclical return are its constant Way, operating without preference or aversion, in great accord with things. The myriad kinds respond to it, each attaining its proper course.

The good obtain it and thereby contract and expand. Serene, tranquil, soft, and weak, they are silent and undifferentiated, kind, gentle, and yielding, moistening and leveling the void. Their greatness and smallness are all-encompassing, their subtlety without form. Profoundly penetrating the ten thousand affairs, they return to the nameless. In cyclical return, the myriad blessings arise of themselves. In movement, they attain their desires; in stillness, they lose their troubles. When above others, their power and virtue naturally shine. Attacking the firm and overcoming the great, none can rival them.

The wicked obtain it and thereby burst forth and expand. Hard and rigid, they are coarse and hasty, arrogant and overflowing in their might, full and strong to the extreme. They endlessly expand their grandeur, their scrutiny glaring and dazzling, their brilliance radiant and resplendent. Yet the strong and great ultimately diminish, and calamity arises of itself. In movement, they lose their desires; in stillness, they incur harm. Their hearts are troubled, their wills diminished, and they revert to normalcy. Their spirit and qi become vexed and hurried, contracting and abandoning expansion. Oppressed and constrained, their words grow humble; restrained, their bodies lower. Pressed by peril, they submit as guests; in anguish, they feign loyalty and trust. They alter their countenance and change their conduct, becoming as the noble. Their crimes are determined, yet they speak of goodness; facing death, they cling to life. Once they submit to Heaven’s decree, their nature and emotions transform. They find peace in poverty and joy in hardship, taking lowliness as their constant state. They revere Heaven and honor spirits, regarding others as kings. Above, they compare to oxen and horses; below, they rank with dogs and sheep. The net of Heaven is cast wide, and nature does not heed them.

Alas! How clear the warning!

The two paths diverge, yet both proceed from the Way;
some advance, some retreat, some endure, some perish.
Thus, words and deeds are the prison of self-cultivation;
timing, precedence, and harmony determine the great mandate.

Therefore, the noble person’s establishment of self
is dim as blindness, silent as deafness,
simple as uncarved wood, plain as raw substance.
Words are concealed within the heart, abiding in profound stillness.
When speech is called for, deep thought precedes it;
utterance emerges like mourning.
Harmonizing with the times, adapting to seasons,
they bring forth others’ good fortune.
In response and deference, their words are direct yet unadorned.
Thus, their words fill the world yet are not excessive;
their influence shakes the four seas yet is not hasty;
they connect with the myriad things yet do not possess them,
and their words move the world so each attains its desire.

In governing the age,
their qi and will plunge into darkness while form and appearance withdraw,
dwelling as if in alarm, their demeanor seeming inadequate.
Vast and boundless, they melt like ice dissolving,
extending when the time is right, submitting when the age demands.
Sharing Heaven’s sorrow, their hearts ache with compassion;
plans fail to unfold, and they turn with the times.
Humble and content, self-diminishing in nurturing virtue,
they delight in lowliness like water, enduring without error.
Lowering themselves again and again,
to the point of utter nothingness—
the world responds, and thus they hold the state.

Why is this so?
Human nature delights in honor and esteem,
and detests lowliness and shame.

To diminish them invites resentment; to enrich them brings joy.
To humble oneself pleases them; to restrain them earns contempt.
This is the universal Dao of past and present, the right principle of the human heart.
The worthy act thus, and petty men do so even more.

Therefore, to honor and embellish words and deeds is to ensure affairs remain free of harm.
How could the ancients who led the people ever abandon this?
The officials of Jie and Zhou could be made compliant and trustworthy;
the soldiers of Qin and Chu could be made obedient and good.
Thus, by winning their hearts, one may possess all under Heaven;
without their favor, even wives and concubines cannot be commanded.

How to prove this is so?
Rank that towers over the world, wealth that encompasses the Four Seas,
unmeasured might and authority, wielding sole power—
these are what men fear.
To rise from common foot-soldier to soaring like a swan or dragon,
to assist the Son of Heaven, propagate the Dao and exalt virtue,
enact all that one possesses, let grace flow to the ten thousand clans,
and glorify one’s ancestors—
these are what men desire.

To use what men fear to seek what men desire,
if one’s words lack beauty and one’s conduct lacks reverence,
though one proffer great jades and precious treasures,
or convey them in carriages drawn by four horses,
the hearts of the worthy will still waver between assent and doubt,
profound sages will remain deeply hidden,
and noble men will not come.

Yet when words and deeds are cultivated within,
one’s spirit and qi overflow without.
Without the toil of four-horse teams or the expense of treasured jades,
scholars throughout the land respond like echoes to the wind.
Heroes and stalwarts gather like spokes to a hub, like bees to their hive.
Beneath the sage’s rule, the court abounds with noble men.

Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Because their words accorded with Heaven and Earth without ceasing,
their conduct aligned with the human heart without reliance.
Their names were achieved yet not displayed,
their deeds were accomplished yet not possessed.
Their nature was spontaneous, not taken as acquisition.
They acted to accord with the Dao, not for themselves.
All things returned to them, and they became stewards of the world.

**Acting Without Acting**

Act without acting,
manage without managing,
savor the tasteless.
Great or small, many or few—
repay resentment with virtue.
Plan for difficulty while it is easy,
achieve greatness in the minute.
Difficult affairs arise from the easy,
great matters arise from the small.
Thus the sage never attempts greatness,
and so accomplishes greatness.

One who makes light promises will surely lack trust;
one who treats matters lightly will surely face many difficulties.
Even the sage regards things as difficult,
and thus ultimately encounters no difficulty.

---

**The Pointer**

The reckoning of spirit and light, the Dao of nature:
non-being does not give birth to being,
being does not give birth to non-being.
Neither non-being nor being gives birth to the realm between.
From this perspective,
sorrow does not give birth to sorrow,
joy does not give birth to joy—
only the absence of sorrow and joy gives birth to sorrow and joy.
Thus, dwelling in misfortune may yield fortune,
dwelling in fortune may yield misfortune.
The master of fortune and misfortune lies in the primal origin.

To act without form, to listen without sound—
without form or sound, one attains profound depth.
Thus, the merit of no-merit is great,
while the merit of merit is small.
The virtue of having virtue is thin,
while the virtue of no-virtue is thick.

Therefore, the sage
does not act for being or non-being,
does not act for death or life,
roams between being and non-being,
dwells between death and life.
Adapting to change and responding to circumstances,
nature is his constant.
Thus, without seeing, he is clear;
without hearing, he is perceptive.
Supporting and stabilizing Heaven and Earth,
adorning the Dao and nourishing the spirit,
guiding the ten thousand things,
governing the state and tending the people,
he strips away emotion and releases intent,
returning together to the original truth.

He does not establish livelihoods or initiate affairs,
does not add benevolence or bestow profit,
teaches what cannot be taught,
guides with non-knowledge.
He severs what the people delight in to accord with their nature,
indulges what they detest to win their hearts.

Exiting the gate of early death,
entering the path of long life,
soaring through the dark and obscure,
wandering in the Great Simplicity,
dim and vast, none know its cause—
profound as twilight, all under Heaven remains at peace.

Savoring the tasteless, examining the formless,
he distinguishes the classes of sameness and difference,
illuminates the conditions of right and wrong.
Acting before there is anything,
stabilizing before there is collapse,
courageous deeds remain unseen,
wise names go uncelebrated.
Fortune does not arise,
misfortune does not take root.

Fortune without fortune arises from silence,
misfortune without misfortune ceases in namelessness.
The ruler is at peace, the people rejoice,
all under Heaven attains great harmony.

Thus, to give birth to calamity and then worry over it,
to cultivate fortune and then seek it,
to slay the ruler and die for it,
to shame the father and avenge it,
to create hardship and then break it,
to incite rebellion and then destroy it,
to summon invaders and then kill them,
to provoke treachery and then punish it—
courageous deeds appear yet oppose Heaven,
wise names arise yet contradict the Dao.

Action that delights the people brings toil and little virtue,
deeds that please the people yield scant favor.
Thus, loyalty and trust decay,
upright affairs vanish,
the natural withdraws in seclusion,
wisdom and cunning soar.
Those who steal merit are exalted,
those who usurp power are conspicuous,
the violent and disorderly profit,
the deceitful and false flourish.
Right and wrong are overturned,
all under Heaven is greatly overturned,
things lose their mandate,
families and states perish.

Therefore, one who excels at eliminating calamity
does not match the greatness of having no calamity at all;
one who initiates affairs to bring order
does not equal the worth of one who remains silent.
Thus, the noble person
acts at the beginning of the unbegun,
rests in the nothingness of nothing,
spreads the Dao and bestows virtue,
transforming in the mysterious.
Anger arises from non-anger,
speech from non-speech,
attack from non-daring,
defense from no beginning.
Might arises from non-martiality,
resentment is repaid before it sprouts,
difficulties are planned while easy,
the root is governed,
the sign is severed before it appears,
preventing it from becoming so.

Affairs are as fine as autumn down,
merit as great as Mount Tai,
achieving greatness in the small,
governing ceaselessly.
Reverent and cautious,
as if beginning, as if new,
not acting on desire,
not seeking convenience,
constantly opposing affairs,
alone guarding the origin.
Growing with the times,
daily advancing without bound,
though one may not wish to be great,
things naturally become so.

Thus, when great calamity is about to arise,
it is like a pernicious wind striking a person.
Before it manifests, caution prevents its coming;
when it lies in the skin and hair, hot compresses remove it;
when it enters the interstitial patterns, fine needles extract it;
when it reaches the organs, a hundred medicines dispel it;
when it penetrates the bone marrow,
even Heaven and Earth cannot grieve it,
nor can creation cure it.

When great affairs are about to arise,
it is like water flowing from a mountain.
Beginning with moisture,
appearing as ripples,
trickling and seeping,
flowing into streams and valleys,
rushing and surging,
floating boats and sweeping stones,
forming rivers and seas,
deep and vast, unfathomable.

Thus, the sage in establishing merit and fame:
subtle, therefore able to be manifest;
obscure, therefore able to be bright;
small, therefore able to be great;
hidden, therefore able to be conspicuous.
Aspiring to be beneath the myriad people,
thus becoming lord and king.
Might shakes the universe,
the four seas all submit.
Hanging by fate, subject to control,
none can withstand.
Virtue parallels Heaven and Earth,
illumination equals the sun and moon.

Thus, one whose words are often assented to
has many affairs yet cannot be trusted;
one whose mind is often changeable
finds it hard to accumulate and cannot be relied upon.
Therefore, the sage
remains silent in heart and unmoved,
silent in speech and unspoken,
silent in gaze and unseeing,
silent in hearing and unhearing.
Moving like Heaven and Earth,
still like spirits,
achieving without acting,
trusted without speaking.
Advancing, none can oppose;
retreating, none can exhaust.
The self has no sliver of worry,
the state has no hair’s breadth of calamity.

Why is this so?
Peril arises from non-peril,
ruin from non-ruin,
clearly perceived alone,
operating in the formless.

The secure is easy to maintain,
the unmanifest easy to plan for,
the fragile easy to break,
the subtle easy to disperse.
Act before it exists,
govern before it disorders.
A tree of arm-span girth
grows from a tender shoot;
a nine-tiered terrace
rises from a basket of earth;
a height of a hundred fathoms
begins beneath one’s feet.
Those who act fail in it,
those who grasp lose it.
Thus the sage acts not and so does not fail,
grasps not and so does not lose.
In their undertakings,
people often fail when near completion.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
and there will be no failed affairs.
Therefore the sage desires not to desire,
values not rare and precious goods;
learns not to learn,
restores what the multitude transgresses;
assists the naturalness of the myriad things,
yet dares not act.

*[Purport:]*
One who is not yet ill is easy to heal;
a state not yet imperiled is easy to plan for;
budding troubles are easy to manage;
minor and weak calamities are easy to worry over.
How to demonstrate this?

Zhuangzi said:
A toy cart unbroken, a child may push it along—yet when it overturns, it tumbles from lofty heights into the ravine, and a thousand men cannot set it right.
An egg unhatched, a finger may rub it smooth—yet when it becomes a soaring swan-goose, it beats its wings and ascends the clouds, and nets and arrows cannot reach it.
A newborn calf, a rope may restrain it—yet when it grows into a bull, nets and snares cannot hold it back.
The tiger seizes all beasts, devours oxen and horses, and blades and halberds cannot oppose it.

Thus the trickle of water, long flowing, becomes a river and sea.
The tiny serpent, if not slain, in time becomes a divine dragon.
Accumulated minute goodness leads to good fortune;
small evil unchecked leads to destruction.

Therefore, when a ruler succeeds to the throne,
harboring no resentment or malice,
his ministers and chancellors are harmonious and united,
the hundred clans submit as guests,
neighboring states trade in peace,
no slanderers or traitors arise,
all is level and unshaken,
above and below are in concord.
At such a time, he guards it without force,
holds it without strength,
acts not, interferes not,
and none can overcome him.

Yet when the state is about to fall into peril,
the myriad people about to face ruin,
calamities about to arise,
budding but not yet manifest—
at such a time, safety or danger lies with oneself, not with others.
One need not be a sage to plan,
nor a warrior to worry;
rectify it from one’s pillow,
and disaster and misfortune vanish.

When the ruler loses the Dao,
his great ministers grow resentful and hostile,
neighboring states cease trade,
the hundred offices decline and fall into disuse,
disasters have already arisen,
and the state is weak and feeble—
at such a time, even if worthy men devise deep strategies,
stir up affairs, and create momentum,
before they act, peril looms,
and without exertion, calamity shatters.

When the ruler loses the proper course,
his great ministers plot in error,
neighboring states bear grudges,
the hundred clans waver,
disasters have already begun,
the root is not yet secure,
treacherous heroes are about to rise,
yet they have not gained support,
some unite but do not bond,
some bond but not firmly—
at such a time, honor the worthy and humble oneself before the multitude,
break open one’s liver and gall,
listen to subtle remonstrance,
seek faults in oneself,
bear no grudge against those who warn of danger,
and strategists and soldiers disperse before they are deployed.

Thus fortune and misfortune arise from the nameless,
survival and ruin emerge from the subtle.
The two intermingle like clouds,
shifting like the howling wind,
bending and stretching like waves,
advancing and retreating in chaos.
One cannot hear them by listening,
cannot see them by looking;
mechanics and cunning cannot manage them,
wisdom and intelligence cannot judge them.

Therefore the sage
transforms with the Dao,
teaches by example,
acts before things exist,
governs before disorder arises.
Without establishing, things find peace of themselves;
without nurturing, things preserve themselves.
In movement, he shares a chamber with fortune;
in stillness, he dwells in a different heaven from misfortune.
Vast and obscure, none behold his origin.
He governs before chaos,
rectifies before collapse.
He shuts the root of treachery,
the source of deceit,
the door of depravity,
the gate of perversity.
Before the sprout stirs,
before form or omen appears,
he severs what has not yet manifested,
eradicates what does not yet exist.
He teaches with non-teaching,
guides with namelessness,
knows with non-knowing,
shapes with formlessness.
Disorder cannot arise,
chaos cannot be born;
under heaven, there is non-action,
and the nature and destiny of things follow their course.

The trees of Mount Tai,
their roots cling to the shade,
their tips reach toward the sun,
branches hanging down, leaves spreading,
flowers and fruit lush and green,
thick enough to embrace,
tall enough to span a hundred fathoms—
they grow from what is not large,
mature through non-action.
A nine-tiered terrace,
vast and broad, rivaling hills and mounds,
a hundred fathoms high,
radiant yet obscure,
piercing the azure sky—
yet it is deemed lowly and small,
not considered lofty or great.

Thus what is made large is not large,
what is made small is not small,
what is made high is not high,
what is made low is not low.
Not large, not small—only then do large and small arise;
not high, not low—only then do high and low arise.
Thus the doer leaves no trace of doing,
the non-doer is the path of doing.

Therefore, those who strive for success fail,
those who seek profit bring harm,
those who pursue life meet death,
those who strive for rise meet ruin.
Grasping what one desires, one loses what one desires;
grasping what one thinks of, one’s thoughts slip away;
grasping one’s body, one’s body perishes;
grasping one’s spirit, one’s spirit retreats.

Thus the sage
acts without acting to give life to the myriad things,
grasps without grasping to control desires,
just as the craftsman builds a high terrace,
or heaven and earth give birth to giant trees—
naturally, of themselves.

The Dao and virtue do not envy,
spirit and clarity do not harm,
harmony penetrates all,
the great primordial does not overcome.
Survival and ruin follow of themselves,
good fortune and misfortune are self-attained.

When people face ruin and failure,
they abandon spontaneity and rely on knowledge and force,
discard the reverse and dwell in the overturned.
Why? Because they seek what they seek and desire what they desire.

If one can be as cautious at the end as at the beginning,
do what one does not desire,
abide where one does not dwell,
act before the origin,
return before the beginning,
act as if not acting,
possess as if not possessing—
though it may seem unaccomplished,
things follow their nature.

Those who disturb the spirit and muddy the essence,
whose keen hearing and sharp sight do not penetrate,
who in movement lose what they seek,
in stillness forfeit what they desire—
are ensnared by wealth and learning.
Only those who refine their emotions and alter their nature,
transform their minds and intentions,
find peace in desireless desire,
engage in effortless effort—
attain the Dao and virtue.

Thus long for the Dao as one longs for kin,
loathe wealth as one loathes losing one’s body.
Ponder the thought of non-thought,
seek the seeking of non-seeking.
Be clear and all-pervading,
learn to be unknowing;
skillfully carve the myriad things,
learn to be incapable.
Reverse the pursuits of the multitude,
return to emptiness and nothingness.
Desire non-desire to reach the profound void,
learn non-learning to plumb the ultimate mystery.
Comprehend what others cannot fathom,
exhaust what others cannot measure,
achieve what others cannot do,
attain what others cannot obtain.

The mind’s intent is profoundly obscure,
the body’s appearance serene and harmonious.
Lying down, like a corpse;
standing, like a withered tree.

Neither think nor ponder,
as if knowing nothing,
let things be natural,
allow affairs to unfold as affairs.

Empty, still, and serene,
the body engages in nothing,
the myriad things in disarray,
each in its proper place.

Lofty as a towering peak,
placid as a vast banner,
actions and inactions,
ever contrary to things—
the myriad things respond,
thus achieving depth and distance.

The great canopy of heaven covers all,
revolving with the divine,
aiding heaven and assisting earth,
daring not to produce goodness.

**Those Skilled in the Dao**

The ancients skilled in the Dao
did not enlighten the people,
but sought to make them ignorant.
The people are difficult to govern
because of their knowledge.
To govern the state with wisdom
is the state’s bane;
not to govern the state with wisdom
is the state’s blessing.
Knowing these two is also a model.
Always knowing the model
is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep and far-reaching,
contrary to things,
yet attaining great compliance.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao and its numinous clarity,
the pure and turbid, the Great Harmony—
heaven and earth, the myriad things,
like branches and roots.
These follow one another,
qi-transformations linked in continuity,
reversal and compliance, prosperity and decline,
aligned with fortune and misfortune.
The intent of the Dao
is the mind of heaven and earth,
delighting in life and rest,
abhorring killing and harm.
Thus the sage is commanded
to be king of the myriad things.
Benefit them, and receive their blessings;
do not benefit them, and incur their dread.
The sage, greatly fearful
of calamity after death,
traces the source deeply—
nothing surpasses spontaneity.
The path of spontaneity
lies in formlessness.
How to clarify this?
Zhuangzi said:
Heaven and earth do not know
what the Dao and virtue do,
thus they can be so;
the myriad things do not perceive
how heaven and earth sustain them,
thus they endure;
the people do not recognize
what the ruler pursues,
thus they are at peace;
the four limbs and nine orifices
do not comprehend
what the mind guides,
thus they remain whole.
The myriad things having a lord
is like the body having a mind.
What comes before or after the mind in the body?
Flowing through blood and vessels,
it is present everywhere;
above and below, within and without,
there is nothing it does not pervade.
Moving with diverse affairs,
empty yet containing spirit,
balanced within and without,
thus it preserves wholeness.

Thus the emperors of old,
who ordered the Dao, recorded numinous clarity,
embraced the pure and turbid, and led the Great Harmony,
did not act from innate knowledge to initiate affairs,
open the age, or guide customs,
nor did they strive to enlighten the people.
They sought to obscure the people’s ears and eyes,
block the people’s minds,
preventing them from knowing,
and returning them to spontaneity.
Thus they placed the people in brightness
while dwelling themselves in primal obscurity.
They taught with non-teaching,
guided with formlessness.
Filial piety and brotherly love were not displayed,
benevolence and righteousness were not manifest.
The lord-king had no glory,
the wise had no fame.
The teaching of no-teaching
pervaded the four seas,
the action of non-action
reached the eight directions.
Movement aligned with heaven and earth,
stillness shared the bearing of Dao and virtue.
The myriad things flourished together,
each knowing its place,
names and realities arose,
each knowing its proper role.
Harmonious qi flowed,
the world was like an innocent child—
without knowledge, without desire,
without affairs, without merit.
Minds like wood and earth,
intent like dead ashes,
unseeing of sameness and difference,
unaware of fortune and misfortune.
Thus the people were easy to govern,
and the world could be at peace.

Therefore,
peace is what the people benefit from;
life is what the people turn to.
The reason people abandon peace and life,
becoming difficult to govern,
is their knowledge.
When the people know, desires arise;
when desires arise, affairs begin;
when affairs begin, merit and fame emerge;
when merit and fame emerge, strife and contention arise;
when strife and contention arise, great villainy is born;
when great villainy is born, governance becomes difficult.
Thus to govern the state with knowledge
is to let the world’s cleverness and craftiness
flourish with deceit,
rare treasures appear,
and endless cravings proliferate.
Extravagance and excess know no end,
deviance and crookedness spread,
the powerful and eminent contend,
valleys and streams acquire different names,
and great disasters arise.
Ministers delude their lords,
children confuse their fathers,
calling white black,
treating absence as presence,
names change while realities differ,
and coercion and killing begin.
In chaos, there is no peace;
in ease, there is no preservation.
Armies mobilize lightly,
the realm turns against itself,
the dead numberless,
blood flowing like rivers.
Grief, sorrow, resentment, and hatred
move the august heavens,
stars scatter, the sun and moon lose their light,
yin and yang fall out of order,
the myriad things perish,
mountains wither, valleys dry,
the land lies barren for thousands of miles,
the world is impoverished,
even to the point of cannibalism.
This is not heaven’s fault,
but the fault of those above
who prize wisdom and ability
and instruct the people.

Abandoning cunning and skill,
profound virtue and simplicity remain.
Knowing alone, pondering alone,
not seeing what is desired,
following the people’s hearts,
blocking their ears and eyes.
Not savoring the five flavors,
not wearing the five colors,
the lord like heaven and earth,
the people like grass and trees.
Dwelling in caves, at ease in valleys,
drinking water, eating herbs,
not seeking the five grains.
Knowing mother but not father,
unaware of clans.
Muddled and simple,
not distinguishing east from west.

Men and women feel no affection,
father and son feel no love.
They value neither wood nor stone,
nor treasure gold or jade.
Growing in thickets, dwelling together,
the world shares one heart,
the eight directions share one will,
the nine provinces share one custom.
Moths do not arise,
venomous beasts do not appear,
divine dragons dwell with men,
unicorns and phoenixes roam the courtyards.
Auspicious winds swirl,
sweet springs flow gently,
sweet dew spreads thickly,
crimson grasses flourish,
fine grains grow lush,
and the myriad things live long.
This is not heaven’s blessing,
but because the lord knows not knowing,
and names the nameless.

Thus,
seeing wisdom as folly aligns with the Dao;
knowing folly as wisdom shares the Dao’s intent.
Governance and teaching proceed from this,
bringing either harm or benefit.
Discerning harm and benefit,
great peace arrives of itself;
discerning benefit and harm,
the myriad things right themselves.

Therefore,
the recognition of folly and wisdom
overcomes all things.
Heaven is clear, earth is tranquil,
forming a hidden blessing,
unseen by all generations—
this is called profound virtue.

Profound virtue runs deep,
beyond measure or fathoming;
it stretches far,
beyond limit or end.
It moves contrary to things,
and none can overcome it.
Profound virtue’s influence
pervades and transforms,
elusive and formless,
reversing the concerns of things.
Harmonizing with the Dao and virtue,
it guides spirits and luminaries,
embraces the myriad states,
and encompasses all directions.
Beyond the six directions,
within the finest hair’s breadth,
none fail to be covered by its virtue,
enveloped in its benevolence,
preserving their nature and life,
fulfilling their heaven-appointed years,
and safeguarding their natural state!

The Rivers and Seas

The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
is because they lie low—
thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, the sage,
wishing to be above the people,
speaks humbly to them;
wishing to lead the people,
places himself behind them.

Thus, though above the people, they do not burden them;
though before the people, they do no harm.
The world delights to exalt them, never wearying.
Not through contention—
thus none in the world can contend with them.

【*Direct Interpretation*】:
The Dao does not give birth to the myriad things, yet things arise of themselves;
Heaven and Earth do not contain the host of kinds, yet kinds entrust themselves of themselves.
The things of nature do not seek to be kings, yet things make kings of themselves.
Thus, though Heaven and Earth are boundless, the Dao reigns over them;
though the host of yang blazes bright, the Heavenly King reigns over it;
though yin qi flows deep, Earth reigns over it;
though the naked dwell in caves, the sage reigns over them;
though the feathered soar in emptiness, the divine phoenix reigns over them;
though the furred tread the earth, the qilin reigns over them;
though the scaled dwell in water, the divine dragon reigns over them;
though the shelled abide in marshes, the numinous tortoise reigns over them;
though the hundred streams flow side by side, the rivers and seas reign over them.
These nine kings do not rule as lords of things, yet things return to them of themselves;
they possess no models or standards, yet things govern themselves of themselves;
they practice no benevolence or righteousness, yet things attach themselves of themselves;
they employ no wisdom or force, yet things stand in awe of themselves.
Why is this so?
Embodying the Dao and uniting with harmony, they take nothing as a thing—
yet things transform themselves thereby.

Thus, the kingship of rivers and seas does not rely on accumulating virtuous governance,
piling up benevolent love, flowing with numinous clarity, or bestowing favors to win them over;
nor does it depend on exalting ritual and righteousness, broadening deference,
adorning wisdom and cunning, or displaying skill and ability to please them;
nor does it arise from strange conduct or change, raising power or establishing might,
displaying martial prowess, weighing lives or accumulating affairs to control them.
Rather, by dwelling in stillness and lowliness, emptying themselves to await them,
practicing non-action and seeking nothing—
the hundred streams come of themselves.

The hundred streams do not hear of the sea’s beauty or receive its transformative virtue and return in admiration;
nor are they constrained by teachings, bound by boundaries, or divided into east and west to hasten toward it.
Yet waters penetrate metal and strike stone, bore through cliffs and breach mountains,
race across hills and mounds to follow the rivers and seas—
none turn back.
Form accords with nature, and affairs proceed naturally.

From this we see: how great is the Dao of humility and diminution!
A hundred harms cannot wound it; wisdom and force cannot seize it.
Uncontending, it is strong; unthreatening, it is martial.
Silent and inactive, it bargains with the myriad things.

Valleys, though lowly, do not strive for east or west—
thus they reach far without exhaustion.
Rivers and seas, though below, do not claim vastness—
thus they reign without ceasing.

Therefore, the enlightened king and sage lord, wishing to exalt the people,
employs the nature of spontaneity and the grace of abundant virtue,
holding humble words and reverent demeanor, equaling the common folk.
He regards his body as earth and serves the people as heaven,
radiant in solitary knowing yet unfathomable,
towering in solitary ability yet unsearchable,
profound in insight and vast in understanding yet unobstructed,
keen in hearing and bright in vision yet unblocked.

Not using things to serve himself, he instead follows the people.
Thus, the people tread upon him as earth and entrust themselves to him as to a spirit.
Though ever above the people, he matches heaven in ruling the land.
Wishing to precede others, he dwells in humble honor, wields supreme dignity,
enjoys long life and enduring vision, delighting without peril.
Thus, he sets aside personal aims and self-regard to pacify the myriad people.
His body labors while the people rest; he places himself behind while the people go before.
Above, yet the people live; before, yet the people are at peace.

The people live—thus they bear him without feeling burdened;
the people are at peace—thus they follow him without resentment.
Therefore, the world exalts and uplifts him, draws him forward,
rejoicing without weariness, delighting without surfeit.

Thus, the sage’s kingship does not seek the people—the people seek him;
it does not benefit the people—the people benefit from it;
it does not exalt the people—the people exalt it;
it does not precede the people—the people precede it.
Thus, he can exhaust decay and penetrate change,
rescue decline and rectify disorder, reaching Great Peace.
Above, he matches the Dao and virtue; below, he extends to the numinous.
Vast and boundless, embracing the dark and obscure,
he gallops through Heaven and Earth, courses through yin and yang.

Why is this so?
By relinquishing personal intent and placing himself after others.

Thus, the virtue of non-contention relies on the strength of others,
transforming with the Dao, exhausting the limits with the spirit.
Only those who abandon cunning can follow its principle.

Therefore, the kingly enterprise arises naturally—
it cannot be rashly initiated.
Attaining it, one preserves the fullness of life; holding it, one maintains its pattern.
The sage’s wisdom has its nature; governance has its Dao.
Lose its pattern, and the kingly enterprise fails;
lose its Dao, and nature and emotion lose their measure.

Thus, the sage trusts the Dao, not himself;
follows the Dao, not his heart.
He acts not for himself but first for others;
takes nothing from the world—
thus the world contends to be his subject.

**The World Says of Me**

The world says of me: "Vast, yet seemingly unworthy."
Only because I am vast do I seem unworthy.
Were I worthy, I would long since have been small.

I possess three treasures, which I hold and preserve:
The first is compassion,
The second is frugality,
The third is not daring to be first in the world.

Compassionate, thus able to be brave;
Frugal, thus able to be expansive;
Not daring to be first in the world, thus able to become the chief of all vessels.

Now, to abandon compassion yet claim bravery,
To abandon frugality yet claim expansiveness,
To abandon humility yet claim precedence—
This is death.

For with compassion, in battle one wins; in defense, one stands firm.
Heaven will save those it favors, shielding them with compassion.

The skilled warrior is not martial,
The skilled fighter is not enraged,
The skilled conqueror does not contend,
The skilled leader places himself below others.
This is called the virtue of non-contention, relying on the strength of others—
This is called aligning with the ancient ultimate of Heaven.

**[Exegesis]**
Things may be alike yet different,
Different yet alike,
Seemingly wrong yet right,
Seemingly right yet wrong.
This is why the noble person knows no calamity,
While the common world is beset by sorrow and grief.

How to demonstrate this?
Zhuangzi says:
The rising and setting of the sun and moon share the same light,
The life and death of humans share the same form,
The divisions of spring and autumn share the same benefit,
The profound sage and the rustic share the same appearance,
The enlightened and the obstructed share the same affairs,
The Daoist and the infant share the same achievement.

In all these cases,
Internally distinct yet externally alike—
Without a sage, none can discern it.
Thus, the world is mired in doubt,
Dazzled by confusion, entangled in false constructions,
Ensnared in the tangle of right and wrong.
Thus, the sage seems unworthy.

Why is this so?
Those who attain the Dao appear absent without yet abide within,
Study transforms their dispositions,
Action governs the self.
Substantial yet seemingly empty,
Vast and obscure, as if without purpose.
Their bearing is unrefined, their speech halting,
Their appearance plain and coarse.
Their emotions reach the void,
Their nature flows through non-being,
Serene and inactive, as if without destination.
They shun fame and flee power,
Rising and resting with the spirit,
Grasping the Dao and treading harmony—
No thing remains unordered.
They do not conform to worldly customs,
Opposing heaven and earth.
The multitude, steeped in deceit,
Regard uprightness as shameful;
Divergent paths and differing aims
Are called afflictions.

The petty person is not thus:
With broad learning and vast knowledge,
They angle for wisdom and renown;
With extraordinary conduct and conspicuous merit,
They cast doubt on the humane and worthy.
They deceive the age and govern the vulgar,
Adorning their words and embellishing their appearance;
Bowing low in flattery,
They curry favor and feign kindness;
Anticipating desires and complying with intentions,
They win the hearts of the masses.
Factions form in secret alliances,
Many harboring malice.
They toil little yet receive great emoluments,
Achieve little yet hold lofty ranks;
The state is impoverished while their households prosper,
The ruler is diminished while they themselves are exalted.
Wielding power, they incite change,
Seizing authority in times of ascendancy—
Their names resound in glory,
Shaking even distant lands.
Arrogant and extravagant, violent and rebellious,
They indulge without restraint,
Humbling themselves to follow desires,
Seizing by force where their passions clash.
In action, they destroy lives;
In stillness, they breed corruption.
Their gaze wounds all things,
Their words harm the people.
At such times, these are the ones the vulgar esteem,
The ones the world calls worthy.

Yet such as these are abandoned by the Dao,
Forsaken by spirit and illumination,
Detested by heaven and earth,
Loathed by yin and yang.
No kindred being draws near,
No people attach to them.
In motion, nothing reaches completion;
In stillness, nothing is attained.
Alive, they bring calamity;
Dead, they bring rejoicing.
The deluded masses,
Led astray by one another,
Gain little yet persist long in their ways.

Those who attain the Dao are not thus:
Their bodies embody emptiness and accumulate compassion,
They regard all things as themselves.
They restrain their forms and refine their bearing,
Returning to the subtle and minute.
Profoundly silent, they remain behind,
Never taking precedence over things.
They harmonize with principle,
Responding to nature’s spontaneity.
Their movements and stillness oppose the multitude,
Their comings and goings through different gates.
Not using courage to be courageous,
Thus without anger, the world stands in awe;
Not using breadth to be broad,
Thus without bestowing, the world comes to them;
Not using precedence to be first,
Thus without speaking, the world endures.

Therefore:
Emerging in compassion, entering in courage,
Emerging in frugality, entering in breadth,
Releasing the later to grasp the earlier,
Reversing harmony and opposing the spirit,
Acting contrary to nature—
Fortune withdraws,
Calamity draws near.
The great mandate is severed,
Spirit and qi disperse,
Heaven and earth cannot bring stability,
The Dao and virtue cannot abide.
Facing death, they remain unaware,
Resenting fate and blaming heaven.
Not that fate is meager,
Nor that others are predatory—
They indulged in arrogance and reveled in power,
Abandoning the Dao to exalt force.

Compassion as conduct
Is profoundly harmonious and true.
In action, it gains human strength;
In stillness, it aligns with heaven’s heart.
Humble and yielding, it weakens the small,
Yet presides over the ten thousand things.
It rectifies the age and saves the vulgar,
Harmonizing heaven and humanity.
In battle, it cannot be defeated;
In defense, it cannot be overthrown.
Why is this so?
Heaven and earth arise together,
Their transformations boundless.
On the day of battle,
The earth trembles,
Heaven quakes.
Heaven sends down omens,
The earth brings forth blind winds,
Ghosts and spirits appear,
Calamities arise for the enemy.
Protecting our generals and ministers,
Aiding our people,
Enraging our soldiers,
Extending to all living things.
Oxen snap their yokes,
Horses break their tethers,
Birds beat their wings in flight,
Beasts crouch and crawl.
Tigers and rhinoceroses may be fought,
Raptors may be led—
The enemy, struck with terror,
Lies in ambush to receive our weapons.

Thus the worthy advisor and victorious general
In establishing themselves
Are neither strong nor great,
Neither rigid nor pliant,
Balancing firmness and weakness, revering martial prowess—
The enemy dissolves at their approach.
In battle, they diminish the heart and discard external intent,
Exalting bodily harmony and peace.
Their words are modest, their stance deferential,
Their movements and stillness attuned to heaven.
They do not provoke anger with resentment,
Nor incite war with force.
To vanquish the enemy,
They often act in reverse.
Their strategies move unseen,
Seizing the enemy’s spirit.
Their actions exploit what the enemy possesses,
Their changes follow what the enemy does,
Reversing and overturning,
To deploy the extraordinary.
Thus they make the enemy’s deviance their rectitude,
The enemy’s words their listening,
The enemy’s anger their joy,
The enemy’s movement their stillness.
They open what the enemy deems advantageous,
To benefit their own fate.
In employing others, they humble themselves in speech,
Displaying profit,
Presenting sincerity,
Letting others come of their own accord.
Thus without contention or seeking,
They win the people’s favor,
Align with the people’s hearts,
Grasping their essential taboos—
The enemy’s ranks scatter,
While their own unite.
The enemy cannot but perish,
While they cannot but endure.

At such times,
The Dao is their origin,
Virtue their beginning,
Spirit and illumination their warp,
Great harmony their weft.
Purity and turbidity their household,
The ten thousand things their children,
The three luminaries their aides,
The four seasons their assistants.
Stillness is the root of things,
Movement the head of transformation.
All kinds of beings rely on them,
Without calamity or fault.
Virtue equals heaven,
Enduring without peril.
From ancient times to the present,
The Dao of sages and the wise,
The cycles of change and renewal,
From heaven to the throne—
All proceed from this.

**Scroll Six (First Proofreading) – On the Use of Arms**

There is a saying in warfare: "I dare not act as host but as guest, dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot." This is called marching without formation, striking without arms, seizing without weapons, and contending without an enemy. No misfortune is greater than underestimating the enemy; underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasure.

**Annotation [Interpretation]:** The Dao encompasses all, yet what it possesses does not act. Embracing harmony and submitting to weakness, it enfolds great might. It nurtures all beings, none can defy it; without form or image, it is the teacher of the ten thousand things. Those who attain it find peace; those who lose it face peril. Heaven and earth embody it, enduring without decline.

How can this be verified? Zhuangzi said: "If there is yin but no yang, the ten thousand things will not be born; if there is yang but no yin, the ten thousand things will not be completed." From this, we see: with might but no virtue, the people cannot be governed; with virtue but no might, the ancestral temple will surely collapse. Without virtue or might, it is called courting disaster—when fate turns and times change, one’s body perishes and the state falls.

Thus, the ruler is the heart and mind of the state; arms are the state’s majestic spirit. Between heaven and earth, the myriad states arise together. Great and small, foolish and wise—all aspire to be lords. Only when wisdom is exhausted do they submit; only when strength is spent do they yield. It is not that they have surplus strength and willingly kneel to serve as subjects.

Therefore, enlightened kings and sage rulers emulate the Dao and follow heaven. They take clarity and stillness as their foundation, harmony and compliance as their norm. They respond to circumstances as their beginning, sincerity and trust as their essence, names and realities as their discipline, rewards and punishments as their framework. To the left, virtue; to the right, might—thus they meet misfortune. The world looks up to their rule, none can harm them. Thus, the state is preserved and the people kept whole.

Virtue and arms are like heaven and earth, yin and yang. Might and virtue, civil and martial—these are the inner and outer, corresponding in balance. They dwell in the profound realm, employed only when unavoidable.

When a ruler loses the Dao and delights in war, he harms himself. Proper affairs are neglected, while perverse ones arise. The strong grow arrogant and extravagant; discipline collapses and order unravels. Palaces are carved and adorned, dogs and horses lavishly decorated. Lofty towers and vast parks are built, while lewdness and indulgence follow. Loyal remonstrance is butchered, while favored beauties are exalted. Ancestral temples are treated with disdain, uncles and elders are deceived and humiliated. The cruel and violent oppress the orphaned and young. They rebel against heaven and earth, punish yin and yang, deface virtue and the Dao, shatter the gods and spirits. Harmony dissolves into turbidity, transformation ceases to flow. Winter thunders, summer frosts—all things wither and perish. Strife and conflict erupt, schemes turn ill-omened. Great states tremble in fear, small states flee in panic. The old and weak scatter, weeping as they go. The world seethes with resentment, the people long for arms. They rise together, and I follow behind.

Why is this so? Only because their ancestors possessed the virtue of the gods, which communicated with heaven and earth, and the toil of sagely wisdom, which benefited the people. Thus, they received the tally and cinnabar script, were granted land and surname, and were enfeoffed as lords. Their glory illuminated their forebears, their legacy flowed to their descendants. This was the heart of heaven and earth, the achievement of ten thousand generations.

Yet those who inherit their position do not strive to humble themselves, refine their conduct, temper their essence, and cultivate virtue to honor their predecessors. Instead, they dismiss minor good and indulge minor evil. Day by day, they wane; month by month, they decline. The ancestral temple crumbles, the state becomes a wasteland. Their kin scatter, left with no refuge. The spirits of the dead wander, homeless.

Alas! Is this not grievous?

Thus, I exhort my valiant warriors and address my officers and soldiers: roll up your armor, lay down your weapons, and allow yourselves respite. Let the weariness of service shift to a change of heart; seize this chance to repent, reform, and alter your bearing and principles. Those who depart and do not return become brigands of the realm, driving the common folk to utter destitution, exhausting their wealth and strength. The sorrows of the land grow daily.

Heaven sends down its response, and calamity gathers upon their state. Though one might wish to spare them, it cannot be. Heaven and humanity are of one mind—I cannot prevail against them. Thus, affairs may proceed, yet the spirits oppose; the body advances, but the will returns. Form betrays my intent, and events turn against me. I grieve for the ancient sages and lament for the myriad people. They have committed no offense against heaven—why do they suffer this fate? Though it may seem sudden, the lives of the people rest upon the blade.

Issue commands and renew decrees, enforcing them with sincerity and trust. Reward those who submit first; harm those who submit late. Those who yield in small matters gain advantage; those who yield in great matters prosper. Destroy a town, and be ennobled; surrender a city, and be enfeoffed. If a city does not fall, do not mourn what is not yet lost. Exempt the guilty, appoint the capable, care for the old and weak, and bury the dead. Let virtue and grace soak through, let kindness and love flow freely. Compassion and benevolence bind hearts, and the sentiments of the multitude flourish.

Acting in silence, the spirit and qi commune. The three armies and I become of one mind; traitors serve me, thieves work for me. They teach me their strategies and inform me of the terrain. Utilizing what they possess, extraordinary transformations unfold. Laws are not harsh, perilous passes become empty. Heaven and humanity align, and victory emerges as if divine. No enemy remains ahead, no stratagem is lost. Though the foe may be numerous, they are bound to me. When two armies face each other, the front seems devoid of men.

Though the battle may be flawless, the enemy must not be taken lightly. To underestimate the enemy breeds treachery, loses opportunities, and forfeits advantage. Fortune departs, and disaster arrives—this is the affliction of heaven. Therefore, though one may gain heaven’s protection and the people’s aid, still guard it with vigilance, hold it with awe. Exploit peril and seize emptiness; encamp with preparedness. Rest where it is advantageous, and always rely on water and pasture. Fill gaps, block evils, and confront the enemy. Transform without form, strike without sign. Victory shifts endlessly, and success in battle knows no bounds. Profound and subtle, transformations have no beginning.

Even those closest to me do not know my actions. How can the enemy’s knowledge and strength compare to mine? Thus, those at home live in peace and joy; those in the army rejoice with gladness. People harbor utmost sincerity, as if serving their own children. Leaving home and crossing borders, they gather like crowds at a marketplace. They till diligently and weave with effort, resting late and rising early. They contribute extraordinary goods in orderly ranks, daring not to keep anything for themselves, supplying the troops as if serving their parents.

Weighing advantages and contending for victory, the enemy does not rise. Before battle, the realm is set right; without attack, the feudal lords submit. Beneath the covering of heaven and earth, within the light of sun and moon, all is vast and boundless—each rests in their own land. Why is this so? Compassion and sorrow move the heart, aligning with the will of heaven. I dare not act on my own.

""

My words are exceedingly easy to know, exceedingly easy to practice.
Yet under heaven none can know them, none can practice them.
Words have their ancestral source, affairs have their sovereign ruler.
Only my lack of knowledge makes them not know me.
Those who know me are few—thus I am noble.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade within.

**Exegesis:**
What moves things to act naturally without form or sound is the Dao and the numinous;
what moves things to act naturally with form and sound is heaven and earth.
The numinous Dao flows boundlessly in transformation;
heaven and earth silently proclaim.
Flowing without ceasing in transformation,
silent yet proclaiming all—
numinous qi is transmitted,
resonance reciprocated.
Returning to merge with the void,
subtle and wondrous,
it reverts to spontaneity, guiding all without exception.

Thus, words that speak of words are but instruments of spontaneity;
acts that act upon acts are the reckoning of lost authenticity.
Non-action and wordlessness are the perfection of achievement and the essence of enduring presence.
Therefore the sage speaks the word that is no-word,
acts the act that is no-act.
Speaking to end speech,
acting to cease action.
The Dao of ending speech dispels mind and intention;
the art of ceasing action dispels human effort and cunning.
Feigning foolishness and simplicity,
without knowledge, without desire.
Without desire, one is still;
still, one is empty;
empty, one is replete;
replete, one is numinous.
In movement, return to primordial simplicity;
in stillness, return to spontaneity.
Preserve the body, secure the state,
wealth and honor without peril,
all beings attain their aspirations—
thus enduring forever.
These are words easy to know and affairs easy to practice,
yet under heaven none can know them, none can practice them.

Why is this so?
Rulers of the age love cunning,
striving to follow their own hearts.
They do not perceive the great Dao,
do not recognize spontaneity.
They take acting as the act,
take speaking as the word.
They stifle knowledge to generate affairs,
rushing toward what they deem secure,
gradually forming custom—
yet in the end, they are beset by calamity.
Their natures change, their emotions shift,
deeply deluded, far astray.
Essence grows turbid, spirit disturbed,
outwardly replete, inwardly hollow.
Forced silence breeds fault;
forced stillness breeds peril.
Thus, they look but do not see,
are told but do not hear—
not out of envy,
but because they deem it untrue.

The sage’s words take spontaneity as their source,
the numinous as their origin.
They dwell in the opposite,
in the space between silence and speech,
subtle and wondrous,
reverting to spontaneity.
Luminous yet as if unseen,
attentive yet as if unhearing,
penetrating yet seeming blocked,
pervasive yet seeming exhausted.
Their affairs begin in spontaneity,
flow into the numinous,
always abiding in harmony,
in the space between action and inaction.
Pure, still, soft, and weak,
their movements are minute and fine.
Simple, yielding, diminishing,
they return to non-action.
Emptiness and nothingness align with the Dao;
tranquility and indifference nurture life.
Timely harmony secures the state;
mysterious teachings cultivate the people.
Nourish with desirelessness,
guide with spontaneity,
bestow the bounty of heaven and earth,
grant the gifts of mountains and rivers.
Enrich with years,
honor with embodied presence,
assure with freedom from care,
pacify with freedom from peril.
What desirelessness cannot obtain,
what joylessness does not contain—
the people seem without a lord,
the lord seems without people.
Discarding knowledge and effort,
relying on the Dao and leaning on heaven,
the myriad states harmonize,
uniting under one ruler.
This is the flourishing of affairs and the prosperity of enterprise,
yet under heaven they call it untrue.

That the age does not know me
is not because my Dao is too small to be known,
nor because my affairs are too meager to be practiced.
Nor is it because the world delights in failure and detests success,
rejoices in misfortune and takes pleasure in calamity,
and thus deliberately refuses to follow me.
Rather, their nature is opposite to mine,
their emotions and desires differ from mine.
Intelligence is ensnared by emotion and desire,
and they drown their entire lives in what they have heard.
Numinous qi does not affirm me,
their hearts and minds do not assent.
Thus, their vision cannot see me,
their hearing cannot hear me.

Therefore, profound words are met with slander when they return,
far-reaching conduct is met with defamation.
The clarity of solitary vision is not employed in the world;
the acuity of solitary hearing is shamed by the people.
Affairs that accord with the numinous are not accepted by custom;
achievements that match heaven and earth do not please the masses.

Those who expound the ultimate discourse and great words
sum up a hundred transformations,
comprehend ten thousand directions,
discerning within the minutest fraction,
illuminating beyond the vast and indistinct.
All-encompassing, without gap,
they return to the boundless obscurity—
this is what scholars of petty concerns cannot hear,
what those of limited scope cannot attain.

The great swan soars high,
galloping all day,
yet knows nothing beyond the cosmos.
Those who establish laws and adhere to teachings,
who study for years and debate for a lifetime,
yet do not comprehend the greatness of virtue and the Dao—
how much less can those who cling to the doctrines of the vulgar world,
who never glimpse the essence of the great principle,
be expected to understand?

Thus, the contempt of the common crowd
is precisely what those who attain the Dao alone uphold.
Therefore the sage,
though knowing, does not act;
though capable, does not employ his skill.
Though benevolent and righteous, he does not make it his banner;
though penetrating and accomplished, he does not claim it as his name.
Though firm and strong, he does not display it;
though lofty and great, he does not take it as his glory.
His words cannot be heard,
his movements cannot be seen.
His heart is like rivers and seas,
his aspirations like the azure heavens.
He abandons action to establish the Dao,
diminishes goodness to enrich his nature.
Serene and boundless,
none can fathom him;
radiant and luminous,
none perceive his essence.
Subdued and silent,
solemn and solitary,
he values the inner and belittles the outer,
humbling himself and debasing his name.
Leaving the crowd, departing from custom,
he makes the Dao his constant companion.

**Chapter: Knowing Without Knowing**
To know without knowing is supreme;
to not know yet claim knowledge is a flaw.
Only by regarding the flaw as a flaw
can one be without flaw.
The sage is without flaw
because he regards the flaw as a flaw—
thus he is without flaw.

**Exegesis:**
The teaching of the Dao and virtue is naturalness itself.
The verification of naturalness lies in resonance and reflection.
All things possess form and sound;
all choices yield resonance and reflection—
this is not limited to the myriad things alone.
When form moves, it does not generate form but shadow;
when sound moves, it does not generate sound but echo.
The non-existent does not generate the non-existent but the existent;
the inverted does not generate the inverted but the reverse.
Thus, the Daoist governs through non-action,
while the learned disturb through busyness.
Infants thrive through unknowing;
the aged decline through overactivity.
From this perspective, ignorance is the form of cleverness,
and cleverness is the shadow of ignorance.
Non-action is the sound of successful affairs,
while successful affairs are the echo of non-action.
Cleverness is the snare of disorder;
action is the net of failure.
Therefore, the myriad things cannot be harmonized,
nor can Heaven and Earth be made to fit.
To force harmony is to lose harmony;
to impose fitness is to lose fitness.
Only by not harmonizing can one achieve harmony;
only by not fitting can one achieve fitness.
Thus, in times of peace, danger is unknown;
in times of chaos, order is unknown—
like shadow following form, inescapable,
or seeking echo without movement, unattainable.
Therefore, to know and yet sever knowledge
is not to be ensnared by knowledge;
to employ knowledge without knowing
is also not to be ensnared by knowledge.
The means by which they avoid ensnarement differ,
yet in being unensnared, they are one.

The sage, possessing a nature of penetrating clarity,
roams the wilderness of profound silence,
dwells in the realm of incapacity,
and embodies unknowing.
Still as empty space, fleeting as death,
his heart harbors no schemes,
his aspirations govern nothing.
His keen insight and movement
illumine the four seas,
obscuring the people’s ears and eyes,
revealing the absence of all things.
No culinary arts take shape,
no sounds or colors arise,
knowledge and habit do not emerge,
and calamity and chaos cease.
Without speech, the world is ordered;
without action, all under Heaven is complete.
The people bow without dissipation,
look up without imitation,
honest and loyal, each preserves their pure nature.
Serene and boundless,
all fulfill their Heaven-appointed destiny.
The dead bear no posthumous titles,
the living hold no ranks—
thus continuing for countless generations,
boundless and immeasurable.

Next are those whose emotions find no joy,
whose nature feels no delight,
whose heart knows no ease,
whose aspirations seek no gain.
Ill, they know not filial piety;
ailing, they know not fraternal duty.
They neither perceive benevolence
nor recognize righteousness.
Without rituals or codes,
they guard their steadfast integrity,
like elk or swans,
like wild geese in flight.
Neither troubled by sorrow nor joy,
nor separated from chaos,
they are as if blind, as if deaf,
perceiving nothing, hearing nothing.
Rulers have no palaces,
the people no walled cities.
States have no laws or decrees,
the world knows no shame or disgrace.
Thus, what was once a flaw is no longer a flaw,
and they entrust themselves to the Dao.
Without speech or action,
majesty and virtue arise of themselves.
Heaven and Earth harmonize in compliance,
vast and boundless.
Turbid as muddy currents,
resplendent as honored guests,
all beings are foolish,
returning to stillness.
Movement leaves no trace,
stillness no boundary.
Rulers and people flourish together,
the world is hushed and tranquil.
Forgoing petty gains,
they enjoy great fortune.
Those who govern through silence
cannot be calculated by calculation
nor measured by measure.
How to verify this?
When the Dao and virtue decline,
simplicity perishes,
and strange things proliferate,
knowledge and habit spread.
Rites and protocols arise,
divisions and standards become clear.
The myriad things fall into order,
all affairs have their guiding principles.
Borders are drawn, cities built,
states divided into districts, townships, and villages.
States have loyal ministers,
households have filial sons.
The inner is recorded, the outer neglected;
pairs form friendships,
sacrificing one for the other,
striving to enrich each other.
The strong fortify their ramparts,
the weak and small perish.
Sacrifices are made to Heaven and Earth,
to famous mountains and great rivers.
Offerings are made at Mount Tai,
rites performed at Liangfu—
these practices are handed down,
sometimes followed, sometimes not.
Prisons overflow with cases,
mutilated criminals fill the roads.
Ministers kill their rulers,
sons kill their fathers.
Ruined states and broken families
are too numerous to count.
All under Heaven enjoy the benefits of knowledge and habit,
yet incur the calamity of death.
From this, it is clear:
severing knowledge brings fortune,
while prizing knowledge invites thievery.
Thus, if a virtuous ruler were to alter his will and change his heart,
reviving all affairs to instruct his people,
praying for blessings to achieve great order,
nature would not comply.
If a ruler of a ruined state were to abandon wisdom, forsake desire,
cease all affairs, cultivate the Dao, and practice virtue,
discarding his intentions to avoid destruction,
his form would not obey.
Therefore, the rise and fall of pursuits and abandonments
are the form and sound of the kingly Way;
fortune and misfortune, survival and ruin
are the resonance and reflection of pursuits and abandonments.
The sage, in his movement, harmonizes with Heaven,
in his stillness, unites with the Dao.
He preserves his person
and safeguards the state.
Soaring beyond action,
reposing within non-affair,
he draws fortune from the subtlest realms,
yet extends it beyond the four seas.
He blinds the eyes of the discerning,
seals the mouths of the wise,
deafens the ears of the keen,
breaks the hands of the skillful.
He moves with the times,
bends with harmony,
achieves without acting,
governs without teaching.
His grace extends to beasts,
his favor reaches birds—
all because he diminishes keen perception, abandons wisdom,
discards action, and entrusts himself to the Dao.

Thus, by following one’s nature and yielding to desire, exhausting the heart’s intent,
in movement, one guides Heaven and Earth;
in stillness, one molds the myriad affairs.
The numinous and divine reside within oneself—
no scrutiny, no kindling—
yet without rising from one’s seat, the ten thousand states are spontaneously complete:
though one may wish not to perish, nature itself will not allow it.

**The People Do Not Fear Authority**
When the people do not fear authority, then great authority arrives.
Do not oppress where they dwell,
do not weary what gives them life.
Only by not wearying them do they not grow weary.
Thus the sage:
knows himself but does not display himself,
cherishes himself but does not exalt himself,
rejects that and embraces this.

---

**[The Essence of the Dao]**
The purport of the Dao, the task of spirit and illumination,
the heart of Great Harmony, the intent of Heaven and Earth—
no misfortune is graver than ruin,
no fortune greater than survival.
This is not true of Heaven’s Way alone; all beings are the same.
Thus the Way of preserving the self:
nothing is more urgent than nurturing the spirit;
the essence of nurturing the spirit:
nothing surpasses simplicity.
Ever embodying reverence and awe,
trembling and quaking—
the art of losing the spirit arises from indulgence;
the method of its ruin lies in self-assertion.
Therefore, the highest reveres the Dao,
the next reveres Heaven,
the next reveres Earth,
the next reveres others,
the next reveres the self.
Prosperity and decline, fortune and misfortune—
all emerge from oneself.
If one does not fear what is subtle,
one must fear what is manifest;
calamity will deepen, disaster will swell,
until annihilation comes.
By revering and fearing the primordial beginning,
extending to the formless,
soaring in vigilance before signs arise—
the Way shines greatly.
In movement, one attains what is desired;
in stillness, one attains what is peaceful.
Fortune and blessing sink deep and subtle,
pervading boundlessly.
Straight words seem contrary,
brightness seems dim,
vast and distant, boundless and profound—
none can hear of it.
The mandate lies within me—
what need is there to seek from Heaven?
Supreme fortune resembles misfortune,
great good seems ill—
the world, drunk and sated, cannot comprehend it.
Thus, the common folk, seeing only what is near and hearing only what is shallow,
do not recognize the Way of the profound and obscure,
are blinded to the constancy of the subtle,
blocked from the principles of spirit and illumination.
They perceive the profit in a hair’s tip,
yet do not see the calamity in a mountain’s bulk,
indulging their passions and postures,
fearing nothing, heeding no taboos.

Words follow what is natural, deeds follow what is good;
strength takes what it can, the heart recklessly bestows.
Arrogance and extravagance run wild, self-indulgence harms the self.
What loyalty and trust once cherished,
now deceives and endangers even parents,
encroaches upon Heaven and Earth,
and treats its lord with contempt.

Yielding to passions and desires violates the Dao of Heaven:
thus one contrives schemes and forges reputations to supplant one’s true self;
bestows favors and spreads kindness to incur great blame.
Fleeing fortune beyond the heavens, pursuing renown across the four seas—
virtue and power sought in vain,
calamity and disaster racing unchecked, nowhere to escape.
Only when overwhelming might descends does one begin to do good.

At such a time,
neither the Way nor virtue can save,
nor can Heaven and Earth resolve it.
This is not Heaven’s fault—
one delights in loftiness and grandeur,
bears might and wields power,
forgets care and loses fear,
seeks nothing from within.

Thus, one who worries for oneself fears no other;
one who stands in awe of oneself is not controlled by another.
Heeding the small, one does not dread the great;
cautioning the near, one does not regret the distant.

Therefore,
do not belittle one’s position yet fulfill it with diligence;
do not despise one’s station yet cultivate its rites with depth;
do not resent humble origins yet transform one’s great beginning;
do not weary of hardship and peril yet sever their root.

Embrace poverty as prosperity,
accept death as life—
though one may wish to linger,
one cannot long remain.

How to illustrate this?
Zhuangzi said:
The Dao of Heaven and Earth
begins with an end, ends with a beginning.
Yang qi rests in the hidden dragon, thus can melt metal;
yin qi abides in treading frost, thus can congeal ice.
Trees cherish autumn’s first down, thus can tower a hundred spans;
water delights in trickling streams, thus can form the sea.
Flying birds soar from the egg, thus can ascend the heights;
herds of beasts thrive in the womb, thus can roam afar.

Thus the sage,
whose wisdom reaches the boundless,
who joins with Heaven,
transforms and moves,
penetrates the great constancy—
still accumulates virtue and deepens its weight,
releases the heart’s intent,
conceals brilliance,
worries over decline,
fears the formless.
Hiding beginnings, concealing traces,
escaping appearances, fleeing emotions,
returns to emptiness,
reverts to the profound and obscure.

Though body outweighs Heaven and Earth, one does not exalt oneself;
though virtue surpasses yin and yang, one does not display it.
Dwelling in subtlety, residing in humility,
following after the myriad people.
Food without flavor, clothing without ornament—
compared to self-adornment,
the will dares not indulge.
Holding fast to the Dao, grasping virtue,
floating and sinking with things.
Nurturing the people as children,
encountering the multitude as a lord.
Virtue returns to Heaven,
merit shifts to others.
The world yields and defers,
grace runs deep and firm.

Thus,
misfortune cannot harm,
calamity cannot afflict,
fortune cannot flee,
and virtue cannot escape.
Not that the Dao is partial
or Heaven and Earth biased.

Be vigilant at the beginning, cautious in subtleties;
harmonious, yielding, loyal, and true.
Uphold the Dao, follow Heaven,
align with things.
Worry and fear when content,
find peace in hardship and poverty.
Success and failure, life and death—
seek them within oneself.

**On Courage**

Courage in daring leads to death; courage in restraint leads to life.
Ever knowing these two paths—one brings profit, the other harm.
What Heaven abhors, who knows its cause?

The Way of Heaven:
contends not yet excels in victory,
speaks not yet excels in response,
summons not yet comes of itself,
serene and yet excels in planning.
Heaven’s net is vast and wide,
sparse yet nothing escapes.

**[Exegesis]**
The Dao of Heaven and Earth,
the principle of life and death,
neither advances nor retreats,
neither seizes nor bestows—
it acts without acting,
spontaneous and nothing more.
Straight as a plumb line,
level as water,
it responds to images,
arising with things.
Reduction and increase, acceptance and rejection,
it begins and ends with events.
Depth and shallowness, weight and lightness—
all things take for themselves.
Diverse in form, distinct in kind,
each returns to its place.

Life is the root of killing; killing is the head of life.
These two shape each other—
fortune and misfortune manifest.
Thus, to know life but not killing
is to defy Heaven’s order;
to know killing but not life
is to reverse Earth’s essentials.

Therefore,
joy and anger have their bounds,
life and death their measures.
To defy Heaven is to incur its calamity;
to violate Earth is to suffer its punishment.
When anger is due but absent,
sons become jackals and tigers,
younger brothers become rhinoceroses and wolves.
When struggle is due but avoided,
wives become enemy states,
concubines become great bandits.
When killing is due but withheld,
one suffers Heaven’s harm,
becomes subject to things.
When joy is due but absent,
one endures Heaven’s disaster,
incurs Earth’s blame.
When life is due but not given,
a lord loses his state,
a commoner forfeits his life.

Thus, the noble person kills others as if killing himself,
gives life as if giving life to himself,
grasps virtue and embodies rectitude,
acting only when there is no other choice.
Preserving the self and pacifying the state
lies in the balance of life and death.
When life and death accord with principle,
Heaven and Earth protect;
when joy and anger are measured,
the myriad things submit.

Thus,
unyielding strength, forthright nature,
harsh strikes and cruel measures,
swiftly punishing the crooked to nurture the upright—
such courage first loses the Way.
Skilled in defense and attack,
clear on opening and closing,
prolonging wrath for fleeting pleasure,
finding peace in slaughter—
benefiting the state and aiding the people,
unafraid of the mighty,
their might shakes the hundred barbarians,
their power sways beyond the borders.
This is half of goodness.

Gentle and weak, reverent and cautious,
restraining emotions and moderating words,
deep in thought and far in foresight,
confronting right to punish wrong—
pursuing harmony for the few,
broad and profound in accumulating kindness,
benefiting without harming,
to make their goodness clear;
giving without seizing,
to display their name;
rewarding without punishing,
to establish their grace;
giving life without killing,
to perfect their benevolence.
This is half of goodness.

Yet these two achievements,
courage and daring evenly matched,
strategies racing like Jie,
shooting arrows at each other’s bodies,
opposing Heaven’s intent,
contradicting Earth’s heart—
each unleashes their passions,
indulges their desires,
some turn a thousand chariots into captive slaves,
others transform a commoner into a king.

Thus,
some things, when given life, become fortune;
others, when given life, become misfortune.
Some, when killed, become fortune;
others, when killed, become harm.
These two are profoundly subtle—
none can fathom their depths.

Therefore,
what is given life to become fortune
is what the world protects;
what is given life to become misfortune
is what the world abhors.
Nurturing what the world abhors
harms what the world protects;
nurturing what the world protects
harms what the world abhors.
One reversal, one return—
sometimes it becomes mysterious virtue;
one return, one reversal—
sometimes it becomes mysterious harm.

Serve Heaven and Earth as a father,
and descendants will prosper.
Thus,
those who nurture and whose posterity flourishes
give life where life is due;
those who give life yet perish afterward
give life where death is due.
Those who kill and bring fortune
kill where death is due;
those who destroy and invite misfortune
kill where life is due.

What Heaven abhors, dare not give life;
what Heaven protects, dare not kill.
What Heaven diminishes, dare not bestow;
what Heaven enriches, dare not seize.

Thus,
the courage of daring restraint—
its actions align with Heaven’s tally,
its stillness matches Earth’s ultimate pole.
What Heaven’s heart abhors,
none can discern.

The Dao of Heaven and Earth:
one yin, one yang,
divided into the four seasons,
separated into the five phases,
flowing into the myriad things,
refined into the three luminaries.
Yang qi governs virtue,
yin qi governs punishment.
They cover and bear the multitudes,
containing and exhaling all directions.
Mysterious and silent, without partiality,
upright and impartial,
they do not craft life as skill,
nor make killing a merit.
Responding to the myriad things,
daring not act alone—
fortune with fortune,
misfortune with misfortune.
Reduction upon reduction, increase upon increase,
killing upon killing, life upon life.
Those who do good reward themselves;
those who commit evil punish themselves.

Thus,
without acting, things arise of themselves;
without acting, things perish of themselves.
Shadows mingle with them,
echoes resonate with them.
Without seeking, things attain of themselves;
without restraint, things follow of themselves.
Without scrutiny, things reveal of themselves;
without inquiry, things express their nature of themselves.

Therefore,
contending not, yet nothing is not overcome;
speaking not, yet nothing is not answered;
summoning not, yet nothing does not come.
Serene and boundless,
nothing is not planned.
The net of the indistinct is cast,
the formless web is spread.
Vast and distant, lingering and slow,
closely observing without gaps,
shifting with things.

Thus,
ahead yet not remote,
behind yet not preceding,
still or active yet inaudible,
advancing or retreating yet unseen.
The cycle of fortune and misfortune,
fortune and misfortune return of themselves—
not from beyond Heaven,
none can escape.

**The People Do Not Fear Death**

The people do not fear death—
how then can death be used to frighten them?
If the people could always be made to fear death,
then those who act perversely,
I could seize and kill—
who then would dare?

There is always an executioner who kills.
To kill in place of the executioner
is to take the place of the master carpenter in hewing.
Few who take the place of the master carpenter in hewing
do not wound their own hands.

**[Exegesis]**
Human nature and disposition:
without knowledge, one is loyal and trustworthy;
with knowledge, one is deceitful and false.
In success, one is at peace;
in failure, one schemes wrongdoing.
In hardship, one scorns death;
in peace, one cherishes life.

How to make this clear? Zhuangzi said: The infant, ignorant yet loyal and trustworthy even to enemies, grows to maturity with knowledge and deceives even elder brothers and sisters-in-law. When the three armies gain advantage, the lowest soldiers become fearless captors; beasts in desperate ravines do not flee from rhinoceroses or tigers. Their nature has not changed—circumstances and reason make it so.

From this we see: when the people’s hearts are not at ease and their lives are not whole, proclamations cannot move them. When sorrow and grief weigh heavy, and joy is not worth the risk of death, punishments cannot terrify them.

Thus, rulers fond of knowledge trouble the world and weary the people, sacrificing to heaven and earth, warding off calamity and banishing misfortune, summoning goodness and beseeching blessings, praying to ghosts and spirits, altering ten thousand affairs, acting only to please the people. Every household becomes discerning, every village produces the humane and worthy. They defy the patterns of heaven and rely solely on human will, taking what they see as clarity and what they discuss as correctness, abandoning names and realities, turning their backs on the true nature of things. The Dao is obstructed, and praise and blame arise.

The world is thrown into great chaos. The hundred clans are restless, exhausted, and worn to the bone, impoverished and giving rise to treachery. Those who dare to fail are honored and rewarded; those who scorn death grow fat and live in peace. Those who accumulate goodness grow thin and bear many sorrows; those who fear the law go hungry and suffer many ills. The weak and few are miserable and long for death; the strong and many rejoice and become rulers. Thus, the world races for fame and contends for power, heedless of right and wrong, splitting hairs and severing the finest threads, regarding death as a return home. Only then do they proclaim harsh laws and severe punishments—this is to forbid what is easy and restrain what is held lightly.

Therefore, punishments and executions multiply, yet treachery does not cease. Rewards and emoluments are bestowed, yet great ministers are not employed. The common people do not submit; the feudal lords do not ally. The state is no longer their state; the self is no longer their self.

Thus, the sage who shepherds the people ensures that the ruler does nothing and the people have no expectations, that the people gain nothing and the ruler loses nothing. Their enterprises are easy to obtain but difficult to lose; their transformations are hard to violate but easy to practice. Their garments are easy to complete but hard to wear out; their food is easy to suffice but hard to exhaust.

Thus, those in the world who cast aside desires and abandon cravings, who delight in life and abhor death, all value their spirits and cherish their bodies. Therefore, their forms can be regulated and their power can be restrained. Thus, the outstanding, heroic, and far-seeing do not dare to create fortune or arrogate authority. Laws are established but not enforced; rewards are set but not dispensed.

Why is this so? Their bodies are weightier than heaven and earth; other things are lighter than a goose feather. When laws are harsh and punishments severe, the wise do not dare to transgress.

Therefore, the Dao of emperors and kings is non-action and inaction. The eyes see nothing; the ears hear nothing; the heart plots nothing; the mouth speaks nothing. Front and back, left and right, each has its appointed task. They supervise by responding to circumstances and secure their achievements. They entrust what they hold dear and return what they have done, bestowing ranks upon enlightened rulers and granting emoluments to advancing worthies. Those who create fortune die; those who usurp authority perish. The hundred officials attend to their duties, and the ruler has no part in it.

If the ruler relinquishes the minister’s tasks, the distant and hidden will be estranged, while the close and favored will be exalted. The ruler’s Dao will be obstructed, and governance will perish. When authority and majesty are both established, deceit and falsehood arise together. Ministers of ministers ascend, and the ruler incurs blame. The ruler’s power and influence vanish and do not flourish; treacherous heroes and bold leaders issue commands and enforce prohibitions. The hundred clans are bound in grievance; the myriad regions lose their principles. Loyal ministers grieve in sorrow; flatterers and schemers rejoice. Names and realities are mismatched; rewards and punishments are recklessly applied.

This is like making a corpse rise to wail in place of the master carpenter’s hewing. When the dead do nothing and the disciples mourn, it is because the dead do not wail. One who does not assist with squares and circles yet occupies the great hall relies on the master carpenter and does nothing themselves. If the corpse rises to wail, the mourners vanish; if the master takes the carpenter’s place in hewing, the work will not be completed.

Thus, enlightened kings and sagely lords rectify themselves to align with Heaven, while their strategizing ministers extend their plans to the people. The law originates from ministers, but its grasp lies with the ruler; commands issue from the ruler, but their adornment rests with ministers. What ministers name, the ruler covers; what ministers serve, the ruler schemes. If ministers’ names are not correct, they themselves forfeit their great mandate.

Therefore, the ruler’s Dao resides in yin, while the minister’s Dao resides in yang. The ruler masters absolute control, while ministers master the fixing of names. When ruler and ministers are separated and sealed off, all affairs become self-evident. Thus, the lord of men has his share, and the assembled ministers have their duties. Scrutinizing shares and clarifying duties, none may substitute for another. Each guards their own sphere, and the great Dao is thereby attained. All affairs become self-evident, serene and without disturbance, nothing is unconquerable.

If ministers enact the ruler’s Dao, they destroy themselves; if the ruler performs ministers’ tasks, the state is surely harmed.

---

When people suffer hunger, it is because those above consume excessive taxes—this is why they hunger. When the hundred clans are difficult to govern, it is because those above act—this is why they are ungovernable. When the people make light of death, it is because they seek excessive means to live—this is why they make light of death. To act without regard for life is more worthy than prizing life.

**Exegesis:**
The Dao and virtue in generating people have their shares; Heaven and Earth in sustaining people have their shares; feudal lords in guarding their states have their shares; ministers in serving their offices have their shares; the myriad things in preserving their bodies have their shares.

Receiving the endowment of nature and life, shaping the multitude of forms, opening and guiding the mind and intent, one thereby attains life. The organs and viscera transmit one another, blood and qi flow and circulate. Exterior and interior correspond, above and below bear one another’s burdens. Flexion and extension are nimble, seeing and hearing are keen—this is how the Dao and virtue apportion to people.

Enveloping and sustaining, clouds move and rain descends, thunder and wind act, the sun and moon alternate. Spring engenders, summer grows, autumn harvests, winter stores. Yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things flourish. The people’s movements and actions all suffice for life—this is how Heaven and Earth apportion to people.

Following the Dao and cultivating virtue, aligning with Heaven’s patterns, exhausting essence and spirit, pursuing the times without cease, embracing trust and reverting to simplicity, returning to the boundless, diminishing the minute and practicing frugality, serving as a model for the world—each guards their name and cultivates their virtue. Customs are pacified, the four seas submit—this is how feudal lords guard their charge.

Being greatly penetrating and harmoniously upright, straight and square without crookedness, loyal and trustworthy, compliant and obedient, upholding their allotted duties, commending good and reproving evil, not altering names and realities, not belittling their positions nor despising their roles—this is how ministers guard their spheres.

With carefulness and sincerity, frugality and diligence, following Heaven’s seasons, exhausting Earth’s resources, clothing themselves according to form, eating to harmonize the belly, rising at sunrise and resting at sunset, not scorning their dwellings nor tiring of their food—this is how the myriad people guard their bodies.

When movement and stillness lose harmony, one loses the Dao’s share; when plowing and weaving are untimely, one loses Heaven’s share; when abandoning others to rely on oneself, one loses the ruler’s share; when creating and contriving falsity, one loses the minister’s share; when clothing and food are unsuitable, one loses the people’s share.

Losing the Dao’s share, one’s nature cannot endure; losing Heaven’s share, one’s household cannot be secure; losing the ruler’s share, the state cannot endure; losing the minister’s share, one’s life cannot be preserved; losing the people’s share, one’s body cannot live.

Guarding shares as constant, one communicates with Heaven and Earth. Diminishing one’s excess shares, one walks together with the Dao. Sacrifices are unbroken, and later generations flourish. Exceeding shares to take much brings misfortune upon oneself. Heavy burdens follow one another, and later generations suffer calamity.

This is why the ancients abandoned and diminished their physical forms, enduring hunger, cold, and hardship: because their movement and stillness were disharmonious, their plowing and weaving untimely, they followed their emotions and indulged their natures, their desires were insatiable, they exhausted the five flavors in food, adorned themselves with heavy embroidery, indulged in extravagance and excess, knew no fear of Heaven, and though their merits and virtues were great, they could not fulfill their shares. The expenses for clothing and food were double what others took—thus, they brought calamity upon themselves, and their misfortunes extended to their descendants.

Hence, coarse clothing was worn without complaint, and plain food was eaten without dissatisfaction. This is why the hundred clans sought profit and turned to evil, public duties were abandoned for private gain, those who managed households grew rich while those who planned for the state grew poor, the upright died early, the incorruptible fell into hardship, customs declined and manners decayed, falsehood prevailed over truth, chaos and turmoil spread, the noble retreated into seclusion, the many and few oppressed one another, the strong and weak bullied one another, the poor served as subjects while the wealthy lived like kings—all because dissolute rulers and chaotic lords did not perceive the natural, turned against their true natures to indulge their desires, violated the Dao and departed from Heaven, and adorned their knowledge with contrivances to follow their hearts.

Thus, purity dissipated and simplicity vanished, while craft and deceit multiplied. Strange objects appeared daily, beyond all description. Flatterers and sycophants were favored and enfeoffed, while those who practiced ministerial arts prevailed and the ruler’s Dao gradually became obstructed. The paths of deceit and fraud were adorned, and the calamities of ruin and peril arose. Loyal and upright scholars were estranged and grew ever more distant, while those who deceived the world gathered and soared together. Murderers went unpunished, and forbidden evils were unaddressed. Power was established and influence exerted, awe moved the three armies. Whatever the eye beheld, whatever the mind directed, responded at a word. Wherever one wished to preserve, all surpassed the world—some like that, others like this, in a state of confusion and distress. Existence was not as good as annihilation, life was not as good as death. With boldness and reckless courage, they glared at one another. Rulers and ministers schemed against each other, fathers and sons measured one another. Boiling cauldrons could not instill fear, nor axes of iron halt them.

This is why the people belittled their lives and prized great wealth, rode perilous straits, violated heavy prohibitions, rushed upon naked blades, braved flying arrows, heedless of their bodies, valuing profit above all—because they sought the glory of fame and the abundance of life.

Thus, they lose wealth and forfeit rank, some rupturing their bowels or fracturing their livers, others madly twisting ropes around their necks, depleting their essence and discarding their spirit. Their hearts ever delight in death, seizing blades to mutilate themselves, or plunging into deep waters.

For this reason, the natural Dao constantly opposes the world’s ways. Those without self live; those with self die. Those who chase profit encounter calamity; those who seek fortune meet disaster. What comes unbidden arrives on its own; what is not sought is met unawares. Though I may wish to refrain, the world cannot be untangled.

Thus, to live is to chase profit, which is the root of death; to be without self and forsake profit is the root of life. To yield humbly and remain nameless is to avoid misfortune; to endure lowliness and disgrace is to escape blame. A diet of coarse greens and wild herbs brings lasting satiety; homespun cloth and deerskin robes bring enduring contentment. To take no heed of the people is to attain peace; to take no heed of life is to endure forever.

Therefore, one who can eliminate distinctions and diminish the self, reaching the point of taking nothing, lies like a corpse and stands like a marker, unchanging in transformation, undifferentiated in life and death, neither prizing lords and kings nor despising slaves and captives—abiding wherever fate places them, yielding to the workings of creation—is neither grieved by death nor rejoices in life. Only then do they become a companion to the Dao, a friend to Heaven and Earth, attaining long life and enduring vision, ending only to begin anew, their wealth and nobility boundless, becoming the world’s marketplace.

The "Softness of Life" Chapter

When humans are born, they are soft and weak; in death, they become stiff and strong. When plants and trees are alive, they are tender and fragile; in death, they wither and dry. Thus, the stiff and strong are followers of death, while the soft and weak are followers of life. Therefore, when armies grow strong, they do not prevail; when trees grow strong, they are felled. The strong and great dwell below, while the small and weak dwell above.

**[Annotation of the Dao’s Nature]:** There exists a thing born with all things, yet without form or sound, without color or taste, without scent or fragrance. It enters and exits without doors, comes and goes without gates, has no stem above nor roots below. Unchanging in stillness, it preserves its constancy; supple and subtle, it transforms without limit. It blends with things and gives rise to the Three, serving as the origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestor of yin and yang. It abides within things, and when it departs, things perish. It cannot be named, so it is called *shenming* (spirit and illumination).

Born of the Great Void, nurtured by nothingness, it receives without depletion and bestows without exhaustion. In motion, it knows no bounds; in stillness, it is profoundly indistinct. It encompasses all without exclusion, penetrates all without omission, circulating beyond all things, traversing within all existence. Heaven races and Earth hastens, yet cannot reach it; yin gallops and yang races, yet cannot overtake it. Echoes fade, yet it does not respond; shadows scatter, yet it does not resemble them. It may be grasped yet cannot be possessed; it may be given yet cannot be spent. In taking and giving, it has its measure, free from love or hate. It abides in softness and dwells in weakness, returning to emptiness and void. In advance and retreat, contraction and extension, it ever accompanies virtue.

It leads the Way as its vanguard, and things follow in its wake. Those who receive much become sages and wise ones; those who receive little remain foolish and dull. Thus, *shenming* and sagely wisdom are the masters of enduring life, while softness, weakness, emptiness, and stillness are the dwelling places of *shenming*.

When *shenming* resides within a person, if it finds its proper place, it cannot depart; if it loses its place, it cannot remain. It cannot be controlled by power or force, nor can it be manipulated by wisdom or cleverness. If one can grasp it, wealth and nobility bring no harm; one remains in high position, growing ever more secure with time.

Thus, when a person is first born, their bones are weak and their sinews soft; blood and qi flow freely, the mind is focused, and the spirit is harmonious. Their face radiates vitality, their body glows with moisture, their movements are gentle and joyful, and their limbs are strong and vital. With each passing day, they grow; with each passing month, they gain clarity. Why is this so? Because the spirit dwells within them.

As they age, their bones wither and their sinews tighten; their hair turns white and their flesh grows emaciated. Food and drink lose their savor, hearing and sight dim. Their qi and strength wane day by day, their movements weaken, their thoughts grow confused, and their choices contradict one another. When they die, their form withers and their countenance shrivels; their tongue retracts and their limbs stiffen. Why is this so? Because the spirit has departed.

When plants first sprout, their branches and stems are moist and supple; their blossoms and leaves are lush and verdant, flourishing in beauty, soft and harmonious. Why is this so? Because yang qi resides within them. As they decline, their blossoms and leaves yellow and wither; their colors fade and their vitality perishes. When they die, their roots and stems dry and decay, their branches grow hard and brittle. Why is this so? Because yang qi has departed.

Thus, where *shenming* dwells, the perilous may be stabilized and the dead may be revived; where *shenming* departs, the tranquil may turn perilous and the robust may perish. Where yang qi resides, wood may be bent and grass may be tied; where yang qi departs, qi may congeal and ice may shatter.

Therefore, *shenming* and yang qi are the root of all living things, while softness and weakness are their medicine. Softness, weakness, and harmony are the instruments of long life and the dwelling place of *shenming* and yang qi. All things follow the yang to attain harmony and weakness.

Thus, hardness, strength, and fullness are the forms of death, while softness, smoothness, and moisture are the abodes of life. By nature, people despise the father of the western neighbor for his overbearing strength, yet cherish the child of the eastern neighbor for his smallness and weakness. They burn and scorch the withered and brittle for their rigidity, yet adorn themselves with blossoms and jewels for their harmony and suppleness.

For this reason, when there is no Son of Heaven above, the feudal lords encroach upon one another, rival states contend for power, and armies clash in confrontation—yet the soft and weak prevail, while the hard and strong meet their downfall. Why is this so? Because mighty armies do not accord with Heaven and Earth; they do not root themselves in harmony and weakness, nor do they govern with compassion, punish the arrogant and violent, aid the destitute, or break the greedy and rapacious. Instead, their generals rely on the power of their states and the multitude of their people, delighting in building merit and fame, emulating the fierce and obstinate, coveting others’ lands, desiring others’ wealth, taking pleasure in killing and inflicting harm, razing others’ ancestral temples, and overthrowing others’ altars of soil and grain—all to display their might and authority. They humiliate the compliant and fear the submissive, exploit others’ advantages to advance their own ambitions. Those who befriend them meet death; those who serve them meet disaster. Their transgressions and punishments defy the hearts of the people, their slaughter and executions violate the will of Heaven. In life, the world suffers; in death, the world benefits.

When the weak unite as one, sharing their sorrows and devising plans together, though they may bear the name of strength, in truth they cannot be defeated. Why is this so? Because poison spreads and death takes root—Heaven’s Dao does not protect them. How can this be illustrated? In ancient times, the mighty Qin and the great Chu destroyed the feudal lords, annexed their commanderies and cities, amassed the wealth of nations, and ascended to the throne as Sons of Heaven. Their power overshadowed the world, their might shook the Four Seas, and their honor and favor reached their zenith—truly, they were strong! Yet when they sat at ease, the feudal lords trembled; when they lifted their feet, the world quaked in fear. When they issued decrees, Heaven’s heart grieved; when they acted, the *shenming* were disturbed. Their states perished, their families were destroyed, and their bodies were torn asunder. Why was this so? Because they abandoned harmony and weakness to embrace hardness and strength.

When the divine Han was about to rise, even those who fled into hiding like dragons could not escape—the myriad people sought them, and they could not avoid their fate. They regarded Heaven as father and Earth as mother, cherishing the people as their children, rewarding merit and nurturing goodness, taking Heaven and Earth as their teachers. Adapting to enemies and responding to change, their strategies flowed like rivers and seas; through victory in battle and conquest, they brought Qin to submission and destroyed Chu. The world rejoiced, and they were established as Son of Heaven. Why was this so? Because they aligned with Heaven’s heart and acted with compassion and humility.

This is not only true of human affairs—all things are thus. Consider the great tree, towering a hundred *xun*, its girth spanning multiple embraces, its crown splitting the central gate, its trunk cleaving the main door. Yet it bears no blossoms or fruit, forever dwelling below, while a thousand branches and ten thousand twigs spread their boughs and unfurl their leaves, lush and verdant, thriving above it. This is because its form is vast and its power strong.

Thus, the Dao of the *shenming* and the principle of Heaven and Earth decree that the small cannot bear the great, nor the light sustain the heavy. Therefore, the strong cannot rule as king, nor can the mighty tree stand above. Why? If the strong rule as king, the myriad states grieve in sorrow; if the mighty tree stands above, its roots wither and decay. The multitude, being great, thus dwell below, while the sage, being small, dwells above. The strong and great reside below, the small and weak above—this is the natural order of things.

**The Dao of Heaven**

The Dao of Heaven is like the drawing of a bow: what is high is pressed down, what is low is lifted up; what is excessive is reduced, what is insufficient is replenished. The Dao of Heaven reduces the excessive to supplement the insufficient. The Dao of man is not so—it diminishes the insufficient to serve the excessive. Who can possess excess and offer it to the world? Only one who embodies the Dao.

Thus, the sage acts without relying on his deeds, achieves without claiming credit, and does not desire to display his worth.

**[Direct Meaning]**
Before the beginning of Heaven and Earth, before the emergence of *yin* and *yang*, before the signs of cold and heat, before the forms of light and dark, there existed three things: one turbid, one clear, with the clear above and the turbid below, and harmony residing in the center. These three arose together, forming Heaven and Earth, uniting *yin* and *yang*, and giving birth to the myriad things. Those who lose harmony perish; those who attain it flourish.

Harmony in relation to things is neither rigid nor brittle, neither soft nor yielding. In Heaven, it is the plumb line; on Earth, it is the level. In *yang*, it is the compass; in *yin*, it is the square. It does not act, yet does not cease; it does not give, yet does not take. Things are made supple and weak, while *qi* is firm and strong. In movement, nothing is uncontrolled; in stillness, nothing is unyielding.

Thus, harmony is the function of virtue and power, the aid of the *shenming*, the regulator of Heaven and Earth, the dwelling of all living things, the essence of the myriad directions, the storehouse of nature, the gate of a hundred auspicious signs, and the door of ten thousand blessings. Therefore, the wise see it and call it wisdom; the benevolent see it and call it benevolence. The world relies on it day and night without cease, yet none can perceive it. Why? Because it gives birth to things in subtlety and accomplishes affairs with wonder.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth neither benefits nor harms, abides in non-action, and embraces great penetration and harmony. It follows things with profound generosity, not neglecting a single thing or favoring a single place, rectifying the nature and destiny of each—all things are thus by nature.

Therefore, what is full destroys itself, what is stretched slackens itself, what is hidden reveals itself, what is subtle becomes manifest. What is insufficient is increased, what is excessive is diminished. What exists perishes of itself, what lives dies of itself. Right and wrong reverse themselves, fortune and misfortune are self-acquired. Reduction cannot be escaped, increase cannot be resisted; misfortune does not linger forever, nor does fortune remain in one place. Each receives its allotted share and cannot possess both.

Thus, creatures with scales have no fur, those with fur have no feathers; those with tusks have no horns, those with horns have no teeth. What is seen by day vanishes by night; what is gained in front is lost behind. Double advantage and repeated benefit have never been known. Neither too great nor too small, fundamentally unchanging—once caught in its net, there is no escape.

Thus, the sun reaches its zenith and then declines; the moon becomes full and then wanes. The four seasons transform, now waning, now waxing. Beneath high mountains lie deep valleys; the flow of great springs gives rise to surging waves. Molten metal and searing stones exist within frozen ice; the fissures of the earth are formed by *yin* and *yang*. All that artisans create follows this principle.

The bowyer in crafting a bow brings both death and life, both contraction and expansion. It is shaped by compass and square, guided by level and plumb line. Where the bowstring is too taut and tense, it is loosened and relaxed; where it sags too low, it is drawn up and raised. Where there is excess, it is pared away and reduced; where there is deficiency, it is mended and augmented. Bow and string bear each other’s weight, upper and lower balance one another—levelness is the master, harmony the constant. Thus the bow may be drawn and the arrow may fly.

To press down the high and lift up the low, to diminish the great and augment the small—this is the Dao of Heaven and Earth. To oppose Heaven in order to comply with the people, to defy the people in order to comply with the Dao—this is the way of the worthy as assistants and the sage as master. Striving to cherish what is abundant, employing it as one’s left and right; placing the wise above and the foolish below; granting great rank to the capable and humble office to the unskilled; bestowing meager reward for scant merit and generous emolument for great toil—this is the Dao of lords and kings.

To deceive the honest and sincere, to mock the loyal and trustworthy, to encroach upon the obscure, to use strength to overpower the weak, the many to overpower the few, the well-connected to overpower the destitute, the high to overpower the low—thus the high cannot be leveled, the full cannot be destroyed, the great cannot be broken, the replete cannot be diminished, the hard cannot be snapped, the soft cannot be rolled up, the solitary cannot be controlled, the weak cannot be seized, the foolish cannot be despised, the nothing cannot be possessed. Heaven and Earth protect them as a child, the people aid them as a mother. In harmony they soar forever, with the Dao they begin and end. Heaven and man align in accord, and the numinous spirits guard them. This is the Dao of the perfected person.

Thus, when the sage acts, namelessness is his task, harmony and weakness his master. Concealed yet not exhausted, honored yet not conspicuous. He declines honor and yields wealth, taking no surplus for himself. He does not enter a state that is full, nor befriend a man who is replete. Ever as if he has lost something, vigilant as if he has met with fault. Treading the Dao and uniting with harmony, he is always a friend to things. Penetrating the warp of Heaven, comprehending the principles of Earth, he achieves success yet does not dwell in it, his power flows yet is not possessed. Fleeing fame and shunning power, he abides in the dark and obscure, erases his traces and conceals his tracks, guarding the formless. In stillness and emptiness, none can take from or give to him. Towering and independent, he shares the Dao of Heaven. Why is this so? He dreads the calamity of the Dao and dares not display worthiness.

The *Yilan* edition reads "lost."

**On Softness and Weakness Being Like Water**

Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water, yet in attacking the hard and strong, nothing surpasses it. There is no substitute for this. That water overcomes the strong and softness overcomes hardness—none in the world does not know this, yet none can practice it.

The sage has said: "He who bears the nation’s disgrace is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain; he who bears the nation’s misfortune is called the king of all under Heaven." Straightforward words seem contradictory.

To reconcile great resentment must leave residual resentment—how can this be considered good? Therefore, the sage holds the left tally but does not demand from others. One with virtue oversees the tally; one without virtue oversees exactions. The Way of Heaven shows no partiality—it constantly accords with the good person.

**[Direct Interpretation]**
What the Dao encompasses, what Heaven and Earth bear, what yin and yang transform, what the sun and moon illuminate—all things arise together, tangled and disordered. Flourishing and decay, existence and extinction change with the times. What accumulates hardness fails; what embodies softness prevails. This is the principle of the myriad things, the natural standard.

Thus, water can strike stone and pierce metal, shatter mountains and breach dikes. It circulates and transforms, sinking into the immeasurable, vast and boundless, long and without limit. Its clarity cannot be obscured, its strength cannot be overpowered. Though turbid, it can become clear; though little, it can become much. Though perilous, it can return to tranquility; though swift, it can become slow. It changes with the times, dies yet revives, saturates the myriad things, nourishes all forms. It bestows without depletion, sustains without exhaustion. It fills the four seas yet claims no merit; it matches Heaven and Earth yet makes no display. It roams within the finest hair’s breadth, soars beyond the nine wilds. Its blessings reach above the azure heavens, its depths coil beneath the yellow earth. Strong, it supports Heaven and Earth; weak, it sinks feathers and down. Minute accumulations gather to form rivers and seas. Without fixed position, it ends yet begins anew. Advancing and retreating, bending and stretching—it approaches the Dao. For its form is soft and weak, its movements await the proper time. It makes no sound, yet harmonizes; it is yielding, moist, and smooth.

Thus, the governance of the hundred crafts follows diverse methods for distinct tasks. It softens and dissolves metal and stone, shatters the hard and snaps the rigid. It levels the minute and rectifies the subtle, unbinds and relaxes the myriad forms. It harmonizes the five flavors, washes away foul stench. To breach the solid and breach the great, nothing but water suffices. Why is this so? Among all things, none matches its versatile power.

Thus, water extinguishes fire, whetstones sharpen metal. Teeth and horns may break or wear, but tongue and ears remain unharmed. The lowly and diminished restrain the proud and violent; the feminine and humbled overcome great resentment. None in the world fail to know this, none in世俗 remain unheard of it. Yet all persist in self-serving hearts, and none act accordingly.

Thus, speech becomes the artisan of disaster, silence the worker of harm. Advancing breeds ominous omens, retreating assumes the guise of calamity. Toil yields no virtue, suffering brings no merit. Ever receding from brightness, long mired in darkness, the great dwindles into the small, existence dissolves into oblivion.

Therefore, enlightened kings and sagely lords, when transmitting the state, must swear oaths: to bear the nation’s filth and become lord of the altars of soil and grain; to bear the nation’s misfortune and become king of all under Heaven.

What is meant by bearing the nation’s filth? It is to consume what the people reject, wear what the people find shameful, dwell where the people are sent, delight in what the people suffer, devoting oneself to following the people without leisure for personal comfort. Thus, the people entrust themselves to such a ruler as to a father, love him as a mother, willingly become his servants, and die with him. Therefore, even in lands of bitter cold and rocky soil, in remote and narrow territories, to endure humiliation is deemed honor; to preserve one’s ancestral line, to transform misfortune into blessing, and to long remain a ruler of the people.

What is meant by bearing the nation’s misfortune? It is to endure what the people find shameful, accept what the people detest; when the people face great calamity, not to claim it as virtue; to plan for the loss of the state without losing Heaven’s favor; to contemplate self-sacrifice without losing the people’s welfare. Heaven and Earth move in accord with such a ruler, all beings turn with him, following east or west, clinging to south or north. Where he applies his will, resistance perishes; what he schemes for submits. All under Heaven becomes vast and unified, turning to his influence, none fail to receive his grace. Thus, he can correct the crooked and quell disorder, nothing is beyond his conquest. He transforms excess and decay into sincerity and simplicity. His merit and power are supreme, his fame and authority reach their limit.

Why is this so? It is because of a yielding heart and a weak will, lightening oneself and valuing the people, finding peace in shame and humiliation.

Thus, upright words seem contrary, yet none can overturn them; nearness seems distant, yet none can fathom it; seeking it in the farthest reaches, none can attain it. Why? Extravagance resides in oneself, while frugality is demanded of others; perversity clings to one’s person, while rectitude is sought from the people. Disaster and misfortune arise from oneself, yet blessings are begged from Heaven. Heaven and Earth show signs one cannot see, spirits and gods give warnings one cannot hear. Abandoning this, one clings to self-serving desires. One’s actions here resonate with Heaven; blaming others while absolving oneself plunges all under Heaven into great confusion.

Without clear laws, punishment is meted out with trustworthy justice. Names and realities are verified, rewards and penalties are justly applied. Impartial and selfless, yet one strays from Heaven’s intent; upright and uncorrupted, yet one loses the people’s hearts. Punishments and executions are employed together, yet villainy increases; rewards are deep and gifts generous, yet chaos multiplies. At such times, the good are ensnared, the worthy fall into punishment. Though names and realities align, what good does it bring?

Therefore, the sage holds the tally of the Dao, grasps the token of virtue, unites them within himself, and does not demand them of others. Thus, a ruler of virtue, when intending action, must examine it against Heaven; when intending to act, must verify its tally and trust. He seeks faults in himself, not in the people. He attributes misfortune to himself, not to others. Thus, right and wrong are self-determined, black and white self-distinguished. Before he moves, all under Heaven responds; before he commands, the myriad things comply.

The virtueless, however, pursue their desires without regard for the people. Governance falters and chaos arises, yet they do not seek the cause in themselves. They strictly oversee the people’s failings, enforcing harsh punishments. Individuals bear faults, families bear guilt. The hundred clans harbor resentment, Heaven’s heart is unsettled. The state falls into turmoil, and posterity suffers calamity.

Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth proceeds together with humanity. It is neither partial nor impartial, neither distant nor close. Stimulus and response correspond like echo to sound, stillness and movement follow like shadow to form. Uncorrupted and unflattering, upright as if constant. Evil deeds meet obstruction, good deeds meet passage. Yielding and weakness find accord with it, non-action unites with it.

**Small States with Few People**
Let there be small states with few people. Let them have tools of myriad uses yet not employ them. Let the people value life and not journey far. Though there be boats and carriages, none ride them; though there be armor and weapons, none display them. Let the people return to knotted cords for record-keeping. Let them find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their customs joyful, their dwellings secure. Neighboring states are within sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard, yet the people grow old and die without visiting one another.

**Exegesis:**
States vary in size, lands in peril or ease, people in number, goods in abundance, terrain in elevation, roads in distance, power in strength, authority in weight. The large overcome the small, the easy overcome the perilous, the rich overcome the poor, the many overcome the few, the high overcome the low, the near overcome the distant, the strong overcome the weak, the light overcome the heavy—such is the principle of things.

Strength or weakness lies with the general, safety or danger with the minister, gain or loss with the ruler, survival or ruin with the Dao. Heaven does not favor constantly, the people do not dwell constantly. Those with virtue are drawn to it, those without virtue turn away—such is the natural Dao.

Thus, vast lands and numerous people, with brave generals and stern rulers, are not necessarily strong. Strong armor and trained soldiers, high walls and deep moats, do not necessarily ensure security. Eloquence and sharp hearing, sweet words and flattery, borrowed compliance, do not necessarily bring closeness. Ceding land and offering treasures, forming alliances and coalitions, rallying factions and amassing power, do not necessarily ensure preservation.

Only those who embody the Dao are unrestrained in their dominion. With virtue profound and grace far-reaching, none can withstand them. The small transforms into the great, the weak turns into the strong, the light shifts into the weighty, the few become the many. Thus, where the noble abides, though small, it endures; where the petty dwells, though vast, it perishes.

Therefore, the ruler of a small state—with narrow lands and few people, shallow virtue and feeble authority, ignored by the feudal lords, unable to enforce laws or prohibitions—lacks even the barriers of hills and mounds, the defenses of rivers and gorges, or the alliances of neighboring states. Isolated and alone, it survives amidst great powers, its barren soil too meager to cede, its treasures and tribute too paltry to offer. Generals and ministers do not rally to it, the common people depart lightly, and neighbors make heavy demands. Thus, without the steadfastness of bedrock or the security of mountains, it remains ever in the peril of a precarious stack of eggs. Yet to conquer it would not be deemed tyranny, nor to bestow grace upon it considered excess. Thus, the small state is the pivot of peril and ruin, the crux of peace and stability.

Therefore, when the sage governs a small state, they turn misfortune into fortune, transform danger into tranquility. They enrich it with boats and chariots, fill it with armor and weapons. Tools and implements are efficient, clothing and food abundant. Cattle and horses multiply, stores overflow. They unite with neighboring states tenfold and a hundredfold to secure the people’s hearts. Though capable, they do not act; though wise, they do not contrive. Flavors are not indulged, kitchens are not adorned. They renounce sensual pleasures and extravagant appearances, setting the example themselves. They drink before eating, rest only after labor. In summer, a single layer suffices; in winter, one set of garments. Their aim is harmony and comfort, not lavish attire. They strive for livelihood’s ease, not gluttony. Taxes are light, corvée labor sparse, leaving the people with strength to spare. The roots of annexation are severed, the currents of expansion stilled. Customs are honest and frugal, marked by loyalty and sincerity. They possess as if they possess not, are capable as if inept.

Why is this so? They establish governance through the Dao, embrace it with virtue. Toil and ease, peril and peace—they share these equally with the people. Their hearts are balanced and harmonious, their judgments grounded in truth. With reverence, compliance, and humble words, they exalt the spirit.

Scholars of keen insight and abundant virtue, their brilliance and power dissipate like flowing water. Neighboring states remain unmoved, while the hundred clans gather in harmony. They delight in life and cherish longevity, despising banditry and theft. In such times, though no bells or drums resound, the myriad things suffice. The hundred clans live in concord, ruler and minister in mutual accord. Content with their land and joyful in life, they meet death even in caves and ravines. Though migration might bring a hundredfold profit, none would leave their homeland. Households possess boats and carriages, yet nothing to transport; they keep armor and weapons, yet no force to exert.

Why is this so? Generals and ministers are wise and discerning, the lord of men walks the Dao, and the people devote themselves to plowing and weaving, prizing accumulation. Simplicity and plainness reign above, softness and weakness are esteemed; loyalty, reverence, and trustworthiness are valued, while craft and cunning are held in low regard. Laws are clear and customs settled; above and below safeguard one another. The people follow before commands are given, enemies tremble without battle. Those who seek profit do not recognize insurmountable difficulty, and those who chase fame do not scheme to avoid blame. Serene and untroubled, the hundred clans remain undisturbed. Cunning is diminished, action abandoned, and they return to the great antiquity. They knot cords to mark time and speak of matters with unadorned sincerity. Things are ordered by simple patterns, words are few, and ambitions scant. All aligns with nature, each attains their place.

They find sweetness in tasteless wild greens and broomcorn, and beauty in unadorned cloth and deerskin robes. Perilous straits and treacherous paths bring only deeper tranquility. Cold cliffs and remote ravines are endured as if thick shelter; customs of ease and song arise, and they grow accustomed to the land and water. The Dao flourishes, virtue abounds, and harmony embraces the widowed and orphaned. Touching the earth and bordering lands, each safeguards their own. Spirit is not depleted, soul not destroyed. Nature and destiny remain whole and complete, desires fully realized.

The cries of chickens and dogs are heard across the land, people gather firewood and herbs, gazing at one another from mountain heights. They bathe together in streams and gullies, dwelling in close proximity, yet ruler and minister form no bonds, men and women do not congregate. From birth to old age, from old age to death, none travel unless bearing the lord’s command.

The "Truthful Words Are Not Fine" Chapter

Truthful words are not fine; fine words are not truthful.
The wise are not broadly learned; the broadly learned are not wise.
The good are not eloquent; the eloquent are not good.

Therefore, the sage does not hoard.
Having given to others, one possesses more;
having bestowed upon others, one has more.

The Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm;
the Way of the sage acts and does not contend.

**[Propensity and Return]:** The empty and the full return to one another; the existent and the nonexistent give rise to each other.
Cold and heat oppose each other; brightness and darkness follow one another.
Yin wanes as yang waxes; yang waxes as yin wanes.
When the root flourishes, the branches decay; when the branches decay, the root declines.
The Way of Heaven and Earth is the mechanism of transformation.

All these are the gates of wisdom, the roots of sincerity and deceit, the measure of doubt and suspicion, the balance of dazzlement and brilliance.
By grasping the root, cultivating the formless, opening with the heart of Heaven, supervising with spontaneity, distilling and extending, simplifying and returning, examining the near to know the distant, observing the overturned to see the reversed, hearing names to recognize realities, seeing beginnings to know endings, listening to sounds to discern forms, and using analogies to grasp gains and losses—then the sentiments of a thousand years share the same tally, and the methods of ten thousand generations are held in common. The heart of Heaven and Earth can be seen, and the intent of the numinous can be fully known.
How much more so in human affairs?

When people embrace the Dao of spontaneity, comprehend the principles of human nature, hold fast to the origin of creation, and clarify the distinctions of similarity and difference—if their words hit the mark and their virtue is harmonious and mild—this is called *truthfulness*.
It is what the subordinate looks up to in the superior, what the other takes from this, the origin of strength and greatness, the beginning of authority and command, what the people assist, the Way of successful achievement, the basis of power and influence, and the source of names and titles.
Thus, when one person sings, a thousand respond; when one moves, ten thousand follow. They break strong enemies, overwhelm great multitudes, rush into water and fire, face peril and death, and though they die without turning back, the people bear no resentment—this is *truthfulness*.

Sweet words and flowing persuasion, with many assents and fine praise, are called *untruthfulness*.
What is *untruthfulness*?
Words that do not accord with reality are called *untruthfulness*.
When people are untruthful, virtue and grace are not established, authority and power do not prevail, weight and influence are not manifest, names and titles are not clear. Rewards do not motivate, punishments do not restrain.
Thus, superiors and subordinates do not adhere to one another, undertakings achieve no success. Though noble, one holds no position; though lofty, one has no people. Isolated and alone, the altars of soil and grain are not secure. The world hopes for fortune but meets only punishment and execution—this is the result of *fine words*.

Returning to the root and reverting to the origin, departing from the branches and discarding ornamentation, reverting to the primordial and the original, using few to govern many, using one to respond to ten thousand, distilling to control the detailed, and simply guarding the true and unified—this is called *limited hearing*.
Because hearing is limited, one can *know*.
What is *knowing*?
Comprehending human sentiments and extending to the numinous—this is *knowing*.
*Knowing* is the method of preserving oneself and the tool for protecting the state. It is what the superior relies upon and the subordinate adheres to, the guiding principle of Heaven and the path of the Dao.
Thus, it encompasses the great model of safety and danger, holds the essentials of order and chaos, and enables the scholars within the seas to exhaust their loyalty and abilities, fulfill their duties, and serve the public to bring peace to their superiors. Power and influence flow, and majesty and virtue flourish—this is *knowing*.

When the mind recognizes ten thousand things and the eyes pry into human affairs without limit, and the many ministers are scattered—this is called *broad hearing*.
Because hearing is broad, one does *not know*.
What is *not knowing*?
Being suspicious of the Way of Heaven and doubtful of human affairs—this is *not knowing*.
Those who do not know indulge in all matters.
Internally, they are full of thoughts and worries; externally, they are full of desires and pleasures. They have things they hate and many things they detest.
Easily lured into life, they can be coerced into death.
Thus, they move at the sight of the extraordinary, fear in the face of danger, are dazzled by things, deceived by temporal changes, violate communication and oppose understanding, and fall into destitution. In action, they neighbor calamity; in stillness, they border misfortune. The ancestral temples are imperiled, and the myriad people scatter and disperse—this is the result of *broad hearing*.

Being thoroughly informed and broadly understanding, yet appearing careless in speech and slow of tongue—this is called *not eloquent*.
Drawing together in silence and forming in stillness, they thus accomplish *goodness*.
What is *accomplishing goodness*?
In movement, they accord with the heart of Heaven; in stillness, they attain the intent of Earth. Their words are universally effective; their silence is universally beneficial—this is *goodness*.
*Goodness* is the foundation of the noble person and the chief of all conduct. It is what auspicious signs unite with and where all blessings gather. It flows without exhaustion and is used without depletion. It does not change through ten thousand kings nor alter across different customs. It is what Heaven and Earth bestow and what the numinous favors.
Thus, above, it accords with Heaven; below, it accords with people. It is the origin of governance and the constant of affairs. It perfects the myriad things, covers and sustains all living beings. The world cherishes and admires it, and its succession is endless—this is *goodness*.

Not recognizing the origin, not seeing the root, falsely accusing Heaven and Earth, falsely accusing people and spirits, altering words and changing meanings—this is called *eloquence*.
Embracing suspicion and treading in doubt, following the heart’s reckless impulses, prizing fine words and beautiful phrases—thus *not goodness* arises.
What is *not goodness*?
In movement, opposing Heaven; in stillness, contradicting Earth. Words harm people and things; silence harms spirits—this is *not goodness*.
Those who are not good separate from the Dao and diverge from virtue, scatter simplicity and dilute purity, alter words and embellish phrases. They rely on righteousness and borrow benevolence, set up omens and proofs, connect Heaven and Earth, and invoke bears and tigers. Though the world venerates them, they reverse meanings and overturn intentions, flee from reality and evade names, dazzle people with emptiness, confuse people without cause, abolish the straightforward and establish the false. They strive to flatter the ruler, adorn their words to please their superiors, form cliques to follow the lord’s heart, open the gates of cunning and deceit, close the doors of loyalty and uprightness, and wield the arts of flattery and compliance to overturn the state’s power. They give rise to violence and chaos, breed great treachery, and cause the world to be full of tongues, the age to be turbid, and the lord to be benighted. Obstruction and blockage lead to peril and destruction—this is the result of *eloquence*.

Thus the sage is vigilant at the outset, severing what has yet to sprout, discarding eloquence and cunning, forsaking ornament and speech. Emptiness and stillness, softness and weakness, profound silence and plain truth—concealing knowledge and hiding goodness, guiding through spontaneity. Right and wrong, black and white, shine bright as sun and moon; sameness and difference, truth and falsehood, stand firm as earth and heaven. Void and without accumulation, changing with all things, acting through non-action, aligning with all things as they are. Nurturing without overflow, dispersing without exhaustion, embracing the ten thousand directions—even the most learned search in vain for its threads, even the most eloquent ponder afar yet hear not its beginning. Bestowing without depletion, transforming without end, concluding yet returning to the start, great brightness veiled as darkness.

Having acted for others, one’s self grows ever at ease; having fully governed others, one’s self grows ever clearer. Having given life to others, one’s self grows ever longer-lived; having fully taught others, one’s self gains ever more. Both yang and yin, yin yet again yang, benefiting without harming, in harmony with Heaven and Earth. Giving life without killing, in communion with the divine luminaries, establishing virtue and spreading blessings, ever abiding in manifest glory. Rejecting artful words to invite fortune; returning to namelessness, acting without reliance, proceeding in step with the Dao.
