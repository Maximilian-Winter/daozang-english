# 道德经注

The *Laozi Dao De Jing* (Chapter on the Dao/Way)

**Chapter 1: Cultivating the Dao/Way** (Title absent in pre-Tang editions)

The Dao/Way that can be spoken of—
That is the Dao/Way of learned doctrines and political teachings.

The Dao/Way that cannot be spoken of—
That is not the Dao/Way of natural longevity.

The true Dao/Way is to nurture the spirit with *wu* (non-action),
to keep the people undisturbed,
to hold light within and conceal brilliance,
to efface traces and conceal origins,
so that it cannot be named.

The name that can be named—
That is the name of wealth, honor, high rank, and worldly distinction.

The name that cannot be named—
That is not the name of natural permanence.

The true name is like the infant before speech,
the rooster before crowing,
the pearl within the shell,
the fine jade still in stone,
the light still unmanifested.
Though inwardly clear, outwardly it appears as foolishness.

*Wu* (the unnamable) is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.
The beginning is the origin of the Dao/Way,
emitting *qi* and spreading transformation,
arising from the void,
as the fundamental source of Heaven and Earth.

*You* (the named) is the mother of all things.
That is, Heaven and Earth—
with their forms, positions, yin and yang, soft and hard—
are the named.
The mother of all things is Heaven and Earth,
which contain *qi* and give birth to myriad beings,
nourishing them to growth and maturity,
as a mother nurtures her child.

Thus, one who habitually has no desires
can observe its subtlety—
that is, the unity of the Dao/Way.

One who habitually has desires
can observe their consequences—
that is, where worldly inclinations lead.

These two arise from the same source yet bear different names.
The two—habitual non-desire and habitual desire—
arise from the same human heart,
yet their names differ.
The one called "non-desire" endures forever,
while the one called "desire" perishes in the body.

Both are called *xuan* (the mysterious).
That is, *xuan* (the mysterious) is Heaven.
It speaks of how both those with and without desires
receive *qi* from Heaven.

The mysterious, yet more mysterious—
Heaven within Heaven.
The thickness of the *qi* one receives:
if one attains harmony and pure nourishment, then sages are born;
if one attains disorder and corruption, then greed and lust arise.

The gateway to all subtleties—
To know that Heaven contains Heaven,
that the *qi* one receives varies in richness,
and to discard emotions and desires,
to preserve harmony—
this is called the doorway to understanding the Dao/Way’s essential subtleties.

**Chapter 2: Nurturing the Body**

「All under Heaven know beauty as beauty.
—It is self-promotion, making it manifest.

Yet this is already ugliness.
—It harbors danger and decay.¹

All under Heaven know goodness as goodness.
—It brings honor and fame.

Yet this is already not-goodness.
—It is what people strive for.

Thus, having and not-having give rise to each other.
—Seeing what is present as what is absent.

Difficult and easy complete each other.
—Seeing what is difficult as what is easy.

Long and short define one another.
—Seeing what is short as what is long.¹

High and low incline toward each other,
—Seeing what is high as what is low.

Sounds harmonize with one another.
—When the upper sings, the lower must respond.

Front and back follow in sequence.
—When the upper moves, the lower must follow.¹

Therefore, the sage dwells in affairs of non-action.
—He governs by the Dao/Way.

He practices teaching without speech.
—He leads by example, guiding with his conduct.

All things arise and he does not claim them.
—Each moves naturally, without refusal or obstruction.¹

He acts yet does not rely on it.
—What the Dao/Way accomplishes, He does not depend upon or expect reward in return.²

When his virtue is complete, he does not dwell in it.
—When his work is done, he withdraws, not clinging to his position.¹

Only because he does not dwell in it,
—His virtue/power remains ever-present, never leaving his person.

This is how one cannot act without following,
nor speak without being known.

The six lines above discuss high and low, long and short,
—The ruler opens one source, from which a hundred branches emerge,
and the myriad transformations of those branches
never fail to stir unrest.¹

**Chapter 3: Settling the People**
The sage does not exalt the conventionally wise.
—The conventionally wise are those of the world who,
with eloquence and skill in words,
depart from the Dao/Way, clinging to expedience,
and discard substance for superficial ornamentation.
To not exalt them means
not to honor them with wealth nor elevate them with office,
so the people do not vie in strife.

He does not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures.
—That is, the ruler does not indulge in rare jewels or delicacies;
gold is abandoned in the hills,
pearls and jade are cast into the depths.
Thus, the people do not become thieves.

He does not display what is desirable.
—He rejects the wanton music of Zheng,
and keeps away flatterers.
Thus, the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.

Therefore, the sage’s governance—
Whether ruling a state or nurturing the body—
is marked by emptiness of the heart,
—Discarding cravings, banishing tumult.

Filling the belly,
—Embracing the Dao/Way, holding to unity,
and preserving the Five Spirits.³

Weakening the will,
—Yielding gently, humbly, and without arrogance,
not clinging to power.

Strengthening the bones,
—Cherishing essence, moderating exertion,
so marrow is full and bones are firm.

Ever keeping the people in ignorance and without desire,
—Returning to simplicity, guarding purity,
so that even the clever dare not act.

Doing without doing,
—Not contriving, moving only as circumstances dictate,
then nothing remains ungoverned.
—His virtue/power is profound, the people at ease.

**Chapter 4: The Source of the Dao/Way**
The Dao/Way is boundless yet finds its use within.
—Boundless, meaning central and unobstructed;
its use lies in the middle.

The Dao/Way is hidden, nameless, and stores merit,
yet its application is found in the central.
Sometimes it does not overflow.
—Sometimes, meaning always;
the Dao/Way is ever humble, never full.

Deep as if the origin of all things,
—Its depths are unfathomable, like the ancestral source of all things.

Dulling its sharpness.
—Sharpness means aggressive advancement;
when people seek to sharpen their essence and grasp for honor,
one must blunt their pursuit of the Dao/Way.

Dispelling its confusion.
—Confusion means entangled roots;
one must reflect that the Dao/Way is non-action to resolve it.

Softening its brightness.
—Though he may possess singular insight,
he must know the darkness,
not using it to disturb others.

Equalizing with the common dust.
—He must always align with the masses,
not setting himself apart.

Calm as if preserved.
—He must remain tranquil and undisturbed,
thus enduring without perishing.

I do not know whose child it is.
—The *Laozi* says, "I do not know from whence I was born."

It precedes the Emperor.
—The Dao/Way exists before Heaven and Earth,
this saying that the Dao/Way is born prior to Heaven and Earth.

To this day, those who endure
are able to remain tranquil and undisturbed,
not laboring or desiring,
so that people may model themselves after the Dao/Way.

**Chapter 5: The Use of Emptiness**
Heaven and Earth are not kind.
—They bestow and transform without favor,
not acting from benevolence but following nature.

They treat all things as fodder and beasts.
—Heaven and Earth give birth to all things,
yet regard humans as no more precious than grass or dogs;
they do not expect gratitude in return.

The sage is not kind.
—The sage nourishes the people without benevolence,
mimicking Heaven and Earth in natural action.

He treats the people as fodder and beasts.
—The sage regards the people as no more precious than grass or dogs,
not expecting their respect or obedience.

Between Heaven and Earth,
—The space between Heaven and Earth is void and filled with harmonious *qi*,
so all things arise naturally.
If a person can discard emotions and desires,
moderate tastes and nourishment,
and purify the Five Organs,
then the spirit will dwell within.

It is like the bellows.
—The bellows is hollow yet produces sound;
if one’s body remains empty yet unbroken,
and moves with greater vitality,
then...»

「――Thus, when the body is empty yet unbroken,
and the *qi* moves with greater vitality,
there is no time of exhaustion or collapse
when its sound and breath arise.

Excessive speech leads to depletion.
—Excessive speech harms the body,
and reckless words bring misfortune.
Better to preserve the center.

—Better to cultivate *virtue/power* within,
nourishing the spirit and *qi*,
while speaking sparingly.

The sixth chapter completes the form:
*The Grain Spirit* does not die.
—This refers to nourishment from the *Grain*.
If a person can nourish the spirit,
then they will not die.
The *spirit* here refers to the vital essences of the Five Organs.
If the Five Organs are all injured,
then the Five Spirits depart.

This is called the *Dark Mother*.
—This speaks of the *Dark* being the source of immortality.
*Dark* is Heaven.
In humans, it is the nose,
which houses the heart,
where the Five *qi* gather in subtle purity—
the essence of spirit and clarity,
the resonance of sound and the Five Virtues.
Its ghostly form is called *hun*—
the *hun* is masculine,
governing the breath entering and leaving through the nose,
and communicating with Heaven,
so the nose is called *Dark*.

Earth nourishes humans with the Five Flavors,
which enter through the mouth
and lodge in the stomach.
The Five Virtues here are turbid and coarse,
manifesting as flesh, bones, and sinews,
while the Six Emotions flow through the blood and *vessels*—
its ghostly form is called *po*.
The *po* is feminine,
governing the breath entering and leaving through the mouth,
and communicating with Heaven and Earth,
so the mouth is called *Mother*.

The gate of *Dark Mother*—
this is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
—This is the *root element*.
The nose and mouth,
inhaling and exhaling,
are the pathways through which
the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth circulates.
Continuous as silk,
subtle as if preserved yet absent.

To use it without strain.
—To employ *qi* with ease and moderation,
not hastening or exhausting it.

The seventh chapter conceals its light:
Heaven endures, Earth persists.
—This explains Heaven and Earth’s longevity and vitality,
to enlighten and teach humanity.

Why Heaven and Earth alone endure so long—
it is because they do not seek to generate themselves.
—Heaven and Earth endure uniquely long
because they remain tranquil,
acting without self-aggrandizement,
not seizing others’ benefits to enrich themselves.
Thus, they achieve eternal vitality.

Therefore, the sage places themselves last.
—This is the principle of prioritizing others before oneself.
Yet their self is foremost.
—The world holds them in highest respect,
and they are revered as the longest-lived.

They set themselves apart.
—This is to be thin with oneself
and generous with others.
Yet their self remains.
—The people love them as parents,
and the spirit of Heaven aids them
like a cherished child,
so their self is ever preserved.

Not because they lack selfishness.
—The sage is loved by people and aided by Heaven
not because of their impartiality or lack of self-interest.
Thus, they fulfill their own desires.

The eighth chapter transforms nature:
The highest excellence is like water.
—The person of highest excellence,
like water’s nature.
Water benefits all things.
—Water in Heaven is mist and dew,
on Earth it is springs and sources.
Yet it does not contend,
dwelling where others revile.
—Others detest lowliness, dampness, filth, and turbidity,
but water alone flows quietly therein.
Thus, it approaches the Dao.

It favors the lowly.
—Water’s nature is to flow downward,
like the *Mother* in motion,
always descending to benefit humanity.

The heart favors depth.
—Water is deep and empty,
its depths pure and bright.
It aligns with *virtue/power*.
—All things receive water to thrive,
and it does not hoard what it gives—
this is the virtue of generosity.

It is trustworthy.
—Water reflects all forms within,
never losing its essence.

It is upright.
—It cleanses all impurities,
remaining clear and even.

It is capable.
—It adapts to square and round,
to curves and straightness.

It acts in due time.
—In summer it disperses,
in winter it congeals,
moving in accordance with the seasons,
never losing its natural rhythm.

Only because it does not contend.
—If blocked, it stops;
if released, it flows—
it yields to others.
Thus, it meets no blame.

The ninth chapter balances ease:
Hold and fill it,
but it is better to let it be.
—*Fill* means *satisfied*.
*Let it be* means *stop*.
To grasp at fullness is to invite collapse,
better to cease before excess.

Shape and sharpen it,
but it cannot be long preserved.
—*Shape* means *refine*.
After refinement, it must be discarded.
Even gold and jade in abundance,
no one can guard them.

Wealth and honor bring arrogance,
and they ruin themselves.
—Great riches should be used to relieve the poor,
and high status to cherish the lowly.
Yet if one grows proud and indulgent,
misfortune will follow.
When achievement is complete and reputation established,
retire from the world—
this is the Dao of Heaven.

The tenth chapter speaks of capacity:
Carry the *hun* and *po*.
—The *hun* and *po* are the vital spirits.
Humans carry these spirits above,
and must cherish them.
If one’s joy and anger disturb the *hun*,
or fright and shock injure the *po*—
the *hun* resides in the liver,
the *po* in the lungs—
then rich wine and sweet delicacies
corrupt the lungs’ *po*,
and the *hun* grows restless,
while the will becomes chaotic and ungrounded.
Yet if the *hun* is tranquil and the *po* settled,
one’s life will be prolonged and years extended.

Embrace the *One* and remain undivided.
—This means one can hold the *One* within,
so it never departs from the body.
The *One* is the pure *qi* of the Dao’s origin,
the great harmony of primordial essence.

Thus, it is called the *One*.
Its name spreads across the world:
Heaven gains the *One* to achieve clarity,
Earth gains the *One* to achieve tranquility,
and rulers gain the *One* to achieve balance.
It enters as the heart,
and manifests in action.
Its distribution is called *virtue/power*,
and its totality is called the *One*.
The *One* is the principle of singular will—
no duality exists.»

Concentrate the *qi* to attain softness.
—If one steadfastly guards the vital *qi* so it remains undisturbed,
the body will respond with supple compliance.

Like an infant.
—If one is as an infant—
inner thoughts unburdened, outer affairs unattended—
then the spirit will not stray.

Purify and gaze into the void.
—One must cleanse the heart to make it pure.
The heart dwells in the abyssal darkness,
perceiving all things—
thus it is called *playing with the void*.

Free from blemish.
—This means no indulgence in licentiousness.
Purity itself is free from flaw.

Love the people, govern the state.
—Those who govern their bodies cherish *qi*,
and thus preserve their form.
Those who govern the state cherish the people,
and thus secure the realm.

Without knowing.
—Those who govern their bodies breathe the vital *qi*
without letting the ears perceive it.
Those who govern the state bestow virtue and benevolence
without letting the people know of it.

The Celestial Gate opens and shuts.
—The Celestial Gate refers to the Purple Forbidden Enclosure [North Celestial Pole].
Opening and shutting refers to the five critical junctures [of life].
For governing the body, the Celestial Gate is the nostrils—
opening is panting, shutting is breathing.

Without favoritism.
—In governing the body, one should be like the female—
tranquil, yielding, and weak.
In governing the state, one adapts harmoniously without contradiction.

Illuminating and all-pervading.
—This means clarity and openness,
like the sun and moon radiating through all eight extremes of the world,
so that though unseen and unheard,
its brilliance shines forth in all ten directions,
resplendent and luminous.

Without knowing.
—There is none who can know and fill the world.

Nurture and preserve.
—The Dao generates all things and nurtures them.
It generates without possession.

Act without reliance.
—The Dao’s actions are not done in expectation of return.

Long and yet not domineering.
—The Dao nourishes all things without carving or shaping them for use.

This is called the *playful virtue*.
—The Dao’s virtue is abyssal and unseen,
intended to make people emulate the Way.

The eleventh chapter: *The Use of the Void*
Thirty spokes converge at a single nave.
—Ancient chariots had thirty spokes, following the lunar cycle.
They converge at the nave because the nave’s center is hollow.
Those who govern their bodies must eliminate desires and emotions,
leaving the five *zàng*-organs empty,
so the spirit may return.
Those who govern the state must gather few abilities
and unite the weak to make them strong.

When there is no use, the chariot’s purpose is fulfilled.
—No means emptiness.
The nave’s emptiness allows the chariot to move;
the carriage’s emptiness allows people to ride within.

Mold clay to make a vessel.
—The vessel’s emptiness allows it to hold things.

Pierce walls to make a room.
—This refers to constructing dwellings.
When there is no use, the room’s purpose is fulfilled.
—The walls’ emptiness allows entry and exit;
the room’s emptiness allows habitation—
this is its use.

Thus, having is for utility.
—Utility for things, utility for form.
The vessel holds objects, the room holds people—
lest the house collapse or the body perish,
lest the spirit within fear annihilation.

Without having is for use.
—Emptiness can contain all things,
so the void governs the form.
The Dao is emptiness.

The twelfth chapter: *Restraining Desire*
The five colors blind the eyes.

「――Indulgence in lust and fondness for beauty drains vital essence and causes blindness.
The five tones make one deaf.
—To delight in the five tones disperses harmonious *qi*; the mind loses its ability to hear the sound of the unsounded.

The five flavors make the palate numb.
—*"Numb" means "lost."* When a person craves the five flavors in the mouth, speech is lost, and the taste of the Dao is abandoned.

Hunting and galloping across fields drive the mind to madness.
—Human spirit prefers tranquility; reckless movement scatters vital essence, thus madness ensues.

Rare treasures cause one’s conduct to falter.
—*"Falter" means "injure."* Rare treasures—gold, silver, jade, and pearls—when coveted without restraint, harm the body and bring disgrace.

Thus, the sage cultivates the belly.
—Preserving the five senses while discarding the six emotions, moderating will and nourishing spirit.
Not the eyes.
—The eyes must not gaze wantonly; wanton gazing dissipates essence outward.
Hence, abandon that and embrace this.
—Abandon the eyes’ wanton gazing, embrace the belly’s cultivation of nature.

**Chapter Thirteen: *Aversion to Shame***

Rejoicing and humiliation are like sudden alarm.
—Both honor and disgrace provoke alarm.
Great peril is like a personal affliction.
—*"Honor"* means *"fear."* *"Like"* means *"until."* Fear great peril until it reaches oneself.
Thus, both cause alarm.

What is meant by "rejoicing and humiliation"?
—Asking what constitutes honor and what constitutes humiliation, then reflecting upon oneself to enlighten others.
Humiliation is lowliness.
—Humiliation is base.
To attain it is like alarm.
—To gain honor is alarming, as if standing at the edge of an abyss.
The noble dare not be arrogant; the wealthy dare not be extravagant.
To lose it is like alarm.
—*"Lose"* means *"lose honor, suffer disgrace."* Alarm stems from fearing renewed calamity.
This is called *"rejoicing and humiliation as alarm."*

What is meant by *"great peril is like a personal affliction"*?
—Again asking: why fear others as if they were oneself?
The reason I have great peril is because I have a body.
—The reason I have great peril is that I have a body—its toil brings worry, its hunger and cold provoke emotions, and following desires invites misfortune.
Yet if I have no body, what peril could I have?
—If I were without a body, attaining the Dao would allow effortless ascent, unobstructed movement, and communion with the Way—what peril could there be?

Thus, the noble who values the body for the sake of the world may entrust themselves to the world.
—The ruler who values the body yet despises personal desire, seeking to govern the world, may temporarily establish themselves but cannot endure.

The loving ruler who values the body for the world may be entrusted to the world.
—The ruler who loves the body not for themselves but as a parent to the people may entrust their rule to the people without enduring blame.

**Chapter Fourteen: *Praise of the Mysterious***

It is seen yet unseen—named *Yi*.
—Without color is *Yi*.
It speaks of oneness without hue, invisible yet perceived.

It is heard yet unheard—named *Xi*.
—Without sound is *Xi*.
It speaks of oneness without tone, inaudible yet perceived.

It is grasped yet not obtained—named *Wei*.
—Without form is *Wei*.
It speaks of oneness without substance, unattainable yet sought.

These three cannot be interrogated.
—The three refer to *Yi*, *Xi*, and *Wei*.
What cannot be interrogated: without color, sound, or form, words cannot describe it, script cannot transmit it. It must be received in stillness, sought with spirit—unanswerable yet known.

Thus, they merge into one.
—*"Merge"* means *"unify."*
Thus, they unite under the three names as one.

Above, it is not luminous.
—It speaks of one in the world not shining brightly.
Below, it is not obscure.
—It speaks of one in the world not veiled in darkness.

Endless, nameless.
—*"Endless"* means boundless motion.
*"Nameless"* means not a single color—cannot be distinguished as blue, yellow, white, or black.
Not a single sound—cannot be heard as *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, or *yu*.
Not a single form—cannot be measured by length, shortness, size, or smallness.
It returns to nothingness.
—*"Nothingness"* means *"substance-less."*
This is called *"the form of formlessness."*
The image of the formless.
—One without substance yet shaping all things.
This is called *"elusive and vague."*
—One elusive and vague, as if present yet absent, unseen.

Approach it, yet its head is unseen.
—One has no beginning; it cannot be anticipated.
Abandon emotions, discard desires—return to oneness.

Follow it, yet its end is unseen.
—One leaves no trace; it cannot be observed.
Hold fast to the ancient Way to govern the present.
—The sage upholds the ancient Way, generating oneness to govern things, knowing the present must also return to oneness.

To know the ancient beginning is called the *Dao*’s principle.
—If one knows the ancient origin of oneness, this is called understanding the fundamental structure of the Way.

**Chapter Fifteen: *Manifesting Virtue***

The ancients who excelled as scholars—
—Referring to those who attained the Dao.
Were subtle, mysterious, and penetrating.
—*"Mysterious"* means *"heavenly."* Their resolve was subtle and pure, in harmony with heaven.
Deep beyond comprehension.
—Their virtue was profound and inscrutable; inwardly blind, outwardly deaf, their excellence was unknown.

Because it was beyond comprehension, they feigned its appearance.
—Referring to the following lines.
Their actions were cautious, like winter crossing a river.
—Every deed was weighed with gravity, as if reluctant, like winter’s trepidation in crossing a river.
Their demeanor was hesitant, as if fearing neighbors.
—Their advance and retreat were constrained, like a criminal fearing the scrutiny of others.

**Chapter Sixteen: *Returning to the Root***

Solemn, as if a guest.
—Like a guest fearing his host, dignified and unassuming in all actions.

Dissolved, as if ice about to melt.
—*"Dissolved"* means to disperse; *"melt"* means to vanish.
Abandoning passions, discarding desires, daily emptied of self.

Genuine, as if uncarved wood.
—*"Genuine"* means thick and pure; *"uncarved"* means formless.
Guarding the spirit within, without ornament, unadorned.

Vast, as if a valley.
—*"Vast"* means expansive; *"valley"* means hollow.
Without virtue or fame, yet encompassing all.

Turbulent, as if muddy.
—*"Turbulent"* means steadfast in truth; *"muddy"* means unrefined.
In harmony with the multitude, not self-exalted.

Who can still the muddy and let it settle, slowly clear?
—*"Who"* refers to none but the Dao.

Who can remain still and let motion arise, slowly nurture life?
—*"Who"* refers to none but the Dao.

Those who preserve this Way do not seek fullness.
—For only by not being full can one remain hidden, unadorned.

Only those who are not full can avoid the new and the finished.
—*"Hidden"* means concealing brilliance; *"finished"* means valuing fame.

**Chapter Seventeen: *Returning to the Root* – *Extreme Emptiness***

At its peak, the Sage is known only by his existence.
—The *"Sage"* refers to the nameless ruler of antiquity.
Those below know of his existence but do not serve him in formality, remaining pure and simple.

Next, they cherish and praise him.
—His virtue is visible, his benevolence worthy of praise, so they love and honor him.

Next, they fear him.
—Laws and punishments are established to govern them.

Next, they scorn him.
—Excessive prohibitions and burdens make them lose sincerity, so they mock him.

When the ruler’s trust is insufficient, the people respond with deceit.
—If the ruler lacks integrity, the people answer with dishonesty and deceit.

Thus, the Sage values speech.
—For the Sage of antiquity, even actions are held with reverence, lest they stray from the Dao and lose naturalness.

When deeds are accomplished and affairs settled,
—the land is at peace—
the people say, *"It was only natural."*
—The people do not recognize the Sage’s pure virtue, attributing it merely to fate.

**Chapter Eighteen: *The Decay of Customs***

When the Great Dao is abandoned,仁 *rén* and 義 *yì* arise.
—In the age of the Great Dao, filial sons and loyal subjects were unseen within families.
Only when the Dao is abandoned and wickedness flourishes do仁 *rén* and 義 *yì* become topics of discussion.

When cleverness and cunning emerge, great deceit follows.
—The wise ruler values speech over virtue, form over substance, and the people respond with falsehood and trickery.

When familial bonds fracture,孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* appear.
—When parents and children are estranged,孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* arise to nurture them.

When the state is in chaos, loyal ministers emerge.
—When governance fails, superiors and inferiors clash, and the wicked vie for power, loyal ministers then arise to rectify the ruler.

This is to say: in the age of true peace, there are no virtuous men—
—desires are absent, so purity is unknown;
each cleanses themselves, yet chastity is unrecognized.

The Sage of the Great Dao extinguishes仁 *rén* and 義 *yì*,
—just as at high noon, the sun’s brilliance obscures the stars.
孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí* vanish.

**Chapter Nineteen: *Restoring Primordial Simplicity***

Abandon the Sage’s artifices.
—Reject the Sage’s institutions and return to the origin, as the Five Emperors did before writing was invented.
—Before Cangjie created script, men used knotted cords—no false distinctions.

Discard cleverness.
—Reject cunning and return to non-action.

The people prosper a hundredfold.
—Farming is cultivated, governance is impartial.

Abandon仁 *rén* and 義 *yì*.
—Reject the appearance of benevolence and the pretense of righteousness.

The people return to孝 *xiào* and 慈 *cí*.
—Morality becomes pure and unadorned.

Abandon artifice and discard profit.
—Reject deceitful cleverness that confuses truth.
—Close the paths of greed and shut the gates of power.

Then thieves and robbers will vanish.
—When governance is pure above, corruption cannot take root below.

These three things—
—That is, the three matters above that must be abandoned.

Because writing is insufficient—
—Because writing is insufficient to teach the people,
Thus, one must have what belongs to them.
—As follows below.

*"Seeing the unadorned, embracing the uncarved."*
—*"Seeing the unadorned"* means to hold fast to simplicity and truth, not to adorn with artifice.
—*"Embracing the uncarved"* means to reveal sincerity and plainness to those below, so they may follow as a model.

*"Few desires, little private gain."*
—*"Few desires"* means to correct selfishness by being selfless.
—*"Little private gain"* means to know contentment.

**Chapter Twenty: On the Abandonment of Learning**
—To abandon learning is to reject false teachings that do not align with the Dao.

*"No worries."*
—By removing superficiality, worries vanish.

*"‘Yes’ and ‘Ah’—how far apart are they?"*
—Both are responses, yet how distant they are—
The age despises sincerity and values artifice.

*"Good and evil—how far apart are they?"*
—Good is harmony and praise; evil is contention and strife.
How far apart can they be?
The age despises loyalty and uprightness, favoring flattery and deceit.

*"What people fear, one must fear."*
—People refer to the Dao.
What people fear is the ruler who does not abandon learning.
One must fear this—
For it leads to flattery, killing the virtuous and the wise.

*"How vast and endless it is!"*
—Some say the common people are chaotic, ever striving to learn and adorn themselves without end.

*"The crowd bustles and revels."*
—Bustling means licentious, overflowing with desires.

*"Like feasting on the finest meats."*
—Like a starving man craving the feast of *tài láo*—
Ever hungry, never satisfied.

*"Like springtime ascending a terrace."*
—In spring, yin and yang intermingle, stirring all things—
Ascending the terrace, observing, intoxicated with desire.

*"I alone stand in dread, as yet unmanifest."*
—I alone remain tranquil, without the stirrings of desire.

*"Like an infant before it speaks."*
—Like a child before it can answer questions.

*"Wandering, as if without destination."*
—I wander like a rustic from the remote countryside, nowhere to turn.

*"The crowd all have excess."*
—The crowd has excess wealth for indulgence, excess cleverness for deceit.

*"I alone seem abandoned."*
—I alone seem cast aside, as if lacking.

*"I, the heart of the foolish man."*
—I do not follow the crowd, steadfast in one path, unmoved—
Like the heart of the foolish man.

*"Dim and indistinct."*
—Without distinction.

*"The crowd is bright and clear."*
—Bright and discerning.

*"I alone am dimmed."*
—Like darkness.

*"The crowd is sharp and swift."*
—Swift and hasty.

*"I alone am stifled and still."*
—Stifled, without division.

*"Vast as the sea."*
—I alone drift, vast as the flowing river and sea,
Unknown in its depths.

*"Drifting, as if without end."*
—I alone drift, drifting like wind-borne dust,
Without rest.

*"My purpose dwells in the realm of the spirit."*

*"The crowd all have something to rely on."*
—They rely on artificiality.

While I alone am obstinate.
—I alone do without action.

Seeming vulgar.
—Vulgar, as if deficient.

I alone differ from others.
—I alone differ from people.

Yet I honor the Mother.
—*Food*, meaning *use*.
*Mother*, meaning *Dao*.
I alone honor the use of the Dao.

**Chapter 21: Empty Heart**
The bearing of great virtue.
—*Great*, vast.
Those with great virtue contain all, receive all,
Bear defilement and filth in humility.
Only the Dao is followed.
—*Only*, solely.
Those with great virtue do not follow the customs of the world,
But solely follow the Dao.

The Dao as a thing is elusive and fleeting.
—The Dao, among all things, is elusive and fleeting,
Coming and going without fixed form.

Fleeting and elusive, yet within it there is form.
—The Dao, though fleeting and elusive, is the pattern for all things.

Elusive and fleeting, yet within it there is substance.
—The Dao, though elusive and fleeting, contains the vital *qi* that gives rise to form and transformation.

Mysterious and dark, yet within it there is essence.
—The Dao, though mysterious and dark, contains the refined and luminous interaction of yin and yang.

Its essence is most true.
—Speaking of preserving the essence and *qi*, its subtlety is truly authentic, without ornament.

Within it there is sincerity.
—The Dao conceals its deeds and hides its name; its sincerity lies within.

From ancient times to now, its name does not fade.
—*From*, since.
Since ancient times until now, the Dao remains ever-present.

To observe the origin of all things.
—*Observe*, receive.
*Origin*, beginning.
The Dao receives and gives birth to all things, from which they receive *qi*.

How do I know that all things are thus?
—I know how all things receive *qi* from the Dao.

Because of this.
—*This*, the present.
Because of this, all things receive the Dao’s essence and *qi*,
And thus come to life, move, and act—
Without the Dao, they would not exist.

**Chapter 22: Increased Humility**
Bend, and you remain whole.
—Bend yourself to follow others, not asserting your own will,
And you preserve your integrity.

Crooked, yet straight.
—Though you bend yourself to accommodate others,
Over time, you attain true uprightness.

Low, yet full.
—The lowly receive what the earth holds,
And thus virtue flows to them.

Worn, yet renewed.
—Though you endure hardship and diminish yourself,
Others respect you, and over time you renew.

Take little, yet gain much.
—By taking little, you obtain much.

The Dao aids the humble; the divine trusts the empty.
Take much, and you are confused.
—Those with much wealth are confused by what they possess,
Those with much learning are confused by what they hear.

Thus, the Sage holds to One as the model for all under heaven.
—*Holds*, guards.
The Sage guards the One and thereby knows all things,
And so can serve as the model.

Not seeing oneself, one becomes clear.
—The Sage does not gaze beyond what the eye can see,
But uses the vision of all under heaven,
And thus becomes enlightened.

Not asserting oneself, one becomes manifest.
—The Sage does not insist on being right while others are wrong,
And thus becomes illustrious in the world.

Not praising oneself, one achieves merit.
—*Praise*, take.
The Sage’s virtue spreads without taking credit,
And thus achieves merit for all under heaven.

Not boasting, one endures.
—*Boast*, magnify.
The Sage does not exalt themselves,
And thus endure without peril.

Only by not contending does one surpass all contention.
—This means that under heaven, neither the virtuous nor the unvirtuous
Can contend with one who does not contend.

Was it not true that the ancients said,
*"Bend, and you remain whole"*?
Was this not a sincere saying?
—*Sincere*, real.
Those who truly practice bending and following
Return to their roots without harm,
And preserve their bodies for their parents.

**Chapter 23: Empty and Void**
Rarely speaking, returning to nature.

*—Rarely speaking is to love speech.
To love speech is the Way of nature.
A gusting wind does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
—*Gusting wind*, swift wind.
*Sudden rain*, violent rain.
Swift speech cannot endure,
Violence cannot last.
Who does this?
—Who makes the gusting wind and sudden rain?
It is the work of Heaven and Earth.
—Heaven and Earth cannot endure long.
—They do not last from morning to evening.
How much less can mortals?
—Heaven and Earth, though most divine, cannot make gusting winds and sudden rains last from morning to evening—how much less can mortals strive to be violent and hasty?

Thus, those who follow the Dao
—*Follow*, act in accordance with.
Should act like the Dao—calm, not like gusting winds and sudden rains.
Those who align with the Dao
—*Those who align with the Dao*, those who love the Dao, are said to be "in accord with the Dao."
Align with virtue
—*Virtue*, those who love virtue.
Those who align with virtue are said to be "in accord with virtue."
Align with loss
—*Loss*, those who rely on self and lose others.
Those who align with loss are said to be "in accord with loss."
Those who align with the Dao, the Dao delights in them.
—Those in accord with the Dao, the Dao also delights in them.
Those who align with virtue, virtue delights in them.
—Those in accord with virtue, virtue also delights in them.
Those who align with loss, loss delights in them.
—Those in accord with loss, loss also delights in them.

Trust is insufficient here.
—The ruler’s trust is insufficient with the people, and the people respond with insufficiency.
There is no trust here.
—This speaks of things of like kind returning to one another, voices resonating together:
Dragons gather dragons, winds follow tigers,
Water flows to moisture, fire seeks dryness—
Thus is the nature of things.

**Chapter 24: The Gratitude of Bitterness**
*The stiff-legged cannot stand.*

「――*Dà* (跂), this is *jìn* (进).
—To say that those who covet power and crave fame seek advancement in功 and荣, yet this cannot establish them firmly in body or Dao/Way.
Those who *kuà* (跨) cannot proceed.
—They deem themselves noble and thus *kuà* (跨) over the people, making them unable to move forward.

Those who *zì jiàn* (自见) are blind.
—People see their own appearance and deem it good, see their own actions and believe them in accord with the Dao/Way, yet they do not know their own ugliness or the vulgarity of their conduct.

Those who *zì shì* (自是) are not illuminated.
—They believe themselves correct yet contradict others, and the people obstruct them so they cannot shine forth.

Those who *zì fá* (自伐) have no merit.
—When they boast of their own achievements and beautify their own merits, they lose the true merit they hold for others.

Those who *zì jīn* (自矜) do not endure.
—Those who love to boast of their own greatness cannot last long.
In terms of the Dao/Way, they are called *yúshí* (余食) and *zhuāngxíng* (赘行).
—*Zhuāng* (赘), this is *tān* (贪). Those who indulge in self-praise and boastful actions in governing the state are said to consume surplus *shí* (食) and engage in superfluous *xíng* (行).
Thus, many revile them.
—Such people, when in office, act arbitrarily and harm others, so nothing they do escapes censure.

Hence, those who follow the Dao/Way do not dwell there.
—This means those who follow the Dao/Way do not remain in such a state.

**Chapter 25: The Symbol of the Undefinable**
There is something mixed and complete, born before Heaven and Earth.
—This refers to the Dao/Way, which is formless yet gives rise to all things, existing before Heaven and Earth.

Silent and boundless, it stands alone yet never alters.
—Silent, it has no sound or voice; boundless, it is empty and formless.
Standing alone, it has no equal or pair.
Not altering, its transformations are constant.

It moves in cycles yet never falters.
—The Dao/Way pervades Heaven and Earth without exclusion, in the sun it does not wither, in the shade it does not decay—it penetrates everywhere without danger or peril.

It can be the mother of all under Heaven.
—The Dao/Way nourishes all things; their essence and *qi* are like a mother nurturing her child.

I do not know its name—it is called the Dao/Way.
—I do not see its form or appearance; I know not how else to name it. Observing that all things arise from it, I call it the Dao/Way.

If forced to name it, I would say *Dà* (大).
—*Dà* (大) is vast yet without limit, encompassing yet without boundary, containing all without exclusion.

*Dà* (大) is said to be *shì* (逝).
—Its greatness is not like Heaven’s permanence above nor Earth’s steadfastness below; rather, it departs and has no fixed place.

*Shì* (逝) is said to be *yuǎn* (远).
—Farness speaks of the boundless, its *qi* pervading Heaven and Earth without obstruction.

*Yuǎn* (远) is said to be *fǎn* (反).
—Though far, it does not vanish utterly but returns to the human body.

Thus, the Dao/Way is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, the King is great.
—The Dao/Way’s greatness encompasses all Heaven and Earth without limit.
Heaven’s greatness covers all without exclusion.
Earth’s greatness bears all without constraint.
The King’s greatness governs all without tyranny.

Within the *yù* (域) are the Four Great.
—The Four Great are the Dao/Way, Heaven, Earth, and the King.
All that has a title or name is not its ultimate expression.
The Dao/Way has origins, and only when it has origins can it be called the Dao/Way. Thus, this is the Dao/Way among the Four Great.
It is not as great as the Dao/Way without title.

The Dao/Way without title cannot be named as *yù* (域).
—Heaven, Earth, and the King all exist within the Dao/Way without title.
Thus, it is said that within the *yù* (域) are the Four Great, and the King is one of them.
—Within the Eight Extremes, the Four Great exist, and the King is one of them.

Humans emulate Earth.
—Humans should emulate Earth’s tranquility, gentleness, and yielding.
When planted, it yields the Five Grains; when dug, it produces sweet springs.
It labors yet does not complain, has merit yet does not dominate.

Earth emulates Heaven.
—Heaven is serene and motionless, giving yet seeking no recompense, fostering and growing all things without taking anything back.

Heaven emulates the Dao/Way.
—The Dao/Way is pure and silent, acting without speech, its subtle *qi* forming all things naturally.

The Dao/Way emulates *zìrán* (自然).
—The Dao/Way’s nature is *zìrán* (自然); it follows nothing external.

**Chapter 26: The Weight of Virtue**
*Chóng* (重) is the root of *qīng* (轻).
—When the ruler does not hold virtue in high regard, it is not honored. In governing oneself, if virtue is not cherished, the spirit is lost. Flowers of grasses and trees are light, so they wither and fall; roots are heavy, so they endure long.

*Jìng* (静) is the master of *zào* (躁).
—If the ruler is not tranquil, authority is lost. In governing oneself, if one is not tranquil, the body is in peril. The dragon is tranquil, thus able to transform; the tiger is restless, thus its life is cut short.

Thus, the Sage acts daily without departing from *zīzhòng* (辎重).
—*Zī* (辎), this is *jìng* (静). The Sage, in following the Dao/Way, never leaves his stillness and weight.

Though adorned with splendor and resorts, he remains detached and aloof.
—*Róngguàn* (荣观) refers to palaces and halls (宫卦, 上加门); *yànchù* (燕处) is where the queen consorts.
Detached, he avoids them far and does not dwell there.

How can the sovereign of ten thousand chariots do otherwise?

「――*Nàihé* (奈何), this is the language of lamenting the ruler’s suffering and pain. The *wànchéng zhǔ* (万乘之主) refers to the king.
Yet he lightens himself against the world.
—The king, though supreme, acts with his body in lightness and restlessness toward the world.

*Cìshí* (疾时) means the king indulges in excessive luxury and licentiousness.
Lightness leads to losing his ministers.
—If the king acts in lightness and dissipation, he loses his ministers.
If he dissipates his own body, he loses his vital essence.

Restlessness leads to losing his throne.
—If the king acts in haste and impetuosity, he loses his royal authority.
If he agitates his own body, he loses his spirit and vitality.

**Chapter 27: *Qiaoyòng* (巧用)**
The Sage moves without leaving tracks.
—The Sage who follows the Dao/Way seeks it within himself, never descending from his hall nor stepping beyond his door, thus leaving no tracks.

His words are without flaw or censure.
—Good speech is the careful selection of words before they are spoken, so they bear no blemish or fault and transcend all reproach.

His plans do not require schemings.
—The Sage who calculates with the Dao/Way adheres to one principle without deviation; his plans are few, so he needs no schemings or strategies to discern them.

His closing is without locks yet cannot be opened.
—The Sage who closes his emotions and desires with the Dao/Way does so not like doors and gates that can be unlocked, but with a steadfastness that cannot be breached.

His binding is without cords yet cannot be undone.
—The Sage who binds matters with the Dao/Way does so with the heart, not like ropes that can be severed.

Thus, the Sage is always the savior of men.
—The Sage constantly teaches loyalty and filial piety to save men from their fate.
Hence, he abandons no one.
—He ensures that nobles and commoners each find their proper place.

Always the savior of things.
—The Sage teaches the people to follow the four seasons to save all things from harm.
Hence, he abandons nothing.

He does not demean stone nor honor jade, viewing them as one.
This is called *xímíng* (袭明).
—The Sage’s skill in saving men and things is to embrace the luminous Dao/Way.
Thus, the good man is not the teacher of the unworthy.
—The Sage takes those who practice goodness as his disciples.

The unworthy are the material for the good.
—*Zī* (资) means "use." Though a man may be unworthy, the Sage still guides him to goodness, that he may be put to use.

He does not regard his teacher as precious.
—He lacks no aid.

He does not cherish his material.
—He has no means to employ them.

Though wise, he is greatly deluded.
—Though he may consider himself wise, such a man is in great confusion.

This is called *yàomiào* (要妙).
—To grasp this meaning is to know the subtle and essential Dao/Way.

**Chapter 28: *Fǎnpǔ* (反朴)**
Know its male and guard its female, and you become the valley of the world.
—Male signifies the exalted; female, the humble. Though a man knows his own exaltation, he must guard it with humility, yielding to the weak and gentle. As he does so, the world flows toward him like water into a deep valley.

To be the valley of the world is to have virtue ever constant.
—He who remains humble like a deep valley has virtue that never departs from him.

Returning to the state of the infant.
—He constantly returns to the simplicity of an infant, guileless yet knowing nothing.

Know its white and guard its black, and you become the model of the world.
—White signifies clarity; black, obscurity. Though a man knows his own clarity, he must guard it with obscurity, like darkness that conceals nothing. As he does so, he becomes the model for the world, and virtue remains with him.

To be the model of the world is to have virtue ever unerring.
—He who becomes the model for the world has virtue that never strays.

Returning to the state of the *wújí* (无极).
—When virtue does not stray, it leads to eternal life and boundless longevity, returning the body to the limitless.

Know its honor and guard its humiliation, and you become the valley of the world.
—Honor signifies nobility; humiliation, filth. Though a man knows his own nobility, he must guard it with filth, like a deep ravine. As he does so, the world flows toward him like water into a deep valley.

To be the valley of the world is to have virtue ever complete.
—Complete, here, means "cessation." He who becomes the valley of the world has virtue that ceases not within him.

Returning to the state of *pǔ* (朴).
—He must return to the simplicity of his own nature, unadorned by artificiality.

*Pǔ* (朴) scattered becomes the vessel.
—When the simplicity of all things is scattered, they become useful implements.
If the Dao/Way is scattered, it becomes the manifestation of the *shénmíng* (神明), flowing as the sun and moon, dividing into the Five Phases.

The Sage employs them as officials and leaders.
—The Sage, in ascending to use them, becomes the chief of all officials.

Thus, the great measure does not cut.
—The Sage, in governing with the great Dao/Way, does not harm the world.
In cultivating himself, he governs his desires with the Dao of Heaven, not harming his spirit.

**Chapter 29: *Wúwéi* (无为)**
If one wishes to take the world,
—To desire to be the ruler of the world—

And yet acts to do so,
—To govern the people with contrivance—

I see that he cannot achieve it.
—I see that he has not yet understood the Dao of Heaven and the hearts of men.
Heaven’s Dao abhors turmoil and filth; men’s hearts abhor excessive desires.

The world is a divine vessel, not to be governed by contrivance.
—Vessel (*qì* 器) refers to things. Man is the divine vessel of the world.
Divine vessels prefer tranquility and cannot be governed by contrivance.

To act is to ruin it.
—To govern with contrivance spoils its natural essence.

To grasp is to lose it.
—To forcefully impose teachings upon men is to lose their true nature, giving rise to deceit and falsehood.

Thus, things either act or follow.
—When the superior acts, the inferior must follow.

Either warm or chill.
—Warm (*wěn* 温) and chill (*chuī* 吹) are opposites. Where there is warmth, there must also be chill.

Either strong or weak.
—Where there is strength, there must also be weakness.

Either bear or destroy.
—Bear (*zài* 载) means "to support"; destroy (*huī* 隳) means "to endanger." Where there is support, there must also be peril.

This shows that the ruler of men cannot govern the world or himself by contrivance.
Thus, the Sage avoids excess, avoids extravagance, avoids presumption.

---

The extreme is gluttony for sensual pleasures.
—*Vain* (甚) refers to excess in sensual indulgence.

Extravagance is in attire, food, and drink.
—*Extravagance* (奢) pertains to elaborate clothing, sumptuous food, and excessive drink.

Presumption is in palaces and pavilions.
—*Presumption* (泰) refers to grandiose palaces and ornamental towers.

To abandon these three, to dwell in moderation, to act without contrivance—then the world will transform itself naturally.

**Chapter 30: *Jian* (俭, Frugality) – The Third**
To assist the sovereign with the Dao
—That is, for the sovereign to reinforce himself with the Dao.

Not to coerce the world with arms.
—The sovereign who aids himself with the Dao does not rely on military might; instead, he aligns with Heaven, trusts in virtue, and the enemy submits of its own accord.

His undertakings are met with favor and return.
—His actions are met with reciprocity; he bears no resentment toward others.

Where the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow.
—Agricultural labor is neglected; fields lie unplowed.

After great armies, there are years of calamity.
—Heaven responds with malevolent *qi*, harming the five grains. The five grains are all damaged, and the people suffer.

The skilled warrior is decisive.
—The adept in warfare must be resolute and not hesitate.

Yet he does not seek strength through force.
—He does not claim strength as a virtue.

Decisive yet unboastful.
—He acts decisively but remains humble, not arrogant.

Decisive yet not self-praising.
—He acts decisively yet defers praise, lest he take credit for himself.

Decisive yet not proud.
—Pride is deceit. He acts decisively without deceiving others.

Decisive yet without compulsion.
—He acts decisively with sincerity, not out of coercion.

Decisive yet not domineering.
—He acts decisively without relying on brute force, heavy armor, or aggression against others.

When things reach their peak, they decline.
—Grasses and trees, at their height, wither and fall. Humans, at their peak, grow old and decay.

Thus, those who speak of strength cannot remain vigorous.
—This is called *not-Dao*.

Not-Dao leads to early ruin.
—Those who do not follow the Dao perish young.

**Chapter 31: *Yan* (偃, Laying Down Arms)**
Fine arms are an inauspicious instrument.
—*Conflicting* (祥) means "auspicious." Arms disturb the spirit, disrupt harmonious *qi*, and are an instrument of the unvirtuous.

They should not be adorned.
—When arms are wielded, harm is inevitable; all things resist them.

Thus, those who possess the Dao do not dwell upon them.
—The virtuous do not reside in lands of war.

The gentleman, in peace, values the left.
—The left represents the yielding and weak.

In war, he values the right.
—The right represents the strong and resolute.

This shows that the Way of arms and the Way of the gentleman are opposites, and what they value differs.

Arms are an inauspicious instrument.
—Arms are an unvirtuous tool.

They are not the instrument of the gentleman.
—They are not held in esteem by the virtuous.

They are used only when unavoidable.
—That is, when faced with decline, rebellion, or calamity threatening the people, they are employed for self-defense.

Serenity and tranquility are supreme.
—*Tranquility* (惔) is alternatively read as *ran* (然). The ideal is to not covet land, people, or treasure.

Victory is not glorified.
—Even if victorious, one does not take it as personal gain.

Those who glorify victory delight in killing.
—To rejoice in victory is to delight in slaughter.

He who delights in killing cannot achieve his aims in the world.
—For a ruler to take pleasure in killing is to act tyrannically, executing at will. This cannot be tolerated in the world.

Auspicious rites favor the left.
—The left is the position of life.

Inauspicious rites favor the right.
—The right aligns with the *yin* path of death.

The *Pian* (偏) General resides on the left.
—The *Pian* General, though lowly, occupies the *yang* position because he does not wield absolute authority over life and death.

The *Shang* (上) General resides on the right.
—The *Shang* General, being honored, occupies the right, signifying his role in execution.

This is treated with funeral rites.
—The *Shang* General, on the right, follows funeral customs, as death is honored with *yin*.

The multitude of slain are mourned with sorrowful weeping.
—This reflects a ruler’s moral failing—his inability to transform others through virtue, leading to the slaughter of the innocent.

Victory is treated with funeral rites.
—In antiquity, victorious generals observed mourning rites, occupying the funeral position. They wore plain mourning attire and wept, demonstrating that the virtuous value morality over warfare and do not rejoice in bloodshed. They grieve because they foresee future wars.

**Chapter 32: *Sheng* (圣, Sacred Virtue)**
The Dao is ever nameless.
—The Dao manifests as both *yin* and *yang*, expands and contracts, preserves and destroys; thus, it has no fixed name.

Though crude and simple, it is not subdued by the world.
—The Dao, though subtle and formless, is so profound that the world dare not enslave it.

If lords and kings could uphold it, all things would submit of their own accord.
—If lords and kings could preserve the Dao and act without contrivance, all things would naturally revere and obey their virtue.

Heaven and Earth unite, and sweet dew descends.
—When a ruler’s actions harmonize with Heaven, auspicious signs appear, such as the descent of sweet dew.

The people govern themselves without command.
—When Heaven bestows blessings, no orders are needed; all things naturally align in balance.

Only then does naming begin.
—*Beginning* (始) refers to the Dao. *Naming* refers to all things. The Dao, though nameless, governs the named; the formless governs the formed.

Once names are established,
—*Established* (既) means "exhausted." Once all things have names, they develop desires and stray from the Dao, losing their virtue, and thus bring ruin upon themselves.

Heaven will know this.
—If a person abandons the Dao and pursues virtue, Heaven will recognize it.

This is how one avoids peril.
—Heaven’s recognition brings divine protection, ensuring safety.

The Dao in the world is like rivers and valleys to the sea.
—The Dao’s relationship with the world is akin to how rivers and valleys flow into the sea.

**Chapter 33: *Bian* (辩, Discerning Virtue)**
To know others is wisdom.

「――To know others’ joys and dislikes is wisdom.
To know oneself is clarity. ――When a person can know themselves and discern their virtues and faults, this is called *reflection without sound* (反听无声) and *introspection without form* (内视无形), hence clarity.

To overcome others is strength.
――To overcome others is merely to rely on force.

To overcome oneself is might. ――When a person can conquer their own desires and passions, none in the world can contend with them, hence might.

To know contentment is wealth. ――When a person knows contentment as contentment, they long preserve blessings and fortune, hence wealth.

To act resolutely is to have resolve. ――When a person exerts strength to do good, they have resolve in the Dao, and the Dao also responds to them.

To remain steadfast in one’s place is longevity. ――When a person can regulate themselves and not lose their natural state, they receive Heaven’s *essence-qi* (精气), thus enduring long.

To die without perishing is long life. ――With eyes not gazing wantonly, ears not listening recklessly, and mouth not speaking falsely, they incur no grievance in the world, hence great longevity.

**Chapter 34: *Ren Cheng* (任成, Surrendering Fulfilment)**
When one holds to the great *image* (大象) — the Dao —
――*Holds* (执) means to uphold; *image* (象) refers to the Dao. The Sage upholds the great Dao, and thus all people in the world turn their hearts toward it.
the world turns to it,
――*Image* (象) also signifies the manifestation of Heaven’s *spirit-light* (神明). When the Sage governs their own person, Heaven sends its spirit-light to dwell with them.
and yet no harm is done — peace and tranquillity prevail.
――When all things turn to it without injury, the state is secure, the family harmonious, and great peace is achieved.
When one governs their person without harming Heaven’s spirit-light, their body is at ease and their life prolonged.

Like music and bait, the wandering guest will stay.
――*Bait* (饵) means allurement; the *wandering guest* (过客) is one who lingers. When a person finds delight in the allurement of the Dao, they remain steadfast.
The steadfast one departs from excess and dwells in simplicity, drifting like a wandering guest.
The Dao’s utterance is insipid, lacking taste.
――The Dao enters and exits through speech, yet it is bland and not like the five flavors — sour, bitter, sweet, salty, or pungent.
To gaze upon it is insufficient to see.
――*Sufficient* (足) here means virtue. The Dao is formless and cannot be perceived like the five colors — green, yellow, red, white, or black.
To listen to it is insufficient to hear.
――The Dao is not like the five tones — *gong* (宫), *shang* (商), *jue* (角), *zhi* (征), or *yu* (羽) — that can be heard.
To use it is without exhaustion.
――Using the Dao to govern a state brings security and prosperity to the people; using it to govern oneself prolongs life without end.

**Chapter 36: *Wei Ming* (微明, Subtle Clarity)**
When one is about to contract (翕),
――Those who first expand (张) excessively will later seek to contract.
they must first solidify its expansion.
――Those who first strengthen (强) excessively will later seek to weaken.
When one is about to weaken,
――Those who first rise (兴) excessively will later seek to decline.
they must first solidify its decline.
――Those who first give (与) excessively will later seek to take away.
When one is about to take away,
――This is called *subtle clarity* (微明).
the soft and weak prevail over the hard and strong.
――The soft and weak endure long, while the hard and strong perish first.
Fish cannot be plucked from the depths.
――When fish are plucked from the depths, they lose their strength and cannot be controlled again.

The state’s sharpest tools should not be displayed to the people.
――*Sharpest tools* (利器) are the implements of governance. When governing a state, the ruler should not reveal their methods to officials.
When governing oneself, the Dao should not be shown to those unworthy.

**Chapter 37: *Zhi Zheng* (治政, Governing by the Dao)**
The Dao is ever without action.
――The Dao abides in non-action (无为) as its constant principle.
Yet it is without failing to act.
――If rulers can uphold the Dao, all things will naturally transform and benefit them.
When transformation is complete and yet they wish to act,
I shall restrain them with the *primordial simplicity* (无名之朴).
――*I* (吾) refers to the Dao. The Dao, through transformation, benefits them.
If they again wish to act with cunning and deceit,
the ruler should restrain them with virtue.
The Dao, the *primordial simplicity*, will also not desire to act.
――The Dao, through virtue, restrains them, and the people will also not desire to act. The ruler should guide them with purity and stillness.
The world will then settle itself.
――Those who act thus will bring the world to order and peace.

**Chapter 38: *Lun De* (论德, Discussing Virtue)**
The highest virtue does not claim virtue.
――The highest virtue refers to the ancient sovereigns without titles, whose virtue was boundless and supreme, hence the term *highest virtue*.
To not claim virtue means they did not teach virtue to the people, but followed nature’s course, nurturing life and preserving it, their virtue unseen, hence not claiming it.
Thus they truly had virtue.
――Their virtue harmonized with Heaven and Earth, blending with the *flowing qi* (和气), and the people were thereby preserved whole.

The lower virtue does not lose virtue.

The lower virtue refers to the titled and posthumously honored sovereigns, whose virtue does not reach the highest, hence the term *lower virtue*.
To not lose virtue means their virtue is visible, and their achievements are worthy of praise.
Thus they truly have virtue.
――Because of their titles and their own persons.

The highest virtue acts without action.
――This means following the Dao in stillness, making no alterations.
Yet it is without contrivance.
――Meaning they do not rely on titles.

The lower virtue acts with contrivance.
――Meaning they issue teachings and govern affairs.
Yet it is with contrivance.
――Meaning they rely on titles for their own sake.

The highest benevolence acts with benevolence.
――The highest benevolence refers to the sovereigns who practice benevolence supremely, hence the term *highest benevolence*.
To act with benevolence means to bestow kindness.
Yet it is without contrivance.
――When deeds are accomplished and affairs established, they do not cling to them.

The highest righteousness acts with righteousness.
――This means enforcing righteousness through judgment and severance.
Yet it is with contrivance.
――Meaning they act to kill men and establish awe, tax the people, and enrich themselves.

The highest ritual acts with ritual.
――The highest ritual refers to the sovereigns whose ritual is supreme, hence the term *highest ritual*.
To act with ritual means to establish ritual institutions, order, and ceremonial decorum.
Yet none respond to it.
――Meaning ritual, though ornate, is inwardly decayed, and excessive formality leads to falsehood and turmoil, thus straying from the Dao and being unanswered.
Then they bare their arms and force compliance.
――Meaning excessive formality provokes contention between ruler and people, so they resort to coercion.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises.
――Meaning when the Dao declines, virtuous governance emerges.
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises.
――Meaning when virtue declines, expressions of kindness appear.
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises.
――Meaning when benevolence declines, distinctions of right and wrong become clear.
When righteousness is lost, ritual arises.
――Meaning when righteousness declines, ritual is applied—bestowing gifts and conducting ceremonies.
Ritual, however, is the thinnest expression of loyalty and trust.
――Meaning when ritual is practiced, its essence—loyalty and trust—becomes increasingly shallow.
And it is the beginning of chaos.
――Meaning ritual values form over substance, so uprightness diminishes while deceit and disorder grow.
Pretense of knowledge is the superficial aspect of the Dao.
――Meaning to speak of knowledge without true understanding is the outward show of the Dao.
And the origin of folly.
――Meaning those who rely on such pretense are the first to lead others into ignorance.

Thus, the true sage dwells in substance.
――The true sage refers to the sovereign who embodies the Dao.
To dwell in substance means to abide in sincerity and simplicity.
Not to dwell in superficiality.
――Meaning not to dwell in what contradicts the Dao, causing worldly turmoil.
To dwell in reality.
――Meaning to uphold loyalty and trust.
Not to dwell in pretense.
――Meaning not to indulge in empty words.
Thus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.
――Discarding superficiality and embracing substance.

**Chapter 39: *Fa Ben* (法本, The Foundation of Principles)**
In ancient times, those who attained the One.
――"Ancient" means the past. The One is the child of the Dao of non-action.
Heaven, attaining the One, becomes clear.
――Meaning Heaven, attaining the One, thus manifests its forms in clarity.
Earth, attaining the One, becomes tranquil.
――Meaning Earth, attaining the One, thus remains stable and does not sway.
The Spirit, attaining the One, becomes numinous.
――Meaning the Spirit, attaining the One, thus manifests its transformative power without form.
The Valley, attaining the One, becomes full.
――Meaning the Valley, attaining the One, thus remains full without depletion.
All things, attaining the One, come to life.
――Meaning all things depend on the Dao to manifest.
The feudal lords and kings, attaining the One, make the world upright.
――Meaning the feudal lords and kings, attaining the One, thus establish order in the world.

If they push it to its limit:
Heaven, without clarity, would fear collapse.
――Meaning Heaven must balance yin and yang, day and night—if it only seeks clarity without moderation, it would fear fragmentation and cease to be Heaven.
Earth, without tranquility, would fear eruption.
――Meaning Earth must balance high and low, firm and yielding, the five phases—if it only seeks stillness without moderation, it would fear upheaval and cease to be Earth.
The Spirit, without numinosity, would fear exhaustion.
――Meaning the Spirit must cycle through kingship, ministers, imprisonment, death, rest, and decay—if it only seeks vitality without moderation, it would fear depletion and cease to be Spirit.
The Valley, without fullness, would fear exhaustion.
――Meaning the Valley must balance fullness and emptiness—if it only seeks abundance without moderation, it would fear depletion and cease to be the Valley.
All things, without life, would fear annihilation.
――Meaning all things must follow the cycles of birth and death—if they only seek life without moderation, they would fear extinction and cease to be things.
The feudal lords and kings, without humility, would fear ruin.
――Meaning the feudal lords and kings must humble themselves and serve the people—if they only seek exaltation without moderation, they would fear downfall and lose their position.

Thus, nobility must take humility as its foundation.
――Meaning true nobility must root itself in what is lowly; like Yu and Shi who tilled the fields, or Shun who worked with Yao, or the Duke of Zhou who lived in humble dwellings.
Exaltation must take humility as its base.
――Meaning true elevation must be built upon what is lowly, just as walls are constructed by first digging foundations—without a firm base, even the highest structures will eventually collapse.

Thus, the feudal lords and kings refer to themselves as "lonely and bereft," unable to be the hub of all spokes.
――"Lonely" signifies isolation; "bereft" signifies inability to unite all like the hub of a wheel.
Is this not taking humility as the foundation?
――Meaning even the most exalted rulers acknowledge their dependence on humility.
This is to enlighten the people.
――Is it not so?

――Lamenting words. Hence, when many parts are gathered without a name, they become a chariot.
――"Gathered" means brought together. When people bring together spokes, wheels, hubs, crossbars, and carriages, there is no name for them as a chariot—yet they are called a chariot. Thus, it is to enlighten the feudal lords and kings: they do not name themselves with exalted titles, yet they achieve their nobility.

Do not desire brilliance like jade,
nor coarseness like stone.
――"Brilliance" signifies scarcity;
"coarseness" signifies abundance.
Jade is scarce, hence its nobility;
stone is abundant, hence its lowliness.
Meaning, one should not desire to be like jade, prized by others,
nor like stone, despised by others—
rather, one should dwell in moderation.

**Chapter Forty: The Way’s Movement is Return**
――Returning to the origin. The origin is the Way by which all things are generated.
――Generation gives rise to all things; abandoning it leads to their extinction.
The Way’s use is in the weak.
――The Way habitually employs softness and weakness, hence its enduring power.
All things under heaven are born from the existent.
――All things arise from Heaven and Earth, which have form and position—hence, "born from the existent."
The existent is born from the nonexistent.
――Heaven and Earth, subtle and luminous,
where insects dart and worms wriggle—
all these arise from the Way.
The Way is formless, hence "born from the nonexistent."
This says the origin surpasses ornamentation,
the weak surpass the strong,
and humility surpasses fullness.

**Chapter Forty-One: The Way of Uniformity and Diversity**
The superior man, hearing the Way, strives to practice it.
――The superior man, hearing the Way, exerts himself earnestly, as if straining all his strength to follow it.
The middle man, hearing the Way, holds it lightly, as if it might vanish.
――The middle man, hearing the Way, applies it to self-cultivation for longevity,
and to governance for lasting peace—
his joyful adherence may falter
when tempted by wealth, desire, or honor,
and he may then abandon it.
The inferior man, hearing the Way, laughs at it.
――The inferior man, greedy and desiring much,
sees the Way’s softness as terrifying,
its plainness as vulgar—
hence, he laughs at it.
Not to laugh is not sufficient for the Way.
――If the Way is not mocked by the inferior man, it cannot be named as the Way.
Thus, I set forth these paradoxes:
――*Setting forth* means establishing.
Establishing words to illustrate the Way, as in the following:

The enlightened man appears as if in darkness.
――The man who understands the Way seems as if he sees nothing.
The one who advances the Way appears as if retreating.
――He who pursues the Way seems to fall behind.
The one who smooths the Way appears as if conforming to others.
――*Smoothing* means making plain.
The man of great Way does not distinguish himself;
he follows the multitude.
The man of supreme virtue appears as if in a valley.
――The man of supreme virtue does not scorn filth and humiliation,
but remains in the depths like a valley.
Great purity appears as if in shame.
――The man of great purity does not flaunt his cleanliness,
but seems stained like one who has labored.
Ample virtue appears as if insufficient.
――The man of vast virtue seems as if lacking,
not boasting of his attainments.
Establishing virtue appears as if hollow.
――The man who establishes virtue seems as if it could be stolen,
his integrity not fully realized.
Plain truth appears as if tainted.
――The plain and true man seems as if his colors have faded,
his meaning obscured.
The man of great harmony has no angles.
――The man of perfect harmony has no crookedness or sharp edges.
Great vessels are fashioned late.
――Great vessels, like the Nine Cauldrons and the jade stands,
cannot be rushed to completion.
Great sound is rare in voice.
――Great sound, like thunder waiting its moment,
is often silent, its voice scarce.
Great image is formless.
――The man of great law and image is plain and unadorned,
his essence without outward shape.
The Way is hidden and nameless.
――The Way is subtle and concealed,
so that men cannot point to it and name it.

Only the Way is good at lending,
and it is certain to repay.
――*Repay* means fulfill.
The Way lends its vital *qi* to all,
and it is certain to bring them to fruition.

**Chapter Forty-Two: The Way’s Transformation**
The Way gives birth to One.
――The Way’s first generation is One.
One generates Two.
――One generates Yin and Yang.
Two generates Three.
――Yin and Yang generate harmonious *qi*;
the Way’s Three *qi* then divide into Heaven, Earth, and Man.
Three generates the Ten Thousand Things.
――Heaven and Earth together give birth to the Ten Thousand Things.
Heaven bestows, Earth transforms,
and Man nurtures them.
All things under heaven carry Yin within them
and embrace Yang.
――All things without fail lean toward Yin and seek Yang,
their hearts returning to the sun.
The interplay of *qi* brings harmony.
――Within all things, there is vital *qi*—
when it is balanced and gentle,
it is like a hidden bone within the chest,
or marrow within the spine,
or the void within plants—
this *qi* flows freely, hence their enduring life.

What men detest is the "Lonely and Bereft" (孤寡不毂),
yet kings and nobles take it as their name.
――"Lonely and Bereft" (孤寡不毂) is an ominous title,
yet kings and nobles adopt it—
for they dwell in the law of humility,
emptiness, harmony, and gentleness.
Thus, some things may be diminished
yet still grow stronger.
――If one pulls, it must return;
if one pushes, it must still revert.
Or some things may be increased
yet still grow weaker.
――He who raises himself too high will crumble;
he who hoards wealth will invite disaster.
This is what men are taught.
――The masses are taught to discard weakness for strength,
and softness for rigidity.
I too teach this—
but in reverse:
――I teach men to discard strength for weakness,
and rigidity for softness.

The strong and rigid will not meet their end.
――The strong and rigid are those who do not trust in the mysterious,
who defy the Way and do not follow its teachings,
but rely on power and force.
They will not die a natural death—
for Heaven will cut them off,
weapons will strike them down,
and the law will execute them.
I shall make this my first lesson.
――*Lesson* means beginning.
Laozi takes the strong and rigid as the starting point for teaching.

**Chapter Forty-Three: Universal Application**
The softest thing under heaven
overcomes the hardest thing under heaven.
――The softest is water;
the hardest is metal and stone.
Water can penetrate hardness,
enter rigidity—
nothing it cannot pass through.
It has no gaps in its passage.
――*It* refers to the Way.
The Way, being formless and without substance,
can enter and exit without obstruction,
penetrating the spirit and sustaining all life.
Thus, I know the benefits of *wuwei*.
――I see that the Way’s *wuwei* allows all things to transform naturally—
hence, I know the benefits of *wuwei* for men.

The teaching that is not spoken.
――The Way’s teaching is not given in words,
but through example.
The benefits of *wuwei*.
――The Way’s teaching of *wuwei* brings benefit:
to self-cultivation through spiritual refinement,
to governance through blessing the people—
without exertion or trouble.

「Few in the world can attain it.
――The ruler of the world.
Few can achieve the Way’s *wuwei* in self-cultivation and governance.

**Chapter Forty-Four: Establishing Precepts**
*Which is closer to the body: fame or self?*
――Fame flourishes, yet the body declines.
*The body or wealth: which is more abundant?*
――Wealth multiplies, yet it harms the body.
*Gain or loss: which brings greater suffering?*
――Clinging to profit brings suffering in conduct.
*The more one loves, the greater the expenditure.*
――Excessive love of color drains one’s spirit,
excessive love of wealth invites calamity.
The more one cherishes, the more one loses—
thus, the greater the expenditure.
*The more one hoards, the more one perishes.*
――In life, wealth is stored in treasuries;
in death, it is buried in graves.
Living brings the worry of *gongjie* (功劫, "taxation and labor"),
dying brings the woes of tomb-digging and coffin-searching.

**Knowing Contentment Prevents Humiliation**
――A man who knows contentment cuts off profit and abandons desire,
thus avoiding humiliation for his body.

**Knowing to Stop Prevents Ruin**
――Knowing when to stop means
wealth and profit do not burden the body,
sounds and colors do not disorder the ears and eyes—
then the body faces no peril or ruin.
*Thus, one can endure long.*

**Chapter Forty-Five: Profound Virtue/Power**
*A great attainment seems incomplete.*
――It refers to a ruler of great virtue/power (*Dao/De*),
whose attainment seems incomplete—
his name is extinguished,
his reputation concealed,
as though destroyed and lacking nothingness.
Yet his use is without flaw.

*A great abundance seems empty.*
――It refers to a ruler of great virtue/power (*Dao/De*)
filled with abundance—
like emptiness, he does not dare to be arrogant in his nobility,
nor extravagant in his wealth.
Thus, his use is inexhaustible.

**The Way of Moderation Continues**
――*Thus, his use of virtue/power is inexhaustible.*

**Great Straightness as Flexibility**
――*Great straightness* refers to one who follows the Dao/Way and its laws with unwavering rectitude.
*As flexibility*, he does not contend with the common folk—
his rectitude bends like reeds in the wind.

**Great Skill as Clumsiness**
――*Great skill* means possessing many talents.
*As clumsiness*, he does not dare display his abilities.

**Great Eloquence as Speechlessness**
――*Great eloquence* is wisdom without doubt.
*As speechlessness*, his words are few—
his tongue is restrained, his speech measured.

**Excessive Vitality Overcomes Cold**
――*Excessive* means extreme.
In spring and summer, the yang-qi is vigorous above—
when things flourish to their peak, cold follows,
and cold brings withering and death.
Thus, one must not be overly rigid and harsh.

**Stillness Overcomes Heat**
――In autumn and winter, all things rest beneath the earth—
when stillness reaches its extreme, heat arises,
for heat is the source of life.
*Clarity and stillness are the eternal order of the world.*

**Chapter Forty-Six: Frugality as Desire**
*The world follows the Dao.*
――It refers to a ruler who embodies the Dao.
*He turns back the warhorses to till the fields.*
――*Turning back* means using them to fertilize the land.
A ruler who governs his body turns back his yang-qi
to nourish his essence.

*The world does not follow the Dao.*
――It refers to a ruler who does not embody the Dao.
*Warhorses breed in the suburbs.*
――Endless warfare fills the borders,
and they never return home.

*No greater crime than indulging desire.*
――Excessive lust is the root.
*No greater calamity than not knowing contentment.*
――Wealth and honor cannot restrain him.
*No greater fault than greed.*
――Greed for people and gain is insatiable.
*Thus, true contentment is rooted in authenticity.*
――Preserving the true essence.
*Ever-contented.*
――Free from desire.

**Chapter Forty-Seven: Discernment from Afar**
*Without leaving home, one knows the world.*
――The Sage, without stepping outside,
knows the world by knowing himself—
by knowing his own body, he knows others’,
by knowing his own family, he knows others’ families.
Thus, he perceives the world.

*Without peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.*
――The Dao of Heaven aligns with human conduct—
the great harmonize, their vital essences interconnected.
When a ruler is pure, the heavenly qi aligns naturally.
When a ruler is desirous, the heavenly qi grows turbulent.
All fortune, calamity, benefit, and harm arise from within.

*The farther one goes, the less one knows.*
――Moving from one’s home to observe others’ families,
from one’s body to observe others’ bodies—
the farther one looks, the less one truly sees.

*Thus, the Sage knows without traveling.*
――The Sage neither ascends to heaven nor descends to the abyss,
yet knows the heavens and earth through the mind.
*He names without seeing.*
――When the ruler above values the Dao,
and those below value virtue,
when the ruler above values martial might,
and those below value strength—
the Sage roots small knowledge in great,
discerns the inner to know the outer.
*He achieves without action.*
――When the ruler above does nothing,
the people below have no burdens—
families are well-provided, people are at ease,
and all things transform naturally.

**Chapter Forty-Eight: Forgetting Knowledge**
*Learning increases daily.*
――*Learning* refers to governance, rites, music, and instruction.
*Daily increase* means desires and adornments grow ever more.

*The Dao diminishes daily.*
――*The Dao* refers to the natural Way.
*Daily diminishment* means desires and adornments are gradually stripped away.

*Diminish again, and again.*
――Strip away desires once more,
until one attains *wuwei*—
*Simple and unadorned, like an infant,*
doing nothing yet accomplishing all.

*Without action, nothing remains undone.*
――When desires are severed,
virtue and the Dao unite—
nothing is beyond reach, nothing beyond attainment.

*Taking the world is ever through non-action.*
――*Taking* means governing.
To govern the world, one must act with *wuwei*—
not through labor, but through ease.

*When action arises, it is insufficient to take the world.*
――When one favors action,
governance becomes burdensome, the people restless—
thus, it is inadequate to rule the world.

**Chapter Forty-Nine: Trusting in Virtue**
*The Sage has no fixed mind.*
――The Sage values transformation, adapts to circumstances,
as if his mind were ever-empty.

*He takes the people’s mind as his own.*
――He follows what benefits the people.

*If they are good, I reward their goodness.*
――When the people act virtuously, the Sage reinforces it.

*If they are not good, I still reward goodness.*
――Even if the people act poorly, the Sage transforms them toward virtue.
*Thus, virtue becomes goodness.*

*If they are trustworthy, I trust them.*
――When the people are honest, the Sage affirms it.

*If they are untrustworthy, I still trust them.*
――When the people are deceitful, the Sage transforms them toward honesty.
*Thus, virtue becomes trust.*

*The Sage in the world is ever cautious.*
――The Sage in the world is always vigilant,
fearing arrogance and excess in wealth and honor.

*He muddles the people’s minds.*
――He clouds their perceptions,
as if they were dim-witted and unknowing.

*The people rely on him for sight and hearing.*
――*Rely* means to use.
The people depend on the Sage for perception and judgment.

*The Sage nurtures them like infants.*
――The Sage cherishes the people as infants—
nourishing them without expectation of return.

**Chapter Fifty: Valuing Life**
*Birth and death.*
――*Birth* is when desires emerge—
the spirit and soul are undisturbed, the vital essence settled.
*Death* is when desires enter the chest—
the spirit is exhausted, the mind confused.

*Those who live by vitality number thirteen,*
*those who die by vitality number thirteen.*
――The types of life and death each have thirteen—
the nine orifices and four passages.

*In life, the eyes do not gaze wantonly,*
*the ears do not listen recklessly,*
*the nose does not indulge scent,*
*the mouth does not speak idly,*
*the hands do not grasp greedily,*
*the feet do not walk recklessly,*
*the spirit does not act recklessly—*
*thus, death comes when these are violated.*

*Man’s actions lead him to death’s ground thirteen times.*
――Man’s pursuit of life, through reckless action, leads to thirteen deaths.

*Why is this so?*
――*Why* does action lead to death’s ground?

With its abundance of life-giving vitality—
---
The reason one falls into death’s ground
is that their pursuit of life is excessive,
contrary to the Dao, defying Heaven,
acting recklessly, and losing proper measure.

It is said that those who nurture life well—
*Screens* (nurture) life:
When walking on land, they avoid rhinoceros and tigers—
naturally keeping harm at bay, not provoking it.
Entering battle, they avoid weapons—
they do not delight in war or take lives.
The rhinoceros has no place to thrust its horns,
the tiger no place to strike with its claws,
the weapons no place to find their edge—
for those who nurture life, beasts and blades dare not harm them.
*Why is this so?*
---
*Why* do tigers, rhinoceros, and weapons not harm them?
Because they do not tread upon the thirteen death grounds—
their spirit and vitality are protected by the numinous,
and such things dare not harm them.

**Chapter 51: Nurturing Virtue**
The Dao gives birth.
Virtue nourishes.
The One distributes *qi* and nurtures.
It shapes the forms of things.
It establishes their nature.
Thus, all things do not fail to revere the Dao and honor virtue.
The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s nobility—
none command them, yet they act naturally.
Thus, the Dao gives birth, virtue nurtures,
lengthens, matures, completes, and shelters.
Who would not nourish and protect?
It does not claim what it gives birth to.
It acts without relying on reward.
It lengthens without domination.
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

**Chapter 52: Returning to the Origin**
The world has a beginning—
the Dao, which is its mother.
Having known its mother, one must know its child—
the One.
Having known its child, one must return to its mother—
the Dao—
and practice non-action.
Thus, one’s life is without peril.
Close the *dui* (eyes)—
do not gaze wantonly.
Shut the gate (mouth)—
do not speak recklessly.
Thus, one’s life is without toil.
Open the *dui*—
indulge desires.
Benefit desire’s affairs—
thus, one’s life is without salvation.
Seeing what is small is called insight—
when mischief first stirs, one perceives it clearly.
Guarding softness is called strength—
to persist in weakness is to grow mighty.
Use its light—
direct your vision outward to discern the world’s advantages and harms.
Then return to its insight—
do not let your spirit scatter.
Thus, your body will suffer no ruin.
This is called habitual practice.

**Chapter 53: Augmenting Proof**
Let me stand firm in knowing
and walk the Great Dao—
*Great* (intense).
Laozi laments that rulers of his time do not follow the Great Dao,
so he speaks thus:
Let me stand firm in knowing governance,
then practice the Dao’s effortless transformation.
Only fear what you do—
*Only*, for fear of acting contrary to the Dao,
fearing that rewarding goodness will breed false virtue,
fearing that trusting loyalty will summon deceit.
The Great Dao is most level—
yet the people prefer crooked paths.
When the court is grand and palaces adorned,
fields lie fallow—
agriculture neglected, uncultivated.
Granaries are empty—
harvests ruined, the state without reserves.
Garments are embroidered with fine silks—
luxurious adornment, inner splendor.
They wear sharp swords—
valuing strength, arms, and extravagance.
Gluttony for food and drink, wealth in excess—
this is called banditry’s vanity.
The people grow rich, yet the ruler has more—
this comes from plunder, leading to ruined lives,
broken homes, and scattered kin.
This is not the Dao.

The words *"复言也哉"* are words of sorrowful lament.
**Chapter 54: *Shàn Jiàn***—*"The Well-Established Cannot Be Uprooted"*—
Establishment.
Those who establish themselves and their nation in the Dao cannot be uprooted or drawn away.
Those who embrace the Dao with sincerity cannot be separated or released.
Their descendants will never cease in sacrifice—
For those who cultivate the Dao thus attain immortality, generation after generation, perpetually honoring their ancestors in the ancestral temple without end.
Cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true.
Cultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.
Cultivated in the village, its virtue endures.
Cultivated in the state, its virtue flourishes.
Cultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.

Thus, observe the self with the self—
Compare the Dao-cultivated with the uncultivated, and see which perishes, which endures.
Observe the family with the family—
Compare the Dao-cultivated household with the uncultivated.
Observe the village with the village—
Compare the Dao-cultivated village with the uncultivated.
Observe the state with the state—
Compare the Dao-cultivated realm with the uncultivated.
Observe the world with the world—
Compare the Dao-cultivated sovereign with the uncultivated.
How do I know this of the world? By this.

**Chapter 55: *Xuán Fú* — *"The Mysterious Omen"*
The depth of virtue embraced—
Like the infant.
Divine protection enfolds those who harbor virtue,
As parents cherish an infant.
Poisonous creatures do not sting—
Bees, wasps, serpents, and scorpions do not harm.
Fierce beasts do not seize, predatory birds do not strike.
Its bones are frail, its sinews soft, yet its grasp is firm—
The infant’s sinews and bones are weak, yet it holds fast because its will is unshaken.
It knows not the union of male and female, yet its vitality surges—
The infant, unaware of copulation, yet its *jing* overflows.
It weeps all day without hoarseness—
Its voice remains unbroken from dawn to dusk, for its *qi* is harmonious.
To know harmony is to know constancy—
He who understands the gentle strength of *qi* has grasped the Dao’s essence.
To know constancy is to know clarity—
He who walks the Dao’s constancy attains enlightenment.
Life grows auspicious daily—
*Xiáng* means "long-lasting"—speaking of life extending and growing strong.
The heart directs *qi* to grow ever stronger—
When the mind is focused and harmonious, *qi* solidifies within, yet if the will wanders, the harmonious *qi* dissipates, and the body grows rigid.
When things reach their peak, they wither—
This is called *not the Dao*.
Not the Dao brings early decay—
Those who do not align with the Dao perish young.

**Chapter 56: *Xuán Dé* — *"The Mysterious Virtue"**
The wise do not speak—
Wisdom lies in action, not words.
Those who speak do not know—
A chariot cannot overtake the tongue; many words bring many calamities.
Seal the pass, close the gate—
Block the source to cut off excess.
Dull the sharp—
When desires sharpen, recall the Dao’s non-action to blunt them.
Dissolve the wrath—
When resentment festers, recall the Dao’s non-action to dissolve it.
Dull the brilliance—
Though one’s insight may shine, harmonize it so it does not dazzle or disrupt.
Blend with the dust—
Do not set yourself apart.
This is called *Mysterious Unity*—
*Xuán*, the Heavenly. He who acts in the highest way aligns with Heaven’s Dao.

Thus, he cannot be drawn near—
He does not take pride in honor nor sorrow in solitude.
Nor can he be pushed away—
His mind at rest, he bears no grudges against others.
He cannot be exploited—
He does not covet wealth nor indulge in sensual pleasures.
Nor can he be harmed—
He does not contend with the greedy for gain, nor with the bold for strength.
He cannot be exalted—
He does not serve chaotic rulers nor occupy positions under tyrannical lords.
Nor can he be debased—
He does not grow arrogant through power nor bend through lost resolve.
Thus, he is noble beyond the world.

**Chapter 57: *Chún Fēng* — *"The Pure Wind"**
Govern the state with rectitude—

The Celestial One empowers those who uphold rectitude to rule a realm.
He employs deception in warfare—
*Qi*, the artful. The Celestial One entrusts the artful with command of arms.

He seizes the world through non-action.
—He appoints as sovereign those who act with effortless ease and do-nothingness.

How do I know this to be true?
Through this:
—*This*, the present. Laozi asks, "How do I know Heaven’s intent to be thus?"
I perceive it from what I see today.

The world abounds in prohibitions,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
—The world refers to rulers. Prohibitions mean restrictions and bans.
When commands multiply, deceit flourishes below;
When bans increase, the common folk vie in cunning,
And thus poverty ensues.

The people wield many sharp implements,
The state grows ever more chaotic.
—Sharp implements are *power*.
When the people hold much *power*,
Those who see are dazzled by excess,
Those who hear are bewildered by noise,
And thus the state descends into disorder.

The people cultivate many clever arts,
Strange objects proliferate—
—The people refer to the sovereign and the feudal lords within a hundred *li*.
To know many clever arts means to carve and paint palaces,
To engrave and embroider garments and adornments,
And strange objects multiply below.
Then the lower classes emulate the upper,
And the adornment of gold, silver filigree,
And embroidered colors grows ever more extravagant.

When fine goods abound,
Thieves and robbers multiply.
—*Fine goods*, desirable objects.

The treasures and delicacies multiply and become conspicuous,
Then agricultural labor is neglected,
Hunger and cold come together,
And thus thieves and robbers abound.

Therefore, the Sage says:
—Referring to the governance of the common folk.
*"I do no action, yet the people transform themselves,"*
—The Sage means that I cultivate the Dao and align with Heaven,
Making no alterations or creations,
Yet the people naturally transform and perfect themselves.

*"I love quietude, yet the people become upright,"*
—The Sage means that I love stillness and do not speak,
Yet all the people become naturally loyal and virtuous.

*"I do no labor, yet the people grow wealthy,"*
—If I do not impose corvée or conscription,
The people settle into their occupations,
And thus all become wealthy.

*"I have no desires, yet the people remain simple."*
—If I always refrain from desires,
Removing ornate words and sumptuous attire,
And do not adorn the people,
Then they follow me in simplicity and naturalness.

**Chapter 58: Harmonizing Transformation**
His governance is *obscure and tranquil*,
—His governance is broad and lenient,
*Obscure and tranquil*, as if unclear.
His people are *pure and sincere*,
—Because his governance is broad and lenient,
The people are pure and sincere,
Rich and abundant, harmonious and kind.

His governance is *sharp and vigilant*,
—His governance is swift and urgent,
Decisions made by word and ear alone.
His people are *depleted and frail*.
—If governance is urgent, the people cannot sustain life,
Thus depletion and frailness grow ever more pronounced.

Disaster! *It leans upon fortune.*
—*Lean*, as in *depends*.
Disaster arises from fortune;
When Heaven meets disaster yet can repent,
Take responsibility, and cultivate virtue,
Then the Dao of proper conduct,
Disaster departs and fortune arrives.

Fortune! *It harbors disaster.*
—Disaster lies concealed within fortune;
If one receives fortune yet becomes arrogant and licentious,
Then fortune departs and disaster comes.

Who knows its limit?
—Disaster and fortune alternate in generation,
Who can know when their extremes will come?

If the ruler lacks rectitude,
—*Lack*, as in *not*.
It means the ruler does not rectify himself,
Then there will be no state.

Rectitude becomes deceitful,
—*Deceitful*, as in *artifice*.
Though the ruler is upright,
If his subjects are upright,
He will still transform into deceitful artifice above.

Virtue becomes ominous,
—Virtuous men will also transform into ominous portents above.
The people’s confusion is longstanding indeed,
—It means that the ruler’s bewilderment and loss of rectitude
Have already endured for some time.

Thus the Sage acts with *squareness* yet does not sever,
—The Sage practices *squareness* and rectitude,
Desiring to guide the people,
Not to cut or harm them.

Is *frugal* yet does not injure,
—The Sage is frugal and clear,
Desiring to transform the people,
Not to harm them.
Now it is not so: rectitude harms the people.

Is *straight* yet does not impose,
—*Impose*, as in *assert*.
Though the Sage is straight,
He bends himself to follow others,
Not asserting his own will.

Is *bright* yet does not dazzle*.
—The Sage, though possessing singular insight,
Always appears as if in darkness,
Not dazzling others with brilliance.

**Chapter 59: Guarding the Dao**
Govern the people,
—The ruler desires to govern the people.
Serve Heaven,
—*Serve*, as in *employ*.
He must employ the Dao of Heaven,
Aligning with the four seasons.
Nothing is better than *frugality*,
—*Frugality*, as in *greed*.
The ruler must love the people,
Then he will not be extravagant or oppressive.
The individual must love his *qi* and essence,
Not indulging in dissipation.

Only through *frugality*
Can one be said to *earn early*.
—*Early*, as in *first*.
*Earn*, as in *obtain*.
Only through loving the people’s resources
And cherishing his *qi* and essence
Can one first obtain the Dao of Heaven.

To *earn early* is called *accumulating virtue*.
—First obtaining the Dao of Heaven
Is called accumulating virtue within oneself.
Accumulating virtue ensures no defeat,
—*Defeat*, as in *overcome*.
Accumulating virtue within oneself
Ensures no one can overcome him.
If no one can overcome him,
Then none know his limits.
—If no one can overcome or defeat him,
Then none can know the extent of his virtue.
None knowing his limits,
He can have a state.
—None knowing the limits of his virtue,
He can possess land and people,
Bringing lasting fortune to the common folk.
A state’s foundation,
Can endure forever.
—The state and the body are the same.
*Foundation*, as in *Dao*.
If one can preserve the Dao within his body,
His *qi* and essence unexhausted,
His five senses unstrained,
Then he can endure forever.
This is called *deep-rooted and firm-based*,
—If one can take *qi* as root and essence as base,
Like a tree whose roots are not deep,
Then its branches and base are not firm,
And it will fall.
It is said that one should deeply conceal his *qi*,
Firmly guard his essence,
Preventing any leakage.

The Dao of *long life and enduring vision*.
—Deep-rooted and firm-based
Is the Dao of long life and enduring vision.

**Chapter 60: Occupying a Position**
To govern a great state is like cooking a small fish.
—*Fish*, as in *delicate*.
Cooking a small fish,
One does not remove its entrails,
Does not scrape its scales,
Does not dare to disturb it,
For fear it will spoil.
If governance is troublesome,
The common folk will rebel below;
If self-cultivation is troublesome,
The *qi* and essence will scatter.

With the Dao governing the world,
Its spirits are not *numinous*.
—With virtue and the Dao in position,
The spirits dare not manifest their *numinous* power
To harm the people.

Not that its spirits lack *numinous* power,
But that their *numinous* power does not harm people.
—The spirits are not without *numinous* power;
Only through failing to uphold the *Eight Virtues*
Can one harm the natural disposition of others.
Not that their *numinous* power cannot harm people,
The Sage also does not harm.
—Only spirits and *numinous* power can harm people;
Since the Sage in position does not harm people,
The spirits dare not interfere.

Thus the two do not harm each other,
—The spirits and the Sage both
Do not harm each other.
Hence virtue returns and converges.

**Chapter 61: Humble Virtue**
A great state is like a *low-lying stream*,
—In governing a great state,
One should be like a stream in low-lying places,
Not opposing the minutiae.

The gathering of the world,
—The great state is where the world’s scholars and common folk
Converge and interact.

The *yin* of the world.
—*Yin*, as in *female*.
Soft, humble, and yielding,
Yet not boastful.
*Yin* always overcomes *yang* through stillness,
—The female overcomes the male,
As *yin* overcomes *yang* through tranquility,
And fulfillment without seeking first.

With stillness as the *low-lying*.
—The Dao of *yin* is humble through stillness.
Thus a great state subjugates small states,
And takes them.

「――If one can be humble and lowly,
Then one will always possess it.
The small state, if humble before the great state,
Will take the great state.
—This says that a state, whether large or small,
If it holds to humility and nurtures the people,
Will have no faults.

Thus, sometimes one is humble to take,
Sometimes one is humble and takes.
—*Humble* here means the great state being humble before the small state,
And the small state being humble before the great state,
Exchanging them through righteousness.

The great state does not seek to annex and nurture others,
—The great state should not lose what it has,
But rather absorb and tend to other states.
The small state does not seek to serve others,
—To make them into subjects and servants.

Both sides thus obtain what they desire,
And the greater should act humbly.
—The great state and the small state each desire what they seek,
And the great state should also practice humility.

**Chapter 62: The Way**
The Way is the hidden essence of all things.
—*Essence*, meaning *hidden*.
The Way is the hidden treasure of all things,
And contains all without exception.

The treasure of the virtuous,
—The virtuous take the Way as their personal treasure,
And dare not defy it.
The refuge of the unvirtuous.
—The Way is also the refuge of the unvirtuous.
When disaster strikes or urgency arises,
They still know to repent, humble themselves, and submit.

Beautiful words can be sold,
—*Beautiful words* are only useful in the marketplace,
For in trade, once the exchange is done,
The parties part ways—no further harmony remains.
Good words and fine speech,
The seeker wants to acquire them quickly,
The seller wants to sell them quickly.

Noble conduct can be bestowed upon others.
—*Bestow*, meaning *distinguish*.
A person with noble conduct can surpass the common man,
Yet this is still insufficient to honor the Way.

What should be done with those who are unvirtuous?
—Though unvirtuous, they should be transformed by the Way.
Before the Three Sovereigns,
There were no abandoned people—
Their virtue was pure and their teachings refined.

Thus, the Son of Heaven is established,
And the Three Ministers appointed,
—To teach and transform the unvirtuous.

Even with a jade tablet and four horses leading the way,
It is not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.
—Though one arrives with a precious jade tablet
And fine horses ahead,
It is still not as good as sitting and embracing this Way.

Why did the ancients value this Way so highly?
Not because they sought it and obtained it daily,
—The ancients valued this Way
Not by daily searching for it externally,
But by attaining it within themselves.

Or to atone for guilt?
—*Guilt* refers to those in chaotic times
Under tyrannical rulers who met with unjust punishment.
Practicing the Way can absolve death
And spare them from the masses.

Thus, it is held in highest regard.

**Chapter 63: The Beginning of Favor**
To act without acting,
—To follow what is already formed,
And thus make no artificial constructions.
To manage without managing,
—To prepare in advance,
And thus eliminate troublesome affairs.
To taste without tasting.
—To think deeply and plan far ahead,
And thus savor the Way’s meaning.

Great or small, much or little,
—To set forth warnings and orders.
To desire greatness is to return to smallness,
To desire much is to return to little,
The natural course of things.

To repay resentment with virtue.
—To practice the Way and do good,
And thus prevent disaster before it arises.

To plan for difficulty when it is easy,
—To plan for great challenges
When they are still in their early, unformed stages.
To build the great from the small.
—To undertake great matters,
One must begin with small ones—
For calamities arise from small beginnings.

The most difficult things in the world
Must be addressed when they are easy.
The greatest things in the world
Must be addressed when they are small.

Thus, the Sage never pursues the great.
—By remaining humble and modest,
He can achieve the greatest.

And so he attains the great.
—The world unites under him.

He who makes light of promises will be lacking in trustworthiness,
—He does not take his words seriously.
He who takes on too much will encounter many difficulties,
—He does not guard against misfortune.

Thus, the Sage treats even these matters with caution,
—The Sage, in all his actions and undertakings,
Weighs them carefully, advancing and retreating with difficulty,
To block their origins.

And so he never encounters difficulty.
—The Sage, throughout his life,
Avoids misfortune as one avoids deep harm.

**Chapter 64: Guarding the Subtle**
Its ease lies in its stability,
—To govern oneself and the state,
The stable is easy to uphold.
Its unmanifested state is easy to plan for,
—When desires and disasters
Have not yet taken form,
They are easy to correct in advance.
Its fragility is easy to break,
—When calamities have not yet stirred in court
And desires have not yet shown on the face,
They are as fragile as glass and easy to dispel.
Its subtlety is easy to disperse.
—When it is not yet manifest,
Its subtlety is easy to eliminate.

To act before it exists,
—To undertake anything,
One must do so before its roots take hold.
To govern before it is disordered.
—To govern oneself and the state,
One must act before disorder arises,
And preemptively close the door.

A tree as thick as one’s embrace
Grows from a tiny sprout,
—A thing grows from small to great.
A nine-tiered tower
Rises from a pile of soil.
—A thing ascends from low to high.
A thousand-li journey
Begins beneath one’s feet.
—A thing extends from near to far.

To act is to court ruin,
—Artificial action ruins naturalness.
To grasp is to lose.
—To cling to gain invites misfortune;
To cling to the Way preserves the body,
Yet if one refuses to yield or return,
One loses.

The Sage acts without acting,
And thus meets with no ruin,
—The Sage does not indulge in empty words,
Nor in material gain or violence,
And so suffers no destruction.
He does not grasp,
And thus loses nothing.
—The Sage, with virtue, teaches the foolish,
And with wealth, aids the poor,
Holding nothing back,
And thus loses nothing to others.

The people, in their undertakings,
Often ruin what is nearly complete.
—*From*, meaning *to do*.
The people, in their affairs,
Often, when success is nearly achieved,
Grow greedy for position, fame, extravagance, and excess,
And thus ruin themselves.

To be as careful at the end as at the beginning,
Then there will be no ruined affairs.
—The end must be as diligent as the beginning,
Lest one grow negligent.

Thus, the Sage desires what others do not desire,
—The Sage desires what others do not,
And what others make manifest,
The Sage conceals.
What others adorn,
The Sage keeps plain.
What others value in appearance,
The Sage values in virtue.

He does not prize difficult-to-obtain goods,
—The Sage is not dazzled by fine clothing,
Nor does he devalue stone while prizing jade.

「学不学，――The Sage learns what others cannot learn.
Others learn cleverness and deceit,
The Sage learns spontaneity.
Others learn to govern the world,
The Sage learns to govern himself and preserve the Dao, for truth lies therein.
He repeats the errors of the multitude.
――The multitude learns wisdom, yet reverses its purpose—
What should be the root becomes the superficial,
And what should be the superficial becomes the root.
Thus, they are taught to return to the original,
――To aid the natural course of all things—
Their true intent is to restore humanity’s innate nature.
Yet they dare not act.
――The Sage acts with moderation, never daring to contrive,
Lest he stray from the root.

**Chapter 65: Pure Virtue**
Those of old who excelled in the Dao,
――Those who governed well in ancient times,
Did not seek to enlighten the people,
――Not by teaching them cleverness or deceit.
But to deceive them.
――To guide them with virtue, making them simple and unpretentious.
The difficulty in governing the people lies in their excess of cleverness.
――Their cleverness leads to cunning and guile.
To govern with cleverness is to be the thief of the state.
――To entrust statecraft to those skilled in cleverness
Is to distance oneself from virtue and arrogantly wield power,
Thus becoming the thief of the state.
To govern without cleverness is to bring fortune to the state.
――To keep statecraft from the clever and allow the people to uphold righteousness,
Without resorting to deceit or tyranny,
Is for the ruler and subjects to be harmonious and united in strength—
Thus bringing fortune to the state.
Understanding these two principles is the standard.
――The two principles: governing with cleverness brings ruin,
While governing without it brings fortune—
This is the model for self-cultivation and statecraft.
To always know this standard is called **Pure Virtue**.
――*Pure*, meaning *heavenly*—
To know the principles of self-cultivation and statecraft
Is to align oneself with heaven’s virtue.
Pure Virtue is profound and distant,
――Its depths cannot be measured, its heights cannot be fathomed.
It opposes the ways of others,
――For while others seek to benefit themselves,
Pure Virtue bestows upon all—
And thus attains **Great Harmony**.
――Pure Virtue opposes the ways of others,
Yet in doing so, it fulfills the natural order of heaven.

**Chapter 66: Benevolence After Oneself**
The rivers and seas become kings of all valleys
Because they excel in yielding.
――Because they are lowly, all streams flow to them,
Just as the people follow the worthy.
Thus they become kings of all valleys.
――Because they are humble and yielding,
They excel as kings of all valleys.
Therefore, the Sage who wishes to be above the people,
――Who desires to lead the people,
Must speak from a position of humility.
――Following the rivers and seas’ example of modesty.
Who wishes to go before the people,
――Who desires to take the lead,
Must place himself behind them.
――Putting others first and himself last.
Thus, though the Sage is above the people,
They do not feel burdened,
――For he does not assert his noble status,
But humbles himself, so the people revere him without heaviness.
And though he goes before them,
They are not harmed,
――For he does not blind them with his brilliance,
But treats them with warmth, as if he harbored no ill intent.
Thus the whole world gladly follows him without weariness.
――For his benevolence is deep, his love vast,
And he regards the people as his own children—
Thus the world willingly follows him without tiring.
Because he does not contend,
――For he does not vie with others for precedence,
Thus none under heaven can contend with him.
――Others seek to act, but he does not,
So none can act against him.

**Chapter 67: The Three Treasures**
The world says I am great, yet I seem unworthy.
――The Daoist says the world calls him virtuous,
Yet he feigns foolishness, appearing unworthy.
Only because he is truly great does he seem unworthy.
――For only the truly great
Harm themselves by feigning foolishness,
Distinguishing nothing, taking no credit—
Not demeaning others but ennobling themselves.
If he were truly worthy for long,
――*Worthy*, meaning *clever*—
It would mean he was merely a clever man,
Not a great one.
I possess three treasures; I hold them as treasures.
――The Daoist says: I have three treasures, which I cherish.
First, **compassion**,
――Loving the people as one’s own children.
Second, **frugality**,
――Taxing them lightly, as if taking from oneself.
Third, **not daring to be first under heaven**,
――Practicing humility, never leading by force.
Through compassion, he gains courage,
――For compassion fosters loyalty and filial piety,
Thus enabling victory in battle.
Through frugality, he gains abundance,
――For the ruler’s restraint allows the people’s daily needs to flourish.
By not daring to be first under heaven,
――For he does not forcefully take the lead,
Thus he attains **Great Harmony and longevity**.
――He becomes the leader of those who follow the Dao.
Now, abandoning compassion and seeking only courage,
――Now, the world abandons compassion for mere bravado,
Abandoning frugality for extravagance,
――Discarding restraint for luxury and excess,
Abandoning humility and always striving to be first—
This is the path to death.
――Such actions lead to ruin.
Compassion, when wielded in war, brings victory,
――For compassion unites the people’s hearts,
Thus ensuring triumph in battle and steadfastness in defense.
When heaven would save them, it shields them with compassion.
――For heaven aids those who possess compassion,
Granting them the strength to defend themselves.

**Chapter 68: Aligning with Heaven**
The skilled warrior does not rely on force,
――For he values virtue over arms.
The adept at battle does not grow angry,
――For he who fights with the Dao
Stops evil in its inception,
Prevents disaster before it arises,
And does not slay with wrath.
The master of victory does not contend,
――For he who overcomes with the Dao
Draws near with benevolence,
Repels with virtue,
And does not fight his enemy—
Thus the enemy submits of its own accord.»

「善用人者為下。
――善用人者自辅佐者常為人执謙下也。
是謂不爭之德，
――謂上為之下也。
是乃不與人爭之道德也。
是謂用人之力，
――能身為人下是謂用人臣之力。
是謂配天
――能行此者德配天也。
古之極。
――是乃古之極要道也。

**Chapter 69: Mysterious Application**
The adept at using others places himself beneath them.
――For he who excels in using others
is ever humble, assuming the role of servant.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
――For the high place themselves beneath the low.
This is the Dao of not contending with others.
This is called the strength of using others,
――For he who can humble himself beneath others
is the true strength of a subject.
This is called aligning with Heaven—
――He who practices this
has virtue that matches Heaven.
The ultimate of antiquity.
――This is the essential Dao of the ancients.

**Chapter 70: Knowing the Unknown**
To know that one does not know is superior,
――For the Daoist knows what he does not know.
To not know that one does not know is a sickness.
――For he who does not know what he does not know
suffers from a moral sickness.
Only he who knows sickness can avoid it,
――Thus he does not fall into sickness.
The sage does not suffer from sickness,
for he knows sickness.
――For the sage has no arrogance of knowledge,
but he who knows sickness
is one who endures the suffering of others
with their sickness of knowledge.
Thus he does not fall into sickness himself.
――By comparison to others.
Therefore, the sage does not suffer.
For the sage holds comprehensive knowledge,
yet presents himself as one who does not know,
to make the world simple and honest,
each guarding their pure nature.
The petty man, lacking this knowledge,
acts presumptuously, contending in his arrogance,
thus harming his spirit and shortening his life.

**Chapter 72: Loving Oneself**
When the people do not fear great harm,
then great harm has truly arrived.
――For harm is harm.
If they do not fear lesser harms,
then greater harms will come—
speaking of death.
Those who fear it should cherish their spirit,
upholding Heaven and conforming to Earth.
Do not narrow their dwelling,
――For the spirit resides in the heart,
and the heart should be broad and gentle,
not hurried or confined.
Do not weary their source of life.
――That which sustains life is the spirit,
rooted in emptiness and delighting in purity.
Excessive indulgence in food,
forgetting the Dao,
pursuing carnal pleasures,
filling the belly with impurities—
this is to harm their essence,
to weary the spirit.
Only he who does not weary the spirit
can truly avoid wearying it.
――For only he who does not weary his spirit
can wash his heart and purify his flaws,
remaining tranquil and desireless,
thus the spirit abides within him without weariness.
Therefore, the sage knows himself—
――Knowing his own gains and losses.
He does not reveal himself—
――Not displaying his virtue outwardly,
but keeping it within.
He loves himself—
――Loving his body to preserve his vital *qi*.
He does not exalt himself.
――Not seeking worldly honor or glory.
Thus he discards that and takes this—
――Discarding self-revelation and self-exaltation,
taking self-knowledge and self-love.

**Chapter 73: Taking Action**
Brave in daring, he meets death,
――For daring and bold action
leads to self-destruction.
Brave in not daring, he lives.
――For bravery in restraint
preserves his life.
These two paths—
――Of daring and not daring—
bring either benefit or harm.
――Preserving life is benefit,
meeting death is harm.
Heaven detests contention,
――Who knows its reason
and yet does not transgress?
Therefore, the sage finds it difficult—
――For the sage’s enlightened virtue
is difficult even for the daring,
much less for those without virtue
who would attempt it.

Heaven’s Dao,
does not contend yet wins through benevolence,
――For Heaven does not contend with men
over high and low,
yet men naturally revere it.
Does not speak yet responds appropriately,
――For Heaven does not speak,
yet all things move and respond in their proper time.
Does not summon yet they come of their own accord,
――For Heaven does not call,
yet all things bear the yin and turn toward the yang.
*[Acts] naturally and yet excels in strategy.*」

「――*"弹"* (改丝旁), *宽* also. Heaven’s Dao, though vast and boundless,
bestows retribution upon good and evil alike—
its net spreads wide yet nothing escapes.
――Heaven’s net is vast and far-reaching,
yet its scrutiny of virtue and vice is never remiss.

**Chapter 74: *On Restraining Deception***
When the people do not fear death,
――it is because rulers impose cruel punishments,
leaving them no hope of survival.
When governing the body, lustful desires harm the spirit,
greed for wealth risks one’s life—
yet the people know not to fear.
How then can you frighten them with death?
――If you would make the people fear death,
first remove your own oppressive measures
and teach them to abandon greed and desire.
But if they still rebel—
then I shall seize and execute them—
who would dare?

Old Master laments the times:
the king does not first cultivate virtue and Dao,
but instead enforces punishments.
Those who wield the axe of execution
stand high above, like Heaven’s own inspectors—
its net spreads wide yet nothing escapes.
To usurp Heaven’s role in execution
is to act as a clumsy artisan replacing the master carpenter.
――Heaven’s order is clear: executioners follow its rhythms—
spring’s birth, summer’s growth, autumn’s harvest, winter’s rest,
the stars and constellations moving in their appointed courses.
Yet if a ruler takes this role upon himself,
he is like the unskilled replacing the master carpenter—
his work will fail, and his hands will suffer.
――A ruler who presumes to execute
loses the proper measure—
and in losing measure, invites calamity.

**Chapter 75: *On Greed’s Harm***
The people’s hunger stems from excessive taxation by their rulers.
――Thus they starve.
The people’s unruliness stems from their rulers’ meddling.
――Thus they are hard to govern.
The people’s recklessness with death stems from their pursuit of life being too indulgent.
――Thus they court death lightly.
Only those who do not cling to life
are truly wiser than those who do.
――For the sage, neither noble titles nor wealth can sway him,
nor can kings command his service—
thus he is wiser than those who cling to life.

**Chapter 76: *On Warning Against Strength***
When a man is born, he is soft and weak.
――For life’s *qi* is harmonious, his spirit unspent.
When he dies, he grows rigid and strong.
――For life’s *qi* is exhausted, his spirit gone.
Grass and trees, when alive, are supple and tender.
――For life’s *qi* sustains them.
When they die, they wither and decay.
――For life’s *qi* has departed.
Thus, the rigid and strong belong to death,
while the soft and weak belong to life.
Therefore, the mighty army does not conquer,
――For its strength is reckless, its violence unchecked,
and it provokes united resistance.
The sturdy tree splits and falls,
――For its strength makes its branches brittle.
The strong and mighty are placed low,
while the soft and weak are placed high.
――Thus Heaven’s Dao suppresses the strong and upholds the weak—
a natural order.

**Chapter 77: *On Heaven’s Dao***
Heaven’s Dao is like drawing a bow.
――It adjusts the high and low, the excessive and the deficient.
It lowers the proud,
raises the humble,
reduces the overabundant,
and supplements the lacking.
――Thus it harmonizes all things.
Heaven’s Dao takes from the excess
to nourish what is deficient.
――It balances the full and the empty,
ever maintaining the middle.
But man’s Dao is otherwise:
he takes from the deficient
to indulge the excessive.
――The greedy strip the poor to enrich the rich,
the strong seize from the weak.
Who, then, can possess abundance
and yet use it to nourish the world?
Only the man of Dao.
――For only the sage-king can practice this.
Thus the sage acts without claiming credit,
――His virtue is given, yet he does not boast.
Completes his work yet does not dwell on it,
――His deeds are done, yet he does not cling to position.
He does not seek to be seen as wise.
――For he fears Heaven’s retribution—
to hoard excess is to invite ruin.

**Chapter 78: *On Trusting in Softness***
Nothing on earth is softer or weaker than water,
――Yet nothing surpasses it in overcoming the strong.
Its power is unmatched—
――It can wear down mountains, fill valleys,
erode iron, dissolve copper.
Nothing can replace it.
The weak overcome the strong,
――Water extinguishes fire, yin consumes yang.
The soft overcomes the hard,
――The tongue is soft, yet teeth—hard—are worn away first.
Yet none understand this,
none practice it.
――For men despise humility and exalt force.

**Chapter 78: *On Trusting in Softness* (continued)**

Thus the Sage says—
――Speaking of the lowly and humble.
To bear a nation’s filth,
――This is called the Lord of the Soil and Grain.
――For a ruler who loves his nation’s impurities like the rivers and seas,
――Not resisting the small currents,
――Can long preserve its Soil and Grain,
――And become the sovereign of that land.

To bear a nation’s ill fortune,
――This is called the King of All Under Heaven.
――For a ruler who takes upon himself the calamities of the people,
――And suffers the ill fates in their place,
――Can rule over all Under Heaven.

To speak truth yet appear contrary.
――This is truth that the world mistakes for deception.

**Chapter 79: *On the Seventh Contract***
To repay great grudges with harmony,
――Those who kill shall die, those who wound shall be punished.
Yet grudges will remain,
――For harsh retribution loses the people’s favor.
――And how can this be called good?

Thus the Sage holds the left contract—
――In ancient times, the Sage kept the left contract as a pledge of trust,
――Without written laws or inscribed covenants to establish faith.
And does not blame others.
――He only demands the fidelity of the contract itself.

The virtuous administer the contract,
――The virtuous ruler oversees the contracts and their fulfillment.
The unvirtuous administer the *chè* (彻).
――The unvirtuous ruler betrays his own words and punishes those who fail him.

The Dao of Heaven has no favorites,
――It always sides with the virtuous.

**Chapter 80: *On the Solitude of the Small State***
In a small state with few people,
――Though the Sage governs a great realm, he still acts with moderation,
――Not indulging in excess, and though the people are many,
――He treats them as if they were few, never daring to weary them.
He ensures each has their *shí-bǎi* (什伯)—
――Their ranks and duties, so that the noble do not encroach upon the lowly.

He does not use the people’s tools,
――He does not conscript or seize their farming implements,
――Nor take their prime seasons of labor.

He makes the people value life,
――If a ruler can benefit the people and remove their harms,
――Each finding their proper place,
――Then the people will cherish life and shun death.

And not seek distant migration.
――If governance is unburdened, the people settle in their homes,
――Never straying far from their accustomed dwellings.

Though there are boats and carriages,
――He does not ride them—
――For he cherishes simplicity and avoids ornate display,
――Nor does he indulge in travel or amusement.

Though there are arms and soldiers,
――He does not deploy them—
――For he harms none beneath Heaven.

He lets the people return to knotted cords,
――And uses them in trust—
――Abandoning written laws and reverting to simple, unadulterated faith.

He delights in their plain food,
――He delights in their simple vegetables,
――Not in the fish of the people.

He beautifies their coarse garments,
――He beautifies their plain clothes,
――Not in the splendor of five colors.

He settles them in thatched dwellings,
――He settles them in humble huts,
――Not in grand, adorned houses.

He finds joy in their customs,
――He finds joy in their natural simplicity,
――Not in shifting or corrupting their ways.

Neighboring states are in sight,
――And the sounds of chickens and dogs drift between them—
――So close they are.

Yet the people, until old age,
――Do not visit one another—
――For they have no lustful desires.

**Chapter 81: *On Displaying the Plain***
Faithful words are not ornate,
――The faithful are as they are—
――Not ornate, but simple and plain.

Ornate words are not faithful,
――Those who heap upon pretty speech—
――Endless flowery phrases—
――Are unfaithful, for they adorn falsehoods
――And indulge in empty, hollow things.

The good do not argue,
――The good cultivate the Way in their conduct,
――Not adopting fine words.

Those who argue are not good,
――To argue is to use clever speech—
――And clever speech brings ruin to one’s self.

Mountains have jade,
――Yet digging them exhausts the water.
Rivers have pearls,
――Yet dredging them muddies the depths.
――Those who speak much with clever tongues
――Lose their own lives.

The wise are not wide-ranging,
――The wise are those who understand the Way—
――Not wide-ranging, for they hold to the One.

The wide-ranging do not know.
――Those who range widely in knowledge
――Lose the essential truth.

The Sage does not hoard,
――The Sage accumulates virtue, not wealth,
――To teach the foolish and aid the poor.

The more he gives to others,
――The more virtue he has—
――The more he bestows virtue upon the people,
――The more virtue he himself possesses.

The more he gives to others,
――The more wealth he has—
――The more he distributes wealth and favors,
――The more his riches increase,
――Like the light of the sun and moon,
――Endless and ever-bright.

The Dao of Heaven benefits yet does not harm.
――Heaven nurtures all things to their fullness,
――Yet does not injure them.

The Sage’s Dao acts yet does not contend.
――The Sage follows Heaven’s Way,
――His actions complete, his deeds fulfilled,
――He does not vie with the people for fame or praise,
――Thus preserving his perfect virtue.
