*The Purple Radiance of Golden Splendor: A Daoist Exposition on Cultivating Immortality*

In the third year of Yuanfeng of the Han, Wu Xian presented *The Record of Cultivating Immortality* to Emperor Wu. The Emperor could not put it to use—what a pity! The book was transmitted to later generations, and even those who but dimly grasped its methods gained robust limbs, extended years, and prolonged life. Applied to offspring, it made them intelligent and easy to rear. Yet there are those one must abandon, and those one must avoid. Only by first knowing what to abandon and what to avoid may one proceed step by step in practice.

I have expounded its principles in twenty chapters, ordering the stages and fixing the sequence, for the sequence must not be disordered, nor the practice deficient. Those who cultivate immortality must attain it for themselves.

**1. On What to Abandon and What to Avoid**

In consorting with women, one must first understand the Five Abandonments:
1. Those with deep voices and coarse skin, yellow hair and fierce tempers, or venomous jealousy in their yin—these are the first to abandon.
2. Those with ugly, sallow faces, balding heads, foul armpits, hunched backs, protruding chests, or who walk with the hopping of sparrows or the slithering of serpents—these are the second to abandon.
3. Those who are sallow, emaciated, and weak, with cold bodies and depleted qi, or irregular menstruation—these are the third to abandon.
4. Those who are epileptic, deaf, mute, or dumb; lame or one-eyed; afflicted with scabies, scars, or madness; excessively fat or thin; or with coarse, dense yin hair—these are the fourth to abandon.
5. Those over forty years of age, who have borne many children and whose yin is depleted, with loose skin and sagging breasts—these bring no benefit and only harm, and are the fifth to abandon.

For the timing of union, one must know the Five Avoidances:
1. The Three Origins (heaven, earth, and human), jiazi days, one’s own fateful gengshen days, the conjunctions of heaven and earth, solar and lunar eclipses, the dark and new moons, the first and last quarters, great winds and rains, thunder and lightning, and beneath the Three Luminaries (sun, moon, and stars)—these are the first to avoid.
2. Mountains, forests, gardens, ponds, Daoist halls, Buddhist temples, pagodas, spirit shrines, and the great rivers (Yangtze, Huai, Yellow, and Ji)—these are the second to avoid.
3. Extreme cold or heat, ravenous hunger or overindulgent fullness, great joy or drunkenness, urgent need to relieve oneself, or when the cauldron’s qi is unresponsive—these are the third to avoid.
4. Consecutive days of drunkenness, recovery from long illness, or exhaustion from long journeys—these are the fourth to avoid.
5. Women who have not yet completed the seventy-seven days after childbirth, when defilement still lingers—these are the fifth to avoid.

Only by knowing and avoiding these Five Abandonments and Five Avoidances may one proceed. Those who violate them not only harm themselves but also beget offspring who are often crippled or unwholesome, for their endowment is not upright.

**2. On Nurturing Spirit and Qi**

The Dao of preserving life lies in carefully examining its methods.
- Fewer sexual desires nurture essence and qi.
- Moderation in rich flavors nurtures blood and qi.
- Swallowing saliva nurtures lung qi.
- Guarding against anger nurtures liver qi.
- Regulating diet nurtures stomach qi.
- Reducing excessive thought nurtures heart qi.
- Self-reflection nurtures the qi of the flesh.

Practicing these diligently will make one’s qi robust and spirit abundant.

During the hours of xu and hai, when yin wanes and yang disperses, one should not indulge in drunkenness, overindulgence, or deep sleep, lest the hundred vessels become congested and the joints accumulate toxins. At this time, one should first guide the four vessels, then stretch the limbs, revolve the mechanism of qi, and move the entire body. Thus, the joints open, the constructive and defensive qi flow smoothly, yin and yang harmonize, essence is secured, spirit is whole, pathogenic qi cannot enter, and neither cold nor heat can assail—this is the Dao of preserving life.

**3. The Elixir of the Bedchamber**

The oral formula states: *"To supplement a person with a person is to attain the true."*
The Dao of yin and yang treasures essence and marrow. Circulate and refine them, and one will not age even in later years.

The affairs of the bedchamber can kill a person or give them life. Those who master its techniques may nurture life; those who do not will perish. If one can deeply comprehend the arts of the bedchamber, unblock the passes, guide the qi, circulate essence, and supplement the marrow, one may attain longevity.

---

**4. The Precious Cauldron Within the Furnace**

The cauldron is the vessel for forging the divine elixir, the furnace for warming the true and nurturing qi. It must be a beautiful woman who has never given birth, pure and fair, without foul breath or bodily odors—this is the true cauldron, and using her brings great supplementation. All others, especially those described in the Five Abandonments, must not be used.

**5. The Man’s Observation of the Four Arrivals**

**5. The Man’s Observation of the Four Arrivals**

When the jade stem does not rise, the yang qi has not arrived. When it rises but does not extend, the flesh qi has not arrived. When it extends but is not firm, the bone qi has not arrived. When it is firm but not hot, the spirit qi has not arrived. In all couplings, first observe the four arrivals before proceeding.

---

**6. The Woman’s Examination of the Eight Attainments**

When a woman silently swallows her fluids, the pulse qi has arrived. When she presses her body against her partner, the stomach qi has arrived. When she moves with force, the sinew qi has arrived. When she plays with her partner’s breasts, the flesh qi has arrived. When her brows frequently knit, the liver qi has arrived. When she grasps and fondles the jade stem, the blood qi has arrived. When slick fluids flow forth, the spleen qi has arrived. When she sucks her partner’s tongue, the lung qi has arrived. Only when all eight have arrived may coupling proceed.

---

**7. Playful Teasing and Timing**

Before coupling, first compose the spirit and settle the nature. Embrace the woman, warmly caress and tease her. Suck her lips and tongue, pinch her breasts. Have her grasp and fondle the jade stem until her heart stirs. Then, with the hand, explore her yin gate—only when slick fluids appear may the cauldron be entered. Proceeding gently according to method, the woman will surely be delighted and reach her peak first.

---

**8. Stirring the Heart’s Passions**

A woman’s passions lie deep and hidden. How to arouse them? How to know when they are aroused? To stir her, if she craves wine, offer fragrant spirits; if she is tender-hearted, whisper sweet words; if she loves wealth, bestow silks and coins; if she delights in pleasure, present a mighty instrument. A woman’s heart is never fixed—seeing the scene, her passions will arise without fail.

To know when she is aroused: she may pant and tremble without cease; her eyes may close, her nose flare, and she may be unable to speak; her gaze may grow dull and fixed; her ears may redden, her face flush, and her tongue tip turn slightly cold; her hands may grow hot, her belly warm, and her speech become disordered; her spirit may wander, her body soften, and her limbs grow limp; her tongue may dry, her body press close, or the pulse of her yin gate may quicken and slick fluids overflow—all these are signs of stirred passion. At this time, the man must not act hastily. Proceeding slowly to gather, he will obtain true yang.

---

**9. Tempering the Blade and Nurturing Sharpness**

During coupling, if the jade stem is long and fills the yin gate, the woman’s passions will surely be satisfied and her pleasure complete. There is a method to enlarge the stem. As the saying goes, *"A craftsman must sharpen his tools to do his work well"*—this cannot be ignored.

Each day, between midnight and noon, when yin wanes and yang waxes, sit upright in a quiet chamber, facing east, clothed but barefoot. Compose the spirit and empty the mind. The belly should not be full—fullness causes qi to stagnate and blood to congeal—but neither should it be empty, for hunger quickens the flow of blood and qi. Exhale turbid qi through the mouth, then inhale clear qi through the nose. Swish the saliva, close the throat, and send it down to the cinnabar field, guiding it into the jade stem. Repeat this seven times, or fourteen, twenty-one, up to forty-nine times.

Rub the hands together until hot as fire. With the right hand, support the scrotum and stroke the jade stem. With the left hand, massage below the navel in a counterclockwise circle eighty-one times. Then switch hands, massaging clockwise eighty-one times. Next, extend the right hand to the coccyx, lift the root of the jade stem upward, pinch it at the base, and swing it against the left and right thighs without counting the strokes.

Afterward, embrace the woman and slowly insert the jade stem into the yin gate. Gather her fluids, inhale her nasal qi, close the throat, and send it to the jade stem to nurture it. Then, rub the stem between the hands as if twisting a rope, without counting the strokes. Over time, it will naturally grow long and large.

When engaging in battle, first bind the root of the stem with a silk sash. Then, with both hands, lift the scrotum and stem together. Swish the saliva, inhale qi, and swallow it down to the cinnabar field. Raise the coccyx to meet it, uniting upper and lower to strengthen the yang force before proceeding.

---

**10. Drilling Troops and Practicing Warfare**

When first beginning, suppress all desire. Practice first with a coarse or unattractive cauldron to avoid excessive arousal or overwhelming pleasure, making control easier. Proceed slowly: gently enter, firmly withdraw, three shallow thrusts to one deep, completing eighty-one cycles as one round. If passion stirs, immediately halt and withdraw, leaving only an inch inside. Wait until the heart’s fire settles and breathing steadies, then resume the previous method. Next, perform five shallow thrusts to one deep, then nine shallow to one deep. Avoid impatience or haste. Practicing for half a month will bring mastery.

---

**11. The Art of Securing Victory**

When encountering a truly beautiful cauldron, the heart will surely grow fond. Yet during coupling, one must feign disdain and steady the spirit. Move the jade stem slowly within the cauldron, completing one or two or three rounds. Then pause to rest the qi and calm the heart. After a moment, resume according to method. When her pleasure grows intense and she seems unable to endure, increase tenderness—she will surely reach her peak first. At that time, attack and gather according to method.

If one feels the urge to release, swiftly withdraw the jade stem and apply the sealing and closing method to quell the impulse. Once qi is settled and breathing even, resume the attack. In battle, never rush; in gathering, never hasten. Proceed with care.

These nine sections must be studied and integrated to grasp their subtleties.

---

**12. Sealing and Closing the Mysterious Pass**

Sealing and closing is the method of *"damming the Yellow River with a single hand."* Impetuous individuals must practice for over twenty days to achieve closure. Those of calm and quiet nature may succeed in ten days or so. After a month of practice, the golden pass will be eternally secure, the jade gate perpetually barred. One may act at will without leakage—this is the wondrous application of the method.

When engaging in union, let the jade stem advance and retreat slowly, employing the "three shallow, one deep" method. Close the eyes and seal the mouth, drawing qi gently through the nose to prevent panting. At the first sign of impending release, swiftly lift the waist and hips, withdrawing the jade stem by an inch without further movement. Inhale deeply, drawing the qi upward to the cinnabar field, then guide it along the spine to the coccyx, contracting the lower region as if restraining an urgent need to relieve oneself. Focus the mind and spirit, visualizing the acupoint beneath the tailbone—where one’s essence and qi reside as the most precious treasure—lest it be lost. With each inhalation, draw the essence and qi inward and swallow once. After a moment, when the impulse subsides, resume the slow and deliberate practice. Should pleasure arise again, repeat the withdrawal, inhalation, and visualization to prevent leakage.

The qi and meridians of the human body circulate ceaselessly from top to bottom. If one does not prepare in advance, by the time pleasure peaks and desire becomes uncontrollable, qi will guide essence outward, leading to self-harm. Attempting to forcibly restrain it may cause stagnant essence to flow into the bladder or kidney sac, resulting in disorders such as qi stagnation in the small intestine or bladder, or cold-induced swelling and pain in the kidneys. Generally, before desire arises, one should repeatedly lift and withdraw, frequently pausing to stabilize the jade stem, ensuring it does not wilt and that vigor remains abundant. Only after five thousand thrusts may one allow the release of stagnant essence, while the true yang qi of original vitality remains stored in the cinnabar field to nourish the spirit. With prolonged practice, one night’s effort may rival ten women—hence the name, *Sealing and Closing the Mysterious Pass*.

**13. The Three Peaks and the Great Elixir**

The upper peak is called *Red Lotus Peak*. Its elixir is named *Jade Spring*, also known as *Jade Fluid* or *Sweet Spring*, and it flows from the two apertures beneath a woman’s tongue. Its color is azure, and it is the essence of saliva. When a man licks it with his tongue, the spring wells forth into the *Flower Pool*. Sucking and swallowing it, he sends it down the *Tower of Nine Stories* into the cinnabar field, where it irrigates the five viscera, replenishes the *Mysterious Pass* on the left, and fortifies the cinnabar field on the right, generating qi and blood.

The middle peak is called *Twin Watercress Peak*. Its elixir is named *Coiled Peach*, also called *White Snow* or *Jade Nectar*, and it issues from a woman’s two breasts. Its color is white, and its taste is sweet and rich. When a man sucks and drinks it, sending it to the cinnabar field, it nourishes the spleen and stomach, enhances the spirit, and through absorption, harmonizes the woman’s meridians, easing her body and mind. It ascends to the *Flower Pool* and descends to the *Mysterious Pass*, causing essence and qi to overflow. Among the three peaks, this is the first priority. Even in women who have not given birth and lack milk, its absorption yields even greater benefits.

The lower peak is called *Purple Mushroom Peak*, also known as *Tiger’s Den* or *Mysterious Pass*. Its elixir is named *Black Lead*, or *Moon Essence*, and it resides in the woman’s *Yin Palace*. Its fluid is slick, and its gate remains closed until, during union, the woman’s passion becomes tender and enchanting, her face flushed and voice trembling—only then does the gate open, qi disperse, and fluid overflow. The man withdraws the jade stem by an inch, maintaining the posture of union, receiving qi and absorbing fluid to replenish his original yang and nourish his spirit.

These are the *Three Peaks and the Great Elixir*. Only those who understand the Dao, who forget passion in the presence of desire and dwell in desirelessness, can attain them. Thus, white hair turns black again, old age reverts to youth, and one achieves longevity without aging.

**14. The Five-Character True Mantra**

*Cun* (Visualize), *Suo* (Contract), *Chou* (Withdraw), *Xi* (Absorb), *Bi* (Seal).

*Cun* means visualization. During union, when one senses essence is about to release, swiftly withdraw the jade stem, seal the mouth, and close the eyes. Visualize the acupoint beneath the tailbone, where the essence and qi of the *Life Gate* reside as one’s most precious treasure, which must not be lost. Let the body unite while the spirit remains detached, without fixation. By visualizing thus, even if release occurs, it will be minimal, and vigor will not wane. With prolonged practice, there will be no leakage. This is the meaning of *Cun*.

*Suo* means contraction, as in shrinking back without daring to advance. When essence is about to release, swiftly contract the flanks, withdraw the jade stem, and inhale deeply, drawing qi straight to the cinnabar field. Lift the coccyx, contract the lower region as if restraining an urgent need to relieve oneself, and hold the breath, visualizing without movement. After a moment, when the impulse subsides, exhale through the mouth, embrace the woman, suck her tongue, and swallow her fluid five to seven times, sending it to the cinnabar field. This allows one to resume union without fatigue.

At the outset, one must avoid hasty or deep penetration, for once the great impulse surges, it becomes difficult to control. Forcing restraint may cause stagnant essence to disperse improperly, leading to other illnesses. Generally, frequent lifting and withdrawal make it easier to govern desire without indulgence. This is the meaning of *Suo*.

*Cun* and *Suo* are practiced simultaneously, without priority—this is the method for men to seal their essence.

*Chou* means extraction. During union, if the woman experiences pleasure, her breath will quicken and her voice tremble. The man should seal his mouth, advance gently and withdraw firmly, avoiding haste or depth. He enters only halfway, drawing the woman’s nasal qi into his abdomen through his own nose, never through the mouth, for oral inhalation harms the brain. With each inhalation and withdrawal, he absorbs her qi above and her fluid below. After a moment, when qi harmonizes above and below, the yang organ naturally hardens. At the first sign of difficulty in restraint, he should swiftly withdraw and apply the visualization method to prevent leakage. This is the meaning of *Chou*.

*Xi* means absorption. Once the woman has released, the man withdraws the jade stem by an inch, maintaining a half-union posture. He absorbs nasal qi above and slick fluid below. The nose is the *Heavenly Gate*, and below lies the *Life Gate*—the *Heavenly Gate* governs the upper elixir, while the *Life Gate* governs the lower elixir. When the *Spiritual Stalk* absorbs, water and fire cannot reach simultaneously, so the nose must absorb in unison with the *Heavenly Gate*.

A single withdrawal and a single absorption, above and below responding to each other, like water drawn upward through a bamboo tube in reverse flow. By practicing this method, one greatly benefits in replenishing essence and strengthening yang, and the spirit naturally stabilizes. However, prolonged practice harms the woman, so one must wait for her to rest for several hours before engaging again. This is the meaning of *Xi*.

Withdrawal and absorption, in their ebb and flow, connect above and below—within withdrawal lies absorption, and the two proceed in tandem. This is the method by which, after the woman has released, the man absorbs her fluid. *Bi* means sealing the mouth. During intercourse, one should close the eyes and seal the mouth, holding the breath without letting it escape, using only the nose to subtly guide and harmonize, thus avoiding panting. If not sealed, the *Human Gate* connects to the *Heavenly Gate*, and the *Heavenly Gate* connects to the *Life Gate*; if the *Heavenly Gate* of the kidney palace is not secure, it ascends and scatters, and the primordial yang essence will inevitably flow downward and leak. If the *Human Gate* is firmly sealed, brain qi descends to the kidney palace, flows into the *Jade Terrace*, and circulates above and below, transforming essence and qi into harmony, forever preventing leakage. This is the meaning of *Bi*.

The character *Bi* governs the four characters: at the onset of intercourse, one should regulate the breath and seal the qi, and until the end, one must not lose this restraint. Thus, the character *Bi* is practiced in tandem with the four-character method for a long time.

**15. Sequential Absorption and Refinement**
The immortal song says:
*"When a woman’s desire is boundless,
First stir her passion deep.
Proceed slowly in the battle,
And the general shall surely triumph."*

Before intercourse, first embrace the crucible, caress her breasts, and kiss her lips and tongue to arouse her desire. Only then should the yang organ enter the yin, engaging slowly in union, performing the nine-nines count. Close the eyes and seal the mouth, frequently withdrawing and thrusting, keeping the golden spear unswaying—this is the initial absorption of the lower peak.

Once the lower absorption is intense, the woman’s qi expands upward to respond to the middle peak. Gently embrace her, alternately inhaling and sipping her fluids, swallowing them until satisfaction is attained—this is the absorption of the middle peak.

When the middle absorption is intense, the woman’s qi further rises to the upper peak. Extend your tongue beneath hers, stirring both orifices, repeatedly absorbing her fluid and swallowing it—this is the absorption of the upper peak.

After the upper absorption is complete, the woman will reach utmost joy, and her true yin qi will be released. Withdraw the *Spiritual Stalk* by an inch, raise the body like a turtle, draw in a breath of qi, and direct it straight to the *Cinnabar Field*. Contain her qi and absorb her fluid, circulating and refining them—then the three absorptions are complete, and the woman, too, will feel thorough pleasure, her qi and pulse flowing smoothly. Afterward, exhale one or two breaths, letting her inhale and swallow them to calm her spirit and qi.

This method, once mastered, takes her released essence and returns it to one’s own unspent essence. For her, the harm is minimal; for oneself, the benefit is great. Yin and yang unite, water and fire achieve harmony—this is the wondrous application of the art of intercourse.

---

**16. Timely Circulation**
When the woman releases, signs such as panting, trembling, or moaning will appear. At this moment, calm the mind and regulate the breath, holding the woman firmly. Absorb the *Jade Spring* above, the *Coiling Peach* in the middle, and the *Moonlight* below, refining and gathering them. Circulate them from the *Weilü*, ascending in reverse along the two white meridians, threading through the spine, piercing the *Kunlun*, entering the *Mud Pill*, and flowing into the mouth, where it transforms into *Jade Nectar*. Swallow it down the *Heavy Tower* until it reaches the *Cinnabar Field*. This is called *Reversing the Flow of the Yellow River*, which fills essence and replenishes marrow, prolonging life and extending years. The key lies in "lifting qi and swallowing qi, visualizing the meridian pathways." As the saying goes: *"Where the spirit goes, qi follows; where qi goes, essence follows."*

---

**17. Fulfilling the Dao of Marriage**
Human life begins with male and female, and from them arises the union of husband and wife—the foundation of human ethics. Without intercourse, there can be no deepening of affection and fulfillment of duty, which would violate ethical norms.

Man belongs to yang, which is easily aroused and easily calmed; woman belongs to yin, which is difficult to arouse and difficult to calm. Most people, during intercourse, do not know how to control themselves, indulging in reckless stimulation and releasing in an instant, often failing to satisfy the woman’s desire. If one follows the method of absorption and battle, entering the crucible slowly and gently, without haste, for what is slow is easy to control, and what is hasty is difficult to restrain. Moreover, one must not let the woman clasp and move one’s waist. Withdrawing and thrusting leisurely, practicing the method of absorption and battle, not only benefits the body but also makes the woman affectionate. When man is fulfilled and woman is delighted, both derive equal benefit—this is the Dao of fulfilling marital duty and completing ethical relations.

---

**18. Reviving the Withered**
Cultivating the Dao and nourishing life is like grafting a withered tree to revive its vitality. Using one person to replenish another is akin to grafting a branch onto a tree—the principle is the same.

The immortal song says:
*"The world does not understand the principle of longevity,
But look to the mulberry grove where pears are grafted."*

For this practice, one must obtain a perfect precious crucible, ideally a woman between fifteen and thirty years of age. At fourteen (two sevens), she is *Lesser Yin*; at twenty-one (three sevens), she is *Abundant Yin*; at twenty-eight (four sevens), she is *Robust Yin*. *Lesser Yin* nourishes the body, *Abundant Yin* benefits longevity—these are suitable for warming and cultivation. Wait until her *Crimson Tide* converges, neither excessive nor deficient, for this is the optimal time for one’s use. With prolonged absorption and refinement, one may preserve form and abide in the world.

At thirty-five (five sevens), she becomes *Declining Yin*; at forty-two (six sevens), *Greater Yin*; at forty-nine (seven sevens), *Exhausted Yin*—one should distance oneself from these. Particularly avoid those who are overly plump (whose meridians are difficult to penetrate), overly thin (whose fluids are scant), fatigued (whose spirit and qi are insufficient), weak (who harm one’s yang spirit), weary (whose yin is cold), or ill (whose yin is toxic). All these are *Yin Predators* and must be avoided.

Moreover, absorption and replenishment depend on one’s own mind. The heart and spirit must be empty and tranquil, thoughts calm and leisurely. Recognize taboos, observe signs, withdraw and thrust gently, play and frolic slowly. Enter weakly and exit strongly, discerning the moment just before the urge to release.

Withdrawal and retention must be mastered in the moment between impending movement and actual movement. Steering the boat lies in the stern timber; loosing the crossbow depends on the trigger’s inch. The adept, knowing this, may guide it with intention.

(19) Returning to the Origin and Reverting to the Root
"Returning to the Origin" is the method of reversal. The true yin within *li* is formless yet reliable; its fire delights in soaring. When used in accord, it nurtures the embryo into a person; when used in reverse, it coagulates the pearl into treasure. This is what is meant by *"The Yellow River’s waves overturn, drawn back to re-enter the Celestial Gate."*

During absorption and refinement, one has already employed contraction and stillness to restrain it, and extraction and suction to gather it. Yet without a method for dismounting, how can it be returned and dispersed? After the act, one must lie flat, legs stretched, head resting on the pillow, heels pressed to the bed, the body entirely suspended. Exert all effort to hold the breath, swaying the body three to five times, then exhale through the nose, evenly and steadily.

If the face feels warm, it signals that the essence-qi has ascended to the *Niwan Palace*. Immediately rub the face with both hands to release the heat. Then, seal the lips to halt breathing, stir the *Flower Pool* with the tongue, and swallow the divine water into the *dantian*. Only then does the essence-qi circulate fully, becoming a substance of use to oneself. Through daily practice and monthly progress, one may wander the celestial clouds and feast in the *Yellow Court*.

(20) Planting the Seed and Securing the Fetus
In the union of man and woman, absorption brings longevity and extended years, while release secures the fetus and plants the seed. As the saying goes, *"Of the three unfilial acts, having no posterity is the greatest."* Thus, planting the seed is a vital duty of life.

A man must first replenish his essence and strengthen his kidneys to invigorate his yang qi. A woman should likewise regulate her essence and nourish her blood to warm and harmonize her womb. Then, wait until her monthly flow has passed, the red pulse fully ceased, and the womb’s gate is open—this is the proper time for union. On the first day, a boy is conceived; on the second, a girl—such is the principle of yang as odd and yin as even. Following this method, the child will inherit bright virtue, be free of illness, and easy to raise. After five days, the womb’s gate closes, and the union becomes empty.

For success, both partners must be equally aroused. If the man’s desire stirs first and his essence arrives while the woman remains unmoved, the essence, though present, will not be received. Or if the woman’s desire stirs first and peaks before the man’s, his essence arrives too late and will likewise not be received. Only when both are equally delighted, the man deeply inserting his jade stem to release, and the woman raising her waist to draw it into her palace—only then, after a brief pause before withdrawing, should she lie flat on her back. This method proves effective in every trial.

Moreover, union at the *zi* or *wu* hours (peak yang) yields a boy; union at the *mao* or *you* hours (peak yin) yields a girl. If yin blood arrives first and yang essence follows, the blood opens to enclose the essence, which enters to form bone—thus a boy is conceived. If yang essence arrives first and yin blood follows, the essence opens to envelop the blood, which remains within—thus a girl is conceived. If essence and blood arrive simultaneously, twins may result—a principle that may well hold true.

Here ends the appended record.

During the reign of Emperor Shizong, I received my government stipend in Yanjing. At that time, Master Tao, the Perfected One, had gained imperial favor through his arts. Though most of his practices were illusory and unorthodox, his methods of *cai bu* (yin-yang cultivation) alone proved substantial in effect. Thus, the sacrifices offered at the ancestral temple were graced with longevity—all owing to this. Admiring his techniques, I bribed his disciples to obtain their secret transmissions and acquired two texts: the *Pure Yang Master’s* teachings and the *Scripture of Master and Disciple*. Following their instructions, I practiced diligently. At first, control was difficult, but with time, it became effortless. Over sixty years, I bedded over a hundred women, fathered seventeen children, served five emperors, and witnessed five dynasties. Though now retired, I remain tireless in the bedchamber; even a single union suffices for several partners. Though Heaven has granted me years beyond measure, the merits of *cai bu* cannot be concealed.

As the saying goes: *"He who excels in artifice courts misfortune."* Yet man’s lifespan rarely reaches a hundred—should I perish like morning dew, I could not bear to let these two texts vanish. Thus, I entrust them to the woodblock carver, that the virtue of the Great Immortal may spread, and all in this world may together ascend to the age of Peng and Lao. If one dismisses this as absurd and baseless, they forsake their own longevity—what fault lies with me?
