**The Authentic Transmission of the Great Dao**

*Oral teachings of Wei Yaoze of Western Shu, recorded by Chen Weigong Meng of Eastern Zhe*

The Dao is sought within the heart; when the heart is empty, the Dao may be cultivated.
If one seeks merely the fruits of fortune, one remains as distant as a boat across the river.

Those who have attained the Dao must let go of attachment to self and others.
Only by releasing body and mind can one break through the Dragon and Tiger.

Cultivate and examine yourself; restrain thoughts and reflections.
Let greed and anger not arise; maintain single-minded sincerity.
The gate of Dao and virtue is none other than the Mysterious Female.

Once the medicine is obtained, spring fills the body.
Then virtue becomes fragrant as osmanthus, sweet as honey—
one knows its goodness at last.

Exert utmost sincerity and effort; do not falter or idle.
Take heed! Take heed!

The kalpa’s movement has begun, and the Dao’s fortune is awakening.
Do not delay yourself or squander Heaven’s grace!

Proceed with caution!
Refine yourself with care!
Take heed! Take heed!

**First Lecture on the Authentic Transmission of the Great Dao: The Fire Times of the Microcosmic Orbit**

What are the *fire times* of the Microcosmic Orbit?

*Times* refers to the moment.
Using the *living zi* and *living wu* hours, one awaits the proper time to ignite the fire—hence *fire times*.
Fire is *li* (☲), the spirit within the heart.
The use of fire is the wondrous function of the heart-spirit, and its wonder lies in awareness.

With natural spiritual awareness, one refines the celestial fire times to concoct the Great Medicine,
following a fixed rule.
The alchemical classics describe these rules, yet in truth, it is naturally so—
one need not force effort, for it is *wuwei* (non-doing) that accomplishes all.

The fire times arise in accordance with the natural order of cultivation and can be verified.
Yet one must cultivate naturally to attain spiritual awareness;
if even slightly unnatural, the spirit loses its efficacy,
for attachment and discursive thought cause errors in the fire times.
Thus, I name it the "Four Characters of Natural Spiritual Awareness,"
which the alchemical classics call the *Yellow Dame*.

Yellow is the color of the Dame.
The Dame embodies the pure *kun* (☷) trigram, symbolizing her gentle and yielding nature.

In *Journey to the West*, Tang Sanzang’s eighty-one tribulations are all errors in the fire times.
The causes of encountering demons—failing to fast or seeking lodging—
stem from concerns over clothing, food, and shelter, which give rise to craving.

For the human heart possesses the nature of food and desire, innate from birth:
half inherited from parents, half imprinted during the *bardo*.
Parents’ food and desire are transmitted to us—one source;
the *bardo*, with its karmic roots of food and desire, imprints our mind-ground—another.
From these two arise greed, anger, delusion, and attachment, ceaselessly.
A moment’s carelessness, a stirring thought, and the fire times err.

Zhu Bajie’s talk of disbanding the group is the scattering of fire.
The fire times of the Microcosmic Orbit are most critical;
in the Macrocosmic Orbit, natural spiritual awareness is complete, so errors are fewer.
In the Microcosmic Orbit, awareness may or may not arise, requiring vigilance at every step—
hence the alchemical classics provide detailed explanations.

As *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"A hair’s deviation prevents the elixir from forming."*
Thus, the fire times must not be mistaken.

Yet due to these detailed descriptions, scholars stray onto side paths.
For instance, theories of "nine and six," *qian* and *kun* strategies—
these are not facts but symbols representing principles.
To follow texts rigidly is to cling to form.

In *The Secret Teachings of the Dragon Gate*, Ancestor Qiu’s *Song of the Microcosmic Orbit*—
if one practices according to its verses, it is still misguided.
Master Liu Huayang’s *Wind and Fire Classic* also elaborates on fire times,
using the physical body as analogy.
Yet clinging to its phrases in practice is akin to the *Song of the Microcosmic Orbit*.

What is fire?
It is natural spiritual awareness.
What is medicine?
It is the primordial *qi*.

This is spoken from the perspective of *medicine and fire*.
From the perspective of *refinement*:
*qi* is the furnace;
spirit is the fire within the furnace;
the empty aperture is the cauldron;
the union of spirit and *qi* to attract primordial *qi* is the medicine within the cauldron.

As Bai Yuchan said:
*"Refining medicine with fire to form the elixir is using spirit to guide qi to attain the Dao."*
Li Qing’an said:
*"To become Buddha or immortal requires no strenuous effort—only concentrating spirit into the qi cavity."*
In these words, medicine, fire, cauldron, and furnace are all encompassed.

During elixir refinement, gathering is most crucial, and sealing must not be neglected.
Once true yang is gathered, fearing leakage, one must apply the work of sealing—
achieved through *stabilization* and *forgetting*.
*Stabilization* ensures true yang, when it arrives, is fully nurtured;
*forgetting* is the unforced gathering, the effortless attainment.

Sealing is ceasing the fire.
After gathering true yang, if the fire continues unchecked, excess becomes as harmful as deficiency,
risking leakage—thus, the fire must be ceased and sealed, which is most essential.

The *Song of the Microcosmic Orbit* describes verifications and methods, not the practice itself.
For how to practice, one must employ the three characters: *stabilize, forget, cease*.

When yang arises and awareness dawns, the *living zi* and *living wu* are present.
*Wu* is *li* (☲); *zi* is *kan* (☵).
Once aware, *zi* and *wu* unite; after their union, it is the time to refine the medicine.
In the Macrocosmic Orbit, *qian* (☰) and *kun* (☷) unite—
the proper time for the fire times.

Though the *living zi* and *living wu* may already be present,
one may fail to be sensitive to the *living wu* and remain unaware;
or, though aware, may not apply the fire according to method;
or, in applying the fire, may cling to form or intention—
all these render the water source impure.
*The Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"To know where the fire times commune with the numinous,
one must consult the immortals in careful discourse."*
What texts leave unexplained lies precisely here—
hence the three characters *stabilize, forget, cease* must be discussed with the immortals.
Lü Zu said:
*"Simply settle the spirit and rest the breath, letting nature take its course."*
The word *"settle"* is most essential:
when settled, the fire times of numinous awareness arise naturally.
One need only follow nature, and no error will occur.

When the Microcosmic Orbit is practiced to utmost proficiency,
a single cycle may be completed in as little as one minute.
Were one to follow the texts, which prescribe 360 breaths for *qian* and *kun*,
several minutes would be required—
impossible to finish in one.
Thus, the numbers are concealed within the principle,
and while the theory and method remain thus,
in practice it is never so.
One must not, on this account, entertain doubts.

Below follows a detailed explication of Qiu Zu’s *Song of the Microcosmic Orbit*:

*"When stillness reaches its utmost, movement arises—
a single yang returns."*

The work of the Microcosmic Orbit begins when yang is born,
and yang is born only when stillness reaches its utmost.
The yang born at the height of stillness is of the purest water source—
thus, the phrase *"stillness reaches its utmost"* demands utmost attention.
The yang born in stillness is true yang.
The yang aroused by ordinary thoughts and sensations is lewd essence.
Only when movement arises from the utmost stillness
does true primordial yang-essence come into being.

Zhang Ziyang the Perfected said:
*"The medicine is born in the mysterious aperture."*
From the medicine arises the mysterious pass;
the medicine emerges from emptiness.
At first, it rises from the yin heel vessel into the Gate of Life.
The Gate of Life is the inner kidney.
When the Gate of Life stirs, the outer kidney naturally rises;
as it ascends, it stirs the Heart Mansion,
and one becomes aware of the outer kidney’s rising—
this is the time of the *living wu*,
when the true fire within *kan*-water ascends to unite with *li*.

*"A single yang returns"* is the hexagram *Fu* (☳, Return), Earth Thunder.
The seven-day return is the creative transformation of Heaven and Earth.
The true yang beneath the earth is born once every seven days.
The *Book of Changes* states:
*"In Return, do we not see the heart of Heaven and Earth?"*
Daoists abbreviate this as *"Heaven’s Heart."*
When a single yang returns and the outer kidney stirs and rises,
this is the moment when Heaven’s Heart is revealed.
The rising of the outer kidney is caused by the surge of yang-qi.
This yang-qi is the principle-qi of the Great Ultimate,
identical to that which, in the primordial Great Ultimate, generates Heaven and Earth.
When this qi arrives in the body, the outer kidney rises—
just as, at the winter solstice, a single yang is born beneath the heavy yin,
bursting forth from the earth in a *zhen*-thrust to restore Heaven’s Heart.
The rising of yang in the human body likewise ascends from below,
mirroring this process—
its rising is the return of a single yang, the hexagram *Fu*.
When stillness reaches pure yin,
a single yang line is born beneath five yin lines—
hence *"returns."*

At this time, though the medicine is already present,
it is tender and cannot yet be gathered—
one can only begin from this point.
When one’s practice reaches the state of profound obscurity,
all phenomena dissolve into silence,
and a single yang returns—
in that fleeting, indistinct moment,
the outer kidney suddenly rises:
Heaven and human unite in spontaneous arising.
The primordial yang first stirs in the body,
but its rising is not yet firm,
for only a single yang is present.
The *Daode Jing* states:
*"Indistinct, yet within it there is an image;
vague, yet within it there is a thing;
obscure, yet within it there is an essence;
its essence is utterly real—
within it there is sincerity."*
Here, the *"image"* is the sign of yang’s return.
Why does yang rise?
Because of the presence of essence—
this is the primordial essence of emptiness.
When yang is born and felt in the body,
it is the arrival of primordial essence,
the appearance of the primordial, undifferentiated supreme essence—
thus, essence is born.
In ordinary intercourse, yang also rises and essence is born,
but it differs from this primordial essence—
hence the distinction *"utterly real."*
*"Sincerity"* refers to reliability:
Heaven’s Heart returns every seven days,
unchanged through the ages—
hence *"sincerity."*
The rising of yang is the sign of Heaven’s Heart’s revelation,
and the adept relies on this sign to perform the work of gathering.

When one reaches the state of utmost emptiness and profound stillness,
a single yang will invariably return—
whether at twenty or a hundred years of age, it is the same.
What reliability is this!
Yet only in the state of profound obscurity and indistinctness
can this sincerity be found.

Confucius said, *"Since ancient times, all must die; without trust, the people cannot stand."* Only with trust can one transcend death, establish destiny, and attain the treasure of life. Zhu Xi did not understand this, hence his commentary misses the mark. For only by knowing this can one avoid death, yet also not be hindered by death—life and death lie within one’s own grasp, not Heaven’s. One holds the reins oneself.

When both heart and body attain stillness, a single yang will invariably return, enabling one to move freely in and out of life and death, unbound by the constraints of creation. In utmost stillness, movement arises, returning to the Supreme Ultimate; the Supreme Ultimate returns to the Ultimateless, and from this, a single yang comes back. If one can sit in stillness to generate yang, that is well; if not, one may instead practice sleeping meditation, naturally attaining stillness and generating yang. As the saying goes: *"At dusk, one retires to rest"*—this is the time of greatest repose, when both body and heart are still. Yet most people are obscured by the seven emotions and six desires, even in sleep failing to achieve true stillness, their dreams disturbed by craving and lust, never finding rest. If one truly stills both body and heart, sleep becomes dreamless; in profound stillness, yang rises, and a single yang returns—heart and spirit naturally awaken. For when spirit and qi unite, as qi stirs, spirit stirs with it and perceives.

*"When the medicine is born, the spirit knows—ah, the wondrous secret connects to the numinous."* "Knowing" here means *"knowing the white, guarding the black, so that spirit and brightness come of themselves."* The single yang is the medicine; its return is the medicine’s birth; the return of a single yang is the *living midnight hour*. The spirit’s knowing is the *living noon hour*—when the primordial qi arrives, one knows it. For true yang advances from the yin heel vessel, stirring the true fire of the Gate of Life, causing the outer kidneys to rise and surge upward to the heart, where the spirit awakens and perceives. At the extreme of yin, yang is born and the medicine appears; within yang, yin is born and the spirit knows. The living midnight and living noon connect—qi stirs, and spirit follows its movement. As the *Canticle* says: *"In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, one awaits the moment of presence or absence."* Within this lies a wondrous secret, through which one may connect to the numinous.

Connecting to the numinous means uniting with the numinous qi of Heaven and Earth and one’s own numinous nature. The wondrous secret is the method of *"the medicine’s birth and the spirit’s knowing"*—the method of the living midnight and living noon. When we should begin the work of gathering, if one knows and cultivates this, one naturally achieves *"Heaven and man unite in manifestation, the foundation of the myriad transformations is set"*—hence *"connecting to the numinous."*

*"When the tender yang first arises—ah, it is young and must not be gathered."* Once this secret is understood, one must proceed to gather. If the medicine is too young, it cannot be gathered; if too old, it also cannot be gathered. Confucius said: *"The Dao cannot be put into practice, and I know why: the wise go beyond it, the foolish do not reach it. The Dao cannot be made clear, and I know why: the worthy go beyond it, the unworthy do not reach it."* Whether too old or too young, both are unusable—excess and deficiency are the same. Only when there is neither excess nor deficiency, when it accords with the mean of the moment, is it proper. Confucius called this the *"timely sage"*—precisely the *"mean"* before joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness arise. The work of gathering is active and intentional, the *"harmony"* when these emotions are expressed with perfect moderation. When sealed and secured, this becomes the harmonious fusion and coagulation.

The tender yang is the moment of its initial arising. When the faint yang first stirs, though it rises, it is not yet firm—too young to be used, it cannot be gathered. The single yang of *Fu* (Return) cannot be gathered; the two yangs of *Lin* (Approach) also cannot be gathered. Only when the hexagram *Tai* (Peace) is reached—three yins above and three yangs below, perfectly balanced—when true lead weighs eight ounces and true mercury half a catty, when yin and yang attain equilibrium, can one proceed to gather. At its initial arising, it is too tender to gather; one must stabilize it in the empty space beyond the nose, using fire to drive the metal into motion, allowing yang to fully generate. For true gold must be accumulated drop by drop.

*"When the medicine is firm and full—ah, the fifteenth day’s radiance is complete; the time has come to gather urgently—ah, do not let it slip away."* When the medicine is firm and full, it is ready to be gathered. The fifteenth day’s radiance is complete—this is the time of the full moon. Firmness means the moment when yang rises and solidifies. At this time, there is neither excess nor deficiency; it is the perfect full moon, and one must not miss it—one must immediately begin the work of gathering.

What is meant by gathering? It is to employ the work of *"forgetting."* At this moment, one must hold fast and not lose it, practicing a gathering that is no-gathering, a taking that is no-taking. Each day, yang arises, yet most people let it slip by, failing to gather it because they do not know the secret. When the medicine is firm and full, this is the true midnight hour. When one first senses its movement, this is the living noon hour. The *"time"* in *"the time has come to gather urgently"* is the true noon hour. The outer kidneys first rise lightly, then rise higher, and finally become firm—this is because the medicine is full and surges upward to the heart, so that upon sensing it again, one knows it is firm. This is the true noon hour—the very crux of the oral secret. Scholars must take this to heart!

*"If one waits too long—ah, gathering will yield no result."* This is as the *Awakening to Reality* says: *"When gold meets the distant full moon, it is no longer fit to taste."* The word *"long"* demands special attention: if it has already been firm for too long and the moment is past, this is *"long"*—by the seventeenth, eighteenth, or nineteenth day, the moon has waned too far, grown too old to be used, and cannot form the elixir. In these few lines, the youth and maturity of the medicine in the microcosmic orbit and its firing times have been fully explained. What follows concerns the principle of spirit and qi depending on each other, the living midnight and living noon connecting—when qi stirs, spirit follows its movement. As the *Canticle* says: *"In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, one awaits the moment of presence or absence."* Within this lies the wondrous secret.

When *"qi races outward, spirit too races outward; when spirit returns to the root, qi too returns to the root,"* the first line speaks of movement—where one moves, the other follows; the second, of stillness—where one rests, the other abides. The first line describes the medicine’s arising and spirit’s awareness; the second, the gathering of spirit into the qi-cavern. The first line shows qi stirring and spirit following; the second, spirit settling and qi likewise abiding. The first line concerns the linking of living midnight and living noon—when qi stirs, awareness arises, and spirit follows—this is the teaching on the external. True yang comes from without, so qi arrives from outside, and spirit emerges to meet it, which is what is meant by *"lead arrives, mercury welcomes."*

The second line speaks of the moment of gathering and sealing. At first, one employs stillness—this is the work of the external medicine. Once yang’s arising is settled, one must gather it, applying the work of *"forgetting."* Qi returns, and spirit follows, entering together into the crucible. Qi is the medicine, and spirit is the fire; spirit returns to the root, and qi restores life. As the *Daodejing* says: *"To return to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life."* Nurturing qi is the work of establishing life. When stillness reaches the point of forgetting the external, one returns to the root. In gathering, one employs forgetting, so that qi returns to the root and spirit likewise returns to the root.

With fire, the medicine is refined: spirit returns to the root, and true yang arises externally. One then draws this yang back into the crucible—not gathering as gathering, not taking as taking—until gathering is complete, the root is returned to, and the body is forgotten. Qi too returns to the root. When spirit and qi return to the root, qi nears fullness, and the external kidneys descend. Gathering is one phase; sealing is another—these are the two phases of gathering the *muni*.

When *"qi returns and nears fullness, the phases of gathering and sealing are complete; at midnight, the fire is kindled—this must be clearly distinguished,"* once the descent occurs and the phases of gathering and sealing are complete, one should cease firing and halt the work. If one does not know when to stop, the medicine will leak away. What follows describes the verification of the work, not the work itself. As Ancestor Lü said: *"There is a natural firing sequence."* The firing sequence has its own natural order. What follows concerns the principles of advancing yang-fire and retreating yin-tally within the firing process.

When a person moves from extreme stillness to movement, the first yang revives. Through the work of stillness, true yang arrives in the body, and when it is full, one proceeds to gather. Once gathered, spirit and qi have returned to the root, and one must cease firing—this is one cycle of the work. Practicing thus daily and persistently, when yang is fully gathered, the accumulation of gold fills the abdomen, reaching the point of true gold filling the belly. This gives rise to the refining process, enabling the three hundred and sixty celestial revolutions to swiftly complete. Metal, wood, water, and fire arrive simultaneously to interact and gather the external medicine. At this stage of practice, advancing yang and retreating yin proceed in unison. Once the phases of gathering and sealing are complete, one naturally kindles the fire and retreats the yin from the body.

When asked *"What is fire?"*—it is the postnatal breath. *"How is fire moved?"*—by exhaling downward and inhaling upward. Fire is the qi of postnatal breathing. This is natural work: at this stage, original spirit becomes numinous, and natural spiritual awareness arises. Exhaling is the preceding descent; inhaling is the subsequent ascent.

When *"the subtlety of using fire is like nothing yet something,"* this means that nothing is established—its breathing’s ascent and descent, its exit and entry, seem present yet remain as if absent. This is what is meant by *"simply settle the spirit and rest the breath, following nature,"* employing the work of forgetting without clinging to appearances.

When *"refining fire within the crucible imitates the true person’s breath,"* this means gathering postnatal qi into the crucible, emulating the true person’s breathing. *"The true person’s breath reaches the heels"*—*"heels"* signifies depth, referring to true breathing. At this time, the breath reaches the heels.

When *"fire must have its phases, counting the breaths’ exit and entry; called the water-clock, it fixes the time,"* the work of counting breaths is the martial fire of the water-clock. One must silently count, which is the water-clock. The water-clock fixes the time, and this is also used to mark the hours. By employing the water-clock’s martial fire and listening to the breath’s exit and entry, one achieves solidity and attains the true midnight hour, at which point one may gather and refine the medicine.

From midnight to dawn, the six yang lines use nine—thirty-six breaths—this is the time for advancing yang-fire. At the true midnight hour, one must employ forgetting. Naturally, there are thirty-six breaths—these thirty-six breaths are the advancing fire.

From noon to midnight, the six yin lines use six—twenty-four breaths—this retreats the yin within the body. Cool fluid descends, passing from the crown through the *heavy tower* into the abdomen—this is the retreating yin-tally. The twenty-four breaths remain natural; one must not cling to the appearance of counting. One’s spiritual awareness naturally governs the firing sequence to refine the medicine.

At dawn’s yang bathing, yang-fire should be extinguished; at dusk’s yin bathing, yin-tally should be halted. Neither descending nor ascending—this is the scene of bathing. Compared to the great celestial revolution, it bears only a faint resemblance. At dawn and dusk, bathing requires cessation and forgetting. Cessation means neither exhaling nor inhaling, halting the breath without ascent or descent—this is the bathing of dawn and dusk.

In summary, when *zi* stirs and *wu* awakens, the medicine is produced and the spirit knows—one must then proceed to stabilize it. Stabilization is the martial fire of the water clock. Stabilization resides in the empty space beyond the nose, where one listens with the ears to the breath, counting its ingress and egress. Only thus can the medicine be solidified, and the true *zi* and true *wu* moments arrive. At this time, one should gather it, employing the work of "forgetting," which is also the moment of *mao* and *you* bathing.

At the moment of the great cross-merging, once the true *zi* hour arrives, advance the yang-fire. As awareness arises at the true *wu* hour, retreat the yin-tally. *Zi* and *wu* arrive simultaneously. The thirty-six and twenty-four are the measures of the firing sequence. Yet the *Du* is long while the *Ren* is short: the long has thirty-six breaths, the short only twenty-four, and they precisely correspond. Their point of intersection lies between *mao* and *you*, where internally water and fire merge, and externally metal and wood converge. Metal, wood, water, and fire all meet in the Central Palace—this is the "taking from *Kan* to fill *Li*," where the two earths form the *gui*.

Yet all this work unfolds within the state of forgetting. The six yang and six yin are but proportional measures of the method. The *Du* has thirty-six breaths, the *Ren* twenty-four—a long and a short, their work completed entirely in forgetting. Naturally, spontaneously, without a single thought, body and mind in non-doing, yet the spirit and qi act of themselves. Above and below merge as water and fire; left and right converge as metal and wood. The two pairs unite in the Central Palace, the nine returns and seven reversions arriving simultaneously, without precedence or sequence, differing slightly from the great celestial revolution. (See Figure 1)

*"Three hundred cycles of the celestial revolution,
Excluding the count of *mao* and *you*;
Three hundred sixty,
Including *mao* and *you* in the name.
Add five degrees more,
A quarter’s division,
To mirror the intercalary surplus,
A full circuit of the celestial revolution.
Returning once more to stillness,
Bathe as before;
Spirit congealed in the qi-cavern,
Await the next arising of yang."*

At this stage, performing the work once completes a single circuit of the celestial revolution. After one circuit, cease the firing and bathe, congealing the qi in its cavern to await the next arising of yang. After three hundred sixty circuits, the work of the minor celestial revolution is complete.

From *zi* to *wu*, from *wu* to *hai*, when the external kidneys descend, this marks one circuit of the celestial revolution.

*"With prolonged practice,
Essence returns as qi;
The revolving wind ascends straight,
A hundred days yield efficacy."*

The revolving wind ascending straight refers to circulating the celestial revolution daily. As the work continues, the body’s essence transforms entirely into qi. The minor celestial revolution’s work is accomplished in roughly a hundred days. After these hundred days, the foundation is laid, giving birth to the fetal immortal—hence the efficacy of a hundred days.

*"Six kinds of tremors,
Seven-day oral instructions;
The great revolution’s work begins,
Seek again the ford of delusion."*

From here to the six kinds of tremors, there remains a year of nurturing work. After a year of nurturing, one should proceed to the work of the great celestial revolution, seeking the seven-day oral instructions for practice to traverse this great celestial revolution—thus, "the great revolution’s work begins, seek again the ford of delusion."

In essence, the minor celestial revolution’s practice hinges on three words: "stabilize, forget, cease." Yet the actual work unfolds entirely within the arising of yang—arising to practice, descending to conclude. What one feels in the body is but a pervasive tingling. When the practice becomes proficient, the tingling moves from back to front, and atop the crown, cool fluid descends—this is the sign of advancing yang and retreating yin. When yang descends and the tingling vanishes, one cycle of work is complete, with no other method. The practitioner should attend carefully to these two matters.

The second lecture on the true oral transmission of the Great Dao completes the explanation of the firing sequence and phenomena in Qiu Zu’s *Song of the Minor Celestial Revolution*. The minor celestial revolution begins at the arising of yang; the moment yang arises is the time to start the fire, and when yang descends, the time to cease it.

There is another account, Wu Zhenren’s *Nine Chapters on the Dao of Elixir*, which describes the "three appearances of yang-light"—also a phenomenon of the minor celestial revolution. At the outset of practice, this sign cannot be fully perceived, for one remains in a state of vagueness, practicing the "gathering without gathering, taking without taking." The work must proceed in utter chaos—if clarity arises, the water source is impure—thus, without clarity, even if the sign appears, it cannot be recognized.

By the final stage, when the yang-light appears three times, the foundation is laid, and one must cease the fire. The appearance of yang-light is the "brightness born in an empty room," a white light radiating between the brows, flashing like lightning. The *Sutra* speaks of the Tathāgata emitting white light from between the brows—this is it. At its first appearance, the moment of yang’s arising, it is not easily noticed. Only after the living *zi* arrives does the living *wu* follow, and the spirit becomes aware. The yang-light flashes and vanishes in an instant—this is the first appearance of yang-light, as detailed in *The Orthodox Theory of Celestial Immortals*.

When yang is full and ready for gathering, the medicine solidifies. After gathering, the yang-light flashes again—this is the second appearance. During our practice, we remain detached from phenomena, body and mind utterly still, and thus do not clearly perceive this sign; even the second appearance may not be distinctly noticed.

As previously mentioned, when the external kidneys descend, this is the time to cease the fire. The "three appearances of yang-light" also occur at this juncture.

When the external kidneys retract, this is called the third appearance of yang-light, and the fire must be ceased. At this point, one may faintly perceive the sensation, yet the yang-light is exceedingly swift—formerly, Adept Wu could not stop the fire at this moment but only at the fourth appearance, by which time the fire had already passed its mark. Ceasing the fire at the third appearance of yang-light is precisely the right moment.

Nowadays, one does not rely on the appearance of yang-light to cease the fire but instead depends on the expansion and contraction of the external kidneys. When they retract and a wave of tingling numbness courses through the body, the fire must be stopped at once, lest the appearance of yang-light go unrecognized and the fire not be withdrawn in time, leading to error. However, when the accumulation of gold is complete, the original spirit becomes keenly aware, and natural spiritual perception arises, enabling clear recognition.

This yang-light is the radiance of lead-flower. At its first appearance, lead first arrives in the body; at the second, lead is fully abundant; and at the third, lead is sufficient and enters the cauldron. With the heart fasting and sitting in forgetfulness, the empty chamber generates brightness—this is it. The so-called "empty chamber" is what lies before one’s eyes, not something that emerges from the body but rather from beyond it.

The work of the minor celestial orbit is that of refinement. The so-called "civil refinement and martial tempering" is the process of refining the medicine, the primordial undifferentiated essence. This single drop of essence, refined within the body, transforms all the body’s yin essence into qi—this is called "refining essence into qi." Initially, this practice is time-consuming, but with mastery, the duration shortens, hence the saying of "gathering and assembling." It begins with one hour, then reduces to a quarter-hour, then a minute, and finally a second—the more one practices, the swifter it becomes. Once mastery is achieved, true yang accumulates to fullness, and the foundation is established.

Accumulating yang is the return to emptiness and the refinement of the self. When the refinement of the self is perfected, the foundation becomes firm, and at this point, phenomena arise: breath enters and exits through the entire body, the eighty-four thousand pores all open, and yang retracts like a tortoise. The work of the minor celestial orbit is then complete, and the foundation is laid. Yet there remains the work of gentle nurturing, which must be undergone. For after yang arises, it must be gathered and sealed.

Once the inner elixir is obtained and sealed within the cinnabar field, it must still be gently nurtured to ensure it remains perpetually retracted like a tortoise, manifesting the *Hidden-Yin-Like-a-Stallion* phase. Without such nurturing, even if the elixir is attained, it cannot be preserved—thus, this phase of gentle cultivation is most essential. The nurturing period spans one year, comprising twelve months, though excluding the months of *mao* (卯) and *you* (酉), which are times for "bathing," leaving ten months for the work of nurturing the Dao-embryo. As the *Yellow Court Classic* states: *"The zither-heart in triple harmony dances with the embryonic immortal."*

The minor celestial orbit concludes with the initial formation of the embryo; after completing the major celestial orbit, the embryo matures, allowing the spirit to depart. The term "embryo formation" is metaphorical—it refers to obtaining the medicine and coalescing the inner elixir. The one-year nurturing period is but a rough estimate; it may extend beyond or fall short of a year, varying by individual. Only after this year does one truly manifest the *Hidden-Yin-Like-a-Stallion* phase, perpetually embodying the body of primordial innocence, becoming a *human immortal*—an embryonic immortal, or *earthly immortal*, a terrestrial transcendent capable of preserving life without death.

The minor and major celestial orbits are not continuous; between them lies a year of nurturing. The minor orbit generates and then gathers, producing yang from emptiness, which is then collected upon its arrival in the body. The major orbit, however, gathers first and then generates, requiring prior accumulation to enable generation through gathering. The qi amassed during this year of nurturing prepares for the gathering in the major orbit. Only after this year may one undertake the seven-day transmission of celestial secrets to gather the great medicine and practice the major celestial orbit.

Ancient perfected ones obscured this sequence, placing the nurturing phase *after* the major orbit, inverting the order to avoid disclosure. In truth, the nurturing precedes it, for they wished to keep it secret. After the major orbit, there follows a three-year "nursing" phase—this is the work of returning to emptiness. Upon completing the year of nurturing, one may proceed to the major orbit and spirit departure. Only after achieving the major orbit does the three-year nursing phase begin. Finally, there is the nine-year "wall-facing" phase, which is the pulverization of emptiness. This stage is optional.

The wall-facing practice pertains entirely to the cultivation of *xing* (nature). Those who cultivate the supreme vehicle begin with returning to emptiness, grounding all subsequent work in *xing* cultivation, rendering the nine-year phase unnecessary. For those who do not initially cultivate the primordial Dao but pursue other elixir methods, these nine years are indispensable, as they serve to sweep away all residual obstructions.

After the seven-day spirit departure in the major orbit, if one wishes to relinquish the physical form, the three-year nursing phase may be omitted. If not, the three years may still be undertaken. However, the most critical and necessary topic here is the one-year nurturing phase, not the nine-year wall-facing practice.

This nurturing work differs from contemporary methods; it requires seclusion in the mountains. If remaining in the world, one must secure a secluded chamber, shielded from external sounds, to practice. Only by residing in stillness and dedicating oneself wholeheartedly can the year’s work be completed. Without mountain seclusion or a suitable quiet space, one cannot focus entirely, and the modern concurrent cultivation method must suffice—though a year may then prove insufficient, extending to three. For those practicing amidst worldly affairs, the period may stretch to four or five years, yet this poses no ultimate hindrance, for the goal will still be attained.

This work is not inherently difficult; the key lies in genuine stillness. As the *Awakening to Reality* states: *"Before refining the returning elixir, do not enter the mountains—all before and after in the hills is not true lead."* Lead exists in the world, born from profound emptiness and stillness within the practitioner, not as a mountain product. Now that the inner elixir is obtained, mountain seclusion is necessary. The minor orbit’s active, willed practice can be performed unseen, even upon the bed at dawn and dusk, but the later effortless phase reveals it—thus, seclusion is required for undivided focus, unlike earlier stages.

The essence of this work is perpetual *entering samadhi*. Samadhi is a Buddhist term, but here it involves both *ding* (stabilization) and *wang* (forgetting). With a secluded chamber, one may set fixed hours for practice: of the twelve daily hours, excluding four for nightly sleep, eight remain. Deducting two for rest leaves six for cultivation. For non-exclusive practice, four to six hours may suffice, without rigid scheduling—this is the work of purifying the heart and clarifying the mind, intimately tied to effortless alignment of body and spirit.

The first priority is *ding*, the stabilization described in the *Great Learning* as the foundation for stillness, tranquility, and clarity. The second is *wang*, the forgetting in *Daodejing* where form is forgotten yet preserved. The difference from ordinary practice lies in balancing *ding* and *wang* equally: for every two hours of practice, one hour is for *ding*, one for *wang*. They must be evenly matched—neither *ding* in excess nor *wang* deficient, nor intermingled. This is the work of the *Tun* (屯) and *Meng* (蒙) hexagrams, the "morning *Tun*, evening *Meng*" practice.

At *Tun* in the morning—when the sun rises—one fears the elixir may be harmed by the yang fire, and so must withdraw the fire; withdrawing fire requires *wang* (forgetting). By evening, when the sun sets and yang light is gone, one fears the cold *qi* may harm the elixir, and so must advance the fire; advancing fire requires *ding* (stabilization). In practice, this is simply balancing water and fire. In the morning, one fears dryness, so water is used to temper the lead—this is the work of morning *Tun*, the work of *wang*. In the evening, one fears cold, so fire is used to temper the mercury (drawing lead to replenish mercury)—this is the work of evening *Meng*, the work of *ding*. Morning requires *wang*, evening requires *ding*; in truth, *ding* and *wang* are water and fire, and must be kept even. For every hour of *ding*, there must be an hour of *wang*; for every two hours of *ding*, two of *wang*—imbalance must be avoided.

In practice, morning *Tun* and evening *Meng* are undertaken simultaneously, with time divided equally: half for *ding*, half for *wang*. At this stage, the work of *ding* and *wang* becomes effortless. Initially, one may have spiritual awareness yet lack naturalness; with long practice, one attains ease and spontaneity, where spiritual awareness naturally regulates all, and deliberate *ding* or *wang* is no longer needed. The six senses are purified, myriad distractions cease, and one sits in natural *ding*, natural *wang*. We need only adjust to maintain balance—otherwise, one risks either dryness or cold. Even in sessions as brief as ten or twenty minutes, this principle holds: where there is *wang*, there must be *ding*; where there is *ding*, there must be *wang*, with equal time allotted to both. This is how we regulate the firing process.

Daily practice of six hours suffices for a year. If unable, or if reduced to one or two hours, the duration must be extended proportionally. The essence of the two methods lies in *ding* generating mercury and *wang* generating lead, for once the inner elixir is formed, it comprises both lead and mercury. In the practice of refining the golden elixir, maintaining balance at every stage ensures that lead and mercury remain equal—like half a catty and eight taels. When lead and mercury are full, the firing process for the great celestial circuit is reached.

What we now obtain is the prenatal within the postnatal. The yang born of emptiness is prenatal. Once it enters the body, it transforms into the postnatal, though its essence remains prenatal—hence it is called the prenatal within the postnatal. From this, another substance may be generated: the prenatal of the prenatal. This year of nurturing practice prepares for the prenatal within the prenatal.

The *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* states: *"Water fears drying, fire fears cold,"* and *"When gathering the medicine, regulate the fire; when the firing is sufficient, do not harm the elixir."* This is the principle here.

The hexagrams of the *Yijing* are always presented in pairs: *Kan* (Water) opposes *Li* (Fire); *Water-Fire Ji Ji* (Already Across) opposes *Fire-Water Wei Ji* (Not Yet Across); *Heaven-Earth Pi* (Stagnation) opposes *Earth-Heaven Tai* (Peace). Paired hexagrams stand in opposition. Apart from the four hexagrams *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, the firing process uses the remaining sixty hexagrams as its standard, aligning with the facts of alchemical yin-yang pairing and the correspondence of two and eight. Each day, one *ding* and one *wang*, one water and one fire, stand in opposition yet complement each other. Thus, the firing process corresponds to the hexagrams: *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* serve as the body, while the other sixty serve as function. Each day uses two hexagrams—morning *Tun* and evening *Meng*—interconnected and harmonious. If *ding* is *Earth-Heaven Tai*, then *wang* is *Heaven-Earth Pi*; the correspondence is perfect.

Hexagrams have auspicious and inauspicious omens, and these arise from movement. Balance ensures no fault; imbalance breeds misfortune. The *Mirror for Ingredient Entry* says: *"Receiving qi is auspicious; guard against becoming inauspicious."* At the outset of receiving qi, auspiciousness comes easily; in nurturing the firing process, one must guard against danger—this is what is meant by "guarding against danger and considering risk."

The *Great Learning* states: *"Only after stability can one deliberate."* Even after the small celestial circuit, one must remain vigilant, exercising utmost care to avoid imbalance—whether cold or dryness—for balance is paramount. The earlier requirement for a secluded chamber serves this purpose. During practice, one must use a quiet room and have an attendant to guard against disturbances. Any startling disturbance disrupts balance.

Since ancient times, accomplished practitioners have always had companions, for this very reason. In our practice, we must set fixed times—morning and evening—and ensure someone outside the room oversees and attends to us, preventing human disturbances from disrupting the firing process. This is the work of "non-doing that accomplishes everything," unknown to outsiders. It differs from the small celestial circuit, which can be practiced on a bed to gather and refine without others knowing. Here, with a quiet room and attendant, all will be aware.

Through this nurturing, the inner elixir transforms into golden liquid. Only when the golden liquid is full can the great elixir be born. The "inner" and "outer" refer to the small and great emptiness. The small celestial circuit gathers from the external to form the internal, producing the inner elixir—thus, external medicine forms the inner elixir. The great celestial circuit gathers from the internal to form the external, producing the outer elixir—thus, internal medicine forms the outer elixir.

This marks their distinct difference—what is called the Dao of uniting inner and outer is precisely this.

**Third Lecture on the True Oral Transmission of the Great Dao**
The ten-month nurturing practice has always been left undetailed by alchemical schools, for it is the secret formula of the Dao of elixir cultivation. To summarize its essentials: it is the state of settled forgetfulness and perfect equilibrium. At this stage, one has attained the true, natural spiritual awareness, where settled forgetfulness and equilibrium arise spontaneously—any deviation would be an error. As *Awakening to Reality* states: “A hair’s breadth of difference, and the elixir will not form.” “Regulating” means precisely this: achieving equilibrium. Now that the inner elixir has formed, only by nurturing it with the method of settled forgetfulness and equilibrium can the outer elixir be generated and the yang spirit completed. For the inner elixir merely transforms the yin within the body, elevating one to the rank of human immortal. As for the host of yin spirits, the karmic roots accumulated over kalpas, and the intermediate yin of the womb—these the inner elixir cannot transform. Only the great elixir can do so. Therefore, after forming the inner elixir, one must nurture it to generate the outer elixir, thereby completing the work and attaining the rank of the Golden Immortal of Great Awakening.

Beyond the *Song of the Small Celestial Circuit*, Ancestor Qiu also composed a *Song of the Great Dao*, which serves as the guiding principle for all the songs in *The Secret Essentials of the Dragon Gate*. Here, we shall present and explicate it as follows:

*“The Great Dao, profound and subtle, appears before the eyes.”*
The opening line immediately points to the crux. The Great Dao is deep and unfathomable, yet its manifestation lies right before us.

*“Since ancient times, those who have attained it have relied solely on transmission from a teacher.”*
The source of the Great Dao is not fully expounded in texts; it depends entirely on the oral transmission of a true master.

*“Vague and metaphorical, all teachings ultimately fall short.”*
Even what is written in texts consists of metaphors, too nebulous to be taken as reality, and all are one-sided. From ancient times, those who wrote books did so in response to the ills of their age, seeking remedies for the world’s afflictions. Thus, the writings of the Song and Yuan dynasties emphasized “active practice,” for their era had sunk into passivity and solitude, requiring the spur of active cultivation. By the Ming and Qing dynasties, writings leaned toward “non-doing,” for the age had degenerated into the debauchery of “female crucible” and sexual arts, necessitating the remedy of non-doing. Since the true oral formulas could not be fully disclosed, texts often resorted to analogies and metaphors—vague and one-sided in the end.

*“A single phrase encompasses ten thousand volumes: the work begins in the prenatal.”*
This means that the oral formulas for cultivating the Dao are all contained within the phrase “the work begins in the prenatal.”

*“Named yet formless, the primordial qi is fundamentally empty.”*
The primordial qi is something named yet formless, its essence fundamentally empty. Cultivation must begin from this emptiness; what is gathered and obtained is precisely this.

*“When yang arrives subtly, the external form stirs in an instant.”*
The prenatal qi emerges from the formless. Its arrival is exceedingly subtle, accumulating bit by bit—hence “subtly.” How can one verify its arrival? It is seen in the “stirring of the external form in an instant.” When the yang organ stirs, one knows the true prenatal yang has arrived. “External form stirs in an instant” refers to the moment of initial arousal. The instant it rises, it is present; the moment one thinks, it is gone—hence “instant.” This word is of utmost importance. The work of gathering the prenatal begins at the moment of arousal, before thought arises. Once the instant passes and stray thoughts intrude, the source of water is no longer pure.

*“In the hazy state between dream and waking, it shifts into the elixir field.”*
When does the yang stir? Precisely in the hazy state between sleep and dream, at the moment of arousal from slumber. Why can one be hazy between dream and waking? Because the spirit has entered the elixir field, embracing the qi, so that when yang stirs, one becomes aware of it.

*“Stir the wind of Xun to regulate the medicine before gathering it.”*
Before gathering, one must stir the wind of Xun to regulate it, ensuring it is neither too raw nor too ripe. The wind of Xun is the martial fire of the water clock. Without this, thoughts arise, and the source of water is no longer pure. Stirring the wind of Xun serves two purposes: to still thoughts, and to regulate the medicine. With these two, upon awakening, one must immediately settle in the empty space outside the nose, listening to the breath with the ears. Only after stirring the wind of Xun and properly regulating the medicine can one gather it. Otherwise, one errs either by absence or by excess. Absence means there is nothing to gather; excess means thoughts intrude and the source is impure, making gathering impossible. Therefore, one must first use wind and fire to regulate the medicine—this is most crucial. Only with the martial fire of the water clock can the medicine fully mature, avoiding the pitfalls of absence or excess.

*“From nothing, something arises, and the celestial mechanism appears before the eyes.”*
This medicine arises from nothing, and once born, the celestial mechanism manifests before the eyes—this is the phenomenon before one’s gaze, the appearance of the mysterious pass. A white circle appears before the eyes, hazy as a full moon, combining the waxing and waning phases into the fifteenth-day moon—the precise moment for gathering. When this phenomenon appears before the eyes, the true midnight hour arrives. For when regulated with martial fire, the true midnight and true noon hours are born.

*“The tiger inhales the dragon’s soul—timing comes naturally.”*
When yang arises from the formless, it comes from without to within, traveling from the yin heel vessel to the Gate of Life, stirring the outer kidneys. As it surges upward to the heart, one becomes aware of its movement.

When martial fire is applied, the fire compels the metal to move, and the outer kidneys become firm and solid. Simultaneously, the heart perceives this firmness—this is the arrival of the true noon hour. By fanning the wind to regulate the fire, it remains fixed externally, and yang, born without ceasing, comes from without to within, gradually filling the body, all felt upon the flesh. Thus, the outer kidneys grow firm. Once firm, yang qi ascends, stirring the heart-spirit; the heart-spirit descends—this is the union of water and fire, the merging of spirit and qi, hence called “the tiger inhales the dragon’s soul.” Only when water and fire have united do the true midnight and true noon hours arise, thus it is said, *“Timing comes naturally.”*

*“Body and mind in reverie, the four limbs like softened silk”*—at this moment, body and mind seem neither awake nor asleep, the whole body both melting and soft, the limbs utterly at ease. This is the true midnight hour; for me, it is the true noon hour when I perceive it.

*“The medicine arises, the spirit knows—this is the moment to gather the clear source.”* At this time, the water source is most pure, and gathering may begin. The medicine arises, the spirit knows—firmness is already felt. Only in this state is the water source clear enough for gathering.

*“Fire compels metal to move, the bellows turns by the power of wind; the river chariot revolves, advancing fire to refine true lead.”* Once the water source is clear, it must be preserved, never again lost to turbidity. Continue the work of fire compelling metal to move, stirring the bellows, relying on the wind of Xun to revolve. Use natural breathing to compel it, practicing natural gathering—gathering without gathering, taking without taking. The breath follows its own nature, without martial fire. Letting it be natural, the river chariot turns of itself, advancing yang fire and retreating yin tally. Advancing fire to refine true lead is the act of gathering. This river chariot’s ebb and flow is entirely spontaneous, requiring no intentional effort.

*“The celestial cycle of breaths—four divisions mark the timely shift.”* The celestial cycle of 360 degrees, divided by four, yields ninety. Here, there are truly only ninety breaths, all natural, flowing with the passage of time—no need to count them.

*“Bathing at Mao and You, concealed within Zi and Wu.”* The celestial cycle of 360 degrees, divided into four parts of ninety breaths, includes bathing at Mao and You, and the withdrawal and addition at Zi and Wu. Mao and You are concealed within Zi and Wu; Zi and Wu are Mao and You. The four phases of ninety breaths are Zi, Wu, Mao, and You, yet Mao and You are hidden within Zi and Wu—thus even ninety breaths are absent, for Zi, Wu, Mao, and You are but relative terms.

*“Returning to the root to restore life—intercalary days complete the celestial cycle; the count reaches three hundred—signs appear before the brows.”* At the time of returning to the root to restore life, a full celestial cycle is complete. What is returning to the root to restore life? When the work of gathering is done, the yang substance retracts—this is returning to the root to restore life. When yang rises, spirit and qi rush outward; when it retracts, they return. Three hundred sixty degrees make a celestial cycle; when the count is complete, cease the fire immediately, for the sign to stop appears before the eyes. Between the brows, in the empty chamber, a flash like lightning—this is it. At this moment, proceed to seal and secure it.

*“The mechanism to cease fire is perfected—the light awaits three pulls.”* At this time, cease the fire and rest, hence it is said, *“The mechanism to cease fire is perfected, the light awaits three pulls,”* which is what Master Wu meant by *“When the yang light appears three times, it is the sign to cease fire.”* The above describes the work of gathering in the minor celestial cycle, which first requires yang to be full and water clear before gathering can begin. Once gathered and sealed, when the yang light appears three times, descend and conclude the practice.

The following describes the work of sealing and nurturing within the process of refinement. After three hundred celestial cycles, the inner elixir forms, and the elixir’s origin appears—a substance the size of a soybean, leaping up and down. At this time, employ the work of gathering the medicine and returning it to the furnace. When the medicine reaches the abdomen, it must be returned to the furnace, which other texts call *“moving the furnace and changing the cauldron,”* as in the *Yin Fu Jing*: *“The mechanism lies in the eyes.”*

*“The secret of the twin eyes—focus on the central field.”* When the inner elixir has formed and leaps up and down, use both eyes to gaze at the navel. This is a secret practice, not to be observed by others. After focusing for several days, the leaping changes. Previously, it leapt up to the heart and down to the Gate of Life; now it circles the navel, forming a single mass—this is the attainment of the inner elixir. Thereafter, employ the nurturing work described above. At this time, the elixir’s origin revolves around the navel, and one is no longer aware of it in daily life. Nurture it for a year to produce the great medicine.

*“The great medicine is hard to gather—seven days of unbroken continuity.”* One must enter profound stillness for seven consecutive days, applying seven days’ effort. Each day requires stillness for six double-hours—this stillness is of great duration. The following describes the methods of descending work in the major celestial cycle.

*“Beware the perilous path—the mechanism is most profound.”* The path refers to the upper and lower magpie bridges; one must guard against danger and peril. The mechanism also refers to the upper and lower magpie bridges, most subtle and mysterious, for there is the risk of the elixir escaping—one must be vigilant.

*“Seek earnestly, with sorrow—find the true transmission early; choose the right person to teach—vows sworn like the sea; when the moment comes to ingest, virtue must come first.”*

The great elixir is difficult to gather, the magpie bridges perilous—one must receive the true transmission before attempting the work. And the master, in teaching disciples, must also exercise utmost care, requiring solemn vows like mountains and seas before imparting the teachings. Moreover, the moment for ingesting the great elixir depends entirely on virtue; if one’s virtue is shallow and blessings meager, demonic obstructions will surely arise during practice. As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *“The great Dao is easy or difficult to cultivate—know that it depends on both self and Heaven. Without accumulating merit and refining virtue, at every turn hordes of demons will obstruct the path.”* This is precisely the case.

*“Ten months of silent illumination—unobscured awakened meditation.”* For ten months, one maintains single-minded stillness, forgetting all else—this is the work of “increasing forgetfulness and diminishing fixation,” practiced after the major celestial cycle.

*“The two qi at rest—nature stabilized, the embryo perfected; yin exhausted, yang pure—snowflakes drift and scatter.”* At this stage, the major celestial cycle has passed, and one may attain the six penetrations, transcending form to enter transformation. With yin fully spent and yang pure, snowflakes appear to drift before the eyes.

*“Transcending the three realms—nourishment in the upper field.”* Having transcended the three realms, one may project spirit outward, thus the elixir is moved to the upper field. Initially, the elixir resided in the lower field; during the major celestial cycle, it ascended to the middle field. Now, the elixir has entered the upper field—the middle field being above the navel.

*“No coming, no going—unfettered, a carefree immortal; karmic conditions fortuitously met—cultivate early, delay not the years. Do not wait until old age arrives—withered bones hold no resources, only vain suffering.”* At this stage, one is unbound, free and at ease. If fortunate karmic conditions arise, practice early—do not procrastinate. For to wait until old age is to face withered bones and empty torment.

These closing lines convey the essential truth that one must cultivate the immortal’s method early—never waiting until old age. Here we see the true adept’s earnest compassion in guiding others toward liberation. This song encompasses the entirety of elixir arts, with particular detail on the minor celestial cycle; as for the major celestial cycle, it merely outlines its broad contours.

Among the chapters of *The Secret Teachings of the Dragon Gate*, only *The Song of the Minor Celestial Cycle* and this *Song of the Great Way* are confirmed as works of Patriarch Qiu. Though the principles in the remaining chapters are sound, they likely do not stem from his direct hand—this is evident in their differing diction and phrasing.

The year-long *wēnyǎng* (warm-nurturing) practice described above demands balanced *dìng* (stabilization) and *wàng* (forgetting). If one stabilizes for ten minutes, one must forget for ten minutes; if one stabilizes for an hour, one must forget for an hour; if two hours, then two hours of forgetting. For excessive forgetting chills the elixir, leaving it tender, while excessive stabilization dries it, rendering it overripe—only a state neither cold nor dry will suffice. At the outset, one must carefully maintain this balance; with prolonged practice, it becomes effortless, and spirit and qi will naturally sustain equilibrium throughout the day.

This year of warm-nurturing is specifically designed for the major celestial cycle, allowing the inner elixir’s generative medicine to circulate through the celestial orbit. Thus, upon completing foundational work, one must immediately undertake a year of warm-nurturing. Through unwavering devotion, the medicine accumulates bit by bit, gradually filling the body until it generates the *xiāntiān zhī xiāntiān* (prior Heaven of prior Heaven)—only then is one ready for the major celestial cycle.

When warm-nurturing is complete and the medicine fully matured, a vision appears before the eyes: a black sphere with a white center, initially level with the navel, then gradually ascending to the space between the brows. With further nurturing, it transforms into a red sphere—this is the medicine employed in the major celestial cycle.

As the *Yellow Court Classic* states: *“Accumulate essence, amass qi to become true.”* Daily accumulation of generative medicine is precisely this “accumulation of essence and amassing of qi to become true.” Yet only with balanced stabilization and forgetting will there be tangible results. If this year of warm-nurturing is executed well, the major celestial cycle will proceed without peril. When natural spiritual awareness arises, stabilization and forgetting occur spontaneously and flawlessly. The success of the major celestial cycle hinges entirely on the quality of this year’s warm-nurturing—practitioners must take heed.

**Fourth Lecture on the Oral Transmission of the Great Way**
The previous two sessions addressed warm-nurturing.

Warm-nurturing the inner elixir aims to fill the entire body with it, transmuting it into golden liquid—this is called the *jīnyè huándān* (golden liquid returned elixir). Only when the golden liquid saturates the body can it generate the *wàiyào* (external medicine), known as the *dàyào* (great medicine). Most texts gloss over the details of this warm-nurturing and fire-regulation process, proceeding directly to the major celestial cycle after a hundred days of practice. In truth, though the inner elixir may form, it remains merely a *dānyuán* (elixir origin) and is not yet full—only after warm-nurturing and transformation can the major celestial cycle begin.

After a hundred days, the elixir origin takes root in the lower field, called the *jīnggēn* (essence root). Only after warm-nurturing can it fill the entire body and transmute into golden liquid, becoming the *hùnyuán zhìjīng* (primordial perfect essence). All processes—gathering, sealing, refining—pertain to this primordial perfect essence. Once transmuted into golden liquid, the great elixir is born. The great elixir is the medicine of the major celestial cycle, possessing form and appearance—hence it is termed the external medicine or great elixir.

But to what degree must warm-nurturing progress before the major celestial cycle can commence? This must be understood. Through daily stabilization and forgetting, natural spiritual awareness arises, and the fire-regimen is thereby governed. Without relying on the *shíshén* (discriminating mind) for nurturing, water and fire naturally balance. Secure in this, one contemplates; through contemplation, one attains—once attained, it is eternally held.

With balanced stabilization and forgetting throughout the day, true breathing opens and closes imperceptibly. The inner elixir gradually transmutes into golden liquid, unbeknownst to the practitioner, who only senses the cessation of the six pulses, the return of qi to its root, the thinning of the pulse until it nearly vanishes, the halting of respiration, and the transmutation of red blood into white. Once the golden liquid is full, breathing shifts to the pores, and gradually, being arises from non-being.

When the inner elixir is formed, the abdomen holds a treasure—like the *niúhuáng* (ox bezoar) in cattle. A person with inner treasure will manifest external signs: during warm-nurturing, a black circle (〇) appears in the space before the eyes, initially level with the navel, then gradually ascending and expanding. At first, it is visible only by lamplight, not in daylight, but later, it becomes visible even in sunlight. The object is white within and black without.

As the *Awakening to Reality* states: *“Within blackness lies white—the elixir’s mother; within the male, the female harbors the precious treasure.”* This “elixir mother” is the progenitor of the great elixir. Its form is spherical and hollow—hence it is called “female,” for it is empty within. This is the body’s treasure, both elixir and golden elixir, circulating along the path of the Yellow Court.

At this stage, one continues balanced stabilization and forgetting, neither clinging to nor rejecting the vision. When stabilization is due, stabilize; when forgetting is due, forget. After some time, the black sphere transforms into a red one. Initially, it is but a speck; with prolonged accumulation, it grows to the size of a tangerine—this is called the *zhūjú* (vermilion tangerine).

Once the transformation into the *zhūjú* (vermilion tangerine) is complete, this is the external elixir, the Great Medicine. The work of the Great Celestial Cycle should now commence. The elixir is originally the foundation of the internal elixir, nurtured and expanded through gentle cultivation until it gradually coalesces into a pearl, then into the vermilion tangerine. If one proceeds to gather and refine it at this stage, this is the practice of the Great Celestial Cycle.

The Great Celestial Cycle differs from the Small Celestial Cycle. For seven days, one remains in primordial chaos—this is what is meant by *“seven days of chaos, death and rebirth.”* Without this, the external elixir cannot form. After the seven-day death of the Great Celestial Cycle, one is reborn. During these seven days, one is no different from the dead, immersed in the state of chaos. Only through this seven-day death can one attain immortality for ten thousand years.

Those who attain the internal elixir have merely returned the lost true yang to their bodies. From this point onward, gold is generated daily, and over time, one reaches the primordial before the primordial. Only with this substance can one dispel the yin qi of kalpas past, transform the hun and po of the entire body, and arrive at the realm of non-arising. The Dharma-body is established, and from it, the spirit emerges—thus, this practice is of utmost importance and must not be neglected.

This work is exceedingly difficult. In merely seven days, one must expel the discriminating mind, sever the hun and po of the intermediate state, and dissolve the karmic roots of past lives inherited from parents and accumulated through one’s own temperament, diet, and desires. It is only natural that various demonic obstructions arise. These demons are none other than the discriminating mind itself; the hun and po are the karmic roots left from kalpas past, ever-present obstacles to one’s entry onto the Dao.

Only after seven days of refinement are they transmuted. Thus, all events from one’s life surge into the mind, and all persons connected to oneself appear before the eyes—not only from this life but also from the beginningless kalpas of the past. Passing the Great Celestial Cycle is like crossing the Flaming Mountains in *Journey to the West*; one must use the Plantain Fan to quell the flames before the passage is possible. The fan, made of wood, belongs to Princess Iron Fan. She is the wife of the Bull Demon King, who represents *kūn* earth, while she embodies *duì* metal. One must employ the pure yin practice of returning to emptiness. The six lines of the *kūn* hexagram all represent empty states; everything must be voided—all dharmas and non-dharmas—equated with the Great Void before this perilous threshold can be crossed. If one cannot empty oneself, it is like adding fire to fire, and danger arises. Thus, one must proceed with the utmost caution.

Yet by this time, one has already undergone a year of gentle cultivation, and the practice of emptying has been long established. If one remains steadfast, naturally empty and hollow, perceiving forms without attachment, the passage will be secure. If not, and thoughts or attachments arise at this critical moment, danger lurks at every turn. Therefore, the year of gentle cultivation is of paramount importance.

The method lies in balancing stabilization and forgetting during gentle cultivation to harmonize water and fire. Once equilibrium is achieved, a black circle gradually forms. One continues the practice of balanced stabilization and forgetting. As it grows larger and black gives way to white within, the preparatory work for the Great Celestial Cycle begins.

During the practice of stabilization and forgetting, if a white sphere suddenly appears within the black, visible even in broad daylight, one must increase forgetting and decrease stabilization—more time in forgetting, less in stabilization. For example, if one previously balanced two hours of stabilization with two of forgetting, now one should stabilize for an hour and a half and forget for two and a half, gradually increasing and decreasing accordingly.

Forgetting means emptying all thoughts. Stabilization still involves intention, retaining a trace of true intent, whereas forgetting eradicates everything, leaving nothing behind. Increasing forgetting and decreasing stabilization is the practice of *“reducing again and again, first reducing to benefit later.”* At this stage, forgetting must predominate while stabilization diminishes. For instance, if stabilization and forgetting were previously equal at two hours each, now one should stabilize for an hour and a half and forget for two and a half, progressively adjusting the ratio.

As the vermilion tangerine forms, the external elixir becomes ever more abundant, and the external circle grows larger. Stabilization still retains a dharma-form, though it arises from natural spirit-awareness; the primordial spirit must still exert effort. Forgetting leaves nothing behind, even the dharma-form is emptied. Stabilization involves subtle intent, the body of the Supreme Ultimate; forgetting is pure emptiness, the body of the Ultimateless. Stabilization employs natural spirit-awareness, while forgetting even this awareness is forgotten. Stabilization requires greater mental effort; forgetting arrives at the state of no-mind.

The more one practices forgetting, the more the external elixir flourishes. When forgetting reaches its peak and stabilization nearly vanishes, the vermilion tangerine radiates brilliant light, moving up and down before the eyes. At the time of the Great Celestial Cycle, one abandons stabilization and employs forgetting entirely, eradicating all things, knowing nothing, all phenomena stilled, utterly empty—merged with the Great Void. This is *“reducing again and again, until non-doing is attained.”* Reducing again and again means increasing forgetting and decreasing stabilization; non-doing is the time of great forgetting.

The *zhūjú* is also called the Fire Pearl, the Mysterious Pearl, the Mysterious Pearl at the Water’s Bottom, or the Fire Sphere in the alchemical classics. Now, the phenomena of the Great Celestial Cycle manifest. The signs are manifold, beginning with the Six Shocks: the six senses (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind) tremble—this is the first.

A breeze arises behind the brain—this is the second. Golden light appears in the eyes—this is the third. The nose twitches with qi, blocked and impassable—this is the fourth. The two kidneys boil like soup, the bladder burns with fire, and the inner kidneys feel scorched as if simmered in broth—this is the fifth. Externally, the Fire Sphere darts up and down—this is the sixth. These six phenomena all pertain to the body. The greatest danger lies in failing to forget the body and instead stirring thoughts; thus, forgetting is of utmost importance. One must remain utterly unaware, entirely forgotten, to proceed. If one cannot achieve great forgetting, the medicine will not ascend, and the elixir will not form. Only when completely forgotten, when the heart merges with the Great Void, does one refine the elixir within fire—hence the saying, *"crossing the Fiery Mountain."* Yet even then, not a single form is grasped, not a single thought scattered; the body abides within the Great Void.

Though this practice may seem difficult, it is not truly so. If one first masters the work of *wēnyǎng* (nurturing), forgetting will come naturally, and there need be no cause for concern. With *wēnyǎng* cultivated over time, one enters forgetting spontaneously, where the spirit remains aware yet still forgets and acts without doing. Once the Mysterious Pearl takes form, one forgets day by day, returning to the Great Void. At this stage, the practice becomes effortless—one forgets profoundly, merging with the Great Emptiness.

These six phenomena are called the Six Shocks in Buddhism. At this time, true yang is full within and without, expelling the yin qi accumulated over countless kalpas, giving rise to these various signs, like the body ablaze with *samādhi* fire. Beyond these six, there is another phenomenon: itching in the pores. The eighty-four thousand pores across the body itch like roasting beans, as the Golden Fluid flows outward throughout. This occurs during the moment of *cǎiqǔ* (gathering the medicine), when the generative essence arises.

Here follows the *"Rhapsody on Gathering the Great Medicine"* from the *Secret Teachings of the Dragon Gate*, with detailed explanations below:

“When the qi is full after a hundred days, the cessation of fire arrives; await the Three Arrivals to gather the primordial essence.” The Three Arrivals refer to the three manifestations of yang light. At this moment, one must cease the fire and gather the medicine, for the Great Medicine arises only when the qi is full after a hundred days.

“When true earth seizes lead, it returns to the original cavity.” This is the qi returning to its root, and the hundred spirits likewise returning to their root.

“When the dragon arrives from the east, the qi is full and spirit congeals.” This marks the appointed time. The preceding line speaks of lead; here, the Elixir is formed in the minor celestial cycle.

“When Qian resides in Kun’s palace, form and spirit unite.” This is the work of regulating the firing times, the practice of settling into equanimity and forgetting. Qian is being; Kun is non-being. To return being to non-being is to abide in stillness and forgetfulness—this is the work of gentle nurturing. The alchemical texts all address this, and no further explanation is needed; this chapter contains only this one line.

“After seven days, the celestial mechanism operates without intention.” The major celestial cycle is a fire without intention, unlike the minor cycle. In the minor cycle, there are sensations of yang stirring and rising—all these are intentional. Here, there is no intention.

“Forgetting form and image, the true intention does not scatter.” This true intention arises naturally of itself, within the emptiness. Only by forgetting both form and image can the single point of true intention remain undispersed.

“The Dao abides in non-action; to ask of it is to find no words.” This Dao resides entirely in non-action; it cannot be spoken, nor can any method be described. There is not a single thing, not the slightest effort.

“In stillness, after one watch, the seven-day return comes.” Proceeding with utmost emptiness and profound stillness, the Great Medicine of the major celestial cycle is born, and the phenomenon of the seven-day cycle appears.

“When the moon is full and its essence complete, the Great Medicine’s Dao is efficacious.” The full moon and complete essence are the Great Medicine—hence, “the Great Medicine’s Dao is efficacious.” At this time, before one’s eyes appears a bright moon shining at the window, and a red sun rises to meet it—this is the union of sun and moon. All these are external, illusory visions.

“When gui arises within yang, the image of the fire pearl appears.” The fire pearl is a fireball. When the Elixir forms externally, the image of a fireball appears before the eyes, now rising, now falling, much like the fox’s alchemical refinement. The fireball’s ascent and descent are the rising and falling, the celestial cycle.

“It ascends to Li’s position and returns to Kun’s origin.” The fireball ascends to the top of Li’s position and returns to Kun’s origin below the abdomen. Its rising and falling are visible to all, yet I am utterly forgetful, knowing nothing of any thing. At this time, externally, it ascends and descends, while internally, the true breath opens and closes.

“Driven by the lower abdomen, it surges through the tailbone.” This ball also rises from the back and descends in front, rising and falling. When the qi is full, it ascends from behind and descends in front. At this time, the yang qi in the lower abdomen also surges upward from the tailbone toward the heart. When it reaches the tailbone, one may fear the Elixir will escape—this escape is like passing gas—so one must tightly contract the anus. Yet, having utterly forgotten both form and things, knowing nothing, one cannot perform this contraction. Thus, a method is needed to prevent this: use a wooden plug wrapped in cotton to seal the perineum. Since the qi surges downward, if the perineum is not closed, the Elixir may escape. This is the danger of the lower Magpie Bridge, requiring the sealing of the perineum. The danger of the upper Magpie Bridge likewise requires tightly sealing the nostrils.

“All these are the power of the medicine, the natural celestial mechanism.” All the aforementioned surging through the tailbone arises from the medicine’s power and is the natural celestial mechanism. At this time, the true intention is one with emptiness, unaware and unknowing—it cannot be guided by intention. Those who claim it can be guided by intention merely understand the circumstances of this moment; all is the natural celestial mechanism.

“The three cavities of the tailbone are filled with essence and marrow; to cross the Magpie Bridge, one must consult a true immortal.” The tailbone has three apertures, all filled with essence and marrow. An illustration clarifies this: (see Figure 2). When the three cavities of the tailbone are full, crossing this aperture requires consulting a true immortal. If one can surge through this cavity and ascend, the Great Medicine is obtained. Yet, even if the lower Magpie Bridge is crossed, failing to pass the upper Magpie Bridge’s danger results in gaining and then losing it. This qi crosses the lower Magpie Bridge and ascends, then passes the Gate of Life and the Jiaji Pass—together, these are the Three Passes, comprising nine apertures, known as “one arrow piercing nine layers of iron drums.” These nine apertures are all filled with essence and marrow; without the primordial true qi, they cannot be opened. Thus, the Three Passes and nine apertures can only be opened by the primordial true qi—nothing else can open them.

To traverse the major celestial cycle, there are four secrets: *absorb*, *close*, *contract*, and *lick*. *Absorb*: when the qi ascends and threatens to escape, if it does not proceed, use this method. When the force is weak and the qi pauses at the Gate of Life or other points, use gentle breathing to facilitate passage. When the pass cannot be crossed, one must gently apply stillness. This arises from insufficient yang; once the nurturing is complete and yang is full, this flaw disappears, and the method is no longer needed. Among the three hundred celestial cycles, only the first two require this; the rest do not.

*Close*: this refers to closing the lower gate (anus). *Contract*: when ascending the Magpie Bridge, one must block the nostrils. *Lick*: this means licking the upper palate. Some interpret *absorb* as internal breathing, *close* as sealing the six gates, and *contract* as contracting the lower gate. If examined literally, however, *absorb* and *close* are merely illusory appearances, and these techniques need not be physically performed. Others take *close* to mean tightly sealing the gates—where the six sense gates may all be called "mouths," aligning with the aforementioned sealing of the six gates.

The major celestial cycle must be completed three hundred times, finished within seven days. The great stabilization is achieved in seven days, culminating in the work. At this stage, one undergoes a great death, seeking life within death, reviving after death—all pertains to the major celestial cycle. When the cinnabar orange arrives, it may be gathered; this is self-generation and self-gathering, distinct from the minor celestial cycle’s gathering.

**Fifth Lecture on the True Oral Transmission of the Great Dao**
The chapters following *Ode on Gathering the Great Elixir* in *Secret Essentials of the Dragon Gate*, which intermingle the practices of the major and minor celestial cycles and present them in unclear sequence, must be carefully distinguished. Here, *Ode on Obtaining the Great Elixir* is explained as follows:

*"The coccyx lies below, where the zi and chen hours wax."* The coccyx is at the end of the zi hour. Zi is the time when the elixir is born. "The coccyx lies below, where the zi and chen hours end" means the coccyx is behind the yinqiao aperture. From zi to si are six hours; from *Fu* to *Qian* are six hexagrams. The coccyx lies between chou and lin, the Gate of Life between yin and tai, and the crown of the head at si and *Qian*. This is clarified by the accompanying diagram.

*"The twenty-four vertebrae mark the beginning of the bone joints."* From the coccyx to the base of the skull are twenty-four vertebrae. The first joint, the coccyx, corresponds to the end of the zi hour—also the first of the bone joints. (See Diagram Three)

*"The scorched land of the nine apertures, the crossroads of the three forks."*

The three-forked crossroads are the single aperture of the yinqiao vessel. The nine apertures arise because each of the three barriers has three openings, thus three times three makes nine. The Buddha said, “An arrow pierces nine layers of iron drums”—this is the meaning. These nine apertures are all filled with marrow, and only the primordial qi can pass through them.

Why does each barrier have three openings? In the transmission of the middle and lower-grade elixir methods, there are three rivers named: the River of Spirit, the River of Essence, and the River of Qi. The elixir is the great medicine formed by the coalescence of essence, qi, and spirit—these three. When the great medicine ascends, the River of Spirit flows in the center, while the River of Essence and the River of Qi flank it on either side. The three proceed separately, each through its own aperture, hence the names. Yet when they move, they move as one; when they rest, they rest as one.

*“The central three apertures, where spirit, essence, and qi flow”*—this refers to the three central apertures, where spirit, essence, and qi are distinguished. These are metaphorical expressions; in reality, one cannot perceive three separate openings nor discern how they traverse, only that a warm current ascends.

*“The postnatal blood vessels course below”*—the primordial qi, which opens the barriers, is formless; one can only sense the warmth ascending, without shape or appearance. Once the primordial qi has opened the barriers, the postnatal blood vessels also traverse them. In those of postnatal constitution whose barriers remain closed, after the great celestial circuit opens the barriers, the blood vessels course through them. Through this refinement, red blood is transformed into white.

*“This realm is most solid, impervious to true essence”*—it is sealed and impenetrable, and only the primordial qi can pass through. The three barriers and nine apertures are inherently blocked.

*“To cross the yin barrier, one must know the Mysterious Emperor”*—to open this barrier, one must know the Mysterious Emperor, the True Martial Sovereign of the Dark Heavens of the North—this is the yang within Kan, the true yang within the Gate of Life. “Must know” means uniting the external medicine with the true yang in the Gate of Life; only when the two, being of the same kind, resonate can the barrier be opened. This is also called the Five Dragons.

*“Cast the body into the ravine, where the Five Dragons manifest their efficacy”*—the body here is the dharmakāya. When qi penetrates the lower abdomen, a natural spiritual awareness arises, and the image of “the Five Dragons bearing the Sage” appears—this is the efficacy of the Five Dragons. That is, the great medicine of the primordial five-phase true qi has reached the coccyx, where the five are refined into three, and the three into one, gathering into a single qi. Only then can it ascend and open each barrier, hence “the Five Dragons manifest their efficacy.”

But where precisely is this practice applied? The five belong to earth, the center; the center is emptiness. It is complete emptiness—true emptiness. This corresponds to the stillness of both body and mind, where natural spiritual awareness merges with the great void, enabling ascent. If not utterly empty—if there is intention or attachment—it cannot ascend. One must forget all and empty the self to be in accord with the method. The dragon is a creature of unfathomable transformation; if true intent reaches the state of true emptiness, qi will naturally ascend, and the Five Dragons will emerge.

*“Bearing the supreme body, it rises gently”*—the supreme body is the great elixir, the great medicine. Rising gently, it ascends from the coccyx.

*“With harmonious breath and empty intent, it naturally ascends”*—only here is it explained how ascent is achieved: through the union of true breath and the primordial intent of true emptiness, it naturally rises. One must utterly forget, merging with the great void, to ascend spontaneously—this is “the Five Dragons manifest their efficacy,” also “the Five Dragons bear the Sage.”

Breath here is empty breath, true breath.

*“The six gates are sealed externally, while a single qi revolves within”*—at this stage, the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, the mind is devoid of objects, and only in complete return to emptiness can the true yang qi ascend. If the six senses attach to phenomena, the celestial circuit cannot revolve. Hence it is said: seven days like death, in a state of undifferentiated chaos, the six gates sealed. “Revolves within” means ascending.

*“The three barriers and nine apertures are distinctly clear”*—in the minor celestial circuit, qi ascends and descends, yet one remains unaware, and the three barriers and nine apertures are indistinct. Here, they become distinctly clear. The fire pearl, obtained from the Mysterious Emperor of the North, is called the Mysterious Pearl or Fire Pearl. Externally, it appears as a spherical form; internally, it radiates warmth. As the fire pearl ascends, it is distinctly perceived—this is natural spiritual awareness. One knows where the medicine has reached, yet remains unaware of all else.

*“Yang essence returns upward to the pulse barrier”*—having passed the three barriers and nine apertures, the yang qi reaches the crown of the head—this is arriving above the pulse barrier. As the *Awakening to Reality* says: “Planted in Qian’s palace of mutual resonance.”

Upon reaching Qian’s palace, the medicine is obtained. From Qian’s palace, it descends—this is the action of reducing the fire, passing through the Flame Mountain where the fire is extinguished.

*“The silent Mysterious Pearl rolls past Kunlun”*—the crown is Kunlun Mountain. Ascending along the spine to the crown and then descending is rolling past Kunlun.

*“Bearing the azure sky on its back, it then turns southward”*—this alludes to the first chapter of *Zhuangzi*, “Free and Easy Wandering,” whose essence lies in “taking from Kan to fill Li.” It says: “In the northern darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun.”

The Kun is so vast that none knows its measure in thousands of *li*. It transforms into a bird, whose name is Peng. The Peng’s back is so broad that none knows its measure in thousands of *li*. When it rouses itself to flight, its wings resemble clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will migrate to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.

*The Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. It says: When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind to ninety thousand *li*, departing with the winds of the sixth month. It also says: If the accumulation of wind is not thick, then it has no strength to bear great wings. Thus, only at ninety thousand *li* does the wind lie beneath it, and only then can it ride the wind. Bearing the azure sky on its back, with nothing to obstruct or hinder it, only then does it turn southward.

The dark and vast Kun is none other than the Mysterious Pearl. Ascending is reaching the crown and then turning south—this is the "turning southward." The "winds of the sixth month" signify passing through the six trigrams and the six periods. Those who understand the Dao recognize this chapter of *Zhuangzi* as describing the workings of fire-phase cultivation; those who do not remain ignorant of its meaning.

"Turning southward" means descending after reaching the south—this is one ascent and one descent, rising from the back and descending from the front, which is also yang ascending and yin descending.

*“Stretching and bending, it models the cyclic rounds of Heaven”*—stretching and bending are yin and yang. Modeling Heaven is the celestial orbit.

When the Mysterious Pearl rolls past Kunlun, it encounters the peril of the upper Magpie Bridge, located between the Hall of Light and the root of the nose. Thus, upon reaching the Hall of Light, one must guard against danger. The perils of the upper and lower Magpie Bridges are the same, both consisting of one solid aperture and one hollow aperture alternating. The upper root of the nose is the solid aperture; the nostrils are the hollow apertures. The lower coccyx is the solid aperture; the anus is the hollow aperture. The hollow has a gate, while the solid contains marrow. The solid cannot be traversed, and if one fears leakage through the hollow, then below it is the loss of the elixir, and above it is the leakage of the elixir—both are unacceptable.

At this stage, there is no cessation of breath, and with no external respiration through mouth or nose, it may seem harmless. Yet this is a well-trodden path, and the slightest inattention may still lead to leakage. To prevent this danger, there is a method: one may use cotton to block it. In truth, whether blocked or not matters little; what is essential is that the mind merge with the Great Void and follow nature, allowing the descent to proceed without peril.

*“Upon reaching the Hall of Light, one must guard against danger”*—at this moment, one must not initiate any physical breathing, for with breath comes leakage. Hence, it is said one must guard against danger.

*“Swiftly gather the golden elixir and ascend to secure the Cinnabar Field”*—having reached the upper Cinnabar Field, the elixir is obtained, and one must ingest and consume it within the abdomen. In truth, it is not eaten but flows downward naturally from the upper Cinnabar Field—this is the “sweet dew sprinkling Mount Sumeru.” This sweet dew is a watery fluid. As in *Journey to the West*, when passing Flame Mountain, forty-nine sweeps of the plantain fan first bring a fine rain, followed by a great downpour.

*“From here it descends, flowing naturally into the mysterious viscera”*—following the current downward, it naturally reaches the organs.

*“Gently tilting the face upward, the tongue licks to welcome it”*—to guard against the peril of the upper Magpie Bridge, the tongue must press against the upper palate, the face slightly raised, allowing the sweet dew to descend. Some say this dew is born from the mysterious larynx.

*“The medicine pierces the tip of the tongue and descends through the Tower of Nine Stories”*—this medicine follows the tip of the tongue, passing through the Tower of Nine Stories and entering the abdomen. The Tower of Nine Stories is the throat. In truth, the elixir descends on its own, but as it passes through the throat, it is also called “ingestion.”

*“Called ingestion, it ascends the steps gradually”*—this practice must proceed step by step, stage by stage.

*“Meeting in the Crimson Palace, water and fire achieve harmony”*—the Crimson Palace is the small void within the Mud Pill Palace. Reaching the Crimson Palace is the harmony of water and fire, at which point true yin merges and ascends, transforming into sweet dew. Only upon reaching the Crimson Palace does one obtain primordial true yin; hence, it is called “meeting.” True yang and true yin meeting is the harmony of water and fire.

*“Returning to the Imperial Homeland, one attains unity and returns to the root”*—after ingestion comes the returning elixir, which is attaining unity and returning to the root.

*“The spirit and essence contain movement, gold resides within; only then is the elixir obtained and the foundation of the spiritual embryo laid. The hundreds of channels and vessels return to their original positions; externally shielded, internally purified, the Supreme Ultimate is perfected and true.”*

The four lines above describe the effects after the first completion of the great celestial orbit and the attainment of the elixir. The great celestial orbit practice rises from the back and descends from the front, circling three hundred times over seven days, with no fixed count per day. What is discussed here pertains to the first cycle of practice; if the first cycle proceeds smoothly, then naturally and steadily, without difficulty, it culminates in great forgetfulness, the spiritual embryo forms, and one may achieve spirit departure.

After completing the great celestial orbit, the hundreds of channels and vessels return to their positions, the six senses are extinguished externally, and the seven emotions are eliminated internally. From this point, emotions and perceptions vanish, returning to the truth of the Supreme Ultimate. The practice is completed in seven days, though some achieve it in five. With refined cultivation, the process naturally accelerates.

The following passage states:

*“The six roots extinguish perception, the six kinds of shaking arise; the eyes emit golden light, the vulture cries behind the brain; the two kidneys seethe like boiling water, the Cinnabar Field blazes with fire; the body surges, the nose twitches, the ears generate wind; true qi becomes breath, all manifest signs; spirit and essence unite at the center, eternally attesting to longevity; transcending the realm of essence, one verifies true non-leakage; no longer transforming essence, the central qi is heaven-perfected; this forms the divine substance, the voice first emitted; the great celestial orbit begins, refining qi to transform spirit.”*

The above ten lines describe the visions preceding the Great Celestial Orbit. Once the foundation is firmly established and the nurturing phase is complete, one attains permanent "non-leakage." Thereafter, one must refine *qi* to transform spirit, experiencing the six kinds of shaking, thus entering the practice of the Great Celestial Orbit.

The perils of the Great Celestial Orbit lie in the surging of yin demons and the dangers of the upper and lower Magpie Bridges. The upper and lower Magpie Bridges need only be cautiously avoided during the first attempt, after which they pose no further threat. The Great Celestial Orbit also spans three hundred cycles; once the practice becomes proficient, demonic obstacles arise before the eyes. For this Great Celestial Orbit is the refinement of the body with the fire of samadhi, expelling all yin *qi* from the heart. Yin *qi* is the demon—all karmic roots from past lives, the inherited *qi* and temperament from parents, and the influences of food and desire—all are demons. When the practice is mastered, the greatest difficulties often arise on the second day of the seven-day cycle. At this time, the fireball surges up and down; when it rises, the heart’s blood stirs, and all past actions manifest before one’s eyes. Matters of sound and form, wealth and profit, greed, anger, delusion, and attachment—all that is sorrowful, joyful, lovable, or fearful—appear in myriad forms, without exception. Not only events of this life but also those from past kalpas arise vividly. Thus, in cultivating the great samadhi, one must remain unmoved by whatever arises.

Heavenly and earthly demons may also test one’s steadfastness: if the heart clings to feminine beauty, celestial maidens of divine loveliness may appear; if it covets silver and gold, mountains of treasure may be offered for the taking. All such external manifestations are called heavenly demons. Earthly demons, though externally induced, are also stirred by one’s own heart. Other apparitions may include lifelong friends or deceased relatives and companions. Yet these are not real people or ghosts—they are but demons of the heart. During the seven-day Great Celestial Orbit, the wailing of spirits and the howling of demons reach their peak by the fifth or sixth day; by the sixth day, they begin to subside, and by the seventh, all is calm.

The so-called three disasters and eight difficulties must be overcome by illuminating the mind and seeing one’s true nature—this requires the true intent to return to emptiness. If one can abide in emptiness, all obstacles vanish. First, through nurturing, one gradually forgets and diminishes attachment until complete emptiness is attained. If one can reach the state of undistracted focus and thought-free stillness—what the Confucians call "utmost sincerity"—only then is the heart sufficiently refined to undertake the Great Celestial Orbit.

The cultivation of the Dao depends entirely on virtue, which resides in not being stained by the six dusts or attached to the four appearances. Thus, the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* states: *"If one can refrain from abiding in appearances, their merit is immense."* To reach the state of emptiness beyond emptiness—without heart, without things, without self, without others, unattached to any appearance—is to attain the greatest merit. *Laozi* says: *"By forgetting the self, the self is perfected; by forgetting the form, the form endures."* Within the act of forgetting lies three thousand eight hundred virtues. To achieve great forgetting is to accomplish the Great Celestial Orbit, allowing the spirit to depart, and the task is complete.

The subsequent practice of returning to emptiness may or may not be undertaken. After seven days of the Great Celestial Orbit, the external red orb transforms into a purplish-golden light that envelops the entire body. There is also a secret formula for the departure of the spirit. The purpose of the Great Celestial Orbit is to refine and dissolve emotional consciousness, transmuting it into the yang spirit. Once this is achieved, no karmic roots of emotional consciousness remain, and thus no yin *qi* persists.

This practice should not be feared as excessively difficult; by following the method step by step, success is assured. At this stage, the four prerequisites—method, wealth, companions, and place—are indispensable. The place must be a secluded mountain forest, its feng shui examined to avoid inauspicious influences, ensuring a tranquil and serene environment. Companions must number at least three to take turns in attendance, as one alone is insufficient.

The method refers to the oral instructions for the Great Celestial Orbit. Wealth pertains to provisions for clothing and sustenance, which must be prepared in advance. If, after undertaking the Great Celestial Orbit, the great elixir does not manifest, or if the red orb appears but *qi* fails to arrive, Daoists attribute this to insufficient virtue and advocate charitable giving to accumulate merit. For the elixir is a heavenly treasure, while wealth is a worldly treasure—one must offer wealth to the heavens, vowing to resume practice. Confucians attribute it to inadequate self-cultivation, hence the lack of response. Buddhists attribute it to past karmic obstructions, which must be repented and expiated. The Buddhist explanation is somewhat vulgar; the Daoist explanation, though profound, is overly abstract.

Only the Confucian explanation is most apt. After receiving his master’s transmission, Bai Yuchan believed this Dao could surely be attained and immortality surely achieved. Yet when the moment came, he faced the peril of "midnight wind and thunder" and privately resolved to abandon his practice. The Perfected Zhang Ziyang, learning of this, sent from Tiantai a scroll of *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir*. Upon receiving and reading it, Bai grasped the subtleties of the firing process, resumed his practice, and succeeded. His initial slight negligence had led to this peril. Even Lü Dongbin, in performing the Great Celestial Orbit, failed three times before studying the *Mirror for Ingredient Entry*, resuming his practice, and succeeding. This was because the transmission from Ancestor Zhong had not been fully embodied by Ancestor Pure Yang. For the most minute details, if not attended to, will prevent success. The *Awakening to Reality* states: "A hair’s breadth of deviation, and the elixir will not form." Scholars must ponder this deeply!

Sixth Lecture on the Oral Instructions of the Authentic Transmission of the Great Dao

After the ascent and descent of the Great Celestial Orbit, one refines *qi* to transform spirit. In the Lesser Celestial Orbit, refining essence transforms it into *qi*—gathering the primordial supreme essence, accumulating and congealing it to transmute into the *qi* of Grand Unity containing true reality, whereby the generative essence is likewise transformed. Once generative essence is transformed, one remains unmoved by desire. Refining essence into *qi* forms the inner elixir, which, through the alchemy of golden fluid, attracts and coalesces into the true *qi* of yang. Combined with the yang essence already attained, it is forged by spirit into the Great Elixir. The Lesser Orbit yields the inner elixir; the Great Orbit yields the outer elixir. The inner is the yin elixir; the outer, the yang elixir. The yang elixir can forge the consciousness-spirit, returning it to the storehouse of consciousness, merging with the Great Void, and severing the roots of karmic action.

What the Lesser Celestial Orbit attains is the "prior-to-heaven within the posterior-to-heaven"—this is primordial *qi*, and primordial *qi* congeals into the inner elixir. Passing through the Great Celestial Orbit, it is transmuted into golden fluid, producing the Great Medicine. Before ingestion, it is medicine; after ingestion, it is elixir—this is the "prior-to-heaven within the prior-to-heaven," the transformation of spirit. The "prior-to-heaven within the posterior-to-heaven," when steamed and refined, generates a red orb—this red orb is the outer elixir. Tempered by the fire of samadhi into a crimson hue, it is the fire of *qi*. Thus it is said: refining *qi* transforms spirit, and through this *qi*, spirit is transformed. Expanding and filling it, one may exteriorize spirit; expanding further, one returns to emptiness.

Spirit is one; *qi* is two; essence is three. From three to two, from two to one—attaining the One, one attains spirit. This One is nature; empty nature is numinous emptiness. Those who cultivate the Dao thereby attain the six penetrations. Divided into three, it is not numinous; united as one, it is numinous. The true yang *qi* within the void of heaven and earth is the principle-*qi* of the Supreme Ultimate—most numinous indeed. Transformed into spirit, it transcends the Two Modes, Four Images, Five Phases, and so forth—hence, it is spirit. The *Doctrine of the Mean* states: "As a thing, it is without duality, and thus its generation of things is unfathomable." Standing alone without counterpart, it is therefore boundlessly transformative and numinous.

Spirit is that which transforms the myriad things. To be greatly transformed is to become a sage; to be a sage yet beyond knowing is to be spirit. The sage may still be spoken of, but spirit is difficult to know. Reaching vastness, exhausting subtlety, attaining utmost clarity, embracing profundity and enduring without limit—Daoists call this immortality, Buddhists name it bodhisattvahood, both connoting eternal omnipotence. After completing the Great Celestial Orbit, it is called the spirit elixir—this elixir is the yang spirit.

When the fire orb is external, yang remains outside; after seven days, yin is exhausted and yang is pure, uniting with spirit in virtue. The various demonic obstacles that arise externally are the roots of karmic actions accumulated through kalpas past. Now they all manifest, for the mind-spirit is most numinous, and the consciousness-spirit is likewise numinous. Due to experiences from kalpas past, impressions linger within consciousness; now, as they are to be transformed, they must appear once more. The ancients spoke of the seven days of the Great Orbit as refining yin demons. When the impressions of the consciousness-spirit are transformed, they unite with the external yang spirit to accomplish the Dao—this is what is meant by "both form and spirit are transformed."

Once the yin of the consciousness-spirit is fully dispelled and the roots of karma are severed, consciousness becomes utterly empty, merging with the empty substance of primordial spirit. Thus form and spirit are both transformed—gathered, they form a body; dispersed, they become *qi*. After the Great Celestial Orbit, the essence and blood within the body transmute into white paste, while the bones and flesh become exceedingly firm, enduring without decay. Yet ultimately, they remain heavy and turbid, unable to ascend. That which forms images in heaven is the exteriorization of primordial spirit; that which forms a body on earth is the relinquishment of the physical husk to the earth.

Only when the physical form is perfected does it become an indestructible vajra body, which perishes only when heaven and earth collapse—nothing else can destroy it. When spirit departs and the husk remains on earth, it endures without decay. The nails, hair, and eyebrows—appendages of the bones and flesh—are sustained by the numinous *qi* within the bones and flesh, allowing them to continue growing. To illustrate: at the Supreme Clarity Palace on Mount Lao in Qingdao, Shandong, there resides a Daoist cultivator, said to be from the Ming dynasty. To this day, he sits upright within, neither eating, sleeping, nor speaking.

Each time a local official was replaced, another seal was added to the door. Though the chamber had fallen into disrepair, the Daoist remained seated motionless within. All who saw him beheld his nails, grown so long they coiled three times around his waist. Such cases exist in every province. After hundreds of years, the fleshly body remains as if alive, and the nails and hair continue to grow.

During the late Qing dynasty, Jin Fu, the River Conservancy Director of Shandong Province, was overseeing dike construction along the Yellow River when an ancient coffin was unearthed. The coffin crumbled upon exposure to wind and sun, yet the body inside remained intact, its hair exceedingly long and its nails coiled several times around the corpse. As it was an unidentified ancient remains, some proposed cremation. Just as the fire was about to be lit, a great thunderstorm erupted, halting the proceedings. That night, as Jin Fu worked in his office, a man in ancient robes and cap appeared before him, saying: “I am one who attained the Dao. My body remains imperishable. Since you are building a dike, I ask that you rebury me elsewhere—any place will do—but do not burn me, for fire would bring misfortune upon you.”

In the Song dynasty, an official overseeing construction unearthed an ancient tomb. When the coffin was opened, the corpse appeared as if alive, resembling a person from the Han era. As the onlookers watched, the corpse suddenly sat up. Those who lingered nearby saw it open its eyes, gaze heavenward, and say: “Why has the sky grown so low, much lower than in my time?” Having spoken, it lay back down and did not rise again. Upon consulting historical records, they learned it was a certain Daoist cultivator from the Eastern Han dynasty and reburied him as before. All such cases occur because, through refinement, the yin within the body is exhausted, allowing the flesh to remain imperishable for eternity.

The ascent and descent follow this pattern: rising from behind and descending in front. When ascending, the heat resembles a ball of fire, rising along the Governing Vessel to the crown, where it lingers briefly before descending via Kunlun to the Hall of Brightness and entering the mouth—this is called “ingesting the returned elixir,” or “white clouds ascending to the summit.” The descent is “sweet dew sprinkling Mount Sumeru.” When the elixir reaches the mouth, it is but a few drops, and later only a single drop, descending past the Celestial Ladder. Though the substance is scant, its effect is profound, producing a sound like thunder.

When the great medicine enters the abdomen, it is called “obtaining the elixir.” Occurring several times a day, after accumulating three hundred such instances, the fireball before the eyes transforms into a red-purple light that envelops the body. Initially, it covers only half the body, gradually extending to the whole. The person becomes dazed and ethereal, as if amid clouds and mist, the light a deep red. This process involves methodical effort and sequential stages.

After seven days, the red light suffuses the entire body—this light is the yang spirit of the practitioner, marking the initial step. One must then apply the work of nurturing, which in elixir methods is called “bathing” and “nursing.” The great celestial cycle has no fixed pattern and is purely a matter of forgetting. At this stage, one must employ even greater forgetfulness.

Once the yang elixir is obtained, the spirit shifts to the upper field, merging one’s emptiness with the emptiness of heaven and earth. When released, it pervades the six directions. At this time, the body and mind still require profound forgetting, while one subtly employs spiritual awareness to sense one’s own small emptiness merging with the vast emptiness of heaven and earth. When the emptiness of heaven and earth becomes one’s own emptiness, and one’s own emptiness becomes that of heaven and earth, then one’s spirit dwells within heaven and earth, while one’s *qi* envelops them beyond. This is the work of nurturing practiced after refining *qi* into spirit and before returning to emptiness.

After completing the minor celestial cycle, essence becomes full and desire for sensuality ceases. After the great celestial cycle, *qi* becomes full and the desire for food vanishes; spirit becomes full and the desire for sleep disappears. One abides in great stillness throughout the day, neither eating nor breathing. Within one’s own emptiness, merged with the emptiness of heaven and earth, this state lasts at least a hundred days, at most three hundred. For those of keen spiritual roots, it may be instantly realized. The purple-red light suffusing the body gradually transforms into a purple-gold light, then into a golden light that envelops the body. As *The Understanding Reality* says: “Lately, a golden light manifests throughout the body; I do not speak of this method to others.”

When the red light envelops the body, immortals and buddhas become visible. Upon transforming into golden light, one may commune with divine beings. The oral instructions for refining spirit and returning to emptiness, for magnifying the yang spirit, lie entirely in the two phrases: “with one’s own emptiness, merge with the emptiness of heaven and earth.”

After the golden light envelops the body, several or even dozens of days later, the golden radiance suffuses the entire body and rises to cover the crown. Initially small, it gradually expands until it becomes as large as a cartwheel—this is the moment of spirit departure. When the yang spirit is fully capable of exiting, the guardian companion, seeing the golden light grow as large as a cartwheel, should announce: “Depart!” to rouse the practitioner to exit swiftly. If still unresponsive, the companion should announce it again. At the slightest stirring, the spirit will depart.

There is an ancient account of one who severed his arm to exit the spirit. Lan Yangsu, for instance, was in the midst of a spirit-departure vision yet remained unaware. As time passed and his spirit did not emerge, even after Master Zhong’s guidance, it still did not depart. He then forcefully severed his arm, and the shock caused his spirit to exit at once. Had a companion been present to startle and alert him earlier, the stirring would have allowed the spirit to depart with the golden light.

At this stage, one has already entered profound forgetting, and awareness does not respond without external stimulus—someone must announce it. Lan’s spirit did not depart because, though the vision had arrived, he remained unaware, causing the spirit to stagnate within. With true intent unmoved, severing his arm startled him into sudden awareness.

When the spirit first departs, the yang spirit is still immature, its courage feeble—it must not venture far, and upon exiting, must be drawn back at once. It emerges with awareness stirring and returns with awareness stirring. Initially, it may travel only five or ten paces, or thirty or forty, gradually extending farther, to five *li* or ten *li*. With constant practice, when mastery is achieved, the spirit may go wherever intent directs. Only when it can reach five hundred *li* or a thousand *li* may it be put to use. At first, upon arriving at a place, the spirit may linger for a time—whether a quarter-hour or half an hour—before being recalled. If it can travel a thousand *li* and remain for an hour, then traveling ten thousand *li* is no different. At this stage, the spirit’s efficacy in performing various acts grows with the distance it can travel and the duration it can remain—greater range and longer stay make the spirit more potent. When the spirit can be sent forth and recalled at will, the practice is complete, and the yang spirit may then penetrate earth and ascend to heaven. Gathered, it takes form; scattered, it becomes qi. When gathered, it appears as a person; when scattered, it dissolves into qi, able to transform at will. Yet at this stage, it remains a single spirit and cannot yet manifest multiple bodies. With further progress, it may divide into many.

The departure of the spirit is the refinement of spirit into emptiness; the manifestation of multiple bodies is the refinement of emptiness to merge with the Dao. The Dao is fundamentally empty, nameless, and formless—refining emptiness to unite with it is called by Daoists “shattering the void,” by Buddhists “a thousand hundred million transformed bodies,” and by Confucians “when released, it pervades the six directions; when withdrawn, it retreats into secrecy.” At this point, one may act as one wishes: if seeking liberation, one may shed the physical shell and depart; if choosing to remain in form to save the world, one may continue refining with the body intact.

Refining emptiness to merge with the Dao means returning one’s yang spirit to the void, dissolving within it. Practicing with the body retained is what Buddhists call the “nine years of wall-facing” discipline. The “nine years” is a figurative term—duration is not fixed by years. With long cultivation, the number of transformed bodies increases: from one to three, from three to nine, from nine to eighty-one. After nine years of practice, one may manifest countless bodies. The time required depends entirely on the sharpness of one’s faculties. Those with keen faculties may achieve this in a single day, or even attain instantaneous mastery—progress is swift. Those with dull faculties require more time. Yet this practice has no limit: the longer one applies effort, the greater the spiritual powers. Even celestial immortals cultivate this way.

Manifesting a thousand hundred million dharma bodies to fill the cosmos is the state of the Great Awakened Golden Immortal—this is the Buddha. In cultivation, one becomes utterly empty, merging completely with the void. Ultimately, one may fill the three-thousandfold great-thousandfold world with the countless transformed bodies of the Ganges’ sands—what spiritual powers would then be unattainable?

In Daoist practice, few retain the physical body after the spirit departs, for most regard the shell as a burdensome growth and prefer to discard it. Buddhists, however, often retain the body to advance toward complete mastery. In truth, whether one keeps the body or not matters little to oneself; the difference lies in the convenience it affords when performing deeds to benefit others. The methods of salvation differ between Buddhists and Daoists. Yet once the Dao is attained, both must use it to benefit the world.

Daoists typically shed the physical shell, entering the world with the yang spirit to save others while continuing to refine the yang spirit to merge with the Dao. When the Perfected Zhang Sanfeng appeared before the Ming Emperor Chengzu, he flew into the court as a yang spirit and declared, “I am not Zhang Sanfeng—I am Zhang Sanfeng’s yang spirit.” By the time the Perfected One was in Yangzhou, he had already transformed his body, entering Mount Wudang with his yang spirit to refine the practice of merging with the Dao while performing salvific deeds. Later, he traveled the world—all as a yang spirit. Buddhists, however, do not consider traveling the world a means of salvation; they remain where they are to save others, often retaining the body. If one wishes to travel the world to save others, it is more convenient to do so without the body.
