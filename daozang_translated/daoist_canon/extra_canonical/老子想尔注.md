The *Xiang’er* Commentary on the *Laozi*:

When the people do not contend, they also do not steal. “Do not display what may be desired, so that the heart is not disordered.” □□□ do not desire to look upon it; for example, if one does not see it, the heart will not be stirred. If stirred, one must admonish oneself, and the □ Dao will depart and then return. If the heart is disordered, it follows, and the Dao departs.

“In the governance of the sage, he empties their hearts and fills their bellies.” The heart is the compass, within which there is good and ill, fortune and misfortune. The belly is the sack of the Dao, where qi ever desires to be full. If the heart is filled with ill and evil, the Dao departs and the sack is empty. When empty, demons enter and kill the person. Expel the ill and evil from the heart, and the Dao will return to it; the belly will then be full.

“Weaken their wills and strengthen their bones.” The will follows the heart, possessing good and evil; the bones follow the belly, relying on qi. A strong will for evil causes qi to depart and bones to wither. Weaken the evil will, and qi will return, filling the marrow.

“Always cause the people to be without knowledge and without desire.” When the Dao is cut off and does not circulate, demonic teachings flourish, and people vie to covet and study them for livelihood. Their bodies follow peril and collapse—this must be forbidden. Do not know demonic teachings; do not covet treasures and goods, and the state will be easily governed. The transformation of the superior over the inferior is like the wind bending grass. To achieve this, the superior must know and trust the Dao.

“Cause the wise not to dare not to act.” If the superior trusts the Dao without weariness, even those of great knowledge, though they may harbor demonic thoughts, will still discern right and wrong. Seeing the superior’s diligence, they too will not dare not to act.

“Then there is nothing that will not be governed.” Thus, the state is well governed.

“The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.” The Dao values harmony and equilibrium; one should act in harmony and equilibrium. The will and intent must not overflow, violating the Dao’s admonitions.

“Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.” The Dao. If one practices the Dao without violating its admonitions, it is profound and deep like the Dao.

“Blunt its sharpness, untie its tangles.” Sharpness refers to the heart’s inclination to plot evil. Tangles refer to anger. Neither is what the Dao delights in. When the heart desires evil, blunt it and turn it back. When anger arises, loosen and dissolve it; do not allow the five viscera to harbor anger. Admonish oneself with the Dao’s precepts, encourage oneself with long life, and in this way attain correctness. Anger and contention, haste and tension—these are the causes of transgression. Accumulated anger harms slowly, but swift anger injures quickly, damaging the five viscera. The Dao cannot heal this, hence the weight of the Dao’s admonitions and its earnest teachings. The reason the five viscera are harmed is that the qi of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth are not in harmony. When harmonious, they generate one another; when in conflict, they overcome one another. Depending on the circumstances of anger, one or another is aroused. When one viscus is aroused, it overcomes its counterpart, causing illness and killing the person. When one encounters a time of yang, the restrained becomes active, the waning becomes flourishing, and the ruling becomes dominant. Anger does no harm, and though one may depart from death, it is as fleeting as a hair. But if one is in decline, the ruling becomes waning, the flourishing becomes restrained, and disaster is complete.

“Harmonize its light and mingle with its dust.” If emotions and nature are unmoved, joy and anger do not arise, the five viscera all harmonize and generate one another, and one mingles with the Dao’s light and dust.

“Profound, it seems ever present.” In this way, it is profoundly and constantly present, never perishing.

“I do not know whose child it is; it resembles the ancestor of the Emperor.” What I serve is the Dao. The ancestor of the Emperor is also the Dao, identical to the nameless origin of the myriad things. I do not know whose child can practice this Dao. Those who can practice it resemble the Dao, like the ancestor of the Emperor.

“Heaven and Earth are not humane; they regard the myriad things as straw dogs.” Heaven and Earth resemble the Dao. They are humane toward the good but not toward the evil. Thus, they kill the evil among the myriad things without love, viewing them as straw and dogs.

“The sage is not humane; he regards the hundred clans as straw dogs.” The sage models himself on Heaven and Earth, humane toward the good but not toward the evil. When governing, he kills the evil, also viewing them as straw and dogs. Therefore, people should accumulate good deeds so that their essence and spirit commune with Heaven. If someone desires to harm them, Heaven will save them. The mediocre are all straw-dog followers; their essence and spirit cannot commune with Heaven. The reason is that, like thieves harboring evil, they dare not face the officials. Their essence and qi are natural but do not draw near to Heaven. At the juncture of life and death, Heaven does not know them. The Yellow Emperor, humane and sagely, knew the intentions of later generations, so he tied straw into dogs and placed them above gates. He meant that the gates of later generations would all be straw-dog followers. People did not understand the Yellow Emperor’s subtle intent, merely imitating him while their evil hearts remained unchanged—this is truly a great calamity.

“Between Heaven and Earth, it is like a bellows.” The qi of the Dao is within, subtle and invisible. All blood-containing beings revere and look up to it. The foolish do not believe, so it is like a bellows used by a craftsman. The pipe can be used to blow bamboo; when qi moves, there is sound, though it cannot be seen. Thus, it is used as a metaphor to enlighten the foolish.

“Empty yet inexhaustible, the more it moves, the more it produces.” The pure qi is invisible, seeming empty, yet in breathing it is not exhausted. The more it moves, the more it produces.

“Much learning and frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center.” Much knowledge is superficial and vain; better to guard the Dao and preserve the body. Lifespans are exhausted and frequently come to an end. Better to study and guard the Dao of harmony and equilibrium.

“The valley spirit does not die; this is called the mysterious female.” The valley is desire. Essence congeals into spirit. To cause the spirit not to die, one must congeal essence and guard it. The female is Earth. Its nature is tranquil, resembling a woman, hence it does not act. A man desiring to congeal essence should make his heart resemble Earth, like a woman, not taking the lead in affairs.

“The gate of the mysterious female is the root of Heaven and Earth.” The female is Earth, resembling a woman. The yin orifice is the gate, the office of life and death, most essential—hence it is called the root. The male organ is also called the root.

“Unceasing, as if existing.”

“In the Dao of yin and yang, life is born through the congealing of essence. When one’s years reach the appointed span, one should cease by nature. In youth, though there may be cause for indulgence, one ought to restrain and reflect. ‘Unceasing, as if existing’—this is subtlety. By preserving subtlety from youth, one may long endure. Yet today, this is deemed a great harm. How does the Dao address it? The Dao values the continuation of ancestral rites, ensuring the lineage does not perish. To enable the union of essence and the generation of life, it teaches the young to subtly restrain without ceasing, not to exhaust themselves through strenuous effort. Such strenuous schemes arise from the minds of fools—how can one blame the Dao? Those of supreme virtue, with steadfast resolve, can refrain from clinging to procreation, ceasing early and thereby swiftly perfecting their spirit. This is the essence of the Dao, hence Heaven and Earth have no ancestral rites, dragons have no offspring, immortals have no wives, and jade maidens no husbands—this is the great truth.

‘In its use, it is not exhausted.’ One who practices this Dao may attain immortal longevity, yet matters of male and female must not be neglected.

‘Heaven is long, Earth enduring. That by which Heaven and Earth are long and enduring is their non-self-generation, thus they endure.’ One who models the Dao may likewise generate the self and endure.

‘Therefore the sage places the self last, yet finds the self first.’ Those who seek long life do not laboriously scheme for wealth to nourish the body, nor seize office without merit to adorn themselves, nor indulge in the five flavors, nor wear fine clothes or shoes, nor contend with the vulgar—this is placing the self last. Yet thereby they attain immortal longevity and blessings, surpassing the common folk—this is finding the self first.

‘Externally disregarding the self, yet the self endures.’ This conveys the same meaning.

‘Because it does not claim the body, it can perfect the body.’ Those ignorant of the Dao of long life treat the body as a mere corpse, not following the Dao but only the ways of the dead. The Daoist who attains immortal longevity does not follow the ways of the dead but differs from the vulgar, thus perfecting the body and becoming an immortal.

‘The highest virtue is like water. Water benefits the myriad things yet does not contend.’ Water is adept at softness and weakness, like the Dao descending from the heights to the lowly, avoiding the solid and returning to the empty. It constantly nourishes the myriad things yet never contends, thus one should model oneself after it.

‘Dwelling where the multitude shuns, it nearly accords with the Dao.’ Water can receive filth and impurity, nearly resembling the Dao.

‘Abiding in good earth, the heart in profound depths.’ Water naturally seeks hollows and cavities, settling to form abysses. An abyss is deep.

‘Giving with benevolence.’ One should model oneself after water, the heart ever delighting in benevolence.

‘Speaking with sincerity.’ One should constantly teach others to do good with honesty and trust.

‘Governing with good order.’ The ruler who governs the state should constantly model governance on the Dao to achieve order.

‘Handling affairs with skill.’ All should seek teachers who are truly skilled in the Dao, not those who practice false arts, deceit, or arrogance.

‘Moving with timely action.’ In all actions, one should not violate the Dao’s precepts nor harm the kingly qi.

‘Only by not contending does one avoid great harm.’ Only by emulating water’s non-contention can one avoid great calamity.

‘Holding and filling it, it is better to cease. Hammering and polishing it, it cannot be long preserved.’ The Dao teaches one to congeal essence into spirit, yet the false arts of the world falsely invoke the texts of the Yellow Emperor, the Dark Maiden, Gongzi, and Rongcheng, teaching men to lie with women without emission. They think to return essence to replenish the brain, but the heart and spirit are not unified, losing what they guard. This is hammering and polishing—it cannot be long preserved. It is not as good as simply following nature.

‘Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them.’ When one’s essence and qi fill the storehouse, yet there is no one to cherish and guard them, refusing to naturally still the heart but instead hammering and disturbing it, one is greatly deluded.

‘Riches and honor leading to arrogance bring self-inflicted blame.’ When essence congeals into spirit and yang qi is abundant, one must cherish oneself, still the heart, and sever thoughts, not arrogantly deceiving yin. Arrogance and deceit bring blame. Alternatively, wielding power and wealth to arrogantly dominate the world also brings blame.

‘When fame and success are achieved, withdraw the self—this is the Dao of Heaven.’ Fame and success are the body’s enemies. When fame and success are complete, the body perishes, hence the Dao warns against them. Fan Li departed by boat, embodying the Dao’s humility and trust. Not concealing his form or fleeing, this is its effect.

‘Carrying the po and embracing the One, can one not part from it?’ The po is white, thus essence, being white, shares the same color as the primordial. The body is the essence’s chariot, and when essence scatters, one must carry and nourish it. When spirit forms and qi arrives, they carry and nourish the human body. To perfect this work, one must not part from the One. The One is the Dao. Where now does it reside in the human body? How should one guard it? The One does not reside in the human body—all that clings to the body are the world’s common false arts, not the true Dao. The One exists beyond Heaven and Earth; humans dwell between them, and the One merely comes and goes within the human body. It pervades the skin and all within, not confined to one place. The One scatters its form as qi, gathers its form as the Most High Lord Lao, and constantly governs Kunlun. Some call it emptiness, some call it spontaneity, some call it the Nameless—all are the same One. Now, spreading the Dao’s precepts and teaching people to guard them without violation is to guard the One. Not practicing its precepts is to lose the One. The world’s common false arts point to the five viscera to name the One, closing the eyes to visualize and seek blessings—this is not so, and one drifts ever farther from life.

‘Concentrating qi to attain softness, one can be like an infant.’ The infant is without contrivance, thus in accord with the Dao, yet cannot restrain itself. As knowledge gradually arises, one ages. Therefore, to attain softness and direct qi, one should model oneself after the smallness of a child.”

“Purify and observe the mysterious vision, that it may be without blemish.”
The human body mirrors heaven and earth. *Lan* means “vast.” *Ci* means “evil.” What is not illumined by the Dao must be cleansed from the body, so that every action is free of evil.

“Cherishing the people and governing the state without cunning.”
If a ruler wishes to cherish the people and grant them long life, and to govern the state so that it attains great peace, he must refine his mind and delve deeply into the Dao’s intent, teaching the people all to know the true Dao, never allowing them to know the false Dao or the demonic arts.

“Comprehending the four directions with clarity, yet acting without contrivance.”
The heart of the superior person is penetrating, and thus knows much. Knowing evil, he discards it; knowing good, he practices it—never daring to do what is evil.

“Heaven and earth open and close, yet act as the female.”
Male and female are the apertures of yin and yang. The male should model himself on earth, resembling the female—this was already explained in the previous chapter.

“Giving life and nurturing, giving life yet not possessing, acting yet not relying, leading yet not dominating—this is called the mysterious power.”
*Xuan* means “heaven.” Constantly following the Dao and acting thus is what the Dao desires people to emulate.

“Thirty spokes share a single hub; it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the cart lies.”
Before carts existed in ancient times, in profound stillness, the Dao sent Xi Zhong to create them. The foolish, upon obtaining a cart, seek only profit and do not reflect on the Dao’s workings or perceive the spirit of the Dao. The wise, seeing it, come to know the Dao’s grace, silently exhorting themselves and diligently guarding the true Dao.

“Kneading clay to make a vessel, it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the vessel lies.”
This is explained in the same way as the cart.

“Cutting doors and windows to make a room, it is where there is nothing that the usefulness of the room lies.”
The Dao caused the Yellow Emperor to create them—this, too, is explained in the same way as the cart.

“Having being to provide benefit, having non-being to provide function.”
These three things were originally difficult to create and could not be made without the Dao. Common people, obtaining them, merely covet their benefits and do not understand their origin. The wise, seeing them, return to guarding their function. Taking the Dao as their foundation, the minds of the wise and the foolish are as distant as south and north, utterly unlike. The meaning of these three examples is thus.

Now, the world’s false arts take the true scriptures as their pretext, weaving deceitful and clever words. They claim the Dao has a celestial hub, that the human body has a hub, that concentrating *qi* to attain softness is the way. The spokes they point to as the body’s linchpins, and they speak of nurturing the embryo and refining the form as if making tiles from clay. They also say the Dao has doors and windows within the human body—all these are demonic falsehoods, unusable. Those who employ them are profoundly deluded.

“The five colors blind the eyes.”
The eyes’ light scatters, and thus they go blind.

“The five tones deafen the ears.”
These are not the refined sounds, but the music of Zheng and Wei. Contentious and harmful, they injure the listener, and when the spirit departs after excessive listening, the ears go deaf.

“The five flavors ruin the mouth.”
The Dao does not partake of them. A ruined mouth festers and breaks out in sores.

“Racing and hunting stir the heart to madness.”
The heart does not dwell on what is right but only on slaughtering innocent beasts—thus it becomes mad.

“Rare and precious goods hinder one’s conduct.”
These are what the Dao does not desire. Practicing the Dao leads to life, not to goods. Goods are contrived, and thus they hinder the Dao.

“Therefore, the sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes—thus he rejects that and embraces this.”
The belly and the eyes were already explained in the previous chapter. Rejecting those evil actions, he embraces the Dao’s precepts.

“Favor and disgrace are like surprise; value great misfortune as you do your own body.”
The Dao does not delight in forcibly seeking honor and nobility. Where there is favor, disgrace inevitably follows. *Ruo* means “like.” When one obtains favor, one should be as if startled, not delighting in it. *Ruo* refers to those people. If one violates the Dao to seek glory, misfortune will return to one’s own body.

“What is meant by ‘favor and disgrace are base’? Obtaining them is like surprise, losing them is like surprise—this is what is meant by ‘favor and disgrace are like surprise.’”
Those who are base are people who covet favor, reckoning themselves among the lowly—this is not what the Dao values.

“What is meant by ‘value great misfortune as you do your own body’?”
As explained above.

“Why do I have great misfortune? Because I have a body.”
*Wu* is the Dao. *Wo* is the same as *wu*. The Dao is most revered and constantly fears misfortune, never daring to seek glory. It desires to diminish the body. How can those who covet favor compare their bodies to the Dao? Acting for the body and violating the precepts is wrong.

“When I have no body, what misfortune can I have?”
*Wu* and *wo* are the Dao. Its aspiration is to have no body, only to nurture the spirit. It speaks thus to encourage people to emulate it

The Dao is the root of all things under heaven. Those who question it find its manifestations too numerous to record—even bamboo and silk cannot contain them all—so they return to the One. What harm is there in multiplicity? When simplicity scatters and purity thins, it only deepens the confusion. Thus, it cannot be questioned.

*“Its ascent is not bright, its descent is not obscure.”*
The qi of the Dao constantly ascends and descends, operating within and beyond heaven and earth. It remains unseen because it is clear and subtle. Above, it is not bright; below, it is not obscure—obscurity would imply sound.

*“Vague and elusive, it cannot be named, yet returns to nothingness.”*
The Dao is like this—unnameable, as if it were nothing.

*“This is the form of the formless, the image of the imageless.”*
The Dao is most revered, subtle and hidden, without form, appearance, or image. One can only follow its precepts; it cannot be seen or known. The false arts of the world today point to forms and names to describe the Dao, assigning it colors, titles, shapes, and measurements—this is not so. All of it is false and deceptive.

*“This is called the state of indistinctness. Meet it, and you do not see its head; follow it, and you do not see its rear.”*
The Dao is luminous yet unknowable, without form or image.

*“Hold to the ancient Dao to govern the present existence.”*
How do we know this Dao truly exists today? By observing the ancients who attained immortality and longevity—all practiced it. Thus, we know that the Dao has not vanished from the world.

*“Trace back to the ancient beginning—this is called the thread of the Dao.”*
If one can take the ancient immortals and long-lived as examples and today strive to uphold the true Dao, one grasps the guiding principle of the Dao.

*“The ancients who excelled as scholars were subtle, mysterious, and profoundly penetrating.”*
“Mysterious” refers to heaven. The ancient immortals could guard the subtle and wondrous, communing with heaven, so deep they could not be fathomed. Those who practice the Dao and follow its precepts find their subtle qi returning to them, making their qi profound and deep—thus, they cannot be known.

*“Only because they could not be known were they forced to be described.”*
“Only” means alone. “Described” means given form. Those who alone practice the Dao, whose virtue is complete and profound, cannot be named—so they are forcibly called “excellent scholars,” praising the greatness of the Dao.

*“Hesitant, as if crossing a river in winter; cautious, as if fearing neighbors on all sides.”*
Crossing a river in winter brings fear; fearing one’s neighbors means not daring to do wrong, lest they find out. Those who revere the Dao and follow its precepts should be this hesitant and reverent in all their actions.

*“Solemn, like a guest.”*
Modest and not daring to commit wrongdoing, like a guest in a host’s hall.

*“Yielding, like ice about to melt.”*
Desires, thoughts, anger, and resentment—these are not what the Dao desires. When the heart seeks to indulge them, one must immediately restrain and dissolve them, like ice melting in the sun.

*“Simple, like uncarved wood; open, like a valley.”*
Strive to trust the true Dao, discard false knowledge, and guard the original simplicity, free from other thoughts. The heart is vast and open, trusting the Dao like a valley’s resolve, flowing eastward without longing to return to the sea.

*“Turbid, like muddied water—yet when still, it gradually clears.”*
Those who seek life do not resent those who do not repay them, nor do they hold grudges against those who seize from them. They do not follow the world’s shifts. Truly aspiring to the Dao, they study and know clarity and stillness, appearing dull and turbid in the moment. By being dull and turbid, they approach simplicity and desire, and then clarity and stillness allow them to perceive the subtle. Internally clear and bright, they do not desire the worldly. Clarity and stillness are the great essentials, what the subtle Dao delights in. When heaven and earth are serene, clouds rise and dew forms, nourishing all things. When swift thunder and wind rush forth, the sky dries and things wither—the qi of the Dao hides and does not circulate. People emulate heaven and earth, so they must not dwell in dryness. They should always prioritize clarity and stillness. Morning and evening, dew ascends and descends, and the qi of the human body spreads accordingly. The master establishes morning and evening practices, with clarity and stillness as the great essentials. Thus, even when heaven and earth falter, people, following the precepts, can reflect and return to the original purity of the Dao. If human virtue falls short and they err, they should not turn away and abandon it but should restrain themselves and hold fast.

*“In tranquility, movement brings gradual life.”*
When one wishes to act, first consider the Dao’s precepts. Calmly reflect on its meaning, ensuring no violation of the Dao, then proceed slowly—thus, the Dao of life does not depart.

*“Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.”*
They do not desire their will and thoughts to overflow with evil.

*“Only by not being full can one put off decay and achieve renewal.”*
The corpse in death is decay; the living body is renewal. Only by guarding the Dao without overflow can one transform decay into renewal.

*“Attain utmost emptiness, guard stillness firmly.”*
The true Dao has its own constant measure, but people cannot understand it. They must again long for the world’s common arts, teaching by pointing to forms and names, assigning the Dao a place, colors, and measurements, then contemplating it. This brings extreme suffering without reward—it is mere emptiness and deceit. Forcing emptiness and deceit to be real is extreme. It is better to guard stillness firmly.

*“As the ten thousand things arise together, I observe their return. Though things flourish, each returns to its root.”*
All things contain the essence of the Dao. When they arise together at the beginning of life, I—the Dao—observe the moment their essence returns. All return to their root, so people should treasure and be cautious of regret.

*“Returning to the root is called stillness.”*
When the qi of the Dao returns to the root, it becomes even more clear and still.

*“Stillness is called returning to destiny; returning to destiny is called constancy.”*
Knowing to treasure the root and clarity is the constant law of returning to destiny.

*“To know constancy is called illumination.”*
Only by knowing this constant law can one be called enlightened.

*“Not knowing constancy leads to reckless action and misfortune.”*
The world’s common false arts do not know the meaning of constancy. They recklessly point and write, so all bring misfortune.

*“To know constancy is to be all-embracing.”*
Knowing the meaning of the constant law, one preserves form and appearance.

*“Being all-embracing leads to impartiality.”*
Using the Dao to preserve form and appearance is to be embraced by heaven and earth. Dwelling between heaven and earth, unafraid of death, one is thus impartial.

“Impartiality gives rise to life.”
To practice impartial governance through the Dao is to attain constant life.

“Life accords with heaven.”
To achieve longevity is to match heaven.

“Heaven accords with the Dao.”
Heaven endures through life by modeling itself on the Dao.

“The Dao endures.”
When people model themselves on the Dao’s intent, they too attain longevity.

“Even in death, one remains unharmed.”
The Palace of Great Yin is where the Dao accumulates and refines form.
When the world becomes uninhabitable, the worthy withdraw and feign death.
Passing through the midst of Great Yin, they reemerge in another realm, thus remaining unharmed even in death.
The common people, unable to accumulate good deeds, die in truth and are consigned to the earthly officials.

“The highest know only of its existence.”
To know the Dao is the highest knowledge.
To know evil is the lower knowledge.
Even those with the highest knowledge must fully recognize evil and reform themselves to avoid committing it.

“Next are those who draw near and praise it.”
When one encounters those who seek goodness and understand the Dao’s intent, they are worthy of closeness.
When one sees those who diligently study goodness, they may be praised and further instructed, encouraged to assist in spreading the Dao’s teachings.

“Next are those who stand in awe of it.”
When one encounters the wicked, they should be admonished with goodness.
If such a person heeds righteousness and submits, they may be taught to reform.
One should approach them with Daoist admonitions, instilling awe of heaven’s majesty to prompt self-correction.

“Next are those who scorn it.”
When one speaks of goodness to the wicked and they remain unchanged, mocking instead, these are but chaff and straw—no better than beasts.
They may be disdained and not engaged in speech.

“When trust is insufficient, there is distrust.”
Those who are chaff and straw lack inner trust, so they do not believe the words of the good.

“Cherishing its words brings success and fulfillment.”
Not a single word of the Dao may be discarded.
Those who attain immortality value the Dao’s words, and thus their affairs invariably succeed.

“The common people say, ‘We are natural.’”
“We” refers to the immortals.
The common people, unaware that we value and trust the Dao’s words to achieve such merit, assume we are naturally so and thus do not strive to emulate us.

“When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.”
In high antiquity, when the Dao was in use, people acted with benevolence and righteousness as a matter of course, all resembling one another—benevolence and righteousness were not distinct.
Now that the Dao is unused, people have grown base and shallow; when one person acts righteously, they are singled out and exalted, hence the claim that such virtues exist.

“When cunning and wisdom arise, there is great deceit.”
When the true Dao is concealed, heretical texts emerge.
The world’s common false arts, claiming to teach the Dao, are all great deceits and cannot be employed.
What are heretical texts? Half of the Five Classics have fallen into heresy, and all books and records beyond the Five Classics—composed by corpses of men—are heresy.

“When the six relations are not harmonious, there is filial piety and compassion.”
When the Dao was in use, every household practiced compassion and filial piety, all resembling one another—compassion and filial piety were not distinct.
Now that the Dao is unused, people lack compassion and filial piety; when the six relations are disharmonious and one person practices compassion and filial piety, they are singled out and exalted, hence the claim that such virtues exist.

“When the state is benighted and chaotic, there are loyal ministers.”
When the Dao was in use, the emperor and king personally practiced it, refining and clarifying its intent to instruct their ministers and subjects, so that all officials and people followed their example.
Understanding the Dao’s intent, they held death in contempt and valued immortality, competing in loyalty and filial piety, embodying simplicity, sincerity, and uprightness.
Ministers were all loyal, resembling one another—loyalty was not distinct.
Now that the Dao is unused, ministers all study heretical texts, practicing deceit and cunning, following their whims, speaking kindly while harboring malice.
When one person acts with loyalty and sincerity, they are singled out and exalted, hence the claim that such virtues exist.
When the Dao was in use, ministers were loyal and children filial, making the state easy to govern.
At that time, ministers and children did not fear their rulers or fathers but feared the heavenly spirits.
Their filial conduct was not for the sake of attaining immortality and longevity but arose from utmost sincerity.
Having become loyal and filial, they did not wish their rulers or fathers to know, acting in silence.
They sought heavenly reward, and if their rulers or fathers learned of their deeds, they would surely reward them with high office and repay them with favor, thus exhausting their merit and preventing heavenly blessings from arriving.
Therefore, they acted in silence, not seeking recognition.
Today’s ministers and children, though loyal and filial, all seek to curry favor with their rulers or fathers for merit and fame.
If they are not distinguished in due time, they become resentful, claiming ignorance.
Such people appear one way outwardly but another inwardly, lacking the utmost sincerity to move heaven, making the state difficult to govern.
To remedy this ill, the emperor and king must wholeheartedly trust the Dao’s admonitions.

“Abandon sagacity and discard knowledge, and the people will benefit a hundredfold.”
This refers to those who feign sagacity and knowledge through heretical texts.
The sage is heaven’s chosen, born with distinction, their names recorded in the Yellow River and Luo River charts, yet they always proclaim the truth and do not err in their reception.
The heretical Dao does not trust the words of enlightened sages, so it compels great sages across millennia to expound the truth and purge heretical texts.
Now, people without virtue, having merely skimmed the classics and arts without grasping the true Dao, call themselves sages.
Without relying on fundamentals, they compose chapters and measure themselves, unable to attain the Dao, speaking only for themselves.
They do not encourage people to seek the true Dao for immortality and longevity through diligent cultivation of goodness but instead claim that immortality depends on one’s innate record, that no path leads to life, and that Daoist texts deceive—such are the sins that fill three thousand, making them great evildoers.
They cause later learners to no longer trust the Dao.
The common people do not turn back, children do not think of supporting their parents, and the people do not tend their fields, but instead pursue heretical studies, swaying between teachers’ gates, exhausting their breath in reciting illnesses, even to their dying day.
They cannot achieve loyalty and filial piety to move heaven, cannot govern their bodies to attain immortality and longevity, and cannot assist their rulers in bringing great peace.
As the people persist in this, cities and towns become desolate—hence the need to abandon false sagacity and heretical knowledge, not the true sagacity and knowledge of the Dao.

“Abandon benevolence and discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and compassion.”
To govern the state by the Dao is to allow the people to follow their natural inclinations in benevolence and righteousness, without imposing forced rewards.

Thus it is: to honor and magnify transformation, to widely disseminate the heart of the Dao—when people practice benevolence and righteousness, they naturally attain perfect sincerity, and Heaven itself rewards them. Those who fail to attain perfect sincerity are punished by Heaven. Heaven’s scrutiny of humanity is ever precise, and all come to revere the Dao and stand in awe of Heaven, so that benevolence and righteousness naturally become perfectly sincere.

Yet when royal governance enforces rewards by force, the people no longer turn to Heaven. Seeing that others can be deceived, they feign benevolence and righteousness, seeking only official emoluments and rewards. Though others may know their hypocrisy, seeing them gain office and stipends, they too emulate them, dissembling in benevolence and righteousness—yet in the end, none attain it. Since the world’s judgment is not precise, it is best to abandon such rewards entirely, and the people will all naturally return to compassion and filial piety. This principle runs counter to the hearts of common men, but with time, they will come to understand and align with the Dao. Rulers must deeply and clearly grasp this.

“Abandon craftiness and forsake profit, and thieves and bandits will vanish.”
Craftiness refers to heretical cunning, and profit to the wealth and treasures thus obtained. If the world does not employ these, thieves and bandits will find no advantage in them.

“These three sayings, though their phrasing is insufficient, are thus made to belong to what follows: ‘See the plain and embrace the uncarved.’”
These three matters are the wellsprings of the world’s great chaos, and so they are expounded and dispersed. Even myriad words would not suffice, nor could bamboo and silk contain them—hence they are made to belong to this text of the Dao, not to external writings. Their general import is sketched here, so that one may recognize the origins of disorder.

“Reduce selfishness and diminish desire.”
This is what the Dao teaches: to be without selfishness and to have few desires in worldly matters.

“Abandon learning and there will be no sorrow. Between ‘only this’ and ‘what else,’ how great is the distance?”
Those who do not yet understand may again question this: if one abandons heretical learning, what does the Dao offer in return? How far apart are the Dao and heresy? Abandon heretical learning, hold fast to the Dao alone, and the Dao will surely be with you. The distance between the Dao and heresy is vast—Dao gives life, heresy brings death. Death belongs to earth, life to Heaven, and thus they are infinitely far apart.

“Between beauty and ugliness, how great is the distance?”
Those who do not yet understand may again question this, wishing to know how near or far beauty and ugliness lie from each other—just as the Dao and heretical learning are near or far. Now they are equal. Beauty is goodness, and thus belongs to Heaven; ugliness is death, and thus belongs to earth.

“What all people fear, one cannot but fear—how boundless and unending it is!”
The Dao establishes life to reward goodness and death to deter evil—death is what all people fear. Immortal adepts and common folk alike know to fear death and delight in life, though their conduct differs. Common folk wander blindly, never escaping death. Though they fear death, they utterly disbelieve in the Dao and delight in evil deeds—how can they ever escape death? Immortal adepts fear death, trust in the Dao, and keep its precepts, and thus align with life.

“The multitude, bustling and joyous, as if feasting on great sacrificial oxen, as if ascending a terrace in spring.”
Common folk, who do not believe in the Dao, delight in evil deeds as if partaking in a grand feast or ascending a high terrace in spring.

“My soul is yet unformed, like an infant not yet able to smile, drifting without refuge.”
I—an immortal adept—delight only in trusting the Dao and keeping its precepts, not in evil deeds. When faced with evil, my heart is empty, like an infant before birth.

“The multitude all have more than enough; I alone seem to have lost something.”
Common folk, harboring evil, are ever full of scheming thoughts and anxious calculations. The heart of an immortal adept has forgotten all such things, possessing nothing.

“My heart is that of a fool, so pure and simple.”
An immortal adept savors the Dao and knows nothing of worldly affairs. Pure and simple—like one who is dull-witted.

“Common folk are radiant.”
Common folk, who do not believe in the Dao, see only the profit in heretical evil. Radiant—they are exceedingly bright.

“I alone seem dim.”
An immortal adept closes his heart, not pondering the profit in heretical evil—dim, as if shrouded in darkness.

“Common folk are keen and discerning.”
They know worldly affairs with sharp clarity.

“Alone, I am dull and listless.”
He knows nothing of worldly affairs.

“Vague as dusk, drifting without a place to rest.”
The will of an immortal adept is as dim as dusk, fixed upon the Dao. He lies at ease upon his bed, no longer entangled in worldly matters. His concentrated thought rests upon the Dao, not upon worldly affairs.

“Common folk all have their possessions; I alone seem stubborn and coarse.”
In the world, common folk possess wealth, treasures, merit, and fame. To an immortal adept, worldly things are but stubborn coarseness.

“I wish to be different from others, and so I prize feeding the Mother.”
The immortal adept differs from common folk: he does not value glory, emolument, wealth, or treasure, but only feeding the Mother. The Mother is the body, within which the stomach governs the qi of the five viscera. Common folk eat grain, and when grain is exhausted, they die. The immortal adept may eat grain when it is available, but when it is not, he eats qi. When qi returns to the stomach, it fills the intestines like a heavy sack. The belly as treasure has already been explained in the preceding chapter.

“The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao.”
The Dao is vast, and its teachings surpass even those of Confucius. Later generations do not trust the texts of the Dao, but instead exalt the books of Confucius as supreme. Thus, the Dao clarifies this to instruct later worthies.

“As a thing, the Dao is only vague and indistinct.”
The Dao is subtle, existing in vagueness and indistinctness, invisible. Within this vagueness, there are things; within this indistinctness, there are images. One must not dismiss the Dao because it cannot be seen. Within it lies great spirit-qi, hence the metaphor of a sack and its key.

“In the profound darkness, there is essence.”
Within the great void, there is the essence of the Dao, which it distributes to the myriad things. The essence of the myriad things shares a single root. This essence is most true, governing life and death. Since its essence is true, it must be treasured.

“Within it, there is reliability.”
Ancient immortal adepts treasured essence to live; modern people lose essence and die—this is great reliability. But if one merely binds essence, can one thereby attain life? No. All practices must be complete. Essence is but a separate qi of the Dao, entering the human body as its root. Half is held, and thus it is spoken of first. To treasure essence, all conduct must be complete, all virtues manifest. The five phases must be harmonized, joy and anger wholly abandoned. The celestial tally on the left must have surplus numbers, and only then will essence be preserved. If an evil person treasures essence, he labors in vain and cannot retain it, for it will surely leak away. The heart, conforming to regulations, governs all things—hence it is called the Hall of Light. The three paths distribute yang and yin, harm and benefit, measuring the Dao-qi with central rectitude. Essence is likened to the water of a pond, the body to the pond’s embankment, and good conduct to the water’s source. Only when these three are complete is the pond whole and firm. If the heart is not devoted to goodness, there is no embankment; the water will surely depart. If good conduct is not accumulated, the source is blocked; the water will surely dry up. If water is channeled to irrigate the fields, the ditches become like streams and rivers. Though the embankment remains, if the source does not flow, the pond will still be empty. If the mountains are parched and cracked, a hundred illnesses arise together. If these three are not carefully tended, the pond becomes an empty pit.

“From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart.”
From ancient times to now, this one Dao has always been shared, never leaving humanity.

“Thereby I observe the beginnings of the multitude.”
Since the Dao’s inception, it has repeatedly observed endings and beginnings—it is not singular. *Fu* means beginning.

“How do I know the nature of endings and beginnings? By this.”
I, the Dao, know that from ancient times to the present, endings and beginnings share this one Dao. The matter is thus.

“That which is bent will be whole.”
This is humility. The moon, though first bent, later becomes fully bright. To study the Dao is to turn away from the common; at first, it may seem insufficient, but later it will bring clarity.

“That which is crooked will be straight.”
Crookedness is also bending; when bent, it transforms into straightness. To study the Dao is to turn away from the common, enduring hardship alone. At first, it may seem as though one is being wronged, but later it will lead to rectitude.

“That which is hollow will be filled.”
This is a humble and empty mind. When one does no evil, one’s place is empty. The Dao is like water, which delights in dwelling in empty, lowly places. Thus, it becomes good, and qi returns to fill it.

“That which is worn will be renewed.”
When things wear out, they transform and become new. To study the Dao is to endure weariness and hardship, but later it will bring new blessings.

“With little, one gains; with much, one is confused.”
When one exerts effort to cultivate grain, one should only seek self-sufficiency. Heaven bestows it, and without a foundation of merit, one cannot obtain blessings. Excessive desires lead to confusion, and confusion invites calamity.

“Therefore, the sage embraces the One and serves as a model for the world.”
The One is the Dao. The sage establishes precepts and practices them, embracing the One. He constantly teaches the world to take it as a model.

“Not self-righteous, thus distinguished.”
The enlightened delight in it and approach its precepts and teachings. Those who do not delight in it are like ink—do not speak to them. If I am right and they are wrong, do not contend with them.

“Not self-displaying, thus illuminated.”
The sage follows the Dao, and though his merit is not great, he does not display his virtue or ability.

“Not self-aggrandizing, thus meritorious.”
Evil is the axe that hews the self. The sage follows the Dao and does no evil, thus he does not hew himself and always preserves his merit.

“Not self-conceited, thus enduring.”
The sage follows the Dao, only concerned with accumulating conduct to prolong his life. The conduct of life includes enduring disgrace, poverty, and hardship. He does not pride himself on injuring his body by indulging in fine clothes and rich food.

“Only because he does not contend, none can contend with him.”
The sage does not contend with common folk. When contention arises, he avoids it and ascends to lofty heights. How can common folk contend with him?

“The ancient saying, ‘That which is bent will be whole,’ is no empty phrase. Thus, it is fulfilled and returns to wholeness.”
That humility leads to wholeness is no empty phrase. Fearing that people may not understand, it is reiterated here.

“Sparse words accord with the natural.”
The natural is the Dao. Delighting in tranquility, sparse words lead to tranquility. Aligning with the natural, one may endure.

“Whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day.”
Not aligning with tranquility and the natural, they do not last the entire day.

“Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth.”

"Who brings these about? Heaven and Earth."
"Who" means "whom." Heaven and Earth generate whirlwinds and sudden rains as warnings for humankind. Not aligning with the Dao, they do not last long.

"Heaven and Earth cannot even endure, let alone humankind."
If even Heaven and Earth cannot endure, how can humankind, with their restless affairs, schemes, and calculations, hope to last?

"Thus, in all undertakings, when the Dao is attained..."
"When" means "to be like." When one conducts affairs in accordance with the Dao, the Dao, in its goodness, desires to attain them—this is called the natural.

"Those who align with virtue, virtue attains them."
When one conducts affairs in harmony with virtue, virtue desires to attain them.

"Those who align with loss, the Dao loses them."
When one conducts affairs without heeding the Dao’s warnings, losing the Dao’s intent, the Dao departs from them—this is the natural course.

"Trust is insufficient, hence there is distrust."
This was already explained in the previous chapter.

"Panting does not last."
Using qi with labored breath, not aligning with tranquility, cannot endure.

"Striding does not proceed."
To walk a thousand miles begins with a single step, accumulating gradually. Now, standing with great strides, one cannot walk far—this cannot last.

"Those who display themselves are not enlightened; those who assert themselves are not illustrious; those who boast achieve no merit; those who are self-important do not endure."
This further explains the meaning of the previous chapter.

"From the perspective of the Dao..."

To seek immortality, longevity, and celestial blessings, one must trust in the Dao, uphold its precepts, keep faith, and avoid repeated transgressions. Sins accumulate in the celestial courts; when the right tally fails to arrive, one is left destitute—no other recourse remains.

"Leftover food and discarded conduct—things abhor them."
Those who follow the Dao live; those who lose the Dao die. This is Heaven’s just law, not found in sacrificial offerings or prayers. The Dao thus forbids sacrificial rites and prayers, meting out severe punishment, for such acts align with evil and share its nature. Hence, leftover food and vessels are things the Daoist utterly rejects.

"Thus, one who possesses the Dao does not dwell there."
Those who possess the Dao do not linger among sacrificial rites and prayers.

"There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth, silent and solitary, unchanging, circulating without cease—it may be called the Mother of all under heaven."
This extols the nameless, great Dao—truly the Mother of all under heaven.

"I know not its name; I style it 'Dao.'"
I—this is the Dao. Again, it praises the Dao’s beauty, so profound it defies naming, hence called "Dao."

"I force a name upon it: 'Great.'"
The Dao is supremely great. "Force" implies fear that no name can fully capture its virtue.

"Great means it departs."
Departing—it goes. No power can restrain the great spirit; it simply rises and goes.

"Departing means it is far."
Swiftly, it can go far.

"Far means it returns."
Swiftly, it can return.

"The Dao is great, Heaven is great, Earth is great, and the King is great."
Among these four great things, which is greatest? The Dao is greatest.

"Within the realm, there are four great things, and the King occupies one."
Among the four great things, what enables the King to occupy one? The King—an alternate form of the Dao.

"Man models himself on Earth, Earth on Heaven, Heaven on the Dao, and the Dao on spontaneity."
Spontaneity shares the Dao’s name but differs in form. They model one another, all following the Dao. Heaven and Earth, vast as they are, constantly model themselves on the Dao to endure—how much more should man revere the Dao?

"Weight is the root of lightness; stillness is the lord of restlessness."
The Daoist must value spirit and take tranquility as the foundation.

"Thus, the noble person travels all day without leaving the baggage train."
Valuing spirit and tranquility is the noble person’s baggage; one must carry it all day without parting.

"Though there be splendid sights, one dwells in serenity, transcendent."
Even emperors and kings, though surrounded by splendor and revered by all, must value tranquility and uphold the Dao’s precepts.

"How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his person lightly before all under heaven?"
The Son of Heaven wields the people’s authority and should especially fear Heaven and revere the Dao. If he errs in thinking himself noble and no longer fears the celestial Dao, he treats his person lightly before all under heaven.

"Lightness loses the root; restlessness loses the lord."
Excessive lightness and restlessness violate the Dao’s measure, inviting punishment and disgrace, losing one’s foundation and forfeiting esteem.

"Good conduct leaves no tracks."
Trusting the Dao and doing good leaves no evil traces.

"Good words leave no flaws."
When one speaks not in accord with the Dao, Heaven swiftly seizes one’s years. Now, trusting the Dao and speaking well, teaching without evil—there is no fault.

"Good reckoning requires no counting rods."
The wise reckon with the heart’s understanding; no rods are needed. Those who wholeheartedly trust the Dao act with utmost sincerity, needing no external exhortation.

"Good closure requires no bolts, yet cannot be opened."
The three rivers of the heart—yang evil and yin harm—must all be closed and unused. The central Dao is the norm. One who can close evil intentions with utmost sincerity, though lacking bolts, can never be opened. One lacking sincerity, though bolts be present, may yet be opened.

"Good binding requires no cords, yet cannot be undone."
Binding the will to seek life, one must follow the Dao’s precepts. One who does so with utmost sincerity, though lacking cords, can never be undone. One lacking sincerity, though cords be present, may yet be undone.

"Thus, the sage constantly excels in saving people and discards none."
Ever doing good, the sage does not abandon even the wicked. Approaching them, he teaches and shows the Dao’s precepts. If they remain untransformed, nothing more can be done.

"Constantly excelling in saving things, he discards nothing."
This shares the same meaning as above.

"This is called inheriting illumination."
Inheriting—constant illumination. Knowing this intent is truly bright.

"The good person is the teacher of the not-good."
The not-good learn goodness from the good, hence the latter is their teacher. Never do the good learn goodness from the not-good.

"The not-good person is the resource of the good."
The good, being without evil, take the evil as their resource. Seeing others’ evil as intolerable, the good redouble their diligence.

"One who does not value the teacher nor cherish the resource, though wise, is greatly deluded."
The not-good do not value the good; the good do not use the evil to reform themselves—both are greatly deluded.

"This is called the essential mystery."
Knowing this is most essential and wondrous.

"Know the masculine, keep to the feminine, and be the ravine of all under heaven."
Desire the masculine to be like the feminine. Ravine—what is it? It is also near the essential. Knowing the essential and calming the spirit, one grasps the essential of all under heaven.

"With constant virtue unceasing, return to the state of the infant."
Focusing the essence without action, virtue constantly remains unseparated, returning again to the state of the infant.

"Know the white, keep to the black, and be the model for all under heaven."
Essence-white shares the color of primordial qi; black is within the Great Yin. In man, it resides in the kidneys. Storing essence, one remains tranquil and unused—this is keeping to the black, the constant model for all under heaven.

"With constant virtue unborrowed, return to the boundless."
Knowing to keep to the black, virtue constantly abides, not borrowed from others—one must repay it, but it is better to possess it oneself.

Practicing the methods of the *Xuan Nü Jing*, Gongzi, and Rong Cheng—all seek to borrow, but from whom should a ruler borrow? Thus, it cannot be done. Only by self-guardianship, severing the heart and closing the mind, does one attain the great boundless.

"Know glory, guard disgrace, and be the valley of all under heaven."
Where there is glory, there must be disgrace. The Daoist fears disgrace and thus does not covet glory, but directs their aspiration toward the Dao. Their sole wish is long life, like the valley waters of all under heaven desiring to flow eastward and return to the sea.

"As the valley of all under heaven, constant virtue is thus fulfilled, returning to the uncarved block."
Aspiring to the Dao should be like the valley waters’ resolve to return to the sea—virtue is constantly fulfilled. The uncarved block is the original qi of the Dao. When one practices the Dao and returns to the uncarved block, they merge with the Dao.

"When the uncarved block is carved into vessels, the sage uses them as officials."
Carving vessels departs from the Dao; one should not allow the uncarved block to scatter. The sage prevents its scattering, thus officials govern the people and bring about great peace.

"Therefore, great governance requires no division."
The Daoist knows that worldly affairs—high office, heavy emoluments, fine clothing, delicious food, and precious treasures—cannot bring long life. Long life is the greatest blessing, and the Daoist desires greatness, thus restraining themselves from letting worldly affairs divide their heart and emotions.

"Those who would take all under heaven and act upon it..."
Mad and deluded men scheme to usurp and murder, but Heaven will surely slay them—it cannot be done.

"I see."
"I" is the Dao. It sees that the exalted position of all under heaven is not something to be acted upon arbitrarily; one dares not do so. How can the foolish prevail over the Dao? Acting thus only brings harm.

"Its necessity..."
A state cannot be without a ruler for a single day. The essence of the Five Emperors was born, and their names appeared in the Yellow River and Luo River; the essence of the Seven Mansions was seen, and the Five Planets aligned. Clearly, they received Heaven’s mandate and were compelled to act—this is necessity, not something all under heaven can presume to emulate.

"The divine vessel of all under heaven cannot be acted upon; those who act upon it will fail, and those who grasp it will lose it."
Those not mandated by Heaven will surely fail and lose it. Things may lead or follow, naturally responding to one another. When one does good, the Dao follows; when one does evil, harm follows.

Some exhale warmth, some blow cold—good and evil follow the same rule, fortune and misfortune share the same root. Though one may gain warmth, one must be cautious of the cold returning; though one may gain fortune, one must be wary of misfortune’s approach.

"Some are strong, some are weak."
After strength comes weakness, and after weakness comes strength. Those who are strong first will later be weak; the Daoist first appears weak, then becomes strong.

"Some support, some follow."
One must always rely on oneself, making the calming of the spirit the foundation—one cannot depend on others for support. The ruler of a perilous state is sustained by loyal ministers; without them, the state perishes. The sick are saved by physicians; without control, they die.

"Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, extravagance, and excessiveness."
Eliminate extreme evil and excessive extravagance.

"Those who assist the ruler with the Dao do not use military force to dominate all under heaven."
The ruler who governs the state focuses on cultivating virtue; loyal ministers assist by practicing the Dao. When the Dao spreads and virtue overflows, great peace arrives. When officials and people cherish and admire it, governance becomes easy. If all trust in the Dao, they will attain immortality and longevity—one must not rely on military force. Arms are not auspicious instruments; the Dao manifests form to awe those who do not transform. One must not delight in them wholeheartedly. Thus, the Dao rejects the armory, distances itself from the Wolf and Fox constellations. Generals, cavalry officers, and the Room constellation reside externally; the Sharp Star’s influence is gentle and far removed. One should simply trust in the Dao—military strategy is secondary.

"Its affairs return in kind."
Using arms to settle affairs, causing harm and killing beyond measure, brings calamity that rebounds upon oneself and one’s descendants.

"Where the army dwells, thorns and brambles grow."
The Son of Heaven’s army is called a host. When arms do not accord with the Dao, only killing energy is seen where they dwell—no people are seen, only thorns and brambles grow.

"Thus, the good achieve their aim and no more, not using it to seek strength."
*Aim* means sincerity. One should be sincerely good and no more, not relying on arms to plot evil and strengthen oneself.

"Achieving the aim without arrogance..."
Being sincerely good, one does not act arrogantly toward others.

"Achieving the aim without self-importance..."
Being sincerely good, one does not aggrandize oneself.

"Achieving the aim without boasting..."
Being sincerely good, one does not boast of oneself.

"Achieving the aim out of necessity—this is achieving the aim without force."
Being sincerely good, one does not covet military might. If one assists the emperor in military affairs, it should be out of necessity. One must not delight in it or habitually rely on force. Feng Hou assisted the Yellow Emperor in defeating Chiyou; Lü Wang assisted King Wu in defeating Zhou—both acted out of necessity.

"When things reach their prime, they age—this is called not following the Dao; what does not follow the Dao perishes early."
Those who hear the Dao but do not practice it age; if aging does not cease, they perish early.

"Fine weapons are inauspicious instruments; some things detest them, and those with the Dao do not dwell in them."
Arms are not favored by the Dao; those with the Dao do not dwell in them.

"The noble person values the left in dwelling, but values the right in using arms."
Left and right are correlative.

"Arms are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person."
This further clarifies their ominous nature.

"Using them only out of necessity..."
This was explained in the previous chapter.

"Serenity and tranquility are supreme, thus they are not prized."
The Daoist remains serene and tranquil, not prizing arms.

"If one prizes them, one must delight in them—this is to delight in killing.
Those who delight in killing cannot achieve their will in the world."
This clarifies that delighting in arms and killing is impermissible.

"Thus, in auspicious affairs, the left is honored; in mourning, the right is honored."
Left and right are correlative.

"Therefore, the deputy general stands on the left, while the supreme general stands on the right."
The deputy general does not monopolize the power over life and death, resembling the left;
the supreme general holds sole authority over killing, resembling the right.

"This means to conduct warfare with the rites of mourning.
When many are killed, mourn them with sorrow and tears;
treat victory in war with the rites of mourning."
When compelled to act, repeatedly issue orders and admonitions in accordance with the Dao,
hoping to accept their surrender.
Those who do not comply should be met with compassion, sorrow, and tears,
as if mourning one’s own family—never with joy or exultation.

"The Dao is eternally nameless."
It does not claim greatness, but entrusts itself to the subtle and small.

"Though the uncarved block is small, none in the world dare make it a subject."
Though the Dao is subtle and small, it is the mother of all under heaven,
and thus cannot be made a subject.

"If kings and lords can hold to it, the myriad things will naturally submit."
One must not value rank and slight the Dao;
when one abides by it, the myriad things will naturally submit and yield.

"When heaven and earth unite, sweet dew descends."
When the ruler practices the Dao, heaven and earth rejoice, and life flourishes.

"The people, without command, naturally harmonize."
When the ruler honors the Dao, officials and people emulate it,
fearing not laws but the spirits of heaven.
They dare not commit wrongdoing, all desiring to preserve themselves,
and thus, without decree, naturally attain balance.

"Only when systems begin do names arise."
The Daoist seeks life, not coveting glory or fame.
Now, kings and lords inherit the legacy of their ancestors,
possessing honor and renown, yet they do not forcibly seek more.
They heed the Dao, merely desiring to uphold its precepts and practice its admonitions,
without arrogance or excess.

"Once names exist, one must also know when to stop."
Kings and lords inherit the legacy of their ancestors.
Having attained renown, they should know contentment and sufficiency,
not further pursuing loftier heights or forcibly seeking more.

"Knowing when to stop, one avoids peril."
All who know contentment and sufficiency will never face danger.

"The Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the Yangtze and the sea."
The Dao in the world is like the rivers and seas;
when one’s heart is set on the Dao, it should be as valleys and streams longing to return to the sea.

"To know others is wisdom."
To discern the good and evil of others,
to recognize what does not accord with the Dao—
the Daoist should only examine themselves,
ensuring they do not fall into mortal peril,
not judging others.

"To know oneself is clarity."
This is most clear.

"To conquer others is to have strength."
Those who delight in conquering others merely possess the reputation of strength.

"To conquer oneself is to be strong."
To cultivate oneself, practicing goodness and overcoming evil—
this is true strength.

"To know contentment is to be rich."
This is the Dao of humility.

"To act with determination is to have resolve."
The Dao’s precepts are most difficult;
those who attain them as immortals do so only through resolve,
not through skill or cunning.

"To not lose one’s place is to endure."
Whether in wealth or poverty, high or low station,
each must hold fast to the Dao as their duty.
Those who are sincere receive the Dao’s favor;
the poor and lowly must not despise themselves or forcibly seek wealth and rank.
Those who do not forcibly seek endure because they do not lose their place.

Another interpretation states:
When the five phases contend and injure one another,
people fall ill and die, no longer awaiting the fulfillment of their allotted span.
Now, one should harmonize the five phases,
allowing each to remain in its proper place without encroaching—
this, too, is endurance.

"To die yet not perish is to be long-lived."
The Daoist, having perfected their practice,
receives the return of the Dao’s spirits.
They evade the world by feigning death,
entering the Great Yin, reviving and departing—
thus, they do not perish and attain longevity.
The common person, lacking good deeds, is claimed by the earthly officials upon death—
thus, they perish.

"The great Dao overflows; it may be found to the left or right."
Overflowing means vast.
The Dao is most vast, abiding in softness and weakness,
not contending with the common people.
It teaches people with caution and reverence, aligning with the left;
those who are not cautious are placed to the left.

"The myriad things rely on it for life yet do not decline."
They do not decline its grace, for the Dao does not value gratitude.

"It accomplishes its work yet does not claim possession;
it clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not act as their master—
it may be called small."
The Dao does not claim merit, always calling itself small.

"The myriad things return to it yet it does not act as their master—
it may be called great."
Return means to look up to.
Since it neither demands gratitude for giving life
nor claims mastery,
the Dao alone can eternally be great.

"Thus, the sage never acts as great, and thereby accomplishes greatness."
Following the Dao, one first calls oneself small,
and only afterward can one become great.
Those who are great attain long life, equal in longevity to the Dao.

"Hold to the great image, and all under heaven will come to you."
When the ruler upholds the correct law, emulating the great Dao,
all under heaven will turn toward them,
filling the roads and inns, drawn by the wind.
The transformative power of the Dao descends from on high,
pointing to the ruler—thus, the One is honored.
There are no two lords in governance;
therefore, emperors and kings must always practice the Dao,
and only then extend it to officials and people.
It is not only Daoists who may practice it—
rulers must not abandon it.

The supreme sage-kings take the Dao as their teacher,
practicing it to the utmost to teach and transform.
When all under heaven is well-governed,
signs of great peace and auspicious omens
are all the result of accumulated human effort,
brought about by the Daoist ruler.
The middling worthy kings, though their resolve and faith are not pure,
still support and sustain governance,
able to employ the worthy and good,
assisted by ministers who guide them with the Dao.
Though their states endure,
they are not at ease;
they exhaust their energy in personal diligence.
When good ministers depart in the morning,
by evening the state is in peril—
control does not lie with the ruler but with those departing ministers.
The reason for this is that their transformation is contrary,
like water that does not flow westward.
Even with good ministers, governance is difficult to achieve.
How much more so when a multitude of wicked policies prevail,
the ruler rejects the Dao,
despises true culture,
and believes the world can long follow such ways?
When rulers abandon the enduring Dao,
the Dao, honored and divine, ultimately does not heed them—
thus, they cast aside the essence of correctness.

Omens shift and scatter, serving as warnings and instruction. When the Dao recedes and observation withdraws, chaos reaches its extreme and order must return; the intent of the Dao must be proclaimed. Thus, emperors, kings, and great ministers cannot but apply their minds with earnest care to examine it closely.

*"Excellent yet harmless."*
When rulers practice the Dao, the Dao comes and goes in accord. Rulers, too, all delight in the Dao, knowing that the divine and luminous cannot be deceived or defied. They do not fear the law but revere the celestial spirits, daring not to commit wrong or evil. Ministers are loyal and children filial—these arise from the heart’s natural sincerity. The king’s law no longer harms; corporal punishments are stored away and hidden. Thus, governance is easy, and rulers rejoice.

*"Great peace and boundless joy."*
Such governance is indeed great joy.

*"With earrings, transient guests halt."*
All celestial portents—calamities, anomalies, solar and lunar halos, double rainbows, piercing comets—are the faults brought by transgressions. When the five planets follow their paths and wandering stars do not shine, the qi of pestilence and epidemic wholly cease.

*"The Dao’s words emerge, bland and flavorless."*
The Dao’s speech reverses custom and severs artifice; among worldly people, it is utterly flavorless. Yet within this flavorlessness lies the great savor of life, so the sage savors the flavor of the flavorless.

*"Seen, it is not enough to behold; heard, it is not enough to listen; used, it cannot be exhausted."*
The Dao delights in simplicity and purity; its words leave no surplus. Gazing upon the Dao’s speech or hearing its admonitions may seem insufficient to see or hear, and thus difficult to practice. Yet those who practice and employ it find blessings and fortune inexhaustible.

*"To gather it, first surely expand it."*
Good and evil share the same rule; fortune and misfortune share the same root. What first expands must later gather.

*"To weaken it, first surely strengthen it."*
What is first strong must later weaken.

*"To abolish it, first surely establish it."*
What is first established must later decline and be abolished.

*"To seize it, first surely give it."*
What is first gained must later be seized.

*"This is called subtle illumination."*
These four matters are the four resentments and four thieves. Those who know them are subtly yet clearly enlightened. Knowing them accords with the Dao, yet people fear gathering, weakening, abolishing, and seizing. Thus, the Dao’s followers first practice gathering, weakening, abolishing, and seizing themselves, and only then do they attain good fortune. When worldly people speak of abolishing, they first seize the advantages of expansion, strength, and establishment, only to later meet with misfortune. Thus, they are admonished to know contentment and moderation, to act in the world with restraint, to consider bestowing kindness, dispersing wealth, and eliminating calamity, and to dare not seek excess. Those who uphold the Dao’s admonitions may long dwell in fortune, not misfortune. Those who cannot practice contentment will meet the opposite—this is no empty saying. Followers of the Dao dare not transgress, for they truly possess the knowledge of subtle illumination.

*"The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong."*
The Dao’s qi is subtle and weak, thus it endures and submits to nothing. Water models the Dao’s softness and weakness, thus it can wear through cliffs and stones. Dao’s followers should emulate this.

*"Fish cannot be deprived of the abyss."*
The abyss is the admonition; the Dao is like water, and people are like fish. If fish leave the abyss and water, they die. If people do not follow admonitions and guard the Dao, the Dao departs, and they perish.

*"A state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others."*
Guard your essence and do not waste it, lest your commands falter. Another explanation says: Dao’s followers would rather give to others than be given to; rather avoid others than be avoided; rather teach others to do good than be taught; rather be angered by others than anger them. In distribution, they would rather give more to others than receive more. Those who reverse this show others their sharp instruments.

*"The Dao is constantly non-action, yet nothing is not done."*
The nature of the Dao does not commit evil, thus its spirit accomplishes all. Dao’s followers should emulate this.

*"If kings and lords can guard it..."*
Though rulers are exalted, they still constantly revere the Dao and uphold its admonitions.

*"The myriad things will transform themselves."*
When rulers govern by the Dao, officials, people, and even the lowliest will all transform into followers of the Dao.

*"If transformation stirs and desires to arise, I will suppress it with the nameless uncarved block."*
Losing correctness leads to deviation; correcting deviation restores correctness. When rulers follow the Dao, the people all return to correctness. Once correctness is established and ceases, it cannot change again—if it changes, it becomes deviation. Observing its stirrings, the Dao suppresses and restrains it, checking it with the nameless uncarved block, manifesting its teachings and admonitions. Rulers, too, should emulate the Dao in suppressing and restraining it. Those who cannot will see the world wholly transformed into deviation—this is the age of later antiquity.

*"The nameless uncarved block, too, will have no desires."*
The nature of the Dao harbors no desires in the worldly realm. Rulers, too, should emulate this.

*"Without desire, in stillness, heaven and earth right themselves."*
The Dao constantly delights in desirelessness and tranquility, thus it causes heaven and earth to remain correct. Heaven and earth are the Dao’s ministers. When rulers follow the Dao and practice its admonitions, all their ministers will right themselves.
