# 长春真人西游记

**The Record of Master Zhāngchūn’s Western Journey (Yuan) by Lǐ Zhìcháng**

Master Zhāngchūn, surnamed Qiū, given name Chǔjī, courtesy name Tōngmì, a native of Jìngzhou’s Qīxiá, had not yet received his cap when he left home and became a disciple of Master Zhòngyáng. He dwelled at Pánxī and Lóngmén for thirteen years, where his true energy and perseverance matured, and his understanding of the Dao/Way was fulfilled. In his later years, he returned to the seaside.

Before the year *Wùyín*, Master was in Jìngzhou, and the officials of Hénán repeatedly sought to dispatch envoys to summon him, but matters were delayed and thus not carried out. The following year, he resided at Lái State’s Hào Tiān Guān.

In the fourth month of summer, envoys from Hénán’s borderlands came to invite him to accompany them. Master declined, and the envoys returned with his inscribed poems and verses of praise.

Later, another envoy arrived from Dà Liáng, only to depart upon learning that Shāndōng was still held by the Sòng forces.

That same year, in the eighth month, the Grand Marshal of Jiāngnán, Lǐ Gōng Quán and Péng Gōng Yìbīn, came to request his presence, but Master did not go. Afterward, invitations came from various places, and the officials of Lái State found the task difficult. Master then declared:

*"My comings and goings are determined by Heaven. It is not something that mortals like you can comprehend. There will be times when I cannot be detained—then I shall depart."*

Soon after, Chéngjìsī, the Emperor, sent his attendant Lǐu Zhònglù with a *Jīntóu* (golden) decree, its wording:

*"If I were to personally go, you may act as you see fit."*

Then, twenty Mongol envoys arrived in succession, transmitting imperial edicts urging his attendance. As Master hesitated, Zhònglù said:

*"Master’s name is renowned across the four seas. The Emperor specially commissioned me, Zhònglù, to cross mountains and oceans without limit of time, and I am determined to bring you back."*

Master replied:

*"Since the turmoil of war, boundaries shift between realms. You have braved dangers to reach me—your efforts are indeed great."*

Zhònglù said:

*"I have received the sovereign’s command and dare not withhold my utmost strength."*

In the fifth month of that year, Zhònglù received the decree in *Nuòmǎn Guó* (Naiman Country) at *Wùlǐduō*.
In the sixth month, he arrived at *Báidēng* (White Mountain) in *Wēiníng* (威宁), where he received word from the winged envoy *Chángzhēn*.
In the seventh month, he reached *Déxīng* (德兴), but the *Yùyōng* (居庸) road was obstructed, so the officials of *Yānjīng* (燕京) dispatched soldiers to escort him.
In the eighth month, he reached the capital, where the Daoist community murmured:

*"Whether Master will stay or go is uncertain."*

Passing through *Zhōngshān* (中山) and *Zhēndìng* (真定), rumors spread that Master was in *Dōnglái* (东莱). They then encountered the *Ānfù Sī* (安抚司) officials of *Yìdōu Fù* (益都府), Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán, who finally provided accurate details. They planned to send five thousand soldiers to welcome Master.

Yàn and the others said:

*"The people of Jīngdōng, hearing that the two courts are discussing peace, have grown somewhat tranquil. If we suddenly advance with troops, they will surely fortify their strongholds and resist us—Master may even flee by boat to the seaside. If you truly wish to succeed, it need not be this way."*

「Following his lead, they then conscripted volunteers and gathered twenty riders to proceed.

As they neared Yìdōu, they dispatched Wú Yàn and Jiǎng Yuán to hasten a report to their commander, Zhāng Lín. Lín sent ten thousand armored soldiers to greet them. Zhòng Lǚ laughed and said:

*"Why must we pass through here? It is only to seek an audience with the Immortal Master of Spring’s Eternal Bloom. Why do you send armored soldiers?"*

Lín then dismissed his troops, and together they entered, instructing their men to hold their reins. Along the way, they shared these words with all, and no one harbored treacherous schemes. Lín further provided them with mounted couriers.

At Wèi Zhōu, they encountered Yǐn Gōng.

In the twelfth month of winter, they arrived together at Dōnglái and conveyed the Emperor’s decree for their summons. The Master, knowing he could not decline, slowly said to Zhòng Lǚ:

*"Here, food is scarce. You and the others may first return to Yìdōu. Await my completion of the *Shàngyuán Jiào* (上元醮) ritual, and I shall send fifteen riders to meet you. On the eighteenth day, I will depart."*

Thus, the Imperial envoys and their retinue headed west toward Yìdōu, selecting nineteen disciples beforehand to await their arrival. When the appointed day came, the riders arrived, and they proceeded together.

From Wèi Yáng to Qīng Shè, the Imperial envoys had already left. Zhāng Lín reported:

*"On the seventh day of the first month, four hundred cavalrymen appeared at Línqí, causing great alarm among the Qīng citizens. The envoys intercepted and halted them, but they have yet to be heard from."*

The Master then passed through Chángshān and Zōu Píng, reaching Jì Yáng in early February. The commoners and officials offered incense and bows to welcome him at the southern gate of the town, while the Daoist disciples led the procession in advance. They were fed at the Yǎngsù Ān (养素庵).

The gathered crowd declared:

*"Last month, on the eighteenth day, over ten cranes came from the northwest, soaring and calling among the clouds before flying southeast. The next day, at the hour of Chén and Sì, more cranes arrived from the southwest, followed by hundreds and thousands. Some perched, some hovered, flitting around the roof of the hall before departing. Now we understand: whenever cranes appeared, it marked the day the Master set out."*

All raised their hands to their foreheads in reverence.

After several days, in the early part of February, the Imperial envoys sent mounted couriers with word:

*"We have stationed troops at Jiānglíng and moored boats to await you."*

The Master departed the next day. On the thirteenth day, the Imperial envoys arrived with their army to escort him. The Master asked:

*"Why have you come so late?"*

They replied:

*"The roads were obstructed. We went to Yànjīng to assemble troops, preparing the east for Xīn’ān and the west for Chángshān. Zhòng Lǚ personally led the army to seize Shēnzhōu and conquer Xià Wǔyìng to clear the path, built bridges over the Hùtú, and gathered boats at Jiānglíng—this is why we were delayed."*

The Master said:

*"This task could only be accomplished by you."*

The following day, they crossed the Hùtú and headed north. On the twenty-second day, they reached Lúgōu, where officials, commoners, monks, and Daoists came to greet them along the road.

That day, they entered through the Lìzé Gate, with Daoists arrayed in solemn rites chanting before them. The *Xíngshěng* official Shílù Gōng hosted the Master at the Yùxū Guàn (玉虚观), and from then on, those seeking blessings or inscriptions filled his doorstep.

Wherever the Master’s retinue passed, Daoist disciples invoked his name to shield the people from military calamities, often averting the misfortune of conscription. The Master’s influence and teachings reached people in such a manner.

The *Xuānfù* official Wáng Jùchuān composed a poem on his boat, and the Master responded:

*"Banners flutter, horses neigh in the north,
Gazing eastward toward Yàn’s crossing of the stone bridge.
Ten thousand miles beyond the desert’s sands,
Three springs suddenly parted from the distant seas.

Kindred friends depart the frontier, returning like geese,
Tattered hats endure frost, yet fur coats mend.
Since leaving the Western Shù in the days of yore,
None like the summons to the Northern Court."*

The Master heard that the Imperial retinue was moving westward, and as the seasons grew late, he grew weary of wind and frost, wishing to wait until their return to pay homage at court. Meanwhile, Zhòng Lǚ intended to bring selected young women along, and the Master hesitated, saying:

*"The people of Qí offered women and music—Confucius left Rú.
Though I dwell in the mountains, how could I travel with young women?"*

Zhòng Lǚ then ordered *Hèlā* to hasten and report, while the Master also sent someone with a formal petition.

One day, someone requested an inscription on Yán Lìběn’s *Tàishàng Guòguān Tú* (太上过关图), which reads:

*"In the west of Shù Province, when parting from Hán’s Pass,
The barbarians bowed in reverence—
The Great Dao once more laid its foundations."*

He also showed two *gāthā* (偈) to the assembly. The first reads:

*"Chaos at dawn, chaos at dusk,
Lightness and wildness from ancient times to now.
Empty blossoms, empty stillness in thought—
A heart that is both present and absent."*

The second reads:

*"Emotions stir with resolute force,
The Dao alone remains unyielding.
Endure insults to tame the wild horses,
Serene and unhurried through the years.
In early April, the crowd urged him to perform a *Jiào* (醮) ritual on the fifteenth day. The Master declined, saying:

*"Now, the war has not yet ceased. Many displaced souls have the fortune to glimpse the True Person and receive the blessings of the Dao. But the dead linger in endless night, unrelieved by offerings or salvation—there is no little regret among them."*

The Master agreed.

At the time, a great drought prevailed. On the fourteenth day, after the ritual began, heavy rain fell. The crowd feared the ceremony might be disrupted, but by midday, when the Master arrived at the altar to perform the rites, the skies cleared.

The crowd rejoiced and sighed:

*"Rain and clear skies follow human desire—
Could one of such virtue and profundity move Heaven and Earth so effortlessly?"*

The next day, the Master ascended the Yuǎnbǎo Hall (元宝堂) to deliver teachings.

At that moment, several cranes flew in from the northwest, and all gazed upward. As the ritual papers were burned, one sheet ascended into the sky and vanished, while five cranes circled and danced above it. The scholars and officials all said:

*"The Master’s utmost sincerity stirs Heaven and Earth."*

The aged Daoist of Nántáng, Zhāng Tiāndù’s son Zhāng Zhen, composed an ode praising the event; all the officials also wrote poems.

When the ritual concluded, the Imperial envoy Liú Gōng accompanied the Master northward. Passing through Jūyōng, they encountered bandits at night to its north, who all knelt and withdrew in respect, saying:

*"Do not alarm our father-teacher."*

In May, the Master arrived at the Lóngyáng Guàn (龙阳观) in Déxīng to spend the summer, sending a poem to the officials of Yànjīng:

*"Ascending the Dao—where is it found in the wandering of the Spirit-boat?
South, north, east, west all hold their own joys.
The emerald heights, where clouds and peaks meet, display Heaven’s grandeur,
The azure waves, where mist and markets rise, mark the rain’s path to the shore."*

「The Spirit-boat sails through the Eight Extremes, though the void seems distant,
The Dao aligns with the Three Pure Ones—its path is never amiss.
Even crossing the Weak Waters thirty times ten thousand,
In a moment, one ascends to the realm of the Immortals.

At that time, in the capital, my Daoist descendants—
Sun Zhōu (周楚卿), Yáng Biāo (杨彪仲文), Shī Yì (师谞才卿),
Lǐ Shì (李士谦子进), Liú Zhōngyòng (刘中用之),
Chén Shí (陈时可秀玉), Wú Zhāng (吴章德明),
Zhào Zhōnglì (赵中立正卿), Wáng Ruì (王锐威卿),
Zhào Fǎng (赵昉德辉), and Sūn Xǐ (孙锡天锡)—
these virtuous gentlemen were those with whom the Master conversed and exchanged verses
while residing in Yùxū (玉虚).
Wáng Fèng (王觏逢辰) and Wáng Zhí (王直哉清甫) also joined him in his wanderings.

The observatory stood on the sunlit slopes of the mountain,
where many caves and palaces abounded,
and where practitioners of the Dao/Way often dwelled.
The Master thus led his disciples to explore them.

Upon first entering the gorge, he composed a poem:
*"A Daoist’s leisurely journey here is doubly delightful,
With peaks and ridges arrayed like spears and shields in battle.
Though Penglái’s realm remains beyond reach,
The grottoes already reveal the homes of the Daoists.
The pine towers sway in autumn rain and dew,
The stone pavilions gleam in evening clouds and mists.
Reflecting now on my former words about Zhōngnán’s lands,
I wake from dreams—no end to the Western Mountains’ reach."*

The place was refreshing and elevated,
its grandeur sloping toward the southeast,
where a single gaze could span over three hundred *lǐ*.
To the east of the observatory, several *lǐ* away,
a spring welled up from the plain, its coolness most pleasing.

The Master traversed these lands often,
and wrote another poem:
*"At midday, I walk with the wind to the observatory,
Gazing far upon the mountains, lost in a sea of clouds.
While households endure scorching summer heat,
A single breeze of cold spring water clears to the bone.
In the north, travelers sometimes trust in omens,
But here on the Eastern Mound, they play without contention—
(Plowmen and shepherds yield their shade beneath the embankment.)
After bathing by the stream and sitting in the forest,
I loosen my hair, open my robe, and expound on the Dao/Way’s truths."*

On the Mid-Autumn Festival,
the observatory held its ritual.
At midday, talismans were transmitted and precepts conferred,
and the elderly and young alike suffered from the intense heat,
all lamenting their discomfort.

In a short while, clouds gathered above,
shaped like a round canopy,
and lingered for some time without dispersing.
The crowd rejoiced, leaping in praise.

Again, the well water sufficed for hundreds,
but now over a thousand drew from it,
and those in charge sought alternative sources.
For three days, they dug elsewhere,
yet the well’s spring suddenly overflowed,
its supply inexhaustible—
these were all auspicious karmic blessings and Heaven’s aid.

After the ritual, he inscribed a poem:
*"The Great Sage’s boundless compassion saves all living beings,
Their offerings of virtue made through the sacred scriptures.
The Three Fields protect the spirit and vital *qi*,
All phenomena bow in reverence to the sun, moon, and stars.
Though my mortal flesh still harbors imperfections,
I cannot evade the teachings that lead to the formless.
I follow the North Dipper’s ritual fasts (both the South and North Dippers instruct the rites of abstinence),
Gradually ascending to the Southern Palace’s Fire-Refining Court.
By the eighth month, in response to the Imperial Envoy of Xuāndé Prefecture,
General Móliè (移剌公) who summoned me,
I thus took up residence in the Cháoyuán Guàn (朝元观).

On the Mid-Autumn night, there were two congratulatory Daoist hymns.
The first:
*"The clouds dissolve into their peaks,
The vast sky congeals its jade—
The precious mirror now shines full.
The Great Radiance, its brilliance spanning endless deserts,
Extends beyond the Western Heaven.
Here in the mortal world, dreams and spirits are intoxicated,
Feasting at a grand, adorned banquet.
The Daoist’s gate is another vessel of purity,
Silently awakening the field of enlightenment within."*

The second:
*"In the depths of the Celestial Caverns,
Fine companions gather in high assembly,
Their unbounded leisure knows no end.
Ascending to the Upper Celestial Realm,
They fly to the Broad Cold Palace,
Casually tossing down gold coins.
The Spirit-boat glows resplendently,
Chasing away the demon of sleep—
The jade hare dances with grace.
Sitting in forgetfulness, they perceive the original truth,
Letting the *dharma*-realm revolve as it will.
Afterward, the autumn air grew clear and serene,
And the quiet night was peaceful.

He then composed two *jué* (绝句) verses:
*"The Milky Way stretches vast and deep through the night,
Silent and lonely, my cold window holds countless thoughts.
The world’s strife and discord never reach this place,
And in tranquil stillness, the Daoist’s heart finds ease."*

The second:
*"The night is deep and cool as the moon ascends,
Mountains and rivers, earth and sky, all vanish without trace.
Only the Dao/Way and virtue remain, their essence undimmed,
Spanning the Three Heavens, ten thousand *lǐ* in reach.
The Cháoyuán Guàn stands at the prefecture’s dry corner,
Its merit-holder, General Móliè (移剌公),
desiring the Master’s northern journey,
built halls and palaces anew,
enshrined the honored image,
and refreshed all the cloud chambers and grottoes.
In the tenth month, as the mural of the Patriarch was being painted,
the artist, chilled by the cold,
was about to halt his work.
The Master forbade it, saying:
*'Zhōu Lǜ (邹律) could yet turn the spring—
How much more so the Sage’s shade, which lends support!'*
That month, indeed, the weather turned mild as spring,
with no wind or sand,
so the artist completed his task.
There was a poem:
*'Late spring in the borderlands, though harsh, shares the same cold;
Flying stones and whirling sands stir great winds.
Migratory geese, their wings drooping, hurry southward,
Travelers weary, their northward journey endless.
When I arrived in the tenth month, frost was still thin,
And men marveled that streams flowed through the thousand peaks.
Had it not been for the gentle warmth of the small spring,
Heaven would not have fulfilled the mural’s completion.*

Soon after, Ālǐ Xiān (阿里鲜) came from the camp of the Great Khan,
Yùwēn Dàwáng (斡辰大王),
sent an envoy to request the Master’s presence.
Then, the Imperial Pacifier, Wáng Jùchān (王公巨川),
also arrived, saying:
*'By the Great Khan’s decree:
If the Master travels westward,
he may pass through my lands.'*
The Master assented.

That month, as he journeyed northward toward Wàngshān,
Héliè (曷剌) submitted a memorial requesting his return,
and there was an edict:
*'By the decree of the Great Khan, Chéngjísī (成吉思) Emperor,
to the True Person, Master Qiū (丘师).
It further states:
Only the Master’s Dao surpasses the Three Sages,
His virtue is profound and manifold.
Its final words:
*"The Cloud Pavilion was launched from Penglái,
The Crane Chariot may wander in Indra’s realm.
Dàmó (达磨) marched eastward,
Transmitting the seal of the Original Mind;
Lǎozǐ (老氏) journeyed westward,
Sometimes transforming into the Barbarian to attain the Dao/Way.
Though the river’s path is wide,
Gazing upon the few steps and staff, it seems no distance at all.
Now, in response to your letter,
I make clear my intention."*

In autumn’s heat, the Master was in better health than usual.
Though his age spared him much exertion,
his esteem was so great.

The Great Khan again decreed to Liú Zhōnglù (刘仲禄):
*"Do not let the True Person suffer hunger or toil,
But support him gently on his journey home."*

The Master conferred with the Imperial Envoy, saying:
*"The cold has already set in,
And the sandy roads stretch far.
What the Daoists require for their journey is not yet prepared—
We should return to Lóngyáng,
And depart in the spring."*

The Imperial Envoy complied with his words. On the eighteenth day, he journeyed south to Lóngyáng.

Along the Daoist path, friends bid farewell, many weeping in tears.

The Master composed a poem to show the assembly:
*"Temporary parting in life is still bearable,
But enduring separation after death is unbearable.
The world’s disputes unsettle the heart,
While the Wheel of Rebirth and suffering’s bitterness are hard to accept."*

The following day, he arrived at the Lóngyáng observatory to spend the winter.

On the fourteenth day of the eleventh month, he went to the Lóngyán Temple (龍岩寺) to fast, and inscribed a poem on the western veranda of the hall:

*"With staff in hand, I seek the mountain recluse,
Yet empty waters stretch deep, pale and colorless.
Last night, snowflakes filled the rocky peaks,
Today, the mountain’s light mirrors the sky’s whiteness.
The heavens are high, the earth’s wind pure and clear,
My spirit wanders the Eight Extremes, rising in boundless luminosity.
I wish to depict the mountain recluse’s true visage,
But the Daoist’s task is beyond mortal naming."*

In the twelfth month, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng (燕京):

*"This journey is truly arduous,
This farewell must be long spoken.
Northward, I cross the Wild Fox Ridge,
Westward, I reach the Heavenly Horse Land.
The Yīn Mountains lack the Sea of Ships,
White grasses mark the battlefield’s sand.
I lament my lack of sagehood—
How could I compare to those who traverse the Great Wilderness?
He also wrote:
If the capital has poems to mark my departure,
Send them early to Lóngyáng before I cross the pass.
In days of old, some parted with shoes on the bed,
Now, none dream of bidding farewell with staff in hand.
Again, he sent a poem to his Daoist friends in Yànjīng:
Ten years of war and fire, the people’s grief is endless,
A thousand among ten thousand survive.
Last year, I was spared by the Emperor’s gracious decree,
This spring, I must endure the cold and journey.
I do not shun the three thousand northern leagues (the Emperor’s former domain),
Yet I still remember the two hundred eastern states.
In desperate straits, my breath is but a lingering sigh,
Early grant my life and fate relief from sorrow."*

On the eighth day of the second month of the Xīnwèi (辛巳) year, he set out, the weather clear and settled. Daoist friends saw him off in the western suburbs, blocking his horse’s head and weeping:

*"Our Master departs to the distant ten thousand leagues—
When shall we again have the chance to pay our respects?"*

The Master replied:
*"If your resolve in the Dao is firm and unyielding,
You will meet me again someday."*

The assembly wept once more and pleaded:
*"When, then, shall we meet?"*

The Master said:
*"My journey’s progress is not within mortal control,
And crossing distant lands is fraught with uncertainty—
Whether my Dao will align or not, I cannot say for certain."*

The assembly said:
*"Our Master surely knows—
We beg you to inform your disciples."*

Unable to refuse, he spoke again:
*"Three years to return, three years to return."*

On the tenth day, he rested at the Qí Gāng (翠帡) pass.

The next day, he crossed the Wild Fox Ridge to the north,
Ascended a height and gazed southward,
Surveying the Tàiháng (太行) Mountains—
The misty peaks were lovely in the clear weather,
But to the north, only desolate sand and withered grass remained.
From here, the winds of the Central Plains were forever cut off.

The Daoist’s heart knows no bounds—
Song Défāng (宋德芳) and others pointed to the battlefield’s white bones,
Saying:
*"When I return,
I will offer them the Golden Talisman (金箓),
For this too is part of my northern journey’s karmic ties."*

Passing through Fǔzhōu (抚州) to the north,
On the fifteenth day, he traveled northeast across the Gàilì (盖里) marshes,
Through endless salt flats and barren lands,
Before spotting the faintest signs of human habitation—
Twenty or so households.
To the south, there were salt pools,
Stretching northeast in a winding line.
From here, there were no rivers,
And water was drawn from dug sand-wells.
For thousands of leagues north and south,
There were no towering mountains,
And a horse could travel five days before reaching the border of Míngchāng (明昌).
He composed a poem to record the journey:

*"The slopes fold and twist, the road winding in circles,
Salt fields and stagnant waters mark every turn.
For days, I meet no travelers,
Yet after years, horses still return.
The earth bears no trees, only wild grasses,
The heavens shape low hills, hiding great mountains.
No grains grow, but milk and cheese sustain,
And furs or felt tents bring joy to the eye."*

He traveled another six or seven days,
Suddenly entering the Great Sand Dunes (大沙陀).
There, the dunes had stunted willows,
The largest wide enough to encircle with one’s arms.
Beyond a thousand leagues to the northeast,
Where the sands ended, no trees grew at all.

On the first day of the third month,
He left the Great Sand Dunes,
Reaching Yú’ér (鱼儿) marshes,
Where human settlements clustered together,
Mostly living by tilling fields or fishing.
It was already Qīngmíng (清明),
The spring hues faint and lingering,
The ice still frozen and unmelted.

He composed a poem:
*"The northern lands have always been bitterly cold,
Yet the Great Sand Dunes still hold ice in the third month.
Seek the Yellow Crane among the recluse scholars,
Recognize the Kite’s transformation into the Great Eagle.
Sū Wǔ’s northern exile filled him with despair,
Lǐ Líng’s southern gaze found no reliance.
Now I return to study Lú Yào’s lofty resolve,
And exhaustively observe the highest teachings."*

On the fifth day of the third month,
He departed northeastward,
Where human settlements stretched far in every direction,
All with black carts and white tents,
Following the water and grass for grazing.
Across the plains and marshes,
Not a single tree remained—
Only yellow clouds and white grasses as far as the eye could see.

He did not stray from his path,
And after twenty more days,
He finally reached a Sand River (沙河),
Flowing northwest into the Lùjú (陆局) River.
The water barely reached a horse’s belly,
And reeds and thickets of willows grew along its banks.
Crossing the river and traveling north for three days,
He entered the Small Sand Dunes (小沙陀).

On the first day of the fourth month,
He arrived beneath the Great Khan’s tent at Wòchén (斡辰).
The ice had just begun to thaw,
And the grass showed the faintest signs of life.
There was a wedding celebration,
And within five hundred leagues,
Leaders sent horses and wagons to assist.
Black carts and white tents formed lines numbering thousands.

On the seventh day,
He met the Great Khan,
Who inquired about prolonging life.
The Master said it required fasting and discipline before such teachings could be heard,
And agreed to impart them on the next full moon.

On that day,
A great snowstorm arose—
And it ceased.
The Great Khan said:
*"The Emperor sent an envoy ten thousand leagues,
Seeking your Daoist wisdom.
How dare I presume to ask first?
Moreover, he instructed Alìxiān (阿里鲜),
‘When you have seen the Master, return eastward,
And ensure he passes through here.’"*

On the seventeenth day,
The Great Khan sent a hundred head of cattle and horses,
And ten carts to escort the Master on his way.
The Master rode northwest,
And on the twenty-second day,
He reached the Lùjú (陆局) River,
Where the accumulated waters formed a vast sea,
Stretching hundreds of leagues around.
The winds churned waves that cast up great fish,
Which the Mongols caught in numbers.

Traveling along the river’s southern bank westward,
They sometimes found wild scallions to eat.

On the first day of the Fifth Month at noon,
There was a solar eclipse—
When it ended, the stars reappeared,
And in moments, the light returned.
At that time, they were on the southern bank of the river
(The eclipse began in the southwest, ending in the northeast).

The land was cool in the mornings and hot in the evenings,
With grass abundant in yellow flowers.
The river flowed northeast,
Its banks lined with tall willows,
Which the Mongols felled to build their tents.

After sixteen days of travel,
The river’s course bent around the northwest mountains,
Its source beyond reach.
They camped southwest along the postal road,
Where the Mongols rejoiced:
*"Last year, we heard our elders speak of your coming."*
They presented five *dou* of millet,
And the Master repaid them with a *dou* of dates.
They delighted, saying,
*"We have never seen such things!"*
Then they danced in thanks and departed.

After another ten days,
The summer solstice arrived.
They measured shadows—
Three *chi*, six or seven *cun*—
And looming mountains grew ever sharper.
From there westward, hills and mounds multiplied,
And settlements thickened,
Their dwellings all of black carts and white tents.

Their customs were pastoral and hunting,
Their clothing of leather and fur,
Their diet of meat and curdled milk.

Men bound their hair, letting it hang to their ears,
While women wore hats of birchbark—
Two *chi* high—
Often wrapped in dark hemp,
The wealthy in red silk,
Their ends shaped like geese or ducks,
Called *gugu*.
They strictly forbade others to touch them,
And entering or leaving their tents required bowing.

They kept no written records,
Relying on spoken agreements or carved wooden tokens.
When food was shared, all partook;
In disputes, they rushed to aid;
When summoned, they did not refuse;
When spoken to, they did not contradict—
A remnant of ancient virtue.

In verse, they described their land thus:

*"Gazing far, mountains and rivers stretch without end,
Mists and winds unbroken, waters flowing long.
How did the Creator shape heaven and earth?
Here, one lets horses and oxen roam free.
Drinking blood, eating raw meat—
Like the ancients of old,
Their towering caps and bound hair
Differ from the Central Plains.
No sages could spread their culture here,
Through the ages, only freedom reigns."*

The journey continued four more stages. To the northwest, crossing the river, they reached a vast plain, its surrounding mountains and streams all splendid and graceful. To the east and west stood ancient cities, their foundations as if newly laid, their streets and alleys clearly marked, their architecture resembling that of the Central Plains.

No inscribed records of the years remained to verify their age, though some said they were built by the Khitans. Later, ancient tiles were found buried in the earth, bearing Khitan script—evidently cities established by those Khitan warriors who refused to surrender after the fall of Liao and retreated westward.

It was also said: "To the southwest, at the city of Xúnsīgàn, a thousand leagues away, lies the finest region of the Uyghur land, where the Khitans once established their capital, spanning seven generations."

On the thirteenth day of the sixth month, they camped behind the Chángsōng Ridge, where towering pine trees stood dense and lofty, their branches stretching toward the heavens and blotting out the sun. Most grew in mountain shadows and ravines, while those on sunlit slopes were few.

On the fourteenth day, they passed through a mountain and crossed a shallow river, the air piercingly cold—even the strongest could barely endure.

That evening, they camped on level ground. On the fifteenth day, at dawn, their tents were encircled by thin ice. Three frosts had fallen, the river’s current sluggish, its chill like the depths of winter.

The locals remarked: *"Even in the fifth and sixth months, snow often falls annually. This year, we are fortunate for the clear, warm weather."*

The expedition renamed the ridge **Dàhán Ridge**—for whenever rain came, it brought hail, and the mountain paths twisted like serpents. To the northwest, after another hundred leagues, they again turned northwest before finally reaching flat terrain. There, a **Stone River** ran for over fifty leagues, its banks towering a dozen zhang high, its waters crystal-clear and inviting, its sound like chiming jade.

Between the sheer cliffs, giant leeks grew three to four feet tall, and upon the ravine’s edge stood pines, each a dozen zhang in height. The western mountains stretched endlessly, their tall pines clustering thickly.

After five or six days of mountain travel, the peaks curved and the paths wound, while forests and ridges grew ever more lush. Beneath them, streams poured down. The plains were a mix of pine and birch, as if inhabited by people.

They then ascended a towering ridge, its grandeur like a vast rainbow, its cliffs rising a thousand ren high. Gazing down, they saw a deep lake—so vast it seemed to swallow men whole.

On the twenty-eighth day, they anchored east of **Wōlǐduō**, where the **Propagator** (宣抚) submitted a memorial to the **Empress Dowager** (皇后), requesting the expedition’s permission to cross the river by decree. The river flowed northeast, its waters spreading wide and deep, its current impassable—yet they forded it.

Entering the camp, their carriages halted on the southern bank. The encampment stretched for thousands of tents, their supplies of fermented mare’s milk and curdled yogurt. The **Princesses of the Han and Xia** (汉、夏公主) sent winter provisions and food, including millet and white gold (silver) by the measure of ten taels per bushel. Fifty taels could be exchanged for eighty jin of flour—a flour that came from beyond the **Yīnshān Mountains**, carried by **Western merchant camels** (西域贾胡) from two thousand leagues away.

Within their tents, no flies were found. **Wōlǐduō** (窝里朵) was a **palace on wheels** (行宫) in the Han tongue, its pavilions and banners standing proud—even the ancient **Great Chanyu** (大单于) had never seen such splendor.

On the ninth day of the seventh month, they traveled southwest with the **Propagator’s envoy** (宣使) for five or six days. Often, they saw snow atop the mountains, and tombs scattered below. Upon reaching the **High Mound** (高陵), they found traces of ancestral worship.

After another three days, they passed a mountain—its peak sheer as a blade, its pines and firs dense and thriving. There lay a lake, and beyond it, a great gorge opened to the south, where a river flowed westward. On its sunlit banks, thickets of mixed wood cast dappled shade, while wild chives grew lush as fragrant grass, lining the path for dozens of leagues.

The northern region boasts the ancient city of **Hé lāxiāo** (曷剌肖). Southwestward, they crossed a sandy battlefield twenty *li* (里) or so, where water and grass were exceedingly sparse. Only then did they first encounter the **Uyghur** (回纥) diverting irrigation channels to flood their wheat fields.

After another five or six days, they crossed the ridge and headed south, reaching the **Mongol camp** (蒙古营), where they lodged in a **felt tent** (拂庐).

At dawn, they followed the winding southern mountains, whose peaks were capped with snow. The master composed a verse to record their journey:

*"At that time, the **Venerable Master Xuánzàng** (悉达悟空) set out from **Yànzǐchéng** (燕子城, i.e., **Fǔzhōu** 抚州),
His heart stirred as he first arrived in this land.
Northward, he crossed the Great River for three months’ march (the **Lùjú River** 陆局河, which he reached in full by the fourth month—some two thousand *li* in length),
And westward, he faced endless snow for half a year’s journey (this very place, where the mountains ever bear snow,
Stretching eastward to the Lùjú River, roughly five thousand *li*—and he reached it in full by the seventh month).
Unable to employ the **Daoist technique of riding the wind and vanishing** (回风隐地), he instead traversed the heavens daily.
When he reached the place where the mountains ended and the waters ceased,
The slanted sun still tilted westward as before.

A postal courier informed them: *"Beyond this northern snow range lies **Tiánzhèn Hǎi** (田镇海), known as **Bā lā hēsūn** (八剌喝孙).*
*Bā lā hēsūn is a city in the Han tongue. Within it stands a granary, hence its other name, **Cāngtóu** (仓头).*

On the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month, Han artisans and craftsmen arrived in a steady stream to greet them,
All joyously shouting and bowing in welcome, leading the way with **colorful banners** (彩幡),
**ornate pavilions** (华盖), and **fragrant flowers** (香花).

There also came the **two consorts of Emperor Zhāngzōng** (章宗二妃)—one, the **Túshàn clan** (徒单氏), the other, the **Jiágǔ clan** (夹谷氏)—
As well as the mother of the **Han Princess**, the **Venerable Lady Qīnsè** (钦圣夫人), of the **Yuàn clan** (袁氏),
Who wept as they came to meet them. Turning to the master, she said:
*"Long ago, I heard of your **lofty Daoist virtue and noble reputation** (道德高风),
Yet regretted never having seen you in person. Who would have thought that here, in this place, we would have such a meeting?"*

The next day, **Zhèn Hǎi Bā lāhēsūn** (镇海八剌喝孙, i.e., **Tianzhenhai**) came to pay respects.
The master spoke to him: *"My years are many, and by the **imperial decrees** (二诏) of the emperor,
I could not refuse this distant journey of thousands of *li*.
Now, at last, I stand before your domain."*

The sands of the desert abound with those who do not till the fields,
Yet rejoice to see this land’s autumn harvest already ripe.

I wish to spend the winter here,
Awaiting the return of the imperial procession—what say you?

The **宣使** replied: *"Since the master has given his decree,
I dare not oppose or assent. Only Tianzhenhai can decide this."*

The **相公** said: *"Recently, there was an imperial edict commanding all officials,
That if they encounter a **true person** (真人) passing through,
They must not delay his journey—clearly, the emperor wishes to see him swiftly.
If the master insists on staying here,
The fault shall lie with Tianzhenhai. I would rather accompany you in person.
Whatever the master requires, how could I dare fail to provide?"*

The master said: *"Given these circumstances,
We shall depart on the tenth day."*

The **相公** said: *"Ahead lies a towering mountain and vast marshes,
Not suitable for carts. It would be best to reduce the carriages and proceed with light cavalry."*

Following his advice, the master left nine disciples, including **Song Dao’an** (宋道安),
And chose a site to establish an **observatory** (观).
People came without summons—
The strong offered their labor, artisans their craft, the wealthy their wealth.
The **sacred hall** (圣堂) and its **courtyard** (方丈),
The eastern kitchen and western veranda, as well as the **cloud rooms** (云房, *unroofed, built of earth and wood*)
Were completed in less than a month. A plaque read: **Qixia Observatory** (栖霞观).
At the time, the **millet and wheat** (稷黍) were still in the fields,
But frost descended in early August, hastening the harvest of barley.

A great wind came from the northwest of the mountain,
Swirling yellow sands that obscured the sky, rendering all forms indistinct.
The master composed a verse to lament his fate:

*"I am a man of the East, West, South, and North,
Who has long strayed from the Dao, lost in dust and strife.
My white hair sags with age I can no longer bear,
Yet again I tread the yellow sands on distant journeys.
Before death, let me gaze upon the world—
In my remaining life, I find no joy in heaven’s purity.
The four mountains and five peaks I’ve traversed many times,
Through the Eight Expanse’s (八表) boundless flight, I’ve entered the realm of the divine.
The tenth day, I took my disciple **Xu Jing** (虚静, *Master Xu*) **Zhao Jiugu** (赵九古) and others,
A dozen or so, with two carriages.
Twenty-odd Mongol **postal couriers** (驿骑) accompanied us westward along the mountain,
While **宣使** Liu and **相公** Tianzhenhai led a hundred cavalry.

**Li Jiānánu** (李家奴), a follower of Tianzhenhai,
Said: *"Earlier, below this mountain, a spirit cut off my hair from behind.
I was greatly afraid."*

Tianzhenhai also said: *"Even the **Mangguo king** (满国王) was once deceived here by mountain spirits,
Offered fine food by them."*

The master remained silent, giving no answer.

After traveling southwest for three days,
We turned eastward, crossing the mountain and the great gorge.
On the **Mid-Autumn Festival** (中秋), we reached the northeast of **Jinshan** (金山),
Stopped briefly, then continued southward.
The mountain was vast and lofty,
With deep valleys and long slopes—
Carts could not pass.
The **Third Prince** (三太子) had once led an army,
And only then was the path cleared.
Now, the master ordered the hundred cavalry to pull the ropes,
Hauling the carriages upward.

After traveling four stages,
We crossed five ridges (五岭) and emerged from the mountain’s southern foothills,
Halting by the river to make camp.
The officials pitched their tents in a continuous line,
And, finding water and grass suitable,
Awaited the arrival of the **postal couriers** (铺牛驿骑) and their horses.
After several days, we resumed our journey.

Three more verses were composed:

*"The cool breeze of August brings refreshing clarity,
Yet how could I endure the evening’s azure sky?
I wish to chant my sorrow, but find no talent—
Only the golden moon above Jin Mountain gleams in vain."*

*"On Jin Mountain’s southern face, the great river flows,
Its winding curves offering a feast for the autumn’s pure beauty.
As evening falls and the moon ascends,
I sing alone beneath the radiant night sky."*

*"Though Jin Mountain is grand, it does not stand alone in height,
Its slopes stretch far, like chains binding the earth.
Across its heart, the sky and mountain are severed by trees,
Reaching for the clouds, they block the sun—
A deafening, wild cry."*

As we crossed the river to the south,
We passed a small mountain with **five-colored stones** (五色石).
Beside it, no grass or trees grew,
And its length from head to tail spanned seventy *li*.

The road ahead was blocked by two red mountains, another thirty *li* distant.
Within the saline earth, there stood a small sandy well, where we halted to draw water for sustenance.
Nearby, patches of green grass thrived—
Yet they were trampled bare by the horses’ hooves.

The envoy and the Prefect of Zhenghai conferred:
*"This is the most treacherous stretch. How shall we proceed, my lord?"*
The Prefect replied:
*"I have long known this land.
Together, let us consult the master."* The Prefect said:
*"Ahead lies the White Bones Plain—
A stretch of black stone, two hundred *li* long,
Where the northern border of the Shato begins.
There, water and grass may yet be found.
Beyond that, the Great Shato stretches a hundred *li* east and west—
Its breadth unknown, perhaps thousands of *li*.
Only at the Huixia city shall we find water and grass."*

The master asked: *"What is the White Bones Plain?"*
The Prefect answered:
*"An ancient battlefield. Exhausted soldiers who reached it—
Ten perished for every one who returned.
A deathly place.
Even the mighty Manchu forces were once defeated here.
When the sun is high, men and beasts alike perish from exhaustion.
Only by traveling at night, half the journey may be endured.
By midday tomorrow, we shall find water and grass.
Rest briefly, then depart at dusk.
We must cross a sandy ridge a hundred *li* long—
Like a ship tossed upon monstrous waves.
By dawn the next day, we shall reach the city."*

*"Night travel is best, yet fear the gloom—
Demons and spirits may plague us.
We must smear blood upon the horses’ manes to ward them off."*

The master laughed:
*"Evil spirits and demons flee righteous men—
As the classics attest, who does not know this?
Why should a Daoist fear such things?"*

At dusk, we set out.
The oxen faltered, so we abandoned them,
Driving instead with six horses—
Never again to use oxen.

To the south, beyond the Shato’s northern edge,
The horizon glowed like silver mist.
We asked our companions, but none knew its name.
The master said: *"That is the Yinshan Range."*

The next day, after passing the Shato,
We met woodcutters and asked again—
*"Indeed,"* they confirmed.

Thus, along the way, I composed:

*"Towering like clouds, white as sand,
How could one know it was but an illusion?
Gradually, its peaks gleamed like crushed jade,
Its slopes cast silver rays upon the earth.
A single stroke, a thousand *li* long,
Illuminating cities and ten thousand homes.
From ancient times to now, it shall not fade—
I sing its praise and point due south."*

On the twenty-seventh day of the eighth month,
We reached the Yinshan’s rear,
Where the Huixia welcomed us at the outskirts.
At the northern gate of the small city,
The chieftain offered grape wine, exotic fruits,
Large flatbreads, and wild onions.
He tore a strip of Persian cloth a *chi* wide
And said:
*"This is the Andzhou, three hundred *li* before the Yinshan.
The land is scorching, and grapes grow in abundance."*

The next day, we traveled west along the river,
Passing through two small cities, each with inhabitants.
The grain and barley were newly harvested,
Dependent on spring water for irrigation—
A rare autumn, for the rains had been scarce.

To the west lay the great city of Bieshi Ma,
Where officials, commoners, monks, Daoists, and priests—
Hundreds in number—met us with solemn ceremony.
The monks wore saffron robes,
While the Daoist priests’ attire differed strangely from China’s.

We lodged in the upper pavilion of a grape garden
West of the city.
The Huixia king’s clan urged us to drink grape wine,
Offering rare flowers, exotic fruits, and fine incense,
Along with dwarves performing music and dance—
All of them men from the Central Plains.

The officials and commoners grew ever more respectful,
And as we sat together—monks, Daoists, and scholars—
We inquired about their customs.

They replied:
*"This was once the Northern Court of the Great Tang,
When, in the second year of Jinglong,
Yang Gong served as Grand Protector.
His virtuous governance won the hearts of all the tribes,
And his blessings endure to this day.
Here stand the stone carvings of Longxing and Xisi temples,
Their merits still vivid.
The temple houses a collection of Buddhist scriptures.
Even now, Tang-era frontier cities remain.
To the east, a few hundred *li* away, lies the prefecture of Xiliang.
To the west, three hundred *li* beyond, is the county of Luntai."*

The master asked:
*"How many more days’ journey to the capital?"*
They answered:
*"West-southwest, another ten thousand *li* to the seat of government."*

That night, wind and rain arose. Outside the garden stood a great tree, and the master again emerged to recite a poem for all:

*"Beneath the Yinshan pass, the mountain night is silent and vast.
The endless sky grows dark with clouds,
The great tree’s leaves rustle in the cold wind.
Ten thousand *li* of distant road,
Three winters of gentle climate.
I cast aside all worldly burdens,
And let myself drift with the broken sail."*

On the second day of the ninth month, we set out westward.
By the fourth day, we lodged east of Luntai, where the local chieftains came to greet us.
Gazing south at Yinshan, its three jagged peaks rise stark against the heavens.

The master then recounted his poem and gave it to the scholar Li Boqiang, who was present.
The poem reads:

*"Three peaks ascend, piercing the cold clouds,
Four walls stretch out, winding around the ravine.
The Snow Range marks the boundary where mortals dare not tread,
The Ice Pool gleams with light—common folk cannot bear its sight (they say: gazing upon this Ice Pool makes the spirit and mind grow dim).
Deep within the rocks, one may avoid the harm of blades and war (its cliffs are steep and secure; in times of chaos, those who hold fast are spared).
Abundant waters nourish the crops and grains (beneath lie springs that irrigate the fields, ensuring harvest each autumn).
Famed as the foremost northern stronghold,
Yet no one has ever painted its splendor."*

We passed through two more cities, and on the ninth day of the ninth month,
we arrived at the Uyghur city of Changbala.
Its king, fearing the reputation of the Master and his ties to the Pacification of the Seas,
led his entire clan and even the Uyghur monks to greet us from afar.
Once we entered, we were invited to a feast on the platform,
where his wife urged us to drink grape wine,
and presented us with watermelons—each weighing as much as a balance scale,
their sweetness and fragrance surpassing anything in the Central Plains.
Vegetables here rival those of the Han lands.

A monk came to sit with us, and the Master instructed his translator to ask:
*"Which scriptures does he study?"*
The monk replied:
*"I was tonsured and received precepts,
Taking the Buddha as my teacher."*
Indeed, all lands to the east once belonged to Tang,
so to the west, there are no monks or Daoists—
the Uyghurs only revere the Western Buddha.

The following day, we traveled roughly ten stages along the northern slope of Yinshan.
We crossed the battlefield, where the sand was fine,
and when wind arose, it surged like a roaring tide—
now gathering, now dispersing, with not a blade of grass in sight.
Wagons sank and horses faltered; we barely emerged by day’s end—
this was the White Bones Plain, where the great sands had split.

To the south lay the foothills of Yinshan.
After crossing the dunes, we traveled another five days,
lodging at the northern base of Yinshan.
At dawn, we turned southward,
descending a long slope of seventy or eighty *li*,
and only at dusk did we rest again.

The weather was bitterly cold, and there was no water.
At morning’s rise, we journeyed southwest for about thirty *li*,
when suddenly we encountered a vast pool—
nearly two hundred *li* in circumference,
ringed by snow-capped peaks whose reflections shimmered within.
The Master named it *Tianchi* [Heavenly Pool].

Following the pool’s southern edge,
we were flanked by towering ridges,
dense with pine and birch, their shadows stretching deep—
each tree stood over a hundred feet tall,
and from summit to base, there were countless thousands!
The currents rushed into narrow gorges,
foaming and tumultuous, winding for sixty or seventy *li*.

The two princes accompanied the Master on his western expedition,
and they first carved paths through the rocks,
building forty-eight wooden bridges—
wide enough for two carts to pass side by side.
We lodged in the gorge at twilight,
and only the next day did we emerge,
entering the great eastern and western rivers,
where water and grass flourished in abundance.
The air felt like spring,
and we began to see mulberry and locust trees.

The journey proceeded another thirty *li*,
and on the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month,
we reached the city of **Alimata** [阿里马],
where **Sūmǔn** [速满] King and the Mongol **Tàlāhū** [塔剌忽只] led their troops to greet us,
and we lodged in the **Western Orchard** [西果园].

The locals call fruit **Alimata** [阿里马],
for the land is rich with harvests,
and thus the city bears its name.
There, they produce **cloth**, called **Tùlǔmá** [秃鲁麻],
commonly said to be woven from **sheep’s wool** (種羊毛).
At that time, we obtained seven bundles of it
to make warm garments—
its fibers resemble those of China.

The **willow catkins** [柳花] were fresh, delicate, and soft,
fit for spinning into **thread** [線] and **rope** [繩],
or weaving into **fabric** [帛] and **cotton** [絮].
The farmers also dug **irrigation canals** [渠] to water their fields,
while the locals carried water in **jugs** [瓶],
balanced on their heads as they returned.

Upon seeing the **central plain’s water-drawing devices** [中原汲器],
they exclaimed with delight:
*"The people of **Táohuāshí** [桃花石] excel in all things!"*
**Táohuāshí** [桃花石] refers to the **Han people** [漢人].

The Master composed a verse of his travels from **Jīnshān** [金山] here:
*"On the eastern bank of Jīnshān, in the western Yīnshān,*
*ten thousand cliffs and ravines block the deep stream.*
*Chaotic rocks lie across the path—*
*no wheel or hoof has passed here since ancient times.*
*Last year, the princes led armies in campaign,*
*clearing roads and building bridges over the rushing waters (the Third Prince built Jīnshān, the Second Prince built Yīnshān).*
*This year, my Dao/Way seeks to journey westward,*
*and carriages and horses clamor once more through this pass.*

*Silver peaks and iron cliffs rise in countless layers,*
*their peaks sharp and their strength unmatched.*
*At dawn, the sea appears near below,*
*and under the moon, the Milky Way flows above.*
*Towering pines stand straight as writing brushes,*
*dense and swaying, over a hundred feet tall.*
*Thousands of trees cluster in deep green shade,*
*yet no bird sings—only silence, vast and hollow.*

*The **Mèngmén** [孟門] Pass crushes **Tàiháng** [太行] Mountain,*
*but this path is far more narrow than those.*
*Two carts struggle to ascend and descend,*
*a hundred horsemen ride in fear, front and back.*
*The **Heavenly Pool** [天池] and **Sea** [海] lie atop the mountain,*
*a hundred *li* wide—*
*the mirror-like surface holds all ten thousand forms.*

*From the county carts to the tethered horses, we descend westward,*
*and the forty-eight bridges stretch low beneath the ten thousand fathoms.*
*South of the river, north of the sea, the mountains are endless,*
*their shapes shifting in myriad ways—yet all the same.*
*Not like this mountain, so wondrous and sublime,*
*its rugged grandeur rivaling the work of gods.*

*When I arrived, it was the eighth or ninth month,*
*and half the mountain was already snow.*
*Before the mountain, grass and trees were warm as spring,*
*behind it, my robes and blankets cold as iron.*

*The provisions over successive days surpassed those before.
Then, four days further west,*
*we reached the **Dálāshǔmò** [答剌速没辇] River (没辇, a river),*
*its currents deep and broad.*
*We followed the western flow,*
*and the eastern current,*
*cutting through Yīnshān Mountain,*
*while its southern bank was still a snowy range.*

*On the second day of the tenth month,*
*we took a boat to cross,*
*and southward reached a great mountain,*
*north of which stood a small city.*

*Again, we journeyed west,*
*and on the fifth day,*
*the **imperial emissary** [宣使] announced that the Master had come in response to the decree,*
*and the distance to the **imperial encampment** [行在] grew near.*
*The emissary first rode ahead to report,*
*while only **Zhèn Hǎi** [镇海] Lord accompanied the Master westward.*

*On the seventh day,*
*we crossed a mountain in the southwest,*
*and encountered an **Eastern Xia envoy** [東夏使] returning.*
*He paid respects to the Master before the tent,*
*and asked: "From when did you come?"*

*The envoy replied:*
*"We departed the court on the twelfth day of the seventh month,*
*and the Emperor led forces in pursuit of **Aidar Khan** [算端汗],*
*driving him to **India** [印度]."*

*The next day,*
*we met heavy snow,*
*and arrived at a **small city of the Uighurs** [回纥小城],*
*where snow filled a foot’s depth—*
*by dawn, it had already melted.*

*On the sixteenth day,*
*we passed **Bǎnqiáo** [板桥] to the southwest,*
*crossed the river,*
*and by evening reached the southern mountain’s base—*
*the domain of **Dàshí Lín Yá** [大石林牙] (Dàshí, the nickname of the scholar **Lín Yá** [林牙]),*
*whose king was a descendant of the **Liao dynasty** [遼後].*
*Since the **Jīn dynasty** [金] forces defeated the **Liao** [遼],*
*Dàshí Lín Yá led thousands to flee westward,*
*and after ten years of wandering,*
*they settled here.*

*Its climate and **qi** [氣] differ from those north of Jīnshān,*
*with vast plains where farming and sericulture flourish.*
*They ferment **grapes** [蒲萄] into wine,*
*and the fruits resemble those of China.*
*Yet, with no rain in summer or autumn,*
*they rely solely on **diverted rivers** [疏河] for irrigation,*
*and all grains grow abundantly.*

*To the northeast and southwest,*
*mountains and rivers stretch for ten thousand *li*,*
*and this land has been ruled for nearly a hundred years.*
*Now, the **Mongols** [滿] lost their kingdom,*
*and took refuge with Dàshí,*
*reviving their soldiers and horses.*
*The land is once more seized by bandits."*

While the **Khans** [算端] of the West [西] reduced their lands,
the **Celestial Soldiers** [天兵] arrived,
and the **Mongols** [滿] were utterly annihilated,
the **Khans** [算端] also perished.

Moreover, it was heard that the way ahead was fraught with obstacles.
A single carriage was destroyed by accident,
and they halted there.

After eighteen days,
they traveled westward along the mountains.

On the seventh or eighth day,
the mountains suddenly turned south,
and a **stone fortress** [石城] blocked their path,
its stones entirely red,
with traces of an ancient garrison.

To the west stood a great mound,
like the **Pleiades** [斗星] aligned in a row.
They crossed a **stone bridge** [石桥],
and after five stages of marching southwest,
they reached **Sailan City** [塞蓝城],
where a small **stupa** [塔] stood.
The **Uyghur** [回纥] king came to greet them
and escort them into the guest hall.

In the early part of the eleventh month,
heavy rains fell for several days in succession.
In the fourth month,
the locals took this as a sign of prosperity,
and they congratulated each other at noon.

On that day,
**Master Xuánjìng** [虚静先生] **Zhào Jiǔgǔ** [赵九古]
spoke to **Emin** [尹公]:
*"When I followed my teacher in the **Xuāndé** [宣德] era,*
*I sensed a destiny for long journeys,*
*and grew weary of travel and toil.*

*My teacher instructed me:*
*'The Daoist does not let life or death move the heart,*
*nor does pleasure or pain concern the mind—*
*wherever one goes, there is no place unsuitable.'*

*Now that the time of my return approaches,*
*you must attend well to your father-teacher.*

*After several days,*
*I feigned illness and departed,*
*which was on the fifth day of the eleventh month.*

*The teacher ordered his disciples to bury Jiǔgǔ*
*in the eastern wilds beyond the city walls,*
*and then continued on.*

*After three more days to the southwest,*
*they reached another city,*
*whose ruler was also an **Uyghur** [回纥],*
*now aged and infirm.*
*He prepared elaborate farewell gifts,*
*offering them **steamed flatbread** [汤饼].*

*The next morning,*
*they passed through yet another city."*

After another two days of travel, they came upon a river—this was the Hǒchuāng River, where the Uyghur carts sank.

They crossed via a floating bridge and camped on the western bank.
The river official presented a fish to the Uyghur official, its mouth vast and scales absent.

Its source lay between two great snow mountains to the southeast,
their waters turbid yet swift, plunging tens of feet deep—
a torrent rushing northwestward,
its length unknown, perhaps thousands of miles.

To the southwest of the river,
for over two hundred miles there was no water or grass.
They marched through the night,
then turned southward,
glimpsing the great snow mountains as they veered west.
The mountains’ shape mirrored those at the southern edge of **Yímǐsīgàn** [邪米思干],
and he composed this verse:

*The Creator’s grandeur defies all naming,*
*mountains arrayed east and west by Heaven’s design.*
*Southward, jade peaks stretch in lofty range,*
*Northward, golden sands press the wildlands flat.*

*Beneath my couch, the spring’s source flows boundless,*
*Above, the heavens’ clarity still overflows.*
*I’ve traveled ten thousand miles, weary of speech,*
*Yet here my wild song bursts forth beyond control.*

They reached another city and found water and grass.

They passed through yet another city,
where Uyghur leaders came far to greet them,
and feasted in the city’s southern quarter.
They offered **grape wine** [蒲萄酒],
and had children perform acrobatic stunts on poles—
swordplay and the like.

After two more cities,
half a day of mountain travel,
they entered a vast plain stretching north and south,
and rested beneath a great mulberry tree,
whose shade could shelter a hundred men.

They reached another city ahead,
where by the road stood a well,
deep beyond a hundred feet.
An Uyghur elder drove a cow
to haul the bucket up by rope,
quenching the thirst of weary travelers.

At first, when the Emperor’s western campaign saw this,
he marveled and ordered the well’s taxes exempted.

On the eighteenth day of the twelfth month,
they crossed the great river
and reached the northern outskirts of **Yímǐsīgàn**’s grand city.
The **Grand Master** [太师] **Móliè** [移剌] and the **Uyghur** [回纥] and **Mongol** [蒙古] commanders
led a procession bearing wine to welcome them in the open fields.
They erected grand tents,
and the teacher halted his carriage there.

The teacher **Liú** [刘] had been delayed by roadblocks,
and in the gathering, the teacher said to **Bái** [白]:
*"I recently learned of a great river a thousand miles away,
where the ferry was destroyed by bandits.
Now that winter is deep,
your father-teacher should come in the spring
to pay respects at court."*
The teacher agreed.

Soon after,
they entered through the northeastern gate.

The city was built along the ravines and banks of its ditches.
In autumn and summer, when rain was scarce,
the people dug two rivers into the city,
so that water flowed through every lane and alley,
and every household had access.

When the **Shanshan** [算端] clan still held power,
the city housed over ten thousand families.
After its fall, only one in four survived—
mostly **Uyghur** [回纥], who could not claim their own fields
and had to rely on **Han**, **Khitan** [契丹], and **Hexi** [河西] families.
Its officials were drawn from all peoples,
and **Han** artisans lived scattered among the city’s quarters.

There was a hill rising ten *zhang* high,
where the **Shanshan** had built their new palace—
the **Grand Master** [太师] had first occupied it.
But since the **Uyghur** struggled with food shortages
and bandits were rampant,
he feared rebellion and moved north of the river.

The teacher then took up residence in the palace
and sighed, saying:
*"A Daoist lets fate unfold, drifting through the years.
Even with blades at their throat, they fear no harm.
How much more so when bandits have not yet come—
to worry in advance?

Good and evil follow separate paths;
they cannot harm one another.
Let my followers rest in ease."*

The Grand Master held a vegetarian feast, offering ten *jin* of gold. The teacher declined, and from then on, he was monthly provided with rice, flour, oil, and fruit, saying, *"This only increases my respect."*

The official, seeing the teacher drank little, requested a hundred *dou* of grapes to make new wine. The teacher said, *"Why wine at all?"* He only asked for the quantity, saying, *"That will suffice for guests."*

The grapes endured the winter without spoiling.

He also saw peacocks and elephants—both creatures from India, thousands of *li* to the south. In his leisure, the teacher composed a poem:

*"In February, I set out; by October, I reached the great Uyghur city walls.
The pagoda’s height defies sight—thirteen tiers (carved from bricks, hollow yet intricate, with no visible levels, yet passage within).
The mountains’ depth surpasses ten thousand folds.

In autumn, elephants still roam the outskirts,
while summer clouds, rainless, never summon dragons.

Fine vegetables, wheat porridge, grape wine—
I eat my fill, sleep soundly, nurturing my natural indolence."*

After wintering there, the imperial envoy and the Viceroy of Zhenhai sent officers like Heluo, leading hundreds of soldiers to scout ahead. Han people often came to pay homage.

A scholar of calendrics stood nearby, and the teacher asked about the solar eclipse on the fifth month’s first day. The man replied, *"Here, it begins at the *chen* hour and lasts until the sixth month."* The teacher said, *"When I was at Lujuhe, I saw it at noon."* Later, near the Golden Mountain, he noted it had reached seven *fen* by the time he arrived. *"These three places saw it differently,"* he observed.

Referring to Kong Yingda’s *Spring and Autumn Annals Commentary*, he said, *"The moon’s shadow obscures the sun, and it is called an eclipse."* Judging by this, *"when the shadow first appears, it is an eclipse. But for those nearby, the difference spans thousands of *li*."*

*"It is like shading a lamp with a fan—where the shadow falls, the light vanishes.
The farther the fan moves, the more the lamp’s glow returns."*

Later, in the old palace, he inscribed *Fengqi Heitui* on the wall:

**First Verse:**
*"A single spark of luminous wisdom, hidden yet awakening—
In heaven or earth, no trace of presence or absence.
Alone across the four seas and eight wastes,
Neither void nor existent—who could witness this?

A glance, a raised brow, and the whole body reveals itself.
Amid the boundless *dharma-realm*, it departs transcendent.
Through countless kalpas of wheeling rebirth, a single encounter—
The Nine *Yuan* ascend the Three Pure Ones’ path."*

**Second Verse:**
*"Sun and moon cycle endlessly, no fixed end—
Spring fades, autumn comes, how many flourishings and decays?
Five Emperors, Three Sovereigns, thousandfold ages—
Each rise and fall follows this eternal law.

Death gives way to birth, birth to death again—
The wheel of transformation, when will it cease?
Only when reaching the heartless resting place
Can one attain pure clarity beyond."*

Two more poems followed:

**First:**
*"East Sea to West Qin, decades of profound thought on Dao and its root.
At midday, one eclipse—why seek fullness?
At third watch, sleepless, I strain my eyes.
My true path does not align with celestial ascent,
Yet empty fame spreads across the northern frontier.
Let great kings issue clear decrees—
May the winds and sands carry it to the utmost borders."*

**Second:**
*"The moon’s shadow moves in measured steps,
From the first hour’s bite to the sixth month’s release.
At Lujuhe, it came at noon’s sharp strike,
By the Golden Peak, it had consumed seven parts.
Three places saw it differently—
Shadows stretch where light once burned.

Like a fan blocking a lamp’s glow,
Where the shadow falls, the brightness fades.
The farther the hand, the more light shows—
Thus the eclipse shifts with the eye’s gaze."*

**Second:**

*"At youth’s first bloom, I served the True beside the boundless ocean waves,
In middle years, I fled my traces to the lofty Erlang Mountains.
From the south of the Yellow River, I ascended as a soaring crane,
To the northern frontier, I proclaimed the task of hooking the giant tortoise.

The boundless mountains and rivers stretch endlessly,
My striving heart, ever entangled in deeds, wearies in vain.
Though I grasp the **Three Thousand Worlds**,
I cannot yet escape the limits of mundane powers.

That year, in the intercalary twelfth month as it neared its end,
Scouts returned, bearing word from the Imperial Envoy:
‘The Two Princes have marshaled their armies,
Repaired the bridges, and crushed the local rebels.’

Haitala and others came to the camp to greet the Prince,
Saying, ‘The Master wishes to pay homage to the Emperor’s court.’
The Prince then gave orders:
‘The Imperial Procession has halted at the southeast of the Great Snow Mountain,
Yet now the snow has piled its gates a hundred *li* deep—
Impassable, this is the very path you must take.
For my sake, summon the Master here,
That he may await the opportune moment.
When he comes, I shall dispatch Mongol troops to escort him into that city.’

The Master replied to the Envoy:
‘I hear that south of the River for a thousand *li*,
There is no sustenance at all.
My food requires rice and wheat, vegetables and greens—
Return and inform the Prince’s staff of this.’

In the spring of the year *Rénwǔ* (壬午), the first month,
The *píliàng* (杷榄) bloomed—like small peaches,
Waiting till autumn to gather its fruit for eating,

The Envoy then, in due course, presented his report.
The Emperor was pleased and detained him for several days before he returned.

The Master thus left three of his disciples—Yín Zhìpíng and others—at the lodging,
And set out with five or six attendants and the Imperial Envoy on the fifteenth day of the third month.

On the fourth day, they passed through Jiéshí City,
Where advance orders had been given: *"Let the Mongol and Huíhé (回纥) troops under the command of Wànhù Bōlǔzhī escort the Master with a thousand soldiers."*

Crossing the Iron Gate Pass, they traveled southeast over the mountains,
Whose towering heights and jagged rocks stretched in chaotic array.

The soldiers pulled the carriage, and it took two days to reach the foothills.
Following the current southward, the troops then entered the northern mountains to rout the rebels.

On the fifth day, they arrived at the Xiǎo Hé River,
Where they crossed by boat amid lush forests on both banks.

On the seventh day, they ferried across the Great River—
This was the place of the *Āmù* (阿母) *niǎn* (辇).

Proceeding southeast, they anchored at night on the banks of an ancient canal,
Where reeds and cattails carpeted the earth, unlike anything seen in the Central Plains.

The larger ones retained their green leaves even through winter, unwithering.
The Master took them as staffs, and when laid across the wagon axle at night,
The axle never bent beneath their weight.

The smaller ones shed their leaves in autumn and sprouted anew in spring.

Further south, the mountains held thick-walled bamboo,
Which the soldiers fashioned into spears and halberds.

And they saw *xīyì* (蜥蜴), each measuring three *chǐ* in length,
With bodies of deep green and black.

It was the twenty-ninth day of the third month,
And the Master composed a verse:

*"Pursuing the Dao remains unfulfilled,*
*The demons of the heavens strike fear within me.*
*Eastward I depart from the seas,*
*Westward I gaze toward the borders of the sun.*
*No rooster’s crow nor dog’s bark sounds,*
*And horses and oxen press on in endless succession."*

The Master traversed myriad mountains and ten thousand rivers—
Unknown where this place might be.

After four days, he reached the imperial encampment.
The Emperor sent a great minister, **Hè Lā Bó Dé Lái** (喝剌播得來), to welcome him,
On the fifth day of the fourth month.

The lodgings were arranged, and he entered to pay his respects.
The Emperor greeted him, saying: *"Other lands’ summons he refuses,
Yet here, crossing ten thousand leagues, you come—
I rejoice greatly in this."*

The Master replied: *"The humble ones of the wilderness obey the edict by fate.
It is the heavens’ will."*

The Emperor delighted, granted him a seat,
And after the meal inquired: *"Master, having journeyed so far,
Do you possess any elixir of longevity to aid me?"*

The Master said: *"There is the **Way of Hygiene** (衛生之道),
But no elixir of longevity."*

The Emperor praised his honesty,
And set up two pavilions in the eastern part of his own tent for his residence.

The translator asked: *"Do people call you **Téngchīlì Mǒnggǔ Kǒng** (腾吃利蒙古孔)?
Or do you claim that title yourself?"*

The Master said: *"The wilderness does not name itself—
It is what others call me."*

The translator pressed again: *"What was your old name?"*
And the Master answered: *"In the wilderness, four men sought the **Way** from the **Revered Master of the Double Yang** (重陽師),
Three have already ascended—
Only the wilderness remains, and people call me **Master** (先生)."*

The Emperor asked **Zhèn Hǎi** (鎮海): *"What title should the Master bear?"*
**Zhèn Hǎi** reported: *"Some honor him as **Master Father** (師父),
Others as **Master of the Way** (真人) or **Immortal** (神仙)."*

The Emperor said: *"From now on, you may be called **Immortal**."*

At this time, the heat was intense,
So the imperial retinue camped beneath the snowy peaks to escape it.
The Emperor scheduled a **Way-inquiry** (問道) for the fourteenth of the fourth month,
With **Dà Zhèn Hǎi** (田鎮海), **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄), and **Ālǐ Xiān** (阿里鮮) recording it externally,
And three close attendants taking notes within.

News came of **Huíhuá** (回纥) bandits harassing the passes,
And the Emperor, desiring to lead the campaign himself,
Changed the auspicious day to the tenth month.

The Master begged to return to his old lodgings,
But the Emperor said: *"Come again—
Would that not be too much labor?"*

The Master replied: *"Two weeks will suffice."*

The Emperor said again: *"There will be no escort."*
The Master answered: *"There is **Xuānchāi Yáng Āgǒu** (宣差楊阿狗)."*

After three more days,
**Āgǒu** (阿狗) was ordered to supervise the **Huíhuá** (回纥) chieftains,
With over a thousand cavalry accompanying him on the journey.
They returned by another route.

The Master then ascended the great mountains—
There was a **Stone Gate** (石門), its cliffs sharp as if cut from wax,
A massive rock spanning above like a bridge.
Below, the current was swift,
And soldiers urged their donkeys to cross—
The donkeys drowned, and corpses littered the banks.
This was a **pass**, newly breached by troops.

Emerging from the gorge,
He composed two verses.

The first reads:
*"North of the water, the Iron Gate still stands firm,
But south of the water, the Stone Gorge is too dreadful to behold.
The cliffs rise sheer, their peaks scraping the heavens,
While the ravine’s cold waves surge, earth-shaking in their descent.
Along the path, drowned bodies choke the air—men clap their hands to their noses,
And I, with ears long as the **Qiang** (涧), am moved to sorrow.
Ten years of war, ten thousand leagues—when will the soldiers return,
And restore the land to **Great Peace** (太平)?"*

The second reads:
*"The **Snowy Peaks** (雪岭) gleam white, leaning against the sky,
While dawn’s light shimmers below, bathing the river’s flow.
Gazing upward, men cross the cliffs on ropes,
Looking down, the pines hang inverted from the perilous crags.
The **May Wind** (五月) blows fierce and cold upon my face,
Yet the **Three-Jiao Fever** (三焦热病) has already healed.
I came to expound the **Way**, but now only turn my head in vain—
I await the next auspicious hour to descend to the **Lower Realm** (下元)."*

When the Master first arrived to pay homage,
The third month had ended,
Grasses and trees flourished, and sheep and horses grew fat.
By the time he received the edict to depart,
The fourth month had passed—
All the plants withered away.

He composed another verse:
*"The foreign lands are deep and vast, their affairs beyond reckoning,
Yet the **Dao’s** (道) **yin-yang** (陰陽) and seasonal rhythms are utterly unknown here.
Scarcely had I passed the fourth month when the **Yin Demons** (陰魔) vanished—
*(For in spring and winter, the rains persist, but in the fourth month, the **Pure Yang** (純陽) reigns, and there is no rain.)*
Now I laugh at the **Drought Demon** (旱魃), fierce across the heavens.
The waters nourish the ten thousand streams in **High Summer** (九夏),
Yet the plants are ravaged as if by **Late Winter** (三冬).

I have traveled back and forth three thousand leagues—
*(Departing in the third month, returning in the fifth.)*
No traveler I meet bears the mark of rain.
I encountered soldiers returning from the **Western Campaign** (征西),
Many bearing **coral** (珊瑚).
One official exchanged two **catty of white gold** (白金二镒) for ten stalks—
Nearly fifty in all, the tallest over a foot high—
But they were won in battle, and so could not be fully preserved.

On the **Evening of the Double Wu** (重午), he set out for cooler lands.
By the fifth or sixth day,
He reached **Yǎmǐsīgàn Dàshí** (邪米思干, the Great Stone of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府)),
Where the officials welcomed him into the lodgings.
This was the day of the **Double Wu** (重午).

---
**The Master’s Western Journey Record (二)** (Longchun Zhenren Xiyou Ji, Volume Two)
**Master Li** (李公) departed eastward,
And sent verses to the **Daoists of the East** (東方道眾), saying:

*"At that time, from the seaside city I set out,
While the **Way’s** (道) **dryness and martial strife** (海上干戈) still raged unchecked.
To awaken the **Dao of Virtue and Way** (道德) beyond the thousand leagues,
I did not shrink from the dust and winds of the **Nine Barbarians’** (九夷) lands.

First, I climbed the **High Ridge of the West-North** (西北高岭),
*(That is, the **Wild Fox Ridge** (野狐岭).)*
Gradually turning east-south,
I pointed toward the **Upper Capital** (上京).
*(Standing on the eastern bank of the **Lù Jú** (陸局) River,
I gazed east-south toward the **Upper Capital**.)*

Then I descended southwestward—
*(Southwest four thousand leagues to **Wùlǐduō** (兀里朵),
Then another two thousand leagues southwest to the **Yin Mountains** (阴山).)*
Beyond the **Yin Mountains** (阴山), the name of the land is lost.
*(Southwest of the **Yin Mountains**, there is a range of great mountains,
And a lesser stream, stretching thousands of leagues to the great city of **Yǎmǐsīgàn** (邪米思干),
Where the Master’s lodgings were in the old palace.)*

The Master had returned to his lodgings,
Which were built upon the northern cliffs,
Overlooking a clear stream ten *zhang* deep.
The stream came from the **Snowy Mountains** (雪山),
And was bitterly cold.

In **Mid-Summer** (仲夏), the heat was fierce,
So he reclined in the northern veranda, fanning himself.
At night, he slept upon the **Peak Platform** (屋颠之台).

When the **Extreme Heat** (极暑) of the sixth month came,
He bathed in a pool.

Thus the Master adapted to life in this distant realm.
The soil of **Hézhōngfǔ** (河中府) was fertile for all grains,
Yet lacked **barley** (荞麦) and **large soybeans** (大豆).
In the fourth month, the wheat ripened,
And the locals harvested it, piling it haphazardly on the ground.
When needed, they would thresh it—
The work was finished by the sixth month.

**Master Li**, the **Tí Kòng** (提控) of the **Tàishīfǔ** (太师府),
Offered a five-*mǔ* (亩) melon field,
Whose fruit was supremely sweet and fragrant—
A taste unknown in the Central Lands,
With some as large as a **dou** (斗) measure.

In the sixth month,
The two **Princes** (太子) returned,
And **Liú Zhòng Lù** (劉仲禄) begged for melons to present to them—
Ten could weigh as much as a **burden** (一担).

The fruits and vegetables were abundant,
Only lacking **taro** (芋) and **chestnuts** (栗)."

The fruits of the eggplant were as thick as a coarse finger,
Yet their hue was deep purple-black.

Both men and women wore their hair unbound.
Men’s headgear varied—some like distant-mountain caps,
Adorned with motley dyes and embroidered with cloud motifs,
Tied with tassels.
From the chieftains downward, those in office wore such caps,
While commoners wrapped a white *mòsī* (fine cloth) strip,
Six *chǐ* long, around their heads.

The wives of nobles bound their foreheads with silk,
Some black, some purple,
Or embroidered with floral patterns and woven beast motifs,
Long enough to reach six or seven *chǐ*.
Their hair hung loose, some encased in cotton pouches—
Plain, multicolored, or made of cloth—
Never styled into a chignon,
But instead covered with cloth or silk,
Like the garb of a *bīqúní* (Buddhist nun).
Such were the adornments of common women.

Their clothing often consisted of white *mì* (hemp cloth),
Sewn like a pouch with a narrow top and wide bottom,
Attached with sleeves—
Called *chèn yī* (undergarment),
Worn by both men and women.

Their carriages, boats, and farming tools
Differed markedly from those of the Central Plains.

The people used bronze and *kūn* (ironstone) for their vessels,
Occasionally pottery, including some resembling the *dìngcí* (standard ceramics) of the Central Lands.
Their drinking vessels were all made of *liúlí* (glass),
While their weapons were forged from *rén* (crucible steel).

Trade used gold coins without holes,
Both sides stamped with *Huíhuá* (回纥) script.

Their people were tall and strong,
Capable of bearing heavy loads without burdens.

When women married, if their husbands grew poor,
They could remarry.
If a journey exceeded three months,
They were also permitted to wed another.

Some bore beards—
Those called *Dàshímǎ* (大石马) in their land,
Who knew their national script
And were entrusted with record-keeping.

During the late winter,
They observed a month-long fast,
And at dusk, their leaders would slaughter a sheep to share,
Feasting with guests from night until dawn.
In other months, they held six fasts.

They also erected a perilous pavilion,
From which a large wooden beam jutted outward—
Like a flying eave, over a *zhāng* in length and width—
With an empty pavilion above,
Hanging tassels on all four sides.

Each dawn and dusk,
Their leader would ascend it to face the west,
Calling it "telling the heavens,"
Neither worshipping Buddha nor the Dao.
They would shout and chant from its height.

Hearing this, all able-bodied men and women
Would rush to kneel below,
The entire nation doing so.
Failure to comply meant execution.

Their clothing matched that of the commoners,
But their headgear was a fine *mòsī* wrap,
Three *zhàng* two *chǐ* long,
Reinforced with bamboo.

The Master found their customs strange
And composed a poem to record them:

*"Huíhuá’s ruins stretch ten thousand *lǐ*,
Hézhōng’s city stands the mightiest of all.
The whole city’s bronze like gold,
The market’s warrior garb like Daoist robes.
They clip and weave gold for tribute,
And stitch white hemp into their clothes.
The spirit melon and white chestnut—
Who in the Red Land could have tasted them?
In summer, the snowy peaks grow cold,
With mist and clouds so bleak—
The Master then composed a *juéjù* (absolute poem):*

*‘East Mountain’s night breathes a vast, wild haze,
The evening glow spreads a crimson sea.
The moon, rising late, soars from the sea,
Its golden light piercing the emerald sky.’*

While staying in the guesthouse,
The Master had few visitors,
Amusing himself with scriptures and games,
And wrote another *juéjù*:

*‘Beyond the Yín Mountains, ten thousand *lǐ* away,
West of Dàshí, I’ve dwelled half a year.
In these distant, crude lands, the Dao is hard to speak of—
In quiet chambers and secluded cliffs, I’ll just read my books.’*

On the seventh day of the seventh month,
He dispatched Alī Xiān (阿里鲜) to deliver a memorial
To the Imperial Palace, requesting an audience.

On the seventh day of the eighth month,
He received the Emperor’s reply.

On the eighth day,
He departed, with the Tàishī (太师) escorting him for tens of *lǐ*.

The Master then said: *"To the east of the Huíhé city, there are two thousand households who have recently rebelled. Night after night, their fires illuminate the city, unsettling the people. The Tàishī should return to pacify them."*

The Tàishī replied: *"If, along the way, there should be any unforeseen dangers, what then?"*

The Master said: *"What concern is that to the Tàishī?"*
And so he returned.

On the twelfth day, they passed through Jiéshí City.
On the thirteenth day, they received a thousand foot soldiers and three hundred armored cavalry for escort, then entered the great mountains—this was the alternate path outside the Iron Gate.

They crossed the Red Water Ravine, where towering peaks rose thousands of *lǐ* high.
Traveling southeast through the valley, a saline spring flowed from the mountain’s roots. When it dried, it became white salt, so they collected two *dòu* to carry along for use. Further southeast, they ascended the Dividing Ridge, where to the west, a deep ravine gleamed like ice—this too was salt. On the mountain’s slopes, red salt lay like stone, which the Master himself had tasted.

In the east, salt is mined from the earth; here in these lands, it also emerges from the mountains.
The Huíhé people eat flatbreads and crave salt. When thirsty, they drink water, and in winter’s cold, the poor even carry bread to sell.

On the fourteenth day, they reached the southern slopes of the Iron Gate’s western pass, preparing to leave the mountains.
The mountain pass was steep and treacherous, with a collapsed cliff on the left, where the ravine’s waters flowed hidden for about one *lǐ*.
At mid-autumn, they arrived at the riverbank, its current vast as the Yellow River, flowing northwest. They crossed by boat and camped on its southern shore.

To the west lay a mountain stronghold named Tuánbālā, its terrain rugged and fortified.
The Third Prince’s medical officer, Master Zhèng, encountered them along the way and presented a poem:

*"Since ancient times, the mid-autumn moon shines brightest,
Its cool breeze arriving with the season, the night ever clearer.
The heavens’ breath hangs like silver in the Milky Way,
While fish and dragons gleam in the water’s crystalline light.
From Wu and Yue, the towers hum with music and revelry,
From Yan and Qin, the troops feast with wine and delicacies.
I stand before Your Majesty by the river’s edge,
Hoping to lay down arms and restore the Great Peace."*

They traveled thirty *lǐ* southeast along the river before reaching dry land, then continued by night.
They passed through Bānlí City, vast and still echoing with distant barking—its people had recently rebelled and fled.
At dawn, after breaking their fast, they traveled east for several *lǐ* until they found a north-flowing stream, barely fordable by horse. They rested and camped on the eastern bank.

On the twenty-second day, Dànhàn Zhèn welcomed them from the east, escorting them to the Imperial encampment. The Emperor sent Zhèn to ask: *"Do you wish to see me now? Or would you prefer to rest awhile?"*

The Master replied: *"I wish to enter and pay my respects."*
He added: *"Those who follow the Dao have never knelt before the Emperor. Upon entering the tent, one stands with hands clasped—no further ceremony."*

After the audience, they were granted fermented mare’s milk until they took their leave.
The Emperor then asked: *"Are your provisions in the city sufficient?"*
The Master answered: *"The Mongols and Huíhé have long been supplied by the Tàishī. Recently, food has grown scarce, and the Tàishī alone has managed it."*

The next day, the Emperor sent an attendant to convey: *"Would it be acceptable for the True Person to come daily for meals?"*
The Master replied: *"One who cultivates the Dao in the wilderness seeks only quietude."*
The Emperor granted his request as he pleased.

On the twenty-seventh day, the Imperial procession turned north. Along the way, they were repeatedly given grapes, melons, and tea cakes.
On the first day of the ninth month, they crossed the river bridge and headed north.

The Master petitioned: *"The appointed time for our discussion approaches. The Tàishī Ahǎi should be summoned."*

On the month’s full moon, the Emperor set up a pavilion for a solemn fast, dismissing the attendants. Lamplight blazed as the Master, the Tàishī Ahǎi, and Alī Xiān entered the tent.
He declared: *"Commissioner Zhònglù has traveled ten thousand *lǐ* to attend, and Zhèn has journeyed thousands to escort me. They too should be admitted to hear the Dao’s discourse."*

Both men were summoned in, and whatever the Master spoke was translated by the Tàishī into Mongolian, greatly pleasing the Emperor.

On the ninth day of the tenth month, under a clear night, the Emperor summoned the Master again to discuss the Dao, and he took great delight.

On the twenty-third day, the Master was again invited into the pavilion, with the same formalities as before.
The Emperor listened with warmth, ordering his attendants to record the words, and commanded them to be inscribed in Han characters—his intent clear that they should not be forgotten.
To his retinue, he said: *"The Three Sovereigns have thrice spoken of the art of nurturing life, and their teachings have deeply moved me. See that these words are not leaked beyond these walls."*

From that point onward, as they traveled east, the Master frequently expounded on Dao and transformation.
After several more days, they reached thirty *lǐ* southwest of the great city of Yémǐsīgàn.

The Emperor halted his journey on the first day of the tenth month, twenty *lǐ* east of the great city.

On the sixth day of that month, the Master Ahai entered to pay his respects.
The Emperor asked: *"Why do your attendants not depart?"*
The Master replied: *"They do not come seeking me."*
Thus, the Emperor commanded the Master to report: *"I have studied the Dao in the mountains for many years now. I always take pleasure in quiet repose, whether sitting or standing. Before the imperial tent, the soldiers and horses are in constant motion, and my spirit is not at ease. From this point onward, some may go ahead, others may follow behind—let them proceed at their own discretion. The mountains have been greatly favored by your grace."*

The Emperor agreed.

After the Master had left, the Emperor sent someone to ask him: *"Do you wish to stay or depart?"*
The Master replied: *"No need."*

At that time, a light rain began to fall, green grass sprouted anew, and though mid-winter had passed, snow and rain grew more frequent, and the earth’s vital breath (*qì*) was just beginning to stir.

When the Master arrived at this city, he distributed any remaining provisions to the starving people, and often set up soup kitchens, saving many lives.

On the twenty-sixth day, they departed.

On the twenty-third day of the twelfth month, the cold snow caused many oxen and horses along the road to freeze to death.

Three days later, as they traveled east, they crossed the **Huo Tan** River (*a great river*), reaching the **Xíngzài** encampment. There, they heard that the ferry bridge had been broken in the middle of the night on the twenty-eighth day, scattering its supports.

The Emperor inquired about the thunderous lightning, and the Master answered: *"In the mountains, I have heard that your people do not bathe in the river during summer, do not wash their clothes, nor make felt. If wild silkworms are found, their gathering is forbidden—all out of fear of the Heavenly might. This is not the Dao of reverence for Heaven! I have also heard that the greatest crime is filial disobedience, and Heaven warns through such signs. Now, I hear that many in your realm neglect their parents. You, O Emperor, ride upon virtue and power—you may admonish your people."*

The Emperor rejoiced, saying: *"The Master’s words truly accord with my heart. Command my attendants to record these teachings in **Huixia** script."* (*Huixia* being the script of the Uighurs)

The Master begged to proclaim these lessons to all the people, but the Emperor refused.

The Emperor then gathered the Crown Prince, the Princes, and the great ministers, saying: *"The Han people revere the Dao/Way of the Three Sovereigns just as you revere Heaven. I now believe even more—they are indeed Heavenly beings and humans combined."*

He then expounded the Master’s previous discourses and replies to them, adding: *"Heaven has sent the Three Sovereigns to speak these words to me. Each of you should engrave them upon your hearts."* The Master bowed and withdrew. By the next New Year’s Day, the generals, physicians, and diviners (*wǔbǔ* officials) came to congratulate him.

On the eleventh day, the horses turned eastward, gazing back at **Yémǐsīgàn** some thousand *lǐ* away, and halted at a great orchard.

On the eighteenth day, the Master’s disciple Li Gong from the **Tàishīfǔ** (*Grand Master’s Office*) departed. The Master said: *"Will we meet again?"*
Li Gong replied: *"In the third month."*
The Master said: *"You do not understand Heaven’s principles. By the second or third month, I shall have definitely returned east."*

On the twenty-first day, after traveling a short distance eastward, they reached a great river, three *lǐ* northeast of **Sàilán**, where the water and grass were abundant, enough to satiate the oxen and horses. They lingered there.

On the seventh day of the second month, the Master entered to pay his respects, reporting: *"In the mountains, I have been distant from the Han lands for about three years, and now I return. This is my true wish—to return to the mountains after three years."*

The Emperor said: *"I have already traveled east. Can we share the road?"*
The Master replied: *"I can proceed ahead as you wish."*

When he left earlier, the Han people asked him about his return, and he had answered: *"Three years."* Now, after the Emperor’s inquiries and discourses had concluded, he again firmly declined to stay.

The Emperor said: *"Wait but three or five days. The Crown Prince will arrive, and you may address any unresolved matters of the Dao. Once I comprehend them, I will depart."*

On the eighth day, the Emperor hunted in the eastern foothills, shooting a great boar. His horse stumbled, and the boar stood beside him, daring not to advance. The attendants brought another horse, and the hunt was abandoned as they returned to the palace.

The Master, hearing of this, entered to remonstrate: *"The Dao of Heaven favors life. Now that Your Majesty’s years are advanced, it is fitting to hunt less often. The horse’s fall was a Heavenly warning. The boar did not dare advance—Heaven protected it."*

The Emperor said: *"I have already deeply reflected. The Three Sovereigns’ counsel is indeed most correct."*

The Master replied: *"I am a Mongol, unskilled in riding and archery, yet unable to cease at once. Though so, the words of the Daoist Master resonate deeply within me."*

The Emperor, turning to his attendant **Jixi Lida**, said: *"Only follow the Daoist Master’s counsel from now on."* Thereafter, for two months, he did not hunt.

On the twenty-fourth day, the Master again declined the court. The Emperor asked: *"The Daoist Master is departing—what shall I give him?"*
*"I shall ponder this,"* the Emperor said, *"and wait a few more days."*

Knowing he could not depart hastily, the Master lingered, waiting.

On the seventh day of the third month, he again declined the court. The Emperor bestowed cattle, horses, and other gifts, but the Master refused them all, saying: *"A courier’s horse is sufficient."*

The Emperor asked the interpreter **Ali Xian**: *"How many Daoist disciples are there in the Han lands?"*
*"Many,"* he replied. *"When the Daoist Master arrived, the officials of Dexing Prefecture’s Longyang Observatory had already summoned and pressured men for service."*

The Emperor said: *"All such levies under my jurisdiction shall be exempted. I shall also issue an imperial edict—sealed with my treasure mark—and command **Ali Xian** (a man of Hexi) as the messenger, with **Menggu Dai** and **Heqila Baha** as his deputies, to escort the Master eastward on his return."*

On the tenth day, the Master took leave and departed. From **Dala** onward, all bore grapes, fine fruits, and saw him off for tens of *li*. At parting, many wept.

Three days later, they reached the southeast of **Sailan**’s great city, where a two-headed serpent, two *chi* long, was often seen by locals. The Master said: *"My disciples have gone to the outskirts to offer libations at the tomb of the **Virtuous and Tranquil Master, Zhao Gong**."*

The disciples wished to carry his bones back, but the Master said: *"The Four Great Elements lend this form, yet it shall decay. The true essence of the One is unbound—free and unrestrained."* The disciples’ resolve then faltered, and the Master proceeded on the twenty-third day.

The messenger **Agou** caught up to bid farewell at the southern bank of **Chuimeng’s** palanquin.

Ten days later, they reached **Alima City**’s western outskirts, crossing the great river. On the fifth day of the fourth month, they arrived at **Alima City**’s eastern garden. The **Second Prince’s** master carpenter pleaded: *"Your disciple’s residence has three altars and four hundred followers, who attend morning and evening rites without fail. For days now, we have awaited your crossing—may we beg your instruction? It would be most fortunate."*

The Master declined: *"My southern fate draws near; I cannot alter my path."*

Pressing further, the Master said: *"If there is no other matter, I shall grant it."* The next day, the horse the Master rode suddenly galloped northeast, and his attendants could not restrain it. Zhang Gong and others wept, saying: *"We are fated to miss this—Heaven does not permit his stay."*

That evening, they camped before **Yinshan**. The next day, they crossed the **Forty-Eight Bridges**, followed the stream fifty *li* upstream, and reached **Tianchi Sea**. Passing northeast beyond **Yinshan**, they traveled two days before finally joining the **Yuanli Golden Mountain**’s southern road to the **Great River Post**. They then followed the eastern slopes of **Golden Mountain**, traveling north along the mountains.

On the twenty-eighth day of the fourth month, a great snowstorm fell. The next day, the mountains were entirely white as they continued northeast along the ridges. Three days later, they reached the foothills of **Abuhan Mountain**.

The disciples—Song Dao’an and eight others—together with the congregations of Changchun and Yuhua, along with the envoys Guo Dequan and others, traveled far to welcome [the master] into Qixia Guan. Many took refuge.

When the master alighted from his carriage, rain fell again. The people rejoiced, saying: *"In past summers, this place rarely saw rain. Even when thunderstorms came, they mostly struck between the southern and northern mountains. Today, the rain has reached our feet—all due to the blessings of our master’s Dao."*

The locals usually dredged the river to irrigate their fields, and by the eighth day, the wheat and barley would ripen. Yet they never matched the yield of Heaven’s rain. When autumn harvests came, field mice—many of them white—became a plague.

This land is often cold, and crops mature late. In May, the riverbanks had soil a *chi* deep, beneath which lay firm ice another *chi* thick. After the ritual, [the master] ordered someone to retrieve it.

To the south, towering ridges bore snow year-round, even in scorching summer, and many marvels were seen there.

Near the western sea, beside a windy grave mound, the soil was white and chalky, cracked like powder. In the second or third month, winds would rise from the southern mountains, and the cliffs and caves would roar first—as if scouts heralding the storm. The wind emerged from the mound, first swirling like countless ram’s horns, then coalescing into a single tempest. It hurled sand and stones, tore roofs from houses, uprooted trees, and shook the hundred rivers before subsiding in the southeast.

Further east-southeast, behind a ravine, there were three or four water mills. But once the land leveled, the water dwindled and vanished, while the mountains yielded coal.

To the east, there were two springs. In winter, they would suddenly surge like lakes, then vanish underground, only to burst forth again, carrying fish and shrimp that sometimes drowned villagers. By mid-spring, they would recede, leaving the earth sunken.

A thousand *li* to the northwest lay Jianjian Prefecture, where fine iron was mined. The region had many green rats and grew wheat and barley. A thousand or more Han artisans lived there, weaving silk brocades and embroidered fabrics.

From the Daoist temple’s western wing, one could see Golden Mountain, where frequent hailstorms and, in the fifth or sixth month, snowdrifts a *zhang* deep would fall.

In the northern lands, the Shatuo people gathered *roucangrong* (肉苁蓉), which the locals called *suoyan*. Their water was called *wusu*, and their grass *aibusu*.

Deeper into Yinshan, the pines reached heights of ten *zhang*.

The congregation told the master: *"This land is remote, untouched by orthodox teachings since antiquity. Only mountain spirits and demons deceived the people. Since you established the observatory, you have repeatedly held grand rituals and morning assemblies, and many have taken vows against killing. Without your Daoist transformation, how could this have come to pass?"*

Previously, in the year *Rénwǔ* (壬午), the Daoist community had been persecuted by malevolent forces, and the disciples were uneasy. Song [Dao’an] was napping in the hall when suddenly, from a celestial window, he saw Master Xu Jing, Zhao Gong, appear and say: *"A letter has arrived."*

Dao’an asked: *"From where?"*
He replied: *"From Heaven."*

The disciples received and opened it, only to see the characters **Tàiqīng** (太清) vanish abruptly.

The next day, the master announced: *"A letter has arrived, and the demonic afflictions are gradually abating."*

There was also a physician named Luo Shēng, who, though skilled, was not malicious. One day, he fell from his horse at the observatory’s gate, breaking his tibia, and immediately regretted it, saying: *"This was my fault."* He then confessed to the Daoist congregation.

The master traveled eastward, and a letter of instruction arrived, which he displayed for the assembly:

*"For ten thousand *lǐ* I ride on state horses,*
*Three years away from my old friends.*
*The weapons have not yet been laid down,*
*Yet the Dao/Way is now briefly revealed.*

*Discussing *qi* on autumn nights (as I did before in my teachings on meditation),
*Returning home in late spring.*
*The crowd longs to go home endlessly,*
*But I cannot convey their feelings fully."*

The disciples **Ālìxiān** and others reported to the master: *"The southern route has abundant sand and stone, little water and grass—it wearies travelers and torments horses. We fear delays."*

The master replied: *"Divide into three groups to proceed; my disciples will face no harm."*

On the **seventh day of the fifth month**, he ordered **Song Dao’an, Xià Zhìchéng, Sòng Défāng, Mèng Zhìwēn, Hé Zhìjiān,** and **Pán Déchōng**—six men—to depart first.

On the **fourteenth day**, the master led **Yǐn Zhìpíng, Wáng Zhìmíng, Yú Zhìkě, Jū Zhìyuán, Yáng Zhìjìng,** and **Qí Zhìqīng**—six more—following them, with attendants like **Jiāgǔ Mì** (夹谷妃), **Guō Xuānchāi** (郭宣差), and **Lǐ Wànhù** (李万户), among dozens, seeing them off.

After twenty *lǐ*, all dismounted and knelt in farewell, weeping. The master urged his horse forward swiftly.

On the **eighteenth day**, **Zhāng Zhìsù, Sūn Zhìjiān, Zhèng Zhìxiū, Zhāng Zhìyuǎn,** and **Lǐ Zhìcháng**—five more—departed in succession.

The master traveled east for **sixteen days**, crossing a great mountain where snow lingered, the cold intense. He rode with ease atop **Fúlù** (拂庐).

On the **seventeenth day**, the master ate nothing, only sipping broth occasionally.

To the southeast, he passed a vast sandy plain where grass and trees grew, but swarms of mosquitoes and gnats made it unbearable. That night, he camped on the east bank of the river.

After several more days, the master sometimes rode in a carriage. **Yǐn Zhìpíng** and the others asked him: *"What ails you?"*

The master replied: *"My illness cannot be measured by medicine—it is the refining work of sages and worthies. Though it has not been cured, do not concern yourselves."*

The disciples were uneasy and would not let it go.

That evening, **Yǐn Zhìpíng** dreamed of a divine man who said: *"The master’s illness—do not worry, it will heal upon reaching Han land."*

Again, after traversing **three hundred *lǐ* of sandy path**, where water and grass were scarce, the horses pressed forward without rest at night.

They camped and rose early, now near the northern frontier of the **Shàrén** (夏人). As their encampments spread wider and horses became easier to obtain, the later travelers caught up with the master.

On the **twenty-first day of the sixth month**, they lodged at **Yúyáng Guān** (渔阳关), where the master still had not eaten.

The next day, after crossing the pass and traveling east for **fifty *lǐ* more**, the **Yuánshuài** (元帅) of **Fēngzhōu** (丰州) and his subordinates came to greet them. **Yú Xuānchāi** (俞宣差) invited them to rest at his home, offering broth and flatbread.

That day, the master ate heartily, then established a vegetarian meal, and his eating returned to normal.

The Daoist disciples said to one another: *"The divine dream of **Qīnghé** (清和) before was no false vision."*

By then, it was late summer. In the **north-facing chamber**, cool breezes filled the room. **Yú Xuānchāi** requested a written work, and the master inscribed:

*"My body is at ease, free from worldly thoughts,*
*Birds rest until the rooster’s cry.*
*One eye cannot sleep,*
*What binds my heart?*

*The clouds gather, the moon shines in the stream,*
*The *qi* is bright, the **Gǔshén** (谷神) is pure.*
*Not sitting at dawn or dusk,*
*Yet the practice twists and turns to completion.*

*On the first day of the seventh month*, he again set out.

The third day, he arrived at Xiàshuǐ (下水). The general, Jiāgǔ Gōng (夹谷公), came out of the city walls to greet him, and lodged him in his residence. More than a thousand people came to pay their respects.

The general said, *"I now hold you in even greater reverence."* He offered three chickens and three geese.

On the seventh night of the seventh month, the master strolled beyond the city walls, releasing them into the Hǎizǐ (海子) pond. Soon after, they soared and frolicked among the winds and waves, at ease and content.

The master composed a poem:
*"Nurture your life and preserve your heart to offer at the cook’s hearth,*
*When you meet my kindness, do not become my dish.*

*A slender boat sends you into the whale’s waves,*
*We shall meet again when autumn’s three months grow long and the sixth month arrives.*

*Two by two, three by three, good brothers in flight,*
*Yet autumn comes and your wings are not yet formed.*

*Release them to the deep blue sea,*
*Where vast waves and billows delight the wild spirit.*

The next day, he departed.

On the ninth day of that month, he arrived at Yúnzhōng (云中). The imperial courier, **Zǒngguǎn** (总管), **Ābùhé** (阿不合), along with the Daoist disciples, came out of the city walls to greet him, escorting him back to his residence with a palanquin.

For twenty days, he resided in the tower. The **Zǒngguǎn** and below, along with the Daoist disciples, attended morning and evening audiences. The officials of Yúnzhōng said, *"We have come to request your teachings,"* and presented him with poems, including:

*"Gaining your insight, I return home early,*
*Riding the spring breeze, I visit your creations.*

*The three Yang (三阳) begin their transformation,*
*One breath (一气) naturally surges and harmonizes.*

*Station horses escort me step by step,*
*Clouds and mountains surround me everywhere.*

*A million li to the capital city,*
*If I return, how will it be?"*

The **Zǒngguǎn** Ālǐxiān was then dispatched to the eastern mountains to summon and exhort the people, earnestly requesting to take along his Daoist disciple Yín Zhìpíng.

The Master said: *"The heavens do not yet permit it; though you go, what good will it do?"*

Ālǐxiān bowed twice and said: *"If the Prince should lead a great army against them, the common folk will surely suffer slaughter. I beg my revered teacher to speak a word of compassion."*

After a long silence, the Master said: *"Even if I cannot save them, it is still better than sitting idly by while they perish."*

He then ordered Qīnghé to accompany him, and gave him two copies of the exhortation scroll. He also heard that many Daoist disciples from the regions south of Xuāndé had come to pay respects, fearing that the randomness of the **Suì'ān** (随庵) would burden him in receiving them. He instructed Yín Gōng to organize and discipline them, and wrote in his own hand:

*"A journey of ten thousand li through the mortal realm,
Three years parted from my native land.
Turning back, my body is aged,
Passing before my eyes, dreams stretch long!

Vast the heavens, boundless the sky,
Affairs swirl, their fate uncertain.
From the south of the Yangzi to the northern passes,
Since ancient times, ever thus.

The Daoist disciples say:
Last winter, we saw the Master of Emptiness and Tranquility, Zhào Gōng, leading a horse into our gate.
We all went out to greet him, yet suddenly he vanished.
Again, in Déxīng and Āndìng, others have seen him.

The prefects and officers, along with all the scholars and commoners of the Heshuo states and counties,
Competed to send petitions, as if converging like spokes on a wheel.
I answered only with a few words.

Some say:
Before the Imperial House is at peace,
The Daoist Way first flourishes.
With boundless merit, the path opens wide,
All regional leaders and chiefs,
Devoted in heart, turn toward it.
Alas, I cannot multiply my form,
To fulfill each hope in kind.

On the first day of the tenth month,
I performed a grand exorcism at Lóngmén River.
On the fifteenth day,
I performed a grand exorcism at the local **Cháoyuán Guān** (朝元观).
On the fifteenth day of the eleventh month,
Sòng Défāng and others, moved by the vow they made on that day when they saw the white bones at Wild Fox Ridge,
Joined with the **Tàijūn** (太君) Yín Qiānbì to perform a grand exorcism at Déxīng’s **Lóngyáng Guān** (龙阳观),
To aid the lonely spirits in crossing.

In the days before, the weather grew slightly chill,
But once the grand exorcism was set,
For two nights and three days, it felt like spring.

After the exorcism concluded,
The **Yuànshuài** (元帅) Jiǎ Chāng arrived from his own encampment,
And conveyed the decree:
*"The Way of the Immortals spans spring to summer,
The path is not easy.
Are the provisions and courier horses satisfactory?
In Xuāndé and its surrounding regions,
Do the local officials attend to your lodging and grain?
Has the exhortation been received by those below?"*

I often think of the Immortals, and the Immortals never forget me.
On the twenty-sixth of the twelfth month, an exorcism was held at the Three Halls of **Yù Zhōu**, and the Master wintered at **Lóngyáng Guān**.
Morning and evening, I would often go there, strolling leisurely at **Lónggāng**, gazing down upon **Déxīng**, where after the wars, the villages lay desolate.
I composed poems to express my thoughts:
*"In years past, the woods towered heavenward, dense and vast,
Now the villages sprawl across the land, wide and open.
Countless common folk face the blade’s white edge,
How many grand halls now crumble to ash and gray?"*

And again:
*"Heroes lament in thousands of verses,
Yet how many have lived through the ages?"*

Delving into the subtleties beyond the material world,
I sought to escape the cycle of rebirth and earthly dust.

In the year **Jiāshēn**, on the first day of the second month,
An exorcism was held at **Qīushāng Guān** on **Jìnshān**.
The observatory stands on the southern slope of **Dàyìshān**,
Where clear waters and misty pines embrace the moonlit rocks—
A sacred ground for the Daoists.
I inscribed its essence in verse:
*"Behind **Qiúyáng Guān**, deep jade cliffs rise,
Ten thousand acres of mist and cloud pierce emerald peaks.
A single path where peach blossoms rush from rushing waters,
Curving streams flow through the heart of a cavernous paradise."*

And again:
*"A range of mountains, verdant and towering,
Where groups of Immortals pass night and day.
The hidden halls lie deep, no mortal treads within,
Yet sometimes the rock walls echo with songs of cave-dwelling Immortals."*

The **Yànjīng Xíngshěng** **Jīnzǐ Shílù Gōng**, along with the **Xuānchāi Liányì Liú Gōng** and other officials,
Sent envoys to humbly request that the Master reside at **Dàtiān Cháng Guān**.
He agreed, and later, when summoned by courier,
He crossed **Yùyōng Pass** to the south,
Where Daoist companions from **Yànjīng** welcomed him at **Shényóu Guān** in **Nánkǒu**.

The following morning,
Parents, elders, and common folk from all directions led the Master into the capital with incense and flowers,
And the roads were choked with those who came to pay their respects.

Earlier, when the Master had journeyed westward,
His disciples had asked when he would return.
The Master said: *"Three years, three years—*
*I shall return in three years."*
Now, as promised, he had kept his word.

Over the next seven days, he entered **Tiān Cháng Guān**, where a thousand people observed the fast.
On the next full moon, the assembly requested a visit to **Yùxū Guān**.
On the twenty-fifth of that month,
**Hèlá** arrived from the **Xínggōng**, bearing a decree:
*"When the Immortals reach the Han lands,
They purify and transform through the Dao.
Each day, they recite scriptures and bless my longevity—
This is most excellent.
Teach the Immortals to dwell in the places they love within the fields.
To **Ālǐxiān**: The Immortals’ lifespan is long,
And they excel in protection.
The Immortals must not forget my words."*

In midsummer,
The **Xíngshěng Jīnzǐ Shílù Gōng** and **Liányì Liú Gōng** repeatedly submitted petitions,
Requesting that the Master oversee **Dàtiān Cháng Guān**.
On the twenty-second of that month,
He accepted their plea, and as he departed northwestward,
A number of cranes led the way from the sky.

Since the Master’s stay at **Yùxū**,
He sometimes accepted invitations to private households for fasting rituals,
And cranes—three or five at a time—would often fly and call above them.
In the north, few had followed the Dao before,
But now, through the display of sacred transformations,
Even the wise and virtuous were turning toward it.

The eight assemblies all knelt and bowed,
Performing the rites of the Dao,
And the customs of the age shifted entirely.

The well water at **Yùxū** had once been bitter and salty,
But in the years **Jiāshēn** and **Yǒuyǒu**,
When Western Daoists arrived in great numbers,
The water’s taste changed to sweetness—a fortunate omen.

On the full moon of late summer,
The **Xuānchāi Xiànggōng** sent **Zhàbā** with an eight-part decree:
*"Since the Immortals departed,
I have not once forgotten them,
And the Immortals must not forget me.
Wherever I have lands or dwellings that I cherish,
Let the disciples always recite scriptures and pray for my blessings."*

Since the Master’s return,
Daoist companions from all directions gathered,
And false teachings faded.
The people of the capital flocked to him in devotion,
As if each household had received clear instruction—
Their doors opened wide, and the numbers swelled a hundredfold over before.

Eight assemblies were then established at **Tiān Cháng**:
**Píngděng**, **Chángchūn**, **Língbǎo**, **Chángshēng**, **Míngzhēn**, **Píng’ān**, **Xiāozāi**, and **Wànlián**.

After the Master returned to **Tiān Cháng**,
More distant Daoists came seeking his teachings and blessings.
He once revealed four verses to them:

The first:
*"Worldly passions know no end,
The **Dharma-realm** wears away.
Likes and dislikes ensnare the heart,
Dragging one adrift—what can be done?"*

The second:
*"There is a treasure before Heaven’s birth,
Nameless, yet not self-born.
The human heart lies hidden and suppressed,
While the **Dharma-realm** roams free."*

The third:
*"Chasing things, the eyes grow dizzy,
Toiling in life’s four elements leads to exhaustion.
The world is all illusion,
Yet the mind remains unaware of emptiness."*

The fourth:
*"Yesterday, I held nothing in restraint,
Today, my affairs are the same.
Better to let go entirely,
And pass the day in boundless void."*

After each fasting ritual,
He would wander to the old imperial gardens of **Qiónghuá**,
Accompanied by six or seven followers.
They would recline beneath the pines,
Sometimes composing poems in turn,
Or, after tea, ordering his attendants to sing a few verses of *Youxiān* songs.
As the sun dipped behind the mountains,
They would drift into a tranquil forgetfulness.

Thus,
The **Xíngshěng** and **Xuānchāi Zhàbā Xiànggōng** presented the northern gardens, ponds, and nearby lands—
Spanning tens of hectares—
And requested that they be made into a Daoist academy.
The Master declined at first,
But after repeated requests, he accepted.

Later, he issued an edict to prohibit firewood gathering,
And settled the Daoist companions there,
Overseeing repairs and improvements.
He then submitted a formal report, which the Emperor approved.

From that time onward,
On fine days and festive occasions,
The Master never failed to visit them.

On **Tomb-Sweeping Day**, he composed two poems:
The first:
*"A ten-acre pond lies quiet in the imperial garden,
Tall pines and cypresses shroud it in mist.
Pavilions and halls—all now dreams of the past,
While peach blossoms and willows belong to the Immortals in spring.
Beyond the isle, no purer place exists,
In the mortal world, only **Guǎnghán Tiān** compares.
I know the Creator’s design is fixed—
Why beg for fields to sow misfortune for officials and commoners?"*

The second:
*"At **Qīngmíng**, the apricot blossoms bloom,
Ten thousand doors and gates open and close each day.
Beyond the isle, the spring waters stretch vast and hazy,
While warm winds rustle through the pines.
Travelers sigh as the setting sun presses near,
Yet the enlightened linger, delaying the fleeting light.
How could I obtain the **Great Elixir** to transmute my bones?
And ascend, embodied, to the **Yùluó Terrace**?"*

The *jiǎyǒu* year, the Fourth Month—Lord Marshal Wang Jiuchuan of the Right Wing invited the Master to observe a fast at his residence. The Master, a native of the Right Wing, then spoke of the luxuriant bamboo and trees of Xianyang and Zhongnan Mountains, requesting the Master to inspect the courtyard bamboo.

The Master said: *"This bamboo is exceptionally fine. After the ravages of war and fire, such specimens are rare indeed. In my time at Pánxī, the dense forests and towering bamboo were a marvel beyond compare—now, I recall them as in a dream. Now old and my return approaching, I would take but a score of these stalks to plant in the northern veranda of Bǎoyuán, merely to shield my gaze."*

Lord Marshal Wang said: *"The realm still suffers from strife, its people hanging by a thread. The Sovereign now honors the Way and reveres the Master’s true teachings, relying on your virtue to safeguard all life. Why speak thus of departure?"*
He begged the Master to extend his compassion and prioritize saving the world.

The Master struck the ground with his staff, smiling as he replied: *"Heaven’s decree is fixed—what power lies in mortals?"*
None could fathom his meaning.

By the end of the Fifth Month, the Master ascended the peak of Shòulè Mountain. Gazing about, the gardens sprawled like emerald canopies, and travelers resting beneath them felt no trace of the scorching heat. There, he composed a *wǔyán* poem:

---
*Earth meets the frontier’s edge,*
*Its walls press ancient and modern.*
*Though palaces lie in ruin,*
*Fine gardens yet remain.*
*Green trees cluster thick,*
*Cool winds blow deep.*
*As if on an Isle of Immortals,*
*I survey the eight quarters, chanting.*
---

Later, upon the Master’s return from Qióngdǎo, Lord Chen Xiùyù came to pay his respects. The Master presented him with a *qīyán lǜ* poem:

---
*Crags rise steep and lone against Heaven,*
*Cypress shadows darkly clasp the halls.*
*Amyriads of mist and haze abide,*
*While rivers of wind and moon flow idle.*
*Pines soar from deep ravines,*
*Strange stones jut from the lake’s embrace.*
*All are the leisurely arts of longevity—*
*Refining virtue, offering blessings beyond the capital.*

---

On the auspicious ninth day of the Ninth Month, Lord Marshal Wang, seeing the *Yínghuǒ* star encroach upon the *Wěi* constellation—an omen of misfortune for the Yan lands—planned to request the Master perform an exorcism (*jiào*). He asked how much it would cost.

The Master replied: *"Even a single displaced thing stirs my pity—how much more an entire realm? For years, the people have suffered from levies and exhaustion, both public and private. I shall provide the necessities from the Observing Hall’s endowment, but let the court officials fast and purify themselves in preparation. Beyond that, I require nothing."*

Thus, the exorcism was set for two days and nights. Though aged, the Master personally prayed at the Mysterious Altar. When the rites concluded that evening, Lord Marshal Wang rejoiced, saying: *"The *Yínghuǒ* star has already retreated several degrees—we need fear no more!"*
How swift was the Master’s virtue in moving others!

The Master said: *"What virtue do I possess? Petitions to Heaven have existed since antiquity—only insincerity fails."* As the ancients said: *"Sincerity moves Heaven."* Such is the way.

On the Ninth of the Ninth, Daoist disciples from afar gathered, some bearing chrysanthemums as offerings. The Master composed a *cí* with a lament for delayed joy:

---
*A spirit-strain of singular nature,*
*Waiting for autumn winds to chill its roots.*
*Scattering blooms by the hundred billions,*
*Golden petals gleam—*
*Illuminating the void of Heaven and Earth.*
*On the Ninth, they fill the hall’s corners,*
*And all within see clearly,*
*As if gazing on eternal life,*
*Unwithering—*
*Fitting companions for idle repose.*

---

Soon after, a disciple of the Way arrived with silk scrolls, seeking the Master’s autograph. He inscribed them with the words of *"Fèngqī Dēngwú"*:

---
*To gain true rest is rest itself—*
*Winning leisure, free from toil.*
*How many bright and resolute souls*
*Have busied themselves in vain!*
*Heaven’s shifts know no end,*
*Yesterday’s song, today’s sorrow.*
*Who knows tomorrow’s affairs?*
*Why weary the mind over trifles?*

---

On another day, someone questioned the Master on a matter. He responded with detached indifference, resolving it with Daoist principle, then recited a verse for him:

---
*Brush, brush, brush—*
*Brush away all thoughts until none remain.*
*When the mind holds nothing,*
*That is the true person.*
*The true person is already an Immortal, a Buddha.*

The man, hearing this, bowed in awe and withdrew.

In the *bǐngxū* year’s First Month, officials from Pánshān invited the Master to perform a *Huángè* exorcism for three days and nights. That day, the sky cleared, hearts lightened, and spring stirred in the cold valleys. On the eve of the rites, he showed the assembly this poem:

---
*Twisted peaks plunge deep,*
*Mountains lift the weary soul.*
*Ridges vie in towering height,*
*Great ravines stretch vast and grim.*
*Seems some flying Immortal passes,*
*Yet no birds nest here.*
*Three days of yellow-crowned rites,*
*Ten thousand households in white attend.*

---

In the Fifth Month, the capital suffered a severe drought, and farmers could not sow. All feared for the harvest. Officials relocated the market and erected an altar for supplication, but for weeks, there was no response. The Provincial Governor sent envoys with a petition, requesting the Master perform a rain-pleading exorcism for three days and two nights.

On the night the rites were to begin, clouds gathered from all sides, and soon rain fell. From midnight until mealtime, it did not cease. The Provincial Governor’s envoys arrived with incense, thanking the Master: *"The capital has long endured drought, the countryside parched, crops unplanted, and the people near despair. Thanks to your virtue and communion with the Highest Truth, sweet dew has descended. The common folk say: ‘This is the rain of the Immortals.’"*

The Master replied: *"The Governor’s sincerity has moved the Highest Truth, who in turn has shown mercy to save all life. What part did I play?"*
The envoys departed, then returned with another message: *"The rain has fallen, yet the drought remains unrelieved! If only a torrential downpour could come—this drought would end. We beg the Master’s compassion."*

The Master said: *"Fear not. When mortals move Heaven with sincerity, Heaven answers in kind. The great rain will surely come."*

Before the fast concluded, the storm broke with overwhelming force. That year, the harvest came, and eminent scholars and officials sent poems in celebration.

Later, a certain Wu Dàqīng Déming presented four *jùjué* verses. The Master responded in rhyme.

Wu Dàqīng Déming’s four *jùjué* verses:

**First:**
In Yan’s moon-palace lies this very land,
Where the Transcendent Daoist peers stand.
At once the crane-carriage returns to Penglai’s isle,
A million kalpas’ incense rises from the earthen mound.

**Second:**
I dwell alone in the deep mountain’s embrace,
Who could know the world’s praise in its place?
The Yellow Emperor’s Daoist came to call,
Yet he spoke not of worldly books or talk.

**Third:**
Do not dismiss the idle as trifling,
For idle men, desireless, join the Celestial ranks.
If not here the mind’s ground is opened wide,
When shall you climb the Treasure Peak’s heights?

**Fourth:**
From Chaos’ origin, Nature’s Way unfolds,
The luminous spirit spans great and small.
Born and dying, ever without self,
Striding past and present, the Daoist’s ease.

On the painting of *San Xian* (One, Preserver, and Substance):
The perfected True Ones know no end to their Way,
Three Masters of old—where do their traces display?
Directly teaching the Celestial Treasury’s heir,
Their deeds in mortal realms rival *Chi Song*’s fame.

To a supplicant of the Dao, in seven-character verse:
Dawn and dusk rush past in fleeting haste,
Darkness swaps my life—my temples now threadbare.
The Creator’s jest with mortals is but a dream,
What then of yesterday’s strife—what purpose now?

Since receiving the provincial officials’ petition,
The Master pitied the Heavenly Long’s sacred halls and shrines,
Their dwellings crumbling—windows, steps, and walls in ruin.
He ordered his disciples: *“Let them repair what is broken,
Patch the leaks, straighten what leans.
Severed hands shall be restored anew.”*
He also built forty-plus lodgings,
No external aid—all from the monastery’s own means.

Each summer, he ordered the halls to forgo lamps,
Only in late autumn did he permit their use,
A precaution against fire.

In the tenth month, he resided in *Fanghu*,
Each evening summoning the assembled *Shide* in order,
Engaging in lofty discourse, sometimes till dawn.

On the thirteenth day of *zhōngdōng* (mid-winter),
He rose at midnight, pacing the courtyard.
Returning to his seat, he composed a five-character *lü* poem for the assembly:

*The cosmos vast beneath the boundless sky,
Three watches spent in toil upon the earth.
Shen’s asterism sinks behind the western peak,
The North Star turns—its axis high.*
*The great momentum cannot be restrained,
The boundless heavens hold no veil.*
*Who governs this eternal cycle’s reign?
A billion kalpas—unyielding, firm.*

In *dīnghài* (1387), drought persisted from spring to summer.
The officials prayed repeatedly, yet received no relief.
The Daoist assembly of the capital,
On one day, visited the Master for a rain-appeasing ritual.
Later, they also requested a disaster-dispelling assembly.

The Master said: *“I have devoted myself to these rites,
And now you propose the same—
Good intentions meet without prior agreement.
You two groups should only redouble your efforts.”*
He set the first day of the fifth month for the rain-appeasing ritual,
And the third day for the thanksgiving ritual.
If rain fell by the third day, it would count.
Even if it rained after, it would not be the ritual’s doing.

Some said: *“Heaven’s will is hard to fathom.
If the Master speaks thus, and the deadline passes,
Will he not invite slander from petty men?”*

The Master replied: *“This is beyond your understanding.”*
When the ritual was held, rain fell that very day.
The next day, it rained a foot deep,
And by the third day, the skies cleared entirely.
The thanksgiving ritual concluded as he had foretold.

At the time, the heat was oppressive.
General Zhang Zīyǔn invited the Master to West Mountain,
Where he visited the temple repeatedly.
The day after the fast ended, rain-soaked,
He toured the East Mountain Hermitage.
Seated with guests in the forest at dusk,
As evening fell, he composed an absolute verse for the assembly:

*West Mountain’s breeze is crisp and clear,
Post-rain clouds drift light as air.
A guest sits deep in the woods,
Without thought, the Dao takes root.*

Returning to General Zhang’s estate,
He stayed in the tower for several days,
Listening to Daoist teachings till dawn.

He also responded to invitations from Dàgǔ Hermitage,
Then to Qīngmèng Hermitage the next day.

That night, a great rain swept in from the north,
Thunder and lightning clashing violently.
The Master said: *“This is the Dao’s power.
Those who attain the Way wield radiant might—
Thunder and lightning cannot compare.
Night deepened, guests dispersed,
The Master reclined in the grass hall.
Soon, a terrifying wind and rain struck,
A single thunderclap nearly shattered the windows,
Then silence fell—all marveled.*

Some asked: *“If thunder were to strike, why cease so swiftly?”*
A respondent said: *“Could it be the presence of a Sage
Has caused the Thunderer to temper his wrath?”*

Later, on the twenty-fifth of the fifth month,
Daoist Wang Zhìmíng arrived from Qinzhou,
Bearing edicts to rename *Beigōng Xiāndǎo* as *Wàn’ān Gōng*,
And *Chángchūn Guàn* as *Chángchūn Gōng*.
The decree ordered all householders of virtue
To be enrolled under them,
And granted them the *Jīnhǔ Pái* (Golden Tiger Seal),
Thus all Daoist affairs were placed under the Celestial Masters’ jurisdiction.

After the *xiǎoshǔ* (minor heat) node,
Heavy rains fell repeatedly, easing the scorching heat.
He composed a seven-character poem for the assembly:

*Stifling summer chokes the land for ten thousand leagues,
Tidal waves crash against the seas and rivers’ rage.*
*The autumn harvest’s fine grains now swell in sight,
The drought-demon’s curse dissolves by the fifth month’s light.*
*The people rejoice—life’s hope restored anew,
The armies march without command’s decree.*
*Truly, the Dao’s influence knows no bounds,
Darkly bestowing abundance on the Holy Court.*

Since the *Qióngdǎo* became a Daoist academy,
Woodcutters and fishermen vanished for years,
While birds and fish thrived in the gardens and pools,
And visitors came and went without cease.

After the fast, the Master rode his horse on ordinary days.
On the twenty-first of the sixth month,
He fell ill and did not venture out,
Instead descending to the eastern stream of the palace.

On the twenty-third,
News arrived at noon—
A great thunderclap split the southern bank of *Tàiyè Pool*,
Flooding into the East Lake, its roar heard for tens of miles.
Turtles, crocodiles, fish, and crabs all fled,
The pool dried up entirely,
And the *Běikǒu Mountain* collapsed.

The Master heard this, at first saying nothing. After a long while, he laughed and said: *"When the mountain collapses and the pool dries, shall I go with it?"*

On the fourth of the seventh month, the Master told his disciples: *"In the past, Dānyáng once gave me a prophecy, saying: After my death, the Daoist teaching shall flourish greatly, and the four quarters shall often be transformed into Daoist lands. You, Gongzhèng, are now in that time. The Daoist academies have all been granted imperial names and quotas. You shall also reside in the grand temples and observatories, with envoys bearing seals and official dispatches to oversee the teaching. This is the moment when your merit is complete, your name established, and you may retire in peace. Every word of Dānyáng’s prophecy has come true, as if sealed by fate itself. Moreover, within the teaching, all matters of administration—both internal and external—are now fully settled. I depart without any regrets."*

When the Master revealed his illness in Bǎoyuán, on that day, his breath came in shallow gasps. His disciples tried to stop him, but he said: *"I do not wish to trouble others. You still have your duties to attend to. What difference does it make if I rest in the coffin?"*

On the seventh of the seventh month, his disciples again pleaded: *"Each day, the assembly of devotees is vast. We beg you to extend your great compassion and return to the hall, that we may pay our respects."*

The Master replied: *"I shall ascend the hall on the ninth day."*

That day, in the afternoon, he composed this farewell verse:

*"Life and death, dawn and dusk—all one affair,*
*Like bubbles rising and vanishing in endless water.*
*Where faint light shines, the hare and crow leap,*
*When measure is set, mountains and seas are contained.*
*With a wave, the eight extremes shrink to inches,*
*With a breath, ten thousand things move like mechanisms.*
*Mad words spill like dust beneath the brush,*
*Left for the foolish ears of this fleeting age."*

Then, he ascended the Bǎoguāng Hall and departed in truth, filling the room with strange fragrance. His disciples lit incense and bowed in farewell. As they wept, attendants Zhāng Zhìsù and Wǔ Zhìjù hurried to stop them, saying: *"The True Person has left behind instructions: Let Sòng Dào’ān oversee the teaching, Yǐn Zhìpíng assist him, Zhāng Zhìsōng next, and Wáng Zhìmíng continue his former duties. Sòng Défāng and Lǐ Zhìcháng shall also deliberate on teaching matters."* They then recited the farewell poem again, and Sòng Dào’ān and the others bowed twice in acceptance.

At dawn, they donned mourning robes and performed funeral rites. Tens of thousands rushed to attend the funeral.

When the imperial envoy Liú Zhònglù heard of this, he was stunned and sighed: *"Since the True Person’s audience with the sovereign, the bond between ruler and subject was harmonious. After his departure from the capital, the emperor’s affection never waned. Now that the Master has ascended, I must swiftly report this."*

After the first seven days of mourning, Daoists and lay devotees from all directions arrived to attend the funeral, grieving as if for a lost parent.

Thus, those seeking instruction in the Dao’s name grew ever more numerous.

One day, the overseer Sònggōng said to Zhìcháng: *"This month’s seventh day marks when you and I together received the Master’s final teachings. Matters of the Dao’s name and such—you shall draft the documents in my handwriting and seal them with my mark. This practice shall continue as before."*

Soon after, the Pure Harmony Master Yǐngōng arrived from Déxīng to conduct the rites. When the seven days of mourning concluded, the overseer Sònggōng said to Pure Harmony: *"I am old and cannot uphold the Dao’s affairs. You may now take my place and lead them."* After declining twice, Pure Harmony accepted the charge, and near and far, those who followed the Way gathered, their numbers no fewer than before.

On the first day of the third month of the *Wùzǐ* year, Pure Harmony proposed building a hall for the Master at Báiyún Guàn. Some objected: *"The labor is immense, and provisions scarce—this may not succeed."* Pure Harmony replied: *"All things must be considered beforehand. Though one may share in success, one cannot share in planning from the start. If the matter serves no private gain and the Dao’s community exerts its full strength, what cannot be accomplished? Moreover, the Master’s enduring virtue remains with the people—who among the four quarters would not revere him? No need for further persuasion; there will be those who spontaneously aid this cause. If not, let the common funds be exhausted, and each take only a single ladleful—this would be my wish."*

The imperial envoy Liúgōng, hearing this, rejoiced and lent his full support. He then commissioned Jūzhì Yuányuán and others to oversee the work. From the fourth month’s *Dīng* day, they cleared the site and laid the foundation, spanning the *Wù*, *Jǐ*, and *Gēng* months. Soon, Daoists from Píngyáng, Tàiyuán, Jiān, Dài, Yù, and Yìng—over two hundred in total—brought provisions and labor, willingly constructing the hall. In forty days, the work was complete, though the names of all who contributed cannot be fully recorded. Some remarked that though human effort achieved the structure, the sages’ unseen influence must have sustained it.

The grand burial was set for the ninth day of the seventh month. Throughout June, incessant rain fell, raising fears it would disrupt the rites. On the seventh day’s first auspicious moment, word came of clear skies, and all hearts rejoiced in harmony. The day before, at the rites’ outset, incense was lit and offerings set forth to solemnize the ceremony. When the coffin was opened, the Master’s form remained intact, as if alive. Officials and commoners, monks and nuns, and all who gathered—over ten thousand across three days—pressed their hands to their brows in awe of his divine presence. News spread far and wide, drawing countless devotees to pay their respects, beyond number.

The temple then established a three-day *Fèng’ān* Daoist ritual, announcing a ten-day fast in advance. On the ninth day, at the *Chén* hour, a [Playen] *Xuànhè* crane arrived from the southwest, followed by a white crane, startling all who beheld them. After the *Zǐ* hour, a *Língbǎo Qīngjiào* exorcism was performed for the 360 degrees of the cosmos. When the rites concluded, the Master’s immortal remains were enshrined in the hall, filling the air with an unearthly fragrance that lingered for hours. At noon, the *zhāi* (vegetarian repast) was offered, with thousands in yellow robes and ceremonial attire, and ten thousand more adherents in attendance. After the rites, on the following day, heavy rain fell anew. All marveled: *"Heaven and earth, above and below, in perfect accord—this great affair could not have been accomplished were it not for the Master’s virtue, complete and transcendent, harmonizing with the cosmos and the divine. Who else could achieve such wonders? Truly, this surpasses mere human power."*

The provisional chancellor and pacification commissioner, Wánggōng Jùchuān of Hányáng, a scion of the great clans, had long admired the [Playen] *Xuànhè* tradition. In recent years, he had also met with the Master’s father in Yān, sharing kindred spirit and aligned Dao. His reverence now exceeded even his past devotion. Thus, for this burial, he took the lead. Across the capital and its outskirts, troops were stationed, prepared for any contingency.

The Master then dismissed them, and there was no disturbance at all.

At that time, he inscribed upon his hall: **"Chùshùn"** (处顺), and upon his observatory: **"Bái Yún"** (白云焉). The Master composed texts without first drafting outlines—at the moment of writing, his brush flowed freely and the works were complete. Later, when others sought his teachings, he sometimes added or subtracted to them himself, thus preserving both versions.

Once, in a night conversation, he spoke to his disciples, saying: *"The ancient ones who attained the Dao, those recorded in books and annals, were briefly mentioned but not fully transmitted. Those who lost their transmission—how many could they truly recount? I have often spoken to your assembly of the Dao-attainers of recent times, all those whom I have seen and heard in person, whose deeds and words are most detailed and whose teachings are most clear. In my leisure, I intended to compile the Complete Transmission of the True Dao to bequeath it to future generations. Since the Master’s passing, though I have occasionally spoken of its essence, the scholars of later times have yet to see its written form—alas, what a pity!"*

His disciples who followed him were:
**Xūjìng** (虚静) Mr. Zhào Dàojiān (赵道坚),
**Chōngxū** (冲虚) Master Sòng Dào’ān (宋道安),
**Qīnghé** (清和) Master Yǐn Zhìpíng (尹志平),
**Xūjí** (虚寂) Master Sūn Zhìjiān (孙志坚),
**Qīngzhēn** (清贞) True Person Xià Zhìchéng (夏志诚),
**Qīngxū** (清虚) Master Sòng Défāng (宋德方),
**Bǎoguāng** (葆光) Master Wáng Zhìmíng (王志明),
**Chōngxū** (冲虚) Master Yú Zhìkě (于志可),
**Chóngdào** (崇道) Master Zhāng Zhìsù (张志素),
**Tōngzhēn** (通真) Master Jū Zhìyuán (鞠志圆),
**Tōng｛yuán｝［xuán］** (通元) Master Lǐ Zhìcháng (李志常),
**Yīzhēn** (颐真) Master Zhèng Zhìxiū (郑志修),
**｛Yuán｝［Xuán］zhēn** (玄真) Master Zhāng Zhìyuǎn (张志远),
**Wùzhēn** (悟真) Master Mèng Zhìwěn (孟志稳),
**Qīngzhēn** (清真) Master Qí Zhìqīng (綦志清),
**Bǎozhēn** (保真) Master Hé Zhìqīng (何志清),
**Tōng｛yuán｝［xuán］** (通元) Master Yáng Zhìjìng (杨志静),
and **Chōnghé** (冲和) Master Pān Déchōng (潘德冲).

Four Mongols were specially granted to serve as his disciples and guardians:
**Měnggǔ Dǎ** (蒙古打),
**Hē Lā Bāhǎi** (喝剌八海),
**Xuānchāi Ālìxiān** (宣差阿里鲜),
and **Xuānchāi Biànyíshǐ Liú Zhònglù** (宣差便宜使刘仲禄).

**Imperial Edict** (Appendix to *Records of the Western Journey of the Long Spring True Person*, *Homage to the Master of the Homogeneous Book* First Edition)
The **Chéngjīsī** (成吉思) Emperor decreed to the True Person Qiū Shī (丘师):

*"I have fully taken note of your petition in response to my summons. Indeed, the Master: his Dao surpasses that of the Three Sons, his virtue is profound and manifold. I command my ministers to honor your original credentials and dispatch swift messengers to seek you among the distant seas. At this time, your wishes align with Heaven’s—no distance is too great for mortals. Though summoned by two courts and yet you did not come, a single envoy’s invitation sufficed for you to rise. You say that my Heavenly mandate is the reason you return. You do not shirk exposure to wind and frost, willingly enduring toils upon the sands. When your letter arrived, my joy and relief were boundless! Matters of war and statecraft are not what I seek; rather, it is the heart of Dao and virtue that truly merits praise. That chieftain’s insolence has been met with my retribution. Now, as the armies take the field and the borders are secured, your coming and departure are but a matter of natural force—long absent, now briefly present, I hope he will submit in spirit before I cease. Thus, I bear your fame and virtue aloft, and momentarily halt my troops. I recall that the Cloud Pavilion was launched from Penglái (蓬莱), and the Crane Chariot may traverse the lands of Tiānzhú (天竺). When Dharma advanced eastward, the True Seal of the Original Print was transmitted to the heart; when the Old Master journeyed westward, he sometimes transformed the barbarians and attained the Dao. Though the paths may be wide, gazing upon your staff and sandals, they are not distant. Hence, I reply to your letter to make clear my intent. In this autumn heat, may the Master’s peace be as good as ever, and may his fingers not tire from writing."*

**Sacred Decree**, the first of four (Appendix to *Records of the Western Journey of the Long Spring True Person*, *Homage to the Master of the Homogeneous Book* First Edition)
The **Chéngjīsī** (成吉思) Emperor’s Sacred Decree to all officials of every region:

*"The abodes and halls of practice where the Qiū Immortal (丘神仙) has resided—these are the places where, day and night, the people have recited scriptures and prayed to Heaven, offering congratulations to the Emperor for his countless years of longevity—all such places, large or small, are hereby exempted from all taxes and levies. As for those who falsely claim to be his out-family disciples (出家门人) and occupy these halls, if they are reported to the authorities, they shall be prosecuted and punished. Officials who receive this decree must not disobey; they must strictly adhere to its provisions. This is hereby entrusted to the Master’s disciples for execution."*

**Second [Edict] (Appendix to *The Longchun True Person’s Western Journey*, from the *Homogeneous Book* First Edition)**
To the officials in charge of these matters:
All those who are truly the **Qiū Immortal’s** (丘神仙) out-family disciples (出家门人), and those who maintain his halls and abodes with strict discipline—all are hereby exempt from taxes and levies.
This is in accordance with the above decree.
**Gǔwèi Year** (癸未, the Year of the Sheep), third month.

**Third [Edict] (Appendix to *The Longchun True Person’s Western Journey*, from the *Homogeneous Book* First Edition)**
By imperial order: The **Qiū Immortal** (丘神仙) reports that his affairs have arrived—this is indeed well done.
I have already sent imperial decrees regarding this matter to you, ordering you to oversee all virtuous out-family disciples (出家善人) across the realm—good or bad, you should handle them as **Qiū Immortal** (丘神仙) sees fit.
Understand this well. You are hereby entrusted with such matters.
**Gǔwèi Year** (癸未), ninth month, twenty-fourth day.

**Fourth [Edict] (Appendix to *The Longchun True Person’s Western Journey*, from the *Homogeneous Book* First Edition)**
By imperial order to **Du Yuànshuài** (都元帅, Grand Marshal) **Jiǎ Chāng** (贾昌):
**Qiū Immortal** (丘神仙), when you set out in the spring, you should arrive by the summer months. The road is hot and arduous—are there suitable inns along the way for riding horses?
Is there ample food and drink on the route?
When you arrive at **Xuāndé Zhōu** (宣德州) and its surrounding regions, will the officials treat you well?

**Translation:**

How are the common folk faring below?
I often ponder you, Immortal—never have I forgotten you.
Do not forget me either.

**Gǔwèi Year**, eleventh month, fifteenth day.

**Petition in Three Parts, the First**
To **Shílù Gōng** (石抹公), Chancellor of the **Yànjīng** (燕京) Secretariat:
With deepest respect, I humbly request that **Chángchūn Zhēnrén** (长春真人) reside at **Tiāncháng Guàn** (天长观):

For only when there are **perfected ones** does the inner mystery unfold;
Only when there are **celestial halls** can the wayfarers of the outer world be received.

**Tiāncháng Guàn** is the **Purple Bureaus of the human realm**, the **Field of Blessings above**.
Who but a true **Immortal** could claim this sacred ground?

Beholding **Chángchūn Zhēnrén**:
His wisdom transcends all ranks,
His Dao comprehends eternal life.
His tongue bears the scent of blossoms and trees,
His heart is free of dust and worldly breath.

He is the **eye of heaven and earth**, the **bridge for the common world**.
Once, he rode the **Azure Ox westward**, unafraid to ascend to the Celestial Court;
Now, bearing the **Purple Edict**, he returns southward—just the time to **transmit the Dao**.

Do not decline too much; grant your presence soon.
This petition is respectfully submitted.

**Translation:**

**In the Year Gengwu, the Eighth Month**

**The Second [Record of Master Zhēnrén’s Western Journey, Appendix]**

The Pacification Commissioner and Grand Censor, **Wang**, respectfully invites **Master Zhēnrén** to preside over the **Great Tiāncháng Guàn** of the Ten Directions in **Yanjing**:

*"To tame the divine dragon’s transformations, mere hoofbeats cannot suffice;
A wild crane without intent—what sky cannot it traverse?
Thus, **Zhuāngzi** wandered freely, and **Lǐ Sī**’s worth increased in the lacquer garden;
**Chén Tuān** returned to seclusion, and **Yán Lì** shone upon the Cloud Terrace.
Without such figures, such deeds would never be accomplished.*

*Master Zhēnrén, your virtue is pure and refined, your Dao vast and lofty.
Already inscribed in the **Vermilion Gate’s** annals, now briefly exiled beneath the **Jade Flask’s** decree.
You treat a thousand years as morning and evening, the eight extremes as your threshold.
You uphold the **Chronicle’s** ancestral wind, bearing the **Quánzhēn** seal’s authority.
Once, you were the **Three Dynasties’** teacher of the **Dao**,
Now, you are the **Ten Thousand Chariots’** national preceptor.

For several years, you answered the imperial summons and journeyed north,
Originally intending to settle the land’s tranquility;
Yet suddenly turning southward, could you now seek only your own virtue in **Shāndōng’s** mountains?

The **Tàijí’s** ancient palace stands—
The grandest structure of **Dàyàn’s** domain.
Where the nation’s **celestial pillar** resides,
The first model for all, near and far.

If we wish to establish a foundation for welcoming others,
As though settling upon the **Chief Capital’s** finest land,
Then I dare to offer my humble counsel,
Hoping you might briefly rest beneath the **Rainbow Banners**.

May the clouds part across ten thousand *lǐ*,
Fulfilling the hopes of heaven and humankind;
May the winds stir from all four directions,
Spreading the fragrance of **Dao** and **virtue**.

Respectfully submitted.
**In the Year Gengwu, the Eighth Month.**

**The Third [Appendix to *The True Person of Eternal Spring’s Western Journey*], from the *Tsungshu Chicheng* edition:**

The **Shāngshū** of **Yànjīng**, **Shímò Gōng**, respectfully petitions that the **Qiū Immortal** long abide at **Tiāncháng Guàn**:

In truth, though even the Sage may pause when necessary, the virtuous man’s heart is steadfast. Between these two paths, the greater purpose prevails.

The **True Person of Eternal Spring**—
A disciple of **Zhōngyáng’s** highest rank, renowned across the four seas.
He is the **Emperor’s** honored teacher, the **world’s** guiding father.
Once, he answered the imperial summons,
Returning from a ten-thousand-*lǐ* journey to **Xīnsī Gān**.
Now, to welcome others,
He should long reside at **Tiāncháng Guàn**, the **Ten Directions’** hall.

Above, he blesses the **Sovereign’s** sacred longevity;
Below, he nurtures the **people’s** field of blessings.
Recently, through petty scrutiny,
He did not dare wield his **Immortal Staff** in defiance—
Yet now, the **Venerable Master** has stirred such thoughts.

Consider **Jīngshī**—
The root of **Zhōuxià**, where all take their measure.
To abandon this for another is to descend from the **Qióu** and enter the **Yōu**.
I dare to urge his firm retention,
Hoping he will not easily depart.

Let him rest in tranquility, unburdened by deep mountain valleys;
Let him endure eternally, as **Tàijí’s** lord of **Qiónghuá’s** splendor.

Respectfully submitted.
**In the Year Bìxū, the Eighth Month.**
