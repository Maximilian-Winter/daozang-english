# 周易参同契

*The Kinship of the Three in Accordance with the Zhou Changes*

The Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the Changes, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Kan and Li frame their enclosure, turning the hub and aligning the axle.

The four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and pipes, covering and veiling the Dao of yin and yang. Like a master charioteer, they hold to the marking line, grasp the reins and bit, align the compass and square, and follow the wheel tracks. Abiding in the center, they govern what lies without. Their reckoning is kept in the pitch-pipes and calendrical records. The lunar phases have five and six, warp and weft attend the sun’s command, and together they make sixty. The firm and yielding have outer and inner.

At dawn of the new moon, *Zhun* takes up its duty; by dusk, *Meng* receives its charge. Day and night each have their hexagram, used in due sequence. Before the month’s end, when darkness gives way to dawn, the cycle concludes and begins anew. The sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late.

Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. Autumn and winter turn to outer use, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments accord with spring and autumn; dusk and dawn follow cold and heat. The line statements hold benevolence and righteousness, releasing joy and anger in due season. Thus they respond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principle.

Heaven and Earth establish their positions, and the Changes move within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun. Establishing positions means arranging the stations where yin and yang are paired. The Changes speak of Kan and Li. Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun. These two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids. Coming and going are not fixed; above and below are also without constancy. Hidden and submerged, they transform within, enfolding the myriad things and serving as the warp and woof of the Dao.

By nonbeing they govern being; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness. Thus, in tracing waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish and perish.

Words are not idly fashioned; theories do not arise in vain. They draw on verification and evidence, measuring and comparing with spirit illumination. They infer categories and structure graphs, taking the original principles as proof. Kan is the essence of the moon, *wu*; Li is the radiance of the sun, *ji*. Sun and moon are the Changes; the firm and yielding are matched. Earth rules the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, white, and black each dwell in their quarter, all receiving from the central palace the work of *wu* and *ji*.

The Changes are images. Among suspended images, none are more luminous than the sun and moon. Exhausting the spirit, one knows transformation. When yang departs, yin arrives; spokes gather and the wheel turns. Emerging and entering, they coil and uncoil. The Changes have three hundred and eighty-four lines. Based on the lines, one selects the tally. The tally refers to the sixty-four hexagrams. From the dark of the moon to dawn of the new moon, *Zhen* comes to receive the tally. At this moment, Heaven and Earth mingle their essences; sun and moon mutually grasp and hold. The male yang scatters its dark offering; the female yin transforms the yellow womb. Chaos intermingles; the root foundation is planted. Cultivating and nourishing the bud, concentrating the spirit to form the body, the multitude tread forth, and none that wriggle and move do not proceed from this.

Thus Confucius praised the Primal Chaos: "The virtue of Qian and Kun pervades the void." Investigating antiquity, he matched the primordial sovereign. The *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning. The marriage cap and sash intertwine their qi; the first year then sprouts and flourishes.

The sage is not born in vain. Above, he observes the manifest celestial tally. The celestial tally has advance and retreat, bending and stretching in response to the seasons. Thus the Changes unify the mind of Heaven.

The *Fu* hexagram establishes the beginning of sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; relying on the mother, he sets the initial foundation. Waning and waxing respond to the bell and pitch-pipe; ascent and descent rely on the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, it emerges as dawn. *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*; the first quarter is level as a cord. On the fifteenth, the stem’s body is complete; fullness abounds in *Jia* of the east. The toad and the hare’s soul—sun and moon’s qi shine doubly bright. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s node; the hare spews forth its radiance. The seventh and eighth lines’ path is complete; bending and curving, they descend.

On the sixteenth, the turning receives its mandate. *Xun* and *Xin* appear in the level dawn. *Gen* points straight to *Bing* in the south. The last quarter is the twenty-third; *Kun* and *Yi* on the thirtieth day. In the northeast, it loses its companion. When the node is exhausted, they mutually yield. The succeeding body then gives birth to the dragon again.

*Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*; Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. These four combine to make thirty. The yang qi seeks extinction and concealment. The eight trigrams array their luminaries; their movement shifts without losing the center.

The primal essence is subtle and hard to perceive. One infers and measures, verifying with tally and proof. Abiding, one observes its image; by analogy, one models its form. Setting up markers as standards, one divines and determines good and ill fortune. Issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one does not miss the time of the moving lines. Above, one examines the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, one orders the flows of earth’s forms. In the center, one investigates the human mind, comparing and considering the Three Powers. In movement, one follows the hexagram’s nodes; in stillness, one relies on the hexagram’s judgment. Qian and Kun are put into practice, and then Heaven and Earth are ordered. Can one fail to be cautious?

At the outset of governing, one grasps the subtle and dense. Opening and spreading, one displays the treasure, holding fast to the essential Dao’s handle and pivot, unifying transformation’s warp and woof. The line images move within; good and ill fortune arise without. The five planets interweave in sequence, responding to the seasons’ stimuli. When the four and seven are perverse and contrary, they separate and unite, bow and rise.

*Wenchang* oversees the records, interrogating and holding accountable the terrace and assistants. The hundred officials and functionaries each govern their departments.

The sun combines the essence of the Five Phases; the moon receives the record of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing the beginning and grasping the end, one holds the thread of survival and extinction. If the ruler is arrogant and excessive, overbearing and full, he violates the Dao. If the minister is devious and obsequious, his conduct does not follow the track, the waxing and waning of the crescent and full moon go awry, and perverse changes bring ill fortune. Enforcing the law, one admonishes and criticizes, interrogating transgressions and leaving them to the ruler.

The Pole Star receives its rectitude, at ease and yielding to what lies below. The Bright Hall promulgates governance; the state has no harmful Dao. Within, one nourishes oneself, calm and empty of desire. Tracing the root and grasping the origin, one inwardly illuminates the body’s form. Closing and sealing its orifices, one fortifies the numinous root. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity; one warms and nourishes the child-pearl. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easy to seek.

---

The Yellow Center gradually permeates the principles, moistening and nourishing to reach the skin. At first rectified, then finally cultivated—once the stem is established, the end may be upheld. The One is thus concealed, unknown to the world.

The supreme virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through scrutiny. The lesser virtue labors, its function unceasing. When the upper is sealed, it is called "being"; when the lower is sealed, it is called "non-being." Non-being serves the upper, where the numinous virtue resides. These two apertures follow the method: the qi of Metal also requires the other.

To know the white and guard the black is to invite the advent of spirit clarity. The white is the essence of Metal; the black is the foundation of Water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One—the inception of yin and yang. The profound contains the Yellow Sprout, master of the Five Metals, the River Chariot of the North. Thus lead appears black without, yet harbors golden radiance within. Cloaked in coarse cloth, jade is concealed; outwardly, one seems a madman.

Metal is the mother of Water; the mother conceals the child’s embryo. Water is the child of Metal; the child shelters within the mother’s womb. The Perfected One is most wondrous, as if present, as if absent—vaguely resembling the great abyss, now sinking, now floating. Withdrawing, they disperse and spread, each guarding their own domain.

Gathered, it resembles the white; refined, it becomes vermilion. Tempered, it forms the protective guard, with white within and steadfastness dwelling at the core. Square or round, a span in diameter, blended yet mutually constrained.

Before Heaven and Earth took form, it stood majestic and exalted.
Encircled by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai’s isle.
All around, barriers seal fast—four paths yet hesitant to tread.
Guardianship is firm and tight, barring all deceit and evil.
Winding chambers connect within, a warning against the unforeseen.
Here, no need for anxious thought, nor room for sorrow’s toil.
The chamber brims with spirit and qi, yet none can detain them.
Those who preserve it flourish; those who lose it perish.
In motion and stillness, rest and wakefulness, it ever attends mankind.

This is no method of the hidden treasuries.
Inward vision stirs reflection; pacing steps trace the lunar lodges.
The Six Jia follow the celestial stems, while the Yin Way suppresses nine with one.
Chaos disturbs the primordial womb; ingesting qi sets the bowels rumbling.
Exhale the true, inhale the external evil; day and night, sleep never comes.
From dark to new moon, never a pause—body wearies by the day,
bewildered, seeming half-mad. The hundred vessels seethe and race,
denied the clarity of stillness. Piling earth to raise altars,
morning and evening they reverently sacrifice. Ghostly forms appear,
haunting dreams with sighs. The heart rejoices, the mind delights,
self-assured of long life—yet suddenly death claims them,
their bodies left to rot and decay. Every action brings error,
perverse and awry, losing the pivot of the Way.
Such doctrines abound, a thousand strands, ten thousand more,
all retreating from the Yellow and the Old, twisting against the Nine Capitals.

The wise discern their intent, suddenly grasping the source.
Diligent in practice, day and night without rest,
after three years of ingestion, they ascend lightly on distant journeys.
Fire cannot scorch them; water cannot drench.
They master presence and absence, ever joyful, free from care.
The Dao is perfected, virtue complete—hidden, they await their time.
The Great One summons them, relocating to the Central Isles.
With merit fulfilled, they ascend, receiving registers and charts.

The *Fire Records* are no empty fabrication; the *Yi* expounds them clearly.
The crescent moon shapes the crucible and furnace; the White Tiger governs the refining pivot.
Mercury, the sun’s flowing pearl, is joined by the Azure Dragon.
Raising the East to meet the West, hun and po naturally unite.
The waxing crescent, Dui’s number eight; the waning crescent, Gen’s eight as well.
When the two crescents merge their essence, the body of Qian and Kun is formed.
Two eights make one *jin*; the Dao of the *Yi* stands firm and unshaken.
A *zhu* holds three hundred eighty-four, matching the hexagrams’ lines.

Gold enters fierce fire, yet its luster remains undiminished.
Since the dawn of creation, sun and moon have never lost their brightness.
Gold does not forfeit its weight; sun and moon retain their forms.
Gold is born from the moon, at new moon receiving the sun’s tally.
Gold returns to its mother; at moon’s end, sun and moon embrace.
Concealing its frame, it sinks into the cavernous void.
Gold regains its original nature; the crucible’s radiance shines anew.

The numbers of Zi and Wu combine to three; Wu and Ji are called five.
When three and five harmonize, the Eight Stones serve as the guiding principle.
Breath and thought crave each other, lingering as husband and wife.
Yellow earth is gold’s father; flowing pearl, water’s mother.
Water treats earth as its ghost; earth subdues water’s rise.
The Vermilion Bird is fire’s essence, holding balance to weigh victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished.

All perish and return to the thick earth.
When the Three Natures unite, their original essence shares a common ancestor.

Sesame still prolongs life; returning cinnabar may be taken by mouth.
Gold’s nature never decays, thus it is the treasure of all things.
Alchemists ingest it, and their lifespan is long.
Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and setting its rules.
Golden sand enters the five viscera, dispersing like mist or rain.
Steaming through the four limbs, complexion becomes bright and fair.
White hair turns black again; fallen teeth regrow in their old place.
Old men regain youthful vigor; aged women become maidens.
Transformed in form, they escape worldly calamities—these are called Perfected Persons.

Lead powder cast into fire changes color and reverts to lead.
Ice and snow warmed by hot water dissolve into the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from its true nature; beginning and end follow one another.
To become an immortal through ingestion, one must use substances of the same kind.
Plant millet to grow millet; hatch chickens with their own eggs.
Like supports the natural, and things form easily.
Fish eyes are not pearls; fleabane does not become catalpa.
Like follows like; discordant things do not yield treasure.
Thus, swallows and sparrows do not bear phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse horses.
Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward.

The world abounds with scholars, men of lofty talent.
Yet chance meetings elude them, and their fires consume their wealth.
Clinging to texts, they follow words blindly, imposing their own interpretations.
Their threads lack cause or connection; their measures lose control.
They pound chalcanthite, mica, arsenolite, and sulfur, burning camphorwood.
They mix and smelt, flying in confusion.
They blow bellows over malachite, using it as a pivot.
Mixed natures of different kinds—how can they dwell as one?
A thousand attempts yield ten thousand failures; seeking cunning, they become fools.
Fortune never favors them, for only the sage truly knows.
From youth to white-haired age, midway they grow doubtful.
Turning from the Way, they cling to delusion, stepping from the right path into crooked byways.
Peering through a tube, their vision is narrow; they cannot gauge what lies ahead.

As for the utmost sages, none surpass Fu Xi.
He first drew the Eight Trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth.
King Wen, ancestor of emperors, structured the hexagrams and composed their judgments.
Confucius, the near-sage hero, added the Ten Wings to aid them.
These three lords were Heaven’s chosen, rising in succession to govern their times.
Though their ranks differ, their merit and virtue are not unequal.
Their works follow in succession, weighing and measuring with care.
The tangible is easy to reckon; the formless is hard to plan.
Their deeds set models for emulation, establishing the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents* for the world.
Without innate foresight, each grasped truth through their teachers.
Bright as lifting the curtain, they opened their eyes and ascended the high terrace.

The *Fire Canon* spans six hundred chapters, yet its aims are not diverse.
Its words are solemnly expounded, but people do not ponder deeply.
Tracing its source, darkness and light originally dwell together.
I speak discreetly to the wise—how dare I treat this lightly in writing?
If I were to seal my lips in silence, cutting off the Way, I would incur guilt and punishment.
Yet to inscribe my thoughts on bamboo and silk risks leaking Heaven’s tally.
Hesitating, I sigh, bowing my head to record this folly.
Refinement has its methods; I cannot bear to lay them all bare.
I sketch only the guiding principles; the branches and leaves will appear in due course.

Use gold as a dike; let water enter and flow freely.
Gold’s reckoning is fifteen; water’s number is the same.
Before the furnace, fix the weights: water exceeds by five parts.
Both are taken as true; gold’s weight remains as at first.
The third does not enter; fire accompanies the two.
The three substances unite and receive one another, transforming mightily like spirits.
Below lies the qi of Great Yang, steaming in an instant.
First it liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.
As years and months draw to an end, nature is destroyed, and lifespan harmed.
The body becomes ash and earth, like dust on a bright window.

Pound and blend them, then hold them through the vermilion gate.
Seal their meeting firmly, striving for perfect solidity.
Kindle fire below, day and night, its sound steady and diligent.
Begin with the civil, end with the martial; at first, refine with care.
In the end, display martial force.
Observe and tend with utmost caution, adjusting warmth and coolness.
Cycle through the twelve nodes; when one ends, attend closely again.
When qi is exhausted and life nears its end, rest and death claim the soul.
The color shifts to purple, and suddenly returning cinnabar forms.
Ground to powder, shaped into a single pill, the spatula’s measure is most potent.

Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases, concise yet not cumbersome:
Strike fire with water, and its light is suddenly extinguished.
Sun and moon press upon each other, ever between darkness and dawn.
When water prevails, Kan encroaches on Yang; when fire wanes, Li’s day grows dim.
Yin and Yang consume each other, their interaction the Way’s natural course.

Names define reality; words arise from nature.
When gold returns to its original nature, it is rightly called returning cinnabar.
I do not dare speak falsely, but emulate the sages’ writings.
Ancient records speak of Dragon and Tiger; the Yellow Emperor praised golden blossoms.
Huainan refined autumn stone; Wang Yang added yellow sprouts.
The worthy can uphold and practice this; the unworthy must not partake.
The Way of ancient and modern is one; in conversation, we voice our plans.
Scholars, exert yourselves, lingering in deep reflection.
The essential words are utterly plain, shining clearly without deceiving me.

Qian and Kun, hard and soft, embrace and enfold one another.
Yang bestows; Yin receives. Male and female depend on each other.
Through this, creation unfolds, and essence and qi spread forth.
Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading.
The Dark and Mysterious are hard to fathom; they cannot be depicted in diagrams.
The sage measures and orders them, yet finds no foundation.
The four blend into chaos, entering directly into the formless.
The sixty-four hexagrams cycle, spread out as a chariot.
Dragon and horse are harnessed; the enlightened ruler guides the times.
In harmony, they follow; the path is level and not crooked.
Crooked ways are perilous, toppling states and endangering nations.

The noble person dwells in his chamber; the words he utters are good.

Then from a thousand *li* beyond, it responds.

This speaks of the lord of ten thousand chariots,
who dwells within the nine-fold chamber,
issuing decrees and commands,
accordant with the rhythms of Yin and Yang.
He stores his instruments and awaits the proper time,
never transgressing the hexagrams’ months:
*Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen*;
*Meng* uses *yin* and *xu*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams
each have their appointed days.

I merely set forth these two images,
yet cannot exhaust their fullness.
Establish righteousness and institute punishments—
bestow virtue where benevolence is due.
Those who defy it meet misfortune;
those who follow it attain good fortune.
Follow the calendar and its statutes,
with utmost sincerity and unwavering focus.
Carefully observe the celestial stems and branches,
scrutinizing the waxing and waning.
Even the slightest deviation
brings regret and shame as thieves.

At the two solstices, the measures shift,
discordant and convoluted.
Midwinter brings scorching heat;
midsummer, frost and snow.
At the two equinoxes, alignment falters,
failing even by a moment’s measure.
Winds and rains fall out of season;
flood and drought contend.
Locusts surge like boiling water,
and manifold anomalies erupt.
Heaven displays its omens:
mountains collapse, the earth splits.
The filial son’s devotion
moves the august pole.
What issues from his own mouth
flows afar to distant lands.

Some bring calamity,
some bring blessings,
some usher in great peace,
some provoke war and strife.
These four arise
from the heart’s chamber.

Movement and stillness follow constancy,
adhering to their plumb line.
The four seasons align with their time,
harmonizing with the qi.
Hard and soft are decisively set,
never encroaching upon each other.
The Five Phases guard their bounds,
never recklessly expanding or contracting.
The Changes flow in ceaseless circulation,
bending and stretching, reversing and returning.

Between the dark and new moons,
signs converge at the center.
Primal chaos and vast obscurity,
the female and male follow one another.
Essence and moisture nourish and moisten,
disseminating transformation in ceaseless flow.
Heaven and earth, spirits and numina—
beyond all measure.
Use them to secure the body,
concealing form in hiddenness.
It begins in the northeast,
the region of Winnowing Basket and Dipper.
Turning rightward in revolution,
it disgorges the wheel and spits forth the sprout.
In the hidden depths, images appear,
scattering radiant essence and light.

Above the Pleiades and Net,
thunder emerges as the omen.
Yang qi initiates its course—
the first nine, the hidden dragon.
Yang stands on three,
yin opens through eight.
Thus, on the third day, thunder stirs;
on the eighth day, joy proceeds.
The second nine, the dragon appears—
peaceful and luminous.
With the virtues of three and five complete,
the body of Qian is formed.
The third nine, vigilant at dusk,
diminishes the divine tally.
Prosperity and decline gradually shift,
ultimately returning to their origin.
Xun inherits its lineage,
firmly securing and upholding.
The fourth nine, perhaps leaping—
advancing and retreating, the Way is perilous.
Gen governs cessation and advance,
forbidding transgression of the time.
On the twenty-third day,
the crescent moon is observed.
The fifth nine, the flying dragon—
heaven’s position brings joy.
The sixth five, Kun submits,
binding beginning and end.
Nurturing the multitude of offspring,
it becomes the mother of all kinds.
The ninth above, the exalted dragon—
battling virtue in the wilds.
Using the nine, soaring and fluttering,
it becomes the compass of the Way.
The yang numbers now complete,
completion then gives rise to renewal.
Pushing forth with feeling, uniting with nature,
turning to join one another.

Following the jade pivot’s revolution,
ascending and descending, rising and falling,
circulating through the six lines—
difficult to perceive.
Thus, it has no fixed position,
yet stands as the ancestral founder of the Changes.

At the new moon’s dawn, Return—
yang qi begins its flow.
Entering and exiting without haste,
erecting the gnomon, subtly firm.
Yellow Bell establishes the Zi month,
its signs now manifest.
Disseminating soft warmth,
the common people receive constancy.

Approaching the furnace, applying the twigs—
opening the path, correcting the light.
The radiance gradually advances,
the days grow ever longer.
Great Lü of the Chou month
binds and adjusts the high and low.

Looking upward to form Peace—
hard and soft flourish together.
Yin and yang intertwine,
the small departs, the great arrives.
Converging at Yin,
moving in accord with the time.

Gradually passing through Great Strength,
flanking the gate of Mao.
Elm pods fall,
returning to their root.
Punishment and virtue bear one another,
day and night begin their division.

Decisiveness—yin retreats,
yang ascends and advances.
Washing and cleansing feathers and wings,
shaking off the dust of slumber.

Qian, vigorous and resplendent,
its influence spreading to the four neighbors.
Yang ends at Si,
centered, it interacts with others.

Gou begins the sequence,
treading frost first.
The well’s cold spring—
Wu is the Ruibin.
The guest submits to yin,
yin becomes the host.

Withdrawing from the worldly position,
gathering and refining its essence.
Cherishing virtue, awaiting the time,
dwelling in obscurity and darkness.

Obstruction—blocked and impassable,
sprouts cannot emerge.
Yin extends, yang withdraws,
yang’s name is lost.

Observing its measures,
examining the autumnal equinox’s nature.
Nurturing the young and tender,
the old and withered flourish anew.
Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout,
growing beneath the cover.

Splitting and rotting the limbs,
dissolving and vanishing the form.
The transforming qi exhausted,
the utmost spirit is lost.

The Way exhausted, it turns back,
returning to Kun’s origin.
Eternally following earth’s patterns,
receiving heaven’s mandate to spread.

Mysterious, distant, and boundless,
separated yet connected.
Responding to measure, nurturing life—
the origin of yin and yang.
Vast and indistinct,
none know its beginning.
Those who first stray lose the path;
those who follow become lords.
No level ground without slope—
such is the Way’s nature.
Change and transformation ever flourish,
waxing and waning mutually dependent.
Ending with Kun, beginning with Return,
ever cycling in an unbroken ring.
Emperors and kings receive and serve—
enduring for a thousand generations.

To nurture one’s nature,
prolong life, and forestall the end,
consider the future,
but first reflect on what came before.
The body one is endowed with
originates from primordial unity.
Primal essence spreads like clouds,
borne by qi at the beginning.

Yin and yang serve as measures,
the dwelling of hun and po.
Yang spirit is the sun’s soul,
yin spirit is the moon’s spirit.
Hun and po,
each other’s dwelling.
Nature presides within,
establishing the inner enclosure.
Emotion governs without,
building walls and outer ramparts.
When walls and ramparts are complete,
people and things find peace.
At this time,
emotion harmonizes with Qian and Kun.
Qian moves and straightens,
qi spreads, essence flows.
Kun is still and receptive,
becoming the Way’s abode.
The hard applies and retreats,
the soft transforms and nourishes.
Nine returns, seven reverses,
eight returns, six resides.
Male white, female red—
metal and fire restrain each other.
Water then settles fire—
the beginning of the Five Phases.
Supreme goodness resembles water,
pure and without flaw.
The Way’s form and image—
true unity is hard to depict.
Transforming and dispersing,
each dwells in solitude.

Like a hen’s egg,
white and black align.
A square inch in breadth,
this is the beginning.
Four limbs, five viscera,
sinews and bones all present.
After ten months,
it emerges from the womb.
Bones soft, pliable as silk,
flesh smooth as lead.

Using the yang-burning mirror to capture fire—
without the sun, no light is born.
Without the moon and stars, the square vessel—
how could it yield water or broth?
The two qi are dark and distant,
yet their resonance and transformation still communicate.
How much more so the near and present body,
intimately close to heart and breast?
Yin and yang pair with sun and moon,
water and fire serve as their proofs.

Ears, eyes, and mouth—the three treasures—
firmly seal them, do not let them loose.
The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
floating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.
Turning and bending to see and hear,
opening and closing all in harmony.
Becoming the pivot of oneself,
movement and stillness never exhausted.
Li’s qi inwardly defends,
Kan then does not employ hearing.
Dui unites without speech,
few words accord with primal chaos.
The three now locked,
the body relaxes in an empty chamber.
Entrusting the will to return to emptiness,
taking no-thought as constancy.
Attaining the unshakable.

The heart, focused, does not stray;
in sleep and waking, spirit embraces spirit.
Awakening, one awaits the signs of presence or absence.
The countenance grows ever more moist,
the bones and joints ever more firm and strong.
Expelling the host of yin’s perverse influences,
one then establishes the true yang.
Cultivating without cease or rest,
the qi of clouds and rain moves forth,
drizzling like spring’s gentle soak,
flowing like ice’s slow dissolve.
From the head it streams down to the feet,
then ultimately ascends again,
coming and going through the boundless void.
Subtly it suffuses the body’s vessel.

Reversion is the Dao’s proof,
softness is virtue’s handle.
Weed and hoe the long-accumulated filth,
and even the finest details become harmonious.
The turbid is the path to clarity,
long darkness yields to radiant light.

Yet people of the world favor petty arts,
unable to discern the Dao’s depth or shallowness.
Abandoning the true to follow deviant paths,
they seek speed but meet obstruction.
Like the blind without their staff,
like the deaf straining to hear gong and shang,
they plunge into water to catch pheasant and hare,
climb mountains to seek fish and dragon,
plant wheat hoping to harvest millet,
or wield compasses to find squares.
Exhausting their strength and laboring their spirit,
throughout the year they see no success.

To know the method of ingesting the elixir,
the task is simple and not complex.

The pearl of the Great Yang
ever seeks to leave the person.
Suddenly obtaining the Golden Flower,
it turns and interacts.
Transformed into a white liquid,
it congeals to utmost hardness.
The Golden Flower first intones,
and in a brief moment,
dissolves and becomes water,
its veins like a horse’s teeth.
Yang then goes to harmonize,
nature and essence in spontaneity.
When yin presses close in time,
confined and bound at the gate of restraint,
the loving mother nurtures and nourishes,
the filial child repays kindness.
The stern father issues commands,
instructing and admonishing descendants.
The Five Phases contend for supremacy,
each relying on the other to arise.
Fire’s nature melts metal,
metal fells wood to flourish.
The Three and Five with the One—
the essence of Heaven and Earth.
This may be transmitted by oral instruction,
but is difficult to convey in writing.

---

At midnight, turn to the right;
at noon, the sun wheels eastward.
The boundaries of dawn and dusk divide,
establishing the two names.
The Dragon calls to the Tiger,
the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence.
Each feeds upon the other,
both covet the advantage.
Thus they interlock and swallow,
chewing and devouring one another.
When Mars guards the west,
the *Tai Ping Jing* traverses the heavens.
Where the killing qi descends,
what can stand unshaken?
The wildcat guards the mouse,
the sparrow fears the goshawk.
Each attains its function—
who dares utter a sound?

Without grasping the principle,
one must not speak recklessly.
Exhausting family wealth,
wife and children starve in poverty.
From ancient times to now,
countless have pursued this path,
yet few meet success—
rare are those who achieve it.
Seeking famous medicines far and wide,
they stray from the Dao.
But if one truly encounters it,
discerning its beginnings and threads,
comparing like to like,
measuring things from start to finish—

The Five Phases overcome one another,
each in turn becoming father and mother.
The mother contains the nourishing fluid,
the father governs bestowal.
Essence congeals, form flows—
metal and stone do not decay.
With focused attention, no leakage,
one attains the completion of the Dao.
Raise a pole and see its shadow;
call into the valley and hear the echo.
Is this not wondrous?
The supreme image of Heaven and Earth.
Yet if one takes a single inch of wild aconite
or an ounce of croton seed,
swallowing brings instant collapse—
no bending or lifting possible.
At such a time,
even if King Wen cast the yarrow stalks,
Confucius interpreted the omens,
Bian Que wielded his needles,
or Wu Xian beat his drum,
who could revive them,
restore them to run and race?

The maiden of the Yellow River,
spirit-like and most divine,
takes flight when fire is applied—
no dust is seen.
Ghosts hide, dragons conceal,
none know where she abides.
Should one seek to master her—

The Yellow Sprout is the root.

All things lack yin and yang—
defying Heaven, turning from the Void.
A hen hatches her own eggs,
yet her chicks are incomplete.
Why is this?
Union has not yet moved,
the Three and Five fail to meet,
hard and soft remain apart.
The essence of transformation—
Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity—
is like fire rising when stirred,
water flowing downward to moisten.
No master’s Dao compels it so.
The origin governs all,
unchanging and unalterable.

Observe the mating of male and female:
hard and soft entwine,
unbreakably bound.
When their rhythm aligns,
no craft or control is needed.
A boy is born prone,
a girl lies supine—
endowed in the womb,
receiving qi at the primal beginning.
Not only at birth
is this manifest,
but at death too,
they mirror it again.
Neither father nor mother
instructs them thus;
the pattern is set
in the first union.

The Kan male is the moon,
the Li female the sun.
The sun bestows virtue,
the moon unfurls its light.
The moon receives the sun’s transformation,
its body unharmed.
If yang loses its bond,
yin encroaches upon its brightness.
At dark and new moon, they press close,
eclipsing one another.
Yang’s form wanes,
yin’s calamity arises.
Male and female depend on each other,
exhaling and inhaling to nourish.
Male and female intermingle,
seeking their own kind.

Metal transforms into water,
water’s nature circulates freely.
Fire transforms into earth,
and water cannot flow.
Thus the male moves outward,
the female rests within.
If overflow exceeds measure,
she restrains him.
The po reins in the hun,
preventing excess.
Neither cold nor heat,
advancing and retreating in time,
each attains harmony,
both emit confirming signs.

Cinnabar is wood’s essence,
united with metal they merge.
Where metal and water meet,
wood and fire become companions.
The four blend in chaos,
arrayed as dragon and tiger.
The dragon, yang, bears an odd number;
the tiger, yin, an even one.
The liver, green, is the father;
the lungs, white, the mother;
the kidneys, black, the child;
the spleen, yellow, the ancestor.
The child begins the Five Phases—
three things, one family,
all returning to wu and ji.

Hard and soft alternate,
passing through divisions in turn.
The dragon in the west, the tiger in the east,
establishing the weft at mao and you.
Punishment and virtue converge,
meeting in joy.
Punishment governs submission and slaying,
virtue governs life and growth.
In the second month, the elm scatters its leaves,
the Dipper points to mao.
In the eighth month, wheat sprouts,
the Celestial Net holds you.
North and south, child and noon,
mutually bind as guiding principles.
The number one and nine
ends and begins anew.
Embracing the Primordial in xu and wei,
scattering essence into the child.

*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
on the river’s isle.
Graceful and refined, the fair maiden—
the noble man’s fine match.
The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not live solitary.
The Dark Warrior, tortoise and snake,
coil and entwine in support.
Thus it is made clear:
male and female
must ever depend on each other.

Suppose two women share a chamber,
their beauty most fair.
Let Su Qin convey words,
Zhang Yi broker the match,
unleashing eloquent tongues,
deploying honeyed speech,
baring their hearts in harmony,
pledging to be husband and wife.
Yet even if their hair rots and teeth decay,
they will never know each other.

If herbs and minerals are not of the same kind,
their names and categories differ,
their divisions and measures misaligned,
losing their guiding principles—
though the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace,
Tai Yi wields the fire,
the Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blends and harmonizes,
pavilions are raised, altars erected,
jade steps and terraces built,
unicorn jerky and phoenix preserves offered,
registers held in long obeisance,
spirits and gods entreated,
ghosts implored with lament,
bathing and fasting in hope—
it is like mending a cauldron with glue,
or smearing a wound with *,
adding ice to cold,
or using hot water to cool.
Flying turtles and dancing snakes
only grow more perverse.

O, only the sages and worthies of old,
embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true.
They ingested and refined the Nine Cauldrons’ elixir,
their traces transformed, hidden in obscurity.
They nurtured essence and cultivated spirit,
communing with the virtue of the Three Luminaries.
Their fluids and pores, sinews and bones,
grew ever more steadfast.
All perverse influences were dispelled,
while the upright qi abided always.
Through long accumulation,
they altered their forms and ascended as immortals.

Yet pitying later generations—
those who loved the Dao—
they followed the drift of prevailing winds,
tracing and inscribing ancient texts,
composing them into charts and registers,
revealing them to posterity.
Branches were exposed,
while the root remained concealed.
They entrusted their teachings to stones,
veiling truth beneath a profusion of texts.
Scholars who obtained them
locked them away in caskets for lifetimes.
Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits,
grandsons trod their ancestors’ paths.
Transmitted through generations, confusion deepened,
until none had seen or heard the truth.
Thus officials abandoned office,
farmers neglected their plows,
merchants forsook their wares,
and men of resolve lived in poverty.

I grieve deeply for this.
Here I set down this record,
its words concise and thoughts clear,
its matters simple, uncluttered.
Its clauses are laid out,
verifiable and observable.
Weights and measures are precise,
each following in due order.

Thus they wove disordered words,
with cavities and orifices as their gates.
The wise examine and ponder,
applying their minds to weigh them.

○ No image is greater than Heaven and Earth—
the dark ravine spans ten thousand *li*.
The River Drum nears the Star Marker,
and the people all tremble in fear.
The shadow’s reckless advance and retreat—
nine years beset by calamity.
The August Emperor gazes upon it,
and the king retreats to reform himself.
The bolt of the pass rises and falls—
harmful *qi* scatters in flight.
The Yangtze and Huai run dry—
their waters pour into the sea.
Heaven and Earth’s male and female—
they linger between *zi* and *wu*.
*Yin* and *yang*’s ancestors in *yin* and *shen*—
they emerge and enter, completing their cycle.
Following the Dipper and the Beckoning Star,
they grasp the balance to fix the primal order.

○ Ascending and roasting on Mount Zeng—
flames spread below.
The White Tiger sings and leads ahead,
while the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and falters—
its flight displays five hues.
Entangled in nets cast wide,
it is pressed down, unable to rise.
Its wails ring with sorrow—
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the boiling cauldron,
its feathers and plumage are crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra’s mark has passed,
fish scales and manes arise.
Five colors dazzle and gleam—
transformation has no constant master.
The seething cauldron boils over—
violent force knows no rest.
Linked and layered in piles,
like interlocking canine teeth.
Its form like midwinter ice—
stalactites jut from its lattice.
Towering and jumbled together,
they prop one another up.

○ When *yin* and *yang* find their match,
they dwell in tranquil harmony.
The Green Dragon resides in the sixth chamber of *Fang*—
spring blossoms shake in the eastern *mao*.
The White Tiger stands in the seventh star of *Mao*—
autumn’s edge gleams in the western *you*.
The Vermilion Bird abides in the second star of *Zhang*—
true *yang* blazes at the southern *wu*.
All three come to pay court—
their kin become intimate companions.
Their root lies in but two things,
yet their end becomes three and five.
Three, five, and one together—
all gather in two places.
Govern them as the above method prescribes—
count the days and take the measure.

○ First white, then yellow—
consuming black to penetrate within and without.
This is called the First Cauldron,
its sustenance like grains of millet.
What nature itself accomplishes—
not some devious or false path.
As when mountain and marsh *qi* steam together,
giving rise to clouds and rain.
When mud dries, it becomes dust—
when fire dies, it turns to earth.
Like dyeing with indigo to make yellow,
or woad to weave green silk.
Boiling hides to make glue,
or fermenting yeast to brew wine.
Kindred things readily yield their work—
unrelated kinds defy craft.
This wondrous art alone—
examine it closely, it does not deceive.
Transmitted to a hundred million generations hence,
its brilliance will be self-evident.
Shining like the Milky Way’s starry script,
radiant as the sea’s primal waters.
Ponder it until it is thoroughly mastered—
turn it over, surveying above and below.
After a thousand revolutions, it gleams resplendent—
after ten thousand repetitions, it may be seen.
The divine and numinous may reveal it to man—
the heart’s spirit suddenly awakens.
Probe its beginning, seek its threads—
you will surely find its gate and door.
The Dao of Heaven favors none—
it is ever passed to the worthy.

○ The *Cantong Qi* expounds its outline,
yet cannot maintain purity.
Its discourse overflows,
leaving subtle details incomplete.
Its breadth is vague and approximate—
now I compile this record anew,
filling gaps and omissions,
polishing its profound depths.
Drawing connections to link them,
its purport made uniform.
Its aims unerring,
I thus compose this,
arranging five corresponding types.
Then the *Book of Changes*’ nature and essence are fully revealed.

○ The *Book of Changes*’ nature and essence
each conform to its measure.
The Yellow Emperor and Laozi delved deeply—
their scrutiny yields mastery.
The work of the furnace and fire
has true grounds for its claims.
The Three Ways arise from one—
all emerge from the same path.

○ Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves—
fruit hangs in abundance.
The truth lies in the root and trunk,
never losing its original essence.
What the sincere heart speaks—
examined, it does not err.

○ Like the midwinter season,
when bamboo and trees all wither and break.
Aiding *yang*, the merchant caravans halt—
the lord of men retreats in seclusion.
Following the season’s rhythm and its commands,
he seals his lips, speaking not.
The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless—
the Great Mystery has no form.
Void and stillness cannot be seen—
its frame and enclosure fade away.
Errors and mistakes lose the thread of affairs—
words return to self-defeat.
I distinguish these Four Images in sequence
to enlighten later generations’ blindness.

○ A rustic from Kuaiji,
a rotting life in a secluded valley.
Clinging to plainness and simplicity,
unamused by splendor and glory.
Dwelling in obscurity and remoteness,
heedless of profit and fame.
Holding fast to tranquility and stillness,
longing for an age of peace.
At ease in quiet seclusion,
he composed this text,
chanting the *Book of Changes*—
the three sages’ bequeathed words.
Examining their intent and drift,
he saw one thread uniting them all.

○ The task lies in following principle,
illuminating the spirit.
Divine transformation flows freely—
the Four Seas know peace.
Set forth as a calendar,
it may be followed for ten thousand generations.
Ordered to guide governance,
its practice is not cumbersome.
Drawing inward to nurture nature.

The Yellow Emperor and Laozi embrace spontaneity,
their virtue profound in its fullness.
Returning to the root, reverting to the origin—
this lies near in my heart,
not apart from this body.
Embracing the One without forsaking it,
one may endure forever.
Paired with dietary arts,
yin and yang are arrayed,
refined cinnabar from Wudu is selected,
the Eight Minerals cast aside.

○ Careful application brings things to completion—
what the world treasures.
Three methods are laid out,
branches and stems interconnected.
Same origin, different names,
all emerging from one gate.
Not merely piling up lines,
nor forcing rhymes in this text.
Yet it holds its truth,
its coarse grains worthy of contemplation.
Had I spread falsehoods,
I would only incur superfluous faults.
Entitled *Triple Concordance*,
I glimpsed but its beginning.
Few words, vast meaning—
descendants ought to follow it.
Abandon the times, shun harm,
rely on hills and mountains.
Wander the vast expanse,
neighbors to spirits.
Transforming form to become immortal,
sinking into silence without sound.
Once in a hundred generations,
roaming among men,
displaying feathered wings,
east, west, south, and north they incline.

Tang met with dire straits,
flood and drought divided the wells.
Branches and leaves withered yellow,
losing their flourishing splendor.
The fortunate bear one another’s burdens—
peace and stability enable long life.

【*Song of the Cauldron*】
Round as the Three and Five,
a tenth of an inch in measure.
Mouth four by eight.

Two inches the lips,
twelve inches in length.
Even in thickness,
the belly holds three.
Seated, warmth hangs down—
yin above,
yang rushes below.
Head and tail in martial stance,
the center refined.
Beginning at seventy,
ending at three decades,
two hundred and six.
Skillfully harmonized,
yin’s fire white,
yellow sprout and lead.
Two sevens gather,
assisting and aiding man,
nourishing the brain,
stabilizing ascension to the mysterious.
The child dwells within—
secure and preserved.
Coming and going in roaming,
never leaving the gate.
Gradually growing great,
nature and emotion pure.
Returning to the One,
restoring the root origin.
Cherish reverence,
like lord and minister.
When one cycle completes,
how arduous it is.
Guard closely,
lest you fall into confusion.
The path is distant,
again profound and obscure.
If you attain this,
you will meet Heaven and Earth.
The elixir’s touch
calms the po and hun.
Attaining long life,
dwelling in the immortal village.
Those who delight in the Dao
seek its root.
Examine the Five Phases,
determine the scruples and grains.
Contemplate it carefully—
no need for debate.
Conceal deeply and guard,
do not transmit the text.

Mount the white crane,
ride the dragon’s scales.
Roam the Great Void,
pay homage to the Immortal Lord.
Receive the celestial chart,
be named a Perfected One.

【Eulogy】
The *Triple Concordance*—
its words veiled, yet the Dao vast,
its speech subtle, yet its meaning profound.

The Five Emperors established their enterprises,
aligned with the Three Sovereigns to govern.
If lord and minister diverge in rank,
above and below lack standard.
Ordering thus for governance,
peace will not be attained.
Exotic arts of diet and ingestion
cannot secure long life.
Learning to nurture one’s nature
still does not prolong the years.
Yet when yin and yang are dissected,
their scruples and grains aligned,
the crescent and full moons,
the trigrams’ formed images,
male and female enact transformation,
hard and soft, movement and stillness—
rice and salt distinguished,
taken as scriptural proof—
the intent is steadfast indeed.
Thus laws are established
to transmit to later worthies.
Expounding the great image,
long life is surely attained.
For those who follow my Dao,
give it weightier consideration.
