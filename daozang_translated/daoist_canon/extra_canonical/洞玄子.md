# 洞玄子

Master Dongxuan said: Among all things born of heaven, none is more noble than man. Of all human pursuits, none surpasses the chamber arts. They emulate heaven and earth, model yin and yang. Those who grasp their principles nurture nature and prolong life; those who neglect their truth harm the spirit and shorten their years. Though the methods of the Mysterious Woman have been transmitted through the ages, their general outlines are set forth, yet their subtle mechanisms remain incomplete. I have often perused their principles and sought to fill their gaps, synthesizing ancient rites to compile this new scripture. Though it may not exhaust their purity, it at least captures their essence.

The forms of sitting and reclining, stretching and curling; the postures of yielding and opening; the techniques of side-turning, back-bending, advancing, and retreating; the rules of depth and shallowness in entry and exit—all harmonize with the principles of the Two Modes and conform to the numbers of the Five Phases. Those who guide aright preserve life and destiny; those who err plunge into peril and ruin. Since this offers benefit to ordinary people, how could it not be transmitted through ten thousand generations?

Master Dongxuan said: Heaven revolves leftward while earth circles rightward; spring and summer fade as autumn and winter succeed. The man intones and the woman responds; the superior acts and the inferior follows—such is the constant principle of all things. If the man stirs and the woman does not answer, or the woman moves and the man does not follow, this harms not only the man but also the woman. This arises from yin and yang acting in discord, upper and lower in rebellion. Such union brings no benefit to either. Therefore, the man must turn leftward while the woman circles rightward, the man thrust downward while the woman receives upward. Only thus does their union achieve the balance of heaven and the completion of earth.

In matters of depth and shallowness, slowness and swiftness, distinguishing east from west and twisting from turning, the principles are not singular but manifold. At times, a gentle thrust resembles a crucian carp playing with a hook; at others, a rapid motion is like a flock of birds encountering the wind. Advancing and retreating, pulling and guiding, rising and falling in accord, moving left and right, entering and exiting with varying density—all this requires mutual engagement to accomplish the task, adapting to the moment as needed. One must not cling rigidly to fixed rhythms like a lute peg tuned to a single note, but rather respond to the demands of the occasion.

When first uniting, the man sits to the woman’s left, the woman to the man’s right. The man sits with legs spread like a winnowing basket, embracing the woman in his arms. Then he restrains her slender waist and caresses her jade body, tenderly expressing affection and intimacy, their hearts and minds in unison. Now embracing, now restraining, their forms intertwine, their mouths meet—he takes her lower lip, she takes his upper lip, both sucking at once, savoring each other’s fluids. Sometimes they gently nibble the tongue, sometimes lightly bite the lips; now they invite each other to clasp the head, now command each other to pinch the ears. Stroking above and patting below, swallowing to the east and sipping to the west. Once a thousand tender feelings are expressed and a hundred cares dissolved, the woman is bidden to embrace the man’s jade stem with her left hand, while the man caresses her jade gate with his right.

Thus, when the man senses the qi of yin, his jade stem stirs and rises, standing erect like a solitary peak overlooking the distant river. When the woman senses the qi of yang, her cinnabar cave overflows with fluid, flowing downward like a hidden spring gushing from a deep valley. This is the natural effect of yin and yang stimulating each other, not something achieved by human effort. When the moment reaches this point, union may proceed. If the man does not stir or the woman’s jade fluid does not flow, it is because illness arises within and manifests without.

Master Dongxuan said: When first uniting, begin seated and then recline, the woman to the left and the man to the right. Once settled, have the woman lie supine, stretching her limbs, while the man kneels above her between her thighs. He positions his jade stem upright at the mouth of her jade gate, towering like a pine tree standing before a precipitous valley. Then he further adjusts and restrains, kissing her mouth and sucking her tongue. Sometimes he gazes at her jade face, sometimes looks down at her golden ravine, stroking and patting between her belly and breasts, caressing the sides of her jade terrace.

Thus, when the man’s passion is aroused and the woman’s intent is captivated, he wields his yang blade in sweeping attacks—now thrusting downward to strike the jade texture, now driving upward to pierce the golden ravine. He strikes beside the circular moat and rests upon the suspended terrace.

[The above describes external play without internal union.]

When the woman’s jade fluids pool deep within her cinnabar cave, the man then plunges his yang blade into her womb, causing their essences to surge forth in shared delight. Above, they irrigate the divine field; below, they flood the hidden valley. As they clash and grind in rhythmic advance and retreat, the woman pleads for life and death, begs for vitality and breath. Once their fluids are dried with silk, the man drives his jade stem deep into her cinnabar cave, reaching her yang terrace—unyielding as a boulder wedged in a deep ravine. Then he practices the method of nine shallow thrusts to one deep.

Thus he thrusts and prods, pulls and lifts, now slow, now swift, now deep, now shallow. After twenty-one breaths, he times his movements to her qi’s ebb and flow. When the woman finds her pleasure, the man quickens his strokes, pressing firmly and raising high. As she sways and stirs, he matches her rhythm, driving his yang blade into her valley’s core, drawing it into her womb to grind and mill without need for minute withdrawal.

When her fluids overflow, the man must withdraw—not dead, but alive. A dead retreat harms the man greatly; he must be especially cautious of this.

Master Dongxuan says: Examining the postures of intercourse, they do not exceed thirty methods. Though some involve bending, stretching, rising, or lowering, entering deeply or shallowly, they are largely the same in essence, differing only in minor details. One may say they encompass all possibilities, leaving nothing ungathered. I have therefore depicted their forms and recorded their names, assigning each a title. Let the discerning gentleman exhaust their wondrous subtleties.

Master Dongxuan says: In all couplings, the jade stem may strike left or right, like a fierce general breaking through enemy lines—this is the first manner. Or it may climb upward and plunge downward, like a wild horse leaping a ravine—this is the second. Or it may emerge and submerge, like gulls skimming the waves—this is the third. Or it may thrust deeply and lightly, like a sparrow pecking at a mortar—this is the fourth. Or it may drive deep and pierce shallow, like a great stone cast into the sea—this is the fifth. Or it may rise and push slowly, like a frozen snake entering its den—this is the sixth. Or it may swiftly stab straight in, like a startled mouse darting into its hole—this is the seventh. Or it may lift her head and draw in her feet, like a goshawk seizing a cunning hare—this is the eighth. Or it may raise and then suddenly lower, like a great sail struck by a gale—this is the ninth.

Master Dongxuan says: In all couplings, one may press downward upon the jade stem and saw back and forth along the jade texture, its motion like prying open a clam to take its pearl—this is the first manner. Or one may lift the jade texture from below and surge upward into the golden ravine, its motion like splitting stone to seek fine jade—this is the second. Or one may drive the yang blade into the jade terrace, its motion like a pestle grinding in a mortar—this is the third. Or one may thrust the jade stem in and out, striking left and right at the jade gate, its motion like a hammer forging iron—this is the fourth. Or one may move the yang blade back and forth, plowing between the sacred field and the hidden valley, its motion like a farmer tilling autumn soil—this is the fifth. Or one may grind the jade garden and celestial court together, its motion like two collapsing cliffs pressing against each other—this is the sixth.

Master Dongxuan says: When nearing the moment of emission, one must await the woman’s pleasure and release together with her. The man should withdraw slightly, moving between the zither strings and wheat teeth, the yang blade moving shallow and deep like an infant nursing at the breast. Then close the eyes and turn the mind inward, press the tongue to the lower palate, draw in the shoulders and extend the neck, spread the arms and contract the shoulders, close the mouth and inhale deeply. Thus the essence will ascend naturally from the lower limit, and the amount released will be entirely within one’s control—of ten parts, only two or three need be spent.

Master Dongxuan says: If seeking to conceive a child, wait until the woman’s monthly flow has ceased, then couple on the first or third day for a son, or the fourth or fifth day for a daughter. After the fifth day, one only wastes essence to no avail. When coupling to emit essence, await the woman’s pleasure and release together with her, and the emission must be complete. First have the woman lie supine, composed in mind and intent, closing her eyes to inwardly receive the generative qi. Thus the *Laozi* says: A child conceived at midnight will enjoy long life; before midnight, middle life; after midnight, short life.

Once the woman has conceived, she must perform good deeds, avoid seeing evil sights or hearing evil words, moderate desires, refrain from cursing or scolding, avoid fright or exhaustion, false speech or sorrow, and abstain from raw, cold, sour, slippery, or hot foods. She must not ride in carriages or on horses, climb heights, approach depths, descend slopes, walk swiftly, take medicine, or receive acupuncture or moxibustion. She must always compose her mind and thoughts, and constantly listen to scriptures and books. Thus the child, whether son or daughter, will be intelligent and wise, loyal, true, steadfast, and good—this is what is meant by *prenatal instruction*.

Master Dongxuan says: If the man’s age is double the woman’s, it harms the woman; if the woman’s age is double the man’s, it harms the man. The direction and timing of coupling, whether beneficial or harmful, follow the seasons—observe these principles for great fortune. In spring, face east; in summer, south; in autumn, west; in winter, north. Yang days are beneficial [even-numbered days], yin days are harmful [odd-numbered days]. Yang hours are beneficial [from the *zi* hour to noon], yin hours are harmful [from noon to the *zi* hour]. Spring: *jia* and *yi* days; summer: *bing* and *ding* days; autumn: *geng* and *xin* days; winter: *ren* and *gui* days.
