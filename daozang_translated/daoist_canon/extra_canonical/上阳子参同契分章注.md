**The *Cantong Qi* with Chapter Divisions and Commentary**
*Composed by Wei Boyang of Kuaiji; Annotated by Shangyangzi of Luling*
**Volume One**
**Chapter One: General Introduction to the *Yijing***

Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams.
Kan and Li frame the structure, turning the hub and aligning the axle; the four hexagrams of the female and male serve as bellows and key.
They cover and envelop the Dao of yin and yang, just as a skilled charioteer follows the marking line, holds the reins and bit, adjusts the compass and square, and follows the wheel tracks—abiding in the center to govern the exterior, with numbers ordered by the pitch pipes and calendar.
The lunar phases have five or six days; warp and weft serve the sun’s command, combining to make sixty, with firmness and yielding having outer and inner aspects.
At dawn, *Zhun* takes up its duty; by dusk, *Meng* receives its turn. Day and night each have one hexagram, used in proper sequence.
Before reaching the end of the month, when the darkness brightens, the cycle concludes and begins anew. The sun and moon set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases.
Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*; autumn and winter apply the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*.
Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The line statements contain benevolence and righteousness, releasing joy and anger in accord with the seasons. Thus they respond to the four seasons, and the Five Phases attain their principle.

**Commentary:**
Fu Xi beheld the *Hetu* and first drew the eight trigrams. The Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun let their robes hang loose, and the world was governed.
Taking from Qian and Kun, the *Xia* *Yijing* was called *Guicang*, with Kun as its head; the *Shang* called it *Lianshan*, with Gen as its head. King Wen’s *Zhouyi* took Qian and Kun as its head.
Confucius’ *Wing* says: “Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yijing*! Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing.”
It also says: “Now, Qian—when still, it is concentrated; when moving, it is straight, thus it greatly engenders. Kun—when still, it is closed; when moving, it opens, thus it broadly engenders.”
The immortal Master Boyang deeply grasped the intent of the Three Sages and composed the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, above assisting the Dao of the Three Sages, below ferrying the people of ten thousand generations. His opening lines directly point: “Qian and Kun are the gates of the *Yijing*, the parents of all hexagrams.”
Shangyangzi says: Qian, as a thing, is yang, thus it is the door of the *Yijing*; Kun, as a thing, is yin, thus it is the gate.
The Supreme Polarity is in embryo, but without the gates of Qian and Kun, how could Heaven and Earth be established in their positions? How could the sun and moon shine? How could the myriad beings transform and generate? How could the sage enact his Dao?
Thus, when Qian moves and is straight, it is yang, and the Supreme Polarity generates yin; when Kun moves and opens, it is yin, and the Supreme Polarity generates yang. Yin and yang intermingle and give rise to Kan and Li.
Confucius said: “The *Yijing* has the Supreme Polarity, which generates the Two Modes; the Two Modes generate the Four Images; the Four Images generate the eight trigrams.”
This is Qian’s use of nine: at first it rides Kun and forms *Fu*; within *Fu* it conceives *Zhen*; *Fu* becomes *Shi*; within *Shi* it conceives *Kan*; *Shi* becomes *Qian*; within *Qian* it conceives *Gen*; *Qian* becomes *Yu*. *Zhen* is born from *Yu*; *Yu* becomes *Bi*; *Kan* is born from *Bi*; *Bi* becomes *Bo*; *Gen* is born from *Bo*. Thus the three male hexagrams—*Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—are all conceived and born from Kun.
Kun’s use of six: at first it rides Qian and forms *Gou*; within *Gou* it gestates *Xun*; *Gou* becomes *Tongren*; within *Tongren* it gestates *Li*; *Tongren* becomes *Lü*; within *Lü* it gestates *Dui*; *Lü* becomes *Xiaochu*; *Xiaochu* generates *Xun*; *Xiaochu* becomes *Dayou*; *Dayou* generates *Li*; *Dayou* becomes *Guai*; *Guai* generates *Dui*. Thus the three female hexagrams—*Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*—are all gestated and born from Qian.
Male and female intermingle, each seeking its kind.
Thus, Qian twice joins Kun to form *Lin*; *Lin* becomes *Tai*; *Tai* becomes *Dazhuang*; *Dazhuang* becomes *Guai*—this is yang seeking yin. Kun twice responds to Qian to form *Dun*; *Dun* becomes *Pi*; *Pi* becomes *Guan*; *Guan* becomes *Bo*—this is yin responding to yang.
This is Qian giving birth to three daughters and Kun giving birth to three sons. Proceeding from this, the three sons and three daughters alternately become husband and wife, and the sixty hexagrams arise in sequence. This is what is meant by “Qian and Kun are the parents of all hexagrams.”
What is meant by “Kan and Li frame the structure”? When yang rides yin, Qian’s center is empty and becomes Li; when yin rides yang, Kun’s belly is full and becomes Kan. Thus Kan and Li follow the body of Qian and Kun and serve as the frame for yin and yang.
Their relation to Qian and Kun is like the wheel spokes to the hub and axle: Qian and Kun straighten the spokes of Kan and Li; Kan and Li converge at the hub of Qian and Kun.
Laozi said: “Thirty spokes share one hub.” This is the same principle as the great and small of yin and yang.
“Female and male”: the female is the mother of creatures; the male is the father of creatures. Thus the female is the general term for yin things, and the male is the general name for yang things.
Combining Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, the four hexagrams of female and male serve as bellows and key, just as yin and yang are used for ebb and flow. The bellows resembles the gate of yin; the key is like the door of yang. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are like a single bellows and key between Heaven and Earth.
Using the Dao of bellows and key to generate things is called “things”; using the Dao of bellows and key to generate humans is called “humans”; using the Dao of bellows and key to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood is called “sage.”
The sage is one who skillfully seizes the transformations of creation, skillfully employs Kan and Li. One who is skillful in seizing the Dao of creation is like a good craftsman who uses the marking line to adjust the compass and square—what task cannot be accomplished? One who is skillful in employing the Dao of Kan and Li is like holding the reins and bit to follow the wheel tracks—where can one not arrive?
The sage holds the cosmos in his hands and gives birth to the myriad transformations in his body.
The sage is one who skillfully abides in the center to govern the exterior, who understands the pitch pipes and calendar and knows the numbers.
“Pitch pipes and calendar”: the pitch pipes respond to the seasons of creation; the calendar records the revolutions of the celestial sphere.

As the first yang begins to stir, the pitch pipes respond with Yellow Bell. From *zi* to *hai*, the celestial degrees complete their cycle, and thus when a year has fully turned, yang is reborn at *zi*.

“A month has five or six nodes”:
A *month-node* consists of two solar terms; “five or six” refers to five days making one *hou* (seasonal marker), and six *hou* making one month. Thus a month has thirty days, a day twelve hours, and two hexagrams with twelve lines—each day is woven with two hexagrams as its warp and weft, and a month with sixty hexagrams as its outer and inner patterns.

What does it mean that “at the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs, and by dusk *Meng* receives them”?
For *Zhun* is ☳ below ☵ above, with ☳ as the eldest son who can restore the yang within ☵, bestowing the power of generation and nurture—hence *Zhun* governs affairs. And *Meng* is ☶ above ☵ below, with ☶ as the youngest son who can gather the yang within ☵ to perform the work of warmth and nourishment—hence *Meng* receives them.

“Day and night each correspond to one hexagram”:
Among the sixty hexagrams, all contain both yin and yang, mutually bestowing generation and nurture. The dark and new moons mark a month’s beginning and end; dawn and dusk regulate a day’s movement and stillness; the four seasons determine a year’s rewards and punishments. Those who achieve excellence are rewarded; those who ruin affairs are punished—without losing the proper balance of benevolence, righteousness, joy, and anger—so as to grasp the principles of the four seasons and five phases.

The great meaning of this chapter is to summarize the *Cantong qi*’s overarching intent: taking Qian and Kun as the gateway of the Changes, not merely speaking of the elixir’s ingredients, fire phases, or timing. Over a hundred have attempted to explicate this text, yet few have penetrated its depths. Only Peng Xiao, the True Unity Master, though versed in the elixir and fire, lacked proper sequence, chapter by chapter reducing it to ingredients and fire phases, passage by passage to the work of the crucible and tripod—lest later generations misconstrue. How could he know that the Immortal Elder composed this work without a single redundant word? The upper chapter narrates the transformations of yin and yang, revealing the essence of refining the great elixir; the middle chapter further elaborates the processes of return, nurturing, and vigilance; the lower chapter models the images, fully disclosing the details of elixir formation. The upper chapter proceeds in order; the middle chapter arranges its principles in sequence—how could they be confused and left unexamined?

Master Shangyang divided and annotated it, partitioning the upper chapter into fifteen sections to correspond with the waxing moon’s attainment of the elixir; the middle chapter into fifteen sections to correspond with the waning moon’s completion of the elixir; and the lower chapter into five sections to correspond with the completion numbers of the five phases. The divisions of chapters group those of similar intent into one, carefully tracing the Immortal Elder’s original meaning, unfolding the sequence, and within it employing veiled language to directly point to the elixir, fire phases, crucible, and the subtle workings of creation—enabling later practitioners to readily comprehend, follow, and proceed from the ordinary to the sagely, becoming buddhas and immortals. Yet the secrets transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-ear dare not be committed to writing.

Alas! The world’s people are shallow in virtue and faith, quick to slander. Thus the ancient sages and great worthies established teachings to bequeath guidance, not divulging celestial treasures, but scattering them throughout the classics. King Wen and Confucius transmitted the *Zhouyi* to clarify this Way; the Yellow Emperor and Laozi transmitted “Golden Elixir” to clarify this Way; Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma transmitted the “Great Vehicle” to clarify this Way. The sages’ compassion, expedient means, and guidance all aimed to enable the world’s people to understand this Way—truly the ladder for all beings, the vessel for ten thousand generations.

Yet later generations, each clinging to their own views, failed to establish resolute aspiration, seek true teachers, or comprehend that yin and yang of the same kind mutually assist one another. Instead, they upheld what they had heard, straying ever further. Those who see the *Zhouyi* take it for a book of divination and *na jia*, unaware of the Way of like kind finding companionship. Those who hear of the crucible and tripod suspect it to be the work of smelting metals and minerals; those who hear of “gathering and refining” suspect it to be the arts of the Three Peaks; those who hear of “action” doubt it to be heterodox paths; those who hear of “non-action” doubt it to be sitting in dull emptiness; those who hear of the Great Vehicle grasp it as Chan’s empty nature, merely for discourse.

They fail to perceive that the sages’ Way employs yin and yang to cultivate beyond yin and yang, uses worldly methods to cultivate beyond the worldly. How could such people ever discuss the wondrous words within the *Cantong qi*?

Formerly, Wang Chongxi attained the golden elixir’s essence from Liu Haichan and achieved the Way, sighing: “No one in the world can fathom this—only Zhang Pingshu alone.” Pingshu encountered a sagely teacher in Chengdu and composed the *Wuzhen pian* to instruct later generations, its intent thorough and precise, its profound words and arcane language entirely in accord with the *Cantong qi*.

After Master Shangyang met his sagely teacher, he traveled widely among rivers and lakes, broadly seeking and extensively gathering—yet all was mere idle chatter. The *Cuixu pian* of the Mud-Pill Palace says: “Later, they still go off to study Chan, exposing so many wild fox spirits.” Nowadays, not only is there no one like Pingshu—how could one even find someone like Chongxi? Yet those who prattle of Chan and nature, flaunting their dry wisdom, are everywhere. To find one who can enter this gate and hear the sages’ Way among a hundred million—there is not one. Thus Chongxi’s words were those of great awakening, while Cuixu’s lament is truly pitiable.

The ancients said: “Those who discuss the Way are like ox hairs; those who understand it are like rabbit horns.” How much rarer are those who practice it? The earlier worthies said: “Fools do not understand; at first hearing, they burst into laughter. The superior person’s mind is clear; at first hearing, they grasp the aperture.”

Now, if one were to ask what this aperture is, and explain it thus: “The aperture is the gateway of yin and yang”—would this not further provoke their suspicions?

**Chapter Two: The Establishment of Qian and Kun**

When Heaven and Earth establish their positions, the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun; the establishment of positions is the arrangement of yin and yang in their paired stations. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li—Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun.

These two functions have no fixed line-positions; they circulate through the six voids, their comings and goings never settled, their ascent and descent without constancy. Concealed and submerged, they transform within, enfolding the myriad things, serving as the warp and woof of the Dao. By non-being they govern being; the vessels of function are empty. Thus, in tracing their waxing and waning, Kan and Li vanish.

Words are not idly fabricated; discourses do not arise in vain. They draw upon verification and evident effects, measuring and calibrating the numinous. By analogy they compose characters, tracing principles to their source as proof.

Kan is the essence of the moon, wu; Li is the radiance of the sun, ji. Sun and moon are the *Yi*; hard and soft correspond. Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end. Blue, red, black, and white each reside in their quarter, all receiving from the Central Palace the workings of wu and ji.

The *Commentary* states: *"The *Ten Wings*: ‘Heaven is noble, Earth is base—thus Qian and Kun are established.’"* The Immortal Elder expounds: *"When Heaven and Earth establish their positions, the *Yi* operates within them."* He further annotates: *"Heaven and Earth are the images of Qian and Kun; the establishment of positions is the arrangement of yin and yang in their paired stations. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li—Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun."*

His words are already detailed, his intent most earnest—how could he mean that the people of the world would fail to believe, being foolish and slow to awaken? The *Wings* say: *"Dividing yin and dividing yang, they alternate as soft and hard—thus the *Yi*’s six positions form a pattern."*

"The two functions" refer to Qian’s use of nine and Kun’s use of six. They have function but no fixed position. *"The use of nine: ‘Seeing a flock of dragons without a head is auspicious’"*—this speaks of the noble person practicing the Dao until virtue reaches its utmost. *"The use of six: ‘Profit lies in eternal steadfastness’"*—this speaks of Kun’s virtue as the utmost of the Dao, the way of the wife, the way of the minister, the way of Earth, which achieves no completion yet succeeds in bringing things to their end.

Thus, Kun’s function, being solitary yin, achieves nothing; only by using six in accord with Qian does it proceed with its kind. And Qian’s use of nine matches Kun—*"in the southwest, it gains companions."* The transformations of Qian and Kun each rectify their natures and destinies.

Qian’s Great Beginning, using nine to ride Kun, contains yin within yang, becoming empty and forming Li. Kun’s Great Unity, using six to receive Qian, contains yang within yin, becoming replete and forming Kan. Thus, Kan and Li obtain the exclusive illumination of yang’s essence, transforming and functioning, enfolding and nurturing, without ceasing. Like the sun and moon in the sky, now waxing to crescent and full, now waning to darkness and conjunction; like the yin and yang in the human body, now suddenly the Supreme Ultimate, now suddenly impermanent.

The Dao of the *Yi* repeatedly shifts, changing without abiding. If Qian and Kun were destroyed, there would be nothing by which to perceive the *Yi*. The sage thereby purifies the mind, retreats, and conceals in secrecy, reversing the course of the *Yi*’s Dao.

King Wen’s *Zhou Yi* assigns six lines to each hexagram, hence *"the six positions form a pattern,"* and also *"circulating through the six voids."* Their comings and goings, their waxing and waning, are never fixed, and their ascent and descent, their fullness and emptiness, are also without constancy. Thus, Qian first changes to *Gou*, and through successive changes reaches Kun; Kun first changes to *Fu*, and through successive changes reaches *Guai*. There are also the three sons and three daughters, mutually interchanging.

Moreover, among the sixty-four hexagrams, all undergo successive changes. One hexagram, including its wandering and returning souls, changes into eight hexagrams. There are also accumulated changes: one hexagram accumulates changes to become sixty-four hexagrams, and sixty-four hexagrams accumulate changes to become four thousand ninety-six hexagrams. *Fu* and *Gou* mutually conceive and gestate, each holding yin and yang, forming the ceaseless activity of the world—all is the Dao of this yin and yang.

This qi of the Dao of yin and yang may be concealed and submerged within the body, or hidden within the limbs; it may transform within and enfold the myriad things, or vigorously bestow life and death as the warp and woof of the Dao. Were it not for the wondrous functioning of Qian and Kun’s two functions as the warp and woof, the Dao would nearly cease.

*"By non-being they govern being; the vessels of function are empty."* What are non-being and being, these two? The division of the Supreme Ultimate has the prior Heaven and the posterior Heaven.

What is the prior Heaven? That which is above form is called the Dao—from being it enters non-being. What is the posterior Heaven? That which is below form is called the vessel—from non-being it enters being. Laozi said: *"Nameless, it is the beginning of Heaven and Earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things."* Hai Chan said: *"From non-being to being, all are thus; from being to non-being, how few can do it?"*

Tracing the waxing and waning of Kan and Li’s workings, the posterior Heaven is all vessel-form and dregs-substance, subject to waxing and waning, vanishing and perishing. It is not like the prior Heaven, which possesses the enduring Dao that can ascend to sagehood.

Confucius said: *"Preceding Heaven, it does not oppose it; following Heaven, it complies with its seasons."* The people of the world only follow the posterior Heaven’s Dao, hence they live and die, endlessly revolving. The sage skillfully reverses the prior Heaven’s Dao, hence extending knowledge and investigating things, rectifying the mind and cultivating the self, thereby abiding long without decay.

*"Counting what has passed proceeds in sequence; knowing what is to come reverses the count"*—thus the Dao of the *Yi* is a reverse reckoning.

*"Words are not idly fabricated"*—the books of the various masters and hundred schools are composed according to talent, their skill varying. This is the ancestral book of the Dao; one cannot carelessly insert a single word, lest later people be misled—this is what is meant by *"words are not idly fabricated."*

*"Discourses do not arise in vain"*—the Immortal Elder models himself on the Three Sages, aligning with yin and yang, emulating the sun and moon, and in accord with their kind, composes this book as a ladder and raft for the world—this is what is meant by *"discourses do not arise in vain."*

What is *"drawing upon verification and evident effects"*? In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ascended; Chao and Xu withdrew to lofty heights; Laozi transformed the Hu into Buddhas; in Huainan, even the chickens and dogs became immortals—these are all *"drawing upon verification and evident effects."*

What is meant by *"measuring and attuning to the numinous"*? It is like the sun and moon conjoining in splendor, their brilliance manifesting on the gengzi day.

*"To make it numinous and luminous depends on the person."* As for *"extending categories to structure the script"*—for instance, cinnabar arises from the moon, water mirrors the Kan trigram, and the sun and moon form the Changes, their heads uniting to complete the Dao—this is *"structuring the script."*

What is *"tracing principles as verification"*? When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises; when yang reaches its extreme, yin emerges. Following the flow of yin and yang gives rise to humans and all beings; reversing their application necessarily produces the Golden Elixir—this is *"tracing principles."*

*"Kan as wu, the essence of the moon"*—the true north is the position of Kan, within which lies true earth, called yang earth. The Woman constellation presides over it, concealing the latent yang essence. Wu is its gate, the domain of the moon’s hub, where the hornless hare dwells—white within and black without. This is yang within yin, outwardly feminine yet inwardly masculine.

*"Li as ji, the radiance of the sun"*—the true south is the position of Li, within which lies true earth, called yin earth. The Willow constellation presides over it, obscuring the hidden yin radiance. Ji is its portal, the abode of the sun’s wheel, where the three-legged crow resides—black within and white without. This is yin within yang, inwardly feminine yet outwardly masculine.

The ancients used *"the sun and moon as the Changes"* because the Changes are none other than yin and yang. Yet when one speaks of yin and yang, the Changes are not seen; when one speaks of the Changes, yin and yang are not seen.

Moreover, without earth, the myriad things cannot sprout; the sun and moon are precisely what gestate within earth. Thus, when the sun moves east, it passes through the earth of Root; when it traverses west, it passes through the earth of Stomach; when it journeys south, it passes through the earth of Willow; when it nurtures in the north, it passes through the earth of Woman. The sun and moon, by virtue of earth, endure in their brightness; earth, through the sun and moon, deepens its virtue.

Earth’s dominion cycles through the four seasons: spring’s birth and summer’s growth are earth’s work; autumn’s gathering and winter’s closure are earth’s power. Thus, each season has its ruling days, with earth long enthroned in the central palace, weaving through beginning and end to fulfill its function.

Though green, red, white, and black each reside in east, west, south, and north, they all derive from the two earths of wu and ji, jointly perfecting their virtue to enact numinous transformation.

This chapter speaks of yin and yang occupying distinct positions, yet whatever is employed must rely on earth—it contains no discourse on dragon-tiger, lead-mercury, metal-water, or the gathering of essences. Thus, it first describes the alignment of yin and yang’s paired positions, then states that each returns to its own quadrant. Other interpretations, failing to grasp the Immortal Elder’s intent, lack systematic organization, jumbling and cross-referencing without order, leading later readers of this book to mistakenly believe the Immortal Elder repeats himself at length. They do not recognize that these profound words follow a sequence.

**Chapter Three: The Sun and Moon as Hanging Images**

The Changes are images. Among the hanging images that display luminosity, none are greater than the sun and moon. To exhaust the numinous and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; they converge like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, emerging and entering, rolling and unrolling.

The Changes contain three hundred eighty-four lines; drawing lines yields hexagrams—sixty-four in total. From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen comes to receive the tally.

At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essences, the sun and moon mutually sustain each other. The potent yang scatters its dark emanation; the yielding yin transforms into a yellow vessel. Chaos intermingles, and the root of authority is planted. Cultivating and nurturing the bud, concentrating spirit to form the body—all creatures tread forth from this, and none that wriggle and move do not arise thereby.

The commentary states: Confucius said, *"No transformation is greater than that of the four seasons; among the hanging images that display luminosity, none are greater than the sun and moon."* The Immortal Elder reiterates this to clarify and affirm it.

This book models itself on the sun and moon to illustrate yin and yang: the sun and moon adhere to heaven and have their phases of conjunction and opposition; yin and yang exist in the world and have their sequences of compliance and reversal, generation and completion.

The sun is the pure yang qi, called the Great Yang; the moon is the pure yin essence, called the Great Yin. The celestial sphere spans three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter. Each day and night, heaven completes one revolution, constituting a single day.

The Great Sun travels one degree per day; traversing thirty degrees makes a month. The Great Moon travels slightly over thirty degrees per day; completing one revolution around heaven constitutes a month. The sun’s movement of one degree is called one day.

What is *"exhausting the numinous to know transformation"*? Among numinous things, none are more numinous than heaven and earth; among transformative wonders, none are more wondrous than yin and yang.

The Way of Heaven revolves leftward, completing one revolution each day, covering over five hundred fifty thousand *li*. Earth rests within its qi, motionless like a floating plank upon water.

The spirit of the Great Sun is the primordial qi of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly radiant, and the myriad things rely on its scorching yang fire to grow, mature, and bear fruit. Its diameter spans eight hundred forty-five *li* and some remainder. Its movement does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator but rather enters and exits within and beyond the ecliptic. When days are long, it is north of the celestial equator; when days are short, it is south of the ecliptic.

Why speak of north and south, inner and outer? Because the Purple Tenuity Enclosure’s imperial throne resides in the north, the north is called "inner," while the south is called "outer." Its spirit cannot be fully exhausted—this is the spirit of the Great Sun.

The spirit of the Great Moon is the supreme essence of heaven and earth. Its body is wholly dark, and the myriad things rely on its yin water’s transformative power to conceive, produce, nurture, and rear. Its diameter spans slightly over six hundred seventy *li*. Its movement does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator.

The ecliptic and celestial equator are like two intersecting rings, separated by twenty-four degrees. The moon travels between them, approximately six degrees from the ecliptic. Though its body is dark, when illuminated by the sun, it shines.

Master Duzhi used an image to instruct: employing a black lacquered ball beneath the eaves, when sunlight strikes it, the ball’s light projects far onto a dark wall. The moon’s round body, compared to the black lacquered ball, has light where the sun shines and darkness where it does not—hence it is always half-illuminated and half-dark.

At full moon, the sun and moon stand opposite each other—by night, the moon is in the sky while the sun lies beneath the earth, so its reflected light shines fully upon the human realm, while its dark side faces heaven, unseen by the world. At new moon, sun and moon share the same celestial longitude, the moon positioned below the sun; the side illuminated by the sun faces heaven entirely, while the dark side faces earth entirely. The moon lies twenty-five degrees from the earth, and only then does humanity perceive its faint glow. As the distance increases, the light grows more abundant. When the moon is nine to ten degrees from the sun, half its light is visible to people—hence it is called the "first quarter." After full moon, the light gradually diminishes. Thus, the moon’s body is never truly full or crescent; it depends solely on how much sunlight it receives. Foolish people may claim that at full opposition, the earth blocks the sun and moon. How could they comprehend the vastness of heaven or the principle that yin and yang’s *qi*, though seemingly obstructed, subtly communicate? Yet the apparent blemishes in the moon are indeed the shadow of the great earth. The sun’s body is large, the moon’s small; the sun is distant from heaven, while the moon is even farther. Yet the moon’s transformations cannot be fully revealed—this is the spirit of Great Yin. This is what is meant by "exhausting the spirit to know transformation."

*Zi* marks the beginning of yang; by *si*, yang reaches its peak, and at its extreme, yin arises. *Wu* marks the beginning of yin; by *hai*, yin reaches its peak, and at its extreme, yang arises. Cold and heat alternate, warmth and coolness balance; yin reaches its limit and yang is born, yang departs and yin arrives. Yin clings to yang as spokes to a wheel—spokes converge and the wheel turns; yin coils and yang unfurls.

"The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the lines’ hexagrammatic tokens" refers to each hexagram having six lines, each line comprising three tokens. Each day contains two hexagrams, and two hexagrams contain thirty-six tokens. As yin and yang intersect, the exchange does not last a full hour, nor does it exhaust a single line’s function—just as an hour contains three tokens, only one is employed. As one token moves, a single yang arises beneath *Kun* to form *Zhen*. *Zhen* signifies one yang subduing one yin—hence it is said, "When *Zhen* arrives, it receives the token." At this moment, heaven and earth unite in essence, and the myriad things, relying on emptiness, receive life. Sun and moon hold fast, the crow and hare intertwine inseparably. Yang stands firm and rigid, its azure mystery unfolding transformation; yin, yielding and receptive, envelops the yellow womb to contain nurturance. Within the obscure and chaotic, the two engage in union, the primal male and female first coupling to establish their foundation.

*Quan-yu* signifies the beginning. The ancients crafted scales starting with the *quan* (weight) and chariots beginning with the *yu* (carriage). Here, it speaks of the inception of creation. Moreover, *quan* means "temporary," and *yu* means "stable"—implying that temporary work must be most stable and not rigid or prone to collapse. The *qi* is managed to nourish the *yin* and *e* (the calyx and receptacle), congealing and spreading yang essence to form the bodily frame. This passage merely describes the initial division of the Great Ultimate, the beginning of yin and yang’s orderly progression, the birth of humanity and the myriad things. Thus it is said: "The multitudes tread forth, and all wriggling creatures emerge without exception."

People today, unaware of the post-celestial order’s progression, borrow the metaphor of "morning *Tun* and evening *Meng*," likening it to the root foundation of *yin* and *e*, and mistakenly apply it to the transformations within the elixir crucible. This is incorrect.

**Chapter Four: The Sage Observes On High**
Here, Confucius praises the Primordial Vastness, where the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* pervades emptiness. He examined antiquity to align with the Primordial Sovereign, where the *Guan Ju* establishes the beginning, marriage rites intertwine *qi*, and the first year sprouts growth. The sage is not born in vain; by observing on high, he reveals the celestial tally. The celestial tally advances and retreats, bending and stretching in accord with the seasons. Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven, and the hexagram *Fu* establishes the first sprouts. The eldest son inherits the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Ebb and flow respond to the pitch pipes, ascent and descent depend on the Dipper’s pivot. On the third day, brightness emerges, *Zhen* and *Geng* receive the west. On the eighth day, *Dui* receives *Ding*, the first quarter level as a string. On the fifteenth, the *Qian* body is complete, fullness flourishing in *Jia* of the east. The toad and hare’s essences, the sun and moon’s *qi* doubly bright—the toad observes the hexagram’s nodes, the hare emits living light. By seven and eight, the Dao’s path is complete, bending and lowering in descent. On the sixteenth, it turns to receive governance, *Xun* and *Xin* appear in the dawn’s clarity. *Gen* aligns with *Bing* in the south; the last quarter arrives on the twenty-third. On the thirtieth, *Kun* and *Yi* lie in the northeast, bereft of their companion. When the nodes are exhausted, they yield and succeed one another; the succeeding body revives the dragon. *Ren* and *Gui* pair with *Jia* and *Yi*, *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end. Seven and eight sum to fifteen, nine and six likewise correspond. These four combine to make thirty, and yang *qi* seeks concealment and vanishing. The eight trigrams arrange the luminaries, their movements never losing the center. The primordial essence is subtle and hard to perceive; one infers and measures it through tallying signs. At rest, observe its images, model its forms. Establish standards as a norm, determine auspice and inauspice through divination, issue decrees in accord with the seasons, never missing the moment of a moving line.

Above, examine the patterns of the *He Tu*; below, sequence the earth’s topography. In the middle, investigate the human heart, integrating and considering the Three Powers. In motion, follow the hexagram’s nodes; at rest, rely on the seal script’s words. *Qian* and *Kun* are put into practice, and only then is the world governed.

The commentary states: The *Wings* says, "The *Yi* has the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes"—this is "Confucius praises the Primordial Vastness." The virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* is a chaotic, empty mystery. The "Primordial Sovereign" refers to the beginning of Pan Gu’s opening of the world—this is Confucius examining antiquity. The *Guan Ju* concerns the proper human relationships between men and women, the foundation of marriage rites. Confucius ordered the *Odes*, placing husband and wife first to rectify the Dao of yin and yang without deviation. Confucius appended the *Wings* to the *Yi*, placing *Qian* and *Kun* first to clarify the principle that hardness and softness must pair. Thus, the *Appended Statements* says: The *Yi* accords with heaven and earth, and therefore can encompass the Dao of heaven and earth. Looking up, one observes the patterns of heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of earth—thus knowing the causes of the hidden and manifest.

Returning to the origin and reverting to the end, one thus understands the discourse on death and life.

What is meant by "origin"? It is to follow the Dao of yin and yang in their proper sequence to generate all beings, hence the saying "capping and marriage intertwine." This is called understanding life. What is meant by "reverting to the end"? It is to reverse the primordial Dao, transcending the mundane to attain sageliness, hence the saying "in the first year, the sprout burgeons." This is called understanding death.

Formerly, Zilu asked about death. The Master said: "Not yet understanding life, how can one understand death?" The sage delights in inquiry and scrutiny, yet regretted that Zilu at that moment did not further ask about the discourse on life and death, thereby revealing the Dao of the *Yi* to later generations—so that people might know the principle of following death and reversing life, recognize the meaning of harmonious virtue, and comprehend the Dao of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to reach destiny.

Thus, when the sage descends into the world, he gazes upward and examines below, carefully discerning yin and yang, taking yin as the tally and yang as destiny. What is meant by "observing above the manifest celestial tally"? The yin qi between heaven and earth is called the "celestial tally," while the yang qi is called "celestial destiny." The yin qi within the human body is called the "fire tally," and the yang qi is called "nature and destiny." When yin and yang contract and extend, the tally becomes the indicator of advance and retreat; when the tally’s indications are precise, one does not lose the proper time.

Therefore, the Dao of the *Yi* accords with the heart of heaven. The heart of heaven is the correct position of *Qian*; *Zi* is the gate where celestial yang is born. *Qian* is the yang entity, while the celestial tally is pure yin. The initial yang of *Qian* is born beneath two yins as *Zhen*; *Zhen* is the eldest son, reborn from *Kun*. *Fu* is one yang concealed beneath five yins; *Kun* is the mother, hence the saying "by the mother, the foundation is established."

The pitch standards respond to the pivot of the Dipper: the *Huangzhong* pitch resides in *Zi*, and the Dipper’s revolution begins at *Zi*, both corresponding to the time when the first yang sprouts. At the third watch of the third day, the moon’s faint yang is born in the southwest, while yang is born beneath the moon in the northern *Zhen*, hence the saying "*Zhen* receives *Geng* from the west." On the eighth day, the first quarter, *Dui* receives *Ding* fire, and yang ascends to the midpoint, level as a plumb line. On the fifteenth, at opposition, the sun is west and the moon east; the moon’s hare fully emits its light, and yang fills the hexagram’s body to form *Qian*. At dawn on the sixteenth, *Xun* appears at *Xin*, and the yin tally envelops yang to prevent its flight. On the twenty-third, the yin tally half-encases the light, which ceases at the last quarter.

"*Kun* and *Yi* on the thirtieth day": the moon’s body is wholly dark, white stillness and black purity, its light turned toward heaven. "The northeast loses its companion": the northeast is *Gen*, the region of *Ji* water, and *Gen* is the ghostly path. Within the human body, when *Gui* fills the meridians, it depletes the qi; when the node is exhausted and *Gui* is spent, the first yang revives. Thus *Ren* and *Gui* are paired with *Jia* and *Yi*, like *Qian* beginning anew. Seven, eight, nine, six—when the numbers end at thirty, the end completes *Kun*, and true qi returns to storage.

Thus, in the eight trigrams, *Qian* and *Kan* reside in the north, *Gen* and *Zhen* return to the east, *Xun* and *Li* revert to the south, and *Kun* and *Dui* return to the west. They interweave and array the luminaries, shifting and moving without losing the center. The center is the heart of heaven, the Great Central Ultimate, the primordial essence—subtle and invisible.

Heaven produces sages to investigate, measure, and verify, using tally and evidence. They observe the images of the sun and moon, modeling their forms. Like those who oversee the heavens, they erect gnomons to measure shadows, establishing standards to foretell the seasons and examine auspiciousness and inauspiciousness. When issuing a decree, one must follow the seasons, aligning with the movement of lines to know when yang is born.

Gazing upward, they examine the *River Chart*, clarifying the celestial images of yin-yang conjunctions; looking downward, they arrange the earth’s forms, detailing the wondrous transformations of *Kun*’s metal and water. Within, they examine the human heart, issuing decrees in accord with the times, moving in step with the hexagram’s nodes, reviving *Zhen* to follow the primal, and resting in accordance with the *Tuan* text.

Great is the origin of *Qian*: clouds move and rain descends, the myriad beings flow into form, embracing vastness and brilliance, yielding and compliant, beneficial and upright. When the celestial patterns are observed, the earth’s forms are established, and the human heart is rectified, then the gates of *Qian* and *Kun* implement the Dao of yin and yang, enabling heaven, earth, and all beings to attain governance in accordance with nature.

This chapter draws on the sage’s investigation of antiquity and observation of heaven as a metaphor, illuminating the conjunction of sun and moon and embodying the functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. It enables people to distinguish yin and yang, recognize advance and retreat, understand creation and transformation, model forms, respond to tally and node, and be cautious in movement and stillness. Thus, the heaven and earth within the self are governed—without recourse to the language of dragons and tigers, cauldrons, or extraction and addition.

**Chapter Five: The Sovereign Governing the Polity**

The beginning of governing the polity lies in renewing the old and reforming the obsolete. It encompasses the subtle and dense, unfurling and spreading treasures. The essential Dao holds the handle of authority, unifying the web of transformation. When lines move within, good and ill fortune arise without; the five planets move in disarray or order, responding to the times and stirring in resonance. When the four and seven are perverse, *Chi* and *Li* bow and rise. *Wenchang* oversees the records, interrogating and holding the Three Dukes accountable; the hundred officials and functionaries each administer their departments.

The sun harmonizes the essence of the five phases; the moon receives the discipline of the six pitches. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, they begin anew. Tracing the origin and grasping the end, one holds the threads of survival and demise. If the sovereign is arrogant and dissolute, overbearing and transgressing the Dao; or if ministers are treacherous and flattering, acting contrary to the proper path—then the waxing and waning of the moon’s phases, their excesses and deficiencies, will deviate and bring misfortune.

Those who enforce the law admonish and criticize, interrogating faults to admonish the ruler. The Pole Star receives its rectitude, at ease and entrusting matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall enacts governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao.

The annotation states: The Immortal Elder uses the difficulty of refining the elixir as an analogy for governing the state, thereby revealing the challenge of pacifying the unruly populace. In all elixir refinement, one knows the difficulty of restraining the "mind-steed." To wash away old stains and worldly defilements, renewing all things—this is the first principle of governance, called "renewing the tripod." To curb anger and restrain desire, turning toward goodness upon seeing it—this is the foundation of self-cultivation, called "abolishing the old." Whether governing or cultivating the self, one must begin with oneself. The most subtle and intricate matters must first be grasped and thoroughly governed; thus, in governance, governance is achieved, and in treasuring the body, the body is cultivated.

Confucius said: "In governance, employ virtue. It is like the North Star dwelling in its place, while the multitude of stars pay homage." Virtue is not merely for governance—it is the origin of all conduct. Can those who refine the elixir be without virtue? What, then, is virtue? Benevolence, compassion, love, clarity, and sincerity—these are the marks of one of supreme virtue. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness—these are the gates to entering the Dao. In refining the elixir, one must prioritize kindness and diligence, for kindness suffices to employ others. The Immortal Elder thus says, "To unfold and distribute treasure": externally, one wins the people’s joy; internally, one treasures one’s true qi. This is the pivotal handle of the essential Dao. Only by repeatedly distributing treasure can one unify and transform the guiding threads. These threads are the masters of law enforcement; when skillfully unified and transformed, those who enforce the law do not suffer under its constraints.

When the hexagram images stir internally, fortune and misfortune manifest externally—just as the five planets, whether in harmony or discord, evoke timely responses of fortune and misfortune. "誃離" carries the same meaning: 誃 means to change, and 離 means to shift or move. It speaks of the twenty-eight constellations, perverse and shifting, all bowing and rising. "文昌" is the ruling star of the Supreme Subtlety, the six stars of the Dipper’s basket in the south, called the Southern Pole’s governing star. In the human body, it is the spirit of the Vermilion Bird, recording one’s name in the register of long life. The star of emptiness and essence is the guiding thread of the Three Terraces, their leader, and in the human body, it governs the Bright Hall, unfolding virtue to enlighten the world. The hidden radiance of the Mysterious Subtlety’s auxiliary stars are the two stars of the Revered Emperor; in the human body, they are the spirit of the Dark Warrior. If one encounters them, one’s lifespan may reach a thousand years. The remaining countless spirits of the body’s nodes and deities "each govern their respective domains."

Refining the elixir is intimately tied to the workings of creation, hence its comparison to the difficulty of governance. Again, the stars are used as metaphors for the body. "The sun harmonizes with the essence of the five phases": in the months of *zi*, *chou*, and *yin*, the sun aligns with the five planets in the north; in *mao*, *chen*, and *si*, in the west; in *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*, in the south; in *you*, *xu*, and *hai*, in the east. In the time of Yao, the celestial center was established at *zi*, with the winter solstice on *jiachen*, the sun positioned at the Void and Rat; in the Han’s *Taichu* era, the winter solstice saw the sun at the Oxherd; in the Tang’s *Taiyan* era, at the Eastern Dipper; from the Song to the present, at the Southern Winnowing Basket. This is called the precession of the equinoxes. Thus, the sun gains radiance from fire and earth, and brilliance from metal and water.

"Moon receives the discipline of the six pitches": the *lü* are yang, the *lü* are yin; one and five, one and six, two combine to make thirty. Thirty degrees complete a cycle, and the sun and moon meet again—hence, "when the degrees are complete, they begin anew." The sun and moon circulate in endless return, giving rise to the waxing, full, waning, and new moons; the world, through these phases, experiences the alternation of cold and heat; people, through the alternation of cold and heat, undergo birth, aging, illness, and death. Tracing the origin enables long preservation; grasping the end prevents demise.

The "sovereign" is the heart; the "ministers" are the body. The heart is the self; the body is the external. If the self’s heart is arrogant and overbearing, or self-satisfied and overflowing, or if the body and externals contend, not following the proper path, then the waxing and waning phases deviate, excesses and deficiencies bring misfortune, and those who enforce the law admonish and criticize, interrogating faults to admonish their master. The Pole Star is the aforementioned Wenchang star, also called the Southern Pole. The Pole Star upholds rectitude and acts, at ease and entrusting matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall is the grand mentor, diligently enacting good governance, ensuring the state suffers no deviation. The state is also the body; when the body is at peace and qi harmonized, the Dao is unharmed.

This chapter compares the cultivation of the self and the refinement of the elixir to a ruler’s governance of the state. When governing the state, if one appoints the right people and implements policies, the world is at peace; when cultivating the self, if one exhausts the heart and establishes destiny, the elixir path is achieved. In other versions, the phrase "renewing the tripod, abolishing the old" is absent from "the first principle of governance." This text has circulated for a long time, and later generations, unable to fathom its profound words, introduced many discrepancies. Zhu Xi of the Huian school corrected several hundred characters but could not perfect it. Without encountering a sagely teacher, it is difficult to distinguish jade from stone.

**Chapter Six: Establishing the Foundation through Self-Refinement**
Inwardly nurture the self, abiding in tranquility and emptiness. Trace the origin of the hidden and the manifest, inwardly illuminating the body. Seal the orifices, fortify the spiritual root. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nourishing the child-pearl. Though unseen, it is near and easily sought. The Yellow Center gradually penetrates principle, its moisture reaching the skin. The beginning is upright, and the end is cultivated; the stem is established, yet it cannot be grasped. The One is concealed, unknown to the world.

The annotation states: "Nurturing the self" means refining the self throughout one's life. Confucius said: "The noble person perfects their person before acting, harmonizes their heart before speaking, and stabilizes their relationships before making requests. The noble person cultivates these three, and thus remains whole." The sagely ones deeply contemplate and thoroughly examine human nature and reality. Every action, every word, every request—these three are the ultimate principles for entering sageliness, the essential teachings for nurturing the self. Treasuring essence and enriching qi is nurturing the self; facing circumstances and forgetting the heart is refining the self; constantly abiding in stillness and responding to change is refining the self; accumulating virtue and accomplishing merit is refining the self. Strenuous practice of these matters is called refinement; mastery of these matters is called refinement. Those who cultivate the elixir must first refine the self, enduring hardship and humiliation. Only then, when entering the chamber, can the six roots be firmly stabilized, the practice become fully mature, and all that can be forgotten be forgotten—thus enabling the task to be accomplished.

Therefore, the Dao of the *Great Learning* lies in "illuminating the luminous virtue," in "understanding others," and in "abiding in perfect goodness." Having illuminated virtue and understood others, abiding in perfect goodness—this precisely accords with refining the self. Moreover, "only after knowing where to abide can one be settled; only after being settled can one be still; only after being still can one be at peace; only after being at peace can one contemplate; only after contemplating can one attain." This precisely accords with the essentials of "abiding in tranquility and emptiness." "Emptiness" does not mean utter voidness. The immortal master said: "The primordial qi emerges from emptiness"—this is the ultimate of "abiding in tranquility and emptiness."

"Tracing the origin" means seeking from the source of one's own birth, thereby knowing that true essence and true spirit (the one being qi) are the foundation of this body. "Hidden and manifest": ordinary people are often enslaved by cleverness, depleting their spirit and qi. Great cultivators dismiss cleverness, set aside wisdom, inwardly illuminate the body, outwardly forget the self, seal the orifices and fortify the spiritual root, withdraw their gaze and warmly nurture the child-pearl. Only thus can the Yellow Center penetrate principle and the skin be moistened and lustrous.

"Beginning upright" refers to the work of refining the self; cultivation pertains to the task of tending the furnace. "The stem is established" exhausts the Dao of refining the self; the final grasp pertains to the work of entering the chamber. "The One" refers to the self, to *wu* (戊). Comprehending this "One" is to have penetrated to the heart-ground of [Laozi] Boyang. Confucius said: "My Dao is threaded by the One." Laozi said: "Attaining the One, all things are complete." The Buddhists say: "The myriad dharmas return to the One." Thus, "Heaven One generates water"—one must know that this water arises from within the One. The "within the One" is the central line of *kan* (坎). When the One is concealed, essence and spirit gather; when the One is obscured, the numinous is distributed and qi is spread. If one can know the One, the cosmos lies in one's hands; if one can attain the One, the myriad transformations arise within the body. The wonder of the One cannot be understood without a teacher. Thus it is said: "The One is concealed, unknown to the world." It is also said: "That none know it is its wonder."

In the immortal elder's method of the elixir, one must first "fortify the spiritual root"—this is refining the self to congeal spirit; "warmly nurturing the child-pearl" is accumulating essence to amass qi. Only when the work of refining the self is pure can one proceed to refine the returned elixir. Ordinary people, not knowing the greatness of refining the self, rashly undertake the work of obtaining the medicine in half a day, hoping for success—how foolish this is!

Thus the *Scripture of Purity* says: "Inwardly observe the heart, outwardly observe the form. Observe distant things—only emptiness is seen. Emptiness is not empty; what is empty is already nothing. Nothingness is not nothing; nothingness is already nothing. Profoundly still, stillness is not still." When speech reaches this point, how could ordinary people not see this as the time of great rest and great liberation? Yet why does it then say, "How could desire arise"? When desire does not arise, this is true stillness; only true stillness can respond to things. Carefully considered, attaining true stillness and responding to things is merely the beginning task for learners. As for discussing the cultivation of the elixir—one has not even dreamed of it.

Ordinary people may offer a single meal, build a single pagoda, engage in "three-peak" sexual practices, sit in dry meditation reciting scriptures, practice "non-action," or pray and sacrifice—all such acts may be considered good deeds, but if one calls this "cultivating the Dao," one has truly not yet found the gate to enter.

Thus, the work of nurturing the self cannot be lacking in the slightest. As Lü Dongbin said: "For the sevenfold returned elixir, one must first refine the self and await the time." Master Niwan said: "Without shared language, they are not kin; without sufficient effort, the work is not round." Master Ziyang said: "If you wish to refine the ninefold cycle, first refine the self and hold the heart." The transmission from sage to sage—how could one not receive it with utmost sincerity?

When the Perfected of Great Emptiness received the instructions of Master Yellow Chamber, he followed the teachings to Mount Wuyi and set about his task. At first, while refining the self, obstacles and demons assailed him a hundredfold. The Perfected of Great Emptiness resolutely declared: "Bind and send off the demonic essences, behead the six ghostly peaks." Once settled in stillness, as soon as this thought arose, the root of attachment was suddenly severed. Later learners, observing this matter of refining the self, should reflect deeply.

This chapter speaks only of nurturing the self, without mention of golden tigers, tripods, or chambers. To interpret the Three Luminaries as yang fire, yin tally, and golden embryo would be even more mistaken.

**Chapter Seven: Illuminating the Two Apertures**
The superior virtue acts without contrivance, not seeking through observation. The inferior virtue acts, its function unceasing. When the upper is closed, it is called "having"; when the lower is closed, it is called "nothing." "Nothing" serves the "having"; above, the numinous virtue resides. These two apertures follow this method, and the golden qi likewise assists. Knowing the white and guarding the black, the numinous and bright will come of themselves. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named One. The beginning of yin and yang, it darkly contains the yellow sprout. The master of the five metals, the river chariot of the north. Thus, lead is black without but inwardly holds golden splendor—clad in coarse cloth yet bearing jade, outwardly a madman.

The metal is the mother of water, the mother conceals the child’s embryo.
The water is the child of metal, the child harbors the mother’s womb.
The perfected person is most subtle—now present, now absent,
vaguely like the great abyss, now sinking, now floating.
Retreating, they disperse and spread, each guarding their own domain.
Gathered, it resembles white; refined, it becomes vermilion.
Tempered into defense and guard, the true resides within the white.
Square or round, an inch in diameter, blended yet mutually constrained.
Born before heaven and earth, majestic and exalted.
Beside it stand ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s isle.
Encircling and sealing, four pathways hesitate.
Guarded and secured, firmly blocking all wickedness.
Curved yet interconnected, to ward against the unforeseen.
One may remain free from thought, yet find it hard to endure sorrow and toil.
The chamber fills with numinous qi, none can detain it.
Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish.
In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies humanity.

The annotation states: The “upper virtue” refers to one whose embodiment is complete in virtue, a person of “nothing not done.” When men and women reach the age of sixteen, their true essence is whole yet on the verge of leakage. Those of complete virtue can preserve and cherish it without any loss. Moreover, encountering an enlightened teacher who imparts the Dao of effortless cultivation and nurturance, they thereby extend their lifespan—this is called a person of “nothing not done,” the fully realized person of upper virtue. Such is the sage’s practice of effortless transformation, the great person’s achievement of effortless accomplishment.

The “lower virtue” refers to one who steals from the workings of creation, a person who plunders the myriad things. All people, upon reaching the age of sixteen, possess true essence yet to be leaked, called “pure Qian.” Once desire stirs, the middle line of Qian moves into the Kun palace, and Qian can no longer remain pure, its heart emptied into Li. Thereafter, day and night it leaks away; how much remains even if preserved? Only the perfected person, without awaiting its extremity, practices the sage’s way of restoring wholeness, thereby immortalizing the body. This is called a person of lower virtue, one who steals from the workings of creation. Such is the sage’s way of following nature, the divine person’s achievement through effort.

The person of upper virtue practices non-action yet accomplishes all, attaining the complete body of the Great Ultimate and perfecting the work of the posterior heaven. This is called “not seeking through observation.” The person of lower virtue acts with purpose, seizing the function of creation to perfect the work of the prior heaven. This is called “its function unceasing.”

The immortal master said: “At first, action is unseen by others; only when it reaches non-action do the multitudes begin to know. Though they see non-action as the essential subtlety, who knows that action is the root foundation?” These words exhaust the matter of the golden elixir—it is no easy task, and the perfected person practices it only when unavoidable. Thus Laozi said: “Fine weapons are inauspicious tools, used only when unavoidable.” This is what he meant.

“When the upper is closed, it is called ‘having’”—“the upper closed” is Kun, and Kun’s virtue is to contract in stillness. “Having” is the wu earth within Kan, containing the prior-heaven true qi of the One. “When the lower is closed, it is called ‘nothing’”—“the lower closed” is Qian, and Qian’s virtue is to concentrate in stillness. “Nothing” is the ji earth within Li, inwardly harboring the posterior-heaven spontaneous mercury. Here, the two apertures of dual function are revealed.

The Classic states: “Always without desire, observe its mystery; always with desire, observe its apertures. These two emerge together yet differ in name, both called the profound. Profound upon profound, the gateway of the myriad mysteries.” The sage has no dual mind; their profound words and subtle teachings are never lofty or remote, yet for ten thousand generations none can fathom their beginnings. One must receive them through a teacher’s transmission. Even the supremely sagely Yellow Emperor, had he not studied under Guangchengzi, how could he have illuminated this Dao? Even regarding such apertures, the sage finds no recourse but to describe them to the utmost: Fuxi drew the trigrams, beginning with the Qian and Kun images to define this aperture; King Wen did not conceal it but further clarified it; Confucius, in the *Wings*, expounded the meaning of Qian’s straightness and Kun’s openness; Laozi spoke of “the gate of the mysterious female, called the root of heaven and earth”; Śākyamuni likened it to the treasury of the true Dharma eye and the wondrous mind of nirvana. All these are direct pointers, clearly visible.

The superior person may be able to illuminate this aperture on their own, yet its functions and workings remain obscure without a teacher. “‘Nothing’ serves the ‘having’”—“nothing” refers to one’s nature, “having” to the wu emotions. If one’s nature can serve the wu emotions, then the emotions’ righteousness will surely cherish the nature’s benevolence. “Above, the numinous virtue resides”—for the prior-heaven qi of the One arises from the midst of emptiness and non-being, this is the virtue of the numinous.

The immortal elder emphatically points out: “These two apertures follow this method, the golden qi likewise assists.” These two lines are the key to the *Cantong qi*; for ten thousand generations, even the wise and discerning like Yan and Min cannot comprehend them on their own. Master Yunfang said: “The gate that gives me life is the door that brings my death; how many are truly awake, how many truly enlightened? Last night, the iron man pondered deeply: long life and immortality are made by human effort.” Is not “the gate that gives me life, the door that brings my death” none other than the two empty apertures? Just as previously explained—the principles of Qian and Kun, the sun and moon’s transformations—only now is the mysterious pass determined, and the two substances of metal and water pointed out. The sequence of the text is not arbitrary.

The cultivator of the elixir, having clarified this aperture, must further investigate what the “golden qi” is and what “assists” signifies, penetrating and understanding them thoroughly before proceeding to refine the elixir. “Knowing the white and guarding the black”—knowing the metal’s essence is pure, white and unstained, this is “knowing the white.” Guarding the black’s foundation, awaiting the time when water is born, this is “guarding the black.” The water’s initial arising is called “prior-heaven,” and because of its utmost truth, it is named “numinous and bright.” When white and black correspond, metal and water flourish abundantly; upon encountering ji earth, water is restrained and metal is washed. With metal and water filling the crucible, it is said that “the numinous and bright will come of themselves.”

What is meant by “water is the pivot of the Dao, its number named one”? It is because water arises from the Heavenly One, thus serving as “the beginning of yin and yang.” As for “the mysterious containing the yellow sprout,” the *Yi* states: “Though yin possesses beauty, it contains it to serve the king’s work.” Here, the Great Primal is water, and the yellow sprout is the elixir—within water lies the elixir. Hence the metaphor: “the mysterious containing the yellow sprout.” Within black lead, white metal is concealed; within the river chariot, the yellow sprout is hidden. This is like a scholar bearing jade, whose coarse garment wards off harm.

“Metal is the mother of water,” for dui metal generates kan water, and the central line of kan belongs to metal. Thus it is said: “the mother concealed in the child’s womb.” Water is the child of metal; the waters of ren and gui arise from the west, and the central line of dui belongs to kan. Hence it is said: “the child hidden in the mother’s womb.”

“The Perfected One is most wondrous”: the Perfected One is the body of qian. As a thing, qian is supremely numinous and wondrous; in form, it may be present or absent. The great abyss is the image of kun. As a thing, kun can sink or float; in form, it is unseen and unheard. Thus qian possesses the power of transformation, while kun’s virtue sustains generation. Once generation is complete, qian and kun distribute themselves, each guarding its domain.

“Gathering it resembles whiteness”: this refers to silver within lead, which is white. When refined into internal elixir (or national elixir), it becomes vermilion; when smelted alone, it forms ceruse. Gathering it for external elixir follows the same principle. Yet with external elixir, one must always provide protection: outwardly it appears as the radiant red of cinnabar, while inwardly it retains its true whiteness.

“Square and round, a inch in diameter, blending and restraining one another”: within the profound darkness lies a thing—the time before the Great Ultimate divided, when the primordial true qi of prior heaven was contained within it, dwelling before the Great Ultimate, prior to the image of the Lord. Thus it is called “majestic and exalted.”

“Beside it stand ramparts and gates, resembling Penglai’s gourd”: the image of qian resembles both ramparts and gates, and also Penglai’s gourd. These metaphors describe the vessel’s form, referring to the crucible in all cases above.

“Encircled and sealed”: this is protection.
“Four passages, vigilantly guarded”: external defense is tight.
“Guard and secure it firmly”: it must not be left for even a moment—what can be abandoned is not the Dao.
“Block and repel the perverse”: its ingress and egress follow the rule, demarcating inner and outer to instill caution, ensuring the true white within remains undisturbed.

“Winding corridors connect”: one must establish an altar and refine with care to guard against unforeseen harm. The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, instructs in detail from “encircled and sealed” onward, fearing unexpected calamity. One must remain free of thought and worry, avoiding sorrow and toil. Thus it is said: “It can endure thoughtlessness, but not sorrow and labor.” When “the qi of spirit fills the chamber” without depletion, it is said: “Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish.” If even slightly unsteady, ruin follows.

Therefore, in “movement and stillness, rest and repose,” one must never dare to be careless or negligent. Then the qi of the golden crucible, firm in both self and other, will mutually harmonize and subdue. Thus it is said: “It is ever with one.”

This chapter directly points to the essence of the two apertures, illuminating the function of metal and water. For those who cultivate the Dao, upon reading the *Cantong Qi* to this point, they will realize that the very first step is already a matter of great difficulty. Yet those of lesser virtue, practicing the Dao of deliberate action, rely entirely on refining the self. If the refinement of the self is even slightly deficient, the spirit and clarity will not come.

In the eighth chapter, *Discerning the True and the False*, it is said:
*“Discrimination is a method of traversing the viscera;
Inner contemplation involves thought.
One treads the steps of the Dipper’s lodges,
And the six jia by day and celestial stems.”*
Those who follow the yin path, weary of the nine-and-one,
Confuse and disturb the primordial womb.
They ingest qi, causing the intestines and stomach to rumble,
Exhaling the upright and inhaling external perversities.
Day and night they do not sleep,
Never resting from the new moon to the dark of the moon.
Their bodies grow daily weary,
Their state confused, as if deranged.
The hundred vessels seethe and surge,
Unable to attain clarity and tranquility.
They pile earth to erect altars,
Morning and evening offering reverent sacrifices.
Spirits manifest in forms,
And dreams stir deep emotions.
Their hearts rejoice, their minds delight,
Believing they will surely prolong their years—
Yet suddenly they die before their time,
Their bodies rotting and exposed.
Their every action goes awry,
Rebellious and contrary, losing the pivot of the mechanism.
The arts are many,
A thousand methods, ten thousand more,
Yet all proceed in violation of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi,
Twisting and turning, opposing the Nine Capitals.
The wise perceive the purport of these words,
And in an instant know the source.
Diligent in practice, they labor day and night without rest.

After three years of ingesting the elixir, one becomes light and roams afar, walking through fire without scorching, entering water without getting wet. One can appear or vanish at will, abiding in perpetual joy without sorrow. When the Dao is accomplished and virtue perfected, one conceals oneself to await the proper time. Then the Great One summons, relocating one to the Central Isles. With merits fulfilled, one ascends on high, receiving the register and the celestial chart.

The commentary states: Those who cultivate the path must comprehend the true essence of the Great Dao. Without the harmonization of yin and yang or the transformation of Kan and Li, all else is but heterodox and misguided practice. For instance, inwardly visualizing the five viscera and exhaling through imagined breaths, or outwardly treading the Dipper’s steps while forming mudras; or practicing the arts of the bedchamber, mastering the Three Peaks with women; or pursuing the Nine-and-One Dao, wielding the sword with five techniques, engaging in qi-exchange amidst circumstances—all these muddle and defile the primordial embryo, constituting impure conduct and the lowest of heterodox ways. Likewise, expelling the upright and inhaling the perverse, enduring hunger to ingest qi; or discussing the year while sitting in meditation, remaining sleepless day and night; or erecting altars to sacrifice to spirits, where ghostly apparitions manifest—these too are heterodox practices that disorder the Dao. They cause the spirit to become disoriented, the hundred vessels to seethe and surge, the heart to rejoice daily, and dreams to stir nightly. Though there are a thousand paths and a hundred byways, all suddenly yield no merit. Having violated the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and failing to align with a true master’s transmission of yin-yang harmony, one twists and turns, incurring the Nine Capitals’ wrath. How then can one coalesce the essence of a single millet-grain pearl? What was hoped to prolong life instead shortens it.

Yet if there are those of discernment who encounter the words of a true master, they will suddenly grasp the path and practice it diligently without slackening. Day and night they labor without rest to seek the medicine, focusing their minds on ingesting the elixir and secretly cultivating for three years. Then, freely roaming afar, in nine years they may become light enough to ascend. After twelve years of accumulation, neither water nor fire can harm them. Dwelling in grotto-heavens, they live without sorrow; feasting in the Jasper Pool, they abide in eternal joy. Once the Dao is achieved, they conceal themselves further, accumulating virtue to await the proper time. When their names are recorded in the Three Heavens, the Great One summons them to assume immortal offices and relocate to the Central Isles. Should their merits be lofty, they ascend through the Three Realms, receiving promotions and honors, bearing the register and the celestial chart. Thus did the sages Zhang, Ge, Jingyang, Fuqiu, Zhong, and Lü follow and practice this path.

In this chapter, the Immortal Elder forcefully distinguishes between delusion and clarity, between perversity and uprightness. Perversity incurs the Nine Capitals’ punishment, while uprightness, when fully cultivated, leads to ascension—this is the inevitable principle, leaving no room for doubt. As for the step-by-step work of practice, it follows in the next section.

**Chapter Nine: The Two Bowstrings of Dragon and Tiger**

The fire tally is not employed in vain; the *Yi* elucidates it.
The recumbent moon serves as the crucible and cauldron,
The White Tiger as the pivot of refinement;
Mercury, the sun, as the flowing pearl,
The Green Dragon accompanying it.
Raising the east to meet the west,
Hun and po naturally bind each other.
The upper bowstring, Dui, holds the number eight,
The lower bowstring, Gen, also eight.
When the two bowstrings unite their essence,
The body of Qian and Kun is complete.
Two eights make one catty,
The Dao of the *Yi* stands firm and unshaken.

The commentary states: Here the Immortal Elder unfolds the discourse on the crucible, cauldron, dragon, tiger, and bowstring qi. The "recumbent moon crucible," "White Tiger," "upper bowstring," "Dui," and "po" pertain to the west, the other, the Jade Pool. The "mercury sun," "flowing pearl," "Green Dragon," "lower bowstring," "Gen," and "hun" pertain to the east, the self, the Golden Tripod.

The "recumbent moon crucible" is the crucible of the Great One, a yin crucible, so named for its recumbent shape resembling the moon at its first crescent. The "White Tiger" is the being of the western Dui palace. When heaven and earth first divided, it originally belonged to the other. The tiger’s majesty responds when invoked; vast and encompassing, it nurtures the myriad things. Though capable of harming or killing, it harbors the vast qi of the Great Vehicle. King Wen, in his profound *Yi*, said: *"Treading on a tiger’s tail, it does not bite the person—smooth and successful."* And again: *"Treading the path level and broad, the secluded person’s correctness brings good fortune."* Confucius said: *"Joyful and responsive to Qian."* And again: *"The plain treading of the path—walking alone with one’s wishes."* Those who refine the elixir must first revere this tiger and subdue it. Once subdued, it can serve as the pivot of refinement without biting.

The south, Li, is the sun and mercury, containing cinnabar, called the "flowing pearl." The "Green Dragon" is the being of the eastern Zhen palace. Once the kalpa is established, it originally belongs to the self. This dragon’s power can transform; responsive and penetrating, it moves clouds and dispenses rain, causing the myriad things to flow. Qian’s nine-two says: *"Seeing the dragon in the field—auspicious to meet the great person."* Confucius said: *"Dragon virtue in correct centrality."* People fail to grasp this dragon’s life-generating power, often suffering its harm. If one awakens to it, reveres it, and regulates and subdues it, one can then harness and employ it.

Raising the east to meet the west is a joyous union in accord with ritual. Dui and Gen each hold the number eight, flowing from wu to unite with ji. "Hun and po naturally bind each other"—metal and wood do not obstruct. When the two bowstrings unite their essence, the body of Qian and Kun is complete. The Dao of the *Yi* does not falter because two eights balance to form one catty. One catty refers to the number of perfection. Numbers accumulate from small to large: ten grains make a pill, one pill like a millet grain, a millet grain’s surplus is a *daogui*, sixty-four millet grains make one *gui*, ten millet grains make a *lei*, ten *lei* make a *zhu*, two *zhu* and four *lei* make a *qian*, ten *qian* make a *liang*, eight *zhu* make a *zi*. The *Shuowen* says: *"Six zhu make a zi,"* and the *Jian Yun*: *"Eight liang make a zi"*—both are incorrect. Three *zi* make a *liang*, which is twenty-four *zhu*. Sixteen *liang* make one catty, which contains three hundred eighty-four *zhu*.

One catty and four *liang* make a *lüe*. The ancients divided *zhu* to correspond to the numbers of the hexagrams and lines.

**Chapter Ten: Gold Returns to Its Nature**

Gold enters fierce fire, yet its color does not lose its radiant essence.
Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never dimmed their brightness.
Gold does not lose its weight; the sun and moon retain their constant forms.
Gold is originally born from the moon, receiving the sun’s tally at the new moon’s dawn.
Gold returns to its mother; at the moon’s wane, sun and moon envelop each other.
Concealing its frame, it sinks into the profound void.
Gold restores its original nature; its majestic light makes the cauldron glow.

The commentary states: The Immortal Elder does not speak idly—only here does he point to gold’s true function. Without gold’s efficacy, the elixir cannot be completed, hence the term “gold elixir.” Yet this is not the gold or jade of the world, nor that which emerges from earth and stone. It is the marvel of heaven and earth’s transformative workings, the inversion of the Five Phases, born from the great crucible of Qian and Kun—this is the true gold. Today’s blind masters, upon hearing of the gold elixir, grow flustered, not knowing what to do. They speak of cultivation but have never truly heard the name of the gold elixir, nor do they fathom the words of the *Cantong Qi*, deceiving the world. How could they know the Immortal Elder’s clear and detailed instructions on this gold’s divine transformations? Many who encounter this text fail to examine the true body and function of yin-yang gold, instead guessing it refers to furnace-smelting and the like. What a pity! How deluded! If no hint of its meaning were revealed to the world, then in ten thousand generations, this text would grow ever more distant. People, unable to glimpse its shores, would abandon it entirely—how then could they seek the essence of cultivation?

Those of superior capacity must know that this gold existed before the primordial chaos of *hongmeng*, at the very beginning when the Great Ultimate had not yet divided. Originally belonging to Qian, it is thus called “Qian gold.” When the great kalpa is about to turn, those who would repay the debt to the chaos of *hongmeng* do so as Qian first joins with Kun. This gold, tumbling and galloping, rushes into the palace of Kun, and is called “gold within Kun.” Kun, receiving this gold, becomes inwardly replete and transforms into Kan. Kun’s three lines were originally all empty, called “Kun earth”; having obtained this gold to fill its center, it forms the Kan trigram. Kan’s proper position is in the north, the land of *gui* water. As Kan is water, with gold concealed within, it is called “gold within water.”

This gold within water is the treasure of the primordial, yet it cannot long remain in the postnatal Kan. Thus, it transforms into Dui. Dui may leap at the gate of Kan in the north, occupying the west in the *you* direction, where this gold grows day and night. *You*’s proper position belongs to Dui, and thus this gold governs the Dao of the elixir within Dui, hence it is called “Dui gold.” Those who refine the elixir must seek the subtle and probe the obscure, tracing origins to ends, investigating things to attain knowledge, exploring its source and flow, examining its roots and sprouts. If one refines the gold elixir, one must seek this gold. To seek this gold, do not seek in Qian, nor in Kun, nor in Kan—seek solely in Dui.

Dui, as a thing, is of the same kind as Kun’s moon, as the saying goes: *“Work is easily done with the same kind; skill is difficult with the unlike.”* Dui’s marvel is that it carries out Kun’s Dao. Thus, in refining the gold elixir, apart from this Dui gold, all else is mere side paths and cannot accomplish the Way. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, ancient sages and immortals, all used this gold to attain the Dao.

King Wen doubled Xun’s nine-five: three days before *geng*, three days after *geng*. Confucius’s *Wing* says: *“Xun and Dui are yielding, both compliant with the firm. The noble person uses them to issue commands and carry out affairs.”* Now, *geng* is metal. The classic states: *“On the third day, the moon emerges at *geng*,”* and so it is. Moreover, Śākyamuni relied on this gold to become a Buddha, hence the title “Golden Immortal.” This gold within Dui is born of the same body as the moon above, sharing its function to generate brightness and simultaneously produce the elixir. The moon above is called “Great Yin”; because this Dui gold shares its efficacy, it is also named “Lesser Yin,” or “gold within yin.”

The Great Yin above receives the radiance of the Great Yang to complete the seasons; the Lesser Yin of Dui transmits the Dao to perpetuate the great thousand worlds, giving birth to beings and things. The Immortal Elder, having penetrated the insights of former sages, knew the root of this gold, traced its wondrous transformations, and expounded its divine changes.

Worldly gold can endure as long as heaven and earth; when cast into fire, its color grows ever more refined, and prolonged refinement does not diminish its weight. How much more so this Dui gold, born from the great crucible of Qian and Kun’s transformations? The moon’s light waxes and wanes; Dui’s gold flows and turns, hence it is said, *“its form remains constant.”* At the new moon’s dawn, sun and moon join as jade disks; the moon receives the sun’s tally, revealing the first yang light at the *geng-shen* position—this is the Great Yin above. This Dui gold, responding to the moon’s new phase, also begins to generate the first yang elixir at the *hun-tun* position on the third day—this is the Lesser Yin of the human realm. Thus it is said: *“Gold is originally born from the moon; at the new moon’s dawn, it receives the sun’s tally.”*

What is meant by *“gold returns to its mother”*? The abode of gold is called “Dui,” and Dui’s mother is called “Kun.” Dui cannot long retain its gold; the gold, too, acts in accordance with the time. Kun’s *Wing* says: *“Containing inner power, it can be steadfast, acting in due time.”*

The sage’s heart lies wondrously herein. Once gold is activated, Dui returns to its mother and enfolds itself in Kun, just as the moon at its darkest is enveloped by the sun. Why is this? At the new moon’s dawn, the moon’s entire body “conceals its encompassing frame,” being covered by the sun; on the first, second, and third days, it moves through its degrees, and its radiance is again emitted. Likewise, when gold returns to its mother, gold’s true essence sinks into profound emptiness, serving the world’s use. From one comes two, from two comes three, and when kalpas again intersect, gold will once more be produced. When this gold is reproduced, it must restore its original nature. Why? Nature is the function of Qian; Qian’s uprightness is lodged in gold, gold is lodged in Kun, Kun is lodged in Kan, and Kan is lodged in Dui. When Dui gold unfolds its essence, it restores its original nature, thereby returning this gold to the Qian palace. Qian’s golden crucible regains its seed, and through refinement, the golden elixir is formed—thus this elixir is named “Golden Liquid Returned Elixir,” and the crucible is named “Majestic Radiance Golden Crucible,” also called *“Weiguang Ding, the Blazing Crucible.”* (*Wei* may also be written as *xi* or *xi*; all three characters convey the meaning of fire blazing intensely.) In this scripture of the golden elixir, the sun, moon, and stellar constellations, the celestial dragons and true lords of creation, all divine spirits, gather to protect and revere it with awe.

**Chapter Eleven: The Full Achievement of the Two Earths**

**Chapter Twelve: The Union of Like Essences**

The numbers of Zi and Wu combine as three,
While Wu and Ji are called the five.
When three and five harmonize,
The Eight Stones serve as the guiding principle.
Breathing in and out, they nurture one another,
And through contemplation, become husband and wife.
Yellow earth is the father of metal,
While flowing pearls are the children of water.
Water treats earth as its ghost,
And earth subdues water to prevent its rise.
The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire,
Maintaining balance to regulate victory and defeat.
When water prevails, fire is extinguished,
And both perish, returning to the fertile earth.
The three natures unite in harmony,
Their original essence sharing a common ancestry.
Sesame may prolong life,
Yet the returned elixir can be ingested.
Metal’s nature never decays,
Thus it is the treasure of all things.
When the adept refines and consumes it,
Longevity is attained for ages.
Earth wanders through the four seasons,
Guarding boundaries and establishing rules.
Golden sand enters the five viscera,
Its mist dispersing like wind and rain.
Steaming and permeating the four limbs,
The complexion becomes radiant and fair.
White hair turns black once more,
Fallen teeth regrow in their former place.
The old man regains his youthful vigor,
The aged woman becomes a maiden fair.
Transforming form to escape worldly calamity,
They are called True Persons.

---

Hu powder cast into fire,
Its color ruined, reverts to lead.
Ice and snow warmed by hot liquid,
Dissolve to become the Great Mystery.
Gold takes cinnabar as its master,
Harmonizing with mercury.
Transformation arises from its truth,
Beginning and end naturally follow.
To become an immortal through refinement,
One must use like essences:
Plant grain with grain,
Hatch chicks from eggs.
Assisting nature with its kind,
Things form with ease.
Can fish eyes be pearls?
Can thistles become sandalwood?

Those of like kind follow one another,
Deeds contrary yield no treasure.
Swallows and sparrows do not hatch phoenixes,
Foxes and hares do not nurse colts.
Water flows not upward in flame,
Fire moves not downward to moisten.
In this world are many learned scholars,
Yet fine talents often go unrecognized.
By chance they fail to meet their time,
Wasting fire and squandering wealth.
Clinging to texts and following words,
They recklessly act upon mere speech.
Without cause or connection, no thread begins,
Measurements and control are lost.
They pound and refine chalcanthite,
Mica, alum, and magnetite.
Sulfur burns the *yuzhang* wood,
Mixing mercury with mud for refinement.
They smelt the five-metal bronze below the bellows,
Using it as the pivot of their work.
Mixed natures of unlike kind,
How could they willingly unite in form?
A thousand attempts must end in ten thousand failures,
Seeking cleverness, they become fools instead.
From youth to white-haired age,
Midway they breed doubts like foxes.
Turning from the Dao to cling to delusion’s path,
Exiting the true to enter deviant trails.
Peering through a tube, their vision narrows,
How can they gauge what lies ahead?

---

The *Hu powder* is refined black lead,
Returning to its nature when fired;
Ice and snow are congealed cold water,
Reverting to their source when warmed.
Gold enters mercury and turns white,
Regaining its red hue when fired.
Worldly men, ensnared by desire, disorder their nature,
Yet preserving nature grants long life.
What is meant by *"gold takes cinnabar as its master"*?
What is meant by *"harmonizing with mercury"*?
Those who cultivate the Dao must fathom creation’s workings,
Penetrating the depths of yin and yang.
To refine the golden elixir,
First gather the cinnabar pearl of *li* and *ji*,
To harmonize with the mercury of the Jade Pool;
Then use the water of *kan* to temper the fire of *li*.
When water and fire are balanced,
Gold and cinnabar unite in form.
Transformation arises from the truth of like kind,
Beginning and end depend on the union of male and female.
Thus *"to become an immortal through refinement, one must use like essences"* is truly apt.
As planting grain requires seed,
Hatching chicks demands eggs.
To become a transcendent or Buddha without like kind,
Though one enters a hundred markets or sits in meditation for a thousand years,
It will all end in emptiness.
If one does not grasp the principle of like kind,
Pursuing side paths—
Whether bedroom arts with women,
Or the three peaks of battle—
These are all deviant tracks,
Mistaking fish eyes for pearls,
Thistles for sandalwood,
How could they know transformation arises from truth?
Swallows and sparrows are flying birds,
Yet cannot birth phoenixes;
Foxes and hares are running beasts,
How could they nurse colts?
All are not of their kind.
Water’s nature cannot flame upward,
Fire’s function cannot moisten downward,
For yin and yang’s ebb and flow must follow the Dao of nature.
The Immortal Elder teaches that to seek a true master,
One must grasp like kind,
Must pair yin and yang,
Only then can the elixir be spoken of.

I, the Purple Jade Elder, first received the chamber teachings of the Great Void True One,
Who began by asking whether the *Can Tong Qi* was for understanding the *Yi* or practicing it.
The Great Void said: *"The Yi* consists only of yin and yang.
To understand and practice them is to be a sage."*
Thus the *Yi* states: *"In the southwest, one gains companions,
And walks with those of like kind."*
The *Qi* says: *"Those of like kind follow one another,
Deeds contrary yield no treasure."*
First understand, then practice—
This is the way of the sage.
How could later men,
Though endowed with fine talents,
Not seek a true master,
But cling to ancient texts,
Presuming to measure and judge?
Some pound *shao*’s chalcanthite to refine gold;
Or burn *chen*’s cinnabar-silver to make elixirs;
Grind and smelt the five metals,
Refine the eight stones,
Taking the Three Yellows as like kind,
Pure red copper as their pivot.
These stones and metals are not of our kind,
How could they unite with our qi and dwell in our body?
Long ago, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang refined and consumed elixirs,
Lu Dongbin pitied his misguided zeal,
Transforming into a scholar to visit and save him.
Zhang, self-assured from long elixir-taking,
Believed he could ascend,
And offered no proper gifts.
Dongbin abruptly left,
Leaving behind a poem on his seat:
*"Alas, Minister Zhang of Jiujiang,
Blinded by elixirs, his spirit withered.
Not realizing the Returning Elixir has no substance,
He recklessly consumed metals and stones—how great his folly!"*
Later, he indeed lost his sight and died.
Such men, though gifted,
Clung stubbornly to error,
Willingly misled by blind masters,
Taking metals and stones as like kind,
Wasting wealth on refinement and consumption,
Some even to their dying day unenlightened.
Like them, peering through a tube at the sky,
How could they know true immortals and sagely masters exist in the world?
Worldly men, bound by habit,
Unwilling to humble themselves and seek widely,
Refusing to surpass the crowd and study broadly,
Their ears narrow, their eyes low—
How could they hear or see lofty matters?
Yet they strut about as great men,
All squandering their fine talents,
Lost in self-reliance and complacency!

**Chapter Thirteen: The Three Sages’ Foresight**

Of all sages, none surpass Fu Xi,
Who first drew the eight trigrams,
Modeling heaven and earth.
King Wen, founder of the Zhou,
Structured the hexagrams and composed their words.
Confucius, the sage among sages,
Added the Ten Wings to aid them.
These three lords were heaven’s chosen,
Rising in succession to govern their times.
Though their steps differed in excellence,
Their merits and virtues were not unequal.
Their works built upon one another,
Measured and weighed with care.
The tangible is easy to estimate,
The formless is hard to plan.
Their deeds became models for the world,
Establishing the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*.
Without innate foresight,
They awakened through their teachers.
Bright as the moon behind winter curtains,
They closed their eyes and ascended the high terrace.
The *Fire Records*’ six hundred chapters,
Their aims are not at variance.
Though the texts speak with solemnity,
The world does not ponder deeply.
Tracing the source of their currents,
Dark and light originally dwell together.
I speak humbly to the worthy—
How dare I lightly commit this to writing?
If I were to seal my tongue and fall silent,
Cutting off the Dao, I would incur punishment.
Yet to inscribe my feelings on bamboo and silk,
I fear revealing heaven’s tally.
Hesitant, I sigh,
Looking up and down, I record this folly.
Refinement has its methods,
Which cannot all be set forth.
I briefly outline its principles,
Its branches and leaves will naturally appear.

The commentary notes: *"Chapter Eight speaks of ‘advancing and retreating contrary to the Yellow and the Old’—
The two great sages, the Yellow Emperor and Laozi."*

Here the three sages’ establishment of teachings and transmission of instructions are expounded in detail, revealing their reverence for both the earlier and later sages. Looking back at later generations of shallow scholars—utterly devoid of understanding, recklessly exalting themselves, and opening their mouths only to slander—what punishment do they deserve?

The scripture states: *"Of all the utmost sages, none surpasses Fuxi."* Fuxi is also written as Paoxi or Fuxi. In the *Wings* of Confucius, it is said: *"In ancient times, when Paoxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the patterns of heaven and looked down to take models from the earth. He studied the markings of birds and beasts and the suitability of the land, drawing near to his own body and far to external things. Thereupon, he first drew the eight trigrams to communicate the virtue/power of the numinous and to categorize the conditions of the ten thousand things."*

King Wen *"structured the hexagrams and composed the line statements,"* revealing the subtlety of *"gaining friends in the southwest."* What is meant by *"the Ten Wings assisting it"*? The book of the *Yi* consists of Fuxi’s trigrams, King Wen’s line judgments, and the Duke of Zhou’s line statements, together forming two chapters called the *"Main Classic."* After the Main Classic, Confucius appended the *Wings* in ten chapters: the *Upper Commentary on the Judgments*, *Lower Commentary on the Judgments*, *Great Images*, *Lesser Images*, *Upper Commentary on the Appended Phrases*, *Lower Commentary on the Appended Phrases*, *Commentary on the Words of the Text*, *Upper Commentary on the Explanation of the Trigrams*, and *Middle and Lower Commentaries*—these are the *Ten Wings*.

Originally, in explaining the *Yi*, it was not called an *"explanation"* but a *"wing,"* for it follows the Way of assisting and supporting. The sages honored their predecessors and modeled themselves on them, letting the classic stand as the classic. The *Wings* serve as wings precisely to ensure that later scholars understand that the sages dared not precede the earlier sages nor disrupt the Main Classic.

The transmission passed from Shang Qu to Fei, Meng, Liang, and Qiu. Fei’s teaching stated: *"The judgment statements serve to explain the classic,"* and thus he divided the two wings beneath each hexagram. Fei’s version of the *Yi* spread, and the sacred classic was thrown into disorder. Fei Zhi failed to grasp the sages’ intent of neither preceding nor disrupting; had the Main Classic been subject to disruption, Confucius would have long since divided and explained it.

Fei’s tradition reached Zheng Kangcheng, who followed Fei. Zheng said: *"The *Commentary on the Words of the Text* explains the two hexagrams Qian and Kun,"* and so he moved it after the upper hexagrams of Qian and Kun. Later, Wang Bi followed Fei and Zheng. Bi said: *"The *Image Commentary* explains the lines,"* and so he moved it after each line statement, adding the words *"Image says"* and *"Judgment says."* Over several hundred years, the text was disrupted three times, disordering the Main Classic and losing the *Wing Commentaries*. Fei Zhi initiated this, and Zheng and Wang followed suit. The *Yi* of today is not the *Zhouyi* but Wang Bi’s *Yi*.

Many former worthies sought to restore the *Wings* of the *Zhouyi*. For instance, in the Song dynasty, Li Tao, Chao Yuezhi, and Ouyang Xiu all once collated and established the *Zhouyi*, considering it the ancient *Yi*. Li Tao said: *"The twelve chapters of the *Zhouyi* were first disrupted by Fei and Zheng, then greatly disordered by Wang Bi,"* and so he re-collated it, naming it the *Ancient Yi*, which was esteemed in the prefectural schools. Chao Yuezhi further revised the *Ancient Yi*, restoring the Main Classic in two chapters and the *Ten Wings* in ten chapters, though the *"Already Lost"* and *"Explanation of the Trigrams"* chapters were missing.

Ouyang Xiu said: *"When the Qin burned the books, the Main Classic of the *Yi* survived through divination, but the *Ten Wings* were scattered among the people. Emperor Wen of Han broadly sought texts, and of the *Ten Wings*, only the *Judgments*, *Images*, *Appended Phrases*, and *Words of the Text* remained. Later, during the reign of Emperor Xuan of Han, a woman from Heshang unearthed a tomb and obtained a complete *Yi*, which she presented. However, the middle and lower chapters of the *Explanation of the Trigrams* were damaged beyond recognition. Thus, two wings of the *Ten Wings* were indeed lost. Later scholars claimed that the *Sequence of Hexagrams* and *Miscellaneous Hexagrams* were part of the *Ten Wings*, but this is incorrect. Their words are superficial, and later learners merely echo one another."*

Only Master Cheng had a truly outstanding insight. In his posthumous writings, he said: *"The *Sequence of Hexagrams* does not embody the profound meaning of the *Yi*; it does not accord with the Dao."* Later, Zhang Zai, with a single stroke of his master’s axe, refuted this, but he was even further from the truth. Only Master Cheng understood that two chapters were lost.

Zhu Xi said: *"Only the Qian hexagram remains as the original text of the *Zhouyi*; Bi dared not disrupt it."* Zhu Xi also said: *"The *Zhouyi* consists of two chapters: the trigrams are Fuxi’s drawings, the line statements are King Wen’s and the Duke of Zhou’s words, and the ten commentaries are Confucius’s work—twelve chapters in all. Though later scholars have somewhat disordered them, I have now thoroughly rectified and ordered them, establishing two volumes for the classic and ten for the commentaries, restoring Confucius’s original arrangement."*

From Zhu Xi’s time to the present, two hundred years have passed, yet no one has restored the original. Why is this so? Without the *Ten Wings*, how can the Way of the *Yi* be illuminated? How can its words be communicated? How can its changes and movements be recognized? How can tools be modeled after it?

If the Dao is not communicated through words, one cannot grasp the resonance of human nature. If the Dao does not recognize change and movement, one cannot attain the transformations of metal and water. If the Dao does not excel in crafting tools, one cannot employ the crucible and furnace. If the Dao does not comprehend good and ill fortune, one cannot grasp the principles of reversal and compliance.

The *Wings* state: *"The *Yi* contains the four Ways of the sage—this is it."* Thus, when a noble person is about to act or undertake something, they inquire of it and speak accordingly. Their reception of the mandate is like an echo—whether far or near, dark or deep, they thereby know what is to come. *"Dark and deep"* refers to the realm of the indistinct and obscure. When the noble person acts or undertakes something, they must do so within the indistinct and obscure, and thereby know what is to come.

Only the most refined essence under heaven could partake in this—so declared the Immortal Elder, who held that the *Ten Wings* serve as its aid; these words exhaust the matter.

The sagely effort benefits later generations equally, yet later learners may lack the great fortune and virtue, the great wisdom, to bear its weight. A thousand obstructions arise, leaving no path to perceive or hear it. The Three Sages arose in succession, their creations and calculations becoming the model for ten thousand generations.

We revere the supreme Dao, which endows heaven with sagely wisdom—how could self-realization occur without a teacher’s transmission? Even those endowed with intelligence, who deliberate and ponder, find themselves obstructed as if by a barrier. Yet if a benevolent and worthy one applies their mind to thorough inquiry, suddenly grasping the teacher’s intent, their heart-mind becomes vast and clear—like a chamber from which the curtains have been drawn, revealing all with luminous clarity. It is as if, with eyes closed, one ascends a high terrace—what would remain unseen?

If one does not seek a teacher, how could self-awakening arise? Should one find a teacher, they must first examine the *Triple Concordance Canon*. If every line is understood, every chapter penetrated, then this is the true path. But if even a single phrase remains vague or obscure, trust in it falters. To claim that another way exists beyond this text by which the Dao may be attained is to deceive others grossly.

For what reason is this text so revered? It is because King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius all took Fuxi as their ancestral teacher. Thus the Immortal Elder said: "The Master approaches sagehood and heroism." Even ten thousand generations hence, who could surpass Confucius? Moreover, the *Yellow Emperor’s Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman* and Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* align perfectly without discrepancy—only through understanding this Dao. Therefore, the Ancient Ancestor, the Heavenly Master, and the immortals Ge, Xu, and Fuqiu all entered the Dao through this text. Likewise, works such as *Purifying Realization* by Ziyang and *The Golden Elixir’s Difficult Questions* by Yuanduzi all trace their origins to the *Triple Concordance*. Comparing it with Buddhist scriptures and Daoist classics, all harmonize with this text.

If someone claims, "My teacher is so-and-so, who in turn studied under so-and-so," their teachings flow like a river. Yet when asked about the *Triple Concordance*, they are largely ignorant. These are seeds of hell, who falsely assert that the supreme Dao is not found in written texts, blindly leading others astray with reckless guidance. Who among them knows that this text, when examined and verified, is truly reliable—only then can one begin practice? Moreover, the *Six Hundred Fire Records* detail the timing, hexagrams, and talismans, with esoteric words and profound phrases expounded solemnly from beginning to end. If one does not deeply contemplate and seek its source and flow, how can they align with the shared dwelling of the hidden and the manifest? This text is spoken for the worthy—how could it be lightly expounded? If one remains silent, how could the Dao be transmitted? Yet if fully revealed in writing, it would leak the celestial tally.

As for "hesitating with sighs," *youyu* is the name of a beast. This creature is inherently suspicious; dwelling in the mountains, it hears a sound and hesitates, climbing up and down trees repeatedly. Thus, those who cannot decide for themselves are called *youyu*. The Immortal Elder described his own hesitation—like fording a river while fearing one’s neighbor—sighing repeatedly, weighing matters again and again before composing this text. Yet in refining later generations, there are methods of concealment and revelation, and the oral instructions cannot be fully disclosed. Here, only the essential framework is outlined, with a glimpse of its branches.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Knife and Spoon of the Golden Elixir**
Use gold as a dike,
Let the water enter and flow leisurely.
Gold is counted as fifteen,
The water’s number is likewise.
Before the furnace, determine the weights precisely—
Five parts of water are excessive.
These two are taken as true:
The gold’s weight remains as at the beginning.
If the third part does not enter,
Fire and the second part accompany it.
The three substances mutually embrace,
Their transformations wondrous as spirits.
Beneath lies the qi of Grand Yang,
Steaming and seething in an instant.
First it liquefies, then congeals,
Called the Yellow Chariot.
When years and months near their end,
It destroys one’s nature and harms one’s lifespan.
The body becomes like ash and dust,
Its form like dust on a bright window.
Pound, refine, and combine them,
Then enter the Crimson Gate.
Securely seal their juncture,
Ensuring utmost completeness and firmness.
Ignite the blazing fire below,
Day and night, its sound ever diligent.
Begin with the civil, proceed to refinement,
End with the martial, then arrange it.
Observe and attend with utmost care,
Scrutinizing the regulation of cold and warmth.
Cycle through the twelve nodes,
And when each node concludes, attend again closely.
When qi is exhausted and life nears its end,
The body dies, and the hun and po disperse.
The color shifts to purple,
Brilliantly forming the Returned Elixir.
Ground into a single pellet,
The knife and spoon are most divine.

The commentary states: Here, the Immortal Elder unfolds his exposition, finally speaking of entering the chamber, approaching the furnace, and beginning the elixir’s formation within the crucible. Those of superior capacity, upon understanding this text, will find it most orderly and not at all vague. This chapter of the *Triple Concordance* is of great significance. Without the detailed explanation of this chapter, how could later practitioners begin the work of elixir refinement? Those who have not encountered the teacher’s intent remain unaware of this text’s profound obscurity. Reading this chapter, they find it as tasteless as chewing wax, with no entry point. They can only guess it refers to the forging of the Five Metals and Eight Stones, achieving nothing in the end, and instead resent the sage-teacher’s deceptive words—truly pitiable. Here, a slight revelation is given, though later doubts remain unresolved.

"Use gold as a dike" refers to the great cultivator who, in refining the Nine-Return Golden Elixir, must recognize that this gold is the gold of the West, the *dui* trigram. First, discern the true heart, seek that *dui* gold, establish an altar, and constantly guard it with care. Fortify the dike to await the generation of this gold’s water. The water thus generated must also be carefully measured and discerned. One must know: is this water primordial or postnatal? If postnatal, the water is turbid and cannot be used to refine the Returned Elixir. If it is primordial water, one must wait until it is clear before using it.

A poem says:
The Jing is clear, the Wei is turbid—
For the Jing River is clear while the Wei River is muddy.
The elixir-refiner awaits the clarity of the Jing’s waters,
Flowing leisurely with vigilant care, undisturbed—
This is what is meant by "let the water enter and flow leisurely."
Within this clarity of water lies true gold.
Zhou Xingsi said: "Gold is born in the Li River,"
The utmost of clarity.
Moreover, one must know its weight and measure before use.
This *dui* gold must be precisely fifteen taels,
Approximating the standard of one catty—
This is what is meant by "gold is counted as fifteen."
When gold reaches fifteen taels in weight,
It can generate the Li River’s waters.
What is meant by "the water’s number is likewise"?
It does not mean the water is also fifteen taels,
But that the water must correspond to the gold.
For fifteen taels of gold,
There is a certain amount of water it can generate—
Thus it is said "likewise."
Therefore, the Immortal Elder repeatedly emphasizes:
Before the furnace, determine its weights precisely.
If fifteen taels of gold have generated five parts of water,
The water is excessive and unusable—
This is what is meant by "five parts of water are excessive."
If this gold initially generates two parts of water,
Then it is truly usable—
This is what is meant by "these two are taken as true."
With these two parts of water,
There must be fifteen taels of gold—
This is what is meant by "the gold’s weight remains as at the beginning."
If the water reaches three parts,
It is also unusable—
This is what is meant by "the third part does not enter."

If the quantities of gold and water are timely and equal, swiftly apply the fire of two parts to unite them. This is what is meant by, *"The fire of two accompanies them."*

Once gold, water, and fire have merged, the fire receives the gold’s *qi*, and is further restrained by the water, coalescing into the Reverted Elixir. Thus transformed, its state becomes divine.

No step in the furnace-work is more crucial than this. Therefore, the sage selects the month from the year to place the gold, measures the day within the month to heed the tide, chooses the hour within the day to align with the hexagram, and fixes the fire within the hour to enact the talisman.

What is meant by "enacting the talisman"? The ancient sages and worthies regarded the refinement of the Golden Elixir as a matter of utmost importance. They calculated the seasons and established the method of *cuan cu* (gathering and clustering), condensing the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year into a single day, the three hundred sixty hexagrams of a year into a single month, and the thirty-six talismans into one day and night, distributing them across the twelve hours.

Each hour contains six nodes—yet in the quest for the Elixir, only the fire of two nodes is employed (one for prolonged duration). Each hour holds one hexagram—yet in the quest for the Elixir, not even half a hexagram’s moment is needed. Each hour comprises three talismans—yet in the quest for the Elixir, only the swiftness of one talisman is used. This is what is meant by *single talisman, single decision*. Thus did the Yellow Emperor speak of the *Yin Fu Jing*. Hence it is said: *"People know the divine as divine, yet do not know the non-divine that makes the divine divine."* This is the principle.

At the moment of this single talisman, the immortal adept of the Elixir compresses the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial *qi*, drawing them in reverse into the womb. In this instant, they seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth, steal the essence of the sun and moon, hold the Earth’s axis in their heart and the Heaven’s gate in their hands. They blend the *qi* of the dragon and tiger’s two strings, pound the true essence of gold and water into one, coil the tortoise and snake within the Elixir furnace, and unite the crow and hare upon the Yellow Path. Black and white intermingle, hardness and softness alternate in rise, the jade crucible (or "door") stores auspiciousness, and purple radiance reflects the sun. Mars guards the western pole, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void. They hasten the water to move the gold, urge the fire into the tripod, subdue and steam with the *qi* of the Great Yang, and coagulate the Elixir named the Yellow Chariot.

When first refining gold and water, one must guard against reckoning in years and months. Yet at the moment of uniting the Elixir, only the work of a single talisman is required. Prolonged effort damages one’s nature and harms the Elixir; a single misstep shortens one’s lifespan. This is what is meant by, *"As the years and months draw to a close, nature is damaged and lifespan harmed."*

The practice of refining the Elixir is fundamentally for prolonging life and ascending to immortality. Yet if one errs by a hair’s breadth, it instead shortens life. Thus the Immortal Elder admonishes later learners: the utmost care must be taken, for the dust on a bright window is like the subtlety of the Elixir.

*"Pounding and refining"* refers to the intermingling and tempering of yin and yang. *"Holding and entering"* means preserving and gathering it in. The *"Crimson Gate"* is the portal of *qian* (Heaven); the Elixir returns through *qian*’s gate to the chamber of spirit. *"Sealing firmly"* means closing the breath. *"Meeting at the juncture"* refers to the nine orifices. All must be secure and complete, without any loss.

*"Flames blaze below, day and night the sound is diligent"*—for when the Yang Elixir first arrives, it bears a sign. Suddenly receiving the fire within *li* (Fire), it circulates day and night throughout the body. Every joint and myriad spirits obey its command. One must diligently guard within, ensuring the sound is still and the intent harmonious, the *qi* even and the pulse stilled, so the Elixir may begin to congeal.

*"At first, refine with civil fire"*—at the beginning of Elixir refinement, use civil fire. Yet from start to finish, martial fire is employed: first to refine the self, and finally to warm and nurture. Thus the *Tripod Song* says: *"Martial at start and end, civil in the middle."*

*"Observe and act with utmost care"*—one must not grow careless. The *Mud Pill Palace* states: *"Without sufficient effort, the work will not be perfected."*

*"Examine and adjust cold and warmth"*—do not be deceived by external things. Master Purple Yang said: *"Adjust the fire’s timing by entrusting it to yin and yang."*

Circling through the twelve joints, beginning anew after completion, one continues until the mercury is added and the lead withdrawn. When the lead is nearly exhausted and the mercury also dries, the seven *po* are dead and the *hun* transformed—this is *"the qi is spent, life nears its end, the body dies, and the hun and po depart."*

At this stage, the Elixir’s color shifts to the crimson-gold radiance of the Reverted Elixir.

*"Powdered to a single grain, the knife’s tip is most divine"*—as fine as a pinch of powder, as small as a single pill. A grain of millet is called a *"pill,"* and its lightness is like the tip of a knife’s blade, speaking to its subtlety. Yet its divine marvels are beyond description.

This chapter exhaustively describes the work of beginning the practice. Yet its profound and abstruse principles must be transmitted orally by a master—who could accomplish this by relying solely on the text?

Master Zhu Xi of the former worthies, desiring to hear the supreme Dao but lacking a teacher’s transmission, was deeply fond of this book. In his declining years, in a letter to Minister Yuan, he wrote: *"The *Cantong Qi* was not originally written to elucidate the *Book of Changes*. Rather, it merely borrowed the method of *na jia* (hexagram arrangement) to embed its practices of advancement and retreat."*

Master Zhu was so broadly learned, yet without a teacher’s guidance, he could only conceive of it as the method of *na jia*. How would he know this book truly aims to elucidate the Dao of the *Zhou Changes*? Hence its title: *The Kinship of the Three in Accord with the Zhou Changes*. Moreover, the practices of advancement and retreat in the Dao of the Elixir do not employ the *na jia* method at all.

Elsewhere, he wrote: *"Recently, while traveling, I carried no other books and thus became thoroughly familiar with the *Cantong Qi*, roughly grasping its literary meaning. Though I had read it many times before, I always set it aside as tasteless. Only now have I begun to discern its thread. Yet I still lack its ingredients, holes, and cavities—the profound words and secret principles are beyond imagination."*

Master Zhu repeatedly cast it aside as tasteless, while blind teachers insist on guessing.

Moreover, he stated: *"In the past, whenever I wished to study it, I could find no transmission, no place to begin."* If even sages and worthies, whose wisdom equals that of Confucius and Mencius, require a teacher, how could they have grasped it on their own? Yet today’s people, self-satisfied and complacent, recklessly guess and act—compared to the former worthies, their transgressions are many indeed. Had I, Xi, received a teacher’s guidance, I would have fully illuminated the sages’ Way of the *Changes* and surely not clung to it as a mere book of divination.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Nature of Water and Fire**
Expounding the numbers of the Five Phases,
Concise yet not convoluted.
Water is raised to provoke fire,
Suddenly extinguishing its radiance.
Sun and moon mutually eclipse,
Ever at the new and full moons.
When water waxes, *kan* encroaches on yang;
When fire wanes, *li* dims the day.
Yin and yang consume each other,
Their interaction the natural Dao.
Names define their essence,
Characters speak of their nature.
When metal returns to the origin of nature,
Only then is it called the Reverted Elixir.
I dare not speak idly,
But emulate the sages’ writings.
Ancient records title it *Dragon and Tiger*;
The Yellow Emperor praised *Golden Flower*.
Huainan refined *Autumn Stone*,
Yuyang added *Yellow Sprout*.
The worthy can uphold and practice it;
The unworthy must not partake.
The Dao of past and present is one,
Spoken in dialogue, disclosed in counsel.
Scholars, exert yourselves,
Reflect deeply and ponder.
The essential words are utterly plain,
Luminous and never deceiving.

The annotation states: *"The numbers of the Five Phases"* refer to metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, extended into the numbers three, five, and one. In the refinement of the Golden Elixir, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth serve as the Five Phases, paired and harmonized with yin and yang. Thus, *"water extinguishes fire"* means yin dissolves yang. *"Sun and moon mutually eclipse"* necessarily at the new and full moons, where yin and yang wax and wane, encroaching upon each other. If yin and yang harmonize, mutually consuming, then the natural Dao of interaction arises. Metal and water share the name *"essence"*; wood and fire share the character *"nature."* Essence resides in the northwest, nature governs the southeast; the southeast is called *"self,"* the northwest *"other."* The essence of metal and water naturally comes from without, overcoming wood and fire, while the nature of wood and fire inwardly returns to congeal the Golden Elixir. This is what is meant by *"When metal returns to the origin of nature, only then is it called the Reverted Elixir"*—these two lines are the marrow of the *Cantong Qi*.

*"I dare not speak idly, but emulate the sages’ writings"*—the Immortal Elder grasped the sages’ true intent and, having obtained the ancient text *Dragon and Tiger Classic*, refined the Elixir according to its method. Upon its completion, he composed this book to instruct later generations. He recounted the Yellow Emperor’s Elixir, named *"Golden Flower,"* Huainan’s Elixir, named *"Autumn Stone,"* and Yuyang’s Elixir, named *"Yellow Sprout."* Each Elixir, upon ascension, bore a distinct name, yet all were this Reverted Elixir, all were the primordial qi, all were of the same kind. Later people, hearing *"Golden Flower,"* guessed it to be the five metals; hearing *"Yellow Sprout,"* guessed it to be the eight minerals; hearing *"Autumn Stone,"* guessed it to be urine sediment. How could they know that the ancient sages and worthies, in their expedient naming, refined an Elixir that transcends yin and yang, following no other path? This Dao can only be diligently practiced by sages. From antiquity to the present, it has been one and the same. The great sages of the Three Teachings must be of the same kind to apply their efforts, hence: *"The Dao of past and present is one, spoken in dialogue, disclosed in counsel."* Apart from this single path, there is no other method. Those who come after, exert yourselves and reflect deeply; seek a teacher’s guidance, and you will know that this book’s clarity leaves nothing concealed, never deceiving us.

Master Shangyang said: *"The three chapters of the *Cantong Qi* are unadulterated in substance and function, their efficacy extraordinary. 'To *participate*' is to partake in the creative workings of heaven and earth; 'to *unite*' is to rely on the generative function of like kind; 'to *accord*' is to harmonize with the creative and generative power of the cosmos. The first chapter recounts the origin and completion of Elixir refinement; the middle chapter enumerates its subtle and profound principles; the final chapter supplements omissions and restores symbolic correspondences."* The first chapter aligns in meaning with the *Dragon and Tiger Upper Classic*, and the world suspects that the *Dragon and Tiger Classic* must have been derived from the first chapter of the *Cantong Qi*, which was originally intended as a classic. It must have had upper, middle, and lower chapters. Without the middle and lower chapters, how could it be called the *Upper Classic*? The sages’ intent—how could the common people fathom it? The *Upper Classic* embodies the meaning of the *First Classic*, a profundity beyond mortal reckoning. Moreover, the book contains the line *"ancient records title it Dragon and Tiger,"* which clarifies that the ancient text is beyond doubt—hence the reference to *"ancient script in gold and jade."*

Master Peng Xiao’s preface states: *"The Immortal Elder’s teacher remains unknown, but he obtained the ancient *Dragon and Tiger Classic*, fully grasping its profound principles. He then condensed the *Zhou Changes* to compose the three chapters of the *Cantong Qi*."* It further states: *"Not all subtleties were exhausted, so he wrote an additional chapter to fill gaps and supplement omissions, further expounding the mysteries of the Elixir Classic."* The Immortal Elder first received the teachings of the Realized One Yin Changsheng, then later studied under Attendant Xu, thereby fully comprehending the profound subtleties. The immortal traditions record this in detail.

Master Zhenyi also said: *"Upon completion, the book was secretly transmitted to Attendant Xu of Qingzhou, who concealed his name and annotated it."* Thus, the lineage is genuine—what dispute could there be? The commentaries on this book number over a hundred, but only those by Peng Xiao and Wang Dao are superior. Peng Xiao, having received transmission, observed the *Bright Mirror Diagram*, and his preface to the *Cantong Qi* is already detailed. Yet his commentary on the book remains fragmented and disordered, giving rise to the saying: *"Rivulets diverge, beauty and ugliness arise together."* Wang Dao’s explanations are even more desolate and barren.

Now, examining the *Dragon and Tiger Classic*—though its language is archaic and lofty, it does not match the *Cantong Qi* in clarity and decisiveness. Its words are abstruse and recondite; without a sage-teacher’s precise instruction on where to begin, who would dare conjecture? After the lines *"When metal returns to the origin of nature, only then is it called the Reverted Elixir,"* it immediately follows with *"I dare not speak idly, but emulate the sages’ writings."* From this, we know that the ancient sages and great worthies, without a teacher, would never have dared to speak idly! Without a teacher, how could this book have been composed? Without a teacher, how could they have aligned with the workings of creation? The one who left this book for the world possessed the sagely mind and the Dao-eye, a ladder to heaven and a raft across the river—those who cultivate the Dao depend upon it.

Were this book not in the world, all would rush into heterodox paths and deviant byways, allowing blind masters and vulgar charlatans to fabricate absurdities, dragging one another into hell. Without this book, the realm between heaven and earth would lack the essence of cultivation and the Dao of the sages. How then could one aspire to guide the world’s ceaseless striving? Ponder deeply and reflect—only the immortal patriarchs possess such heavenly insight.

In general, to annotate a text is to elucidate it. When a book’s meaning is recondite and obscure, explication serves to enlighten later generations. Thus, one must grasp the book’s fundamental intent, surpass the mental plane of predecessors, and achieve luminous clarity—only then may one’s annotations surpass the original work. Otherwise, ambiguities here and obscurities there will mislead posterity. Those of narrow wisdom and limited vision may assume later scholars cannot rival the ancients. Yet if a sage or wise one arises to rectify and salvage the truth, their efforts may be muddled by confusion, unable to distinguish purity from corruption or restore the proper path.

Other scriptures may tolerate such flaws, but this book—before which Boyang knelt in homage to the two Perfected Ones, Yin and Xu—embodies the orthodoxy of the supreme Dao. Its lofty diction and profound mysteries are rendered with meticulous precision; how much more so the subtleties of the Golden Elixir’s method, the crucible’s chamber and its function? Boyang encapsulated all with the single phrase: *"When metal returns to the origin of nature."* The Song Confucians, failing to comprehend, refused to acknowledge the *Zhouyi* as a work of the Dao, dismissing it as a mere divination manual. Thus, they obscured the sacred intent of Fuxi, King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, and distorted the creative and transformative principles of Qian and Kun. They wrongly constrained Boyang’s profound and primal words.

If we do not now reveal some of its key apertures, the hearts of the Four Sages will remain unvindicated for ten thousand generations, and the Way of the *Great Change* will remain forever obscure.

How could one not know that the most essential words are utterly manifest, their earnestness expressed in the phrase: *"Luminous and clear—they do not deceive me"*?

**Chapter Sixteen: The Essence and Qi of Yin and Yang**

Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness,
paired and interwoven.
Yang bestows, Yin receives—
male and female each in need of the other.
Through their union, creation unfolds,
and essence and qi expand.
Kan and Li crown the head,
their radiance streaming forth.
Mysterious and unfathomable,
beyond all depiction.

The sage measures and orders,
aligning the primal foundations.
These four—chaotic and indistinct—
plunge directly into emptiness.
The sixty hexagrams cycle,
spread wide as a chariot’s canopy.
Dragon and horse are harnessed,
the enlightened ruler steers the times.
Harmony follows in accord,
the path smooth, without deviation.
Deviant ways are perilous and obstructed,
toppling nations into ruin.

**Annotation:** The preceding fourteen chapters have already clarified the stages of elixir refinement from beginning to end. This section revisits the subtleties, chapter by chapter, outlining the combined application of the Nine-Return Great Elixir. Later scholars must delve deeply to attain thorough understanding; they cannot waver or compromise, for even the slightest error will prevent the elixir’s formation. Master Shangyang divided this middle section into fifteen chapters, enumerating fifteen matters. This chapter alone elucidates the four aspects of yin, yang, essence, and qi.

What are Qian’s firmness and Kun’s softness? Confucius’s *Wings* states: *"Qian is the yang thing; Kun is the yin thing. Yin and yang unite their powers, and firmness and softness take form, embodying the mechanism of Heaven and Earth, penetrating the virtue of the numinous."* Thus, Qian’s power is firm, strong, centered, and upright—pure and unadulterated essence. Kun’s power is yielding, compliant, beneficial, and steadfast. The noble person’s conduct follows this; the union of Qian and Kun is the Dao of the Golden Elixir. Only the noble person can act accordingly; the petty person does otherwise.

Formerly, Confucius said: *"I have never seen a truly firm person."* Someone replied: *"Shen Cheng is firm."* The Master said: *"Cheng is full of desire—how can he be firm?"* The meaning of firmness is vast indeed! Petty persons may force themselves to be firm and strong for a time, but how can they remain centered and upright? Without centering and uprightness, how can their essence be pure? Firmness is the nature of Qian—active and direct, thus easy to know. Softness is the nature of Kun—active and yielding, thus easy to follow. What is easy to know engenders intimacy; what is easy to follow brings achievement. Intimacy leads to accomplishment, allowing greatness and endurance—this is the virtue and work of sages and worthies.

To establish oneself between firmness and softness—is this not the Dao of the Golden Elixir? Thus, Qian’s yang power governs bestowal, while Kun’s yin power specializes in containment. *"Male and female each in need of the other"* relies on essence and qi; the expansion of essence and qi requires male and female. The *Wings* says: *"Essence and qi become things; wandering spirits become transformations."* *"Becoming things"* refers to the generative process—giving rise to humans and all beings. *"Becoming transformations"* refers to the reversal of this process—attaining Buddhahood or immortality.

What is meant by *"Kan and Li crown the head"*? When Qian’s firmness interacts with Kun, Qian’s center becomes hollow, forming Li. When Kun’s softness receives Qian, Kun’s interior becomes solid, forming Kan. Thus, Kan and Li succeed Qian and Kun, crowning the head of yin and yang while attaining the correctness of firmness and softness. The sun’s light within Li and the moon’s brilliance within Kan shine downward, their profound mystery too obscure to fathom or depict.

Only the sage can measure and order, assisting in the arrangement of their primal foundations. This meaning aligns with the earlier phrase: *"The primal essence is too subtle to perceive; one can only infer and verify its signs."* What is meant by *"these four chaotic and indistinct"*? The four—yin, yang, essence, and qi—are enveloped within the aperture of emptiness, proceeding through the sixty hexagrams, spread wide as a chari

Thus, when the ninefold lifespan departed and Guozhong advanced, the An-Shi rebellion began to sprout; when Qin Hui rose and Yue Fei perished, the Yan-Yun lands were never reclaimed. Those of upright strength who serve the state fear only that state power may not rest with the ruler; petty men who serve only themselves fear only that state authority may not belong to them. The noble and the base exist in every age. The noble should harmonize with and tolerate the base, while the base ought to follow and submit to the noble—thus the state will know no peril, and all under heaven will be well-governed.

In cultivation and refinement, harmony comes first. When harmony prevails, all affairs follow the heart’s intent and respond accordingly. The *Wings* states: *"The auspiciousness of harmonious Dui means action encounters no doubt."* Once affairs are harmonized (or once the self is aligned), one must rectify the heart, sincerify the intent, and guard against wayward thoughts—then no obstacles will arise, nor will the elixir be lost. Even the slightest deviation demands the utmost caution.

The latter twenty-eight chapters re-emphasize these four principles in greater detail.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Noble One Dwelling in His Chamber**

When the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away. This refers to the ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding within the ninefold palace, issuing decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang. Concealing his vessel, he awaits the proper time, never transgressing the hexagram’s month. *Zhun* employs the *zi* and *shen* [hours], *Meng* employs the *yin* and *xu* [hours]. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their own appointed days. Here, two images are briefly presented, though their full intricacies remain unexplored.

Establishing righteousness and instituting punishments serve to prevent deceit; enacting benevolence and bestowing virtue serve to cultivate goodwill. Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who comply attain fortune. Adhering to the calendar and decrees, one must act with utmost sincerity and focused precision. Diligently observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing the waxing and waning of yin and yang. Even the slightest irregularity invites regret and harm.

At the solstices, the celestial degrees shift; errors and distortions arise. Midwinter brings scorching heat, midsummer yields frost and snow. At the equinoxes, the cardinal directions misalign, failing to correspond even by a moment’s measure. Drought and flood contend, wind and rain fall out of season; locusts surge like boiling water, and manifold anomalies emerge. Heaven displays its omens—mountains collapse, the earth splits. The filial son’s devotion moves the imperial pole.

Words uttered near at hand flow afar to distant lands. They may summon disaster or bring fortune, usher in great peace or incite warfare. These four outcomes arise from the heart’s depths. Movement and stillness follow constant principles, adhering to their guiding lines. The four seasons proceed in due order, harmonizing with the *qi*. Firmness and softness are decisively distinguished, never encroaching upon one another. The Five Phases guard their boundaries, neither recklessly expanding nor contracting. The *Yi* circulates in ceaseless flow, bending and stretching, reversing and returning.

The commentary notes: This chapter marks the initial entry into the chamber, where vigilance and meticulous care are paramount—the difficulty of elixir refinement is precisely thus. The sage employs the analogy of the noble one, hence the *Wings*’ *"Appended Judgments"* states: *"When the noble one dwells in his chamber and utters good words, they resonate even a thousand *li* away. How much more so for those near at hand!"* It further says: *"Words and deeds are the noble one’s pivot and trigger; their release determines honor or disgrace. Words and deeds are how the noble one moves heaven and earth."* And again: *"Deliberate before speaking, consult before acting—deliberation and consultation bring about their transformations."*

Master Shangyang said: *"The Dao is fundamentally wordless; without words, how could the Dao be revealed?"* By *"wordless,"* he refers to those of virtue, whose words cannot be spoken carelessly. How much more so for those who practice the Dao and refine the elixir! Laozi said: *"Those who know do not speak; those who speak do not know."* Thus, those who flaunt their *qian*-wisdom without true understanding—when they expound and debate, they seek only to be known. A true master can discern their deceit and falsehood; the shallow and unworthy must not lightly discuss such matters.

Master Ziyang said: *"Even if a cauldron and axe stood before me, or a blade pressed against my neck, I would not dare speak."* Such is the vessel of one who truly practices the Dao—how could they not speak? Yet when entering the chamber to gather the medicine, one must avoid careless words. If one truly refrains from speaking, how can the medicine’s authenticity be discerned?

The *Niwan* states: *"If words fail to connect with one’s kin, the work will not achieve its proper form."* The immortal elder thus cites the words of sages and immortals, expanding upon them: *"The ruler of ten thousand chariots, abiding within the ninefold palace, issues decrees and commands in accord with the rhythms of yin and yang."* This means that seeking the elixir must follow the rhythms of yin and yang, precisely at the moment when solitary yang returns.

*"Concealing the vessel and awaiting the time, never transgressing the hexagram’s month"* refers to gathering the medicine only when the moon appears in *Zhen*, at the hour when the third day’s *geng* emerges. *"Zhun* employs *zi* and *shen"* denotes the locus where water is born and flourishes; *"Meng* employs *yin* and *xu"* denotes the position where fire is generated and stored. Each of the sixty hexagrams has its appointed day. Here, two hexagrams—*Zhun* and *Meng*—are briefly presented. *"Their full intricacies remain unexplored"* is the immortal elder’s humble admission of incomplete mastery, for the profound mysteries must be transmitted orally. Thus, the scripture says: *"These are not the common words of the world."* Only the perfected sages, who have attained immortality and penetrated the subtlest mysteries, can fully grasp their meaning. For those without the endowment of a perfected sage, how could they practice this Dao and become immortals?

*"Establishing righteousness and instituting punishments"* serves to prevent deceit; *"enacting benevolence and bestowing virtue"* serves to win hearts. *"Those who defy them meet misfortune; those who comply attain fortune"*—this means adhering to the law, clarifying decrees, acting with utmost sincerity, and proceeding with focused precision. *"Diligently observing the celestial stems and branches"* means that in a year, only one month is suitable; in a month, only one day; in a day, only one hour; in an hour, only one talisman is employed. *"Scrutinizing the waxing and waning"* requires discerning the water born of *dui*-metal, distinguishing its clarity and turbidity, and measuring its proportions. Even the slightest error—*"the tiniest irregularity"*—will invite blame and harm, sabotaging the elixir crucible.

Such distortions cause yin and yang to deviate; at the solstices, the celestial degrees shift. Midwinter becomes scorching heat, midsummer yields bitter frost. The equinoxes’ directions misalign, failing to correspond even by a moment’s measure. Drought and flood contend, wind and rain fall out of season; locusts surge like boiling water, and manifold anomalies emerge. Heaven displays its omens—mountains collapse, the earth splits. The filial son’s devotion moves the imperial pole.

At the spring and autumn equinoxes, the cardinal directions misalign; the clepsydra’s marks no longer correspond. Rain and sunshine falter, anomalies multiply—such portents of blame all illustrate how a single error at the crucible spawns a hundred faults, all stemming from the failure to refine the self. The foolish blame the alchemical scriptures instead of themselves. Yet if one’s root is deep and the square inch of the heart true, remorse and regret only steel the resolve. With unwavering diligence and a single thought piercing heaven, divine aid arrives, and success at the crucial moment is assured. Just as the filial son’s sincerity moves the imperial pole, so too does the heart house the spirit; when the heart is steadfast, the numinous naturally comes.

Speech is the voice of the heart; when words are trustworthy, nature and emotion resonate. Though words emerge from one’s own mouth, their sound carries far. Failure invites calamity, success brings blessing. When affairs go awry, strife may arise; when they prosper, one enjoys great peace. These four outcomes—success, failure, discord, and harmony—all arise from the human heart. In movement and stillness, one must adhere to the inked line. Then the four seasons respond to the qi’s summons, hardness and softness harmonize, the Five Phases align, and the Dao of the *Great Change* flows and cycles without obstruction.

The above analogies urge those cultivating the elixir to concentrate their minds, contemplate peril, and guard against it. For this elixir’s Way depends not only on oneself but also on heaven. If heaven resists, one must move it with treasures and sincerity, never opposing the heavenly Dao. By aligning with the heavenly Dao, the golden elixir is achieved. Thus, those of like mind first wail and later laugh.

The *Wings* states: “The noble one’s Way may emerge or withdraw, may speak or remain silent. When two hearts are as one, their sharpness cuts metal. Words of shared heart bear the fragrance of orchids.” The hexagram *Fellowship* represents those of one heart. Its line structure—one yin and five yang—shows that when yin is many and yang few, yang governs; when yang is many and yin few, yin governs. Thus, *Fellowship* unites a solitary yin with venerable yang. To win the heart of a fellow, one must sever with advantage, only then will their words align. Therefore, the noble one’s caution and tact lie in not speaking recklessly but using words as a bridge. The difficulty of the elixir’s Way—can one not revere and heed it?

**Chapter Eighteen: Conjoining the Talisman at Dark and New Moon**

Between dark and new moon, the talisman is conjoined and the center traversed. Primal chaos and vast obscurity—yin and yang follow one another. Nourishing fluids moisten and enrich, transformation flows unimpeded. Heaven and earth’s spirits defy measure; their use secures the body, concealing and storing form.

It begins in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*. Turning rightward, the wheel spews forth sprouts. In the hidden depths, images appear, scattering radiant essence. Above *Mao* and *Bi*, *Zhen* sets forth on its campaign. Yang qi initiates; the first yang, the hidden dragon. Yang stands with three, yin flows with eight. On the third day, *Zhen* stirs; on the eighth, *Dui* moves. The second yang, the visible dragon, brings peace and clarity. When the virtues of three and five are complete, the *Qian* body is formed. The third yang, vigilant at dusk, chips away at the spirit-talisman. Flourishing and decline gradually transform, ultimately returning to the origin. *Xun* inherits the lineage, firmly grasping the boundary. The fourth yang may leap, advancing and retreating on a perilous path. *Gen* governs progress and pause, not overstepping its time. On the twenty-third day, one guards the crescent’s appointed hour. The fifth yang, the flying dragon, ascends to heaven’s position with joy. The sixth yin, *Kun* in submission, binds beginning and end. It nurtures the many offspring, becoming the mother of all kinds. The ninth yang, the exalted dragon, battles virtue in the wilds. With *yongjiu*, it flutters, becoming the Dao’s compass. The yang numbers conclude, then begin anew. Pushing sentiment to align with nature, they turn and unite. The jade armillary revolves, ascending and descending. The six lines circulate, difficult to perceive. Thus, there is no fixed position, for it is the ancestor of the *Changes*.

The commentary states: This chapter models the dark, new, crescent, and full moons to compare the elixir’s traversal of lines and conjoining of talismans. In a year’s twelve degrees, the dark, new, crescent, and full moons—heaven’s greater yin has twelve degrees, conjoining with the greater yang; the human realm’s lesser yin has twelve degrees, hiddenly following the scripture. This is the norm of yin and yang. Only the lesser yin, murky and obscure, “defies measure.” The sage gauges it, roaming the Supreme Ultimate, only then matching the talisman to traverse the center, hence called “prior heaven.”

Heaven’s greater yin meets the greater yang at each conjunction; sun and moon conjoin talismans. The moon lies below the sun, the sun above the moon. The moon receives the sun’s radiant essence, its light directed heavenward, unseen by humans. Just as in the union of man and woman—man above, woman below—the woman is covered by the man and unseen. At this dark and new moon, the moon lies below the sun, its brilliance undivided, like the human realm’s lesser yin.

In the Supreme Ultimate’s chaos, within the prior heaven’s vast obscurity, when the talisman’s term concludes, on the third day at *geng*, a faint yang is about to arise. Yang’s male and yin’s female follow and unite; within them, “nourishing fluids moisten and enrich,” naturally “transformation flows unimpeded.” “Heaven and earth’s spirits defy measure.”

The great Dao cannot be enacted without the resources of sages and worthies. The *Wings* states: “Harmonize virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with sun and moon, sequence with the four seasons, and fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits.” The wondrousness of the Dao-nature’s golden elixir—even heaven and earth cannot fathom it, even spirits cannot guess. How so? The golden elixir is the prior heaven’s qi. The sage excels at harmonizing virtue with heaven and earth, reversing creation’s workings to generate this qi. The sage matches brightness with sun and moon, inverting effort to circulate this qi. The sage skillfully aligns with the four seasons’ sequence, employing this qi so that cold and heat do not constrain one another.

The sage subtly harmonizes fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits, thereby completing this qi, and ghosts and spirits reveal their true forms. Thus, “heaven and earth’s spirits” are “beyond measure,” yet only the sage can achieve this.

“Employing it to secure the body, concealing form to hide”—what does this mean? It refers to the Way of Kun. In its function, Kun’s palace holds earth, and earth restrains Kan’s water. Its virtue benefits all things as if without contention—this is water’s function. The sage, by inverting its use, attains water’s benefit. The *Yijing*’s “use of six, employing it for eternal integrity” is Kun’s virtue.

“Beginning in the northeast, the region of Jidou”—what does this mean? Each new moon meets the sun in the Jidou region. Jidou corresponds to Gen, and Gen as a hexagram signifies yin encroaching upon yang, called the “ghostly path.” The moon, upon reaching this point, loses its brightness, hence called “losing its light.” This resembles the worldly cycle of the five phases—birth, aging, sickness, death—and the alternation of cold and heat.

“Applying and turning rightward”: heaven’s Dao moves left, while the sun, moon, and stars all turn right. When the moon reaches this region, it must darken to meet the sun, appearing like a jade disk or a gui tablet. On the first or second day, it turns rightward toward the geng direction, its radiant essence barely emerging, and its po begins to form. By the time of the full moon in Mao, the moon borrows the sun’s light, which shines from below, like the initial arising of qian’s yang. Kun’s lower position is Zhen, symbolizing the third evening—a single yang beneath two yins, qian’s eldest son, seizing the moment to enact the Dao, hence “on the third day, Zhen stirs.” On the eighth day, the first quarter appears—one yin beneath two yangs, kun’s youngest daughter, Dui, receiving ding fire, acting in kun’s stead to govern the affair. With yin and yang in harmony, spirit and brightness arise, hence “on the eighth day, Dui acts.”

At the fifteenth day, the full moon, the moon’s yang radiance is complete, thus: “At three and five, virtue is perfected, and the qian body is formed.” As the upper line corresponds, it resembles the elixir crucible where metal and water are obtained. The great yin reflects the sun, generating essence and po. The human body, mirroring the moon, produces the golden elixir. Within the crucible, the elixir forms; one remains vigilant as if facing peril, cautious when full lest it overflow, fearful when abundant lest it decline. Only the sage can remain as prudent at the end as at the beginning.

Xun continues the lineage, firmly securing and upholding it, gradually circulating the yin tally to envelop the yang qi. Gen governs advance and retreat; when the tally is full at the last quarter, it gradually congeals. Heaven’s position brings joy; lead and mercury are drawn and added, lead exhausted and mercury dried. At six-five, kun receives, binding the beginning and end. Lead and mercury both transform, and the golden elixir is complete. Though this analogy spans a single month’s practice, the work requires ten months to approximate completion, and three years to fulfill the merit. For the highest achievement, a full cycle of twelve years—it all depends on one’s accumulated conduct!

As for the great sage, who re-creates yin and yang, aligning emotion with nature, turning and uniting them, establishing a separate elixir furnace to forge the nine-cauldron great elixir—it is like the celestial pivot being re-established at zi, comparing the twelve lines to a month’s cycle, from darkness to new moon, and the new moon reaching dawn. The initial yang stirs again in the Fu hexagram. Thus it is said: “Having no fixed position, it is the ancestral origin of change.”

**Chapter Nineteen: The Function of Line Changes**

At the new moon’s dawn, Fu appears, and yang qi first flows.
Entering and exiting without hindrance, it establishes the subtle and firm.
Yellow Bell aligns with zi, and the omen flourishes.
Disseminating gentle warmth, the common people thrive in constancy.

At the crucible, the branch is applied, opening the path to true radiance.
The light gradually advances, the days lengthen.
Chou’s Great Lü binds, balancing high and low.
Lifting to form Tai, hardness and softness both flourish.

Yin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives.
Converging at yin, it moves and follows the season.
Gradually passing through Great Strength, it flanks the mao gate.
Elm pods fall, returning to their root.

Punishment and virtue contend, day and night first divide.
Guai’s yin retreats, yang ascends forward.
Washing and shaking feathers, it casts off old dust.
Qian’s vigor and brilliance broadly extend to the four neighbors.

Yang ends at si, centered and interacting.
Gou begins the sequence, treading frost first.
The cold spring at the well’s bottom—wu is Ruibin.
The guest submits to yin, yin becomes the host.

Withdrawing from the world and leaving position, it gathers its essence.
Cherishing virtue and awaiting the time, it dwells in obscurity.
Pi’s blockage is impassable; sprouts do not grow.
Yin extends, yang withdraws, and yang’s name is lost.

Observing its measure, examining the autumn’s multitude.
Nurturing the young and tender, the old and withered revive.
Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout, growing beneath cover.
Bo’s decaying limbs dissolve, its form vanishes.

When the transforming qi is exhausted, the utmost spirit is lost.
When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to kun’s origin.
Eternally following earth’s principle, it receives heaven’s proclamation.
Mysterious, distant, and subtle, separated yet connected.

Responding to measure and nurturing life, it is yin and yang’s origin.
Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning.
First lost and astray, later becoming the lord.
No level without slope—this is the Dao’s nature.

Change and renewal grow ever more abundant, ebb and flow mutually dependent.
Kun ends and fu begins, like tracing a linked ring.
Emperors and kings receive and govern, enduring for a thousand generations.

The annotation states: The previous chapter described the waxing and waning of a month—new moon, full moon, quarters—and the imagery of refining the elixir. This chapter compares the work of the twelve months’ practice. The initial attainment of the elixir corresponds to the Fu hexagram, where one yang lies beneath five yins. If sages and worthies practice this Dao, they transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood; if the wicked practice it, they lose their lives and forfeit their bodies.

King Wen of old declared: *"When companions arrive, there is no blame—reversing and returning to the Way. After seven days, the return comes; it is beneficial to proceed."* "Companions arrive" means companions come from afar; "no blame" means benefit without harm; "reversing and returning to the Way" refers to the practice of the *Yi*, acting in inversion. "After seven days, the return comes" speaks of the moon concealing its light, then re-emerging after seven days—just as humans, after seven days of movement, witness the first stirring of yang. "Beneficial to proceed" means advancing with goodness and no loss.

The *Eastern Capital Rhapsody* states: *"The sun and moon meet at the tail of the Dragon."* (The character *[左犭右龙]* is pronounced *dou*, referring to the tail star.) This signifies the imminent return of yang. Confucius said: *"In the return, do we not see the heart of Heaven and Earth?"* Yet the world does not know the heart of Heaven and Earth. Laozi named this heart the "Gate of the Mysterious Female"; Zhongli Quan pointed to it as the "Gate of Life and Door of Death."

The *Yi* says: *"Thunder lies within the earth—Fu. The former kings, on this day, closed the passes, and merchants and travelers did not move; the ruler did not attend to the four quarters."* Thunder is firm yang; earth is yielding yin. When firm yang resides within yielding yin, it restores the primordial qi. The former kings, on this day, practiced this Way, closing the passes and not attending to affairs, thereby focusing their minds and wills single-pointedly. "Merchants and travelers" represent miscellaneous distractions; "did not move" means cutting off such distractions to devote oneself wholly to the Way.

Thus, the *Xiang Zhuan* states: *"The return that is not distant is for cultivating the self."* It also says: *"The one who walks the middle path returns alone to follow the Way."* "At the dawn of the new moon, the return begins, and yang qi first flows"—the heart of the sage is one. "Return" means first concealing, then re-emerging. The initial qi of yang moves in and out, free from harm or envy.

"Erecting a marker of subtle firmness" refers to the movement and straightness of Qian. The pitch of Yellow Bell corresponds to the yang month of *zi*. "Omen" means the multitude, the beginning. All things are born from this yang qi, which first flourishes and becomes manifest. "Disseminating gentle warmth, the black-haired people attain constancy" means that through the return of gentle warmth, the qi of the first yang restores all to their proper Way.

Master Shangyang said: *"The subtlety of elixir-making lies precisely here—take heed not to treat it lightly. Those who study the Way, having received their teacher’s instructions, must understand the Three Passes and Three Signs. Why? To prepare the altar and first gather the medicinal substances. Once the substances are obtained, they move in and out, refining the work of the self, disseminating gentle warmth, allowing subtle warmth to penetrate directly—this is the First Pass and First Sign.*

*Guiding the elixir furnace, applying the firing times with intent, opening the path without excess or recklessness, distinguishing colors and harmonizing light, humbling oneself further—this is the Second Pass and Second Sign. When the pitch of Great Bamboo arrives, the sun’s shadow lengthens, corresponding to the month of *chou*. The hexagram *Tai* is formed, with earth above heaven. Though yin appears to be above, water naturally moistens downward; yang resides below, and fire rises to illuminate above—thus they unite.*

The *Wings* say: *"The yielding above and the firm below—these two qi interact and respond, coming together in stillness and joy. The male submits below, the female above—thus there is harmony and rightness."* When the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth becomes a treasure. Yielding is applied first, allowing the other to become the master; firmness is applied afterward, and I become the guest. The male begins with a small departure, while the female arrives in great measure. Metal and qi assist one another, and yang completes the body of Qian.

Here, firmness and yielding flourish together, yin and yang unite—this is the Third Pass and Third Sign. *"Gradually progressing to Great Strength,"* the elixir congeals and returns; *"flanking the gate of mao,"* the elm pods return to the root.

“Punishment and virtue bear one another, day and night first divide”—this speaks of the omen of the elixir, descending into the Yellow Court, where it must be guarded and nurtured with care and focus.

In the *Guai* hexagram, yin severs and parts, while yang qi returns, and the golden elixir conceives. *“Qian’s vigor shines brightly”*—metal qi is now pure, and yang ends at *si*. Moving the yin tally, *Gou* suddenly embraces, preventing yang’s escape; yang regains yin, and *“yin becomes the master.”*

In *Kun*’s transformation, the first six treads frost—cold springs lie at the well’s bottom, yin qi descends, and the sixth month brings retreat. Essence is gathered, awaiting the hour. By the seventh month of *Pi*, yin and yang do not communicate; yin extends while yang withdraws, and yang qi shines within. In the eighth month of *Guan*, one observes the signs, measuring autumn’s mood, nurturing the tender and young, like wheat’s sprouts; the withered revives, like mustard’s shoots. When the transforming qi is exhausted, its form is worn away by *Bo*. When the Way is exhausted, it returns—reverting to *Kun*’s origin. Coming and going, it eternally follows and accords with Heaven.

This text’s composition holds deep method and order: some chapters begin with an overture, others conclude with a summary. Where there is no overture, the summary binds it; where there is no summary, the overture unifies it. This chapter, for instance, lacks an overture and is bound by its conclusion. Its opening line reads: *“At the new moon’s dawn, it is *Fu*; *Fu* becomes *Lin*, *Lin* becomes *Tai*, *Tai* becomes *Dazhuang*, *Dazhuang* becomes *Guai*, *Guai* becomes *Qian*, *Qian* becomes *Gou*, *Gou* becomes *Dun*, *Dun* becomes *Pi*, *Pi* becomes *Guan*, *Guan* becomes *Bo*, *Bo* becomes *Kun*.”* The closing lines summarize: *“Primal, profound, distant, subtle—barriers yet linked.”* These two phrases are most concise.

*“Primal, profound, distant, subtle”*—yin and yang, two substances, reach the utmost mystery and obscurity, beyond grasp or fathoming; they attain the utmost subtlety, beyond thought or conjecture, yet their transformation’s power surpasses Heaven and Earth. *“Barriers yet linked”*—though the two are separated by vast distances, if the Yellow Dame mediates their union, the farthest becomes the nearest. Thus, the two substances align with measure and conceive the seed—this is *“the origin of yin and yang.”* The sage employs them to enact the Dao, and what is *“boundless and indistinct”*—beyond measure—the sage reverses to apply.

*“First lost, then misguided; later, the lord and ruler”*—yielding, smooth, beneficial, and upright, the noble one’s path: first straying from the Way, later following the constant. These are the words of the *Ten Wings*. The immortal elder elaborates: in the midst, *“yin becomes the master”*; at the end, *“later, the lord and ruler”*—all are *Kun*’s advantage, Earth’s Dao.

*“No plain without slope—this is the Dao’s nature.”* Water’s utmost level pools into a deep abyss; when banks block its flow, the slope fills like a basin, and water naturally overflows. This analogy illustrates the Dao’s natural principle.

*“Transforming and ever-increasing”*—like *Fu* ascending to *Qian*; *“waning and waxing in turn”*—like *Gou* descending to *Kun*. Thus it is said: *“Ending with *Kun*, beginning anew, like tracing a linked ring.”*

*“If emperors and kings uphold and serve the Dao of Qian and Kun’s reversal and compliance, their lives span a thousand years, which is not excessive. If their merit is lofty and conduct illustrious, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight is but their due.”* In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor first lived as a commoner, cultivating worldly blessings; in his second life, he became a minister, then cultivated transcendent merits; in his third, he became a ruler. He then relinquished the world, abandoning myriad affairs, seeking secluded mountains and waters. At Junshan by Lake Dongting, he found the Dinghu cauldron and refined the Great Elixir of Nine Returns. After its completion, he ascended in broad daylight, riding a dragon. This is why the mountain in Dongting Lake is called Junshan.

**Chapter Twenty: Nurturing Nature and Establishing Destiny**—To nurture nature, prolong life, and reverse fate’s decree.

Examine the end with care, and first consider its beginning. The body that humans receive is fundamentally rooted in nothingness. Primordial essence spreads like clouds, borne by qi at the outset. Yin and yang serve as its measure, the dwelling of hun and po. The yang spirit is the sun’s hun; the yin spirit, the moon’s po. Hun and po, each becomes the other’s chamber. Nature presides within, establishing its inner bounds; emotion governs without, building walls and outer enclosures. When walls and enclosures are complete, beings find peace. At this time, emotion harmonizes with Heaven and Earth. Heaven moves and straightens, qi spreads and essence flows; Earth is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s abode. The firm extends then retreats; the yielding transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversals, eight reunions, six residences. The male is white, the female red—metal and fire restrain each other. Then water settles fire, the inception of the Five Phases. Supreme goodness resembles water, clear and without flaw. The Dao’s form and image, the True One, are difficult to depict. Though transformed and dispersed, each abides alone. Like a chicken’s egg, white and black align, its length and breadth a single inch, the beginning of all. Four limbs and five viscera, sinews and bones all complete. After ten months, it emerges from its womb. Bones soft and pliable, flesh smooth as lead.

*This chapter speaks of how one must first nurture nature before cultivating destiny. What, then, is nature? It is the substance of Qian. If one can nurture it, then Qian’s yang will not wane. Essence is guarded within, qi arises without—this is how one refines the elixir and enters sagehood. Yet people do not know what these two, nature and destiny, truly are. Some guess nature to be luminous awareness, others take it as the stubborn heart of flesh, or identify thought and perception as nature, or point to the intangible as nature, or liken it to empty nothingness. Some take orders as destiny, yet how would they know that the profound and obscure is nature (or destiny), or recognize the gate of ceaseless transformation as destiny? Merely blindly guessing and dreaming—how can one grasp the Dao of the sages?*

The Yellow Emperor said: “Heavenly nature is human; the human heart is a mechanism. The noble one, gaining it, remains steadfast in adversity (or in person); the petty one, gaining it, treats life lightly.” Confucius said: “Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and so reach destiny.” Mencius said: “Preserve the heart, nurture nature—this is how one awaits Heaven’s mandate. Whether short-lived or long-lived, remain unwavering; cultivate the self to await it—this is how one establishes destiny.” The Dao of the sages, transmitted to Mencius, is exceedingly clear. The *Wings* states: “Of old, the sages composed the *Yi* to accord with the principles of nature and destiny. Thus they established Heaven’s Dao as yin and yang, Earth’s Dao as yielding and firm, and humanity’s Dao as benevolence and righteousness.”

The perfected immortals say: “To cultivate nature without cultivating destiny—how can one enter sagehood? Cultivate destiny only after cultivating nature, then one enters the path of practice.” Some say Buddhists cultivate nature while Daoists cultivate destiny—how could there be two Daos in the world? This is not to fathom Mencius’ way of preserving the heart, nurturing nature, cultivating the self, and establishing destiny. Thus, to establish destiny, first nurture nature. Without awakening to nature, how can one know destiny? Therefore, the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “What Heaven decrees is called nature; following nature is called the Dao.” Thus, the sage has no dual heart.

This is what is meant by “to nurture nature, prolong life, and reverse fate’s decree.” People do not know what nurturing nature entails, so Lü Dongbin uses elixir refinement to illustrate it. They do not know what establishing destiny entails, so Zhang and Xu use elixir refinement as a metaphor. “Only essence, only unity, holding fast to the center”—this is nurturing nature. “Male and female unite essence, the myriad things transform and arise”—this is establishing destiny. “Accumulating essence, amassing qi”—this is nurturing nature. “Flowing wu to ji”—this is establishing destiny.

“Examine the end with care” refers to those who, though endowed with intelligence, cling to bias and refuse to turn back, asserting that where there is birth, there must be death—how could there be longevity? Sages, immortals, and buddhas are all born of Heaven; how could a teacher confer them, or a person create them? Failing to examine this, one resigns to death. “First consider its beginning” means “consider” is to reflect. One should reflect: from whence does my body arise? If one says it comes from the qi of parents’ yin and yang, then that qi of yin and yang must be able to prolong life and attain sagehood or buddhahood. Thus, refining the Great Elixir is no different from the moment of receiving qi at birth—only the direction differs.

Confucius said: “Not knowing life, how can one know death?” The sage clarifies the causes of life and death in nature and destiny, demonstrating the Dao of yin and yang and the reasons for their reversal. Thus, following the flow to give life to beings is the human way; reversing the flow to give birth to the elixir is the sagely way. This is what is meant by “primordial essence spreads like clouds, borne by qi at the outset.”

What does “yin and yang serve as its measure, the dwelling of hun and po” mean? Yin and yang take hun and po as their substance, while hun and po take yin and yang as their abode. Li is the sun’s hun; Kan is the moon’s po. Po is yang within yin, governed by wu earth; hun is yin within yang, governed by ji earth. Hun and po become each other’s chambers, yin and yang mutually communicating. Nature presides over true essence within, establishing its inner bounds; emotion governs qi without, building walls and outer enclosures.

What is the “wall”? It is the encasing of the radiant flower. What is the “enclosure”? It is the chamber for refining the elixir. At this time, Qian’s nature moves and straightens, so essence and qi unite; Kun’s emotion is still and receptive, serving as the Dao’s abode. The firm and straight, once extended, retreats; the yielding and transformative, spreading moisture, nourishes. The elixir is born in the crucible, returning and reversing to completion.

What is meant by “nine returns”? Earth produces metal in four phases; Heaven completes silver in nine. Dragon and tiger intertwine, the qi of metal and silver returns to the crucible—hence “nine returns.”

The "seven returns" refer to Earth’s second phase producing fire and Heaven’s seventh phase completing cinnabar. As hun and po yearn for each other, the essence of cinnabar and fire reflects back into the crucible—hence "seven returns."

The "eightfold return" speaks of Heaven’s third phase producing wood and Earth’s eighth phase completing mercury. When wu and ji unite, the true essence of wood and mercury returns to refine within the crucible—hence "eightfold return."

The "sixfold dwelling" denotes Heaven’s first phase producing water and Earth’s sixth phase completing lead. As nature and emotion resonate, the marvel of lead and mercury revolves and resides within the crucible—hence "sixfold dwelling."

"Male white, female red—metal and water constrain each other": the male belongs to the Azure Dragon’s wood, the female to the White Tiger’s metal. Refined by the essence of Li fire, they revert to red.

"Thus water stabilizes fire": when the altar is pure and the medicinal substances authentic, one must adjust the water’s quantity by adding or withdrawing, and regulate the fire’s intensity by refining. This marks the inception of the Five Phases’ transformation.

"Supreme goodness resembles water": within water lies metal, capable of generating flowing water. When its utmost clarity is attained, utterly undisturbed, without substance or flaw, only then can transformation occur—this is called "supreme goodness."

"The Dao’s form and image": male and female embody the Dao’s form, Qian and Kun manifest its image. Within form and image, the true unity of qi arises—yet one cannot exhaust its form nor depict its image. Thus, this form and this image each follow their transformative mechanisms, dispersing to reside in their places, wielding life and death. Jia and Yi roam from the East; Geng and Xin lodge in the West—hence "each dwells alone."

"Like a hen’s egg": the returned elixir possesses form. "Black and white align": yin and yang achieve union.

"‘A span in length and breadth’": at the initial coagulation of the elixir, it arrives subtle as a grain of millet, gradually expanding to a full inch in breadth. Not only does the spirit-chamber become replete, warmth suffuses the four limbs, moisture nourishes the five viscera, and sinews and bones all attain blissful ease. After ten months of work complete, the elixir has taken form, shedding its womb—this is called the "yang spirit." The yang spirit’s image is formed from primordial qi congealed; its bones may be coiled and supple, its flesh smooth as lead powder. Unlike the essence and blood of later heaven that compose human beings—whose bones are heavy and flesh turbid, incapable of transformation—"flesh smooth as lead" refers to lead powder, also called "lead bloom," commonly known as "water powder," white and soft and smooth, with which women adorn their faces to enhance their radiance. How much more so, then, this yang spirit, formed from the congealed qi of primordial true lead? This corresponds to the sixth chapter’s "nurturing the self within." Chapter Twenty-One: The Mutual Transformation of the Two Qi

Just as a yang-burning mirror draws fire, without the sun no light is born.

Just as the yang-burning mirror cannot produce fire without the sun,
So too the *fangzhu* cannot yield water or broth without the stars and moon.
The two qi are dark and distant,
Yet their resonance and transformation still interflow—
How much more so within the nearness of this embodied self?
All lies intimately within the heart and breast.

Yin and yang pair with the sun and moon;
Water and fire serve as their manifest signs.
[Annotation:] The *yang-sui* is a yang object, containing within it qi, and thus responds to the sun to generate fire. The *fangzhu* is a yin object, containing within it essence, and thus responds to the moon to generate water. Though the sun and moon are lofty and remote in the heavens, and the *yang-sui* and *fangzhu* are of the utmost subtlety, the two qi of yin and yang still mutually resonate and transform. How much more so within the human body, where true yin and true yang lie intimately within the heart and breast, so close and easily sought—how could they fail to interflow and transform? It is only because later people have lost the Way!

The yin and yang of the human body may be likened to the sun and moon in the heavens;
The water and fire of the various burning mirrors serve as metaphors for the essence and qi of the human body.
Even inanimate things thus interflow—
How much more do sentient, spiritual beings naturally interact and resonate?
Among all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most spiritually endowed.
Even the basest and most ignorant know the principle of yin and yang’s transformative nurturance,
And do not require instruction to act accordingly.
Yet all the ignorant and deluded know only the sequential course that gives birth to beings—
As for the reverse application, without a teacher, none can fathom it.
For the reverse application of yin and yang is the Way of refining essence and subduing qi to form the elixir.

This chapter simply clarifies how the two qi of yin and yang interflow and resonate to accomplish transformation.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Three Treasures as the Pivotal Mechanism**

The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—
Seal them tightly, let nothing pass through.
The true person withdraws into the deep abyss,
Floating and wandering, guarding the compass’s center.
Turning and curving to see and hear,
Opening and closing all in unison—
These serve as the pivot and axle for the self,
In movement and stillness, inexhaustibly.

The *li* qi inwardly defends and protects;
The *kan* then does not employ hearing.
The *dui* closes, not speaking—
Rare words accord with the primal chaos.
Once these three are secured as the pivotal mechanism,
Relax the body and dwell in the empty chamber.
Entrust the will to return to emptiness and nonbeing,
Taking absence of thought as the constant norm.

Proof is difficult to shift;
The heart must focus, not straying east or west.
In sleep, spirit embraces spirit;
In waking, await the moment of presence or absence.
The complexion gradually becomes moist and lustrous,
The bones and joints grow ever more firm and strong.
Expel all the yin demons,
Then establish the true yang.

Unceasing in cultivation,
The qi will then move like clouds and rain.
Drizzling like spring’s gentle rain,
Flowing like melting ice—
From the head it streams down to the feet,
Then ultimately ascends again.
Coming and going, penetrating the boundless,
Permeating the body’s every vessel.

Reversal is the verification of the Dao;
Weakness is the handle of virtue.
Plowing and weeding the long-accumulated filth,
The finest subtleties attain harmony and smoothness.
The turbid is the path to clarity;
Prolonged darkness will then shine bright.

[Annotation:] This chapter expounds in detail the secret essentials of entering the chamber to refine the elixir. Once the student receives the teacher’s oral instructions, they must recite this chapter ten thousand times, pondering each line and scrutinizing each character. Do not read carelessly past it—even a single word misplaced will prevent the elixir’s formation. For this chapter is the most crucial and precise point of the *Cantong Qi*. Within it are matters not to be divulged in words—treasured by heaven above.

Moreover, of all born into this world,
There is none whose nature is not originally good.

As years grow long, those not endowed with sagely capacity—those who do not steadfastly guard their integrity—rarely avoid being led astray by reckless companions and deceitful friends, drawn outward by their influence, while within, sounds and sights, cravings and desires bewilder the mind. At the gates of the six senses, every perception becomes an object of attachment; day in and day out, each moment wears away the essence. The most bitter poisons are the ear, the eye, and the mouth. The ear listens to sounds, the eye gazes upon forms, the mouth craves flavors. Thus, fortune is ruined by form, harm arrives with sound, illness enters through the mouth, dreams arise and death comes in drunkenness—an endless cycle of suffering. Most scholars fail to attain the Dao because these three—ear, eye, and mouth—along with neighboring temptations and mutual enticements, drown their true nature.

The Immortal Elder regards the ear, eye, and mouth as the "Three Treasures," honoring them and never daring to indulge them lightly. Thus, he seals them tightly to prevent their opening. Only when entering the chamber, with the great function manifest before one, and the six senses in profound stillness, may the work of gathering and refining begin.

The "True Person" is one’s own earth; "lurking in the deep abyss" means using one’s earth to overcome water in the quest for the elixir. "Floating and roaming, guarding the center of the compass" refers to the "Cavern of Creation"—if refining the great elixir in the span of this single token, one must be vigilant and discreet. "Floating and roaming" means abiding in constant stillness while ever responsive, never straying for even a moment; "guarding" means diligently turning the light inward, earnestly awaiting the moment. These two lines are another crucial and precise point in the *Cantong Qi*, akin to wielding a great axe with utmost effort.

Thus, the profound words and teachings uttered by true immortals and sagely masters remain beyond the guesswork of ten thousand generations. Master Shangyang revealed them fully, wishing only that all might understand and practice this Way.

"‘Turning and bending to see and hear’ does not mean dull closure; within, one must subtly turn and bend to observe and listen, allowing the opening and closing of *wu*-earth to be neither concealed nor deceived, merging with *ji*-earth in perfect accord, as if swallowing or savoring. The nature of *ji* is reckless and wild—only with *wu*-earth as its pivot and restraint can it be governed, hence the saying ‘as *wu*’s pivot and restraint.’

What is meant by ‘in movement and stillness, never exhausted’? The Dao of *ji* is direct in motion and single-minded in stillness; if skillfully employed, it will not reach depletion. ‘Departing *qi* to receive *ying* and *wei*’ refers to the inner illumination of the eyes; ‘*kan* no longer employs hearing’ means the ears must listen inwardly; ‘*dui* unites without speech’ signifies quieting words to regulate the breath, aligning with the transformations of primordial chaos. Only when these three are mastered at their crucial junctures can one ‘relax the body in an empty chamber.’ ‘Relaxing the body’ means to move with ease and without strain; ‘empty chamber’ denotes solemn stillness, free from distraction. ‘Entrusting the will to return to emptiness and nothingness’—for emptiness and nothingness are the source from which *qi* arises. This is called the primordial *qi*, which comes from the midst of emptiness and nothingness; to obtain this *qi*, one must bend the will and thoughts in pursuit of it.

‘Abiding in no-thought as the constant’—the phrase ‘no-thought’ is most essential. ‘The true person dwells in the deep abyss’—‘no-thought’ responds to this; ‘floating and roaming, guarding the center of the compass’—‘no-thought’ awaits this; ‘breathing mutually nurtures’—‘no-thought’ brings this about; ‘the three natures unite in harmony’—‘no-thought’ enters into this. To respond, to await, to bring about, to enter—such practices are many, and thus are made constant.

‘Proof against shifting and swaying’—*wu* as a substance is called the ‘White Tiger’; the tiger’s nature is prone to change, easily stirred and hard to settle. If *ji*-earth is to meet it, one must never allow reckless shifting or swaying; should the mind waver or lack focus, calamity may arise. Earlier it was said ‘no-thought,’ and now it is said ‘the mind must be focused, never reckless’—can one not ponder this deeply? ‘In sleep, spirit and *qi* embrace’—when the mind is neither reckless nor shifting, in that moment of sleep, spirit and *qi* naturally unite as one. Yet one must remain ever awake and ever aware, awaiting the presence or absence of this single *qi*.

In the practice of elixir refinement, only when effort is applied to this degree does one begin to perceive its effects. In the past, when I first received my teacher’s instructions, this segment seemed most difficult; recently, while cultivating this great work on the northern slope of Mount Daluo, I have come to find it easy. The key lies in unwavering, ceaseless practice—only then can the full merit be accomplished. Thus, when the immortal elder engages in gathering and refining, not the slightest error can be tolerated. From ‘the complexion gradually becomes moistened’ onward, each line is tightly applied, with none left idle; all describe the natural effects that follow the attainment of the elixir, revealing its manifold signs.

For those who cultivate this Dao, dwelling in the turbid and defiled world while practicing the Dharma beyond it, if one persists without interruption, in time the merit will surely be achieved. Do not, on account of minor demonic obstacles, abandon the path midway. This is what is meant by ‘the turbid is the path to clarity’—prolonged darkness will give way to illumination. Attaining sagehood and becoming an immortal may be hoped for in days to come; the merit is most swiftly realized, hence it is called the ‘divine elixir.’

**Chapter Twenty-Three: Side Doors Yield No Merit**
The world delights in petty arts, failing to discern the depth of the Dao."

Those who abandon the true Way to follow deviant paths seek swift results but find no passage. Like the blind refusing a staff or the deaf straining to hear music, they dive into water to hunt pheasants and hares, or climb mountains in search of fish and dragons. They plant wheat hoping for millet, or wield compasses to seek squares. Exhausting their spirit and laboring year after year, they see no merit.

To know the method of *fushi* (ingesting the elixir), the matter is simple and unburdened. The annotation states: “The world delights in petty arts”—petty arts are not the Dao. If one’s vessel is narrow and small, the great Dao cannot be heard. The Dao encompasses heaven and earth; its depth is as vast as the sea. Yet before one can hear it, one is first misled by blind teachers (or poisoned). The first words one hears become the master, and the true Way has no chance to be heard.

Side doors favor *cai-zhan* (sexual arts), “abandoning the true to follow deviant paths.” Taking herbs to seek swift ascension is “seeking speed but finding no passage.” Exhausting one’s essence without nurturing nature is “like the blind refusing a staff.” Borrowing the Way to engage in clever debate is “like the deaf listening to music.” “Diving into water to hunt pheasants and hares”—why not study the mutual generation of the Five Phases without inversion? “Climbing mountains in search of fish and dragons”; sitting in stillness to seek immortality is “planting wheat to harvest millet”; seeking the Way through non-action is “wielding compasses to seek squares.” All such efforts “exhaust spirit and labor.” Without encountering a sage-teacher, “year after year, no merit is seen.”

“To know the method of *fushi*,” the ancient immortals’ words are not verbose: “*Fu qi* (subduing qi) does not mean *fu qi* (ingesting qi); ingesting qi requires *fu qi*. Ingesting qi does not grant longevity; longevity requires *fu qi*.” These words are the true esoteric formula, proclaimed to the loftiest adepts.

**Chapter Twenty-Four: The Flowing Pearl and Golden Flower**
The sun’s flowing pearl ever seeks to leave man. Only when the golden flower is attained does it turn and interact, transforming into a white liquid, congealing into utmost hardness. The golden flower sings first; in a moment, it dissolves into water, like horse’s teeth or coral. Yang then goes to harmonize, and nature and disposition become spontaneous.

When yin is pressed by time, confined within the gate of restraint, the compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness, the stern father issues commands, and the descendants are taught. The Five Phases intermingle as kings, each relying on the other to generate. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal fells wood to flourish.

The Three and Five with the One are the essence of heaven and earth. They may be transmitted orally but are difficult to convey in writing. The child (zi) should turn right, while noon (wu) rotates east. Mao (east) and you (west) form a boundary, giving rise to the names of host and guest.

The dragon calls to the tiger; the tiger inhales its essence. Both consume each other, each coveting the other’s advantage. Thus they interlock and swallow, chewing and devouring one another. When Mars guards the west and Venus traverses the sky, where the killing qi descends, what can stand unshaken? Like the cat guarding the mouse or the sparrow fearing the hawk, each has its function—how dare they make a sound?

Without grasping the principle, one should not speak recklessly. Exhausting one’s family wealth, leaving wife and children hungry and poor, from ancient times to now, countless have pursued this, yet few have succeeded. Seeking rare medicines widely only diverges from the Dao.

The annotation states: This chapter clearly points to the flowing pearl and golden flower as the two entities of yin and yang, revealing the secret essentials of refinement. The details disclosed are most thorough; as for oral transmission, it cannot be conveyed in writing.

Master Shangyang further expounds this meaning in verse:
The sun’s flowing pearl, in *Li* resides the sun-crow;
The maiden of *Li* Palace, neither form nor beauty.
The sun’s hidden brightness is truly called the father of *Qian*;
Within cinnabar lies mercury, mercury is the ancestor of cinnabar.

People, led astray by the six thieves, carve and chisel the flowing pearl, causing it to drip (like dragon’s spittle) or flee. Metal originally dwells in *Dui*, lodging in *Kan* to generate the flower. *Kan*’s true water can then overcome *Li*’s cinnabar. Mercury, restrained by metal and water, transforms and changes, becoming a white liquid.

When refined at the proper time, metal returns to the fore, and the flower blooms first. True earth is called *ji*; *ji* must be spiritually potent, for *ji* is the earth spirit. A jade platform surges, ascending the high seat. Exposing both feet, the golden flower transforms into water. In a moment, its color resembles horse’s teeth or stalactite coral.

*Qian* yang is the guest, going forth to seek a companion. Yang’s nature and yin’s disposition entwine warmly. Yin is pressed by yang; yang is urged by yin. The other urges, I press—time and yin are restrained. Between the two kidneys is called the “gate of restraint,” one yin and one yang, one *Qian* and one *Kun*.

The compassionate mother is called metal; metal generates *Kan* water. Water is the metal elder; water is the filial son. The stern father is called wood; wood generates cinnabar mercury. The son begets the grandson, the son follows the grandson’s steps. Fearing lack of focus, the stern father issues commands. The Five Phases intermingle as kings, inverting and responding to mutual conquest. Lead, mercury, cinnabar, and silver rely on earth. Fire flourishes to generate earth; earth is the mother of metal. Fire as king melts metal; wood fears metal’s punishment. Metal felled by fire allows wood to flourish.

The southeast sums to five: wood three, fire two. The northwest sums to five: water one, metal four. The center is *wu-ji*, called the Three and Five. From one to ten thousand, from trillions to infinity, numbers unite heaven and earth, inspiring the utmost essence. This resonance and union require clarity in oral transmission.

The child (zi) should turn right, swiftly or haltingly—yang metal generates the child. Noon (wu) rotates east—yin mercury generates noon, enclosing and securing yang essence. Mao (east) and you (west) lie east and west, named host and guest. Metal and wood are separated, a distance of ten thousand *li*. Embracing benevolence and virtue, metal delights in wood’s compliance. The dragon calls, the tiger inhales—metal cherishes wood’s benevolence. One is host, one is guest, consuming and cherishing each other.

One crow, one rabbit, both covet advantage. One man, one woman, thus interlocking and swallowing. One tortoise, one snake, chewing and devouring each other. The southern spirit, the Vermilion Bird and Mars, guards the west, refining metal’s virtue. *Dui*’s killing direction—beware of the slightest error.

Nurturing and storing the vital intent, this *qi* is called "Great White." Traversing the Yellow Way, its trust returns to the Gate of *Qian*. When the killing *qi* arrives, the generative *qi* naturally spreads. Like a cat seizing a mouse, or a sparrow fearing the goshawk, each attains its function—how dare there be a sound?

Without the oral instructions, what idle conjectures waste one’s family wealth, pursuing heterodox byways? Crooked paths and devious trails of *caizhan* mislead the true. To mislead the true is a grave offense—how could one spare even the destitute? From ancient times to now, countless millions have sought this, yet without meeting a true master, few have succeeded. Unenlightened in yin and yang, how can one know their kindred? Seeking the luminous medicine far and wide only further depletes the true *qi*.

Metals, stones, grasses, and trees—unrelated and devoid of sentiment—deviate far from the Dao, separated by ten thousand leagues. Here, the method is outlined for later learners, its essentials expounded. Once the profound canon is fully revealed, one may become an immortal.

**Chapter Twenty-Five: If Truly Encountered**

If truly encountered, one beholds its beginnings and threads. By kindred analogy, the end and beginning of things are measured. The Five Phases overcome one another, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains the nourishing fluid; the father governs bestowal. Essence congeals, form flows—metal and stone endure uncorrupted. With focused absorption and no leakage, one attains the Dao.

Like a pole casting a shadow, or an echo answering a call—how could this not be wondrous? Such are the supreme images of Heaven and Earth.

If a mere inch of wild aconite or a single tael of croton enters the throat, one stiffens instantly, unable to bend or rise. At such a moment, even if King Wen cast the yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted the hexagrams, Bian Que wielded his needles, or Wu Xian beat his drum, how could they revive the stricken, restore them to run and race?

The annotation states: This chapter admonishes that upon encountering a teacher, one must first examine carefully, discerning their beginnings and threads. Determine whether they are true or false, testing them against the *Cantong Qi*. A genuine master answers without ignorance, leaving no question unaddressed; a blind teacher knows not nine out of ten. With a hundred deceptions and strange tricks, they lead others into the weeds—some claiming silence as the Dao, others insisting on sitting in meditation to observe emptiness. Ask them of cinnabar and mercury, tiger and dragon, the separation of metal and wood, the trigram *Zhen* of three days, or the reversal of primordial qi, and they fall mute, unable to respond. Yet foolish worldlings, hearing only that so-and-so sat in meditation for years or entered such-and-such a marketplace, rush to declare them enlightened. Do they not know the rebuke of Mazu and Nanyue for grinding bricks? Do they not understand the principles of yin and yang, of devouring and generating, of life and death?

There are those vulgar fellows who memorize the dregs of others’ words, priding themselves on speaking of Chan, wielding sharp debate, calling it the "School of Nature," and pointing to this as the Dao—fooling the world, most laughable indeed. How would they know that Chan has its nature? What is nature? It is the *ninth line of Qian in action*, its movement direct. If one comprehends this, it is the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*. What is Chan? It is the *sixth line of Kun in action*, its movement expansive. If one knows this, it is the *wondrous mind of Nirvana*. When Chan and nature unite, it is like using earth to refine lead. When metal and wood interact, it is like using lead to subdue mercury. When benevolence and righteousness are applied, it is like nurturing qi with uprightness. Thus, the alternation of yin and yang is the Dao of the *Yijing*. Cultivating concentration in the Palace of *Li* is the essence of Chan; seeking the mysterious in the Watery Mansion is the treasury of the elixir. Though their names differ in three, the Dao is one. Observing the beginnings and threads of the Three Teachings’ cultivation, all require kindred methods to succeed—this is what is meant by "measuring by kindred analogy." What is "measuring the end and beginning of things"? It is to gauge the causes of yin and yang’s waxing and waning in the lives of humans and all beings.

Thus, the Five Phases generate and overcome one another, alternating between prosperity and decline, changing as father and mother through kalpas. The Way practiced by the highest sages and perfected ones is nothing but yin and yang. That which governs the storage of nourishing fluid is *Kun* and *Dui*, alternating to become the Holy Mother. That which bestows the marvel of life and generation is *Qian* and *Zhen*, alternating to become the Numinous Father. Qi and fluid congeal into essence, flowing to form shape, coalescing into the elixir—firm as metal and stone, incorruptible. With careful examination and focused absorption, one prevents leakage and may attain the Dao. Like erecting a hundred-foot pole to cast a shadow, or calling into a thousand-peak valley to hear an echo—yin and yang naturally resonate, their interaction most wondrous, aligning with the supreme images of Heaven and Earth’s creation.

Wild aconite and croton, inanimate plants and trees, can still kill. Even the great sage King Wen, the near-sage Duke of Zhou and Confucius, the divine physician Bian Que, and the worthy teacher Wu Xian—with their yarrow divination, needles, and prayers—could not cure such poison. How much more so with the qi of true yin and true yang, kindred and sentient beings matching one another—how could they fail to congeal the numinous elixir?

**Chapter Twenty-Six: The River Girl and Yellow Sprout**

The River Girl is numinous and most divine. When fire is applied, she takes flight, vanishing like dust. Ghosts hide her, dragons conceal her—none know where she dwells. To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root.

Things devoid of yin and yang violate Heaven and defy the primordial. A hen hatching alone yields chicks incomplete. Why? Because union is unmade, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. The essence of transformation is Heaven and Earth’s nature: fire rises in flame, water flows downward—no teacher instructs them to do so. Their governance is correct, unalterable.

Observe the mating of male and female: when they couple, hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their rhythm without craft or control. The male crouches, the female arches her body, receiving the qi of the womb’s beginning—this is not merely seen at birth but mirrored in death, not taught by parents but determined at the moment of union.

The annotation states: "River" is a metaphor for the river of love, the sea of desire; "girl" is the essence of one’s own yin mercury. What is meant by "numinous and most divine"? She can give life, take life, or compose the elixir. In stillness, a single numen is inwardly nurtured; when stirred by sensation, she rushes like a spirit. As the realm moves, passion arises—blessing turns to ruin through form. The moment a thought arises, mercury flees with the fire, like dust scattered, irretrievable. Ghosts hide her essence, dragons conceal her form—clouds disperse into empty sky, and emptiness is itself form. This aligns with Chapter Twenty-Four’s "The flowing pearl of Great Yang ever seeks to leave man." People heedlessly let it pass, yet it returns again. Extending this principle, the sage’s merit endures for generations, as in many such cases.

"To restrain her, the Yellow Sprout is the root" echoes the earlier "Suddenly obtaining golden radiance, turning to rely on one another." For the River Girl, following the flow leads to easy loss—only the Yellow Sprout’s solitary yang can subdue her. The "Yellow Sprout" is the qi of the primordial, called the "True Lead of the One." Burning this lead qi as the foundation, mercury does not flee—how could it, when yin and yang are matched?

If things lacked yin and yang, they would defy the heavens of creation and betray the origin of all life. Those who refine the elixir do not depart from yin and yang in establishing their foundation. Only when the qi of the True One has returned and the elixir has ripened do they leap beyond yin and yang.

Foolish worldly men, unversed in the alchemical classics, claim that cultivators must dwell in remote mountains, live in solitude, abandon wives and children, practice grain avoidance, embrace non-action, and sit in meditation. Taking these as the Way—how misguided! If one neglects yin and yang, disregards the Five Phases, fails to distinguish metal and wood, knows not dragon and tiger, recognizes neither lead nor mercury, and remains unclear about Kan and Li, yet believes mere silence can accomplish the Dao—such is the error this book strives to correct. It repeatedly declares that only the matching of yin and yang constitutes the Way.

Consider the hen that lays eggs without a rooster—her chicks never hatch, for she is solitary yin without yang. To raise chicks, one fills a vessel with water at noon and warms it in the sun, borrowing yang qi so the chicks may fully form. Without warmth, they will not live. Why? Just as in creation, "when pairing is incomplete, the Three and Five unjoined, hard and soft sundered," how can the Way of ceaseless generation arise?

Thus, in the Land of Women, where no men dwell, if they wish to conceive, they must choose an auspicious day and, thrice daily, gaze into the well’s depths to borrow the qi of true water. By observing the well’s reflection to stimulate resonance, they may become pregnant. This is the essence of yin and yang’s transformative power—the Dao of heaven and earth’s natural mutual response. Fire flames upward, water moistens downward, yet no master guides them to do so. The origin is unified, the qi already settled.

The *Wings* states: "Great indeed is Qian’s origin! The myriad things rely on it for beginning, for it governs heaven." As Qian’s Dao transforms and changes, each thing attains its nature and destiny. Once nature and destiny are fixed, how can they be altered? Hence it is said: "Observe the moment when male and female unite—hard and soft bind inseparably, attaining their proper measure without artifice or control. The male must lie prone at birth, the female supine—these are principles so absolute that even creation cannot alter them. Not only in life but even in drowning and death, the male lies prone, the female supine. This is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union, fixed from the very beginning."

To vulgar eyes, such words may seem trivial, but the author’s intent is to illuminate the principles of yin and yang. Thus, the repetition is purposeful, not tedious.

**Chapter Twenty-Seven: Mutual Dependence of Male and Female**

Kan, the male, is the moon; Li, the female, is the sun. The sun bestows virtue, the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its counterpart, yin encroaches upon its brightness. At the dark and new moons, they eclipse and obscure one another, yang’s form diminishing as yin’s calamity arises.

Male and female depend on each other, containing earth to nourish. Male and female intermingle, seeking their kind. Metal transforms into water, water’s nature flowing freely; fire transforms into earth, blocking water’s course. The male moves and extends outward, the female remains still and conceals within. If yang overflows beyond measure, it is restrained by the female. The po governs the hun, preventing excess.

Neither cold nor hot, advancing and retreating in due time, each attains harmony and together they manifest proof.

**Annotation:** Kan is water, the moon, the middle son; Li is fire, the sun, the middle daughter. Kan is yin without and yang within, containing wu earth to store metal and water, nurturing its yin po—this is the center of emotion, the gate of Dao and righteousness, the white within black. Li is yin within and yang without, containing ji earth to house cinnabar and mercury, governing its yang po—this is the completion of nature, the embodiment of benevolent virtue, the black within white.

The moon’s body is inherently dark, but receiving the sun’s transformation, its light and brilliance are restored, neither body diminished. "Yang loses its counterpart"—*counterpart* means union; yin encroaches upon yang’s brightness. "Eclipse" refers to the dark and new moons, when the moon obscures the sun’s light, directly opposing it. The sun’s body lies above, the moon below, temporarily blocking the sun’s light—this is called "yang’s form diminishing as yin’s calamity arises." Thus, worldly people cannot preserve true yang, repeatedly scorched by yin.

If yin and yang of the same kind meet in inversion and mutual attraction—"male and female mutually seek one another"—then the mechanism of transformation is sought in reverse. Thus, the dui metal transforms to generate kan water, but without true earth, the water of kan will overflow and flood. Within li there is fire, and fire can generate ji earth to restrain kan water, so the water does not overflow.

Therefore, the Dao of the male is qian’s hardness outwardly expressed; the virtue of the female is kun’s stillness inwardly concealed. If qian’s outward expression exceeds its measure and oversteps its bounds, it will be constrained by the kun female. "The po restrains the hun"—po belongs to dui, hun to zhen; zhen is male, dui female, the union of yin and yang. "Do not indulge in excess"—one must ensure alternating cold and heat, proper advance and retreat, timely harmony, without error or deviation. Then yin and yang each emit their signs, and their effects become visible.

The essence of this chapter lies in excess and transgression: if one oversteps bounds and indulges in excess, yin encroaches and disaster arises, causing midwinter to adopt summer’s heat or midsummer to revert to winter’s cold. This is like the male acting while the female does not follow, yang singing while yin does not harmonize. The discord of yin and yang all stems from excess and indulgence.

Refining the elixir is not easy—one must not take it lightly. In the past, Pure Yang Elder, having received the transmission from Elder Zhongli, entered seclusion and repeatedly worked at it. Yet, as it was not yet perfected, the elixir did not immediately form. He then received the *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* from the Perfected Immortal Cui of Primordial Origin, and only then did he fully comprehend it. He composed a poem: *"Upon reading Perfected Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine*, / One’s mind-ground becomes ever clearer."* Thereafter, his practice swiftly bore fruit.

Later fools, taking non-action and dull emptiness as the Dao, drift through days in vague approximation, letting life and death take their course—these are the great sinners of the teaching. How dare they even speak of cultivation?

**Chapter Twenty-Eight: The Four in Chaos**

Cinnabar and wood essence, when met with metal, unite; where metal and water merge, wood and fire become companions. The four in chaos are arrayed as dragon and tiger: the dragon, yang, has an odd number; the tiger, yin, an even number. The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother; the kidneys, black, the child; li, red, the daughter; the spleen, yellow, the ancestor. The cycle begins at zi and wu.

The three treasures form one family, all returning to wu and ji.

**Annotation:** Master Shangyang said, "In the human body, the most numinous and precious are essence and qi." The *Heart Seal Scripture* regards them as the supreme medicine; Zhang Ziyang calls them the treasure of life. The books composed by the immortals share commonalities yet differ. What is common? "When metal returns to the original nature, it is called the Reverted Elixir"—this is the simplest and most universal. What differs? The terms vary: qian and kun, kan and li; bellows and furnace; opening and closing; non-being and being; yin and yang; sun and moon; mysterious female; wu and ji; hardness and softness; female and male; Dipper’s pivot; *kuigang*; crow and hare; hun and po; metal and qi; spirit and brightness; yellow sprout; river chariot; lead and silver; cinnabar and mercury; floating and sinking; white and black; primordial chaos; indistinct and vague; compass within; pivot and hinge; emptiness and nothingness; profound obscurity; true person; great abyss; walls and gates; Penglai and Kunlun; Vermilion Bird; tortoise and snake; White Tiger; Azure Dragon; pivot of the Dipper; flowing pearl; golden sand; mercury; eight minerals; yellow earth; two apertures; abode of numinous virtue; crescent moon furnace; suspended embryo tripod; red gate; bright window dust; waxing and waning crescents; civil and martial fire; cinnabar and wood essence; maiden of the Yellow River; city walls of yin and yang; horse-teeth and dry stalks; forbidden gate; knife and jade; golden flower; autumn stone; emotion and nature; host and guest; white snow; yellow chariot; mysterious channel; river drum; steamer mountain; sundial shadow; stalactite; blue-green liquid; three and five; two and seven; grains and ounces; hexagram symbols—all such names and forms are treasures within the body. Some are metaphors for gates and doors, some for the chamber of spirit, some for the tripod and vessel, some for function and form, some for observing shapes and images, some for comparing advance and retreat.

Thus, the *Book of Changes* takes qian’s straightness and kun’s openness as the gate of life and death; the elixir method takes the magpie bridge and yellow path as the road of coming and going—yet all are merely the essence and qi of one’s own body! These are provisional names with differing characters.

Therefore, this chapter speaks of "cinnabar and wood essence uniting when met with metal," which aligns with the earlier meaning of "the flowing pearl of supreme yang constantly seeks to leave man, but when it obtains the golden flower, it turns and abides." The "flowing pearl," the "maiden," and "cinnabar" all inherently possess yin but lack yang, belonging to the posterior heaven and thus unable to form the elixir. Metal and the yellow sprout, the golden flower, are the lead of the prior heaven and can refine the Reverted Elixir.

Thus, "cinnabar and wood essence" are the wood and fire within li. The father of fire is the wood of the east, jia and yi, which generates true essence—this is called the central daughter. Therefore, the wood of the east, jia and yi, and the fire of the south, bing and ding, are father and daughter. Father and daughter are yin within yang, so zhen wood and li fire are their companions. The yellow sprout and golden liquid are the lead and water within kan. The mother of water is the metal of the west, geng and xin, which nurtures its liquid—this is the central son. Therefore, the metal of the west, geng and xin, and the water of the north, ren and gui, are mother and child. Mother and child are yang within yin, so dui metal and kan water unite.

Wood, fire, metal, and water—"these four merge in primordial chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger," one in the east and one in the west. The dragon dwells in the east, its number three, hence called "the dragon’s yang with its odd number"; the tiger belongs to the west, its number four, hence called "the tiger’s yin with its even number." "Wood and fire as companions" means the dragon emerges from within fire; "metal and water unite" means the tiger is born within water. The liver, green, belongs to wood and is the father of fire; the lungs, white, belong to metal and are the mother of water; the kidneys, black, belong to water and are the child of metal; *li*, red, belongs to fire and is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow, belongs to earth and is the ancestor of the four. The child resides at the beginning of the Five Phases, thus serving as the head of the first yang.

Metal and water, wood and fire, dragon and tiger—these are called the Three Substances. If these Three Substances converge and act as one family, they must rely on the power of *wu* and *ji* earth to accomplish their function.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine: The Mutual Constraint and Virtue of Mao and You**

Hard and soft alternate in rise, traversing through cyclic distribution. Dragon in the west and tiger in the east, establishing their weft in *mao* and *you*, constraint and virtue meet in union, greeting each other with joy. Constraint governs subduing and killing; virtue governs generation and ascent. In the second month, the elm scatters its seeds as the *Kui* star aligns with *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Gang* star occupies *you*. North and south, *zi* and *wu*, serve as each other’s guiding principles. The numbers one and nine conclude and begin anew. Embracing the primordial in *xu* and *wei*, they sow essence in *zi*.

The commentary states: The Azure Dragon belongs to the east, the White Tiger to the west—this is their proper position. "Traversing through cyclic distribution" means the Azure Dragon establishes its weft in *you*, the White Tiger in *mao*, thus "constraint and virtue meet in union," and dragon and tiger rejoice in their inversion, greeting each other in reversal. Therefore, when dragon and tiger meet and converge in one place, the two substances rejoice, taking generation as virtue. If the dragon remains in the east and the tiger in the west, each fixed in its position, self-generating and self-flourishing, the two substances contend and disturb, taking killing as constraint.

Constraint signifies the discord of yin and yang, the metaphor of male and female encountering each other. Constraint refers to the sequential progression of the Five Phases; virtue refers to their inversion. Constraint is yin diminishing yang; virtue is yang uniting with yin. Constraint is where yin is abundant and yang scarce; virtue is where yin is scarce and yang abundant. For instance, four yang and two yin form the hexagram of the second month. Yang grows as yin recedes; though yang is abundant, residual yin remains. Abundant yang is virtue; residual yin governs killing. Thus, in the three spring months, the myriad things flourish together, yet the elm’s pods fall—just like a person in the prime of youth, where yang is abundant and yin scarce, growing stronger day by day. Yet at this time, desire’s fire blazes fiercely; though yang is abundant, it is all consumed by yin. Even with residual yang, it cannot govern, and the hundred illnesses invade. As yang nears depletion, one still clings to the realm of desire, exhausting effort to seek yin. When residual yang encounters yin, it is entirely consumed, and death comes suddenly. This is called virtue reverting to constraint.

If one is of superior wisdom, seizing the residual yang as a stepping stone and swiftly practicing the Way of the Reverted Elixir, one may regain long life—this is called "constraint and virtue meeting in union," hence "greeting each other with joy." Conversely, four yin and two yang form the hexagram of the eighth month. Yang is consumed by yin; though yin is abundant, residual yang remains. Abundant yin is constraint; residual yang governs generation. Thus, in the three autumn months, the myriad things wither, yet wheat sprouts anew—just like a person nearing sixty, where yin is abundant and yang scarce, growing weaker day by day. If at this time, by good fortune, residual yang remains and one practices the Way of the Golden Elixir, yang may be restored—this is called reverting from old age to youth, attaining long life and enduring vision. This is called constraint reverting to virtue.

In the second month at the *zi* hour, the *Kui* star of the Dipper aligns with the *mao* position, while the *Gang* star aligns with *si*, situated in the southeast, governing generation as virtue. In the eighth month at the *xu* hour, the *Gang* star of the Dipper occupies the *you* position, while the *Kui* star aligns with *hai*, situated in the northwest, governing killing as constraint. The classic states: "When the *Gang* star points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*; what it points to is auspicious, where it resides is inauspicious—this applies to all positions." This illustrates the function of refining the Elixir.

"North and south, *zi* and *wu*" refers to the inversion of the Five Phases.

The immortals and sages say: "When the Five Phases proceed in sequence, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit; when the Five Phases are inverted, the great earth yields its seven treasures." Thus, water and fire serve as mutual regulators, enabling the accomplishment of *ji ji* (completion). Yang arises from one and culminates at nine—when yang’s number reaches nine, it is exhausted, and exhaustion returns it to one. This is what is meant by: "The numbers of one and nine end and begin anew, containing the primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, disseminating essence at *zi*." The divine efficacy of the Elixir lies in these two lines. For *Xu* and *Wei* are the celestial positions where sun and moon conjoin; the place where the first yang arises, where tortoise and snake coil in embrace. Thus, the Great One contains the primordial *qi* of pre-heaven, and its true essence is disseminated at *zi*. This again corresponds to the principle of *zi* and *wu* as the beginning of the cycle, as discussed in the previous chapter.

Ordinary people hear only that *mao* and *you* are for bathing, yet how can they comprehend the metaphor of constraint and virtue? For virtue and generation are like obtaining the medicine in half an hour, while constraint and killing are like losing it in an instant. Therefore, when entering the chamber, one must guard against danger and contemplate peril—only then can the Elixir be refined. The immortals compare this to the flourishing of spring, when all things grow, yet the elm’s samaras wither: within virtue, one guards against constraint; within generation, one guards against killing. In the solemnity of autumn, when all things wither, yet leeks and wheat sprout: within constraint there is virtue, within killing there is generation. This text discusses these matters with utmost clarity, illuminating them in every detail. Its profound intent lies solely in obtaining the *qi* of pre-heaven.

**Chapter Thirty: The Nobleman’s Fine Match**
*Guan guan* cry the ospreys,
On the islet in the river.
Graceful and demure is the maiden,
A fine match for the nobleman.

The male does not dwell alone,
Nor the female live in solitude.
The Dark Warrior—tortoise and snake—
Coil and entwine in mutual support,
Illustrating the union of yin and yang,
Whose essence lies in mutual necessity.

Were two women to share a chamber,
Their beauty most fair,
Though Su Qin should speak persuasively
And Zhang Yi act as matchmaker,
Unleashing eloquent tongues
And deploying honeyed words,
Exerting all effort to harmonize,
Seeking to unite them as husband and wife,
Even with hair worn thin and teeth decayed,
They would never truly know one another.

If the ingredients are not of the same kind,
Their names and categories disparate,
Their measures misaligned,
Their regulators lost,
Then even if the Yellow Emperor should tend the furnace,
The Great One hold the flame,
The Eight Lords pound and refine,
Huainan blend and harmonize,
Erecting lofty altars with jade steps,
Offering unicorn flesh and phoenix fat,
Holding the register and kneeling in reverence,
Praying to the spirits and beseeching the ghosts,
Bathing in purity and fasting in solemnity,
Hoping for some result—
It would be like mending a cauldron with glue,
Or treating a wound with sal ammoniac,
Adding ice to dispel cold,
Or using hot water to quench heat,
Making turtles fly and snakes dance—
Only to see things grow ever more perverse.

The commentary states: The immortal directly points out that the Golden Elixir requires ingredients of the same kind, one yin and one yang, which must interact and resonate; one female and one male, only then can transformation and generation occur. If they dwell alone in solitude, how can the mechanism of ceaseless transformation arise? With many females and no male, how can the Way of ceaseless generation exist? To refine the Reverted Elixir, one must seek the one *qi* of pre-heaven to accomplish it.

This chapter’s words are plain and direct, and should not be reiterated. The author of this text reveals the mechanism of Heaven and Earth’s creation, embodies the virtue of Qian and Kun’s generation, illuminates the principle of the sun and moon’s conjoined brightness, and discloses the efficacy of yin and yang’s inverted operation. As the *Yi* states: "To unite one’s virtue with Heaven and Earth, one’s brightness with the sun and moon, one’s sequence with the four seasons, and one’s auspices and inauspices with ghosts and spirits. To precede Heaven and not transgress it, to follow Heaven and accord with its timing." If even Heaven does not transgress this, how much more should humans? Those who master this Way are sages; those who practice it are divine beings.

Wherever this text resides, the spirits of Heaven and Earth, the sun, moon, and stars, thunder and the myriad deities constantly guard and protect it. If a worthy person reverently receives it and recites it ten thousand times, the immortals will descend to the courtyard and impart the supreme Dao. But if a foolish person recklessly slanders it, then the gods and ghosts will secretly record their transgressions, inscribing them in the black register. At best, they will be afflicted with vile diseases; at worst, the Dark Bureau will hasten their reckoning. They will become mere shades in the netherworld, forever drowning in the sea of suffering. Rewarding the good and punishing the licentious—this is manifest and must not be neglected.

**Chapter Thirty-One: The Sages’ Secluded Refinement**
Of old, the sages and worthies,
Embraced the mysterious and held fast to the true.
They refined the Nine Cauldrons in seclusion,
Transforming their traces and concealing their presence.
They nurtured essence and cultivated spirit,
Communing with the virtue of the Three Luminaries.
Their fluids and pores, sinews and bones,
Became firm and strong.
All perverse influences were dispelled,
And the upright *qi* endured.
Through long and gradual accumulation,
They transformed their forms and became immortals.

Moved by compassion for later generations,
Those who love the Dao,
They followed the winds and gathered traces,
Interpreting ancient texts,
Composing diagrams and collections,
Revealing them to posterity.
They exposed the branches,
But concealed the root,
Adopting various names,
And obscuring the true texts.
Scholars who obtained them
Spent their lives treasuring empty cases.

Sons inherited their fathers’ pursuits,
Grandsons followed their ancestors’ paths,
Transmitting the delusion through generations,
Never gaining true insight.
Thus, officials abandoned their posts,
Farmers neglected their plowing,
Merchants forsook their goods,
And aspirants fell into poverty.
I grieve deeply for them,
And have therefore compiled this text.
Its words are concise and easy to ponder,
Its matters simple and unburdensome.
Its principles are laid out clearly,
Verifiable and observable.
Its measures are precise,
And its sequence follows accordingly.
Thus, I have composed these disordered phrases,
Opening its gates and apertures.
Let the wise ponder carefully,
And contemplate its meaning with intent.

The commentary states: The ancient sages and great worthies necessarily understood the Dao. Thus, the books of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor all speak of the Great Dao. The *Yin Fu Jing* still exists, with its three hundred and fifteen characters. Later people, not understanding the Dao, wildly guessed at its meaning, claiming that one hundred words expound the Dao, one hundred words expound the method, and one hundred words expound the techniques. They have blinded and deafened the world—how could they possibly comprehend the sages’ Dao? For in the *Yin Fu Jing*, the passage from "Observing Heaven’s Dao" (one hundred and twenty characters) sets forth the guiding principles of the Dao; from "Heaven and Earth, the myriad things’ predation" (ninety-one characters) describes the practical application...

From *"The Blind Excel at Listening"* (one hundred and four characters) lies the essence of success. Thus, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons’ Great Elixir at Mount Dinghu, riding a dragon to ascend—yet this was not the mere smelting of metals, minerals, herbs, or trees, but the subjugation of primordial *qi* to form the Elixir. Hence it is said: *subjugation and refinement are not ingestion and refinement.*

What is meant by *subjugation and refinement*? Each has its own task. For instance:
*"Embracing the Mysterious, holding fast to the True,
Concealing traces, vanishing into obscurity,
Nurturing essence, cultivating spirit,
Communing virtue with the Three Luminaries."*

These seven practices, when first undertaken, are called *furnace and fire*—this is what is meant by *refining the self*. If one can refine the self, true *qi* will suffuse the entire body, warming it as fire warms a furnace. Thus it is called *furnace and fire*, and thus *refining the self*.

*"Fluids and pores, sinews and bones grow firm,
All perverse influences are expelled,
The upright *qi* abides forever."*

These four describe *subduing the qi*—this is what is meant by *refining the Elixir*. For:
*"Embracing the Mysterious"* means inwardly holding the *qi* of the Mysterious One;
*"Holding fast to the True"* means bearing the truth of the Great Unity;
*"Concealing traces"* means veiling one’s light and hiding one’s tracks, so that few know one, and those who do are rare and precious;
*"Vanishing into obscurity"* means sinking into concealment, making oneself unrecognizable.
Thus, the ancients who excelled as adepts were subtle, wondrous, and profoundly abstruse—deep beyond comprehension.

*"Nurturing essence"* means saturating oneself with the essence of true mercury to refine the self;
*"Cultivating spirit"* means externally nourishing the spirit of the whole body to unite with *qi*.
When merit accumulates to this point, the great essential is *"communing virtue with the Three Luminaries."*
*Virtue* is the highest endeavor in cultivation. To cultivate the Dao without cultivating virtue is to have yin without yang; when virtue and Dao are both perfected, yin and yang naturally pair. Yet when people cultivate virtue, they may claim to possess it while truly lacking it, for their deluded thoughts prevent virtue from resonating. For the cultivator, the deeper the virtue, the less one thinks of it—heaven and earth, gods and spirits, the sun, moon, and stars all respond to its resonance. Zhang, Ge, and Xu, for instance, accumulated and refined themselves with sincere hearts, free from desire—this is *"communing virtue with the Three Luminaries."*

Only after diligently refining the self and accumulating virtue to the point of resonance can one subdue and refine the Great Elixir.
*"Fluids and pores"* refers to *jade fluid* (white snow) and *golden liquid* (yellow sprouts), which permeate the chamber of spirit, strengthening the sinews and bones of the entire body.
*"All perverse influences"* means the yin of the hundred bones is entirely expelled.
*"The upright *qi*"*—the yang of primordial origin—abides uncorrupted. *"With long accumulation, one transforms form and becomes immortal."* This is what the Yellow Emperor’s subjugation and refinement of the Nine Cauldrons’ Great Elixir truly means.

The *Record of Auspicious Convergence* states: *"In his first generation, the Xuanyuan clan served as commoners; in the second, as ministers; in the third, as sovereign. Having saved the world and accumulated merit, his allotted span ended, and he ascended to heaven. After the *Yin Fu Jing*, successive sages followed, as recorded in the classics: King Wen’s *Zhou Changes* clarified the Gates of Qian and Kun, the Dao of constancy in husband and wife; Confucius’ *Ten Wings* expounded the meaning of Qian’s dynamic straightness and Kun’s receptive stillness; the *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand characters revealed the Gate of Mysterious Femininity in being and non-being; Zisi’s *Doctrine of the Mean* defined *Heaven’s Mandate* as *nature* and *following nature* as the *Dao*; Mencius’ nurturing of the *vast and unyielding* made clear that it must be cultivated directly without harm. The comparisons of Lao Dan and Peng Zu, the metaphors of Liezi and Zhuangzi—all progressed from sage to immortal.*

Pitying later students who loved the Dao, the ancients displayed their teachings, inscribing them in charts and texts to guide posterity. Some revealed branches while concealing roots; others adopted names and titles to obscure the true meaning in misleading texts.
*"Revealing"* means disclosing the general outline, as in *"Are Qian and Kun the Gates of Change?"*—yet the root must be transmitted orally, hence its concealment.
*"Adopting names"* and *"obscuring meaning"* refer to matters that cannot be stated plainly, only hinted at through metaphors scattered across various books. Later sharp-eyed readers, though they obtain the texts, may never meet a true teacher and thus remain like treasures locked in a casket for life. But those who are vessels of the Dharma may follow in the footsteps of Gongsun.

Yet there are learners who, though they copy these texts, fail to grasp their master’s intent. Misled, they mislead others, leading them onto deviant paths. Never glimpsing the truth, they wander into side doors, ignorant of yin and yang, confusing the five phases. Alas for later generations of Dao cultivators who rely on these writings without oral instructions! Such people resemble scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants who have lost their proper vocations: officials seeking office without a path to the register of officials; farmers wishing to till without land to plow; artisans holding skills they cannot apply; merchants calculating profits while losing their capital.

Scholars, though they possess these writings, without receiving their master’s oral instructions, find no place to begin. They guess wildly and act recklessly—how could they attain the Way and become immortals? The venerable transcendent, moved by compassion, opened the refining furnace and forged this text as a model for ten thousand generations. Its words are concise yet their meaning easy to ponder, as in the line *“The Perfected One lurks in the deep abyss”*; its methods are simple yet its principles unfathomable, as in the phrase *“Gold returns to the original nature.”* Here, its clauses are laid bare.

The upper section is divided into fifteen chapters, revealing the workings of yin and yang and the entire process of elixir refinement. The middle section is divided into fifteen chapters, detailing weights and signs. The lower section comprises five chapters, modeling the fruition of the method. Later generations, upon seeing these enumerated clauses and verifying their substance, will find them easy to peruse. Within them, numbers and weights all follow a regulated method; with but a single pointer from a master, one may follow and practice to achieve the elixir.

*“Disordered words”* refers to the meaning of *“assuming a guise”* and *“concealing errors.”* *“Apertures”* encompass the profound mysteries of the abstruse. This is truly the bridge across the great kalpa, the lamp of wisdom in the dark thoroughfare. Later sages and worthies, ponder deeply and apply it with care. We submit that the great Dao cannot be fathomed except by sages, nor spoken of except by the worthy. Thus, a father may not transmit it to his son, nor a minister present it to his lord.

The Way of the sages—could it not be transmitted? It is said that those without virtue cannot bear it; if spoken of lightly, one will surely stumble later. Hence, *“The wise ponder deeply and apply their minds to it.”*

**Chapter Thirty-Two: Modeling the Fruition of the Method**

No model of the Dao surpasses that of Heaven and Earth—
its dark ravines stretch myriad miles.
The River Drum nears the Star Marker,
and the people all tremble in alarm.
The shadow’s reckoning falsely advances and retreats,
and for nine years calamity befalls.
The August Sovereign gazes upon it,
and the king retreats to reform himself.
The pivot rises and falls,
and harmful qi scatters in flight.
The Jiang and Huai run dry,
their waters flowing into the sea.
The female and male of Heaven and Earth
linger between *zi* and *wu*.
*Yin* and *yang* in *yin* and *shen* are the ancestors,
emerging and entering, completing their beginning and end.
Following the Dipper and the Beckoning Star,
grasping the balance to fix the primal reckoning.
Ascending and roasting on Mount Zeng,
flames spread below.
The White Tiger leads the chant ahead,
while the Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.
The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
its five-colored radiance flying and shining.
It encounters the cast net,
pressed down and unable to rise.
Its cries are mournful and grievous,
like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the boiling cauldron,
its feathers and wings are crushed and broken.
Before half the clepsydra has passed,
fish scales and manes arise.
Five hues dazzle and gleam,
transforming without constant master.
The seething cauldron boils and surges,
violently welling without cease.
Layer upon layer, piled and heaped,
like interlocking canine teeth.
Its form resembles midwinter ice,
with *langgan* jade exuding stalactites.
Towering and jumbled,
crossing and propping one another.
*Yin* and *yang* find their match,
growing faint yet holding fast.
The Green Dragon dwells in the sixth chamber of the Celestial House,
spring blossoms quake in the eastern *mao*.
The White Tiger resides in the seventh star of the Hairy Head,
autumn’s awns quiver in the western *you*.
The Vermilion Bird abides in the second star of the Spread,
the true yang mingles in the southern *wu*.
When these three come to court together,
their kin become intimate companions.
Originally but two things,
in the end they become three and five.
Three, five, and one together
all gather and return to two places.
Refine them as described above,
and the days’ reckoning also takes its measure.
First white, then yellow,
red and black penetrate inside and out.
This is called the First Cauldron,
its sustenance like a grain of millet.
It is the work of nature itself,
not some devious or false path.
Mountains and marshes’ qi steam together,
stirring clouds to become rain.
Mud dries and turns to dust,
fire extinguished transforms into earth.
Like *huangbo* dyed yellow,
or indigo woven into green silk.
Hide boiled into glue,
ferment and yeast brewed into wine.
Things of the same kind are easily worked,
while those of different stock are hard to craft.
Only this wondrous art,
examined closely, does not deceive.
Transmitted to a hundred million generations hence,
it will shine forth, self-evident and verifiable.
Brilliant as the Milky Way’s starry canon,
radiant as the sea’s watery source.
Ponder it, striving to make it familiar,
turning it over to examine above and below.
After a thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing,
after ten thousand repetitions, it will be visible.
The numinous may speak to a person,
or the heart’s spirit suddenly awaken on its own.
Probe the thread to find its strand,
and you will surely gain its gate and door.
Entering the Dao, there is no other way—
it is always transmitted to the worthy.

Commentary states: Master Shangyang said, “The Dao of the sages encompasses Heaven and Earth, and enters the tiniest speck of dust.” The tradition says, “Utmost vastness yet exhausting the subtle, extreme brilliance yet following the mean.” The Dao is Heaven’s secret treasure, not displayed on bamboo and silk, transmitted only mouth to mouth. The sages, having no other recourse, employ every kind of analogy to instruct later generations. The Yellow Emperor’s questioning of Qibo begins with, “For insufficiency of essence, supplement with flavor; for insufficiency of form, supplement with *qi*.” This single phrase fully reveals the Golden Elixir. When King Wen expanded upon the *Yi* of Fuxi, he said, “In the southwest, one gains companions”—this further reveals the method of supplementing *qi*. Confucius also said, “Like sounds resonate, like *qi* seek one another”—this again points to the class of supplementing *qi*. Laozi said, “The gate of the Mysterious Female is the root of Heaven and Earth”—this clarifies the gate of supplementing *qi*. The *Cantong Qi* explicitly instructs on medicine, cauldron, weights, and firing times, with admonitions like “the golden *qi* mutually assist, the true person hides in the deep abyss”—most clear and urgent. Later, through metaphors and comparisons, sage after sage transmitted it, their principles one and the same. Thus, the Great Elixir of the Ninefold Return of Golden Fluid is nothing but the supplementation of that single *qi*. Yet to supplement *yin*, one must use *yang*; to supplement *yang*, one must use *yin*—rooted in the *qi* of the Supreme Ultimate, borrowing the name of Golden Elixir. What is called *jin*? What is called *dan*? *Qian* begins with *jin*, *kun* begins with *dan*. *Qian*’s initial Supreme Ultimate: *jin* and *dan* in *kun*. *Kun*’s initial Supreme Ultimate: *qi* transforms into *dan*. *Qian*’s *jin* spreads through *kun*, flowing and turning in its course. *Jin* hides in *dui*; *dui*’s *jin* generates water; water’s beginning generates *dan*; *dan* dwells in the tiger’s pen—thus the tiger is born from water. The tiger resides in the west; if one wishes to conjoin *dan*, first subdue the dragon. The dragon’s home is wood, manifesting in *li*; *li* holds *yin* fire, so the dragon emerges from within fire. The dragon dwells in the eastern nine-*qi* azure heaven, the Green Emperor seals it as the true master, giving life to the myriad things. The tiger dwells in the western seven-*qi* white heaven, the White Emperor bellows it to complete transformation and produce the myriad things. From west to east, myriad miles stretch. Now the immortal elder uses “Heaven and Earth” to analogize *li* and *kan*; “golden cauldron” to compare the dark ravine; “River Drum” and “Star Marker” to signify union; “shadow’s reckoning” and “advance and retreat” to compare the *qian* dragon; “the August Sovereign’s gaze” to signify sudden awakening and clarity; “pivot” and “harmful *qi*” to compare gathering and sealing; “female and male” to indicate *zi* and *wu*; “emerging and entering” to indicate *yin* and *shen*. “Mount Zeng” is the gate of the dark and obscure; “the Beckoning Star” is the door of the indistinct and evanescent. The “White Tiger” is the thing of metal; the “Vermilion Bird” is the metal of fire. The “net” analogizes the initial step.

“The boiling cauldron” compares to the crucible and furnace;
“seething and surging” signify the abundance of *qi*;
“layer upon layer” suffices the medicine;
“coral and stalactite” are the incipient forms of the elixir;
“intermingling and interlocking” unite virtue with *yin* and *yang*;
“the Azure Dragon in Chamber” marks the completion of the chamber’s work;
“the White Tiger in Pleiades” signifies the return of the medicine to the furnace;
“the Vermilion Bird in Spread” shows the spirit already merged with *qi*;
“the two things” are lead and mercury;
“three and five” cluster the Five Phases;
“one” is the water of *kan*;
“two” is the furnace of *li*;
“first white then yellow” means white is metal, yellow is the earth’s form;
“red and black permeate inner and outer” means red is the aspect of fire, black is the body of lead.

When the Five Phases are complete and *yin* and *yang* unite, it is called “one crucible,” as small as a grain of millet. The scripture says, “The Primal Beginning suspends a single precious pearl, as large as a grain of millet, within the empty mystery”—this is it. “What is wrought by the natural” is all the *yin*-*yang* workings of creation, the Dao of spontaneous resonance. It is no deviant or false path, no heterodox arts of *cai-zhan* or left-handed sorcery.

“Mountain and marsh *qi* steam together” analogizes the golden elixir as *yin* and *yang* *qi* steaming to form it. “Mud dries and turns to dust” compares true *qi* entering the crucible and congealing into the elixir. Dyeing yellow with *huangbo* and green with indigo, boiling hide into glue and fermenting grain into wine—these analogize the attainment of golden liquid and the formation of the returning elixir.

“Work is easily applied among the same kind” means, for instance, *qian* takes *kun* as its kind, *kun* takes *dui* as its kind; thus *yin* and *yang* harmonize, and work is easily applied. “Without the proper seed, skill is hard to achieve” means, for example, *dui* takes *xun* as its seed, *yin* takes the female as its seed. If two women dwell together, how can they bring forth transformation? This is the subtlety of the art—clear, precise, and true, no deceptive words.

“Transmitted to the myriad ages hereafter” means this book and this Dao are like stars in the sky, visible to all; like water’s source in the sea, what divergent streams could there be? Though ten thousand myriad ages pass, none can depart from this Dao. Study it in detail, ponder it deeply, and after ten thousand repetitions, the divine and numinous will naturally reveal it to you, or the heart’s spirit will awaken on its own.

The sages and worthies composed their books so that the end echoes the beginning. The first chapter of the upper scroll of this book says, “*Qian* and *kun* are the gates and doors of the *Yi*,” and here at the final chapter it directly states, “Trace the thread to its origin, and you must find its gate and door”—this is called returning to the beginning from the end. The Dao of Heaven is impartial, ever transmitted to the worthy. Those who study the Dao should ponder this carefully.

**Chapter Thirty-Three: The Crucible’s Wondrous Use**
This chapter originally followed “Imitative Forms,” for the crucible is also an imitative form. Peng Zhenyi said its phrases and principles were interconnected, its words and lines fragmented, and placed it later—this was incorrect. What the immortals and sages have set forth has profound method and order; it cannot be lightly altered. Moreover, its lines all rhyme in three-character phrases, forming another structural pattern. Here, it is restored to its original position.

Round the three and five, a tenth of an inch—
The annotation states: This elaborates the purport of “three, five, one.” Throughout this book, “three and five” appear in:
Chapter Eleven: “Three and five are already harmonized”;
Chapter Twenty-Four: “Three, five, and one are the essence of Heaven and Earth”;
Chapter Twenty-Six: “If three and five do not interact, hardness and softness part ways”;
Chapter Thirty-Two: “Its root is but two things, its end is three and five.”
This chapter begins with “three, five, one” to make the purport of “three, five, one” thoroughly clear. Thus one knows the crucible possesses the wondrousness of “three and five,” the medicine has the authenticity of “one inch,” and the firing regimen precisely employs “one tenth.”

“Round” means mastery—if one can master and thoroughly comprehend the essentials of “three, five, one,” one may refine the great elixir. People of the world do not grasp this purport and merely cling to the crucible’s dimensions of inches and tenths—how shallow indeed! Confucius said, “Three and five transform, their numbers interwoven; penetrate their transformations, and you complete the patterns of Heaven and Earth; exhaust their numbers, and you fix the images of all under Heaven.”

*The Wuzhen Pian* says:
“Three, five, one—just three characters,
Rare indeed are those who have understood them through the ages.
East three and south two together make five,
North one and west four complete them.
*Wu* and *ji* naturally reside in the generative number five,
The three families meet and form the infant.
The infant is the one containing true *qi*;
Only those who comprehend may enter the sage’s mechanism.”

The numbers of *yin* and *yang* take *qi* as their master; the *qi* of the Five Phases arise from numbers. Thus the east’s blue *qi* is nine, the origin, *ren*, the virtue of wood’s generative number three—hard, essence. *The Ancient Text of the Dragon and Tiger Classic* says, “Transforming into the Azure Dragon,” the *yang* wood. The south’s red *qi* is two, *heng*, *li*, the virtue of fire’s generative number two—soft, blood. The classic says, “Cinnabar flows with mercury as father,” the *yin* fire; *yang* wood generates *yin* fire. *Li* is the *yang* within *yin*, the middle daughter, so *li*’s daughter takes *zhen* wood as father—wood is fire’s companion. Their generative numbers two and three together make one five, the mercury within cinnabar, the self, the crucible. Master Ziyang said, “The golden crucible desires to retain mercury within cinnabar”—this is it.

The west’s white *qi* is seven, *li*, *yi*, the virtue of metal’s generative number four—female, liquid. The classic says, “The female *yin* is ochre-yellow gold,” the *yin* metal. The north’s black *qi* is five, *zhen*, *zhi*, the virtue of water’s generative number one—male, *qi*. The classic says, “The male *yang* is jade-green water,” the *yang* water; *yin* metal generates *yang* water. *Kan* is the *yin* within *yang*, the middle son, so the son takes *dui* metal as mother—metal and water dwell together.

Their generative numbers one and four together make one five, the metal within water, the other, the vessel. Master Ziyang said, “The jade pool first descends silver within water”—this is it.

The central yellow *qi* is one, *ji*, spirit, the virtue of earth’s generative number five—*wu*, trust. Laozi said, “Vast and obscure, within it lies essence; its essence most true, within it lies trust”—this is it. *Wu* and *ji* unite to form the *gui*, the essence of two and five wondrously conjoined and coagulated—this is the coagulation of the golden elixir. This is called “three-five-one,” this is called the crucible-vessel.

“Three-five-one” sums to the number nine, returning to the original number nine of the east’s green *qi*—this is called the Great Elixir of Nine Returns. The mouth is four and eight, the two-inch lips. Annotation: Four and eight make twelve, plus two more, totaling fourteen. “Fourteen” is the first fullness of heaven’s moon, the moon’s fullness being pure *yang*; by its *yang* purity, it can then generate the single *yang*’s golden essence within the crucible.

Mouth and lips are the gateways where metal *qi* mutually awaits—this is called the crucible’s mouth, the vessel’s lips. This is called two sevens making fourteen, this is called the wondrous meaning of Seven Returns. Worldly people, not understanding the immortal elder’s subtle truths—hidden wonders within wonders, intentions beyond intention—seeing only the words “mouth” and “lips,” seek directly the crucible-vessel’s measurements. How would they know the Great Elixir of Golden Fluid takes heaven and earth as crucible-vessel? To measure the golden elixir’s crucible-vessel is to measure heaven and earth. Yet they know not with what ruler to measure heaven and earth, nor where to begin such measurement.

They know not that the alchemical method’s imagery takes heaven and earth as furnace, *yin* and *yang* as fire—this is called furnace-fire. Just as the human body is a small heaven and earth, taking the body as furnace, essence and *qi* as fire, it is not the furnace-fire and crucible-vessel of the five metals and eight stones.

Twelve inches in length, thickness and thinness balanced. Annotation: “Twelve inches” is the twelve months of a year; “length” is year after year having twelve months. “Thick” is excess; “thin” is insufficiency. Cultivators must know each year has twelve months, each month has the time when metal and water generate one another. If the crucible is too thick, there is the flaw of distant expectation; if too thin, the peril of weakness. “Balanced” is how to regulate and gather it. Regulation and gathering mean careful observation. Thus the ancient sages condensed the seventy-two seasonal markers of a year into a single day, each two-hour period having six markers, each marker having three *fu*, using only the swiftness of one *fu*—this is called “*fu*-marker.”

“Thickness and thinness balanced,” regulation and gathering not erring by a hair’s breadth—only then is one permitted to refine the Great Elixir. The belly is three, sitting and awaiting warmth. Annotation: “Belly” is the inner chamber of the elixir crucible; “three” is aligning with the moon’s light—specifically, the third day of the month. “Sitting” is waiting; “awaiting” is arrival; “warmth” is the stirring of *yang* *qi*.

What is meant by aligning with the moon’s light? Heaven’s moon is called “Great *Yin*,” and on the third day of each month, a single *yang*’s light first appears above *gengshen*, resembling the *Zhen* trigram. *Zhen* is slight *yang* riding two *yin*. The elixir crucible is the same. The human world’s crucible-vessel is called “Lesser *Yin*,” and on the evening of the third day of each month, a single *yang*’s *qi* arises in the region of *ren* and *gui*, resembling the *Fu* trigram. *Fu* is one *yang* concealed beneath five *yin*.

What is meant by “sitting and awaiting warmth”? When cultivators have obtained the crucible-vessel and encounter the evening of the third day, they must sit and await it, waiting for the fire *qi* to descend, neither cold nor parched but warm—this is when *yang* *qi* is about to stir, and one must swiftly refine the elixir. *Yin* is above, *yang* rushes below. Annotation: “*Yin*” is the water within the vessel; “*yang*” is the fire within the crucible.

Water above, fire below—water and fire achieve harmony; *yin* above, *yang* below—earth and heaven unite in *Tai*. As Master Ziyang says, “Though they take the lead, I remain the guest.” The beginning and end employ the martial, while the middle employs the civil. Seventy days at the start, thirty days at the close, totaling two hundred and six—all must be skillfully balanced.

Annotation: The initial phase uses martial fire, the time of refining the self; the final phase also uses martial fire, the days of gentle nurturing. In between, however, a single *fu*-cycle of civil fire is applied to refine the elixir. “Seventy at the start” refers to the most arduous work of accumulating merit; “thirty at the close” cautions that the nurturing phase must be especially guarded. Seventy plus thirty makes one hundred, added to two hundred and six totals three hundred and sixty, the cyclical number of four nines, completing a full revolution. Compared to three hundred and sixty days, seven-tenths of the time refines the self, while three-tenths nurtures. If one year is spent in nurturing, then three years must first refine the self. Only the civil fire for elixir-refining in the middle requires precisely half a *shi*-period, hence “skillfully balanced.” The half-*shi* *fu*-cycle of civil fire for elixir-refining is not included in the seventy, thirty, or two hundred and six—scholars must take note. The words “beginning,” “end,” “close,” and “start” exclude the civil fire in the middle, keeping it distinct.

People often misinterpret the seventy and thirty as three parts civil and seven parts martial, failing to grasp the hidden mechanism of elixir scriptures, which dare not speak plainly. If one fully comprehends that the moment of a single *fu*-cycle is the critical time for obtaining the elixir, then the civil fire in the middle will naturally become clear.

*Yin* fire is white; the yellow sprout is lead. Two sevens gather, aiding and sustaining the practitioner.
Annotation: Earth two generates fire, heaven seven completes cinnabar—this is the completion number of “*yin* fire,” the first seven. Heaven one generates water, earth six completes lead—this is the harmonizing number of the “yellow sprout,” the second seven. Combining the numbers of lead and fire yields “two sevens gathered.” Two sevens make fourteen, and when these fourteen of lead and fire meet within the crucible-vessel, their power aids and sustains the practitioner to form the elixir.

Nourish the brain’s marrow, stabilize the mysterious ascent. The child resides at the center, secure and preserved. Coming and going in roaming, yet never leaving the gate. Gradually growing great, nature and emotions purified. Returning to the One, restoring the original root. Cherish reverence like lord and minister. After one full cycle, the toil is intense. Guard closely, do not falter or grow confused. The path is distant, again profound and obscure. If one attains this, they will comprehend *Qian* and *Kun*.

The *dao*-spoon touches, purifying the hun and po. Attaining longevity, dwelling in the immortal village. Those who delight in the Dao seek its root. Examine the five phases, determine the precise weights. Reflect carefully—no need for further discourse. Deeply conceal and guard, do not transmit the text.

The annotation states: This passage is straightforward, describing those who have obtained the elixir—let them never grow idle or negligent, never stray even for a moment, but remain diligent and heedful. Each line is clear and requires no further explanation. Once the cinnabar is formed and the infant gradually matures, one may proceed to the nine-year work of higher attainment.

Riding a white crane, mounting scaled dragons,
Roaming the Great Void, paying homage to the Immortal Lords.
Inscribed in the celestial charts, named a Perfected One.

The annotation states: This describes the completion of the elixir, the fulfillment of the Dao, and the fruition of practice. Yet when virtue is profound and merit weighty, the signs of attainment cannot be fully recounted. For the supreme Dao is treasured by Heaven; those of superior roots and wisdom practice tirelessly, refining both nature and life, uniting form and spirit in wondrous harmony, merging with the Dao in truth, their virtue deep and merit high. Thus they are lauded in such terms, paying homage to the Immortal Lords and being named Perfected Ones. Every person may undertake this great merit, achieve this great freedom—do not abandon yourself because the task seems difficult, nor neglect cultivation because your conditions seem meager. Laozi, Zhang, and Ge were but men, not fallen from the heavens; Śākyamuni and Bodhidharma were but men, not risen from the earth. With steadfast heart and courage, all things become easily accomplished. Practitioners of resolve, reflect deeply and strive with effort.

**Chapter Thirty-Four: Mending Omissions and Filling Gaps**

The *Cantong Qi* presents an outline, yet it is not entirely unified, its discourse overflowing, its subtleties not fully expounded, its omissions and approximations left wanting. Now I have compiled and recorded this to mend its gaps, refine its obscurities, link its threads in succession, align its purport, and ensure its course remains unerring. Thus I have composed this, designating three corresponding categories, so that the essence and nature of the *Great Change* may be fully revealed.

*Yi* "floating right," *Ding* "civil fire," *Ji* "essence-metal," *Xin* "generation-silver," *Gui* "true lead"—five phases in harmonious accord.
Three woods, two fires, five earths, four metals, one water.
*Jia* "sinking left," *Bing* "martial fire," *Wu* "medicine," *Geng* "generation-gold," *Ren* "true mercury"—each has its proper union.

The nature and essence of the *Great Change* each conform to their measure. The teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, when examined, may be applied. The work of furnace and fire has its true basis. The three Ways emerge from one, all following the same path. Branches, stems, flowers, and leaves bear fruit in abundance, yet the root remains the source, never losing its original purity. What is spoken here is sincere, carefully considered, and without error.

Like the midwinter season, when bamboo and trees are all broken and harmed,
Assisting yang, the merchant travels are questioned; the lord deeply conceals himself.
Align with the seasons, follow the celestial rhythms, seal your mouth and speak not.

The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, the Great Mystery formless,
Empty and still, unseen, its vastness dissolving into nothingness.
Errors and mistakes lose the thread of affairs; words return to harm oneself.

Distinguish and arrange these four images to enlighten later generations, who are blind to them.

The annotation states: This chapter mends omissions and fills gaps, preserving oral instructions within, though they remain concealed. Those who annotate this should grasp the intent of "capturing the unicorn." Moreover, the text warns: "Seal your mouth and speak not," and again: "Words return to harm oneself." With a single stroke, both meanings are made clear—its significance is profound.

This scripture holds the power of great liberation and great spiritual penetration. If one hears this scripture, serpents and tigers cannot harm them; if one recites this scripture, plagues and dysentery dare not arise; if one comprehends this scripture, hell cannot seize or restrain them; if one practices this scripture, heaven’s halls bring natural joy. Wherever this scripture resides, golden light constantly crisscrosses the void, and empty space births whiteness. Should one witness this, their lifespan extends by six times six. Those who make offerings and faithfully receive it gain boundless merit—how much more so for those who steadfastly cultivate and diligently practice it?

**Chapter Thirty-Five: Self-Narrative to Introduce Later Sections**

A rustic from the outskirts of Kuaiji, a withered scholar from a secluded valley, I cling to simplicity and plainness, taking no delight in power or glory. Dwelling in obscurity and neglecting profit and fame, I hold fast to tranquility and seek peace in my time. Living in quietude, I have composed this text.

I sing of the *Great Change*, the legacy of the Three Sages, examining its purport to find a unified discourse. My aim is to align with principle and radiate the spirit. Through spiritual transformation and free circulation, the four seas attain peace. I set it forth as a calendar for all ages to follow, a guide for governance that is not cumbersome. It draws inward to nurture nature, embracing the naturalness of the Yellow and the Old. In the depth of one’s virtue, one returns to the root and reverts to the origin. It is near in my heart, not apart from my own body. Embracing the One without abandonment, one may endure forever. Paired with refined ingestion, the male and female are arrayed. Cast aside the cinnabar of Wudu and discard the eight minerals. Discerning their use, one completes things—what the world treasures. Three strands are arranged, their branches and stems interconnected. Though they emerge differently and bear different names, all stem from a single gate. This is not mere accumulation of phrases or harmonious parallelism; it contains truth, and its coarse elements may yet be observed. If I were to embellish falsehoods, I would only incur superfluous faults.

I entitle it *The Kinship of the Three*, glimpsing but its beginning. Its words are few, yet its meaning vast—later generations should revere it. Abandoning the times to avoid harm, I take refuge in the hills and mountains. Roaming the vast expanse, I dwell beside ghosts. Transforming my form into an immortal, I sink into silence and stillness. A hundred generations hence, I wander among humans, spreading my feathered wings to the east, west, south, and north.

When Tang faced dire straits, drought and flood divided the wells. The leaves of the boughs withered and yellowed, losing their flourishing splendor. The virtuous bear one another’s burdens—peace and stability enable long life.

The annotation states: Master Shangyang once more proclaimed this meaning and spoke this verse: *"Peace and stability enable long life," long life without kalpas of years. The great Dao is difficult to fathom; can the returning elixir change or shift? Fire arrays metal as its body, earth restrains water to form a circle. In the initial refinement, sixteen ounces are swallowed, ingesting the waxing and waning moon. Constantly paired with refined ingestion, one returns to the root and reverts to the origin. Plants and trees are not of the same kind—metals and stones are all discarded. Discerning their use, one peers into creation; the world treasures this lead. Through purity, one attains true cultivation; through diligence, one seeks the natural. The Supreme Sage treasures the *Golden Scripture*, accumulating merit and forming karmic bonds. Qi refines the Primordial Origin; the Most High commands the extension of essence. The blade is sharp, towering and lofty; Yu Di grasps the Supreme Mystery. The *Mud Pill* radiates divine brilliance, resplendent and soaring eightfold. The Great Canopy aligns with the Jade Capital; the cinnabar phoenix dances in flight. The *Cave Chapters* shake the Nine Capitals; ghosts and demons all confess their transgressions. Waving the branch, the sweet dew nectar flows; unfolding the discourse, one listens to the true explanation. The vast numen spreads the primordial *Brahma*; kalpa after kalpa, the Golden Mouth proclaims. Reciting it once in purification, accumulated ailments heal. Seven to nine recitations reverse the revolutions of heaven and earth. A hundred to a thousand recitations present one’s name before the Jade Emperor. Ten thousand recitations without ceasing give birth to golden lotuses in fire. Planting the name in the Formless Realm, it bestows upon you the crossing of the great thousand. Golden youths scatter celestial flowers; jade maidens hold jasper feasts. The divine wind resounds in the layered heavens; the *Brahma*-qi fills the field of mushrooms. The Five Elders inscribe the register; the Four Harmonies compare the imperial chapters. Radiant clouds shade the feathered canopy; the Grand Purity floats in purple mist. In the distant Dragon Han above, merit is weighed at the lustrous gem. Golden light blazes ten thousand fathoms, enduring for billions of kalpas. The Nine Yangs of the Divine Empyrean convene; the profound and wondrous Highest Immortals.
