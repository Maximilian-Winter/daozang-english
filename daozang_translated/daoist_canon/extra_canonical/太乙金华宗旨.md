**The Supreme Principles of the Golden Flower of the Great One**

**Chapter One: The Celestial Heart**

The natural is called the Dao. The Dao has no name or form—only singular nature, only the primordial spirit. Nature and life cannot be seen; they are lodged in celestial light. Celestial light cannot be seen; it is lodged in the two eyes. Since ancient times, the immortals and perfected ones have transmitted this orally, passing it from one to another. Since the Supreme Lord revealed the teachings, they were transmitted through Donghua to others, reaching the Northern and Southern Schools. The Complete Reality School flourished to its peak, yet its flourishing lay in its multitude of followers, while its decline stemmed from the loss of the heart-transmission. By today, it has become utterly diluted and degenerate! Degeneration has reached its extreme, and at the extreme, it must return. Thus, the Pure Brightness Patriarch Xu, in his compassion, universally delivered beings and established these principles of transmission beyond the teachings, guiding those of superior roots. Those who hear this meet an opportunity rare across kalpas; those who receive it encounter a dharma assembly of the moment. All should reverently embody Patriarch Xu’s苦心, establishing a firm foundation in the midst of human relations and daily life before cultivating the true and awakening to nature.

Now, as I presumptuously serve as your guide, I first elucidate *The Supreme Principles of the Golden Flower of the Great One*, then expound upon them in detail. The *Great One* refers to the supreme. The alchemical secrets all rely on effortful practice to attain effortlessness, yet this is not the principle of direct, single-leap entry. The transmitted principles directly elevate the work of nature, not falling into secondary methods—hence their subtlety.

The *Golden Flower* is light. What color is light? Drawing its image from the golden flower, it secretly contains the character of light within. This is the true *qi* of the primordial Great One, the singular essence of the watery lead. The practice of *returning the light* employs the method of reversal, directing contemplation toward the Celestial Heart. The Celestial Heart resides in the sun and moon of the eyes.

*The Yellow Court Scripture* states: *"A cun-field and chi-residence can nurture life."* The *chi-residence* is the face; the *cun-field* upon the face—what is this if not the Celestial Heart? Within this square inch lie the sublime realms of *Yulu Xiaotai* and the marvels of *Yujing Danque*, the abode of the spirit most empty and numinous. The Confucians call it *"the empty center"*; the Buddhists, *"the numinous terrace"*; the Daoists, *"the ancestral earth,"* *"the Yellow Court,"* *"the mysterious pass,"* *"the primordial aperture."* The Celestial Heart is like a dwelling, while light is its master. Thus, with a single return of the light, the *qi* of the entire body ascends in homage, like a sagely king establishing his capital and setting the axis—all bearing jade and silk come from the myriad states. Or like a master of keen discernment, where servants and maids naturally obey commands, each attending to their duties.

Disciples need only return the light—this is the supreme, wondrous recitation. Light is easily stirred but difficult to stabilize. After prolonged return, this light congeals, becoming the natural dharmakāya, and the spirit coalesces above the nine heavens. This is what *The Heart Seal Scripture* calls *"silent audience and ascension."* In practicing these principles, there is no other method of advancement—only pure contemplation of this.

*The Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: *"Pure contemplation leads to flight; one must be born in heaven."* Heaven is not the azure sky but being born in the body of the *Qian* palace. Over time, naturally, there arises a body beyond the body.

The Golden Flower is the Golden Elixir. The transformations of spirit and illumination depend entirely on the heart. Though this wondrous secret does not err by a hair’s breadth, it is profoundly dynamic. It demands both intelligence and tranquility—only those of extreme intelligence can practice it; only those of extreme stillness can preserve it.

**Chapter Two: The Primordial Spirit and the Conscious Spirit**

Heaven and Earth regard humans as mayflies; the Great Dao regards Heaven and Earth as bubbles. Only the primordial spirit and true nature transcend the primordial and ascend beyond. Their essence and *qi* perish with Heaven and Earth. Yet with the primordial spirit present, there is the Infinite. The generation of Heaven and Earth arises from this.

Disciples need only guard the primordial spirit to transcend life beyond yin and yang, outside the Three Realms. This is possible only through seeing nature—what is called the original face.

When a person enters the womb, the primordial spirit resides in the square inch, while the conscious spirit dwells in the lower heart. The lower heart of flesh and blood is shaped like a large peach, covered by the lungs, assisted by the liver, and supported by the large and small intestines. If one goes a day without eating, discomfort arises in the heart. Upon hearing a fright, it leaps; upon encountering anger, it stifles. Witnessing death brings sorrow; seeing beauty brings dizziness. Yet the Celestial Heart above the head never stirs in the slightest.

How could the Celestial Heart fail to move the true intention within the square inch? When it moves, it is not wondrous—yet it is most wondrous. For ordinary people, it moves only at death, which is inauspicious. Most wondrous is when the light has congealed into the dharmakāya, gradually becoming spiritually responsive and desiring to move—this is the untransmitted secret of ages.

The lower conscious heart is like a powerful warlord or fierce general, taking advantage of the sovereign’s dimness to seize control. Over time, the great sword is inverted. Now, by concentrating and guarding the primordial palace, it is as if a wise and enlightened ruler sits upon the throne. The two eyes returning the light are like loyal ministers assisting on the left. With internal governance pacified, naturally, all traitors lay down their weapons and beg for life.

In the Dao of the Elixir, essence-water, spirit-fire, and intention-earth are the supreme secrets. Essence-water is the true unity of primordial *qi*; spirit-fire is light; intention-earth is the Celestial Heart of the central palace. Spirit-fire is employed, intention-earth is the essence, and essence-water is the foundation.

Humans are born of intention, and the body is not merely seven feet. Within the body resides the *po*. The *po* acts through the conscious spirit, and the conscious spirit arises from the *po*. The *po* is yin, the substance of the conscious spirit. If the conscious spirit is not severed, through endless lives, the *po* transforms its form and alters its substance.

Only the *hun* is where the spirit is stored. By day, the *hun* lodges in the eyes; by night, it rests in the liver. Lodging in the eyes, it sees; resting in the liver, it dreams. Dreaming is the spirit’s journey—across the nine heavens and nine earths, traversed in an instant.

When awakened, one is plunged into profound obscurity, bound by form—bound, that is, by the *po*. Thus, turning the light inward refines the *hun*, preserves the spirit, subdues the *po*, and severs the conscious mind. The ancient method of transcending the world entails refining away all yin dregs to return to pure yang—nothing more than dissolving the *po* and perfecting the *hun*.

Turning the light inward is the secret to dissolving yin and restraining the *po*. Though it may not yet achieve the return to pure yang, the method of turning the light is itself the turning back, for light is yang, and to turn it is to return it. By abiding in this practice, essence-water naturally abounds, spirit-fire arises, intention-earth solidifies, and the sacred embryo may take form.

The dung beetle rolls its ball, and within the ball, white life emerges—such is the pure work of concentrated spirit. If even a ball of dung can nurture life to hatch from its shell, then how could the resting place of the Celestial Heart, where spirit is directed, fail to generate a body?

Once the single numinous nature descends into the Palace of Qian, it divides into *hun* and *po*. The *hun* resides in the Celestial Heart—yang, the light and clarity of illumination—born of the Great Void, sharing the same form as the Primordial Beginning. The *po* is yin, the heavy and turbid qi, clinging to the mundane heart of form. The *hun* delights in life, while the *po* longs for death. All desires for beauty and stirring of qi are the work of the *po*—the conscious spirit. After death, it feasts on blood offerings; in life, it suffers greatly, for yin returns to yin. Like attracts like.

When the practitioner refines away the yin *po*, they become pure yang.

**Chapter Three: Turning the Light Inward to Guard the Center**

Whence comes the name "turning the light inward"? It originates with the Perfected One of Wenshi. Turning the light inward condenses the qi of heaven and earth, yin and yang—this is what is meant by "pure thought," "pure qi," and "pure contemplation."

At first, practicing this method feels as if something exists within nothing. With time and mastery, a body arises beyond the body—nothing becomes as if something. After a hundred days of dedicated practice, the light becomes true, and only then is it spirit-fire. After a hundred days, a single point of true yang spontaneously arises within the light, like a millet pearl—just as conception occurs when husband and wife unite. One must then remain still and await it. The turning of the light is the fire-timing.

Within the primordial transformation, yang light presides as the sovereign. In the realm of form, it is the sun; in humans, it is the eyes. Nothing leaks the spirit-mind more readily than this. Thus, the Way of Golden Flower employs the method of reversal.

Turning the light inward does not mean merely returning the essence of one’s body; it is the return of the true qi of creation. It is not merely the cessation of momentary delusions but the emptying of kalpas of samsara. Therefore, one breath corresponds to a year in the human world, and one breath to a hundred years in the long night of the nine paths.

From the moment of birth, people follow circumstances and live in accord with them, never once turning their gaze inward. As yang qi wanes and perishes, they enter the realm of the nine darknesses. Thus, the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: "Pure thought ascends; pure emotion descends." Learners, with more emotion than thought, sink into lower realms. Only by observing the breath in stillness can true awakening arise—this is the method of reversal.

The *Classic of the Hidden Talisman* says: "The mechanism lies in the eyes." The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: "The essence of the human body all ascends and gathers in the empty orifices." Mastering this single point is where longevity and transcendence both lie. This is the practice that unifies the three teachings.

The light is neither within nor beyond the body. Mountains, rivers, the great earth, the illumination of sun and moon—all are this light, so it is not confined within the body. Wisdom, intelligence, all movement and transformation—none are apart from this light, so it is also beyond the body.

The light of heaven and earth fills the cosmos; the light of a single body likewise pervades the sky and covers the earth. Thus, when one turns the light inward, all—heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers—turns with it.

The essence of a person ascends and gathers in the eyes—this is the great pivot of the human body. Consider this: if one does not sit in stillness for even a day, where will this light flow and come to rest? But if one can sit in stillness for even a moment, the kalpas of birth and death are resolved from that point. All methods return to stillness—truly inconceivable, this wondrous path.

Yet in practice, one proceeds from shallow to deep, from coarse to refined, with unbroken continuity as the key. The work remains the same from beginning to end, though its warmth and coolness are known only to the practitioner. The goal is to return to the vastness of heaven and sea, where the ten thousand methods are as they are—only then is the method truly grasped.

The sages of past and present all transmitted this: it is nothing other than reflection. Confucius called it "extending knowledge," the Buddha "observing the mind," and Laozi "inner contemplation"—all refer to this method. Yet though everyone speaks of "reflection," few grasp it, for they do not understand its meaning.

"Reflection" means turning the mind of self-awareness back to the unmanifest origin of form and spirit. Within these six feet of ours, we return to seek the body of the ten heavens before their birth. Today, people sit in stillness for an hour or two, glance inward at their selfish thoughts, and call it "reflection"—how could they ever reach the end?

The patriarchs of Buddhism and Daoism taught people to "look at the tip of the nose," but this does not mean fixing the mind on the nose’s end, nor does it mean gazing at the nose while the mind rests in the central yellow. Where the eyes go, the mind follows—how can it be both above and below, now here and now there? These are all mistaken pointers for the moon.

What, then, is the true meaning? The phrase "tip of the nose" is most subtle—it merely uses the nose as a reference point for the eyes. It is not about the nose itself. If the eyes are opened too wide, they see far and miss the nose. If they are closed too tightly, they see nothing at all. Opening too wide scatters the mind outward; closing too tightly drives it inward into dullness.

Only when the eyelids are lowered to the proper degree—neither too open nor too closed—can the tip of the nose be seen just right, and thus it serves as the reference point. The key lies in lowering the lids to the exact middle, allowing the light to enter naturally without any effort to direct or withhold it. When observing the tip of the nose, merely glance at it once when first settling into stillness to set the reference, then let it go. Like a plasterer using a plumb line, once the line is hung at the start, the work proceeds accordingly—there is no need to keep staring at the line.

*Śamatha-vipaśyanā* is the Buddha’s teaching, and it is not secret. With both eyes gazing evenly at the tip of the nose, sit upright and settle the mind on the central point—not necessarily within the head, but simply where the two [eyes] align at their midpoint. Light is a living, vibrant thing; when the mind is fixed at the midpoint between the two [eyes], the light naturally enters without needing to focus on the central palace. These few words encompass the essential principle. For further details on entering and exiting stillness, one may consult the *Śamatha-vipaśyanā* texts for verification.

The term "central point" (*yuán zhōng*) is most subtle. The center is nowhere absent, pervading the great Dao in its entirety—here, it merely hints at the mechanism of creation, serving as the gateway to entry. "Central" (*yuán*) means taking this as the starting sign, not as a fixed attachment. The meaning of these two characters is profoundly alive and wondrous.

*Śamatha* and *vipaśyanā* are inseparable—they are *samādhi* and *prajñā*. Whenever a thought arises thereafter, do not remain seated as before. Instead, investigate where this thought arises, from where it originates, and where it ceases. Examine it repeatedly, and you will find it unattainable. This is seeing the arising of the thought—do not then seek its origin further, for the mind is unattainable. "I have pacified your mind for you"—this is true insight. The opposite of this is called false insight.

If, after such investigation, nothing is found, simply return to the continuous practice of *śamatha*, followed by *vipaśyanā*, and *vipaśyanā* followed by *śamatha*—this is the dual cultivation of *samādhi* and *prajñā*, known as "turning the light around." "Turning" (*huí*) is *śamatha*, and "light" (*guāng*) is *vipaśyanā*. *Śamatha* without *vipaśyanā* is having the turning but no light; *vipaśyanā* without *śamatha* is having the light but no turning. Take heed of this.

**Chapter Four: Turning the Light Around and Regulating the Breath**

The principle is simply to proceed with a pure mind, without seeking verification, for verification will come of its own accord. Generally, beginners’ afflictions boil down to two: dullness and distraction. To remedy these, there is no better method than entrusting the mind to the breath. The breath is one’s own mind—when the mind moves, qi arises, for qi is the transformation of the mind. Human thoughts are swift: in an instant, a single deluded thought corresponds to a single breath. Thus, inner and outer breathing follow one another like sound and echo. In a day, there are tens of thousands of breaths, and thus tens of thousands of deluded thoughts. When the spirit’s clarity is exhausted, one becomes like withered wood or dead ashes.

Yet can one be without thoughts? One cannot. Can one be without breath? One cannot. Better to turn the affliction into medicine—this is the interdependence of mind and breath. Therefore, "turning the light around" is combined with breath regulation, a method that fully employs the "ear’s light." There is the "eye’s light"—the external union of sun and moon—and the "ear’s light"—the internal union of sun and moon’s essence. Yet essence is merely where light congeals; they emerge from the same source but have different names. Thus, wisdom and clarity are but a single spiritual light.

When sitting, lower the eyelids, set the reference point, and then let go. If letting go entirely proves difficult, then focus the mind on listening to the breath. The breath’s inhalation and exhalation should not be audible to the ear; listen only for its soundlessness. If there is sound, it is coarse and cannot enter subtlety. Instead, patiently and gently refine it, making it increasingly subtle, and the subtler it becomes, the stiller it grows. Over time, the subtle breath will suddenly cease, and the true breath will appear—then the essence of the mind can be recognized.

For when the mind is refined, the breath is refined; when the mind is unified, qi moves. When the breath is refined, the mind is refined; when qi is unified, the mind moves. To stabilize the mind, one must first cultivate the heroic spirit, for the mind has no place to grasp—thus, one relies on qi as the starting sign, which is the guarding of pure qi. You may not understand the word "move" (*dòng*): it refers to being pulled by a thread, akin to the character "restrain" (*zhì*). If one can be made to move by rushing about, can one not also be made to rest through pure stillness? This is how the great sages, observing the interplay of mind and qi, devised expedient means to benefit later generations.

The alchemical texts say: "The hen can hatch eggs by constantly listening"—this is the essential secret. The hen’s ability to hatch eggs depends on warmth. Warmth can only heat the shell; it cannot enter the interior. Thus, the mind draws qi inward, and in listening, the mind is wholly focused. When the mind enters, qi enters, and with the warmth of qi, life is born. Even when the mother hen leaves the nest, she keeps her ear cocked, for her spirit remains undivided. Where the spirit is undivided, warmth persists day and night without interruption, and the spirit becomes alive.

When the spirit is alive, it is because the mind has first died. To "die the mind" does not mean withering it, but making it single-minded and undivided. The Buddha said: "Place the mind in one place, and nothing will be unaccomplished." The mind tends to wander, so refine it with qi; qi tends to coarsen, so refine it with the mind. How could there be no stability in this? Generally, the two afflictions of dullness and distraction can only be resolved through daily, uninterrupted practice of stillness, which will naturally lead to great rest. If one does not sit in stillness, even if distracted, one remains unaware. Once aware of distraction, this very awareness is the opportunity to dispel it.

Dullness one is unaware of and dullness one is aware of—how vastly different they are! Unaware dullness is true dullness. Aware dullness is not entirely dullness, for clarity is present within it.

Distraction is the spirit’s scattering; dullness is the spirit’s lack of clarity. Distraction is easier to remedy, while dullness is harder to cure. It is like illness: pain and itching can be treated with medicine, but dullness is the symptom of numbness and insensitivity. What is scattered can be gathered, what is chaotic can be ordered, but dullness is sluggish and obscure. In distraction, there is still some direction, but in dullness, the *po* soul dominates entirely. In distraction, the *hun* soul still lingers, but in dullness, pure yin prevails.

During stillness practice, if one drifts toward sleep, this is dullness. To counter dullness, focus on regulating the breath. The breath here refers to the inhalation and exhalation through the mouth and nose—though not the true breath, the true breath’s movement is also lodged within it. Whenever sitting, one must quiet the mind and refine the qi. How to quiet the mind? By attending to the breath. The breath’s coming and going is known only to the mind; it should not be audible to the ears. If inaudible, it becomes subtle; subtle, it becomes clear. If audible, the qi grows coarse; coarse, it becomes turbid; turbid, it leads to dullness and sleep—this is the natural principle.

Though the mind is directed toward the breath, one must skillfully apply this focus—it is a use that is no-use, requiring only a faint awareness. This phrase holds a subtle meaning. What is "illumination"? It is the eye’s light turning inward. The eyes should see inwardly, not outwardly; not seeing outwardly yet remaining alert is inward seeing—though not literally so. What is "listening"? It is the ear’s light turning inward. The ears should listen inwardly, not outwardly; not listening outwardly yet remaining alert is inward listening—though not literally so. To listen is to listen to silence; to see is to see formlessness. If the eyes do not look outward and the ears do not listen outward, they may turn inward and scatter. Only by inward seeing and inward listening can one avoid both outward scattering and inward dissipation, thus preventing dullness in the center—this is the union of sun and moon, the intermingling of their essences.

When dullness and sleepiness arise, rise and walk about until the spirit clears, then sit again. In the early morning, when time permits, sitting for the duration of one incense stick is ideal. After noon, worldly affairs multiply and dullness easily sets in, yet one need not rigidly adhere to one incense stick. As long as all conditions are set aside and one sits in stillness for a time, over time one will find entry and avoid falling into dullness and sleep.

**Chapter Five: Errors in Turning the Light Around**

As your practice gradually matures, though you may have reached the barren tree and rocky crag, mistakes remain plentiful. Here, I will offer detailed guidance. The subtleties of this matter can only be known once one has arrived; now, I may speak of them.

Our tradition differs from the Chan school in that it proceeds step by step with verification. Let me first explain the points of divergence, then the verifications.

When about to engage in the essential practice, I employ expedient means: do not overuse the mind, but allow it to be lively and free, so that qi harmonizes and the mind settles. Only then enter stillness. In stillness, one must grasp the opportunity and the key—do not sit in a state of emptiness, which is the blankness of unawareness. Amidst the release of all conditions, remain alert and self-possessed. Yet one must not rely on intention or enthusiasm, for excessive earnestness easily leads to this. It is not that earnestness is inappropriate, but the true subtlety lies in the realm of "as if present, as if absent"—it may be attained through a state of intentional non-intention.

Amidst alert clarity, release remains effortless. One must also avoid falling into the *skandha* realm, where the five aggregates become the workings of *māra*. Some enter samādhi with an excess of withered wood and dead ashes, lacking the vitality of spring across the great earth. This is falling into the yin realm: the qi grows cold, the breath sinks, and many signs of cold and decay appear. Over time, one becomes like wood or stone.

One must also avoid being carried away by the myriad conditions. Upon entering stillness, if various thoughts suddenly arise and cannot be dismissed, following them may feel agreeable—this is the master becoming enslaved. Over time, one falls into the realm of desire. The superior among these may be reborn in heaven, the inferior among foxes and spirits. Dwelling in famous mountains, they enjoy their own pleasures—wind and moon, flowers and fruits, jade trees and fragrant herbs—for three to five hundred years, even thousands, yet when their retribution ends, they are reborn among the various destinies. These are all erroneous paths.

Once the erroneous paths are known, one may seek verification.

**Chapter Six: Verifications of Turning the Light Around**

Verifications are many and cannot be undertaken by those of shallow roots or limited capacity; one must aspire to deliver all beings. Nor can they be undertaken with a careless or arrogant mind; one must approach these words with reverence.

In stillness, a continuous, unbroken flow arises, and the spirit becomes joyful and at ease, as if intoxicated or bathed—this is the body suffused with yang harmony, the first blossoming of the Golden Flower. Then, all sensations subside, and the bright moon hangs in the sky, revealing the entire world as a realm of light—this is the opening of the mind’s essence, the full radiance of the Golden Flower. Next, the body becomes replete and impervious to wind and frost; what others find dull, I encounter with heightened vitality. Golden halls rise, jade terraces stand; the decaying things of the world, when I breathe true qi upon them, instantly revive. Red blood transforms into milk, and this seven-foot frame of flesh becomes nothing but gold and treasure—this is the great congealing of the Golden Flower.

The first stage corresponds to the *Sutra on Visualizing the Buddha of Infinite Life*, which states: *"The withered great waters and the symbolic trees of the Dharma."* The setting sun begins from primordial chaos, the Wuji. The highest good is like water—clear and flawless—this is the sovereign of the Taiji, the Lord emerging from *Zhen*.

The *Zhen* trigram corresponds to wood, hence the symbolic representation of the rows of trees—seven tiers of trees for the seven apertures of radiant clarity. The northwest *Qian* direction, shifted one position, becomes *Kan*, symbolizing the withered great waters, an image of *Qian* and *Kan*. *Kan* governs the *Zi* direction; at the winter solstice, thunder lies hidden within the earth, rumbling faintly, until *Zhen* emerges as yang rises above the ground—this is the image of the rows of trees. The rest may be deduced by analogy.

The second stage begins here, as the great earth turns to ice, becoming a lapis lazuli jeweled ground where luminosity gradually congeals. Thus arises the lotus terrace, and from it, the Buddha—what else could this manifestation of golden nature be but the Buddha, the fully awakened Golden Immortal? This is the great verification of the process. Three verifiable signs may be observed in the present:

First, when seated, the spirit enters the valley; hearing others speak is like listening from a mile away, yet every word is distinctly clear, and their voices echo as if answering from within the valley. Though they are heard, I remain untouched by hearing—this is the spirit abiding in the valley, verifiable at any time.

Second, in stillness, the eyes radiate a brilliant light, filling all before them with whiteness, as if enveloped in clouds. Opening the eyes to seek the body, it cannot be found—this is the empty chamber generating brightness, inner and outer luminosity united, the auspiciousness of perfect stillness.

Third, in stillness, the flesh becomes fine and supple, like silk or jade, and in sitting, one feels unable to remain grounded, as if floating upward—this is the spirit returning to the crown of the head, and with time, ascension may be awaited at any moment.

These three are verifiable in the present. Yet the manifestations are inexhaustible, varying with each practitioner’s capacity, as the *Mohe Zhiguan* states: *"The arising of wholesome roots takes diverse forms."* This matter is like one who drinks water—cool or warm, only the drinker knows. One must trust oneself truly.

The primordial qi of pre-heaven is to be sought within present verification. Once this qi is attained, the elixir forms instantly—this is the single grain of true millet pearl. One grain upon another, from the subtle to the manifest.

There is the pre-heaven of the moment—a single grain—and the pre-heaven of the whole—a single grain extending to the boundless. Each grain possesses its own power; here, boldness is the foremost principle.

**Chapter Seven: The Method of Revolving the Light**

Revolve the light step by step, without neglecting one’s proper duties. As the ancients said: *"When affairs arise, respond to them; when things appear, recognize them."* Address matters with right mindfulness, and the light will not be swayed by external phenomena—the light will naturally return. This is the revolving of the light in formlessness, yet how much more so when the light is truly focused in form?

In daily life, maintain moment-to-moment reflection, free from the slightest trace of self or other—this is the revolving of the light in every circumstance, the foremost wondrous function. Rising early to dispel all entanglements and sitting in stillness for one or two hours is most excellent. In all dealings with affairs and people, employ the method of reflection, ensuring no interruption. Practicing thus for two or three months, the immortals of heaven will surely come to affirm it.

**Chapter Eight: The Carefree Formula**

The Jade Clarity left behind the carefree formula:
Four words—concentrate the spirit and enter the qi cavity.
In the sixth month, suddenly white snow flies;
At the third watch, the sun’s wheel blazes forth.
From the water, the *Xun* wind is blown aloft;
In the heavens, one roams and returns to feast on *Kun*’s virtue.
There is yet one phrase within the profound:
The land of Nothing-Whatsoever is the true dwelling.

A single regulated verse encompasses all mysteries. The essence of the great Dao lies in nothing other than *"non-doing while doing."* Only through non-doing does one avoid attachment to form and locality; only through non-doing while doing does one avoid falling into stagnant emptiness or dead void.

All functioning revolves around the center, yet the pivot lies entirely in the two eyes. The two eyes are the handle of the Dipper, governing the rotation of creation and the circulation of yin and yang. The great medicine is ever the water’s gold—namely, the lead of the watery realm.

The earlier discussion of revolving the light was guidance for beginners, turning the outer to master the inner, like the minister aiding the sovereign. This pertains to those of middle and lower capacity, who refine the lower two passes to penetrate the upper one. Now, as the threads become clearer and the mechanism more familiar, heaven does not withhold the Dao—it reveals the supreme principle. Guard this well, guard this well! Exert yourselves, exert yourselves!

Revolving the light is but a general term. With each advance in practice, the light’s brilliance intensifies, and the method of return becomes ever more wondrous. Previously, the outer was used to master the inner; now, one resides at the center to govern the outer. Previously, the minister aided the sovereign; now, the sovereign is served and proclaimed—what a complete reversal!

When entering stillness, first harmonize body and mind, attaining ease and tranquility. Release all entanglements, clinging to nothing. The celestial mind is rightly positioned in the hands. Then, lower the eyelids as if receiving a sacred decree to summon a great minister—who would dare disobey?

Next, with the two eyes, inwardly illuminate the *Kan* palace. Where the light reaches, true yang emerges in response. *Li* outwardly is yang but inwardly yin—this is the *Qian* body. When a single yin enters to become the master, it follows things and generates the mind, flowing outward in endless cycles. Now, with the revolving light inwardly illuminating, one does not follow things to generate the mind. Yin qi halts, and as the light radiates, pure yang arises. Like attracts like, so *Kan*’s yang ascends—not *Kan*’s yang, but *Qian*’s yang responding to *Qian*’s yang.

When the two meet, they intertwine inseparably, vibrantly active, now appearing, now vanishing, now floating, now sinking. Within one’s original palace, it seems as vast as the infinite void, the body light and wondrous, ready to ascend—this is the clouds filling the dry mountains.

Next, the coming and going leave no trace, floating and sinking are indistinguishable, the pulse stills, and qi halts—this is the true union, the moon cradling ten thousand waters.

When in profound stillness, the celestial mind stirs—this is the return of the solitary yang, the living *zi* hour. Yet this subtle movement must be explained in detail.

For ordinary people, every glance and every listening causes the ears and eyes to chase after things, ceasing only when the object departs. In such motion and stillness, the common folk prevail, while the celestial sovereign is enslaved by them—this is dwelling among ghosts. Now, however, every motion and stillness resides with the person, and the celestial sovereign becomes a true person. When it moves, one moves with it—this is the Celestial Root; when it stills, one stills with it—this is the Moon Grotto. Stillness and motion arise without origin, and one follows them without origin; rest and activity rise and fall, and one follows them in their rising and falling—this is the Celestial Root and Moon Grotto idly coming and going.

When the celestial mind is serene, to move against its timing is to err by immaturity; when the celestial mind has already stirred, to move in response afterward is to err by lateness. The moment the celestial mind stirs, one must ascend with true intention to the *Qian* palace, guiding with the spirit-light gazing at the crown—this is movement in timely response.

Once the celestial mind ascends to the *Qian* crown, it roams freely and at ease. Should it suddenly incline toward stillness, swiftly draw it with true intention into the Yellow Court, directing the gaze of the eyes to the central Yellow Spirit Chamber. Then, as the inclination toward stillness arises, not a single thought stirs. In gazing inward, one suddenly forgets the gaze itself. At this moment, body and mind undergo a great release, all conditions vanish without trace, and even the crucible and furnace of one’s spirit-chamber seem nowhere to be found. Seeking one’s own body, it is utterly unattainable—this is the moment when heaven enters earth, when the myriad wonders return to the root, the very instant of "congealing spirit into the qi cavern."

In one turning of the light: at first, the scattered seeks to gather, the six senses cease functioning—this is nurturing the original source, adding oil to sustain life. Then, the gathered naturally drifts in ease, without expending the slightest effort—this is settling the spirit in the ancestral aperture, drawing together the primordial. Finally, echoes and reflections vanish entirely, and profound stillness prevails—this is hibernating in the qi cavern, the myriad wonders returning to the root.

Within one stage lie three stages; within one stage lie nine stages—all to be elaborated later. Now, taking one stage as comprising three: when nurturing begins in initial stillness, gathering is also nurturing, hibernation is also nurturing, and in the end, nurturing becomes hibernation. The middle layer may be inferred by analogy, where distinctions arise without altering the essence—this is the formless aperture, where a thousand places are one place. Distinctions arise without altering the timing—this is the timeless moment, an instant spanning kalpas and eons.

The human heart cannot stir without extreme stillness. To stir while forgetting the stirring is not the stirring of the original substance. Thus it is said: "Moved by things, it stirs—this is the desire of nature." If it stirs not by things but of itself, this is the stirring of heaven. To know that stirring by things is the desire of nature, while stirring not by things but of itself is the stirring of heaven—if one does not oppose heaven’s stirring with heaven’s nature, the phrase falls into speaking of "desire," for desire lies in the presence of things. This is thought stepping beyond its proper place, movement within movement.

When not a single thought arises, the correct thought is born—this is true intention. Within profound stillness, the celestial mechanism suddenly stirs—is this not movement without intention? Action without acting—this is that intention.

The first two lines of the poem encapsulate the workings of Golden Flower. The next two express the mutual embodiment of sun and moon: the sixth month is the fire of *Li*, the flying white snow is the true yin within *Li* about to return to *Kun*. The third watch is the water of *Kan*, the solar orb is the solitary yang within *Kan* about to blaze forth and return to *Qian*. The extraction of *Kan* to fill *Li* is contained therein.

The following two lines describe the Dipper’s handle in operation, the full mechanism of ascent and descent—is not the water within *Kan*? The eyes are the wind of *Xun*; the gaze of the eyes enters the *Kan* palace to summon the essence of the great yang. The heavens above are the *Qian* palace; "roaming and returning to feast on *Kun*’s virtue" is the spirit entering and illuminating the center, heaven entering earth, nurturing the fire.

The final two lines point to the supreme secret within the secret, the secret within the supreme secret—from beginning to end, it cannot be parted from, what is called "washing the heart and cleansing the thoughts," the bathing. The sagely learning begins with knowing where to halt and ends with halting at perfection, commencing from the limitless and returning to the limitless.

Buddhism takes "arising mind without abiding" as the great essence of its treasury of teachings. Our Dao takes the two words "attaining emptiness" to complete the full work of nature and life. In sum, the three teachings reduce to a single phrase: the divine elixir for emerging from death and entering life.

What is the "divine elixir"? Simply "no mind in all circumstances."

The most arcane aspect of our Dao is bathing. The entire work of this text can be resolved in two words: "heart empty." Now, with a single word, the secret is revealed, sparing decades of seeking.

You disciples fail to understand that within one stage lie three stages. I compare it to Buddhism’s three contemplations: emptiness, provisional existence, and the mean. First is the contemplation of emptiness, seeing all things as empty. Next is the contemplation of provisional existence: though knowing their emptiness, one does not destroy the myriad things but establishes all affairs within emptiness. Then, neither destroying the myriad things nor attaching to them—this is the contemplation of the mean.

When practicing the contemplation of emptiness, one also knows the myriad things cannot be destroyed and yet does not attach to them—this encompasses all three contemplations. Yet ultimately, seeing emptiness is the most powerful, so one practices the contemplation of emptiness. In emptiness, emptiness is indeed empty, provisional existence is also empty, and the mean is also empty. In practicing the contemplation of provisional existence, one relies more on the power of the preceding stage: provisional existence is indeed provisional, emptiness is also provisional, and the mean is also provisional. In the mean, one also conceives of emptiness, yet it is not called emptiness but the mean.

Yet when practicing the contemplation of provisional existence, it is not called provisional but the mean—while as for the mean, there is no need to speak further.

Though I sometimes speak of *li* alone and sometimes of *kan* in conjunction, I have never altered a single word. When I open my mouth to say it, the pivot lies entirely in the two eyes. This "pivot" is function—function that steers and turns the transformations of creation, not that creation is confined to this alone.

The six roots and seven apertures are all treasuries of radiant light; why single out the two eyes while ignoring the rest? One employs the yang of *kan* while still using the light of *li* to illumine and gather—this makes it clear.

Master Zhu’s teacher, whose name was Yuan-yu, once said: “A blind man cannot cultivate the Dao, but a deaf man may.” This accords with my own words, differing only in emphasizing the primary and secondary.

The sun and moon are originally one thing. What is called the dark place at the center is the true essence of the moon; the moon’s cavern is not in the moon but in the sun—what is called the moon’s cavern. Otherwise, one could simply say “moon” and be done. The white place within the moon is the true light of the sun; the sun’s light is instead in the moon—what is called the root of heaven. Otherwise, one could simply say “heaven” and be done.

Sun and moon, when separated, are only half; when united, they form a complete whole. Like a husband and wife: living apart, they do not make a household; only when man and woman are together is a family complete. Yet things are poor metaphors for the Dao. Husband and wife, when apart, remain two people; sun and moon, when apart, do not form a complete whole.

Understand this, and the ears and eyes are likewise. I say that a blind man has no ears, and a deaf man has no eyes. Seen thus, what need is there to speak of one thing, or two eyes, or six resentments? The six roots are one root. What need to speak of seven apertures? The seven apertures are one aperture. My words merely reveal their interconnectedness, so that duality is not perceived. You disciples cling to their separateness, and so everywhere you replace your eyes.

**Chapter Nine: A Hundred Days of Foundation-Laying**
The *Xinyin Jing* says: “When wind is turned back and blended, the hundred-day work is efficacious.” In sum, one must establish the foundation for a hundred days before true light appears. You disciples still possess only the light of the eyes—this is neither the fire of spirit, nor the light of nature, nor the torch of wisdom.

After a hundred days of turning back, essence and qi naturally become full, true yang naturally arises, and true fire naturally exists within water. Proceeding with this, union occurs naturally, the embryo forms naturally, and I remain in the heaven of unknowing—while the infant is spontaneously perfected. If one harbors even the slightest intention, it is heterodox.

A hundred days of foundation-laying—yet it is not merely a hundred days.

**One Day of Foundation-Laying**
One day of foundation-laying—yet it is not merely a day. One breath of foundation-laying—yet it is not the breath of inhalation and exhalation. The breath is the heart itself; when the heart becomes breath, it is primordial spirit, primordial qi, primordial essence. Rising and falling, parting and uniting—all arise from the heart. Being and non-being, emptiness and fullness—all reside within thought. One breath, one life-sustaining hold—how could it be limited to a hundred days? Yet a hundred days is also but a single breath. The hundred days lie solely in gaining power: if power is gained by day, it is received by night; if power is gained by night, it is received by day. The hundred days of foundation-laying are but a jade decree. The words of perfected beings invariably resonate with the human body. The words of true teachers invariably resonate with the learner. This is the mystery within mystery—what cannot be explained. Only upon seeing one’s nature does one understand. Thus, learners must seek a true teacher to transmit the record, allowing their nature to unfold freely, each manifestation verified without fail.

**Chapter Ten: The Light of Nature and the Light of Discernment**
The method of turning the light inward originally pervades movement, stillness, sitting, and reclining—it depends solely on grasping the mechanism. I have previously instructed: *“In an empty chamber, light arises of itself.”* This light is not external. However, there is one point to note: before the light is seen, its appearance serves as verification. If one sees it as light and clings to it with intention, one falls into the realm of discriminative thought—this is not the light of nature. Disciples, pay no heed to whether there is light or not; simply ensure that no thought arises from thought.

What is “no thought”? It is attained where all ceases, where all is settled.
What is “arising thought”? One thought, one life-sustaining hold—this thought is the correct thought, unlike the thoughts of ordinary days. The present mind is thought; thought is the present mind. This mind is both light and elixir.

When ordinary people see objects, their eyes perceive without discrimination—this is the light of nature, like a mirror reflecting without intent, like water reflecting without intent. After a moment, it becomes the “light of discernment,” for it begins to discriminate. When a mirror holds an image, the mirror is no longer a mirror; when water holds a reflection, the water is no longer water. When light is accompanied by discernment, what light remains?

At first, disciples possess the light of nature, but with the turning of thought, it becomes discernment. Once discernment arises, the light vanishes without a trace—not that the light is absent, but that the light has become discernment. The Yellow Emperor said: *“Sound does not generate sound but generates echo.”* This is the same principle. *The Śūraṅgama’s Investigative Entry* states: *“Not in dust, not in discernment—only select the root.”* What does this mean?

Dust is the external world, the so-called realm of objects, which has no connection to us. To pursue it is to mistake objects for oneself. Objects must return: the penetrating returns to doors and windows, brightness returns to the sun and moon. Borrowing them as one’s own, they are never truly ours. As for that which does not return to you—if not yours, then whose? Brightness returns to the sun and moon, but the luminosity of the sun and moon does not return. The heavens may lack sun and moon at times, but humans never lack the nature to see sun and moon. If so, then the discernment of sun and moon—can it truly be considered ours? Those who distinguish between brightness and darkness—when brightness and darkness are both forgotten, where does discernment reside? Thus, even this returns. This is the inner dust.

Only the seeing of nature does not return. When one sees the act of seeing, seeing is no longer seeing—then even the seeing of nature returns. What returns is the seeing of nature in the flow of discriminative thought, which is what Ānanda meant by *“the fault lies in your mind and eyes, causing you to wander.”* Initially, when entering the discernment of returning and distinguishing, the first seven all demonstrate that each returns. Thus, the seeing of nature is retained as Ānanda’s staff. Ultimately, even the seeing of nature is entwined with the eight consciousnesses (eye-consciousness, ear-consciousness, nose-consciousness, tongue-consciousness, body-consciousness, mind-consciousness, transmitting consciousness, and storehouse consciousness)—it is not truly non-returning. Only when even this is broken through does one attain the true seeing of nature, the true non-returning.

Disciples, in turning the light inward, you are precisely turning toward the light of the original non-returning. Thus, not a trace of discernment is to be employed. What causes you to wander is only these six roots; what enables you to attain bodhi is also only these six roots. Yet neither dust nor discernment is used—it is not the roots that are used, but the nature within the roots.

If you turn the light inward without falling into discernment, you employ the primordial nature within the roots. If you turn the light inward while falling into discernment, you employ the discerning nature within the roots. The distinction lies within a hair’s breadth. Employing the mind is the light of discernment; letting go is the light of nature. A hair’s breadth spans a thousand miles—this must not be confused.

If discernment is not severed, spirit does not arise. If the mind is not empty, the elixir does not form. When the mind is pure, the elixir is present; when the mind is empty, the medicine is present. Not attaching to a single thing is called “mind purity”; not retaining a single thing is called “mind emptiness.” To see emptiness as empty is still not true emptiness. To forget even emptiness—this is called true emptiness.

**Chapter Eleven: The Union of Kan and Li**
All leakage of essence and spirit, all movement that engages with objects—this is Li. All gathering and turning of spirit and discernment, all stillness that inwardly contains—this is Kan. That which flows outward through the seven apertures is Li; that which returns inward through the seven apertures is Kan. One yin governs the pursuit of forms and sounds; one yang governs the return of hearing and sight. Kan and Li are yin and yang; yin and yang are nature and life; nature and life are body and mind; body and mind are spirit illumination.

Once one restrains and ceases the outflow of essence and spirit, not allowing them to wander with external conditions—that is true union. And in silent cross-legged sitting, there is no need to speak of it further.

**Chapter Twelve: The Celestial Cycle**
The celestial cycle is not governed by qi but by the arrival of the mind as its wondrous secret. If one insists on how the celestial cycle should be, this is forced growth. Guard without intention; move without purpose.

Gazing up at the heavens, the three hundred and sixty-five degrees are in constant flux, yet the handle of the Dipper remains eternally unmoving. The heart is the same. The heart is the turning mechanism; qi is the multitude of stars.

The qi of this body—its four limbs and hundred parts—is originally interconnected; one must not exert excessive force. In this refining, recognize the spirit of consciousness and sever deluded perceptions. Only then does the medicine arise. The medicine is not a tangible thing; it is the radiance of inherent nature, the true qi of prior heaven. Yet it appears only after great stillness, and there is no method of gathering—those who speak of gathering are gravely mistaken. With prolonged perception, the mind-ground becomes luminous, naturally emptying all leaks and liberating one from the sea of dust. If today it is dragon and tiger, tomorrow water and fire, it remains mere delusion.

As I once received from the mouth of the True One of Fire Dragon: I know not how the alchemical texts describe it differently. A day has one celestial cycle; a moment has one celestial cycle. Where Kan and Li unite, there is one cycle. My union is the turning of heaven itself. Unable to rest in the immediate, there are times of union and times of non-union. Yet heaven’s revolution never ceases for even a moment. If yin and yang harmoniously unite, the great earth is bathed in yang warmth, my central palace is rightly positioned, and all things flourish at once—this is the alchemical method of bathing. What else could it be but the great celestial cycle?

Within this, the firing times truly differ in magnitude, yet ultimately no distinction of great or small remains. When skill becomes natural, one no longer knows what Kan and Li are, nor what heaven and earth are—what is union, what is one or two cycles, where to seek the difference between great and small? In sum, the revolving of the entire body, though appearing vast, is small. Yet in a single revolution, heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things all revolve with it, and even within the square inch of the heart, it is vast.

The firing times of the golden elixir must return to spontaneity. Without spontaneity, heaven remains heaven, the ten thousand things remain the ten thousand things. To force their union is to fail in union. For instance, when the heavens are parched and yin and yang disharmonious, though Qian and Kun never cease their daily revolution, there remains much that is unnatural. If I can revolve yin and yang, adjusting them to spontaneity, clouds gather and rain falls, grasses and trees thrive, mountains and rivers flow freely. Even if there is discord, it dissipates at once—this is the great celestial cycle.

As for the wondrousness of the living midnight hour, to fixate on the exact midnight hour is to cling to form. Without clinging to form, one does not point to the exact midnight hour. How then to recognize the living midnight hour? Once recognized, there is indeed an exact midnight hour—are the two one or distinct? Neither exact nor living, one must perceive it truly. When true, all is exact, all is living. Without true perception, what is exact? What is living?

For example, the living midnight hour is what one perceives at all times. Yet when it arrives at the exact midnight hour, with will and qi clear and bright, the living midnight hour becomes even more manifest. Those who have not clearly recognized the living hour seek verification only in the exact hour. When the exact hour appears, the living hour is nothing short of wondrous.

**Chapter Thirteen: Song of Exhortation to the World**
I, burning with the heat of the elixir for the world’s deliverance,
Spare not my compassion nor my loquacity.
The World-Honored One, too, acted for the great causal condition,
Directly pointing to birth and death—how lamentable!
The Old Lord, too, fretted over this body of mine,
Transmitting the Valley Spirit, unrecognized by men.
Now I briefly speak the path to seeking the true:
The Yellow Center penetrates the principle, bearing the Great Change,
Rightly positioned within the body is the mysterious pass.
Between zi and wu, one may settle the breath,
Light returns to the ancestral aperture, the ten thousand spirits at peace.
The medicine arises from the rivers and plains, a single qi emerging,
Piercing the curtain, transforming with golden radiance.
A red sun ever blazing—
Yet people mistake it for the essence of Kan and Li.
Moving heart and kidney creates separation—
How can one speak of harmonizing with heaven’s heart?
If heaven accords, the Dao naturally accords.
Lay down the ten thousand conditions, not a single thought arising.
This is the true Wuji of prior heaven,
The Great Void, silent and vast, its signs concealed.
At the gate of life and destiny, forget consciousness;
When consciousness is forgotten, the original true appears.
Water clear, the pearl manifests—profound and unfathomable,
The hindrances of beginningless kalpas suddenly empty.
From the Jade Capital descends the Nine Dragons’ Register,
Now ascending the Cloud Han, mounting the celestial pass,
Wielding thunder, driving lightning.
Concentrating spirit and settling breath is the initial mechanism,
Retreating to the secret ground is constant quiescence.

I once delivered two lyrics to Zhang Zhennu—both contain the great Dao.
The hours after zi and before wu are not the time—it is Kan and Li.
Settling the breath means each breath returning to the root, the Yellow Center.
Sitting means the heart unmoving.
The spine’s path is not the wheel on the back—
It is the direct thoroughfare to the Jade Capital.
The double pass—here there is that which is hard to speak.
When the earth’s thunder shakes and mountain rain falls—true qi is born.
When the yellow sprout emerges from the soil—the medicine is born.
These small two sections encompass the great path of cultivation.
Understanding this, one will not be confused by others’ words.

Long ago, the Master and Yanzi ascended the summit of Mount Tai,
Gazing toward the White Horse Gate of Wu.
Yanzi saw it as a bolt of silk;
The Master quickly covered his eyes,
Fearing he had overused his vision, causing the spirit-light to scatter.
How can one not strive to return the light?
Returning the light lies in pure-hearted practice,
Simply gathering the true breath to illumine the central palace.
With time, it naturally becomes spiritually efficacious and transformative.
In sum: stilling the heart to fix the illumination is the foundation;
Forgetting the heart and congealing qi is the effect;
Qi settling and heart emptying is elixir completion;
Heart and qi merging as one is the nurturing;
Illuminating the heart and seeing nature is the completion of the Dao.

You disciples must each strive to practice.
To waste time is lamentable.
A day without practice is a day as a ghost.
A single breath in this practice is a single breath as a true immortal.
Strive! Strive!
