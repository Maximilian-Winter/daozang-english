**The Purple Clarity’s Pointers to the Mysteries**
*By Bai Yuchan of the Song Dynasty*

**On Revealing the Mysteries of the Mysterious Pass**

A single word or half a phrase may unlock the profound,
What need for alchemical texts by the thousands?
If one is not burdened by the form,
Before one’s eyes lies the Great Heavenly Net.

To refine the form and refine the spirit,
One must first know the return to the root and the restoration of life.
Thus it is said:
The return to the root has its own aperture,
The restoration of life seeks its own pass.
If one truly knows this pass and aperture,
What difficulty is there in returning to the root and restoring life?

Therefore:
The Void gives rise to the spontaneous,
The spontaneous gives rise to the Great Dao,
The Great Dao gives rise to the One Qi,
The One Qi divides into yin and yang,
Yin and yang become heaven and earth,
Heaven and earth give birth to the myriad things—
This is the root of creation.
It is the true One Qi, prior to all phenomena.

Vast and boundless, empty and formless,
Dim and obscure, beyond measure by inches,
Vast and unbounded, beyond the reach of shores,
Its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior.
It encompasses heaven and earth,
Yet enters the tip of a hair.
Above, no further color; below, no further abyss.
One thing, perfectly complete,
Manifest for a thousand ages,
Yet unnameable—
The sage aligns the heart with it,
And, compelled, names it the *Dao*.

From this, know that the heart *is* the Dao.
Thus, without heart, one merges with the Dao;
With heart, one strays from it.
Only this word *wu* ("without")
Embraces all existence without remainder,
Gives birth to the myriad things without exhaustion.

Though heaven and earth are vast,
They can command the formed,
But not the formless.
Though yin and yang are subtle,
They can command the qi with form,
But not the qi without form.
Though the Five Phases are most refined,
They can command the numbered,
But not the unnumbered.
Though a hundred thoughts arise in profusion,
They can command the conscious,
But not the unconscious.

For those who cultivate this principle,
It is better first to refine the form.
The marvel of refining the form lies in concentrating the spirit.
When the spirit is concentrated, qi gathers;
When qi gathers, the elixir forms;
When the elixir forms, the form is stabilized;
When the form is stabilized, the spirit is whole.

Thus, Master Tan said:
Forget the form to nurture qi,
Forget qi to nurture the spirit,
Forget the spirit to nurture the Void.
This single word *wang* ("forgetting")
Is to be without thing.

Originally, there was not a single thing—
Where could dust alight?
Is this not what is meant?

If one can savor this principle
And work on this single word *wang* ("forgetting"),
One may enter the subtleties of the Great Dao,
Seize the marvelous workings of spontaneity,
Establish the foundation of the elixir in an instant,
And circulate creation within the body.

Yet this Dao, when seen, is desolate and nothing is perceived;
When heard, it is obscure and nothing is heard.
Only when viewed with the heart is there image,
Only when listened to with the heart is there sound.
If the cultivator of the Dao
Stills the heart and concentrates the spirit,
Attains emptiness and maintains tranquility,
Then the empty chamber generates brightness—
Truly, this is spontaneity.

Only the Most High saves beings,
Teaching people to cultivate and refine,
Using heaven and earth as the crucible,
The sun and moon as the medicinal substances.
The rising and setting of the sun’s essence correspond to the ascent and descent of qi and blood;
The waxing and waning of the moon’s spirit correspond to the flourishing and decline of essence and spirit.
The seasons of the four quarters correspond to the hours of a single day;
The stars of the celestial circuit correspond to the transformations within the furnace.

Thus, gather essence and spirit as the medicine,
Take stillness and concentration as the fire.
With the fire of stillness and concentration,
Refine the medicine of essence and spirit—
Then the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor is formed.

For the union of true yin and true yang,
The pairing of one water and one fire,
First distinguish the floating and sinking,
Then clarify host and guest,
Discern the workings of withdrawal and addition,
Examine the safety and danger of reversal and repetition.

As Gao Xiangxian said:
Gathering has its time,
Taking has its day.

As Liu Haichan said:
The power of creation lies in opening and closing heaven and earth,
Tempering a furnace of true sun and moon.

Those who awaken to this
Emulate the workings of the sun and moon,
And share the same merit as heaven and earth.

Who knows that heaven nurtures without image,
Earth nurtures without form?
Thus, heaven is enduring and earth is lasting,
The sunlight and moonlight are bright,
The true One is ever-present,
And the Void is imperishable.

Now, I model myself after them:
No affairs for the heart,
No heart for affairs.
Inwardly observe the heart—
The heart has no heart.
Outwardly observe the form—
The form has no form.
Observe things afar—
Things have no things.
Know the heart is without heart,
Know the form is without form,
Know things are without things.
Transcend the myriad illusions,
And abide in solitary numinosity.

The ancient scripture says:
It gives me life in the Void,
Places me in the Nothing.

Thus, one should return to the primordial root of nature,
Revert to the state before birth.
Hide the heart within the heart, yet it is not seen;
Hide the spirit within the spirit, yet it does not emerge.

Therefore, one can
Unite the three times in perfect communion,
Settle the myriad conditions into stillness,
Purify the six senses,
And make the square inch of the heart empty and luminous.
Not clinging to emptiness,
Not clinging to nothingness,
Emptying all that is empty,
Eliminating all that is nothing,
Until emptiness is empty of emptiness,
And nothingness is nothing of nothingness—
Pure, bare, naked, and unadorned,
Then the numinous alone remains.

The Dao does not desire emptiness,
Yet emptiness naturally returns to it.
If one can empty the heart,
The Dao naturally returns to one.

The Dao originally has no name.
It cannot be grasped when near,
Nor abandoned when distant.
It is neither square nor round,
Neither inside nor outside—
Only the sage knows it.

The three poisons have no root,
The six desires have no seed.
Suddenly awakening to this principle,
One returns to the Void.

Laozi said:
Between heaven and earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
Empty yet inexhaustible,
The more it moves, the more it produces.

If one can, in the midst of stillness and concentration,
Embrace the qi of harmonious balance,
Guard the essence of the true One,
Then one seals the furnace and secures the firing times.

Fire originally belongs to the *Li* trigram of the south,
Which pertains to the heart.
The heart is spirit,
Spirit is fire,
Qi is the medicine.
To refine the medicine with fire and form the elixir
Is to guide qi with spirit and accomplish the Dao.

One who can grasp the sun and moon in hand and hold the primordial chaos in heart will naturally witness the bellows’ opening and closing, the river chariot’s ascent and descent. Water irrigates the Palace of Destiny, fire nourishes the Elixir Terrace; metal and wood merge, water and earth harmonize. The maiden rides the dragon, the old man strides the tiger; reversing through the Three Passes, ascending to the Inner Court, they transform into liquid mercury. Descending into the Tower of Nine Stories, at its center lies a cavity called the Elixir Terrace, where lead and mercury unite, water and fire converge. The moment intent arises, it is as if seal and contract align.

Spontaneously, without prior agreement, movement arises from stillness, action from non-action. At this time, white snow blankets the sky, yellow sprouts cover the earth; dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows. The jade crucible simmers, the golden furnace blazes; thunder rumbles and lightning flashes, shaking heaven and earth. The hundred meridians bristle, the Three Passes become transparent; the mysterious pearl takes form, the Great One returns to truth. Wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace; smoke warms the Elixir Field, waves settle in the Valley Sea. Refining the returning elixir is as easy as turning a hand. After seven returns and nine refinements, the great medicine is complete. Day by day, hour by hour, through nine cycles, the celestial gate and earthly axis lie within one’s grasp.

As the scripture says: *"If one can remain perpetually pure, heaven and earth all return."* Then the Three Flowers gather at the crown, the Five Qi converge at the origin—one may enter the gate of myriad wonders, the mystery within mystery.

Further, by day wielding the spirit banner and by night nurturing the fire mushroom, warming and nourishing the sacred embryo, one gives birth to the crimson child. When the embryo is shed and the spirit transformed, reversing yang and renewing the bones, this is preserving the spirit with the jade talisman and refining the form with golden liquid. Form and spirit both perfected, one merges with the Dao in truth.

Zhang Ping Shu said: *"All this takes but a moment’s effort, yet secures boundless ease and joy."* Truly so!

For the foundation of the Dao lies in virtue’s root, the origin of dragon and tiger, the ancestor of lead and mercury, the convergence of the Three Fires, the return of the Eight Waters, the gate where ten thousand spirits gather, the source of the golden elixir’s wondrous workings—this is the pivotal aperture of returning to the root and restoring life. Knowing this, desires need not be banished, for the heart grows still of itself; the heart need not be clarified, for the spirit becomes clear on its own. With no thought arising, all illusions subside. The body rides the whirlwind, the spirit roams the vast expanse—only then does one realize that the clear wind and bright moon all reveal the mechanism of lead and mercury, while the green waters and blue mountains fully disclose the essence of dragon and tiger.

Hainan’s White Jade Shan, from youth, studied the elixir method under his late master Chen Niyuan. Each year at the winter solstice noon, he would open *Qian*, close *Xun*, retain *Kun*, and block *Gen*; aligning with the celestial pivot, grasping the Dipper’s handle, he would pay homage to the Yellow Emperor, pass through Fusang, enter the Broad Cold, face the Quail’s Tail, raise the Yellow Bell, sail the sea raft, ascend Kunlun, wear the Tang talisman, shake the heavenly thunder, wander Wu Mountain, summon the Yellow Lad, call the Vermilion Child, and gather the green dragon’s liver, the white tiger’s marrow, the red phoenix’s blood, and the black tortoise’s essence. Placing these in the earthen crucible, he would kindle the Sparkling Deluder, command the Fire Star, transmute them into cinnabar, open the Flowery Pond, sip the spirit water, drink the knife-point dose—proceeding from non-being to being, from formlessness to form, drawing lead and adding mercury, coalescing the sacred embryo. After ten months, when qi is full and form is complete, a body exists beyond the body—this is the embryonic immortal.

The secret states: *"With undivided focus, one may concentrate the spirit; with an ashen heart in profound stillness, the golden elixir forms within."* Such was my attainment.

Shi Jianwu’s poem says:
*"Qi is the medicine that adds years,
The heart commands the qi’s spirit.
Knowing the master of qi’s movement,
One becomes an immortal."*

This poem is concise and luminous, penetrating the mysterious and attaining the wondrous. I carry and recite it, naturally arriving at the place where the autumn moon graces the sky and emptiness dissolves—none but those of withered wood and cold springs can comprehend this. Having gained this, I dare not remain silent.

The *Supreme Mystery Canon* states: *"To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the heavenly Dao; to transmit to the unworthy is to lose the heavenly treasure."* Though I have searched to the ends of the earth, I have found no one to whom I may lightly pass this, fearing celestial retribution. Deeply concerned that the great Dao may go untransmitted and the elixir method fade into obscurity, I have composed the *Revealing the Secret of the Mysterious Pass*. This is to enlighten this age and instruct future learners, preserving the golden elixir’s thread of transmission.

Yet fearing that people may still be ignorant of this principle, I shall further explain: use the eye to see the eye, the ear to hear the ear, the nose to regulate the nose, the mouth to seal the mouth. Concealment and flight both originate in the single heart. First, one must practice stillness and concentrate the spirit, restrain anger and suppress desires. Restraining anger and suppressing desires, water and fire achieve balance; water and fire in balance, metal and wood merge; metal and wood merged, the true earth returns to its place; the true earth in place, the golden elixir naturally grows to the size of a millet grain. Day by day, one grain at a time, the spirit returns and qi is restored, filling heaven and earth.

Mencius said, *"I am skilled at nourishing my vast and flowing qi."* This is it. When the liver’s qi is complete, there is benevolence; when the lung’s qi is complete, there is righteousness; when the heart’s qi is complete, there is propriety; when the kidney’s qi is complete, there is wisdom; when the spleen’s qi is complete, there is trust. If one’s endowment of qi is insufficient, one lacks benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust—how can one be called human? One who can condense emptiness and nourish the vast, whose heart is broad and body at ease, whose qi mother is formed, will find the elixir easily coalesced. Should one not cherish this cultivation to preserve one’s primordial essence?

Let the learner reflect on this!

**Discourse on Resolving Doubts in Immortal Cultivation**

Bai Yuchan of Hainan, having served Master Chen Niyan from youth, suddenly realized nine years had passed. One evening, beneath the pines in a secluded ravine, the wind was clear and the moon bright, the night still and the air crisp. Reflecting on the great matter of life and death and the swiftness of impermanence, he bowed twice and asked: *"Though Yuchan has not followed you long, I dare ask—given my meager blessings and shallow karmic roots, is there a share for me to attain immortality in this life?"*

Chen Niyan replied: *"Every person may do so—how much more so for you?"*

Yuchan said: *"Not fearing to overstep your authority, I venture this presumptuous question: How many paths are there to immortal cultivation? How many methods exist for elixir refinement? My understanding remains as undifferentiated as jade and stone—pray, grant me a single word of enlightenment."*

Chen Niyan said: *"Come, and I will tell you. There are three ranks of immortal cultivation and three grades of elixir refinement.*

*The Dao of Heavenly Immortals enables transformation and ascension. Superior practitioners may study it. They take the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire. In a single moment, the elixir may coalesce; in ten months, the embryo forms. This is the highest-grade method of elixir refinement—it has no hexagrams or trigrams, nor measures of weight. Its method is simple and direct, thus transmitted mind-to-mind, and most easily accomplished.*

*The Dao of Water Immortals enables concealment and manifestation. Middling practitioners may study it. They take qi as lead, spirit as mercury, noon as fire, and midnight as water. In a hundred days, the elements may merge; in three years, the image takes form. This is the middle-grade method of elixir refinement—though it has hexagrams and trigrams, it has no measures of weight. Its method is subtle and wondrous, thus transmitted orally, and surely attainable.*

*The Dao of Earthly Immortals enables the preservation of form in the world. Common practitioners may study it. They take essence as lead, blood as mercury, the kidneys as water, and the heart as fire. In a year, the elements may fuse; in nine years, success is achieved. This is the lowest-grade method of elixir refinement—it has both hexagrams and trigrams, as well as measures of weight. Its method is cumbersome and difficult, thus transmitted through texts, and rarely accomplished.*

*The highest-grade elixir method takes spirit, soul, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent as medicinal ingredients; movement, stillness, sitting, and lying as firing times; and purity and naturalness as its application.*

*The middle-grade elixir method takes the heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys as medicinal ingredients; years, months, days, and hours as firing times; and embracing the One and guarding unity as its application.*

*The lowest-grade elixir method takes essence, blood, marrow, qi, and fluids as medicinal ingredients; swallowing, guiding, and massaging as firing times; and visualization of ascent and descent as its application.*

*In essence, the marvel does not lie in following diagrams like seeking a steed. Those who cling to images and texts, arrogant and empty, will reach old age without accomplishment."*

Yuchan said: *"For many years, I have read elixir scriptures as if walking through thorns. Today, the dust is cleared, the mirror bright, clouds part and the moon shines—all myriad methods return to the One, all illusions encompass the True. But I still do not know where to begin the work."*

Chen Niyan said: *"Excellent question! The essentials of elixir refinement are these: Take the body as the altar, furnace, tripod, and stove; the heart as the chamber of spirit. Upright sitting and cultivating stillness are the gathering of ingredients; maintaining awareness and vigilance are the firing process. Action and cessation are advance and retreat; interruption and distraction are the embankments. Application is the drawing and adding; the steaming of true qi is the bathing. Cessation of thought is nurturing the fire; subduing body and mind is the field battle. Gathering spirit and qi is defending the city; forgetting scheming and cutting off deliberation are life and death. The movement of thought is the Mysterious Female; forging into a single mass is the union. Returning to the root and restoring life is the elixir’s completion; shifting spirit is the changing of the tripod. Having a body beyond the body is the shedding of the embryo; returning to the origin and reverting to the source is true emptiness. Shattering emptiness is the ultimate attainment. Thus, when gathered, it forms a body; when dispersed, it becomes qi—coming and going without obstruction, carefree and natural."*

Yuchan said: *"Diligent but unmet, one must meet a perfected being; met but undiligent, one ends as a lowly ghost."*

How does one verify the efficacy of this method of elixir refinement? Chen Niujiu states: *"At the outset of elixir cultivation, the spirit becomes clear and qi invigorated, body and mind harmonious and at ease. Chronic ailments vanish entirely, and one no longer suffers from dreamlike confusion. After a hundred days, one may cease eating, and wine no longer intoxicates. At this stage, red blood is transmuted into white, yin qi is forged into yang qi. The body grows fiery hot, and one’s steps become as swift as flight. Mercury may be dried in the mouth, and exhaled breath can warm the viscera. Confronted with external phenomena, the mind remains unmoved, utterly still. One may command ghosts and spirits, summon thunder and rain, hear the Nine Heavens, and see ten thousand miles. The entire body becomes pure yang, with sinews of gold and bones of jade. The yang spirit manifests its form, coming and going naturally—this is the culmination of the Dao of immortality and deathlessness.*

*Yet I fear that worldly practitioners cling to notions of medicinal substances and firing times, mistaking them for tangible, deliberate acts, and thus fail to attain sudden enlightenment. How could they know that before the primordial chaos divided, where were the years, months, days, and hours? Before one’s parents were born, where were essence, blood, qi, and fluids? The Dao is originally formless—it is metaphorically called dragon and tiger. The Dao is originally nameless—it is analogized as lead and mercury. Those who aspire to become celestial immortals must achieve perfection in both form and spirit, merging with the Dao in truth. How can one remain bound by yin and yang within the Five Phases? One must leap beyond heaven and earth to be called a true adept of the Dao."*

Someone may object: *"This method resembles Chan practice."* Yet they fail to realize that endless discourse and questioning merely produce dry wisdom, while years of stagnant sitting in dullness yield only illusory emptiness. The study of celestial immortality is like a pearl in a crystal dish—spinning brilliantly, vibrantly alive, naturally round and luminous. This is what is meant by celestial immortals, who are in truth golden immortals. Such ineffable subtlety—who understands it? Who practices it? There is but one Dao in the world, and sages have but one mind. How much more so for all beings, each inherently complete?

As the saying goes: *"Wherever green willows grow, one may tether a horse; every household’s gate opens onto Chang’an."* I speak only of the swiftest path.

Yuchan said: *"Those who study immortality in the world are many, yet most fail because they study but never meet a true master, or meet one but do not practice, or practice but do not persevere. In the end, they resign themselves to death in the Nine Springs—how tragic! Now, I shall carve my master’s oral teachings into wood and transmit them to the world. This divulges the celestial mechanism to an extreme degree—will there be no retribution?"*

Niujiu replied: *"I shall enlighten all under heaven into immortals. If I incur blame, would Heaven not be Heaven?"* The scripture says: *"My life rests with me, not with Heaven."* What retribution could there be?

Yuchan asked: *"Our patriarch Zhang Pingshu transmitted the teachings to unworthy recipients three times and suffered calamities thrice—why?"*

Niujiu answered: *"At that time, he lacked discernment, and his intentions were not universally compassionate!"*

Alas! The master may be at the edge of the sky, the disciple at the corner of the sea—how much harder is it to recognize one another amid worldly toils? Now, I publish this text to circulate throughout the world, so that those who cultivate immortality may seek meaning in its words and perceive the wondrous principle clearly. This is the gift of Heaven—what need is there for transmission through brush and tongue?

Simply abide in serene stillness, where thought is no-thought. When practice becomes pure and coalesces into oneness, one remains silent all day, like a hen brooding over her eggs. Then spirit returns and qi is restored, and the Mysterious Pass naturally reveals itself—a cavity vast without exterior, minute without interior. This is the gathering of primordial qi, the mother of the golden elixir. Practice diligently, and soon you may ride alongside Zhong and Lü!

These are the proven effects of my own experience. For those who study immortality without guidance, I have carefully compiled the essentials of these questions and answers, entitling it *On Resolving Doubts in Immortality Cultivation*.

**On Nature and Life as the Sun and Moon**

Nature and life within humans are like the sun and moon in the heavens. When the sun and moon conjoin, there is perpetual brightness; when nature and life unite, there is longevity. Life arises with form, while nature resides beyond form. The spirits of the Five Viscera constitute life, bound by the Seven Emotions—none of which fail to harm our impartial Dao. Nature is bestowed by Heaven, the foundation of impartiality. Thus, nature aligns with Heaven’s Dao, while life aligns with human desires. When life merges with nature, they interact to form the elixir; when the elixir transforms into spirit, one does not die.

The sun wields the light of Qian’s power, manifesting externally. The moon embodies Kun yet employs Qian, receiving yang. At the conjunction of the dark and new moons, the sun’s essence enters the moon’s spirit, and the moon’s spirit receives the sun’s soul. Yin and yang intermingle to give birth to spirit and illumination. Thus, Laozi spoke of *"emerging into life and entering death."* Of the thirteen companions of life, thirteen are companions of death. This refers to the moon’s third day, when the sun rises and brightness is born, growing until the fifteenth day. From the sixteenth day, the sun sets and brightness wanes, dying until the twenty-eighth day.

The sun and moon correspond to the hexagrams Kan and Li. Kan is yin externally and yang internally, where Qian’s *nine in use* returns to the center. Li is yang externally and yin internally, where Kun’s *six in use* returns to the center. The two functions of Qian and Kun having returned to Kan and Li, these two hexagrams thus act as proxies for Qian and Kun’s Dao.

Within a single month, six hexagrams manifest, casting their images in the heavens. On the third day, one yang arises below, and the hexagram Zhen appears. On the eighth day, two yangs arise below, and the hexagram Dui appears. On the fifteenth day, three yangs are complete, and Qian first emerges—this is Qian seeking Kun, and the yang path advancing. On the sixteenth day, one yin arises below, and the hexagram Xun appears. On the twenty-third day, two yins arise below, and the hexagram Gen appears. On the thirtieth day, three yins are complete, and Kun first emerges—this is Kun seeking Qian, and the yin path advancing.

Heaven and Earth circulate the Dao of yin and yang through Kan and Li, revolving and transforming endlessly. Thus Wei Boyang called the sun and moon the *Yi*, and Lu Deming likewise adopted this meaning in his exegetical gloss of the term *Zhouyi*.

I humbly suggest: in Heaven, it is *ming*—*ming* being the horizontal union of sun and moon; in the world, it is *yi*—*yi* being the vertical union of sun and moon; in man, it is the *elixir*—the elixir being the layered union of sun and moon. The sun and moon within man reside in the heart and kidneys. When the qi of heart and kidneys intermingle, water and fire ascend and descend, circulating without end, one then sees that one’s body is equal to Heaven and Earth, jointly governing creation, and no longer subject to creation.

**Discourse on the Indestructibility of the Valley Spirit**
The *valley* is the celestial valley. The *spirit* is the primordial spirit of the body. The valley of Heaven contains creation and embraces emptiness; the valley of Earth holds the myriad things and bears mountains and rivers. Man, sharing the same endowment as Heaven and Earth, also possesses a valley. This valley stores the True One and houses the primordial spirit. Thus the head contains nine palaces, corresponding above to the nine heavens. The central palace is called the *Mud Pill*, also known as the *Yellow Court*, *Kunlun*, or *Celestial Valley*—its names are many. It is the palace where the primordial spirit dwells, its emptiness like a valley, and the spirit resides within it, hence the term *valley spirit*. When the spirit abides, there is life; when the spirit departs, there is death. By day, it engages with things; by night, it engages with dreams—the spirit cannot rest in its dwelling.

Before the millet is cooked, before the awakening from the Southern Branch dream—all the glory and humiliation, wealth and nobility of a lifetime, all the sorrows, worries, joys, and pleasures of a hundred years—are fully experienced within a single dream. Should one depart and not return, wander and not come back, then the paths of life and death are sundered, and the ways of the hidden and the manifest are cut off.

From this, we see that man cannot give life to himself; it is the spirit that gives him life. Man cannot bring death upon himself; it is the spirit that brings him death. If the spirit abides in its valley and does not die, how can man die? Yet the reason the valley spirit does not die lies in the *Mysterious Female*. *Xuan* is yang, Heaven; *pin* is yin, Earth. Thus, the two qi of the Mysterious Female each hold profound meanings, which cannot be known unless one encounters a perfected being who imparts the oral instructions.

The *Yellow Emperor’s Inner Canon* states: *"The Celestial Valley’s primordial spirit, when guarded, remains true."* It speaks of the human body: above lies the Celestial Valley, the Mud Pill, the palace that stores the spirit; in the center lies the Crimson Palace, the valley that stores qi; below lies the Spirit Valley, the Pass of Origin, the palace that stores essence. The Celestial Valley is the Mysterious Palace, the chamber of the primordial spirit, the dwelling of the numinous nature—this is the essence of the spirit.

The sage models the essence of Heaven and Earth, knows the source of transformation, guards the spirit in the Mysterious Palace, and lets qi rise in the Female Treasury. When spirit and qi interact, they naturally become true, unite with the Dao, and enter the state of neither death nor life. Thus it is said: *"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female."*

The sage operates within the Mysterious Female, creating and transforming within the indistinct and vague. When the qi of the Mysterious Female enters its root, closing too tightly leads to urgency, while yielding leads to dissipation. One must ensure it flows continuously, without interruption. If one abides by it, following its natural course, the spirit will naturally settle, the breath will naturally stabilize, and one’s nature will merge with spontaneity, employing the wondrous function of non-action without ever reaching strain or coercion. Thus it is said: *"Its use is not strenuous."*

From this perspective, the Mysterious Female is the dual source of above and below, the proper path of the Mother of Qi’s ascent and descent. Yet worldly people, failing to fathom its root or investigate its source, take the nose as *xuan* and the mouth as *pin*. If the nose and mouth were the Mysterious Female, then what would be called the Gate of the Mysterious Female? These are all those who cannot attain its subtlety—how could anyone but the greatest sages fully comprehend this principle?

**On the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang**
The Qian Dao is light and pure, residing above; the Kun Dao is heavy and turbid, residing below. The primordial qi circulates ceaselessly between them. Above, yang is employed: after the winter solstice, the qi of the single yang ascends from Earth, accumulating for one hundred and eighty days until it reaches Heaven, where yang culminates and yin arises. Below, yin is employed: accumulating for one hundred and eighty days until it reaches Earth, where yin culminates and yang arises. One ascends, one descends—endlessly coming and going.

Man, receiving the harmonious qi, is born between Heaven and Earth, no different in essence from them. The qi of Heaven and Earth completes one cycle in a year; the qi of the human body completes one cycle in a day. From *zi* to *si*, it is the time of yang’s ascent—thus *zi* is the winter solstice of the day, corresponding to *Fu* in the *Book of Changes*. From *wu* to *hai*, it is the time of yin’s descent—thus *wu* is the summer solstice of the day, corresponding to *Gou* in the *Book of Changes*. Yin culminates and yang arises; yang culminates and yin arises. Day and night alternate, just like the ascent and descent of Heaven and Earth.

If one can emulate the bellows of Heaven and Earth, remaining empty, tranquil, and still, with a single qi circulating through the hundred bones—opening, qi issues forth like Earth’s qi ascending; closing, qi enters like Heaven’s qi descending—then one may attain the same longevity as Heaven and Earth. But if one rushes through the realm of splendor or gallops through the arena of right and wrong, true qi will dissipate and no longer belong to oneself. It is better to guard emptiness and stillness at the center to nurture it.

The center is where the qi of Heaven and Earth’s Mysterious Female converges. If one can focus the mind and guard it without scattering, true essence will naturally rise, primordial qi will naturally gather, the valley spirit will naturally dwell, the Three Corpses will depart, and the Nine Worms will perish—this is the Way of long life and enduring vision.

From this, we know that true breath and primordial qi are the root of human life and destiny. Deep roots and firm stems are the Way of long life and enduring vision. Man’s life is endowed with the primordial qi of the Great Dao. In the mother’s womb, he shares her breath; after birth, the umbilical cord is cut, and a single spark of primordial yang resides in the Cinnabar Field. His breath enters and exits, connecting to the Celestial Gate, joining with Heaven—above, it enters the Mud Pill, nourishing the primordial spirit; below, it enters the Cinnabar Field, connecting to the primordial qi.

Zhuangzi said: *"The breath of the multitude reaches the throat; the breath of the sage reaches the heels."* The heels—this is the Way of deep roots and firm stems. If one can cast aside all thoughts, true breath will naturally stabilize, the body will merge with formlessness, unite with the Dao, and live long in the world.

From this, we see: is the Dao within the body not revered? Is it not precious?

**The Crane Grove’s Inquiry on the Dao**
When Bai Yuchan of Hainan passed through the Three Mountains and stayed at the residence of the Purple Void Perfected, Peng Si of the Crane Grove visited and asked about the essentials of the Daoist arts. He said: "I have long studied the principles of the great elixir of golden cinnabar—terms like sun and moon, dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, Kan and Li, fire times, celestial cycles, and hexagram images, as well as the crescent moon furnace and cinnabar tripod—names vary, and matters are manifold. I wonder: is it one thing with many names, or many names for separate things? If sought within, it is formless; if sought without, it has form. Some say its wonder lies in action, others in stillness and quiescence. The ancients said: *'If there is action, it is not the Dao,'* and also: *'Drowning in stillness is but withered sitting.'*"

Perplexed, he knew not the path to enter or the inner sanctum to reach, and so entreated an explanation.

The master replied: "The sages of old gazed upon the patterns of heaven and examined the principles of earth, drawing near to the body and far to all things, thereby establishing the formulas of the elixir with the intent of attaining longevity and deathlessness, to refine the human heart—yet in truth, it is but one principle. At the outset of entry, it lies in yin and yang and the Five Phases; at the ultimate attainment, it returns to the undifferentiated and boundless. As spoken in the elixir arts, all has its basis, yet each school sets forth its own doctrine, each clinging to its own view. Thus, the many cannot be made uniform; it depends on what one encounters, what one transmits, and what one attains.

In heaven, it is the sun, moon, and stars; on earth, it is birds, beasts, grasses, and trees; in man, it is husband and wife, male and female. In terms of the Dao of the *Yijing*, it is Qian and Kun, Kan and Li; in terms of the Five Movements, it is metal, wood, water, and fire; in terms of medicinal substances, it is lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury; in terms of the elixir path, it is dragon and tiger, crow and hare. When employed, it bears names such as altars, furnaces, tripods, and stoves; when practiced, it manifests as ascent and descent, union and convergence; when embodied, it undergoes transformations of floating and sinking, clarity and turbidity; when observed, it reveals the signs of yin and yang, cold and heat.

Thus, the sages said: *Gather the medicinal substances, refine them with fire times, congeal them into the elixir, and transcend the mundane to enter sagehood.* Therefore, one takes from within yet does not cling to inner forms, takes from without yet does not seek external things—this is what is called *without thing, without image.* It is called the primordial qi, the undifferentiated and supreme essence, vast and beyond comprehension—this is the meaning of *spirit.*

Its substance may gather or disperse like light mist or thin fog; its image may appear or vanish like dreams, illusions, bubbles, or shadows. Heaven and earth share the same root with me; the myriad things share the same body with me. From past to present, there is fundamentally no formation or destruction—only the flux of birth and death, the arising and ceasing of deluded thoughts, like fleeting clouds dotting the vast clarity, like a dark wind obscuring the bright moon.

The sages, pitying the world’s decadence, instructed people in cultivation: to proceed from nonbeing into being is called *completion*; to return from being to nonbeing is called *fulfillment.* The essentials of its application lie in this: the movement of movement arises from non-movement; the action of action arises from non-action. It is nothing more than refining essence into qi, refining qi into spirit, and refining spirit to merge with the Dao.

If there seems to be activity, there is in truth no activity; if it appears to be quiescent concentration, it is not mere quiescent concentration. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, like a hen brooding her eggs—it may be grasped without intent, not fabricated with intent; it may be guarded with intent, not labored over with the heart. This is the essential of elixir refinement, the mystery of entering the Dao."

He further asked: "Of old, those who entered the Dao took the regulation of the heart as essential and the refinement of thought as sublime. Yet refined thought is but the preservation of念, and regulating the heart is but grasping and seizing. If念 is preserved for long, it may err; if the heart is grasped too tightly, it becomes harder to regulate. Some say念 should not be preserved for long, and the heart should not be grasped too tightly. I humbly submit: if念 is not preserved for long, it will not be genuine; if the heart is not grasped tightly, how can it be regulated?"

The master replied: "Preservation is being; loss is nonbeing. To preserve is to preserve one’s spirit; to conceive is to conceive one’s body. Closing the eyes to see one’s own eyes, gathering the heart to see one’s own heart—if there is a thing, it may be preserved, and this is called *true conception*; if there is no thing yet one forcibly preserves it, this is called *deluded conception.* This is the subtlety of refined thought and preserved念.

To grasp is to preserve; to relinquish is to lose. To grasp is to grasp the true unity of qi; to preserve is to preserve the supreme mystery of essence. Concentrating one spirit, all spirits concentrate; gathering one qi, all qi gathers. Things that accord with me may be stored without intent; things that oppose me may be harmonized without intent. When true and false are fundamentally empty, opposition and accord both still, the three times become perfectly interpenetrating, and the one spirit shines radiantly—this is the essential of grasping and regulating the heart.

The reason is this: when one念 arises, ten thousand念 arise; when one aperture opens, nine apertures open. There is no other reason—it is the intent to *use spirit to govern qi.* From time immemorial, I have been burdened by nameless afflictions, my karmic consciousness vast and boundless, impossible to dispel in an instant or set aside in the present moment.

Thus, the ancients spoke of *heart and breath interdependent, breath regulated and heart stilled*—is this not regulating the heart? And again: *with undivided focus, the spirit is concentrated*—is this not refined thought? The sages said: *Restrain the heart to one place, and nothing will be unaccomplished.* Thus, Master Tan said: *Forget the form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness.* These two words, *forgetting the form,* are the essence of restraining the heart.

Yet even if one forgets the form while the heart wanders among the myriad things, is this not worse than not forgetting at all? The reason I speak of forgetting is not merely to forget the form, but also to forget the heart. When both heart and realm are forgotten, one abides in profound stillness."

He asked again: "Now, if someone is deluded and does not study, studies but does not encounter a teacher, encounters a teacher but does not practice, practices but does not succeed—is this because the time has not yet come, and the conditions are not yet ripe? Or is it because their endowment is meager, and their bones cannot attain immortality?"

The master replied: "The ancients spoke of *the Dao present before the eyes, understanding before words are spoken*—for in me, it is already pure gold and uncarved jade; one need only seek the appraisal of a master craftsman. If one drifts without direction, lacking any foundation, now studying under Master Huang, then under Master Li, this year learning the Dao, next year learning the arts, diligent today, lax tomorrow—seeking the straight path in this manner is like *removing one’s own falsehood while seeking another’s truth.*"

Only through the single word "faith" does one ascend the steps of the Dao;
Only through the single word "diligence" does one establish the foundation of Dao-practice;
Only through the single word "nothingness" does one respond to things;
Only through the single word "being" does one concentrate the spirit.
Practice this long and steadily, and Heaven will surely send a sagely teacher to reveal the path for you.
Let those who study the Dao reflect on this.

Someone again asked: "The ancients who expounded the *Yijing* sought to exhaust principle and fulfill nature, thereby attaining destiny. I have indeed studied this—are nature and destiny one principle, or two?"
The master replied: "Did not the ancient sages say: *What is mandated by Heaven is called nature; following nature is called the Dao; cultivating the Dao is called teaching*? In truth, it is one principle."

Someone again asked: "As for the Golden Elixir of Return, one first establishes the furnace and sets up the tripod, then discerns mercury and recognizes lead. Thereafter, one gathers them according to the year, month, day, and hour, refining them with water and fire, with signs and cycles. Thus, one matches them by weight, models them after husband and wife, congeals the cinnabar head, ingests the knife-point, nurtures the sacred embryo, and gives birth to the infant—so that one may have a body beyond the body. This is the study of those who cultivate immortality. I have indeed entered its inner mysteries, yet remain perplexed by the doubts of dragon and tiger, bewildered by the confusion of crow and hare. Does the master possess a finger that points beyond the moon?"

The master replied: "Altars, furnaces, tripods, and hearths—these arise from emptiness and nothingness. Lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury—these arise from the indistinct and imperceptible. Water, fire, signs, and cycles—these arise from the obscure and profound. Years, months, days, and hours—these arise from delusion and illusion. Yet though they appear as nothing, they are in truth something. It lies in harmonizing the weights, in the union of creation and transformation, so that water and fire achieve balance, metal and earth merge. If this is not so, then the Yellow Dame may urge Ding Gong to flee by dawn, and the Enchanted Maiden may cradle the infant and weep by night. Thus, the predecessors entirely discarded methods of guiding and pulling, exhaling and inhaling, moving and swallowing, breathing and visualization, and all such practices—fearing that people would cling to the petty matters of saliva, essence, fluids, qi, and blood, and fail to grasp the essential teaching of *specializing the qi to attain suppleness, able to be like an infant.* Alas! How wondrous!"

To bind it in a fleeting moment, to nurture it for ten months—this is what is called *nurturing the infant within the nothingness.*

The essential principle is this: *Use the useful within the useless, apply effort within effortlessness.*

It is also said: *Within the indistinct they meet, within the obscure transformations occur.*

Yet though it be thus, one must first taste the Cloud Gate cake—do not merely drool over empty words.

Someone asked: How far does the *Golden Elixir* of Laozi differ from the Great Dao?
The Dao is formless—how can there be so-called *Dragon and Tiger*?
The Dao is nameless—how can there be so-called *Lead and Mercury*?
Is the Golden Elixir an art? Or is it the Dao?

I answer: As Wei Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* says, *"When metal returns to its original nature, only then is it called the Returned Elixir."*
The *Golden Elixir*—*gold* signifies the nature, *elixir* signifies the heart. Its essence is called the Great Dao; its function is called the Great Elixir. The Elixir is the Dao; the Dao is the Elixir.

Further, one must *specialize the qi to attain suppleness*, embrace the light in silence, nurture correctness and hold fullness, guard the feminine and embrace the One. With the heart unmoving, the ten thousand conditions all fall still. Ten thousand volumes of elixir scriptures are not as good as guarding the One. Guard the One, and the ten thousand methods return to the One.

Thus:
Heaven attains the One and becomes clear;
Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil;
Man attains the One and becomes numinous;
Valleys attain the One and become full;
Sun and moon attain the One and become bright;
The ten thousand images attain the One and come to life;
The sage attains the One and the world is at peace.

The Dao gives birth to the One,
The One gives birth to the Two,
The Two give birth to the Three,
The Three give birth to the ten thousand things.

The Dao is the essence of the One;
The One is the function of the Dao.
Man embraces the Dao in life,
Sharing the same root as Heaven and Earth,
Sharing the same body as the ten thousand things.

The Dao is simply the One.
Attain the One, and one transcends the after-Heaven to avoid death;
Lose the One, and one rots with things.

You guard it with the One as the foundation,
Gather it with the One as the medicine,
Refine it with the One as the fire,
Bind it with the One as the elixir,
Nurture it with the One as the sacred embryo,
Circulate it with the One as the drawing and adding,
Sustain it with the One as the firm sealing,
Clarify it with the One as the bathing.

From the One to the One,
The One taken to its utmost—
This is called *shedding the embryo.*
At the utmost of the limitless,
The One is no longer one—
In union with the true Dao,
In eternal harmony with Heaven—
This is called the *True One.*

The sage forgets form to nurture qi,
Forgets qi to nurture spirit,
Forgets spirit to nurture emptiness.
The Dao does not seek emptiness—emptiness naturally returns to it.
If man can empty the heart, the Dao naturally returns to him.

If you wish for clothing, the One gives you robes;
If you wish for food, the One gives you grain.

If you wish for drink, the One gives you nectar;
If you wish for shelter, the One gives you a hall;
If you wish for cold, the One gives you frost;
If you wish for heat, the One gives you broth.

Empty the heart, forget the form,
Guard the One, embrace the numinous.
Thus can you secure your essence,
Treasure your qi,
Preserve your spirit.
When the Three Fields brim with essence,
The Five Viscera swell with qi,
Only then is the elixir complete.
One by one, in the One—
This is how you attain longevity.

The ancient sages said:
"Put the self last, and the self comes first;
Forget the self, and the self endures."
This is truly so.

The disciple further asked:
"By long-standing fortune, I have been granted this encounter,
Bearing the great mercy of your instruction.
When I inquired of the Dao, you revealed it through the heart;
When I asked of the Golden Elixir and the Great Medicine,
You again revealed it through the heart.
I deeply understand that all is but the heart.
Suddenly, I seem to grasp something—
Yet if I seek to describe it, there is nothing to compare;
If I try to speak of it, there are no words to utter.
But the celestial mechanism runs deep,
The essentials of the Dao are subtle and profound.
Though I now know the medicines so clearly,
I still harbor doubts about the *fire times*."

The master replied:
"The twenty-four solar terms,
The seventy-two pentads,
The twenty-eight constellations,
The sixty-four hexagrams,
The twelve celestial divisions—
These are the shifts of Heaven and Earth,
The revolutions of yin and yang.
A year has twelve months,
A month has thirty days,
A day has twelve hours,
Totaling one hundred *ke*.
Within them, six yang and six yin—
All is but the rising and falling of a single qi.
How does the human body differ from Heaven and Earth?

This is why the method of elixir refinement
Gathers the Five Phases,
Unites the Eight Trigrams,
Models Heaven and emulates Earth,
Aligns with the sun and measures the moon,
Arranges the hexagrams in order,
Positions the stars in their places.
As time shifts with the days,
Inner cultivation responds to outer signs.
Above, water; below, fire.
One civil, one martial—
Thus there are the *symbols of advance and retreat*,
The *times of drawing and adding*,
The *gate of firm sealing*,
The *hour of bathing*,
The *transformations of hexagrams*,
The *subtleties of creation*—
This is called the *fire times*.
It is like the waxing and waning of the moon’s light,
The ebb and flow of the tides.
Yet this is simple and easy,
Not to be lightly transmitted—
For it seizes the creative power of Heaven and Earth,
Steals the souls of the sun and moon.

That night, at the third watch,
I shall make a pact with Heaven to reveal it to you.

The ancient sages said:
*Though you know the medicines, without knowing the Spirit Chamber, you cannot form the embryo;
Though you know the Spirit Chamber, without knowing the fire times, you cannot complete the elixir.*
Who but you could partake in this?"

Hè Lín’s Péng Sǒu bowed twice and said:
"Though I am dull-witted, I wish to receive your teaching."

*Dānfáng Fǎyǔ* and *Hú Tāi Xiān*

Master Lǚ, crane-necked and tortoise-cheeked,
Met Zhōnglí at the appointed hour;
The Recluse of Stone, deer-nosed and mouse-eared,
Chanced upon Píngshū’s arrival.
They sighed at the rarity of karmic timing—
How could it compare to fame, profit, right, or wrong?

The Great Medicine of the Golden Elixir,
Ancients transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas;
The Sacred Scrolls of the Jade Casket,
Scholars ten deluded, nine lost in confusion.

The crow in the moon, the hare in the sun—
Inverted *kǎn* and *lí*;
The tiger in water, the dragon in fire—
Revolving *fù* and *gòu*.

Gather the primordial qi of the One,
As marrow within lead;
Seize the myriad transformations of the stars,
As essence within mercury.

Only in the moments before and after the crescent moon,
At the juncture of waxing and waning.
Those who know must swiftly gather when *guǐ* is born;
Those who are ignorant let the moment slip beyond reach.

Half a catty of essence, half a catty of qi—
All reside in the southwest;
One *liǎng* of fire, one *liǎng* of medicine—
Truly dwell in the northeast.

Gather the metal essence and wood sap,
Return them to the Yellow Court;
Refine the white snow and yellow sprouts,
Congeal them into purple powder.
As *Wùzhēn Piān* calls it, the *Divine Water of the Flower Pool*,
As *Zhīmìng Lùn* terms it, the *Earthly Soul and Heavenly Spirit*.
Gather and refine them—
Then it is formed, then it is complete.

Like the first drop between husband and wife,
Ten months to gestate the embryo;
Like the meeting of ruler and minister in myriad affairs,
A hundred officials arrayed in their posts.

At the winter solstice when the sun is at its zenith—
Then wage war in the wilds;
At the summer solstice when time retreats—
Then defend the city.

All comes down to a moment’s work,
To be verified in a single day.
Nine, three, two, eight—
The reckoning lies only with the Maiden of Mercury and the Venerable Metal;
Seven, six, one, three—
The exhaustion leads no further than the Old Woman Yellow and Elder Dīng.

No need to peruse ten thousand volumes of elixir classics—
A single oral formula suffices.
Your coming is earnest,
I know your years of seeking and longing.
Had you not borne these noble bones from a former life,
How could you now devote body and heart to this?

From gathering the medicine to forming the embryo,
From firing the elixir to shedding the body—
It encompasses the subtleties of drawing and adding,
Depicts the mechanism of bathing.
No worry of metal and wood’s separation,
Only the joy of water and earth’s shared abode.

Only nurture it gently—
There is no hardship.
In the twelve hours, only one hour;
Within three hundred days, only half a day.

When the Elixir Field holds its treasure,
In movement, stillness, sitting, or lying—no care;
When the Purple Palace records your name,
In life, death, and the wheel of rebirth—no burden.
Joyful and free,
Henceforth at ease.

This work can be practiced even amidst the bustle;
In discussing the profound, all is resolved in an instant.
Gathered yet not scattered,
Refined, it grows ever firmer.

The Cinnabar Tripod, the Crescent Moon Furnace—
What difficulty is there in finding them?
Guard the One Altar, the Central Cauldron—
Seek only within yourself.

You must recognize yin and yang,
Understand the Mysterious Female.
When dragon essence fills the tripod,
Send the Golden Lad down the Twelve-Storied Tower;
When phoenix marrow brims the pot,
Command the Jade Maiden to report across the Three Thousand Worlds.

At this hour, the elixir is ripe—
Yet you must still cherish the infant with a mother’s care;
Soon, the clouds will soar—
Only then will the True Person ascend to the Emperor on High.

*Rhapsody on the Golden Fluid Returned Elixir*

The body’s wood withers,
The heart’s embers grow cold.
If you wish to ascend to the Jade Palace,
You must refine the Golden Elixir.

The Qian Horse and Kun Ox
guard Lord Ding within the sacred chamber;
The Li Crow and Kan Hare
serve as matchmakers for the Crimson Woman at the true altar.
The Crimson Gate’s scattered lads,
the leisurely scholars of the limpid court—
They bid the Green Dragon of Fusang
spread its wings to emerge from fire,
while the White Tiger of Mount Hua
bares its fangs to plunge into water.

Heavenly furnace and earthen tripod,
pivots of creation at the Three Passes;
Moon’s essence and sun’s spirit,
a single handful of yin-yang’s marrow.
Within lead, earth is concealed;
from mercury, gold is born.
The tortoise embodies the *zi* line,
the serpent the *wu* image;
the hare is the *mao* beast,
the rooster the *you* fowl.
The Four Symbols and Five Phases
never depart from *wu*;
The Three Primes and Eight Trigrams
depend upon *ren*.
At dawn, it is *zhun*;
at dusk, it is *meng*—
the six lines take form.
By night, it must be *fu*;
by day, it must be *gou*—
the myriad things lack intent.

Thus the Three Natures converge,
gathering in the primordial palace;
the Two Qi ascend and descend,
spiraling along the Yellow Way.
From quicksilver alone,
once it turns to black jade,
the Seven Returns’ cinnabar
becomes a crimson jewel.
Ruby tangerines and jade pomegranates,
fire-pears and flame-jujubes—
A world of white snow
flutters through the Purple Court’s pure breeze;
A courtyard of yellow blossoms
glows beside the elixir field’s auspicious herbs.

I know well what is drawn forth and added,
from what earth it is gathered;
where life and death reside,
when fullness and deficiency arise.

Light and heavy form the root of clarity and turbidity;
intervals and separation reveal the mechanism of movement and stillness.
Cultivate correctness to embrace the One,
hold fullness yet keep to the feminine.

In all the world, none can grasp this;
they sit in dry emptiness all day, knowing not where to turn.
Kindness breeds harm, harm breeds kindness—
the lunar lodge shows the Pleiades;
host within guest, guest within host—
the Dipper’s degrees circle back to the Winnowing Basket.

I have often said the Great Dao is wordless,
the inner elixir no mere technique.
The Dark Pearl hangs as an image,
while yin’s depths embrace yang’s virtue;
the infant forms in the womb,
while the masculine holds the feminine essence.

Between ruler and minister, there is priority and regret;
beyond husband and wife, life and death, fortune and misfortune.
The heart at *ding*’s position,
the tension at *gui*’s,
the woman in *jia*’s palace,
the completion in *geng*’s.
Though punishment and virtue wax and wane,
there is no certainty in prosperity or adversity;
though bathing and concealment occur,
there is no fixed necessity.

The ounces of medicinal ingredients,
from east, west, south, and north, return to the center;
the fire-timing of city walls,
from two, eight, nine, and three, become one.
Thus the Magpie Bridge and river chariot,
for a hundred moments ascend;
the Flowery Pond’s divine water,
through the four seasons flows in reverse.

Nourishment and defense, cold and warmth—
like the Quail Fire and Ghost Well;
spirit’s decline and flourishing—
like the Dark Void and Dipper-Ox.
Mother and child enclose one another,
body transforms, heart transforms;
brothers like ocarina and flute,
fortune is cultivated, wisdom is cultivated.

The six moving lines of the hexagram
reveal changes at new moon, full moon, crescent, and waning;
the solstices alter their degrees,
bringing worries of locusts, floods, and drought.
The Perfected One’s cosmic wonders stretch boundlessly—
a thousand miles of streams and mountains lie within his grasp.

Left army and right army,
since ancient times, are benevolence and righteousness;
great reclusion and small reclusion,
from now on, are palace and horn.
The wind whispers softly,
the moon shines gracefully—
a lone crane in a wisp of cloud,
as a long whistle echoes,
I compile this book to leave to later students.

In the end, singing thus:
I never believed in immortals in this life,
nor knew of the Great Brahma Heaven.
How could I bear to hear others speak of Penglai?
I cover my face and laugh at their folly.
The Seven Returns’ elixir is often false,
and people often call its transmission a lie.
The world says immortals can ascend,
and that they live forever without dying.
But flesh has no wings and must fall to earth,
and no one lives a hundred years—how can life be extended?
Before my eyes, I see only life and death together,
death and life, life and death, cycling endlessly.

Master Cui Xu told me,
his understanding was quite different.
He feared that people’s karmic conditions were shallow,
their allotted shares meager,
and that without lifespan, they would return to the Yellow Springs.
The human body has only three things:
essence, spirit, and qi—always preserve them whole.
This essence is not the essence of intercourse,
but the saliva from the Jade Emperor’s mouth;
this qi is not the qi of breath,
but the mist of primordial simplicity;
this spirit is not the spirit of thought,
but one that can stand beside the Primordial Beginning.

Hearing his words, I was both awed and doubtful,
clenching my fists in uncertainty.
Yet I knew that in daily movement and stillness,
one thing always remains whole and round.
This thing’s root is essence and qi,
and I feared it was the filling within the body.
How could I know that this essence, this spirit, this qi
originated before my parents’ birth?
The three never oppose or separate,
but bind into a single mass, vast and boundless.
Human life and death are but empty illusions—
this thing remains serene, untouched.

I suddenly awoke and reflected:
the elder’s words must not be false.
If I were to receive his teaching,
he would surely reveal this truth.
On the Mid-Autumn night of the first year of the Kai Xi era,
I burned incense, knelt, and received the oral transmission.
After practicing for just two or three days,
heaven and earth, sun and moon grew soft as silk.
Suddenly, I bit through the emptiness of space—
only then did I know that Zhong and Lü had grasped the mystery.

In my youth, I had long been devoted—
I would not have remained entangled in worldly dust to this extent.
I thought of eight hundred and three thousand years,
cloud-cranes arriving in pairs.
Though the elixir’s refinement failed,
it became eight ounces of sun-moon essence,
half a catty of cloud-mist fragments.
Light as a goose feather,
heavy as a thousand-weight iron;
white as heaven’s snow,
red as the blood of the orangutan.
Gathered into a jade gourd,
kept secret, never to be revealed.
At midnight, wind and thunder suddenly arose,
smoke and mist filled the vast emptiness.
Such flavor and feeling—
a mute man biting his tongue.
I clutched my belly and laughed,
lest my heart grow vexed and hot.
I must mend my fishing rod,
and once more cut the joints of autumn bamboo.

**The Perfected One Cui Xu’s Method of Peace and Joy**
Gather in your spirit’s light, speak little;
at the crown’s gate, a path of swirling mist gathers.
First raise the yang fire to refine the golden crucible,
then lower the divine spring to irrigate the jade field.
The union occurs beyond Ox Ford,
clearly at the Magpie Bridge’s edge.
The work of nine nines and six sixes—
this is the immortal of peace and joy in the human world.

**Presented to Wan’an**
Returning to the mountains:
Which turn of the wheel of life and death is this?
Dust after dust, kalpa after kalpa, never at rest.
A pool of deep green—the sea of right and wrong,
a thousand feet of pale blue—the mountain of self and others.
The nature’s earth sprouts tender shoots, longing for the water realm;
the heart’s sky, bright moon, hides behind clouded gates.
The pearl within the robe is nowhere to be found—
for now, follow conditions and refine the Great Return.

**Gathering the Medicine**
At the Five Aggregates Mountain’s peak, many white clouds;
in the depths of the white clouds, medicinal sprouts are fragrant.
King Soundless Buddha sows them in due time,
Heavenly Worthy Primordial Beginning takes up the hoe.
The stone maiden rides the dragon, grasping the rain art;
the wooden man mounts the tiger, plucking frost’s herbs.
Regardless of wealth or poverty, every household has them—
gather them and return, each with a catty.

**The Crucible**
You must believe that in the prior heavens, nothing exists—
yin and yang mold this form and pattern.
The cinnabar crucible of true emptiness and equality,
the crescent moon furnace of emptiness and spiritual penetration.
The nine orifices can be fanned to warm the altar,
but if the fire is lost at the two hours, the medicinal ingredients wither.
Only this single nameless flame—
refining the great man of the human world.

**Fire Timing**
The positionless Perfected One refines the great elixir,
leaning on the sword that presses against the sky, chilling men’s bones.
The jade crucible’s fire forges the Heavenly Worthy’s gall,
the golden tripod’s broth boils the Buddha’s liver.
A hundred moments of cold and warmth, precise in busyness;
the six lines of civil and martial, observed in stillness.
If one asks about the true crucible and furnace,
how could they be separate from this very red-meat body?

**Bathing**
The medicinal crucible and elixir tripod, flames blazing—
the Six Bandits and Three Corpses fear its strict command.

Neither coming nor going, neither advancing nor retreating,
Neither increasing nor decreasing, neither subtracting nor adding.
The waves of the River of Love lie still, the Vermilion Bird floats,
The depths of the Sea of Awakening run deep, the White Toad is immersed.
Ever since bathing the elixir and returning to the secret chamber,
Beneath the Gate of the Great Yang, the night-shining curtain.
Nurturing warmth—
The Golden Elder and the Mysterious Maiden wed in union,
At the cave’s mouth, peach blossoms bloom day after day.
Having gathered the moon from the heavens,
It is refined into a treasure within the chamber, enduring ten thousand kalpas.
The Yellow Dame is none other than the Mother of Mothers,
The Red Child is the body beyond the body.
Since the Dragon Han kalpa, all tidings have ceased,
Before the era of Majestic Sound, who else remains?

**Rebirth**
Azure sky, bright sun—a single thunderclap,
Letting go from the suspended cliff, the sacred embryo is complete.
Eyes like the blind, yet radiant with light,
Unbound as if still fettered, laughing heartily.
Beneath the golden palace, a thousand willows,
Before the jade hall, ten thousand plum trees.
The mandarin-duck curtains betray loneliness,
After the feast at the Qin Tower, why not return?

**Golden Elixir**
Buddha and sentient beings share a single household,
On the tip of a hair, galaxies appear.
Nine returns, seven reversals—the fish swims through the net,
Four Noble Truths, three emptinesses—the hare enters the snare.
In what year did Chaos bear a child?
Last night, the empty dwelling bloomed again.
Who seeks the elixir within the crucible?
Before the withered-tree cliff, the moon’s shadow slants.

**Ascension**
Since stepping through the gate of Nirvana,
A single pillow of pure wind for ten thousand years.
Though the path to Penglai across the Weak Waters exists,
Śākyamuni and Maitreya are deep in meditation—
Who would take the land before the withered-tree cliff
And release a sky of falling flowers and singing birds?
Two clay oxen battle into the sea,
To this day, their fate remains unknown.

**Visiting in Unity**
The Daoist’s home lies south of the sea,
He comes to visit Old Man Wan of Mount Lu’s hermitage.
The dew-laden pillar and lantern are both raised in invitation,
The monks’ hall and Buddha hall all chant in harmony.
Mountains, rivers, and the great earth move as one,
All creatures with breath share a single shrine.
The fish in the pickle jar, though nearly drowned, still lives—
This incense stick is offered to the living Gautama.

**Four Water Melody Songs**
One

**"The Oral Formula for Golden Fluid Returning Elixir"**

Within the void, a child is nurtured to maturity.
No other art is needed—
Only the divine water must enter the Flowery Pond.
Gather the celestial true lead and mercury,
In a moment they naturally unite,
A single drop of purple-golden fat.
Ten months of celestial fire,
And the Jade Crucible yields a jade mushroom.

Do not be foolish—
Now that I’ve revealed it, doubt no more.
The workings of heaven and earth
Are nothing more than Kan and Li.
Why does the stone hold jade within?
Why is the pearl hidden in the clam’s belly?
By this, the celestial mechanism is revealed.
How much more the subtlety within subtlety—
Not easily shared with you.

**II**

No need to seek divine water,
Nor ask of the Flowery Pond.
Yellow sprouts and white snow—
All are but borrowed names.
This earth-ox and heaven-horse
Are the Li-dragon and Kan-tiger—
No need for further doubt.
The medicine has no weight,
The firing times no fixed hour.

The crescent moon furnace,
The cinnabar crucible—
All are not it.
True lead, true mercury—
If you encounter them and do not refine them, what use are they?
Your own Golden Elder and Crimson Woman,
Gradually forged into one mass,
Breathing like an infant in the womb.
If you do not believe it, ask Zhang Pingshu—
Who else would you question?

**III**

**IV**

To become an immortal, go—
the work seems idle play.
At the first stir of yang,
the jade furnace ignites to refine the returning elixir.
Seize heaven’s soul and earth’s spirit,
allowing no dragon’s leap or tiger’s bound—
the crucible fills, mercury’s blossoms dry.
Let the river chariot turn as it will,
the path leads straight to the Mud Pill Palace.

Refine golden essence,
gather jade fluid,
pass the three barriers.
Yet with metal and wood still sundered,
how can you ascend Jade Capital Mountain?
Find the vein of Cao Creek’s path,
then take the Flowery Pond’s divine water,
condensing it into the Purple Gold Pill.
No more hunger or cold—
heaven above is but the world of men.

**V**

The earthen crucible’s gentle fire,
the bellows stir like spring thunder.
The three fields rise and fall,
a single path belongs to the numinous terrace.
Here are true dragon and true tiger,
naturally harmonizing lead and mercury—
the infant forms the true embryo.
Seizing the bright moon from water,
the heart-ground blooms like a flower.

One revolution of work,
thirty days,
ninety cycles.
Drawing and adding the qi’s seasons,
refining white blood to replace the withered frame.
The four images and five phases gather,
congealing in one place—
the square inch free of the tiniest speck of dust.
Man dwells in the Mud Pill Palace,
the return path leads to Penglai.
