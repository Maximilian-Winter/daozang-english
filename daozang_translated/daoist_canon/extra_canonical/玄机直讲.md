**Direct Discourse on the Mysterious Mechanism: Two Treatises on the Fire Phases of Elixir Refinement**

When first applying effort, one must not cling to *youwei*—all *youwei* belongs to the posterior heaven. Many in today’s Daoist schools fall into this error, and thus few in the world attain perfection. Yet one must also not fixate on *wuwei*, for *wuwei* leads to sterile emptiness. Many in today’s Buddhist schools succumb to this flaw, and thus few in the world become true disciples of the Buddha. The Way does not spread because the Way is not understood.

The initial work lies in extinguishing emotional attachments and sweeping away stray thoughts—this is the first step in laying the foundation and refining the self. Once the human heart is cleared, the celestial heart returns; once human desires are purified, celestial principle abides. Each day, first settle for an hour until body and mind are fully at peace, and the breath is harmonized. Then, gently close the eyes, lower the lids, and inwardly observe the space one *cun* and three *fen* between the heart below and the kidneys above—neither clinging nor abandoning, neither forgetting nor forcing, until all thoughts vanish and only the solitary spirit remains. This is called *zhengnian* (right mindfulness).

At this time, within this mindfulness, one is lively and free; within that *qi*, one is serene and buoyant. When exhaling, the breath rises without rushing the heart; when inhaling, it descends without disturbing the kidneys. With each opening and closing, each coming and going, after practicing for one or two weeks, naturally the fire of the two kidneys begins to steam, the *qi* of the cinnabar field warms, the breath regulates itself without effort, and the *qi* refines itself without cultivation. Once the *qi* and breath harmonize, they no longer rise or fall, come or go—this is *taixi* (embryonic breathing), *shenxi* (spiritual breathing), the true bellows and furnace, the return to the root and restoration of life, the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the root of heaven and earth.

At this stage, the *qi* is like a budding flower, like an embryo in the womb. Naturally, the true *qi* steams and nourishes the *ying* and *wei*, ascending from the *weilü*, piercing the *jiaji*, and rising to the *niwan*. It descends the Magpie Bridge, passes the Double Towers, reaches the Crimson Palace, and settles in the middle cinnabar field—this is the initial movement of the River Chariot. Yet when the *qi* arrives, the spirit is not yet complete; it is not yet the true movement, so one must not attend to it. Simply maintain gentle inward focus, guarding the central palace, and boundless vitality will arise—this is what is meant by "nurturing the bud."

After one or two months of practice, the spirit becomes ever more tranquil. With prolonged stillness, the *qi* grows ever more abundant—this is the work of spirit generating *qi* and *qi* generating spirit. After a hundred days or more, the essence and spirit flourish, the true *qi* gradually fills, and the gentle fire phase ensures ample blood and fluid. Naturally, *kan* and *li* unite in marriage, *qian* and *kun* converge, spirit merges with *qi*, and in an instant, the true *qi* blends into oneness. A gust of returning wind surges upward through the hundred vessels—this is the true movement of the River Chariot. If a single point of numinous light is felt in the cinnabar field, it is the Mysterious Pearl at the water’s depths, the Yellow Sprout within the earth.

At this time, the first yang returns, as if the red sun rises over the azure sea—misty and hazy, now hidden, now visible—then lead-fire is born. Before *qian* and *kun*, *kan* and *li* unite, in the emptiness and stillness, the spirit congeals at the center. With uninterrupted effort, all is forged into one—this is the alignment of the Five Phases. When water and fire interact, the second phase of gathering begins; the River Chariot reverses its course, and in the fourth phase, the medicine is obtained. The spirit dwells within, the elixir’s light never departs—this is the Great Celestial Cycle, the practice of the Ninefold Great Return.

At this stage, a single drop of utmost yang essence congeals within, concealed in the moment when desires are stilled and emotions are extinguished. It takes form and shape. Having reached this state, the breath rests in the embryo, and inner and outer nurturing proceed without the slightest lapse—this is also called the ten-month work.

The work of stillness lies in every moment, and within each moment, the efforts of refining essence into *qi*, *qi* into spirit, and spirit into emptiness are present—not only in the ten months. Even within an hour, a day, a month, or a year, it is the same. Sitting with eyes closed, gathering the spirit, calming the heart, and regulating the breath—this is the work of refining essence into *qi*. Turning the light inward, focusing the spirit in the elixir chamber, allowing the true breath to come and go, with stillness reaching its extreme and movement arising from it—this is the work of refining *qi* into spirit. When the true *qi* returns to the origin, yin and yang reverse and unite, and after one round of intercourse, the wind calms and the waves subside. At this time, fixing right mindfulness in the cinnabar field is the sealing of the fire phase.

Practicing these three stages of work over days, months, and years, one not only enters the ten-month gestation. Thus it is said: in every moment of practice, there is a Celestial Cycle for that moment; in every hour, day, month, or year of practice, there is a Celestial Cycle for that hour, day, month, or year. Yet within a single moment, the first half is warmth, advancing the fire, the full moon, the waxing crescent, the dawn of *zhun*, spring and summer; the latter half is coolness, retreating the tally, the new moon, the waning crescent, the dusk of *meng*, autumn and winter. An hour is divided into four upper and four lower moments, and the same applies to a day, a month, or a year. This is the gathering of yin and yang, the Five Phases—one moment’s work seizes a year’s climate.

At this point, one attains true emptiness and true stillness. After one or two years, or even ten or a hundred, shattering the void to merge with the Great Void—this is the work of refining spirit into emptiness.

Once the ten-month work is complete, one must constantly tend to the infant. Step by step, mile by mile, gradually emerging—if one is careless or unrestrained, one may become lost and unable to return. The immortal scriptures say: "The spirit enters the *qi* to form the embryo; the *qi* returns to the spirit to congeal the elixir"—this is the single point descending into the Yellow Court.

Those with fewer distracting thoughts attain the elixir sooner, while those with many attain it later. This method is simple and easy, yet people lack the courage to practice it boldly. If one can persist in solitary practice over time, one will surely penetrate metal and stone, tread fire and water, and traverse heaven and earth. With further accumulation of merit and virtuous deeds, refining and ingesting the great elixir of spirit and cinnabar, one will attain perfection of both form and spirit, ascend in broad daylight, and elevate one’s entire household—this depends entirely on the depth of one’s merit and cultivation. If one does not ingest the spirit elixir but instead allows the yang spirit to ascend on its own, looking back at one’s former body as but a heap of dust, one may still take flight in daylight, abide for ten thousand kalpas, and share the eternal spring of the cosmos.

**On the Verification of the Return**
The method of seven returns and nine reversions begins with practice. First, guide the true yin within the yang of the upper aperture into the inner golden crucible of the *qi* sea, where it unites with the true yang of the lower aperture. The true yin governed by yang is none other than one’s original spirit, belonging to the three *hun*; the true yang of the lower aperture is the original *qi* within the body, belonging to the seven *po*. Once these two *qi* merge, Kan and Li naturally conjoin, *hun* and *po* intermingle, spirit and *qi* coagulate, and the embryo stabilizes. Daily, one experiences the joy and pleasure of external union between husband and wife—yet one must not become attached. When water and fire achieve mutual balance, they circulate through the four limbs like an external flame kindling a blaze. Maintaining equilibrium between water and fire constitutes the minor celestial orbit. As the fire’s timing harmonizes and its vapors rise, the breath reverses into the original sea, the external yang naturally enters within, and the true fire spontaneously surges upward. The entire body softens and relaxes, suffused with boundless delight. Within the abdomen, the living dragon stirs, ascending and descending, undergoing dozens of transformations each day. The infant boy and the maiden naturally unite—this is the stage of gathering yin to replenish yang.

Refining the jade fluid and returning the elixir begins with laying the foundation and refining the self, accumulating inner dharmic wealth. One abides in carefree ease, day and night perpetually luminous—this is the first step toward longevity and enduring vision. Ordinary people rely on the five grains to sustain life; going without food for several days, they perish from *qi* starvation. If one’s lower origin is depleted in old age...

The bones and marrow both hollow, unable to withstand the *qi* of the five grains, then *qi* weakens and illness arises. Thus, the five grains can nourish a person, yet they can also kill. If one masters the union of inner and outer, with water and fire in harmony, *qi* and blood flowing in reverse, the *qi* of the five viscera converging, and the spleen and stomach open and unobstructed, then food entering the abdomen can also transform into *qi*, generate essence, and nourish the spirit.

Should one truly grasp the celestial mechanism at the outset, waiting until the marrow fills to overflowing and the abdomen swells like that of a pregnant woman—though no fetal form appears, only *qi* replete, essence abundant, and spirit complete—then, with these three in fullness, the true fire refines, the spirit is harmonized, and the void is cultivated. This is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.

I urge seekers to visit and inquire of lineage masters, earnestly seeking the perfected ones to reveal the celestial mechanisms within and without the body. Clearly understand the swift method of beginning practice, refine the self and await the moment, waiting for the arrival of the solitary yang. Choose a secluded place and enter the chamber to refine this great elixir of dragon and tiger.

It is essential to find a quiet place where no crow of rooster nor bark of dog can be heard, and outside, only fellow adepts of the Dao should be present—no idle or unrelated person should approach, lest the primordial spirit be startled and scattered. Earlier, I spoke of harmonizing with the world and blending with the dust; now, I speak of seclusion—why? Refine the self amid the mundane, nurture *qi* in the mountains and forests; this is the time to enter the chamber and commence the work, to begin the practice.

To transcend the ordinary and enter sainthood is no small matter. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, all concerns forgotten, not a thread of attachment remaining, cutting cleanly as with a blade, forever a stranger in this land, with no thought of retreat or regret. Hold to emptiness to refine the spirit, guard the void to cultivate nature. The five viscera, sinews, bones, *qi*, and blood of the entire body all transform into azure *qi*. With single-minded devotion, train the spirit to purity, shaping it to be commanded. As stars revolve and the Dipper turns, it changes at will. Nurture it until the entire body is free of wrinkles, like a spider’s form, with the seven orifices above radiating light, luminous day and night. When the body becomes like the Great Void, only then is it the proper time to seek the immortal Dao.

This verifies that *qi* is full and spirit complete. Only with vast dharmic wealth can the great elixir be refined—this is what makes one a true elixir adept. When the work is attained, the time naturally arrives. The seven orifices radiate light, the three yangs flourish, the spirit-sword takes form. Seizing the moment like sailing with the wind and tide, the fire is ignited with thunderous roars and lightning flashes. Only then can one seize the celestial mechanism without, begin the work of capture, gather the true lead beyond the body, wed the dragon to the tiger, and drive the tiger to the dragon.

If one can gather and cluster without missing the proper timing, serenely draw up the gold from the sea’s depths, open the spine’s pass, ascend to the Mud Pill Palace, and descend into the Crystal Palace, where it unites with the Wood Mercury—within half a moment, the clustering is complete. The true fire surges into the four limbs, and the entire body’s bones feel as if scorched by fire or sliced by a blade, most difficult to endure. Even the staunchest hero, at this point, has not a shred of composure left.

Guard against danger and contemplate peril, bathing body and mind in ice, achieving harmony of water and fire. In an instant, the entire body feels like exploding beans, all at once bursting open. The *qi* and blood of the whole body coalesce into form and speech, clamoring as one within. Beneath the root of the tongue lie two cavities: the left is the Elixir Well, the right the Stone Spring—this is precisely the Lianquan point. As the bone meridians open, kidney water surges upward like an external spring, impossible to swallow completely, its flavor most extraordinary, unlike sugar or honey.

Yet the most wondrous moment comes at the very beginning of tending the furnace and commencing the work: the earth is about to yield its golden lotus, the heavens to bestow their precious dew. Suddenly, a single drop of true mercury descends, piercing the heart like icy coolness. Immediately, a spark of spirit-fire follows, clustering within the Chamber of Union. Serene and profound, it resounds like a thousand drums in battle, a myriad thunderclaps roaring. This is the transformation of the hundred meridians, *qi*, blood, and heart within one’s own body—do not be alarmed. Simply tread the steps of the Dipper, wield the sword, and grasp the seal. Here lies the most perilous point: three revolutions, nine turns, subduing generals and summoning marshals. Be vigilant in guarding this space.

In the void, one may witness dragons and tigers mating, heaven and earth in harmony, the sun and moon conjoined in their palaces, or see hosts of immortals and buddhas. When the work reaches this stage, myriad visions appear—take care not to mistake them for reality, lest external demons take hold. Once the primordial spirit is recognized and mercury and lead unite, after three days the great medicine is born. These three days are the most difficult to endure: the entire world becomes a realm of demonic illusions, spirits wailing and ghosts weeping on all sides, baleful *qi* and warlike smoke in every direction. This is the great work of opening the passes. Nine out of ten are terrified to death at this stage, but the heart must harbor no fear. Though the self has transformed into spirit, it remains a yin spirit, and yin spirits are most cunning, capable of endless transformations. How could they willingly submit to being subdued by mere kindness?

As the ancients said:
*"Only when you master the six penetrations can you escape birth and death;
If you do not master the six penetrations, do not dream of attaining the Dao amid chaos."*

After thirty hours—two and a half days—*qi* communicates with *qi*, filling to the utmost. Suddenly, a vibrant, living pearl of solar radiance bursts forth, shedding its husk and entering the mouth. A hundred thousand dragon spirits are all startled. This is the true yang elixir of primordial yang. Only upon taking it into the mouth does one realize that one’s fate is not ruled by heaven.

The ancient immortals said:
*"This time, great death brings ten thousand lives,"*
and
*"One battle and the world is pacified."*
This is precisely that stage—where heaven and earth harmonize, the sun and moon conjoin in their palaces.

When the medicine of true yang reaches the mouth, in an instant the fire of the celestial circuit ignites. The bone embryo dissolves into a mass of fleshly mud, the yang spirit leaves the body, and the hands are unbound without hindrance. With single-minded devotion, hold to emptiness and nurture the void, with emptiness nurture the spirit, with void nurture the heart. Transform the spirit at will.

All things under heaven are born of heaven and earth, and the myriad spirits pay homage in submission. Weary of dwelling in the dusty world, one roams freely to Penglai Isle, where three thousand jade maidens attend in service. Daily at the banquet of immortal peaches, one drinks celestial wine, wears celestial flowers, and becomes thoroughly intoxicated in all four limbs, the body entirely translucent. The tortoise and serpent emerge from the sea’s depths, and the myriad spirits receive their commands—this is the true inversion of lead and mercury, the body enveloped in purple mist and radiant beams, auspicious qi streaming in a thousand threads. This is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons.

Refine it for a hundred days, and the Mysterious Pass opens of itself; the Infant appears in form, the tortoise and serpent emerge naturally and coil about. Only at this stage can the adept’s mouth obtain the external mercury.

Refine it for six months, and the body becomes like silver paste, the blood transforms into white nectar, the whole body exudes a fragrance that assails others, and the breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the maturation of the numinous elixir, a single grain of living mercury. One who consumes it never dies and can even revive the dead.

Refine it for ten months, and the yang spirit departs the body, one form able to transform into ten thousand. Only await the twelfth month to seize the full tally of heaven and earth. Once the yang spirit is complete, it moves freely in and out of the body, and the fourteen thousand yang spirits step without shadow beneath the sun and moon, pass through metal and stone without hindrance, enter water without drowning, enter fire without burning, remain unscathed by blades and weapons, and elude the perception of ghosts and spirits. With endless transformations, one has become a true person. The qi and climate of the entire body are nothing but true medicine: a chicken that eats it becomes a phoenix, a dog that consumes it becomes a dragon. This principle is so profound that even ghosts and spirits find it difficult to comprehend. Without having encountered such words, one would surely not believe in the great elixir of golden cinnabar.

The work of creation and transformation undergoes three revolutions and nine cycles, seven returns and eight restorations. The firing times are subtle, the oral instructions for gathering and assembling take only three to five days to overturn heaven and earth entirely. All is natural, and the yin-yang creation within the human body is also natural. Only by embodying the creation and transformation of heaven and earth can one achieve success. Matters must be experienced and tested until they reach the state of naturalness. Though the work spans a year, the subtleties of the firing times lie within a hundred days, and the perilous moments of movement and stillness occur within just a few days. In an instant, internal and external are gathered and assembled, and in a moment of clarity, the sacred embryo is accomplished. Producing a pearl the size of a millet grain, one swallows it into the abdomen, and when the fire of the celestial circuit is complete, the embryo is shed and the bones are transformed. One need only hold to emptiness and nurture the void; the rest follows naturally.

If one truly receives the guidance of an enlightened teacher, one first refines the self amid the dust of the world, accumulates lead in the marketplace, gathers years into months, and months into hours. The great stabilization occurs in a single instant, no more than half an hour, overturning heaven and earth entirely. After ten months of firing, one embodies the natural method of heaven and earth. If one cannot seek life within death, how can one escape the three great calamities?

**On the Ingestion of the Great Elixir**
The salaries of the Three Clarities and the provisions of the Jade Emperor are bestowed only upon the former sages, worthies, and enlightened ones. How could one receive the ranks of such as Master Zhengyang, Immortal Ge, and Perfected Lord Yin—over a hundred in all—who all achieved the Dao before refining and ingesting the elixir to dispel confusion?

The ancient immortals said: *"When the inner elixir is complete, the outer elixir is achieved."* This is the true transmission received by the ancients. First, one accumulates essence and amasses qi, gathering the inner and outer dharmic wealth. When the qi is full and the spirit complete, golden light appears, shining day and night without cease. Only then is the inner elixir of the body complete, and the outer elixir of the self also manifests.

One must not read books by matching them to diagrams like seeking a steed with a picture. Only when the light shines day and night without cease and the sprouts of the medicine have grown can the adept gather the external medicine of the self and pair it with the inner yin and yang. Only then can the golden elixir enter the mouth, the fire of the celestial circuit ignite, and in an instant, one becomes clear and unbound, shedding the golden cicada’s shell. Silently, one pays homage to the Supreme Emperor, encounters the immortal chariot, and receives celestial emoluments. The knife spirits pay obeisance, and one can mend heaven and earth, pluck stars and grasp the moon, command thunder and turn the Dipper, summon wind and call rain. With a single thought, the myriad spirits obey, and one views heaven and earth as if they were the palm of one’s hand. This fortune surpasses that of three generations of emperors, this wisdom exceeds that of seven generations of top scholars. Only at this time can one refine and ingest the golden elixir.

This elixir, like a grain of millet, when dropped to the ground, illuminates the sky with golden light—only then is it called the divine elixir. Without spiritual communion, how dare one speak of ingesting the outer elixir? This principle is profound, the celestial mechanism deep and distant. Gold begets gold, silver begets silver; there are no other numinous spirits beyond. This art of the yellow and white is not the gold and silver of the mortal world but the mother that restrains qi. Only with the true transmission can one produce the great medicine of primordial qi, recognize the yellow sprout and white frost—this is the yellow and white, the mother that restrains qi, with which one refines the divine elixir. All gold, silver, liquid medicines, and elixirs belong to the postnatal realm. Without knowing the true yin and true yang of the same kind, one will never succeed.

Alas, the scholars of the world cannot distinguish true from false and do not encounter true teachers, engaging only in blind practice and reckless refinement. Those who truly cultivate life and destiny, if they have not yet met a true teacher, should quietly study books. The *Book of the Great Auspicious Divine Elixir* does not utter a single empty word or idle sentence. It is only that later generations fail to discern the heterodox from the orthodox and do not understand that the words of the sages and worthies are all hidden language and metaphors. They encounter mediocre teachers, cling to side doors, and harbor poisonous intentions with great ambition, lacking adaptability. Seeming right yet wrong, they exalt themselves as correct in voice and countenance.

Those who repel others from a thousand *li* away will see lofty persons turn and depart—how much more the immortals and sages! Before encountering a true teacher, scholars should proceed with humility and caution. Accumulate merit and deeds, face demons without retreat, endure slander without anger, value the Dao and disdain wealth. Once they meet a true teacher, they should earnestly seek with single-minded devotion, who will reveal the two true inner and outer messages of the body, suddenly awakening their understanding of all books, so they are no longer deluded by others.

If one is a noble-minded gentleman with a sincere heart for destiny, sweeping aside all side doors, valuing the taming of the mind-monkey, reaffirming resolve and qi, humbling the heart and lowering the intent, enduring demonic trials and hardships, diligently seeking an enlightened teacher, and exhaustively pursuing the origin of the body’s first reception of qi—this "origin" is the primordial ancestral qi, which unites with a single point of true yang and true yin. Without true yang and true yin, born before heaven and earth, at the inception of the primordial chaos, this luminous millet-grain treasure pearl hangs in the void, radiant and resplendent. Yet without an enlightened teacher to point it out, one remains as if in a drunken dream; missing this single step, all else is but side doors.

This luminous treasure pearl, within the lightning of the void, encompasses all phenomena, conceals all existence, and gives rise to all things—all from this single grain. In the Daoist tradition, it is called true lead and true mercury. Once truly attained, one must not seek it in heaven and earth, sun and moon, or male and female, but only within the body’s inner and outer crucible and furnace, refining the self and upholding the heart. When principle is understood and nature is seen, the fire is gathered and ignited, and in less than half a moment, the millet-grain mystery pearl appears above the winding river. With a single dose of the elixir taken, in an instant, one aperture opens and a hundred meridians align; the entire body’s sinews and bones, the five viscera and flesh, all transform into qi, resembling external mercury. At this stage, a hundred days of fire cultivation bring wondrous efficacy. Once attained, there is no regression—abiding in the world, preserving form, refining spirit to return to the void, and uniting with the Dao.

In the Buddhist tradition, this is called true emptiness and the wondrous dharmakāya. With precise application, refining demons to see nature, in a brief moment, the true fire of samādhi arises, returning to the origin and restoring unity. The earth becomes treasure, radiant with myriad rays of light; the six supernatural powers of the correct eye manifest, forging the indestructible vajra body and accomplishing the unfathomable wonders beyond ghosts and spirits.

In the Confucian tradition, it is called the Supreme Ultimate born of the Non-Ultimate. Considering the external heaven and earth, the Non-Ultimate is the vast expanse surrounding heaven and earth before the separation of sun and moon, the four directions and above and below, a chaotic mist like yin fog and water vapor. Only when the time arrives and qi reaches fullness, clashing together, does the Supreme Ultimate emerge. At that moment, sun and moon are born, the clear and turbid separate—above becomes heaven, below becomes earth. Heaven’s clear qi is pure yang; earth’s turbid qi is pure yin. Rain and dew descend from heaven, for yang can generate yin; the myriad things arise from earth, for yin can generate yang. Heaven and earth are but emptiness, containing boundless and limitless potential. Heaven’s stars and deities, in their movements and revolutions, each hold their positions; earth’s myriad things, following the four seasons and eight solar terms, naturally arise—all, in essence, are but the void.

The sun and moon are the essence of heaven and earth, illuminating the thirty-three heavens above and the nine abysses and ten thousand springs below, revolving east and west, ascending and descending, cycling through cold and heat. The sun is a body of pure yang, containing a single point of true yin essence, belonging to the ancient dragon, the maiden, wood of *jia*, mercury, the golden horse, and the three *hun*—this is the outer. The moon is a body of pure yin, containing a single point of true yang qi, belonging to the white tiger, the infant, metal of *geng*, cinnabar, the jade hare, and the seven *po*—this is the inner. The human body’s creation mirrors heaven and earth, thus the human body also possesses a true sun and moon. The Dao is near—why seek it afar?

The three *hun* belong to nature, which resides at the edge of heaven; the seven *po* belong to destiny, which lies at the bottom of the sea. The inner and outer unite in the two words "nature and destiny," resolving the myriad volumes of alchemical texts. Nature pertains to spirit and is yin; destiny pertains to qi and is yang. Thus it is said, "One yin and one yang is called the Dao." The thousands of classics and volumes are but different names; yet true nature and destiny, along with illusory phenomena, remain unknown without true transmission.

Ancient immortals said, "The four great elements of the body all belong to yin—what then is yang essence?" They also said, "Tears, saliva, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and marrow—these seven numinous substances all belong to it," yet these are but the turbid yin of postnatal dregs, not true yin. True yin and true yang stand in opposition; if true yin is unknown, how can true yang be known? Today’s scholars not only do not know true yang but also do not know true yin. If they knew true yin, they would surely know true yang. Without encountering an enlightened teacher, how could they ever fathom it?

Scholars must exhaustively pursue the wonders of the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—within the body, as well as the true crucible and furnace within and without, and the true messages of yin and yang within and without. Without grasping the essential meaning, upon seeing the various names in books, the mind lacks certainty, clinging to side doors without discernment. Without understanding principle, the heart remains unclear; with an unclear heart, one cannot see nature; without seeing nature, how can one reach destiny? The ancients said, "Only because the golden elixir lacks oral instructions, where can you form the spiritual embryo?"

The *Pointer to Ascending Heaven* states: The Dao generates heaven and earth, nurtures the myriad things. When released, it encompasses the void; when gathered, it retreats into secrecy. The Two Modes, sun and moon, and the Five Phases are but the transformations within the Dao.

Each thing possesses a Supreme Ultimate—this is the Dao. Within every person’s heart lies the primordial, which is also the Dao. The Five Phases flow forward to give birth to humans and creatures; they reverse to produce immortals and buddhas. Thus it is said, “When the Five Phases flow forward, the dharma-realm becomes a fiery pit; when they reverse, the great earth yields its seven treasures.” The essence of the Five Phases is concealed in the secret place of the Four Great Form-Mountains, neither inside nor outside—merely what common folk use daily without awareness.

The people may be made to follow, for this is the forward flow; they cannot be made to know, for that is the reverse flow. Just as a fish in water does not recognize the power of water, a person within the qi-mechanism does not recognize the power of qi. This analogy should be pondered deeply: turn the light inward, reflect back, illuminate the mind and see nature—then to realize the fruit of immortality or buddhahood, what difficulty remains?

Yet today’s Dao-seekers, each one, sell their own cleverness, boast of their own cleverness, claim mastery—yet none awaken. There is also a class of shallow-rooted blind men who, upon seeing the sages speak of outer yin-yang, outer furnace and tripod, outer medicinal substances, fixate on women as the tripod-vessel—how lamentable! I have seen those who ardently pursue furnace-fire, yet none succeed. Some cite the Yellow Emperor casting nine tripods to attain the Dao and assume nine people must be used as tripods—how utterly mistaken! I have witnessed those who have passed through five or seven tripods yet achieved nothing.

Moreover, with the first stirring of a thought, primordial simplicity scatters; once the primordial is lost, even if the later heaven remains, what benefit is there to body and mind? It merely sustains the Four Great for a time. Such fools—how could they know the marvel of heaven’s wordless operation, where the four seasons proceed and the hundred things arise!

The human body’s transformations mirror those of heaven and earth. Yet one does not know: how does heaven attain oneness to become clear? How does earth attain oneness to become tranquil? Nor does one know who presides over these transformations. If one can take clarity and stillness as essence, stability as foundation, the celestial mind as master, and original spirit as function—skillfully employing the thief-mechanism to return to primordial truth, return to the root and recover destiny—how could one not attain the sage’s position between heaven and earth?

As for the matter of using a literary tripod, there is no such principle. If a blessed practitioner meets a true teacher, they should first practice the Jade Fluid Returning Elixir, refine the self and harmonize the light, maintain and nurture, turn the light inward and reflect—this is the work of seeing nature and illuminating the mind. Having seen nature, one then seeks the higher work: the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, where emotions return to nature, reaching the position of true emptiness. The great function manifests, the Dragon Girl offers a single precious pearl, and golden light appears—only then is there one attainment that becomes eternal.

At the juncture of *hai* and *zi*, between *bo* and *fu*, when the first stirring of the Great Yang begins, one’s hand explores the Moon Grotto, one’s foot treads the Celestial Root, and the returning wind merges—from this arises the wondrous efficacy of a hundred days’ work. This is the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, the great Dao of yin-yang and the Five Phases.

Apart from the Jade Fluid and Golden Fluid, the dual cultivation of nature and destiny, and the Dao of clarity and spontaneity, all else are side doors and minor methods.

I have established the furnace and tripod within and without the body, gathered the oral instructions on gathering and refining, and grasped the subtleties of medicinal substances and firing times. Yet without knowing the celestial dharma-measure, one enters the chamber, takes the outer medicine into the abdomen for the great work, and begins the firing practice. At the secret place, the empty void’s myriad spirits pay homage, and immortal music plays above the crown—this matter is too profound for even gods and ghosts to comprehend. Alas, because one has not refined the self amid worldly dust, nor accumulated lead in the marketplace, the qi-channels are not yet fully stabilized, the foundation is not yet complete in three aspects, the principle is understood but nature remains unseen—thus myriad phenomena arise dangerously. The heart-spirit is unsettled, unable to take command. Moreover, without knowing companions or Dao-friends outside to protect and guard, one is startled by sounds and sights, the original spirit scatters, the tripod overturns, the furnace flips, the Heart-Monkey falters, the Intent-Horse flees, spirit does not guard the abode, qi does not return to the origin—one encounters yin-demons.

What are yin-demons? I will not elaborate here, but later learners do not know: once true yang scatters, yin qi takes control. Day and night within the body, spirits and ghosts cause harm. Whether eyes are open or closed, one sees ghosts and spirits coming and going; even in the ears, one hears their clamor. By day, one may still endure, but at night it is most unbearable—one cannot remain still for a moment. The life-master in the Sea of Qi, the *dui*-metal’s *wu*-earth, surges back, and the five viscera’s qi and blood all rise upward. The body lifts, no longer touching the ground—this is truly the ghostly realm’s livelihood, leading to the destruction of body and life.

I temporarily abandoned my previous efforts, followed my teacher’s guidance, concealed myself deeply in the marketplace, accumulated lead amid worldly dust, gathered emotions back to nature, and reversed the killing mechanism. From youth to old age, heaven, earth, and beings had stolen my primordial truth—now, within the formless and amidst worldly dust, I must seize and steal it back into my celestial nature. Only then are the Three Originals—original essence, original qi, original spirit—complete. Only then are the heart illuminated, principle understood, nature seen, body and mind stabilized, and the Five Phases gathered. Only then can one proceed to the highest work and complete the great Dao.

Reflecting on the worthy sages of former times, many abandoned their path midway, all because they had not refined the self and stabilized the heart, nor brought metal back to nature. Thus, in the second phase of obtaining the medicine, during the fourth phase of advancing the fire, not knowing the celestial dharma-measure and acting carelessly, even White Jade Toad lamented, “Again I must cut the autumn bamboo’s joints.”

Who knows the subtleties of the empty void—how perilous, how fierce, how malevolent? If one cannot seize and control it, it will certainly not spare you. If a learner clearly understands the two true messages within and without the body, without obstruction, then proceeds to maintain and nurture, eliminate self-centeredness, and restore celestial principle—then the work of returning the elixir becomes most simple and easy.

All day long they gather the yellow sprouts beyond their body, awaiting the celestial jade nectar—this is precisely the wondrous awakening of "drinking wine and wearing flowers" to attain immortality. Yet in the matter of Primordial Unity, there is no intention, no insistence, no fixation, no self; whether living or dying, one forgets both people and things, like an idle wanderer who neglects livelihood, roaming streets and alleys all day, delighting in sights and soothing the heart, sitting vacant in brothels and taverns, wordless and unmoving—how could this not astonish and perplex the world! To gather the environment and accumulate lead, employing both method and wealth—how could this not invite the ridicule and slander of the vulgar!

Thus, one must rely on powerful families in great cities for external protection, preserving the Dao in daily practice while concealing one’s light and obscuring one’s traces. As the ancient immortals said: *"To covet the treasure of heaven, one must use the wealth of the world."* Yet the "treasure of heaven" does not refer to the vault of the blue sky—it is the abode of the Nine Yang Cauldron within our own body. Thus, the Yellow Emperor cast the Nine Tripods and ascended. Deluded fools of this world, upon hearing the phrase "treasure of heaven," cling to the sun and moon in the sky as water and fire, waiting for the moon to rise in the west to gather its degrees with their eyes, calling it true water and true lead; or at sunrise in the east, they likewise collect it with their gaze, calling it true fire and true mercury.

Yet heaven above and earth below, Qian and Kun, Kan and Li, the inner and outer furnaces of male and female—these are all metaphors for the inner and outer yin and yang of our own body, without any actual form of male or female. As the ancient immortals said: *"All that has form is but illusion."* The returning elixir has no substance—how profound and exhaustive are these words!

Those in the world who cultivate goodness never do harm to others for personal gain. What men and women in the universe rely upon to live without dying is nothing but this single point of yang essence. How could those who seek immortality steal a woman’s essence to benefit their own body? How would this differ from those who kill? The earlier sages spoke of "that household’s male and female," "the two families and two nations," and "the inner and outer furnaces"—if one does not receive the correct transmission, how few would not mistake their meaning!

I once met an enlightened teacher who, through direct instruction, revealed the two true messages within and beyond the void. Not daring to keep this secret for myself, I transgress the prohibitions to pass it on, unfolding the creation of heaven, earth, and humanity within the body. The Three Teachings’ scriptures, the medicines and firing times, the conjunctions of sun and moon, the measures of fullness—all are laid bare. No texts are established; only true words are spoken, so that learners may avoid the errors of misguided practice.

Wherever this book resides, spiritual beings guard it. If those without affinity encounter it, it will be no more than blind recitation. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is rarely met even in ten thousand kalpas—*"trampled straw sandals find no trace, yet it comes with no effort at all."* If learners can truly nurture it amid haste, turmoil, displacement, and hardship, preserving this square inch of the heart without loss, then the celestial principle is restored. Once the celestial principle is restored, then seeking the matter of the superior external medicine entering the abdomen becomes instantaneous—suddenly, one is serene, shedding the mortal coil and changing bones, wholly transformed into a single golden light, the great earth becoming treasure. A body is born beyond the body, the yang spirit leaves the form, nurtured in emptiness and void—this is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons, attaining boundless freedom, transcending the three kalpas of wind, water, and fire, no longer subject to birth, aging, sickness, death, or suffering.

Yet people today do not cultivate practice, instead coveting external elixirs of furnace and fire to consume—this is the height of delusion.

**Commentary on the *Nine Augusts’ Elixir Canon: Dragon-Tiger Lead-Mercury Treatise***
The Daoist Lord’s discourse on the extraction and replenishment of dragon-tiger lead and mercury is meant for those of the future with roots and affinity to begin here. Though it is said, *"Only immortals can become immortals,"* I insist: *"Even mortals can become immortals."* The only fear is not understanding the principle of the Golden Elixir—then one falls into hell as a beast.

This dragon belongs to yang; once yang is lost, all becomes yin. This tiger belongs to yin; yet within yin’s treasure lies a single yang. The dragon is the mysterious pass of my own body; the tiger is the mysterious gate of the other. The dragon is lascivious, but I do not leak—adding a drop of water to a speck of earth forms the character *yao* (瑶), becoming the supreme treasure of jade liquid. The tiger is voracious, but I do not leak—adding the character *jian* (柬) to *zhen* (真) forms *lian* (炼), gathering the supreme treasure of golden liquid.

Tiger, tiger, tiger—no matter how you bare your fangs and gape your jaws, striking terror into souls, I have the art of taming tigers, reducing you to emptiness within form and form within emptiness. With a single play of the dragon, you become the meeting of dragon and tiger in wind and cloud—I need not fear you will not yield the tiger’s cub from your den, entering my three fields.

Dragon, dragon, dragon—no matter how lustful you are, I have the art of subduing dragons. No matter how endless your transformations, I use Nezha’s vajra ring to bind you, drawing your sinews into a golden belt for nurturing nature and connecting life, worn always. I need not fear you will not go before the True Person of the Great Ultimate to beg for the unparalleled Dharma-door of the True One, merging with me into the Great Dao of Primordial Unity.

Lead is the lead of the two crescents; mercury is the mercury of heaven and earth within my body. With the radiance of sun and moon, heaven and earth become Earth-Heaven Peace, not Heaven-Earth Obstruction. Since birth from our parents, we originally possess one mercury and one lead—the principle of male-female union. Thus it is said: *"Qian is father, Kun is mother; male and female unite their essence, and the myriad things transform into purity."* The *Book of Changes* is the Great Ultimate of the primordial. If one does not understand this principle, merely casting mercury into lead, one begets sons and daughters; but casting lead into mercury, one becomes a Buddha or immortal.

The iron steamed bun can be shattered—how then could the Three Peaks within Three Peaks be unattainable?

**Annotation on Lü Zu’s *Hundred-Character Stele*:**

**Nurture qi and forget speech; guard the One.**
All who cultivate the Way must first nurture qi.
The method of nurturing qi lies in forgetting the ancient temple’s One.
Forget speech, and qi does not scatter; guard the One, and spirit does not depart.
The secret says: *"Seal the tongue and still the mind; embrace spirit and settle intent."*

**Subdue the heart to act without acting.**
The human heart is ever restless.
For the cultivator, stilling the heart is paramount—this is achieved by mastering the two eyes.
The eyes are the gates of the heart; one must lower the lids and seal the orifices.
All matters are governed by the heart as a sword: reflect that worldly affairs bring no benefit, and like a raging fire, they are instantly extinguished—do not cling to them.
The secret says: *"With the eyes gaze at the nose, with the nose gaze at the navel; above and below attend to one another, the mind’s point abides in unity. Focus intent on the Mysterious Pass, and thoughts are subdued."*

**In movement and stillness, know the Ancestral Origin.**
Movement and stillness are the interplay of yin and yang.
The Ancestral Origin is the source of one’s birth.
The cultivator must know that before parents gave form, there was the Mystery of Transformation.
From head to foot, the body is the great robe of Qian and Kun; the convergence of the Five Phases and Four Images is the state before Heaven and Earth divided—a single luminous spark formed the Great Ultimate.
Below the heart and above the kidneys, within the indistinct space where thoughts arise without cease—this is the Ancestral Origin.
Movement and stillness mean harmonizing true qi and settling the true origin.
Exhaling connects to the Heavenly Root; inhaling connects to the Earthly Root—closing the gate is Kun, opening the gate is Qian.
On exhalation, the dragon roars and clouds arise; on inhalation, the tiger howls and wind is born.
With each opening and closing, movement and stillness, the heart’s intent remains unmoved, allowing true breath to come and go, continuous as if present.
Refine the breath until it becomes the breath of no-breath, forged into oneness—then spirit may congeal, and the elixir may be achieved.

**Why seek another when nothing remains to be done?**
If one can nurture qi, forget speech, and guard the One, subduing body and mind so that spirit returns to the Cavern Chamber, intent fixed within the compass, merging into a single mystery—like a hen brooding an egg, like a dragon nurturing its pearl, ever present, never departing—then with time and deep practice, naturally the millet-grain pearl will appear, radiant as the sun, silently transforming the original spirit, its numinous clarity unfathomable. This is it.

**The True Constant must respond to things; in responding, do not be deluded.**
This Dao is the True Constant, yet in engaging with affairs, one is easily bewildered. Thus, in meeting the world, one must not be lost in mundane matters.
If one does not engage, one falls into emptiness and void.
One must respond when things arise and let them go when they depart.
To be upright and luminous is to avoid delusion; the true nature is pure and still, the original spirit congealed.
The secret says: *"Intent misplaced, all is error; non-action falls into emptiness. When the nature is not deluded, it abides; when the nature abides, qi naturally returns."*

The human nature is fierce as fire—joy, anger, sorrow, and delight; love, aversion, desire, and hatred—ever-changing, shifting without constancy. At the slightest provocation, false thoughts arise, making it difficult to still the nature.
One must truly restrain anger, and fire descends; truly reduce desire, and water ascends.
When the body does not move, this is refining essence; refining essence makes the tiger roar, and the original spirit solidifies.
When the heart does not move, this is refining qi; refining qi makes the dragon sing, and the original qi is preserved.
When intent does not move, this is refining spirit; refining spirit makes the two qi merge, the Three Origins blend, and the original qi naturally returns.
The Three Origins are essence, qi, and spirit; the two qi are yin and yang.
When the cultivator responds to things without delusion, the original spirit returns of itself, and the true nature abides.
When the nature abides, the body’s precelestial qi returns, life is restored to its root—what difficulty remains?
The secret says: *"Turn the light inward, focus the mind within; inner thoughts do not stray out, outer thoughts do not enter. When qi returns, the elixir forms of itself; within the crucible, Kan and Li unite."*

When the cultivator’s nature is not deluded by worldly affairs, qi returns of itself. Then one witnesses the two vapors ascending and descending in the Central Palace, yin and yang uniting in the elixir crucible. Suddenly, a thread of hot qi from the kidneys surges into the heart’s palace, passion returns to nature—like husband and wife in union, enraptured and intoxicated.
The two qi intertwine, forming the elixir’s substance, as water and fire in the Cavern Chamber intermingle in endless circulation. Then spirit rides the qi, and qi lodges in form—no need for miscellaneous arts to attain longevity.
The secret says: *"The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—seal and do not let them open. The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and wandering, guarding the compass within."*
Until the qi fills the Cinnabar Field and the *daogui* is formed.

**Yin and yang reverse their flow, and a thunderous transformation resounds.**
At this stage, spirit does not stray outward, qi does not leak away. Spirit returns to the Cavern Chamber, Kan and Li have merged. With ever-greater vigor and dedication, one reaches the utmost emptiness and guards stillness with utmost sincerity. The body is still within the profound darkness, the heart is clear in the realm of nothingness—then true breath abides of itself, the hundred vessels cease their movement, the sun and moon halt their passage, the Jade Pivot ceases to turn. The Great Ultimate is still and generates movement; yang arises in Kun of the southwest.
Kun is the abdomen, also called the Winding River.
Suddenly, a luminous spark the size of a millet grain appears—this is the sign of the medicine’s birth.
A brilliant light shines through; the two kidneys boil like a cauldron, the bladder burns like fire. Within the abdomen, the roar of a fierce wind; within the belly, the sound of thunder.
This is the Heavenly Root of the *Fu* hexagram manifesting.
When the Heavenly Root appears, stir the heart’s five with spirit to assist it—then the medicine blazes like fire through metal, ascending to pierce the *weilu*. Lightly guide it, silently raise it.
A mass of harmonious qi, like thunder’s crash, ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, the whole body leaping—this is the *Guai* hexagram of Heaven and Wind.

From the Moon Grotto to the Hall of Seals between the brows, primordial light leaks forth—this is the Supreme Polarity moving to generate yin. It transforms into divine water, sweet dew, within which a millet-grain pearl descends into the Yellow Court. There it touches the numinous mercury within *Li*, forging the body of the sacred form, completing one cycle of the celestial fire’s timing. Steep it, refine it. The elixir coalesces of itself.

White clouds gather at the crown; sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru. At this stage, the medicine is attained. The two qi congeal into a *daogui*; the passes and orifices open. Fire descends, water ascends—one stream circulates. From the Supreme Polarity’s movement, the Heavenly Root passes the Dark Valley Pass, ascends the twenty-four vertebral joints, reaches the Heavenly Valley Pass. At the Moon Grotto, yin arises, fragrant and sweet, descending the Tower of Nine Stories without cease—this is called *Sweet Dew Sprinkles Mount Sumeru*.

The formula says: When the mouth is full of sweet dew, send it with the eyes, receive it with the mind, guide it down to the elixir crucible, and congeal the primordial qi to nurture it. Drinking the Wine of Immortality oneself—who could know this freedom!

At this stage of nurturing qi, the joints have opened, and the divine water ceaselessly circulates up and down. In constant ebb and flow, it is swallowed from time to time—this is called the Wine of Immortality.

The formula says: Flowing pearls irrigate and nourish the numinous root’s nature—does the cultivator know or not?

Sitting, one hears the music of no-strings; the mechanism of creation and transformation becomes lucid. At this level of practice, the ears catch the strains of celestial music, the rhythms of bells and drums. The five qi pay homage to the origin; the three flowers gather at the crown, like evening crows alighting. The heart’s field opens, wisdom arises of itself, the scriptures of the Three Teachings become clear. One silently comprehends the roots of past lives, foresees future fortunes and misfortunes. The great earth and mountains and rivers lie in the palm of the hand; the gaze spans ten thousand miles. The six penetrations’ wonders are attained—this is no illusion.

I have truly reached this stage in my practice. Were I to speak falsely and mislead later learners, Heaven would surely punish me. To encounter this and not practice incurs heavenly retribution. Without meeting a teacher, this matter is difficult to know.

In all, twenty verses—truly the ladder to Heaven. From *Nurturing Qi, Forgetting Words* to these twenty verses, all are the authentic oral formulas of Ancestor Lü, without a trace of falsehood, the very steps to ascend to Heaven in cultivation.

Those who awaken to this formula and its commentary should hasten to practice it. Do not recklessly leak it, nor show it to the unworthy, lest you incur heavenly retribution. Cherish and uphold it, and you will ascend to the Heavenly Palace.
