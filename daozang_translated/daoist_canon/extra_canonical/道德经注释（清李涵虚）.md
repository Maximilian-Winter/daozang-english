**The True Transmission of Laozi**
*Preface*

The Immortals take Laozi as their master.
In his conduct through life, Laozi never contended with others.
Externally, he abandoned fame and wealth; internally, he nurtured life and longevity.
Serene, harmonious, tranquil, and effortless—his nature flowed without contrivance.

Yet, though he taught *wuwei* (non-action), the myriad heterodox and deceitful arts—frantic, bizarre, and cunning—were never his doctrine.
When he spoke of *ziran* (naturalness), his actions aligned with truth and reason, embodying the Way of Transformation and moving with its rhythms.

He guarded the central void, observing emptiness without attachment.
He attained emptiness, preserved stillness, and hid deeply like the void itself.
Neither boasting of wonders nor establishing distinctions, history thus records him as an ancient recluse.

The *Dao De Jing*’s five thousand words draw upon ancient speech to establish its teachings.
It governs the world and cultivates the self—both are applicable.

We, in our daily reading of the *Dao De Jing*, though not fully grasping its depths, still aspire to emulate its spirit and conduct.

In secluded mountains and remote valleys, a few kindred souls wander companions, moving through mist and clouds, staff in hand, singing of sacred transformation—unaware, unknowing, yet following the Emperor’s [Heaven’s] patterns. This is but our humble retreat.

One day, wandering through the Daoist observatories, I found several volumes of *The Outer History of Yuanqiao*, expounding on the art of prolonging life—never straying from Laozi’s Way.
Among them was *Thirteen Classics Commentary*, all Laozi’s works.
The commentary on the *Dao De Jing* was the most meticulous.
At its end, *The Nine-Layer Path* was appended—even more straightforward and accessible. I inquired of a Daoist priest: *“Who is Master Shuxia?”*
He replied: *“He hides among farmers.”*
I then sought Master Shuxia at Juanshan, and he proved a kindred spirit in the Daoist tradition, imparting the true essence.
Upon returning, I published the *Thirteen Classics* in the marketplace, as a token of my gratitude for his benevolence.
Externally, I printed and distributed the *Dao De Jing* and *Nine-Layer Path* to the Lin Palace monasteries.

This work, though concise, contains the complete essence.
We few can practice it easily, perfecting ourselves and others—here lies its power.

Moreover, recalling the saying *“Those who receive the book as disciples”*:
Each follows their own Daoist lineage, establishing names beyond the world, like the great rivers flowing into streams and brooks.

Zixia received teachings from Huizong, and we inherit from Zixia—thus, our lineage is clear.

Alas! In the affairs of Heaven and Earth, those like us—simple folk—need not contend, nor can we.

「Master Dao Yu is now seventy, Master Dao Sheng is nearing ancient old age, and Master Dao He is no longer a youth. Within the mountains and forests, what joy could there be? Only by bearing this single commentary on the *Dao De Jing* and this one treatise of the *Nine-Layer Path* do we find delight, singing long songs in the cliffs and valleys, our voices echoing to silence the clouds of the streams. Each of us forgets our names and the cycles of time.

In the month of *Rui* (mid-autumn) of the *Zun* cycle (1899), the three recluses of Shu Mountain recognized Dao Guang’s gentle and profound essence. Pure Yang Master prefaced the *Dao De Jing*, advocating *wu wei* (non-action) in action. The *Justice* commentary elucidates without contrivance. The Dao Ancestors transmitted it, and the Dao descendants expounded upon it—thus, the Great Dao becomes ever clearer here.

Among them, there is the *Hanyuzi* (Embracing the Void), a man of transcendent talent. His *Jin Shu* (Golden Book) was revealed in dreams, born in a humble home beneath a tree. He dwells in the *Juan Shan* (卷山), passing down a tradition of sincerity and purity. The *Zai Shi* (載錫) jade tablet was indeed fitting for him. As a youth, he attained sudden enlightenment; as an adult, he practiced profound meditation. Once reading *The Outer History of the Fang Hu* (方壶外史), he secretly aspired to attain the True and enter the Mysterious, standing beside the Master Lu (陸子) at my side.

I heard of him and sought him out. He introduced himself as a Daoist of *Wu Shan* (吾山), and with *Qian Xu* (潛虚), I accompanied him to observe his spirit and resolve. He resided in obscurity on the eastern slopes of *E Peak* (峨峰), serene and quiet, speaking little, unmoved by honor and profit. He often satisfied his aspirations with a single lute.

After meeting him, I remained with him for years, during which he spoke to me of the *Heavy Mysterious* (重玄) teachings, and I understood them instantly. Thus, he exerted his talent and strength, composing *The Outer History of the Yuan Shao* (圆峤外史), a counterpart to Master Lu’s *Fang Hu* (方壶).

Therefore, where Master Lu has *The Theory of Mysterious Skin* (玄肤论), here we have *The Discussion on Daoist Insights* (道窍谈); where Master Lu has *The Chapter on Rectification* (就正篇), here we have *The Treatise on Following the Dao* (循途说). These are all texts of the Clear and True Dao. Yet his most wondrous work is the commentary on the *Dao De Jing*, which is indeed a beacon for all ages, named *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义), rivaling Master Lu’s *The Supplementary Notes on the Southern Flower* (南华副墨). If these two Masters are considered, they may truly be called those who excel in discussing Laozi and Zhuangzi.

Now, those who comment on this scripture have five flaws and three virtues. The five flaws are: favoring discussions of governing the world, the first. Favoring discussions of cultivating the body, the second. Some may say the Dao encompasses both body and world, yet their words lack coherence and ultimately stray into error, the third. Not understanding the true practice of the Great Dao, they first demand the people’s peace and the nation’s wealth before achieving *wu wei* (non-action), and if they immediately discuss purity and stillness, they will inevitably fall into emptiness, the fourth. Not recognizing the profound power of the Great Dao, they insist on returning to the root and obeying the command, thus counting as *you wei* (action). If they immediately discuss the sacred and divine, they will inevitably become like mere hymns, the fifth.

What are the three virtues? The first is that his commentary aligns with the inner and outer aspects of the Dao, dividing it into primary and supplementary, thereby illuminating the scripture’s expansive meaning. The second is that his teachings are sequential and interwoven, ensuring the scripture’s principles are thoroughly connected. The third is that his heart holds true understanding, and his words are unobstructed by *Chan* (禅) barriers, allowing the scripture’s meaning to shine forth.

I have often lamented that the essence of the *Dao De Jing* has not been made clear throughout the world. I wished to write a commentary to explain it, yet even now, I feel inadequate. Now, seeing *Hanyuzi*’s exposition, it possesses the three virtues without the five flaws. If his work had appeared a thousand years earlier, all other commentaries could have been unnecessary, and Daoists would not need to speak further.

Thus, I rejoice in presenting it and marking its significance, storing it in the sacred mountains and passing it to those of noble resolve. The purpose of my annotations is also to borrow the truth of his commentary, supplement what I have not yet explained, and demonstrate it through my own annotations.

**Poem on *The Eastern Justice* (东来正义)**
The Revered Daoist Huizong first established the preface and commentary—
His own preface uniquely opens the gate to virtue.

Again, I see the Purple Qi from Guanzhong arrive,
Directly observing the Jade Son beneath the plum tree.

He wishes to teach the later generations to measure the Dao together,
And can make the Primordial Dao yet more honored.

How many commentators lack such a foundation?
The treasure is long protected, guarding the Kunlun peaks.

—By *Yuzhu Right Minister* (玉枢右相), *Taoqing Master of the Great Mystery* (太清洞玄校理), practicing merit and demerit, concurrently selecting matters of the Dao and the Immortal, the *Xuanxuan Daoist of Liaodong* (辽东玄玄道人), and disciple Zhang Quan Yi (侍友张全一) who inscribed this at Qingfu (青阜).

One commentary can reveal the Dao’s profound mysteries—
Again, I see the Purple Qi arriving from the East.

Strumming the lute and playing the flute, a true gentleman,
Discussing the scripture and expounding the law, a master of eloquence.

I dwell in the Fang Hu, playing with the boundless sea,
You ascend the Yuan Shao, dominating the Penglai peaks.

Today, we sit together on the riverside pavilion,
Reciting the *Southern Flower* (南华) while laughing at our own folly.

—By *True Scripture of the Three Pure Ones* (三清总校真函), concurrently recording the secrets of the *Tongtian* (洞天), *Master of Universal Salvation* (文明普度先生), *Eastern Dao Ancestor* (东派祖师), *Fellow of the Immortal Histories Hall* (同仙史馆), and junior disciple Lu Xixing (愚弟陆西星) who inscribed this.

The body resides in the Cloud Mountains, the Dao within oneself—
The depths of spirit and *qi* are most profound and mighty.

At Qingdao, the strict *Zhi* (驰) is externally practiced,
While the flames are stilled in the *Dantian* (丹田), guarding the inner stillness.

People call him the Great Abbot,
I jokingly name him Lord of the Long Wall.

Leaning on the *Dao De Jing*’s commentary and annotations,
His enlightenment of all scriptures is equally profound.

—By *Heavenly Immortal Baiqiong Guan* (天仙白琼管) who inscribed this.

**Commentary on the *Dao De Jing* (*The Eastern Justice* (东严正义))**
Written by the owner of the *Zixia Cave* (紫霞洞) in *Yuan Shao Mountain* (圆峤山), *Hanyuzi* (涵虚生), and perfumed by respectful dedication.

Published by Daoist disciples Zhu Dao Sheng (朱道生) and Li Dao Yu (李道育), revised at the *Yueyang Pavilion* (岳阳楼). Chapter One.»

The **Dao** that can be spoken of is not the eternal **Dao**;
The **name** that can be named is not the eternal **name**.

The **Dao** is that which, internally, governs the self,
Externally, governs the world—
The **Way** of daily life, ever practiced.

The **Dao** in its hidden depths is beyond speech,
Yet when it manifests, it can be spoken of.
It encompasses manifestation within concealment,
Boundless yet infinitesimal—
Thus, the **Dao** is the **Dao** beyond the ordinary.

The **name** in the formless void is beyond naming,
Yet when it emerges in the **Tai Ji** (太极), it can be named.
It generates the **Tai Ji** from the void—
Capable of stillness, capable of motion—
Thus, the **name** is the **name** beyond the ordinary.

**Collective Annotation:** What all follow is called the **Dao**.
What can be spoken of is what can be described.
The **Dao** beyond the ordinary—this is the **Great Dao**.

To mark its form, one speaks of **name**.
What can be named is what can be likened.
The **name** beyond the ordinary—this is the **name** without fixed designation.

---
The **nameless** is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
The **named** is the mother of all things.

**Nameless:** That is the **Wu Ji** (无极).
**Named:** That is the **Tai Ji**.

From non-being to being—
This is the true **nameless** without fixed designation.

In the primordial **Wu Ji**, undifferentiated,
No signs, no form—
Originally beyond likeness of sound or scent,
Thus the **Dao** is at the beginning of Heaven and Earth.

After the **Tai Ji** manifests distinctly,
There is birth, there is nurturing—
Evidence of creation’s workings,
Thus the **Dao** is the mother of all things.

**All things**—
Encompassing Heaven and Earth in totality.
Before Heaven and Earth, this **Dao** exists,
Giving rise to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all beings—
Like a great parent, beyond compare.
Speaking of mother, yet father is implied within.

---
Thus, to observe its subtlety, one must be ever without desire,
To observe its limits, one must be ever with desire.

**Subtlety**—that which is **nameless**—thus still,
Ever quiet to observe it.
**Limits**—that which is **named**—thus dynamic,
Ever responsive to observe it.
Without desire, with desire—
Ever still, ever responsive.

To observe the **nameless** with no desire,
To observe the **named** with desire.
The **Dan** (alchemical) school regards the **Xuan Guan** (玄关) as the subtle orifice of **having** and **non-being**,
For it is rooted in this principle.

---
These two—
Same origin, yet different names,
Both called **Xuan** (玄).
**Xuan**, again **Xuan**—
The gateway to all subtleties.

**Two**—that is the **subtlety of the orifice**.
Being arises from non-being—
Same origin, yet non-being transforms into being—
Different names, yet still the same.

The **orifice of having and non-being**—
Both are **Xuan**.
Observing subtlety with no desire—
One **Xuan** attained.
Observing the orifice with desire—
Another **Xuan** attained.
Two **Xuans** converge into one **Xuan**.
**Xuan** encompasses all subtleties—
The gateway to all subtleties lies here.

**Chapter Two**
(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on Nurturing the Body*, alternatively *Chapter on Beauty and Virtue*.)

---
All under Heaven know beauty when it is called beauty—
Then ugliness arises;
All know virtue when it is called virtue—
Then non-virtue arises.

Thus, **having and non-being** generate each other,
Difficulty and ease complete one another,
Length and shortness define each other,
High and low contrast each other—
(*High* refers to elevation, *contrasting* refers to reversal.)

Sounds harmonize with one another,
Front and back follow one another.
(*"Node"* here is a variant of *"form"*—other editions read *"compare"* [较].)

**Already**—*stop* also, *depart* also, as in *The Broad Rhymes*.

Now, beauty and ugliness are most opposites.
Knowing beauty as beauty—then ugliness must cease.
Virtue and non-virtue are most distant.
Knowing virtue as virtue—then non-virtue must depart.

The **original purity** of humankind is all beauty and virtue.
Yet when stained by later **human desires**,
Then ugliness and non-virtue arise.

But one cannot fail to discard human desires
And seek one’s original purity.

Only by taking **emptiness and responsiveness** as essence,
And **transformation and motion** as function,
Does one attain:
Having arises from non-being, non-being from having;
First difficulty, then ease;
Length defines shortness, shortness defines length;
High and low reverse each other;
Same kinds seek each other, like sounds resonating;
The child follows behind—
The returning cycle descends before.

This is the **Dao of nurturing the body**.

Thus, the **Sage** dwells in **non-action**,
Practices **non-speech** teaching;
All things arise yet are not claimed,
Are born yet not possessed,
Are done yet not relied upon,
Are accomplished yet not dwelled upon.
Only by not dwelling does one not depart.

This follows from the previous discussion of nurturing the body.
The Sage’s nurturing of the body is **non-action**.
The Sage’s teaching is **non-speech**.
Dwelling in it fulfills one’s aspiration,
Practicing it yields inner attainment.
All things spontaneously arise, awaiting the Sage’s harmonization,
Yet the Sage does not claim them.
Not only does the Sage not claim them—
Even the merit of nurturing the people is not possessed by the Sage.
The merit of governance is not relied upon by the Sage.
When great deeds are accomplished, one rests—
As when the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao at Kongtong,
Or the Yu Emperor, weary, ascended to his throne.

Later heroes and outstanding figures,
Once their deeds were done, retired with courage—
None dwelled upon their achievements.
Not dwelling means not clinging.
Only by not clinging to deeds
Does one return to seek the Dao of nurturing the body.
Guarding the body without departing,
One becomes a **Perfect Person**.

Nurturing the body can govern the world,
Cultivating oneself can cultivate others—
Thus is it.

Who would say the **Dao of Laozi** is entirely about stillness and extinction?

**Chapter Three**
(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on Settling the People*, Peng’s edition titled *Chapter on Non-Action*)

Not elevating the worthy—so the people do not contend;
Not treasuring hard-to-obtain goods—so the people do not steal;
Not displaying what is desirable—so the heart does not乱.
Thus, the **Sage’s** governance:
Empties the heart, fills the belly,
Weakens the will, strengthens the bones.
Always keeping the people in **ignorance and desirelessness**,
So that even the wise dare not act.

Practice **non-action**, and nothing remains ungoverned.

The final passage of the previous chapter spoke of the Sage’s governance of the world,
How, once deeds were done, one did not dwell upon them,
But returned to seek the Dao of nurturing the body.

Yet even in governance, the **Dao** is this:
Not competing with the people in valuing the worthy,
Then the heart of contention fades, and the people do not contend.
Not competing with the people in valuing goods,
Then the heart of greed is severed, and the people do not steal.
Not displaying what is desirable while desiring it,
Then the heart of desire is removed.
The people’s hearts, thus, do not乱,
And the Sage’s heart, thus, does not乱.

The goodness of governing the world
All stems from the goodness of nurturing the body.
Thus, the Sage’s nurturing of the body,
Though **non-action**, is never without governance.

Names, profits, and desires all vanish—
Only guarding the **Middle** to empty the heart.
Names, profits, and desires all purified—
Only cultivating **qi** to fill the belly.
Moreover, the will gentle and yielding—
Using weakness as function;
The bones firm and strong—
Using strength as essence.
Making the body serene and unadorned,
In harmony with the world in **non-doing**.
Thus the people also remain in **ignorance and desirelessness**,
Embracing their **original simplicity**,
So that even the wise of the world cannot act,
Nor dare to act.

Thus is the **Sage’s** governance of **non-action**.

**Chapter Four**
(*River Above Master’s annotation* originally titled *Chapter on the Rootless*)

**Chapter Five**
(*The Way is void yet its use is inexhaustible.
Deep and vast, it seems the origin of all things.
Blunt its sharpness, unravel its tangles,
Dull its brilliance, harmonize with the dust.
Mysterious! As if it exists—
I know not whose child it is, yet it precedes the Sovereign-on-High.*)

The Sage’s **non-action** lies entirely in emptiness and its use.
**Void** is **emptiness**.
The Way employs emptiness in its use—
Its measure encompasses heaven and earth, yet never seems full;
Deep and vast, like the ancestral root of all things.
It blunts the world’s sharpness without harm,
Unravels its entanglements without toil—
For emptiness consumes sharpness and confusion.
It harmonizes with the world’s brilliance without obscuring,
Merges with its dust without defilement—
For emptiness forgets brilliance and dust.
Only its **void** essence remains,
Ever congealed in **mysterious** stillness—
As if it exists, yet truly stores nothing.
Ask who its child is, and you know its child—
Its name precedes the Sovereign-on-High?
Truly the **beginning without beginning**,
The **first of the Primordial**,
The **Heaven-before-Heaven**.

**Chapter Six**
(*Heaven and Earth are not kind;
They treat all things as fodder for dogs.*)

Heaven and Earth act without benevolence,
Yet fulfill all things’ needs.
Each thing takes what it requires,
Uses what it must.
Not-kindness is the utmost kindness—
If benevolence were required for their nurturing,
Then each thing would demand Heaven and Earth’s favor for birth,
A task impossible to exhaust.
Only by not providing fodder for beasts
Do beasts eat fodder.
Only by not feeding men their dogs
Do men feed their dogs.
Thus benevolence’s scope grows ever vast.
Speaking of fodder and dogs,
One may extend it to fruits, vegetables, chickens, and swine.

(*The Sage is not kind;
He treats the people as fodder for dogs.*)

The Sage aligns with Heaven and Earth’s **virtue**,
Letting the people each nurture themselves,
Each fulfill their own needs—
This is **non-action** achieving completion.

(*Between Heaven and Earth—
Is it not like a bellows?*
Empty yet unbroken,
Moving yet ever producing.
Much speech leads to exhaustion—
Better to guard the **Middle**.*)

Heaven, Earth, and the Sage
Do not contrive food and use for all things and people—
Yet all things and people naturally obtain their sustenance,
Through the **void** and **Middle**’s encompassing capacity.
Heaven and Earth divide into two realms,
Between which lies an empty, boundless space—
Like the bellows’ unfathomable depth,
The flute’s resonant passage.
**Qi** flows in and out, naturally without effort—
Thus emptiness can contain,
Unbroken by the myriad things.
Its capacity is boundless,
Moving yet silently functioning,
Ever expanding its full measure—
Its essence is inexhaustible.
Heaven and Earth do not speak,
Nor does the Sage.
If they spoke much,
Their words would be numbered,
And numbers could be exhausted—
Thus better to guard the **Middle**.

**Chapter Seven**
(*The **Valley Spirit** does not die—
This is called the **Mysterious Female**.
The **Mysterious Female’s** gate—
This is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
Endless, as if it exists—
Using it brings no toil.*)

The Sage guards the **Middle** to nurture the body,
For the **Valley Spirit** is the **original nature**.
**Valley** signifies **emptiness**,
**Spirit** signifies **numen**—
The nature, being empty and numinous, does not perish.
Not perishing is **not-death**.
Why call the **Valley Spirit** the **Mysterious Female**?
**Mysterious** is Heaven,
**Female** is Earth.
Heaven and Earth unite to form the **Mysterious Female**,
Between them lies an empty, boundless space.
The Confucian school names it **Hidden and Subtle**—
Within lies a realm unseen and unheard.
The Buddhist school names it **That**—
Within lies a truth beyond good and evil.
The Sage nurtures the body by borrowing the **Mysterious Female’s** empty void
To cultivate the **Valley Spirit’s** empty numen—
Thus the **Valley Spirit** names the **Mysterious Female**,
A naming drawn from its function.
One **Mysterious**, one **Female**—
One **Heaven**, one **Earth**.
Confucius said: *Is not Heaven-Earth the gateway of the **Changing**?*
*The **Paramount Concordance** says: “Heaven-Earth are the **Changing’s** threshold.”*
The **Two Cavities Method**—where golden **qi** converges—
This is the **Mysterious Female’s** gate.
Yin and Yang circulate within,
Kan and Li copulate there.
The chamber where man and woman merge their essence,
Where sun and moon exchange their light—
The Sage reverses this,
Making it the **Gate of Life**.
The common man follows it naturally,
Making it the **Door of Death**.
Earth-Heaven’s harmonious union
Encompasses nothing else.
Thus it is also called the **root of Heaven and Earth**—
The root where Heaven and Earth mutually conceal themselves.
The root of Heaven and Earth
Is the place to return to the origin,
To refine **qi** and transform **spirit**.
Endless, as if it exists—
This is nurturing the **Valley Spirit**, naturally **embryonic breathing**.
Using it brings no toil—
This is the **outer furnace’s** natural correspondence,
The **symbolic fire** without effort.
**Not toil** means **not to labor**.

**Chapter Eight**
(*Heaven is long, Earth is durable.
Why can Heaven and Earth endure so long?
Because they do not seek to live for themselves,
Thus they attain eternal life.
Therefore the Sage puts his body last,
Yet his body is first;
Sets his body outside,
Yet his body is preserved.
Is this not because he has no selfishness?
Thus he fulfills his selfishness.*)

---
*(Note: The final chapter’s original text was incomplete in the provided excerpt. The translation ends where the text concludes.)*

「The **Dao/Way** of eternal life is that Heaven is long and Earth is durable.
Yet the reason Heaven and Earth can endure so long is that they remain in stillness and focus while moving and opening, in contraction and expansion, giving birth to all things broadly and widely, nurturing without selfishness, and thus attain this eternal life.
If Heaven and Earth were to selfishly possess their own **virtue/power**, then the fate of all things would be obstructed, and Heaven and Earth would harm their own harmony.
If the nature of things were not upright, Heaven and Earth would destroy them.
The injury and ruin of all things are the injury and ruin of Heaven and Earth.
Only by not selfishly possessing their own **virtue/power** and instead using it for all beings’ lives,
do all beings’ ceaseless generation become the eternal life of Heaven and Earth—
thus they attain eternal life.
The Sage follows the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth.
Therefore, the Sage nurtures his body with gentleness and frailty,
appearing to put his body last to seek life.
Yet gradually filling and satisfying,
he truly preserves his body first to attain life.
Guarding the center and controlling the outer,
he seems to set his life outside, as if without life.
Yet by first forgetting and then remembering,
he preserves his body to have life.
But all these are ways of not selfishly possessing his **Dao/Way**,
for the Sage is serene and tranquil,
and the people’s nature is also pure and virtuous.
The Sage reaches his natural lifespan,
and the people’s lives are also long and venerable.
The **Great Dao/Way** is without selfishness,
yet to this extent, the Sage also appears to selfishly possess his own life.
Without selfishness, yet fulfilling it—
this is the utmost.

**Chapter Eight**
(*River Master’s commentary titles this the "Chapter of Concealing Light," Peng’s version the "Chapter of Selflessness.")

**The highest virtue is like water.**
Water is good at benefiting all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where all people despise,
and thus it approaches the **Dao/Way** most closely.
Its dwelling is in the good land,
its heart is deep like a pool,
its giving is kind,
its words are trustworthy,
its governance is effective,
its deeds are accomplished,
its actions are timely.
Only because it does not contend,
therefore it has no blame.

The **Dao/Way** values humility and lowliness,
yet can rise above—
thus it is called the **highest virtue**.
In its highest virtue, it is likened to water.
Water’s goodness lies in its ability to benefit all beings’ lives,
and to ensure all things have enough,
without contention.
Yet water’s nature flows downward,
often residing where all people despise.
Though people may despise it,
water itself suffers no harm.
It benefits others without claiming credit,
taking weakness as its aspiration—
water truly approaches the **Dao/Way** most closely.
**Chapter Eight**
(*River Master’s commentary titles this the "Chapter of Changing Nature," Peng’s version the "Chapter of Supreme Goodness.")

**The highest virtue is like water.**
Water is good at benefiting all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where all people despise,
and thus it approaches the **Dao/Way** most closely.
Its dwelling is in the good land,
its heart is deep like a pool,
its giving is kind,
its words are trustworthy,
its governance is effective,
its deeds are accomplished,
its actions are timely.
Only because it does not contend,
therefore it has no blame.

The virtue of humanity should be like water’s virtue.
If one holds to humility and lowliness,
then all actions will be good.
Without a contentious heart,
choosing to dwell in good land,
hiding the heart in deep waters,
sharing with kindness,
trusting with sincerity,
governing with effectiveness,
acting with capability,
moving in accord with the times—
everywhere and always,
softness and goodness without contention.
Only because it does not contend,
therefore no resentment or blame is directed toward it.
In comparison, water flows downward yet people still have high and low,
so it is even more divine in the **Dao/Way** and refined beyond water.

**Chapter Nine**
(*River Master’s commentary titles this the "Chapter of Leveling the Uneven," Peng’s version the "Chapter of Holding Fullness.")

**Holding and filling to excess, unaware of its fullness;
Grasping and sharpening to extremity, cannot be long preserved.**
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them;
Wealth and honor with arrogance, only bring self-inflicted ruin.

**Holding:** obtaining also.」

「**Grasping:** probing also.

Once a person has obtained its **qi**, yet still harbors the thought of further excess,
this marks the beginning of inviting deficiency—
thus, it is better to stop at its fullness.

When a person is probed for its treasures,
and suddenly feels the urge for sharpness and brilliance,
this is surely a sign of inevitable decline—
thus, it cannot be long preserved.

If one does not stop when it is best to stop,
it will be like gold and jade filling the hall,
yet none can guard them.

If one does not preserve when it should be preserved,
it will be like wealth and honor with arrogance,
self-inflicting ruin.

Such is the **Dao/Way** of humanity.

**When achievements are complete, name is fulfilled, and one withdraws—
this is the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.**

Moreover, let us speak of the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.
Heaven does not speak of achievements and name,
but takes nurturing and flourishing, growth and fulfillment,
as its achievements and name.

When things are fully grown and their function complete,
the seasons bring their renown—
Heaven and Earth thus withdraw and shift.

It hides itself in winter’s order,
to nurture the **yang** and the living.

How then might one observe the **Dao/Way** of Heaven?

**Chapter Ten**
(*He’s version titled "Chapter of Capability," Peng’s version "Chapter of Mysterious Virtue/Power.")

**To bear the vital essence and embrace unity,
can one truly remain unseparated?**

**To focus the **qi** and attain softness,
can one be like an infant?**

**To purify and remove the profound and subtle,
can one truly remain without blemish?**

**To love the people and govern the realm,
can one truly act without doing?**

**Heaven’s gate opens and closes,
can one truly remain without feminine or masculine?**

**Bright and clear in all directions,
can one truly remain without knowing?**

**To give birth and rear,
to give birth yet not possess,
to act yet not rely upon it,
to grow yet not slaughter—
this is called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.**

**Bear:** as in the chariot’s bearing.」

**Chapter Eleven**
(*He’s version titled "Chapter of Use," Peng’s version "Chapter of Beneficial Use.")

**Camp:** as in *camp* and *wei* (defensive and circulatory) of *camp-wei*.
*Wei* belongs to yang, while *camp* belongs to yin.
**Camp-po:** that is, the yin soul.
Some say: *Camp* is *po*.
To take *camp* as *po* is a misinterpretation.
One must know that when speaking of the yin *po*, the yang soul is contained within it.
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, the soul fully enters the lunar *po*, and the moon becomes full, attaining pure *Gàn* (metallic yang).
The Sage, at this time, governs the *Héché* (river vehicle) to bear it,
and thus *Gàn*’s gold is secured—
as the Classic says: *"Obtain the One, and all things are complete."*
Having obtained the One,
one must not lose the One.
The Sage bears the *po* and returns,
embraces the One and dwells within,
and thus the earthly *po* seizes *Zhūyōng* (cinnabar).
Hence, can one truly remain unseparated?

In the tenth month, warmth nurtures internally—
the inner fire is naturally kindled.
Warmth *qi* abides constantly,
and the fetus grows like an infant.
The Sage focuses *qi* to attain softness—
this is the inner fire.
Hence, can one be like nurturing an infant?

**Xuan-lan:** inner observation.
To purify and remove **Xuan-lan** is to be serene and observe inwardly.
Serene and inward observation—
the heart bears no blemish or burden,
as in:
*"To observe emptiness is emptiness,
emptiness has nothing to empty.
What is emptied has nothing,
and nothingness is without nothing.
Without nothingness, it is tranquil and ever still."*

To love the people is to settle them,
to govern the realm is to enrich it.
When the people are settled and the realm is rich,
one may then practice the politics of *wuwei* (non-action).
To govern the body, *jing* (essence) and *dìng* (stability) bring peace to the people,
*qiān* (lead) sufficiency brings wealth to the realm.
Refining oneself achieves *jing* and *dìng*,
returning the elixir achieves *qiān* sufficiency.
Refinement and elixir—
only then can one practice the Dao of embracing the One and *wuwei*.

To govern the body, guarding *cí* (feminine) is the practice,
nourishing the spirit and fetus cannot but guard *cí*.
When the Heavenly Gate bursts open,
the yang spirit enters and exits freely,
opening and closing as it will—
can one then be free from the toil of guarding *cí*?

To govern the body, knowledge is a disturbance.
When the Sage’s body is perfected,
the spirit of knowledge is transformed—
equally enlightened, equally awakened.
Bright and clear in all directions,
unobstructed—
can one then be without knowledge?

Moreover, there is the merit of bearing sons and grandsons,
exchanging cauldrons and dividing the fetus.
With the capacity to accumulate virtue and blessings,
one establishes merit to benefit the world.
Yet though one gives birth and does not possess the birth,
it is like powdered void.
Though one acts and does not rely upon it,
it is boundless compassion.
The heart of protecting the realm and aiding the people
endures for countless eons,
yet without boasting as the sovereign of heaven.
This is truly called **Mysterious Virtue/Power**.

**Chapter Twelve**
(*He’s version titled "Chapter of No-Use," Peng’s version "Chapter of Beneficial Use.")

**Thirty spokes converge at one hub;
it is their emptiness that gives the chariot its use.
Clay is shaped into vessels;
it is their emptiness that gives the vessel its use.
Doors and windows are carved for a room;
it is their emptiness that gives the room its use.
Thus, what exists is for utility,
but what is empty is for use.**

**Chapter Twelve**
(*He’s version titled "Chapter of Restraint of Desires," Peng’s version "Chapter of the Abdomen.")

Thirty-six spokes, modeling the revolutions of sun and moon,
Yet the hub stands at the chariot’s center, where all axles pass.
Empty within, converging without—
Though the hub itself is void, it is the chariot’s true function.

*Cao* is the blending of water and earth;
*Zhi* is the clay, the artisan’s work—brick and tile.
Before shaping, there is no vessel;
Yet once molded and fired, its use is complete.

Doors and windows bring light to the hall—
Before their carving, the hall seems nonexistent.
Once adorned, its purpose is fulfilled.

Thus, what is *has* is for advantage,
But what is *void* is for use.
All that exists arises from the void—
This is their general principle.

---

**Five colors** blind the eyes;
**Five tones** deafen the ears;
**Five flavors** dull the palate;
**Hunting and galloping** drive the mind to madness;
**Rare treasures** entangle the steps.

Therefore, the Sage values the **abdomen** over the eyes,
And discards the former to embrace the latter.

*Shuang*: loss.

The maddened: the unrestrained.

Rare treasures and delights—
All men covet them.
Thus, when treasures cling to one’s person,
They hinder movement as well.
The five—colors, sounds, flavors, hunts, and goods—
Harm men thus.
Therefore, the Sage holds them cheap,
Guarding inner wealth while scornful of externals,
Thus able to discard the former and embrace the latter.

**Chapter Thirteen**
*(River Upper Master’s annotation: "Chapter on Disdaining Shame"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Favor and Nobility")*

**Favor and shame, like sudden alarm;
Nobility and great calamity, like the body itself.**

If favor comes as alarm,
Then one must hide precious jade deep within.
If shame comes as alarm,
Then one must firmly establish roots.

This is the emblem of a hidden heart and resolute will.

If nobility is like the body,
Then one must rejoice in the Dao and rest in honor;
If calamity is like the body,
Then one must harmonize brilliance and spread slander.

This is the method of embracing the Primordial and preserving the True.

**What is meant by "favor and shame, like sudden alarm"?**
*(Wang Bi and other versions read: "Favor is low")*
To gain it as alarm,
To lose it as alarm—
This is called "favor and shame, like sudden alarm."

Favor as low—
Like saying: honor and favor are unstable,
Ever shifting downward,
Thus gains and losses cannot be relied upon.

To gain it as alarm,
To lose it as alarm—
Sometimes gaining, sometimes losing,
Ever vigilant and striving with the times—
This is what is meant by "favor and shame, like sudden alarm."

**What is meant by "nobility and great calamity, like the body itself"?**
The reason I have great calamity
Is that I have this body.

「When I have no body,
What calamity shall I have?

Thus, he who values his body as the foundation for the world
Can entrust himself to the world;
He who cherishes his body as the world’s reliance
Can commit himself to the world’s service.

This passage elucidates the **nobility of calamity**—
Yet it first clarifies that calamity exists
Because one must return to the absence of calamity.

But the cause of great calamity
Lies in the present form of the fleshly body,
So calamity can be imposed upon it.

Once the shell is shed and the **True Qi** preserved,
Calamity cannot be imposed upon it.

Or, if one retains his form and dwells in the world,
His **True Qi** contained within,
Concealing his brilliance and obscuring his traces—
What calamity could then bend him?

Thus, when one holds his body in esteem,
Treating it as the world’s vessel of life,
Yet does not dare to slight his precious form—
Then he can entrust his body to the world.
This is how the **Yellow Stone Master** instructed **Zifang**.

When one safeguards his body,
Treating it as the world’s support and trust,
Yet does not dare to reveal his matchless talents—
Then he can commit his body to the world’s service.
This is how **Zhang Jiuling** admonished **Yehou**.

He who well preserves his body
Is one who well governs his own life.
He who well governs his own life
Is one who well governs the world.

Confucius said:
*The dragon and serpent’s dormancy*
Is to preserve their bodies.
*To utilize and secure one’s dwelling*
Is to exalt **Virtue/Power**.
The **noble man** keeps his **treasures** within his body,
Waiting for the time to act—
What then is there that cannot be utilized?

**Chapter Fourteen** (The **Huangshang Gong** version titles this *"Praise of the Mysterious Dao"*）」

---

**Chapter Fifteen** (The *Huangshang Gong* version titles this *"Praise of the Mysterious Dao"*, while Peng’s version calls it *"Preserve Abundance"*)

**The Dao/Way that cannot be seen is called "Yi" (平易/Simplicity);**
**That which cannot be heard is called "Xi" (希微/Subtlety).**
**To grasp it is impossible—it is called "Wei" (微妙/Mystery).**
These three cannot be forced or examined,
Thus they merge as one.
Its upper reaches are not bright,
Its lower depths are not dark.
**Faint and indistinct, it cannot be named—**
Returning to nothingness,
It is called the **Formless Form**,
The **Symbol without Symbol**,
This is called **Huanghuo** (恍惚/Vague and Indistinct).
**Approach it and you cannot see its head—**
**Follow it and you cannot see its tail.**
**Holding to the ancient Dao/Way,**
To govern the **possessions** of the present—
He who knows the ancient beginning
Is called one of **Dao/Way’s Records**.

---

In the realm where **nothing is seen or heard**,
This is the **Xi Yi Gate** (希夷门).
The **Xi Yi Gate** is where **nature and sentiment** reside.
**Yi** conceals **nature**,
**Xi** conceals **sentiment**,
Thus it is unseen when viewed,
Unheard when listened to.
Yet within it flows **true intention** (真意),
Seeking it in vain—
Hence, it is further named **"Wei"** (微).
These three cannot be partitioned or exhaustively examined,
Thus they must be merged as one,
So that the three families may meet.
Its **upper** and **lower** realms—
**Ping** (契) explains: *"Upper Closure, Lower Closure"* (上闭下闭).
Neither bright nor dark,
This is the **as if present, as if absent** (若有若无).
**Faint and indistinct** (绳绳):
A warning of reverence, like *"Upper Closure, Lower Closure"* (上闭下闭),
**As if present, as if absent** (若有若无).
**Reverent of what cannot be seen,**
Yet unable to name its **boundaries** (端倪).
**Vague and indistinct** (恍惚),
Within it there is substance—
Yet it returns to **nothingness**.
This is the **Formless Form**,
The **Symbol without Symbol**.
**Formless and symbol-less,**
This is the **vague and indistinct** moment.
The **truth of vague and indistinct**—
Neither head nor tail can be seen,
Is it the **original qi** of **Yuan Shi** (元始)?
**The ancient Dao/Way** is the **essence** of **Yuan Shi** (元始之体).
**The present possessions** are the **manifestations** of the present (现前之用).
Though ancient and present differ,
One must **hold to the ancient** to govern the present—
**No creation, no possession**.
He who knows **Yuan Shi** before and after,
Extending to **Yuan Shi**’s future—
This is **Dao/Way’s Record and History** (道之纪历).
**Recording years, months, days, and times,**
All by one **mark** (符) and **moment** (刻),
Are all **Dao/Way’s Records**.

---

**Ancient masters skilled in cultivation** (善为士者)
Were subtle, mysterious, and profound,
Deep beyond recognition.
Because they could not be recognized,
They **artificially shaped their appearance**:
**Yù** (豫) like winter crossing a river,
**Yōu** (犹) like fear of the four neighbors,
**Yǎn** (俨) like **proper bearing** (容),
**Huàn** (涣) like ice about to thaw,
**Dūn** (敦) like **unadorned simplicity** (朴),
**Kuàng** (旷) like an empty valley,
**Hún** (浑) like muddy water.

Who can **clarify** the murky with **gradual stillness** (澄静之徐清)?
Who can **stir** the settled with **prolonged motion** (久动之徐生)?
**Preservers of this Dao/Way** do not desire **abundance**.
Because they do not desire **abundance**,
They **wear out without renewal** (敝不新成).

---

**Ancient cultivators**, knowing this **method of self-preservation** (治身之道)
To be subtle, mysterious, and profound,
Reaching depths beyond measure,
Dared not **recklessly probe or recognize** it.
Thus their **artificial descriptions**—
The seven *"as if"* (若) phrases in this chapter
Are all **descriptive terms**.
What they describe are **scenes** and **symbols** of things.
Who can, within **dense and turbid** (重浊),
**Wait in stillness** for its **light and clear** (轻清)?
Who can, with **settled sincerity** (安敦之神),
**Endure long** for its **gradual emergence** (徐生)?
**Waiting** and **enduring**—
They dare not **seek excess**.
**Preservers of this Dao/Way** do not desire **abundance**,
Meaning they do not **seek excess**.
Because they do not **seek excess**,
They can **guard the ancient norm** (故常).
Not **forcing new creation**,
They do not **contradict the true Dao/Way**.

**Wei Boyang** said:
*"Standing by the furnace, weighing the slightest grain,*
**Five parts of water have excess.**
*These two are taken as true—*
**Gold weighs more than its original.**
*The third is discarded,*
**Fire’s two parts join it together.**"
This is the **method of not seeking excess**,
Of **guarding the ancient norm**.

Is **Cloudtooth’s** *Shen Tong Qi* (参同契)
Also **embodying the* Tao Te Ching *of the Supreme One** (太上之《道德经》)
Yet **not forcing new creation**?

---

**Chapter Sixteen** (The *Huangshang Gong* version titles this *"Return to the Root"*, while Peng’s version calls it *"Empty Stillness"*)

**To attain utmost emptiness** (致虚极),
**And steadfastly guard stillness** (守静笃).
When all things **simultaneously arise** (并作),
I watch as they **return to their source** (复).
**Things are myriad** (物芸芸),
Each **returns to its root**.
Returning to the root is **stillness** (静),
**Stillness** is **restoration to the original command** (复命).
**Restoration to the original command** is **constancy** (常),
Knowing **constancy** is **clarity** (明).
**Ignorance of constancy** leads to **reckless action** (妄作凶).
**Knowing constancy** is **tolerance** (容),
**Tolerance** becomes **universal** (公),
**Universal** becomes **sovereign** (王),
**Sovereign** becomes **heaven** (天),
**Heaven** becomes **Dao/Way** (道),
**Dao/Way** endures **long** (久),
**No harm until death** (没身不殆).

**Attain** (致): **To place and abandon** (委置).
**Empty** (虚): **The vessel of nothingness** (空器).
**Extreme** (极): **To complete its method** (毕其道).
**Guard** (守): **To dwell** (居).
**Stillness** (静): **Non-action** (无为).
**Steadfast** (笃): **Diligence without loss** (谨慎不失).
**All things arising simultaneously** (并作),
All things have their **beginning and birth** (始生).
**I** (吾): **The master of the seed** (种物之主人).
**Watch** (观): **To await** (待).
**Return** (复): **To revert** (返).
**Cultivators of the body** place and abandon **original spirit** (元神)
Within the **empty vessel** (空器),
Then **obtain its Dao/Way** (得其道).
Having **obtained its Dao/Way**,
They must **dwell in leisurely stillness** (居闲静无事之所),
**Diligently guarding without loss** (谨慎不失).
**Awaiting** the **empty vessel’s creation** (生物),
**I** again **wait for its return to origin** (返本).
Thus **one departure and one return**,
And **life’s transformations manifest** (变化神明).
Knowing this,
The **seven returns’ method** (七返之道) is complete.

That **myriad things arise and flourish together** (芸芸而并盛),
From **non-action to action** (无作而有作),
From **action to returning to non-action** (有作而复还无作),
Still **adapt to the changes** (化机) to **enter and exit**.
Thus **spring generates, summer thrives,**
**autumn collects, winter stores,**
**Then withering returns to its root.**
**Things return to their root**,
**Motion then becomes stillness** (动而复静),
Hence it is called **stillness**.
**Stillness** then **returns to non-thingness** (无物) and **re-creates** (造化),
Hence it is called **restoration to the original command**.
**Restoration to the original command**,
Then one knows the **true constancy’s Dao/Way** (真常之道).
**Constancy in stillness** (常静),
Can **constantly respond** (能常应).
**The tranquil** (寂然),
Further **becomes profound** (湛然).
Thus **knowing constancy** is **clarity** (明).

**Common folk**, unaware of the **true constancy’s Dao/Way** (真常之道)
Lies in **returning to the root** (归根) and **restoration to the original command** (复命),
**Generally scheming and creating** (经营造作),
**Immersed in the names and forms of action** (有为名象),
**Draining their spirit** (耗损精神),
Thus **reckless action brings disaster** (妄作招凶).

If such is the case, then how can one not know **Constancy**?

Knowing **Constancy** is then **capacity** (容).
**Capacity** (容): to **embrace the public** (涵公).
**Public** (公): the **great** (大).
**King** (王): the **noble** (贵).
**Heaven** (天): the **exalted** (尊).
**Dao/Way** (道): the **ultimate of emptiness and nothingness** (虚无之极).

It is as if **embracing the origin** (元) within **stillness** (静态),
Thus **enlarging creation** (大其造化),
And entering the **domain of the most sagely spirit** (至圣神之域),
To return to the **true of ultimate emptiness and nothingness** (至虚至无之真).

**Uniting with emptiness and nothingness** (体合虚无),
Enduring forever without decay (长久不坏).

**Extinction of the body** (没身): **nothingness** (无),
Having **spirit without body** (有神无身),
Then **water and fire cannot harm**,
**Metals and stones cannot injure**,
**Tigers and rhinoceroses cannot bite**,
**Blades and weapons cannot cut**—
What danger or peril could there be?

---
**Chapter Seventeen** (*River Master’s version: "Chapter of Pure Wind," Peng’s version: "Chapter of the Most High*)

**The Most High** (太上), **the lower know of its existence** (下知有之);
**The Most High** (太上): the **Sage** (圣人).
The Sage **dwells above the common folk** (居众人之上), hence called **Most High** (太上).
Or, **Most High** (太上) may also mean **the highest principle** (上理).

The Sage **conducts affairs without action** (处无为之事);
**Teaches without words** (行不言之教);
**Does not flaunt virtue** (不矜能), so the common folk **do not contend** (使下民不争);
**Does not covet gain** (不好利), so the common folk **do not grow greedy** (使下民不贪);
**Does not indulge desire** (不爱欲), so the common folk **do not grow disorderly** (使下民不乱);
**Not contending, not greedy, not disorderly**—
The **Most High** possesses this, and the common folk also possess it.

**The lower know** (下知): the common folk (下民).

---
**Next**, they **revere and praise** (亲而誉之);
**Next**, they **fear** (畏之);
**Next**, they **despise** (侮之);
**Trust is insufficient** (信不足焉), **there is distrust** (有不信焉).
**How precious are words!** (犹兮其贵言).
When **achievement is complete and affairs accomplished** (功成事遂),
The common folk all say, *"It was as if by nature."* (百姓皆谓我自然).

---
**Next** is the **second level of the Dao** (其次者，道之次也).
The **Most High Dao** achieves without action, governs without words.
The **second level** cannot achieve without action, cannot govern without words,
So they **revere and praise with affection** (亲爱而奖誉之), to **promote transformation** (以兴化焉).
**Again next**, unable to promote transformation through affectionate praise,
They must **enforce with laws and commands, making them fear and submit** (则必以法令畏之而服之焉).
**Again next**, unable to make them submit through fear of laws,
They must **use cleverness to dominate and subdue** (则必以智巧侮之而驭之焉).
When **Dao** descends to **cleverness**, the **wind grows low** (风斯下矣),
And the rest is unworthy of observation (其余不足观也已).

Thus, **trust is again spoken of at the root** (故复言根心之信).
If the **ruler values trust**, then the people **dare not speak falsely** (民莫敢不用情).
If the **ruler’s trust is sufficient**, the people **speak truly** (下即以真情言之).
If **trust is insufficient**, the people **will have distrust** (下即有不信者焉).
And the Sage **must rely on trust for governance** (而圣人必以信为治理也).

**Precious words** (贵言): **speak with caution** (慎言).
When the ruler **personally practices genuine governance** (躬行实政),
**Leisurely and inspiring trust** (优游感孚),
Without issuing commands, the people **submit willingly** (不诰令而民情服),
Thus **their words must be spoken with utmost care** (故必谨慎其令言).
When **achievement is complete and affairs accomplished** (功成事遂),
The common folk **neither recognize nor know** (皆不识不知),
Following the **Heavenly pattern** (顺帝之则),
All say, *"It was as if by nature."* (咸谓我之自然也).

---
**My humble reflection**: This chapter’s teachings
Can be **discussed for governing the world** (论治世),
And can also be **applied to self-cultivation** (证治身).

The **highest virtue** refines through purity and stillness,
where the six senses are settled—
acting without action,
yet nothing is left undone.

The next level refines through love and reverence,
where response flows naturally—
acting without action,
yet something is accomplished.

Again, the next level governs through laws and merit.
Then, through wisdom and cunning—
the **arts of strategy**—
where action brings results.

But the most profound truth is **trust**,
for **trust belongs to the earth**,
and the **elixir’s essence**, from beginning to end,
finds its marvel in the **spontaneous earthly qi**—
all unfolding naturally, as it must.

How rich these words are—
fit for governing the world,
fit for cultivating the self.

**Chapter Eighteen** *(River Master’s version: "Chapter on the Coarsening of Virtue"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on the Great Dao")*
*"When the Great Dao decays, there arises benevolence and righteousness.
When wisdom emerges, great deceit follows.
When the six kinsmen are divided, filial piety and affection arise.
When the state is in chaos, loyal ministers appear."*

This chapter speaks of the **eclipse of virtue in governance**,
yet it also reveals the **principles of self-cultivation**.
Here, two examples are given:
First, abandoning **non-action** leads to benevolent governance,
just as losing the **primordial unity** of the body
leads to the **restorative work** of recovery.

Using **clarity and strategy** to probe deeper
only makes the people’s true feelings more concealed—
just as relying on **cleverness and contrivance** to extract
makes medicinal properties more hidden.

Filial piety and affection in the home
restore the discord among the six kinsmen,
just as entering the chamber to cultivate **Great Stillness**
settles the unrest of the six senses.

Loyal ministers in the state
rescue its chaos,
just as **true gold in the Mysterious Gate**
revives what has weakened.

Then, sighing for the ancient, unadorned governance
and the **highest virtue’s non-action**—
how distant their winds have faded,
for so long.

**Chapter Nineteen** *(River Master’s version: "Chapter on Returning to Simplicity"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on the Three Abandonments")*
*"Abandon the Sage, discard wisdom—
the people’s gain is a hundredfold.
Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness—
the people return to filial piety and affection.
Abandon cleverness, discard profit—
thieves and robbers vanish.
These three are insufficient for culture,
so they must be guided by proper order.
Embrace simplicity, hold fast to purity—
few desires, little self-interest."*

**Chapter Twenty**
*"Absolute" means both "great" and "uttermost."
The **uttermost Sage** does not rely on wisdom—
the winds of sincerity and simplicity prevail,
and the people reap a hundredfold benefit.
The **uttermost Benevolent** does not cling to righteousness—
customs flourish in kinship and harmony,
and the people return to filial piety and affection.
The **uttermost Skillful** do not scheme for profit—
those who scheme for profit are but cunning artisans.
When the **Way** above lacks cunning,
thieves and robbers vanish below.
Sageliness is not complete without wisdom,
benevolence without righteousness,
skill without profit.
Sageliness, benevolence, and skill—
these three are like substance without adornment.
Muddled and indistinct,
they share a single **Dao** and wind,
so the people are guided to their proper place—
and this is all that is required.
To see the unadorned and embrace the pure,
to have few desires and little self-interest—
though the people’s adornments are insufficient,
they are still beautiful.

---

**Chapter Twenty-One**
*"Abandon Learning, and there will be no worries.
How far apart are ‘yes’ and ‘nodding’?
How different are ‘good’ and ‘evil’?
What people fear—
do not fear what they fear."*

Those who abandon learning
possess the **Dao** in fullness and virtue complete.
When virtue and the **Dao** are complete,
what is there to worry about?
To the Sage, the masses are like those who speak only in straight affirmation
while others flatter with excessive agreement.
Good is lovable, evil is hateful—
yet one does not know how far apart they truly lie.
The Sage has no worries,
and thus no fears.
What people fear is the difficulty of abandoning learning.
How can one fear what others fear
without striving to abandon learning?
Thus it is said:
*"Do not fear what they fear."*

---
**Ah, vast and boundless!**
The masses rejoice, rejoicing,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice,
as if ascending the Spring Platform.
I alone am tranquil, with no trace yet shown—
like an infant before it learns to speak.
*Buying, buying*—
as if drifting without destination.
The masses all have abundance,
while I alone seem forsaken.
Ah, my heart is that of a simpleton!
*Dull, dull*—
while the vulgar are bright and clear,
I alone am dim and murky.
*Dull, dull*—
like the obscurity of night,
silent, as if without end.
The masses all have purpose,
while I alone am stubborn and crude.
I alone differ from others,
yet I alone cherish the **Mother** of the **Dao**.

The **Dao** before Heaven unfolds,
like the pristine chaos before creation—
effortless yet complete,
silent yet governing.
Thus the masses attain the pure transformation,
rejoicing and content in harmony.
They share its virtue,
as if feasting on the grandest sacrifice.
They dwell together in its realm,
as if ascending the Spring Platform.
Though this may be the custom of Hua Xu,
nothing surpasses it.

The Sage says:
I alone am serene and still,
remote and unmarked,
like an infant before it learns to speak.
*Buying, buying*—
to ride along with the **Dao**,
thus it is called *buying, buying*.
Ascending and descending, moving within—
endless, as if without support.
Thus the masses all have excess to seek,
while I alone stand apart,
as if abandoned by the world.
Then the masses are all wise,
while I alone seem foolish—
for great skill appears as clumsiness.

*Dull, dull*—
like the darkness of Heaven and Earth,
*flitting*—
as if the comings and goings have no fixed path.
From this, it is seen:
the masses all have purpose,
while I alone am confused and dim,
floating like a fool, crude and unadorned.
People do not follow me,
and I do not follow them.
One grain of **yang dan**,
called the **Mother Qi**—
I alone seek and consume it
to attain longevity.
Thus, the masses do not equal the Sage,
just as ‘yes’ and ‘nodding’ differ,
or good and evil.
Is this not why the Sage alone proclaims the **Abandonment of Learning**?

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
*"The vastness of virtue’s container
follows only the **Dao**.
The **Dao** as a thing—
only vague, only hazy.
Hazy and vague—
yet within it, there are forms.
Vague and hazy—
yet within it, there is substance.
Deep and dark—
yet within it, there is essence.
Its essence is most true—
within it, there is veracity.
From ancient times to now,
its name does not fade,
to observe the myriad things.
How do I know the myriad things are thus?
Because of this."*

---

**Chapter Twenty-Two (On Virtue’s Container)**

**孔 (Kǒng):** *emptiness, vastness.*
The utmost emptiness, the utmost vastness—
its virtue and vessel can contain wondrous things,
thus the **Dao** enters through this.

The **Dao** as a thing—
hazy and vague, without fixed form.
In terms of *separating essence*, it originally has no image.
Now vague, now hazy—
what has no form seems to have form.
Now hazy, now vague—
what has no substance already has substance.

Some say *"hazy and vague"* rhymes with *image*,
*"vague and hazy"* rhymes with *substance*.
Yet they do not know the Sage’s words invert letters,
hiding within them the inversion of the **Dao**’s law.

*"Hazy and vague"*—this is the original image of essence.
*"Vague and hazy"*—this is the substance nurtured by essence,
as male beneath female, their union forming *jing*—
one thing, yet truly two.

Thus, there is form in the first phrase,
substance in the second,
and *jing* in the third.
The sentence structure itself embodies the **Dao**’s inversion.

For *jing* is the fire of essence descending,
illuminating and responding to form—
only then does it reveal the *Kàn* (abyss) emotions,
yet it remains subtly profound, beyond measure—
hence *"deep and dark."*

The *jing* of depth and darkness—
this is the true *jing*.
To obtain true *jing*,
one must know true *xin* (faith).
Thus, within it lies faith—
vast as tides rising,
melted as ice thawing.

The cultivator, at this moment,
waits for faith’s first arrival—
when it is clearly *jing*, then seize it, suppress it.
Timing must be precise—
then the *Jīnxiān* (Golden Immortal) fate is yours.

It is called *true gold*,
*Chǒujīng* (First Scripture),
*true water*,
*shénshuǐ* (Divine Water),
*true lead*,
*qiānqì* (Lead Qi),
*Báihǔ* (White Tiger),
*hǔqì* (Tiger Qi)—
yet all refer to true *jing*.

Thus, from ancient times to now,
this true *jing*’s name remains in all scriptures.
By observing one true thing,
one perceives the principle of all things—
none escape this original *qi*.

*"To observe the myriad things"*—
this is to examine their beginnings.
Hence it is said:
*"How do I know the myriad things are thus?
Because of this."*

**Supplementary Note:**
Within this chapter, four references to *"among"* (*kǒng*) reveal
the One Pass of Mysterious Darkness,
the gate of the Great **Dao**.
Refining lead to elixir—
none exceed this.

**Chapter Twenty-Two (On Embracing Wholeness)**
*"What is bent becomes whole.
What is crooked becomes straight.
What is hollow becomes full.
What is worn becomes renewed.
What is little becomes gained.
What is much becomes confused.
Thus, the Sage holds *oneness* as the model for all under heaven.

Not self-illuminating, hence bright.
Not self-righteous, hence manifest.
Not self-praising, hence meritorious.
Not self-glorifying, hence enduring.

Only by not contending
does one under heaven find none who can contend with them.
Was not the ancient saying *"what is bent becomes whole"*
a mere empty phrase?
Truly, it is to embrace wholeness and return to it."*

*"What is bent becomes whole"*—
increase comes through subtraction.
*"What is crooked becomes straight"*—
softness governs hardness.
*"What is hollow becomes full"*—
humility brings benefit.
*"What is worn becomes renewed"*—
decay leads to rebirth.
*"What is little becomes gained"*—
contentment brings no shame.
*"What is much becomes confused"*—
greed blinds the mind.

These are the ancient words of the *Tàishàng* (Supreme One) before,
teaching the essential **Dao** of self-cultivation.
Thus, the Sage governs the world
by embracing *oneness* as the model for all under heaven.

To embrace *oneness* is:
not self-illuminating,
not self-righteous,
not self-praising,
not self-glorifying.

*(Wang’s annotation: These four lines correspond to "what is bent becomes whole,"*
*yet this interpretation is mistaken—*
*for "hence bright," "hence manifest," "hence enduring," "hence meritorious"*
*each clarify their respective lines above.)*

Someone asks:
*"Why does the ancient text repeat ‘what is bent becomes whole’?"*
I say:
This is the *Tàishàng* quoting ancient words of self-cultivation
to introduce the principle of all under heaven.
Thus it says: *"Was not this a mere empty phrase?"*
If one reverently guards this sincerity,
then all under heaven will surely return to this model.

**Chapter Twenty-Three (On Effortless Nature)**
*"Few words—nature unfolds.
Thus, gusts do not last the morning,
downpours do not last the day.
Who does this?
The heavens and earth.
Even the heavens and earth cannot endure—
how much less can mortals?

Thus, those who follow the **Dao**:
those aligned with the **Dao** are one with the **Dao**,
those aligned with virtue are one with virtue,
those aligned with loss are one with loss.

Those one with the **Dao**, the **Dao** delights in them.
Those one with virtue, virtue delights in them.
Those one with loss, loss delights in them.

Faith is insufficient—
then there is no faith."*

**Chapter Twenty-Four (On Humility and Modesty)**

*"Few words: no sound, no action.
Those who enter the **Dao** take as their principle *wuwei* and effortless nature.
*Wuwei* brings tranquility and ease,
effortless nature brings steady progress.
Otherwise, like gusts that do not last the morning,
or downpours that do not last the day—
though even the heavens and earth produce them,
they too cannot endure long.
How much less so for mortals?

Thus, all who follow the **Dao**’s path—
cultivating virtue and walking the **Dao**—
must do so naturally,
only then can they be one with virtue and the **Dao**.

Loss is also *wuwei*.
To act without *wuwei* is to invite the very matters of loss.
The **Dao**, virtue, and loss all delight in this natural, effortless state.
If faith and practice are insufficient,
then there must be those who fail to embrace this natural effortlessness before them.

---

*Dwelling on one’s own merit* does not stand firm,
*boasting of one’s own virtue* does not prevail.
Those who see only themselves remain unclear,
those who insist on their own rightness do not shine,
those who praise themselves achieve no merit,
those who vaunt themselves do not endure.

In the **Dao**, it is said:
‘Excessive intake and superfluous actions.’
Some may loathe this,
so those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there.

---
*Dwelling on one’s own merit* (*qí*): to gaze upward, to aspire."*

---

**Chapter 24**
*"Boasting of one’s own virtue* (*kuà*): to hasten, to rush forward."
To **aspire** (*qí*) is to lift one’s head upward, unable to stand long.
To **hasten** is to weary one’s feet, unable to walk far.
Those who see only themselves, insist on their own rightness,
praise themselves, or vaunt their own virtue—
all are those who fail to embrace this natural effortlessness,
and thus will never accomplish anything.

This is likened to the **Dao**:
‘Excessive intake and superfluous actions.’
Some may loathe this,
so those who follow the **Dao** do not dwell there.

---

**Chapter 25**
*"Boasting of one’s own virtue* (*kuà*): to hasten, to rush forward."

There is a **formless** and **mixed** entity (*hùnchéng*),
born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and vast (*jì xiāo liáo*),
it stands alone yet never alters,
circulates endlessly yet never falters,
and may be called the **Mother of all things**.

I do not know its name,
so I call it **"Dao"** (*dào*).
I force a name upon it and call it **"Great"** (*dà*).
Great is **passing** (*shì*),
passing is **distant** (*yuǎn*),
distant is **returning** (*fǎn*).
Thus the **Dao** is Great,
Heaven is Great,
Earth is Great,
and the Sovereign (*wáng*) is also Great.
Within the realm (*yù*), there are four Great Ones,
and the Sovereign occupies one of them.

Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the **Dao**,
and the **Dao** follows **Nature**.

The **Mother of all things** (*mǔqì*)
is the **original** and **formless** *qi* (*hóngméng shǐqì, hùnhùn wúmíng*).
The **formless** is that which was born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent (*jì*): clear (*qīng*).
Vast (*liáo*): empty (*xū*).
Standing alone in the realm of clarity and emptiness,
yet never changing its true and constant nature—
this is none other than the **formless** and **mixed**.

One entity flowing through all things,
completing them yet never failing—
this is what may be called the **Mother of all things**.

Since the beginning of the **Dao** (*dào zǔ*) and the opening of the cosmos,
the **Mother** *qi* has been known to exist before the **Hun** (*hùndùn*).
It gives birth to Heaven, Earth, humans, and all things,
nurturing them within its embrace.
When asked its name,
I did not know it,
so I first called it **"Dao"** (*dào*).
**Dao** is composed of the radicals *shǒu* (首) and *chū* (辶),
indicating that which moves before Heaven and Earth to give birth.
I then forced a name upon it and called it **"Great"** (*dà*).
**Great** is composed of the radicals *yī* (一) and *rén* (人),
indicating that which precedes all things and emerges first.
Thus, through all ages,
it is called the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*).

The **Great** is limitless in its power,
ruling above *Qián* (乾) and below *Kūn* (坤).
**Passing** (*shì*), it departs from you.
**Distant** (*yuǎn*), it reaches everywhere—
even to the North *Kǎn* (坎) and West *Duì* (兑).
This **Dao** is boundless,
and when it reaches its utmost, it returns.

It may emerge in *Zhèn* (震),
align in *Sūn* (巽),
manifest in *Lí* (离),
and complete in *Gèn* (艮).
Great indeed!
The **Dao**, Heaven, Earth, and the Sovereign
are the four Great Ones within the realm.

Without the **Dao**, one cannot know Heaven—
Heaven is Great.
Without Heaven, there is no covering of Earth—
Earth is Great.
Without Earth, there is no bearing of the Sovereign—
the Sovereign is also Great.
The Sovereign resides among them,
as the first among all people.
The Sovereign is the master of the people,
never leaving humanity.
Humans dwell upon Earth,
so they follow Earth.
Earth lies beneath Heaven,
so it follows Heaven.
Heaven is within the **Dao**,
so it follows the **Dao**.
The **Dao** is most wondrous in its **Natural** state,
so it follows **Nature**.

**Chapter 26**
Heavy (*zhòng*) is the **root of lightness** (*qīng*),
still (*jìng*) is the **master of agitation** (*zào*).
Thus the **virtuous** (*jūnzǐ*) walks through the day
without straying from the balance of **lightness** and **heaviness**.

Though surrounded by splendor and spectacle (*róngguān yànchǔ*),
they dwell in **transcendent** ease (*chāorán*).
How can the ruler of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhǔ*)
lighten themselves against the world (*shēn qīng tiānxià*)?
To **lighten** is to lose one’s ministers,
to **agitate** is to lose one’s **virtue**.

---

**Chapter 27**

Heaviness is water;
lightness is fire.
Water gives birth to fire within itself,
so heaviness is the **root of lightness**.

Stillness is **calm abiding** (*dìng*);
agitation is **wisdom** (*huì*).
Calm abiding gives rise to wisdom within itself,
so stillness is the **master of agitation**.

Observe the **virtuous** (*jūnzǐ*) whose talent and **virtue** are both profound:
they move through the day without straying from the balance of **lightness** and **heaviness**,
seeking to apply themselves with **lightness** and ease.
Though surrounded by splendor and spectacle (*róngguān yànchǔ*),
they dwell in **transcendent** ease (*chāorán*),
undisturbed by the bustle of the world.

Yet how can the sovereign of the **Red Palace** (*Zhàngōng zhǔ*),
one held in such esteem as the ruler of ten thousand chariots (*wànshèng zhǔ*),
suddenly abandon this principle and forget it?
They neither **uphold** heaviness to nurture lightness,
nor **preserve** stillness to govern agitation.

I fear that if they lean entirely toward **lightness**,
they will lose the **true water**—the genuine talent—
and fire will have no **root**.
Fire arises from water,
water serves as fire’s **minister** (*chén*),
hence it is called **minister**.

If they lean entirely toward **agitation**,
they will lose the **true stillness**—the genuine **calm abiding** (*dìng*)—
and wisdom will have no **master**.
Wisdom emerges from **calm abiding**,
stillness serves as wisdom’s **master** (*jūn*),
hence it is called **master**.

The **virtuous** act leaves no trace,
the **virtuous** word no flaw or censure,
the **virtuous** plan requires no calculations or schemes,
the **virtuous** closure needs no locks or keys yet cannot be opened,
the **virtuous** binding needs no cords or constraints yet cannot be undone.

Therefore, the Sage always **upholds** the **virtue** of saving others,
and thus never abandons anyone.
Always **upholds** the **virtue** of saving things,
and thus never abandons anything.
This is called **following the bright** (*xí míng*).

Hence, the **virtuous** person is the teacher of the **non-virtuous**,
while the **non-virtuous** person is the **resource** (*zī*) of the **virtuous**.
If one does not **honor** their teacher,
nor **cherish** their **resource**,
even if their wisdom is vast, they will be deeply **bewildered** (*dà mí*),
and this is called **the essence of subtlety** (*yào miào*).

The act that leaves no trace is the **natural** process of the **celestial chariot** (*hé chē*),
if it is forced, then one **conceives** and **manipulates** it.

The word that has no flaw is the **natural** **inheritance** (*zǔ shù*),
if it is forced, then one **contradicts** and **distorts** the **principles**.

The plan that requires no calculations is the **natural** **firing time** (*huǒ hòu*),
if calculations are used, then one becomes **stuck** in **divination lines** (*yáo zé*).

The closure that cannot be opened is the **natural** **inner prohibition** (*nèi jìn*),
if it can be opened, then one merely **shuts** the ears and eyes.

The binding that cannot be undone is the **natural** **congealing** (*níng jù*),
if it can be undone, then one **forcibly** **joins** it.

Therefore, the Sage **preserves** the **natural** **virtue** of the **true water**—the genuine talent—
and **establishes** both self and others,
so all may be **relied upon** (*chóng zhòng*).
He **perfects** both self and things,
so all may be **observed** (*guān*).

The one who **inherits enlightenment** does so by awakening those who are yet unaware—
the mind **transmits** and **alerts** to awakening.
This is called **inheriting enlightenment**.

Thus, the virtuous **realize** the **illuminated virtue** (*míngdé*),
and the unvirtuous, though drawn to it, also **realize** the **illuminated virtue**.
The unvirtuous do not **self-reflect**,
but the virtuous, seeing unvirtue, **can** **self-reflect**.
They **turn to teach** one another, **turn to aid** one another.
If they do not **aid** or **teach** one another,
what could be more **precious** or **lovable**?
Then one **fabricates cleverness**—
though wise, one is **greatly deluded**.

The **refinement of the self**’s **subtle essence** lies in nothing else.

---
**Chapter Twenty-Eighth** (*River Master’s version: "Return to Simplicity"; Peng’s version: "Constant Virtue"*)

*"Know its masculine, preserve its feminine—
this is the **creek** of the world.
As the **creek** of the world,
**constant virtue** does not depart,
and returns to the **infant**."*

This passage holds two meanings,
both of which those who cultivate the self must **know** and **uphold**.

**First:** *Masculine application, feminine transformation.*
*The Parametric Concordance* says:
*"The masculine yang spreads the dark transformation,
the feminine yin governs the yellow refinement."*
This is it.
**Knowing** this allows one to **apply** and **act**,
**preserving** this allows one to **transform** and **nurture**.
When masculine and feminine **interact harmoniously**,
the metal **conceals** within the water,
and the water **revolves**, giving birth to its metal.
When the metal *qi* is sufficient, the **tide arrives**—
its force is like the **creek’s flow**.
Flowing **backward**, ascending **against the current**,
this is the **creek** of the world’s **irrigation**.

Yet though it is the **creek** of irrigation,
when the **yang fire advances** and the **yin symbol** descends,
**constant virtue**—returning to root, fulfilling mandate—
cannot depart.
Thus it returns to the **earthen pot**,
to **nourish** the **fetal infant**.

**Second:** *Masculine retreat, feminine concealment.*
*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Within the masculine, the feminine conceives the sacred embryo."*
If we speak of **generative principle**,
when yin is extreme, yang is born—
this is the feminine **conceiving** the masculine.
If we speak of **nurturing things**,
when yang is extreme, yin is born—
this is the masculine **conceiving** the feminine.
The masculine **conceiving** the feminine—
having **retreated** the masculine to **refine** the elixir,
one must further **conceal** the feminine to **warm** the elixir.
Its force is like the **creek’s ravine**,
pouring downward from above,
falling into the **creek**—
thus the **Way of preserving** the feminine
is like the world’s **creeks and ravines**,
with **flow** and **return**.
This is the **true constant** **original virtue**,
which cannot depart from its place.
To return to the **creek** is like returning to the **Yellow Court**.
To return to the **infant** is to **nurture** the **sacred embryo** in stillness.

---
*"Know its white, preserve its black—
this is the **model** of the world.
As the **model** of the world,
**constant virtue** does not err,
and returns to the **Ultimate Void**."*

Here, the Sage exhausts the **principles of masculine and feminine**,
and expounds their **subtle workings**,
further illustrating them through **color and form**.
The **white** is the **essence of metal**,
the **black** is the **foundation of water**.
The **essence of metal**—
the masculine yang **spreads** within the feminine and **gives birth**.
Before this essence exists,
the **Kun Mother’s** body is **void**,
yet when she **interacts with** the **Qian Father’s** light,
Kun becomes **substantial** and forms **Kàn**.
With Kàn’s form already complete,
the moon **emits** the **Dui** phase—
this is called **metal within water**.
The **metal within water** truly **relies on** the **Kun Mother’s** nurturing to form,
thus it is called **mother *qi***.
*The Awakening to Reality* says:
*"Taking white from black is the elixir mother."*
The **mother *qi*** has a **white light**, called **yang light**.
When the **yang light** appears,
one **circulates** one’s own **mercury** to **welcome** it—
this is the **"two phases seeking medicine."**
When they **correspond**, the **two eights** of the same kind
are **seized** at once,
refined into **yang elixir**—the **elixir mother**.
Yet its **transformation** occurs externally,
so the **elixir mother** is only **external medicine**.
The adept **uses external medicine** to **refine internal medicine**,
with **mother *qi*** **concealing** the **child *qi***.
Within the **elixir mother**, **yang lead** is again produced—
**driving the River Vehicle** to **transport** it,
**reversing** to the **original palace**,
**concealing** in the **earthen pot**,
the **four phases harmonizing**, the **three clans** **interacting**—
this time, **joyful**, one attains **long life**.

Yet though the **method and function** are thus,
**knowing white** must first **preserve black**,
**preserving black** alone enables one to **know white**,
and **knowing white** still requires **preserving black**.
Within this are **three layers of subtle application**,
sufficient as the **model** for the world.
If one **follows** this and **acts** accordingly,
then **natural constant virtue** will not err.
Having not erred,
one may **return** and **verify** the **Ultimate Void**,
and **refine the spirit** back to **emptiness**.

**Knowing white** must **preserve black**—
the **yang enters** the **yin**.
**Preserving black** enables one to **know white**—
the **yang is born** within the **yin**.
**Knowing white** still requires **preserving black**—
the **spirit returns**, the **qi conceals**.
The **principles of heaven, earth, and ten thousand things**
are all thus.
Hence, this is the **model** for the world.

---
*"Know its glory, preserve its humiliation—
this is the **valley** of the world.
As the **valley** of the world,
**constant virtue** is **complete**,
and returns to the **Uncarved Block** (*pǔ*).
The **Uncarved Block** **scatters** to become **vessels**;
the Sage **uses** them,
and they become **officials and leaders**—
thus the **great measures** are **not severed**."

**Completing** humanity is the **glorious deed**."

**Chapter 29** *(River-Down Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Non-Action"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Divine Vessels")*

*"If one would take the world and act upon it,
I see that it cannot be done.
The world is a **divine vessel**—
it cannot be **made**.

To **make** it brings ruin;
to **grasp** it brings loss.
All things—some **move forward**, some **follow along**,
some **draw in** and **breathe in**, some **expand** and **blow out**,
some **are strong** with full **qi**, some **are weak** with feeble **qi**,
some **ascend** laden, some **descend** in ruin.
Thus, the Sage **removes excess**, **removes extravagance**, **removes excessiveness**.
The world is like the body within.
The **divine vessel** speaks of its supreme weight.
The **Great Dao** before heaven **accomplishes** through **natural non-action**.

Common folk doubt its emptiness and stillness,
so the Ancient Sage spoke thus to show them:
‘Do people take **non-action** for emptiness and stillness?
I would take the world and enforce **action**—
yet seeing those who act multiply their turmoil,
multiply their schemes, yet never complete nor rest—
the world’s **divine vessel** is too weighty.
With **action** and many affairs, it is not as good as **non-action** with few affairs.
Thus, it cannot be **made**.
To **make** in seeking completion brings ruin—**making** is what ruins it.
To **grasp** in seeking possession brings loss—**grasping** is what loses it.
The world is thus; all things are the same.
Things within the body—
some **yang** moves alone, some **yin** comes to follow,
some **contract** and **inhale**, some **expand** and **exhale**,
some **are strong** with robust **qi**, some **are weak** with tender **qi**,
some **ascend** bearing weight, some **descend** in collapse—
all are simply **natural** in their nature.
Thus, the Sage **practices the Way**, **removing extremes**, **removing arrogance and extravagance**, **removing excess and prodigality**.
These three are all diseases of **action**; hence, they are removed."*

---

**Chapter 30** *(River-Up Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Frugality and Martial Virtue"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Strong Arms")*

*"Those who **assist the sovereign** with the **Dao**
do not **strengthen the world with arms**—
their affairs **return** to good.
Where the army encamps, **thorns and brambles** grow.
After great armies, **years of famine** follow.
Thus, the **good** are **fruitful** alone—
they dare not **take strength**.
**Fruitful** yet **not proud**, **fruitful** yet **not boastful**, **fruitful** yet **not arrogant**,
**fruitful** yet **not forced**, **fruitful** yet **not by necessity**—
**strength** leads to **decay**; this is called **not the Way**,
and **not the Way** perishes early."*

*"The sovereign **strengthens virtue**, not arms.
Those who **assist the sovereign** with the **Dao**—
how could they **display martial might** before the world?
Yet some **boast** of their military prowess,
while others **withdraw** their armies to cultivate **cultural virtue**.
The world’s affairs often **return** to their opposite.
Only where the army passes do **thorns and brambles** grow—
a pity to see wounds inflicted.
After war’s passage, **famine years** arise—
the lingering poison of the battlefield’s **qi**.
Can arms be spoken of lightly?
The ancients who were **good with arms**
**rooted out bandits**, **suppressed violence**, **drove out evildoers**, and **settled the people**.
Their banners **bore the Dao**, like sweet rain descending.
They were **fruitful** only in **relieving distress**—
not daring to **take strength**.
Yet **fruitful** they must be—
**without pride**, **without boasting**, **without arrogance**.
Pride breeds **love of arms**, boasting breeds **exhaustion of arms**, arrogance breeds **vaunting of arms**.
Though **fruitful**, they lack good intent.
If **fruitful** with good intent, yet distress persists,
then great armies will not cease.
It lies in **relieving the people’s hardship** alone—
not in **displaying strength**.
Or if the enemy’s **qi** does not wane,
and the armies **hold the walls** in stalemate—
**strong arms** will become **aged arms**,
this too **harms our own forces**.
To **harm our own forces**—
though we seek to **punish the unrighteous**,
we instead **practice unrighteousness ourselves**.
To **punish the unrighteous** yet **practice unrighteousness**—
it is better to **fortify fields** and **defend**, to **rest and preserve** our armies.
Have those who **love strength** ever observed things?
**Strength leads to decay**—
one can foresee that **excess brings decline**.
To **use things** until they are **exhausted**—
this is **not in accord with the Way**.
**Not in accord with the Way**—
it is better to **cease early**.
Within this chapter, the **mystery of the Way** turns on the word **‘things’**.
It speaks of **action** and **making**—
all arise from **waning vitality** and **depleted qi**,
**forced** to perform **supplementary guidance**—
this too is **fruitful**.
As in **a hundred days** of **laying foundations**,
or **three years** of **refining oneself**—
again, **fruitful**.
Yet do not **boast** of **strength** in **fruitfulness**—
to **hold fullness** without ceasing
will surely bring **weakness and constraint**.
The **Great Medicine** nears—
delayed, it loses its use.
Thus it is said: **‘Strength leads to decay’**—
better to **cease early’."*

---

**Chapter 31** *(River-Up Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Laying Down Arms"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Fine Arms")*

---
**"‘Fine arms’—the word *佳* means ‘auspicious’—
yet ‘fine arms’ are called ‘not-auspicious’—
how can arms be deemed fine indeed?**

**Arms** are the most harmful of things—
none despise them more than those who do.
For their schemes are numerous, their disturbances manifold;
would **those who follow the Dao** ever take pride in such **‘fine arms’**?

Thus, the **gentle person** in their daily life
holds **auspicious left** dear—**left** is the seat of **good fortune**.
But when they wield **arms**, they hold **inauspicious right** dear—**right** is the seat of **calamity**.
This further shows that **arms** bring no **auspiciousness**.

Though **arms** are not the **gentle person’s** instrument,
there are times when they must be used—
to **relieve distress** is the highest purpose.
Do not let **impulsive intent** and **excessive fervor** arise;
let banners hang limp, and **tranquility** prevail.

Even if they **subdue the enemy** and return in triumph,
they never count **arms** as a **beautiful thing**.
If one does count **arms** as a **beautiful thing**,
their heart must surely **delight in killing**.

Those who **delight in killing**—
how can they be allowed to **fulfill their ambitions** in the realm?
How can they **exploit arms** across the world?

Observing human affairs, I sigh deeply—
**auspicious matters** are held to the **left**,
**inauspicious matters** to the **right**.
**Left** is **yang**—the principle of **life**—
**right** is **yin**—the principle of **death**.

Thus, in the **military**, there is the **Supreme Commander** and the **Vanguard Commander**.
The **Vanguard Commander’s** troops
dare not attack or kill without the **Supreme Commander’s** command.
Seeing the **Vanguard Commander’s** **intent to preserve life**,
their station is placed to the **left**.
The **Supreme Commander’s** **intent to kill**,
their station is placed to the **right**.
Stationed to the **right**, they are bound by **funeral rites**—
the most **inauspicious** affair under heaven.
Thus, the **Supreme Commander** is placed under **funeral rites**,
to warn them not to **kill lightly**.

Alas!
A **commander’s triumph** may cost **ten thousand bones**—
the sorrow is enough to **weep bitterly**.

Hence, when **killing is many**, it is met with **mourning tears**,
and **victory in war** is treated as a **funeral matter**.

The **heart of the Sage** is the **heart of heaven and earth**—
to **cherish life** above all.

*In my humble view:*
The chapter’s **allegory** speaks of the **auspiciousness of the female tripod**—
it is not yet ready to be used.
Yet its **condemnation of arms** is truly **painful and absolute.*

**Chapter 32**
*(River-Up Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Sage’s Virtue"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on the Nameless")*

---

**"The Dao is ever **Nameless** and **Uncarved**,
Though small, yet none under heaven dare **submit** to it.
If **lords and kings** could **guard** it,
All things would **voluntarily offer themselves** as **guests**.

When **heaven and earth** unite,
Sweet **dew** descends—
No one **commands** it, yet all are **evenly nourished**.
Once **institutions** are **established** and **names** are **given**,
Then **one knows when to stop**—
**Knowing when to stop** is how **disaster is avoided**.

**Compare** the Dao’s **presence** in the world
To **valleys and streams** in relation to **rivers and seas**."**

---

**Chapter 33**
*(River-Up Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Discerning Virtue")*

The Dao has no **form or likeness**—
Pure, a single **Uncarved** essence.
Like the **Unbounded**, though **Uncarved** is small,
Yet it stands above the **Supreme Polarity**—
How could it be **subdued** and brought low?

If **lords and kings** preserve their **Uncarved** nature,
Great **institutions** will not be **severed**,
And all things will **voluntarily** come as **guests**.

When the earth **reveres** the heaven,
Heaven and earth **harmonize**, and sweet **dew** descends—
No **artifice** is needed, yet all is **evenly balanced**,
As **qi** and **spirit** here **settle into equilibrium**.

When **qi** transforms into **essence**, it is first called **Golden Elixir**—
Once the name **"Golden Elixir"** is **established**,
Then one will **know when to stop**—
Nurturing it in an **earthen vessel**.

**Knowing when to stop** brings no **disaster**—
Only by **embracing Oneness** and **emptying the mind**,
Will one naturally **achieve tranquility**.

This is the Dao—
When applied to the world,
It is like **valleys and streams** to **rivers and seas**,
And all things find their **resting place**.

---

**Chapter 34**
*(River-Up Duke’s commentary: "Chapter on Fully Accomplishing")*

**Knowing others** grants **wisdom**,
**Knowing oneself** grants **clarity**.
**Overcoming others** requires **strength**,
**Overcoming oneself** grants **true power**.

**Knowing contentment** brings **wealth**.
**Firm resolve** reveals **determination**.
**Not losing one’s foundation** ensures **endurance**.
**Dying without perishing** is **longevity**.

Those who **understand human affairs** attain **refined wisdom**.
Those who **know their original nature** attain **perfect clarity**—
For they have **realized their true nature**.

Those who **overcome others’ desires** possess **steadfastness**.
Those who **conquer their own corrupting influences** possess **true strength**—
For they have **fulfilled their destiny**.

**Contentment preserves wealth**—
**Quelling desire** nurtures the **Elixir**.
**Firm resolve reveals determination**—
**Facing the wall for nine years** (in meditation).

**Once attained, it is eternally held**—
Like the earth, it endures.
**The heart dies, yet the spirit remains**—
Like the heavens, it attains **longevity**.

The Great Dao flows unbound—
It cannot be confined to left or right.

All things gaze upon it to take life,
Yet it does not refuse.
When deeds are done, it claims no possession.
It clothes all things yet claims no mastery—
Ever without desire, it may be called *small*;
All things return to it, yet it claims no mastery—
It may be called *great*.

Thus, the Sage never claims to be great,
And so achieves true greatness.

Boundless, it meets all needs—
One may draw from it without end.
All things rely on the Dao to live,
Yet it does not refuse—
Only acting in due time.
When deeds are done, it claims no possession.
Clothing all things, it does not rule—
Its virtue spreads wide, yet it is without action,
So none can name it as master.
Guarding the eternal and desiring nothing,
The small cannot break it—
Thus it may be called *small*.
Encompassing all, yet not ruling,
The great cannot contain it—
Thus it may be called *great*.

Only the Sage does not boast of his greatness—
This is why he is the *Great Sage*.

---

**Holding the Great Image, all under heaven comes.**
Coming, yet causing no harm—
Peaceful, serene, and at ease.
Delights and baits may lure passing guests to stop,
But the Dao, when spoken, is bland—
Tasteless to the tongue,
Invisible to the eye,
Inaudible to the ear,
Yet its use is inexhaustible.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Six (River Upper Master’s version: "Subtle Clarity")**
When one seeks to gather, one must first let go.
When one seeks to weaken, one must first strengthen.
When one seeks to abandon, one must first establish.
When one seeks to take away, one must first give.
This is called *Subtle Clarity*.

Softness overcomes hardness,
weakness overcomes strength.
A fish cannot escape the depths,
nor can the state’s sharpest tools be openly displayed to the people.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Seven**
The Dao acts without action yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could preserve it,
all things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation occurs and they wish to act,
I will subdue them with the nameless *Purity*.

The nameless *Purity* will also not wish to act.
Without desire, they will remain tranquil,
and the world will naturally align.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Eight**
The *Great Virtue* does not claim virtue—thus it has virtue.
The *Lesser Virtue* does not lose virtue—thus it has no virtue.
The *Great Virtue* acts without action yet nothing is left undone.
The *Lesser Virtue* acts with action yet nothing is accomplished.

The *Great Benevolence* acts yet nothing is left undone,
while the *Great Righteousness* acts yet something is accomplished.
The *Great Propriety* acts yet none respond—
so it forces its way, only to meet resistance.
Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue follows;
when virtue is lost, benevolence follows;
when benevolence is lost, righteousness follows;
when righteousness is lost, propriety follows.

For propriety is the thinnest layer of loyalty and trust,
yet the beginning of chaos.
*Preemptive Knowledge* is the adornment of the Dao,
yet the origin of folly.

Therefore, the noble person abides in the profound, not the superficial,
in the genuine, not the adorned.
Thus, they discard the latter and embrace the former.

---

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**
In the past, those who attained the *One*:
Heaven gained the *One* and became clear,
Earth gained the *One* and became tranquil,
The spirit gained the *One* and became responsive,
The grain gained the *One* and became abundant,
All things gained the *One* and flourished,
Lords and kings gained the *One* to establish rectitude for the world.

Their attainment was through the *One*.
If Heaven lacked clarity, it would fear collapse.
If Earth lacked tranquility, it would fear upheaval.
If the spirit lacked responsiveness, it would fear stagnation.
If the grain lacked abundance, it would fear depletion.
If all things lacked flourishing, they would fear annihilation.
If lords and kings lacked rectitude, their noble status would fear decline.

Thus, nobility stems from humility,
elevation from the foundation of lowliness.
Lords and kings call themselves "lonely and bereft,"
not seeking to be polished like jade or solitary like stone.
This is their grounding in humility, is it not?

Hence, they seek to avoid the clamor of many carriages,
not desiring the restless brilliance of jade
or the detached rigidity of stone.

The *One* is the origin of all multiplicity.

At the very beginning of creation, it was called the *One*—before the *One* came into being, there was nothing to grasp; after the *One* emerged, distinctions were made. To attain this *One*, one must return to the primordial.

Between before and after, there is *qi* without substance, and substance without *qi* is but an empty form. The Five Phases regard water as the *One*, for this water is the utmost of virtue and the utmost of clarity, an unfathomable power of *dharma* water. To name it "water" seems too forceful; to not name it "water" is also too void.

Now let us trace back from those who attain the *One*: The Dao begins with the *One* of old. Heaven opened from old, and through the *One* it opened. Yet without this water, there would be no division—how then would its clarity be seen?

Earth was divided from old, and through the *One* it was divided. Yet without this water, there would be no support—how then could its tranquility be established?

The spirit was revered from old, and through the *One* it was revered. Yet without this water, there would be no nourishment—how then could its responsiveness be illuminated?

The grain was attained from old, and through the *One* it was attained. Yet without this water, there would be no containment—how then could it aid in its abundance?

All things were formed from old, and through the *One* they were formed. Yet without this water, there would be no cultivation—how then could it provide for their flourishing?

Lords and kings became rulers from old, and the *One* was their ruler. Yet without this water, there would be no benefit to use—how then could they secure the stability and rectitude of the world?

Heaven, Earth, spirit, grain, all things, and lords and kings—each has its own form, yet the means by which they achieve clarity, tranquility, responsiveness, abundance, flourishing, and rectitude are all through the *One*.

Clarity without fracture comes from pure water-*qi*.
Tranquility without upheaval comes from bearing water-*qi*.
Responsiveness without stagnation comes from flowing water-*qi*.
Abundance without depletion comes from filled water-*qi*.
Flourishing without annihilation comes from nourishing water-*qi*.
Rectitude without decline—those of noble status—water’s virtue aids them, for its nature is to flow downward from lowliness.

From ancient times, rulers who were humble yet honored have shone. Thus, nobility stems from humility, elevation from the foundation of lowliness. "Lonely and bereft, not seeking grain"—this self-designation of lords and kings is indeed both humble and lowly. Yet those who do not know of their wealth in the Four Seas, their nobility as Heaven’s Son, or their jade-like sustenance from all quarters—it is through this very humility of "lonely and bereft" that they attain these things. Is this not the grounding in humility?

In general, lords and kings who preserve their humility are truly preserving the *One*.

Thus, from this perspective, one may extend to all things: as in the case of the *One* driving many carriages, where the multitude is recklessly harnessed, leading to ruin without awareness. Or as with jade’s restless brilliance and stone’s detached rigidity—these show the appearance of excess. Yet the *One* of the *Dao* does not desire to take them.

(Chapter Forty) *(The River-Upper Master’s annotated version was originally titled "Discarding Use")*

**Chapter Forty-One**
The return is the movement of the Dao;
The weak is the application of the Dao.
All things under Heaven are born from *having*;
*Having* is born from *non-being*.

**Return:** to restore.
When Heaven and Earth merge in obscurity, the first movement of the Dao is the coming of *One Yang* [returning].
**Weak:** softness.
When the body and mind are serene and tranquil, when *qi* is concentrated to achieve softness—this is the wondrous application of the Dao.

The matter of the *Returned Elixir* lies in merging the *having* of *Qian* [Heaven] with the *non-being* of *Kun* [Earth], planting the seed of *Qian* so that *Kun* bears it. From *non-being* arises *having*—thus the Dao is born from *having*, and *having* from *non-being*.
All things under Heaven are like this.

---

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Dao gives birth to *One*;
*One* gives birth to *Two*;
*Two* gives birth to *Three*;
*Three* gives birth to all things.

The Dao stands above the Three Powers and precedes the Five Phases. The *Taoist Master* discusses creation.
Thus, it must begin with the Dao.
The Great Dao is formless, boundless in its unity.
When motion arises from stillness, *One* then appears.
*One* is water, corresponding to *Kǎn* [the trigram].
*Kǎn* resides in the north, the trigram of labor.
All things begin and end through this.
To end is to return to the root;
To begin is the coming of *One Yang* [returning].
*Yang* is fire, hence though water is spoken of, fire is within—*One* gives birth to *Two*.
When water and fire are harmonized, when *yin* and *yang* are in accord, when wood stirs with vitality, when all things flourish—thus *Two* gives birth to *Three*, and *Three* to all things.

This broadly speaks of creation, yet the Dao of the *Returned Elixir* is also within it.

**Note:** Later Heaven’s sequence is disordered and complex; when the Five Phases are fully invoked, their numbers are complete.
Metal generates Water—*Four* generates *One*.
Water generates Wood—*One* generates *Three*.
Wood generates Fire—*Three* generates *Two*.
Fire generates Earth—*Two* generates *Five*.
Earth generates Metal—*Five* generates *Four*.

The Five Phases of Primordial Heaven are orderly and simple; three numbers suffice to encompass the five.
Water conceals fire within—*One* generates *Two*.
Wood thrives with fire’s vigor—*Two* generates *Three*.
When wood flourishes, it is the time when all things first emerge—*Three* can encompass all.
Moreover, in the practice of refining the elixir, the Five Phases are all contained within *One* and *Two*. When water and fire are cultivated in duality, the numbers *Three*, *Four*, and *Five* assist them—thus it is unnecessary to emphasize *Three* alone.
The *Taoist Master* speaks of *Three* to exhaustively encompass all things, hence the mention of the number *Three*.
Nor is it necessary to speak of *Two*—*One qi* is the elixir; *Two*, *Three*, *Four*, and *Five* assist it. The Five Phases are all contained within *One*.
Water conceals the *yang* fire within—*One* contains *Two*.
Water hides the wood-mercury—*One* contains *Three*.
Water reveals the metal-lead—*One* contains *Four*.
Water embraces true earth—*One* contains *Five*.
Nor is it necessary to speak of *One*—the obscure and formless, the embryo in void, can also be contained within the Dao.
Is not the art of the *Returned Elixir* supremely simple and easy?
Though words are many, they return to the utmost essentials—only their profundity is honored, not their excess.

All things bear *yin* externally and embrace *yang* within, blending *qi* to achieve harmony.
Above, it is said that *Three* gives birth to all things—*Three* is the number of wood.
Things flourish when wood is vigorous; wood thrives when fire is strong. Fire arises within water, thus the body of all things externally bears *yin* while internally embracing *yang*.

「Externally *yin* and internally *yang*, externally void and internally substantial—this void encompasses *yang qi*, which is called *chóngqì* (penetrating *qi*).
At this point, all things align with the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé).

Now, let us speak of this in terms of *elixir* (Dān) methods:
When the receptive (*Kūn*) interacts with the creative (*Jiàn*), the *yang* metal transforms into *Kǎn* (Abyss).
The Abyss’s form is externally void and internally substantial—thus, one must use penetrating void to contain its *qi*, just as the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé) breathes forth in *yīnyūn* (misty vapors).

What people despise—*singleness*, *widowhood*, and *barrenness*—are titles claimed by kings and nobles.
Thus, some things are diminished to gain, while others are gained to diminish.
What people teach, I also teach: the *strong* and *violent* shall not die as they wish—I shall take them as my disciples.

None are more reviled than those with *lowly names*—*singleness*, *widowhood*, and *barrenness*—yet kings and nobles embrace these titles.
Though it may tarnish their reputation, it truly benefits them.

Hence, when observing all things, there are those who gain by loss and lose by gain—this is understood through contemplating the *Dao* of the *Yì* (Book of Changes).

The *Pǐ* (Negation) hexagram: *yang* above and *yin* below, seeking to transform into *Yì* (Gain).
The *Way* of Heaven does not presume to exalt itself.
Thus, by diminishing above and augmenting below, the *Pǐ* (Negation) phase—where Heaven and Earth do not interact—can shift into the *Yì* (Gain) phase of *yang* descending upon *yin*.
Therefore, the virtuous person uses it to move toward goodness and amend faults.

The *Tài* (Greatness) hexagram: *yin* above and *yang* below, seeking to know the *Way* of diminishing.
The *Way* of Earth cannot be self-sufficient.
Thus, by diminishing below and augmenting above, the *Tài* (Greatness) phase—where Heaven and Earth interact—also follows its *Way* in the upward course of diminishing.
Therefore, the virtuous person uses it to restrain anger and curb desires.

Heaven and Earth gain by diminishing—thus, *to use gain is not as effective as to use diminishing*.

The two hexagrams stand equal, yet one should emulate the *Way* of the diminishing hexagram.
What of *mountains* and *marshes* diminishing? If inverted and applied, they become *wind* and *thunder* for gain.
*Mountains*, *marshes*, *wind*, and *thunder* respond in kind—this is precisely because of diminishing.

This is *teaching*; this is the *Yì*’s teaching; this is the teaching of the ancients.

The *Tàishàng* (Supreme Sage) said:
*"What people teach, I also teach"—*
I instruct people to know the *Way* of self-diminishing.*」

「What is not virtuous, the virtuous person’s foundation relies upon—
thus, the *Way* again employs the *strong and unyielding* as its *teaching father*.

The *strong and unyielding* are those who seize by force—
they diminish others to benefit themselves,
yet ultimately gain nothing.

*Father* and *foundation* share the same root,
both following the upper tone.

**Chapter 43** (*Héshànggōng*’s annotation reads *Biān yòng* [偏用] Chapter, *Péng*’s version is *Zhì róu* [至柔] Chapter)
【The most yielding in all under Heaven
can gallop across the most unyielding in all under Heaven.

There is none that enters the *void without interstices*—
thus, I know the *benefit* of *non-action*.

The *teaching* of *non-speech*,
the *benefit* of *non-action*—
few in all under Heaven can attain it.】

The most yielding: *qi* and *water*.
*Qi* finds no orifice it cannot penetrate,
*water* finds no path it cannot traverse—
thus, they can gallop across the most unyielding without obstruction.

Mountains expel stones,
springs pierce mountains—
this is evident.

The *void without interstices*: though lacking form and substance,
it is but *qi* and *water*—
they too can reach my body and enter without obstruction.
The first two lines speak generally of *qi* and *water* under Heaven,
while this line points to the self—
an illustration of the principle.

Again it says:
*"Thus, I know the benefit of non-action."*
*Non-action* means no need for exertion—
they naturally surge and clash.

By combining the *teaching* of *non-speech*
with the *benefit* of *non-action*,
none in all under Heaven can truly surpass it.

**Chapter 44** (*Héshànggōng*’s annotation reads *Lì jiè* [立戒] Chapter, *Péng*’s version is *Míng* [名] Chapter)
【Which is closer: *name* or *body*?
Which is more abundant: *body* or *wealth*?
Which brings greater suffering: *acquisition* or *loss*?

Thus, excessive love leads to great expenditure,
and excessive hoarding brings heavy loss.

Knowing *contentment* prevents disgrace,
knowing *cessation* averts peril—
thus one may endure long.】

*Body* is closer than *name*,
*body* is more abundant than *wealth*.
To *acquire* the *body* is without suffering,
to *lose* the *body* is suffering.

This is a clear principle.

Therefore, the *Supreme Sage* uses *which is closer*, *which is more abundant*, and *which brings greater suffering*
to awaken understanding,
so that people may realize it themselves—
not like later generations’ mere lectures,
which only scold and reprove,
thus inviting the public’s discontent.

This is the *Supreme Sage*’s virtue of humility and harmony.

Yet in this world, there are those who hold *name* dear while neglecting their *body*,
who value *wealth* more than their *body*,
who do not cherish *acquisition* of the *body* as precious,
nor lament *loss* of the *body* as painful.

Such folly stems from the weight of *name* and *profit*,
while the care for *body* and *mind* is light.

Is it not like the moment when breath ceases in the throat,
when the final hour arrives—
*name* vanishes into *nothingness*,
*wealth* dissipates into *emptiness*,
*loss* leads to the *realms of ghosts*,
and return to the human world is impossible—
this is truly painful!

In life, what establishes my *name* diminishes my *spirit*,
and what violates my *wealth* also violates my *body*—
this is what is meant by *excessive love leads to great expenditure*,
and *excessive hoarding brings heavy loss*.

When love reaches *great expenditure*,
this is *disgrace*.
When hoarding leads to *heavy loss*,
this is *peril*.

These are not strategies for enduring long.

The *Supreme Sage*, with compassion and pity,
speaks to enlighten and teach people:
*"Knowing contentment prevents disgrace,
knowing cessation averts peril—
thus one may endure long."*

This is the virtue of the *sage*.

When the **Great Achievement** seems incomplete,
its use is never exhausted.
When the **Great Fullness** seems empty,
its use is never depleted.
The **Great Straight** bends like a bow,
the **Great Skillful** appears clumsy,
the **Great Eloquent** seems tongue-tied.

**Agitation** conquers **cold**,
**stillness** conquers **heat**.
**Purity and tranquility** are the **right Dao** for all under heaven.

**Great Achievement** seems incomplete—
like the light of the sun and moon,
round yet momentarily obscured,
but when spread, it shines again—
thus its use is never exhausted.
**Great Fullness** seems empty—
like the vastness of the **Azure Sea**,
encompassing yet never overflowing,
boundless yet without end—
thus its use is never depleted.

The **overbearing** and **straight** are crude,
the **artful** are deceitful,
the **forceful** in argument are false—
all cannot align with the **Great**.

The **sage** and **worthy** use **qi** as their **straightness**,
not forcing **rigidity** yet naturally rigid,
as if bending—
their **divine subtlety** is their **skill**,
not flaunting **wisdom** yet naturally wise,
as if clumsy—
they practice **Dao** and cultivate **virtue** as their **eloquence**,
not speaking much yet speaking well,
as if tongue-tied.

As for **lead and fire** blending in harmony,
sufficient to ward off **three winters**,
or sitting in **meditation** on a **lotus seat**,
able to forget **nine summers**—
this is truly what is meant by:
**agitation** conquers **cold**,
**stillness** conquers **heat**.

These two principles—
the **logic of yin and yang**,
if one cultivates with a **pure and tranquil heart**,
observing the **agitated**, **humid**, **cool**, and **warm qi**,
then the **right Dao** for all under heaven is attained.

---
**Chapter 46** (*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Moderation in Desires"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Knowing Contentment"*)

When the **Dao** prevails in the world,
Horses of war are dismissed to till the fields.
When the **Dao** is absent from the world,
Warhorses breed upon the outskirts.

No guilt is greater than craving what is desirable,
No calamity is greater than failing to know contentment,
No fault is greater than grasping what one ought not take—
Thus, he who knows contentment as contentment
May ever remain content.

**Having the Dao** refers to the moment
When the **Yin** has reached its peak and **Yang** ascends.
**Lacking the Dao** refers to the moment
When the **Tai** cycle has run its course and **Yin** emerges.

When **Pi** chaos is settled and **Tai** order established,
Warhorses are withdrawn to manure the fields—
The world’s affairs have reached their limit.
When **Tai** order flourishes and **Pi** chaos lies dormant,
Warhorses are bred in the nearby suburbs—
The world’s affairs are soon to change.

Chaos returns, and **Tai** stability brings fortune.
To see what is desirable and desire it—
No greater guilt exists.
To be content yet remain uncontent—
No greater calamity exists.
To covet what one ought not take—
No greater fault exists.
Thus, he who takes contentment as contentment
May ever remain content.

**Annotation:**
*However* (去): to remove.
*Manure* (粪): to govern.
When the world is at peace, though horses are not used,
They are still kept.
The phrase "withdrawing them" means sending them to mountains and marshes,
As if returning them—no more.
Moreover, horses are not suited to tilling fields;
The phrase "to manure" implies that war is ended and agriculture flourishes.

**Chapter 47**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Discerning the Distant"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Doors and Windows*")

**Chapter 48**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Forgetting Knowledge"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Daily Diminishment"*)

Do not step outside the door to know the world.
Do not peer through the window to see the Dao/Way.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the Sage acts without moving yet knows,
Sees without looking yet names,
Accomplishes without doing.

**Annotations:**
*Door* (户): a small gate.
To know the world without stepping out—
The recluse’s way of understanding affairs.
*Window* (牖): a small window.
To see the Dao/Way without peering—
The hidden reveals the apparent.

The body, mind, nature, and vital breath—
Where the Dao resides.
To abandon the near for the distant—
The folly of the common man.
To gaze upon the unseen,
To listen to the unheard,
To grasp the intangible—
From where shall one begin the search?

He who understands this truth:
The Dao lies between doors and windows.
He who does not understand:
The more he inquires, the more lost he becomes.
The more he asks, the more divergent he strays.
Every path seems a way,
Yet none encompass the whole.
Thus it is said:
The farther one goes, the less one knows.

Only the Sage acts without moving yet knows—
When the spirit is settled, wisdom arises.
Sees without looking yet names—
By holding to the formless, the formed emerges.
Accomplishes without doing—
By embracing Oneness, returning to emptiness.

**Chapter 49**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Trusting Virtue"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on the Undivided Heart"*)

The Sage has no fixed heart,
Taking the hearts of the people as his own.
The virtuous, I treat with virtue;
The unvirtuous, I also treat with virtue.
Thus, virtue is complete.
The trustworthy, I trust;
The untrustworthy, I also trust.
Thus, trust is complete.
The Sage in the world,
With a gentle heart for the world,
The people all turn their ears and eyes toward him,
And the Sage treats them as children.

**Annotations:**
No fixed heart—
No partial or one-sided heart.
When the heart is undivided,
He can shield and embrace the people,
Merging with the hearts of the common folk.
What the people long for:
That the Sage treat them with virtue, with trust.
To treat the unvirtuous with virtue,
To trust the untrustworthy—
The Sage’s sincerity and authenticity are profound.

Thus, the Sage in the world,
With a gentle heart for the world,
Shields and embraces the people’s ears.
The people all turn their ears and eyes,
Gazing upward, listening downward,
Each with their own expectations—
The Sage treats them as children,
Thus achieving harmony.

**Chapter 50**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Valuing Life"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Nurturing Life"*)

To be born is to enter death.
Those who cling to life—
Thirteen out of ten.
Those who accept death—
Thirteen out of ten.
The people’s birth is their movement toward death’s ground—
Also thirteen out of ten.
Why so?
Because their attachment to life is excessive.

---

Now the Sage who nurtures life well,
Walks on land yet meets no rhinoceros or tiger,
Enters battle yet is not harmed by armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,
The tiger finds no place to place its claws,
Weapons find no room to wield their blades.
Why so?
Because there is no place of death for him.

All things are born and then enter death,
Yet all lie within the thirteen out of ten.
Now, the thirteen out of ten—
All previous commentaries have failed to grasp its true meaning,
And I shall now elucidate it.
Ten is the number of Heaven and Earth’s creation.
One Heaven, one Earth,
One **Yáng** (乾), one **Yīn** (坤).
The **Yáng** hexagram has three **Yáng** lines,
The **Yīn** hexagram has three **Yīn** lines.
All things encounter the three **Yáng** lines and are born,
Encounter the three **Yīn** lines and die.
Yet for humanity’s birth,
They share in the three **Yáng** lines with all things,
But when entering the three **Yīn** lines, they hasten it themselves.
The seven emotions and six desires
Severely deplete the primordial spirit—
Hence, it is said: *"to move is to enter the realm of death."*

Yet even when they hasten death themselves,
They still return to the three **Yīn** lines.
Why do things and humans have three births and three deaths?
Because excessive attachment to life
Leads to death being extinguished, yet life again added.
When death is extinguished, life stirs once more—
This is the cyclical, interdependent force.
Otherwise, if there were birth without death,
The myriad things would proliferate endlessly, filling the world—
How then could there be any orderly settlement?

Though all things die in winter and are born in spring,
Their birth and death are merely transformations of movement and stillness.
As for humans, once dead, they do not rebirth—
Not because Heaven and Earth’s transformations wait for them,
But because they do not know how to nurture life,
Thus they fall long into the realm of death.

The **Tian Di** (Heaven-Earth) has the virtue of abundant life,
The Sage has the method of nurturing life—
If humans diligently seek it,
They should reverse the **Yáng**-born **Yīn**-dying Dao,
Transforming it into the **Yáng**-advancing **Yīn**-retreating function,
Then longevity and enduring vision may be achieved,
And they shall not be the same as those who are born and die,
Moving into the realm of death like common folk.

Things have three **Yáng** lines for their birth,
And three **Yīn** lines for their death.
The Dao of nurturing life,
Is to embed one **Yáng** line within the three **Yīn** lines of the **Yáng** hexagram,
Thus **Yīn** becomes solid and forms the **Kǎn** (坎) hexagram.
The three **Yīn** lines of the **Yīn** hexagram,
Sprout one **Yīn** line within the three **Yáng** lines,
Thus **Yáng** becomes hollow and forms the **Lí** (离) hexagram.
**Kǎn** and **Lí**—these are the medicinal substances.
Entering the chamber to cultivate in stillness,
Observe my one **Yáng** line returning and reviving—
Then practice the nurturing method,
Making it rise and fall.
This is the Dao of **Huán Dàn** (还丹),
The function of returning to the origin,
The art of extending life,
The secret of attaining immortality.

To reverse and return is nurturing,
To descend and ascend is nurturing,
To externalize and internalize is nurturing—
Within, there is the **Huáng Pó** (黄婆),
Only then can nurturing be achieved.
Nurturing is not easily spoken of.
When the **Zǐ** (子) and **Mǔ** (母) are deeply intertwined,
Their cultivation runs profound—
When the infant and maiden coexist,
Their joy is boundless—
When **Yīn** (铅) and **Yáng** (汞) coalesce,
The sacred embryo forms—
When **Wu Wéi** (无为) is verified,
The **Yáng** spirit emerges.
Though rhinoceros, tiger, and weapons of war exist,
They have no place to wreak havoc—
How could they then have three **Yáng** lines for birth,
And three **Yīn** lines for death,
Like ordinary humans and things?

**Chapter 51**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Nurturing Virtue"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Revering and Honoring"*)

The **Dao** gives birth to it,
**Virtue** (德) nurtures it,
Things take form from it,
And **shì** (势, force/condition) completes it.
Thus, all things do not fail to revere the **Dao** and honor **Virtue**.
The **Dao**’s reverence,
**Virtue**’s honor—
None command them, yet they ever arise naturally.
Hence, the **Dao** gives birth to it,
**Virtue** nurtures it, lengthens it, and cultivates it,
Completes it, matures it,
Fosters it, and protects it.
It gives birth yet does not possess it,
Acts yet does not rely upon it,
Lengthens yet does not rule it.
This is called **Xuán Dé** (玄德, Mysterious Virtue).

The **Dao** sows things,
**Virtue** guards things—
Thus things are born by the **Dao** and nurtured by **Virtue**.
Things manifest their forms,
And **shì** (势) alone can complete them.
All things revere the **Dao** and honor **Virtue**,
Because the **Dao** is nameless, while **Virtue** has a name;
The **Dao**’s reverence,
**Virtue**’s honor—
**Dao** and **Virtue** have no need to command or enforce,
Things’ nature spontaneously aligns.
Only the **Dao** governs birth,
Only **Virtue** governs nurturing.
To lengthen, cultivate, and mature—
And to foster and protect—
Binding and preserving the whole spirit,
All are **Virtue**’s techniques.
Not possessing, not relying, nor ruling—
Achieving without action is true enlightenment.
**Xuán Dé** (玄德) is the highest **Virtue**.

**Chapter 52**
(*River Master’s version: "Chapter on Returning to the Origin"; Peng’s version: "Chapter on Having a Beginning"*)

The world has a beginning,
Which serves as the mother of the world.
Having obtained its mother,
One may know its child.
Having known its child,
One must again guard its mother,
And thus, throughout life, one shall not perish.
Block its **Yuè** (兑, Joy),
Close its gate,
And one shall never tire throughout life.
Open its **Yuè** (兑),
And aid its affairs,
Yet one shall never be saved throughout life.
To perceive the small is clarity,
To guard the soft is strength.
Using its light,
Yet returning to its clarity,
One shall not suffer bodily harm.
This is called **Xí Cháng** (袭常, Following the Constant).

The **Dao** of the world has an end, yet must have a beginning;
Indeed, its beginning is not a single point.

**Jīn Dān** (金丹, Golden Elixir) has:
A place of origin, matters of practice, and substances of return.
What is the place of origin?
It is the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace and the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) Furnace—
The **Yīn Yáng** (阴阳, Yin-Yang) Furnace, for within the **Yīn** (阴, Yin) lies concealed the **Yáng** (阳, Yang).
The **Yǎn Yuè** (偃月, Reclined Moon) Furnace, for the moon manifests in the **Yuè** (兑, Joy) direction.
The **Xiān Tiān Miào Dǐng** (先天妙鼎, Primordial Wondrous Cauldron), for **Yuè** (兑) is the young maiden.

*The Awakening to Reality* (《悟真》) speaks of “the **Chuǎn Yào Chuān Yuán** (产药川源, Birthplace of the Elixir’s Stream),” all referring to the place of origin.

What are the matters of practice?
To attain utmost emptiness, to steadfastly preserve stillness—
Then I observe its return.
With mud, one clarifies;
With stillness, one slowly purifies.
With tranquility, one endures;
With waiting, one carefully nurtures.
All these are matters of practice.

What is the substance of return?
**Hún Hún** (混混) becomes **Chéng Chéng** (成成),
**Yǎo Yǎo** (窈窈) meets **Míng Míng** (冥冥),
Within which there is **Xìn** (信, Faith),
Within which there is **Jīng** (精, Essence).
The **Pǔ** (朴, Uncarved Primordial) without name,
The **Jīn** (金, Metal) without form—
All these are the substances of return.

The **Golden Elixir** (还丹) begins with this **Jīn** (金, Metal),
Thus it is called “having a beginning.”
Yet this **Jīn** (金, Metal) is not originally the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) family’s possession,
But the **Huǒ Jīng** (火精, Fire Essence) of the **Jiān** (乾, Heaven) family.

The **Dān Fǎ** (丹法, Elixir Method) takes **shā** (砂, sand) as its foundation,
Placed in the **Kūn** (坤, Earth) Furnace to form **Kǎn** (坎, Abyss),
Harmonized with the **Yù Pó** (玉池, Jade Pool)’s **shuǐ yín** (水银, mercury) to create **wù tǔ** (戊土, Fifth-Earth Soil),
Which is the **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir).

The **Yáng Dān** (阳丹, Yang Elixir) is the **Wài Dān** (外丹, External Elixir),
The **External Elixir** is the **Dān Běn** (丹本, Elixir Root),
The **Jīn Huā** (金花, Golden Flower) is it,
The **Zhēn Zhǒng** (真种, True Seed) is it,
The **Huáng Yá** (黄芽, Yellow Sprout) is it,
The **Bái Xuě** (白雪, White Snow) is it.
The **External Elixir** serves as the mother of the **Nèi Dān** (内丹, Internal Elixir),
Thus the beginning is called the mother of the world.

The mother has a sacred name: **Yáng Qiān** (阳铅, Yang Lead).
With **Yang Lead** as mother,
There is **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) as child.
**Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞) is the **Hòu Tiān** (后天, Postnatal) essence of the child,
**Yáng Qiān** (阳铅) is the **Xiān Tiān** (先天, Primordial) essence of the mother.
When the **Yang Lead** from the outer realm subjugates the **Yīn Gǒng** (阴汞, Yin Mercury) of the inner realm,
The mother and child unite—
Thus one knows its child.

Yet the arrival of this **Yang Lead** requires the subtle application of **Huǒ Gōng** (火功, Fire Work).
For **lead** (铅) is generated in the **Kǎn Gōng** (坎宫, Abyss Palace),
Heavy and unrising.
To seize and control the **Zhēn Gǒng** (真汞, True Mercury) of the **Lí Gōng** (离宫, Separation Palace),
One must apply fierce **wǔ huǒ** (武火, Martial Fire) to boil,
Then it ascends in leaps and bounds.
After the **Yang Lead** and **True Mercury** meet,
One must then preserve the **Shì Chéng** (守城, Fortifying) and **Mù Yù** (沐浴, Bathing) stages,
Never again applying **Martial Fire**.

At first, the mother clings to the child in coming,
Then the child clings to the mother in dwelling—
Thus it is said, *“Having known its child, one must again guard its mother.”*
When mother and child cling to each other,
One shall not perish throughout life—
Then the Great Elixir is complete.

The Great Elixir is called **Nèi Yào** (内药, Internal Medicine),
The **Sèng Tāi** (圣胎, Sacred Embryo) is this,
The **Yīng’ér** (婴儿, Infant) is this,
The **Zhēn Rén** (真人, True Person) is this.

Those who cultivate the **Internal Elixir** must possess **Tiānrán Zhēn Huǒ** (天然真火, True Heavenly Fire),
Endlessly nurtured within the **Tǔ Fǔ** (土釜, Earthen Cauldron),
Yet also rely on the **Yīn Yáng Fú Huǒ** (阴阳符火, Yin-Yang Talismanic Fire) of the external furnace,
Diligently refining and adjusting.

By drawing and replenishing,
One transforms form into **qi** (气),
And **qi** into **shén** (神, Spirit).
When form and spirit are both perfected,
They align with the **Dao** in truth.
Thus one must block its **Yuè** (兑, Joy),
And close its gate,
For the entire life’s work lies here.

Nurturing both kinds—
The **Wén Huǒ** (文火, Gentle Fire) within and the **Fú Huǒ** (符火, Talismanic Fire) without—
Preserving the full ten months,
Abandoning contrivance to realize non-action,
One dare not tire from external affairs,
Lest they disrupt the inner stillness.

*The Three Harmonies* (《参同》) states:
*“Firmly block its interactions,
Endeavor to complete its solidity.
Observe and wait with utmost caution,
Carefully adjust its cold and warmth.
Circulate through the twelve nodes,
When each node is exhausted, again draw near.”*
This is the method of nurturing.

The inner realm does not escape,
The outer realm does not intrude—
Blocking **Yuè** (兑) and closing the gate
Is the essential key.

If one does not block its **Yuè** (兑),
And instead daily engages with external affairs,
The **Dao** Family often speaks of temporal matters—
This is to seek aid in external schemes,
Yet already one has injured the inner cultivation.
When the mouth opens, **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) scatters;
When the mind is unsettled, **Fire Work** weakens.
The Great **Dao** of longevity
I fear may not be fulfilled—
Thus it is said: *“Aid its affairs, yet one shall never be saved throughout life.”*

To perceive the small is called clarity—
The **Jīn Guāng** (金光, Golden Light) of the elixir,
Its form like **shǔ mǐ** (黍米, millet grains),
Thus it is called small.
To see this small is called clarity.

To guard the soft is called strength—
The **Wáng Shuǐ** (王水, King Water) of the body,
Its **qi** originally balanced and gentle,
Thus it is called soft.
To guard this soft is called strength.

The **Guāng** (光, Light) is the **shén** (神, Spirit),
That is, the **Golden Light**.
The **Míng** (明, Clarity) is the **qì** (气, Qi),
That is, the **Jīn Jīng** (金精, Metal Essence).
When the **Golden Light** envelops the **Metal Essence**,
Then light and clarity are concealed within,
And **shénqì** (神气, Spirit-Qi) rely upon each other.

When the embryonic nurturing is complete,
One escapes the calamities of the body—
Thus it is said: *“Using its light, yet returning to its clarity, one shall not suffer bodily harm.”*
This is called the **Dao** of *Following the Constant* (袭常),
The cultivation of longevity and enduring vision.

*Following the Constant* means guarding its true constancy.

**Mountain Evaluation**: This chapter is explained verse by verse with clarity,
Each word extracted with precision—
The **Dao** of the **Golden Elixir** is fully revealed here.
I have often said that the **Tàishàng** (太上, Supreme) Classic,
Though concise in meaning,
Even true immortals cannot fully grasp—
Yet how clear are these annotations!
Delightful indeed!
Exceedingly joyous!

**Chapter Fifty-Three**
*(River Master’s version titled "Beneficial Proof," Peng’s version titled "Jiérán")*

*"Let my family’s resolve be firm and knowing,
Walking the Great Dao—only *shī* is to be feared.
The Great Dao is most level,
Yet the people prefer shortcuts.
The court’s offices are stripped bare,
Fields lie fallow and overgrown,
Granaries stand empty.
They adorn themselves in embroidered finery,
Belt on sharp blades,
Glut on food and drink,
Hoard wealth in excess—
This is called *stealing with a pole*.
Not the Dao! Not the Dao!"*

**Explanation:**
*"I"* refers to my lineage, not the Sage-King’s self-designation.
*"Jiérán"* means steadfast resolve.

My family’s nature is round and luminous—
When my resolve is firm and knowing,
I possess steadfast resolve and perfect awareness.
Practicing the Great Dao,
Only *shī* is to be feared.

If *shī* is applied, it leads to ordinary attainment,
Draining my true essence—
Thus it is to be feared.
Accumulating essence and refining qi
Is the level path of the Great Dao,
The way all may tread.

The people’s hearts crave shortcuts,
Striving for crooked paths.
Frivolous deeds invite calamity,
Draining essence, scattering spirit.

Like the court’s old offices—
Once stripped of their rank,
The original yang is utterly lost.
Like the boundaries of fields—
All overgrown with weeds,
The orifices are all blocked.
Like the granaries’ stores—
All wasted away,
The essence and qi are utterly depleted.

They merely adorn themselves in embroidered finery,
Belt on sharp blades,
Chase after those who glut on food and drink,
And vainly imagine wealth is sufficient.
Such people
Take stealing the Dao as their heart’s intent—
Like one stealing through a wall with a pole,
Darkly snatching objects—
This is merely called *stealing with a pole*.
How could this be the Dao?
How could this be the Dao?

**Chapter 54** (*Guangshang Gong’s commentary reads "Xiu Guan" [修观], Peng’s reads "Shan Jian" [善建]*)
The **Way of True Virtue** is unshaken,
The **Way of True Embrace** is unbroken,
Thus their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.

Cultivate it in the self—its **virtue** becomes genuine.
Cultivate it in the family—its **virtue** overflows.
Cultivate it in the village—its **virtue** endures.
Cultivate it in the realm—its **virtue** abounds.
Cultivate it in the world—its **virtue** is universal.

Thus, observe the self through the self,
Observe the family through the family,
Observe the village through the village,
Observe the realm through the realm,
Observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

**True Virtue** stands firm at the center—thus it is unshaken.
**True Embrace** clings to the One without separation—thus it is unbroken.
The child returns to give birth to the grandchild—**virtue** manifests in form—thus sacrifices never cease.
Self, family, village, realm, and world—these are the stages of cultivating **virtue**.

*Yi* (以): by means of.
*Guan* (观): to demonstrate the **Dao**.

By means of the self, the **Dao** is demonstrated in the self,
And thus the **Dao** is demonstrated in the family, realm, and world—all from this genuine **Dao**-body.

When **virtue** is complete in the self,
The demonstration of the **Dao** is boundless,
Thus the world is known through this.

**Chapter 55** (*Guangshang Gong’s commentary reads "Xuan Fu" [玄符], Peng’s reads "Han De" [含德]*)
The depth of **virtue** contained
Is likened to that of an infant.
Venomous insects do not sting,
Fierce beasts do not seize,
Raptors do not snatch.

Bones frail, sinews soft, yet grasp is firm.
Unknowing of male and female union yet remains intact—**virtue** is at its peak.
All day wailing and swallowing without hoarseness—**harmony** is at its peak.

To know **harmony** is to know **constancy**,
To know **constancy** is to know **clarity**.
To grow with benefit is called **auspicious**.
The heart commanding *qi* is called **force**.

When things flourish, they age—this is called *not* the **Dao**,
And *not* the **Dao** brings early decline.

*Han* (含): to cherish.
Cherishing **virtue** deeply is the **True Person** (真人).
The **True Person**’s heart
Does not lose the infant’s heart,
Thus likened to an infant—purely forgetful of things.

Thus, even evil insects and beasts do not harm.
Bones frail, sinews soft—this is the infant’s body,
Yet its grasp is firm.

When people know of male and female union,
Then the infant’s **virtue** is diminished and life is lost.
The infant, unknowing, retains **virtue** at its purest—
It has no desires.

*Nou* (朘): the infant’s **yin** essence, also to shrink.
The common folk use *gōu suō* (肭缩) for *nou suō* (朘缩), meaning to shrink without lifting.

When people rage, their *qi* becomes hoarse,
But the infant has wailing and swallowing without hoarseness.
Wailing is calling out,
Swallowing is gulping.
All day calling and gulping without hoarseness—
This is the peak of **harmony** in *qi*.

If one knows **harmony**, then **constancy** is guarded without fail.
If one knows **constancy**, then **True Clarity** is naturally present.

Indeed, there are benefits to human life—
The infant’s auspicious and harmonious *qi*.
If one were to possess knowledge and awareness,
And command *qi* with the heart,
Then it would reverse softness and become **force**.

The world’s lovers of **force** have also observed this in things.
The last three sentences are explained in the previous thirty chapters.

**Chapter 56**

---

**(Chapter 57 – *Original text: 淳风章*)**

**[With rectitude govern the realm,
With subtlety wield the forces,
With non-action claim the world.
How do I know this to be so?
Because of this.**

**Chapter 57**

---

「The *Daoist* Master of the Yellow River’s commentary calls this the *Chapter of Mysterious Virtue* (玄德章), while Peng’s version names it *Chapter of Mysterious Unity* (玄同章).

**The knowing do not speak,
The speaking do not know.**
*Seal its mouth* (塞其兑), *shut its door* (闭其门),
*Dull its sharpness* (挫其锐), *unravel its tumult* (解其纷),
*Harmonize its radiance* (和其光), *unify its dust* (同其尘)—
This is called **Mysterious Unity** (玄同).

It cannot be grasped as intimate,
Nor as distant,
Nor as beneficial,
Nor as harmful,
Nor as noble,
Nor as lowly.
Thus, it is the most noble under heaven.

The knowing are those who have attained through practice.
The unspeaking are difficult to articulate,
For their profound cultivation and self-realization
Yearn to speak yet the tongue cannot keep pace.
If one merely values speech,
And claims, *“I have mastered the true scriptures of the Daoists,
Their transmission is complete,
No need for a teacher’s guidance—
My Way is ready to be walked.”*
How could they know that **True** is indeed **True**,
Yet the subtle intricacies, the refined analogies,
The deep mechanisms of its teachings—
I fear they have not yet fully explored them?

Moreover, **ascending to the True** and entering the **Dao**,
Is none other than **returning to the elixir** (还丹).
Once the **elixir’s principles** (还丹理) are clear,
Only then can one attain the **Dao**.
Now I ask you:
What are the **乾坤坎兑**—the **Hexagrams of Heaven, Earth, Water, and Fire**?
What are the **龙虎汞铅**—the **Dragon, Tiger, Mercury, and Lead**?
What are the **宾主雌雄**—the **Guest, Host, Yin, and Yang**?
How does one **体认** (embody and recognize) **恍惚杳冥**—the **flickering and boundless**?
How does one **安排** (settle) **浮沉颠倒**—the **rising and sinking, inversions**?

And yet, unless the **Mysterious Mother** (玄牝) is illuminated,
One cannot achieve **transformation**.
Unless the **Yellow Mother** (黄婆) is invoked,
How can one attain **consummation**?

Furthermore, the **words are hard to convey**,
The **grace and awe are hard to spread**,
The **first opportunity is hard to find**,
The **fire’s intensity is hard to know**.
And yet, some say:
The ancients declared: *“The Great Elixir’s affair
Must be pursued with the aid of those of great power.”*
To seek the **wondrous methods of those of great power**—
Ask me: Where are such teachings recorded?

**Even more so**, the **practice and discipline** (功夫行持)
Cannot be borrowed from books.
To **abandon desire for beauty**,
To **forsake wealth for gain**,
To **reject affection for virtue**,
To **cultivate conduct with caution**—
These are all **essential bodily practices and moral disciplines**,
Yet none can be fully grasped from books alone.

Only those with **true hearts who love the Dao**,
Who move the heavens above,
Whose **earthly attachments dissolve**,
Whose **divine clarity silently aids**—
Only these can truly know its **Way**.

To **follow the map and seek the horse** (按图索骥),
Is it enough to exhaust its subtleties?
Thus, the knowing do not speak,
The speaking do not know—
Because there are things **too profound to articulate**.

Some say:
*“Those who know are indeed hard to speak of,
But how does one hear of the luminous Way
Of those who do not know?
Is it not through those who can speak
Guiding them to knowledge?”*
The **Elixir Scriptures** say:
*“Obtaining a teacher’s oral transmission (口诀),
Only then can one attain the Way.”*
It seems that the knowing must speak,
And the speaking must know.
Please explain further.

The **oral transmission** (口诀) are **intimate words**,
**Subtle utterances**—
Layer upon layer, **pierced and revealed**,
Only then does it become **oral transmission**.
It is not merely a few phrases or sentences
That suffice as **oral transmission**.

The **Yellow Emperor sought Broad Success** (广成),
And they spoke **refined matters for three days**.
My **teacher met Master Zhong** (钟祖),
And they **sat in discourse for a decade**.
Even the **heavenly saints** (天亶圣人),
The **highest roots of the Daoists** (上根仙器),
Could not be fully understood in a few words—
How much less so for those below them?

Nowadays, people regard **oral transmission** as a **quickened secret**,
But this is all incorrect.
Unless **oral transmission** is fully exhausted,
The teacher departs and returns.
During their **instructive inquiries**,
One must **listen attentively, absorb deeply, and remember truly**.
Then, it can **connect with the ancient texts**,
And **illuminate the layered principles**.
This is the **wondrous essence of oral transmission**—
When people read the **Elixir Scriptures**, if they have many,
Yet upon hearing the **oral transmission**,
They **suddenly awaken**—
Using the **Scriptures to verify the transmission**,
Using the **transmission to verify the Scriptures**,
True and not hollow,
In accord with the **Great Dao**.
This is why **true teachers must be sought**,
And why **bright minds cannot rely on mere cleverness alone**.

Moreover, **true teachers** are **rooted in the original**,
Their **foundation is the soil of yin virtue** (阴德之土),
Refined and cultivated—
How could they not know the **heavy mysteries of the Dao**?
Heaven grants these **secret words** to the **good**,
Yet not to the **unworthy**.
If one knows yet **speaks lightly of them**,
Then **Zhu Yang** (紫阳) would have **three times banished** them.
Their **silence is not mere reluctance to speak lightly**—
Even if **great vessels meet**,
And the **urgency of passing the torch** is keen,
They must **test repeatedly and temper thoroughly**.
Only then, after the **disciple’s diligent suffering**,
Does the **teacher reveal the fragrance, spread the teachings, and pass the bowl**.
This is the **future lineage’s unfolding**—
Beware of hearing yet **not practicing**,
Or obtaining yet **keeping secret**.
When spoken of thus,
Is it not **difficult**?

My **commentary on the *Laozi’s Dao De Jing***,
Though more detailed than the explanations of earlier sages,
Still, in **sequentially annotating each chapter**,
I **follow the Scriptures’ remnants**,
Yet **cannot fully expound the Dao’s wondrous mechanisms** in continuous passages.
**Heroes and resolute scholars**,
Fortunate are those who **find a clear teacher**
To **pierce and reveal**—
Then their **attainment of the law** will be all the easier.

**Discussing the first two lines of this chapter**,
*Sealing the mouth* (塞兑) and *shutting the door* (闭门)
Is **nurturing the spirit and *qi*** (养神气).
*Dulling the sharpness* (挫锐) yet **not being dulled by it**,
Is **guarding the weak**.
*Unraveling the tumult* (解纷) yet **not being disturbed by it**,
Is **remaining steadfast and composed**.
*Harmonizing the radiance* (和光) yet **keeping its luminosity hidden**,
*Unifying the dust* (同尘) yet **rising above it**.
Mencius said:
*“The sage’s relation to the people is like this.”*
This is the **essence of Mysterious Unity**.

Thus, it cannot be grasped as intimate,
Nor as distant—
If it could be grasped as intimate,
Then it could be grasped as distant.
If it cannot be **beneficial or harmful**,
If it cannot be **noble or lowly**,
It is the same in this regard.
Thus, it is the **most noble under heaven**,
With **no greater nobility than the sage’s virtue**.

**Chapter 57**

The world abounds in taboos and prohibitions,
Yet the people grow ever poorer.
The people possess many sharp implements,
And the state becomes ever more corrupt.
The people develop many skills and artifices,
And strange, licentious things proliferate.
Laws and decrees grow ever more explicit,
And thieves and robbers multiply.
Thus the sage says:
*“I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.
I love tranquility, yet the people align themselves.
I create no affairs, yet the people grow rich.
I have no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.”*

**Steadfastness** (正) is not merely upright posture—
It is the teaching of reverence,
Causing them to be moved and trust.
**Mysterious Unity** (奇) is not the same as deceitful scheming—
It is the teaching of quiet restraint,
Making them hard to fathom.
Thus, the sage must govern with **steadfastness**,
And employ **Mysterious Unity** in warfare.

To take the world with **non-action** (无事),
Is to achieve success with **non-action** (无为).
This is the way to know the **Dao/Way of governing the world** (治世之道)
Through the **Dao/Way of cultivating oneself** (治身之道).

When the court abounds in taboos and prohibitions,
Greedy and base ministers advance,
And thus the people are made poor.
When the people possess many sharp implements,
Crafty and deceitful individuals arise,
And thus the state grows corrupt.
When skills and artifices please the ruler,
Strange and licentious things must proliferate.
When laws and decrees oppress the people,
Thieves and robbers will surely increase.
These are all deviations in governance.

Thus, the sage further cites the words of the ancients,
To observe the **constant principle of governance** (治道之常),
Which lies in the distinction between **having desires** (有欲) and **without desires** (无欲).

**Chapter 58**

---

When governance is **obscure and unassuming** (閟閟),
Its people are **sincere and pure** (醇醇).
When governance is **overly scrutinizing and strict** (察察),
Its people are **deceitful and cunning** (缺缺).
Calamity (祸) is where fortune (福) leans,
Fortune is where calamity lurks.
Who knows its limits?
It is because there is no **steadfastness** (正).

**Steadfastness** (正) becomes **Mysterious Unity** (奇),
**Virtue/power** (德) becomes **bewitching** (妖).
The people’s confusion is longstanding.

Thus, the sage is square yet does not cut,
Honest yet does not harm,
Direct yet does not overreach,
Bright yet does not dazzle.

When governance is **unassuming and sincere** (醇醇)—its simplicity fostering tranquility—
the people find peace in stillness.
When governance is **rigid and exacting** (察察),
the people grow **negligent and evasive** (缺缺).

Where misfortune and fortune intertwine,
few grasp their true measure—
for who can guard **steadfastness** (正) when none perceive its bounds?
The words *"steadfast"* and *"know"* carry a sigh:
how can one uphold what is unseen?

**Steadfastness** (正) is the straight **Dao/Way**,
yet when abandoned, it twists into **strangeness and deceit**.
**Virtue/power** (德) is harmony itself,
yet without it, it curdles into **omen and malevolence**.
Thus, when the people stray so long—
is it not the work of years?

*"Cutting"* (割) is severing,
*"wounding"* (刿) is harm,
*"overreaching"* (肆) is reckless haste,
*"dazzling"* (耀) is ostentation—
all lead the people astray.

Only the sage is **square without sharp edges**,
upright yet unyielding in injury,
walking the straight path while concealing brilliance—
thus aligning with the **Dao/Way’s true course**.

**Chapter 59**

The **Dao/Way** of governing people and serving **Heaven**—
none surpasses **frugality** (啬),
this is called *"early service"*.

*"Early service"* means accumulating **virtue/power** (德) in abundance,
accumulating **virtue/power** (德) in abundance means nothing is unconquered,
nothing is unconquered means none can fathom its limits,
none can fathom its limits—
then one may possess a **state**.

A **state** is the root of longevity,
one may endure for ages.
This is called the **Dao/Way** of *deep-rooted and firm*,
of *eternal life and lasting vision*.

---
**Frugality** (啬): parsimony.
**Early service** (早服): refers to enriching the state and bringing peace to the people.
**Accumulating virtue/power** (积德): refers to the people’s peace securing the state’s wealth and prosperity.
**Unconquered** (克): victorious.

Just as treating affairs with **frugality** (啬) brings wealth and peace to the state,
so the people’s peace ensures the state’s wealth and victory in war—
victory in war means none can know its end.
When benevolence overflows and kindness runs deep,
one must surely gain the **state**.

**State** (国): refers to the foundation of the realm.
The realm’s foundation established,
one deposits true sand in the jade pool,
while first refining its lead mother.
The lead mother seizes the **mercury child** (汞子),
then one may enjoy the **state**’s longevity.

This is called the cultivation of *deep-rooted and firm*,
the **Dao/Way** of *eternal life and lasting vision*.
**Deep-rooted and firm** (根蒂): returning to the root to subdue the **qi** (气),
nurturing the stem to preserve the spirit (神).

**Chapter 60**

「To govern a great state, one must treat it as delicately as cooking a small fish.
To rule the world with the **Dao/Way** (道), its demons shall not be fearsome.
Not that the demons are not fearsome—
their spirit shall not harm the people.
Not that their spirit harms no one—
the sage also harms none.
When both do not harm each other,
**virtue/power** (德) returns and merges.

**Chapter 61**
---
【The great state is like the *lower reaches* (下流), the confluence of the world,
the receptive of the world.
The receptive ever conquers the active through stillness,
and stillness is the *lower reaches*.
Thus the great state yields to the small state and takes the small state;
the small state yields to the great state and takes the great state.
So sometimes one yields to take,
sometimes one yields and is taken.
The great state, with its great excess (大过),
seeks to nourish and sustain all under its rule.
The small state, with its small excess (小过),
seeks to enter and serve others.
When both attain their desires,
the greater should thus take the *lower reaches*.

---
This chapter instructs the lords of the world to practice yielding to embrace the smaller states.
The *lower reaches* (下流) is where all waters gather—
comparing the great state’s dominion over lesser states,
hence the saying: *"The great state is like the lower reaches,"*
not that it resides in the lower reaches.

It unites vassals and tributaries,
so it is called the *confluence of the world*.
It should employ soft **virtue/power** (德),
hence likened to the receptive of the world.

The receptive (牝) is soft **Dao/Way** (道);
the active (牡) is rigid **Dao/Way**.
Though the small state is rigid,
the great state conquers it through soft stillness—
thus stillness is the **virtue/power** of yielding and humility.

When the great state yields to the small state,
the small state rejoices to become its loyal subject,
and its annual provisions may be gathered.
When the small state yields to the great state,
the great state may have intentions of reward,
and its yearly offerings may be invited.

Thus sometimes one yields to take,
sometimes one takes while yielding.
The great and small mutually depend on each other.

The great state’s excess (大过) is likened to the *Easy* (易) **Dao/Way**.
The *Ze-Feng* (泽风) hexagram benefits in ventures,
so its imagery compares it to water drowning wood—
water rising high, and all its wood submerged,
a symbol of great excess.
The sweet dew descending from Kunlun (昆仑)
originally benefits ventures as *Hen* (亨),
aligning perfectly with the great excess—
spirit transforms into **qi** (气), and **qi** into essence (精),
filling the *Dan Tian* (丹田).

Thus it has the **virtue/power** of seeking to nourish and sustain all.

The small state’s excess (小过) is also likened to the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.
The *Lei-Shan* (雷山) hexagram benefits in steadfastness,
so its imagery compares it to a bird’s lingering cry—
a bird should descend to be heard,
a symbol of small excess.
The true essence (真液) descending from the *Dan Tian*
originally benefits steadfastness as *Ji* (吉),
matching perfectly with the small excess—
essence generates **qi**, and **qi** generates spirit,
soaring to depend on the *Huang Ting* (黄庭).

Thus it has the **Dao/Way** of seeking to enter and serve others.

---
The great state, Kunlun (昆仑),
its essence flows downward into the *Yuan Hai* (元海).
The essence further transforms into **qi**,
and enters the *Dan Tian* (丹田).
When the great state yields to the small state,
its essence flows downward from Kunlun to the *Dan Tian* to generate **qi**—
thus the one who takes the *Dan Tian*’s **qi** is the yielding to take.

Or when the *Dan Tian*’s **qi** ascends back to Kunlun to generate essence,
the one who swallows Kunlun’s essence is the taking while yielding.

The great state’s excess (大过) is indeed drawn from the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.
Its essence, like Kunlun’s sweet nectar,
descends to the *Huang Ting* (黄庭),
where the **qi** of the *Dan Tian* is gathered and reversed—
this is the yielding to take.

The small state’s excess (小过) is also drawn from the *Easy* **Dao/Way**.
Its essence, like the *Dan Tian*’s true nectar,
ascends back to Kunlun,
where Kunlun’s essence is merged and falls into the *Huang Ting*—
this is the taking while yielding.

The great state’s excess (大过) is likened to the *Ze-Feng* (泽风) hexagram,
where water submerges wood—
the great state’s essence, overflowing like the waters,
seeks to sustain all under its rule.

The small state’s excess (小过) is likened to the *Lei-Shan* (雷山) hexagram,
where a bird’s lingering cry signifies descent—
the small state’s essence, descending like the bird,
seeks to enter and serve the great state.

When both great and small attain their desires,
it is all because of the great state’s yielding to the small.»

「Rising and descending, one after the other,
mutually supporting, mutually preserving,
reversing the Heaven and Earth,
countering the flow of the Yellow River.

The subtlest method of cultivating the self
is none other than this.

*Commentary*:
Thus, some lines read: "The Yellow Court lies below, gathering Kunlun’s essence," then it is the **taking while descending**.
Again, some read: "The Yellow Court reflects below, collecting the *Dan Tian*’s **qi**," then it is the **taking while descending**.

This meaning may also be observed in context.

*Master Wu’s Appraisal*:
The Yellow Court is the domain for nurturing the heart,
the **female gate** (牝户) is the source for nourishing the kidneys.

Now, calling the nurturing of the heart the **female gate**,
it is because the **Dao/Way** values stillness—
preserving the spirit and safeguarding the essence.

Concentrating the spirit and gathering the **qi**,
the **Dao/Way** values gentleness.

Emptiness of the spirit to receive the **qi**,
the **Dao/Way** values humility.

Guarding the spirit and awaiting the **qi**,
the **Dao/Way** values frailty.

Using the spirit to interact with the **qi**,
the **Dao/Way** values submission.

Harmonizing the spirit and **qi**,
the **Dao/Way** values accord.

The **female Dao** (牝道) possesses the six **virtues/powers** (德) of stillness, gentleness, humility, frailty, submission, and accord,
thus borrowing the name **female gate** to metaphorically replace the Yellow Court—
not shifting the gate’s location to the Yellow Court’s realm.

Families of *Dan Tian* cultivation often reverse the symbols of hexagrams and lines,
frequently lending names to one another.

To speak plainly, the **Returning Dao** (回道) further elucidates this:
Each phrase holds a true secret,
sweeping away a thousand metaphors.

Hold it as treasure—
do not reveal it to the unworthy.

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
(*River Above Master’s Commentary* treats this as the **Dao/Way** chapter; *Peng’s* version as **Dao/Way’s profound secrets**)

The **Dao/Way** is the profound mystery of all things.
A treasure for the virtuous,
a safeguard for the unvirtuous.
Fine words can be sold,
noble deeds can be bestowed upon others.
What can be discarded from the unvirtuous?
Thus, the establishment of the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes,
even with a jade tablet to precede the four horses,
is not as beneficial as sitting and mastering this **Dao/Way**.

Why did the ancients hold this **Dao/Way** in such esteem?
Was it not because:
one who seeks it shall obtain it,
and one who holds it shall be absolved of guilt?

Thus, it is held as precious throughout the world.

The **Dao/Way** is the profound mystery of all things—
the origin of creation and transformation.

The virtuous treasure it highly,
using it to cultivate the elixir and attain sainthood.
The unvirtuous also preserve it,
for it can replenish their **qi** and prolong their years.
This is the **Dao/Way’s** utmost fairness.

To speak of this **Dao/Way**,
one can attract followers as readily as selling goods.
To practice this **Dao/Way** with honor,
one can elevate others by a rank.
This is the **Dao/Way’s** never-failing reward.

Those in the world who forsake this **Dao/Way** and rush blindly—
they themselves are unvirtuous;
the **Dao/Way** has never abandoned anyone.
Thus, even with the Son of Heaven and the Three Dukes as noble persons,
and the jade tablet and four horses as noble things,
when compared to this **Dao/Way**,
sitting and mastering it remains the most precious.
*Sitting*: guarding. (See *Zuo Zhuan*: "The Chu people sat at their northern gate" for this usage.)
Also, *sitting*: kneeling. (See *Qu Li*: "When sitting, one must shift" for this usage.)

Why did the ancients hold this **Dao/Way** in such esteem?
Because seeking it brings attainment,
and attaining it absolves one from guilt.
Thus, nothing in the world is as precious as this.

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
(*River Above Master’s Commentary* treats this as the **En/beginning** chapter; *Peng’s* version as the **Great** chapter)

To act without acting,
to manage without managing,
to savor the insipid.
Great and small, many and few—
repay resentment with **virtue/power**,
planning the difficult in its ease,
achieving the great through the minute.
The world’s difficult tasks
must begin with what is easy.
The world’s great undertakings
must begin with what is small.
Thus, the sage never seeks to do what is great,
and so can accomplish the great.

Light promises bring few fulfillments,
many trivialities bring many hardships.
Therefore, the sage treats even the difficult as difficult,
and so ultimately faces no difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**
To act without acting is to act in tranquility,
to manage without managing is to manage in stillness,
to savor the insipid is to savor in simplicity—
all pointing to serene detachment.

Great and small, many and few—
to measure things and apply them evenly.
To repay resentment with **virtue/power** means
to respond in kind, repaying **virtue/power** with **virtue/power**,
not adding excess.

To plan the difficult in its ease means
that where others find things light,
I alone regard them as difficult—
not that difficulty follows ease,
but that I treat what is easy as difficult.

To achieve the great through the minute means
not to belittle small actions,
lest they accumulate into great **virtue/power**.
This aligns with the text’s words:
Thus, the world’s difficult tasks
must begin with what is easy.
The world’s great undertakings
must begin with what is small.
This should now be clear.

To begin with what is easy
is to guard against recklessness in trivial matters.
To begin with what is small
is to value small actions from the start.

The sage never seeks to do what is great,
and so can accomplish the great.
This further clarifies
that great undertakings must begin with the small.

As for beginning with what is easy,
another argument is made to explain it:
One who makes light promises
will surely lack trustworthiness.
Thus, those who speak much of trivialities
will inevitably face many hardships.
Therefore, even what is not difficult,
the sage treats as difficult,
and so ultimately faces no difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
What is stable is easy to uphold;
what has not yet manifested is easy to plan.
What is fragile is easy to shatter;
what is subtle is easy to disperse.
Act before things exist,
govern before chaos arises.

A tree thick as a man’s embrace
begins as a sprout.
A nine-tiered tower
rises from a pile of soil.
A thousand-li journey
begins with a single step.

Those who act invite ruin;
those who grasp lose hold.
The sage acts without acting,
and so knows no ruin.
Holds without grasping,
and so knows no loss.

The common folk, in their undertakings,
often ruin what is nearly complete.
To be as cautious at the end as at the beginning
is to know no failure.

Thus, the sage desires without desiring—
desires the Dao but does not covet rare treasures.
Learns without learning—
learns method but remains effortlessly natural—
turning back the errors of the masses,
aiding the spontaneous order of all things,
and daring not to act.

As the first fifty-seven chapters state:
*"I act without acting, and the people transform themselves.
I love stillness, and the people align themselves.
I act without acting, and the people grow rich.
I desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity."*
This is the same principle.

The ancient masters of the Dao did not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to keep them simple.

The people are difficult to govern
because their cleverness is too great.
To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state;
to govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing.

To know these two principles
is to grasp the standard.
To grasp the standard
is called *Mystic Virtue*.

Mystic Virtue is profound, vast,
contrary to the ways of things,
and reaches the Great Harmony.

The Dao does not value knowledge and discernment,
for they diminish its primal unity;
it values ignorance and oblivion,
to preserve its nameless essence.

Thus, the master of the Dao does not seek to enlighten the people,
but rather to keep them simple.

*"The people are difficult to govern because their cleverness is too great."*
This is what was said before:
*"When wisdom arises, great deceit follows."*

*"To govern with cleverness is the ruin of the state."*
This is what was said before:
*"When governance is meticulous, the people grow weary."*

*"To govern without cleverness is the state’s blessing."*
This is what was said before:
*"Abandon the sage, discard wisdom—the people’s gain is a hundredfold."*

Wisdom and lack of wisdom—
these two determine the state’s prosperity or ruin,
and serve as the model for governance.

If one knows this,
then one may be called *Mystic Virtue*.

*Mystic Virtue*—
its depths are vast, its light far-reaching,
its simplicity not simple,
contrary to the blind striving of all things.

*Great Harmony*—
the Great Transformation.

Thus, *Mystic Virtue* alone may attain the Great Transformation.

The rivers and seas are able to be the sovereign of all valleys because they excel in yielding to them—thus they become the sovereign of all valleys.

Therefore, the Sage, wishing to be above others, must speak in humility.
Wishing to lead others, must place himself behind them.

Thus, the Sage, though in high station, is not held in awe,
though in the forefront, does not cause harm.

Therefore, the world willingly follows and never tires,
for he does not contend—
thus none under heaven can contend with him.

The rivers and seas excel in yielding,
and all currents flow to them,
hence they are called the sovereign of all valleys—
to illustrate the Sage.

To be above the people yet speak in humility—
this is what was said before:
*"The lofty relies on the low as its foundation."*

To lead others yet place oneself behind—
this is what was said before:
*"Retreat one’s self, yet one’s self is foremost."*

Thus, the Sage’s virtue is pure and harmonious,
in high station without the terror of coercive might,
and the people do not feign reverence.
In the forefront without the aggression of overbearing *qi*,
and the people do not guard against harm.

Therefore, the world willingly acclaims the Sage,
delighting without surfeit.
None can contend with him—
for the Sage, like the rivers and seas, excels in yielding,
and all currents cannot divide his influence.

**Chapter Sixty-Seventh**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on the Three Treasures"; Peng’s text agrees.)*

The world all says I am great—
yet it seems I am not so.
For only the truly great
appear to be not great.
If one seems great,
long has it been small!

I have three treasures, hold them close.
First is **compassion (慈)**, second is **frugality (俭)**,
third is not daring to act before all under heaven.
**Compassion** makes one courageous,
**frugality** makes one capacious,
not daring to act before all under heaven
makes one a vessel of lasting worth.

Now, if one abandons **compassion** for courage,
one must have a heart of endurance.
If one abandons **frugality** for capaciousness,
one must have a heart of greed.
If one abandons humility for precedence,
one must have a heart of contention.
All these are paths to death.

**Compassion** in battle brings victory,
in defense brings security.
When Heaven intends to save one,
it does so through **compassion** as a shield.
**Compassion** is the great Dao indeed!

---
**Chapter Sixty-Eighth**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Aligning with Heaven"; Peng’s text agrees.)*
The adept at being a **scholar-official (士)** does not rely on force.
The adept at war does not rage in anger.
The adept at overcoming the enemy does not vie in contention.
The adept at using others places himself beneath them.
This is called the virtue of **non-contention (不争之德)**,
this is called the strength of using others,
this is called the ancient extreme of aligning with Heaven.

---
**Chapter Sixty-Ninth**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Mysterious Application"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on Lightly Treating the Enemy")*
In wielding arms, there is a saying:
*"I dare not be the host, but only the guest;
I dare not advance an inch, yet retreat a foot."*

This is called moving without movement,
repelling without strength,
engaging without resistance,
seizing without arms.
No calamity is greater than lightly treating the enemy—
lightly treating the enemy nearly forfeits my treasures.
Thus, when forces clash and are matched,
the **merciful (哀)** will prevail.

---
**Chapter Seventieth**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Knowing Difficulty"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on Knowing Self")*
To wield arms, one must say:
*"I do not dare to be the host, but only the guest;
I do not dare to advance an inch, yet retreat a foot."*

This is called moving without movement,
repelling without strength,
engaging without resistance,
seizing without arms.
When forces clash and are matched,
the **merciful (哀)** will prevail.

**"Chapter Seventy-first**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Knowing [the] Dao/Way"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on Knowing Self")*
‘My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.
Yet none under heaven can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have their root (宗),
affairs have their master (君).
Only because of ignorance
do they fail to recognize me.
Few know me—
thus I am precious.
Hence the Sage wears coarse cloth
while cherishing jade within.’

The teachings of the **Taoist Sage (太上)** are all **Dao/Way (道)**.
Yet **Dao/Way** is not external to the human body—
thus it is said to be easy to know,
easy to practice.
But in the end, none under heaven can know or practice it—
as in the *Zhongyong*’s saying:
‘I know why **Dao/Way** does not prevail.’

The wise err above it,
the foolish fall short.
I know why **Dao/Way** is not illuminated—
the worthy err above it,
the unworthy fall short.
Thus, even the enemy cannot know or practice it.
Yet its words serve as the **foundation (祖)** for cultivation and refinement,
and its deeds as the **principle (纲)** for transcending life and death—
hence it is said: ‘Words have their root,
affairs have their master.’

This is the true meaning of the **Taoist Sage’s (太上)** Classic.
Only because humans do not know this **Dao/Way**
do they fail to recognize the **Taoist Sage (太上)**.
The **Taoist Sage (太上)** says:
‘Few know me—
thus I am precious.
Like the Sage who wears coarse cloth
while cherishing jade within.’
*Coarse cloth (褐): the attire of the humble.*
Humble garments worn on the outside,
precious jade held within—
thus knowing fewness yet valuing preciousness
is without loss.
This is called ‘hiding in the world without being seen,
knowing without regret’—
only the Sage can achieve it.”

---

**Chapter Seventy-second**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Loving Self"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on Revering Might")*
‘If the people do not fear **might (威)**,
then **might** has truly arrived.
Do not constrain their dwelling,
do not exhaust their livelihood.
Only because of not exhausting
are they not exhausted.
Hence the Sage knows himself
yet does not display himself,
loves himself
yet does not exalt himself.
Thus, he discards that
and takes this.’

---

**Chapter Seventy-Third**

**"Might" is filled with the *qi* of stern and lethal severity—
when the people do not fear **might (威)**,
the heavens will amplify its stern and lethal severity.
Yet the heavens inherently favor life and abhor killing—
it is all the work of human hands.
Thus, one must not constrict their dwelling,
nor exhaust their livelihood.
*Páng* (狭): narrow.
*Jū* (居): the abode of the spirit.
*Yàn* (厌): to cut off.
*Shēng* (生): the movement of *qi*.
Speaking of widening their abode to settle the spirit,
and sustaining the movement to draw forth the *qi*.
Only by not cutting off their *qi*
does one nourish the *qi* without interruption.
The Sage knows himself yet does not display himself,
loves himself yet does not exalt himself.
To know oneself is to dwell in seclusion with solemn caution,
and not dare to flaunt before others.
To love oneself is to prioritize preservation and nurturing,
and not dare to boast before others.
Thus, he discards the heart of self-display and self-exaltation,
and takes the heart of self-knowledge and self-love.
All things are merely matters of attending to one’s own person.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Third**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Trusting Nature"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on the Heavenly Net")*
**"Courage in daring brings death,
courage in not daring brings life.
These two—
one brings benefit, one brings harm.
What the heavens detest—
who can fathom its reason?
Thus, even the Sage finds it difficult.
The Way of the heavens:
without striving yet conquering well,
without speaking yet responding well,
without summoning yet coming of its own accord,
spread out yet planning well.
The heavenly net is vast and wide,
spread thin yet never letting slip.**

「Courage is indeed decisive.
To kill: to extinguish all deluded thoughts.
To live: to restore the original spirit.
The desire to kill deluded thoughts lies in resolute action, hence one must dare.
But the restoration of the original spirit lies in gradual cultivation, hence one must not dare.
The killing and the living—
within harm lies benefit, for extinguishing the deluded thoughts is the means to nourish the spirit;
within benefit lies harm, for nourishing the spirit first requires extinguishing the deluded thoughts.
Thus it is said: *"either benefit or harm,"*
speaking of how their advantages and disadvantages mutually rely upon each other.
Within this lies the Dao of the heavens.
The heavens have preferences and aversions,
silently bestowing punishment or virtue—
the world struggles to comprehend its ways.

It speaks only of what the heavens abhor,
for the love of life is their inherent nature,
while the killing intent alone is beyond measure.
Thus, even the Sage hesitates to speak lightly of the heavenly Dao.

How is the Dao of the heavens?
It does not dispute with the common people over principles,
yet through self-cultivation and reliance on virtue,
it conquers all.
It does not speak of goodness to those prone to licentiousness,
yet calamity and blessing reach their heads—
all respond accordingly.
It does not summon, yet comes of its own accord;
spread out yet plans well.
It exhaustively describes the rewards and retributions of swiftness, slowness, beauty, and ugliness,
applying them to people without fail—
not the slightest error.

The heavenly net is vast and boundless,
thin yet never letting slip—
how great and intimate its embrace!
Those who cultivate themselves
should steadfastly uphold their virtue to align with the heavens.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Fourth**
*(He Shang Gong’s annotation: "Chapter on Restraining the Depraved"; Peng’s annotation: "Chapter on the Heavenly Executioner")*
**"If the people do not fear death,
how can you threaten them with death?
If you make the people always fear death,
then among them, only the deviant will dare to act.
I shall seize and kill him—who dares?
There is always one who executes the killing.
He who substitutes for the executioner to kill—
this is called substituting for the master carpenter to wield the axe.
He who substitutes for the master carpenter to wield the axe—
rarely fails to injure his own hands."**

If the people do not fear death,
they will not dread the killing sword—
why then must you further threaten them with death?
If you make the people’s hearts always harbor a fear of death,
then among the masses, only the cunning and perverse will dare to act—
I shall seize and kill him—
who dares cling to habitual ways while fearing no retribution?

Once, Confucius spoke to Duke Kang of Lu:
*"When you govern, why use killing?
If you seek goodness, the people will be good."*
Yet when he returned to Lu,
he alone executed the one named Minor Master Mao,
to awe the multitude of deviants—
this was his intent.

Only thus can one be called the **Heavenly Executioner**.
The Heavenly Executioner: one who executes the killing.
The heavens have their executioners,
who kill the perverse and evil,
so that no one else may wield the killing power.
If the strong substitute for the executioner and take on killing,
it is like the master carpenter’s axe
being wielded by one unskilled in its use.
If one skilled in the axe substitutes for the master carpenter,
rarely does he fail to harm his own hands.

Then it is known:
if one unskilled in killing substitutes for the executioner,
rarely does he fail to harm his own heart of virtue.
Why use killing at all?
Better to serve goodness and win over people.

*(My annotation: Killing—*
comparing it to those with a deliberate intent to kill;
not killing—
comparing it to those with no intent to kill.
If one can rectify his spirit,
all evil will naturally dare not to offend—
this is the secret of effortless benevolent killing.)*

The people’s hunger arises because their rulers consume too much in taxes—thus, they hunger.
The people’s difficulty in being governed comes because their rulers act with excessive contrivance—thus, they are difficult to govern.
The people’s indifference to death comes because they cling too heavily to life—thus, they treat death lightly.

Only those who do not cling to life are wiser than those who value it.
When rulers consume too much in taxes, famines among the people will rise.
When rulers act with excessive contrivance, the people’s unruliness becomes evident.
The people’s indifference to death stems from their greed for wealth and profit,
seeking to enrich their lives, thus disregarding their own well-being.
As the saying goes: *"People die for wealth"*—this is the case.

Only those who do not place great weight on wealth and profit
will have a clear mind and few desires—
these are the ones wiser than those who value life.

*(My annotation: Taxes deplete the people’s sustenance,
comparing it to overworking the body until it withers.
Excessive contrivance disturbs the people’s spirit,
comparing it to overstraining the mind until it falters.)*

**Chapter Seventy-Sixth**
*(He Shang Gong’s note: "Chapter on Restraint and Overexertion"; Peng’s note: "Chapter on Governing the Rulers")*

The birth of man is frail and weak,
yet his death is rigid and unyielding.
All things, grasses, and trees in their birth are tender and brittle,
but in their death, they wither and decay.
Thus, rigidity and strength belong to death,
while frailty and weakness belong to life.
Hence, strong armies cannot prevail,
and rigid trees will snap.
The strong and mighty are placed below,
while the weak and yielding are placed above.

---

The frail and weak are nourished by **qi**; the rigid and strong,
when **qi** gathers and the body harmonizes, bring life;
when **qi** scatters and the bones stand stark, bring death.
The life and death of all things are also of this nature:
tenderness and brittleness mean **qi** is abundant—thus, life;
withering and decay mean **qi** is exhausted—thus, death.
Rigidity and strength relate to death,
while frailty and weakness relate to life.
How can one not discern the obvious in form and substance?

Further illustrations:
Strong armies cannot prevail—my **qi** first falters,
while the enemy’s **qi** remains flourishing.
Rigid trees will bow at their joints—
hard **qi** does not reach their tips,
and their greatness stops at the curved branches.
Thus, the distinction between high and low
also lies in rigidity and strength versus frailty and weakness.

Those who cultivate their person—
should they not take humility and harmony as their highest aim?

**Chapter Seventy-Seventh**
*(He Shang Gong’s note: "Chapter on the Dao of Heaven"; Peng’s note: same)*
The Dao of Heaven—is it not like a drawn bow?
The high are lowered, the low are raised.
The overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven diminishes the overabundant and supplements the insufficient.
But the Dao of man is otherwise—
it diminishes the insufficient to serve the overabundant.
Who could possess the overabundant to serve all under Heaven?
Only the one who embodies the Dao.

Thus, the sage acts but does not claim credit,
achieves success but does not dwell upon it—
is this not because he does not wish to be seen as virtuous?

The **Tàishàng** speaks in terms of the readily apparent.

**Chapter Seventy-Eighth**
*(He Shang Gong’s note: "Chapter on Trusting in Softness"; Peng’s note: "Chapter on Softness and Weakness")*

The Dao of Heaven—like a drawn bow, its essence is simply balance and equilibrium.
The high are lowered, the low are raised, so the two arms are level.
The overabundant are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented, so the body stands upright.
The Dao of Heaven harmonizes the seven **zhèng** (political offices) and orders the five **xíng** (types of conduct), achieving its wondrous regulation through balance and equilibrium.
Hence, it is also said: *"The Dao of Heaven diminishes the overabundant and supplements the insufficient."*

But the Dao of man is otherwise—
it diminishes the insufficient to serve the overabundant,
thus making the insufficient even more so,
and the overabundant even more so.
Who could use their own overabundance to serve the insufficient of all under Heaven?
Only those who embody the Dao of Heaven and establish the Way,
wishing all things to attain their proper place—
these may be seen as the sages.

They act but do not take credit,
achieve success but do not dwell upon it,
diminish the overabundant to serve all under Heaven,
yet do not claim the virtue as their own—
is this not because they do not reveal their own virtue?

The vulgar annotation in verse says:
*"The Dao of Heaven diminishes excess and accepts humility to bring benefit,
while human nature consumes and depletes, worsening misfortune evermore.*
If one can grasp the meaning of the scripture,
the sand elixir and the gold elixir will unite with the sacred lineage of the Dao.

The **Tàishàng** speaks in terms of the readily apparent.

The opening three lines echo what was previously stated: *"The utmost gentleness under Heaven, galloping through the utmost firmness under Heaven."* Without anything to replace it, meaning no other substance can surpass this in overcoming firmness. Though all under Heaven know the principle that *gentleness overcomes strength and softness overcomes hardness*, none can put it into practice.

Therefore, the **Tàishàng** further cites the words of the sages to illustrate the profound virtue of gentleness: *"To bear the filth of the state is called the guardian of the ancestral altars. To bear the misfortunes of the state is called the ruler of all under Heaven."* His words are upright yet seem contrary, for the sages take upon themselves the blame, saying: *"I truly bear much guilt—what crime has the people committed? My virtue is thin and shallow; Heaven has sent this calamity upon me."* Their upright words appear reversed because they seek blame within themselves rather than pointing it outward at others. This is indeed the Dao of gentleness.

**Chapter Seventy-Ninth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled "Tasking Trust" [任契], Peng’s text the same*)
*"When great grudges are reconciled, there will still be lingering grudges.
How can this be considered good?
Thus, the sages hold the left contract but do not blame the people.
Those with virtue manage the contract, those without manage the fulfillment.
The Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good."*

If the realm has many grudges, the ruler’s virtue must be shallow. If one meets the people’s grudges yet still does not blame oneself, but instead wishes to reconcile the great grudges, then even if some grudges are reconciled, there will still be those that remain unreconciled, and lingering grudges cannot be easily dispelled. How can this be called complete goodness?

Confucius said: *"If one is generous to oneself yet sparing in blaming others, one will be far from grudges."* Therefore, the sages govern the world by cultivating the virtue of self-generosity, gaining the people’s trust, and not blaming them—so the people naturally come to trust them. It is like sealing a covenant, dividing the contract into halves, each party holding their own, forever relying upon it. Then neither deceives the other, nor does one suspect the other.

If the sages uphold virtue as if holding the left contract, who among the people would not be delighted? Thus, those with virtue manage the contract, and those without manage the fulfillment.

Fulfillment (*彻*): means to examine faults. Those who obsessively examine faults, never reflecting upon themselves, will not be followed by the people. The Dao of Heaven has no favorites, always favoring those who are good. As the *Book of Documents* says: *"The august Heaven has no favorites; reverence earns its favor. The people have no constant hearts; hearts turn toward those with kindness."*

**Chapter Eightieth** (*River Master’s commentary originally titled "Standing Alone" [独立], Peng’s text titled "Small States"*)
*"Small states, few people.
Let them possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet not use them.
Let them value death so much that they do not move far.
Though they have boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them.
Though they have armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.
Let them return to knotting cords for record-keeping.
Let them find their food sweet, their clothing fine, their dwellings secure, their customs joyful.
Neighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard,
Yet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another."*

There are those who wish to make their states great and their populations numerous, possessing the implements of ten billion or a hundred million households yet not using them—then their use will only grow more extravagant. The **Tàishàng** does not follow this path. Instead, he uses the small to illustrate the great, showing that the small can encompass the great.

In a small state with few people, if they possess the implements of ten or a hundred households yet do not use them, their use will only become more abundant. What difficulty is there in returning to simplicity and purity? Therefore, he lets the people not use their implements, cherishing only their lives. They dwell in their native land, do not migrate to other regions. They value death yet do not die, nurturing life to prolong it—what else is there to seek?

At this time, the people within the state move with ease and vigor, so there is no need for boats or carriages. Within the state’s borders, thieves and bandits are nonexistent, so there is no need for armor or weapons. The governance of the state is pure and substantial, so the custom of knotting cords can be revived. The food is sweet, the clothing fine, the dwellings secure, and the customs joyful. Neighboring states are in sight, the sounds of chickens and dogs are heard, yet the people live to old age and die without visiting one another—then their interactions are simple and unburdened by extravagance, their provisions abundant yet each remains content in their own home.

The high-minded of the state say:
*"A single hill and valley suffice—we deem it better than the world beyond.
A single spring and autumn pass in ease, as if forgotten within a pot.*
Grandfathers and grandmothers live in lasting health,
Husbands and wives grow old together in harmony.
Brothers and sisters play on the *xūn* and *zhé*,
Children and grandchildren harmonize the *luán* and *hè*.
What difference is there from the blessed lands of the immortals, the realm of Ultimate Bliss?"*

**Chapter Eighty-First**
*"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy.
The good do not argue; those who argue are not good.
The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise.
The sages do not accumulate.
When they act for others, their own virtue grows greater;
When they give to others, their own abundance increases.
The Dao of Heaven benefits without harming.
The Dao of the sages acts without striving."*

Trust, goodness, and wisdom—all pertain to upright speech, summarizing the entire *Sutra*’s meaning. Sincere and substantial discourse is true alone, not adorned with empty flourishes to please the world. Those who seek to please the world rely on empty flourishes, not sincerity—hence it is said: *"Trustworthy words are not beautiful; beautiful words are not trustworthy."*

Continuing the fine tradition, it is uprightness alone, not engaging in sophistry to confuse others. Those who confuse others rely on sophistry, not on upholding tradition—hence it is said: *"The good do not argue; those who argue are not good."*

Discourse that penetrates to its depths is one principle alone, not indulging in superficiality to display talent. Those who display talent indulge in superficiality, not depth—hence it is said: *"The wise are not learned; the learned are not wise."*

And yet, it follows with establishing virtue and deeds, fulfilling the grand purpose of this *Sutra*. Accumulation means accumulating goodness. The sages do not speak of accumulating goodness; they only establish their own great virtue and great deeds. Their virtue and deeds are boundless and universal, so when they act for others, their own virtue and deeds only grow greater.

The more one gives virtue and merit to others, the more one’s own virtue and merit abound.

The Dao thrives through silent operation, hence it brings benefit but inflicts no harm. The sages’ Dao rests in effortless transformation, their hearts devoid of striving; they do not vie with others in amassing good deeds or reputation, so their greatness aligns with Heaven’s. The ancients said: *"The highest excellence lies in establishing virtue, the next in establishing deeds, the next in establishing words. All three are imperishable."* This may be applied to what is spoken here.

After completing his annotation of this *Sutra*, the Master of Emptiness’ conduct and speech harmonized with its teachings, as if he had studied it repeatedly. He claimed that without uttering a single word, he could reveal the true essence of the Way.

The concluding chapter, which speaks of virtue and merit as its final annotation, he also deemed most beautiful and good.

Then, he pondered how the phrase *"Act without contention"* could serve as the root for all eighty-one chapters. Suddenly, he realized: *"Yes, yes! This single sentence alone suffices as the sovereign grain of the entire *Sutra*."*

What practitioners fear is hearing the Dao yet still engaging in petty strife for minor merit, minor virtue, trifling literary fame, or chasing after fleeting wealth and honors—thus exhausting their precious, useful lives in vain pursuits.

The sages’ Dao mirrors the Way of Heaven; Heaven’s Dao governs spontaneous transformation, naturally bringing benefit while inflicting no harm. The sages’ Dao encompasses effortless transformation—is it not also benefit without harm?

I wish those who achieve their aims and fulfill their names, who exhaust filial piety and perfect loyalty, would all take refuge in the True and all attain the Dao. First, they refine themselves with jade-like purity, dwelling in great seclusion among the marketplace. Next, they forge their merit with gold-like precision, dwelling deeply in ravines and valleys. Internally, they exhaust their own efforts; externally, they sever all striving and contention.

For only by not contending does one ensure that none in the world can contend with them—such is the perfected sage.

The sacred scriptures’ grand conclusion is consummate indeed.

**The True Transmission of Laozi**
Laozi was a man of Chu.
His father, **Ganyuan Gao**, served as the **Shang** (or **Zhou**) court’s **Grand Historian**.
He wed **Hongshi**, whose given name was **Yingfu**.
One day, while napping, he beheld five-colored cloud radiance enveloping **Taiyi LaoJun**, who descended from the heavens, then suddenly transformed into a shooting star and flew into his mouth.
Thereafter, he conceived a **jewel embryo**, and twelve years later gave birth in **Kuh County’s** **Lai Village**, **Qu Ren Lane**, beneath a **plum tree**.
Taking the plum as his surname, he was called **Laozi** because he was born from the **LaoJun** vision, **Zhong’er** for his long ears, and **Baiyang Fu** by his title.
This occurred on the **fifteenth day of the third month, Year One of Shang King Wu Ding**.

(*As recorded in the **Scriptures of the Transcendent** and **Records of the Path**. The **Inner Transmission** states: “Surname Li, given name Er. His mother saw the **sun’s essence** descend like a shooting star, entering her mouth, and thus conceived. Carrying him for seventy-two years, she gave birth beside the **Huo River** in **Chen State**, beneath a plum tree. Pointing to the plum, she declared, ‘This shall be my lineage.’ Born with white hair, he was thus called **Laozi**. With three ear leaks, he was also called **Lao Dan**.” The **Five Schools’ Web of Fate** says: “Surname Li, given name **Zai**, born on the **fourteenth day of the ninth month, Dingwei Year** of **King Ding**.” The **Expanded Lunar Ordinances** recount: “The **Jade Maiden**, Laozi’s mother, dreamed of five-colored cloud radiance coalescing into a pearl, which flew into her mouth. Swallowing it, she conceived. After eighty-one years, she gave birth beneath a **sacred grove tree**, emerging from her left armpit. This too occurred on the fifteenth day of the third month, Year One of Wu Ding.”*)

「The *Suoyou Qianliang Lu* records: *“In the year **Qianyuan** of the **Dingwei** cycle, **Li Zai** conceived for seventy-two years without a husband. He was born from a union with his neighbor, **Yishou**.”*

The *Xuyang Zalu* recounts: *“Laozi’s mother, the **Yuanjun** (Primordial Lady), was impregnated when **day-precision** (solar essence) entered her mouth, which she swallowed. Thus, she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth.”*

Liu Xie’s *Xin Lun* states: *“Laozi was conceived through the influence of the **Fire Star** (Mars).”*

The *Lushi* (Chronicles of History) says: *“A **flowing star** (meteor) struck him, and after twelve years, he was born. From birth, he could speak, with a **yellow face** and **radiant white hair**, hence the name **Laozi**. He was from **Lai Village** in **Kuxian** (Bitter County), where *Lai* is a variant of *Le*, thus he was also called **Lao Lezi** (Old Le).”*

The *Gaoshi Zhuan* (Biographies of the High Worthies) notes: *“Laozi was born during the **Shang Dynasty** (Yin era).”*

The *Shenxian Zhuan* (Biographies of Immortals) states: *“Laozi, also named **Zhong’er** (Middle Son), was conceived when his mother was struck by a **great flowing star** (meteor). Some say she carried him for seventy-two years before giving birth. Others claim his mother had no husband, and **Li** was her family name. Still others say his mother, while passing beneath a **plum tree**, conceived and gave birth. From birth, he could speak, pointing to the plum tree and declaring, ‘This shall be my surname.’”*

The *Lieshen Zhuan* (Biographies of the Immortals) recounts: *“Laozi entered his mother’s womb riding a **white deer**.”*

The *Tang Ji* (Tang Records) says: *“Laozi’s mother ate a **plum** and conceived. Her parents abandoned her, and after eighty years, she gave birth beneath a **plum tree**. The **Tang Emperor Gaozu** traced his lineage to Laozi, hence the term **Xian Li Pan Gen** (Ineffable Plum Root).”*

The *Zalu* (Miscellaneous Notes) notes: *“**Xuanyao Yufu** (Mysterious and Marvelous Jade Maiden), descended from **heavenly yellow-black qi** (vital essence), entered her mouth and conceived. After three thousand seven hundred years, she was born in the **Western Thatagata Kingdom**—this is the tale of **Daode Tianzun** (The Celestial Venerable of Virtue and Way), not Laozi.”»

Of **innate purity and filial piety**, he relied on the **common folk’s transformation** (cultivation).

「In his lifetime, he was serene and simple, devoid of desire—externally rejecting wealth and honor, internally nurturing his **jing** and **qi** (vital essence and vital energy). During the transition between the Shang and Zhou dynasties, he endured for over a hundred years without decline, and was then known as the **Ancient Hidden Sage** (古隐君子). The *Shiji* (Records of the Grand Historian) states: *“He lived to over a hundred and sixty years, or some say over two hundred. Zhi Chuan (稚川) says: ‘Laozi lived in the Zhou for over three hundred years.’”* The *Lushi* (Chronicles of the Path) records: *“His mother lived to four hundred and forty years, or some say two hundred and twenty.”* The *Guangji* (Comprehensive Records) says: *“Two hundred and seventy years.”* The *Shantang Sikao* (Hall of Mountains' Four Examinations) notes: *“He was born in the reign of Shang Emperor Wu Ding, and lived until the ninth year of Qin Emperor Shihuang, spanning nine hundred and ninety-six years.”* Calculating from Wu Ding’s first year to Shihuang’s ninth year, his actual lifespan was one thousand and eighty-seven years. Laozi often changed his name during the Zhou era.

In the time of King Wen (文王), he was known as **Xieyi Zi** (燮邑子, also written as **Zhiyou Shixian** 支邑先生), serving as the **Keeper of the Archives** (守藏史). In the time of King Wu (武王), he was called **Yucheng Zi** (育成子), serving as the **Chief Historian** (柱下史). During King Kang’s reign (康王), he was known as **Guochu Zi** (郭叔子), and in King Xian’s time (顷王), he was called **Lao Lezi** (老莱子). His wife was also virtuous and wise, and together they retired in farming and sericulture (耕桑). He wrote fifteen treatises, expounding the **practical applications of Daoism** (道家之用). When King Zhuang of Chu (楚庄王) heard of them, he sought his counsel. At the time, Lao Lezi was weaving, and the king approached and asked: *“I wish to govern my kingdom well—would you, Master, assist me?”* Lao Lezi replied: *“Agreed.”* The king then left.」

His wife returned from gathering firewood and asked, *“Did you agree to his request?”* He replied, *“Indeed.”* His wife said, *“I have heard: ‘Those whom you may feed with wine and meat, you may also strike with rods and clubs. Those whom you may grant office and emolument, you may also execute with axes and cleavers.’ I cannot be made a tool of others.”* She cast aside her basket and departed. Lao Lezi, delighted, immediately fled with his wife.

Sima Qian records: *“Laozi’s son was named Zong, who served as a general in Wei and was ennobled at Duan. Zong’s son was Wang. Wang’s son was Yan. Yan’s great-great-grandson was Xia, who served in the Han. Xia’s son Jie became tutor to the King of Jiaoxi, residing in Qi.”* At the time, the generations of ancestors and descendants must have wandered without fixed abode, their lineages branching and diverging. Some say: In Yue, he was Fan Li; in Qi, he was Yuyi; in Wu, he was Tao Zhu Gong; in the early Han, he was Huangshi Gong; during Emperor Wen’s reign, he was He Shang Gong—these are all matters beyond verification.

Ge Zichuan remarked: *“Laozi emerged in every age, often changing his name. The reason for this is that, according to the *Nine Palaces*, the *Three-Five Canon*, and the *Elemental Period Canon*, each person encounters critical junctures in life. When such times arrive, one must change one’s name to align with the shifts in primordial *qi*, thereby transcending calamity and prolonging life. Even in the present age, many Daoists do the same. Laozi remained in Zhou for over a hundred years, passing through multiple such junctures, hence his many names. To establish Laozi’s true origins, we must rely primarily on historical records and his own secret scriptures, cross-referencing them. Other folk accounts are largely baseless.”*

Moreover, the *Western Ascension: Middle Embryo*, *The Return of the Mandate: The Wrapped*, *Pearl Stratagem and Jade Mechanism*, and the *Golden Canon: Inner Classic* all describe Laozi as having white-yellow skin, beautiful brows and broad forehead, long ears and large eyes, sparse teeth and square mouth, thick lips, and a forehead marked with three to five enlightened lines. His horns resembled the sun’s rays, his eyebrows hung like the moon, his nose was straight with twin pillars, his ears had three apertures, his feet stepped upon the numbers two and five, and his hands grasped ten symbols. He stood nine *chi* tall, with teeth numbering sixty-four—these were the outward signs of a sage.

Those who receive the Mandate of Heaven inherently possess divine insight and foresight, differing from common mortals. They are the masters of the Dao, thus able to be aided by celestial beings and followed by immortals. Hence, the teachings he transmitted to save the world amounted to nine hundred thirty volumes, along with seventy volumes of talismans—all recorded in the central chapters of his original scriptures. The catalogues remain, and their authenticity can be verified. Those texts not included in this count were later additions by Daoist practitioners, not genuine works (as noted by Zichuan).

Laozi cultivated effortlessly, refining himself through stillness (as recorded in the *Shiji*). He devoted himself entirely to longevity, yet though he remained in Zhou for centuries, his rank and status never advanced. He sought to blend his light with the mundane, his essence remaining naturally true. Only when his Dao was complete did he depart—he was indeed an immortal (*Shenxian Zhuan*).

When Confucius traveled to Zhou, he intended to inquire about ritual from Laozi. Laozi said, *“What you speak of—both the person and their bones—have long since decayed, yet their words endure. Moreover, a noble seeks to ride the times; if the times do not favor them, they travel lightly like a tumbleweed. I have heard: ‘A wise merchant conceals their wealth as if empty; a virtuous person’s excellence appears as folly.’ Abandon your arrogance and greed, your vain demeanor and licentious desires—for these bring no benefit to your life.”*

Later, he asked Confucius, *“Have you attained the Dao?”*

Confucius said, *“I have sought it for twenty-seven years and have not yet attained it.”*

Laozi replied, *“If the Dao could be presented to others, then all would offer it to their lords. If the Dao could be advanced upon others, then all would advance it to their kin. If the Dao could be told to others, then all would tell it to their brothers. If the Dao could be transmitted to others, then all would transmit it to their children. Yet it cannot be so—there is no inner master to dwell within the Dao.”*

When Confucius spoke to Laozi of *ren* and *yi*, Laozi said, *“Scatter chaff in the eyes, and the four directions shift. A gnat’s sting on the skin, and one cannot sleep the whole night. Now *ren* and *yi* are harsh and violent—they agitate my heart and mind, and no chaos is greater. My wish is that the world not lose its natural simplicity, that it move with the wind and stand firm in virtue, returning naturally to its origin. Why must you strive so ostentatiously, as if carrying a great drum to seek a lost child? The wild goose does not bathe daily to become white; the crow does not blacken itself daily to become black. Black and white in their simplicity are insufficient to distinguish beauty and ugliness. Unpraised observation is insufficient to expand one’s true nature. Fish left in a dried-up spring cling together on land, moistening each other with breath, nourishing each other with spittle—yet it is not as good as forgetting each other in the vast rivers and lakes.”*

Confucius then said to Laozi, *“I have studied the *Odes*, the *Book of Documents*, the *Rites*, the *Music*, the *Symbols of the Yi*, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals*, and with these I have served seventy-two lords.”*

「Discussing the *Dao* of the ancient kings, yet clarifying the traces of the Zhou and Chou rulers, one sovereign finds no practical use for it—how profound! How difficult it is to speak of humans, and how difficult it is to elucidate the *Dao*!」

Laozi replied, *“The Six Classics are but the relics of the ancient kings—how could they be the means by which the *Dao* was practiced? What you speak of now are all mere traces. For traces are what the foot leaves behind, yet traces are not the feet themselves.”*

Confucius returned, and for three days did not speak. Zigong wondered and asked him, *“Master, why is this so?”* Confucius said, *“I know that birds can fly, fish can swim, and beasts can run. Those that run can be caught in nets, those that swim can be reeled with lines, and those that fly can be snared with arrows. But as for the dragon, I do not know how it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to the ninth heaven. Now, seeing Laozi—is he not like the dragon?”*

Laozi dwelled in Zhou for a long time, but seeing the decline of Zhou’s *virtue/power*, he ascended a green ox-cart and departed westward through the Qin Pass, ascending to Kunlun. The Pass Overseer Yin Xi observed a purple vapor and, foreknowing his arrival, swept the road for forty *li* to welcome him. When Laozi indeed arrived, Yin Xi said, *“Master, you are about to depart in seclusion—please, for me, write down your teachings.”* So he halted his cart in the pass and composed *The Dao and Virtue* in over five thousand words, imparting all to Yin Xi before departing.

During the Eastern Han era, there was a descendant of the Wang family in Qingzhou, named Cheng, with the courtesy name Xuanfu, and the *Dao* name Donghua. He encountered the Kunlun Western Mother, Wang Qitian Zhu. Zhu, delighted by their shared surname, bestowed upon him the title Baiyun Shangzhen and gave him Laozi’s green talisman of jade seals and the golden sacred scriptures. Xuanfu devoted himself to these teachings for three years, diligently practicing without ceasing. Moved by his sincerity, Laozi descended and condensed *The Inner Landscape of the Yellow Court* into one volume, naming it *The Outer Landscape*, which he entrusted to Xuanfu for cultivation, also revealing the fire preparation methods for the nine-refinement, eight-essence elixir. Xuanfu then concealed his light and obscured his traces, building a hermitage to quietly refine his practice. When his efforts were complete, he was titled *Donghua Emperor*, overseeing the *qi* of the Eastern Minor Yang.

He was also called *Zifu Minor Yang*, the Great Emperor of Fushang, and the Lord of the Ministerial Assistants. Through three successive transmissions, he reached Chunyang Master, who declared: *“Laozi’s* Outer Landscape *and Yuzhen’s* Inner Landscape *are both stored in the Fushang Palace. Donghua’s ancestor praised and passed them down, recording Laozi’s intention to guide the world. The* Dao *of the Old Lord before and Laozi after—are they one or two? They are harmonious yet distinct.”*

In ancient times, Laozi’s previous incarnation was the embodiment of the *Dao* of the Supreme Old Lord (Laojun). Thus, his transformations between concealment and revelation mirrored those of the Old Lord. The Old Lord in the Upper Antiquity manifested as the Three Pure Ones. During the reign of Tianhuang, he was named the Heavenly Teacher of Ten Thousand Laws; during Dihuang, the Mysterious Middle Teacher of the Law; during Renhuang, the Firm Master. After the Three Sovereigns, he became the Golden Threshold Emperor. In the time of Fu Xi, he was called Yuxiazi (later changed to Yumi). In the time of Shennong, he was the Nine-Spirited Laozi. During the reign of Emperor Ku, he was Lutuzzi. In the time of Yao, he was Wuchengzi. In the time of Shun, he was Yinshouzi. In the time of Xia Yu, he was Zhenxingzi. In the time of Shang Tang, he was Xizezi. It was only during the reign of Shang’s Wuding that he descended fully as Laozi. This was another epoch of cosmic transformation, a new beginning for heaven and earth.

Later scholars, unaware of this, conflated Laozi with Laojun, thus attributing the previous incarnation’s deeds to his later life. Some claimed Laozi was born before heaven and earth, while others asserted he was the essence of heaven. Such assertions leave even the most meticulous scholars in disbelief, beyond the *Laojun’s Authentic Scripture*. *The Master Who Embrace Simplicity* states: *“If one possesses the* Dao *of heaven, then one has the arts of the* Dao*. The practitioners of the* Dao *have existed since the time of Xī and Huāng, through to the Three Dynasties. Why must it always be one Laozi?”* This arises from later disciples who favor the strange and unusual, seeking to elevate Laozi’s status. In truth, Laozi was simply an extraordinary master of the *Dao*, not a supernatural figure.

If one claims Laozi attained the *Dao*, then people must strive to emulate him. If one claims he was a supernatural being, then longevity becomes unattainable through learning. In my humble view, Laojun before was supernatural, while Laozi later shared the same path as others. The supernatural cannot be learned, but the path shared by all can be. The core intent of Laozi’s teachings is simply this: to rely on truth.

The Confucian scholars say that the birth of sages is due to human *qi* receiving heavenly essence—this is the most plausible explanation. Laozi’s birth borrowed the Four Great Elements to form his shape; through rigorous cultivation, he achieved grand deeds, becoming the model for immortals and the exemplar of *Dao* and *virtue*. When his merits were fulfilled and his practice complete, he returned to oversee all the heavens. Divided into myriad forms, yet unified as one. He descended as a mortal, but both his divine and human aspects centered on cultivating the *Dao*—what cannot be learned lies here, and what can be learned also lies here.

As for Zhuangzi and Fang Shuo, their claims that Laozi merely changed his name are untrustworthy; these were indeed Laozi’s own bestowals. The *Treasure of Praise* states:
*“Descendants like those of the Lacquer Garden and Fang Shuo—
they meticulously dissect the faintest radiance.
It is as if the mother of Dan Yang
dreamed of receiving divine seals from an immortal,
thus giving birth to the great sage’s talent.”*

The *Dao* transmissions say:
*“Those who follow Laozi’s teachings
are pure and tranquil, without contention with the world,
thus they can embrace simplicity while harboring preciousness,
never facing adversity in a perilous age.”*

His origins are profound, his influence vast—
how could he not be the eternal exemplar set by heaven and earth?

Residing on Qing Island for several years,
he often instructed the late disciples Zhuzi, Jiezi, and Huifeng Sizi
with his method of purity and stillness,
ever vigilant and fearful,
never daring to forget his ancestral teachings.

Before there was Laojun,
and after there was Laozi—
one in essence, two in form,
harmonious yet clearly distinct.»

His writings are of such refined quality,
like the flowing waters of today and the moon’s past essence.

*(The Master of Wu Mountain)* interweaves narration and commentary,
both as history and as solemn discourse.

The collected biographies of various schools
all display his skill in selecting the finest and savoring the brightest.

This is the **precious transmission** of Laozi’s first chapter. *(Preserved by the Baohua sect)*
