**The Heart-Method of Internal Alchemy for the Golden Elixir**
*By Master Chongxu*

**On Life and Death**

Life and death are matters of great weight, for where there is life, there must be death—thus, there is also learning. The Three Sages, in truth, endure as long as heaven and earth, while those who chase after fleeting things are not worth mentioning. Some, merely echoing others’ voices, say: “Life is the constant of death, and death is the constant of life—why trouble the heart with study?” Yet they fail to recognize that the constancy of life and death is no different from never having lived, no different from never having died.

Why is this so? “Qi gathers to give life, and qi scatters to bring death”—this is the discourse of our Confucians. Yet when humans gather qi to live, from the age of fifteen onward, they daily deplete and chip away at it until death. This is the scattering of qi, not qi scattering of itself. Thus, it is said: among the people of the world, none do not die, none die well, and thus none live well.

Alas! How does heaven give life to humanity? Yet people themselves do not live well, do not die well—they are not truly human. To be not human is to be as plants and trees, as birds and beasts. Plants and trees are duller than humans. When birds and beasts die, the nobler ones transform through the qi (feathered transformation), the lesser ones through fire (cremation)—they ride upon the qi. When plants and trees die, they wither and flourish, flourish and wither, alternating in creation and transformation—they steal from the qi.

Humans, endowed with the finest essence and greatest intelligence, scatter the qi that gathers within them. They cannot ride the qi’s presence to attain what the absent lack, nor steal from the qi’s absence to attain what the present possess. Are they not then inferior to birds, beasts, plants, and trees?

The Three Sages did not cling to life, nor did they flee from death—they simply lived as life and died as death. Thus, to say the Three Sages endure is beyond me; to say they perish, I dare not. Yet what the Three Sages called “enduring in endurance and perishing in perishing”—how can one go a single day without studying this?

Confucius initiated the enterprise of the Uncrowned King, establishing a teaching for engaging the world. Yet when he spoke of human nature and destiny, his words were subtle. The Buddha, emerging as the Brahma King, spoke of nature but not of destiny—his words were profound. Today’s *Five Classics* are Confucius’ great canon, just as today’s *Great Treasury* is the Buddha’s *Five Classics*. The *Five Classics* begin with the *Book of Changes*, which states: “Exhaust principle and fulfill nature to reach destiny.” Its ultimate discourse speaks of the great person harmonizing virtue with heaven and earth, brightness with the sun and moon, order with the four seasons, and fortune and misfortune with ghosts and spirits—this is the mechanism of nature and destiny. Yet at that time, none of Confucius’ disciples, not even Yan Hui, could fathom its depths. Only Zisi, his grandson, later revealed that “what heaven imparts is called nature” in the opening chapter of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, praising it thus: “Above, it accords with the laws of heaven; below, it follows the patterns of earth—like the alternating movement of the four seasons, the alternating brightness of the sun and moon.” This was Confucius’ family treasure, disclosed at last. Yet his disciples believed he rarely spoke of destiny, that “human nature and the Way of heaven could not be heard.” If even in his time they could not grasp its subtleties, how much less could later generations, for myriad ages, stray from its teachings through misguided interpretations?

The *Great Treasury* comprises 5,048 fascicles, all taking nature as their foundation. Confucius rarely spoke of nature, while the Buddha spoke of it profoundly. Yet within this profundity lies an even deeper layer, found only in the various mantras. The Buddha expounds the mantras, and the Buddha alone recites their meaning. Even bodhisattvas and below cannot comprehend them. Thus, those who recite the *Cundī Dhāraṇī* merely say: “I follow the esoteric teachings”—they do not grasp its meaning. The esoteric is the teaching of mantras, not the essence of the teaching itself. To seek the intent behind the teaching through its methods—is this not the destiny within nature?

Without being the World-Honored One, how can one discuss the master’s truth? Thus, the Buddha’s followers all say: “See nature and become a buddha,” while the study of destiny has been lost.

The teachings of Laozi differ from these. From the *Classic of the Secret Correspondence* and the *Dao De Jing* onward, he speaks at length of destiny, at length of nature, and always links nature to destiny, destiny to nature. I have often assessed this: Confucius’ words on nature and destiny speak of the shadow, not the form. The Buddha’s words on nature and destiny take nature as the form and destiny as the shadow. Laozi’s words on nature and destiny speak of the shadow *and* the form.

After Laozi, however, many divergent paths emerged. I dare not seek among these many paths but trace their source directly, following my own inclination. In leisure, I embrace the alchemical texts and read them, finding that their teachings center on obtaining the One. The One is the Elixir, the Elixir is the primordial *qian*-gold. Yet this *qian*-gold is hidden within the later heaven’s *kan*-water. Extracting the one from *kan* to supplement the two of *li*—this is called cultivating nature, cultivating destiny, and harmonizing the dual cultivation of nature and destiny. Fearing that people would not know how to cultivate, methods were established: the techniques of laying the foundation and refining the self, of drawing lead and adding mercury, of shifting the furnace and changing the cauldron. In sum, these are what is meant by “using spirit to guide qi,” “refining essence to merge with qi, refining qi to merge with spirit, refining spirit to merge with emptiness.” Yet when cultivation reaches its limit, one directly returns to the truth of life and death, without deviating from the correct path.

The study of emptiness and nothingness transforms emptiness into spirit, spirit into qi, qi into essence—one resolution settles all, so why engage in cultivation? Yet the highest and sharpest tools are rarely encountered in the world. Only by retaining essence with qi, retaining qi with spirit, can one ensure that spirit abides. When spirit abides, there is life; when it does not, there is death. Abiding or not abiding lies with me, not with heaven. Life and death return to heaven, untouched by human interference.

Every person possesses it, and every person may practice it—not like the teachings of Confucius or the Buddha, which speak of some things and leave others unspoken. Reciting Master Jingyang’s *Repentance Record*, I came to understand why the eight hundred years were destined to be fulfilled. Though the eight hundred years have their own master, dispelling ignorance and lifting delusion must begin with the words of sages and worthies. Yet their words sprawl and resist easy reading. When I had exhausted all the classics of the various schools, I found no entry. Reading their commentaries, I saw that beyond the classics, the books of the schools often diverged, lacking unity. Moreover, each commentary clung to partial learning to adorn its own shallowness, obscuring rather than clarifying the intent of the sages and worthies. How could the eight hundred years not have suffered the same hardships as I?

Such rare and difficult matters are never easily accomplished. To ride the crane in transcendence, one must rely on the aid of a waist purse. The inferior scholar hears this and laughs heartily—this is why the highest sages remain silent. A hair’s breadth of error leads to a thousand miles of deviation. If the celestial mechanism is lightly revealed, the ancestors’ sin extends to the failure of the Dao’s transmission, while one’s own offense becomes grave. I would speak, then hesitate; I would cease, yet cannot. Rather than conceal its mysteries in the subtle and profound, is it not better to lay out its essentials?

Thus, following my teacher’s guidance, I have composed this alchemical text to exhaust the subtleties of elixir-making and to systematically detail the nurturing of the elixir. It awakens the supreme single thrust and perfects the true enlightenment of the original source. In movement, it is playful; in stillness, it enters nirvana. It creates the image of boundless freedom and eternally returns to the original root. Drawing lessons from the past and guiding the return to the origin, I have compiled this direct discourse to thread together beginning and end, distinguish truth from falsehood, and invite the reader to examine it closely. I dare not presume to set a standard for the accomplished but merely leave this for scholars to verify.

*Written by Chongxuzi in the mid-summer of the renxu year*
*Bai Yuchan’s* **Water Tune Prelude**

Before meeting a true teacher’s guidance,
day and night, I suffered in anxious dread.
Yet upon meeting one, receiving some oral instructions,
I forgot all else in careless abandon.
Alas, the years slipped by in vain.
Not heeding essence’s decline or qi’s exhaustion,
I frittered away my life in mediocrity.
Why not turn back and look—
gather the ingredients and begin the firing?

People of the world,
those who know cannot practice.
Pitifully buried in oblivion,
how can they remain so insensate?
They only speak of it with their lips,
while their hearts hold not a trace,
endlessly poring over alchemical classics.
The gates of hell stand open—
hurry, discern your path ahead.

**Chapter One: On the Prior and Posterior Heavens**

Of spirit and essence, only the prior heaven is to be used; the posterior heaven is to be avoided. The prior heaven is the original spirit and original essence—things endowed with spiritual powers and transformations. The posterior heaven consists of the spirit of thought and the essence of intercourse, things devoid of spiritual powers and transformations. As for qi, however, it cannot be without the dual use of prior and posterior heaven, for this is the foundation of transcending kalpas and attaining longevity.

Qi is said to be twofold: prior-heaven qi and posterior-heaven qi, distinct in substance yet dual in function. The prior heaven is original qi; the posterior heaven is the qi of breathing. It is also called mother qi and child qi—the foundation for transcending kalpas. Yet the vessel of qi cannot transcend on its own; it must employ breathing to fulfill its potential. Thus, it is said: without the posterior heaven, the prior heaven has no means to gather, refine, and become the foundation; without the prior heaven, the posterior heaven has no way to verify the achievement of earthly immortality or the power to turn spirit and enter samadhi. Only by employing both qi together does one establish the foundation for transcending kalpas and attaining longevity.

The cultivator of truth gathers the initial qi of the prior heaven as the ancestor of the golden elixir. Without gathering it, one will surely wither and perish by day’s end. Each breath returns to the root—the mother of the golden elixir. For those who have not leaked, gather it to settle the spirit and enter samadhi. For the body of the unblemished youth, use the method of youthful cultivation. For those who have leaked, gather it to replenish, as in the beginning of life, completing this prior-heaven state—this is the posterior heaven serving the celestial timing.

The cultivator must not allow the prior heaven to transform into the posterior heaven; one must contend for the prior-heaven essence and return it to the initial qi, which is to return to the root of nature and restore it to the stem of life. The initial qi is the state of utter emptiness and profound stillness. Thus, through the breathing of the posterior heaven, the true mechanism arrives. At the juncture between prior and posterior—what is called the end of *hai* and the beginning of *zi*—one uses the breathing of the posterior heaven to seek the breathing of the true person. The prior heaven must be reversed, and the breathing of the posterior heaven must also be reversed. Without reversal, how does it differ from the aimless breathing of ordinary people?

The cultivator of truth gathers the essence of daily use, merging it into one qi to replenish and complete the prior heaven. When the mechanism of inhalation stands at closure, I reverse it to ascend to *qian* (the Mud Pill Palace), advancing upward. This is the mechanism of gathering. I reverse it to descend to *kun* (the Yellow Chamber), retreating downward. Ascending to *qian* is the mechanism of gathering; descending to *kun* is the mechanism of refining. Yet the present refining becomes the prior mechanism for future gathering. This is the secret method orally transmitted from patriarch to patriarch.

The cultivator need only thoroughly understand the opening and closing to return the golden liquid to the elixir. Without clarity in opening and closing, one cannot gather the true qi. The great medicine will not form, and all efforts will be in vain. Most crucial is grasping the mechanism of true movement and true stillness; otherwise, one cannot gather. Before reaching the state of utter emptiness, profound stillness, and non-awareness, it is not true stillness. From the state of non-awareness, in the midst of vagueness, arises wondrous awareness—this is true movement. Before reaching non-awareness, amid deluded thoughts, any fleeting perception is not true movement.

When movement is not true, there is no true qi. Those who do not understand the sequence cannot form the elixir. The sequence refers to knowing the true moment when the medicine arises, then gathering, refining, sealing, advancing the Yang fire, retreating the Yin tally, completing the celestial cycle, and applying the remaining images for nourishment. The work of gathering depends on the mechanism of ascent and descent; only by mastering this principle can one gather true qi. Otherwise, true qi cannot be obtained. Even if fire tallies are employed, it is merely boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire—how then can one speak of subduing qi?

Yuan Tiangang’s *Tai Xi Jue* states: "The primordial qi is the root of the great Dao, the mother of Heaven and Earth. Through the interplay of Yin and Yang, it gives birth to the myriad things. In humans, it is the qi of breath; in Heaven, it is the qi of cold and heat. That which can alter the qi of the four seasons is Wu and Ji. In spring, it resides in Xun, generating the myriad things; in summer, in Kun, nurturing them; in autumn, in Qian, ripening them; and in winter, in Gen, containing and fostering them. Thus, the practitioner should gather the proper qi of the four seasons and absorb it into the womb—this is the true seed. With long accumulation, the heart becomes settled, the breath settled, and the spirit settled. The dragon and tiger unite, forming the sacred embryo, which is called the true person’s fetal breathing."

**Chapter Two: On Medicinal Substances**
Chongxuzi said: "The great Dao of heavenly immortality is likened to the golden elixir; the golden elixir’s root is likened to medicinal substances." But with what are medicinal substances compared? Those who refine external elixirs extract true lead from black lead and refine it into cinnabar to form the golden elixir. Internally, they take the true qi from kidney water, which is akin to gold, and refine it into the inner elixir, also called the golden elixir. Externally, white gold serves as the medicine, with cinnabar as the primary agent; internally, the true qi akin to gold serves as the medicine, with the original nature and primordial spirit as the primary agent.

The *Taishang* says: "Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is something." This vagueness refers to the original nature and primordial spirit, which are not attached to thought, awareness, or perception, yet reside in the wondrous realm of awareness—within this, there must be something. That "something" is the single point of true Yin essence within our bodies, known as the "primordial ancestral qi." If it is called ancestral qi, it must reside within as the root of vital qi. Yet why is it also called the "external medicine"? As the ancients said: "The inner medicine of the golden elixir comes from without." Though the ancestral qi is concealed in the elixir field from the moment of birth, there are times when it manifests externally. Sight, hearing, speech, movement, and lust all arise from the transformation of this qi. When thoughts turn outward toward forms, sounds, scents, tastes, touches, and dharmas, it is this qi that carries the mind to them. The cultivator gathers this externally manifested qi and returns it inward. Though it arises from within, it comes from without—hence it is called the external medicine. Once refined into the returned elixir, it becomes the inner medicine, also called the great medicine. In truth, it is this single qi, and when the great medicine arises at this moment—

True Yang said: "The great medicine does not arise spontaneously; it must be gathered before it manifests. It is not like the initial stirring of subtle Yang, which arises on its own." It does not attach to externals but moves only in the locus of its arising. Because it does not depart from within, it is called the inner medicine. Since there is a distinction between inner and outer, the methods of gathering them also differ. The external medicine arises before it is gathered, while the inner medicine is gathered before it arises. From the successive generations of sagely masters, this has been transmitted as the "seven-day oral transmission of the celestial mechanism" for gathering the great medicine.

Ziyang the Perfected said: "Without stabilization, Yang does not arise; after Yang arises, without stabilization, the elixir does not form." This is precisely what is meant. Though the transformations of the initial barrier lie in the inversion of qi, the master of this inversion is the spirit—this is the meaning of "when the spirit returns to the body, the qi naturally follows." If thoughts stir and the spirit scatters, drawing this qi into the realm of desire, then this primordial spirit and primordial qi transform into postnatal, formed essence, which is of no benefit to the Dao of the elixir. Only by taking the precelestial, thought-free primordial spirit as the master, turning inward to illuminate, and concentrating the spirit into the qi cavity, will the precelestial true medicine naturally return from the realm of emptiness to the root of qi within the crucible, becoming the foundation of elixir refinement. As the ancients said: "That which comes from without"—this is the discourse on the external medicine.

Once this medicine is in the crucible, it is refined with the fire of the minor celestial cycle. Yu Yan said: "If one knows the medicine but does not know the secret of the fire phases to refine it, one can only warm the lower elixir field—this is not the returned elixir." This is called refining the external elixir, corresponding to the *Xin Yin Jing*’s saying: "Returning the wind to merge with the primordial, a hundred days’ work bears efficacy."

Only when the external elixir’s fire is sufficient and the medicine is complete does it become the true qi of utmost Yang spirit. When this qi does not transform into Yin essence, it is the true qi of pure Yang—only then can it be called "fullness within Kan." The oral transmission of the celestial mechanism for gathering the great medicine, as passed down by the Perfected of Returned Yang, pertains precisely to this use. When the great medicine is gathered and arises, this is indeed called obtaining the inner medicine. Gathering this qi to ingest and refine the primordial spirit—

Ziyang the Perfected called it "drawing from Kan to fill Li"; the Old Ancestor of Zhengyang called it "extracting lead to replenish mercury"—both refer to obtaining this inner medicine. To refine this qi and transform the spirit, one must unite this qi with the spirit for refinement. As the ancients said: "Refine qi to transform spirit"—this is it. Yet people today do not know how to refine and transform spirit and qi. The qi that is inherently ours is consumed by defilement, and the spirit is confused by lust, so both become deficient, gradually leading to death.

The Perfected in cultivation first employs spirit to assist qi, refining until the qi is abundant and purely yang, thus attainable in quiescence. Thereafter, this quiescent qi assists the spirit—when both spirit and qi are settled, the qi reaches nonbeing and the spirit naturally becomes purely yang. In solitary quiescence and solitary awareness, this is called "qi transforming spirit." Refining to form a purely yang spirit entails the great celestial cycle’s firing process. The immortals call this "conceiving the embryo" and "embryonic breathing," likening it to the state within the womb—from having breath to having no breath. The Buddhist tradition terms this the four dhyanas: as the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states, "The first dhyana abides in mindfulness, the second in cessation of breath, the third in cessation of pulse, the fourth in the extinction of all perceptions." At this stage, fire progresses from having fire to having no fire; medicine progresses from having medicine to having no medicine. From the purely yang qi without leakage, a purely yang spirit is perfected. Without leakage, the singular spirit shines in stillness—thus the Dao of immortality is truly attained. These are the two genuine births of medicine and the two genuine refinements. What is realized serves to distinguish the primacy of medicine.

This is the most essential and secret celestial mechanism of the immortal tradition—how could scholars remain ignorant of discernment? Yet the ancients spoke only of medicinal substances, not of methods of discernment, nor of methods of application, nor of the timing or techniques of gathering. The empty name of the medicine lies beyond the senses, so later generations have no means to recognize the real. The Old Ancestor Shi Jianwu said: "Within qi, years are added by medicine"—the medicine is fundamentally the primordial qi, formless. I trust in this formless utmost reality. In its indistinct and subtle operation, it is gathered and refined within the profound and obscure.

This is the true and authentic Dao of emptiness and nothingness. The heart commands qi and spirit. Fire, originally the tangible form of breath, if employed in its tangible form, only prolongs the deviant fire. If not employed in its tangible form, it seems as though there is no fire. The subtlety lies in the moment when the solitary yang returns: with spirit driving qi, it is returned and restored to the Central Palace—this is the marvel of obtaining being from non-being. Thus it is called "seeming to exist, seeming not to exist." If one knows how to govern the movement of qi but does not understand the marvel of "seeming to exist, seeming not to exist," then the spirit falls into dull emptiness, which is the doctrine of solitary yin.

Now, heaven and earth in generating beings must have the qi of intermingling and steaming. How could the transformation and birth of the myriad things lack a time of joyous nurturing? With each passage through the meridians, there must be a day of intermingling qi. If one reverses the flow to gather it, an elixir is formed. If one follows the flow to extend it, an embryo is formed—this is how one attains the state of the immortal. Once the self-possessed form is achieved, it does not cling to external forms but is generated and employed within. My spirit perceives it as it passes through the Tail Gate, the Three Passes, ascends to the Mud Pill Palace, descends the Double Towers, and enters the Yellow Chamber. When perceived, it can be known and seen—this is what is called the fruit of life and death. From this, one attains true mindfulness.

**Chapter Three: On the Cauldron and Vessel**

The cauldron and vessel, as spoken of by the ancient sages and immortal masters, are the fundamental ground to which the refinement of essence, qi, and spirit return. Thus, spirit and qi are likened to lead and mercury, and the cinnabar field is likened to a cauldron and vessel. All reside within the human body. Foolish people, unaware of the prior refinement within the body, pursue external elixirs and ingested substances, clinging to the notion of the cauldron and vessel. They only believe in smelting lead, mercury, metals, and minerals as external medicines for ingestion, hoping to avoid death. Yet when they lose their human form, these cannot save them—how lamentable!

Master Lü said:
*"Laughable is Zhang Shangshu of the Nine Rivers,
Who, taking medicine, lost his sight and withered his spirit and qi.
Not knowing the returned elixir is originally without substance,
He instead ingested metals and minerals—how utterly foolish!"*

The doctrine of the cauldron and vessel has led many astray. Deceitful individuals and heretical teachings falsely designate women as cauldrons, filth as the medicine to be gathered, taking male impurities and female marital fluids, or even menstrual blood as substances for ingestion. They deceive others and deceive themselves, claiming to replenish the body and extend life.

Thus, Ancestor Zhongli said:
*"If one teaches that strange things can be lightly used,
Even fine wine and lamb’s stew would ascend to heaven."*

The Rustic of Golden Valley said:
*"Lead and mercury are as light as a child’s play, lasting a hundred autumns,
Yet how many comprehend? How many cultivate?
If the dull and foolish all knew the Dao,
Immortals would flow through the world like water."*

All this arises from a failure to awaken to the true meaning of the cauldron and vessel.

Now, the cauldron has metaphors of inner and outer: the outer cauldron refers to the form of the cinnabar field, while the inner cauldron refers to the qi of the cinnabar field. Speaking of form refers to refining form for the purpose of refining essence into qi. As the ancients said: *"Facing the navel wheel, backed by the kidneys, in between lies a true golden cauldron."* Speaking of qi refers to refining qi for the purpose of refining qi into spirit. As the ancients said: *"First take white metal as the cauldron and vessel"*—this is the teaching of Perfected Lord Jingyang. The ancients used black lead as a metaphor for the kidneys, and the true qi emitted from the kidneys was likened to taking white metal, only then can the original spirit reside. Thus it is said: *"First take white metal as the cauldron and vessel, to return the spirit."* Another saying goes: *"Clearly, the inner cauldron is yellow gold."* Whether speaking of white or yellow, both refer to the qi that is returned.

Let us expand further: there is nothing that cannot be likened to the cauldron and vessel. At the beginning, when refining essence into qi at the initial barrier, to return the primordial true qi, only spirit can achieve this. Thus, the original spirit guides qi, converging it toward the lower cinnabar field. The postnatal breath then follows the spirit to restore true qi—this is what is meant by calling the original spirit the inner cauldron. Without this spirit, one cannot gather this qi, and the lower cinnabar field, as the outer cauldron, would have no place to store it. This is the location of the *"true golden cauldron."* Thus, the cinnabar field is the outer cauldron, while the spirit can also serve as the inner cauldron. One must concentrate the spirit into this qi cavity, so that the spirit returns within the body and qi naturally reverts.

When true qi and yang essence arise, they inevitably rush outward. To return them, the spirit must perceive qi’s outward movement, and thus the spirit also rushes outward. To return it, the spirit must drive it, passing through the Supreme Mystery Gate, the Tail Gate, the Spine Pass, ascending to the Mud Pill Palace, descending the Double Towers, and delivering it to the Earth Cauldron. Thus it is said: *"The spirit returns within the body, and qi naturally reverts."* Qi returns to its root by this means.

Later, when nurturing the immortal embryo and subduing the supremely numinous original spirit—this is the middle barrier of refining qi into spirit—only qi can achieve this. Using qi to carry the spirit, the primordial qi stabilizes in the middle field as a barrier. The spirit can then remain settled for a long time, turning the spirit into stillness. As previously stated, qi can be called the inner cauldron. Without this qi, one falls into the doctrine of solitary yin and cannot retain the spirit. The spirit, having no support, would move in and out without timing, and stray thoughts would arise. The middle and lower fields, as the outer cauldron, are the spirit’s proper dwelling. Thus, the spirit becomes still and silently illuminates.

Initially, in refining essence into qi, the spirit serves as the refuge for qi. Later, in refining qi into spirit, qi serves as the refuge for the spirit. Spirit and qi mutually depend on and guard each other, inseparable in the tightest bond—truly as secure as the cauldron and vessel. All these inverted designations are used to elucidate this Dao.

Thus, as Ancestor Lü said: "The true crucible and bellows—only when one truly knows them can one truly employ them. Only when one truly employs them can one verify and attain their truth. How could there be a crucible for the Reverted Elixir? What ought to be profoundly understood must be thoroughly investigated in practice. How could one seek a crucible outside the body, pursuing it elsewhere? This further refers to those who falsely designate clay, metal, or iron vessels—or even women—as crucibles; none of these can be trusted, and trusting them will surely lead to the loss of one’s life and nature. There was once a saying: 'The spirit abides in the sage of qi, and the numinous is attained through nature.' This statement is also correct."

Bai Yuchan said: *"Simply use wu-ji as the elixir furnace, / Refine the red pellet into jade nectar."* For *wu* is the qi within the kidneys, called "metal," and *wu-ji* is the original nature within the body. Since *wu-ji* originally belongs to earth, it is called the "earth cauldron," another name for the crucible. As the Perfected One of Purple Yang said: *"Send it back to the earth cauldron, firmly sealed"*—this is the same idea. The marvel of returning the spirit and gathering qi lies in emptiness and nothingness. Emptiness and nothingness are the mutual resonance of the primordial spirit and qi. The spirit is free from thought, and qi is free from defilement; they must first have a refuge. The spirit depends on qi, qi depends on the spirit, and their mutual illumination depends on the outer crucible of the middle and lower fields—only then can supreme samādhi be achieved. Supreme samādhi is the highest vehicle, the great samādhi of utmost emptiness and nothingness. As the ancients said: *"When mind and breath depend on each other, supreme samādhi is gradually perfected."* The discourse on the crucible must not be neglected.

The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* states: *"The World-Honored One sat beneath the Bodhi tree, then ascended to the summit of Mount Sumeru, to the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, to the Tuṣita Heaven to expound the Dharma—yet he never departed from his original seat beneath the Bodhi tree."* The *Mahāsaṃnipāta Sūtra* says: *"When the Buddha attained perfect enlightenment, he manifested between the realms of desire and form, creating a jeweled pavilion as vast as a great-thousand-world universe, with buddha-lands in the ten directions, to reveal the profound Buddha-dharma for all bodhisattvas and ensure the Dharma’s enduring presence."* The *Huayan Jing Helun* states: *"Know that the Buddha-dharma is none other than worldly dharma, and worldly dharma is none other than the Buddha-dharma. Do not discriminate worldly matters within worldly conditions."* It further says: *"All worldly dharma is purely Buddha-dharma. When has there ever been a Buddha-dharma separate from worldly dharma?"*

Yingchanzi’s *Bai Zi Ling* says:

“Great Elixir of Golden Cinnabar is not hard to know—
The marvel lies in seizing the moment when yang first stirs.
In daily life, guard solitude with care,
Lest dragon and tiger bolt away.
Keep the heart at ease, the body firmly settled,
The mind ever present and watchful.
Unflagging from start to finish,
You will naturally penetrate the Mysterious Female.

Should the least error creep in,
I shall point straight to the ground for you to hear the thunder’s roar.
Erecting the crucible and setting the furnace is no trifling matter—
The Dipper’s revolving pivot alone governs the turning.
Nature is originally round and bright,
Life’s foundation firm and secure.
Once you see through the ‘nothing’ to find the ‘something,’
Old Toad will take form,
And your years will match heaven and earth.”

Chapter Four: On Fire-Timing
Chongxuzi says: “Celestial immortals cultivate the primordial spirit of life; immortality is realized through the unity of nature and life. Thus the first barrier is the cultivation of life, the middle barrier the cultivation of nature. Without the Golden Elixir, one cannot return to true nature. And to verify the Golden Elixir is to recognize true yang essence and qi. Without fire-timing, one cannot gather, refine, and transmute it into the Elixir.” Hence it is said: “Success depends entirely on fire-timing.”

Formerly, the Perfected One of Empty Hermitage said:
*“Though you grasp the true yang and resolve to practice,
Without fire-timing, your resolve will not succeed.
The firing method of the Microcosmic Orbit must be transmitted by an immortal—
Who among worldly folk truly understands it?”*
The ancients said: *“Were fools all to know the Way,
Immortals would flow through the world like water.”*
Yet I have seen Xue Daoguang say: *“The sages transmit the medicine but not the fire.”*
Therefore I say: *“Who says fire-timing cannot be transmitted?
(If it truly could not be transmitted, why would there be the saying of the ‘Six Hundred Scrolls of Fire Records’?)
It is silently enacted in accord with the moment, entering the profoundest mystery.
Those who see clearly through past ages of sages
Know the breath’s clarity and attain immortality.”*

Have you not seen Chen Xubai say: *“To know the marvel of the fire-timing oral instructions,
Seek it within the true breath.”*
Cao Xiangu’s *“Song of the Great Dao of the Numinous Source”* says:
*“I tell you the truth outright:
The stem of life has always resided in the true breath.”*
This clearly points out that fire-timing is simply the true breath—the breath of the true person, not the breath of mouth and nose.

Chen Zhixu says: *“The oral instructions on fire-timing are most secret and cannot be discussed in a general way; they contain sequential steps and specific procedures.”*
From patriarch to patriarch, the transmitted teachings speak of:
the timing for gathering the medicine,
the timing for sealing and securing,
the timing for initiating the Microcosmic Orbit,
the timing for advancing, retreating, and inverting,
the timing for bathing and nurturing,
the timing for ceasing the fire when it is sufficient,
the timing for gathering the Great Medicine,
the timing for ingesting the Great Medicine,
the timing of the Macrocosmic Orbit,
the timing for the perfection of spirit,
the timing for the spirit’s departure—
how could one not distinguish these clearly?

The Perfected One of Purple Yang says:
*“At first, in the stage of ‘having activity,’ it is hard for others to see;
Only when one reaches ‘non-doing’ do the multitude begin to understand.
But if you merely believe that ‘non-doing’ is the essential firing,
Who will know that ‘having activity’ is the root foundation?”*
“Having activity” refers to the Microcosmic Orbit;
“non-doing” refers to the Macrocosmic Orbit.
Fire-timing operates at the locus of the true person’s breath—
a place where there is originally no breath.
From the absence of breath, one harmonizes spirit and qi.
After long refinement, the Great Medicine is formed—
this necessarily employs “having activity.”
Without this, the Dao is not authentic.
That no one sees it is the celestial mechanism of secret transmission,
practiced in concealment.
The ancient immortals and sages admonished: *“Know it, but do not boast of it to others.”*
The saying “transmit the medicine but not the fire” means precisely that this is not lightly transmitted.

Before this point, all proceeds from non-being into being;
after this point, all returns from being to non-being.
Yet fire-timing and breath are originally inherent in the body.
First, from the external one returns to the internal—
thus the internal becomes “being.”
Therefore, the fire of the Macrocosmic Orbit must reach “non-being.”
Yet “non-being” does not mean arriving at non-being by not using fire;
rather, it is the marvel of fire-timing operating within non-being.
This fire is extremely perilous:
the fire of “having activity” is easy to enact,
while the fire of “non-doing” is difficult to enact.
Inability to achieve “no fire” is perilous;
even the slightest trace of “being” mixed in is perilous;
and if “non-being” is interrupted or not enacted, that too is perilous.
Thus the Perfected One of Purple Yang also cautioned:
*“The world’s fools and vulgar folk,
Upon hearing of ‘non-doing,’ guess it means not using fire.
Some indulge their preferences, carelessly letting the mind wander;
Others guess that ‘non-doing’ means using only ‘non-doing’ from start to finish,
without seeking the proper ‘having activity’ at the beginning.”*
Hence he said: *“If you merely believe in ‘non-doing,’ who will know of ‘having activity’?”*
The Perfected One of Purple Yang directly spoke the purport of *“cultivating both being and non-being.”*

The Elder of Pure Yang says:
*“At the first stirring of yang, the midnight water-clock drips endlessly.”*
(From this point onward, all directly speaks of the fire-timing of the living *zi* hour.)
The Perfected Wei Boyang says:
*“From the darkest night to the dawn of the new moon, the thunder arrives to receive the talisman.”*
This uses the month as a metaphor.
The darkest night symbolizes the time when yin in the body reaches its extreme.
From the darkest night to the dawn of the next month is the first day of the new moon.
*Zhen* (thunder) is the first stirring of yang in the lower line,
symbolizing the arising of true qi in the body.
When the medicine is born, the fire should also be born.
As the *zhen* yang stirs and arrives, one should receive the fire-talisman
to gather, refine, and transmute it.

The preceding passage from Pure Yang uses a day as a metaphor.
Midnight is the hour of *zi*,
and the “endlessly dripping water-clock” refers to the counting of the fire-talisman’s time.
The ancients said: *“Some use a day as a metaphor, some a month, some a year—
there is no metaphor that is not used.”*
They borrow what is easily seen
to elucidate what cannot be spoken of fire-timing.
Yet scholars must not take the metaphors literally;
they are all vague allusions to the principles within the body,
and are not truly similar.

Chen Chaoyuan said: “In all elixir-refining, one must kindle the fire as yang qi arises at the *zi* hour—only then is the fire’s power complete. To kindle at any other time is impossible, for there is no medicine.” No medicine means “boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire.”

Yingchanzi said:
*“Ever rise at midnight’s *zi* hour,
where Heaven’s Dao and human heart begin anew.
To refine nature and cultivate the true, this is the time—
the self-strengthening, ceaseless true noble one.
Toil brings life, ease brings death—
what else is the purpose of facing the wall in scripture and conduct?”*

Chen Niuwan said: *“Within the twelve hours, one must recognize *zi*.”*

In the cyclical workings of the elixir Dao, one must kindle the fire at the true, living *zi* hour. Heaven’s Dao has its twelve hours, and *zi* at midnight is indeed one of them. Yet though the elixir Dao borrows *zi* as a metaphor, one must not rigidly fixate on that *zi*. Within the twelve hours, there may arise a *zi* hour when yang stirs and fire ignites—this is called the “living *zi* hour,” for it is not confined to the dead *zi* of midnight. Those who refine the elixir must, within the celestial hours, recognize the living *zi* hour when fire should be kindled. This is what is meant by “when it should arise, when it should be illuminated”—the Star Lord of one’s original spirit. If one does not recognize the living *zi*, it is called “missing it right before one’s face.”

Bai Yuchan said: *“The moon’s waxing and waning is plain speech—
the timely *zi* and the heart’s transmission are no error.”*

Peng Helin said: *“Fire and medicine originally dwell in one place—
when seen, they seem present; when sought, they vanish.”*

The medicine is originally the primordial *qi* of the prior heavens, inherently formless. I affirm its utmost truth in its very formlessness, and through the wondrous function of this "nothingness," one gathers, refines, and smelts—this is the true immortal Dao of emptiness and nonbeing.

Fire is originally the tangible form of breath, yet if one employs it solely in its tangible form, it only prolongs the deviant fire. Instead of using its tangible form, one employs it as if it were intangible. Fire and medicine dwell together in one place, but it is in the wondrous attainment of "something" from "nothing" that they are said to be "seemingly present, seemingly absent."

My teacher said:
*“Where the first yang stirs, begin the firing—
sealing the crucible at mao and you, all glows the same.”*

The stirring of the first yang aligns with the discourse on pure yang, yet it speaks of gathering and sealing, of bathing and nurturing—where both are forgotten, merging with the Great Void. All this describes the medicine’s arising as the fire’s arising, clarifying the timing for gathering the medicine and kindling the fire.

This is Master Chongxu’s summation of the preceding major section. Gathering the medicine pertains to the events before the *zi* hour’s fire; kindling the fire pertains to the actions of the *zi* hour’s fire. These two must be distinctly understood. Thus, Bodhidharma said: *“In the second watch, gather the pearl; in the fourth, distinguish the divine work.”*

Master Zhengyang said: *“The firing sequence for forming the elixir has its appointed moments.”* (All that follows concerns the kindling of fire at *zi*.) The twelve-hour microcosmic cycle of firing is precisely the time for refining the golden elixir. Hence it is said: *“The elixir forms at its appointed moment.”*

Master Xiao Zixu said:
*“Heaven and Earth’s bellows beat with a set number.”*
The bellows, a tool for fanning the fire, symbolizes the ebb and flow of breath—*qian* exhales while *kun* inhales, *kun* inhales while *qian* exhales. The "set number" refers to *qian* employing nine and *kun* employing six.

*“The knife and jade of *li* and *kan* arrive in due time.”*
*Li* is the spirit within the heart, called "earth of the self." *Kan* is the *qi* within the kidneys, called "earth of the other." The two earths above and below form the character for "jade tablet." When the two earths of *wu* and *ji* unite, they are called the "knife and jade," symbolizing the union of spirit and *qi*. The knife and jade are forged through the fusion of the two earths, yet one must first know the timing for gathering these two earths to form the jade tablet. Without this knowledge, the jade tablet of the two earths cannot be achieved.

The Perfected One of the Jade Crucible said: *“If the crucible lacks the water clock’s measure, the numinous sprout will not grow.”*

Master Zhenyang said: *“Entering the crucible requires the true yang’s essence to return to the *qi* cavern, where the fire of the water clock must refine it for the yellow sprout to arise. The water clock’s measure means that once one hour is complete, the next hour begins. The six yang hours (zi, chou, yin, mao, chen, si) are for ascent; the six yin hours (wu, wei, shen, you, xu, hai) are for descent—only then does it accord with the proper principle. Moreover, one must harmonize spirit and *qi*, both weighing half a catty and eight taels. Like using the water clock’s measure for one hour, there are times for ascent and descent, and times when neither is appropriate—this is the established principle.”*

*The Orthodox Lineage of the Mysterious Learning* states: *“The water clock is the breath’s egress and ingress.”* (This directly states that the water clock is another name for the cycle of exhalation and inhalation.) The water clock divides the day and night into twelve hours, each with its own number of marks, each mark corresponding to the sound of dripping water. More drips accumulate to mark an hour.

The ancients said:
*“The breath’s count in the microcosmic cycle is subtle,
the jade dew’s cold sound matches each drip.”*
Here, this is likened to the breath’s respiration. The water clock’s dripping marks the hours, just as in the elixir path, the true breath’s count aligns with the hours.

Master Guangcheng said: *“Man’s reversal and return is simply breath penetrating to the root. With each inhalation, the heavenly *qi* descends; with each exhalation, the earthly *qi* ascends—this is the union of my true *qi*. Reversal and return signify the rotation of the three fields: upper, middle, and lower. Breath refers to the true person’s respiration (not the breath of mouth and nose). Penetrating to the root means reaching the *qi* cavern. The ascent and descent of breath seem to be described in reverse.”* (The upper field returns to the middle field, the middle field returns to the lower field, the lower field returns to the upper field, and the upper field re-enters the *qi* sea, connecting with the true *qi*. These three processes work in concert—this is the firing sequence of the microcosmic cycle.)

Generally, many alchemical texts describe things in reverse. Upon examining their principles and practices in detail, I find that exhalation descends and inhalation ascends, aligning with nature—only then can the wondrous state of "seemingly present, seemingly absent" be attained.

Master Huanyang of My Teacher said:
*“At *zi*, *mao*, *wu*, and *you*, the true mechanism is set;
inverting yin and yang, three hundred breaths.”*
*Zi*, *mao*, *wu*, and *you* refer to the firing sequence in *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* for shedding the embryo, the great microcosmic cycle. *The Mirror of Fire and Medicine* speaks of “at the end of shedding the embryo, observe the four cardinal points”—these are the four hours. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* discusses the great microcosmic cycle, while this refers to the small microcosmic cycle. Though the great and small matters differ, their application is the same. As *The Heart Sutra of the Mind Seal* says: *“Three grades, one principle.”*

Master Ziyang said: *“Moment by moment, harmonize and refine—
the true *qi* congeals and coalesces.”*
“Moment by moment” means that all 360 breaths must be harmonized and aligned with nature; if even one moment is out of tune, one cannot enter stillness and form the foundation of the embryo.

Bai Yuchan said: *“Fire originates from the *li* trigram of the south.”*
*Li* belongs to the heart, and the heart is spirit. *Qi* is the medicine. When the spirit is not scattered, *qi* returns to the spirit. Refining the medicine with fire to form the elixir is simply using spirit to guide *qi* and attain the Dao.

Chen Xubai said: *“The essential oral instructions for the firing sequence must be sought within the true breath.”* For breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, the breath is harmonized. With each breath returning to the root, the mother of the golden elixir is born.

The *Heart Seal Scripture* speaks of “revolving wind and blending harmony, a hundred days’ work brings efficacy.” This is the principle.

Xue Daoguang said: *“In the firing sequence, withdrawal and addition leave no trace of dust.”* Withdrawal and addition are advance and retreat. “Leaving no trace of dust” means thoughts do not cling to deliberation, illusory dust, or delusive demons. “One hexagram passes, another arises” signifies unbroken continuity.

Chen Niyan said: *“Within the hundred moments, drowsiness must be strictly avoided.”* Whether sinking into sleep or scattering into distraction, one loses the true timing—this must be firmly remembered.

Chen Xiyi said: *“The work of *zi* and *wu* is the firing sequence; seize these two hours without day or night. At *zi*, the hexagram *fu* of returning yang arises; at *wu*, the hexagram *gou* of arising yin is born. Thirty-six and twenty-four (the *qian* trigram uses nine, four nines make thirty-six; the *kun* trigram uses six, four sixes make twenty-four) mirror the degrees of the celestial cycle. At *mao* and *you*, bathing occurs; when the firing sequence is complete, do not indulge.”*

Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *“When the firing sequence is complete, do not harm the elixir.”* This means one should not recklessly continue firing without knowing when to stop.

The Recluse of Golden Valley said: *“The breath of the celestial cycle counts softly; the cold sound of jade dew drips in accord.”*

The *True Explanation* says: *“The firing sequence is simply lodged in the *qi*; its advance and retreat have no other principle. The subtlety of the firing sequence lies in this: if the intention is too urgent, the fire becomes scorching; if too lax, the fire grows cold. Neither forget nor force. There is no fixed rule. What one must fear most is scattered intention—no ascent, no descent, no great elixir formed.”* This is the clear instruction for beginners. Though one may not yet comprehend the great Dao, these words can guide learners to the gate of entry.

Wang Guoqi said: *“The mouth does not exhale, the nose does not inhale (when mouth and nose do not breathe, one follows the breathing method of the true person). The bellows of heaven and earth gently pause. The *xun* wind and *li* fire simmer in the cauldron, until the body is at peace and life is established.”*

Chen Niyan said: *“In walking, sitting, sleeping, and eating, remain thus—only fear the fire grows cold and the elixir’s power lags.”* “Walking and sitting” refer to sitting while practicing the work, not walking on the road. Even with sleep and food, one has not yet transcended the ordinary; this is merely refining essence into *qi*, the internal work of foundation-laying. In the ten-month gestation of the spirit-embryo, one forgets sleep and food. “Thus” is the subtlety of entering stillness. To “remain thus” is to unite the fire with the mysterious wonder. If the fire does not grow cold, the elixir’s power does not lag.

The Elder of Pure Yang said: *“Arrange the cauldron and furnace to refine the mysterious root; advance and retreat must clarify the gates of *mao* and *you*.”* The cauldron and furnace are the *qi*-cavity. The “mysterious root” is the original yang essence and *qi* returning to the root for refinement. Cauldron, furnace, and mysterious root all denote where the fire is applied. One must not only advance yang fire and retreat yin tally; if advance and retreat are not balanced with bathing, they become illusory. If one bathes without advancing and retreating, the bathing does not achieve harmony. Thus, one must be clear.

The Chan master Mazu said: *“There is no constant movement without rest, no constant rest without movement.”*

The Elder of True Yang said: *“From dawn to dusk, know the firing sequence at *yin* and *shen*.”* The Elder of Pure Yang had already spoken directly of bathing at the *mao* and *you* hours. His teacher, the Elder of True Yang, said: *“At *yin* and *shen*, *yin* descends to *mao*, and *shen* descends to *you*. When practicing to the timing of *yin* and *shen*, do not forget the bathing at *mao* and *you*.”* He also said: *“Bathing and shedding the embryo divide at *mao* and *you*.”* The “division” in the bathing of embryo-shedding means it seems present at first and then seems absent. In the work of refining *qi* into spirit without leakage, only the Elder of True Yang revealed this eternal secret. He further said: *“Bathing and concealment are all emptiness.”* Bathing that achieves true emptiness is the mechanism of immortality. Without true emptiness, one falls into heterodox paths. Forced control also leads to grave illness.

The *Annotations on the Awakening to Reality* states: *“Advancing yang fire at *zi* and ceasing fire is called bathing. Retreating yin tally at *wu* is also called bathing.”* It also says: *“Truly, guard against danger for a hundred days.”* The lesser celestial cycle has advancing and retreating fire, as well as fire that neither advances nor retreats. If the advance and retreat do not match their proper numbers, timing, or method—if they do not follow the correct path of starting and stopping, or if one does not know when the fire is sufficient to cease—all these are dangers to guard against.

Xiao Zixu said: *“Guard against errors in the firing sequence; avoid drowsy confusion in dreams.”*

The *Scripture of the Heavenly Worthy’s Attainment of the Dao and Liberation of the Body* says: *“Regulate the breath softly, as if present, as if absent.”*

The Elder of Purple Yang said: *“Do not idly watch the medicine furnace for the firing sequence; simply settle the spirit and breath, letting nature take its course.”* Letting the spirit and breath follow nature resembles the fire of the greater celestial cycle. Yet the preceding line about guarding the medicine furnace refers to the fire of the lesser celestial cycle. Though refining the fire in the medicine furnace is a deliberate act, it must ultimately align with natural spontaneity to be wondrous. Otherwise, it is not true fire or true timing—it is the fire of heterodox teachings.

Master Apricot Grove said: *“With a tranquil mind, practice the firing sequence; in stillness, seek true lead.”*

The Elder of Purple Yang, Master Apricot Grove’s teacher, said: *“Only stillness can refine the elixir; without stillness, the elixir does not form.”* These are the most wondrous and essential words.

The Elder of Purple Yang also said: *“When the firing sequence is not in use, the winter solstice is not at *zi*. When it is time for bathing, *mao* and *you* are likened to emptiness.”* The two characters “likened to emptiness” unify all four lines.

When not in use, it does not refer to the twelve hours of the almanac but to the twelve hours silently circulated within the mind, likened to emptiness. The winter solstice signifies the moment when yang arises within the human body; one must ignite the fire of the *zi* hour, thus calling the time of yang’s birth *zi*, not the *zi* month of midwinter. Among the twelve hours of a day, any hour in which yang arises may be called *zi*. During the bathing phase, it is likened to emptiness at *mao* and *you*. *Mao* stands at the midpoint of the six yang hours, and *you* at the midpoint of the six yin hours; when the breath is regulated to reach the midpoint of these six-hour periods, one may bathe.

It is also said: *“Do not divide *zi* and *wu* by the marked hours; distinguish *qian* and *kun* without relying on the hexagrams’ lines.”* Each hour contains eight *ke*, but the unmarked hour is the time of silent circulation within the mind, where *zi* and *wu* are divided in emptiness, not by the marked hours. Each hexagram has six lines, as in the *Yijing*, but within the body, the cauldron and vessel are likened to *qian* and *kun* in emptiness, hence the term “without lines.” All this describes the firing sequence of elixir refinement, the timing of the minor celestial cycle. This single line by Master Chongxu summarizes the fire used by the many sages in the hundred-day process.

A disciple asked: *“The true sayings of the sages regarding fire are many—why is this called the minor celestial cycle, used for the hundred-day refinement of essence into qi?”*

The master replied: *“The minor celestial cycle involves advance and retreat, bathing, inversion, and the degrees of the celestial orbit. All references to refining the medicine, refining the elixir, guarding the cauldron, observing the vessel, the medicine’s ripening, and the elixir’s completion pertain to the hundred-day minor celestial cycle. Thus, based on this method, later sages and true adepts have distinguished and collected teachings not found in the *Great Treasury of Sutras*, providing verification for future generations.”*

The *Heart Seal Scripture* states: *“When the wind returns and blends, the hundred-day work becomes efficacious.”* The “returning wind” is the circulation of breath, a metaphor for qi. “Blending” refers to the original spirit residing in the heart and the original qi in the kidneys, which are naturally far apart. When qi arises and rushes outward, the spirit, though aware, cannot be employed without the method of blending. Thus, this scripture speaks of using the breath’s qi to circulate, so that spirit and qi return to their root (ascending to the Mud Pill Palace) and restore life (descending to the Life Stem), blending them until the spirit governs the qi and they unite. Without the wondrous function of the returning wind, even if the spirit governs the qi, one cannot know whether the qi accepts governance. This is the most secret and essential method of refining the golden elixir. Practicing it for a hundred days yields manifest efficacy. (For those with an unbroken body, a hundred days suffice; for those with a broken body, ten years are needed. If less than a year is spent, one must supplement to complete this primordial qi.) When qi is sufficient, it stabilizes; when the spirit is long accustomed, it stabilizes—thus, the minor celestial cycle’s returning wind method should cease here.

From this point onward, all describes the signs when the fire of the minor celestial cycle is sufficient and should cease. Master Zhengyang said: *“When the elixir is ripe, do not apply the firing sequence; if you do, you will harm the elixir.”* When the fire is sufficient and the medicine ripe, no further fire is needed—this is the sign of proper fire. Upon reaching the time to cease fire, one must no longer apply it; doing so would be of no benefit and would harm the elixir. When the elixir is ripe, it must be removed from the cauldron and transferred to another. If not placed in another vessel, it will have nowhere to go—would this not harm the elixir? Essence is transformed into qi within the qi cavity, and qi into spirit within the spirit chamber—hence the term “another vessel.”

Master Cui’s *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: *“When qi is received in full, guard against misfortune. When the firing sequence is complete, do not harm the elixir.”* When the yellow sprout leaks from the cauldron and white snow fills the sky, the infant takes form—thus, the firing sequence is complete. Once the firing sequence is complete, one should only bathe and nurture gently. If one does not know when to stop and continues applying fire at will, the elixir will be harmed. After the elixir is complete, heaven and earth blend, and spirit and qi become naturally efficacious. The immortal masters speak of *“emptiness giving birth to whiteness, the numinous coming of its own accord”*—this is the numinosity of heaven and earth.

Master Purple Yang said: *“Refine the returning elixir with urgency, but once refined, know when to stop. If you persist in seeking fullness without ceasing, you will inevitably suffer disgrace one day.”* Master Liaozhen said: *“Beware of applying the firing sequence needlessly; not knowing when to stop will surely lead to peril.”*

Additional annotations record two accounts of the practices of Masters Qiu and Cao. Master Qiu once said: *“During a fast in Chang’an’s capital, before ceasing fire, I lost it three times by evening—this is called ‘losing the elixir,’ and all prior effort was wasted. I had to refine anew and later attained celestial immortality.”* When Master Cao first refined essence, he experienced a sign but did not recognize it, reacting with a sudden start. Upon settling again, the sign reappeared. He suddenly realized: *“The master said to cease fire!”*

Alas, what a pity—so near, yet missed at the crucial moment. Later, when refining anew, he did not mistake the initial sign. The timing of ceasing fire was swift, not waiting for the sign to appear four times before stopping. Ceasing fire at the precise moment—neither too soon nor too late—he obtained the medicine, passed the barrier, and transmuted the yang spirit. In the cultivation of the sacred and true, one endures a thousand hardships and ten thousand sorrows. After refining the Golden Elixir with such toil, how could one be careless and risk peril? Moreover, this is the foremost matter at the threshold between the mundane and the sacred.

All this speaks of the signs at the completion of the Elixir and the ceasing of fire—such is the firing sequence for the Nine-Returns Elixir of Celestial Immortality. Here, here. The timing for refining essence into qi is now complete.

Master Chongxu summarizes the hundred-day process of gathering, refining, and ceasing fire. From this point onward, he urges learners to study and ponder the teachings of past sages. Here, I conclude this section—let the words rest.

Master Chongxu further speaks of the secret mechanisms of the firing sequence within the hundred-day barrier, summarizing them thus:

*“From knowing when the medicine arises to its gathering, sealing, and firing—circulating through the microcosmic orbit—within it lie the methods of advancing and retreating, inversion, bathing, exhalation, movement and stillness, rising and ceasing. Though the techniques vary, the true mechanism is wondrously subtle: it lies in a single qi unifying the true qi without deviation into dual threads, and a single spirit driving the two qi without the slightest lapse into distraction. Even after three hundred microcosmic orbits, with their divisions, remainders, and symbolic resonances, the mystery of a single moment aligns with that of three hundred. Only then does qi return to the One Qi, spirit settle into the One Spirit, essence stabilize, and qi congeal. When the timing is fulfilled and fire ceases, it becomes the foundation for ingesting the medicine and the dwelling for preserving spirit.*

*This passage is Master Chongxu’s detailed account of the hundred-day refinement of essence and the subtle steps of the firing sequence—a distillation of true insight. The Small Celestial Circuit is but a general term for the firing sequence during essence refinement, yet within it lie many principles, each expounded differently by past sages. The gathering of medicine is one moment, and sealing it is another—Bodhidharma spoke only of these two moments. ‘Gathering medicine’ here conflates the two into one. There are also four moments, each with its own wondrous function—these belong to the three hundred moments within the Small Celestial Circuit. I now follow the Immortal Elder in speaking of two.*

*When discussing the advancing and retreating moments during the microcosmic orbit, if it does not resemble true advancement or retreat, it is merely a figurative reference. In the lead-mercury elixir method, ‘advancing’ means applying fire to the furnace, and ‘retreating’ means withdrawing fire from it—this is concrete and easily understood. I take ‘increase’ as advancement and ‘decrease’ as retreat, which is also clear and reliable. However, in essence refinement, it is not so straightforward. Here, I merely force a comparison, not claiming resemblance where none exists. During the six yang phases, Qian employs nine, and the increase in number signifies advancement. During the six yin phases, Kun employs six, and the decrease in number signifies retreat. Within the microcosmic orbit, advancing with yang fire and retreating with yin tally cannot be expressed in terms of increase or decrease. If framed in terms of application, the meaning diverges entirely.*

*‘Inversion’ refers not to the inversion of medicinal substances but to the inversion within the firing sequence. As Immortal Lü said: ‘The great key lies in inversion.’ Initially, the master taught that during the six yang phases, fire primarily advances and ascends, with retreat merely following. During the six yin phases, the tally primarily retreats and descends, with advancement merely following. ‘Primarily’ means focusing on ascent for gathering and descent for refinement. ‘Following’ implies a secondary, accompanying movement—necessary for coming and going, yet not to be weighted equally with the primary action. Such is the secret inversion of past sages.*

*‘Bathing’ refers to the positions within the sequence of the twelve earthly branches: zi, chou, yin, mao… Each has its place. While worldly methods involve the five phases, inner alchemy employs them as metaphors, each with its ‘position of long life’—yin, shen, si, and hai. Fire is born in yin, water in shen, metal in si, and wood in hai. The positions of mao, you, zi, and wu are the ‘bathing’ positions. Thus, in the firing sequence of the Dao, when fire passes from chou and yin to mao, it borrows the ‘bathing’ position and is called ‘bathing.’ The same applies to you. Yet the deluded and heretical teachings of the world do not even know why it is called ‘bathing’—how could they grasp its meaning and application? Here, I only briefly touch upon the essentials. For a detailed account, consult the *Records of the Unity of Sages and Buddhas*. Those who read this may refer to those records to examine the full mechanism.”*

To move, to dwell, to rise, and to cease—moving is the metaphor of the two traditions of immortals and buddhas; dwelling is the metaphor of the two traditions of immortals and buddhas. Rising occurs after the two periods of *cai* and *feng*, where the lesser celestial cycle begins. Ceasing is when the lesser celestial cycle’s periods are complete and the fire is halted. The *one qi* is the breath that threads through the true *qi*, unbroken from *cai* to cessation; if severed, it must be reconnected, or else it becomes two strands. This arises from a mind sunk in torpor or scattered in distraction—at worst, it may become three or four strands, all useless fire. Beware, beware!

Yet when the breath threads through the true *qi*, it must be governed by the one spirit without deviation. If an extraneous thought arises within, it severs; if an external perception intrudes, it severs. Severed, there are no periods, no fire—how then can *qi* be sufficient to generate vitality? Three hundred and sixty degrees? Thus, a single celestial cycle is said to be five degrees and one-fourth of a degree. That which is called the intercalary position in the division of celestial degrees—is this not so? Knowing the intercalary, one knows the true completion of the celestial cycle. Able to complete it truly, *qi* is easily stabilized, the elixir easily formed, and the initially generated medicine easily produced.

This is the mysterious and wondrous mechanism, the untransmitted secret. Every aspect of the fire periods must be thus; without this, the fire cannot breathe according to the method, becoming obstructed in true breath and nearing the heavy turbidity of the mundane nose and mouth, which leads to illness. Without this, the spirit cannot govern the two *qi*, nor can it make their movement and dwelling natural. One breath is thus, and three hundred breaths are all thus. This is what the ancient true sages subtly hinted at but dared not speak openly, nor fully articulate.

Without this, even if one claims to have completed the celestial cycle, it approaches the heretical teachings of the celestial cycle—useless. Thus, the three words "mysterious and wondrous mechanism" are the pivot of the hundred-day refinement of essence into *qi*. The periods of *cai*, *feng*, refinement, and cessation are all indispensable. If, beyond this one *qi*, one chases after the desire realm, engaging in the essence of lustful union, or clings to sights, sounds, speech, and movement as aids to lustful union—if one does not stray outward but returns to the one, the spirit can directly enter great samadhi. This is what is meant by "the periods complete, the fire ceases, and the foundation is laid." Thus, it becomes the permanent base for ingesting the medicine, the dwelling place for preserving the spirit and entering samadhi. This is what is meant by "first take white metal as the crucible."

Daoist master Xue of Daoguang had the principle of "using lead in stabilized breath." Once true lead is obtained, the great medicine is ingested. Elder Zhengyang called this "drawing out lead." The great medicine is the golden elixir of yang essence transformed into *qi*. From where is it obtained? It emerges from the *qi*-cavity of the cinnabar field. Before it transforms into *qi*, what is generated emerges from the cinnabar field as an insubstantial, subtle *qi* clinging to the outer body as form. Formerly, Master Cao, considering the later term "great medicine," named this "lesser medicine" because its *qi* is small. When refined into the golden elixir—that is, what is generated after the transformation into *qi*—it also emerges from the cinnabar field, called the great medicine. It is a tangible *qi* with form, like a fire pearl, also transitioning from non-being into being.

The Yellow Emperor spoke of the "crimson waters and mysterious pearl," also calling it "the one’s water," "the one’s essence," "the true one’s *qi*," "the flowery pond," "the lotus pond," "the golden lotus surging from the earth," "the heavenly maiden offering flowers," "the dragon maiden presenting the pearl," "the treasure pagoda surging from the earth," "the knife-point," "the yellow sprout," "true lead"—such varied names spoken by immortals and buddhas all refer to nothing but the true *qi* generated in the cinnabar field. Once formed, it has its own shape, no longer clinging to the outer form but only generated within, used within, perceptible and visible to my spirit’s awareness.

After crossing the two bridges and passing the three barriers, it is all perceptible and visible—this is what is meant by "escaping the fruit of birth and death," from which true verification is obtained. Refining the spirit through the fire periods is called "adding mercury." This fire period is the greater celestial cycle. "Adding mercury" refers to the spiritless within the heart, called mercury. In ordinary people, the spirit is half-active by day in yang brightness and half-still by night in yin dullness. Yang is like life, yin like death. Those who cultivate refinement must gradually eliminate the dull and yin aspects. Thus, eliminating one part of dullness adds one part of yang. Removing two, three, four, or five parts of yin adds two, three, four, or five parts of yang. Gradually, one strives to eliminate all ten parts of yin and add ten parts of yang, called "pure yang." Pure yang without yin sleep is called "the fetus complete, the spirit complete."

Thus, the ancients said, "If a portion of yin remains unexhausted, one does not become an immortal"—all this is the theory of adding mercury. Yet what is called "adding" must arise from practicing the fire of the greater celestial cycle. With fire, the primordial *qi* can nurture the primordial spirit, and the primordial spirit does not depart from the two *qi*, becoming empty and stabilized until the yang spirit’s fruit is full. Without adding mercury and practicing fire, the spirit cannot govern the fire with yang brightness—how can the fire be practiced? Adding three or five parts of yang brightness allows practicing three or five parts of fire. Only with yang brightness can one obtain the two *qi* to nurture the primordial spirit and assist in achieving lasting awareness.

If the true *qi* is severed and ceases to generate, this is the state of instability where the medicine does not arise—at this time, one verifies the fruit of long life and immortality. Without refining the spirit, yang brightness is not achieved, and one ultimately attains only corpse liberation. Refining the spirit means refining the spirit’s brightness to reach pure yang, with no yin sleep, fire sufficient, *qi* stabilized, and spirit fully stabilized—only then is the yang spirit accomplished.

The method of refining the spirit relies entirely on the stillness and stabilization of the two *qi*, merging them into extinction. If the two *qi* deviate even slightly from the proper method, the spirit remains unrefined, yang is not pure, and one cannot project the spirit. If within ten months one has never emerged from samādhi, this merely attains the fruit of corpse liberation. Why? Because as long as there remains the breathing of an ordinary person, there remains the birth and death of an ordinary person. Most feared are water, fire, blades, and weapons, which sever form and spirit into two. The so-called corpse liberation still follows the path of birth and death—this is due to failing to complete the great celestial cycle, and because the two *qi* and the spirit have not entered stabilization. Once the elixir is formed and life is prolonged, how can one not enter the great stabilization?

Later learners and sagely perfected ones, take heed. Thus, the *Ninefold Transmutation of the Jade Elixir* states: *"One further fears that if the qi pauses for too long, the divine elixir’s transformation will stagnate."* These three lines expand upon the preceding five, forming a total of thirteen lines from beginning to end. Here, Master Chongxu continues the above to distinguish the crucial celestial mechanism between the sagely and the ordinary.

"Pausing the qi" refers to halting the *qi* of the celestial fire timing. It may occur when the solid essence from Kan is obtained to ignite the yin within Li, diligently transmuting Li’s yin into pure yang. Once Kan’s solid essence is obtained to ignite Li’s brightness, if one does not immediately proceed with the great celestial cycle’s fire timing, Kan’s solid essence will not actively generate to ignite Li. Or, if one performs the great celestial cycle’s fire timing but fails to align with the mysterious celestial mechanism, it is as if one has not performed it at all—Kan’s solid essence will not actively generate to ignite Li’s yin, thus delaying the spirit within Li’s yin from transforming into pure yang.

The divine elixir is Kan’s solid essence, called the golden elixir. When it ignites Li, the two *qi* gradually transmute into spirit. As the two *qi* gradually dissolve, only the numinous awareness of the spirit remains—hence it is also called "refining *qi* to transform into spirit." The Pure Yang Patriarch said: *"From now on, strike a stringless zither anew."* "Strike anew" means to proceed with the great celestial cycle (explicitly distinct from the minor celestial cycle). "Stringless zither" signifies formlessness and soundlessness.

Yet, since the great and minor cycles differ in their fire timing, one must first understand the clear saying before discussing the practice of fire. Perfected Master Ziyang said: *"In general, the fire timing is only this one great celestial cycle, which is highly perilous—it must not be regarded as equivalent to the dawn fire timing."* Guangchengzi said: *"Cease toiling at the elixir crucible and river chariot; the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath naturally endure."*

The statement "dispense with the river chariot" signifies that the hundred-day minor celestial cycle has already passed, rendering its use unnecessary. Now, in the ten-month great celestial cycle, one employs only the ceaseless fire of the crane’s embryo and tortoise’s breath.

The *Shangqing Jade Perfected Embryonic Breathing Formula* states: *"I take spirit as my chariot and qi as my steed, driving them all day without weariness."* In the prior hundred days, one revolved the river chariot with yang essence; in this embryonic breathing, one turns spirit to enter samādhi, taking spirit as the chariot and qi as the steed to guide the spirit-chariot. This metaphor illustrates refining *qi* to transform into spirit—later learners must discern this clearly.

Bai Yuchan said: *"The heart enters emptiness to enact the fire timing."* To be unattached to emptiness is for spirit and *qi* to enter samādhi without clinging to form, which is the true emptiness spoken of by Perfected Master Qiu. Though practicing the great celestial cycle, one does not perceive the form of the great celestial cycle—this is the subtlety of emptiness.

Fan Dezhao said: *"Inner qi does not exit; outer qi does not enter—this is not breath-holding."* Those who speak of breath-holding refer to forced restraint. The Dao of immortality possesses its own celestial mechanism, distinct from the forced restraint of heterodox schools. Though inner *qi* does not exit and outer *qi* does not enter, this is not forced endurance; there is a true breath harmonizing with the marvelous movement of spontaneity, by which one enters samādhi.

Bai Yuchan said: *"The highest-grade elixir method has no hexagrams or lines."* For the minor celestial cycle transforms *qi*, which involves hexagrams and lines—a lesser accomplishment’s fire. The great celestial cycle, however, has no hexagrams or lines, being the fire of great accomplishment. As it transforms spirit, it is called the highest grade.

Peng Helin said: *"When the elixir is completed, one must bathe."* The elixir’s completion refers to the prior golden elixir’s formation; "bathing" is a metaphor for the great celestial cycle. It means that once the elixir is formed, the minor cycle is no longer needed. Having entered the first month of the ten-month period, one must employ the great cycle.

Elder Master Zhengyang said: *"Bathe once a year to guard against peril."*

Wu Zhenyang said: *"Though 'bathing' in the minor celestial cycle is a metaphor, here it is also a metaphor for the great celestial cycle. In the minor cycle, it is spoken of as the metaphor of two hours and two months; in the great cycle, it is spoken of as the metaphor of one year. In the minor cycle, one may use a minor metaphor; in the great cycle, one may use a grand metaphor. 'Guarding against peril' means guarding against the inevitable peril of fixation. If the immortal mechanism has ebb and flow, then bathing is not fixed. If the Buddha-dharma does not long abide, bathing is likewise not fixed. Bathing most values a settled mind—guarding against peril is precisely guarding against the mind’s unsettledness, guarding against bathing that is not in accord with the method."*

He further said: *"No need to apply fire phases; the furnace is naturally warm."* This means that in the ten-month period, one need not use fire with phases. One should employ a warm, phaseless fire—neither cold nor parched, neither existent nor nonexistent—this is the true image of warmth.

Elder Master Wang Chongyang said: *"Once the sacred embryo has congealed, nurture it with gentle fire. Calm the spirit and settle the breath, allowing it to follow its nature."*

Daoguang said: *"Bathing once a year guards against peril; in the ten months, harmonize with careful moderation."* Bathing is the phaseless fire, which is the great celestial cycle. "Careful moderation" means strictly adhering to the principle of bathing. "Guarding against peril" means guarding against distraction and unsettledness beyond bathing. Once one attains stability after a year, one must remain in stability at all times—through years and kalpas—far beyond the mere ten-month period.

Chen Xubai said: *"Fire must have phases, yet need not be timed; the subtle mechanism, I alone know."* The "phases" here refer to the fire of the great celestial cycle—the phaseless phase, the wondrous state of seeming presence and absence. "Need not be timed" means not using the twelve hours as phases, thus entering non-action. The "subtle mechanism" is like bathing yet not bathing, ever stable yet ever aware—hence, "I alone know." Without this knowledge, the fire grows dull and cold, and the elixir’s power wanes.

Zixu said: *"Stabilize the intent as if in fire phases."* "As if" means as if present yet not present, as if absent yet not absent. Only when the intent is stabilized within the phase of seeming presence and absence does one attain the true phase of the great celestial cycle—this is true practice.

He further said: *"When observed, it seems present; when sought, it vanishes."* In the great celestial cycle’s stability, one enters emptiness. Yet if one abruptly clings to emptiness, one falls into voidness. Thus, it is said to seem present yet absent—emptiness that is not empty, for true emptiness and true stability lie in boundlessness.

Again: *"Not in breath nor in counting breaths; naturally, mother and child embrace."* Breath and counting breaths are matters of deliberate action. Now, having entered stability, one is no longer in deliberate action but follows nature to realize non-action.

He further said: *"Guard the True One, and there is no coming or going."* The True One: in the earlier refinement of essence, the true essence obtained through refinement is called the True One. Here, in refining *qi*, the *qi* of true essence unites with true spirit, employing the *qi* of true breath to guard it—when the three merge and return to spirit, it is called the True One. All are stabilized and unmoving; the breath is already without breath—how could there be coming or going?

An ancient text says: *"Six hundred chapters on fire phases, each resembling the gathering of true lead."* The *Cantong Qi* also states: *"Six hundred chapters on fire phases, each resembling the other."* Yet it does not reveal the wondrous essence of gathering true lead. Here, "resembling the gathering of true lead" encompasses the profound within the profound. Gathering true lead is what Xue Daoguang called "stabilizing the breath to gather the true." Though the chapters resemble one another, they all return to great stability.

Ma Danyang said: *"Unceasing effort is called the numinous embryo; stabilizing the breath is termed the embryo’s breath."* Stabilizing the breath in emptiness, the spirit naturally guards the breath, becoming embryonic breath. With unbroken stability, the spirit remains ever aware, and the embryonic spirit becomes numinous.

Xinglin said: *"No need for fire phases, yet beware of harming the infant."* Upon first entering the ten-month gate, one must use fire phases to refine *qi* and transform spirit, forming the embryo of the infant—a metaphor for the subtlety of spirit. Once the embryo is formed and the infant is complete, about to manifest externally, fire is no longer needed. If fire is reapplied, it pertains to the unfinished work of the unformed infant—how could it not harm the infant?

The *Zhonghe Ji* says: *"Guarding it is delusion; releasing it is not so. Neither guarding nor forgetting, neither restraining nor indulging—examine this ever-present 'who.'"*

In the great celestial cycle’s stability, it is as if present, as if absent. "As if present" is the stabilization of spirit and *qi*; "as if absent" is the spirit and *qi* stabilized yet without the appearance of stabilization. To speak of "guarding" is to cling to presence, and clinging to presence gives rise to the delusion of forgetting. To release it without awareness is to separate spirit and *qi*, which is not the principle of stability. Yet if there is a faint semblance of presence—if the two *qi* remain—then the spirit remains. With the spirit remaining, the two *qi* remain, all abiding in stability, all becoming emptiness. The wondrous realm beyond emptiness lies herein.

Helinzi said: *"When forged into a single mass, I ask: do you comprehend? No increase, no decrease—why withdraw or add? No going, no coming—why advance or retreat?"* When spirit and *qi* unite and stabilize into one mass, there is no fire. Unlike the minor celestial cycle with its increases and decreases, here there is no increase or decrease, no withdrawal or addition. The breath has no coming or going—how could there be advance or retreat? This is the return to oneness, gradually returning to nothingness.

Zhang Jingxu said: *"The true phase is not the nine-six lines; it is neither inversion nor advance-retreat. The mechanism resembles bathing yet is not bathing. After long stability in emptiness, the spirit attains wisdom."*

"As for the *true phase*, when the firing process stabilizes, it becomes emptiness—no longer employing the nine-six lines of the minor celestial cycle, nor its inversions or bathing phases, but only abiding in stable emptiness. Through long stability and prolonged emptiness, the spirit attains wisdom and illumination, shining brightly alone, akin to the Nirvana of the World-Honored One, entering the *extinction of all marks*.

Qiu Changchun said: *'If the breath retains even the slightest instability, life is not one’s own.'* Where there is breath, there is birth and death; where there is no breath, birth and death cease. When the mind stabilizes and breath naturally vanishes, life becomes self-possessed, and one attains the Dao of deathlessness. If even a trace of breath remains unsettled, life is governed by breath, no longer one’s own, but subject to the dominion of heaven and earth, yin and yang, and the Lord of the Underworld.

All this speaks of refining *qi* to transform spirit, the ten-month gestation, the firing process of the great celestial cycle. Here, Master Chongxu summarizes the teachings of the various sages and perfected beings on the firing process of the great celestial cycle.

I have also said: *'The great celestial cycle does not reckon by lines, fundamentally lacking deliberate action. Warm and continuous, it is not mere inert nothingness. Initially, it seems neither to cling to being nor non-being; ultimately, it wholly returns to great stability. One must not mistake non-being for attainment, for that falls into the fruit of minor understanding. Nor should one cling to the fire, assuming it must always be active, for that loses the return to great stability. From being to non-being, once true stability is reached, the Dao of transcending spirit, ascending in flight, and soaring aloft is fully realized.'*

Moreover, Master Chongxu himself expounds the essence of the great celestial cycle, repeatedly admonishing and exhorting: *'Not reckoning by line images' refers to non-action, distinct from the minor celestial cycle. Warm yet not entirely absent, this is the true principle of the great celestial cycle’s beginning—seeming both present and absent. In the initial stages of the great celestial cycle, during the first, second, and third months, it is called 'seeming to abide,' for there is still some presence. It is called 'seeming absence,' for true absence has not yet been achieved. Thus, traces of the mortal’s food-nature and breath still linger. Only when wholly returning to great stability, with breath and food-nature extinguished, does the *Golden Cinnabar and Dragon-Tiger Classic* state: *'The essential of spontaneity is first presence, then absence.'* Yu Yan annotates: *'First preserve spirit within the qi-cavity, then let it vanish together. Spirit naturally congeals, breath naturally stabilizes.'*

Yet one must also know that fire fundamentally desires to arise from non-being. If one fails to grasp the subtlety of first seeming presence and insists, *'Since it is originally absent, why feign presence?'* one will inevitably fall into utter nothingness, unable to reach true absence, and descend into the minor attainment of corpse-liberation. One must also know that fire arises from seeming presence yet must ultimately return to absence. If one clings to presence, failing to recognize that it is not the final step, and remains perpetually in being without non-being, one will likewise fall into utter presence. How then can one attain the return to great stability, endure through kalpas without death, and avoid becoming a mere *door-guard ghost*, another form of corpse-liberation, ultimately returning to the path of birth and death?

Reflect: in the beginning, refining essence to replenish *qi* entailed countless hardships and toils before one could verify the secret transmitted across myriad kalpas, achieving minor attainment. How can one then carelessly neglect the pursuit of great attainment? I further exhort: *'From being to non-being, once true stability is reached and one abides long in the realm of emptiness, the Dao of transcending spirit, ascending in flight, and soaring aloft is fully realized.'* This is why the firing process of the great celestial cycle is the essential path to becoming an immortal, becoming a Buddha, and completing the Dao.

I further summarize the transformation of *qi* into spirit: *'The first hundred days of refining essence into qi require deliberate effort—entering being from non-being, akin to the Buddhist principle of myriad dharmas returning to one. The subsequent ten months of refining qi into spirit proceed from being to breathless absence—entering non-being from being, akin to the Buddha’s entry into the fourth dhyāna and the extinction of all marks, the return to utter non-being.'* This is the secret method of both the Daoist and Buddhist traditions, an indispensable and crucial mechanism.

Master Chongxu now reclarifies this for later sages and perfected beings, guiding future masters, verifying the transmission of immortals, and preventing later students from rigidly adhering to being or non-being, to phases of presence or absence, thereby establishing sectarian divisions and making false comparisons. Such is the celestial mechanism.

From this passage to the conclusion, Master Chongxu summarizes the entire firing process, further revealing the secret mechanism of refining spirit to return to emptiness, providing verification for later sages. These are the direct words of the immortals. Previously, the immortals spoke plainly in the world, yet people failed to awaken, so their teachings were not fully disclosed. From ancient times to the present, many have spoken of the firing process, but none have explained it in full—only a phrase or two. Without completeness, how can later generations apply it? How can they speculate?"

Thus do the world’s common folk idly speculate—only those with immortal destiny shall be delivered by immortals themselves. Yet when scattered, their teachings remain fragmentary; when gathered, they unfold in full sequence. The complete firing process need not issue solely from my lips, but with the appearance of this book, it becomes the root scripture of the *Fire Canon for Myriad Perfected Ones in the Coming Kalpa*. Those who encounter it shall naturally awaken through it, no longer straying into heterodox paths.

Heterodox paths employ the fire of forms, clinging to qi and attachment as "firing practice." Knowing the natural constancy of immortal fire, one no longer resorts to the forced and deviant fire of restraint. Therein the yang spirit coalesces, and the kalpic cycle is transcended.

Cultivating samādhi, entering samādhi, and mastering samādhi—all serve as the necessary means for exiting and transcending spirit. Those who attain fruition must undergo these stages over years of verification. Yet after exiting spirit, the nine-year marvel of refining spirit to return to emptiness—though I dare not claim full understanding—is nonetheless stated plainly in the *Zhonghe Collection*: *"Nine years, three years, ever in samādhi."* Even immortals speak thus directly.

Emerging yang spirit marks the initial attainment of immortality, like a newborn child from the womb: though possessing human form, it is not yet fully developed—hence the metaphor of the infant. As the ancients said: *"The child is young and not yet grown; it must rely on the nurturing grace of the Earth Mother."* This alludes to three years of nursing, while former sages spoke of accomplishment in only one or two years. Nursing here means the spirit and qi have stabilized, yet further wisdom of samādhi is added, maintaining constant samādhi without need for exit—like milk upon milk, until it matures into adulthood.

Once the spirit has ripened, if one proceeds directly to refine spirit and return to emptiness, the nine-year work begins. If world-saving vows remain unfulfilled, one need not yet undertake the nine years but may temporarily abide in the world to fulfill them. Only when desiring to transcend the world and ascend into emptiness must one return to emptiness through nine years. This is no trivial insight of worldly learning.

Those who employ it lightly must await enlightened adepts to wield it with emptiness and true suchness. Enlightened adepts are immortals who have exited samādhi; only by attaining samādhi does one gain the foundation of emptiness, and only by reaching the ultimate extremity of emptiness can one comprehend and apply this. Yet one must not, upon a single attainment, claim completion without proceeding to the final return to emptiness—otherwise, one will inevitably stagnate in the realm of spiritual powers.

The realm of spiritual powers manifests during the transformation of spirit, where spirit moves freely without obstruction. In the return to emptiness, spirit becomes even more unobstructed. Here, "spiritual powers" refer to the initial attainment, not yet fully realized—hence the warning against stagnation. To halt is to remain an immortal; only by returning to emptiness can one ascend to celestial immortality.

May later seekers take this as mutual encouragement.

**Chapter Five: On Refining the Self**

The "self" refers to the true nature within stillness and the true intent within movement—another name for the primordial spirit. The true nature of our heart originally governs essence and qi. When this governance is harmonious, it gives rise to humanity; this is the nature’s way. When this governance is perfected, it leads to sagehood; this, too, is the nature’s way. How could one proceed without first refining it?

When the medicine arises, one must not shirk the proper timing. After the medicine is refined, one must not neglect the proper signs. As the medicine nears completion, it may yet be lost through wayward thoughts. As the spirit is about to emerge, it may yet fall due to wayward thoughts. If one’s self is not pure, how can one attain the purity and authenticity of qi? If one’s self is not pure, how can one achieve the stillness and stability of spirit? How then can one transcend habitual defilements and restore the qi-embryo and spirit?

As the ancients said: *"Before refining the Returned Elixir, first refine the nature; before cultivating the Great Medicine, first cultivate the heart."* This is precisely what is meant. Ma Ziran once said: *"To refine the medicine, first learn to refine the heart; facing phenomena without attachment is the Great Return."* Zhang Xujing said: *"If you wish the spirit within the body not to depart, do not leave a single thing in the chamber of the numinous."*

Those who refine themselves do so by observing when the eyes chase after forms, then refining them to "not see." When the ears chase after sounds, they refine them to "not hear." In daily life, one must first refine in this manner, so that wayward thoughts are subdued, and the true nature becomes pure and still. Thus, *The Scripture of the Perfected Body Attained by the Primordial Heavenly Worthy* states: *"If sounds and forms are not cut off, emotions and qi will not be whole. If the myriad conditions are not severed, the spirit will not be at peace."* One must first refine the self, refining qi and refining spirit, so as not to be inverted by external phenomena.

When the medicine is gathered, it is immediately obtained. When the foundation is laid, it is immediately established. When the embryo is formed, it is then called the beginning of restored nature, and the work of refining the self is achieved.

The early sages spoke of refining the self in terms of its function within worldly dharmas and worldly thoughts, describing it in reverse. In the end, refining the self refers to the state of no opposition—returning alone to emptiness, where extinction and stillness are complete. From beginning to end, one refines the original nature to perfection. One who preserves the true nature is an immortal; one without true nature is not an immortal.

Foolish people of the world do not realize that immortals are Buddhas. They claim immortals must differ from Buddhas, yet they refuse to believe the *Lotus Sutra*, which states: *"The Tathāgata’s heavenly immortal path is subtle and inconceivable."* If they do not trust the Buddha’s words, why forcefully discuss Buddhism? Not only do they fail to understand immortals and Buddhas, but they also fail to recognize their own true nature. They merely spout reckless words to delude the world, sinking into the ocean of the Dharma of immortals and Buddhas without seeing a single wave—truly pitiable.

**Chapter Six: On Laying the Foundation**

Chongxuzi said: *"To cultivate immortality, one must first lay the foundation."* "Laying" means gradual accumulation and augmentation. The "foundation" is the root of cultivating the yang spirit, the place where spirit is stabilized and breath is settled.

The foundation must be laid first because the accomplishment, purity, and numinosity of the yang spirit always depend on essence and qi for its function. Spirit is originally yin, while essence and qi are yang. Relying on yang essence and true qi, one can form the yang spirit. Without relying on yang essence and true qi, one cannot form the yang spirit but remains only a yin spirit.

When essence and qi flourish, the spirit also flourishes, and its dharmic power is great. When essence and qi are depleted, the spirit is also depleted, and its numinous radiance weakens. This is the principle behind it.

To keep the primordial spirit constantly abiding and ever-numinous, one must also keep essence and qi constantly abiding, thus maintaining a lasting foundation. Before the foundation is laid, the primordial spirit chases after external phenomena, causing primordial qi to scatter and primordial essence to decay—the foundation is further ruined.

Moreover, when essence is lost through sexual desire over years and decades, clinging to the root of lust, can one suddenly make it impervious and return the qi? When qi scatters through breathing—exhaling and inhaling without cease—can one suddenly make it breathless and transform the spirit? When the spirit is seized by thoughts, shifting moment by moment without end, can one suddenly make it perpetually still and return to emptiness? These are all due to the lack of a foundation.

Thus, one must employ the Three Treasures—essence, qi, and spirit—combining them in refinement: essence replenishes essence, qi replenishes qi, and spirit replenishes spirit, thereby laying the foundation. Only by uniting them can the foundation be established; without unity, it cannot be established. This is what is meant by *"forging into one piece."*

Once the foundation is laid, essence is stabilized, qi naturally returns, and one attains the fruit of immortality, transcending the Desire Realm to become the foundation for ascending to the Form Realm. This is the foundation for the ten-month spirit stabilization. The ninety-day period without drowsiness is due to this foundation. The ten-month spirit not straying externally and entering the Great Vehicle is also due to this foundation.

Thus, when refining qi, qi immediately stabilizes, utterly without a single breath of respiration. When refining spirit, spirit immediately becomes empty, without a moment of confusion or sleep. This is what is meant by *"the yang spirit having a foundation."*

The foundation’s completion depends on yang essence being free from leakage, hence the name *"leakage-exhaustion penetration."* Without a foundation, there is no leakage-exhaustion penetration—only the numinous nature of yin and the fruit of the five penetrations. The five penetrations are the spiritual powers of the yin spirit. The yang spirit, however, possesses six penetrations, including leakage-exhaustion penetration.

The six penetrations are:
- Heavenly Eye Penetration,
- Heavenly Ear Penetration,
- Divine Realm Penetration,
- Past Lives Penetration,
- Others’ Minds Penetration,
- Leakage-Exhaustion Penetration.

This last penetration is what the yang spirit uniquely possesses.

The remaining five penetrations are shared with the yin spirit. Yet it cannot escape death here only to be reborn there—its dwelling is hard to secure. How can the yin spirit be relied upon? Should the foundation of the yang spirit not be swiftly established? Should it not be urgently investigated? Those who indulge in defiled and decayed essence instead deceive others, claiming, “Absorb and supplement to build the foundation.” They swindle the foolish, greatly deviating from the true Way—should they not be warned?

People of the world do not understand that the *prior-heaven* is the designation of utmost purity and stillness, from which the *posterior-heaven* tangible essence transforms. This is the *prior-heaven*. When stirred, it becomes the *prior-heaven* intangible essence—this, too, is the *prior-heaven*. When divided, it becomes the *posterior-heaven* tangible breath—this, again, is the *prior-heaven*. Such is the principle of the forward course.

The *original qi* is the root of the embodied life; all that the body possesses is transformed and generated from it. As for reverse cultivation: by not allowing it to transform into *posterior-heaven* tangible essence, one preserves this *prior-heaven*. By not allowing it to stir into *prior-heaven* intangible essence, one stabilizes this *prior-heaven*. By not allowing it to divide into *posterior-heaven* tangible breath, one subdues this *prior-heaven*. Only upon attaining the *prior-heaven* is it called *one qi*—one that becomes three, three that return to one. Though it bears several names, it serves several functions. Without discerning the distinction between prior and posterior, purity and turbidity, one cannot gather the true qi.

**Chapter Seven: On Refining the Elixir**
Chongxuzi said: “The immortal Dao takes the three origins—essence, qi, and spirit—as the true elixir (the original essence, original qi, and original spirit are called the three origins, all of the *prior-heaven*). Refining their union into one is likened to refining the elixir.”

Guiguzi said: “The Dao takes supreme spirit as its root, supreme essence as its elixir, harmonious balance as its function, and non-action as its governance—thus is the Way of longevity and enduring vision accomplished.” Without this, it is not the method of the Golden Liquor Great Return Elixir. Its principle is most subtle, its method most secret.

In ancient times, Ancestor Zhongli tested Ancestor Lü ten times. Ancestor Qiu endured a hundred trials under Chongyang. I, Wuzi, earnestly sought the Dao for twenty years from Cao Huanyang. I met my teacher in the winter of the *guisi* year of the Wanli era (1593) and received the complete Dao in the *renzi* year (1612). Counting from *ren* to *gui*, it spans twenty years—only then did I gain some attainment.

Thus, those in the world who blindly study the Dao or casually discuss it do not know what the true elixir is.

What is the true method of refinement? Merely seeking it through empty discourse on one’s own body and mind is to remain ignorant of the moment of utmost stillness and the true mechanism therein. This moment of utmost stillness and true mechanism arises when body and mind reach absolute quietude—akin to the final hour of *hai* and the first of *zi*, when extreme yin stillness must give rise to yang movement. Then qi naturally circulates and returns, and the true mechanism stirs of itself. This is precisely the formless primordial qi about to move and become the formless primordial essence—this formless primordial essence is the medicine.

Once the medicine’s qi and vitality emerge, there must be a primordial awareness of its presence. Use this awakened spirit as the master of refinement, and harmonious balance as its function, then employ the timing of kindling the fire to gather it. One must discern whether the medicine is tender or mature: if gathered too soon, its qi is faint and unresponsive, and the elixir will not form; if gathered too late, its qi scatters and loses potency, and the elixir will likewise fail to form.

Once the true medicine is obtained and returned to the furnace, apply the timing of firing to refine it—this is the firing of the Small Celestial Cycle. To kindle the fire before the medicine has returned to the furnace is folly. The Pure Yang Ancestor Lü warned: “To practice embryonic breathing without medicine, forcibly retaining it in the abdomen, may accumulate cold qi and cause illness. The medicine will dissipate externally and not belong to you. If you recklessly kindle the fire before the medicine is in the cauldron, it is like ‘boiling an empty crucible without the true seed.’ The great medicine will not form.”

If the medicine has returned to the furnace but the fire is not applied in time, the true qi will break and fail to continue, and the great medicine will not form. When the medicine is outside, it is drawn back to the furnace by fire and refined by fire—only then can it transform within the furnace. If the medicine has returned to the furnace but the fire ceases and does not continue, the true qi will also break and not persist. If the fire is reapplied later, even if it completes a full cycle, it will not connect with what came before—how then can the great medicine form? This is what is meant by “though the external fire moves and acts, the internal tally does not respond,” where celestial soul and earthly spirit fail to unite.

If one fixates solely on the fire, clinging to it excessively, the medicine will dissipate. (To fixate the mind on the fire is to later generate agitation, verging on the heterodox practice of visualization—this is not the wondrous function of the natural celestial mechanism.) If one is careless and unaware of the fire, the mind becomes dull and scattered. When applying the fire, if the heart is not sincere, it will not be efficacious, or one may become confused. In the course of a single twelve-hour period, one may lose track of the time, forget the moments of bathing, or be unsure of how many cycles to complete around the heavens—or even continue firing after completion. All these are failures of the fire, and the medicine will dissipate. If the fire cannot retain the medicine, how can it not dissipate? This is the meaning of “the spirit does not retain the qi.” In all these cases, the great medicine will not form.

The above all describe the dangers of solitary yin or solitary yang, of imbalance and partiality. If the fire is intermittent and the work inconsistent, even if the medicine is nearly formed, it will be ruined. Fire refines the medicine—an ancient saying goes, “Fire and medicine reside together.” The method of firing becomes ever more subtle and precise with time; only thus can the great medicine surely form and become fit for ingestion.

Yet at times, the spirit may chase after sensory perceptions, and wayward thoughts may stray outward, leading to demonic interference—then the adept is separated from the work. Fire departs from medicine, and the work becomes inconsistent—how can the great medicine form? Even if nearly complete, there remains the danger of regression and dissipation. If the fire is applied for too long without knowing when to stop, even if the medicine has formed, it will be ruined. Once the fire is sufficient, the great medicine is complete—how can one not cease the fire? At this point, if one gathers it, the medicine will no longer be the postnatal, tangible essence.

If one does not cease the fire and gather it, the great medicine for ingestion will not form, and the medicine will inevitably follow the errant movement of vitality. In neither case will the elixir be achieved. In the practice of the Dao, one must ensure that spirit and qi are balanced and united, that fire and medicine are in harmony. Use the qi of breath (which is the fire) to ride the true qi’s movement and stillness (which is the medicine), and by the true qi’s movement and stillness, establish the root of true breathing. When the true qi returns to its root, the true breath also settles at the root. The two qi unite as one at the root, forming the foundation of the fetal spirit. Thus, fire and medicine avoid all partiality and the perils of forced control or careless loss.

Only in this way can one grasp the wondrous principle of the Small Celestial Cycle, form the great medicine of longevity, and achieve the completion of the external Golden Elixir. As Ma Danyang said: “Because the fire below burns the elixir’s flame, the Yellow River’s waters flow backward.” The *Book of Jade Mushrooms* states: “If the mysterious and the yellow do not unite in pattern, how can yang fly upward from beneath *kan*?” This is the supreme treasure by which ancestors and perfected ones ingested the elixir and ascended—it is the highest of mysteries, most worthy of profound study and diligent practice.

Having obtained this true medicine and ingested it, one may advance to the firing of the Great Celestial Cycle to refine qi into spirit. Refine qi until the breath is settled, refine spirit until it is rounded. The yang spirit ascends to the Heavenly Gate and manifests—thus is the work of immortality achieved, and the ten-month affair of the middle barrier completed. Thereafter, one faces the wall to refine spirit and return to emptiness, stabilizing it for nine years, attaining immortality and suddenly awakening to nature in the boundless (where form and spirit are both wondrous). All this refines and perfects an indestructible, pure, and sacred body—all arising from the refinement of medicine in accord with the celestial mechanism, culminating in the formation of the elixir and the attainment of spirit.

Thus, in all great cultivation, the upper barrier of supreme accomplishment must be completed in this way. Within this method, those who begin by gathering the medicine for a hundred days and form the elixir for ingestion become earthbound immortals of immeasurable longevity.

When the ten-month gestation is complete and the fruit of the yang spirit emerges, one transcends the immortals bound by yin and yang. When the nine-year meditation facing the wall culminates in the fruit of returning to emptiness, one transcends the celestial immortals beyond all kalpas. Initially attaining immortality requires achieving great samādhi and emerging from samādhi. The attainment of samādhi arises from abiding in the center, while emergence from samādhi resides in the mud-pill palace—thus, even after the World-Honored One entered nirvāṇa, he too entered nirvāṇa in the mud-pill. Thereafter, returning to emptiness entails re-entering samādhi in the mud-pill. As the ancients said, “Nature resides in the mud-pill, life in the navel,” for the completion of life cultivation lies in the navel, while the completion of nature cultivation lies in the mud-pill. The samādhi of the mud-pill is incomparable to the nine-year stabilization of earlier stages. Initially, one may speak of entering samādhi briefly, yet it may extend for a hundred years, a thousand years, ten thousand years, a kalpa, a hundred kalpas, a thousand kalpas, or ten thousand kalpas—all constitute a single stabilization, which is precisely how celestial immortals and buddhas transcend kalpas. Those with karmic affinity who encounter this discourse on celestial immortals should purify their minds to comprehend it.

**Chapter Eight: On Subduing Qi**
Master Chongxu said: “The great threshold of human life and death hinges on a single qi. The distinction between sage and ordinary being lies in subduing qi. This subduing entails both concealment and taming. Concealment means deeply hiding and submitting to the root of primordial qi. Taming means strict restraint to prevent its dissipation outward. Both carry the intent of guarding against danger and averting peril. Only by subduing qi can essence be reverted and restored to primordial qi, and spirit be congealed and restored to primordial spirit. Thus, refining essence aims to harmonize and subdue this qi. The minor celestial cycle of refining essence harmonizes breath to subdue it, for it cannot be subdued instantly, hence the gradual method of harmonizing and subduing. Refining spirit aims to still this qi and subdue it. The major celestial cycle of refining spirit nurtures fetal breathing to subdue it, for it cannot be instantly stilled into nothingness, hence the gradual method. Fetal breathing appears as if existing yet not, ultimately dissolving into nothingness and nothing beyond nothingness, subdued in quiescence. The entire upward cultivation, from beginning to end, serves only to subdue this single breath of qi. The necessity of subduing it from start to finish arises because, before this body was born, at the initial convergence of the two qi, it lay concealed in the cinnabar field as the latent qi. Long subdued in stillness, it then stirred to generate respiration. Thus, only after stillness and subduing does the qi of respiration arise to form the human path—this is called ‘following birth.’ The reverse cultivation of immortality, called the ‘immortal path,’ must return respiration to stillness, subduing this qi. This is the principle of following and reversing qi. When respiration emerges from the mouth and nose, it becomes solely for their use, and thus the path of life and death begins. Departing from the mouth and nose means departing from life and death. If true qi scatters outward, it stagnates and harms this qi, leading to illness; if it dissipates, it leads to death. This occurs because one does not know that subduing is the means of restoration. To subdue is to return respiration to the qi cave, enabling primordial qi to return, primordial spirit to congeal, and all three to be subdued within the qi cave. Yet one may not know how to enact this subduing. Enacting subduing involves the most wondrous and secret celestial mechanism: respiration aligning with nature is authentic; qi aligning with the proper time for generation and gathering is authentic; spirit aligning with the utmost emptiness and profound stillness is authentic. Only when all three are authentic does one grasp the principle of subduing, and practicing it ensures success. Otherwise, it is heterodox practice—how can one guarantee long life and transcend life and death beyond the vast kalpas? Some falsely claim to subdue qi yet do not comprehend its true mechanism. They spend all day regulating breath, yet their mouth and nose respiration remains excessive. Foolishly fixating on hearing the breath, their abdomen becomes obstructed and intolerable. Alas! Such are the delusions of the ignorant—how can they witness the subduing and stillness of qi? As Immortal Qiu said, ‘If breath is not perfectly stabilized, life is not one’s own.’ When respiration ceases, the path of life and death is severed; if respiration remains unstable, one cannot escape life and death. The ancients spoke of regulating breath, but the respiration of ordinary people is already balanced in inhalation and exhalation—no regulation is needed. The immortals’ regulation of breath is not for worldly purposes but to harmonize primordial qi through deliberate action. Using spirit to gather qi, one must halt and then proceed, regulating it in the interval between cessation and movement. Following the principle of coming and going without attachment to its form, one aims to merge with the semblance of breathless respiration. This aligns with the saying of ‘mind and breath depending on each other.’ The ancients spoke of breath retention, yet internally, one remains empty, responding to phenomena like the great void, aiming to merge with the stillness and subduing within the boundless. This is the essence of subduing qi, the practical method for true cultivators to realize the Dao. Yet this celestial mechanism is profoundly subtle and rarely known. The boundless refers to the absence before the origin of qi; once divided, it becomes heaven and earth. Speaking of the boundless here refers to the state before heaven, earth, and qi existed—even before parents existed—depicting the scene of utmost emptiness and profound stillness. Only through wondrous awakening to this can true stillness and subduing be achieved. In sum, it is the secret mechanism of transforming qi and spirit. As the ancients said, ‘Long life requires subduing qi.’ From the celestial cycle through time, days, years, and kalpas, one must only subdue this qi.”

Speaking of what is subdued in a small celestial cycle and a great celestial cycle, in a day, a year, or a kalpa—whether briefly or over long durations—those who can achieve even one such subduing are truly Dao-attaining adepts. When this qi is profoundly settled, one no longer perceives where its subduing begins or ends. Without beginning or end, it spans the ages without a single pause, empty and still in unison with spirit. This is called the realm where form and spirit are both wondrous. Only those who follow the celestial immortals’ true Dao can comprehend this principle. Only those who have fully attained the Three Treasures can suddenly awaken to this practice.

The Three Treasures are original spirit, original qi, and original essence. If any one of these is not primordial, it is not a treasure; what belongs to the postnatal is useless and cannot achieve completion. This practice is the state of inner vastness like the great void, realizing the boundless stillness and stability. It is said that when the Three Treasures unite, refining essence into qi, one may then engage in constant stabilization and enter the work of samādhi. Without transforming qi, it is also useless.

This is for the sagely and perfected with great aspiration—examine it deeply and truly awaken to it.

**Chapter Nine: On Embryonic Breathing**
Chongxuzi said: “The ancient *Embryonic Breathing Classic* states: ‘The embryo forms from subdued qi; breath ceases within the formed embryo.’ This is the essential method for all buddhas, immortals, and celestial immortals of past and future.”

A man’s body originally has no embryo. To form one, there must be a cause. That cause is subduing qi within the qi cavern of the cinnabar field, where the embryo takes shape—thus, the embryo forms from subdued qi. Original qi, though still, must move; to keep it unmoving, there must be a place of concealment. The embryo is that place of concealment, where breath ceases and qi rests—thus, breath ceases within the formed embryo. The embryo grows as qi takes shape, and qi is further subdued as the embryo lengthens. Together, they cultivate a perfect embryonic spirit. This is the essential method for becoming an immortal or celestial immortal—without it, how else could it be achieved?

Yet embryonic breathing and subduing qi are fundamentally the same—why discuss them separately? Because nurturing an embryo requires embryonic breathing to complete its formation and house the spirit. The ancients spoke of embryonic breathing, and now we elaborate on it during the refinement of qi into spirit. Subduing qi returns essence to qi, and refining the medicine yields the great elixir. The ancients spoke only of subduing qi; we now also speak of it, though we use two terms to mutually clarify the principle, so that people understand the subtlety of both and do not mistakenly cling to them as separate.

I wish to further explain and discuss this directly. At the body’s inception, there were only two qi united as one, a single qi in the void—no embryo, no breath. Through the mother’s breathing, it grew into an embryo, and from the embryo came embryonic breathing. When the embryo was fully formed, its wonder lay in following the mother’s breath, breathing all day without suffocation. This breath did not pass through mouth or nose but was connected at the navel, appearing as if without breath at all. This is the true scene of embryonic breathing.

The ancients said: “Inner qi does not exit; outer qi does not enter”—not the practice of holding the breath. It refers to the navel connection: once separated from the embryo, breath is cut off. Without the mother’s navel linked to the child’s, one must begin breathing through mouth and nose, which is the same as embryonic breathing but temporarily differs in its aperture.

How can the principle of reverse cultivation and return not use one’s present breath to revert to the breath within the embryo? When returning the breath, the qi from mouth and nose breathing is restored to the place of embryonic breathing.

Baopuzi said: “Those who attain embryonic breathing no longer breathe through mouth or nose, as if within the womb—then the Dao is achieved.” (Within the navel, qi coalesces into the elixir.) When practicing embryonic breathing, gradually refine it until it becomes truly nonexistent. “Truly nonexistent” means the cessation of breath and stillness in samādhi. It means even the breath within the embryo is truly nonexistent—this aligns with the Chan teaching that all dharmas return to one, and one returns to nonexistence. This is the state before birth, returning to the realm without breath or embryo, no longer subject to the path of birth and death.

Yet achieving this is not sudden or without foundation. One cannot simply gather breath at the center and call it embryonic breathing. The breath is most difficult to subdue; it must rely on original qi to stabilize and form embryonic breathing. How does one know when embryonic breathing is achieved? When breath returns to the embryo and mouth and nose no longer breathe, embryonic breathing is truly accomplished—it will never again revert to mouth and nose breathing. The stabilization of true spirit is similar.

If ordinary people and external cultivators, ignorant of original qi, falsely claim to enter samādhi and still the breath, their breath cannot long remain in the embryonic place. Though they endure, the qi has nowhere to reside; when qi becomes urgent, it can kill. The breath through mouth and nose remains unrestrained. This is the conduct of those who defy the World-Honored One’s teaching of the patience of the unborn dharma. Worldly false Daoists and false Chan practitioners are all like this—later learners and sagely perfected ones must discern this and guard against danger.

This is also an example of “solitary yin cannot complete.” The breath is a postnatal, tangible yin substance—hence the need for this explanation. Only when the mechanism of prenatal qi is activated, when original spirit is uniquely awakened, and when breath is interdependent—when the Three Treasures unite and the great elixir has already been refined—can it return to the yellow court to form the embryo.

At that time...

At this moment of embryo-formation, all speak of the qi transformed in earlier stages—only now does the intent of embryo-formation become manifest. Here it is further clarified: one must first refine essence into qi, use qi to assist spirit, and employ spirit to govern the embryo; only when breath coalesces to form the embryo does true fetal breathing arise. Thereafter, fetal breathing nurtures the embryo-spirit, allowing spirit and qi to ride the qi of fetal breathing and settle within. When spirit and qi unite with fetal breathing, this is the true work of embryo-refinement in Daoist practice—only then can the true embryo take form and true samādhi be attained. Without this qi, the body cannot become indestructible as vajra. In life, there would only be dullness and drowsiness—how could one maintain constant awareness, constant clarity, and constant mastery of qi to enter great samādhi and complete the embryo? (Any interruption means there is no fetal breathing.)

When qi enters great samādhi, this is the beginning of embryo-formation, just as the *Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: “At the first formation of the embryo, observe your original destiny.” Original destiny refers to the two qi. Original qi is the root of the living body, while the breath-organ is the instrument of the living body. At the outset of embryo-formation, these two qi of original destiny must follow the command of spirit, congealing together within to become true fetal breathing. Thus, over time, without a single breath’s interruption.

Unbroken and seamless, moment after moment—yet not within the embryo itself. The vision of breathlessness, the true yang-spirit’s great samādhi, utterly free from movement and stillness, arising and ceasing: this is the perfection of the embryo, the return to that state when, like the first congealing of qi in the mother’s womb, the self had not yet formed and essence, qi, and spirit remained undivided. This is what the *Mirror of Entering the Elixir* means by “at the final shedding of the embryo, observe the Four Uprights”—a verification of whether the work of the Four Uprights is present or absent. If present, the embryo is not yet perfected, for its presence is still the labor of nurturing the embryo. If absent, it is called the samādhi of extinction, and the yang-spirit is accomplished. The fetal breathing extends and contracts—this is called completion. The work of the ten-month barrier is finished, the proof of immortality.

Further practice remains: refining the spirit to return to emptiness in the upper field, thereby attaining the rank of celestial immortal. This must be known, for the spirit is then moved to the upper field and exits through the Heavenly Gate, where the manifestations of the yang-spirit flicker in and out. Why? During the preceding ten months, if there is any premature emergence, it is an untimely exit, caused by the six roots falling into demonic illusion. The demon is the yin-demon, the unexhausted yin-qi. A reckless exit scatters the spirit into demonic realms, and the breath escapes through the mouth and nose. One must swiftly re-enter, relying on the breath to return to the embryo. This passage offers repeated, detailed instruction on the dangers to guard against during the ten months.

At this stage, emergence is timely. In the past, Lan Yangsu completed the embryo but did not know how to emerge, so Liu Haichan sent him a letter revealing the secret of spirit-exit. Thus, with a single thought of emergence, the yang-spirit exits through the Heavenly Gate. The Heavenly Gate is the “crown gate” mentioned in the *Anthology of Transmitting the Dao*—(the ancients praised this as “a body beyond the body”). If the exit is prolonged, there is a risk of the spirit becoming lost or deluded.

Here is the translation:

---

The ancient saying, "At ten steps, a hundred steps, one must carefully attend to this," refers precisely to this stage. Thus, one immediately enters the Upper Field, abiding in the realm of emptiness and quiescence. As the spirit has just emerged from the embryo, it is like an infant newly born, requiring three years of nursing. Nursing here means nurturing through quiescent absorption. It is also said that for nine years, or three years of uninterrupted absorption, one emerges from quiescence only at the outset before re-entering, thereby perfecting the celestial immortal who returns to emptiness. To realize utmost emptiness and nothingness is to realize the celestial immortal. Yet at this time, the duration of absorption is long, while the time spent outside it is brief. One must emerge frequently and swiftly return. Therefore, I say: the moment of emerging from absorption is the very beginning of re-entering it. Even after attaining the celestial immortal, there is never a time without absorption. This is akin to the wondrous realm beyond immortals and buddhas, where there is neither immortal nor buddha—the ultimate attainment of celestial immortals and buddhas. Later sages and perfected beings all know and realize this.

This manuscript was completed in the *renxu* year of the Tianqi era, intended to be preserved for disciples. Yet it is not out of a mind solely devoted to self-cultivation, excluding others, nor does it lack the intent to share goodness universally. Thus, this annotated collection is transmitted for posterity. May those in the world who devote themselves to nature and destiny, who focus their minds on the Dao and virtue, encounter a teacher by karmic affinity and receive oral instructions. With this text as verification, they will naturally awaken and enter, like clouds parting to reveal the bright moon, or dust settling to reveal a clear mirror—encompassing all illusions to return to truth, uniting the myriad methods into one. The Three Primes circulate within, and the spirit naturally ascends to the origin. Following this path with unwavering dedication, one rides the white clouds back to the native land—this is where it truly begins.
