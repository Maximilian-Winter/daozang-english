The *Hundred-Character Stele* by Lü Dongbin

Nurture qi, forget words, and guard;
Subdue the heart to act as non-acting.
In movement and stillness, know the ancestral source—
With no affairs, whom else would you seek?

The true and constant must respond to things,
Yet in response, take care not to stray.
Not straying, the nature abides of itself;
Nature abiding, qi returns of itself.

Qi returning, the elixir forms itself;
Within the crucible, Kan and Li unite.
Yin and yang arise in cyclic return—
A single thunder roars through universal transformation.

White clouds gather at the summit’s peak,
Sweet dew sprinkles Mount Sumeru.
Drinking the wine of immortality alone,
Who knows of this carefree wandering?

Seated, listening to the stringless melody,
Illumined, one fathoms the mechanism of creation.
These twenty verses in all—
Truly, they are the ladder to heaven.
