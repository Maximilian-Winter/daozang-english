**Preface**

*The Record of Seated Blossoms and Ripe Fruits* is a work by my friend, Wang Diaosheng. Diaosheng, a renowned scholar of western Zhejiang, followed his official post to Jiangzuo, repeatedly serving as a key aide in prominent yamen, his reputation resounding throughout the literary world. He took what he had absorbed in daily life and committed it to writing. Those unfamiliar with Diaosheng may be daunted by the breadth of his observations, deeming the book a mere source of witty tales to provoke laughter. Yet those who know him say: “This is Diaosheng’s苦心 to save the world, using his pen as his tongue. Even the morning bell that awakens from dreams or the precious raft that guides through the ford of delusion cannot surpass it.”

Since the *Nine Hundred Tales* of Yu Chu, fiction from the Han and Wei dynasties onward has favored extravagant and fantastical words, with narratives spun from trivial matters and reckless speech proliferating daily. Such works, like the frivolous banquets of *Fuxiu* or the absurd tales of *Qi Xie*, are shallow and lack substance, wild yet without foundation. Even when compiled into volumes, they do little to edify the world. Song scholars, by contrast, excelled in chronicling dynastic affairs, court rituals, and the deeds of the past, often serving as sources for historians.

In our present dynasty, *Strange Tales from Liaozhai* by Pu Liuxian has been widely emulated. Its brushwork rivals that of Sima Qian and Ban Gu, showcasing the utmost skill of a literary master. Yet half of its accounts involve ghosts and foxes, while the rest are interspersed with playful anecdotes, leaving discerning readers with some regret. During the Qianlong era, the eminent scholar Ji Xiaolan of Hejian, endowed with vast and refined talent, compiled the *Siku Quanshu* catalog. In his spare time, he produced *Luanyang’s Summer Records*, *Thus Have I Heard*, and *Huai Xi’s Miscellany*, which circulated widely across the land. His works, though meticulous in textual research and argumentation, are accessible only to those deeply learned and thoughtful. By contrast, *baiguan* novels—from scholars to farmers and merchants—are universally read with delight. Thus, embedding moral lessons within their narratives ensures their easy dissemination and reception. Truly, the morning bell that awakens from dreams and the precious raft that guides through delusion find their embodiment in Xiaolan.

Now, Diaosheng, possessing refined talent, aspired to advance through imperial examinations but repeatedly stumbled at the gates of the examination hall, his ambitions thwarted. With no alternative, he entered officialdom as a minor clerk. The lament of talented men serving as petty officials is a sorrow shared across the ages. This book’s narratives are concise and elegant, its judgments deliberate. Moreover, it adheres to factual accuracy, verifying details through extensive inquiry, avoiding baseless fabrications or repetitive clichés. Whether it rivals Xiaolan’s work, I dare not say. Yet its苦心 to save the world only deepens my admiration for Diaosheng.

Recently, Diaosheng has resided in my hometown, and our interactions have grown closer, our bond deeper. Entrusted with the task of proofreading, I, despite my humble abilities, offer this preface.

*Written in the fourth month of summer, the year Ding Si of the Xianfeng reign, by Jing Lvji of Danyang.*

**Phonetic and Explanatory Notes on the Preface to *The Record of Seated Blossoms and Ripe Fruits***

*The Record of Seated Blossoms and Ripe Fruits* presents a tapestry of karmic retribution, blending exhortation and admonition—truly a virtuous work. Yet it has long lacked phonetic annotations, much to the regret of its readers. I wished to provide them but hesitated due to my own inadequacies. Perhaps, given the vastness of the world, there are like-minded individuals who might undertake this task. For now, I can only wait.

In the year *Wu Yin*, while residing in Shanghai, I gathered with fellow scholars to pool resources for printing virtuous books. Among them was a volume I had long wished to annotate: *The Record of Seated Blossoms and Ripe Fruits*. Earlier, Mr. Hu Mengxiang had also been a guest here. In his spare time from studies, he took up this book and provided phonetic and explanatory notes. Morning and evening, he researched and verified, completing the task over two seasons. His苦心 is evident. Moreover, he chose not to reveal his name, attributing the work to the “Woodcutter of Vulture Peak,” a choice that further demonstrates his noble intent.

From this, we see that the reservoir of goodness throughout history remains ever-present in the world. I dare not claim Mr. Hu’s heart mirrors my own. Yet his love for virtue aligns with my long-held, unfulfilled aspiration—what fortune it is to find such resonance! Now, Mr. Hu has suddenly passed away, unable to witness the completion of this book. Truly, this is a great pity. As for the precision of his research and the accuracy of his philological explanations, they are evident to all who read them—what more need be said?

*Written in the third month of spring, the year Wu Yin of the Guangxu reign, by the Master of Wenzhu Studio in Shanghai.*

---

*The Record of Seated Blossoms and Ripe Fruits* is the work of Mr. Wang of Renhe, who, with the extraordinary talent of a blind left eye, chronicled the true events of the Xianfeng and Daoguang eras. He vividly depicted what he had seen and heard in daily life, rendering scenes with such clarity that they seem to unfold before the reader. How could this be merely a rigid exercise in promoting virtue?

Yet in its meticulous recounting of events, the principle that "goodness leads to prosperity, while evil brings ruin" is made manifest without the slightest deviation. Those who read this book may first find it strange and take delight in it, but soon recognize its truth and feel a chill of fear. Its power to uphold the moral order and transform human hearts operates invisibly yet irresistibly, turning the course of things beyond all bounds.

From ancient times to the present, sacred scriptures, worthy biographies, and books of admonition and encouragement have filled countless chests and boxes. Yet though their solemn pronouncements and earnest exhortations are more than sufficient to strike deep fear into the heart, over time they become mere objects of idle curiosity. Some dismiss them as distant and irrelevant, others as stale and hackneyed, and most consign them to the highest shelves, never to be opened again. For the more urgent the admonition, the greater the aversion it breeds; the stricter the supervision, the more vehement the resistance.

This book alone, with its fresh and striking approach, invites eager circulation, while its vivid accounts of karmic retribution awaken the innate goodness of human nature and sever the roots of selfish desire. Its subtle yet profound transformative power defies full description. In its artful use of indirect remonstrance, Mr. Wang’s craftsmanship is truly masterful, and his intentions deeply earnest.

We, his peers, all recognize the great significance of this book for the moral order and the human heart, and thus hasten to entrust it to the printers, that it may be transmitted for generations to come.

*Respectfully inscribed by fellow scholars in the twelfth lunar month of the year Ji Chou, the fifteenth year of the Guangxu reign.*

**General Principles**
1. This book records only events of admonition and encouragement from the past thirty years, as witnessed or heard by the author. Matters from more distant times, already documented by earlier worthies, are not redundantly included, to avoid the charge of plagiarism or mere repetition.
2. This book aims to be accessible to both the refined and the common, intelligible even to women and children. Thus, the prose is deliberately detailed and clear, neither overly concise at the risk of obscurity nor excessively novel at the expense of authenticity.
3. As karma demands that one’s deeds be recounted in person, and as the ancient teaching of concealing faults while praising virtue remains luminous, this compilation records the full names and native places of those whose good deeds merit inclusion, provided they can be verified. For evil deeds, only the events are described, without naming the individuals, so that filial descendants need not sigh in shame while reading.
4. All events in this compilation are based on factual evidence; none are fabricated or follow the fantastical style of the *Qi Xie* or *Zhi Guai*. However, as many accounts derive from friends’ and acquaintances’ retellings, discrepancies may arise. Should any inconsistencies be found, we humbly ask knowledgeable readers for their forbearance.

**Notes on Pronunciation and Exegesis**
1. The annotations in this book aim to ensure its wide circulation. Wherever a phrase or character might pose difficulty, explanations are provided in detail, so that even those with only basic literacy may grasp the meaning with ease.
2. For citations from various sources, if the full context is necessary for clarity, only the title and passage are noted. If the citation is a well-known phrase, only its source is indicated, for the sake of simplicity.
3. For citations whose origins cannot be immediately traced, the phrase is marked “source unknown,” followed by a tentative explanation based on the compiler’s understanding. If the meaning remains obscure, it is left unannotated, awaiting the insights of learned scholars.
4. If a citation has been fully annotated in a previous section, later references simply note “see annotation in [section name].”
5. Characters requiring phonetic or semantic clarification are annotated in every section where they appear. No omissions are made on the grounds that a character has been annotated earlier, so that readers may understand the text even when consulting it at random. However, if a character appears multiple times within the same section, its annotation is not repeated.
6. In annotating difficult characters, earlier works of exegesis (such as the *Tang Yun*, *Ji Yun*, *Zheng Yun*, and *Yun Hui*) are followed strictly, without substituting homophonous characters. For example, the character 嗫 in 嗫嚅 is glossed as 日涉切 in the *Ji Yun*, and here we retain the pronunciation of ; the character 魇 in 梦魇 is glossed as 幺琰切 in the *Yun Hui*, and here we retain the pronunciation of . Yet such annotations may still prove cumbersome for readers. Thus, in such cases, we replace them with more familiar characters to better serve the original intent of the annotations.
7. For difficult characters in the level tone where no common equivalent exists, a character from the rising, departing, or entering tones with a similar pronunciation is chosen, following the rules of *xieyun* (rime-matching). Though not all readers may distinguish the four tones, and some may still read a rising-tone character as level or an entering-tone character as departing, the pronunciation remains sufficiently close to avoid gross error—far preferable to glossing a difficult character with another difficult one.
8. Book titles, original texts, and difficult characters within original annotations are not further glossed. Explanatory notes likewise avoid difficult characters wherever possible.

**Case in Point: Filial Son He**
*Filial piety stands foremost among virtues—its rewards are no lie,*
*Else how could such a paragon of manhood arise?*

Wealth and nobility—both are decreed by Heaven’s dispensation;
Yet how much more joy when the art does not betray the Green Crow’s lore.

A certain scholar from Jiangyou (that is, Jiangxi) was skilled in the Green Crow’s art (the *Baopuzi* records the Yellow Emperor’s *Book of Earth-Inspection* under the name of Green Crow. *Note:* Green Crow was a disciple of Peng Zu. *Observation:* As Green Crow excelled in earth-inspection, the craft came to be called the Green Crow’s art). While traveling as a guest in Daozhou of Chu (Hunan, in the southern reaches of Chu), he found a propitious site. As he stood gazing and looking up, two men approached—one clad in resplendent robes, the other holding a luopan compass and scanning left and right, declaring, “This site is inauspicious.” The scholar secretly scoffed at his presumption and hastened to speak with them, each inquiring of the other’s homeland and clan (to inquire: *xún*, rising tone, meaning “to ask.” *Mutual inquiry* refers to both parties questioning one another. *Homeland* denotes one’s native place; *clan*, one’s surname). The finely dressed man was the son of a wealthy family in the city; the one with the compass, a geomancer. Hearing the scholar was from Jiangyou, the geomancer said, “Jiangxi abounds with renowned *kanyu* masters (the *Yiwen Zhi* of the *Former Han History* records *Kanyu Jindu* in fourteen scrolls. *Kan* pertains to the Way of Heaven; *yu*, to the Way of Earth. *Observation:* Those versed in fengshui are called *kanyu* masters, deriving from this). You must be most accomplished.” The scholar demurred modestly while subtly displaying his art (to display: *xuàn*, *hùxiàn* cut, *xuán*, departing tone. *Subtly displaying* means to reveal slightly). The geomancer was deeply impressed and, addressing the wealthy man’s son, invited the scholar to return with them. The scholar lodged as a guest in their home (as recorded in the *Song History: Biography of Ding Wei*: “The host should not speak further”).

The scholar, having lodged as a guest in their home (as the term *jūtíng* denotes residing in another’s household), was about to reveal the auspicious site to them when he silently reflected: “This land cannot be borne save by one of great virtue and power.” After some time, observing that their conduct and principles were not those of one destined for such fortune, he kept the matter secret.

It so happened that the wealthy family’s relative, Squire Xiao, wished to inter his parent and sought a geomancer through the family’s connections. The scholar accepted the invitation and went. Squire Xiao was a true elder (as recorded in the *Records of the Grand Historian: Annals of Xiang Yu*: “Chen Ying was ever trustworthy and prudent, known as an elder.” *Elder* here denotes one of loyalty and generosity), delighting in charity and regarded by his village as a virtuous man. The scholar thought, “This man may well be worthy of the site,” and fully disclosed it to him. Squire Xiao acquired it at a high price, and the scholar marked the burial spot and opened the grave pit.

When the day of interment arrived, the scholar said to Squire Xiao, “This land cannot bear one without profound virtue. Though you are indeed an elder, the will of Heaven remains unknowable. To defy it would invite great misfortune. You ought to spend the night in the grave pit to divine its suitability—if this is not your destined land, there will be an ominous sign.” The squire followed his advice.

That night, the squire took his son and lodged together in the grave pit, covering themselves with a reed mat. At midnight, they heard the sound of *he-dian* (the shouts of attendants clearing the way). Peering through a gap in the reeds, they saw an escort of ceremonial guards—banners, weapons, and retainers—ushering forward a towering man on horseback. The squire thought to himself, “How could a man of high rank pass through these wild mountains at such an hour?” Just as his confusion peaked, the rider reined in his horse beside the pit and rebuked his retinue: “Whose filial son’s burial ground is this? How dare Xiao presume to seize it? Seize him at once and cast him out!” Trembling, the squire kowtowed within the pit and cried aloud, “I feared this site was not my due and might incur Heaven’s punishment, so I spent the night here to divine its fate. Now that you have deigned to instruct me, I shall at once relinquish it.” Then they heard the man on horseback say, “In consideration of your long-standing virtue, I shall pardon you. If you are willing to bury this filial son’s parent here, I shall grant you another auspicious site in its stead.”

The rider added, “This grave must be sealed at once—do not let the qi escape.” With these words, he vanished like the wind or a flash of lightning, and in the blink of an eye, all fell silent. At daybreak, father and son returned home and told the scholar what had transpired. They sealed the grave and together sought out the filial son, but none could identify him. One day, the scholar wandered alone beyond the city. Having ventured some distance, he reached a market town just as a sudden downpour forced him to take shelter beneath the eaves of a rice shop. As dusk approached, the huskers had all ceased their work, save for one young man who lingered. Struck by this, the scholar inquired, and the youth, still pounding the grain, replied, “My mother is old and will not eat unless there is meat. I rise early and rest late so I may earn more husking wages to provide for her.”

The scholar asked his surname, and the youth replied, "He." The scholar thought to himself, *Could this be the filial son named He?* He wished to observe whether the young man truly treated his mother with devotion. Waiting until the youth finished his husking, he claimed the rain had made the road too long and requested lodging for the night. He agreed.

The scholar took out five silver coins and handed them to He, saying, "Prepare an evening meal for me." He was astonished and said, "The cost of a single meal—why so much money?" The scholar replied, "If there is any left over, use it to provide for your mother’s table." He refused, saying, "I do my utmost to serve my mother, and that brings me peace. To accept so much from a guest without earning it would be wrong." He insisted on taking only one coin, with which he purchased wine and dried meat for his guest.

Returning together to his home, the house consisted of only two bays. Within was his mother’s chamber; He and his wife dwelt outside, partitioning the front half for the hearth. Though cramped and low-lying, it was kept quite clean. He entered first to inform his mother of the guest seeking lodging. She promptly called for his wife to brew tea and cautioned her not to slight the visitor. He soon returned, ushering the scholar inside, saying, “This poor home has no spare room. I have already instructed my wife to sleep with my mother, so you and I must share a bed—pray do not mind the intimacy.”

Once seated, he again went to fetch tea, then brought out a single dish of wine and one of food, setting them on the table with the words, “Forgive me for not keeping you company.” He then hurried inside. The scholar peered through the door’s gap and saw on the table two bowls, each with its own spoon and chopsticks. He and his wife together helped their mother to her proper place. As the mother ate, the couple attended her on either side, stirring the broth and offering meat, their faces suffused with gentle contentment. When she had eaten her fill, the wife cleared the dishes, and He personally assisted his mother in washing her hands. Only then did they sit down to eat themselves, their meal consisting of nothing more than a small portion of pickled greens.

The scholar ate while watching through the gap, his admiration growing ever deeper. Before long, He emerged to find his guest had finished his meal, then brought tea once more, saying to the scholar, “The bedding and pillow are all prepared. You have traveled far and must be weary—please retire first and do not wait for me.” The scholar nodded in assent. He then went back inside, and the scholar again peered in. He saw He sitting beside his mother, recounting in detail the vulgar and commonplace happenings of the streets and markets to amuse her, her expression full of delight. Soon, she began to yawn and stretch, showing signs of fatigue, so he personally helped her settle onto the pillow, smoothed the mat, and assisted her in removing her outer garments before she relieved herself. His wife stood by her side, her own face showing not the slightest weariness.

When his mother had fallen asleep, He proceeded to knead and massage her—gently striking her back and legs, then soothing the places that ached or itched. Only when he heard her breathing deepen did he rise, stepping as lightly as if afraid to wake her. The scholar, moved by such sincere filial devotion, recalled the immortal’s words had not been false.

Once He emerged, the scholar asked how many years had passed since his father’s death and whether he had been interred. He replied in tears, “It has been four years. This unworthy son, working as a laborer to support my mother, has had no means to arrange a proper burial. To this day, his remains lie in temporary shelter at the village shrine—just speaking of it breaks my heart.” Seeing him overcome with grief, the scholar consoled him, “Do not grieve. My host, Old Man Xiao, owns a small plot of auspicious land, which I shall beg on your behalf. I will also contribute toward your burial expenses.”

He exclaimed in astonishment, “I have never met you before, sir—how could I presume upon such generosity? Moreover, since the land already has an owner, even if you take pity on me, I fear your words will be of no avail.” The scholar replied, “Have no concern. I have long known Old Man Xiao to be magnanimous and fond of bestowing kindness, delighting in bringing others’ good deeds to fruition. When he hears of your filial devotion, he will surely consent. Three days hence, do not go out. I shall come with him.” He wept in gratitude, saying, “If your words prove true, I shall be indebted to your great virtue for the rest of my days.” The scholar once more offered him comfort.

That night, they retired to rest. Before dawn, the scholar awoke to find He gone without a trace. When morning came, he saw him returning from outside with a bowl in hand. Upon inquiry, he learned that his mother had craved sweet dumplings in broth, so he had set out for the city at the fourth watch, making a forty-li round trip. The scholar’s admiration deepened.

Upon returning home, he told Old Man Xiao, who rejoiced, saying, “The immortal’s decree has come to pass! Now that we have found such a man, how could I dare be stingy?” Three days later, they set out together, bearing the land deed. As they neared the door, they heard He and his wife wailing in bitter grief. Startled, they entered to ask what had happened. They learned that after the scholar’s departure, He’s mother had suddenly fallen ill with an epidemic disease. With no means to secure medicine, she had died abruptly the previous evening. Seeing his guests arrive, He struck his head against the ground in anguish, weeping uncontrollably. Moved by compassion, Old Man Xiao provided funds for her coffin and burial, then presented him with the land deed.

The scholar selected an auspicious day for the burial, covering all expenses himself. After the interment, He and his wife came together to express their gratitude and offered to work as servants to repay the value of the land. Old Man Xiao, astonished, said, “Your filial piety has moved Heaven, and you have received divine protection. How could I dare claim credit for Heaven’s work?” He then recounted the earlier events and added, “You are a filial son—how could I seek your friendship and fail, yet presume to reduce you to servitude? My home has many vacant rooms. If you do not disdain them, why not bring your family to live with us? I will ensure you need not worry about daily provisions.” He declined, insisting he was unworthy, but Old Man Xiao firmly insisted, and so He remained in his household, overseeing its accounts and comings and goings.

A month later, Old Man Xiao said to the scholar, “At first, the immortal promised me that after the filial son buried his parent, he would grant me an auspicious site. Now his words are about to be fulfilled—why not seek it?” The scholar replied, “Very well. I am no geomancer who feigns skill for a living. Were it not for the unfinished matter with you, why would I linger in a foreign land? Since the immortal has already promised you, there must be an auspicious site. Yet none has met my expectations thus far. I ask that you grant me more time.” From then on, he daily roamed the fields, valleys, and mountains, searching for burial caves and dragon veins, but found nothing. After more than a month of this, his body and spirit were utterly exhausted.

One day, as he passed by He’s grave, he lingered, gazing into the distance, when suddenly he glimpsed a dragon vein faintly emerging several *zhang* away. Following its trace, he discovered a true dragon vein, for it shared the same source as He’s grave. After careful examination, he saw that while its nobility was slightly inferior, its wealth could reach a million. He reported this to Old Man Xiao, who purchased the land, and the scholar selected an auspicious day for the burial.

Once the matter was concluded, the scholar prepared to return home. Old Man Xiao offered him a thousand gold pieces in gratitude, but the scholar firmly declined, saying, “I told you before that I am no geomancer seeking a livelihood. I ask that you keep this to aid the poor.” Unable to refuse further, Old Man Xiao arranged a farewell feast with music. He and his wife also came, prostrating themselves in tearful gratitude.

The scholar returned home and promptly passed the imperial examinations, becoming a *jinshi*. After Old Man Xiao buried his parent, his family’s fortunes rose daily, growing so prosperous that they became the wealthiest in the prefecture. Before long, his son entered the Hanlin Academy as a *jinshi* and later rose to the rank of *Fangbo*. As for the filial son’s grandson, He Wen’an, Lord Linghan, he placed third in the *yichou* imperial examination and served as *Dazongbo*, earning renown as a Neo-Confucian statesman of his time. His son, Shaoji, again topped the provincial examination in the *yiwei* year, passed the metropolitan examination, and entered the Hanlin Academy, repeatedly holding positions overseeing literary affairs. The prosperity and eminence of both families showed no sign of abating.

The Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers remarked: “Filial piety stands first among the Five Constants and is the wellspring of all conduct. When He the Filial Son was mingled among hired laborers—no extraordinary talent or uncommon integrity to stir the world’s notice—yet Heaven and Earth protected him, spirits revered him; in the end his gate and courtyard shone with splendor, blessings flowing to his descendants. How wondrously swift and divine is the response to the power of filial devotion! This scholar valued righteousness over profit, and Old Man Xiao was sincere, kind-hearted, and delighted in goodness—rightly did both receive abundant fortune!”

Two Affairs of the Venerable Father Wan Yanzhai
*He scorned reward-silver and the theft of fame,*
*Yet cherished kin with all a man’s true feeling.*
*Who aids the needy while his wife stays meek—*
*Such is the Way the azure vault refines.*

**I**
In Yangxian, the Venerable Father of Provincial Governor Wan Limen—Master Yanzhai—was a *xiucai* in his youth. Though his family was very poor, he was upright and never took what was not his, yet bold in doing what was right. When others faced urgent hardship, he would go to great lengths to aid and comfort them, even if it meant sullying his own reputation. Once, while serving as a private tutor in the countryside, he set out on foot at year’s end to return home. Midway, he encountered a middle-aged woman walking and weeping. Struck by her distress, he asked what was wrong, but she remained silent. Pressing her, she snapped: “Wayfarers each have their own cares—why trouble strangers with endless talk?” Seeing her words sharp but her expression sorrowful, he reassured her: “I do not ask idly. If you are in dire straits, tell me; perhaps I can help.” The woman then said: “My husband is the village headman. He has fallen short of thirty-odd taels of official silver, and now lies imprisoned, daily subjected to the rod and cudgel as they demand repayment.”

Upon visiting her husband, he told her he was exhausted from the beat

After walking several paces, he turned back and said to her, "Come early tomorrow—do not delay yourself." The woman, weeping, replied, "Yes." Then she took the silver and left. When the gentleman returned home, breakfast was not yet prepared. His wife asked for the payment to buy rice, but he hesitated, stammering, "I’ve wasted a year’s hard work. The mountain paths were treacherous, and I nearly fell several times—how could I have kept hold of the silver pouch?" His wife, knowing his habit of aiding those in distress, smiled faintly and said, "If you truly lost it in a fall, it might still be found. I fear you’ve once again played the fool who jumps into the well to save another!" The gentleman replied, "Indeed."

Still short of the sum, what was to be done?" He told her the truth, and his wife, ever virtuous and kind, uttered no word of reproach. Instead, she encouraged him, saying, "This is a great and good deed. Yet the year is nearly over, and where are we to find twenty taels of silver? Still, since you have already promised, you cannot turn back now. We can pawn our household goods to get through the New Year—go quickly and see to her needs, and do not worry about us here at home!" The gentleman left in high spirits, borrowing from relatives and friends to raise over ten taels, though still short of the amount.

In the town there was a usurer who lent money only against collateral, refusing even close kin a single coin without it. With the matter now urgent and no other recourse, he realized that in his haste there was little of value left to pledge. As the keeper of the ancestral hall’s keys, he took the tables, chairs, doors, and windows from the shrine and pawned them to the usurer for ten taels. Under cover of night, he had them carried to the man’s house. None of the clansmen knew of this. The next day, he took the silver to the woman, who had already arrived at the appointed place.

He handed the silver to her and hurried home, but the woman secretly followed him. She saw the gentleman speaking with someone. Upon inquiring, she learned his name and address. Soon after, she arrived at his home with her husband and daughter, bowing deeply to the gentleman and his wife in gratitude. They begged to leave their daughter as a servant, but the gentleman, seeing the girl was not yet ten years old and quite lovely, said to them: "This is a fine girl—she should be matched with a good husband. Take her home quickly, lest you lead others into wrongdoing." He firmly refused their offer, and they left after repeated bows.

When the clansmen entered the ancestral hall on New Year’s Day to offer sacrifices, they found it utterly empty. All were shocked, suspecting theft. The old man hastily explained to the assembly: "At year’s end, with no funds, I temporarily pawned these things for money. I beg you to wait until I receive my salary to redeem them." The clansmen were furious and all rose to reproach him.

The gentleman remained silent, offering no defense—his face showed neither shame nor anger. At that moment, an elder clansman, who had long known the gentleman to be a man of integrity and one who aided others in distress, suspected there must be another reason. He urged the assembly to return home for the time being and reconvene in three days, and so the crowd dispersed. The elder alone visited the gentleman’s home and discreetly questioned his wife. Upon learning the truth, he rejoiced and said, “This is also a great act of kindness. He will surely pass the examinations this autumn. Yet for having taken the ancestral hall’s items without permission, he must not go unpunished, lest others follow his example.”

He then gathered the clansmen and revealed the reason for the pawning. He declared, “It is fitting that he be temporarily expelled from the ancestral hall. The autumn examinations draw near.”

awaiting the golden announcement of his success, whereupon he would be permitted to rejoin. The assembly assented.

The gentleman remained untroubled, giving no thought to the matter. That autumn, he indeed passed the examinations and returned home to preside over the *Deer Cry Banquet*. The clan elder hosted a feast in celebration. Later, he was appointed principal of Tongzhou Academy. He fathered two sons, the younger of whom became Prefect Li of Lizhou. People regarded this as the reward for his kindness in aiding others in distress.

**II**

After passing the provincial examination, Master Wan Yanzhai set out for the capital with his fellow candidates. They arrived at a certain county in Shandong.

Master Wan remained resolute. "To abandon a sick man in an inn without anyone to attend to his medicine is to hasten his death," he declared. "This journey of mine is merely to accompany the provincial candidates to the capital—my sole purpose is to gaze upon the imperial city, not to pursue fame or rank. You may all proceed; I shall stay and await his recovery."

When Lu heard this, he grew uneasy and urged Master Wan to go with the others, but Wan stood firm. Alone, he sought out physicians, prepared decoctions, and kept vigil morning and evening for twenty days. Yet Lu’s illness proved fatal. As he lay dying, he clasped Wan’s hand and said, "Though we hail from the same village, we were never close. Yet your kindness to me surpasses the depths of the sea. This life is at its end, but if there is rebirth, I shall beg the underworld judges to let me be your son, that I may repay this great debt." With these words, he passed away.

By then, the two had exhausted their travel funds. Wan pawned his robes and furs to pay for the funeral, then considered Lu’s impoverished family and young children. If he did not take this opportunity to escort the coffin home, he feared it might never return. So he left the coffin at the inn and set out on foot, begging for food as he made his way to the capital. When he finally reached the lodgings of his fellow candidates, the examination period had already ended. They were surprised by his tardiness and, seeing his tattered clothes, worn shoes, and sun-blackened face, took pity on him. Wan recounted all that had transpired since their parting and entreated them to help return Lu’s coffin to his homeland, saying, "I hope you will remember our shared journey to the capital and grant this final act of kindness, that he may rest in his native earth. If his spirit knows, he will surely find a way to repay your generosity."

Moved by his righteousness, the group eagerly opened their purses to assist.

The matter was again discussed in Changzhou Prefecture, and those who had traveled to the capital together with him collected several dozen taels of silver to give to Wan. On the day he departed the capital, he resumed his journey on foot, begging for food as before, and did not recklessly spend a single coin. Upon reaching the inn, he laid out the silver before the coffin and called out to Lu, saying, “Through the kindness of so-and-so, I have received this sum of money, which will allow me to escort you home. If you are aware, why not accompany me on the journey?” He then carried the coffin back with him. Upon arriving home, he still had over ten taels remaining, which he gave to Lu’s wife and children.

Several years later, on a summer day, Wan happened to be strolling along the city wall at dusk with his friends Dai and Zhu, his own home lying just below. Suddenly, they saw a man hurrying along with a fan in hand, entering Wan’s house directly. Dai pointed and said to Wan, “Is that not Lu Yining?” Wan looked and indeed recognized him, forgetting for a moment that he had already died. He called out hastily, but Zhu, who arrived later, heard this and exclaimed in shock, “Lu has been dead for years—how could he come here?” Wan then realized his mistake and looked again carefully. The figure had already entered his gate. He quickly descended the city wall with his two friends to trace his footsteps.

Just as they reached the gate, a servant came out to report that the mistress was about to give birth. Wan hurried home to see her, and the child had already been delivered—his appearance strikingly resembled Lu’s. Only then did Wan suddenly realize that the figure he had seen on the city wall was indeed Lu. For Lu had come to fulfill his vow and be reborn, manifesting his form to demonstrate the unerring nature of cause and effect!

As the child grew, he proved exceptionally intelligent. He soon passed the imperial examinations, entered the Ministry of Rites as an observer, and later became Prefect Lizhen of Lizhou. The *Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers* remarked:

"Only true heroes of surpassing talent can act beyond conventional bounds. How could the deeds of Master Yanzhai be matched by those who cling to petty integrity and cautious restraint? To seek fame is ultimately shameful, yet he felt no disgrace; to attain the honor of *jinshi* is the height of glory, yet he did not rush toward it. Instead, he devoted himself tirelessly to relieving disasters and aiding those in distress—was this not the courage of a truly benevolent man?"

And the Creator, in turn, repaid him according to his measure. Now, the heart of compassion is innate in all, yet世 people often excuse themselves, saying, “My strength is insufficient.” Witnessing the deeds of Master Yanzhai, might they not be stirred to emulation?

**III. Ten Taels for a Life**

*The diviner’s precision, the physiognomist’s marvel—*
*Who knew of the life saved at Jiangjin?*
*The *jieyuan* was but a ghost beneath crumbling walls,*
*For fortune and misfortune have no gate—one invites them oneself.*

A certain eminent scholar in his youth suffered extreme poverty, often going days without kindling a fire. In the year he sat for the provincial examination, a diviner in his village—renowned for his uncanny accuracy—declared that before the White Dew festival, he would die an unnatural death. The scholar was deeply troubled. As the examination date neared, several classmates urged him to join them, but he demurred, citing the diviner’s warning and pleading lack of funds. Among them was a certain Mr. Wang, wealthy and of noble character, who had long been on good terms with the scholar. He insisted on the journey, saying, “Why heed such empty words? If you fear destitution, let me take care of it.” With that, he pressed ten taels of silver into the scholar’s hand: “Use this for your family’s needs. For travel expenses, you may ask freely—I will provide.” Moved by his generosity, the scholar joined the group. They set out several days after the Beginning of Autumn.

Upon reaching Jinling, they heard of a physiognomist at Cheng’en Temple whose judgments were often strangely accurate. His chamber was as crowded as a marketplace. The scholar and his six fellow lodgers went together. The physiognomist surveyed them all: one was a *lin* scholar, another a *zeng*, a *fu*, a *jian*; some enjoyed the blessing of both parents, others mourned their loss—his assessments were unerring in every case.

Among them, only one was said to have a chance at securing a *fujia* position in the current examination, while the rest were all deemed unlikely to pass. When it came to the scholar, the physiognomist first asked which county he hailed from and how far it was from there. Then, counting on his fingers, he exclaimed, “Hurry—you may still make it in time!”

Perplexed, the scholar pressed for an explanation. The physiognomist replied, “Your complexion is withered, your spirit adrift, and dark lines have already appeared on your *tian ting*—by fate, you are to die an unnatural death within five days. You must return at once, though even then, your face bears the marks of a death on the road, and I fear you may not arrive in time.”

Master Wang and the others were stunned. “Sir,” they urged, “please examine him again—might there be some saving grace in his stars?”

The physiognomist shook his head. “Life and death are governed by great destiny; only immense hidden virtue could alter heaven’s decree. The appointed hour is nearly upon him—what can be done? If this gentleman is still alive six days from now, I shall never read fortunes again!”

Silently, the group returned to their lodgings. The scholar turned to Master Wang: “At first, you insisted I come, and now the physiognomist’s words echo those from before—there must be truth to them. Death comes to all; it is not death itself I fear. But to die here would burden you all greatly. I should leave at once, hoping to breathe my last at home.”

The others agreed.

Master Wang, moved by compassion, arranged for a boat and prepared travel provisions. He also gave the scholar ten taels of silver, saying, “Keep this for any urgent needs.” The scholar, understanding his intent, smiled and declined, “You have already helped with my funeral expenses; I dare not refuse. If there is awareness after death, I shall beseech the underworld authorities to grant you high success in the examinations, that I may repay your great kindness.” With that, he bid the others farewell and boarded the vessel.

After sailing more than ten *li* down the river, the wind grew fierce, and the boat could not proceed. They moored and waited idly, like the farmer who abandoned his plow to watch the tree stump. In the blink of an eye, four days passed. The wind raged even more violently, and the scholar thought silently, *The fifth day’s deadline is nearly upon me, yet the boat cannot depart. The physiognomist’s words of dying on the road seem about to come true.* At that moment, his mind was fixed on death, all other concerns dissolved, and only the agony of loneliness remained, with no means of distraction. He disembarked to wander aimlessly along the shore.

After meandering for over a *li*, he saw no sign of human habitation. Suddenly, he noticed a pregnant woman of middle age, carrying three young children—one in her arms, the others clutched in her hands—weeping as she walked, as if overcome with sorrow. They passed each other like arms crossing in opposite directions, and she had already gone several paces ahead when the scholar suddenly thought, *The riverbank is desolate, with no dwellings in sight. Where can this woman be going?* Her appearance struck him as suspicious. He hurried after her, calling out, but she did not respond. He followed at a distance, and when she cursed and insulted him, he pressed her even more earnestly, saying, “If you are in dire straits, I beg you to tell me. Perhaps I can help in some way.”

Unable to refuse, the woman finally confessed: “I was unlucky enough to marry a butcher, a man of violent temper. He beats me constantly, leaving no part of my body unmarked. Today, he went to the market, leaving two pigs at home. He told me, ‘Sell them only for ten taels.’ Soon after, a man came to buy them, and indeed, he offered ten taels. Fearing the silver was counterfeit, we went together to a silversmith to verify its purity, and it proved genuine. When we returned, the buyer suddenly claimed the price was too high and took back his silver. A moment later, he returned, still wishing to exchange the original silver for the pigs. Seeing no difference in the silver, I suspected nothing and gave him the pigs. Then a neighbor from the west came by, saw the silver, and exclaimed in surprise, ‘This is copper!’ I rushed after the man, but he had vanished without a trace. I took the silver to the silversmith again, and it was copper. I went to several other shops, and all confirmed it was copper. Trapped in this swindle, I know my husband will beat me to death when he returns. If death is inevitable, better to die in the water than by his whip. These three children are my own; I will take them with me to drown, so they will not suffer their father’s abuse.”

The scholar, moved by her plight, summoned the copper and examined it—indeed, it was copper. Just then, the gold Wang had given him happened to be in his sleeve. Thinking of his impending death, he mused, *What use is gold to me now?* So he secretly exchanged it for the copper and said to the woman, “You nearly died in vain. This is true silver—why call it copper?”

The woman flared with anger. “Every silversmith I went to said it was copper! Why would you deceive me?”

“Not so!” he replied. “Those silversmiths took advantage of you as a woman. Come with me, and they will not dare call it copper again. If it is truly copper, you may still choose death later.”

She followed his advice, and together they walked three or four *li* before reaching the silversmith’s shop. The scholar produced the silver, and the smith declared it genuine. They visited several more shops, and all confirmed it was silver. Overjoyed, the woman exclaimed, “Fortune favored me in meeting you, or I would have perished in error!” She took the silver, bowed in gratitude, and departed.

The scholar hurried back to his boat, but by then the sun had set, and dusk had deepened into twilight. Before he had gone a *li*, he lost his way, with no one to ask for directions. As he wandered hesitantly, he suddenly saw a cluster of buildings ahead. Drawing nearer, he saw crumbling doors and ruined walls—it was an abandoned temple. With no other choice, he sheltered beneath its eaves to await dawn.

As he sat in the desolate night, he thought, *If a fox spirit or ghost should seize me, this will be my deathbed.* Yet exhaustion overtook him, and he soon fell asleep. In his half-dreaming state, he heard voices shouting to clear the way. Looking up, he saw the temple hall ablaze with light, attendants standing in solemn rows, and a king seated at a table—dimly, he recognized the figure as Lord Guan. Suddenly, he heard the deity say, “Today, by the river, someone saved five lives. We must examine this person and grant them due reward.”

A purple-robed official stepped forward, holding a document. “The local earth god has just reported: it was a scholar from such-and-such a county.”

Lord Guan ordered the register of fortunes checked, along with the autumn examination roster. Another official in embroidered robes presented a ledger. “This man’s fate is spent; he is destined to die tonight at the hour of *zi*, crushed beneath the temple’s collapsing wall.”

“How can we encourage goodness if this is so?” the deity mused. “His fate must be rewritten. Yesterday, the Wenchang Palace informed us that the *jieyuan* of this year’s Jiangnan examinations was stripped of his title for defiling a maiden. Let this scholar take his place.”

Someone else spoke: “The gold he used came from Wang, who gave it freely in righteousness. Since this act allowed the scholar to achieve merit, we should trace its source and record Wang as well.”

“Well said,” Lord Guan replied. He ordered the ledger checked: Wang was to rank fifty-third in the middle-level examinations of a future year. The embroidered-robed official stepped forward. “The current fifty-third candidate is to be penalized for slander and deferred for one examination. The replacement has not yet been decided by the Wenchang Palace. Let Wang take his place.”

As the scholar listened intently, a sudden shout near his ear cried, *“Go! Go!”* Startled awake, he found himself still crouched beneath the eaves. All around was darkness, nothing to be seen—only the sound of crumbling plaster pattering from the wall. He staggered to his feet and fled.

Just as he hurried out, the wall suddenly collapsed, crashing down precisely where he had been sitting. Thus, he stood upright and waited until dawn. When day broke, he ascended the hall to gaze upward—sure enough, it was the Temple of Lord Guan. He bowed in reverence and departed, then sought his way back to the boat. Silently pondering the deity’s words, he felt certain they would prove true. He consulted the boatman and returned to Jinling. With a fair wind filling the sails, they arrived in no time.

Upon reaching his lodging, the others were astonished to see him. The senior scholar merely explained that the wind had prevented their journey, and since the five-day deadline had passed, he had returned. The group asked, “Did you encounter any ill omens during those five days?” The senior scholar fabricated a reason: “There was an incident. Yesterday, I strolled along the riverbank and wandered too far from the boat. By the time I returned, dusk had fallen. The reeds grew thick and tangled, and I stumbled twice, nearly falling into the river. Fortunately, the boatman came with a lantern to search for me, and I made it back—but the silver pouch in my sleeve had vanished, as if turned into *qingfu* and flown away!”

Wang laughed and said, “To escape great peril is to be destined for great fortune. Stumbling along the riverbank—could this be an omen of passing the imperial examination?”

“As we had prepared wine to celebrate, the next day, all those lodging with us remarked that seven days had passed and you remained unharmed—why not go and mock the physiognomer for his falsehoods?” The senior scholar was reluctant, but the group insisted, and so they went. Upon arrival, they found the physiognomer seated amidst a bustling crowd. Pushing through, they brought the senior scholar to stand before him. The physiognomer was in the midst of animated discourse when he lifted his gaze, saw the senior scholar, and exclaimed in surprise, “Are you not the one I said would die within five days?” The group answered in unison, “Indeed. Now seven days have passed—what say you to that?” The physiognomer replied, “You will not die now. In just these few days, your bone structure has transformed entirely, and your complexion has improved remarkably. You must have performed some extraordinary act of kindness, saving several lives—thus altering your fate.” The senior scholar laughed and said, “How absurd, sir! With my poverty, how could I save anyone?” The physiognomer replied, “Do not deceive me. I had previously said that only a great act of hidden virtue could reverse heaven’s decree. Now, your face bears the marks of profound *yin zhi*. This year, you will surely top the imperial examination; next year, you will pass the palace exam and enter the Hanlin Academy. You will rise to the rank of first-grade official and live eighty years more.” He added with a smile, “This is no coincidence. Half a month ago, I read the face of a scholar, whose *mingtang* shone with extraordinary brilliance, and I declared him certain to be this year’s top candidate. But when I saw him again yesterday, a *suspended needle* had appeared on his forehead—his radiance had vanished entirely. He must have committed some grave transgression, forfeiting his place in the register of fortune. Unexpectedly, you have taken his place.” Then, pointing to Wang, he said, “Your face also bears the marks of *yin zhi*—you will pass the examination alongside this gentleman.” Wang laughed and said, “I know nothing of my friend’s deeds, but as for myself—what good have I done?” The physiognomer replied, “It is precisely because you act without seeking reward that it is called *yin zhi*.” The crowd rose up, mocking his evasive words. The senior scholar smiled and said, “Foolish words met with foolish belief—why all this clamor? We would do better to return and rest.”

Upon returning, the senior scholar quietly told Wang, “That man was truly a divine physiognomer! His words were not false—you are destined to place fifty-third.” Earlier, when the senior scholar had first returned, Wang had noticed his radiant countenance and felt something was amiss. Upon hearing the physiognomer’s prediction, he suspected the scholar had used the money Wang had given him to aid someone in need, then fabricated a story about losing it. Thus, he questioned him closely about the details. The senior scholar recounted everything and added, “Had you not given me those ten taels of silver, I would have witnessed his death with my own eyes. Today, I owe my undeserved divine favor entirely to your kindness.” Wang exclaimed in astonishment, “You possessed such magnanimity! If this is true, then I should be the one indebted to you. Yet how could that physiognomer be so divine!”

That examination, the senior scholar indeed passed as the top candidate, and Wang also succeeded. The following year, both entered the Hanlin Academy.

The Master of Sitting-among-Flowers said: “My close friend, Elder Jiang Yiting, recounted this tale to me and sighed, saying, ‘People often claim that poverty or prosperity, longevity or early death, are all bound to fate alone.’”

Yet how could one know that the Creator’s rewards and retributions are entirely determined by what one brings upon oneself? Consider the trifling sum of ten taels: the spirits must trace back to its source and bestow blessings in return. In the end, the licentious, though selected for the cinnamon palace, were swiftly stripped of their rank; the virtuous, though their names were soon to be entered in the ledgers of the dead, suddenly gained emolument and longevity. Thus, poverty and prosperity are reversed in an instant, and the span of life and death is altered in a moment. Even the friend who valued righteousness over wealth and practiced generosity received the recompense of his good deeds. For "misfortune and fortune have no gate; they are summoned only by oneself." From this, one’s conviction should grow ever firmer: can one not strive to do good? Can one not guard against evil?

"IV. In My Remaining Years, Stripped of Rank—
A Star Lord Descends with Banners and Streamers,
Yet Two Affairs Deceived a Widow and Cost Me the Title of Provincial Graduate

Repeatedly accumulating karmic entanglements, repeatedly stripped of rank,
A full-cheeked, square-jawed man bearing a noble countenance—

In my remaining years, I was a native of Yin County in Zhejiang. At my birth, an extraordinary fragrance filled the room, and rosy clouds illuminated the sky. That very night, my maternal grandfather, an elder named So-and-so, dreamed he entered the Palace of Wenchang, where he saw the Emperor Lord personally escorting a towering man out, with banners leading the way and ceremonial flags and standards following in his train, the majesty and splendor most grand. Beside them, a green-robed clerk holding a register glanced at my grandfather and said, 'This is a certain Star Lord descending to the mortal realm—he is your grandson.' Thereupon, he raised the yellow register in his hands to show my grandfather. Flipping to the first page, he saw written in large characters a certain name, followed by a list of official ranks and merits. The fine script filled page after page without end: at nine, he would enter the Confucian school; at seventeen, he would attain the title of Provincial Graduate; soon after, he would pass the metropolitan examination and place first in the palace examination; he would ascend to eminent and honorable positions, serving in both the capital and the provinces, rising to the rank of Grand Tutor, ennobled as a Duke of the Highest Order, his civil and military achievements resplendent and illustrious."

As he had not yet finished reading, he was awakened by a family member—his son-in-law’s household had sent word of a son’s birth! At daybreak he went to see the child, and as each recounted their strange omens, all were astonished and delighted, divining him to be a vessel of state. From infancy the boy was precocious and remarkable. As he grew older, his intelligence surpassed all others; when he read, ten lines met his eye at once. At seven he could compose essays, and at nine he entered the county school, earning the reputation of a prodigy. It so happened that his maternal uncle, a distinguished metropolitan graduate, had been appointed magistrate in eastern Guangdong. He took the boy with him, and after several years in Guangdong, the boy turned seventeen. His learning was vast, his talent abundant, and all who met him were filled with admiration. His uncle’s two sons studied alongside him, yet they fell far short of his abilities. That year, the autumn examination approached, and his uncle, considering his nephews’ studies incomplete, planned to wait for the next examination. He wavered over whether to send the boy home with his cousins. One night, he dreamed that the Martial Sage summoned him and declared, “If this young man does not return, Zhejiang Province will have no top scholar—send him back at once.”

Upon waking, his uncle immediately prepared the boy’s luggage and urged him to depart, presenting him with a generous sum of gold. The young man, ever confident in his own abilities, had a fondness for pleasure and dissipation, and along the way, he squandered his gold like dirt. No sooner had he crossed Mount Meiling than his purse was already empty. Passing through a certain county in Jiangxi, he came upon a magistrate who was his uncle’s fellow graduate and had long admired the young man. The young man paid him a visit, and the magistrate received him with the utmost favor and generosity, arranging lodging for him outside the yamen. The host of the lodging, however, was a man of long-standing cunning. In the county lived a wealthy widow who, though pregnant, had not yet given birth when her husband died. Her clansmen coveted her wealth and falsely accused her of adultery, bringing the case before the magistrate. The lodging host had in fact instigated the scheme, but thanks to the magistrate’s discernment, the clansmen’s plot nearly failed. Seeing that the young man was a favored guest of the magistrate, they offered him a substantial bribe, entreating him to intercede on their behalf. The young man, now in dire financial straits, embellished his words and reported to the magistrate, saying, “The woman’s scandalous reputation is widely known throughout the county. Yet when Your Honor first examined the case, you strove to protect her, and now people suspect you accepted her gold and deliberately favored her. Though I am deeply honored by your kindness and know Your Honor to be upright and incorruptible, I could not bear to see you deceived by petty officials and tarnished with an unclean reputation. Thus, I venture to relay what I have heard.”

The magistrate, swayed by his words, immediately summoned both parties and completely overturned his earlier ruling. He decreed the woman’s full repudiation, and the magistrate’s clansmen established an heir for her. The clansmen then divided all her property among themselves and bestowed a thousand taels of silver upon the young man. As he departed, the widow returned home and hanged herself.

While passing through Quzhou, the prefect—a fellow townsman and former examination peer of his uncle—held the young man in high esteem. The young man paid his respects, and the prefect likewise lodged him in the guest quarters outside the yamen. In the prefecture, a wealthy widow had recently been left a young widow, pregnant with a posthumous child. Her clansmen falsely accused her of adopting the child and brought the case to the county court, where it remained unresolved. They then escalated the matter, accusing her of disrupting the clan lineage, and the prefect initially sided against them. The young man again accepted their bribes, embellished his words, and reported to the prefect. The prefect, once more deceived, ruled that the widow must abandon her child and allow a clansman’s son to inherit. Having secured two substantial bribes, the young man grew increasingly complacent. Yet when the examinations concluded, he failed once more. Returning home, his conduct grew ever more lawless.

He devoted himself entirely to litigation, his schemes growing ever more cunning and his written arguments ever more formidable. Like a mirage of sea markets and towering clam-spirits, he conjured illusions at will, bringing ruin to many. Yet in the examinations, he met repeated defeat, and at forty, he remained mired in the humble garb of a scholar. Eventually, his uncle retired and returned home. Upon learning of his nephew’s conduct, he flew into a rage and confined him to the house.

One night, the uncle dreamed he wandered into the City God’s temple. There, he saw two clerks seated beneath the corridor. One said, “For twenty years, I have repeatedly removed his name from the examination rolls—why?” The other smirked and replied, “This year, his name was struck again for such-and-such a matter. Fortunately, his uncle has taken responsibility for him in this affair, so he may yet live.” The uncle, astonished, bowed and inquired further.

The clerk handed him the register to examine. On the first page appeared the name of the young scholar, and the official honors listed matched what the uncle had seen in his dream. Yet the charges of misconduct were piled high, nearly exhausting all merit, leaving but a single examination attempt—only for that too to be struck from the record on the Clear and Bright Day for some offense, committed, it seemed, while sweeping his ancestors’ graves. His allotted lifespan, too, matched the clerk’s words. The uncle awoke in alarm and summoned the young man to his bedside, enumerating his misdeeds and recounting the dream. The scholar wept and confessed his guilt; from that day forward, he somewhat restrained his conduct. Over twenty years later, he ended his days still clad in the humble garb of a scholar.

When Master Jiang Yiting served as a guest instructor in Ningbo, he once met the man in person. His face was full, his brow broad, his jaw square, his beard long—hardly the appearance of one who had grown old in the scholar’s gown. The Master of the Flower Seat remarked:

“There have been those in the world endowed with talent surpassing the ages, for whom scaling the clouds seemed as effortless as plucking a mustard seed from the ground. Yet they spent their lives in the examination halls, never gaining even an inch of advancement, and one cannot but sigh at how rare true talent is—and how cruelly Heaven crushes and thwarts those it does bestow. But when we observe this young scholar: born with exceptional gifts, diligent in study from youth, had he but bound himself to self-discipline and restraint, would the words of the gods in his uncle’s dream have proven entirely groundless? The honors recorded in that register might yet have been his. Instead, he gave free rein to his tongue, wielding his words like a brush dipped in orpiment, reversing right and wrong at will; he filled his greedy purse at the expense of others’ reputations and moral standing.”

The end came with the stripping of his official rank and emoluments, leaving him to perish in the garb of a student—only then did one realize that Heaven does not spurn talent, but rather that men fail to wield their gifts with goodness. Alas, how perilous this is!

**V. The Scholar Wu**

*True kin indeed are only brother and brother-in-law—*
*Would they risk their lives to save his whole household?*
*Sealed in his chamber, he grieved the stolen primacy,*
*Yet owed a debt deeper than even his examination master’s grace.*

Wu of Yixing, a scholar renowned in the academy, sat for the examinations time and again, yet never succeeded. On New Year’s Eve, his brother-in-law dreamed of a placard posted at the county temple, announcing Wu as the next provincial graduate. Moments later, the name was struck away. Startled and perplexed, he heard an attendant beside him say, “He is to commit a grave transgression in the coming year, so his name was removed.” The brother-in-law asked, “Can this still be averted?” The attendant replied, “You must petition the master.” He was led inside to an audience.

The City God sat facing south. Prostrating himself, the brother-in-law pleaded on Wu’s behalf.

The deity cast down a ledger, upon which was inscribed that Wu was destined to become a Triple First Minister, but all had been erased due to the sins of his speech and writing. The record of the current examination matched the attendant’s words. The brother-in-law kowtowed and pleaded desperately, saying, “What is past is past, but future misfortune may yet be prevented. I vow on my entire family’s lives to ensure he does not commit this act.” The deity nodded in assent and ordered the attendant to lead him out—whereupon the placard hung as before.

Awakening, he sought to tell his wife, but she suddenly cried out as if in a nightmare. Rousing her, he asked the reason for her frantic shouting. She recounted seeing a messenger announce her brother as the provincial graduate, only for another to snatch it away, saying, “Wu’s name has been struck—do not report it in error.” Thus she had cried out in alarm. The brother-in-law then recounted his dream, and both were astonished. They deliberated how to handle Wu.

His wife said, “This is no difficulty. My brother is now widowed and childless, living alone in solitude. If we lure him to our home, confine him in an empty chamber, and explain the matter, we may admonish and safeguard him.”

The next morning, he dressed in formal attire and went to visit Wu. After exchanging New Year’s greetings, he deceived him, saying his sister had suddenly fallen ill and longed to see her brother, and thus pulled him home. Once Wu ascended the stairs and saw his sister in good health, he was about to ask the reason when she hastily led him into a secluded chamber, closed the door, and locked it. Through the door, she recounted the dream. Wu exclaimed in surprise, “The thought has indeed crossed my mind, but I have yet to act—how could the spirits and gods so swiftly mete out punishment!”

His sister and brother-in-law said, “All necessities are provided in the room. You may use this time to study diligently and must not leave.” When the examination period arrived, they finally opened the door. Uncle and nephew then traveled together to Jinling. Apart from entering the examination hall, they took not a single step without each other’s company. When the results were announced, Wu indeed placed first.

The Master of *Sitting Among Flowers* remarked: “To punish a man for a deed not yet committed may seem harsh, but I deem it an act of great kindness. Why? Had the deed been done, even if retribution were swift and manifest, what good would it serve? By intercepting his intent and thwarting it, they awakened him to caution, preventing him from reckless action. Thus, the man avoided the burden of evil, and Wu escaped the fate of being struck from the rolls—was this not a fortunate outcome?

Yet Wu was indeed lucky. In the darkest chamber, with a guilty conscience, the eyes of the gods are as piercing as lightning. I fear that in the vast expanse of the world, not all who slumber in the shadows of wrongdoing can be roused by the gods’ call to awakening.”

Six: The Retribution of Minister Qian Wencheng for Mass Slaughter

*In military affairs, nurturing Heaven’s harmony—*
*Yet "evil seeds must not remain" was too harsh a decree.*
*Behold how Cao Bin spared lives,*
*And Jiangnan’s later troubles were few indeed.*

In Changzhou, many were the great clans—such as Prime Minister Lü Gong, Chief Examiner Yang Tingyi, Minister Zhao Shenqiao, and Grand Coordinator Pan Siju—whose descendants achieved successive degrees in the imperial examinations, their literary legacy unbroken. Only the lineage of Minister Qian Wencheng Weicheng has withered most severely, now on the verge of extinction.

It is said that during the campaign to suppress the Miao rebels, Minister Qian, then serving as Minister of Justice and military advisor, joined the expedition. After the rebel chieftains were executed, the commanding general sought to slaughter all adult males while sparing the young and weak. Consulting Minister Qian, he declared resolutely: *"Evil seeds must not remain!"* Thus, all were put to death, not a single child left alive, and the Miao bloodline was extinguished. Soon after the army’s return, Minister Qian passed away, his son followed in death, and many of his grandsons were afflicted with disabilities. The Qian ancestral sacrifices ultimately ceased.

Seven: The Midwife’s Unyielding Chastity

*A midwife’s life was one of hardship,*
*Yet widowed young, she served with diligence.*
*Though her mother-in-law urged remarriage, she refused,*
*And in grief, cut off her ear—her purity unblemished.*

The City God of Shanghai was renowned for his divine efficacy. In the year *bingxu* of the Daoguang reign, the county undertook an inquiry into exemplary chastity and filial piety.

All those unable to afford individual commendation had their names collectively submitted to the authorities—whether the *Dao*, prefecture, subprefecture, or county—where a general memorial arch was erected. At the outset of the endeavor, a central bureau was established at Ruizhu Academy, overseen by several gentry. The assembly agreed that this undertaking bore directly upon public morals and brooked no personal bias. Thus, they invited the City God’s processional statue into the bureau, and all administrators swore oaths before the deity to ensure absolute impartiality.

One day, a chaste widow was reported. Upon inquiry into her background, it was revealed she was a midwife. Director Wang laughed and said, *"Set her aside! How could a midwife possibly preserve her chastity?"* The others concurred.

That night, Wang dreamed he was summoned by a servant in black to the county temple’s floral hall. There, he saw the City God seated in plain robes, who rebuked him sternly: *"Young fool! Discerning neither truth nor falsehood, you speak recklessly, slandering the virtuous. You deserve immediate punishment!"*

The deity, however, took pity on his thoughtless error and instructed, *"Go at once to the Confucian temple. There, you will find an elderly man holding a broom at the gate—he will tell you the full truth."* Then he warned, *"Be more cautious in future. Should you repeat such offenses, I shall not forgive you."* Wang kowtowed in submission.

The deity commanded the attendant spirit to lead him out. As he reached the gate, he awoke, immediately rose, and sat waiting for dawn. At first light, he hurried to the Confucian temple. There, he indeed saw an old man sweeping the ground—it was the temple’s caretaker. Wang inquired about the midwife’s chastity, and the old man started in surprise: *"Sir, you ask the right person—no one else would know. She is a woman of true integrity and bitter suffering. For forty years, I have lived next door to her. Her family has long practiced midwifery. She was fair of face, widowed young, and childless. Her parents-in-law urged her to remarry, but she swore she would not. As her mother-in-law grew too old to deliver babies, the widow took up the trade to support her in-laws, fulfilling her filial duty. Once, while attending a wealthy household, the master’s son coveted her beauty and tried to force himself upon her. She refused to yield, even at the cost of her life, and escaped by a stratagem. Later, the young man bribed her parents-in-law with gold, and they both pressed her to comply. In defiance, she cut off her ear and sent it to him—only then was she left in peace. I have been her neighbor since her youth, and in all these years, I have never seen her jest with any man. Such steadfast virtue—ought she not to be honored with an official commendation?"*

King Wang, having heard the full account, hastened to the bureau and recounted to his colleagues his nocturnal dream and the old man’s words, then inscribed the widow’s name in the register. That a woman of such chastity should be revered even by the gods—how can her virtue not be esteemed!

Master of the Flowery Seat observes: "Loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and chastity—these take root in the deepest nature. Heaven bestows them upon all without exception, unlike wealth, rank, or worldly success, which it may withhold. Yet Heaven values loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and chastity a hundredfold more than wealth, rank, or worldly success. Why? Because men, in their pursuit of wealth, rank, and worldly success, often abandon loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and chastity. Yet within the meanest hovels—where doors are woven of thorn and bramble, and walls are pierced for narrow side-passages—there arise deeds that even scholar-officials cannot match. Thus Heaven, finding such virtue rare and difficult, cannot but hold it in the highest regard.

That poor woman beneath her leaking eaves, who preserved her chastity through hardship—even spirits and gods hasten to honor her, to shame those who, though clad in robes and sashes, are no better than beasts of burden."

Yet to suppress such deeds with reckless slander and leave them unacknowledged—how fitting that the gods should hold such men to account!"

VIII. A Beggar’s Blessing
*Returning the Gold*

This beggar was fine timber indeed—
To win so much yet crave not a grain!
A jade found its buyer with joy unfeigned:
Wife, wealth, and children came all in train.

Jia Ayu was a native of Yangxian. In his youth, he begged for food in the village and often sheltered in a local earth-god shrine outside the city. One New Year’s Eve, as dusk fell, he noticed a roll of indigo cloth on the ground. Upon picking it up, he found a woman’s garment wrapped around a packet of silver—some thirty taels in all. Overjoyed, he then thought: *"I am but a beggar—what use have I for this? The one who lost it may yet come to harm in despair."* So he sat and waited for the owner to appear.

After some time, a middle-aged woman emerged from the city, wailing and searching the ground. Knowing her to be the rightful owner, he called out to her. Seeing only a beggar, she paid him no heed and wept all the more bitterly. Ayu said: *"What are you searching for? I have sat here long and may have seen it."* The woman then told him of the lost garment and silver, adding: *"My husband was imprisoned for unpaid taxes. I sold our daughter to raise the money—now it is gone, and I have nothing left but death."* Ayu asked about the color of the garment and the wrapping of the silver; all matched. He immediately produced them and returned them to her.

Overcome with gratitude, the woman offered him a portion of the silver in thanks, but he steadfastly refused. That night, as he lay in the shrine, he saw the hall ablaze with lamps and candles. *"Surely it is not yet dawn—why would worshippers come so early?"* Suddenly, he heard voices from the hall: *"Today, a beggar did not conceal lost gold but saved a couple from death. His merit is great—he deserves a blessing."* Another voice replied: *"This man is fated to remain a beggar and live only to thirty."* The first voice said: *"We should petition the Eastern Peak to amend his register of blessings and grant him a wife and children to encourage virtue."* Then came the command: *"First, bestow upon him a chest of silver."* At once, someone placed a large chest before Ayu, saying: *"The gods above have granted this to you."*

He awoke in ecstasy—only to find the shrine as dark as before. As he stretched and rose, his foot struck something with a metallic clang.

He picked it up to examine it and found six large coins tied with a cord. Chuckling to himself, he said, *"Could this truly be the gift from the gods?"* He tucked them into his robe. In Yangxian, it was the local custom that at New Year’s dawn, wealthy households would prepare cakes and sweets to distribute to beggars. Throughout the city and its outskirts, gambling stalls were plentiful. There were also sugar vendors who set out six dice on their carrying poles and wagered with passersby—those who won could claim sugar or coins as they pleased. These vendors always gathered on the Long Bridge.

The Long Bridge marked the spot where Zhou, the Filial Marquis of Jin, had slain the flood dragon. Zhou Xu, posthumously known as the Filial Marquis, was a native of Yangxian. Orphaned young, he possessed extraordinary strength and loved hunting, though he neglected proper conduct, much to the distress of his community. An elder once sighed, *"With the three scourges still unchecked, what is to be done?"* When Zhou asked what he meant, the elder replied, *"The dragon beneath the Long Bridge, the white-browed tiger of South Mountain, and you—these are the three scourges."* Zhou then entered the mountains to slay the tiger and plunged into the river to behead the dragon, thereafter mending his ways and cultivating integrity. Lu Shilong urged him to devote himself to learning. Later, he served as Palace Aide to the Censor-in-Chief and became renowned for his moral character.

At dawn the next day, Ayu begged and received a great many cakes. After eating his fill, he took six coins to the Long Bridge and gambled with the sugar vendors, winning every match. After besting ten or more vendors, he had won a thousand coins. He then went to the gambling den and won again. From morning till dusk, he amassed tens of thousands of coins. Nearby, an old merchant surnamed Jia ran a noodle shop beside the Long Bridge. Whenever Ayu begged for food or money, he would go buy noodles, and the old man had long taken pity on him. That day, Ayu entrusted all his winnings to the shop. The next day, he gambled again and won without fail. After four or five days, his coins had grown to over a hundred thousand. Suddenly, he reflected: *"The money I win at gambling is all ill-gotten gain. Though I have been blessed by the gods, those I defeat are not all wealthy. To seize their money so swiftly is to invite misfortune. Moreover, as a beggar, I have suddenly come into over a hundred thousand coins—if I work hard and live frugally, I can build a family. Why gamble further? Winning brings no peace of mind, and losing would reduce me to beggary again."* He then swore to the gods never to gamble again.

At the time, the old merchant’s noodle shop was on the verge of closing for lack of capital. Ayu consulted with him and offered all his winnings to replenish the shop’s funds, working there as a hired hand. The old man was delighted and chose an auspicious day to reopen. When the shop reopened, customers flocked to it like ducks to water, and profits multiplied several times over. Within a few years, the shop’s capital grew to several thousand, and business thrived. The old merchant had no sons, only a daughter, who held Ayu in high regard. He gave her to Ayu in marriage. Ayu, in turn, served the old man as a father and remained devoted to him for the rest of his life. Later, his wife bore two sons in succession, and Ayu lived to the age of seventy before passing away. His descendants still run the noodle shop as before, and the family enjoys modest prosperity.

Ayu never knew his own surname and took Jia as his own after relying on the old merchant. The Master of the Flower Seat remarked: *"Ayu, though a lowly beggar, did not pocket the money he found—already a rare virtue! Yet one might say this was but a single good impulse. When he dreamed of divine favor and won great wealth through gambling, who among others in his place would not have treated his luck like a treasure bowl, hoping to fill great chests with gold from endless wagers? Yet even in the midst of unbroken victory, he considered the hardship of those he defeated and swore to the gods to stop. This was truly a case of ‘retiring bravely from the rapids’—both benevolent and wise!"*

The family lived to a ripe old age and met a virtuous end—was it not fitting that blessings should flow to their descendants?

**9. The Thief’s Reward**

In dead of night, he stole by the hidden beam,
Then chanced upon a rapist fierce as wolf or tiger.
Had the woman refused, two lives would have been lost—
He wrested the blade and struck the black-hearted rogue.

Thrice he cried, *"I’m a thief!"*—yet his spirit was ever bold.
The bundle returned, the debt repaid, gain and loss as fleeting as Chu’s lost bow.

At first, a beggar, then a thief, a certain Jia later amassed great wealth. His descendants entered the official register, and he was honored as a venerable patriarch.

When he was still a thief, there lived in the same town a family surnamed Mou, long prosperous, where three generations of widows had dwelt. Three sisters-in-law—all childless, their husbands dead—faced the extinction of their line. Only the youngest sister-in-law carried a posthumous child, and all hoped for a son to continue the ancestral rites.

On the Clear and Bright Festival, they went to sweep the graves in the countryside. The two elder sisters-in-law made the journey, which would take three days for the round trip. The youngest, being with child, stayed behind, attended by an old serving woman.

Jia, having scouted the house, seized the opportunity to burgle it. At dusk, he scaled the wall and entered, only to see the youngest sister-in-law and the old woman carrying a lamp to check the doors. He slipped into the woman’s chamber and hid.

The woman sat beneath the lamp, reading, while the old woman, feigning drunkenness, urged her to sleep. The woman said, *"Go close the door and rest. Do not disturb me."* The old woman left, leaving the door ajar.

Moments later, a young man pushed open the door. Jia, suspecting a fellow thief, was surprised he had not waited for the woman to sleep—and even more so by his fine, well-kept clothes. The woman, seeing the intruder, rose in alarm and tried to call for the old woman, who did not answer. The young man seized her, demanding her favors. She resisted fiercely, crying out, but the old woman paid no heed.

When the woman refused, the young man drew a knife from his boot and threatened, *"Yield, or I’ll bathe my blade in blood!"* The woman rebuked him: *"My family has always been honorable. I will not suffer the stain of a scoundrel’s touch. Kill me if you must—I will never submit!"* He pressed the knife to her throat.

Jia, watching in mounting fury, suddenly sprang out, wrested the knife from the young man’s hand, and struck him down with a blow to the forehead. The woman, taken by surprise, trembled violently, unable to utter a sound.

Jia rushed out, flung open the door, and shouted, *"Catch the thief!"* The neighbors gathered, asking, *"Where is the thief? Who are you?"* Driven by righteous indignation, Jia had forgotten he had come to steal. Only now did he realize, and he laughed: *"I am a thief—but there are those far more despicable than thieves. Why not follow me?"* And he led the crowd into the woman’s chamber.

At that moment, the woman had already fled to another room, leaving only one man lying in a pool of blood. They held up a light to see—it was the neighbor from the west, fortunately only lightly wounded and not yet dead. When asked how he came to be there, he remained silent. When questioned, Jia recounted all he had witnessed, and the crowd then bound the man together. At daybreak, they escorted him to the authorities.

The young man, in turn, falsely accused the woman and Jia of adultery, claiming he had gone that evening to catch them in the act. Jia said, *"I am a thief—who does not know this? Even if the woman were unchaste, how could she consent to adultery with a thief?"* He then detailed the events of the night and confessed to his years of burglary, confirming his identity as a thief. The magistrate, after verifying the records, subjected the young man to severe interrogation. Only then did he confess the truth: he had long coveted the woman’s beauty. That night, he had seized the opportunity to go to her.

The serving matron had accepted bribes to facilitate their scheme. The magistrate thus sentenced the young man and the matron according to the law, commended the woman’s chastity, and released Jia on grounds of righteousness. Upon his release, Jia resumed his thieving as before.

One night, he burgled a village shop. Discovered by the master of the house, he fled, pursued by a large crowd. In his haste, he blundered into a dead end with no escape. In his panic, he spotted a ruined temple, scaled its wall, and sought to hide beneath the altar table. In his rush, he collided with a clay statue standing beside it, knocking it to the ground—and himself with it. In his dazed state, he saw the clay figure he had struck rise from the floor: its face was green, its beard crimson, and it brandished a blade as it roared at Jia, *"How dare you knock me down?"* It lunged forward, seized Jia, and prepared to kill him. Jia strained with all his might to resist.

Suddenly, a voice thundered from the hall above: *"This man preserved a woman’s chastity and safeguarded another’s ancestral line—his hidden virtue is vast, and Heaven has already bestowed great fortune upon him. How dare you ghostly minions bring harm to him?"* At once, someone seized the green-faced figure by the hair and dragged him away, striking him hundreds of times. Then the voice summoned Jia, saying, *"Beneath the cinnabar steps lies a great treasure—it is granted to you."*

He bowed in gratitude and rose. In a daze, he saw beneath the cinnabar steps a mountain of gold; hastening down the steps, he stumbled and awoke. Looking up, he saw three or five scattered stars in the sky, the faint glow of dawn just breaking. Silently recalling the divine words, he followed the steps downward and searched the ground all around, finding only a single Kangxi-era coin. Thinking the ghost had mocked him, he nonetheless picked it up. As the light grew discernible, he set off. Soon he reached a village, where he saw by the roadside a vendor selling roasted sweet potatoes. With the coin he had found, he bought some to eat. Presently, an old man also came to buy food and sat beside him. After eating, the old man left at once, forgetting his satchel. As Jia was about to rise, he saw it and knew it belonged to the old man. Opening it, he found two large ingots of yellow gold, over a hundred foreign silver coins, several hundred copper cash, and four ledgers recording uncollected silver debts amounting to tens of thousands. Fearing the sweet potato vendor would see, he quickly closed it. He thought to himself, *"Could this be the treasure the deity bestowed? Yet if the old man loses these ledgers, how will he collect the silver? Even if it is a divine gift, I cannot accept it."* So he sat back down to wait for the old man’s return. After a long while, the vendor grew angry and urged him, *"If you’re not going to spend another coin, why sit here so long? Do you plan to stay the night?"* Jia replied, *"No, I still wish to buy more."* He took out a few coins from the satchel and bought more food to continue waiting.

The old man indeed came hurrying back in great haste, sweat streaming down like rain. Seeing Jia still seated and eating, he immediately asked, *"You haven’t left yet—did you happen to see a satchel I just lost?"* Jia smiled and said, *"Had it not been for your belongings, I would have left long ago."* With that, he lifted the satchel and returned it, saying, *"Everything is here as it was. I only borrowed a few coins to buy sweet potatoes—please do not blame me."* The old man neither opened it to check nor expressed gratitude, merely saying, *"My humble home is not far from here—why not accompany me?"* Jia followed him. After walking several *li*, they arrived at a grand residence where stacks of lumber outside the gate rose like a mountain. The old man led him inside to the main hall. Then he went in, adjusted his robes and cap, and emerged to bow to Jia, saying, *"I am from Chu and have run a lumber business here for many years. All the lumber shops in the various counties are branches of this one, with capital amounting to hundreds of thousands—most of it lent on credit, all recorded in the ledgers I just lost. Thanks to your returning them to me, I am saved from ruin! Please accept a thousand taels of silver as my gratitude."*

Jia firmly declined. Seeing his sincerity, the old man asked what trade he had once practiced. Jia, looking abashed, replied, *"I have no trade."* The old man then asked if he had any family, to which Jia answered, *"I am a man adrift, with neither home nor wife."* *"Then how do you make a living?"* Jia said, *"I dare not deceive you—I am a thief!"* When asked his name, he told him. The old man started in surprise and said, *"In the past, there was a righteous thief in such-and-such a county who killed a profligate to protect a chaste widow—was that you?"* *"It was,"* Jia replied. The old man said, *"This deed of yours could be sworn before the gods. Now, seeing you refuse to take what is not yours, you are resplendent in your integrity—something even the gentry rarely achieve. My family’s wealth amounts to a million, yet I have no one to trust. If you do not disdain me, why not stay with me? I will provide you with clothing, food, and money—would this not be better than being a ‘gentleman of the beam’?"*

Jia joyfully agreed and lived with the old man. As he was somewhat literate, the old man had him manage the accounts. For two years, Jia handled the business with diligence, prudence, and meticulous care, never cutting the slightest corner. The old man, who had no sons, eventually adopted Jia as his own and took him back to his hometown. Since he had been away for so long, none of the villagers knew the truth. When the old man died, Jia inherited his business. His descendants multiplied, some becoming local scholars, others rising to the ranks of provincial inspectors and prefectural governors. To this day, they remain one of the great families of Chu.

The Master of the Flower Seat said: *"The Way of Heaven shows no partiality, yet it ever favors the good. Though his past was that of a lowly thief, his heart was that of a gentleman. Thus, he was rewarded with abundance, for Heaven did not withhold its bounty on account of his former deeds. Yet those born to noble lineages who descend to the status of menials—how they came to such a fate may well be understood."*

"X. The Blessings of a Lowly Constable:
Virtue, Not Birth, Determines Fortune

A Constable’s Son Passes the Imperial Examination—
What Became of Magistrate Deng’s Descendants?
Did Their Noble Lineage Bring Them Equal Renown?

The ancestors of a certain Grand Secretary of Wuxing (present-day Huzhou) once served as a constable in the prefectural yamen. Though his post was base, his heart was loyal and kind, ever mindful of aiding others and benefiting all beings. He often told his peers: *'The public court is a fine place to cultivate the Way. If we who serve in the public court do no good, it is like entering a mountain of treasures only to return empty-handed.'* Thus, whenever villagers came to lodge complaints, he would mediate and urge reconciliation. For the poor whose cause was just, he would especially shield them with all his might. Each night, he would place his rod in the chamber pot, for urine could dispel stasis and promote regeneration. Even when the rod drew blood and flesh lay in disarray, it would not fester. At the time, a certain Magistrate Deng was known for his severity—he would not cease flogging until blood flowed. Yet by this constable’s practice, many lives were preserved. His peers, moved by his example, likewise curbed their greed and cruelty."

The elder had a son whose name is now lost, who from childhood was quick-witted and fond of reading. Once, returning from the village school, he inadvertently obstructed the path of a prefectural governor and was seized by the governor’s advance guard. Seeing his youth, the governor merely rebuked him and let him go. Upon returning home, the boy declared resolutely, “Who is to say I shall not one day become a governor myself?” The elder laughed, “You are foolish, child! I am but a bondsman—how could you sit for the examinations and become a governor?” Though the son dared not argue, he applied himself to his studies with even greater diligence. As he grew older, his literary reputation spread widely. Many of the local gentry held him in high esteem, and the elder, ever a man of upright character, had always shown the utmost respect for scholars. Thus, the students of the Three Schools not only refrained from making things difficult for him but even vied to urge the elder to allow his son to take the examinations. Reluctantly, the elder consented, and at his first attempt, the son was admitted as a government student. Later, he passed the provincial examination and rose through the ranks to become a prefectural governor himself.

Several generations later, his descendants included a grand secretary and a provincial governor, and to this day their caps and tassels remain unbroken, earning them the reputation of a distinguished clan.

The Master of Seated Flowers remarked, “The old bondsman, though of the lowest station, established a single good intention in his heart. Heaven then did not hesitate to bestow upon him worthy sons and virtuous grandsons, greatly prospering his posterity. Yet how do those who usurp high positions and enjoy lavish emoluments, knowing only to fleece the people for their own benefit, compare to this elder? And how, then, will Heaven repay them?”

11. The Yangxian Scholar
Avoiding misfortune and seeking fortune through good thoughts,
Fortunate to meet a physiognomist whose arts reached the divine.
The bamboo mat above and the bamboo mat below turned to dust—
Yet in joy, he was selected as a candidate in Yixing.

A certain scholar from Yangxian, a renowned figure in the academy and of modestly prosperous family, traveled in the summer of the *renchen* year of the Jiaqing reign (1802) with fellow students to Chengjiang to sit for the *bazhen* examination.

At the time, the scholar had excelled in both the annual and triennial examinations, repeatedly topping his cohort—so swiftly claiming first place that he felt certain of securing the *bazhen* selection. Carrying ample funds, he passed his days in the lodging house, reveling in poetry and wine with his fellow scholars, thoroughly content.

At the inn there was a skilled physiognomist who sat behind a curtain at the door, his readings often proving uncannily accurate. The scholar, sharing the same lodgings, grew quite familiar with him. One day, returning with a fish, he teased the physiognomist: “You claim to read fortunes—tell me, will I be able to eat this fish?” The physiognomist glanced at the fish, then at the scholar, and replied, “No.” The scholar went inside, hastily cooked the fish, and set it on the table. He then invited the physiognomist to join him, intending to mock his error. As they were about to sit down, he asked again, “Will I eat it now?” The physiognomist answered, “No.” Before the words had fully left his mouth, a massive serpent dropped from the beam, crushing the pot. The vessel shattered, and the crowd erupted in alarm. The serpent slithered away, tail dragging, and the fish remained uneaten.

Astonished by the man’s uncanny skill, the scholar pressed him. The physiognomist demurred: “What skill? You were only jesting with me, so I jested in return. Had it not been in play, what concern would a mere fish be to fortune-telling?” The scholar then asked whether he would indeed be selected for the *bazhen*. The physiognomist hesitated, saying, “I have long wished to speak frankly, but feared reproach and dared not.” The scholar urged, “What harm could it do?” Finally, the man replied, “You have no hope of selection. Your countenance already bears the shadow of misfortune—three days hence, at the third watch, you will die an unnatural death. Your home is not far; you should return at once to die in your own bed.” The scholar asked, “Can this be avoided?”

The scholar asked, “Can this be avoided?”

The physiognomist replied, “It cannot.”

Seeing the man’s resolute words, the scholar was seized with terror. He immediately wished to pack his belongings. His fellow examinees all reproached the physiognomist for his reckless claim and urged the scholar not to return home. Though he remained, his heart was never at ease. When the appointed time arrived, the new moon had just risen, and all those lodging with him were asleep. Overwhelmed by doubt and dread, he found neither sitting nor lying bearable. In a daze, he stepped outside. Wandering aimlessly to a desolate stretch of land, he heard faint sobbing. Following the sound, he traced it to a dilapidated hut. Pushing open the door, he saw a woman clutching two children, weeping with bitter sorrow. When he asked her reason, she explained that her husband, having borrowed fifty taels of silver from a powerful family, had been sued by them and thrown into prison. Beaten and bloodied under interrogation, he was now forced to sell her to repay the debt—an agreement already made. At daybreak, she would be taken away. Unable to bear parting from her children, she wept.

The student silently calculated that his purse held ample gold. "If, as the physiognomist said, I am to die soon, what use is this to me? Better to return it on their behalf and preserve this couple." He then asked, "Has the marriage contract been drawn up yet?" "Not yet," she replied. "Then if you receive the silver, can the sale still be stopped?" "It can." "Where is the matchmaker?" "Not far from here." "In that case, hurry and call the matchmaker to wait here. I will return home to fetch the silver for you." The woman suspected he had other motives and hesitated to comply. The student smiled and said, "I pity your family being torn apart, so I will open my purse to help. Go quickly without doubt." Only then did the woman happily agree.

The student hastened home, took seventy taels of silver, and returned. There, the woman sat with an old man. When asked who he was, she said, "The matchmaker for my sale." The student produced the silver and gave it to the woman, explaining to the old man. The old man, startled, exclaimed, "A stranger on the road shows such noble virtue—how much more should I, your husband’s neighbor! Thanks to your kindness, the sale need not be mentioned. We must only rush to repay the debt to the authorities and secure the prisoner’s release." He then examined the silver, surprised by its amount. The student said, "The remainder can be used for trade to sustain yourselves, so you need not incur further debt." The old man sighed deeply and said, "How thoroughly you have considered this! You are truly the reborn parents of this couple!" He then knelt and asked the student’s name and address in detail.

The student returned to his lodging, but the physiognomist’s words still troubled him, and he could not sleep.

Hearing the night watch sound its third drum, he thought to himself, "The hour has come!" As he sat lost in doubt, there came a knock at the door—someone seeking an audience. Rising, he saw the woman from before, who had used the silver to settle the debt with the authorities. Her husband, now freed, had come with her to express their gratitude. The student rose to receive them, offering words of comfort and reassurance. After seeing them out, he prepared to return to bed when he heard a tremendous crash from his bedchamber. Entering, he found the wall collapsed, crushing the very bed where he had lain. The reed mat and bamboo sleeping mat beneath were reduced to fine powder. He then moved to sleep in another room.

The next day, the student sought out the physiognomist, who scoffed at his claims. The physiognomist, unaware of the previous night’s events, examined him closely and laughed, saying, “Do not deceive me—you must have done something last night. Your face bears the marks of profound hidden merit, a great act of unseen virtue. If you had not, you would already be dead, crushed beneath that crumbling wall! Had my words been false, you would have perished beneath its collapse.” The student marveled and bowed in admiration.

That very year, he was selected as a *bagong* and later entered the Hanlin Academy. The Master of the Flower-Adorned Seat remarked, “The physiognomist was no mere mortal! Though the matter of a single fish seems trivial—what bearing could it have on one’s fate?—his words were but a subtle deflection. The noble-minded, observing how the great serpent destroyed the vessel, understand that every sip and bite is predestined, not to be forced. Witnessing the bed crushed beneath the collapsing wall, they know that life and death arrive at their appointed hour, beyond all chance or escape.”

Then he took the gold from his pouch and swiftly released the imprisoned debtor. Those who had gathered outside the gate saw the calamity dissolve in an instant. The man’s flesh and blood were preserved, and thus my own body was kept whole. At the threshold between man and ghost—where life and death hang in the balance—fortune and misfortune shift in the blink of an eye. How swift as echo follows sound! “Disaster and blessing have no gate; they are summoned only by man.” Is this not true?

**Twelve: Elder Tang the Enfeoffed**

The enfeoffed elder delighted in goodness, and his son cultivated virtue.
His success in the examinations came not from backdoor dealings.
Though he did not attend the ritual court, his name still rose to prominence—
Only then did one recognize the prime minister as no ordinary talent.

Tang Dunfu was the enfeoffed father of a grand councilor. He once transported goods between north and south, shrewd in commerce yet careless with wealth, fond of righteousness, bearing the spirit of an ancient knight-errant. On one occasion, returning from the capital, he lodged at an inn in Renping County.

Hearing the sound of weeping from the neighboring room, he inquired of the innkeeper. It was an old man who had brought his young daughter to the capital, only to fall ill upon reaching the inn. His illness had dragged on, depleting his travel funds, and he was now preparing to sell his daughter to continue the journey. The girl could not bear to leave her father, hence her tears. Moved by compassion, the elder summoned the innkeeper to call them over. Upon asking their origins, he learned they were also from Xiaoshan, traveling to the capital to seek refuge with a relative who served as a ministry clerk. When he pressed further about selling the girl, the old man wept and explained, “My prolonged illness has left me owing the innkeeper tens of thousands in coin. With no other recourse at this dead end, I had no choice but to resort to this desperate measure.”

The elder then opened his purse and gave him a hundred taels of silver, saying, “Take this to repay the innkeeper, and use the remainder for your travel expenses. You need not sell your daughter.” Overjoyed beyond expectation, the old man hurriedly called his daughter forward and said, “This kind gentleman from the Tang family has given us so much silver. You should go with him—we are fellow townsmen, not strangers here with no one to turn to.” The girl stepped forward to bow in gratitude, revealing herself to be a beauty of sixteen. The elder sternly declared, “I did this solely out of pity for your separation as father and daughter, not to take your girl for myself. When you reach the capital, find her a worthy match—do not sell her again!” Both father and daughter knelt in tearful thanks, inquiring in detail about the elder’s family before departing.

By this time, the grand councilor had already become a government student and was preparing for the autumn examinations. In the year *jiayin*, as he traveled to Hangzhou for the provincial exam, his teacher suddenly summoned him and secretly handed him a *guanjie*, saying, “The proctor has passed on the chief examiner’s instructions.” The grand councilor set it aside without looking, replying, “This must be a mistake. I share no acquaintance with the chief examiner—how could such a thing come to me?”

Moreover, I would not wish to succeed through such *guanjie*.” His teacher pressed it upon him, but he steadfastly refused. After the examination, he returned home at once. When the results were announced, he unexpectedly topped the list. The messenger arrived, and the county magistrate came as well, bearing the chief examiner’s summons to hasten to the celebratory feast. With no choice, he went to the provincial capital to pay his respects to his *zuoshi*. At the time, the chief examiner was Grand Secretary Wu of Nanhui. Upon seeing him, Wu immediately said, “Minister He has entrusted this to me—hurry to the capital. You may yet claim the *sanyuan*.”

The grand councilor, visibly displeased, replied, “I am but a humble scholar from the countryside—how could I be known to the minister? And to advance by such *yinyuan* would be against all propriety.” Grand Secretary Wu fell silent. As he left, the proctor summoned him again and inquired, “Did your esteemed father once rescue a father and daughter in dire straits on the road to Renping?” “I know nothing of this,” he replied. The governor then said, “Go home and ask your father—you will understand. That girl later entered the capital, only to be sold again by her father into Minister He’s residence, where she became his favored concubine. She told the minister of your father’s great kindness and mentioned that you were sitting for the autumn examinations. Thus, the minister instructed the chief examiner to seek out your paper, but it could not be found among the first selections. When the list was being finalized, even after unsealing all the discarded papers, yours still eluded them. Only upon reviewing the middle-ranked papers did they discover you had already placed first. This was surely fate, yet the minister’s regard for you was most sincere. You should hasten to the capital and not defy his wishes.”

The grand councilor politely declined and departed. Upon returning home and questioning his father, he learned the truth, yet he still did not proceed to the Ministry of Rites examination. Only in the year *jiwei*, the year after Minister He’s downfall, did he enter the capital. That same year, he passed the metropolitan examination and entered the Hanlin Academy.

The Master of the Flower Banquet observed, “With a father of such lofty virtue, his descendants were surely destined for success. Yet when Minister He held power, his influence blazed like fire, scorching all who drew near. How many officials and scholars, eager for glory and favor, did not treat his patronage as the swiftest path to advancement?”

Lu Zangyong once pointed to Mount Zhongnan and said to Simā Qianzhen, who had been summoned to the capital and was about to return to his mountain retreat, “There are many fine places within these peaks.” Simā slowly replied, “From my perspective, it is but the swiftest path to officialdom.” Lu was deeply ashamed.

Yet Xiekui, though but a mere scholar, alone refused to yield to such influence. His moral integrity stood so lofty. For decades, he maintained an unyielding demeanor in court, his conduct unwavering through peace and peril, earning the reverence of all under heaven. Truly, he was one of great refinement, towering above the common crowd. Such was Xiekui!

Even that young woman hastened to repay her great debt of gratitude. Compared to those gentry who betray their obligations, how vast is the difference between worthy and unworthy!

**13. Liu Huiyuan**

*Diligence deserved reward, debts of duty repaid—*
*Clear rewards and punishments command Heaven’s awe.*
*One flaw could not obscure his great virtue,*
*How could a drowned ghost be made a city god?*

Liu Huiyuan, styled Youqing, served as magistrate of Yushan in Jiangyou. Upright, discerning, and diligent, he left no cases unresolved. Unless a litigant was clearly guilty, he did not lightly detain them for trial.

At the time, a tailor named So-and-so was to serve as a witness in a certain case. As the hearing was about to convene, Magistrate Liu departed for the prefectural seat on urgent business. The constables detained both parties to the suit, along with the witnesses, at an inn to await his return.

The tailor’s wife, learning her husband had been taken into custody, grew fearful. She thought, *The magistrate does not lightly detain people—if he has done so, the offense must be grave.* In haste, she took her young son into the city to see him. A sudden flood swept them away, and both drowned.

When Magistrate Liu returned and concluded the case, the tailor returned home to find his family gone—and so he hanged himself. The magistrate remained unaware.

A month later, he again traveled to the provincial capital.

As soon as he boarded the boat, he suddenly rebuked his servants, saying, "Where did that woman in the cabin come from?" They looked but saw no one. When he descended into the cabin, he again demanded, "Who are you? How dare you bring a young girl and child into my cabin without permission?" The servants looked again but saw nothing. The company suspected the boat was haunted and urged the magistrate to change vessels, but he refused.

The boat set off. Magistrate Liu sat with his back to the window, reading. Suddenly, the window collapsed, and he toppled backward into the water, as if pulled by some force. They hastily fished him out, but it was not until three *li* downstream that they recovered his body—precisely where the tailor’s wife and child had drowned.

More than a year after his death, a Daoist at the City God Temple of Yushan dreamed that the new City God had arrived to take office—it was Magistrate Liu.

The Master of the Flower Seat remarked: "Alas! Diligence is a virtue. Yet Magistrate Liu, through his very diligence, inadvertently caused the deaths of three lives and ultimately suffered the consequences himself. As the Book says: *Is resentment ever plain to see? It is the unseen that must be guarded against.* For those in high office, to guard against unseen resentments—how very difficult it is!"

Though those three were indeed wronged, Magistrate Liu had always been wise and upright—yet through a single moment of oversight, he met with such a grievous retribution. Is this not even more unjust? Yet in death he became a deity, and the judgment of Heaven is never in error.

**14. Shen Hongfei**
*Harboring Grudges, Spreading Slander to Ruin Family Bonds—Even in Death, His Boasts Proved True*
*Brother and Sister-in-Law, Both Come to Plead—What Matter Is This, That No Mediator Could Resolve?*

In Wuxing, there was a man named Shen Hongfei, one of three brothers. Hongfei, the second-born, was treacherous by nature. His eldest brother traveled for trade, leaving his wife alone at home. As the youngest brother was still a child, no suspicion arose. Whenever she sent letters to her husband, she would call the youngest to her room to write them, sometimes rewarding him with wine and food for his trouble.

Hongfei had long harbored a slight grudge against his brother and sister-in-law. He falsely accused her of adultery with the youngest brother. He spread the slander to all he met, and soon the vile rumors spread far and wide. Even frivolous men composed *zhu-zhi* verses about it. With no way to clear her name, the sister-in-law ultimately hanged herself.

Hongfei was greatly pleased, believing his sister-in-law had taken her own life out of shame upon exposure of their illicit affair, thus confirming his words—heedless of the unbearable humiliation it brought upon the youngest brother. With no means to clear his name, the youngest soon fell ill from grief and died.

Before long, Hongfei returned from outside. He had just entered the central hall when he suddenly cried out, "Ghosts! Ghosts!" By the time others arrived, he had rushed out the main gate and stood in the middle of the street, slapping his own cheeks and shouting, "Black-hearted villain! You falsely accused me of adultery with my uncle—I hanged myself, yet even in death you slander me, driving my uncle to die with resentment. Now we two have brought our case before the courts of the underworld to claim your life!" Then he struck his own chest, crying, "You were on bad terms with your eldest brother, yet you framed me and my sister-in-law—where was your conscience?"

A crowd gathered like a marketplace. Knowing the spirits of his sister-in-law and youngest brother had possessed him, someone intervened to mediate: "The matter has come to this—what good would taking his life do? Why not have a high monk summoned to perform rites for you both, so you may soon attain rebirth? What do you say?" Hongfei first spoke in the youngest brother’s voice: "I committed no evil in life—why would I need a monk’s rites? If my sister-in-law is willing to let this go, I shall depart at once!" Then he spoke in his sister-in-law’s voice: "What kind of matter is this?"

"Can this even be mediated?" With that, he suddenly bit his own tongue, shredding it to pieces, then seized sharp stones and smashed his teeth until they all fell out, blood streaming down his body. He then leapt up and dashed his head against a stone pillar by the road, his brains splattering as he died.

**15. The Legalist’s Folly**
*He refused again and again to shield his own person—*
*How could he then chase favor as a guest in the yamen?*
*Three days after her hanging, her ghost came to claim his life—*
*Truly a pitiable man, this scholar.*

A scholar from Zhejiang, versed in the techniques of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, traveled to Jiangyou to serve as a legal advisor under a prefect. Once in the yamen, he and his superior got along exceedingly well. The prefect, a formidable official, insisted on personally interrogating all legal cases from the subordinate counties. At the time, a widow surnamed Mou was being harassed by a ruffian. Though she repeatedly rebuffed him, he persisted until, unable to endure the humiliation, she filed a complaint with the county. The ruffian, however, counter-accused her of consensual adultery. The county magistrate, unable to resolve the case, forwarded it to the prefectural court. The prefect, discerning the widow’s innocence, severely punished the ruffian, thus closing the case.

During the trial, the scholar stood behind the screen, gazing at the widow’s beauty with desire. He resolved to take her as his concubine. The widow firmly refused, but he forced the betrothal gifts upon her. Fearing she could not resist the yamen’s power and dreading violation, she hanged herself. Three days after her death, the scholar rose at dawn to find his door still barred. Breaking it open, they discovered him lying on the ground, a knife in hand, his throat slit and blood pooling around him.

**16. The Sin of Speech**
*Words so frivolous they chill the heart—*
*How much worse when traced in ink?*
*Such talent, all misused—*
*Karma self-made, redemption hard to seek.*

Yao Kangming was a younger clansman of my maternal great-uncle. Learned and richly endowed with talent, he had no other grave faults in life, save that his speech was often frivolous and he delighted in using his brush to mock and satirize others. Whenever matters touched upon the inner chambers of others—even if only by suspicion—he would invariably contrive clever connections to shape them into songs and verses. His diction was fresh and refined, and his works were often widely circulated. Yet after repeatedly failing the examinations, and further shunned for his frivolity, no one dared engage him to tutor their children. He eventually died in poverty and starvation, with neither clothes nor bedding at the time of his death, lying in tattered rags teeming with lice. My maternal great-uncle’s family arranged his burial. He left behind a son, who had nowhere to go and was raised by my great-uncle. The boy was rather honest and cautious, giving hope that he might establish himself. Just as plans were made to arrange his marriage, he suddenly died, and the line was thus extinguished. Could this not be the retribution for frivolity?

**17. Elder Hu of the Seal**
*The ringleader’s crime is grave, the coerced’s light—*
*Yet good men bear the name of corrupt clerks.*
*Seven words from the governor moved his heart—*
*"Within the public gate, one may cultivate the Way."*

Elder Hu, father of Prefect Hu Xiangshan, was a clerk in the criminal bureau of Jinshan. He was always loyal and honest, and throughout his life, he disdained to engage in the practice of "raising or lowering his hand" to manipulate cases. When a robbery case occurred in Jinshan, the victim was injured and later died. Over thirty principal and accessory offenders were arrested. At the time, the law was severe: any robber who injured a person, regardless of whether they were the ringleader or an accomplice, was to be executed. As it happened, Elder Hu was assigned to handle this case. Seeing that the thirty-odd men were all impoverished commoners with no livelihood, he could not bear the thought of them being executed side by side. Thus, he drafted a verdict in which only the two who had initiated the robbery and struck the fatal blow were sentenced to death, while the rest were sentenced to military exile. The magistrate suspected the ruling was too lenient, but Elder Hu insisted, "Though this was a robbery, their confessions show they were not habitual criminals. Even the injury to the victim occurred at night, in a sudden scuffle—no blades or weapons were involved. It seems permissible to apply a lighter sentence."

The magistrate, fearing harsh reprimand, said, "If this is questioned, I will be held accountable." Elder Hu replied, "If it is questioned, allow me to go to the provincial capital to answer for the error of leniency." The magistrate, composing himself, said, "If you are still willing to plead for the people’s lives, how could I alone lack a humane heart?" He then submitted the verdict as drafted. As expected, it was rejected, and a new ruling was demanded. Elder Hu again drafted a memorial to uphold the original decision. After three rejections and three resubmissions, the governor became furious, issuing stern reprimands and ordering the case to be brought before him for personal review. He further commanded the magistrate to bring the official seal to Suzhou, clearly intending to impeach him. Terrified, the magistrate blamed Elder Hu. Elder Hu volunteered to accompany him to the provincial capital, saying, "If you meet with the governor, please leave everything to me. If we succeed, it will be your good fortune. If not, I alone will bear the responsibility."

The magistrate thus brought Elder Hu with him to the capital. Upon their audience with the governor, Elder Hu waited outside the yamen gate. The governor rebuked the magistrate for his leniency, his words and tone severe. The magistrate kowtowed and admitted his fault. The governor then asked, "You are newly appointed—who taught you to do this?" The magistrate replied, "The clerk Hu from the criminal bureau." The governor asked, "Did he come with you?"

The magistrate answered, "He is waiting outside the yamen gate." The governor laughed and said, "I had suspected this cunning clerk of taking bribes and manipulating the law—my guess was not wrong. I shall interrogate him myself." He immediately ordered his adjutant to bring Elder Hu in. The governor greeted him with a rebuke: "As a clerk in the criminal bureau, do you not know that robbers who injure their victims to the point of death—whether principals or accessories—are all to be beheaded?" Elder Hu kowtowed and replied, "I am well aware. Yet though the law is thus, there are degrees of severity that must be weighed." The governor grew angry: "Robbers who injure their victims are all the same—what degrees of severity can there be?" Elder Hu answered, "The law refers to hardened bandits of many years, who commit robbery by force of arms and kill their victims outright. In this case, the offenders are all impoverished men who have lost their livelihoods, driven by hunger and cold into the snare of the law. The victim’s death resulted from a fall during a struggle. It would seem proper to apply a somewhat more lenient standard."

The governor’s voice grew stern: "How much bribe did you take from the robbers to dare speak so artfully in their defense? If you do not speak truthfully, I shall have you put to the rack." Elder Hu kowtowed again and replied, "If Your Excellency believes this humble official has deliberately sought to exonerate the robbers, I dare not deny my guilt. But as for taking bribes and bending the law—such conduct has always been beneath me. Not only in this grave case, but even in minor disputes over brawls, I would never betray my conscience."

The governor gave a forced laugh: "If you took no bribe from the robbers, then why do you so strenuously argue for a lighter sentence?" Elder Hu said, "I dare not say." The governor pressed him further. He answered, "It is nothing more than this: within the gates of officialdom, one may still cultivate the Way. Moreover, has Your Excellency never heard the words of Ouyang Wenzhong? *Ouyang Xiu, styled Yongshu, a native of Luling. During the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song, he rose through the ranks to become Grand Preceptor, and was posthumously honored as Wenzhong.* ‘If I seek to spare their lives but cannot, then the dead will bear me no grudge, will they?’"

The governor, hearing this, was taken aback. He then ordered the accused in the recent case to be brought before him for closer inspection. Their demeanor was gentle and welcoming, and at a glance, one could see they were men of virtue. *Virtuous men: see annotation in the first chapter.* His anger subsided, and he asked, *Ji, pronounced "ji." (From the *Book of Han*, "Biography of Wei Xiang"): "to temper one’s severity." (Annotation): "Ji" means to cease. (Note): "Ji yan" refers to the cessation of an angry countenance.* "How many sons do you have?" Elder Hu replied, "I have four sons."

The governor asked solemnly, "What arts have your sons mastered?"
Elder Hu replied, "My eldest son, Lingyi, was fortunate to pass the imperial examination at the upper level. My next three sons are all county students, and my fourth was this year selected by Your Excellency as the top candidate in the prefectural examination."

The governor, with deep respect, said, "This is the reward for your fine conduct within the public sphere! In this case, I shall spare many lives thanks to you, and this also serves as an auspicious omen for your son’s future success in the *Qionglin* feast next year!"* *See annotation: (Tang *Treatise on Selection*): In the eighth year of Taiping Xingguo (983), the imperial examination began to be divided into three ranks, and from then on, the celebratory banquet was held at Qionglin Park. (Note): *Qionglin* as a harbinger refers to the precursor of passing the imperial examination.*

He then ordered them to withdraw and proceeded to review the case as originally determined. Two were executed, while the rest were spared. The magistrate was also reinstated to his original post.

The following year, Prefect Xiang of Mount Xiang indeed triumphed in the *Liwei* examinations,* *To pass the imperial examination is called "triumphing in the *Liwei*."*
while his next three sons were all recommended to the Imperial Academy and entered official service.* *See annotation: (Xuanhe *Catalogue of Calligraphy*): Zhang Hua was first recommended and thus entered official service. (Note): To enter official service is to be recorded on the official register by the prefectural governor.*
His fourth son, a government student, has to this day maintained an unbroken lineage of scholarly distinction.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: “I have often said that if one wishes to do good, one must not only always harbor such an intention but also possess steadfast insight and resolve, so as not to be swayed by power and influence or shaken by dissenting views. In this world, many begin with the finest of intentions—none fail to take the relief of others and the benefit of all things as their aim—yet when confronted with overwhelming authority and personal gain or loss at stake, their initial resolve often wavers. How few among the worthy scholar-officials of past and present have not forfeited their lifelong principles in this way?

Yet Elder Hu, though but a humble county clerk, *Yuan* (pronounced *yuàn*). (See *Han shu: Biography of Jia Fu*): Before Wang Mang became a county clerk, he was appointed to oversee the Hedong region. (Note): *County clerk* refers to a scribe in the county yamen.
held fast to his convictions without wavering. *Nao* (pronounced *nào*, or *niāo* in the level tone): to disturb, to yield.
Though the Prefect’s rank was exalted, and though he was cowed by the threat of severe punishment and overawed by haughty demeanor, Elder Hu presented his arguments with unyielding forthrightness, *Kan* (pronounced *kǎn*). (See *Lunyu* commentary): *Kǎnkǎn* means resolute and upright.
neither yielding nor flattering.” *Not flattering*: not bending to curry favor.

The end result was that his own views prevailed, and the Prefect, too, set aside his stern authority to listen. Extending this principle further, even figures like Zhang Shizhi or Xu Yougong—what more could be said of them?

Zhang Shizhi of the Han, styled Ji, was a native of Yuzhou. Recommended by Yuan Ang, he was appointed Chief Justice and fulfilled his duties with utmost diligence. The court praised him, saying, *"With Zhang Shizhi as Chief Justice, the realm knows no wronged subjects."* Xu Yougong of the Tang, named Hongmin, served during Empress Wu’s reign. When Zhou Xing and Lai Junchen, divining the Empress’s will, vied to outdo one another in framing accusations, only Xu Yougong, in handling cases, upheld fairness and integrity, saving many lives.

Was this not because steadfast insight and unwavering resolve fortified his good heart?

18. Prefect Zhang: *Transforming a Worthless Life*

A life of vice and ruin—
Yet evil thoughts dissolved in an instant, giving rise to a good heart.
Sitting in the snow, silver in hand, awaiting the owner’s return;
Past transgressions pardoned, he was granted rank and honor.

Prefect Zhang was a native of Jingkou. In his youth as a scholar, he was poor and of ill repute, so that people feared him like a tiger. Yet his nature was rather bold and unrestrained; whatever wealth he extorted or seized, he scattered with his own hands. Many impoverished households in his village relied on his aid, and thus his home had no surplus grain. One New Year’s Eve, he could not even light a fire for cooking.

He reflected that his relatives and acquaintances all harbored old grudges, and most were petty, narrow-minded men—none to whom he could turn.

Yet he could not bear to grovel in supplication. With no recourse as dusk fell, he took his wife’s tattered cloth skirt, pawned it at a broker’s for a thousand coins, and bought a peck of rice, wine, meat, and spirit-money. He placed them in a basket and carried them home. His house stood in a narrow alley; the rain had made the path slick. As he neared home, he tripped and fell, spilling everything from the basket. Enraged, he returned with a lamp to inspect the scene and found a bag—heavy in his grasp. Taking it inside, he saw two silver ingots, dozens of taels of silver fragments, over a hundred foreign coins, several hundred copper coins, an account book, and several promissory notes. He realized it belonged to a silk shop. Overjoyed, he thought this windfall would bring modest prosperity. As he prepared to take it inside, he suddenly reflected that it must have been left by a shop clerk collecting debts—without it, the man would be ruined. Better to wait for the owner to return and seek it. So he hid the bag, used some of the loose change to buy rice, and instructed his wife to cook. He then took up a candle and sat outside his door in the wind and snow.

Before long, he saw an old man and two youths carrying a silk shop lantern, searching the path with frantic urgency. Observing them, he knew they were the ones who had lost the bag. As they drew near, he called out, “What are you looking for?” The old man recognized Zhang and, knowing his disreputable ways, dared not speak plainly, stammering and trying to slip away. Zhang’s expression darkened: “You’re wandering about with a lantern, not searching for what you lost—are you casing houses to rob at night? If you don’t tell me the truth, I won’t let you leave!” The old man had no choice but to confess: “I was collecting debts and passed this way. I rested briefly by the roadside, then hurried on in the rain and lost a cloth bag. I’ve come to look for it, but it’s gone—I suppose some passerby picked it up.” Zhang asked what was inside, and the old man listed the silver, coins, and account books in exact detail. Zhang smiled: “Then come sit in my humble home for a moment. I know who found your things.” The old man bowed and said, “If you know, sir, please tell me at once. I wouldn’t dare impose on your esteemed residence.” Zhang replied, “This isn’t something to discuss standing here. My home is right nearby—why hesitate to grace me with your presence?” The old man wavered, reluctant to go, but Zhang pulled him inside.

Once seated, the old man repeated, “If you know, sir, please tell me. My gratitude will be eternal.” Zhang murmured assent. He went inside, brought out tea, and asked what the old man did at the shop. “Collecting debts,” came the reply. “What will you do now that you’ve lost this?” The old man’s tears streamed down: “Even selling my family wouldn’t cover it. I’ll have to die.” He pleaded again, “If you know, sir, please tell me. My gratitude will be eternal.” Zhang murmured assent once more. Suspecting he was being mocked, the old man stood to leave. Zhang laughed: “Sit down, don’t be impatient. I don’t know who found your things. But I have some savings—I’ll repay you myself.” He brought out the bag and asked, “Is this enough to cover your loss?” The old man was stunned. Glancing at Zhang warily, he stammered, unable to speak. Zhang reassured him: “Don’t suspect me! If I wanted this money, I’d have already offered sacrifices to the gods and shut my door to drink my fill. Why would I sit alone in the wind and snow, waiting for you to arrive?” He emptied the silver and foreign coins onto the table: “The silver and coins are still here—the copper I used to buy rice.” The old man, overjoyed beyond hope, kowtowed endlessly. Rising, he urged Zhang to take half. Zhang refused sternly. The old man said, “If you won’t take it, I can’t leave.” Zhang smiled: “If you insist on giving me something, lend me two foreign coins so I can eat my fill in the New Year.” Seeing his sincerity, the old man dared not argue further. He gave Zhang two coins, bowed in thanks, and departed.

Zhang used the coins to buy more wine and dried meat, offering them to the gods and heaven. He and his wife drank together, then slept drunk. In his dream, he was bound and taken away. He saw a kingly figure resembling the Star Lord Wen Chang, who rebuked him: “Your many misdeeds leave you no time to reform—you’ll fall into the realm of hungry ghosts!” As he begged for mercy, someone entered with a document. The king’s expression softened at once: “This act of great goodness atones for your past transgressions. Your official register shall be restored, and you will pass the autumn examinations.”

The king further addressed Zhang: “When you return home, you must humble yourself and reform your conduct. Your future prospects cannot be measured.” Zhang awoke, realizing it was the act of returning the silver that had earned him divine protection. At daybreak, he immediately prepared a memorial and burned it before the Celestial Emperor, vowing to follow the ledger of merits and demerits to atone for his past transgressions.

Before long, the old man from before, now dressed in formal attire, came to express his gratitude: “Had it not been for you last night, my entire family—old and young—would have perished. I have informed my master, and he will surely reward you.” Zhang politely declined. From then on, he redoubled his efforts to do good, yet his poverty grew more severe, often going several days without lighting a fire to cook.

In the middle of the eighth lunar month, when scholars were preparing to travel to Jinling for the examinations, Zhang alone had not a single coin to his name. With no means even to feed himself, he had long abandoned any thought of entering the examination hall. Suddenly, he encountered the old man again, who asked: “Why have you still not gone to take the examination?” Zhang explained his poverty. The old man said: “You are a virtuous man—how can you not attend the provincial examination? Return home and wait for me there.” Zhang agreed. Upon arriving home, the old man soon followed, presenting him with twenty taels of silver: “This is my accumulated savings. You should board a boat and depart at once.” Zhang gratefully accepted. After the old man left, he privately thought that using the silver for the examination was uncertain, whereas keeping it for firewood and rice would secure him half a year without fear of cold or hunger. He was reluctant to go but worried about disappointing the old man. As he hesitated, he heard a knock at the door.

Opening the door, Zhang saw the old man had returned with a young man, who addressed him: “This is my master. Moved by your noble virtue, he has long wished to repay your kindness. Learning you were to sit the examination, he feared your family would lack for daily provisions in your absence, and so prepared twenty taels of silver and four *shi* of white rice as a gift, to relieve your concerns at home.” Overjoyed beyond expectation, Zhang boarded a boat and set off for the examination. When the results were posted, he indeed passed, and the old man again arrived with his master, presenting him with funds for the capital examination. Ultimately, he passed both levels in succession, attaining the rank of *jinshi* and rising to the post of *guancha*.

The Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers remarked: “A single virtuous thought can outweigh a hundred transgressions. From starvation’s brink to the register of official salary—how swift the transformation! Is this not because the Dao of Heaven holds no fixed judgment, but responds only to what one chooses for oneself? Yet Zhang’s ability to act thus also stems from his innate magnanimity, his joy in aiding the poor, and the good roots he has cultivated. How could those litigious pettifoggers, who abet the strong in bullying the weak and haggle over every penny, ever be mentioned in the same breath?”

Nineteen: A Foreign Venture Brings Wealth
Poverty Yet the Foundation of Aiding Others in Need
Sincerity and Thickness Alone Can Move Even the Barbarians
Had He Not Possessed the Elder’s Great Virtue
Finding Gold Tenfold Would Have Been of No Avail

Elder Liu, a native of Shanghang, was sincere and steadfast from youth, incapable of uttering a deceitful word. Though poor, he took great delight in aiding those in urgent need. In his twentieth year, he lost both parents and, with no means to support himself, had a relative serving as magistrate in eastern Guangdong. He resolved to seek refuge with him. Selling his house, he obtained several tens of taels of silver and set out. Upon reaching Jiangxi, he encountered a fellow townsman, who, fallen on hard times and unable to return home, was about to sell his son into servitude. Moved by compassion, Elder Liu divided half his funds and gave them to him.

When Elder Liu arrived in Guangdong, his relative had already passed away, and his wife and children were transporting the coffin home. With no place to stay, he lodged at an inn, finding himself in dire straits. He soon fell ill, and the innkeeper, pitying this young and solitary traveler, arranged for a physician to treat him. Though his illness abated, his purse was now empty, leaving him unable to return home or repay the innkeeper.

Pondering his solitary existence adrift in the world, with nothing to bind his heart, he thought it better to end his remaining years by his own hand. Thus, he left the City of Five Rams. Arriving at a secluded stretch of the Pearl River, he gazed down upon its surging waves and steeled himself to leap. Suddenly, he noticed a radiant gleam upon the riverbank. Drawing nearer, he saw it was a single foreign silver coin. His heart stirred: *"How could there be lost silver here upon the bank? Surely Heaven does not yet wish me dead!"* Recalling that in Guangdong’s *biao* gambling halls, a single stake could yield thirtyfold, and having seen a shop notice announcing three such halls open that very day, he resolved to try his luck. If fortune favored him, he could devise a way home; if not, he would follow the example of the Third Grandee of Chu.

Having deemed this a sound plan, he hastened back to Foreign Merchants’ Street. There he chanced upon an innkeeper, whom he invited to accompany him, and won the stake. The innkeeper said, “Not far from here there is another game.” They went together and won again. Then they entered the city. Half a *li* from the inn, they passed a grand residence where they saw people entering in a steady stream. Drawing near to inquire, he learned that it too was a *biao* hall. He went in with the crowd, staked all he had, and won once more. Three victories in three games brought him over twenty thousand taels of silver—joy beyond all expectation. Returning to his lodging, he told the innkeeper, “I am a solitary, impoverished stranger, nearly reduced to a starved corpse. Thanks to your kindness, I have come by this fortune. I now intend to remain here rather than return east. If I can amass greater wealth, I will share it with you. What business would be best?” The innkeeper demurred, “Wealth comes by fate; how dare I claim credit for Heaven’s favor? If you wish to settle here, two foreign sundries shops are about to change hands. For twenty thousand taels you could acquire one and turn a handsome profit.” The old man followed his advice, entrusting the entire sum to the innkeeper, who proved honest and reliable. Beyond the two sundries shops, he also engaged in *juji*—buying low and selling high—so that every venture yielded severalfold returns. In less than a decade, he amassed hundreds of thousands of taels and came to know every foreign merchant in Guangdong. By nature a man of utmost sincerity, he dealt with others without guile or reserve, never delayed in keeping his word, and was clear-minded and decisive in affairs. Whenever someone faced urgent need, he never refused aid, and foreign merchants all held him in high regard.

That year, foreign goods flooded the market at rock-bottom prices, and every foreign trading house suffered sluggish sales. A certain Guan-family trading house incurred heavy losses, owing hundreds of thousands of taels to its clients. Two foreign merchants from this house had shipped four vessels of goods to Guangdong, but the cargo had languished unloaded for months. Then word arrived from their home country, urging their swift return. They wished to consign their goods to the trading house but feared embezzlement. After deliberation, they concluded that only the old man’s integrity could be trusted. They consulted the comprador, a man named So-and-So who ran a shop next to the old man’s and had once been imprisoned for defaulting on official debts. The authorities pressed him relentlessly, his flesh torn and bloodied, until he was on the verge of selling his wife and daughters to settle the debt. Someone had praised his daughter to the old man, who, upon hearing this, paid the entire sum to clear the official arrears. So-and-So presented the deed and brought his daughter to offer her in gratitude, but the old man tore up the deed and sent the girl home, reuniting the family. So-and-So was moved to the marrow, yet found no means to repay such kindness. When he heard the merchants’ plight, he eagerly urged them to seek the old man’s help, and so they came to his shop to speak with him.

The old man exclaimed in surprise, "Your four ships’ cargo is of immense value—even if I liquidated my entire estate, it would not cover a tenth of it. If there should be any loss, how could I ever repay you?" The foreign merchants replied, "Simply take the goods. Come three years later to collect the payment—how would that be?" Though the old man possessed considerable wealth at the time, he had yet to establish a household. Hearing the three-year term, he frowned and said, "I have no family here. Though I would not, in good conscience, betray another’s trust, the uncertainties of life are beyond prediction. Should some unforeseen misfortune arise within these three years, where would the two of you seek recompense?" Seeing that he could not be persuaded, the merchants turned to their former lodging-house keeper, who managed the old man’s accounts and was trusted by the foreigners, urging him to mediate. After appraising the goods, they valued them at over a million taels, of which only a hundred thousand were paid upfront, the remainder due in three years. A contract was drawn, and the transaction was concluded.

Within two months, war broke out in the West, and no foreign ships arrived, causing the price of imported goods to soar. The old man sold his stock, turning a threefold profit. He consulted with the lodging-house keeper to set aside the principal, using the rest for further trade. His wealth grew daily, and the great families of Guangdong vied to marry into his household. He took a wife, acquired property, and lived in a manner rivaling princes and marquises. Yet he remained ever more sincere, cautious, and generous, bestowing his bounty widely so that many benefited from his kindness.

Five years later, the foreign merchants finally returned. Overjoyed at their arrival, the old man prepared a lavish feast with music and performances, inviting all who had signed the contract and seating the merchants in the place of honor. After several rounds of wine, he raised his cup and declared, "Thanks to the goods from the two of you, I now possess millions. Without your generosity, I could never have attained this. My sales ledgers and trading records from these years are all here. Beyond the original capital, I ask that we divide the profits." The merchants laughed and said, "We had an agreement from the start—profit or loss rests with your fortune and fate, what concern is it of ours? Return our principal, and keep the rest for yourself; do not decline!" The old man insisted otherwise, and they exchanged deferential refusals. The mediator then said to the merchants, "Since Master Liu is so gracious, why not accept interest at one percent per annum on the original sum? It would be only right, and would not disappoint his goodwill." The merchants still demurred.

After several days of deliberation, they ultimately followed the mediator’s suggestion, fully repaying both principal and interest. At once, the foreign merchants all praised Old Man Liu for his sincerity and generosity.

Before long, the Guan trading house collapsed due to insolvency and was sued by the foreign merchants. The authorities sealed its premises and sought a successor to take over, but none could be found. The foreign merchants unanimously recommended Old Man Liu, though he declined, saying, “A foreign trading house requires vast capital—my funds are scattered, how could I reopen it?” The merchants replied, “No matter! Simply register your name with the officials, and we will provide the capital.” Reluctantly, he agreed.

After Old Man Liu took over the house, the foreign merchants flocked to him. In less than a decade, he became the wealthiest man in the province. He lived to over ninety, witnessing the birth of his great-grandchildren. Even now, his family remains one of great prominence.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: “As the world’s customs decline daily, cunning deceit grows while honesty wanes. In dealings with others, not a single word comes from the heart—schemes and treachery shift in an instant, a thousandfold. Even ministers deceive their lords, children deceive their fathers, wives deceive their husbands, until the world becomes a realm of artifice. Those who practice such things believe themselves clever, unaware that they provoke Heaven’s wrath! Yet when one or two men of perfect sincerity appear, spirits and gods secretly aid them, smoothing perilous paths as if level ground, until they ultimately enjoy blessings unmatched in the human world. Men like Old Man Liu are truly worthy of emulation!”

**20. Washing the Inkstone in the Lotus Pond**

The intimacy with a maidservant by the lotus pond was already detestable—
how much worse to stubbornly deny it before one’s mother-in-law!
Too little time had passed for repentance, and the old ways returned;
in sickness, the demand for her life was entirely justified.

There was a certain scholar from Hangzhou in Zhejiang, a *zhusheng*. He studied the techniques of Shen Buhai and Han Fei under Jiang Yiting, possessing minor talent but given to wild and unrestrained behavior. In the year *bingwu*, Master Jiang took up a post in the yamen of Prefect Xianyun Ya in Shanghai. After the autumn examinations, the scholar visited his teacher at the circuit office and proudly displayed his examination essays to his peers.

At that time, a spirit-writing session was being held in the yamen, and the planchette descended, identifying itself as Master Xia Wanru. The scholar inquired about his official prospects, and the spirit wrote in large characters: *“Your future holds great promise, but alas, your sins of speech and lust have exhausted all merit! Reform swiftly, and you may yet prolong your years. Otherwise, vengeful spirits will soon arrive—do you still hope for scholarly success?”*

The scholar laughed and said, *“Does a celestial being now speak like some pedantic old scholar? If you speak of vengeful spirits, pray tell—what is the cause?”* The planchette wrote again: *“Do you truly wish for plain words? Do you recall the matter of washing your inkstone in the lotus pond ten years ago?”* The scholar’s countenance changed at once, and he kowtowed in silent prayer.

The planchette wrote once more: *“The Underworld has reported to the Osmanthus Palace to strike your name from the rolls and reduce your allotted years—thus do I know of it. If from this moment you earnestly repent your past wrongs, you may yet salvage a fraction of your fate. Mere prayers will be of no avail!”*

The onlookers saw the scholar’s face turn ashen. When the planchette fell still, someone asked him what the immortal had revealed. The scholar sighed and said, *“Such frivolous and reckless conduct—how shamefully I have wronged both human and spirit! I tell you this now in all earnestness: may those with aspirations take me as a warning!”*

Earlier, the scholar had once studied at his aunt’s home. His aunt had a beautiful maidservant, whom he had long wished to seduce but never found the opportunity. One summer day, he carried his inkstone to the lotus pond to wash it. Just then, the maidservant arrived to gather lotuses. Seeing no one around, he began to jest and flirt with her. She did not resist too strongly, and they entered a small pavilion by the pond, where they became intimate. Thereafter, whenever they found a moment, they would meet, and before long, the maidservant conceived.

At year’s end, the tutor dismissed the school, and the scholar returned home. When he went to pay his New Year’s respects, his aunt invited him to stay the night. After the household had grown quiet, the maidservant suddenly appeared and said to him, *“I am deeply grateful for your affection. For three months now, my monthly courses have ceased. If you remain devoted to me, allowing me to serve you always as your concubine, it would be your greatest kindness. But if you intend to abandon me, I will not dare to resent it—only, I beg you to quickly find some good medicine to prevent my disgrace from being exposed. I would be forever grateful.”*

The scholar consoled her, saying, *“I have already told my mother of our bond and will ask my aunt for you. I will never do anything so heartless—do not worry.”* The maidservant wept in gratitude, and that night, they once more shared intimacy, unaware that the scholar had no intention of marrying her. Upon returning home, he completely ignored her and never again visited his aunt’s house. The maidservant waited day and night, but all news of him ceased.

Not long after, her belly began to swell, and her mistress noticed. Unable to endure the beatings and torture, she confessed the truth. The mistress, who had always favored the scholar, immediately sent for him and intended to give the maidservant to him in marriage. The scholar steadfastly denied it, saying, *“This wanton maid must have slept with someone else—how dare she defile my name!”* With that, he brushed off his sleeves and left. Believing his words, the mistress subjected the maidservant to even harsher restraints. With no way to prove her innocence, the maidservant hanged herself that very night. The scholar paid it no mind, never imagining that the immortal would uncover his deceit.

When he later recounted this to those who inquired, he devised a way to repent. Many urged him to humble himself and do good, and to invite eminent monks to perform rites for the maidservant’s salvation. The scholar nodded in agreement. From then on, his arrogance gradually diminished.

Yet before a month had passed, his old ways resurfaced. He spoke recklessly, distorting truth at will, and once more indulged in the pleasures of flowers and willows, casting the immortal’s warning entirely from his mind. The following year, he coughed up frenzied blood and died. As he lay dying, those tending to him all saw a woman with unbound hair standing at his bedside—surely the maidservant had come to claim his life.

The Master of the Flower Seat sighed: *“Alas! To wallow in the lotus pond of desire is to be struck from the register of the cassia palace. To forfeit a boundless future for the sins of lust and deceit—how utterly reckless! Having once been captivated by her beauty and led her astray, how could there have been no lingering affection in those entangled exchanges? Yet he sought rare remedies in the quiet of night, swearing oaths of betrayal. Cutting off all tender words in the empty valley, he became the vilest of scoundrels. Worse still, when the truth came to light and she endured the lash without end, the girl confessed all. Though her mistress bent to spare her, he twisted the tale to clear himself of blame and heap guilt upon her. This was not merely abandonment—it was as if he had slit her throat with his own hand! Ah, the pity of it!”*

His heart had perished long before—what need was there for ghosts and spirits to punish him!”

**21. Bao Xunquan: A Life Spared, a Verdict Reversed—How Could Host and Guest Share the Same Dream?**

The example of Heaven’s selection of talent shows that scholarly pursuits need not be pursued with such bitter toil.

My kinsman by marriage, Uncle Bao Xunquan, was in his youth enrolled among the scholars but later abandoned his studies. Mastering the techniques of Shen Buhai and Han Fei, he wandered Jiangxi for over a decade. Though the second month brought apricot blossoms and the eighth osmanthus—signs of the metropolitan and provincial examinations—he had long since cast them beyond consideration.

In the *xinhai* year of Daoguang’s reign, he served as a guest administrator in the Gan County yamen. There, several thieves had already been sentenced to death by the previous magistrate. After reviewing their case, Bao grew suspicious and urged the magistrate to re-examine the matter. It was revealed that they were innocent commoners, framed by the constables. Though he sought to pardon them, the military officers schemed for their release, and the magistrate’s orders were obstructed, nearly swayed by their machinations. Bao, however, argued forcefully on principle and ultimately secured their exoneration.

The following year, in the early days of the *wuzǐ* year, he suddenly dreamed of gazing upon a celestial roster bearing his name. Dismissing it as a springtime fancy, he thought no more of it. Two months later, he dreamed again of the same roster, and this time, someone beside him said, *“The heavenly list is fixed—you must return at once.”* He awoke and again paid it no mind. The very next day, the magistrate arrived to urge him to sit for the examinations.

Bao exclaimed in surprise, *“You and Xunquan have been friends for years—you must be well aware that he abandoned the examination essays long ago. Why do you suddenly speak thus?”* The magistrate smiled and replied, *“I am not unaware that the master has long embraced lofty ideals. Yet on the night before last, I dreamed I was burning incense at the Wenchang Temple when an attendant led me beneath the corridor. There, I saw a long roster hanging on the wall, filled with countless names, each grouped by province and prefecture. The attendant told me, ‘This is the autumn examination list for this year.’ I looked closely at where I stood and saw, inscribed above, ‘Ma of Zhejiang Province, first place,’ while the master’s name appeared among the thirty-some. I thought to myself, ‘The master has never sat for the examinations—how could he be listed?’ The attendant said, ‘This is because last year he resolved the case of the framed thieves; Heaven has specially rewarded him with a place in this examination.’”* Startled, he awoke.

The master, having heard these words and the exact numbers, found them to match his own dream, and though his heart could not remain unmoved, he still hesitated in doubt. As he had long been skilled in the art of *liuren* divination, he performed another casting and received an auspicious omen, which declared, “This augury foretells certain success. As for the travel expenses for your journey there and back, as well as half a year’s tuition fees, I shall bear them all myself—what say you?” Unable to refuse, Bao at last prepared his luggage and set off.

Yet having neglected his studies for so long, he could no longer compose the eight-legged essays. In the examination hall, all three of his compositions were written in *sanxing* style, and the examiners had already discarded them without recommendation. Then, by chance, the chief examiner, finding none of the recommended essays to be in *sanxing* form, insisted on selecting one to meet the quota. Searching through the discarded papers, he came upon Bao’s and, struck by its archaic cadence, ultimately chose it for success. The rank and number matched the dream exactly, though the top scholar was one Ma Yu, while Bao later achieved first rank in the *dati* selection and now serves as a magistrate in a certain county of Min.

Amidst the yamen’s shadows, bribes bought a shared fate—
then came the ghost, blood-drenched, from the bath of death.
Ill-gotten wealth exacts its due without fail;
the corrupt official’s line cut short—how piteous his plight.

Cao Zhiying of Huizhou served as magistrate in a certain Sichuan county. Among his cases was one where a nephew had murdered his uncle. The nephew, wealthy beyond measure, widely distributed bribes. He presented Cao with eight hundred taels of silver, and all confessions and documents were entrusted to the inner staff of the yamen for revision. As they edited the statements, a ghostly voice was heard outside the window, sighing in distress, yet the staff—having also received bribes—remained unmoved. The nephew ultimately escaped unscathed.

Years later, one of the yamen staff died first. At the moment of his death, he saw a ghost, drenched in blood, approaching.

The ghost declared, "You and Magistrate Cao took bribes, allowing the wicked nephew to slip through the net. Moreover, to secure his exoneration, you fabricated charges against me, leaving my grievance unredressed. Now I have obtained the Emperor of the Underworld’s leave!" With that, it raised its hands and throttled its own throat to death. Cao soon followed in death. Afterward, his family’s fortunes declined, leaving only a single son. Upon entering the Confucian school, the son suddenly died, and Cao’s line was thus extinguished.

**23. The Robber of Xuancheng**

Where could the jade flee—his schemes so deftly laid?
Wealth and fame both won, his calculations made.
Who could foresee the debt would come knocking at the door,
A bandit’s vengeance clasped tight to his core?

In Xuancheng, a notorious robber had long plundered with impunity, his gold vast and his gang numerous; none in the garrison dared challenge him. A certain prefect, stern and capable, upon assuming office for less than ten days, devised a plan to capture him. The robber offered a massive bribe, which the prefect discussed with his confidant. The confidant urged him not to accept, but the prefect smiled and said, "If I kill him, where could the jade go?" He took the bribe yet still executed the robber as planned. On the night the robber was put to death, the prefect’s gatekeeper saw the robber enter the residence, unchecked by shouts; though pursued, he vanished into the inner chambers. At dawn, the prefect’s concubine bore a son. When the boy grew up, he ruined the family’s fortune—all knew he had come to collect the robber’s debt.

**24. The Ghost Seizes the Remarried Woman**

Her husband’s murder—how lamentable the deed,
With stolen wealth, she fled to strum the pipa’s lead.
Not for remarriage should her life be spared,
Yet good and evil before the magistrate are hard to guard.

In front of the official residence at Caojing, there lived a woman from a local family. In her youth, she had an affair with a man named Jia, unbeknownst to her parents. A man named Yi, a native of Jinling who had drifted to Caojing for petty trade, married her and took her home. Jia, posing as a relative, frequently visited their household.

Not long after, Yi fell ill. Coveting his death, the woman abandoned him without care—medicines, food, tea, and water, fearing she could not provide them, he languished and died. She then took his wealth and remarried Jia.

A year later, she suddenly fell prey to malaria. With each bout, her former husband appeared to demand his life. Terrified, she secretly fled to her mother’s home, where the ghost never came, and her malaria soon abated. Several years passed, and she remained at her mother’s, too afraid to return. On the Qingming Festival, she went to the City God’s Temple to watch the procession. Upon her return, the malaria flared violently. Her speech became a murmuring babble, indistinguishable. Suspecting delirium from illness, her mother listened closely—her accent resembled that of a Jinling native. Struck by this, she asked, “Who are you?” The sick woman replied, “I am Yi!”

"I suffered humiliation in life at her hands, and in death she took all my wealth to share with her adulterous lover in revelry. Two years ago, I sought to claim her life, but she fled in secret. After years of pursuit, I have finally found her—now I shall not spare her!" With these words, she clawed at her own flesh, leaving her skin torn and blood scattered in disarray.

Neighbors who had once advised her came forth, saying, "Even if you take her life, it will not restore yours. Moreover, this was no premeditated murder—better to invite eminent monks to perform rites for your deliverance." The ghost refused. They then offered to ensure unbroken sacrifices at every festival and season, but again, the ghost would not relent.

At the time, the woman’s son was already several years old. Her mother said, "What if we give this child to you as your own?" The ghost cried out harshly, "What use have I for this mongrel?" From then on, she would tear at the woman’s hair, slap her cheeks, or pinch her flesh. When medicine was brought, she would seize her throat to prevent her from swallowing. At other times, she would strip the woman bare and force her to kneel upon the ground.

Suddenly she would sing, then laugh, then rage and curse with howling shrieks. The torment was beyond all description, and the woman begged only for a swift death. Those who pitied her, when the ghost possessed her body, would ask, "You came to claim a life—why not let her die quickly?" The ghost replied, "When she once wore me down, she made me long for death yet could not have it. So now I make her endure this living torment. When the time comes, I will take her before the Great Magistrate for judgment!" This went on for half a month.

One afternoon, she was unusually calm, and it seemed the ghost had left her. But as dusk fell, her mother, inside the room, suddenly saw the ghost enter from outside, holding iron chains. In the blink of an eye, it vanished—only to possess the woman’s body once more. The ghost cried loudly, "Today the term is up! I’ll chain you and take you before the Great Magistrate!" With her own hands, she seized her throat and died.

Zuohua Master said: "Though a widow’s remarriage may incur a ghost’s resentment, it does not warrant vengeance—vengeance is reserved for those who first harbored murderous intent. During her illness, their bond was already in tatters, devoid of conjugal affection; after death, her hasty remarriage was as reckless as a quail’s flight, leaving behind the unmistakable traces of estrangement and solitude. The wound to the heart, the piercing of the bones—this was far crueler than if he had personally plunged a blade into her belly.

Though I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me."

"A single phrase pierces the heart—thus is the verdict sealed for a thousand ages!"

**25. Silver Hidden in a Plum Tree**

A humble hut transformed in an instant to vermilion gates—
Yet rare is the tailor’s ancient virtue, steadfast and true.
Inscribed upon this painting, the cry of dismay resounds:
Who could have foreseen that a lowly script would mirror Wen Sun’s hand?

Han Shushan of Yunjian, ¹ a man of wealth who cherished propriety, acted without hesitation when righteousness demanded, earning the esteem of his village as a man of virtue. The tale of how he amassed his fortune offers a lesson worth heeding.

Shushan’s ancestors were poor. His father, Old Man Han, worked as a tailor, setting up shop west of Xiuye Bridge. Though his craft was humble, his kindness knew no bounds. One year, as the year’s end approached, a heavy snowfall blanketed the earth. ² At midnight, having finished his work, he was about to retire when suddenly the door knocker rattled violently, as if someone leaned against it. A sigh was heard. Holding up a candle, he opened the door to find a man seated there, clutching a bundle. Upon inquiry, he learned the stranger was a clerk from a Shanghai firm, returning from collecting debts in Zhapu. The hour was late, and he had missed both the last boat and any available lodging, intending to spend the night under the eaves until dawn.

Old Man Han exclaimed in alarm, "Since you’ve just collected debts, your purse cannot be empty—how can you sleep exposed to the elements? Even if nothing befalls you, how will you endure such bitter cold? Though my home is cramped and lowly, it can at least shield you from wind and snow." With that, he invited the man inside.

---

¹ *Shu* (漱), pronounced *shù*. Yunjian refers to Huating County.
² *Yu* (雨), pronounced *yù*, distinct from the word for "rain" in "wind and rain." According to the *Jiyun*, it denotes falling from above.

Seeing the man’s clothes and shoes soaked through, Old Man Han took out his own new garments from the past New Year and had him change into them. He then prepared wine and food, saying to his guest, “This is what I had readied for my hired hands today—just to ward off the cold. Do not think it too meager.” By then, the guest was racked by cold and hunger, barely able to endure; now, welcomed inside with such earnest courtesy, he was deeply moved and could not stop expressing his gratitude.

After the meal, Old Man Han arranged a bed and laid out bedding, and the guest at last settled in for the night. By dawn, the wind and snow had grown fiercer, and no boats could depart. The old man kept his guest, waiting for the skies to clear, providing meals and wine without the slightest sign of reluctance. That evening, the guest said to him, “I am deeply grateful for your noble kindness and have nothing with which to repay you. I’ve heard that grain is very cheap in Yunjian, and shipping it to Shanghai yields a handsome profit. I have surplus funds from my debt collection—allow me to lend you three hundred taels for trade.” The old man firmly declined with solemn dignity, and the guest nodded in acquiescence.

The next day, the wind died down, and Old Man Han arranged a boat for his guest, personally seeing him aboard. Just as the mooring rope was cast off, the guest called out to him again, “The three hundred taels I mentioned yesterday are under the bed. Return home and take them. I will await you at my firm during next year’s Lantern Festival.” The old man, startled, tried to return the money, but the boat had already set sail. With no other choice, he went home to find the gold indeed beneath the guest’s bed. He took it for the time being, and when the New Year arrived, he used it all to purchase grain and transport it to Shanghai.

Upon inquiring at the firm, Old Man Han encountered the guest from before emerging from within. The guest clapped his hands upon seeing him and exclaimed, “You are truly a man of your word!” The old man informed him that he had purchased a certain quantity of grain and transported it there. The guest then accompanied him inside to meet the firm’s proprietor, announcing, “This is the very Mr. Han of Yun Jian whom I met last year—he has brought the grain as promised!” The proprietor expressed his gratitude, saying, “My associate carried a large sum of money and lodged in the open, and but for your noble virtue, he might have met with misfortune. Now you have arrived on time, refusing to take advantage of the opportunity for gain—you are truly a man of antiquity in this modern age!” The old man demurred in modest refusal. The proprietor ordered the main hall to be opened and invited the old man inside, where a lavish feast was prepared as if for an honored guest. After the meal, the former guest was instructed to accompany him on an outing, and upon their return, the old man’s luggage had already been brought to his quarters, where he was invited to stay.

The next morning, the old man presented the grain purchase ledger to the guest, instructing him to unload the rice ashore, as he intended to return to Yun Jian. The guest smiled and said, “The matter of the grain has already been arranged. Stay a few more days—do not rush to leave.” Each day, the guest accompanied him on outings, sparing him from loneliness. After several days, the proprietor once again hosted a banquet, seating the old man in the place of honor. He addressed him, saying, “The grain you brought has already been sold at a considerable profit. I now wish to entrust you with an even greater sum to transport goods on my behalf, and you may take half of the profits earned.” With that, he placed a large ingot of gold before the old man, saying, “This is your rightful share of the profits.” The old man declined at first but ultimately accepted. He then said to the proprietor, “Since you have entrusted me with this task, I shall do my utmost. However, I have a humble request—whether it may be granted, I do not know.” The proprietor replied, “I would be glad to hear it.” The old man said, “I have heard that those who do good will prosper. I wish to set aside two-tenths of the profits to relieve the poor and, wherever there is a worthy cause, to contribute to it. Yet, as I am but a poor man’s son, and the gold comes from you, I dare not act without your permission.” The proprietor agreed and immediately advanced two thousand taels of silver to the old man.

From then on, the old man redoubled his efforts in doing good, and the goods he transported always yielded substantial profits. Within a few years, his wealth grew considerably. He purchased a new residence near Xiu Nan Bridge and sold off its furnishings. As his family prepared to move in, the old man entered the house first to sweep and clean. He noticed a desk drawer filled with scraps of paper and, fearing they might be mistreated, placed a brazier on the floor. As he sorted through them, burning each in turn, he came upon an old notebook resembling a diary, on which was written: *“If you need silver, it lies beneath the plum tree.”* Finding this strange, he looked around but saw no plum tree in the house. Suspecting it to be a jest, he set the notebook aside without burning it.

Behind the house stood several rooms on an upper floor, their staircase rotted and dilapidated. As he removed the old steps to replace them with new ones, the old man—accustomed to frugality and labor—personally took up a broom to sweep beneath the stairs. Suddenly, he noticed a painting of a plum tree on the wall, its branches slanting gracefully, its blossoms and hues seeming to sway. The words in the notebook came to mind, and he realized there must be a hidden cache below. That evening, he gathered his family and, holding lanterns, went to investigate.

Beneath the plum tree, he saw that the ground was paved with flat stone slabs, which shifted easily when shaken. Exerting all his strength, he lifted them away. Below lay four massive jars, filled to the brim with gold and silver, and thus he became immensely wealthy. From that time onward, the old man redoubled his virtuous deeds, and his descendant Shushan upheld the family teachings, engaging in every form of goodness. Shushan’s son, Luoqing, has since passed the provincial examination, while his other sons and grandsons have gained renown in the academies. The rewards they have reaped are boundless.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: *“During my brief travels in Songjiang, I heard the story of Old Man Han in great detail. Though he was not deeply learned in books, his conduct was of the highest integrity. His words always came from the heart, and his actions were never feigned. His love of goodness and joy in giving were entirely sincere, without the slightest trace of reluctance—truly embodying the spirit of one who sees the drowning and starving as if they were his own.”*

Thus, though his arts were humble, Heaven suddenly bestowed upon him boundless wealth. People saw only how easily he obtained it, unaware that what brought him to this was no mere accident.

**26. Uprightness as Divinity**
*A spotless official becomes a spirit—his governance unerring,*
*Sweet melons and hemp flourish where he treads.*
*He scoffs at the Daoist’s idle ease,*
*Yet in dreams, he startles awake to meet Magistrate Xu.*

Xu Yunián was my maternal grandaunt’s brother. A man of vast learning, skilled in poetry and painting, his nature was forthright and unguarded, rushing to aid others in distress as if he could never do enough. He cherished talent above all, and upon witnessing even a single virtue in a person, he would praise them without cease.

Having passed the provincial examination in the *xinsi* year of the Daoguang era, he was appointed magistrate of Huan County in Gansu, later transferred to Dunhuang and promoted to prefect of Anxi. All the places he governed lay at the farthest frontiers. Their people were honest and simple, free from the cunning and litigious habits of the interior. Master Xu governed them with quiet dignity. Lawsuits were judged and settled the same day, with no cases left unresolved. He maintained the strictest personal integrity, and in his spare time, he would summon the most promising scholars to instruct them in composition and refine their literary skills.

Observing the abundance of mulberry trees in the region, he specially hired silkworm-rearing women from his hometown to teach the locals the methods of raising silkworms and reeling silk. Wherever he went, voices of praise arose, and when he departed, the people enshrined and worshipped him as a deity.

He had barely reached fifty when he died of illness in the official residence of Anxi. Earlier, during his tenure as magistrate of Dunhuang, there was a Daoist in the City God Temple who frequently broke the law. Master Xu expelled him from the county. After Xu left office, the Daoist, through underhanded connections, regained his position as temple abbot and resumed his misconduct as before.

One morning, the Daoist awoke, suddenly rolled up his belongings, and attempted to flee in a state of great panic.

Someone inquired about the matter, to which the Daoist replied: "Last night after falling asleep, I dreamed I heard the shouts of attendants and the blare of ceremonial music. Stepping out to look, I saw the new City God arriving for his post, his retinue in perfect order. As I stood peering from the side, I suddenly heard a summons from the hall: 'Seize Daoist So-and-so at once!' Two underlings bound me and dragged me before the City God. Looking up, I saw it was none other than the former magistrate, Master Xu. He thundered in rebuke: 'I once expelled you from this jurisdiction—having observed my departure and sneaked back, you should have conducted yourself properly. Instead, you persisted in your wickedness without repentance. Today I ought to hasten your death, but out of consideration for my recent assumption of office, I shall mete out a light punishment!' He immediately issued a writ and had me flogged. Then he commanded: 'Leave this temple today—do not linger here to court death!' Whereupon the bailiffs drove me out."

As I stumbled down the steps and awoke, the pain in both thighs was unbearable—I dare not stay here any longer!" Thereupon he gathered his belongings and staggered away in haste.

At that time, the people of Dunhuang still did not know of the master’s passing. Later, upon inquiry, it was learned that the day the Daoist saw the master assume office was the very day he passed away in Anxi, his mat exchanged for the final one. Truly, when one is upright, they become a spirit—how could this not be so?

The master’s eldest son, Yanzhi, was married to my paternal cousin and served as a magistrate in eastern Guangdong. His second son, Yuanzhong, currently holds office in Taizhou, Jiangsu, and has earned a reputation for good governance.

The master’s third son, Runquan, and fifth son, Yejin, both passed the provincial examinations in succession and served as officials in the Ministry bureaus. This shows how enduring the master’s legacy has been.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: "During the eight years the master served as magistrate, every post he held was in the barren and impoverished borderlands. Yet he disciplined himself strictly, living without extravagance—his meals never included more than one dish, and he kept no concubines. From his modest salary, he still managed to provide for his relatives. Each year, without fail, he would remit funds from afar before the New Year, sending anywhere from several taels to dozens, adjusting the amount according to the closeness of kinship. Dozens of households among his kin relied on these gifts to endure the winter and celebrate the New Year. His integrity and self-restraint, along with his reputation for good governance, are still recounted by the people of Ganzhou and Liangzhou to this day. That he became a spirit after death, and that his descendants have risen to prominence—is this not only fitting?"

**27. Two Cases of Disaster Assessment**

*Diligence and caution still fail to ensure real relief—*
*How much worse when tasks are left to clerks and underlings?*
*Both lives cut short, yet spare no pity—*
*The official’s warrant was no summons of death.*

County Assistant Magistrate So-and-so awaited his post in Jiangsu. Assigned to act as Assistant Magistrate of Fengxian County, he was placed in charge of the Fourth Tuan Township. At the time, the previous official had died of illness, and his coffin still remained in the yamen. The assistant magistrate, bringing his family, temporarily lodged in the City God’s Temple.

That year, the county suffered flooding, and both tax exemptions and disaster relief were implemented. The prefectural government issued an order for him to survey the disaster-stricken households in his township. Coincidentally, the Provincial Administration Commissioner had also sent an official to the area. The two men, being old acquaintances, soon arranged to live together. Day after day, they indulged in drinking and singing, entrusting the task entirely to clerks, village heads, and local constables. These underlings colluded in fraud, engaging in embezzlement and false claims, so that the impoverished people received no real benefit.

Before long, the assistant magistrate and his wife died suddenly without illness, one after the other. The commissioner’s delegate returned to the provincial capital to report on his mission and died within a month. The assistant magistrate was not yet forty, the age of vigorous service, and had no serious faults—yet he met such a grim retribution. People suspected that his family’s residence in the temple had profaned the deity, provoking divine wrath. But observing the cause of his death, one sees that the netherworld’s punishment lay here, not there!

Again, in the *gengyin* year of the Daoguang reign (1830), the region north of the Yangtze suffered a great famine.

The local authorities petitioned for relief and aid, but the number of registered households seemed suspiciously high, raising doubts in the governor’s mind. He therefore ordered the Jiangsu provincial treasurer to select ten capable and upright officials from among the assistant magistrates and clerks of the prefectures and counties, who would join the local officials in conducting a reexamination. Those chosen for this task were considered the finest of their generation. Yet all followed the governor’s intent, insisting on strict scrutiny. The relief did not reach all in need, and the savings from the disaster fund amounted to tens of thousands of taels.

Only Magistrate Zheng Zujing and one other conducted their reexamination with leniency, thereby offending the governor and forfeiting promotion. Seven of the ten, however, were commended for their meticulous work and received imperial rewards. The following year, all seven died suddenly without illness. Zheng, in recognition of his earlier service in maritime transport, was promoted from vice-magistrate of Nanhui to magistrate of Jiangdu. One of his sons entered the Imperial Secretariat as a *xiaolian* scholar, and the colleague who had joined him in the reexamination remained unharmed.

Another Case of Disaster Verification
During the *gengyin* year of the Daoguang reign, the region north of the Yangtze suffered a severe drought. The local authorities memorialized for relief and aid.

In the twenty-eighth case, a single thunderclap struck three men—
Beating their mother and stealing silver only heightened their crimes.
The vast net of Heaven is ever inescapable;
Sure enough, all three met retribution as if sharing a tripod’s fate.
Before the Confucian Temple’s gates lay the marketplace’s bustle.

In Suzhou, there was a certain Jia who habitually disobeyed and abused his mother, subjecting her to scorn, curses, and beatings. There was also a widow who had saved over a hundred taels of silver, intending to deposit it with a shop to earn interest and sustain her daily life. This was noticed by a certain Yi and a certain Bing, who stole the silver and divided it between themselves. The widow, having lost her livelihood, died in grief. Though all knew Yi and Bing to be the culprits, none dared speak out for fear of their lawlessness. Meanwhile, Jia’s mother was also tormented to death by her son.

All three men served as attendants to the provincial governor. In the summer of the *renyin* year, the barbarian threat loomed ominous. The imperial troops marched from Zhejiang to Suzhou, and the local authorities established a military supply bureau at Canglang Pavilion, adjacent to the prefectural Confucian Temple. Governor Li, arriving on official business, allowed his attendants and servants to rest beneath the great trees before the temple gates.

At that moment, a single crimson sun hung in the sky, vast and cloudless for ten thousand *li*. Suddenly, wind and clouds churned in fury, thunder and lightning surged forth—then, with a single deafening crack of thunder, Jia, Yi, and Bing were struck dead simultaneously.

**Nineteen: The Theft of Silver and Heaven’s Retribution**
*Diligent needlework, heartbroken toil—*
*Years of labor amassed silver in the scores.*
*How could you steal and collude with another?*
*Does Heaven betray the earnest and the poor?*

There was also an elderly widow, a certain Madam Shi, who lived alone, supporting her orphaned child through needlework. When her son grew older, he took up accounting, and his wages were enough to provide for his mother. Yet Madam Shi continued her needlework as before, and so she gradually saved a considerable sum—several tens of taels of silver—which she intended to use for her son’s marriage. Their humble home was cramped, separated from the neighbor’s house by only a single wooden partition. Whenever Madam Shi went out, fearing the loss of her silver, she would bind it to her waist.

One day, she went to Yuanmiao Temple to burn incense. Hearing that the temple was rife with pickpockets, she untied the bundle from her waist and entrusted it to a certain Jia, an acquaintance who ran a rice shop, for safekeeping. When she returned from her prayers to retrieve the silver, Jia’s face changed color. “Who took your silver?” he demanded. The widow was stunned; wailing and weeping, she argued her case. Jia swore to Heaven, calling down curses to prove his innocence. As the two quarreled, a crowd gathered around them, but none could settle the dispute.

When Madam Shi had handed over the silver, a certain Bing, a neighbor of the shop, had witnessed the exchange and was still present in the shop at the time. She pointed to him as a witness, but Bing sneered, “If that’s true, then you’ve truly seen a ghost! I’ve just arrived from Chang Gate—I haven’t even seen your face before. How would I know whether you two are telling the truth?” Upon hearing Bing’s words, the crowd erupted in uproar, all siding against Madam Shi.

The widow, unable to clear her name, returned home in despair and hanged herself. When her son came home and prepared her for burial, he knew nothing of the cause of her death, and in his grief fell gravely ill. As he lay bedridden, he dreamed his mother appeared to him, saying, “Tomorrow at the market square, two men will be struck by lightning—my wrongs will be redressed. The original silver will be returned to you. Why not rise, despite your illness, and go to witness it?” The next day, the son indeed rose, weak as he was, and went.

The sun had just reached its zenith when the sky was suddenly overcast, the wind howled, and thunder crashed violently. Jia and Bing, each clutching a bundle of silver, knelt facing each other and were struck dead. Bing soon revived and told the crowd, “That day, after the old woman entrusted her silver to Jia, he schemed to embezzle it and offered me a thirty-seventy split. We never expected to incur Heaven’s wrath together. The underworld authorities, deeming Jia the instigator, spared me from the death penalty and ordered me to confess before all. They also commanded that the original silver be returned to the widow’s son, but I do not know his name—what am I to do?” At that moment, someone familiar with the matter pointed to the son and said, “Is this not the rightful owner?” The son then claimed the silver before the crowd and returned home. He placed it before his mother’s spirit tablet and wept bitterly, after which his illness vanished as if lifted.

Bing lay bedridden for half a year before he could rise, one arm and one leg broken, crippled for life.

30. Sealing Silver with Red Lacquer
A humble trade in fish he plied,
Yet ever quick to aid the needy side.

Amidst auspicious omens, true treasure found—
Seizing the moment, he sealed silver with red lacquer.

The Yu family of Jiaxing was a great household of the prefecture, owning many properties. A certain Zhu, who made his living selling fish, rented one of their houses to live in. The house stood beside the prefectural yamen, part of the dowry of Madam Yu the Elder. Each year’s end, the old lady would send an elderly woman or a maidservant to collect the rent—not entrusting the task to servants or stewards, so there was no harassment or clamor. Zhu found this convenient and lived in peace, and so it had been for years.

Though Zhu was but a small peddler, his nature was generous and open-hearted, ever ready to aid those in distress. Once in the marketplace, he came upon a man and woman with a child of about ten, weeping together so piteously that passersby were moved. Zhu asked what was wrong, and they replied that they were from Huai’an. Their home had been ruined in a flood, and they had drifted here. Hearing that this year’s harvest was abundant, they wished to return but lacked the means. They had considered selling the wife, but her resolve could not be shaken; selling the child, yet their hearts could not bear parting. At a loss, with hunger gnawing at them, they could only cling to one another and weep. Zhu asked how much they needed to bring wife and child home. “Just two thousand coins would suffice,” they said. Zhu immediately took them home and gave them the full amount. People all mocked him, but such acts of kindness were common for him.

At year’s end, the custom in Jiaxing was to make offerings to the gods. People would often purchase paper silver ingots and place them in baskets. Two men would carry them inside, feigning great effort as if barely able to bear the weight, and say, “Today we’ve unearthed a hidden treasure!” This was taken as an omen of wealth and abundance in the coming year. Yet only the common folk of the streets and alleys practiced this; scholar-official families disdained it and were unaware of it.

That year, as Zhu and his wife had just finished their offerings, Lady Yu’s rent-collecting maidservant arrived. The couple invited her to drink, saying, “The rites are now complete, and the God of Wealth has just come—next year we shall surely prosper. Please drink this *sanfu* wine, and take these silver ingots with you. When you return, present them truthfully to the Lady, and she will not reproach you.”

The maidservant laughed and said, “I have already come twice! The first time was just when you, good sir and madam, were ‘unearthing the treasure’—I dared not disturb you. When I returned and told the Lady, she remarked that at seventy years of age, she had seen gold, jewels, and jade in great abundance, yet never a buried silver ingot. She wished to beg one to refresh her eyes and ears. That is why I have come again, and I shall return it promptly—pray do not begrudge it.”

Zhu smiled and said, “This is but a rustic New Year’s custom, not a true discovery of buried treasure. Where would we find silver to present to the Lady?”

The maidservant’s face darkened with anger. “How truly petty and mean! Would the Lady deceive you over a single silver ingot? You make excuses to refuse me!”

Zhu and his wife vehemently denied having any silver, but the maidservant grew furious. “This house belongs to the Lady, and the buried silver came from it—how dare you claim it as your own? I shall report this to the Lady, and she will send her steward to question you!” With that, she brushed her sleeves and strode off.

Zhu and his wife stared at each other in astonishment. After a short while, the maidservant returned with a message, carrying two silver ingots. She offered them to Zhu, saying, “The Lady knows that those who unearth buried treasure must not use it hastily, for hasty use leads to swift depletion. She now offers two ingots in exchange for one, as an omen that your future business ventures will yield double the profit. Pray do not refuse again.”

Zhu was about to speak further, but his wife signaled him with her eyes and said to the maidservant, “Since the Lady has so graciously instructed us, how dare we continue to conceal it? But first, please drink a cup of wine, and we shall fetch it for you.” She then beckoned her husband outside and handed him a silver ingot, saying, “Quickly melt some sealing wax and mix it with mud to coat it.”

Following her instructions, the ingot turned a deep, dull black, its surface mottled with earthen hues, so that at a glance it appeared to have come straight from an underground vault.

The maidservant was handed the silver, and she said, “We dare not accept the Lady’s principal, but since custom forbids refusal, we shall temporarily receive it, pending your further instructions.” Delighted, the maidservant took it away. Soon she returned, saying, “The Lady has kept the silver to show her descendants! She commands that these two treasures and this year’s rent be given as gifts instead.” The Zhu couple were overjoyed beyond their wildest hopes. Having unexpectedly gained fifty taels of silver, they abandoned the fish trade and prepared to open a small sundries shop for their livelihood. Taking the treasures bestowed by Madam Yu, they drew up a list and went to the silver merchant to appraise them. The shopkeeper, a clansman of Madam Yu’s, saw them and smiled, saying, “With such a propitious star over you, how can you still be doing such petty business?” He returned their silver, gave them ten times the goods in exchange, and would not hear their refusal. Considering the calculation most favorable, they then leased a separate storefront, chose an auspicious day, and opened for business on a grand scale. From the opening day, depositors, investors, and partners arrived in an unbroken stream, overwhelming them with demands. Without spending a single coin, everything fell into place. The goods they stocked yielded profits several times over. Within a few years, their wealth equaled that of the Yu family.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarks: “This Zhu, a mere peddler, was yet able to aid others in distress so generously. His breadth of mind—how could petty, narrow men ever glimpse his shadow? Heaven specially lent the hand of the Yu family to enrich him, causing the young maid’s eyes to blur and mistake paper money for silver. It further led the venerable matriarch to forget herself, regarding her family treasures as mere windfalls. What began as an auspicious omen swiftly became true wealth. The man was extraordinary, and his fortune even more so. Compared to Old Man Han’s plum tree concealing silver, does this not surpass all expectation?”

**31. Seven Cases of Reaping Retribution for Capturing Bandits**

To be a notorious bandit is to deserve the blade;
To scheme beyond one’s bounds is to forfeit life.
A warning to all ambitious men of rank:
Beware the day you cross paths with Nine-Catty Wang.

Many who capture bandits rise in office,
Yet wrongs go unredressed, grievances unheard.
Who could have known that, once his triumph faded,
His son would lose his wits, his line be severed?

Father and son, eager to display their prowess, seized a mighty brigand,
Greed for merit led them to record the bandit’s name.
Who could have foreseen the brave constable would vanish into a fish’s belly?
The verdict sealed, they met a sudden, violent end.

Magistrate’s Clerk Zhao Wen, a man of Li County, was bold and capable but restless and impatient. Considering his post a dead end with no path to promotion, he believed that capturing bandits from neighboring jurisdictions was his surest route to advancement. He spared no expense, hiring informants and pursuing fugitives, netting several arrests—though none were ringleaders.

Now, there was a certain Nine-Catty Wang, a notorious bandit of Zhejiang Province. When Li learned of his whereabouts, he secretly reported to his superiors, obtained a warrant, and crossed into another jurisdiction to apprehend him. Wang confessed at once upon interrogation and was executed according to the law. Li, having captured a major bandit from a neighboring province, was summoned to the capital for an audience. On his way, he stopped in the provincial capital to await his credentials. While lodging at an inn, a fellow official awaiting appointment approached him for a loan. Li entered his room, opened his trunk to retrieve silver, but found the lock jammed. Pressed by the borrower, he wrenched the lock with such force that the contents inside shifted violently. When the trunk finally sprang open, a knife clattered to the floor. Enraged, Li stamped his foot, his shoe flying off, and stomped barefoot upon the ground, shrieking wildly before collapsing.

At that very moment, Subprefect Wang Juru, who was also awaiting appointment in the provincial capital and was Li’s closest friend, happened to be staying at the same inn.

---

Wang hastened to his side and saw that the knife which had leapt out had pierced straight through the sole of Li’s foot and emerged from the instep. He swiftly pulled it free, and blood gushed forth like a spring. Supporting Li onto the bed, he summoned a wound physician, who applied medicine to staunch the bleeding and ease the pain. Though Li could not walk, he ate, drank, spoke, and laughed as usual. Wang stayed with him until evening before returning to his own lodgings.

The next morning, Wang went to Li’s residence, where a servant greeted him and said, “After my master fell asleep, his spirit seemed unsettled. All night, he muttered incessantly—we could not make out what he was saying.” Wang hurried into the room to see Li propped up on his pillow. Upon Wang’s arrival, Li did not stir, and his speech was disjointed. Suspecting illness, Wang urged him to return to his post to recuperate, saying, “Why not go back to your office and rest for a few days before returning to Suzhou?”

Li glared at him and said, “I am a man of Zhejiang—they should arrest me in Zhejiang, not in Jiangsu! If you want me to go, send me back to Zhejiang!”

Li was from Shandong, yet his speech now resembled the dialect of the Jiaxing-Huzhou region—Wang thus knew he was possessed by the spirit of Nine-Pounds Wang. Wang then prepared a boat and sent him back to Zhaowen. Even as he departed, Li repeated to Wang, “If you want me to go back, send me to Zhejiang.” Wang gave a vague reply, then had Li’s family help him into the sedan chair. Only after seeing the boat set sail did Wang return home. Within three days, news of Li’s death arrived.

In Kuaiji, a certain Shi had initially served as a patrol inspector in Guangdong. After repeatedly capturing foreign pirates, he was promoted out of turn to the rank of magistrate and assigned to several demanding posts. Later, he was dismissed from office during the triennial evaluation. His youngest son had always been remarkably bright, earning the epithet “a colt of a thousand *li*.” After Shi returned home, his young son suddenly fell into a state of spirit-induced madness.

Day after day, he knelt and bowed toward the wall, repeating, “This case has nothing to do with me. I had no part in the public affairs of Guangdong.” These two phrases were all he would mutter. When his father questioned him, he would glare and say, “It’s all your fault!” In the end, he died in his madness. Soon after, both Shi and his wife passed away, and the family scattered like stars.

Prefectural Adjutant Wang Boyang—*Adjutant being the title of a vice-prefect*—was serving as acting magistrate of Shanghai. He hired local militiamen to pursue pirates at sea. Among them were a father and son named Zhou, both fierce and skilled in combat. Every time they ventured out, they returned with captives. One day, they reported the capture of twelve major pirates, along with their boat and crew. The Adjutant was overjoyed and immediately interrogated them. The prisoners confessed to being salt smugglers from Fujian and Guangdong. The boat contained several thousand taels of silver, all profits from salt trafficking, with no other stolen goods. Enraged by their refusal to admit to piracy, Wang ordered them subjected to severe torture.

The three wooden restraints were applied in combination—*three restraints being instruments of torture, as in the *Records of the Grand Historian*: "He was clad in a red prison garment and bound with three restraints," referring to shackles for the neck, hands, and feet, equivalent to modern cangues and fetters.* All confessed to being pirates. Yet whether their confessions were true or not could never be known!

The day after the capture, Zhou’s son, seeking to retrieve an item he had left aboard the naval vessel, set out to reclaim it. The warship was too large to enter the harbor, so smaller boats were used to ferry men to and fro. Zhou’s son piloted a lighter to the warship’s side, and in a display of bravado, leapt aboard. After retrieving his belongings, he leapt back down—only for the lighter to be swept away by a sudden crosswind. He lost his footing and fell into the sea. Though rescue was attempted, the tide was ebbing, and he was carried away with the current; neither he nor his body was ever recovered.

The Adjutant, still oblivious, proceeded to close the case as one of major piracy. The prisoners were sent to the provincial capital and executed in pairs. Meanwhile, the Adjutant was promoted for his "exemplary efficiency in apprehending criminals," and the Zhou militiamen were posthumously awarded the rank of garrison commander.

Yet scarcely three days after the imperial edict arrived, the Adjutant died suddenly without illness, his final moments marked by what seemed to be a vision. Though all knew the case to be a miscarriage of justice, none dared speak out. Still, the Dao’s retribution was not amiss!

Between the years of *Yisi* and *Bingwu* in the Daoguang reign, a major case of banditry and official murder occurred in Jiangnan. The culprits remained at large for some time, prompting the higher authorities to offer a substantial reward for their capture. Soon after, reports surfaced that the bandits were hiding in the Li River region north of the Yangtze. The provincial governor and judicial commissioner dispatched an Adjutant and a magistrate to coordinate with local officials in a rigorous manhunt.

Within two months, over twenty suspects were reported captured. Subjected to severe torture, all bowed their heads and confessed. They were executed in pairs in the marketplace. Yet public opinion did not deem the verdict just.

Yet the Adjutant and the magistrate were ultimately rewarded by higher authorities for their success in capturing the bandits. Within two years, the magistrate was assigned to temporarily govern a county in Changzhou. Having assumed office for only seven days, he suddenly died without prior illness, appearing at the moment of death as though he had seen something. The following year, the Adjutant was promoted to prefect of Xuzhou and received his commission to take up the post. Upon reaching Yuanpu, he too died suddenly without illness, also seeming to see something at the time of his death. Both men were in the prime of their careers—barely forty years of age—yet they perished in quick succession, each at the moment of assuming his new post in high spirits. The public found this extraordinary and attributed it to the unredressed injustices of the earlier case.

A certain Military Advisor Jiang, eager to secure a magistracy, befriended a magistrate of Huating who had captured several bandits. The Huating magistrate handed over the prisoners to Jiang and petitioned for his reward. However, the higher authorities found the number of prisoners insufficient to meet the regulations for promotion. Jiang then spent his own money to purchase two more bandits to complete his tally. He was subsequently issued credentials and sent to the capital for an imperial audience, after which he received an edict appointing him as a magistrate. No sooner had he arrived at his lodgings than he suddenly collapsed to the ground. When helped to his feet, his speech was wildly incoherent, as though quarreling and cursing with someone unseen. He died before midnight.

A certain Chief Clerk of Yanghu, a man of avaricious and cruel disposition, first served as an assistant magistrate in Lou County, where he earned the epithet "Blood-Spattered Nun."

Later, when transferred to Yanghu, the escaped convict Zhuang Wuke had long evaded capture. The Chief Clerk secretly learned that Zhuang was hiding in Huizhou and promptly reported this to the Changzhou Prefecture. Under orders, he set out to apprehend him and succeeded in arresting him in the countryside of Jing County. The magistrate of Jing County, eager to claim the merit for himself, offered two hundred taels of silver as a bribe, and so the Chief Clerk relinquished the prisoner. Zhuang was sent to Suzhou and swiftly executed. Not long after, one morning as the Chief Clerk was about to attend the yamen assembly, he suddenly glared into the empty air and rebuked, "Zhuang Wuke is here!" Then he cried, "He has entered!" He rushed into his bedchamber, turning to his family and shouting, "Block the door quickly—do not let him in!" Moments later, he stamped his feet and wailed, "He is inside the room! What is to be done?" He then fled beneath the bed, clutching the bed-curtain with a death grip, shrieking for help. After some time, his breath gave out and his voice grew hoarse. Blood streamed from his seven orifices, and he died.

Another magistrate, from Wujin, had served in Nanhui County during the years *jiyou* and *gengzi*. At the time, the opium ban was strictly enforced, and those caught smoking it were put to death. Local officials who apprehended fifteen cases in a month were immediately promoted. Yuqian, then Governor of Jiangsu, oversaw the campaign with severity.

The magistrate, currying favor with his superiors, reported over a hundred cases within two months. Yu was greatly pleased and petitioned to have him granted the rank of *tongzhi*. The campaign was set for a six-month limit, during which no executions were permitted by law. Yet with so many arrests, the majority perished in prison.

Several years later, the magistrate was transferred from Wujin to Yuanhe and was deemed *zhuoyi*—his governance outstanding. He traveled to the capital for an imperial audience. There, he rode in a five-horse carriage, its crossbar emblazoned with twin bears—a sign of rising authority.

As the boat sailed to Qingjiangpu, the magistrate’s servants in the forward cabin heard him shout loudly, “If you have something to say, speak properly—do not lay hands on me!” At the time, they were aboard a Changzhou pleasure boat, and the courtesans on board had long been intimate with the magistrate, so they assumed he was merely jesting. Soon after, they heard shouts of rebuke, followed by his voice: “Even we do not deserve to die—how could you bear to drive us to our deaths?” Only then did the servants find this strange and rush in together to see. They found the magistrate’s face ashen with fear, his hands and feet braced as if fending off an attack. Once the others entered, he finally calmed, saying, “Fortunate that you came—otherwise, I would have been in grave danger!” When asked what had happened, he fell silent and would not speak. Someone suggested he request sick leave and turn back to Suzhou, but he refused. The next day, they crossed the Yellow River and reached Wangjiaying. Before they had traveled two stages, his illness flared violently. He fell into a stupor, insensible to all around him, and whatever he muttered was filled with rage and contention. His son, who had accompanied him, then resolved to escort him southward, traveling day and night with all haste.

Upon reaching Benniu in Changzhou, his illness had already reached a critical state. Suddenly, he clawed at his own tongue with both hands and died with a great cry.

The Master of the Flower Seat remarked: “Bandits who plunder others’ wealth are not tolerated by the king’s law. To capture and execute them seems, on the surface, without fault. Yet if one truly acts with a heart for the state, rooting out the wicked and pacifying the good, who would say it is not fitting? Or perhaps when local officials charged with apprehending bandits pursue a case and make arrests, they fulfill their duty in office, while the bandits face their just deserts. If bandits die by the law, how dare they bear grudges against the enforcers of justice?

Yet as parents to the people, if officials cannot instruct and provide for their populace, driving them to destitution and banditry, only to then execute them en masse—‘mourn them with compassion, do not rejoice’—even the humane would feel regret. But if the territory is not one’s own jurisdiction, the office not one’s responsibility, the matter unrelated to official duty, and one acts merely out of covetous desire for promotion, crossing borders to hunt and seize—even if the stolen goods are real and the bandits confirmed, a single selfish thought means the bandits, once caught, will bear hatred. How much more so when many cases are false or incomplete, or when names are misattributed?”

Or where the peach withers in place of the plum—its branches collapsing in substitution—where the innocent are framed as bandits; or where petty thieves, mere pilferers and prowlers, commit no capital offense, yet charges are fabricated to ensnare them. Thus the wronged and aggrieved bow their heads to the executioner’s blade. If the dead retain awareness, against whom should they bear their vengeance if not those who seized them as bandits to secure promotion? In the past thirty years, those I have seen rise through such means—while well-wishers still fill their halls, the curses of the dead already linger at their doors. Here I record several of the most egregious cases, setting them down as a warning to those in power.

**Case 32: The Guangping Student**

A steadfast integrity, how could it ever yield to slackness?
Yet for the sake of clover’s trifling gain, he bent his principles to follow.
Perhaps he bore no strange affliction from the start—
but the jailer’s fatal word, once whispered, sealed his doom.

The Guangping student—Guangping, a county name—was an old acquaintance of my father (as the *Record of Rites* says: “When meeting a friend of one’s father, one does not presume to advance without invitation”—here, *father’s acquaintance* refers to a friend of one’s father who shares his aspirations). I dare not speak his name directly. A man of broad learning and literary skill, he was also a master of the Eight Principles of calligraphy (that is, the art of writing. As the *Garden of Calligraphy* states: “The dot is *cè*, the horizontal stroke *lè*, the vertical *dū*, the rising stroke *qū*, the left-falling stroke *cè*, the right-falling stroke *lüè*, the left-upward stroke *zhuó*, and the right-falling stroke *zhé*.” The ancients derived their brush techniques from the character *yǒng*, encompassing the dynamics of the Eight Principles to master all possible strokes). He received government stipends as a student (饩, pronounced *xì*; *to receive stipends* refers to being granted a granary allowance) and repeatedly sat for provincial examinations without success (that is, he failed the provincial exams multiple times).

Impoverished, he took up work as a private secretary, and local officials vied to employ him.

Thereafter he arrived in Piling (Pí, pronounced *pí*; Kunling, that is, Changzhou), where the prefect engaged him to oversee correspondence, and host and guest were greatly pleased with one another. Within a few years, he obtained a teaching position through purchased rank. No sooner had he completed the formalities than he contracted a strange illness. At first it resembled beriberi, then his hands became so cramped he could not move them (挛, pronounced *luán*; as the *Zhengyun* states: “cramping of hands and feet”). Later his head stiffened and his neck bent so he could not raise it at all, as though his body were bound by the Three Wooden Restraints (for the Three Wooden Restraints, see the third entry in the previous “Apprehending Thieves” section), his head encased in a cangue like a criminal in stocks (桎梏, pronounced *zhì gǔ*; as the *Book of Later Han*’s “Biography of Fan Pang” records: “all were bound by the Three Wooden Restraints, their heads encased, and exposed in the courtyard.” By this is meant the appearance of a convict wearing a cangue and chains). The prefect sent him home, and before a full month had passed, he died (匝, pronounced *zā*, meaning “a full cycle”).

In life he had always been earnest and cautious, without major transgressions, yet he suddenly suffered this cruel retribution. People universally declared him ill-fated, unworthy of office. Though he possessed but a single strip of blue felt (as the *Book of Jin*’s “Biography of Wang Xianzhi” relates: “A thief entered his chamber and stole everything. Xianzhi calmly said: ‘The blue felt is an old family possession—you may leave it.’ The thieves fled in astonishment.” From this derives the saying that a teacher’s position is “blue felt”), he lacked even the fortune to enjoy it, instead meeting his end through this strange illness. Moreover, the stipend for his clerical post was meager, and he had family dependents—how could he suddenly amass a thousand taels to purchase a teaching position? People also found this suspicious.

Only years after his death, when the matter was mentioned in conversation with Cao Zhulou, was it revealed that his death was likely the result of karmic retribution. During his time in Piling, he had grown close to a wealthy family of the prefecture. A ne’er-do-well clansman of theirs repeatedly extorted the family with fabricated grievances, leaving them unable to find a day’s peace. When they reported him to the authorities, he was lightly punished, but upon release, his disturbances only worsened, leaving them at their wits’ end. They consulted the scholar, who promised to eliminate the nuisance in exchange for a gift of a thousand taels as a reward (as Ma Zu chang’s poem states: “A thousand taels as a gift for a man’s longevity.” By this is meant the euphemism for presenting someone with wealth).

The scholar firmly refused at first, though he subtly hinted at his desire to purchase a teaching post, lamenting his lack of funds. The wealthy family promptly replied, "If you can rid me of this scourge, I shall cover the expenses for your post." Only then did the scholar consent. He reported the ne’er-do-well’s unlawful conduct to the prefect, who despised local ruffians and immediately conducted a personal investigation, ordering the county to arrest the man and imprison him. The scholar further instructed the county constable to ensure his death in custody. Once the ne’er-do-well was dead, the wealthy family indeed paid the scholar’s expenses, securing him the position of county instructor. Yet within half a year, illness struck him down. Cao and a close relative of the scholar had heard of these events, and they sighed in dread.

The Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers remarked: "Though the scholar was refined and learned, a moment’s error led to his grim demise, and all who heard of it mourned him. Yet the Dao of Heaven is luminous and just—no man may kill with impunity." (These two lines are from the *Book of Han*, in the biography of Yan Yannian, spoken by his mother. As Yan Shigu notes: "He who takes many lives shall himself meet death.")

Such men as the ne’er-do-well, though neither treacherous nor thieving, brought only suffering and burden upon their clansmen. Yet even those clansmen did not truly stand in irreconcilable opposition. One was rich, the other poor; pressed by hunger and cold, the latter merely hoped, by virtue of kinship, to partake in the river’s bounty. (As the *Zuozhuan* states: "In the Zhou’s ancestral covenants, those of different surnames came after." The *Book of Han*’s "Eulogy on the Empresses" says: "When one’s person attains the height of glory, one’s clan gradually receives the river’s moisture." Note: "Clan" is here called "ancestral covenant." To "partake in the river’s bounty" means to seek relief.)

Now, such matters may arise from human sentiment, and the man himself was not one whom royal law necessarily condemned. Yet to wield the dagger against one’s own kin (Zheng Kangcheng and He Xiu debated fiercely, composing the *Mo Shou* on the *Gongyang Commentary*, calling it "wielding the dagger within the same chamber." Note: The phrase "wielding the dagger within the same chamber" to describe intra-clan strife originates here), inflicting the pain of flayed skin (The *Yijing*’s *Bo* hexagram states in its image: "Flaying the bed to the skin portends imminent disaster." Note: The phrase "the pain of flayed skin" to describe personal calamity derives from this. These two lines refer to the wealthy family’s elimination of a threat to their kin), to cast a net across the heavens, and ultimately to cause another’s hands to be stained with ill-gotten gain (脏, pronounced *zāng*. The *Guangyun* defines *zāng* as "accepting bribes." Note: These two lines refer to the scholar engineering the ne’er-do-well’s death).

At last, when that man had been imprisoned and his grievance buried deep, the scholar too fell gravely ill within his tent, his hands contorted and neck broken, his appearance like that of a captive prisoner (俘, pronounced *fú*. 俘囚: a criminal). Was this not what is meant by "using that man’s own Way to return and govern his own body"?

**33. The Delicate Maiden of Wu Gate**

Resentful yet not wrathful—pity her plight,
Two new poems dashed off in idle strokes.
Beware the ruts of old—do not tread them again,
For Gao of Jiaxing is the cart before you.

In the autumn examination of the *renzi* year, Gao of Jiaxing, after completing the three essays of the first session, suddenly inscribed two quatrains in large script:

*"Do you recall the time we stood beneath the blossoms in the moonlight?
Deep in the night, I secretly composed love poems.
This time, as you take the autumn exam, the cold wind bites—
The frost has seeped through my silk slippers, though you know it not."* (First poem)

*"Beneath the deep yellow earth, jade bones lie sleeping,
A desolate gaze back—all fades like mist.
No need to weave another* Record of Passing the Examinations *(The* New唐书·艺文志 *records:* Cui’s *Record of Passing the Examinations in Xianqing* [era], five juan; Li Yi’s *Record of Passing the Examinations*, two juan),
For when the mandarin ducks are embroidered, one becomes an immortal."* (Second poem)

Afterward, he inscribed *"By the Delicate Maiden of Wu Gate"* (吴门: Suzhou) on the sealed examination hall (锁院: the examination compound) in Zhejiang. Upon leaving the hall, he hired a boat and set off for home by starlight, but died before reaching his household. This must have been a case of seduction and abandonment, leading to death with lingering resentment. Yet the verses are "resentful yet not wrathful" (These four characters derive from the *Analects* commentary on "poems that may express resentment"), capturing well the essence of the *feng* poet (风人: poet). Still, to have given herself to an unworthy man and thus become an ill-fated pair (The *Zuozhuan* states: "An ill-fated pair is called an enemy")—how lamentable!

**34. A Certain Chaste Widow**

A Certain Chaste Widow

*"Dare to offer illicit union for mockery—*
*In the years of Yǐ and Bǐng, the crime began not lightly.*
*To grasp the braid was deemed the chaste widow’s chastity,*
*Yet three men under one law—this alone was just."*

This chaste widow was a native of Chen Family Alley in Shanghai. She entered a household as a child bride. Diligent and prudent in her duties, she won the favor of her parents-in-law. In the autumn of the *renzi* year of Xianfeng (1852), she was at last wed. At the time of the cotton harvest, she followed her mother-in-law to the fields to pick cotton. As dusk approached, her mother-in-law, ravenous with hunger, returned home first. The widow, having not yet finished her task, remained alone. A rogue named Jia, accompanied by his followers Yi and Bing, passed by. Seeing the widow’s youthful beauty, Yi and Bing jested with Jia, saying, *"If you can couple with her in the wild, we shall pool our silver and feast you in celebration."*

Jia laughed and said, *"What difficulty is there in this?"* He rushed forward and seized the widow, whispering lewd words. Caught off guard, the widow was terrified and screamed wildly. Seeing no one responded, Jia dragged her to the ground, tearing her skirt. The widow clutched at Jia with her hands, glaring fiercely as she cursed him, her voice growing ever more vehement. Enraged, Jia stuffed a clod of earth into her mouth and tried to remove her undergarments, but the widow resisted with all her strength. After a while, she lay motionless—when he touched her, she was already stiff.

Terrified, Yi and Bing fled, and Jia attempted to escape as well, stumbling repeatedly as he tried to rise, unaware that his queue was still grasped in the widow’s hand. A villager passing by witnessed the scene and alerted her family. Her parents-in-law and husband arrived together, and onlookers soon gathered in a throng.

They seized a rope to bind Jia, only to find his queue still clutched in the widow’s hand, her grip so tight they could not pry it open. Her parents-in-law and husband wept as they prayed: *"Jia, your wickedness has brought this woman to an untimely death. Now that we are all here, you cannot escape. Release her hold on your queue, and we shall report this to the authorities to avenge your wrong and petition for your commemoration as a woman of chastity and resolve."* No sooner had they finished their prayer than her fingers loosened of their own accord. The onlookers all declared that the spirit of the steadfast widow, though dead, had not faltered.

They bound Jia and turned him over to the authorities, then apprehended Yi and Bing as well. All three were tried and sentenced according to the law.

The Master of the Flowery Studio remarked: *"Alas! Amid the wild fields and creeping grasses, violence struck without warning, and she found no path to call for aid. In such moments, to live is to yield, and to die is to resist—had she not held fast to her resolve, how could she have remained unwavering unto death? I have often observed that many learned gentlemen of past and present, when seated in ease, can discourse eloquently on loyalty, filial piety, and the emulation of sages, dismissing the integrity of humble thatched roofs as though it were of little consequence. Yet when self-interest presses upon them, their moral conduct crumbles, and they weep, saying: ‘I would do as they do, but my strength fails me.’ How then do they compare to this widow, who in life remained unyielding through every trial, and in death became a vengeful spirit to slay her assailant? The gulf between worthiness and unworthiness—how vast it is!"*

35. *Elder Fei of the Feng Clan*

The Intendant Zhao’s Clerk Gains the Favor of Governor Fan

*"To model governance on the ways of past dynasties is to ensure titles of nobility for ten thousand generations;
Not for vainglory or favor, but that even a young grandson may one day become a governor."*

During a famine in Jiangsu Province in the Qianlong era, the magistrate of Jiangyin, lacking the art of pacification, drove the people to rebellion—they raised their poles in revolt. The magistrate then reported the uprising as an act of treason. Governor Fan, upon hearing of the disturbance, traveled personally to the scene. Passing through Changzhou, the grandfather of Governor Fei Heting—then serving as a clerk in the Intendant Zhao’s office—accompanied the prefect to welcome the governor at his moored vessel. The clerk was instructed to wait outside. After some time, the governor escorted the prefect out and, catching sight of the clerk, was struck by his appearance. Turning to the prefect, he asked, “Who is this?” The prefect replied that he was a clerk in the Intendant’s office.

By then, the ringleaders and dozens of their followers had all been bound. Yet outside, rumors spread that the charge of treason required the slaughter of the entire city, and the people trembled in terror.

The governor then summoned Fei inside and said, “As a clerk in the Intendant’s office, you must be well-versed in legal precedents. The starving commoners of Jiang County have risen in revolt—by statute, none, young or old, should escape mass execution. What measure would ensure that punishment aligns with both circumstance and guilt?”

Fei replied, “Do you intend to enforce the law strictly, or do you intend to act as a lord for ten thousand generations?”

The governor said, “Explain the distinction between the two, and I shall choose.”

Fei answered, “If the entire city had indeed rebelled, then mass execution would be warranted. Yet in Jiang County, the unrest arose suddenly, driven by impoverished people seeking food—hoping only for a few measures of grain to fill their mouths. They never intended rebellion. To condemn them all to slaughter would contravene the sagely heavens’ care for the common folk. Now that the ringleaders have been apprehended, in my humble opinion, it would be better to apply the statute for bandits who assemble to commit robbery: sentence the leaders to decapitation and public display, and mete out military exile or penal servitude to the rest. This would strike a just balance between circumstance and guilt—an act worthy of a lord for ten thousand generations.”

The governor found his words profoundly convincing and ordered Fei to draft the proposal. One was beheaded, and over a dozen were exiled. Later observers remarked that Fei’s single utterance had saved ten thousand lives, and that his descendants would surely prosper. His son, whose name is not recorded here, rose from the rank of tribute student to serve as Intendant of the Tong-Guang Circuit in Shaanxi. His grandson, Kai-shou, became Governor Fei Heting. Their ancestor was posthumously honored as Grand Master for Glorious Happiness and General Who Quells Might, and to this day, their family remains distinguished. III.6 The Virtuous Merchant Fei
True evidence seized—what defense remains?
Yet the thief’s tale reveals a good man’s intent.
Ten cakes of silver, four strings of cash—
The old neighbor’s gain brought only laughter at his folly.

The grandfather of Intendant Fei Gengting ran a general store dealing in northern and southern goods. Generous and principled, he was known throughout the village as a virtuous man. The poor among his neighbors often came to his home for food. One year, as the New Year approached, an elderly neighbor lingered in the shop after eating, sitting by the counter for a long time without leaving.

The shop assistant opened the cashbox to find ten silver dollars missing. After searching everywhere in vain, all suspected the elderly neighbor. They seized and searched him, and indeed found the money. At that moment, voices rose in a chorus of abuse, leaving the old man with nowhere to turn.

Just then, the virtuous man emerged. Upon inquiry, he said, “You are all greatly mistaken. I took the money to give to him because of his poverty, but I forgot to tell you. How could you insult him so hastily?” Turning to the elderly neighbor, he apologized, “They did not know. Please do not take offense. But you were too slow-witted—why not simply say the money was a gift from me instead of enduring such humiliation?” He added, “You mentioned ten dollars earlier, but that is still not enough. Take another four thousand cash as provisions for the New Year.” The old man then took the money and silver, bowed in gratitude, and departed.

Such was the nature of his conduct. Later, his grandson, Intendant Fei Gengting, passed the imperial examination as *huìyuán* in the *jǐmǎo* year and rose to the position of Grain Intendant of Fujian. The virtuous man was repeatedly honored with imperial commendations, for Heaven’s reward for good deeds is never amiss.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: “The two Fei patriarchs were both registered in Changzhou. Their deeds remain the subject of admiring praise to this day.”

Those who discuss these matters say that Elder He Ting’s single utterance saved ten thousand lives, and what he preserved was of great magnitude—something Elder Gengting could not compare to. Thus, the karmic reward they received also differed in scale. Yet I alone do not hold this view.

Why? Elder He Ting’s words were such that anyone with a sense of priorities could have perceived them. What was truly remarkable was merely his few phrases before the governor—neither provocative nor obsequious, yet tactful and persuasive. As for Elder Gengting’s actions, the thieves had already been captured with the stolen goods in hand; reprimanding them would not have been excessive, while releasing them would have sufficed to demonstrate mercy. Yet he went to such lengths to protect and conceal, even fearing others might still suspect them, and added another four thousand cash beyond the ten dollars. Such a heart—so vast in compassion, so meticulous in care—truly knows no bounds. As Su Ziyou once said to Fan Zhongxuan, “You are a being of the Buddha’s realm!” So too might I say of this virtuous man.

**37. Zhang Mingde**

His manners were but slightly wanton, his levies ever so light—
Yet how his "Bright Virtue" shamed the name he bore!
Demanding payment for the tea he proffered, his heart was far from kind;
Yet Heaven’s Dao has ever balanced good with just retribution.

Zhang Mingde, a household scribe of Huating, was cunning and adept at manipulating documents. Through scheming connections, he became a granary clerk. Once in power, he grew ever more unbridled, acting without restraint. The honest and meek among the villagers were all ruthlessly devoured by him. If anyone bore even the slightest grudge against him, he would immediately ensnare them in perilous legal traps. Thus, his peers all regarded him with wary caution, none daring to oppose him.

There was a runner named Chen Dazhong, a man of upright and forthright character, who alone refused to submit to him. Mingde harbored deep resentment and sought an opportunity to harm him, but for a long time found no opening.

In the spring of the *renyin* year, as the grain transport affairs neared completion, Mingde entrusted Dazhong with several hundred *dan* of grain receipts, instructing him to go to the countryside to collect the commuted payments. At the time, each *dan* was commuted to five dollars and sixty cents in silver. After Dazhong had departed, Mingde reported to the officials and increased the price to six dollars and thirty cents. When Dazhong returned and submitted the payments as previously agreed, Mingde suddenly declared, “This still falls short by over three hundred dollars—could you have embezzled the difference?” Dazhong, enraged, retorted, “When I left, the rate was only five dollars and sixty cents. The sudden price hike in the city—how could I have known?” They parted in bitter dispute.

Mingde ultimately reported to the officials that Dazhong had embezzled funds. The officials detained Dazhong and ordered him to make restitution. Dazhong refused to admit guilt, whereupon he was imprisoned, convicted of misappropriating official silver, and sentenced to military exile in Henan. Dazhong owned several rooms of housing and over ten *mu* of land, all of which he sold to provide for his family and cover travel expenses, having already signed the deeds. When Mingde learned of this, he went to the buyer and said, “Dazhong has embezzled and depleted public funds, so his property should be liquidated to repay the authorities. If you purchase the assets of a criminal, you will share in his guilt!” The buyer, frightened, offered Mingde a generous bribe and sought his counsel. Mingde feigned hesitation and said, “Has the payment already been made?” “Not yet,” the buyer replied. “If not,” Mingde said, “there may still be a way. Quickly bring the deed and the purchase money, and I will submit them to the officials on your behalf. When Dazhong comes to demand payment, direct him to the treasury to collect it—then you will have nothing to fear.” The buyer followed his advice and handed over the entire sum to Mingde. By the time Dazhong was exiled, his family’s property had already been reported as confiscated. Upon hearing this, he could only seethe with resentment and dared not claim the money.

That winter, Dazhong set out for his exile, leaving his wife and children with his wife’s family. As he left the city, his bitter wailing moved all who passed by. At that moment, Dazhong bore an extraordinary injustice, exiled a thousand *li* away, his family scattered like stars. He asked himself when he might ever return home, doomed to carry his grievance to the end of his days. Meanwhile, Mingde, nursing only a slight grudge over Dazhong’s manners, had first secured his conviction and then seized all his assets. Arrogant and overbearing, he believed himself as unshakable as Mount Tai upon bedrock, certain that no one would ever challenge him.

Later, when the Yellow River breached its banks in Henan and the roads were blocked, those sentenced to exile were ordered by decree to return to their home counties to await imprisonment until the waters receded before proceeding.

Dazhong returned to Huating on the twelfth day of the second month in the *guimao* year. He had scarcely spent ten days in the county jail when Mingde’s calamity struck. Previously, in Huating, the silver payment for corvée labor had been burdensome, and the people’s commutation fees were slow to arrive. The grain transport commissioner had first advanced funds to cover the shortfall, and if the amount remained insufficient, the boats would depart while the laborers were detained to await further payment. This practice had been followed for years without error. That year, however, Magistrate Liu had only recently assumed office. Mingde, seeking to coerce him, informed the authorities in advance that the new grain transport could not proceed until the corvée fees were fully paid. When the magistrate refused to comply, Mingde daily incited the transport laborers and boatmen to storm the yamen and clamor for payment. Enraged, the magistrate reprimanded Mingde, who then consumed raw opium in the gatehouse, intending to feign suicide and extort compensation—certain that the magistrate would revive him and seek alternative funds to appease the laborers. The grain transport boats then set sail.

The officials' funds could then be embezzled at will! Mingde then spoke with the gatekeeper. Seeing smoke rising from his beard, the gatekeeper was greatly alarmed and reported it to the magistrate. Enraged, the magistrate immediately ordered Mingde imprisoned. Before he even entered the prison gate, he fell into a stupor, unable to speak. Those who consume raw opium are revived by cold water but must avoid hot tea, which kills instantly. Dazhong, already in prison, heard that Mingde was about to arrive and rejoiced. He had prepared hot tea in advance. When Mingde entered, Dazhong greeted him, saying, "Mingde, have you come here as well?" He then offered the tea. In his dazed state, Mingde drank it at once. As soon as he finished, he collapsed to the ground and died shortly after. After his death, Mingde’s wife and children attempted to carry his body out over the prison wall. Dazhong and the other prisoners refused, saying, "You must first repay the proceeds from the sale of my property and give each of us in this prison a thousand taels of silver." During Mingde’s life, he relied on his cunning and deceit to bully his peers. They all despised him, and Dazhong bore particular resentment toward him.

When he died, none failed to call it a delight, and in the end, no one stepped forward to intercede for him. His son spent twelve hundred taels of silver before the body was allowed to be carried out. For from Dazhong’s counterclaim to Mingde’s death, only ten days had passed. Two months after his death, Dazhong was once again sent into exile. On the eve of his departure, he entrusted someone to record the sequence of events by which he and Mingde had successively fallen into crime and imprisonment, and had the account carved onto printing blocks, which were distributed far and wide to demonstrate the subtlety of karmic retribution.

The Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers remarked: “The subtlety and swiftness of karmic retribution have never surpassed this case. Did Heaven act solely to redress the grievance of one Chen Dazhong? It is only that in Dazhong’s case, the peril and malice were especially conspicuous! Long-concealed schemes eventually ensnare their own architect—like the ‘gentleman in the vat’ or the ‘man with spear and shield.’ From ancient times to the present, the pattern has been one and the same.”

"What benefit lies in treachery?"

38. The Potent Virtue of the Pan Clan
Wealth cannot buy worthy descendants—
Who has cultivated such pious karma?
Fortunate that the eldest son could carry on the legacy,
Riches and honor should endure in unbroken succession.

The Pan clan of Wu Gate was renowned for its virtue through the generations, and Heaven thus greatly prospered its descendants, gathering and nurturing their brilliance. Among them was the Grand Tutor, Duke Wengong, whose rank reached the highest of the Three Dukes and whose person embodied the Five Blessings. The fullness of his good fortune was unmatched not only in recent times but also rare among the ancients.

The origins of his flourishing fortune have been recorded in many other texts, and there is no need for redundant repetition. The Grand Tutor’s eldest son, Gongfu, a cultivated talent, delighted in goodness and was generous in bestowing alms, yet sought no official advancement. Though the Grand Tutor held power in the court for over a decade, Gongfu would visit the capital only every other year to pay his respects, returning home soon after. While residing at home, he refused private audiences with those in power; if they came to see him, he did not turn them away. He was well-versed in discussing local advantages and grievances, yet never sought personal gain from such matters, nor did he return visits in kind.

After the age of forty, he devoted himself earnestly to the cultivation of Buddhist merit. Regardless of status, he treated all with equal courtesy; when those in distress sought his aid, he never refused. He owned several thousand *mu* of land, and while he accepted rent from tenants who paid, he made no demands upon those who could not. Whenever a joyous occasion arose in his family or a year yielded poor harvests, he would waive their rent entirely. His other acts of goodness are too numerous to recount in full.

In my travels to and from Wu Gate, I came to know well of his conduct and principles, and believed that if the Dao of Heaven truly exists, his descendants would surely prosper. In the first year of the Xianfeng era, the Grand Tutor retired from office in his old age. The current Son of Heaven treated the elder statesman with great honor, and Gongfu’s nephew inherited his uncle’s official rank. His eldest grandson was graciously bestowed the title of *juren* by imperial favor. The following year, in the *renzi* year, he passed the metropolitan examination and became a *jinshi*, ranking third in the first class. Thus, grandfather and grandson achieved the highest honors in the imperial examinations, becoming a celebrated tale in the literary world. This was undoubtedly due to the depth of his ancestors’ virtue, as well as Gongfu’s own efforts to perpetuate their goodness through generations. The rise of the Pan family shows no sign of waning.

**Three-Nine Antidote for Arsenic Poisoning**

**Three-Nine Antidote for Arsenic Poisoning**

The essence of practicing medicine lies in saving lives with a compassionate heart;
Extorting wealth at will is never justified.
Nine lives wronged by your greed shall be repaid by yours—
Nine generations fated to die by arsenic, the judgment is clear.

A man of She County, Jiang Zigang, possessed a secret formula to instantly neutralize arsenic poisoning. Yet those who sought his remedy were forced to pay exorbitant sums; if his demands were not met, he would sit idly by and watch them perish. One day, while traveling to a neighboring county to practice medicine, he died suddenly in the night. He appeared in a dream to his host, saying: *"For my obsession with profit, I caused the deaths of nine people. The deceased brought their grievances before the underworld court, where it was decreed that I must suffer arsenic poisoning for nine lifetimes. Now, I am to enter the cycle of rebirth. I bribed the ghostly attendants to pass on this antidote to you. If you save one life with it, I shall be spared one lifetime of karmic retribution. Should you spread it widely to aid the world, your merit will be boundless."*

With that, he wept and departed, lamenting, *"My remorse comes too late!"* The formula consisted solely of one *liang* of *fangfeng* ground into powder and taken with water—no other ingredients were needed. *Strange Tales Worthy of Belief* also records that arsenic poisoning can be miraculously cured by mixing gypsum with cold water.

**Forty: The Magistrate of Yunjian**

A burden borne on the shoulder, set down by the roadside—
To flog him for blocking the path was already perverse.
The dead was but a hired laborer in life;
To demand a life in repayment, the magistrate himself should have died.

A certain prefect, formerly a ministry official, was appointed magistrate of Yunjian. His nature was avaricious and cruel. Whenever he traveled, his retinue would trample all in their path...

From the *Book of Jin: Treatises on Carriages and Attire*: "The outriders and retinue of the *Zouqi* lead the procession." Those who traveled the roads and failed to yield swiftly enough were flogged without mercy. One day, the magistrate was returning from the western outskirts of the city when he encountered a paper merchant carrying his wares on a shoulder pole, standing by the roadside. Enraged that the man had not set down his burden, the magistrate ordered his underlings to drag him before his palanquin and berated him. The man, simple and stubborn, grew indignant and said, "I never blocked the road—what crime is there in not setting down my load?" The magistrate flew into a rage: "What lowly wretch dares defy me so!" He ordered his men to beat the man severely. After the flogging, he had him dragged forward again and demanded, "Do you admit your guilt?" The man replied, "What crime have I committed? I truly do not know!" The magistrate, cruel and obstinate, could not bear to be humiliated by a commoner in the streets. Shame and fury rising, he ordered the man beaten hundreds more times. Blood and flesh flew in all directions, yet still he did not relent. He commanded his men to escort the man to Huating to stand trial for obstructing the road. The clerks and runners extorted tens of thousands of coins from the shopkeeper, but fortunately, the magistrate of Huating, seeing the man’s grievous wounds, did not press further charges. After several days in custody, he was released and sent home. Upon his return, the shopkeeper, resentful of the trouble he had caused, drove him away. The man, already subjected to brutal punishment and now cast out by his employer, hanged himself.

Within ten days, the magistrate’s back erupted in five carbuncles, the pain unbearable. The physicians called this condition "A Hundred Birds Paying Homage to the Phoenix" and said that if the sores did not fester, there might still be hope. One night, he dreamed of the paper merchant lifting his hand to tear at the carbuncles. The agony was so intense that he screamed and awoke, calling for his maidservant to bring a light. The carbuncles had all burst, pus and blood soaking his bedding. Every physician threw up their hands in despair. From then on, whenever he closed his eyes, he saw the paper merchant standing before him. No prayers or exorcisms brought relief. He could no longer lie flat but had to prop himself up, resting his head on the bedframe. The slightest movement sent pain searing through his heart and lungs. Those who saw him said it was a vision of hell itself. He shrieked in torment for weeks before dying. At the moment of his death, the entire yamen saw the figure of the paper merchant in the air.

The Master of the Flower Seat remarked: "When scholar-officials wield power, they often act recklessly, heedless of others’ suffering. Alas! Are not all men of the same kind? How can one indulge such cruelty and call it gratification?"

When blood and flesh flew in all directions, he could do nothing to me. Yet when sores festered and pus overflowed, I too could do nothing to him. I urge all scholar-officials of this world: take heed never to reach the point where you can do nothing to another, only to regret it later."

41. **Heaven’s Thunder Strikes Down a Murderous Plot**

A cunning scheme long harbored in the heart,
To kill for wealth—such deeds are deeply wrong.
The wife, caught in the fields, met heaven’s wrath;
Her husband’s fate must see his crimes made known.

Within the northern gate of Danyang, a family of commoners lived in considerable affluence. They ran a grain shop in front of their home. The four brothers had only one child between them—born to the second brother—a boy of just a few years, raised jointly by all four households and cherished like a pearl in the palm. His bracelets and necklaces, all of gold and adorned with pearls and jade, were worth over a hundred taels. One day, the wet nurse carried him into the shop to play. Suddenly, a woman appeared, bringing cakes and pastries for the child. She followed the wet nurse into the house, claiming to be from Zhoushang in the northern countryside. Her appearance was unremarkable, but her words were quick and sharp.

The household grew quite fond of her, and after sitting briefly, she would leave. From then on, she came frequently, each time taking the child in her arms—sometimes pulling sweets from her sleeve to feed him, other times carrying him through the streets to buy him treats. This went on for months, and the family grew accustomed to it. One day, she took the child away again and did not return for a long time. Everyone assumed she had taken him to visit relatives in the city and thought nothing of it. But when night fell and all was still, the child was nowhere to be found. The entire household erupted in chaos. The boy’s aunt went to the northern countryside, searching village by village, but no one had seen such a woman. Days later, someone reported that ten *li* outside the city, at the foot of a mountain in a deep ravine, a baby lay face-down on the ground. They rushed to the spot and found it was indeed the child—already stiff. Sand and mud filled his seven orifices, and his gold ornaments had been stripped away. Only then did they realize the woman had coveted the jewelry, visiting often to hold the child as part of a scheme to murder him for his wealth. They reported the crime to the authorities, but the woman remained at large. In truth, she was the wife of a farmer near the Seven *Li* Temple. Widowed, she had taken up with a man from a neighboring village. The man was poor, and she provided for him, but when her means fell short, she resorted to theft and abduction to make ends meet. She committed many wicked deeds, but never in her own village, so no one suspected her. After murdering the child, she gave all the gold and jewels to her lover, who sold them for capital and set off to trade elsewhere. The woman stayed behind, and one day, while bringing food to several village women working in the fields, she sat waiting for them to finish eating. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and thunder and lightning surged, swirling around the women’s heads. The others trembled in fear, but the woman remained composed, saying, “Lightning strikes those with guilty hearts. If any of you have done wrong, confess now, and you may escape heaven’s punishment.” Before she could finish speaking, a thunderclap split the air, and she fell to her knees—dead. Meanwhile, her lover was trading far from home, still some dozen *li* away. That same day, wind and thunder seized him and dragged him to the spot where the child had died. He knelt on the ground, unable to rise. A thunderbolt struck his head, and a purple mist coiled around him. Though his mind was dazed, his mouth could still speak, and he confessed everything—his affair with the woman, their thefts, abductions, and the murder of the baby. The next day, he too perished.

The family’s line of descent thus came to an end.

Hearing this, the Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers sighed and said, “The might of thunder is so divine and swift! Alas! Even with such a warning to the people, there are still those who harbor dark schemes and poisonous plots, acting wantonly without fear or restraint—how utterly benighted and insensate they are!”

**42. The Ox-Headed Man**
*Karmic retribution from past lives pursues one in the present;*
*The Mirror of Karma reveals the seeds of disaster.*
*Fortunate to meet a monk midway,*
*One may repent anew and turn the wheel of rebirth.*

In the eastern region of Zhe, a scholar named Wang was strolling through the countryside one spring day when he encountered an old cow in the fields. As it lowered its horns to charge, Wang hurried past, but the beast wheeled around, intent on pursuit, only to be restrained by its herder. Even so, it strained against the rope, stamping its hooves and fixing him with a wide-eyed glare.

That night, Wang dreamed he was seized by a black-clad bailiff and taken to an official bureau, where he stood trial alongside many others.

(Continuing the account:) The term "confronting the record" refers to being called to answer for one’s deeds. Among the plaintiffs—some male, some female—all bore ox-heads upon human bodies, and each accused Scholar Wang of having harmed them. Seated above was an official crowned with coral, his court robes draped with strands of pearls, his attire resembling that of a censor. He demanded of Wang how he had killed so many oxen.

Wang declared that for generations his family had upheld Confucian learning, abstaining from beef and dog meat for three lifetimes—how could he have slain cattle? The presiding judge ordered a green-robed clerk to bring forth a mirror and bid Wang gaze into it. In that moment, he suddenly recalled his past life as a butcher, wielding sharp blades with consummate skill, often slaughtering over ten oxen in a single day. By middle age, he had deeply repented his trade, fearing karmic retribution, and so shaved his head to become a monk on Mount Tiantai. His discipline was rigorous, and at over eighty years of age, he passed away seated in meditation. Yet due to his past sins, he could not ascend to the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.

Once Wang grasped the cause of his former existence, he bowed his head and confessed.

The presiding judge then addressed him, saying, "Since you have transmigrated from the cycle of rebirth as a śramaṇa, do you still retain knowledge of the inner scriptures in this life?" Wang replied, "At the age of twelve, I copied seven scrolls of the *Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* for my parents to dedicate merit to my grandparents in the afterlife. Thereafter, on every new and full moon, I recited the sūtra thrice without fail, even while traveling for examinations or by boat." The presiding judge’s countenance softened as he declared, "If this is true, then the matter is easily resolved!"

Turning to the assembly of ox-headed figures, he said, "Wang has already laid down the butcher’s knife and sincerely cultivated the Buddhist fruit. Though his karmic sins of killing were not yet exhausted, causing him to fall back into the cycle of rebirth, I propose that he now perform repentance rites for you all, allowing him to return to the human realm. What say you?" The assembly assented in agreement.

Wang then vowed to adopt a vegetarian diet for forty-nine days with his entire household, commission five hundred copies of the *Vajracchedikā Sūtra*, and dedicate them to pray for the plaintiffs’ rebirth in the Pure Land. The presiding judge explained this to the assembly, and all were moved with gratitude, joyfully agreeing to release their grievances. The judge then ordered a black-robed attendant to escort Wang home.

Upon reaching his door, he awoke and fulfilled his vow, reciting the sūtra as promised. He also had ten scrolls of the sūtra transcribed in gold ink and distributed them to various temples for veneration. After completing these acts, he dreamed once more of the men and women returning to express their thanks: "By the power of your sūtras, we have all escaped the animal realm and been reborn into wealthy and noble families!" With joy and reverence, they bowed and departed.

**Contents of the Lower Scroll:**

**1. Enduring Slander Without Protest**

A man of humble means yet content in poverty,
His pulse-touched heart repays silver to ease a patient’s woe.
With boundless magnanimity, he stores unseen virtue—
Where else could such a noble elder be found?

The late father of Prefect Wei of Changzhou was a man of generosity and benevolence, well-versed in the healing arts of Qi and Huang. Whether treating the rich or the poor, he devoted himself wholeheartedly, never demanding payment. For those too destitute to afford medicine, he would even donate funds to provide remedies. When villagers traveled to the city for treatment, he would first offer them congee or cakes. Only after they had eaten would he take their pulse, explaining: “Long journeys and hunger disrupt the blood and qi. I give you food to rest briefly so that your pulse may settle. Do I do this out of mere kindness? No—I do it to refine my art.”

Such were his pretexts for doing good. Once, he was summoned to treat a patient who had lost ten taels of silver from beside his pillow. The patient’s son, swayed by slander, suspected the elder of theft but dared not confront him. Someone advised him to kneel at the elder’s gate with incense in hand. Seeing this, the elder asked in surprise, “What are you doing?” The young man replied, “I have a matter to ask but fear your reproach, so I dare not speak.” The elder said, “Speak freely; I will not blame you.” When the truth was revealed, the elder led him into a private chamber and said, “The matter is true. I temporarily used the silver for an urgent need and intended to return it discreetly during my next visit, like ‘restoring the jade to Zhao.’ Since you’ve asked, take it now—but tell no one.” He then counted out the silver and gave it to him.

When the son first arrived with incense, people assumed the elder, known for his integrity, would never commit such a base act. But when the silver was returned, they sighed, “How unfathomable the human heart can be!” Slander spread rapidly, yet the elder remained unperturbed, dismissing it with indifference.

Soon after, the patient recovered and, while tidying his bedding, found the lost silver beneath his mattress. Stricken with remorse, he exclaimed, “The silver was here all along—how could I have wronged such a virtuous man? I must go at once to clear his name before the crowd, lest he bear this unjust stain any longer.” Father and son hastened to the elder’s gate, kneeling once more with incense. Seeing them, the elder smiled and asked, “What brings you here now?” The son, shamefaced, replied, “The lost silver was found. I wrongly suspected you, and for that, I deserve death. Here is the silver you returned to me. Punish me as you see fit.” The elder laughed, helped him up, and said, “It was nothing. Pay it no mind.”

The son then asked calmly, “When I slandered you before, why did you endure the defamation without protest, leaving me so deeply ashamed? Now that you’ve forgiven me, may I ask the reason?”

The elder laughed and said, “Your father and I are neighbors from the same lane, and I have long known his diligence and frugality in managing wealth. When he was ill and heard of the loss of ten taels of silver, his condition would surely have worsened—perhaps even to the point of no recovery. Thus, I chose to bear the stain of false accusation, so that when your father learned the lost item had been found, his sorrow would turn to joy, and his illness would naturally heal.”

The ailing father and son knelt again, kowtowing deeply, and said, “We are deeply moved by your boundless virtue, that you would endure defilement to save my life. We vow to repay this great kindness in our next lives, even as dogs or horses.”

The elder then invited them inside, set out wine, and entertained them warmly until they parted in high spirits. That day, the onlookers stood shoulder to shoulder like a wall, all saying, “The elder’s actions are beyond the comprehension of ordinary people!” From then on, the name of the virtuous man Wei resounded far and wide.

The former censor, rising from the rank of *jinshi*, later became the judicial commissioner of a certain province. Elder Wei reached the venerable age of eighty, repeatedly receiving imperial patents of nobility. Many of his grandsons also gained official positions. Those with discernment said, “Heaven’s dispensation of reward to the virtuous is never in error!”

*Master of the Flowery Seat* remarks: “In the Western Han, Nie Buyi was once mistakenly accused of stealing gold from a fellow official. Without protest, he compensated the loss with his own gold. When the gold was later found, the true owner was deeply ashamed and apologized, yet Nie did not reproach him. Observing Elder Wei’s story, how can one say that the people of ancient and modern times do not measure up to one another?”

**II. The Serpent’s Cry in the Belly**

The viper and serpent take form, crying within the womb—
Drowning daughters has always been a sin most grave.
I wish officials and gentry would heed this plea:
Raise infants, protect the young, and spread their care.

In Huzhou, poor families often practiced the custom of drowning infant girls. My mother once spoke of a relative’s maidservant who, after marriage, gave birth to daughters and drowned each one. Over ten years, she bore seven girls, not one spared. Later, she conceived again, but when the time came for delivery, no child was born—only the sound of a serpent hissing in her belly, heard for a day and a night, until she shrieked and died.

As the *Book of Songs* says: *“The viper and the serpent—these are the omens of women.”* Could it be that the serpent’s cry in her belly was the transformation of the drowned girls’ vengeful resentment?

**III. Saving a Life to Extend One’s Own**

A shared boat reveals deep compassion—
One sees the elder was no sinful man.
The underworld’s messenger, punished for leaking secrets,
Laughs at the burden he bore, no light matter.

At year’s end, Elder Wang of Xiuning was returning home after collecting debts, sailing in a small boat through wind and snow. A man on the shore begged to board, but the boatman refused. The elder alone took pity and allowed him. Once aboard, the man was nearly frozen and starved to stiffness. The elder warmed him with a tattered fur coat and gave him fiery liquor. After some time, the man could speak and kowtowed in thanks. When asked about his circumstances, he said, “I am no mortal—I am the City God’s messenger, sent to collect souls!”

Asked whose souls he was to collect, the messenger produced a register listing thirty-three names, with the elder’s at the very top. Terrified, the elder knelt before him and pleaded for mercy.

The messenger said, “This is by decree of the Eastern Peak; even the City God’s office cannot intervene. How dare I bend the law?” The elder pleaded all the more earnestly. The messenger replied, “Very well—out of gratitude for your kindness in sharing this boat, I shall place your name at the end of the register. You may gain a few days’ reprieve. Return home at once to settle your affairs, and on the third day of the new year, await me at the left of the temple gate.” The elder thanked him profusely.

Soon they reached a village, where the messenger took his leave and disembarked. The elder moored the boat to watch him and saw him enter a household. After a short while, he emerged, and the house erupted in wailing. Recalling the messenger’s words as truth, the elder hastily plied his oars and hurried home. No sooner had he stepped ashore than he saw a man and woman clinging to each other in tears. Upon inquiring, he learned that at year’s end, they had sought to sell the wife to repay their debts, but finding no buyer, they had resolved to die together. The elder thought, *I have but days left—what need have I for silver?* He gave them all the silver he had collected from his debts.

By the time he reached home, it was New Year’s Eve. The following day, on the first day of the new year, he summoned his kinsmen, neighbors, and all who owed him money. Those unable to repay their debts had their bonds burned. Those who had sold their fields but lacked the full price were permitted to redeem them; if they could not, he increased the sum owed.

He said, “Let me not burden those who come after.” Again he called his family together and entrusted them with his final affairs. When this was done, he addressed the assembly: “Today I take eternal leave of you all—let each of us make merry to the full.” Thereupon he set out wine and drank joyously, at ease throughout the day, and only at dusk did the gathering disperse.

On the third day of the new year, he personally went to the City God’s temple to report his arrival. There, at the left of the gate, he indeed encountered the former messenger, whose countenance was grim and sorrowful. The messenger said to him, “You have brought trouble upon me! I, moved by a moment’s compassion, altered the order of your fate. Yesterday the City God, citing your saving of the couple’s lives and the burning of the debt records, memorialized the Eastern Peak. The Eastern Peak replied, ‘This man was already dead—how could he perform such virtuous deeds?’ He commanded the City God to conduct an investigation, and for my leaking the celestial decree and trifling with the law, I have been exiled to Yunnan. As for you, your lifespan has been extended by twelve years, and your descendants’ names have been entered into the register of official emoluments. You must redouble your efforts in doing good. Twelve years hence, I shall meet you here again.” With that, he vanished.

The elder returned home and suffered no further ills. Before long, both his sons passed the district examinations in succession, and his household grew ever more prosperous. Twelve years later, on New Year’s Day, he dreamed once more of the former messenger, who came to announce: “The Lord on High, seeing that since your lifespan was extended you have abstained from killing, released living creatures, and strenuously performed good deeds, has appointed you City God of such-and-such a county. Now that your allotted years in the world of light have come to an end, you shall assume your post. Three days hence, I will come with an escort to receive you.” Upon waking, he summoned his children and grandchildren to his bedside and calmly entrusted them with his final affairs. When the appointed day arrived, he bathed, dressed in his finest robes, and sat upright in wait. Suddenly, faint strains of drums and music reached his ears. The elder said, “The escort has arrived!” Then, with a smile, he passed away in perfect serenity.

The Master of the Sitting Flowers remarked: “This is a tale many in my hometown and among my kinsmen can recount. That a man granted but a few days should, through his goodness, have his life extended—how generous is Heaven’s recompense! And that he should escape the realm of hungry ghosts to receive an office in the netherworld, awaiting his summons in full regalia while music heralds his departure—compared to the howling wind and snow of twelve years before, when he nearly perished in his solitary boat, the contrast could not be more vast. If this be so, what should deter men from doing good?”

Four: Jealousy and Villainy Lead to Wrongful Killing

How could a young maiden bear to lose her way at night?
A moment’s misjudgment—her head was severed outright.
For one person’s sake, four lives were cruelly undone;
The character for "knife" within "jealousy" is no false pun.

There were two clerks, Chen and Zhou, born in the same village, living in the same hamlet, both serving as scribes in the Yuzhou Judicial Commission. Whenever their shifts changed and they traveled to and from work, they always agreed to journey together. That year, as they were returning from their shift, Chen delayed for some business and urged Zhou to go ahead, so Zhou set off alone. He rode a mare, reins in hand, proceeding at an unhurried pace. At a fork in the road, he encountered a young woman riding a stallion, clip-clopping toward him. The stallion, seeing the mare, followed her, and the woman did not notice. As dusk fell, the woman asked Zhou, “How much farther to such-and-such a village?” Zhou, surprised, said, “You’ve taken the wrong road! That village lies to the west, yet this place is fifty *li* away. With night falling and no companion, I fear you’ll never reach it!” Hearing Zhou’s words, the woman was startled and began to weep. “What am I to do?” she cried. Zhou said, “I have a small farmstead about two *li* from here. Come with me for now, and stay the night at my tenant’s house. Tomorrow, you can follow the road to your destination—would that be acceptable?” The woman had no choice but to agree. Zhou then said, “You are a young woman, and I am a lone traveler. My tenant might grow suspicious. Why not pretend to be my relative?” The woman reluctantly consented.

They then hurried together to the farmstead. Zhou said to the tenant, “On my way home from duty, I met my cousin who was heading to such-and-such a village but lost her way. Fortunately, she ran into me, so I’ve brought her here to stay the night. She’ll leave at the fifth watch tomorrow.” The tenant replied, “This rustic dwelling is cramped, with few rooms—I fear we’ll be poor hosts!” He then led the woman inside to a bedroom. Outside the room stood another chamber, where he set up a bed by the door and placed Zhou’s luggage upon it.

At the fifth watch, the tenant rose and called for Zhou, but received no answer. Searching the main hall, he found it utterly still and empty. Carrying a lamp, he entered the bedroom to look—there, the two lay side by side on the kang, dead at some unknown hour. Blood soaked the pillows and mat, their throats slit yet not fully severed. Terrified, the tenant thought to himself, “These two arrived under cover of night, with no witnesses. Better to bury them and erase all trace—then I’ll avoid entanglement.” In haste, he carried the corpses out and dug a pit to bury them.

The next day, he led the mules to the market to sell them. By chance, Chen was returning home and, passing through the market, spotted the mules. Assuming Zhou had already returned, he went to inquire at his house. “He hasn’t come back,” they said. Chen replied, “But his mules are at the market—how can you say he hasn’t returned?” Together, they went to the market and saw the mules were indeed there. Asking where they had come from, they traced the trail to the tenant’s home. After repeated questioning, the tenant could no longer conceal the truth and confessed everything as it had happened.

The magistrate was informed and went to inspect the site, where two corpses were indeed unearthed—one was Zhou, and the other a monk in a narrow-sleeved robe with wide cuffs, his head completely shaven. The crowd erupted in shock and clamor. The magistrate ordered the monk’s corpse displayed in the public square and offered a reward for anyone who could identify him. Someone recognized him as a disciple of a monk from a certain temple, and a warrant was swiftly issued to arrest his master. When brought before the court, the master’s face paled, and his words faltered. Threatened with torture, he confessed the truth: “Last night, my disciple and I were at a certain household performing repentance rituals. On our way back, we passed this spot and heard groans from beneath the ground. We dug it open and found a man and woman, the woman still alive. I intended to conceal her for immoral purposes, but my disciple objected, so I killed him and buried them both.” When asked where the woman was, he replied, “She is hiding in the temple.” Officers were sent to search and found her.

Though the monk’s case was resolved, the killer of Zhou remained unidentified. The magistrate questioned the tenant about who had originally lived in the house. “It was my younger sister,” he replied. She was summoned—about twenty years old and quite attractive. Ordered to be confined in a secure chamber, she was examined at night by a midwife, who confirmed she was no longer a virgin. Pressed to reveal her lover, the woman could not conceal the truth and admitted it was a certain man from the western neighbor’s household. He was arrested that very night, and upon interrogation, he confessed at once. It turned out that he had entered the woman’s room at night and, seeing two people sleeping head to head, suspected her of infidelity. Consumed by jealousy, he killed them both, never imagining his mistake.

The case was adjudicated: the neighbor and the monk were both sentenced to death for causing fatalities through illicit affairs, while the tenant was charged with the crime of moving corpses. The chronicler of these events remarked, “As the ancients said, ‘Lust leads to murder.’ How true!”

When Master Zhou chanced upon that beauty, inviting her to spend the night at the tenant’s home—was this not the most extraordinary encounter of his life? Yet their joy lasted but a fleeting moment before lives were lost in an instant. The man who entered her chamber turned their bed into a battleground, while the one who heard the sounds abandoned mercy for cruelty. Desire flared, and all drowned together in the sea of karmic retribution. A single woman’s straying led to four deaths—how could one not tremble? How could one not take warning?

Five: A Son’s Death and Rebirth
Nine Demons Left by Ancestral Wickedness—
To Ruin a House, Waste is the Sure Path;
Better to Exhaust Wealth in Alms and Relief—
Five Sons Reborn, Their Blessings Overflow

At Lotus Lake, Duke Wang Wenjian’s forebear, a certain elder, once held wealth that dominated the countryside. After reaching his twentieth year, he fathered nine sons in succession, yet all proved dull and slow-witted. In a certain year of the Qianlong reign, famine struck severely, and many bore the gaunt look of starvation. The elder spent his entire fortune to relieve his fellow villagers, saving countless lives, though his own household thereby declined into reduced circumstances.

Before long, his eldest son fell ill and died. Within a year, all nine sons perished one after another, leaving not a single survivor. The couple grieved in bitterness, their minds dazed as if deranged. Having long venerated the Great Compassionate Bodhisattva Guanyin, they composed a memorial, burning it before her image—its words laden with sorrow and resentment.

That night, the couple dreamed that the Great Bodhisattva admonished them, saying: "The nine sons you bore in the past were nine demons—all prodigal scoundrels. Due to a hidden transgression committed by your ancestor, they were sent to ruin your household. Yet because you exhausted your family’s wealth to relieve others, your hidden virtue was vast, and the Celestial Emperor specially commanded the responsible authorities to reclaim those demonic spirits and instead bestow upon you literary men to revive your posterity. If you further cultivate good karma, in twenty years, the Star of Literature shall be born into your family. Do not resent this."

The couple’s dreams were identical. From then on, they redoubled their diligence in doing good, ever cautious and reverent. They aided the imperiled and rescued the distressed, tirelessly striving as if fearing they might fall short. Before long, several of their wives and concubines conceived in succession. Within a few years, they bore five more sons, all of whom studied the classics and composed fine essays, earning renown in the academies. In the next generation, Lord Wenjian achieved the highest honors in the imperial examinations and rose to the rank of Minister. His younger brother likewise...

...both achieved the rank of *huìyuán* that very year, and their descendants have since maintained an unbroken line of official eminence.

**VI. The Palace Examination Scroll Written in Pale Ink**
How perilous—seizing the moment to topple another!
Hard-won imperial words, sharp with rebuke.
Yet pale ink alone sealed the favor of connections,
While master and disciples, brothers in deed, shared equal renown.

When Lord Wenjian Wang and his younger brother Yiwu were students, they had already earned distinction in the academies. The education commissioner, Master Donggao Dou, held them in high regard, and they were known together as the "Two Wangs." After passing the provincial examinations, they sat for the *yǐmǎo* metropolitan examination. Dou, now chief examiner, set the first question on the passage: *"What the people love, the ruler must love."* During his tenure as commissioner, he had visited Huzhou Prefecture to inspect the schools and lecture on the classics, arriving at a unique interpretation of this passage. Now, by coincidence, it became the examination topic. Among all the candidates, only the Two Wangs’ answers aligned with his own understanding. When the results were announced, Yiwu placed first as *huìyuán*, while Wenjian ranked second. Those who failed the examination soon spread groundless rumors.

At the time, Prime Minister Xiang was in power. Disliking Dou’s unyielding integrity and refusal to curry favor, he sought a way to undermine him. Hearing the rumors, he rejoiced and promptly reported them to the emperor.

The Pure Ancestor was swayed and demoted Dou from office, while Yiwu was banished to return to his native place to study. On the day of the palace examination, Wenjian, mindful that his teacher had incurred official censure and been exiled in low spirits, wrote his paper in pale ink, finishing hastily with no further ambition. Coincidentally, Prime Minister Xiang had a former tutor who also passed the metropolitan examination that year. Xiang instructed him, “If you write your palace examination paper in pale ink, you may secure the top rank.” When the papers were reviewed, Wenjian’s was assumed to be the tutor’s and was placed among the first rank. On the day the results were announced, the Pure Ancestor, seeing the pale ink, expressed doubt. Xiang immediately praised it from the side, saying, “For one to write so solemnly and elegantly in pale ink—twice as difficult as using dark ink—he must be a scholar of profound learning.” The Pure Ancestor agreed, and Wenjian was thus selected first. When his name was called as Wang Yixian, the emperor turned to Xiang and demanded sternly, “Was this also the work of Dou Guangnai?” Xiang fell silent, not daring to utter a word. Thereupon Dou’s grievance was fully vindicated, and the groundless rumors ceased.

How extreme it is! The deeds of petty men invariably bring fortune to the noble-minded. Yet petty men only wrong themselves in vain!

**7. Respect for Teachers Rewarded**
*Long attendance at the lecture mat—past karma’s thread,*
*Decades of heart’s blood bequeathed, essays handed down instead.*
*To all you champions who seized the topmost crown,*
*Know this: “respect your teacher” holds the true key’s sound.*

A certain provincial graduate from Zhejiang had, from childhood, been tutored by a renowned teacher engaged by his father. The teaching was rigorous, and the father treated the teacher with utmost reverence. From his first lessons to his earliest compositions, the graduate never changed teachers. When he came of age and became a student of the Imperial Academy, the teacher entrusted him with all the examination essays he had written in his life. He further selected several dozen of his finest pieces, instructing the student to memorize them thoroughly, saying, “All my life’s essence is contained herein. If you encounter these in the examination hall, they will secure you the top rank.” The graduate received them and soon committed them all to memory. Before long, the teacher fell gravely ill. The graduate and his father tended to his medical care with utmost sincerity and care. Upon his death, they prepared his coffin and burial with meticulous attention. They also generously supported his widow and children, providing for them as generously as when the teacher was alive, continuing for years without wearying.

In the year he passed the provincial examination, the elder gentleman dreamed of his teacher coming to express gratitude, saying, “Previously, I entrusted several dozen of my essays to your son. I fear he may forget them over time, so you should urge him to study them diligently—this is how he may repay me.” Upon waking, he asked the graduate, who confirmed it was true. He then recounted the dream and pressed him to continue reading. By the seventh month, the graduate had mastered only six or seven of them. Planning to set them aside for the time being, that very night the elder gentleman dreamed again of his teacher’s arrival, who said, “Yesterday, I saw your son reading my essays late into the night, yet he has not fully memorized them. The examination draws near—you must supervise him closely and ensure not a single piece is neglected.” Upon waking, he reproached the graduate, who, left with no choice, committed them all to memory.

When the examination came, two of the three questions in the first session matched essays from his teacher’s collection. He transcribed them exactly, but one question on Mencius remained. Exerting all his effort for a full day, he composed an answer to rival his teacher’s work, their skill and depth perfectly matched. When the results were announced, he indeed placed first.

The Master of the Sitting-among-Flowers remarked: “As the world’s customs decline, wealthy families indulge in feasting, revelry, and sensual pleasures, spending thousands of taels without hesitation. Yet when it comes to hiring teachers to instruct their sons, they haggle over every penny. Compared to the elder gentleman’s treatment of his teacher, can this not be called loyal and reverent? That he ultimately reaped his just reward was only fitting!”

Eight. The Intendant’s Clerk

A certain man served as a clerk in the provincial intendance, his life a litany of unchecked villainy. Wielding power and twisting law to his ends, he struck fear into both officials and commoners alike. In the provincial capital stood the Hall of Pure Integrity, a refuge for widows with nowhere else to turn. Through backstairs influence, he secured the directorship of the hall. Within a few years, he had siphoned off most of its funds into his own purse, leaving the women within barely enough to survive. His eye then fell upon a young and wealthy nun in a certain convent. He seduced and debauched her, then took her as his second wife. Whenever an official committed even the slightest misstep, he would extort them relentlessly; if his demands were not met, he would entrap them with draconian charges, often driving them to their deaths. His wickedness knew no bounds, its full extent too vast to recount.

He had two grown sons who, witnessing their father’s misdeeds, frequently admonished him. Enraged, he cast them both out of the house to live apart.

In the spring of the *guiyou* year of the Jiaqing reign, the household was struck by *Huilu* (the fire deity, hence "to suffer a conflagration"). The husband, his wife, and their daughter, along with several maidservants and retainers, were all consumed in the flames. Earlier, there had been an elderly servant woman in the household, over seventy years of age, who recited the Buddha’s name and inclined toward goodness. She often disapproved of her master’s conduct. One evening, in the main hall, she saw a man with a crimson face and clad in a scarlet robe—just like the fire deity depicted in statues—and in great alarm, she fled to avoid him. The next day, she told her master, adding, “You should guard against fire.” He rebuked her as delusional and drove her away. Another woman was hired in her place, but three days after entering service, she too perished in the fire.

Every night, the household’s inner and outer doors were locked. When the fire broke out, the family begged to have the doors opened to seek help. Fearing that looters would take advantage of the chaos, he stubbornly refused. By the time officials arrived and ordered soldiers to break down the door, the maidservants, his wife, and daughter had all burned to death. Only he remained alive. The soldiers dragged him out, but suddenly he remembered that important case documents were stored in the upper chamber of the inner building. If they were lost, he would be exiled for the offense. At that moment, the inner building still stood unharmed, so he rushed back inside to retrieve them. No sooner had he ascended the stairs than the wind whipped the flames straight into the inner chamber, burning away the staircase. The officials shouted for help, but those gathered around could find no way to intervene. Soon after, the building collapsed, and he fell into the fire and died. The next day, when his remains were examined, his head, face, and limbs were all charred, leaving only his torso intact—like a scorched log. The retribution was indeed grim!

This fire consumed only the household of this man; the neighboring homes on either side were untouched. His two sons, having moved out earlier, escaped the disaster. Some said, “His ancestors had accumulated hidden virtue, so the retribution fell upon him alone.” The Master of *Zuohua* sighed, “Alas!”

The benevolence of Heaven’s heart may indeed be called perfect! Take this man, for instance—his power relied upon the city walls and the altar of the soil, like the foxes that burrow beneath the ramparts and the rats that nest within the sacred shrine, shielded by the sanctity of their lairs. His crimes had amassed like mountains, and his retribution was nearly more terrible than the burning of the forest, his body reduced to naught but a charred log. Yet his household still had worthy sons to carry on the family line, inheriting the hidden virtue of their ancestors. The homes on either side, though sharing walls, were spared the raging winds and spreading flames. As for the old woman who chanted the Buddha’s name and practiced goodness, she was allowed to witness the calamity from afar, her person untouched by the disaster. When misfortune or error strikes, even the law may grant pardon; how then could misfortune reach the fish in the pond?

"Those who share in evil must be punished—guilt is as indistinguishable as raccoon-dogs from the same mound. Whether spared or not, all depends on what each person has brought upon themselves; how could Heaven be said to take sides?"

**Nine. The Venerable Wu of the Seal**

A governor’s father, a worthy grandson ascends to the lofty halls of the imperial archives—
Yet his trade was but salt and meat, a humble livelihood.
Who could have matched Wu Litao of Suzhou?

Wu Litao of Wu Gate (蠡, pronounced *li*), father of a governor, made his living selling salt and meat. Though he mingled with market traders, he delighted in goodness and gave generously, tireless in his efforts. Whatever remained after providing for his own clothing and food, he bestowed upon the poor, and the villagers all called him a virtuous man. He had two sons, both of whom passed the highest imperial examinations. The elder, named Jun, became a governor; the younger, Shuxuan, served as a departmental official before being appointed chief examiner of the Shaanxi region, later rising to the rank of salt commissioner.

Sun Cihe entered the Hanlin Academy and rose to the rank of expositor-in-waiting. The venerable father repeatedly received imperial favors, a reward for his abundant virtue, it is said.

**X. The Incense Shop**

Cast out by dog, kept by man—
A petty gain sought, wrath from the gods began.
Had the husband heeded not his wife’s plea,
No cause would explain her death and his ruin’s decree.

In Wuxing, a certain couple ran an incense shop. One day, as they dried incense in an open space outside their door, a dog urinated upon it. A neighbor informed the husband, who wished to discard the tainted goods. The wife, however, mindful of their capital, insisted they keep it. Persuaded by her words, the husband mixed the soiled incense with the good and sold it all within days. Before two months had passed, their shop was consumed by fire. It was the height of summer, and the wife was bathing in an upper chamber when the flames took her. After the fire subsided, only a single foot of her remains could be found; the rest had turned to ash. Those who understood such matters deemed it retribution for defiling the sacred.

**XI. Three Accounts of Usurious Exploitation**

Wealth amassed through usury seems secure,
Yet in twenty years, how many fields endure?
A son born to squander gold like dust—
Can greed’s riches ever long outlast trust?

In times of flood and drought, when famine reigns,
A single peck of grain buys boundless plains.
Nearing seventy, a profligate heir appears—
Who then can say man’s schemes outlast heaven’s years?

Jiang Yuanlong, a native of Zhangyan in Jinshan, grew wealthy through diligent tillage. Much of his land was acquired through shrewd calculation. He also lent at exorbitant interest, watching for those with fine fields or estates who had fallen into hardship, then offering them loans. The interest was steep; those who defaulted faced compounding debts, and when repayment became impossible, he seized their property. Thus, through accumulation, he acquired thousands of *mu* of land within twenty years.

Later, Jiang bore a son named Dezhang, who took no interest in the family’s livelihood or estate. Scarcely had he reached twenty when he made gambling and dissipation his sole pursuits. Each time he ventured out, he carried several deeds of his fields as stakes, often wagering a single deed for ten taels of silver. When his silver ran out at the gaming table, he would return the next day to sign the contract—only for his opponent to deceive him, saying, “Did you not borrow fifty taels from me yesterday? How could you forget so soon?” Without protest, Dezhang would draw up a contract for fifty taels and hand it over. Seeing how easily he was duped, others swarmed to cheat him. Within a decade, he squandered his entire inheritance and died.

At Huangyan Bridge in Danyang, there lived a man named Zhou Shengzhang, whose family had modest means. In a certain year of the Qianlong reign, the wheat harvest was abundant, and the price of wheat fell to two hundred *wen* per *shi*. Shengzhang owned a hundred *mu* of land, yielding twice the usual harvest. In Danyang and Jintan counties, people relied on wheat as their staple. That year, Shengzhang encountered several windfalls and hoarded nearly four thousand *shi* of wheat. The following year brought famine; not a grain was reaped in spring or autumn, and both rice and wheat soared in price. Shengzhang kept his granaries sealed, refusing to sell. That winter, the Grand Canal ran shallow, halting merchant traffic, and wheat seed nearly vanished—save for Shengzhang’s hoard. The villagers of the surrounding hamlets came begging for loans. At first, he refused, but after repeated pleas, he agreed to exchange one *shi* of wheat—mixed with chaff and husks—for one *mu* of land. When his wheat was exhausted, the contracts filled his chests, and he had acquired five thousand *mu*. By nature frugal and skilled in accumulation, within a few years his fields exceeded ten thousand *mu*, and his gold and silver piled like mountains. Yet he had no heir. After countless prayers, in his old age he finally fathered a son. Born when he was sixty-eight, the child was named Liu Ba. Before Liu Ba turned ten, Shengzhang died. As he grew older, he treated gold and silver as dirt. Each outing required heavy purses, which he emptied before returning home. If on some days he had nothing to spend, he would fling the coins into the field ridges.

At the time, the community granary system was in effect, and the wealthiest man in each village was appointed as its steward. Liu Ba was thus entrusted with the role. The villagers, taking advantage of his youth and folly, borrowed grain from the granary, then colluded to default on repayment each autumn, leaving him to cover endless losses. Fond of gambling, he would wager a thousand taels in a single throw. As his family’s fortunes dwindled, he sold off his estates—so hastily that contracts were not even drafted, and deeds were carved onto wooden blocks for sale. By the time he died, he had not a single rafter of a house or a *mu* of land to his name.

When my father served as magistrate’s clerk in Danyang, Liu Ba’s son had no means of survival and was reduced to serving as a gatekeeper to eke out a living. To this day, when the villagers speak of prodigal sons, they curse them as “Liu Ba.”

Zhao Yankui was a native of Caojing in Huating. He amassed his fortune through the illicit salt trade and tyrannized his village. A man of the Yu clan, quite wealthy, resided in Zhangjiasha while maintaining over ten bays of houses in Caojing. Yankui coveted them. Yu had an orphaned grandson, young and dissolute. Yankui instructed his son, Song, to entice the youth into debauchery and gambling. When the grandson had no funds, Yankui lent him tens of thousands, demanding the house deeds as collateral. Within a year, the houses became his. He then invested heavily in renovations, completing them in the fourth month of the *gengxu* year. The mansion, resplendent and grand, stood as a veritable manor. That autumn, the authorities, branding Yankui a ringleader of illicit salt traffickers, pursued him relentlessly. Some proposed leniency through surrender. Yankui thus turned himself in and was enlisted as a patrol officer.

Having thus overzealously pursued the suppression of illicit salt, his former henchmen—once his claws and fangs—all turned into bitter enemies. They gathered in force and tore down his house. The fruits of years of extortion vanished in an instant, leaving only a heap of rubble.

Alas! What profit was there in it?

XII. White Cloud Hermitage

In drunken revelry, he stumbled before the god,
Foolishly seeking an auspicious lot for imperial exams.
Cursing the deity, he provoked divine wrath—
Through all three sessions, he toiled like a silkworm in spring.

By the lake in my Hangzhou stands White Cloud Hermitage, where the Old Man Under the Moon is enshrined. Its oracle slips draw from classics, histories, and even fine lines of poetry and song. For those seeking success in examinations or marriage, its responses are as swift as an echo. Thus, during the provincial examinations, scholars flocked to pray for divination slips.

A certain Qian, a student of the imperial academy, was arrogant in his talent and unrestrained in conduct. Before the *xinmao* examinations, he toured the lake with friends. After heavy drinking, emboldened by wine, he visited the Old Man’s shrine to draw a slip—only to receive an unfavorable response. He laughed, “How could I not pass?” and drew again, only to receive the same. Enraged, he cried, “Your answers are irrelevant! How can you claim to be efficacious?” He then hurled vulgar insults at the shrine. Finally, he declared, “I’ll draw one more. If it still doesn’t suit me, I’ll smash your statue!” The slip he drew read:

*Enough, enough, enough—
Like a spring silkworm spinning its cocoon,
Till death, it draws out its thread.*

His companions, aghast, knew he had provoked divine wrath and urged him to leave. That autumn, during the third session of the examinations, Qian entered the latrine. Suddenly, as if seized by something, he shrieked and staggered out. Returning to his cell, he sat in silence. When the proctor heard no sound, he lifted the curtain—only to find Qian dead. Though the cause remains unknown, his audacity in insulting the deity revealed his lifelong recklessness. The Old Man Under the Moon’s numinous power is truly fearsome!

XIII. Madame Yan

She dared to open the granary to relieve famine,
Relying on all to distribute aid justly.
When guilt came, she bore it alone—
Willing to ruin her estate to replenish the public store.

Governor Yan Jingfu, upon first assuming office as magistrate of Pingdu Prefecture in Shandong, was upright, enlightened, compassionate, and benevolent—possessing the virtues of an ancient model official. His mother, Madame Yan, resided with him in the yamen, constantly instructing her son in benevolence and kindness.

In the fifth month of a certain year during the Qianlong reign, the governor traveled to the provincial capital on official business. Suddenly, a great flood struck the prefecture, sweeping away countless homes. Tens of thousands of villagers fled into the city, but the waters continued to rise until only three planks of the city walls remained above the surface. With no food to be had, the refugees’ wails shook heaven and earth. The officials stood helpless, at a loss for what to do.

Madame Yan, upon hearing this, immediately ordered the release of grain from the Ever-Normal Granary to relieve the starving. Her staff advisors objected, saying, “This requires an official petition and awaits approval before action can be taken. Moreover, the magistrate is not present in the yamen—who would dare act without authorization?” Madame Yan, incensed upon hearing this, declared, “The Ever-Normal Granary was established precisely for emergencies. Now, tens of thousands wail in hunger, waiting to be fed. If we must wait for approval, will they not all become corpses of the starved? Our family is quite wealthy—should the authorities hold us accountable for acting without authorization, selling our entire estate would suffice to repay the loss. If you fear my son may object, let this old woman bear the responsibility alone; it has nothing to do with any of you.” She then commanded the assistant officials to be summoned and addressed them in person. The officials, tongues tied in astonishment, dared not speak. Madame Yan, her anger unabated, said, “Have no fear of being implicated. If there is any consequence, I shall ensure my son bears it alone. Your duty is merely to assist this old woman in overseeing the distribution.” The crowd, left with no choice, complied with her orders.

At once, cheers erupted like thunder, and all rejoiced in their rebirth. The gentry and wealthy families of the city, moved by Madame Yan’s virtue, also donated grain to supplement what the authorities could not provide. After seven days, the floodwaters receded, and the grain stores were entirely depleted.

The governor, upon receiving the report in the provincial capital, hastened home. Entering his residence, his advisors informed him of the grain distribution. The governor smiled and said, “What my mother did was entirely proper! Quickly draft a report for me, stating the facts as they are. I shall immediately send someone back to our hometown to sell our estate to make restitution—have no fear, gentlemen.”

When the report reached the governor-general and provincial treasurer, they were greatly alarmed and swiftly memorialized the throne, impeaching him for unauthorized use of the granary stores. The Pure Emperor read the memorial and commended the act, writing in vermilion: “As a high official of the frontier, you have such a worthy mother and capable subordinates—why would you impeach rather than commend them?” He then issued an edict permitting the distributed grain to be accounted as a regular expenditure, with no need for restitution.

The governor, deeply grateful for the imperial favor, redoubled his efforts in virtuous governance. When the emperor later made his eastern tour, the governor—by then transferred to Jinan Prefecture—was summoned for an audience. The emperor inquired in detail about the earlier events and specially bestowed a plaque upon Madame Yan to honor her. Later, the governor was repeatedly promoted, eventually rising to the post of governor of Guizhou.

The governor’s son, Jian, rose from a departmental clerk to the governorship of Zhili; his grandson, Bofu, advanced from the Hanlin Academy to the governorship of Fujian; and his great-nephew, Yiyou, was appointed as the Director-General of the Eastern River Conservancy after serving as a secretary in the Grand Secretariat. Many others among her descendants, whether serving in the capital as Hanlin academicians or departmental clerks, or holding provincial posts as surveillance commissioners or prefectural governors, all owed their success to Madame Yan’s lifelong accumulation of virtue.

**Fourteen. Following Precedent in Two Cases**
*An official kept his hands clean and never took bribes—*
*Why then was his line cut off after his death?*
*He submitted a memorial to the City God to inquire about karmic retribution,*
*Only to be told that following precedent was no excuse.*

Fei Gong of Gui’an began his career as a county magistrate and rose to the rank of judicial commissioner. By nature, he was incorruptible and refused private petitions. Once entrusted with the authority of the judiciary, he upheld the law in every case without bending the rules. In his old age, he remained childless. After retiring from office, he reflected on his decades of service and wondered: if he had maintained such unblemished integrity, why had he been repaid with the punishment of a sonless lineage? He then submitted a formal memorial to the City God’s temple to plead his case.

That night, he dreamed that an underling from the City God’s temple summoned him. Upon arrival, he saw the deity descend the steps to welcome him inside. Once seated, the god addressed him: “I read your memorial and sensed your indignation, so I specially invited you here to settle the matter. Your refusal to take bribes or show favoritism is a heart that could face Heaven itself. Yet you wielded judicial power for years—what did you rely upon to honor your lord and protect the people?”

Fei replied, “Nothing more than handling every matter according to precedent.”

The god smiled and said, “Your lack of descendants is precisely because of these three words: *following precedent*.”

Startled, Fei asked, “Then should precedent not be followed?”

The god replied, “That is not what I meant.”

Fei, a scholar, have you not heard that *laws establish great statutes, while rites accord with human sentiment*? The ignorant common folk, unwittingly ensnared in the web of law—if every matter is handled by precedent, how can the people endure it? Moreover, as you oversee the judicial authority, can you guarantee that local officials never wrongly condemn the innocent? And with your excessive self-assurance, when cases border on the ambiguous, you decide them by your own judgment—how many among them might be blameless yet executed? Measured against the sage’s principle of *when in doubt, punish lightly*, this seems not the way. *"When the waters are too clear, there are no fish"*—this is of your own making, so it is no wonder that Heaven’s Dao has misaligned your fate."

Fei fell silent, deeply regretting his ways.

The god then consoled him: "Throughout your life, you have been upright and impartial. In the future, you and I shall share the same official bond, honored with offerings in this region—what need have you of descendants?" With that, he ordered an underling to escort Fei home.

Upon waking, Fei’s desire for an heir finally ceased. He ultimately adopted his nephew as his successor. On his deathbed, he saw before his couch what appeared to be those seeking redress for grievances. When he rebuked them, they revealed themselves as six bandits from his tenure as judicial commissioner in a certain province—men whose crimes did not warrant death, yet whom he had condemned by the letter of the law. Knowing his end was near, Fei called for his robes and cap, donned them, and passed away. Later, it was said he became the City God of that prefecture.

Long ago, there was an official named Zhang, who served as judicial commissioner in Henan. In every case, he enforced the law with unyielding severity, showing no leniency—especially to the powerful or the sons of wealthy families. At the time, the prohibition against heterodox teachings was strictly enforced. A rich man was accused by his neighbor of practicing such teachings with seditious intent. Hearing of his wealth, Zhang arrested and harshly tortured him. The prefect and the provincial inspector, aware of the false accusation, pleaded his case to Zhang. Zhang merely scoffed, "Is that so?"

A mere commoner at that—yet able to make an *observateur* and a prefect exert themselves on his behalf—this was just like the household of Guo Jie in the time of Emperor Wu of Han, which was certainly not poor. The emperor had said: "Guo Jie is but a man of the streets, yet his influence extends to making a general speak for him—how can his household be called poor?" In the end, he was relocated. Here, too, the judicial commissioner fabricated evidence to secure the rich man’s conviction. The rich man died, his family was exiled to the frontier, and the injustice was widely lamented.

Later, one of his grandsons, serving as a *zhubu* awaiting appointment in our Zhejiang, fathered three sons. When the father died, the youngest son, fearing his two elder brothers would forbid his affair with a maidservant, poisoned them to death. The crime was exposed, and he was executed in the marketplace. Thus, their line came to an end.

Those who knew the judicial commissioner’s life all said this was the retribution for his purity carried to cruel excess.

**15. Yang the Judicial Commissioner**
A governor’s greed for a hundred thousand in gold
Brought the sentence of execution upon himself.

Who could have foreseen that on the following day, the yin spirits would arrive—
Striking the pillar, his skull split open, brains spilling across the hall.

In the late years of the Qianlong reign, bandits ran rampant across the Jiangsu-Zhejiang waters. Under imperial orders to capture them, Yang Tianxiang, vice commander of Chongming, made the arrest. Brigadier Chen Dayong submitted an urgent memorial to the throne, though in haste he omitted the governor-general’s title. The governor-general, old and avaricious, resented Chen’s solo memorial and sought to undermine him. Coincidentally, an edict arrived instructing the Jiangnan governor to review the case and execute the bandits. The bandits then bribed the governor-general with one hundred thousand taels of silver. He accepted the bribe and was determined to overturn the verdict. At that time, a certain prefect of Yangzhou, recently promoted from censor to an external post, paid his respects to the governor-general. The governor-general mentioned the case, hinting at doubts. The prefect hastily replied, “The Green Standard troops often falsely accuse the innocent to claim merit. Your Excellency should investigate thoroughly to avoid wronging the common folk.” The governor-general was delighted and immediately entrusted the case to him.

By then, the bandits had already received word from the governor-general. They fabricated charges against law-abiding coastal residents, fishermen by trade, framing them as the true culprits. Under torture, the fishermen falsely confessed. The prefect, swayed by the governor-general’s earlier remarks, believed the lie and ruled that the fishermen had been falsely accused as bandits. The governor-general promptly released the bandits from prison while impeaching the brigadier and vice commander, demanding their dismissal and punishment.

The governor-general then executed Tianxiang at the coastal port. The brigadier, accused of shielding his subordinate, was stripped of his rank and exiled to the military frontier. The day after Tianxiang’s death, the governor-general went to offer incense. As he was about to mount his sedan, he suddenly rebuked his attendants: “Master Yang has arrived—why did you not announce him?” He turned and walked away as if accompanying a guest. Upon reaching the flower hall, he first made bowing gestures, his lips murmuring as though arguing with someone. Then he began grappling with the air, striking himself across both cheeks until they swelled. After a long while, he cried out, “I was wrong to take the bandits’ gold and let you die! I deserve death! I shall repay your life!” He tore at his own hair, then said, “Stop pulling! I’m going! I’m going!” With that, he dashed his head against a pillar, brains spilling out as he died. At once, all knew it was Tianxiang exacting vengeance.

A year later, the bandit suddenly appeared at the Shandong governor’s yamen to surrender, confessing in detail how he had been captured in Jiangnan and bribed his way to freedom. The governor, unwilling to stir up a major case, executed the bandit while suppressing the matter. Only the Yangzhou prefect ultimately ended his career in honor. For the prefect had always been upright; in reviewing this case, he had not deliberately curried favor with the governor-general. Rather, having long served in the capital, he was all too familiar with the cowardice of provincial Green Standard troops and their habit of framing the innocent to claim merit. Thus, his stubborn prejudice led to this miscarriage of justice. His error was unintentional, so retribution did not fall upon him—yet his reputation never flourished. Moreover, in the year of Tianxiang’s death, a son was born to him, wild and unruly, nearly ruining the family.

The prefect shared years of friendship with my family. I often saw him recounting his chronicle, still claiming this case as a wrong righted. The Master of Sitting Among Flowers said: “From childhood, I knew well the injustice of this case. In my later years, while traveling briefly to Loudong, elders told me: ‘Tianxiang and the brigadier had long been beloved by the troops. When Tianxiang faced execution, soldiers from both the brigadier’s and vice commander’s battalions cried injustice and beat the drums, even offering to surrender their rations. For a time, weapons piled high as mountains, nearly sparking a mutiny. Fortunately, the brigadier knelt in supplication to calm them, and they finally returned to their ranks.’ Alas!”

The avaricious and senescent govern through bribes to succeed, while those who uphold integrity are sidelined by one-sided judgments. Thus, wrongs arise from the infamous "three characters." The brigadier was imprisoned, and turmoil nearly erupted as soldiers cast off their helmets. Vengeance was ultimately exacted by dashing against the pillar. Yet even the upright and unyielding prefect nearly met the same grim fate. How, then, can those who adjudicate cases fail to exercise utmost caution?

Sixteen. A Certain Bureau Director
When a matter concerns the public esteem that brings renown,
How could one privately bend the rules for kin?
A brother might seize the chance to gain an early foothold—
Yet no scheme escapes the knowledge of Heaven.

Under the established regulations, officials of the sixth rank and below—including assistant and miscellaneous functionaries—as well as those awaiting appointment in educational posts, were exempted from presenting themselves at the Ministry of Personnel to submit credentials. Instead, they were selected in turn through the standard examination process. Once assigned a vacancy, their documents were forwarded by the governor or governor-general of their native province, a measure designed to show consideration and spare minor officials the hardship of travel and the burden of waiting. The intent was most commendable.

Yet those awaiting appointment, unaware of the selection schedule, might serve as private secretaries in another province, relocate with their families, or even fall ill or die without filing a report. After a vacancy was filled, repeated inquiries might yield no trace of them, leaving many posts unoccupied.

When a certain gentleman from Fujian served as Director of Selection, his younger brother, having qualified under the same regulations, found his name placed too far down the list to secure a post. The Director then proposed a new rule: candidates for educational posts awaiting appointment must annually submit a sworn statement from their native prefecture and county, attested by the local authorities and forwarded through the governor or governor-general to the Ministry, confirming their presence in the province and absence of misconduct. Only then would they be eligible for selection. If a candidate ranked higher on the list failed to submit the required documents, the next eligible candidate—even if lower in rank—would be appointed out of turn.

Once the rule was enacted, the Director urged his brother to return home and file the statement. At the time, no other province was aware of the change, and his brother’s documents arrived first. Thus, he leapfrogged the list and secured the post.

Yet for those awaiting appointment, each sworn statement meant another round of exactions. The poor, though aware that the selection period had arrived, often found themselves utterly without resources and unable to comply. Many thus delayed their submission. Those residing in their hometowns or traveling afar were further hindered by their ignorance of the new requirement.

The Selection Bureau chief devised this scheme solely to favor his brother. Before a year had passed, he was exposed by the censors for partiality in handling official appointments, stripped of his post, and exiled to a distant garrison. His brother, having secured the position, was likewise dismissed shortly after taking office—what profit lay in such clandestine machinations?

**17. The Righteous Dog**

Thrice it scratched the gate to sound the alarm,
Yet in disaster’s wake, it seemed to grieve its debt unpaid.
Now human affairs are so topsy-turvy—
Only the dog upholds loyalty unswayed.

My maternal great-grandmother, Madam Chen, kept a yellow dog in her household. Her second elder sister, Madam Wang, doted on it exceedingly. The dog, in turn, displayed a rare understanding of human intent, unlike ordinary hounds.

At the time, a certain servant-woman—an old crone who had fallen out of her master’s favor—would often steal away to utter curses in secret. One evening, after the inner gates had been locked, the dog suddenly began scratching at the door, its howls mournful and urgent. Madam Wang found this strange and personally carried a lamp outside to investigate. No sooner had she unlatched the door than the dog seized her skirt in its jaws, as if tugging her forward. Even more perplexed, she summoned the still-awake servants and said to the dog, “What is the matter? Lead the way!” The dog immediately released her garment and set off ahead.

The party followed the dog to the firewood storage, where smoke was rising. Upon inspection, they found embers placed beneath the pile, and quickly removed them. Though Madam Wang suspected the old crone’s doing, she suppressed her anger and could not bring herself to dismiss her. Several days later, the dog howled again outside the gate. Hurrying to look, they saw the firewood nearly ablaze, but fortunately, the gathered servants extinguished it in time. Still, she did not send the crone away, only tightening inspections each night after the household had settled. Months passed, and vigilance slackened. One night, as everyone slept, Madam Wang suddenly heard the dog’s howls in her dream and awoke with a start. The cries were sharp and desperate. Hastily throwing on her clothes, she rushed out. As the door opened, thick smoke already filled the air. The firewood shed stood beside the main hall, and by the time she called for help, flames had reached the hall’s front gate—no path remained to enter. The dog returned, seizing her skirt and pulling her toward the rear gate, as if guiding her to flee. With no time to think, she and her younger sister each clutched a deed box for their farmland and led the household out through the back. The dog lingered by the gate, watching until all had escaped, then turned back inside. Called to no avail, it perished in the fire—perhaps reproaching itself for its delayed warning, having failed its master and betrayed the kindness of its keep.

**18. The Grateful Swine**

A strange tale from He Laibai:
*An official’s procession blocked—*
*How odd! In Changzhou, Magistrate Lü Youxin*
*Received deep kindness, repaid it with death—*
*One envies such swine, surpassing men.*

Magistrate Lü Youxin of Changzhou served as Assistant Prefect of Eastern Defense in our Hangzhou. One day, while traveling in his sedan, two swine suddenly prostrated themselves before his palanquin, lifting their heads in a plea for mercy. Whipped, they did not move; driven away, they would not leave. Greatly astonished, he halted the procession and ordered his attendants to investigate their origin. Soon, a butcher was brought forth, who explained that both swine had been purchased from a farming household days prior and were to be slaughtered that very day. They had escaped, he said, never expecting them to disrupt the official’s procession. At the sight of the butcher, the swine cowered even lower, trembling violently, their pitiful cries unceasing. Moved by compassion, Magistrate Lü turned to the butcher and said, “Give the swine to me, and I shall pay you their original price.” He immediately ordered the money fetched, paid the full sum, and took the swine back to the yamen, where they were kept in a pen.

The next morning, as the magistrate rose and entered the front courtyard, the two swine prostrated themselves before him, bowing their heads as if in obeisance. When he shouted at them to leave, they retreated a few paces but remained standing, watching as he entered the inner chambers before returning to their pen. From then on, every dawn they would wait in the front courtyard, bowing as before whenever he emerged. If he returned from outside, they would hear the distant sound of gongs and leap joyfully, as if in welcome.

After leaving office, he called to them, saying, “I am returning home now! I have kept you for years and cannot bear to see you slaughtered again. I shall send you to the Temple of Liberated Life.” The swine hesitated, uttering mournful cries, as if unwilling. Sensing their reluctance, he comforted them, “You do not wish to leave me? Then I shall take you home—how would that be?” The swine immediately bowed their heads, and he brought them back to Changzhou, where they were kept for over a decade. When the magistrate passed away, the two swine wailed day and night, refusing all food. Within days, they starved to death.

The two swine hesitated in distress, their mournful cries unceasing, as if unwilling to go. Magistrate Lü understood their meaning and comforted them, saying, “You do not wish to leave me? Then I shall still bring you back to my hometown—how would that be?” The swine immediately bowed their heads in response. Thus, he brought them back to his old home in Changzhou, where they were kept for over a decade. When Magistrate Lü passed away, the two swine wailed day and night, refusing all food offered to them. Within days, they starved to death.

The Master of Zuohua, reflecting on the cases of Chen and Lü, sighed and said, “Tales of loyal dogs abound in records. Yet among the six livestock, swine are deemed the most dull-witted—yet once granted the grace of life, they repay it with utmost devotion in life and even sacrifice themselves in death, behaving as if they were human. How many among us should feel ashamed in comparison? Today, people often revile others as having the conduct of ‘dogs and swine’—but if we consider the dog of the Chen family and the swine of the Lü family, I fear they would disdain even to rank among humankind!”

Amidst the common flaw of upright officials’ severity,
The noble man has ever prized restraint, not contention.
With virtue too meager to wield the brush of splendor,
Only then does one know how Heaven esteems examination glory.

Renxiang Zhou Yunxiu, having become a live-in son-in-law to the Yu family of Piling (Changzhou), settled there. Yunxiu was deeply mired in drink, and though enrolled as a scholar, he had long ceased to participate in the provincial examinations. In the year *jiyou*, his son also passed the *maocai* examination. Yunxiu then brought him back to Hangzhou, and father and son entered the examination hall together. No sooner had Yunxiu taken his seat in the cell than he began to feel disoriented, muttering incoherently. A candidate in the neighboring cell lifted the curtain to look, whereupon Yunxiu pounded the desk and cursed loudly. Unaware of the demonic possession at first, the neighbor argued back. The proctors and fellow candidates, hearing the commotion, gathered to see. Yunxiu glared wildly around, hurling abuse without cease. Suddenly, he rushed out, wielding his cell’s wooden board to strike at anyone in his path, sending the crowd scattering. Then, abandoning the board, he seized a proctor’s firewood cleaver and began hacking wildly, his manner like that of a madman. The others urgently summoned the officials. At the sight of one clad in an embroidered python robe, Yunxiu leapt for joy, exclaiming, “Good! Good! The proctor has come to arrest you all—how dare you strike and curse me?”

He then pointed in all directions, saying, “It was not I who wished to brawl—you all cursed me first, so I could not but retort. You struck me, so I could not but strike back.” Suddenly, he brandished his fists at the empty air, shouting, “Do you still dare to hit me?” The proctor, at a loss, went to report to the examiner. When the examiner arrived, Yunxiu remained as frenzied as before. With no other recourse, they ordered strong men to restrain him, then petitioned the chief examiner to have his hands and feet bound. He was taken under guard to the Hall of Impartiality, where he continued to hurl abuse, his words now utterly unintelligible.

On the tenth day, the gates opened, and attendants were sent to escort him out. By chance, his son, who had just submitted his own examination papers and was leaving the compound, encountered him. Together with other candidates, they supported Yunxiu back to their lodging. His clansman, Yunji, and two *xiaolian* scholars who admired Tao, having heard the news, hastened to see him. Yunxiu suddenly leapt up, seizing the hands of the two scholars, and cried, “You two have already been bound by the examiner—how have you escaped before the case is settled?” The two men stared in astonishment, while Yunxiu’s madness only worsened. His son, unable to attend the second session, hastily chartered a boat back to Changzhou.

As soon as they boarded, Yunxiu’s spirit cleared at once. When questioned about the events in the examination hall, he was utterly bewildered. All he recalled was a crowd of men and women surrounding him, cursing and striking him, to which he had responded in kind. After returning to Changzhou, he suffered no further ill effects. What karmic cause or consequence this may have been remains unknown.

Yunxiu was prudent, honest, and content with his lot, known only for his love of wine—nothing hidden or wicked lay within him. Some say his father had once served as prefect, upright yet severe, and may have wrongly implicated someone in a crime, thus bringing retribution upon his descendants, preventing them from completing the examinations and attaining official rank.

Twenty. **Vice Censor-in-Chief Wang**
*How strange—a scribe’s brush makes a Vice Censor-in-Chief,*
*Good and evil so clear, as if echo answers sound.*
*When matters touch the weight of moral teachings,*
*The stubborn and the timid alike rise at the call.*

Vice Censor-in-Chief Wang of Guangling (Guangling being Yangzhou) has lost his given name. Orphaned young and poor, he wielded the scribe’s brush to support his mother. At twenty, he became a government student, but though repeatedly recommended in the autumn examinations, he never passed. One New Year’s Eve, he dreamed two attendants in green summoned him away. Arriving at an official residence, grand and resplendent—its towering halls aglow—

Seated above was one whose crown and robes resembled a king’s. Beside him stood two crimson-robed clerks, holding a long register at the ready. Once the kingly figure had marked his judgment, the clerks called out for Wang to approach. Wang prostrated himself at the foot of the hall, stealing a glance at the king’s face—his expression was severe. He tossed down a ledger and ordered Wang to read it. There, beneath his own name, was recorded that he was destined to pass the examinations in a single sweep, enter the Hanlin Academy, rise to the rank of Governor-General, yet have it all erased by the baleful karma of his scribe’s brush. He had barely finished reading when the kingly figure struck the table and demanded, “Do you understand?” Wang kowtowed, begging for mercy. The kingly figure said, “In consideration of your filial devotion to your mother, I shall grant you a chance to reform. Change your ways at once, and your examination success may yet be restored. But if you persist in evil to the end, your life will be forfeit.” He then ordered the attendants in green to escort Wang out. Wang privately asked who the kingly figure was, and they replied, “It is the Wen Emperor. The register he signed is next autumn’s examination list—if you reform and do good, you may still appear on it. Do not betray the Emperor’s earnest and painstaking admonition.” With that, they pushed him away.

Startled awake, he found a single lamp still flickering dimly, while the neighbor’s rooster had yet to crow. The dream lingered vividly in his mind. Resolved to change his ways, he mused in silence: a poor man like himself had no means to perform good deeds—even if he abandoned his legal brush, how could he atone for past wrongs? Lost in thought through the night, he suddenly realized, “If the legal brush can kill, why can it not also save?” If he reversed its course, the gods might yet favor him. His mind made up, he rose, dressed, and sat waiting for dawn. At first light, he went to the Temple of Wenchang, burned incense, and prayed in silence.

From that day on, whenever litigants came to him, he would patiently mediate their disputes. If a party was in the wrong but sought litigation, he firmly rebuked them. Only when the cause was just and the party could not speak for themselves did he draft their pleas. For those without means, he went further, offering his own resources to aid them. After a full year of such conduct, the education commissioner awarded him first place in the prefectural examination. Encouraged, he redoubled his efforts to do good.

A neighboring household had a young widow who bore a posthumous child, and though their family was of modest means, they lived comfortably. Her husband’s clan, however, falsely accused her of impropriety and brought suit before the magistrate, claiming the child was not of true blood, fearing that an outsider’s lineage would disrupt the ancestral line, and petitioned the court to compel her to return permanently to her natal home. The widow’s own family, timid and weak-willed, dared not utter a word in her defense. Her grievance unvoiced, she wept day and night, vowing to die rather than endure the injustice.

An elderly neighbor, learning of her plight, told Wang. After investigating, Wang became convinced of the widow’s chastity. He visited her mother’s home and drafted a plea on her behalf, urging her mother to present it to the magistrate. The widow’s brothers hesitated, but Wang’s righteous indignation stirred them, and they were moved to act. Once the petition was submitted, Wang gathered his fellow scholars and the village elders, intending to address the matter publicly when the magistrate paid his monthly visit to the temple to expound the imperial edicts.

Some warned him, saying the affair did not concern him, but Wang replied, “Upholding chastity and protecting the orphaned are matters of moral principle—duties that all who study the classics should undertake. This is not like those who meddle in lawsuits for profit, which the statutes forbid. If there is any offense to be taken, I alone shall bear the responsibility.” The assembly praised his sense of justice and rallied eagerly to his cause. On the first day of the month, they gathered at the school. When the magistrate arrived and the edicts had been read, they presented their joint petition for review.

The magistrate, known for his discernment, examined the document and declared, “This concerns a matter of moral integrity. I shall personally investigate the truth of the matter. If the clan has indeed slandered her, they shall be punished according to the law. But you, gentlemen, must verify your findings thoroughly, lest you bring trouble upon yourselves.”

The scholar stepped forward and forcefully argued the case of false accusation, speaking with resolute conviction. The magistrate, seeing the righteousness of his words, commended and dismissed him. Within days, the hearing was convened. The clan members, their arguments exhausted, all confessed to the false accusation. The woman’s innocence was thus vindicated.

Once the case was closed, the woman instructed her maternal family to offer a hundred taels of silver to Wang in gratitude, but Wang refused. When they insisted, Wang grew angry and said, “Do you think I acted for the sake of a reward?” He rejected the gift sternly, his voice and expression severe, and the family departed in shame.

On New Year’s Eve that year, Wang dreamed again of the two green-robed attendants, who summoned him as before. They arrived at the same place, where the Celestial Judge, his countenance now serene, addressed him: “I commend your swift reform. Your scholarly honors have been restored, and you shall pass the next examination. For your act of preserving chastity and protecting the orphan—a virtuous deed that moved Heaven—you shall succeed this very year. Strive ever harder in your virtue, and your future will be boundless.” Wang bowed deeply in gratitude.

The Judge then ordered an attendant to escort him out. Along the way, he encountered two elders and a young man kneeling beside the path. Unsure of their identity, Wang returned their bow. The elders and the youth pressed their foreheads to the ground and said, “By your grace, you preserved our lineage and safeguarded our family estate. We, father and son, grandfather and grandson, are ashamed to have no means to repay your great kindness. We heard the Celestial Judge had summoned you, so we awaited you here.” Wang realized they were the woman’s uncle and husband, and he helped them rise.

The elder then pointed to the young man and said to Wang, “This unworthy son has received your boundless favor. Knowing you have no heir, we shall beseech the underworld authorities to let him become your son in repayment.” Wang demurred and took his leave. Eagerly searching for the green-robed attendants, he found them gone. Wandering at the crossroads, he felt lost and bewildered when suddenly a black-robed man addressed him: “You have not yet returned? Fortunately, you met me—otherwise, you would have been in peril.”

The black-robed man then took Wang by the hand and led him forward with great speed, so swift that in an instant they saw his family gate. Wang asked the man’s name and surname, to which he smiled and replied, “We have lived under the same roof for years—how could you not know me?” Pressed further, he revealed himself as the Kitchen God. Together they entered Wang’s chamber, where his mother and wife sat facing each other, their faces wreathed in joy. A man lay on the bed to one side, and as Wang stared in astonishment, the black-robed figure gave him a push from behind. In that moment, he felt his own body merge with the one on the bed, and he awoke with a loud cry. Indeed, his mother and wife were both in the room.

Wang then recounted all that had befallen him in his dream, rose at once, and burned incense to bow in gratitude to the Kitchen God. From that time on, he redoubled his efforts to do good. The following year, he passed the provincial examination and went on to achieve successive successes, entering the Hanlin Academy and rising to the rank of Grand Guardian. In the same year he passed the examination, he fathered a son. As the child was born, Wang seemed to see the young man from his dream enter the room, and this son, too, would later attain high office through the imperial examinations.

The Master of the Flowery Seat observed: “Though Wang’s use of legal petitions to save another was his own innovation, why should others not do the same to aid their fellow men? If they did, then of all the ways to benefit and assist the world, what could surpass the power of the written word? Truly, Wang’s abundant blessings and good fortune were well deserved!”

21. Magistrate Li Xiaolin

Why seek to flatter and display one’s talent?
For leniency and severity must ever be balanced in governance.
Behold the stern magistrate of Qingyang—
Even when he cried, “I was wrong!” it was already too late.

Magistrate Li Xiaolin, a *mingfu* (a term for county magistrates), had passed the provincial examination as a *jieyuan* (top scholar) before assuming office in Wanjing (present-day Anhui). His literary grace and charismatic bearing won the admiration of his peers. Yet his nature inclined toward severity. While awaiting his post in the provincial capital, he spent his days adjudicating cases at the governor’s yamen. At the time, both the governor-general and the provincial governor favored strict governance, and Xiaolin deliberately curried their favor, ensuring his rulings were harsh and unyielding. His eloquence was sharp, his judgments swift as flowing water. Once he had settled a case, even veteran clerks could find no grounds for objection. Thus, he won the full approval of the governor and governor-general, and in all matters, he leaned toward severity.

Those executed under his judgments were not necessarily all deserving of their sentences. Later, as he took up successive posts in troubled counties—where governance was most difficult—he invariably ruled with severity. Soon after, he was transferred from Xuancheng to assume the magistracy of Qingyang. One day, while traveling to the countryside to conduct an inquest, his sedan chair had reached the midway point when the bearers suddenly heard the magistrate’s stern rebuke. At first, they assumed he was angry with them, but then came a murmuring, as if he were arguing with someone. The words were mostly unintelligible, save for frantic cries: *“I was wrong! I was wrong! I should not have falsely implicated you in crimes that sent you to your deaths side by side!”* With that, all fell silent. When they arrived at the lodging for the night and halted the sedan, the magistrate did not emerge. They lifted the curtain to look—only to find him stiff and dead, his hands clutching his own throat.

The Master of the Sitting-among-Flowers remarked: *“Governance that favors severity already loses the spirit of compassion. How much worse when it stems from the private motive of currying favor through calculation and flattery? What recourse then remains for the people? The Way of Heaven is numinous and just; one cannot kill alone without consequence. Would that those who rule over the people might never wait until they encounter ghosts in their sedan chairs to cry, ‘I was wrong! I was wrong!’—then all would be well.”*

“22. *The Counterfeit Letter Preserving Chastity*
Hearing weeping stirs a kind thought—
Light of wealth, staunch in righteousness, the tale lives on.
Surely this must be a descendant of Lord Wen—
Would that I could buy yellow gold to cast his likeness!”

A young man of Jiaxing named Zhu had ancestors from Huizhou. As a child, he was bright and fond of reading, but after losing his parents in adolescence, he abandoned his studies. A fellow villager, having established a large shop in Jiaxing, took Zhu along to apprentice in trade. All apprentices regarded the shopkeeper as their master. Zhu was diligent, quick-witted, and sincere, and his master cherished him deeply. Once his training was complete, through frugality and hard work, he amassed a hundred taels of silver. He had long been betrothed and now planned to return home to marry. His master approved but, considering his meager savings, added another hundred taels, set a departure date, and saw him off.

Zhu returned within ten days, astonishing his master with his swift return. He explained that bandits had robbed him mid-journey, leaving him penniless. Realizing there was no point in returning empty-handed, he resolved to wait a year or two, save a little more, and then make another attempt. His master, hearing this, sighed deeply for some time, unaware that Zhu had not been robbed at all.

On his southward journey, Zhu disembarked at a certain place and traveled overland. That night, he lodged at an inn and heard bitter weeping from the next room. Listening closely, he discerned two women sobbing without cease until dawn. At daybreak, he asked the innkeeper about it.

The innkeeper replied, "It is a sorrowful tale. The ones weeping last night were a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. The mother-in-law was widowed young and raised her only son to adulthood, for whom she arranged a marriage. The daughter-in-law was both beautiful and filial. A year after the wedding, driven by famine, the son left to seek work as a private secretary in Sichuan, sending home meager earnings to support his mother. When this proved insufficient, the daughter-in-law supplemented their income with needlework. Recently, due to military conflicts in Sichuan and Hubei, the roads have been blocked, and for three years now, no news or remittances have arrived. This year, famine struck, firewood as precious as cassia and rice as costly as pearls made survival nearly impossible. The mother-in-law, with no other choice, resolved to sell her daughter-in-law. Yesterday, a matchmaker came, saying a wealthy man’s son, enamored with the daughter-in-law’s beauty, offered three hundred taels to take her as his concubine—the agreement was already settled. The daughter-in-law, unwilling to leave her mother-in-law, and the mother-in-law, reluctant to part with her virtuous and filial daughter-in-law, wept bitterly all night."

Moved by their plight, Zhu asked in detail about their family name, clan, and the son’s name, age, and appearance, which the innkeeper recounted fully. Zhu then said, "I have some business to attend to and must delay my departure by half a day." The innkeeper agreed and left.

Returning to his room, Zhu took out all the silver from his purse and forged a letter from the son. He then went to their home. An old woman answered the door, her eyes brimming with tears. Startled, she asked, "Where have you come from, sir?" Zhu replied, "Is this the residence of such-and-such a family?" "Yes," she said. "Is there someone working as a private secretary in Sichuan?" "There is," she answered. When he asked for the name, the old woman described it exactly as the innkeeper had. Zhu requested to see the mistress of the house. The old woman said, "I am she." She then led him inside, asking where he had come from.

Zhu presented the two hundred taels of silver and the forged letter, saying, "I traded goods in Sichuan and became fast friends with your son. Now, returning south with my cargo, your son entrusted me to deliver this silver and letter—please accept them." Overjoyed, the old woman urged him to stay and pressed him for details of her son’s whereabouts. Zhu replied, "Your son is thriving in his travels, having amassed great wealth. He will return home any day now; the letter surely explains everything in full. I must hurry on my way and cannot stay to speak further." With that, he took his leave.

Taking a roundabout path back to the inn, he immediately sent a letter home, claiming to have been robbed and requesting a delay in the wedding. He then returned to the inn himself. His master, trusting in his sincerity and prudence, grew increasingly reliant on him. After another year, he saved enough to return home, once more lodging at the same inn. He asked the innkeeper about the mother and daughter-in-law of that family and what had become of them. The innkeeper exclaimed, "What a strange turn of events!"

"After I told the traveler what had happened, that very day a stranger from afar arrived at their home, bearing a letter from her son along with two hundred taels of silver. He entrusted these to them and left. Upon receiving the silver, the mother-in-law immediately informed the matchmaker to call off the marriage with the wealthy family. Before even a few days had passed, her son suddenly returned, bringing with him over a hundred thousand taels in wealth. Now they have become a prosperous household. Yet in Sichuan, there was no one entrusted to deliver the silver or letter—no one knows where the letter came from. They suspect that the gods, moved by the mother-in-law’s steadfast virtue and the daughter-in-law’s filial piety, secretly aided them."

Zhu nodded in agreement. The next day, he set off on his journey. A year after his marriage, he returned to the shop and once again lodged at the same inn. Rain prevented him from traveling, so he strolled outside the gate. By chance, he encountered the neighbor’s mother-in-law being carried past in a sedan chair. He quickly stepped aside to avoid her. Soon after, a young scholar in formal attire approached and invited him to his home. Zhu declined, saying, "We have never met—why this sudden honor?" The scholar smiled and replied, "It is nothing. I only heard from the innkeeper that you are skilled in calligraphy."

"Just now, I was about to send a letter to a distant place, but I suffer from an inability to wield the brush myself, and my secretary has gone elsewhere. Thus, I venture to beg your assistance." Zhu firmly declined, only relenting after much insistence. The young scholar then entered and retrieved the letter draft, saying, "Please transcribe this with a single flourish." Zhu wrote it out and handed it over. Shortly after, two servants emerged, placing a chair in the center of the hall and spreading a red *qúshū* upon the floor—an arrangement as if a junior were about to pay respects to an elder. Zhu paced about the hall, perplexed by the proceedings. Suddenly, the neighbor’s mother-in-law and her daughter-in-law appeared from within, both dressed in solemn and dignified attire.

The young scholar, flustered, attempted to flee, but the two servants restrained him, preventing his escape. The neighbor’s son then ordered several maids to assist the scholar into the chair, holding his hands on either side so he could not move. Thereupon, the mother knelt before him, her daughter-in-law following behind, and kowtowed in gratitude, saying, “Had it not been for your great kindness, my son and I—husband and wife—would not be here today.” The scholar firmly denied any involvement, protesting, “I am but a chance acquaintance, stranger to your affairs. Why do you play this cruel jest, placing me in such an impossible position?”

Once the crowd had finished their prostrations, the mother spoke: “You personally delivered the silver and letter to me. For three years, I have never forgotten your virtue, not even in my dreams. Though a true gentleman bestows kindness without expecting repayment, how could my son and I live with ourselves otherwise? Now, by heaven’s grace, we have met again, sparing us a lifetime of regret.” She then instructed her son to produce the letters from before and after as proof, and summoned the innkeeper to confirm. The innkeeper pondered for a long while before saying, “There is no doubt.” He recounted how, after hearing the weeping, the scholar had persistently inquired about their origins and had turned back mid-journey to assist.

Only then did the scholar reluctantly admit, “It was merely a moment of compassion—heaven took pity on your mother’s steadfast virtue and your wife’s filial piety, using me as its instrument. How could I dare claim credit for heaven’s work?” The neighbor’s son then urged him to stay, saying, “Though I can never fully repay your kindness, I beg you to remain for a few days, that I may show you the slightest measure of respect.” Seeing his sincerity, the scholar agreed to stay briefly, lodging in his study.

The neighbor’s son, learning he was a year older, asked to honor him as an elder brother, to which the scholar happily consented. Their bond grew so deep that even blood brothers could not surpass it. When he learned the scholar’s parents remained unburied, the neighbor said, “I own a pawnshop not far from your home. This year, I acquired a plot of land three or four *li* away, where the geomancer declared that after burial, scholarly success would never cease. My own family lives too far away and lacks the fortune to benefit from it, but you, brother, are modest and reverent, with deep-rooted blessings. I humbly offer it to you.” Regarding the burial expenses for his parents, he insisted, “Allow me to bear the cost entirely, that I may repay a fraction of your great kindness.”

After repeated refusals, the scholar finally accepted. They chose an auspicious day to return together, selecting the site and arranging the burial, with all signs favorable for the year and direction. The neighbor spared no expense, managing every detail, so the scholar spent not a single coin. After the burial, the neighbor urged him to oversee the pawnshop, adding, “Fortunately, the business provides enough to sustain us.”

In the morning it is called *yong*, and in the evening, *sun*. The neighbor urged, “With this modest livelihood to provide for our daily meals, why should you return to Jiaxing and wander far from your homeland?” The scholar refused, saying, “The shopkeeper has treated me with great kindness. To abandon him midway would be to betray his favor—an inauspicious act.” Thus, he bid farewell to the neighbor and departed.

Upon returning to the shop, he encountered a fellow townsman who had arrived earlier. This man recounted the scholar’s deeds in full to the shopkeeper. Astonished and delighted, the shopkeeper exclaimed, “I initially took Master Zhu for an honest and sincere man, but he not only acts with righteous courage—he also remains so unassuming, neither boasting nor seeking praise. Such a man is destined for great fortune.” From then on, the shopkeeper placed even greater trust in him.

When the shopkeeper later fell gravely ill, he had only one young son. He entrusted the entire shop to the scholar, stipulating a ten-year term, after which the principal would be returned to his son. After taking over, the scholar’s business flourished tenfold. When the term ended, he tallied the principal and interest, amassing tens of thousands of taels of silver. Mindful of the shopkeeper’s kindness and unwilling to betray it, he divided the entire sum equally, giving half to the shopkeeper’s son. Both families thus became immensely wealthy.

Later, the scholar fathered two sons. The elder, Jiaji, placed second in the *jiaxu* metropolitan examination; the younger, Kuiji, also ranked second in the *dingchou* examination. Both entered the Hanlin Academy, successively holding prestigious offices. Their wealth and honor continue unabated to this day.

**Two Placards of Hidden Merit:**
*A righteous wife and virtuous mother preserve purity like ice;*
*Mother and child reunite through great kindness.*
*Such hidden deeds earn heaven’s abundant reward—*
*Two examination triumphs, provincial and metropolitan, are bestowed upon you.*

Xu, a *shangshe* from Shanyin, managed a pawnshop in Suzhou, returning home every three years to visit his mother. One year, at forty and still childless, he considered taking a concubine. Coincidentally, a scholar in his village had died young, leaving behind a wife and two young children—a son and a daughter—with modest means. The scholar’s dissolute younger brother, Yi, had gambled away the family’s wealth. Conspiring with his wife, he plotted to drive out his sister-in-law and seize his brother’s property. Seizing an opportunity, he first lured away and sold the children. The widow, aware of Yi’s schemes, wept day and night, longing for death.

Just then, Yi’s wife overheard a neighbor’s matron mention the *shangshe*’s desire to take a concubine. She entrusted the matter to the matron, who then brokered the arrangement with the *shangshe*. Both he and his wife were pleased.

Just as the widow had gone out on the Qingming Festival to sweep her late husband’s grave, Yi instructed the matchmaker to arrange for the *shangshe* to meet her. Pleased with what he saw, the *shangshe* immediately offered a betrothal gift of a hundred taels of silver and selected an auspicious day for the wedding—all unbeknownst to the widow. When the appointed day arrived, Yi and his wife had the matchmaker falsely claim to have found the widow’s lost children, insisting she come in person to retrieve them, thus luring her out. A sedan chair carried her directly to the *shangshe*’s home, where upon entering the hall, she was greeted with the blare of suona horns.

The *shangshe*’s wife, née Zhang, personally lifted the curtain to welcome her. Seeing the widow still dressed in mourning white, she scolded the matchmaker, “Why have you not provided the new concubine with festive attire?” The widow, about to greet her hosts with propriety, was stunned by these words. Turning to the matchmaker, she demanded, “Where is my child? And who is this?” The matchmaker whispered urgently, “Have you truly not heard? Your young master has betrothed you to this household as a concubine. The master here is surnamed Xu, and this is his principal wife. Hurry and change into your wedding clothes to bow before heaven and earth. The master and mistress are both kind and virtuous—far better than enduring your young master’s daily humiliation at home. It is as different as heaven and earth!”

The widow stood frozen, dumbstruck, unable to utter a word. Then, tears welled in her eyes, streaming down her lashes as she choked on sobs. Suddenly, she lunged toward the steps, intent on hurling herself down. Madame Zhang quickly ordered the maids to restrain her and rebuked the matchmaker, “What manner of affair is this? How could you force such a thing without her knowledge?” At that moment, the *shangshe*, who had briefly stepped inside, heard the commotion and rushed out. Recognizing the widow’s chastity, he immediately told his wife, “Remove the incense and candles at once. Escort her to the inner chambers and devise a better plan. I would rather remain childless than force a widow into concubinage—such cruelty is unbearable.”

Slightly reassured, the widow followed Madame Zhang into her private quarters, where she was asked about her family and whether she had children. The widow recounted her ordeal in full, and Madame Zhang sighed deeply in sympathy. “Now that matters have come to this, what is to be done?” The widow, weeping, replied, “This is all the work of that beastly uncle, who has betrayed all goodness. My fate—honor or disgrace, life or death—now rests in your hands. If I may preserve my name and meet my late husband in the underworld, I will serve as your maidservant to repay this kindness.”

Moved by her plight, Madame Zhang informed the *shangshe*, who was equally compassionate. Upon learning the name of the widow’s late husband, he exclaimed in shock, “He was of official lineage!” He proposed sending her home, but Madame Zhang objected, “If you return her to that beast, you will only cast her back into the jaws of death.” The *shangshe* pondered in silence, at a loss, until he consulted his mother. She declared, “If my son can perform such a virtuous deed, how could he lack an heir?”

The new woman, unable to return home, might as well be taken as my adopted daughter and share my chamber. This would preserve her chastity, avoid suspicion, and—since you are often away—provide companionship for your wife and me in our solitude. One act, three benefits: what say you, my son?” The *shangshe* replied, “Mother’s words are most wise.” He urged Madame Zhang to inform the widow, who joyfully assented.

That very day, the bridal chamber’s floral candles and feast were repurposed into a *tangbing* banquet, whereupon she bowed to her new mother and formally met the *shangshe* and his wife as brother and sister-in-law. The *shangshe* likewise treated her as a younger sister. Gentle and obedient, she won her mother’s favor and even assisted her sister-in-law with household tasks. Yet she often thought of her children, so the mother instructed the *shangshe* to keep watch for them.

One day, the *shangshe* happened to pass a roadside earth-god shrine outside the city. An elderly monk, an old acquaintance, invited him to sit. A young novice of seven or eight brought tea. The *shangshe* glanced at him—his features refined and elegant, strikingly like his sister’s—and grew suspicious. He asked the monk, “Where did you find such a fine disciple?”

The monk sighed deeply. “It is a long tale. I knew both his grandfather and father. After the grandfather passed, the father soon followed. His uncle, lost to gambling, lured him away, intending to sell him into the *you* profession. Seeing this, I took pity and bought him for ten taels of silver. I heard his mother was still alive and planned to return him to her, but feared his uncle would only sell him again. So I delayed, waiting for another opportunity.”

The *shangshe* exclaimed in astonishment, “Then he is surely my nephew!”

After losing her son, not half a month passed before she lost her daughter as well. Grief-stricken, she fell ill, seeking only death each day. The elder said, “If you can show compassion and return my son, I will repay you double the price.” The monk replied, “This is my original vow. This child is exceptionally intelligent and perceptive; he is certain to become a person of great ability. I hope you will guide him well. But be sure his uncle never learns of this—do not let my small act of kindness come to nothing.” Thereupon, he sent the boy to return home with the *shangshe*.

The *shangshe* brought his nephew home and went straight to his mother’s chamber, calling his sister to him: “Come and see this young novice—whose son do you think he is?” His sister glanced at him and wept, saying, “Is this not my son? Where did you find him?” The nephew, gazing intently at his mother, rushed into her arms and sobbed; his mother wept as well. The *shangshe*’s mother was in the Zhang family’s chamber, and upon hearing the commotion, both mother-in-law and daughter-in-law came. The sister led her son to bow to them all, saying, “Were it not for my grandmother and my uncle and aunt, my son and I would never have hoped to meet again. My child, never forget this great kindness.” The *shangshe* smiled and said, “This is the virtue of the old monk at the village shrine. Otherwise, my nephew would have become a performer.”

The *shangshe* then recounted the monk’s words in full, and all present gnashed their teeth in hatred for his uncle. The next day, the *shangshe* took twenty taels of silver to thank the old monk, but the monk had vanished without a trace. The incense worker handed a sealed letter to the *shangshe*, saying, “The master, just before his departure, instructed me to leave this for the benefactor.” Opening it, they found the boy’s bill of sale. On the back of the contract were six lines written in large characters:

*"Zhen* is male, *Dui* is female,
In one qi they are born.
There is a tender child,
In that grove of the center.
By mountain’s edge and water’s brink,
Pines and cypresses stand dense and deep."

They read it and marveled.

The incense worker said, “The master instructed me to tell the benefactor: proceed two *li* southeast from here, and you may find news of the girl. Take these twenty taels of silver from my sleeve as ransom for her—the temple has no need of them.” The *shangshe* followed his words and set out. After roughly two *li*, he saw a small earthen hill blocking the path. Following the hill south, he came upon a vast, rushing stream, with rows of pines and cypresses lining its banks. Amidst them stood several tiled houses, their doors half ajar. A girl of six or seven years sat inside. The *shangshe* studied her closely—her features bore a striking resemblance to his sworn sister, yet he had no way to confirm the truth.

Suddenly, an old man leaning on a staff emerged. The *shangshe* bowed and inquired, “May I ask your honorable surname?” The man replied, “Lin. And what brings you here, traveler?” The *shangshe* said, “I have just witnessed something most strange and venture to seek your counsel.” The old man asked, “What matter?” The *shangshe* pointed to the young girl and said, “This child is my niece. How did she come to be here?” The old man stared in astonishment for a long moment before saying, “If she is your niece, why was she sold as a servant?” The *shangshe* explained how she had been abducted and sold, then offered to pay double the price to ransom her. The old man refused, saying, “This girl does not even know you as her uncle—how can you falsely claim her?” At a loss for words, the *shangshe* considered returning to consult his sister, but feared matters might change in the interim. As he racked his mind for a solution, a young man emerged from within—an old friend from Suzhou.

Upon seeing the *shangshe*, the youth exclaimed, “When did you return? And where have you come from just now?” The *shangshe* recounted the events. The young man pointed to the old man and said, “This is my father.” Then, turning to his father, he added, “This is the *shangshe* Xu, the kind man I told you about who aided Le’s family in their distress.” The old man was both startled and delighted. Laying down his staff, he bowed in greeting and invited the *shangshe* inside, where they spoke with great warmth and familiarity. The *shangshe* once more broached the subject of ransoming the girl, and both father and son agreed. The young man promptly went inside, returned with the girl, and handed the *shangshe* her bill of sale. The contract bore the name of his uncle, identical to the monk’s. The *shangshe* took out the silver from his sleeve and said, “Half is for ransoming my niece, and half is a gift to honor you, elder.” Both father and son firmly declined.

The *shangshe* would not hear of it, saying, “You have already shown great kindness by agreeing to the ransom. If I do not pay the price, how can my heart be at ease?” He placed the silver on the table, then swiftly took the girl home to return her to his sister, who was overjoyed beyond expectation. The *shangshe* further arranged for a tutor to instruct his niece, and she proved remarkably intelligent, reading dozens of lines each day.

At that time, the *shangshe*’s mother unexpectedly gained a companion for her daily life, and seeing how both her son and the girl were bright and elegant, able to delight the old woman, while Zhangshi was virtuous, gentle, and compliant, never displaying the slightest air of self-righteousness in her kindness, the *shangshe* felt deeply consoled. He then chose an auspicious day to travel once more to Suzhou.

Crossing the river to Hangzhou, he took the route through Jiaxing. When his boat docked at Xishui Post, he suddenly dreamed of two scholars, one old and one young, who came to his boat, bowed in gratitude, and said, “Thanks to you, my wife’s chastity was preserved, and my children’s futures secured. My father and I have petitioned the Heavenly Court, and you shall be granted high honors and noble sons. You must hasten back to Hangzhou to sit for the provincial examination. The celestial roster is already set—you are destined to place first. Do not proceed to Suzhou.”

The *shangshe* laughed and replied, “To pass the examination, one must compose *shiwen*. I have never in my life known what *shiwen* is—how could I possibly succeed?”

The old man said, “It is no difficulty. Tomorrow at noon, moor your boat here. A seller of old books will come—buy them all. Among them, you will find two volumes of examination drafts, both my own works from years past. They contain all the poetry and essay topics for this year’s examination. You need not fear submitting a blank paper.”

He awoke, astonished by the dream.

As dawn approached and he prepared to cast off the mooring line, a fierce wind suddenly arose, preventing the boat from advancing. Restless and idle, he gazed absently from the bow. At dusk, just as in his dream, a man arrived carrying over ten volumes of old books for sale. Recalling the previous night’s vision, he purchased them for a hundred coins and, indeed, found two hand-copied volumes among them. Upon inspection, they appeared to be the very *shiwen* he had been told of. The final volume contained only five-character regulated verse. He mused, “The dream has come true—I should copy these at once and return to Hangzhou instead of proceeding onward.” Then, suddenly chuckling to himself, he thought, “How could an unlearned man possibly pass the examination? I’d only invite ridicule. Besides, the second and third sessions of the provincial examination require classical texts, policy essays, and discourses—these two volumes may not contain them all. How could I complete the entire examination?” Resolved, he decided to wait for the wind to subside before continuing his journey.

No sooner had he settled his mind than weariness overtook him. Sitting down, he dozed off, and once again, the two scholars appeared in his dream. “Why so doubtful?” they asked. “If you fear you cannot compose the classical texts or policy essays, there are two bundles of books at the old shop west of the post station. The first volume on the eastern side contains the classical texts, while the third and fourth on the western side are the policy essays. All this year’s topics are included, even the supplementary essays—hurry and purchase them before it’s too late!” The younger one patted his shoulder and said, “Do not bring ruin upon yourself. Next year’s metropolitan examination topics are all here as well!”

He awoke, even more astonished. Following their instructions, he went to the shop west of the post station and, as foretold, found the volumes of classical texts and policy essays. He bought them and returned, though his heart remained filled with doubt. It was early in the seventh month, the heat still oppressive, and sleep eluded him. As he perused the purchased books, he came upon a volume titled *Records of Karmic Retribution in the Examination Halls*, which mentioned cases of candidates passing despite submitting blank papers. His heart stirred, and he thought, “If I follow the dream’s guidance, might I not be like them?” Yet he dared not fully believe it.

Exhausted at last, he fell asleep, and the two scholars reappeared, admonishing him, “If you still do not trust us, we shall summon your father.” Before they finished speaking, his father indeed arrived. The *shangshe* bowed in greeting, but his father glared at him in anger and said, “The underworld holds examination success in the highest regard. I regret not having taught you to read while I was alive. Now, thanks to the efforts of these two gentlemen, the Emperor has bestowed upon you this opportunity. Yet you would squander a ready-made *juren* and *jinshi* degree—what else do you intend to do, unfilial son?” Trembling, the *shangshe* replied, “I shall return to Hangzhou at once and think no more of it.” His father nodded. “That is the proper course.” Then, pointing to the old man, he said, “This is your sister’s father-in-law, and the younger one is her husband.” The *shangshe* finally understood. Before he could speak further, his father added, “Apply yourself well, so that your father may receive an imperial honor and bring glory to the grave.” With that, he pushed him awake.

At dawn, he instructed the boatman to change course and return to Hangzhou, where he sought lodging by the lake. He entrusted a *mendou* to draft his examination essays. Within days, the posthumous examination papers arrived, and he brought the assigned texts inside—all the topics were among them. He transcribed them neatly and submitted them, ultimately achieving high marks. After completing the three rounds of examinations, he remained at his lodging to await the announcement of results. Indeed, he passed, attended the celebratory feast, and returned home.

Upon arriving, his wife was arguing with the messenger, saying, “My husband is an official in Suzhou—how could he take the provincial examination in Hangzhou? What swindler are you, trying to extort money?” The messenger cried out in protest, “I saw your honored husband at the *Zhigong Tang*, wearing flowers and receiving the feast after passing. Now you deny it to avoid paying the reward?” Amid the clamor, the *shangshe* suddenly entered. The messenger, seeing him, exclaimed, “Is this not the newly honored gentleman?” Zhang-shi, seeing him, asked, “Why have you returned so suddenly?” He smiled and said, “First, pay the messenger, then I will explain.” He took out a generous sum of silver to reward the man.

He entered, bowed to his mother, and the family was reunited. He recounted in detail how he had taken the examination and passed. Then, turning to his sister, he described the appearances of the two scholars, young and old. His sister wept and said, “They were indeed my father-in-law and husband.” Zhang-shi then asked, “Do you know how swiftly Heaven’s justice has acted?” When he inquired further, his sister said, “After Uncle Shou spied on your departure, he used the ancestral rites as a pretext to demand our children, causing repeated disturbances. One day, he and his wife came together, but before they could enter the house, thunder and lightning struck. They were dragged to the market square, forced to kneel facing each other, and died, their bodies charred black as coal.” Xu sighed in astonishment and asked, “Then what became of the house?” They all replied, “We do not know.”

The next day, he went to pay his respects to the county magistrate, recounting in full his sister’s chastity and heroism, as well as how her uncle-in-law had attempted to sell her off, and requested that her family property be restored to her. The magistrate granted his request. At the time, several dozen *mu* of land and a dwelling house remained, all seized by clansmen, but these were all reclaimed and returned to her. The following year, Xu again journeyed to the capital to sit for the metropolitan examination, and this time passed with honors, appointed as a county magistrate. Meanwhile, Zhang Lianju’s husband had five sons—all of whom achieved success in the imperial examinations. Later, her nephew also came of age and passed the examinations in succession, becoming a *jinshi*. The two families continued to intermarry without cease, and to this day remain prominent clans in Shanyin.

The Master of Sitting-Among-Flowers remarked: “That one ignorant of literary arts should aspire to compete in the thorny examination halls and inscribe their name upon the flower-strewn roster is, in truth, something that reason declares impossible. Yet it has come to pass—could this not be because those who perform good deeds beyond all expectation are the very ones who receive rewards beyond all hope? As for the virtuous wife who harbored no jealousy and ultimately bore a unicorn-like son, and the chaste widow who preserved her integrity and was honored with the phoenix decree—while the husband and wife of beastly hearts and bestial conduct ultimately met the same fate, struck dead by lightning and perishing together in the thoroughfare, thus manifesting the reward of good and the punishment of evil—such is only as it should be. Yet the old monk who preserved the heir and refused the gold stands far above them all!”

**24. Tao Shun**

A servant’s duty is to serve his master’s will—
how could he stain his name with lust and theft?
Yet unrepentant, he falsely blamed a beggar still;
how could the courts of darkness suffer such deceit?

Tao Shun was a servant to my great-uncle, the late Minister Yao Wenxi. When Minister Wenxi held office in the capital, my great-grandfather remained at home and entrusted Tao Shun with guarding the gate. Shun carried on an affair with a maidservant and would steal his master’s belongings to sell for money to give her. Once, a single quilt went missing from the study where my four maternal uncles resided—it was Shun who had taken it. The study stood near the side gate, which he often passed through. Just then, a beggar arrived outside the gate seeking alms, and Shun falsely accused him of the theft. When the beggar protested, Shun hastily rallied the other servants to surround and beat him, releasing him only after his injuries grew severe. The beggar died within days.

Before long, Minister Wenxi was appointed educational commissioner of eastern Guangdong and summoned my great-grandfather to join him; Shun accompanied them. After several months there, he fell ill with measles and suddenly went mad. In the depths of winter, he danced naked in the courtyard, and only the strongest could restrain him and place him back in bed.

No sooner had they released him than he leapt up, knelt, and declared, “The city gods of An and Cheng counties have summoned me for trial. I should not have stolen my master’s belongings, nor falsely accused the beggar, nor beaten him to death.” With that, he ordered himself punished, slapping his own cheeks dozens of times. Then he commanded a beating for his legs, threw himself onto the bed, and struck them without count. Both buttocks turned black and blue, as if he had been caned. This continued for days until he shrieked and died.

As death approached, he asked his attendants for silver. They handed him the pouch from his pillow, but he waved it away, saying it was not what he wanted. When they produced paper spirit money from the market, his face lit up. They burned it before him, and Shun waved his hands toward the air, saying, “Take it, all of you—do not complain it is too meager.” This serves as proof that the custom of burning spirit money is not entirely baseless.

**25. The Thief Officer Struck by Lightning**
*Greed stirred in midstream, a thief’s heart arose—*
*Grief came when the great tiller crushed the boat below.*
*By dawn, his accomplices all met heavenly doom—*
*Never say there are no gods, for gods there are.*

When the Guangdong rebels crossed the river to occupy Guazhou and Zhenjiang, the commanding general assembled a naval force at Jiaoshan to block their escape from the river into the sea. Among the troops was one Li, a former helmsman of a small boat who had risen through the ranks to the rank of *bazong* through long service. Arrogant and unrestrained, he was often involved in nighttime raids on the southern embankment.

In the winter of *bingchen*, an elderly couple from Yangzhou was traveling south with their family aboard a fishing boat, sailing swiftly downstream. As they passed Li’s vessel, he hooked their boat and, under the pretext of an inspection, led his men aboard to search. They overturned baskets and emptied chests, seizing over two hundred taels of silver and a casket full of gold and silver jewelry. The couple protested and repeatedly demanded its return. Li threatened them, and the old man, frightened, first begged to keep the jewelry in exchange for the silver, then offered to surrender everything if only they would spare their travel funds—both requests were refused. Enraged, the old man cried, “Has the world truly turned upside down? Is there no justice left in heaven?” He turned the boat, untied the mooring rope, and set off.

Fearing the couple would report him, Li feigned kindness to deceive them, saying, “I was merely jesting with you! But carrying so much at dusk is inconvenient—let us wait until tomorrow morning, and I shall return everything intact.” He then moored the old man’s boat beneath the stern deck. That night, he lowered the massive rudder to crush it, sinking the vessel. The old man, his entire family, and his two sons drowned—eleven in all. Li was immensely pleased with himself.

At the time, there were over twenty men aboard Li’s boat; only five took no part in the scheme, while the rest shared in the spoils. One of the sailors, a certain water-brave named Jia, had long practiced the teachings of the Three Officials Dao. When not in battle, he would kneel night and day in the bow hold, reciting the *Scripture of the Three Officials* without cease. Upon hearing of this affair, he was deeply grieved.

Jia sighed, saying, “This will surely bring manifest retribution—yet what can we do, fellow passengers that we are?” Li’s cohorts all mocked him with scorn.

The next day, Li visited a friend on another boat. Suddenly stricken with a splitting headache, he hastily summoned a ferry to take him back. Midway across the river, the oars abruptly stilled. When Li demanded an explanation, the boatman pointed toward Li’s vessel and said, “Do you not see the Thunder God standing in fury at its bow?” Enraged, Li cursed this as demonic talk and raised the flat of his blade to strike the man. The boatman had no choice but to row on until they reached Li’s ship. The moment Li leapt aboard, a single thunderclap resounded—and he fell dead.

Those on the boat with him saw lightning strike the bow and all rushed to take shelter at the stern. The thunder crashed again, splitting the vessel in two. The rear half, with all aboard, sank at once beneath the waves. The front half remained afloat. At the time, Jia was still reciting scripture in the bow hold; hearing the repeated thunderclaps, he emerged to find Li dead, the ship halved, and not a single soul left among his fellow passengers. Terrified, he clutched his belongings and cried out for help. Someone sent a small boat to fetch him, but before it had traveled a full rod’s length, the thunder roared once more—and the remaining half of the ship instantly sank.

The five who had taken no part in the plot were all lifted by the thunder to the opposite riverbank, where they gradually regained consciousness. Questioned later, they said, “When the thunder struck Li, we too fled to hide. Then, as if in a dream or a daze, we saw a golden-armored deity seize us and carry us away—we had no idea how we came to be here.”

26. The Grave-Digging Soldier

The soldier ought to keep his person bound by law—
how could he bear to rob graves and desecrate tombs?
Breaking coffins, exposing bones, unseen by men—
yet lightning strikes him on the road, his guilt made plain.

In the summer of the bingchen year, beyond the north gate of Danyang, five soldiers were traveling beneath the scorching sun. Suddenly, a thunderclap erupted from the clear sky, killing three of them while the other two remained unharmed. When questioned about the three men’s usual conduct, the two replied with trepidation: “Only today have we learned the terror of thunder. These three, wherever the army was stationed, made grave-robbing their trade, never considering that their deeds might provoke Heaven’s wrath.”

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers laments: "Alas! Since the Red Turbans’ rebellion, crimson headbands have blanketed the land, and blades have scraped the heavens. They seize goods as easily as reaching into a sack—*rang* (pronounced *rǎng*, level tone, meaning ‘to plunder’; *tàn náng*, to thrust one’s hand into a bag to take something, as in Li Gu’s words from *The History of the Five Dynasties*: ‘If the Central Plains employ me as minister, reclaiming the Central Plains would be as effortless as taking something from a bag’)—and treat human lives as no more than grass to be mown—*yì* (pronunciation and meaning: ‘to cut’). How few are those like this lowly officer!

Yet when such men rely on the might of ‘Subduing Waves’ and ‘Crossing Seas’—*fúbō hénghǎi* (referring to generals, as in *The Book of Later Han*: ‘Ma Yuan was appointed General of Subduing Waves and sent south to strike Jiaozhi’; and *Records of the Grand Historian*: ‘General Han Yue was appointed General of Crossing Seas’)—and strike at the hour when the Dipper turns and Orion slants—*dòu zhuǎn shēn héng* (meaning ‘midnight,’ as in Qian Qi’s poem: ‘The Dipper turns, the moon has not yet set’; and Qin Shaoyou’s verse: ‘The moon sets, Orion slants, the painted horn sounds mournful’)—when the weak become meat for the strong to feast upon (a phrase from Han Yu’s *Preface to the Monk Wenchang’s Departure*), who then can punish them? Moreover, on a single boat, who can distinguish the good from the wicked? And yet, how clearly Heaven’s judgment is made manifest!"

At a single thunderclap, the Jing and Wei stand instantly apart—*Jīng Wèi* (the Jing River clear, the Wei River turbid; here used to signify the separation of good and evil)—where the wicked are all executed and the innocent left untouched—*wúgū wǎng jí* (the guiltless not implicated). Shall we call Heaven muddled—*mèngmèng* (as in *The Book of Songs*: ‘Beholding Heaven, so muddled’; *mèngmèng* meaning ‘obscure’)? Yet when has Heaven ever been muddled?

**27. Thunder’s Warning Against Filial Impiety**
The aged and widowed are pitiable souls,
Yet curses and abuse show too little kin.
A warning without execution has its cause—
For he who herds ducks is but a coarse man.

In Jiangyou, a certain Jia made his living herding ducks. His father was old and widowed—*mào* (aged) and *guān* (widower; as in *Mencius*: ‘Old and without a wife is called *guān*’)—and Jia, resenting his father’s idleness, would constantly revile and humiliate him. One day, as he rained down abuse, a sudden thunderclap struck, and Jia was lifted and thrown to his knees in the courtyard. The villagers rushed to see him—his beard, brows, clothes, and trousers all scorched by the lightning’s fire, his spirit and soul dazed, speechless and motionless. Among them was one who could decipher thunder-script, who urged them to quickly overturn the cauldron and look beneath. Following his advice, they found red seal-script characters inscribed there, which read: *Thunder’s Warning Against Filial Impiety*. The villagers pooled their funds to sponsor a *jiào* (a Daoist ritual for prayer and repentance) and carried Jia to kneel before his father. After three days of the ritual, he regained his speech. From then on, he reformed his ways, and the village called him a filial son.

**28. Buried Corpse Receives Reward**
A corpse wrapped in felt, buried by the roadside,
As if the Blue Sky’s Marshal had arranged it so.
Only then did he know official rank depends on hidden virtue—
His palace-examination essays were far from fine.

The father of Marshal Xiao Chunxi, the venerable Pin Sanfeng, served as Warden of the Yichang Prefecture Prison in Hubei. When the White Lotus rebels ravaged Hubei—*róulìn* (trampled, meaning ‘laid waste’)—Yichang was thrown into alarm. Vowing to die for his post, Pin Sanfeng ordered an old servant to escort the Marshal to the capital to seek refuge with his elder brother, a clerk in the Ministry. At the time, weapons blotted out the sky, and bones filled the fields.

Once, while traveling on the road, he came upon a corpse lying naked by the wayside. Moved with pity, Marshal Xiao ordered his servant to bury it by the road, and he even removed the red felt mat he had been sitting on to wrap the body.

In the *xinyou* year’s provincial examination, an examiner in his assigned hall received Marshal Xiao’s paper and was about to discard it. Suddenly, he saw something standing upright before his desk—its entire body was red, yet its face, hands, and feet were indistinguishable. Greatly alarmed, he suspected the discarded paper bore some hidden cause and retrieved it to review again. Finding it unremarkable, he resolved to discard it once more, only for the red figure to reappear before him. Three times he cast it aside, and three times it manifested. At last, he recommended the paper to the chief examiner, who sternly reprimanded him. The examiner remained silent, offering no explanation.

That night, the chief examiner also saw a red apparition moving about his desk. The next day, he recounted this to others. Someone familiar with the examiner’s rejection of the paper informed the chief examiner, who nodded in acknowledgment. That evening, the red figure again stood before him. Tentatively, he retrieved the paper and reviewed it—only for the apparition to vanish. When he placed it among the rejected papers, the figure reappeared as before. With no other recourse, he ranked it last among the successful candidates.

After the results were announced, the examiner questioned Marshal Xiao, who could offer no explanation. Upon returning home and recounting the matter to his servant, the servant replied, “Could this be the corpse you buried by the roadside that day?” Marshal Xiao asked, “Why was its entire body red?” The servant answered, “Did you not remove the red felt mat you were sitting on to wrap it? How could you have forgotten?” Marshal Xiao was struck with sudden realization.

Later, through the *datiao* selection, Marshal Xiao was appointed magistrate of a county in Jiangsu, where he earned the epithet “Blue Sky Xiao.” He rose to the rank of Vice Prefect of Suzhou. The *Master of the Flower Seat* remarks: “Marshal Xiao once governed Nanhui, where his administration was marked by benevolent policies. After his death, his family resided in this district. In the autumn of the *jiayin* year, bandits besieged the city, and it fell. Many of the rebels were local villagers, yet they took care not to violate the household of ‘Blue Sky Xiao.’”

The following day, he prepared boats, gathered all his family and possessions, and escorted them beyond the borders, where they knelt in farewell and departed. Even bandits follow the Dao—this alone shows how a principled official may yet prevail!

**29. The Shaanxi Scholar**

Was that fodder-cutter real or not?
His trembling heart still boasted of wrestling ghosts’ might.
A jest turned to no good end—
The wronged soul seized the chance to claim his life.

A certain scholar from Shaanxi studied the legalist arts of Shen Buhai and Han Fei. In his youth, he once misapplied a legal precedent, wrongly condemning a man to death. Ever after, he lived in dread, often recounting the tale to others, fearing that karmic retribution was inescapable.

Later, he accepted a teaching post in a county, where many of his colleagues delighted in telling ghost stories. The scholar, priding himself on his courage, declared that if evil ghosts truly existed, he would seize them with his bare hands. His companions sought a way to test his boldness.

As a banquet was soon to be held, they arrived early at a post station outside the city, where they found no one about. Only in the stables did they encounter a fodder-cutter, his face gaunt and sallow, his frame tall and dark, exuding an eerie presence. The group whispered among themselves, “This man will serve to test the scholar.” They approached him and said, “Tomorrow, we will have someone hide you beneath the bed. After the scholar falls asleep, you are to creep out and lift the bed-curtain to startle him. Can you do this?” The man replied, “I can.” “If you succeed, we will reward you handsomely.” His face brightened with evident delight.

The next day, after the feast concluded and the second watch had begun, the scholar returned to his room and lay down. His companions concealed themselves beneath the window to watch in secret. After a short while, the man emerged from under the bed. Instead of immediately lifting the curtain, he struck his chest and pounded his breast, his ghostly aura chilling the air. The onlookers were all filled with doubt.

Suddenly, they saw the man crouch upon the scholar’s desk, reaching into his robe to draw out a corner of an official document—its red and black ink vivid and gleaming. He leered at the sleeper within the bed-curtain and laughed. The onlookers grew even more suspicious.

The man sprang up, lunging straight for the bed. He flung back the curtain and cried out. From afar, they saw the scholar also lift the curtain and emerge, the two facing each other for a long while. Then the man rolled up his sleeves and strode forward. The scholar shrieked wildly and collapsed to the ground. The group, seized with terror, broke down the door and rushed in to save him, but his breath had already ceased. They searched in all four directions for the man, yet he had vanished without a trace. Inquiring throughout the post station, they found no such person had ever been there. Only then did they realize he was a vengeful ghost, seizing the moment to claim a life.

Master Zuohua recorded this and sighed, saying: “Those who assist others with the harsh methods of Shen Buhai and Han Fei—ought they not be cautious? Yet even in the case of this scholar, his error was merely the result of youth and insufficient mastery of his craft, a momentary misjudgment. Still, after so many years, he met with such a grim retribution. How much more perilous for those who wield the power of life and death, yet regard only bribes?”

When silver crosses the palm, black and white are swiftly confounded—thus, those released from judgment die with grievances unredressed, while the innocent, ensnared in false charges, suffer execution. For officials and their advisors who act thus—what manner of retribution awaits them?”

**30. A Certain Man of Keqiao**
*Betraying a brother’s trust, he reenacts the shame of Xintai—*
*Gnawing his leg in terror, he beholds a black hound’s approach.*
*Devoid of all shame, his life is forfeit—*
*Yet the ghost’s cry of “joy” is but lamentable sorrow.*

In Keqiao Town of Kuaiji, a certain Jia lay gravely ill. Entrusting his young son and daughter-in-law to his younger brother, Yi, he pleaded: “I am dying, and you remain unmarried. Our ancestral line depends solely on this child. I beg you, raise him well, that he may grow to manhood and continue our lineage. Then, though I perish, I shall not be forgotten.” With these words, he clasped his brother’s hand and passed away.

Yi adopted his nephew as his own son. At first, he cared for the boy with great devotion, earning praise from the village. Yet as time passed, the boy remained in tender youth, while the daughter-in-law had reached the age of twenty, her hair now bound with a hairpin. A poor household with few rooms, they dwelt together from dawn to dusk. Soon after, Yi forgot his vow upon the deathbed, and in a sudden lapse, brought upon himself the disgrace of Xintai. His infamy spread far and wide, and those who once commended him now turned to mockery. Several years passed...

After several years, the son had reached the age of twenty, yet Yi still compelled his daughter-in-law to share his bed each night, relegating the son to sleep beneath the bed. The son wept in silence through the long nights, too fearful to speak.

On the Winter Solstice, Yi recalled his brother’s coffin, left exposed in the fields—its thatch rotted away, offering no shelter from wind or rain. He wove a mat of reeds to replace the decayed covering. No sooner had he arrived at the burial site than a black dog suddenly lunged from behind the coffin, sinking its teeth into his leg. Yi shrieked and collapsed; those accompanying him helped him home. Once there, he began to speak in his brother’s voice, rebuking himself for betraying his kin and debauching his daughter-in-law. He struck his own cheeks until they swelled, then tore open his scrotum—flesh shredding and falling away in pieces. “Our ancestors kill this shameless wretch!” he cried, and with repeated shouts of “How satisfying!” he died.

**III. Three Accounts from the Eastern Marchmount Temple at An’gang**

The Eastern Marchmount of Mount Tai, domain of Qi and Qing,
Even a village god may wield divine might.
Hearing of An’gang in Dantu’s tale,
How many spring dreams startle awake?

In An’gang Town, Dantu County, stands a branch temple of the Eastern Marchmount, its numinous power resplendent, its responses as swift as an echo. A neighboring village harbored an unfilial son, against whom his mother lodged a complaint with the circuit intendant. The intendant detained the son, but the case remained unresolved. Each day, the man’s wife knelt weeping beside her mother-in-law, pleading for mercy on her husband’s behalf.

The mother, moved to pity, gave twenty silver taels to Zhao of An’gang Town, asking him to present them to the circuit intendant in hopes of securing her son’s release. Zhao concealed most of the sum, offering only five taels to the intendant. The intendant, enraged, rejected the bribe and declared he would send the case to the county court. Zhao emerged and deceived the plaintiff, claiming the intendant’s demands were exorbitant—unless forty taels were swiftly delivered, the case would be forwarded to the county for adjudication under the statute on unfilial impiety. Terrified, the mother returned home, preparing to sell her property to meet the demand.

Just then, word spread that the wife intended to hang herself. Fearing the liability of a death, the intendant promptly sent the son to the county. Upon hearing this, the wife indeed hanged herself. Several days later, Zhao, napping in broad daylight, suddenly leapt up and rushed frantically into the Eastern Marchmount Temple, crying out along the way: “I was wrong to embezzle fifteen taels from the plaintiff’s family, delaying the case’s resolution and causing the woman’s tragic death. Now she has lodged a complaint against me, and the Marchmount Emperor has summoned me for interrogation—I shall surely die!”

Upon entering the temple, he prostrated himself beneath the altar table, wailing piteously as though being beaten. Then, all fell silent. When they looked, his thighs bore overlapping welts from a cudgel, and his breath was barely perceptible. Carried home, he died the following day.

A certain young man suffered from consumption. Someone suggested that a cat’s afterbirth could be compounded into medicine to cure the illness. His family followed this advice, procured one, and mixed it into the medicine they fed the patient. The disease indeed abated. Several months later, the patient suddenly saw two attendants in black robes arrive with a summons, declaring that he had been accused by the cat. One remained to guard his body while the other led him away.

They arrived at an official tribunal, its halls vast and towering, where the Marchmount Emperor sat facing south in full regalia, his retinue arrayed in solemn ranks. A cat crouched beneath the dais, speaking in human words, and lodged its complaint: it had been wrongfully killed when its afterbirth was taken. The young man argued that the act had been committed by his family without his knowledge. The Emperor ordered twenty strikes to his cheeks as a light punishment, then instructed him: “I now release you, but you must swiftly engage the Daoist priest of such-and-such an abbey to perform rites for the cat, guiding it back to the human realm and preventing further karmic debt in future lives.” The young man prostrated himself and bowed in gratitude, after which the black-robed attendants supported him home. Upon waking, his cheeks were swollen.

He urgently told his family to summon the Daoist priest and arrange the ritual. The priest demanded an exorbitant fee, but the impoverished family could not meet it and temporarily set the matter aside—though their hearts remained uneasy. One day, as the young man laughed and chatted with his family, he suddenly glared and cried out in a frenzy: “The black-robed attendants have returned!” He then fell into a prolonged stupor, his mouth speaking in the voice of one of the attendants: “I was dispatched by the Emperor on a distant errand, and now I remain here to guard your household. Would you begrudge me even a cup of plain tea? If I leave, your home will collapse—how then could you ever return to the world of the living?” With this, he gnashed his teeth in fury. The family hastily served him tea, and he drained over ten cups.

Neighbors, hearing of this, flocked to inquire about their deceased kin in the netherworld. Whatever they asked, the answers proved accurate. After nearly a full day, he again spoke in the attendant’s voice: “Your family member has returned!” With that, he collapsed, and after a moment, revived, his mind clear as before. When questioned, he recounted that he had been taken to the same place, where the Marchmount Emperor rebuked him for breaking his promise. Though the reprimand was severe, he escaped further punishment and was merely ordered to hasten the rites. His family then exhausted their resources to comply. Thereafter, all fell quiet.

On the waters of An’gang River dwelt an ancient soft-shelled turtle, who led his kin in residence, their numbers flourishing. Along the river, fishermen would sometimes catch turtles the size of basins and present them to the unofficially wealthy Zhao. Zhao found them delicious and paid handsomely. Delighted, the fishermen redoubled their efforts, catching turtles by every means and offering them to Zhao, always returning with substantial profits. This became their regular practice.

Over a year later, Zhao suddenly dreamed he was at the Temple of the Eastern Marchmount, facing judgment with a being who had a pointed head and a plump body. This being identified itself as the ancient turtle of the river and accused Zhao of slaughtering his descendants to satisfy his appetite. The Marchmount Emperor questioned Zhao, who confessed the fishermen’s offerings. The Emperor rebuked Zhao: “This ancient turtle has made its home here for years, never harming travelers. What did the fishermen know? You, a man of wealth, instead of releasing life to accumulate merit, have indulged your gluttony, taking many lives. The nether laws cannot forgive you.”

Zhao pleaded for a chance to reform, vowing: “If you release me, I will abstain from killing and release living creatures. I will forever refrain from eating cattle, dogs, or any creatures rarely seen, to atone for my past transgressions.” After repeated entreaties, the Emperor ordered a light caning to appease the ancient turtle’s anger. After the punishment, he admonished Zhao: “A single good thought brings blessings from spirits. If you truly abstain from killing, release life, and forever refrain from eating cattle and dogs, you will receive good fortune. But if you persist in your former indulgence, I will not pardon you again.” He then commanded ghostly attendants to escort Zhao out.

Upon awakening, Zhao found his thighs bruised and swollen with purple welts, the pain lingering for days—only with a staff could he rise and walk. Without concealment or evasion, he recounted the entire ordeal to warn others. From that day forth, he forbade his household from consuming the flesh of turtles, terrapins, water monitors, cattle, horses, donkeys, or dogs, and spared no expense in purchasing creatures to set them free. Within a few years, his family’s wealth flourished, and he became the most prosperous man in the village.

**32. Prefect Cai**
*A single writ, penned by his own hand—*
*He repaid another’s debt of three thousand.*

Now at last he believed in the doctrine of karmic rebirth—
*In court robes they met, bound by ties across lifetimes.*

Master Cai Xiaoxia, while serving as provincial governor of Shaanxi (as the *Book of Songs* says, *"The noble man is a fence, the great state a screen"*—here meaning he held the office of provincial treasurer in Shaanxi), had a subordinate magistrate who, due to old age and illness, petitioned for retirement. This magistrate had misappropriated three thousand taels from the public treasury, a deficit later exposed by his successor. At the time, the laws were exceedingly strict: embezzlement of even a few hundred taels resulted in confiscation of property and imprisonment to compel repayment. If the debt remained unpaid by the deadline, the penalty was death. The magistrate had been incorruptible in office, and after retirement, he possessed scarcely a single tael. Moreover, he was upright and aloof, with few connections (as the *Book of Later Han* says of Wang Fu, *"unyielding and unswayed by worldly customs"*), and among his colleagues, none could be relied upon for aid. He could only await his doom in silent resignation.

Governor Cai, learning of his plight, took pity on him. The next day, he summoned the magistrate and, dismissing all attendants, said to him: *"I know you lack the means to repay the three thousand taels you owe. Prepare a memorial requesting resolution, and I will endorse it to close the case."* The magistrate, stunned, replied, *"I dare not."* The governor smiled and said, *"I do not jest. I pity your integrity and the fact that you were wronged in service to the public. I intend to use my rightful salary to make up the deficit for you. However, this matter cannot be resolved in a day, so I wish first to endorse your memorial to spare you the hardship of prolonged detention."* The magistrate, overwhelmed by this unexpected kindness, could not speak; he kowtowed and withdrew.

The following day, he submitted the memorial as instructed. Governor Cai personally inscribed the date of repayment, affixed his seal, and returned it to him. The magistrate, dressed in his court robes, entered to express his gratitude. Kneeling, he declared in a loud voice: *"I owe you a debt of rebirth. I am old now and can never repay you in this life—after death, I will beg to be reborn in your family to repay this great kindness."* He then departed.

Over a decade later, Governor Cai also retired and returned to his hometown.

Seated in the hall, his vision blurred in drowsiness, Governor Cai suddenly saw the magistrate enter in court robes to express his gratitude—no different from before. He thought to himself: *This is not the Shaanxi provincial yamen, and the magistrate has long since returned home. How could he be here?* Just as he was bewildered, the magistrate strode directly inside. Startled, Governor Cai cried out and awoke, only to be told from the inner chamber that his son had been born.

Governor Cai declared, *"This is the man reborn! He shall revive our family."* Thus, he named him Zhenwu, with the courtesy name Linzhou. Before reaching adulthood, the boy already ranked first among the child scholars. In the bingshen year, he passed the metropolitan examination and entered the Hanlin Academy. Later, as an observer in eastern Guangdong, he earned a reputation for good governance. As a provincial governor and grand coordinator, his rise to prominence came with effortless ease.

**33. The Murdered Maid’s Vengeance**

A wife of a wealthy household in Hangzhou was exceedingly arrogant and fierce. She treated her maidservants with brutal cruelty; the slightest displeasure would leave them flogged until their skin was shredded. Once, she beat a maid to death with a rod. Her mother-in-law, upon hearing of this, sternly reprimanded her, but she refused to repent. Later, she even resorted to the punishment of *paoluo*—roasting with hot iron!

One day, a maid displeased her. Enraged, she heated an iron in blazing coals until it glowed red, stripped the maid naked, and branded her flesh until her entire body was scorched and blistered. The maid shrieked in agony before dying. Within days, the mistress fell into a mad frenzy. The two maids possessed her body, demanding their lives in return. At times, she tore out her own hair; at others, she slapped her own face. Needles pierced her, blades slashed her—all mirroring the torments she had inflicted upon them.

Her mother-in-law came to question her. The possessed woman knelt and addressed her as "Old Mistress," saying, *"Though we are dead, we dare not forget your kindness."* The mother-in-law urged them to abandon their vengeance and promised to invite eminent monks to perform rites for their salvation. The maids refused, saying, *"Had the young mistress heeded your words, we would not have died unjustly. Before you, Old Mistress, we dare not be disrespectful—but we cannot delay her death."* Thereafter, whenever the mother-in-law visited, the woman’s demeanor would briefly clear. Once the mother-in-law departed, the torment resumed, until at last they claimed her life.

**34. The Headless Men**

Great crimes demand meticulous investigation; though the execution date draws near, one must not act in haste. A village headman is no match for a grand marshal—how pitiful that the lowly pay for the sins of the mighty.

In the autumn of the *bingchen* year, a vast army gathered in Danyang. Grand Marshal Xiang, the Loyal and Martial Duke, perished in the camp. Governor Yiyue of the Imperial Residence, traveling from Changzhou to assume command, was met by six military officers from Guangxi. Acting on their commander’s orders, they escorted him back. Passing through Lǚchéng, their boat clashed with a civilian vessel. The six officers, wielding their authority, leapt aboard the civilian boat with drawn blades. They struck a man into the water with the flat of their swords and plundered the silver aboard.

The civilians cried out for help. At that moment, the militia of Lǚchéng had gathered along both banks, awaiting the grand marshal’s arrival. Hearing the shouts from the river, they rushed to the scene. The six officers fought desperately with their weapons. Mistaking them for bandits, the militia overpowered them, killing three and binding the remaining three. By then, the crowd had surged forward, blades and cudgels raining down. Reason was no longer possible—they slew all three captives. Only two boatmen managed to slip away and flee, rushing to report the incident to their commander.

The wing commander flew into a rage and sternly ordered the Dānyáng County magistrate to apprehend the criminals and prepare for their execution. At that time, the magistrate of Dānyáng was a certain *Sīmǎ* (a title equivalent to *tóngzhī*, or vice-magistrate), who had been acting in the post for a year. His replacement had already been appointed, following the custom that "when the melons ripen, the relief arrives." Suddenly confronted with this major case—and warned that he would not be permitted to hand over his duties until the criminals were captured and the case closed—the *Sīmǎ* was terrified. He posted a hefty reward for their capture. Within twenty days, five of the criminals were seized, but one, Jīn Ādé, remained at large. The wing commander insisted on the principle of "a life for a life," and no exception could be made for the missing man. Ādé’s elder brother, who served as the village head (*lǐzhèng*, or local constable) of Lǚchéng, had been in the city to deliver the other prisoners. He was seized as well and thrown into prison, where he was executed alongside the five others in the marketplace. The case was thus closed, and the *Sīmǎ* handed over his seal before returning to the provincial capital. No sooner had he arrived at his residence than he fell ill. His household, young and old, all saw a headless ghost following a long-haired figure as they wandered through the halls. On the day of his death, a maidservant emerged from the *Sīmǎ*’s bedchamber and saw the long-bearded man leading the headless ghost straight into the room. She screamed and collapsed to the ground. Those keeping vigil rushed in upon hearing her cries, but by the time the maidservant revived, the *Sīmǎ* had already passed away.

The Master of the Flowery Couch remarked: "When matters arise suddenly, the lives of common folk hang in the balance. Those who govern (*sīmù*, referring to officials at all levels) should argue on principle, plead for the people’s lives, and strive for the highest good. Failing that, they should mediate between higher and lower, lighten the severity of the sentence, and ensure that the living are free of grievance and the dead accept their fate—this is the next best course. But to disregard the lives of the people, bowing only to power and authority, leaving the wretched with no recourse until they are led in droves to execution—though their bodies die, their hearts do not. How fitting that they should return as vengeful spirits!

*Three, Five: Vermilion-Marked Examination Papers*
Guard well what you write in life’s span,
For the provincial exams reveal your plan.
Awakened from a dream with three cries of "Wrong!"
Vermilion-marked papers—ten exams undone.

In the autumn of Xīnhài during the reign of Xiánfēng, at the first session of the provincial examinations in Zhèjiāng, a candidate from Yín County had completed his three essays, with both draft and fair copies finished. The sky had yet to brighten, so he sat and dozed. In his half-slumber, he suddenly cried out in a loud voice, "I was wrong! I know my guilt!"

The candidate then scrawled upon his examination paper in large characters: *"For cutting off a man’s lineage, the penalty is ten sessions of provincial examinations barred, and his name shall be recorded in the Register of the Childless and Solitary."* Beside it, he wrote: *"By Order of the Great Demon-Quelling Emperor."* At daybreak, he staggered from his cell to submit his paper. The examiner, seeing the fresh vermilion script splashed across the page, searched his satchel but found no red brush. Observing the man—dazed and witless—they knew a ghost still clung to him. Supporting him out, they inscribed his name upon the rejection list. This account was witnessed firsthand in the examination hall by Gentleman Yáo Yòuqīng.

*Thirty-Six: A Dream of Cranes Dancing*
Why did cranes appear in dreams the night before?
In the vast hall, they seemed so full of grace.
Yet when the cranes took flight, hope turned to vain longing—
Where once there was affection, now only sorrow remains.

A certain eminent scholar of our Háng Prefecture, though poor, possessed such striking beauty that he was called "the Jade Man." After passing the provincial examination, he took up a teaching post in the grand household of Wúmén.

At this time, the grand household was celebrating a joyous occasion, its halls adorned for feasting and well-wishes, with courtesans and musicians arrayed in full display. A renowned courtesan, unmatched in beauty and artistry of her age, dreamed the night before that in a vast gathering, she saw a crane standing on one leg, dancing before her. Its feathered robe swayed in graceful motion, its purity and elegance utterly captivating. A bystander told her, *"This is the one to whom you shall be bound for life."* The courtesan then combed its plumes, and with a flutter of its wings, it soared away—startling her awake.

The next day, as she arrived at the grand household to perform at the banquet, she found the brilliantly lit hall just as she had seen in her dream. At that moment, half the distinguished scholars of Wú Prefecture were present, yet she could not tell which of them was the man from her vision. After several rounds of wine, the guests rose to disperse and change attire. The eminent scholar removed his formal robes and donned a white lined garment, resting one foot upon a chair as he stood facing the courtesan. His bearing was noble and striking, his features as finely drawn as a painting. An acquaintance of the courtesan teased her, *"This is such-and-such a gentleman—do you two make a fitting pair?"*

Though the courtesan merely smiled faintly, she reflected that the dream had aligned with reality, and seeing the eminent scholar’s dignified and composed bearing, she knew he was destined for greatness. Seizing an opportune moment, she secretly conveyed her tender feelings. She invited the scholar to her home, offering herself to him. The scholar, captivated by her beauty and moved by her earnest devotion, could not bring himself to refuse harshly. At the time, his lute strings were broken, and so they pledged a vow of lifelong union. The courtesan, already possessed of considerable wealth, rejoiced in having found her destined match. Once she had given herself to the scholar, she closed her door to all other guests. Whatever the scholar desired, she spared no effort to procure for him.

The following year, the scholar traveled north to the capital for the imperial examinations. The courtesan generously provided him with gold, enabling him to expand his connections. He passed the metropolitan examination and entered the Hanlin Academy. When he took leave to return home, he detoured through Suzhou, where their affection deepened. They pledged that upon reaching Hangzhou to inform his parents, he would prepare betrothal gifts and formally welcome her into his household.

Yet upon his return, he discovered that his father had already arranged his marriage to another family! Bound by his father’s strict discipline, the scholar dared not utter a word. In the end, he broke his promise. The courtesan waited in vain, and when she sent someone to inquire at his home, she learned he had already wed. She wrote to reproach him, even expressing her willingness to serve as his concubine, but received no reply. When his leave ended and he returned to the capital, he passed through Suzhou yet dared not approach her door.

The courtesan, having long since ceased receiving guests, saw her beauty fade and her wealth depleted. Some urged her to take up her pipa again, but she would only sigh deeply and remain silent, ultimately dying in sorrow. When the scholar later heard of her death, he would often exclaim to others, *"Fufu!"*—a cry of deep remorse.

In his later years, the scholar had a son who, upon growing older, proved fond of dissipation and squandered the family fortune. It was said that the moment the child was born, the courtesan had appeared in the room.

The Master of the Flower Seat remarked: *"The scholar, fearing to defy his parents, thus committed the fault of heartless betrayal. If we weigh his intentions, his offense may yet be somewhat mitigated. Yet having once admired her beauty and exhausted her wealth—during their tender and joyous union, did he truly not know his family’s strictness? How could he have so lightly pledged his word? When she, in desperation, offered to accept even the lowest rank of concubine, he might have humbled himself to comply—but he did not even deign to reply. Alas! How could he be so cruel?"*

"37. The Second Wife Struck by Lightning
On her deathbed, she knew her successor’s heart—
With tearful, earnest pleas, she made her last request.
How could she bear to wound him with poison’s art?
Heaven’s thunder severed her arm—a warning dire.

A certain man, Jia, lost his wife in middle age, leaving behind a son only a few years old. Unable to endure widowhood, Jia heard that a woman of the same neighborhood, a Miss Chen, was beautiful, and took her as his second wife. She bore him two sons. Chen was secretly treacherous and harbored hatred for her stepson. Fortunately, Jia’s authority as head of the household remained strong, and she dared not act on her malice. Though her heart was biased, in Jia’s presence she carried, embraced, and raised the boy as if he were more cherished than her own. Before long, Jia also died.

On his deathbed, he took the hand of his first wife’s son and said to Chen: *'Our meager estate, divided three ways, should still suffice for modest comfort. This child lost his mother in infancy; without your care, how could he have grown to this age? Now that I am dying, I beg you to continue treating him well and not let him suffer want.'* With lingering reluctance, he passed away.

After his death, Chen’s evil intentions suddenly surfaced, and she treated her stepson like a slave. In clothing and food, she refused to let him share equally with her own sons."

The "reed-flower heart of blackness"—such evil is without equal. Once, she dreamed her husband sternly admonished her, yet she still did not reform. Her stepson, however, was deeply filial; in all things, he sought to please his stepmother. As he grew older, he apprenticed at a money shop, and whatever he earned, he dutifully offered to her—only to incur her ever-greater resentment.

One day, she steamed rice cakes and called her eldest son home to eat them. Suddenly, a thunderclap resounded, and she was flung to her knees in the courtyard, still clutching the cakes. She confessed that she had laced them with poison, intending to murder her stepson so her own son could seize the entire inheritance. But her husband and his first wife had rushed to the gods to plead their case, and thus she was struck by lightning. Hearing this, her eldest son hurried home and, with his two brothers, knelt and wailed, praying to heaven to spare their mother. After a full day and night, thunder crashed again, breaking one of her arms before she could rise. From then on, she repented and reformed, treating all three sons as her own.

**Three Eight: Gu Yunqiao**

*Three branches of the jade tree snapped in grief—*
*To turn from one’s roots, to forsake one’s kin, is to invite such retribution.*
*Ghosts may hunger, but mortal lives are fleeting;*
*For another’s sake, one must not sever another’s line.*

Gu Yunqiao’s father was originally the son of the Liuhe Cheng clan but was adopted into the Gu family. By Yunqiao’s generation, the Cheng lineage had no heir. Relatives from both families agreed that Yunqiao had an elder brother, born of the main wife, who should have carried on the Gu line, while Yunqiao himself ought to have returned to the Cheng clan—both by ritual and by law, this would have been proper. But Yunqiao, unwilling to inconvenience his own interests, refused.

Thus, the sacrifices to the Cheng ancestors were cut off entirely. At the time, Yunqiao had three sons, all bright and promising, with hopes of future success. His eldest son, having just passed twenty, was about to marry when he suddenly fell ill. In his sickness, he saw several men and women demanding sacrifices from him, and he descended into madness. He would cry out for Yunqiao, reproaching him for forsaking his roots and abandoning his kin. All who witnessed this knew the Cheng ancestors’ ghosts were exacting vengeance. They urged Yunqiao to marry off his eldest son and restore him to the Cheng clan, but Yunqiao still refused. The eldest son soon died.

Yunqiao then arranged marriages for his two younger sons, his uncle’s second and third children. Within a year, both sons perished in succession. Yunqiao had each of their widowed wives bear a grandson, but one of them died young. Soon after, Yunqiao himself followed them to the grave. Now, only one young grandson remains, already afflicted with spitting blood. Whether this fragile thread of descent will endure—whether the gods and spirits will secretly aid him—remains unseen.

The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: "I once met Gu Yunqiao in passing. I heard he was a man of considerable sincerity and prudence, yet by a single misguided thought, he fell into the sorrow of the Nine Springs! For descendants, how can one be so blinded by profit as to forget righteousness?"

**39. Oral Retribution**

Two instances must not be held against each other—
Yet within a few short years, retribution arrives in strange guise.
Heed a wife’s words, and the household is sure to decline;
How can a hen presume to take the rooster’s crow at dawn?

A certain gentleman of a great clan traveled to the capital to seek office. From Jiangyou, he brought his wife and children, escorting his venerable mother to Yangzhou. There, his clansman, Prefectural Vice-Director So-and-So, was serving as Salt Controller in the Southern Bureau. The gentleman entrusted his family to the vice-director’s yamen while he proceeded alone to the capital. Before his appointment could be secured, he died in his lodgings.

At that time, the venerable mother was already advanced in years, and the gentleman’s wife was nearing childbirth and often ailing. When the news of his death arrived, the vice-director plotted to conceal it temporarily, waiting until the wife had given birth and completed her month of confinement before making it known. The vice-director’s concubine, a certain Madam So-and-So, had managed the inner household as the senior chamber attendant since the passing of his principal wife. Upon hearing this plan, she alone objected, saying, “Each family keeps to its own affairs—how can a funeral matter be long imposed upon another household?” She promptly went and revealed the truth, urging them to rent another residence so that they might properly set up a mourning altar and don mourning attire. Though the vice-director reproached her, the words had already been spoken, and there was nothing to be done.

Several years later, the vice-director was promoted through recommendation to govern a major prefecture. He departed alone for his post, leaving his family in Jinchang to await further instructions. At that time, the prefect was still in his prime, his record of governance—marked by diligence and integrity—standing foremost among the Three Wu regions.

The singular favor of imperial recognition, bestowed from the nine-tiered palace steps, had raised him to the rank of provincial governor and judicial commissioner—success so assured it seemed within easy reach. Yet his wife, having long overseen the household with the dignity of an equal consort, remained unaware of fate’s swift turn.

That year marked her thirtieth birthday. On the appointed day, she adorned the halls with lanterns and music, accepting congratulations from all her kin, reveling in her own contentment. What she did not know was that the prefect, before even assuming his post, had fallen gravely ill upon reaching Yuanzhou and died suddenly—just one day before her celebration. The news of his death arrived in time.

Her sons and nephews all urged that they wait until after her birthday to announce the mourning and begin the rites of lamentation. But the prefect’s eldest son, who happened to be in Suzhou, stood firm against it, saying, “What manner of grave matter is this? How could we still feast and accept felicitations while mourners stand at the gate?”

The eldest son entered the inner chambers to inform Lady So-and-so of the grim tidings, then personally led the household in removing all lanterns and decorations, changing into mourning garb, and beginning the rites of lamentation.

The Master of the Flower Banquet remarked, “This incident, passed down in common talk, occurred no more than a few years ago, yet it remains a byword to this day. Alas! Women and petty-minded folk, ignorant of great principle, often feign righteous argument to serve their own ends. Though those who suffer such impositions may offer no immediate rebuttal, the resentment festers in their hearts like a bone-deep thorn, lingering long after. What is sown in the earth waits only for its season to sprout. As the saying goes, ‘Words that issue forth in defiance shall return in defiance.’ How true!”

**40. The Great Stone Lad**

*Where the cowherd once sought the Dragon King’s grace,*
*All praise the mighty Stone Lad of Chongming’s place.*
*When floods threatened Liu River’s shore,*
*Two lands owed him incense evermore.*

The Great Stone Lad was a native of Chongming. Of forthright bearing, great strength, and courage, he was especially fond of releasing living creatures. In his youth, he herded cattle by the sea, and whenever he came upon shrimp, snails, clams, or mussels, he would gather and release them, never killing so much as a single creature.

Once, a large clam rode the tide ashore and settled on the sand. With every opening and closing of its shell, a dazzling radiance flashed forth, growing even more brilliant at night. Onlookers all declared it must contain a luminous pearl, and that whoever obtained it would gain untold wealth. They clamored to split it open and seize the treasure, but the Great Lad refused, saying, “It is a numinous being—it must not be harmed.”

He then pushed through the crowd, lifted the clam, and cast it back into the sea, where it rode the tide away.

Several years later, the rice fields along the coast were often trampled by some creature. Those who lay in wait to observe saw an ox. When they drove it off, it fled toward the seashore. They thus pointed to it as the ox the Great Lad had herded and reported the matter to its owner to demand recompense. The Great Lad made no defense but thought to himself that the oxen he had herded had never once strayed, so how could they trample others’ fields?

Soon after, another complaint came that an ox had eaten the field’s grain. Enraged, the Great Lad went to the place under cover of night and concealed himself to wait. At dawn the next day, he indeed saw a massive ox, its coat and horns strikingly fine, bearing a strong resemblance to his own ox. It emerged from the seashore and frolicked along the field ridges, wreaking havoc as it trampled.

The Great Lad sprang up and seized it, but the ox, startled, wheeled around and fled. He gave chase, and step by step it entered the sea. Enraged, the Great Lad followed it into the waters. The waves parted, and towering billows stood like walls. Suddenly, he saw a grand estate—its gates and walls soaring high, resplendent in gold and jade. The ox leapt through the gate, and in his fury, the Great Lad pursued it inside. The guards shouted at him to stop, but he refused to yield and charged forward in defiance. Then a young nobleman, richly attired, emerged from within and barked at the crowd: “What rogue dares force his way in here? Seize him at once—do not let him escape!” The guards all rushed forward with all their might to apprehend him.

Amidst the Great Lad’s alarm and distress, the young nobleman eyed him repeatedly, then suddenly asked in astonishment, “Are you not the Great Lad who herds oxen by the seaside shoals?” The Great Lad replied, “Indeed, I am.” “Then you are my benefactor! How have you come here?” He sharply ordered the guards to withdraw, then ushered the Great Lad into the hall. Seated, he explained, “This is the Dragon Palace, and I am the Dragon King’s youngest son. Yesterday, I transformed into a clam and went out for a stroll—had you not graciously aided me, I would have nearly fallen into the hands of children. Your great kindness has long gone unrequited; now that I have fortunately encountered you, it truly fulfills my long-held wish. Yet this place lies deep beneath the sea—how were you able to come here?”

The Great Lad told him the truth. The prince exclaimed in surprise, “If that is so, you may have been able to come, but you cannot leave! What is to be done?” The Great Lad asked for the reason, and the prince said, “The one you just pursued is the Dragon Palace’s rhinoceros-ox. Its horn parts the waters, which is why you were able to follow it here. But now it is over! Beyond this gate, you cannot take even a single step—how could you ever hope to return to the human world?” The Great Lad, in dire straits, bowed deeply and begged for help. The prince said, “I shall plead with my father on your behalf, to repay your great virtue.” With that, he departed.

A moment later, the prince returned, holding a pearl, which he presented, saying, “This is the Water-Repelling Pearl, the Dragon Palace’s most precious treasure. Carry it as you leave the sea, and you shall tread as though on level ground. Yet you must guard it well—let no other take it from you.” With earnest words, he saw him off.

No sooner had the Great Lad stepped beyond the palace gate than he found himself amid boundless mist and waves, with nowhere to set foot. He raised the pearl in his hand and waved it toward the water. Suddenly, amid the surging vastness, a smooth path appeared. Following it, he reached the shore in an instant, his clothes and shoes untouched by moisture. All who witnessed this marveled.

The Great Lad, however, could not restrain himself. He constantly flaunted his ability before others, clutching the pearl as he moved through towering waves and raging currents. The crowd plotted to seize it. One day, six or seven cowherds, spying the Great Lad in a light slumber, rose together and ransacked his belongings. Fearing he would lose the pearl and have nothing to show the Dragon King and his son, he tucked it into his mouth and leapt up to fight. The assailants, startled, scattered in all directions.

The pearl, too, slipped into his throat—he could neither spit it out nor swallow it down, and so he died. After his death, his body was placed in a coffin and left upon the seashore. One night, wind and rain shook the earth, and when dawn came, the place where the coffin had rested had become a great burial mound. The next year, the sea overflowed its bounds, and before the Great Lad’s tomb, a sandbank rose up. Wherever the sea’s waters passed, the land crumbled away, yet the Great Lad’s tomb stood alone, towering and unshaken. The people of the coast took him for a deity and built a temple to worship him. The Great Lad, too, repeatedly displayed miraculous powers.

Earlier, the Liu River had suffered many maritime disasters, deterring merchants from traveling there. After the Great Lad’s death, the residents of Liu River dreamed one night of a divine figure, resplendent in majesty and attended by an imposing retinue, who called out to them and said: *“I am Shi Dalang of Chongming! I have heard that the Liu River is to be swallowed by the sea, and my heart aches for you. Go swiftly and move my coffin to the river’s mouth—bury me there, and you may escape your calamity.”* Hundreds dreamed the same dream that night. Astonished, they hurried to inquire among the people of Chongming and indeed found the tomb of Shi Dalang. When they sought to relocate his coffin, the people of Chongming refused. So they petitioned at the Great Lad’s temple, requesting his processional statue be brought back and buried there. A grand burial mound in the shape of a horse’s mane was raised, and the tomb itself became a temple. No sooner had the work been completed than the sea surged forth—yet its waters halted at the edge of the grave. From then on, the Liu River was spared from maritime disasters. In recent years, its population has flourished, and it has nearly returned to its former prosperity.

The temple of Shi Dalang by the Liu River is no less spiritually potent than the one in Chongming. Each spring and autumn, grand festivals are held in his honor, with magnificent processions. The Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarks: *“Shi Dalang was but a peasant’s son. A single thought of compassion spared him the perils of the waves in life and won him the honor of worship in death. Why, then, should one hesitate or doubt? Why not hasten to do good?”*

A Tale of Forty-One: The Wind Whips the Hemp Skirt—A Snowfall of Grievance

When Prefectural Inspector Liang was serving as magistrate of Funing, he once had business in the prefectural seat. Setting out early, he had already entered Shanyang’s borders when he saw, beside his sedan, a young woman in white mourning robes and a hemp skirt, clutching paper ingots and walking alone with slow, halting steps—clearly one newly bereaved. Suddenly, a whirlwind caught her skirt, revealing beneath it red undergarments, which struck him as most unusual. He ordered his retinue to slow their pace and follow her. Whether she drew near or fell back, the hemp skirt still concealed white beneath; but whenever she strayed too far, a whirlwind would rise and twist her skirt, turning the hidden layer red—now deep, now pale, never the same hue.

After following for about a *li*, they came to a fresh grave. The woman swept the ground, burned the paper ingots, and wept without sorrow. Suddenly, a whirlwind scattered her paper money, some of which fell before the magistrate’s sedan. From afar, he saw her face grow dejected; she knelt and kowtowed repeatedly, praying without end. Sensing something amiss, Liang summoned an attendant to follow her, secretly inquiring after her name, her village, the identity of the deceased, the date of his death, and the illness that claimed him.

The attendant returned with the facts: the dead man was the woman’s husband, who had died suddenly without prior illness. He was hastily encoffined and buried with unseemly haste. Though the woman bore a tarnished reputation, her family was not impoverished. Once Liang had ascertained the truth, he presented himself to the prefect after his audience and recounted all he had witnessed to the magistrate of Shanyang. The magistrate dismissed his concerns with a laugh, paying them no heed.

Incensed, Liang took the matter to the prefect, who only smiled and said, *“Enough, sir! This is Shanyang’s affair—why trouble yourself to overstep your bounds?”*

Still seething with indignation, Liang sought an audience with Sun Jipu, the *jiexiang* at Yuanpu—*jiexiang* being the title for a grand minister sent out as governor-general. He laid out all he had witnessed and declared, *“I draw salary and rank from the court yet stand by while injustice festers, unable to redress it. How can I face the living and the dead? What use is this office to me?”* The *jiexiang*, impressed by his fervor, asked, *“Since you wish to pursue this case, how do you propose to proceed?”* Liang replied, *“Let me issue a summons to the magistrate of Shanyang to join me in exhuming the body. If no wounds are found, I will resign my post. Grant me one month, and I will uncover the cause of death. If I fail, I will accept the penalty for false accusation.”* The *jiexiang* consented.

When the coffin was opened, the corpse had not yet decayed, and not a hair on its body was harmed. The crowd erupted in uproar, all decrying Liang as a meddlesome official slandering the innocent. The magistrate of Shanyang even incited the young widow to block Liang’s carriage and prevent his return. Liang thundered at them, *“As an officer of the law, I have grounds to investigate. If my inquiry is flawed, leaving the living aggrieved and the dead exposed, the law of the land will hold me accountable—not the likes of you.”* With unyielding dignity, he mounted his carriage and departed, none daring to obstruct him.

Upon returning, Liang immediately took up his official seal and journeyed to Yuanpu to surrender it and submit to disciplinary action. The *jiexiang*, who had long respected him, said, *“I warned you not to act rashly. Now that no wounds have been found, what can be done?”* Liang replied, *“I willingly accept punishment. But if you would show me mercy, grant me one more month as I previously requested. I will surely uncover the truth through investigation. My only fear is that, in haste, we may need to apprehend and interrogate the culprit, yet local civil and military officials, rigidly guarding their jurisdictions, might allow the murderer to flee. That is my gravest concern.”* The *jiexiang* said, *“If that is so, take my arrow of command. If you fail within a month, I will not shield you.”* Liang bowed deeply, took the arrow, and departed. Disguising himself and altering his attire, he set out to investigate in all directions. Twenty days passed with no leads.

One day, posing as a cloth merchant, he traveled through the borderlands between mountains and hills—the frontier of Shanyang and Funing. As dusk fell, he had nowhere to go.

..., seeking a place to lodge for the night. After winding along for a little over a *li*, he came to a village of fewer than ten households, all with their doors already shut. Only a few paces beyond the village stood several thatched huts, where lamplight still glimmered. He hastened toward them. The wicker gate was half-closed; he pushed it open and entered directly. An old woman, sewing by the lamp, looked up in alarm and asked, “What brings you here, traveler?” Liang explained his need for shelter, adding, “With night fallen and no other recourse, I beg but a few feet of ground to shield me from wind and dew. I will not quibble over the price of the room.” The old woman replied, “Lodging you is no trouble, but my son is ill-tempered. I fear he may take offense when he returns.” She led him to a room and said, “Rest here for now. If you hear him come back, pray keep silent to avoid a quarrel.” Liang nodded in assent.

He sat on the straw mat, feigning sleep while awaiting dawn. At the fourth watch, a knock sounded at the door—it was the son returning. He heard the old woman scold him: “With the year’s harvest bountiful, you might yet live decently, yet you persist in this! You’ll bring ruin upon your old mother yet!” The son made no reply. Soon came the sound of him fetching firewood and rummaging in the kitchen for food. His mother told him, “There’s a traveler lodging in the thatched hut. You’d best treat him well.” The son took a torch inside, scrutinized Liang, and gave a faint smirk: “Mother knows so little of the world. Luckily, this is a good man—otherwise, it could have been dangerous.” Then he called Liang to rise. Seeing no malice in his manner, Liang stood and exchanged bows. They inquired after each other’s names and origins. Learning Liang had not yet eaten, the son hastily led him to the guest seat, brought out liquor and meat, and drank with him face to face, his speech bold and unrestrained. Liang asked how he made his living, but the son only smiled and said nothing. Liang pressed further: “What do you make of Magistrate Liang’s governance here?” The son replied, “He is upright and cares for the people—but he is in peril now.” Liang feigned ignorance: “How so?” The son smiled: “Because of the case in Shanyang, where a woman surnamed Mou plotted to kill her husband. Magistrate Liang is truly discerning—he saw the injustice in the case. Yet without consulting me, he would never have uncovered the truth.”

Hearing his words carried weight, Liang feigned provocation: “The roads hum with talk—all say this case has Magistrate Liang fond of stirring trouble and framing the innocent. Now you speak as you do—does that mean there truly is an injustice?” The son only smiled and gave no answer; Liang likewise let the matter drop. They drank deeply and talked at length, finding much accord. Liang proposed they swear brotherhood in the bond of gold and orchid. The son did not refuse. They burned incense and exchanged bows, and together paid their respects to his mother. The next day, Liang prepared to depart, but the son insisted he stay. By evening, Liang pressed him again about the case. The son still would not answer. Enraged, Liang said: “Now that we have sworn as brothers, we ought to bare our hearts to one another—how can you still conceal things? Or do you still take me for an outsider? Then let us part here.” He rose in anger, ready to leave. The son smiled and said: “I do not dare conceal anything—what is at stake is too great, so I dared not speak lightly! Now I shall lay it bare for you, but you must not speak of it to outsiders.” He rose, barred the door, and led Liang back inside. Smiling, he said: “Tell me, brother—what manner of man do you take me for?” Liang smiled in return: “A bold knight of the rivers and lakes.” “Just so. When there are those in town or countryside who act without righteousness, I go by night to take from them. I use it to sustain myself and also to aid the poor. I have done this for years, and by good fortune have not yet been exposed. Last month, I heard that in a certain village in Shanyang, a certain household was hiding a guest’s wealth of a thousand taels. I went to take it, but by mistake entered the home of the dead man and perched in a tree in the courtyard. There I saw a man and woman drinking together, their manner intimate and wanton. When they had drunk to mild intoxication, suddenly there came a knock at the door. The woman quickly put away the drinking vessels, hid the man in the narrow passage outside the room, and only then opened the door. Another man entered, his steps unsteady. He went straight into the room and collapsed onto the bed. The woman called to him but received no answer; she shook him, but he did not stir. She helped him up, but he fell again. Then she went out and called in the man with whom she had been drinking. He produced an iron nail and drove it into the first man’s skull through his hair. The man rolled on the ground for some time before lying still. The other man rose, opened the door, and left. The woman then cried out, summoning the neighbors to see. All took it for sudden death by poisoning, and none examined the hairline. Yesterday, when the body was opened for inspection, I was present. I saw the man with whom she had been drinking give a large packet of silver to the coroner of Shanyang. Though the hairline was examined, no wound was reported. That night, when I returned home, I did not breathe a word of it even to my mother. Yet I feel this matter will eventually come to light. My mistaken entry into that house was surely Heaven’s intent, that I might serve as witness.” Liang said: “Indeed.” Then he smiled and asked: “And what manner of man do you take *me* for?”

“He replied: ‘A cloth merchant exchanging silk.’” (The phrase "exchanging cloth for silk" refers to a traveling merchant, these four characters originating from the *Book of Songs*, “Wei Feng.”)

“No,” Liang said, “it is none other than Liang of Funing.”

Hearing this, the man’s face turned ashen. He knelt and kowtowed, begging for death. Liang laughed and stopped him: “Do not be so. Our sworn brotherhood is already settled—how could it be altered? Moreover, you are not the culprit in this case. I am about to embark on a journey of ten thousand *li*. You are my benefactor, and I shall surely repay your great kindness. I merely summoned you to testify during the inquiry, nothing more.” That evening, Liang again lodged at his home, conversing and laughing as before.

The next day, Liang proceeded to Yuanpu, where he called upon the provincial governor and recounted the entire affair. The governor then issued an order to the magistrates of Shanyang, Qinghe, and Funing, commanding the coroners of the three counties to conduct a joint examination. Indeed, a large nail was found embedded in the hairline. The adulteress was brought forward, but she refused to confess. The man was summoned to the tribunal and made to recount the details of that night’s murder—every word as vivid as if painted. Thereupon, she bowed her head and admitted her guilt, also supplying the name of her paramour. When the man was seized and brought in, he made no further denials, his confession matching the woman’s in every detail. Both were sentenced according to the law.

The governor held Liang in even higher esteem and recommended him to the imperial court. Within a few years, Liang was appointed prefect of Huaiyang. He had the man’s mother and son brought to his yamen, where he provided for their care, purchasing fields and establishing a household for them. To the end of their days, he treated them with the same respect as his own elder and younger brothers.

**42. Discarding Rice into the Privy**

A vile custom spreads the name of cursed rice;
When thunder roars in autumn’s ninth month’s skies,
The bystander’s remark reveals true hidden grace.

The five grains must never lightly be disdained.
In Pudong (a place name in Songjiang Prefecture, under Shanghai County), there exists a pernicious custom: whenever a person is falsely accused and cannot clear their name, they take a handful of rice, raise it to heaven, and swear, “If I truly committed this deed of which I stand accused, may heaven’s thunder strike me dead. If another has falsely slandered me, may heaven’s thunder strike them instead.” After uttering this oath, they cast the rice into the privy (a euphemism for a cesspit).

No custom is more vile than this. In the ninth month of the *renzi* year of Xianfeng’s reign, when thunder had already ceased for the season, an apprentice in a Beijing goods shop was reprimanded by his master for a missing item. The apprentice protested his innocence. By afternoon, dark clouds gathered on all sides, and thunder rumbled ominously, circling the rooftop without striking. Outside, goods were left to dry, and the master, fearing they would be drenched by sudden rain, ordered the apprentice to retrieve them, forcing him to go. No sooner had he stepped outside than the thunder followed, swirling above his head as if awaiting something.

The apprentice’s mind had already grown dazed. Someone who knew he had been scolded by the shopkeeper over the missing item said, “Young fool—did you not fall into the vile custom of cursing with rice?” Upon inquiry, it proved true. “Hurry,” they urged, “go retrieve the rice, rinse it clean with water, and cook it to eat. There may yet be time to save yourself.”

By then, the thunder roared even more fiercely, and violet lightning coiled around the apprentice’s body. The crowd kowtowed on his behalf, pleading for mercy, and the thunder and lightning eased slightly. The apprentice crawled with the others to the privy. Fortunately, the rice had just been cast in and had not yet been disturbed by filth—only about a *ge* remained, still clumped together. They ordered the privy-cleaner to devise a way to retrieve it, and the apprentice himself picked out each grain, rinsed them clean with water, and cooked them as instructed. Even as they scooped the rice from the privy, the thunder god’s voice still lingered at his side. Only when he finished eating did the thunder fall silent, the clouds disperse, and the moon shine as bright as day.

**43. Careless Burial of Bones**
The ancient way of gathering bones for burial was earnest,
Yet subtle distinctions within prove hard to discern.
Let Magistrate Zhou’s case serve as warning—
Dry bones, though senseless, repaid kindness on their own.

In Nanhui, it was customary to leave coffins unburied. Some were covered with straw, others walled with bricks, left along the inner and outer city walls or scattered across the fields. After many years, as descendants grew ever poorer, the coffins rotted and split, exposing the remains.

In the *yimao* year of Xianfeng (1855), my father served as *er yin* of this county. One day, strolling through the outskirts, he saw the exposed remains and was moved with sorrow. He consulted with *Xuebo* Bao Shanfu, and together they donated their salaries to bury them. At that time, I had just returned home on leave from the military camp, and my father instructed me and *Mingjing* Li Yinxiang to personally lead laborers in gathering and interring the bones. Yinxiang then told me: "The difficulty of collecting bones lies in the slightest carelessness inviting disaster. During the Qianlong era, Magistrate Zhou, upon assuming office here, was grieved by the sight of exposed remains. He donated his salary to purchase land and had the bones gathered for separate burial. However, the overseer proved incompetent, allowing the laborers to collect them haphazardly—failing to distinguish between male and female, mixing remains indiscriminately, scattering fragments, and even placing this shin with that elbow in the same urn, or combining a woman’s foot with a man’s skull in a single coffin."

Moreover, there were coffins still sturdy and intact, or only partially decayed, which could have been repaired. Yet those tasked with burial would forcibly split them open, rifling through their contents. What began as a virtuous act of "burying *zhi* and covering *ge*"—where *ge* denotes dry bones and *zhi* putrid flesh—nearly became a tyranny of "tomb-raiding and grave-plundering." (As Chen Lin’s *Proclamation to Yuzhou* for Yuan Shao decried: Cao Cao appointed a *Colonel of Grave-Plundering* and a *Captain of Tomb-Raiding*, leaving no remains unexposed in their wake.)

Upon completion of the work, the overseer fell ill. In his sickness, he saw countless men and women—some missing an arm, others limping on one foot; some men with dainty, bound feet, others women of imposing, masculine stature. Still more bore gaping holes in their backs or chests, cleft lips, or shrunken eyes—no telling how many there were.

The wraiths encircled his bed, hurling abuse—so vexed was the sick man by their clamor that he shut his eyes, only for them to pinch his ears and pluck his brows, tormenting him beyond endurance. Every prayer and supplication proved futile. Soon after, the magistrate himself fell ill, and in his sickness, he too heard the cries of grievance. The clamor of voices was too frantic to discern clearly, but the gist was this: bones had been jumbled, remains wantonly scattered, coffins pried open without cause. They had petitioned the gods, they said, and now demanded the magistrate descend to the netherworld to set things right. In the end, he and the overseer perished in quick succession. Of all who took part in this labor, not one survived the span of a few years.

Master of Sitting Among Flowers remarked: "To do good carelessly is to invite retribution from the unseen realm. One might think this enough to dissuade men from the very thought of virtue—but those who harbor the *intention* of doing good yet act with reckless haste, without sincerity or diligence, bring greater harm than those who do nothing at all. Worse still is to bask in the hollow reputation of virtue while inflicting real ruin upon others. If the dead possess any awareness, how could they not ache with sorrow?"

Case Forty-Four: The Magistrate of Chengde – How Could a National Celebration Outweigh Unrepaid Famine?
To Open the Granary Was a Crime He Would Bear Alone
Yet the People’s Straightforward Dao Still Endured as in the Three Dynasties
Their Love and Veneration No Less Than That for the Mulberry of Duke Shao

The late Mr. Shi, father of Shi Daosheng—Surveillance Commissioner of Heng-Yong Circuit in Hunan—had served as a *xiangkui* magistrate of Chengde County in Fengtian. (The second to fifth place in the provincial examination were called *xiangkui*.) A drought had struck the county: no wheat in summer, no grain in autumn. Famine and displacement followed—nine out of ten households suffered. (Famine: pronounced *jin*. The *Analects* commentary states: “When grain does not ripen, it is called *ji*; when vegetables do not ripen, it is called *jin*.” Here, “famine and displacement” means displacement caused by famine.)

That year, the nation celebrated a grand occasion (referring to major imperial weddings or the emperor’s birthday). The chief minister (pronounced *fang*, interchangeable with *bing*; here, referring to the grand councilor) did not wish to trouble the emperor’s sagely consideration with a localized disaster. The officials of the auxiliary capital all complied with his intent. Mr. Shi repeatedly petitioned for relief, but his requests were rejected three times. They even cited the case of fraudulent relief in Gansu as a dire warning to intimidate him. (Intimidate: pronounced *chu*, meaning to frighten.)

Enraged, Mr. Shi opened the Ever-Normal Granary in full to feed the starving. When others tried to stop him, he laughed and said, “If I am charged with unauthorized distribution of granary grain, the worst I face is confiscation, imprisonment, and repayment upon term’s end—my punishment would be mine alone. As the magistrate of this county, how could I hesitate to trade my life for the salvation of ten thousand people?” After the distribution, he submitted a memorial confessing his offense.

His superiors were furious and swiftly impeached him. (Impeachment: as previously annotated in the chapter on Madame Yan.) In the end, he was charged with embezzlement and sentenced to execution. (Embezzlement: pronounced *shi*, meaning deficit. Execution: as previously annotated in the chapter on Jealousy and Treachery.) He fell ill and died in prison. (Illness: pronounced *yu*. The phrase is from the *Book of Han: Annals of Emperor Xuan*.)

At the time, the magistrate’s wife had already passed away, and his son—the future provincial inspector—was still young. None among his colleagues inquired after them. Adrift, they wandered to Liaoshen, then drifted into the capital. At fifteen or sixteen, the boy worked as a hired laborer in a tavern to support himself. One day, several patrons were drinking at the tavern when the young man overheard their accents and recognized them as men from Chengde. He mimicked their speech to engage them in conversation. The patrons exclaimed in surprise, “Are you not our neighbor?” He replied, “No, my family is from south of the Yangtze, but I grew up in your homeland, so I can imitate your way of speaking.” “Then what is your surname?” they asked. “My surname is Shi,” he answered. The men all rose to their feet and said, “There was once an official who served as father and mother to our county—how do you address him?” The young man’s tears welled up, and he choked with sobs, unable to speak.

The patrons ceased their questions and said, “After the second watch tonight, when the tavern closes, come find me at such-and-such an alleyway—do not fail to keep the appointment.” The young man agreed. When evening came, he made an excuse and went. He had not taken more than a few steps from the tavern door when a man in formal attire awaited him on the road and asked, “Are you Master Shi of Chengde?” “Yes,” he replied. The man then helped him into a carriage. Upon reaching the alleyway, those awaiting his arrival lined the road without end. As they entered the gate, every door stood wide open, and the lanterns blazed with dazzling brilliance. No sooner had he alighted from the carriage than over a dozen men in formal attire supported him as he ascended the hall, clustering around him as he took the seat of honor. They prostrated themselves in rows and addressed him, saying, “We have sought you for years! That you should have drifted into such straits—this is all our fault.”

"Fortunately, the spirit of your late father guided us to seek you in the capital, and now we have truly met—could this be anything but Heaven’s will?" At that moment, the young magistrate was still a child when his father had passed, and he had been seven or eight years old at the time. Having drifted in destitution for so long, he was suddenly honored and revered by these men of rank, so unexpected that his eyes widened in stunned silence, unable to utter a single word.

The guests then explained to him: "Your father distributed grain to relieve famine, willingly bearing the weight of capital punishment to save tens of thousands of lives. We are all among those disaster-stricken people who once ate that grain. Year after year, as the harvests ripened, we longed to repay his great virtue. We learned that your father had perished in prison and heard that you, his son, had wandered through Liaodong and Shenyang. We dispatched dozens of men to search everywhere, but no trace could be found. Yesterday, the abbot of the local temple dreamed that your father had arrived to take office and revealed your whereabouts to him. Thus, we were able to come to the capital to seek you."

Thereupon, they bathed him, dressed him in new robes, and prepared the main bedchamber to lodge him. The next day, they set out wine and music, taking turns to offer toasts in celebration.

A certain official, the Dao Overseer, also arrived that day. Addressing the assembly, he said: "My entire family of eight had no steady livelihood. When sudden famine struck, none but your late father could have saved us. In the year my own father passed away, he took my hand and said: ‘Magistrate Shi brought this extraordinary calamity upon himself to rescue the people, scattering his family like stars. You are fortunate to have earned an official rank—if you fail to repay his kindness, you are no son of mine.’ I have borne this charge for years now, and it weighs upon me day and night, yet I have found no means to fulfill it."

This day, fortunately, we behold the young master’s noble bearing and striking appearance, and know he is destined for prominence and renown, to carry forward his late father’s unfinished aspirations. I beseech you all to entrust him to my care. In the future, when the young master achieves his meritorious fame, I alone shall take responsibility for it.” Thereupon, the assembly entrusted him to the care of Chengde.

Previously, after the master’s passing, his family had hastily prepared his burial, abandoning the coffin in a neglected shrine. Now, the people of Chengde selected a proper site for his interment and also established a dedicated shrine in his honor, endowing it with lands for sacrificial offerings. On the very day the Prefect arrived for inspection, the shrine’s construction was completed, and all marveled at the coincidence. They then settled the young master within the shrine, where his clothing, food, and daily needs were overseen by an elder, all provided from the communal funds—always abundant, always generous. Furthermore, they engaged a renowned tutor to instruct him. Yet the Prefect, having endured hardship from a young age, began his studies late; though he labored diligently, his progress was slow. After several years of reading, while he gained a rough understanding of literary meaning, he remained utterly lost in the art of examination essays.

The Daoist master, having heard of this, summoned him to the capital and arranged for him to serve in the Bureau of Strategy and Tactics. He also brokered a marriage for him with a family of noble lineage and promoted his reputation among the high officials. Ultimately, through the Daoist master’s influence, the young man obtained an official post and soon thereafter joined the military campaign in the southern lands of Chu. There, he roused himself to diligence and discipline. Within a few years, he rose to the rank of Prefect and was later recommended for promotion to the position of Provincial Inspector.

Upon petitioning to retire, he was heard to have become a man of Chengde. The Master of the Flower-Adorned Seat remarked: “In governing the people, he spared no effort in saving the multitudes—truly, he did not betray the trust of being a parent to the people! Yet while he rescued those beneath the meanest eaves, the prison’s inmates alone met their doom. His spirit-chariot was forever abandoned in the overgrown shrine, and his young children were reduced to menial drudgery.”

Long in such straitened plight—how could those who do good not tremble with fear? Yet in death he became Yama, King of the Underworld, and in life he left behind a legacy of love. The people of that city, having buried Zhu Yi in Tongxiang, then sought the young master in the capital and Luoyang, moved by dreams that bridged waking and sleep, and bore word of him home. Raised from the muck and mire, he was set upon the heights of azure clouds; his clothing and food were made abundant, his household made whole. They nourished him with poetry and books, guided him with teachers and guardians, spurred him toward merit and renown—until at last he spread his wings in the open sky, lashed his steed upon the royal road, and the scion of a house once noble regained his former station. The favor bestowed was deep indeed, and the recompense was full. Though the love of the sweet pear-tree alone might have stirred their innate devotion, their reverence for virtue and praise of benevolence endured long, ever seeking repayment through his son before they could rest content. In this land, the customs of loyalty and righteousness—might they yet uphold the ways of old?

A certain scholar from Wanjiang—Wanjiang being Anhui—was traveling to Jinling for the examinations. Delayed by contrary winds, he moored his boat along the riverbank and went ashore for a stroll. Wandering into a village, he saw several people conferring on the road, sighing and lamenting as though at a loss for any recourse. Faint weeping reached his ears. After walking a few paces more, the sobs grew nearer, their tone steeped in grief and resentment. He then encountered another group wringing their hands and stamping their feet, their distress no different from the first. Only one among them, standing to the left, remarked, “If only some great-hearted soul would generously provide the cost of a coffin, today’s affair might yet be resolved for both sides.” The others replied, “That is precisely the difficulty—how easily you speak of it!”

The scholar stepped forward, cupped his hands in inquiry, and asked, “Why do you grieve so deeply? May a passing traveler hear the cause?” The group turned to the man on the left, saying, “Surely this is the very man of great compassion you spoke of! Why not tell him?” The man replied, “How can we be certain?” He then explained the matter in full:

“This village is home to a single extended clan. A cousin of mine has died, leaving behind a widow who has steadfastly maintained her chastity. Their son is but a few years old. The widow serves her parents-in-law with filial devotion, spinning and weaving to provide for their needs. A month ago, her father-in-law fell ill, and in seeking physicians and purchasing medicines, she exhausted every resource. Yesterday, he passed away. With no means to obtain a coffin, the family is now forced to consider selling the widow to pay for his burial. She grieves that she cannot remain chaste to the end, yet she mourns the thought of leaving her parents-in-law, who cling to her in their dependence, and she cannot bear to part with her child. From yesterday until now, her sorrow has caused her to faint several times. As for the rest of us, years of famine and drought have left us penniless. We lament that such a woman of loyalty and filial piety should be lost to us, and so we sigh in despair.”

The scholar, moved, asked, “How much silver is needed to secure a coffin?” The group replied, “Thirty taels would suffice.” The scholar then invited them aboard his boat, produced his silver, and said, “I carry forty taels for this journey. I shall give you thirty and keep ten, which will be enough to see me through the examinations.” The villagers were deeply touched; some wept, exclaiming, “Truly, this is a man of great compassion!”

Just then, the wind shifted favorably, and the boatman hoisted the sail, eager to depart. The scholar hurriedly ushered the villagers ashore. In their haste, neither side had time to inquire after names, and they parted with cupped hands and words of gratitude.

Upon reaching Jinling, the scholar found himself short of funds. He borrowed from a fellow townsman trading in the city, thus avoiding destitution. When the examinations began, he entered his assigned cell to find an old man already seated there, motionless. Surprised, he asked where the man had come from, and the old man replied, “I am your cellmate.” The scholar was perplexed, for the cell seemed spacious enough for both to share a cot without crowding. They exchanged names and hometowns, discussed the examinations, and conversed on literature and scholarship, finding mutual delight in their exchange.

As they prepared for sleep, the old man said, “Rest well; do not concern yourself with me.” At the fourth watch, the examination topics were distributed, and the scholar saw the old man seize his brush and write with swift precision. Attempting to rise, the scholar felt as though pressed down by a nightmare and fell back into a stupor. When he awoke the next day at noon, the old man had vanished. Examining his own examination paper, he found it already filled with draft writing. Astonished, he unfurled it to read—only to discover prose of grand depth and poetry of refined elegance, all four compositions complete, truly the work of a top-ranked candidate.

Marveling, he asked the cell attendant, “Where has the old man who shared my cell gone?” The attendant replied absently, “He has left.” The scholar did not press further. Though he and the old man had been strangers, how had the latter composed such masterful work for him? He read and reread the text, praising it without end. Taking up his brush to compose his own thoughts, he could not produce a single original word and so copied the draft in full.

When he entered the examination cell for the second session, the old man was already there, greeting him with a smile: “It seems we share a karmic bond from a past life, for we meet again in the same cell.” The scholar expressed his gratitude for the first session’s assistance, reproaching the old man for leaving without a word. “Why did you vanish without a trace?” he asked. The old man laughed and said, “In a former existence, I owed you several compositions—this was known to the spirits. Why thank me? Tonight, simply rest well and ask no further questions.” The scholar followed his advice.

The next morning, the old man had vanished once more, yet all five classical texts were complete. The same occurred in the third session. After the examinations, the scholar sought the old man’s lodgings, but no one knew of him. Fearing the strangeness of the matter, he dared not speak of it to others.

Upon returning home, as he prepared to cast off from the dock, a man suddenly rushed toward him from the shore, begging to board the boat. It was the old man from his examination cell. Clapping his hands, he exclaimed, “Truly, we share a karmic bond—we meet again!” Overjoyed, the scholar hurriedly welcomed him aboard and asked about his belongings. The old man replied, “I am alone, with nothing to my name.” When asked where he lived, he said, “You will know soon enough.”

As they reached the previous mooring, the old man pointed to a village on the shore: “That is my home. Please, do not scorn my humble dwelling—will you not visit?” With that, he hastened ashore. The scholar followed quickly, but as he entered the village, the old man moved swiftly, vanishing from sight. Hesitating in confusion, he encountered the man who had earlier sought donations for a coffin. The man bowed by the roadside and said, “Sir, have you returned?” The scholar urgently asked for the old man’s name and lineage. The man gasped in shock: “He was my clansman’s uncle, who passed away over a month ago—the very man you once generously funded for burial.” The scholar exclaimed in astonishment, “What do you mean? This gentleman shared my examination cell for all three sessions!”

"After the examination, he again shared my boat on the return journey, seeing me ashore and watching as I entered the village. Now this—could I have encountered a ghost?" The man grew even more alarmed: "Then it must truly have been my uncle’s spirit! My uncle was indeed a *su ru*—a scholar of profound learning—renowned for his vast knowledge and literary skill. Yet he languished for years in the examination halls, dying with his aspirations unfulfilled. In early autumn, my aunt once dreamed of my uncle coming to bid her farewell, saying, ‘I am bound for Jinling to repay the kindness of the coffin and burial. Through his literary blessings, I shall at last reveal that my decades of failure in the examinations were not for lack of merit—*it was not the fault of the battle.*’"

"'Now, sir, what you have encountered aligns precisely with the dream—how extraordinary! My uncle’s wife and daughter-in-law were deeply moved by your kindness to the bone. They repeatedly urged me to wait respectfully by the riverbank, hoping to have the good fortune of inviting you for a visit. Since this strange coincidence has occurred, would you accompany me to their home to settle the matter?'

The scholar thus went with him. Upon arrival, they found a thatched hut with a wattle gate, its walls bare and desolate. Before the hall hung plain white curtains and white candles, with a portrait suspended high. The man who had commissioned the coffin pointed to the scholar and said, 'This is the spirit of my uncle.' Drawing nearer, the scholar saw it was indeed the elderly candidate from the examination hall.

He then recounted in detail their encounter in the hall and how he had drafted the examination essay on his behalf. The man went inside to report, and his uncle’s wife, daughter-in-law, and orphaned son all came out to kneel in gratitude. The scholar, moved, modestly declined, saying, 'I am deeply indebted to your late husband’s noble virtue. My small act has been repaid a hundredfold—my gratitude will never fade. If I should pass the examination, I shall share my wealth and rank with you all, for I dare not betray such great kindness.'

With that, he bowed before the spirit tablet to express his thanks and took his leave."

The announcement of the examination results came, and indeed, he achieved high honors. The following year, he passed the metropolitan examination and was appointed magistrate of Wu. He continued to provide for the family of the elderly scholar, summoning his son to the yamen and engaging a renowned tutor to instruct him. Later, the son succeeded in his studies and entered the Hanlin Academy.

The Master of the Flowery Seat remarked: *"Goodness born of utmost sincerity is true goodness. When this scholar divided his gold to purchase the coffin, did he harbor even the slightest thought of seeking fame or expecting repayment? His grief in weeping was enough to deepen his emotion; the filial piety and integrity of the deceased were enough to command his respect. Thus, from genuine compassion, great mercy arose—truly, he was a man of perfect sincerity! In the Nine Springs, gratitude transcended the barrier of the unseen realm; by composing the examination essay on his behalf, he secured success in the spring and autumn examinations. A small act met with abundant reward—why should men hesitate to do good?"*

**Parallel Prose (Four-Six Style), Cold Armor:**
*A chance lodging held a fate unseen,*
*Yet greed for gain led to fields and gardens bought.*
*Who knew a wolf’s heart would meet a tiger’s lung?*
*By New Bridge’s river, grievance was wrought.*

In the eastern countryside of Qu’e (Qu’e being Danyang County), there lived a man named Leng Jia, poor and of no virtue. One evening, a traveler sought lodging at his home and bestowed upon him generous gifts. After several days, the guest became intimate with Leng’s wife, coveting her wealth. Leng, aware of this, feigned ignorance and allowed it. Soon after, the guest departed, only to return half a month later. He produced gold, pearls, silks, and other treasures in great abundance, giving a portion to Leng to purchase fields and a house, while entrusting the remainder to his wife, instructing her to bury it in a pit. Thereafter, the guest came and went frequently, and Leng grew prosperous through this association. Over time, his comings and goings aroused suspicion, and Leng realized he was a bandit, though he bore no ill will toward him.

Later, the guest vanished for months. One day, a messenger arrived in haste, delivering a letter from the guest to Leng. It revealed that he had attempted to rob the household of a great gentry family in Wu, had been captured, and was now imprisoned in Wu County, his confession already recorded. Fortunately, he was not the ringleader, and with clever planning, he might yet escape death. He urgently begged Leng to bring silver to Suzhou and arrange matters on his behalf, his pleas filled with sorrow and desperation.

Upon receiving the letter, Leng secretly consulted his wife. Fearing that sparing the bandit’s life would bring lifelong trouble, they set out for Suzhou under cover of night. When Leng met the bandit, he deceived him, claiming he would devise a plan to secure his release and promising a full report. In secret, however, he bribed the authorities to solidify the bandit’s guilt, shifting him from an accomplice to the principal offender, and had him executed at once.

More than a year after the bandit’s death, Leng entered the city and walked along the New Bridge riverside with several companions. Suddenly, he cried out, *“There he comes!”* Then, *“He’s thrusting a fork at me!”* He shrieked, collapsed to the ground, and died.

**Postscript**

Perusing the accounts in this book, one sees how aid rendered in a moment of dire urgency may yield boundless retribution. Many admire such deeds yet lament the rarity of such opportunities. Yet the ways of doing good are innumerable—what one lacks is not the means but the heart.

The rewards of accumulated virtue follow as closely as a shadow clings to form. To benefit oneself, one must first benefit others. Nowhere are urgency and hardship more acute than in the ravages of fire and flood. Often, when the Fire God rages unchecked, the poor and humble are suddenly struck by calamity, their suffering so grievous that the eye cannot bear to witness it. Or when floodwaters surge to the heavens, homes are swept away, and the desperate wails of the doomed rise in chorus—left with no choice but to await death.

For those who wish to sow virtue, such moments present the finest of opportunities. One should investigate the households afflicted by disaster and, in secret, dispense silver to offer relief. A few coins may save a single life; a few dozen may preserve an entire family. The wealthy, of course, ought to give generously, but even those of modest means should strive to persuade others to contribute, joining together in the cause. How limitless, then, would their merit be!

To rescue lives below is to move the heart of Heaven above. The Dao of reward for virtue and retribution for vice never fails. The Five Blessings and Three Abundances may be attained without effort—why, then, regret the infrequency of such occasions?

Truly, extraordinary good deeds beget extraordinary merit. The Way of Heaven delights in reciprocity, a truth verified time and again throughout the ages. Thus, I append these few lines to the end of this work, earnestly exhorting the benevolent gentlemen of the world.
