**Preface to the *Collected Commentaries on the Ancient Text of the Cantong qi* in the *Siku Quanshu***

We, your ministers, respectfully note: The *Collected Commentaries on the Ancient Text of the Cantong qi* in three juan was compiled by Jiang Yibiao of the Ming dynasty. Yibiao styled himself Fuyangzi and was a native of Yuyao. Wei Boyang’s original *Cantong qi* comprised three pian, which Peng Xiao later divided into chapters and annotated. Though subsequent commentators repeatedly rearranged and subdivided the text, the sequence of the upper, middle, and lower pian remained unchanged until the Ming dynasty, when Yang Shen produced a separate edition. He claimed to have unearthed a stone casket in the south containing the *Ancient Text of the Cantong qi*—three pian of the main text, one pian of preface, three pian of Xu Jingxiu’s commentary, one pian of postscript, two pian of Chunyu Shutong’s *Three Phases Diagram*, and one pian of postscript—totaling eleven pian. He boasted of having seen what even Master Zhu Xi had not. Yibiao’s commentary is based entirely on Shen’s edition, hence the title *Ancient Text*. He disassembled the annotations of Peng Xiao, Chen Xianwei, Chen Zhixu, and Yu Yan, appending them piecemeal beneath each section, thus calling it a *Collected Commentary*. Upon examination, we find that his work frequently inverts the original text: a eulogy present in the original is reclassified as Jingxiu’s postscript, while a chapter originally titled *Shusai’s Omissions* is extracted and recast as Shutong’s postscript.

The *Cantong qi* has seldom been cited by other works. Apart from Yu Fan’s commentary on the *Book of Changes*, which quotes its line “the sun and moon are the *Changes*,” no other references are found. Historical records of its transmission are also scant. The only reliable source is Peng Xiao’s preface, which merely states that “Master Wei showed it to Xu, an Attendant in Qingzhou, whose given name was Yue, and he annotated it.” Zheng Qiao’s *Tongzhi: Bibliography* lists *Xu’s Attendant’s Commentary on the Yin-Yang Unification of the Cantong qi* in three juan but does not specify whether this Xu was Jingxiu. How, then, did Jingxiu’s name suddenly emerge after two thousand years? Zhu Xi once remarked that the eulogy in the text seemed to be a postscript to a commentary, though the commentary itself was no longer extant. This edition coincidentally aligns with Zhu’s observation—could it be that Shen fabricated his claims by misappropriating Zhu’s words? As for Chunyu Shutong, he was merely a transmitter of the text. An old saying among Daoists mentions “Xu’s Attendant and Chunyu Shutong each writing a preface.” Peng Xiao, citing Liu Zhigu’s *Discourse on the Origin of the Sun and Moon*, thoroughly refuted this error. Yet Shen again attributed the *Three Phases Diagram* to Shutong, using the very argument Peng had debunked to prove its antiquity—a baseless assertion.

The *Cantong qi* is a relic of the Han and Wei dynasties, though no direct evidence confirms this. From the Jin dynasty onward, Ge Hong’s *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* states that “Boyang wrote the *Cantong qi* and *Five Phases Diagram*, totaling three juan.” In the Tang dynasty, the *Old唐书: Bibliography* (based on the *Kaiyuan Catalog of Inner and Outer Classics*) lists *The Zhouyi Cantong qi* in two juan by Wei Boyang and *The Zhouyi Five Phases Diagram* in one juan by Wei Boyang. What era, then, does Shen’s so-called *Ancient Text* hail from? Yibiao’s edition further alters all references to “Master Wei” in earlier commentaries to “Master Xu” to conform to Shen’s claims, violating the principle of suspending judgment where doubt exists. Nevertheless, since Shen’s edition, this version has gained currency, and later commentators have often followed it, rendering it ineradicable. We now provisionally adopt its chapter divisions, subdividing it into sub-juan, and include it alongside Peng Xiao’s edition in the catalog. This is to expose the origins of its fabrication and distortion, lest future scholars be misled.

Respectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

**Original Preface**

The *Cantong qi* stands as the progenitor of all alchemical scriptures. Yet, upon examining the bibliographic records of the Sui and Tang dynasties, one finds no trace of its title. Only in the *Biographies of Divine Transcendents* is it recorded that Wei Boyang of Shangyu, a man well-versed in poetry, prosody, and literary arts, cultivated the Dao and nurtured his aspirations, distilling the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong qi*. Xu Jingxiu of the same prefecture provided annotations, and during the reign of Emperor Huan, it was transmitted to Chunyu Shutong, thereafter circulating in the world. By the Five Dynasties period, Peng Xiao, a Daoist of Yongkang in Shu, divided it into ninety chapters to correspond with the nine revolutions of the firing process, appending a poem on the tripod and cauldron to align with the attainment of the One in true lead. His interpretations, however, were forced and contrary to Master Wei’s original intent.

The text had long been scattered and disordered, leaving later readers unable to distinguish between the classic and its commentaries, or between the words of Wei, Xu, and Chunyu—this confusion began with Peng. Master Zhu Xi composed his *Examination of Discrepancies* and commentary based on Peng’s edition, while Yu Yuwu of the Yuan dynasty, in his own annotations, relied on Zhu’s version. Yuwu sought to separate the three-character, four-character, and five-character lines into distinct sections but did not complete the task. Though he recognized the sequence’s disorder and its deviation from Master Wei’s original text, he, like others, lacked a definitive basis.

I once read Zhang Pingshu’s *Wuzhen pian*, which states: “Shutong received instruction from Wei Boyang, leaving behind the *Cantong qi* as the eternal alchemical classic.” I surmised that Pingshu must have seen the ancient text, for after years of searching, he never obtained it. Recently, I met Yang Qionglai, Vice Censor of Hongya, who mentioned that in the southern regions, a stone casket unearthed from the earth contained an ancient version of the *Cantong qi* by Wei Boyang, comprising three main chapters, one preface, three chapters of Xu Jingxiu’s annotations, one postscript, three supplementary chapters on the Three Phases by Chunyu Shutong, two chapters of later postscripts, and one final postscript—eleven chapters in total. This version had not been tampered with by later hands.

Eagerly, I sought to transcribe it, but before I could, someone arrived from Wu with a printed edition, falsely claiming it was the fruit of arduous contemplation, a sudden enlightenment where tangled chapters and disordered passages dissolved like mist and ice. Such claims deceive both self and others, and upon examining its separate preface, I found it further asserted that someone from Guiji had presented a superior ancient text, instantly correcting all spurious versions. Yet within a leaf or half a slip, the deception was already evident—like covering one’s ears to steal a bell or hiding one’s head while exposing one’s feet. Truly lamentable!

Having rejoiced in the reemergence of the ancient text and witnessed what Master Zhu had never seen, I considered it a once-in-a-millennium delight. Thus, I composed a preface and preserved it. Alas! Ancient texts from the Eastern Han surviving to this day are exceedingly rare. This book, like a broken jade tablet restored or a flawed disk rejoined, is truly precious.

Yet, some interpret its metaphors and analogies as pertaining to bedroom arts or mistake them for furnace alchemy, leading to the ruin of lives, the squandering of fortunes, and the dissipation of families. Success is rare—one in ten thousand—while failure claims eight or nine out of ten. As Ban Gu observed, the pursuit of transcendence is meant to preserve the authenticity of life and seek nothing external. It should serve to calm the mind and align with the great transformation, freeing the heart from fear. However, those who fixate solely on such practices produce ever more bizarre and abstruse writings, deviating from the teachings of the sages. Beware!

These words are appended herewith.

Written on the tenth day after the Winter Solstice in the bingwu year of the Jiajing reign by Dongtian Zhenyi of Chengdu, Yang Shen.

---

In the dingyou year of the Jiajing reign, during my convalescence, I immersed myself in quietude and perused various esoteric texts, seeking resources for inner cultivation. Upon reading the *Cantong qi*, I found the annotated versions utterly incomprehensible and set them aside. Eighteen years have since passed, to this jiayin year, and my mind has often returned to the text. As the progenitor of alchemical scriptures, why is it so obscure and disordered, rendering it nearly unintelligible?

Yesterday, while sorting through the posthumous works of my late father, Master Yunlong, I chanced upon an ancient version of the *Cantong qi*—Wei Boyang’s original text in three chapters with one preface, Xu Jingxiu’s annotations in three chapters with one postscript, and Chunyu Shutong’s *Three Phases* supplement in two chapters with one final postscript, totaling eleven chapters. This version, devoid of commentary, had not been tampered with by later hands and was the very edition prefaced by Yang Shen of Sheng’an of Chengdu. Upon reading it, I realized that the versions I had encountered years prior had interspersed Wei’s preface and the annotations of Jingxiu and Shutong into the main text, creating profound confusion. Later commentators, unaware of the origins of these errors, perpetuated them, embellishing the text with forced interpretations, leading to further distortions. No wonder later readers, encountering repeated phrases and obscure meanings, accepted these corruptions wholesale, compounding the disorder.

Unbeknownst to them, the chaos originated with Peng Xiao. Now, I have corrected these falsifications, taking the ancient text as the standard. I extracted Wei’s original chapters and compiled excerpts from the commentaries of Peng Xiao, Chen Xianwei, Chen Zhixu, and Yu Yan beneath each section to elucidate their meanings. Yu’s commentary, in particular, was so fragmented and disordered that selecting coherent passages required considerable effort. Some passages, though seemingly disjointed, were likely misplaced due to the intermingling of Xu and Chunyu’s annotations and postscripts. Where continuity was lacking, I marked the breaks with a circle. Given the limitations of this edition, which includes only these four commentaries, I could not incorporate more.

Xu Jingxiu’s annotations and Chunyu Shutong’s *Three Phases* were transcribed from the ancient version, with the four commentaries appended below. Their respective postscripts were included as plain text, separate from the annotations. Divided into two juan, Wei’s *Cantong qi* forms the upper volume, while Xu and Chunyu’s annotations and *Three Phases* comprise the lower volume, completing this definitive edition. Thus, a millennium of errors are at once rectified, and we behold what Peng, Chen, and others never saw—a truly exhilarating achievement!

May future readers clearly discern Master Wei’s original intent and no longer confuse the classic with its commentaries.

As for the discovery of the ancient text, Yang Shen attributed it to a stone casket unearthed in the south. His preface provides ample detail, so I will not reiterate it here. However, upon close examination, much of the *Cantong qi*’s language and meaning resembles that of the *Longhu jing*, suggesting that Master Wei drew upon the latter to expound its principles rather than merely imitating it.

The *Book of Changes* stands as the earliest work on the Dragon and Tiger, while the *Cantong qi* models itself upon it. Xu and Chunyu, in turn, each modeled their own works upon it, expressing their individual insights. Since ancient times, scholars have delved into these texts only to conflate them into one, leading to grave errors.

I once encountered a perfected being who transmitted the elixir formula—so simple and concise that a mere one or two phrases sufficed, with no need for further elaboration. If this is so, then the composition of the *Cantong qi* might seem superfluous. Yet this is not the case. To guide later learners, the text employs myriad analogies and metaphors, veiling its discourse not to expose the truth directly but to lead readers to ponder and grasp its essence beyond the words themselves. For such a treasure, the teachings cannot but be conveyed in roundabout and guarded language. To distill it into a single phrase would be to reduce it to mere oral instruction. The Dao cannot be lightly divulged in its entirety; if it were, people would trivialize its words, growing careless and neglectful in their practice. Without unwavering resolve and singular focus, the great Dao would remain forever unattainable. This is why Master Wei borrowed the language of the *Changes* to expound the alchemical method in the *Cantong qi*.

Its lower chapter states: *"Exposing the branches while concealing the root, adopting various names to obscure the multitude of texts."* This is precisely the intent. Though I dare not claim this compilation as a definitive aid to Master Wei’s work, it may yet offer some assistance to Peng, Chen, and others. For the arduous efforts of exploration in those early years have not been in vain, culminating in this present achievement.

*Cantong qi* by Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han

**Upper Chapter** [This speaks of the three sages riding the dragon to ascend to heaven, the Dao of the *Great Changes*]

Heaven is firm, Earth is yielding; their union and embrace.
Yang endows, yin receives; male and female depend on each other to engender the essence of creation.
Qi unfurls, Kan and Li crown the head, their radiance spreading—
Mysterious and profound, beyond depiction.
The sage measures and weighs, aligning the primal foundations.
The four elements merge into chaos, entering the realm of emptiness.
The sixty-four hexagrams unfold like a chariot’s canopy,
The dragon [or: horse] harnessed, the enlightened ruler at the reins.
When harmony prevails, the path is smooth, free from deviation.
The perilous way is steep and treacherous, endangering the state.
The noble one dwells in his chamber; if his words are virtuous,
A thousand *li* away, they resonate—such is the lord of ten thousand chariots,
Abiding in the ninefold palace, issuing decrees in accord with yin and yang.
He stores his instruments, awaiting the season, never transgressing the hexagram’s time.
*Zhun* begins at *zi* and *shen*, employing *yin* and *xu*.
The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their appointed days.
I briefly present two images, though I cannot exhaust their depths.
Establish righteousness, enact punishments, bestow virtue where due.
To oppose them brings misfortune; to follow them brings fortune.
Enforce the laws with utmost sincerity, meticulous and precise.
Observe the celestial signs, scrutinize the waxing and waning—
Even the slightest deviation brings regret and harm.
At the solstices, the measures change; errors lead to disorder.
Twisting paths in midwinter’s scorching heat,
Frost and snow at midsummer’s peak,
Equinoxes out of alignment, timekeeping awry—
Drought and flood contend, wind and rain fail to harmonize.
Locusts surge forth, omens multiply,
Heaven displays its portents, mountains crumble, earth splits.
The filial son’s devotion moves the imperial pole,
Nearby, it emerges from his own mouth;
Far off, it flows to distant lands—
Now summoning calamity, now bringing fortune,
Now ushering in peace, now inciting war.
These four outcomes arise from within.

The heart’s stirrings follow constant principles,
Adhering to the plumb line, aligning with the seasons and qi.
Hard and soft are determined, never encroaching upon each other.
The Five Phases guard their boundaries, never recklessly waxing or waning.
The *Changes* circulate, flowing and bending, contracting and extending,
Concealing and emerging, transforming within.
Encompassing the myriad things, it governs the Dao’s framework.
From nonbeing, it shapes being; the vessel’s use lies in its emptiness.
Thus, it infers the waxing and waning of Kan and Li, their rise and fall.
Words are not idly crafted; theories are not baselessly born.
Citing evidence, verifying effects, calibrating measures,
Divine clarity infers the patterns, structuring characters to reveal the principle.
Kan is the moon’s essence, *wu*; Li is the sun’s radiance, *si*.
Sun and moon form the *Changes*, hard and soft in balance.
Earth flourishes in the four seasons, weaving the beginning and end.
Blue, red, white, black—each resides in its quadrant,
All receiving the power of the central palace, *wu* and *si*.
Between the dark and new moons, their signs converge, moving within.
Chaos and vastness, female and male unite,
Their fluids moistening and nourishing, their transformations flowing.
Heaven and earth, spirits and numina—beyond measure.
Their utility lies in securing the body, refining form, and concealing the origin.
Beginning in the northeast, the region of *Ji* and *Dou*,
It revolves rightward, spewing forth sprouts, hidden depths revealing signs.
Emerging in the clarity of *Mao* and *Bi*,
*Zhen* arises as the omen, yang qi’s inception.
The first nine: the hidden dragon.
Yang is established by threes, yin by eights.
Three days, *Zhen* stirs; eight days, *Dui* moves.
The second nine: the dragon appears, peaceful and luminous.
The third five virtues coalesce, forming the body of *Qian*.
The third nine: vigilant at dusk, the divine tally wanes and waxes, gradually transforming, returning to its origin.
*Xun* continues the lineage, consolidating and upholding.
The fourth nine: leaping or retreating, the path is perilous.
*Gen* governs advance and retreat, not overstepping the time—
Twenty-three days, holding to the appointed term.
The fifth nine: the flying dragon, in the celestial position, rejoices.
The sixth five: *Kun* bears and binds, completing the cycle, nurturing the multitude of offspring, ever the mother of the world.
The ninth: the exalted dragon battles in the wild.
Using the nine: soaring as the Dao’s compass.
Yang’s numbers conclude, then begin anew.
Pushing emotions to align with nature, revolving in mutual succession,
The jade pivot ascends and descends, circulating above and below.
The six lines are difficult to discern, thus they have no fixed position—
This is the ancestral origin of the *Changes*.
At dawn of the new moon, *Fu* begins, yang’s inception.
Entering and exiting without hindrance, it establishes the standard of firmness.
The *Huangzhong* pitch is set at *zi*, its signs flourishing.
Spreading warmth, the gentle qi steams the black millet, attaining constancy.
Approaching the furnace, the path opens, the light of rectification [or: generation] shines,
Growing brighter day by day.
*Chou*’s *Dalü* binds and adjusts, rising and falling to form *Tai*.
Hard and soft unite, yin and yang intertwine—
The small departs, the great arrives, converging at *yin*, advancing with the season.
Passing through *Dazhuang*, arrayed at the gate of *mao*,
Elm pods fall, returning to their root.
Punishment and virtue contend; day and night begin to divide.
*Guai*: yin retreats, yang ascends, advancing.
Washing and cleansing the wings, shaking off the dust of the past,
Vigorous and bright, its radiance spreads to the four neighbors.
Yang concludes at the center of *si*, then *Gou* begins the sequence.
Treading frost appears first; the well’s chill lies deepest.
*Wu* is the guest, submitting to yin; yin becomes the host.
Retreating from the worldly position, gathering its essence,
Cherishing virtue, awaiting the time, lingering in obscurity.
Dark and blocked, *Pi* is impassable; sprouts do not grow.
Yin extends, yang contracts, yang is lost [or: injured, wounded].
---

When injury is leveled, it is thus.
Observe names and examine their measures of power and balance,
Discern the sentiments of mid-autumn:
Entrusting accumulation, guarding the young and old,
Withering and reviving, shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew.
They emerge under cover, yet when *Bo* decays,
Limbs rot, form dissolves,
Qi transforms and exhausts, vanishing without trace.
When the divine Dao reaches its limit, it returns to *Kun*’s origin,
Eternally compliant with earth’s principle,
Upholding heaven’s decree, spreading the profound and distant,
Obscure and remote, yet linked in resonance.
Nurturing the seed of yin and yang’s origin,
Vast and indistinct, none know its beginning.
First lost, then straying from the path; later, becoming the sovereign lord.
No plain without slope—such is the Dao’s natural course.
Flourishing and decline alternate, waxing and waning follow one another.
*Kun* ends, *Fu* begins, as if tracing an endless ring.
Emperors and kings, in succession for a thousand autumns, endure,
Governing at the helm, renewing the old, grasping the subtle and precise,
Unfolding and disseminating the precious essential Dao.
The Dipper’s handle unifies transformation’s guiding threads.
Hexagrams stir within, fortune and misfortune arise without.
The five planets interweave, responding to time,
Moving the four seasons and seven regulators.
When discordant, they separate and scatter;
When harmonious, they bow and rise.
*Wenchang* governs and records, interrogating and holding accountable.
The Three Dukes and all officials, each overseeing their domain,
Trace beginnings to ends, preserving or losing the thread.
If the ruler grows arrogant and indulgent, exceeding the Dao,
Or if ministers turn treacherous, acting against the proper path,
Hopes and expectations waver, fortunes shift, misfortune strikes.
The law enforces reproach, interrogating faults,
Imposing consequences upon the sovereign’s celestial pole.
Yet a wise ruler, governing with clarity, leaves the state free of harm.

When *Chen Xianwei* says:
*Qian* and *Kun*, hard and soft, pair and envelop one another,
Naturally, yang bestows while yin receives and conceals.
For yang, being masculine, scatters and sows;
Yin, being feminine, contains and receives.
Solitary yang does not generate; solitary yin does not nurture.
Masculine and feminine depend on each other,
Dispersing and spreading essence to complete creation.
As with human conception, none arise without yin and yang’s union—
Thus, creation’s workings begin with *Qian* and *Kun*.
Yet now *Kan* and *Li* are placed at the forefront,
For *Qian* and *Kun* are heaven and earth,
While *Kan* and *Li* are sun and moon.
Heaven and earth, though fixed in place, cannot merge into one,
Yet within their midst, sun and moon unite.
Thus, *Qian* and *Kun* form the elixir’s body,
While *Kan* and *Li* serve as its function.
Speaking only of *Kan* and *Li* at the outset
Emphasizes that the great elixir’s efficacy lies entirely in *Kan* and *Li*.
Yet *Kan* and *Li*’s function operates between *Qian* and *Kun*’s two bodies,
Rising and descending, soaring and hiding, ceaselessly shifting—
How easily could this be depicted?
The sage, wishing to gauge its profound subtleties for learners,
Observes that among the sixty miscellaneous hexagrams,
A single yang line and a single yin line,
Whether above or below, remain elusive and hard to fathom.
One should act like a wise ruler governing the times,
Using the sixty hexagrams as a chariot,
Abiding in effortless action to harness them.
Then, one may proceed serenely, step by step,
Advancing along the Dao with grace, harmony, and ease,
The path smooth and steady from beginning to end,
Circling through all hexagrams without peril.
Thus it is said: In harmony, one follows the path,
The road level, without deviation.
If one fails to attain this and recklessly takes a crooked path,
There will be the worry of overturning, the fault of peril.
*Liu Haichan* said: "Do not let the purple river chariot overturn"—
This carries the same meaning.
Though the road may be level, one must guard against danger,
Proceeding with utmost care.

The noble one, dwelling in his chamber,
Each has his appointed day.
For those cultivating the elixir, a year in seclusion is especially arduous.
Though their movements may be slight, their influence is profound.
Like a ruler of ten thousand chariots, dwelling deep within the ninefold gates,
Every action, word, or silence affects celestial harmony.
As the *Yi* says: "The noble one, dwelling in his chamber,
Resonates a thousand *li* away"—this serves as a fitting comparison.
One must follow yin and yang’s ascent and descent,
Advancing or halting with punishment and virtue,
Cherishing the supreme treasure,
Guarding the pupil of one’s eye,
Nurturing an infant,
Holding a full vessel,
Awaiting the appointed time without transgressing the hexagram’s month.
*Zhun* spans from *zi* to *shen*;
*Lin* spans from *yin* to *xu*.
The remaining hexagrams each have their appointed time.
For in a single day, two hexagrams unfold;
In one hour, six lines shift.
To discern yin and yang, one must distinguish day and night;
To know day and night, one must separate black and white.
Once black and white are distinct, hexagrams and lines are grasped.
As the *Yi* says: "Understand the Dao of day and night, and you will know"—
This is its meaning.

I briefly outline the two images—*Zhun* and *Lin*—
Yet cannot exhaust their depths, daring not fully reveal the celestial mechanism of fire.
When scholars encounter a teacher and receive guidance,
Timing their actions to congeal the elixir’s foundation,
They must adhere to the calendar’s principles,
Utterly sincere, meticulous, and vigilant,
Observing day and night, scrutinizing waxing and waning.
When yang arises, advance, as one bestows virtue when benevolence is due;
When yin arises, retreat, as one enacts punishment when justice demands.
Compliance brings fortune; defiance brings misfortune.
If even a hair’s breadth strays from this,
Regret and adversity lurk within, becoming thieves and harms—
Like weeds among seedlings, dust on a mirror.
Moreover, if people refining cinnabar fear errors in water and fire,
How much more so for this golden liquor, the great elixir?

At the two solstices, the measure changes.
The two solstices mark yin and yang’s inception and emergence.
If their function errs, celestial anomalies follow:
Summer snow, winter thunder, calamities and omens turn grim.
The two equinoxes mark yin and yang’s division and union.
If their function errs, celestial anomalies likewise arise—
Mountains crumble, earth splits, floods and droughts wreak havoc beyond measure.
This occurs when those who regulate fire miss the time, erring,
And the true embryo is harmed, the world collapses.
The filial son is likened to the true embryo,
The imperial standard to fortune and misfortune.
Thus, some achieve great peace, others bring war;
Some invite misfortune, others invite blessing—
All are summoned by the fire-regulator’s heart and mind.

The method of refining the elixir differs not from worldly methods.
Yet the consequences of governing the world are like echoes and shadows—
How much more so when seizing heaven and earth’s creation,
Aligning one’s virtue with heaven and earth, synchronizing with their movement?
Movement and stillness must be constant,
Following the inked line without deviation,
Adapting to the four seasons’ rhythms,
Naturally harmonizing with the two qi.
The hard does not overstep; the soft does not retreat.
Whether bending or stretching, returning or overturning,
The five phases circulate, each guarding its bounds—
Only then can one be free from worry.

Profound and unfathomable, hidden and elusive,
Yet within, transformation gives birth to the supreme treasure—
Like yin and yang’s union, generating the ten thousand things,
Serving as the Dao’s guiding threads.

To wield the formless in shaping the formed—
The *Jinbi Jing* states: "Form and formless restrain each other."
The Vermilion Bird flames through empty space,
Amid purple blossoms the sun’s radiance shines—
Yet cinnabar and mercury vanish away.

Master Wei’s words but elucidate the *Jinbi Jing*’s safeguard:
That safeguard lies in using the fire of true emptiness—
The nature’s fire—to govern the water of life,
The supreme treasure.
Fire’s essence is emptiness; it manifests only when meeting things.
All that is luminous and selfless belongs to fire’s virtue.
Yet when fire is moved within the crucible of the great void,
Purple flames fill the heavens, red light suffuses the golden palace,
Jade towers transform in myriad ways,
Divine beasts and spirit dragons soar in ten thousand forms—
These are lead and mercury,
Also the Kan and Li trigrams.
They are not nothingness,
Yet once their function is complete, where do they abide?
Thus it is said: "Trace the waxing and waning—Kan and Li vanish away."
Words are not idly spoken.

As for the workings of Wu and Ji in the *Yi*’s system of hexagram-nucleus correspondence:
Kan embraces the six Wu; Li embraces the six Ji.
Kan is the moon; Li is the sun.
Hence it is said: "Kan’s Wu is the moon’s essence; Li’s Ji is the sun’s light."
The characters for "sun" and "moon" combine to form *yi* (change).
Thus it is said: "Trace the turning to knit the character."
All these are grounded in principle as proof, not empty conjecture.

Since the *Yi* does not transcend sun and moon,
How could the elixir not originate in Kan and Li?
Yet Kan and Li both preserve Wu and Ji.
As the ancients said: "It is only because each holds true earth
That the golden elixir achieves return and restoration."
Moreover, earth flourishes in all four seasons,
Weaving through the beginning and end.
Though water, fire, metal, and wood each dwell in their own quadrant,
All receive the virtue of earth from the central palace.

Zhang Ziyang’s poem says:
"The four images and five phases wholly rely on earth—
Great indeed is earth’s virtue!"
For earth is the mother of metal.

Knowing that the five phases all return to earth, one then knows that the five phases all transform into metal. Only then can one guard the creative process within the central palace and sow the yellow sprout in the posterior earth.

Between the dark and new moons, when radiant essence scatters forth, one must align and act within the center, like the primordial chaos of Hongmeng—immeasurable. For this is the time when yin and yang unite, fluids moisten, and transformative circulation flows. How could one apply effort here? Thus it is fitting to rest the body, conceal the form, and withdraw to the region of Jidou, where the wheel of emergence may emit its luminous glow. As Hanshanzi’s poem says: "Do not expose the root—if the root is hollow, the fruit will fall." For substance and function differ, and so too does the application of effort.

Above Mao and Bi, turning and interacting, Master Wei likens the waxing and waning of the moon within a month to the advance and retreat of hexagram images. From the third day, one yang arises; by the eighth day, two yangs; by the fifteenth, three yangs are complete, and the Qian trigram is formed. On the sixteenth, one yin is born; by the twenty-third, two yins; by the thirtieth, three yins are complete, and the Kun trigram is formed. Mao and Bi reside in the west at the Geng position. On the third day of the month, the moon appears faintly in the west at the Geng position, corresponding to Zhen’s initial yang, and in the *Zhouyi*’s method of hexagram-nourishing, Zhen is assigned six Geng. The creative principle aligns thus. By the eighth day, the moon appears in the upper half of the southern sky at the Ding position, corresponding to Dui’s two yangs, and in the nourishing method, Dui is assigned six Ding. By the fifteenth, the moon is full in the east at the Jia position, and the Qian hexagram is assigned six Jia. At this time, the three yangs of the hexagram are complete, the Way of three and five has culminated, and what was full begins to wane, what extended retracts, what was high descends, and what ascended now falls. On the sixteenth, one yin is born, and yin begins its dominion. At dawn, the moon appears in the west at the Xin position, corresponding to Xun, which is assigned Xin. By the twenty-third, at dawn, the moon appears in the south at the Bing position, corresponding to Gen, which is assigned Bing. By the thirtieth, the moon sets in the east at the Yi position, corresponding to Kun, which is assigned Yi. When the cycle ends, it yields to yang once more, and the revolving jade mechanism turns endlessly.

As the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*, within a single day, the fire-phase revolves like the turning of the jade mechanism: ascending from Zi to Wu, descending thereafter, traversing the six lines. Though no visible traces are observed, the creative process is silently guarded within the heart. At this time, the numinous medicine follows the sun’s movement, ascending and descending, rising and falling, never pausing, never fixed in position. Thus it aligns with the *Yi*’s principle of yang ascending and yin descending.

That it is called the ancestral foundation of the *Yi* means that the sages first awakened to the principle of the golden elixir, cultivating themselves to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood. Thereafter, they expounded this principle in the *Yi* to instruct later generations. Thus we know that the *Yi* was composed based on the great elixir, and the Way of the great elixir is the ancestral foundation of the *Yi*.

At the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* (Return) begins: at midnight, the Zi hour, the fire-phase commences. Before one yang arises, the fire-phase is still; the multitude of yins gather like the masses without governance. When the fire-phase moves, yang qi begins to flow, spreading warmth, steaming and fumigating the crucible. Once the light appears, it becomes the master of all transformations. At this time, the cultivator silently guards the mechanism of advancing the fire, using subtle firmness as the standard, moving in and out, gathering and releasing without haste. From here onward, cultivation gradually increases until pure Qian is achieved, and the treasure is forged. In the initial stages, one must be especially cautious. As the poem of the predecessors says: "On cold nights, tend to the fire; guard against the crowd until dawn." This is the meaning of "spreading gentle warmth, steaming to attain constancy."

Before the furnace, applying the twigs: at the Chou hour, advancing the two yangs’ fire-phase. By this time, radiance gradually increases, opening the mysterious path, and the light is true. Yang arises from below, so one should congeal it below. At this time, the effort is properly low. After passing this line, one gradually releases and lifts, following the transformative mechanism. Thus it is said: "Congeal properly in low and high, lifting to form *Tai*."

Moving and hastening with the time: at the Yin hour, advancing the three yangs’ fire-phase. By this time, firm and yielding separate, yin and yang each occupy half. Above is water, below is fire. Thus essence-water ascends, spirit-fire descends. What lifts desires to rise, what descends desires to fall. Yin and yang unite, the small departs and the great arrives, and the creative process converges here.

Day and night begin to divide: at the Mao hour, advancing the four yangs’ bathing phase. At this time, day and night begin to separate, life and death are balanced, and all things flourish in spring. Only the elm’s pods fall, for they correspond to the stars. At dawn, the golden elixir aligns with the myriad phenomena, and all phenomena arise from the sun and moon.

*Guai* (Decisiveness) retreats yin: at the Chen hour, advancing the five yangs’ fire-phase. By this time, the five yangs ascend, and the water source is clear and limpid, like a bird emerging from water, shaking its wings to wash away the dust of the past, preparing to soar into the heavens.

Qian’s vigor and brightness: at the Si hour, advancing the six yangs’ fire-phase. By this time, the pure Qian body is complete, the moon is full, the water is abundant, the light is radiant, the spirit is full, centered and unbiased, round and unbroken. Its light illumines the four directions, pervading the ten quarters.

*Gou* (Encounter) begins its threads: at the Wu hour, retreating one yin’s tally-phase. By this time, yin is the host and yang the guest. If one does not recognize the host within the guest or the guest within the host, a hair’s breadth of error brings no small harm. Though one yin has just sprouted and seems harmless, how can one ignore the cold spring at the well’s bottom or the frost preceding ice? Thus the predecessors urgently discuss the distinction between host and guest.

Withdrawing from the world, relinquishing position: at the Wei hour, retreating two yins’ tally-phase. Blocked and impassable, nothing flows.

Concealing yang’s name: at the Shen hour, retreating three yins’ tally-phase.

Observing its measure: at the You hour, retreating four yins’ bathing phase. Shepherd’s purse and wheat correspond to the sun, so by the eighth month, their sprouts emerge. The sun’s spirit is conceived in You. Wood reaches this point and conceals its embryo; earth reaches this point and bathes. Thus You is the bathing phase.

*Bo* (Splitting) disintegrates the limbs: at the Xu hour, retreating five yins’ tally-phase. When the Way is exhausted, it returns.

Bearing heaven and spreading proclamation: at the Hai hour, retreating six yins’ tally-phase.

The profound and distant mystery endures through a thousand ages. The lodestone draws iron, the yang-brush ignites fire, the square-vessel gathers water—all exemplify the principle of yin and yang mutually resonating, barriers yet communicating. Who can fathom its beginnings or ends?

The work of refining the elixir begins in obscurity and confusion. Only when the firing times are complete and the elixir’s power matures does one realize the body as the World-Honored One, like an emperor mounting his chariot. Is this Way anything other than the mechanism of "Kun’s end and Fu’s beginning"?

At the outset of governance, each office attends to its domain. The initial effort in cultivation is like the start of governance: one must suppress and sever all perverse excess, cast aside desires, and restrain the primal qi, making the guard firm and unyielding, with no fear of leakage. Naturally, treasure spreads within the golden womb, and spirit is born in the royal chamber. If even a hair’s breadth deviates, it is like governance gone awry, provoking timely responses and celestial omens, disrupting the harmony. The crux lies in managing the firing times with utmost precision, embodying the turning of the Dipper’s handle and the movement within the hexagrams. Auspicious and ominous signs arise externally: the five planets may misalign, or the constellations may stray from their paths.

The elixir resides in the spirit-chamber as a ruler establishes a state. The ruler’s founding of a state draws from celestial patterns: there are the Three Terraces, the positions of the ducal ministers; there is the Literary Prosperity office, which oversees records. The duty of the ducal ministers is to sit in counsel, harmonizing yin and yang, ensuring each official fulfills their role—thus accountability rests with the ducal ministers. The office of records measures talent, demoting or promoting the worthy and unworthy, ensuring each official maximizes their ability—thus oversight lies with Literary Prosperity. When all offices perform their duties, the people and things are at peace, and the realm enjoys great tranquility. When the hexagrams’ fire-signs do not lose their measure, the myriad transformations flow smoothly, and the sacred embryo grows. Yet governing a state depends on the summons of one person; refining the elixir depends on the resonance of one heart.

Tracing origins to essential ends: if a state suffers no harm, its ruler may grow arrogant, overbearing, or excessive, deviating from the Way—this is when the earthly number is excessive, and the balance is disrupted. Or ministers may be treacherous and perverse, acting contrary to proper order—this is when the watery weight is unstable. When weights and measures wax or wane, discord and misfortune arise; if blame is misplaced, fire’s excess lies with earth. The *Jinbi Jing* states, "It is not fire’s fault; the reprimand belongs to earth," referring precisely to this.

The elixir resides in the spirit-chamber as the North Star stands above, aligning the host of stars. The ruler governs by overseeing the myriad states; centered and unmoving, with reverent composure and non-action, the realm attains peace. Thus governance models itself on heaven, and the elixir models itself on governance.

Peng Xiao said: Qian’s hardness and Kun’s softness unite and embrace. In refining the golden liquid and returning elixir, one first establishes the cauldron of Qian and Kun in the state of *jiji* (hexagram 63). Then yin and yang conjoin their essence and qi within it. Next, water and fire, Kan and Li, follow in succession, uniting sun and moon, dragon and tiger. Thus the cauldron’s interior shines with profound brilliance, its depths visible. This is achieved by measuring the sacred texts, investigating the "mother of medicines," so that Qian and Kun, Li and Kan, merge and align, traversing the six voids, unfolding the five qi, cycling through the sixty hexagrams, passing the twelve earthly branches, forming a chariot to welcome the dragon-horse. Within lies the Golden Mother of the Central Palace, like a ruler governing the state, harmonizing the seasonal qi to follow, practicing non-action to achieve great compliance. Thus the path is level, without incline, and "there is no going that does not return."

If, however, the firing times are misaligned and the timing lacks precision, the path becomes perilous and obstructed, the state topples, and the Golden Consort within the spirit-chamber has no support, leading to rampant production. The essence of the golden elixir lies entirely in the two words: lead and fire. Lead and fire are water and fire, the ancestors of return. The remaining five phases and qi-times all assist in its completion. The Golden Consort is the Golden Mother.

The noble one dwells in their chamber: each has its appointed day. The *Yi* says, "When the noble one dwells in their chamber and speaks good words, there is response from a thousand *li* away." This illustrates the Metal Elder residing in the spirit-chamber, like a ruler in the ninefold palace. In managing the morning and evening water and fire, issuing commands is like proclaiming decrees, ensuring all qi are properly placed. One must also remain tranquil and non-active, storing the vessel until the time is right, following the hexagram lines, observing the clepsydra’s marks, and carefully reviewing each. The "morning and evening tally-signs" refer to the sixty hexagrams corresponding to a month’s cycle, with day and night each receiving one hexagram, cycling endlessly. *Yin* and *shen* are the positions where yin and yang begin and end.

I briefly present the two images: regret and remorse become thieves. The "two images" refer to water and fire, yin and yang. From *zi* to *si* belongs to spring and summer, when fire governs the phase of generation. Contained within the vessel, it warms and nurtures the spirit—this is the image of enacting benevolence. From *wu* to *hai* belongs to autumn and winter, when the tally-sign governs the phase of restraint. Descending into the womb, it coagulates the numinous mercury—this is the image of establishing justice and punishment.

Master Wei enables later generations to understand the movements of the sun and moon, the rise and fall of yin and yang, following the hexagrams and lines, with cold and heat as warnings. By carefully attending to waxing and waning, ensuring no regret or remorse arises within the cauldron, no thieves emerge from the images, the red essence descends as qi, the white mercury takes form, and the golden liquid returning elixir is swiftly achieved.

The solstices and equinoxes alter their measures. The summer solstice, winter solstice, spring equinox, and autumn equinox—these four refer to *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* among the twelve earthly branches, dividing the four seasons’ boundaries. Additionally, the virtue of earth traverses the ends of the four seasons, giving rise to the forms of dragon and tiger, metal and wood. Not only are the four seasons marked, but within the twelve branches, the twenty-four qi and seventy-two hou further symbolize the yearly qi-number.

If the clepsydra’s marks are off by a hair’s breadth, the sun and moon lose their measure, the new and full moons become uneven, day and night unequal. If the yang fire exceeds its mark, water and drought become unbalanced, and midwinter transforms into scorching summer. If the yin tally-sign loses its rhythm, cold and warmth clash, and midsummer reverses into thick frost. In the golden palace, cinnabar and mercury fail to sprout; in the jade cauldron, insects and pests arise. In major cases, mountains collapse and the earth splits, the metal tiger and wood dragon boil over. In minor cases, violent rains and fierce winds arise, the Kan man and Li woman flee, the metal tiger and wood dragon—east and west’s souls and spirits—scatter. The Kan man and Li woman are the husband and wife of south and north. If the filial child scatters, the true mercury within the womb is disrupted by misaligned firing times, flying away without rest, even causing the imperial cauldron’s mouth to burst forth in distant lands.

Whether auspicious or ominous, rising or falling, these and the above transformations all stem from the cultivator’s own heart. If one can model the celestial mechanism, weigh the sun and moon, carefully consider harmonization, and with utmost sincerity manage the firing times, summoning harmonious qi within the cauldron to produce pure yang, enabling the true master within the womb to generate pure Kun—this is called true mercury.

When movement and stillness follow their constant principles, bending and stretching, reversing and repeating—all in the operation of water and fire—movement and stillness must adhere to their proper times, enabling the qi of dragon and tiger to depend on one another. Like mother and child, they cherish and long for each other; the Five Phases guard their boundaries, circulating through the four seasons without deficit or excess, returning and reversing without loss—thus success may be witnessed daily.

Hidden and submerged, concealed and obscure, they serve as the guiding principles of the Dao. Whether concealed or manifest, active or latent, they form the root of all transformations and the mother of all generation and completion. Hence, they are called the guiding principles of the Dao.

From non-being, one governs being. When Kan and Li vanish, that which is "non-being" is the dragon; that which is "being" is the tiger. "Non-being" is the yang qi of mercury; "being" is the yin essence of lead. Lead and mercury reside within the empty vessel yet cannot spontaneously generate transformation. Through the ascent and descent of Kan and Li, the revolving of the four seasons, generation and completion become manifest—this is using the empty vessel to govern being with non-being.

The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* states: "Being and non-being restrain each other. When the Vermilion Bird flames in emptiness, yin arises and yang retreats; when yang stirs, yin conceals. As one wanes and the other waxes, Li and Kan vanish and reappear with the seasons."

Words are not carelessly fabricated. The workings of wu and ji are not idly invented by the sage to delude later generations. Thus, he cites the verification of the sun and moon, the efficacy of spirit and numen, the division of hardness and softness, the explication of metal and water, the analogy of dragon and tiger, the operation of yin and yang to gather essence, the completion of the work through the Five Soils, and the culmination in the four seasons—thereby obtaining the cyclical succession of blue, red, white, and black, all governed by wu and ji.

Kan wu is the essence of the moon—lunar yin. Wu is yang, representing yin containing yang, like metal born within water: the tiger. Li ji is the light of the sun—solar yang. Ji is yin, representing yang containing yin, like mercury born within fire: the dragon. Thus, in refining the elixir, one gathers the essence of the sun and moon, embraces the numinous qi of yin and yang, and when the cycle of stellar revolutions is complete and the movement of yin and yang concludes, all returns in merit to the virtue of earth, and spirit and essence are perfected.

The character *guan* (觀) is structured to resemble the sun and moon. Between the dark and new moon, at the moment when metal and water unite—after *gen* and before *yin*—yin and yang converge. As the yang tally retreats, metal and water share a common origin, merging in primordial chaos, male and female harmonizing, flowing metal moistening, fluids nourishing the mother’s womb, giving birth to the numinous and unfathomable. This enables the body to be at peace, the essence to be concealed, the form to be hidden, the substance to be stored, and the radiance of spirit to gradually emerge.

From the northeast, turning right, it encounters the new moon and revives, rising from the Dipper and Winnowing Basket, revolving to the west, spewing forth sprouts, gradually striving for brightness—though still within the concealment of yin—preparing to restore its former fullness. Thus, in the northeast, the *gen* region, it follows the position of inception and completion, the reawakening of the hidden dragon.

By analogy, when the tally reaches between *xu* and *hai*, the metal and water within the cauldron resemble the dark and new moon, nearing the *zi* tally’s inception. The *gen* position is not far from *yin*, hence it is said to "spew forth sprouts." Like the metal mother during the dark and new moon, metal and water flourish. At the first day of the month, encountering the *zi* tally’s single yang fire, metal meets fire and regains brilliance, revolving left to sprout and gradually generate the dragon’s body.

Thus, the following text states: "Gradual transformation in prosperity and decline ultimately returns to the origin."

Above the Pleiades and Hyades, the arousal of *zhen* serves as evidence. When the moon first emerges in the west above the Pleiades and Hyades, it proceeds with the yang fire. At *zi* and *chou*, the circulation of qi, completing one revolution every five days, begins here. The first yang line is born, the initial stirring of *zhen* qi, the inception within the cauldron. From this, yang qi gradually arises, and after three cycles of five days—fifteen days in total—pure *qian* is completed, and the body is fully formed.

"Yang is established in three" refers to the fire proceeding for three days, the initial spread of yang qi within the cauldron—hence "three days of *zhen* arousal." "Yin communicates in eight" means that after two five-day periods, two yang lines are born. By the eighth day, *dui* metal is activated, the qi of metal and water stabilizes, belonging to the upper trigram *kan*, with metal and water communicating—hence "eight days of *dui* progression."

"At nine-two, the dragon appears, peaceful and luminous" refers to the moon reaching the upper *kan*, its form half-complete, like the metal and water within the cauldron receiving the *yin* and *mao* tallies, with yin and yang each occupying half.

"Three and five, virtue is accomplished" refers to *qian* progressing to nine-three, reaching *chen* and *si*, precisely three five-day periods—fifteen days in total—with all three lines transformed into pure yang, the *qian* body fully formed. Thereafter, yin and yang divide, hence it is said: "Gradual transformation in prosperity and decline ultimately returns to the origin," cycling endlessly.

*Xun* succeeds in governing yin. At nine-four, with the yang line retreating and one yin line transforming, *xun* thus receives and leads the yin tally, proceeding for five days above *wu* and *wei*. The soft line gradually advances, yin qi revolving and arising, enveloping the yang essence, preventing any reckless movement. After four five-day periods, two yin lines are born. *Gen* proceeds for five periods, the tally reaching *shen* and *you*, encountering the lower *kan*—the twenty-third day—when metal and water are again balanced.

At nine-five, the flying dragon ascends to the celestial position, adding joy. At six five-day periods—thirty days—*kun* governs the yin tally, reaching *xu* and *hai*, when the qi of *qian* and *kun* are complete, the yin and yang of dragon and tiger, and the revolutions of the myriad things. Hence, it is said: "Nine-five adds joy."

At six-five, *kun* bears and binds, encompassing the beginning and end, nurturing all offspring as the mother of *guan*. When *kun* first transforms one line into yang, it becomes *zhen*, the eldest son of the *qian* household. When all three lines transform into pure yang, *qian* is formed. When yang reaches its extreme, yin is born, returning to the *qian* body, transforming one line into yin to become *xun*, the eldest daughter of the *kun* household. When all three lines transform into pure yin, *kun* is formed. From beginning to end, emergence and concealment all proceed from the *kun* body, nurturing the myriad things as the eternal mother of *guan*. All offspring are the various hexagrams.

Thus, six-five *kun* bears and binds, completing the cyclical return of the elixir, serving as the compass and square of the Dao.

"Using nine, fluttering and light" means that when yang reaches its extreme, it reveals its mandate and retreats—thus, having exhausted its number, it turns and interacts.

The revolving jade armillary follows the celestial mechanism, serving as the ancestral origin of the *Yi*. As stated above, *qian* and *kun* are the compass and square of the Dao. To follow the principles of yin and yang, one must adhere to the movements of the Dipper, with transformations fully expressed in the six lines, circulating without fixed position—this is the ancestral origin of the *Yi* Dao. It analogizes the operation of Kan and Li’s qi within the cauldron, circulating through the six voids within the image, its profound subtleties concealed and latent—this is the ancestral origin of the medicine.

At the new moon’s dawn, it is *Fu*. Five yin and one yang: yin qi has reached its extreme, and yang qi returns upward. The six soft lines of the lower trigram first transform into one hard line—this is the omen of the birth of one yang, hence the yang fire begins at the initial *zi*.

The common people receive constancy. At the new moon’s dawn, it is *Fu*: five yin lines and one yang line, with yin qi at its extreme and yang qi returning. This is the hexagram of the six soft lines’ lower trigram first transforming into one hard line—the sign of the birth of one yang—hence the yang fire begins at the initial *zi*.

At the inception of yang qi, the pitch corresponds to *Huangzhong*; within the cauldron, it receives the protective yang qi, laying the foundation for cinnabar and mercury. With five yin and one yang, yang as the master disperses qi to flow without obstruction—this is called "entering and exiting without hindrance."

The *Yi* says: *Fu* returns; returning is its Way. Is this not the manifestation of Heaven and Earth’s heart? It illustrates that within the cauldron of Heaven and Earth, the generation of the myriad things begins here, corresponding to the advance of yang fire in the eleventh month, *zi*.

Approaching the furnace to apply the firing regimen, adjusting the balance—*Lin* is the hexagram of four yin and two yang, symbolizing the progression of *chou* fire as yang virtue gradually advances, illuminating the cauldron. After the winter solstice, the days lengthen, and yang qi increasingly spreads, engendering spirit and essence. The correspondence with *Dalü* and the adjustment of balance refer to the gradual coagulation of metal and water, with flowing pearls forming above—this aligns with the advance of yang fire in the twelfth month, *chou*.

Raising it to form *Tai*, moving in accord with the season—*Tai* is the hexagram of three yin and three yang, where yin and yang qi balance, and husband and wife unite, gradually foreshadowing the essence of dragon and tiger, flourishing gold and mercury. Thus it is said: "The small departs, the great arrives." The *Yi* says: "There is no level that does not slope, no going that does not return"—this is the Way of yin and yang’s mutual succession, corresponding to the advance of yang fire in the first month, *yin*.

Progressing through *Dazhuang*, day and night begin to divide—*Dazhuang* is the hexagram of two yin and four yang, signifying that in mid-spring, though yang qi is abundant, it still contains yin qi, and the path of yin is about to depart. Hence, the elm pods fall following the yang. "Punishment and virtue contend" refers to the second and eighth months, the times when yin and yang divide their positions: yang is virtue, and virtue engenders the myriad things; yin is punishment, and punishment causes the myriad things to perish. Thus, in the second month, yang contains yin, and yin qi assaults things, so in mid-spring, the elm pods fall—this symbolizes that gold and sand, stirred by residual yin qi, descend into the womb. Hence, it is called "returning to the root." In the eighth month, yin contains yang, and yang qi arises, so in mid-autumn, the shepherd’s purse and wheat regenerate—this symbolizes that metal and water, nourished by residual yang qi, fill the chamber with fluid. Hence, it is called "renewed flourishing." The following *Guan* hexagram states: "At the juncture where punishment and virtue contend, yin and yang balance"—this corresponds to the cessation of the tally in the second month, *mao*.

*Guai*: yin retreats, shaking off the dust of the past—*Guai* is the hexagram of one yin and five yang, where yang ascends and yin retreats. Though yang qi is abundant, residual protective yin qi remains within the cauldron, which the *chen* fire scours, allowing the gold and sand to be cleansed, their wings shaking off the dust of the past. This corresponds to the advance of yang fire in the third month, *chen*.

*Qian*’s vigorous brilliance, centered and mutually engaging—The *Yi* says: "Great indeed is *Qian*’s primal power—firm, strong, centered, upright, pure, and refined." *Qian*’s primal power is the resource from which the myriad things begin. From the winter solstice’s birth of one yang to pure yang, clouds drift and rain falls, and the forms of things flow forth. This illustrates that within the cauldron, from the eleventh month’s reception of the tally to the fourth month, when all six lines transform into pure *Qian*, the resource is complete. Thus, the metal embryo encounters the fire of true yang, and metal, meeting fire, becomes a vessel, increasingly radiant, widely spreading to the four neighbors, filling the cauldron’s chamber. This corresponds to the advance of yang fire in the fourth month, *si*. "Centered and mutually engaging" means that when yang reaches its extreme, yin is born—referring to the following text’s "yin *Qian* and yang virtue."

*Gou* begins the sequence, with yin as the master—The *Yi* says: *Gou* is encounter. With five yang and one yin, yin arises and yang retreats; yin and yang divide their boundaries, and dragon and tiger mate, hence their encounter. It also says: "Tied to the metal *ni*, steadfast and auspicious"—the one yin first sings, tethered to the *wu* hour, transforming until extreme yin. "Treading frost first" means that when one yin is born, it must reach extreme yin; just as where there is protective frost, there must be solid ice. The "cold spring at the well’s bottom" refers to five yang below and one yin, where yin qi has not yet spread, and though the five yang are many, yin is now in charge. In all hexagrams, six lines with five yin and one yang take yang as master; five yang and one yin take yin as master. The many are mastered by the few, hence it is said: "yin is the master." This means that within the cauldron, the metal mother is originally the essence of supreme yin water; when it first receives yin qi’s protective signal, metal and water briefly express their nature, and one must know that solid ice and extreme yin are approaching. This corresponds to the retreat of the yin tally in the fifth month, *wu*.

Withdrawing from the world and relinquishing position, dwelling in obscurity—*Dun* is the hexagram of four yang and two yin, where yin qi gradually strengthens and yang qi gradually weakens. Yang withdraws from its position, gathering true essence to await what is to come. Residual yang dwells in yin, gradually nearing obstruction, hence it dwells in obscurity. The *Yi* says: "Things cannot forever withdraw, hence they await their time." This illustrates that within the cauldron, the essence of the red dragon is governed by yin, gradually merging with metal and water to nurture the maiden, then gathering true essence to follow the transformations of yin and yang. This corresponds to the retreat of the yin tally in the sixth month, *wei*.

*Pi*: blocked and impassable, the name of yang submerged—*Pi* is the hexagram of three yin and three yang, where Heaven and Earth both rest, yin and yang do not unite, and the myriad things do not sprout. The metal mother in the central palace naturally coils and unfurls in tranquility. This corresponds to the retreat of the yin tally in the seventh month, *shen*.

Observing its measure, born through covering—*Guan* is the hexagram of two yang and four yin, where yin qi is already abundant, akin to mid-autumn’s sentiment. Within the cauldron, metal, receiving yin qi, unites with water, transforming and engendering the maiden—quicksilver. Yet yin qi, though in use, still leaves residual yang harmony within the cauldron, which in mid-autumn revives the shepherd’s purse and wheat. Hence, it is said: "The old and withered flourish again." "Born through covering" means born everywhere. This illustrates that metal and water, bearing the yin tally in mid-autumn, nurture the numinous mercury to fill the womb. The second and eighth months, when yin and yang’s punishment and virtue contend, were annotated in the above *Dazhuang* hexagram. This corresponds to the cessation of the tally in the eighth month, *you*.

*Bo*: decaying limbs, the utmost spirit lost—The *Yi* says: *Bo* is flaying. With one yang and five yin, yin flourishes and yang declines; the soft encroaches upon the hard, and both metal and water rest. The limbs dissolve, and their merit returns to earth’s virtue. This corresponds to the retreat of the yin tally in the ninth month, *xu*. "The utmost spirit lost" [erroneously interpreted as *Kun*, not recorded].

When the Way is exhausted, it returns—*Qian* begins with *Kun*’s six yielding lines; beneath the nine earths, one firm line transforms—this is called the birth of one yang. Yang qi begins here, transforming until six changes yield pure *Qian*, its body complete. When pure yang qi is sufficient, yang reaches its extreme, and yin is born. Beneath *Qian*’s six firm lines, one yielding line transforms—this is called the birth of one yin, transforming until six changes yield pure *Kun* again. Hence, it is said: "When the Way is exhausted, it returns"—to *Kun*’s primal power. *Kun* is the Earth Mother.

The yin is so, and *Qian* is the Heavenly Father; the yang is so. Thus, yin attains yang and gives birth, yang attains yin and achieves completion—this is what is called the Dao of one yin and one yang. It bends to form the myriad things without omission, hence it is said: "Eternally following earth’s principle while bearing Heaven’s proclamation." This is likened to one year’s twelve months, one day’s twelve hours, the movement of yin and yang’s advance and retreat, the fire tally aligning with the essential qi of *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li*, cycling endlessly with inexhaustible subtlety. Thus, the sacred maiden and numinous youth conjoin yin and yang within the divine chamber, soaring dragons and crouching tigers unite *gou*-soul and *po*-soul within the mother’s womb. Thereby, divine transformations know no bounds, and what is born is pure and perfect.

Though the profound and distant stretch across a thousand ages, ever abiding, Heaven and Earth may seem remote, yet when the sun and moon exchange qi in accordance with their celestial motions, they remain interconnected, nurturing the seeds of the myriad things as the progenitors of yin and yang. When yin and yang unite their essences in the vast expanse of Heaven and Earth, amidst the boundless and indistinct, none can discern their comings and goings.

This is likened to the cauldron and vessel, which model *Qian* and *Kun* as father and mother, turning the axle of *Kan* and *Li* as male and female within the cauldron’s boundless and indistinct space—none can perceive their transformations or traces. Metal is the root of the elixir within the cauldron. Initially, it is profound yellow, undifferentiated, its path lost and confused. Next, yin and yang divide and judge. Finally, the benevolent ruler and the five phases interact, returning without fail. *Pi* and *Tai* alternate, yin and yang mutually depend, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, rising at the new moon and ceasing at the dark moon. Entering the tally, exiting the fire, augmenting water, pacifying metal, moving fire, halting water—this principle resembles a cycle. Within, the images of metal and water nurture one another, just as the ruler of men does with the four seasons. The tally fire increases and decreases without missing its proper time, and through a thousand autumns, dragon and tiger endure.

The chief of governance begins with the one who directs the tally fire, establishing the initial sequence. Once metal is cast and the cauldron vessel is renewed, the old is transformed—then the seals are secured and the defenses made tight. To unfold and spread the treasure is to allow the inner metal to flow freely, its fluids abundant, metal and water interdependent.

Again, it follows the handle of the Dipper, traversing the twelve hours, ascending in harmony with the five planets amid the four sevens (the twenty-eight lunar mansions). If the weft of the seasons becomes disordered and the tally’s rhythm does not align, fortune and misfortune arise from the hexagrams’ images, and the tally fire falters at dawn or dusk. Thus, the outer five planets fall into disarray, and the inner five viscera lose harmony. If the four sevens deviate, the circumpolar stars scatter and disperse, and within the cauldron, nothing comes to fruition. Though the outer fire moves, if the inner tally remains still and unresponsive, the celestial soul and earthly soul do not conjoin. Thereby, the stars and planets fall into chaos, the sun and moon diverge, the four seasons lose order, and the myriad things fail to grow—all due to the tally fire’s mismanagement in summer and autumn, causing the cauldron’s interior to suffer irregular drought and flood.

The *Wenchang* governs the records: the six stars of the Dipper’s bowl, called the *Wenchang* Palace—first is the Supreme General, second the Secondary General, third the Noble Minister, fourth the Director of Destinies, fifth the Director of Emoluments, and sixth the Director of Calamities. The supporting stars are the six beneath the bowl, paired two by two, called the Three Terraces, which oversee the world. Above, they assist the Son of Heaven in regulating yin and yang and harmonizing the four seasons; below, they ensure the myriad things attain their proper state, enabling ministers and grandees to fulfill their duties. This mirrors the cauldron’s reception of Heaven and Earth’s qi of the myriad things, giving rise to transformations and generation.

When yin and yang are discordant and the four seasons lose their measure, it is like the one who directs the tally fire failing to adjust properly—hence, it is called reproof. The secret of the golden liquor’s return to cinnabar lies in the two words "lead" and "fire," which mark its beginning and end. Though true lead is obtained, true fire is difficult to attain—how can it be lightly discussed?

Thus, Master Wei broadly illustrated it, yet still feared later generations would be misled.

At the origin and essential end, the state follows the harm-free Dao. *[The two sentences "At the origin..." are misinterpreted and thus not recorded.]*

The divine chamber’s yin essence resides in the Central Palace, abiding in the virtue of Earth and symbolizing the ruler. Like the cauldron’s inner response, it does not act independently. If the ruler grows arrogant and indolent, tribute from the four directions will fail to arrive; if ministers turn treacherous and deceitful, the timing of celestial movements will falter—eclipses, waxing and waning, new and full moons, all omens and misfortunes will be blamed on the ruler. The ruler is the golden essence and Earth’s virtue, the divine chamber itself. Thus, the alchemical maiden flees, the Red Dragon bolts, and the divine essence departs—what gold liquor can then be sought?

The "Pole Star receiving its proper position, at ease and yielding to those below" refers to the divine embryo dwelling in the Central Palace, likening the ruler to the Pole Star in the Bright Hall. The qi of yin and yang and the Five Agents are the ministers. When ruler and ministers govern within as the Pole Star stands at heaven’s center, the qi of yin and yang and the Five Agents harmonize, and the gold and water liquors within the cauldron naturally generate transformations.

Chen Zhixu said: This passage alone clarifies the four—yin, yang, essence, and *qi*. What are they? *Qian* is firm, *Kun* is yielding. The *Yi* says: *Qian* is the yang thing; *Kun* is the yin thing. Yin and yang unite in virtue, and firmness and softness take form, embodying heaven and earth’s design and penetrating the numinous power of the gods. Thus, *Qian*’s virtue is firm, strong, centered, upright, pure, and unadulterated; *Kun*’s virtue is soft, yielding, beneficial, and steadfast—where the noble person’s conduct lies. The union of *Qian* and *Kun* is the Dao of the golden elixir.

Therefore, *Qian*’s yang virtue governs bestowal, while *Kun*’s yin virtue specializes in containment and reception. Male and female rely on each other, depending on essence and *qi*. Essence and *qi* spread and extend. The *Yi* says: Essence and *qi* as things are the wandering soul and transformation. As things, they follow the natural course to generate humans and creatures; as transformation, they reverse their use to achieve Buddhahood or immortality.

What are *Kan* and *Li* at the head? When *Qian*’s firmness interacts with *Kun*, *Qian* becomes hollow within and forms *Li*; when *Kun*’s softness receives *Qian*, *Kun* becomes solid within and forms *Kan*. Thus, *Kan* and *Li* follow *Qian* and *Kun* to head the yin and yang, attaining the proper balance of firmness and softness. *Li*’s center holds the sun’s light; *Kan*’s center holds the moon’s radiance, casting their brilliance below. Profound and subtle, they are difficult to fathom, impossible to depict. Only the sage can measure and assist, narrating their primordial foundation.

What are the four? The primordial chaos—yin, yang, essence, and *qi*—encompassed within the void’s aperture, unfolding as the sixty-four hexagrams to form the chariot. *Kun* is the ox, the chariot; *Qian* is the dragon, the horse. When *Qian* and *Kun* unite in virtue, dragon and horse are harnessed, the world is at peace, and the enlightened ruler governs the times. The golden liquor’s return to cinnabar follows the same Dao—why? The dragon is the wood of the east, mercury; the horse is the cinnabar fire of the south. Dragon and horse obtain the west’s metal tiger to generate the north’s *Xuanwu* water. Thus, essence and *qi* congeal and unite to form the body, completing the harness.

When harmonious, they follow the level path without deviation. The enlightened ruler’s governance is like traveling the great road, not burdening the people. Harmonious *qi* responds to the times. If even slightly off the proper path, or if treacherous ministers obscure the worthy and envy the capable, the state will be imperiled. In cultivation, harmony comes first. When harmonious, all affairs follow the heart’s intent. The *Yi* says: Harmony is *Dui*’s auspicious conduct, without doubt. Once affairs are harmonious, the mind must be rectified, intentions made sincere, and vigilance maintained—then no peril or ruin will occur. Can one not be cautious of even the slightest deviation in the elixir?

The noble person in his chamber... *[The passage "The noble person in his chamber..." to "repeated reversals" is the most critical initial safeguard in entering the chamber, with meticulous refinement of the elixir’s difficulty, and so on.]* The sage uses the noble person as a metaphor. The *Yi*’s striking words say: When the noble person in his chamber speaks well, those a thousand *li* away respond—how much more those nearby? The Dao is fundamentally wordless; without words, how can it be revealed? The wordless are those of virtue, whose speech cannot be careless. How much more so for those who practice the Dao and refine the elixir?

The immortal elder cites the ancient sage’s words and expands upon them: The lord of ten thousand chariots in his nine-layered chamber issues decrees and commands, aligning with yin and yang’s seasons. Seeking the elixir must follow yin and yang’s seasonal nodes—when the first yang returns, store the vessel and await the time, not violating the hexagram’s month. Gathering the medicine must wait for the moon’s appearance: *Zhen*’s birth is the third day’s *geng* emergence; *Zhun*’s *zi* and *shen* are water’s flourishing positions; *Yong*’s *yin* and *xu* are fire’s storage positions. Each of the sixty-four hexagrams has its day—here, only *Zhun* and *Yong* are mentioned as examples. Those unable to exhaustively comprehend are the immortal elder’s admission of incomplete mastery, for the profound mysteries require oral transmission. The scripture says: These are not ordinary words of the world; only the perfected sage who has attained the Way and penetrated the subtle can fully grasp their meaning. Those who cannot exhaustively comprehend lack the innate capacity of the supreme sage—how can they practice this Dao and become perfected?

Establishing laws and punishments prevents deceit; applying benevolence and virtue entices joy. Resistance brings misfortune; compliance brings fortune. Following the regulations, decrees must be issued with utmost sincerity, and actions must be focused and discreet.

Vigilantly awaiting the days and hours: a year depends on one month, a month on one day, a day on one hour, an hour on one tally. Carefully observing the waxing and waning: one must know the water’s clarity and turbidity generated by *Dui*’s metal, its proportions. If even the slightest deviation or impurity occurs, blame and misfortune will harm the elixir crucible. Such errors cause yin and yang to diverge, the solstices to shift—midwinter becomes scorching summer, midsummer turns to bitter frost, the spring and autumn equinoxes lose their balance, day and night’s timekeeping fails, rain and drought go awry, and strange omens multiply. All these portents, like the above misfortunes, are metaphors for a single error in tending the furnace leading to a hundred mistakes, all stemming from insufficient self-cultivation. The foolish do not blame themselves but resent the elixir scriptures. Only those with great roots, a sincere heart, and true remorse, who redouble their efforts with diligence and unwavering focus, will naturally gain celestial aid. In all undertakings, they will succeed.

This is like the filial son whose sincerity moves the imperial pole. The heart is the spirit’s dwelling; when the heart is true, the spirit naturally arrives. Words are the heart’s voice; when words are trustworthy, emotions and nature resonate. Though speech emerges from one’s mouth, its sound spreads far. Failure brings calamity; success brings fortune. Affairs gone awry may lead to war; affairs accomplished bring joy and great peace. Success and failure, order and chaos—all arise from the human heart. In movement and stillness, one must not act recklessly but follow the plumb line. Then the four seasons respond, *qi* seeks its counterpart, firmness and softness harmonize, and the Five Agents align. The Dao of the *Yi* circulates and reverses without discord.

The hidden and submerged, the concealed and secluded—this speaks of the workings of *wu* and *ji*. Here is discussed the Dao of yin and yang, their *qi*: sometimes yin lies hidden within the body, sometimes yang sinks into concealment within the limbs. They transform and reside at the center, enveloping the myriad things, or vigorously bestow life and death to serve as the guiding principles of the Dao. If not for the dual functions of Qian and Kun, the subtle principles of the Dao, the Dao might well be obstructed and cease to flow.

The regulation of being by non-being, the utility of the formless—why do emptiness and being stand as two? The division of the Supreme Polarity yields precelestial and postcelestial. What is precelestial? That which is above form is called the Dao: it enters being from non-being. What is postcelestial? That which is below form is called the vessel: it enters being from non-being.

Laozi said: “The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth; the named is the mother of the myriad things.” Hai Chan said: “From non-being to being is ever thus; from being to non-being, one may guard against it.” By inferring the waxing and waning of Kan and Li, all postcelestial things become vessels—formed, turbid, and subject to arising and perishing. They are not like the precelestial, which possesses the enduring Dao that allows one to ascend to the realm of the sages.

Confucius said: “Preceding heaven, heaven does not oppose; following heaven, one accords with the seasons.” Ordinary people only follow the postcelestial Dao, thus they are born and die in an unending cycle. The sage skillfully employs the precelestial Dao in reverse, hence through extending knowledge, investigating things, rectifying the heart, and cultivating the self, one attains everlasting existence without extinction. Counting what has passed is following; knowing what is to come is reversing. Thus the Dao of the *Yi* is the reversal of numbers.

“Words are not carelessly composed”: Among the books of the various masters and hundred schools, some are skillfully written, others clumsily—what does this matter? This is the ancestral book of the Dao; one must not recklessly insert a single word, lest later generations be misled. This is what is meant by “words are not carelessly composed.”

“Discourses are not idly produced”: The immortal elders modeled themselves on the Three Sages, aligning with yin and yang and emulating the sun and moon. Moreover, they jointly composed this book as a ladder and raft for the world. This is what is meant by “discourses are not idly produced.”

What is meant by “citing verification and seeing effects”? In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor ascended to heaven; Chao and Xu withdrew to the mountains; Laozi transformed the Hu and became a Buddha; in Huainan, even the chickens and dogs became immortals. These are all examples of “citing verification and seeing effects.”

What is meant by “measuring and discerning the numinous”? It is like the sun and moon conjoining as one, their brilliance manifesting in *gengzi*. “Making it numinous and bright depends on the person.” The structuring of graphs—such as *dan* (丹) arising from *yue* (月), the water image of the Kan trigram, and the sun and moon as the head of the *Yi*’s completion of the Dao—this is the structuring of graphs.

What is meant by “tracing principles as evidence”? When yin reaches its extreme, yang arises; when yang reaches its extreme, yin arises. Following yin and yang produces humans and living things; reversing their use necessarily completes the golden elixir. This is the original principle.

Kan *wu* is the essence of the moon: the northern position is Kan, within which lies true earth—this is yang earth. The Woman constellation presides over it, with yin concealed and yang essence. *Wu* serves as its gate, the lunar hub’s domain, where the hornless hare dwells—white within, black without. This is yang within yin, outwardly female yet inwardly male.

Li *ji* is the light of the sun: the southern position is Li, within which lies true earth—this is yin earth. The Willow constellation presides over it, with yang submerged and yin light. *Ji* serves as its door, the solar wheel’s abode, where the three-legged crow resides—black within, white without. This is yin within yang, inwardly female yet outwardly male.

The ancients took the sun and moon as the character *yi* (易), for *yi* is precisely yin and yang. Yet when one speaks of yin and yang, *yi* is not seen; when one speaks of *yi*, yin and yang become visible.

Moreover, without earth, the myriad things cannot sprout and grow, and the sun and moon especially rely on earth to gestate. Thus, when the sun moves east, it passes through Di earth; when it moves west, it passes through Stomach earth; when it travels south, it passes through Willow earth; when it nurtures in the north, it passes through Woman earth. The sun and moon obtain earth and thus endure in brightness; earth borrows the sun and moon to enrich its virtue. The earth’s dominion cycles through the four seasons: spring’s birth and summer’s growth are earth’s work; autumn’s gathering and winter’s closure are earth’s power. Therefore, each of the four seasons has its ruling days, and earth abides at the center, beginning and ending, weaving its functions. Though green, red, white, and black each reside in the east, west, south, and north, they all rely on the two earths of *wu* and *ji* to jointly perfect their virtue and enact numinous transformations.

This speaks of yin and yang’s positions, each residing in its place. All their uses must borrow from earth. There is no talk of dragon and tiger, lead and mercury, or the gathering of golden water. Thus, earlier the text spoke of arranging yin and yang’s paired positions, and later it states that each resides in its own direction—this is the marvelous order of its language.

From the dark moon to the new moon: This section takes the dark and new moons, waxing and full moons of a single month to compare the practice of elixir refinement, where lines and tally marks align. In a year, there are twelve dark and new moons, waxing and full moons. In heaven, the Greater Yin has twelve conjunctions with the sun; in the human realm, the Lesser Yin has twelve conjunctions with the physical form—this is the norm of yin and yang.

Only the Lesser Yin—profound, boundless, and immeasurable—can the sage measure, roaming leisurely within the Supreme Polarity before attempting to align the tally marks and begin the practice at the center. Thus it is called precelestial. Heaven’s Greater Yin each time conjoins with the sun: when the moon is below the sun and the sun above the moon, the moon receives the sun’s essence and light, its light facing heaven, unseen by people. This is like the union of man and woman, the man above and the woman below, the woman covered by the man and thus unseen. At this dark moon, the moon is above the sun, its radiance undivided—comparable to the human realm’s Lesser Yin.

At the time of the Supreme Polarity’s chaos, within the precelestial primordial vastness, when the tally marks are exhausted and the third day’s *geng* arrives, yang is about to be born. Yang male and yin female follow one another, uniting within, their fluids moistening and naturally bestowing transformation, flowing and circulating. Heaven and earth’s numinousness cannot be measured.

As for the great Dao, without the resources of sages and worthies, one cannot put it into motion. The *Yi* says: “Match its virtue with heaven and earth, its brightness with the sun and moon, its sequence with the four seasons, its auspiciousness and inauspiciousness with gods and spirits.” This is the numinous marvel of the golden elixir. Though heaven and earth cannot fathom it, gods and spirits cannot guess its measure—why? The golden elixir is the *qi* of the precelestial. The sage skillfully matches virtue with heaven and earth, reverses the workings of creation to generate this *qi*. The sage can match brightness with the sun and moon, invert the workings to preserve this *qi*. The sage cleverly matches the sequence of the four seasons, employing this *qi* so that cold and heat do not constrain one another. The sage subtly matches the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of gods and spirits to complete this *qi*, so that ghosts and spirits reveal their forms. Thus, even heaven and earth’s numinousness cannot be measured—only the sage is capable.

What does it mean to “utilize it to secure the body and conceal the form”? It is the Dao of Kun. The function of Kun: within Kun’s palace lies earth, which governs Kan water. It is good at benefiting the myriad things without contention—this is the use of water.

The sage, by inverting its use, thereby attains water’s benefit—the *Yi*’s sixfold utility in perpetually upholding steadfastness is Kun’s virtue. It begins in the northeast, in the region of Jidou. What does this mean? Each new moon necessarily conjoins with the sun in the region of Jidou. Jidou belongs to Gen; Gen as a hexagram is yin encroaching upon yang. It is called the “spirit-path.” The moon, whenever it reaches this region, loses its brightness—hence it is said, “losing its companion.” This resembles the worldly cycle of the Five Phases: birth, aging, sickness, death, and the alternation of cold and heat.

When revolving rightward, it is the Way of Heaven: leftward motion. The sun, moon, and stars all revolve rightward. When the moon reaches this region, it must darken and conceal itself, appearing like a jade tablet or a jade scepter. On the first and second days, revolving rightward to the geng direction, its essence and light begin to emerge, and its *po* is born. When the moon reaches the Bi and Mao constellations, the moon borrows the sun’s light, which shines forth below like the initial yang of Qian. Beneath Kun lies the image of Zhen. On the evening of the third day, one yang and two yins—Qian’s eldest son—attains its time and enacts the Way, hence the third day is “Zhen’s movement.” On the eighth day, the upper *kan* is one yin and two yangs—Kun’s youngest daughter, Dui, receives the fire of ding and acts in Kun’s stead to govern the affair. Yin and yang harmonize, and the numinous is born—hence it is said, “on the eighth day, Dui acts.”

At the fifteenth day, it is the full moon, fully yang and radiant—hence it is said, “on the fifteenth, virtue is accomplished, and the Qian body is complete.” This resembles the upper line of the hexagram, akin to the golden elixir within the crucible, where metal and water, the Great Yin, reflect the sun to generate essence and *po*. The human body mirrors the moon to generate the golden elixir. Within the crucible lies the elixir; one must remain vigilant as if facing peril. When full, be cautious of overflow; when abundant, fear decline. Only the sage can maintain vigilance from beginning to end. Xun continues its lineage, firmly securing and carefully nurturing it, slowly circulating the yin tally to envelop the yang qi. Gen governs advance and cessation; when the tally is full, it descends to the lower *kan*, gradually congealing and solidifying. The celestial position is attained with joy. Lead and mercury are drawn forth; when lead is exhausted, mercury is dried. At six-five, Kun receives and binds, encompassing beginning and end. Lead and mercury are both transformed—the golden elixir is complete. Though one month illustrates its practice, the essential work requires ten months to approximate completion. When the work is fulfilled, three years suffice; when the merit is lofty, twelve years are needed. It depends on one’s accumulated practice.

As for the great sage who re-creates yin and yang, aligning emotion with nature, inverting and uniting them to establish a new crucible and forge the Nine Cauldrons’ great elixir—it is like the celestial pivot being re-established at zi. Comparing the twelve lines to a month’s cycle: from darkness to the new moon, the new moon reaches dawn, and the initial yang stirs again in the Fu hexagram. Hence it is said, “Thus, there is no constant position—this is the ancestral root of the *Yi*.”

At the dawn of the new moon, it is Fu, enduring for a thousand ages. The preceding speaks of the moon’s phases from darkness to fullness, illustrating the refinement of the elixir. This section compares it to the twelve months’ work and practice. The initial attainment of the elixir corresponds to the Fu hexagram—Fu is one yang concealed beneath five yins. When sages and worthies practice this Way, they transcend the mundane and enter sagehood; if wicked persons practice it, they lose their lives and forfeit their bodies. Thus, King Wen said: “When companions come, there is no blame. Returning and reversing the Way, in seven days it returns—beneficial to have somewhere to go.” “Companions coming” means companions arriving from afar. “No blame” means benefit without harm. “Returning and reversing the Way” refers to the practice of the *Yi*’s Way—acting in inversion. “In seven days it returns” means the moon conceals its light for seven days before shining again, just like a person. After seven days of movement, yang is initially born—“beneficial to have somewhere to go” means advancing auspiciously without loss. The *Eastern Capital Rhapsody* says, “The sun and moon conceal themselves in Longdou,” referring to yang’s imminent return. Confucius said, “Fu reveals the heart of Heaven and Earth.” The world does not know the heart of Heaven and Earth; Laozi called this heart the “gate of the Mysterious Female.” Master Fang referred to it as the “gate of life” and the “door of death.” The *Yi* says: “Thunder is within the earth—Fu. The former kings, on reaching this day, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not proceed, and the lords did not inspect their domains.” Thunder is the firm yang; earth is the yielding yin. With firm yang within yielding yin, the primordial qi is restored. The former kings, practicing this Way on this day, closed the passes and did not inspect their domains, focusing their minds and dedicating their wills. Merchants and travelers represent miscellaneous distractions; not proceeding means cutting off such distractions to focus solely on the Way. Hence the *Xiang* says: “Not far off is the return—cultivate the self.” It also says: “The one in the middle acts alone in returning—to follow the Way.”

At the dawn of the new moon, it is Fu—the yang qi begins to flow. The sage’s heart is one. Fu means first concealing and then being able to return. The initial qi of yang enters and exits, communicating without harm. Establishing a marker, the subtle firmness—Qian moves directly. The Huangzhong pitch corresponds to the yang month, establishing zi. The masses are the multitude; all things begin to grow with this yang qi, all flourishing and manifest, spreading warmth. The common people, receiving this warmth, return to constancy. The multitude of the common people, receiving the warmth of the initial yang qi, all return to their constant Way. The marvel of elixir-making lies precisely here—do not treat it lightly.

Having received the master’s instructions in the Way, one must understand the Three Passes and Three Signs. Why? First, prepare the altar and platform, then gather the medicinal substances. Once obtained, the substances enter and exit, communicating. After refining, the work becomes gentle and warm, spreading and permeating warmth, penetrating directly—this is the First Pass and First Sign. Approaching and controlling the elixir crucible, applying the firing times, opening the path with intent, neither excessive nor reckless, harmonizing brilliance and light, becoming ever more humble and lowly. The Dalü pitch responds to the chou day, and the light gradually lengthens—this is the Middle Pass and Second Sign.

The Taicu pitch arrives, looking upward to complete Tai. Tai as a hexagram is earth above heaven. If yin is above, water can moisten below; if yang is below, fire can illuminate above. Thus, the *Xiang* of Xian says: “The yielding above and the firm below—these two qi respond and unite, resting in joy. The male descends, the female ascends—hence it is beneficial to be steadfast.” The Five Phases are inverted, and the seven treasures of heaven and earth: the yielding acts first, making others the host; the firm acts afterward, making oneself the guest. The male initially retreats slightly, while the female greatly advances. Metal qi requires each other; when yang is complete, the Qian body is whole. This is called “firm and yielding both flourishing, yin and yang uniting”—this is the Lower Pass and Third Sign.

Gradually passing through Dazhuang, the elixir congeals and returns. Flanking the mao gate, the elm pods return to the root. Punishment and virtue oppose each other; day and night begin to divide. The elixir’s sign falls within the Yellow Court—guard and nurture it with care and focus. Guai as a hexagram is yin deciding and separating; the yang qi has returned. The golden elixir is conceived; Qian is vigorous and radiant. The metal qi is now pure yang. At the end of si, the yin tally circulates. Gou receives and suddenly envelops the yang, preventing its escape. Yang regains yin, and yin becomes the host. Kun’s transformation: the first six, “treading frost,” is the cold spring at the well’s bottom—the yin qi descends. The sixth month is Dun, gathering essence and awaiting the time. Pi arrives in the seventh month—yin and yang do not communicate; yin extends while yang withdraws, the yang qi inwardly bright. The eighth month is Guan, observing the image and assessing autumn’s conditions, nurturing the young and tender. Like wheat sprouts, old and withered, they flourish again; like shepherd’s purse, the sprouts transform. When the qi is exhausted, the form is eroded. When the Way is exhausted, it returns to its origin.

The primal power of Kun moves in cycles of coming and going, ever compliant and receptive to Heaven. This work is composed with profound method: some sections begin with an introductory preface, others conclude with a summarizing closure; those lacking an introduction are encapsulated by their closing remarks, while those without a conclusion are framed by their opening lines. This particular passage, for instance, has no introductory preface but is instead encompassed by its closing summary. Its opening line states: "At the new moon’s dawn, it is Fu; Fu gives rise to Lin, Lin to Tai, Tai to Great Strength, Great Strength to Guai, Guai to Qian, Qian to Gou, Gou to Dun, Dun to Pi, Pi to Guan, Guan to Bo, and Bo to Kun." The conclusion, however, binds it thus: "profoundly obscure and boundlessly distant, yet separated yet interconnected." These two phrases are most succinct.

"Profoundly obscure" and "boundlessly distant" refer to the two entities of yin and yang: the former so profoundly deep as to elude grasp, the latter so immeasurably far as to defy conception. Yet their transformative efficacy is such that, though Heaven and Earth are sundered by vast distance, they remain linked as one. Between these two entities lies an interval—spanning myriad leagues in an instant—yet if the Yellow Matchmaker mediates their union, even the most distant becomes proximate. Thus, when these two entities align with the celestial measures, they nurture life and become the primal sages of yin and yang. The sage employs them to enact the Dao, though its vastness and elusiveness render it seemingly beyond grasp.

Those who first lose the track and later become sovereign lords do so through yielding compliance, smooth progress, and steadfast integrity—such is the path the noble person follows. First straying from the Way, then attaining constancy: these are the words of the Ten Wings. The immortal elder elaborates upon this, noting that yin becomes the host, and later, "becomes the sovereign lord"—both are the advantageous terrain of Kun, the Way of Earth.

There is no level ground without a slope: this is the natural principle of the Dao. Water, in its utmost levelness, pools to form a deep abyss; at the sloping banks, it does not flow. Yet if the slope is filled to its brim, the water naturally overflows. This analogy of water elucidates the natural principle of the Dao: transformation and renewal ever flourish, returning to Qian in due course. The waxing and waning follow one another, as Gou gives way to Kun. Thus it is said: "Kun ends and Fu begins," like tracing an unbroken ring.

If emperors and kings could uphold and govern the Dao of Qian and Kun, both in its reversal and compliance, then a lifespan of a thousand years would not be excessive. Should their merit tower and conduct shine, ascending to Heaven in broad daylight would be but their due. The foremost task of governance is to ensure the realm suffers no harm through the Dao. The immortal elder, using the difficulty of refining the elixir as a metaphor for governance, reveals the arduousness of quelling a rebellious populace. Just as refining the elixir makes one aware of the difficulty in tethering the "horse of the mind," so too does governance require shedding old stains and worldly defilements to renew all things—this is the primacy of governance. This is called "renewing the cauldron."

To curb anger and restrain desire, to emulate goodness and cultivate improvement—these are the foundations of self-cultivation.

This is called "transforming the old." Whether in governance or self-cultivation, one must first begin with oneself, exercising the utmost vigilance and meticulousness. By first regulating and thoroughly ordering oneself, governance will succeed and the body will be perfected. Confucius said: "Govern through virtue, and you will be like the North Star, abiding in its place while all other stars pay homage." Virtue is not merely a matter of governance—it is the source of all conduct. Can those who refine the elixir be without virtue?

What, then, is virtue? Benevolence, compassion, and love; clarity and sincerity—these are the marks of one of supreme virtue. Reverence, magnanimity, trustworthiness, diligence, and kindness—these are the gates to entering the Dao. For those who wish to refine the elixir, kindness and diligence must come first. Kindness suffices to employ others, and the immortal elder says: "To unfold and distribute treasure is to win the people’s joy externally while preserving one’s true qi internally." This is the foremost handle of the essential Dao.

If one repeatedly distributes treasure, one can unify and transform the fundamental principles. The "fundamental principles" are the masters of enforcing the law. When governance is skillfully unified and transformed, those who enforce the law will not find it burdensome. Just as when the lines of a hexagram move internally, fortune and misfortune manifest externally—this is akin to the five planets moving in disarray or harmony, with fortune and misfortune responding in due time. The same principle applies to *chǐ* and *lí*: *chǐ* means to alter, while *lí* means to shift or move.

The twenty-eight constellations, when in disarray, all bow and rise in accordance with the Literary Star of Great Vigilance, which is the chief star within the *Kui* constellation. The six stars of the Southern Dipper, known as the "Star of Unification," govern the Vermilion Bird’s spirit in the human body and record one’s name in the register of long life. The star of empty essence is the guiding principle of the Three Terraces, while the star that records and unifies is the leader of the Three Terraces. In the human body, it governs the Hall of Light and unfolds the virtue that enlightens the world. The *Dongfang Mingguang* star is the Purple Palace’s assistant, the two stars of the August Emperor. In the human body, they are the spirit of the Dark Warrior. If one encounters them, one’s lifespan may reach a thousand years. The remaining countless spirits and deities each preside over their respective domains.

Refining the elixir is a matter intimately tied to the workings of creation, and thus it is even more difficult than governance. To trace things back to their origin and grasp their end: by investigating the beginning, one can achieve enduring existence; by grasping the end, one can avoid perishing. The ruler is the heart; the ministers are the body.

The heart is the self; the body is the external world. If the self’s heart grows arrogant or self-satisfied, or if the body and external world contend against one another, refusing to follow the proper order, then the celestial patterns will deviate, fortunes will shift between fullness and decline, and misfortune will arise. Those who uphold the law will then reproach and question the ruler’s faults.

The *Chenji* is the aforementioned *Wenchang* star, also called the *Nanji Chenji*. It governs with rectitude, moving with ease while entrusting matters to its subordinates. The *Hall of Light* is the *Taifu*, diligently enacting good governance to ensure the state remains free from disorder. The state, too, is a body. When the body is at peace and its *qi* harmonious, the Dao is unharmed.

This passage illustrates that cultivating the self and refining the elixir is akin to a ruler governing the state: if the right people are chosen and proper policies enacted, the realm will be at peace. If one cultivates the self, exhausts the heart, and establishes destiny, the elixir path will be accomplished.

Yu Yan said: The *Zhengyi* states that when a person breathes, the interplay of hardness and softness mirrors the opening and closing of Heaven and Earth. When refining the elixir, the dry *yang* descends to unite with the *yin* of *Kun*, allowing breath to intermingle, hardness and softness to balance, and husband and wife to become one. Then, spirit and *qi* return to their root, nature and life merge, and the supreme medicine is produced.

The mutual dependence of endowment and reception is the principle of union. Heaven and Earth generate beings through the union of *yin* and *yang*; the elixir method produces medicine through the same union. The transformations within the human body correspond to those of Heaven and Earth—no creation can occur without union. If one can empty the heart and concentrate the spirit, aligning with the mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, then the workings of creation lie within one’s grasp.

*Kan* and *Li* are the sun and moon. When the sun and moon illuminate Heaven and Earth, the conch and clam absorb their light to produce pearls, and stubborn stones store it to become jade. How much more so for the human body, which possesses its own sun and moon—can it not reflect the light inward to form true pearls and yield true jade?

Yet this is but the external world—silent and vast, unfathomable, impossible to depict or plan. Only the heart can know it, the mind can conceive it. This is why the sages employ broad analogies and layered metaphors to expound the primordial foundation of the golden elixir, and why the *Cantong Qi* takes the *Yi* as its standard.

When *Qian*, *Kun*, *Kan*, and *Li* unite as one, spirit and *qi* return to their root, profound and subtle, beyond comprehension. Using *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible and *Kan* and *Li* as the medicinal ingredients, the remaining sixty hexagrams—from *Zhun* and *Meng* to *Jiji* and *Weiji*—are arranged around the crucible as the *zhou tian* fire phases. Thus, all sixty hexagrams serve one’s purpose, and the dragon and horse submit to one’s control.

The body is like the state; the heart is like the ruler.

When the heart is settled, spirit congeals and *qi* harmonizes; the Three Palaces naturally ascend and descend, and the hundred vessels flow unimpeded. Thus, in the moment of elixir-making, there is no other path—only empty the heart, still the breath, and concentrate the spirit to enter the *qi*-cavern, following its ebb and flow with unbroken continuity. Over time, spirit will naturally congeal, breath will naturally settle, breath settled and *qi* gathers, *qi* gathered and the elixir forms. There is no need for massage, guiding and pulling, exhalation and inhalation, or meditative visualization—these are all heterodox ways.

The noble one dwells in his chamber, yet *Kan* and *Li* vanish without trace. The lord, exalted within the ninefold palace, speaks a word of goodness, and a thousand *li* away it is answered. The cultivator, containing his light and dwelling in silence, turns his reflection inward. When emptiness reaches its extreme and stillness its depth, the *qi* of Heaven and Earth naturally comes to him—this is the principle of mutual resonance and response.

The ancient sage-kings, in the first month of spring, commanded their ministers to spread virtue and harmonize decrees; in the first month of autumn, they ordered generals to select soldiers and sharpen weapons—all in accord with the seasons and the rhythms of Heaven and Earth’s yin and yang. The method of elixir refinement must first recognize the proper time, and even more, await its arrival. If the time has not yet come, one can only contain their light, dwell in silence, and wait with emptiness—never forcing it prematurely.

The hours of *zi*, *shen*, *yin*, and *xu*—like *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you*—are all allegorical. Viewed through the sixty hexagrams, beginning with *Zhun* and ending with *Weiji*, yin and yang lines interweave and alternate. Though each differs, with opposing and corresponding bodies, every hexagram has its own resonance—truly, hexagram by hexagram, all are the same. If the scholar observes the two images of *Zhun* and grasps their pattern, they may extend this insight to silently comprehend the meanings of all hexagrams.

The West represents righteousness, the East benevolence. Punishment governs execution and subjugation, thus forging the lead of the West. Virtue governs generation and arousal, thus refining the mercury of the East. Lead belongs to metal, its nature utterly firm, concealed within *Kan*—without fierce firing and extreme forging, it cannot ascend. Thus, the martial fire is used to compel it, but the civil fire must not be applied. Mercury belongs to wood, its nature utterly yielding, concealed within *Li*—upon encountering true lead, it naturally stills. Thus, the civil fire is used to refine it, but the martial fire must not be applied. These two operations, when followed, bring fortune; when reversed, they bring misfortune. In drawing and circulating, one must guard against danger—even the slightest deviation is impermissible. Proceeding naturally brings fortune; forcing it in reverse brings misfortune. Therefore, one must follow the almanac to know the oral instructions for the proper moment. With utmost sincerity and unwavering focus, without the slightest stray thought, Heaven and Earth’s waxing and waning correspond to the ebb and flow of time. The human body models itself on Heaven and mirrors Earth—its blood and *qi* wax and wane in perfect accord with Heaven and Earth. Thus, the elixir method takes Heaven as the crucible, Earth as the furnace, the moon as the medicinal agent (its waxing and waning dictating the timing of gathering), and the sun as the fire’s rhythm (its rising and setting determining movement and stillness). Every act of drawing, circulating, bathing, and conjoining follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth—this is why it is called the Supreme Way. To seek other methods is but a side door, a petty art, the mere conjecture of idle speculation.

The so-called "fire" is not the fire of visualization, but the body’s innate true fire. The so-called "timing" is not the timing of hours and minutes, but the body’s innate *qi*-rhythms. Fire’s nature flares when met with the wind of *Xun*, and hides when met with the earth of *Kun*. Its use must neither exceed nor fall short—all depends on regulating its civil and martial aspects, discerning its warmth and coolness, ensuring balance. Then, great and small suffer no harm, both realms remain whole, and in an instant, the elixir’s first signs appear. This is what is meant by "harmonizing and circulating."

If even the slightest deviation occurs, the solstices shift their positions between north and south, the equinoxes diverge between east and west. Midwinter transforms into scorching summer, midsummer flips into sleet and snow—and lead and mercury scatter, a host of anomalies erupting. The human body takes *Qian* and *Kun* as father and mother, with the Six Children operating between them, moving up and down, ever obedient to their parents. Thus, they are called "filial children." The Imperial Ultimate is the central, upright position, the place to which the eight directions converge. If the filial child applies their heart and moves it, the tiger roars once, the dragon emerges from its cave, phoenixes dance and simurghs soar, entering the golden city. But if their actions are rebellious and discordant, failing to align with the Ultimate, the dark pearl scatters, the numinous mercury flees, and the Six Children become not filial children but rebels against the elixir path.

When medicine is present and fire phases are applied, metal, pressed by fire, surges and ascends to the *Li* Palace, transforming into water, which in turn restrains fire—thus fire is spared the disaster of flaring upward. But without medicine, applying fire only drives the empty yang to attack upward, burning the body itself—this is how fortune and misfortune diverge. True yang is born in the *Kan* Palace, turbid and unmoving. To capture and restrain *Li*’s true mercury, one must use the martial fire for fierce forging and extreme firing, enabling it to ascend. Once it reaches the *Li* Palace and conjoins with true mercury, one should guard the city and bathe—fire must no longer be added. This is the stark difference between peace and upheaval.

These four principles—where do they come from? They arise from returning to the heart alone. When still and unmoving, returning to the root and restoring stillness—this is the time of *Kun*. I then wait in stillness. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement stirs, yang *qi* secretly germinates—this is the time of *Fu*. I then move in response. This is the constant method. Otherwise, if one practices in the morning and abandons it by evening, it is not wholehearted devotion. When movement is called for, stillness is mixed in; when stillness is called for, movement interrupts. Sometimes one forces progress prematurely, sometimes one forgets and loses the proper sequence. Such movement is merely the movement of circulating *qi*; such stillness is merely the stillness of dhyāna. How can this be called following the method and adhering to the rule?

When applying effort, the four seasons must be skillfully harmonized and followed according to their proper times. Then warmth, coolness, cold, and heat each find their place, and hardness and softness are decisively distinguished. They do not encroach upon one another: when yang’s hardness is at work, the mind’s intent remains below, never encroaching above; when yin’s softness is at work, the mind’s intent remains above, never encroaching below.

The *Wang Liang* and *Qi Tian Tong Jing Song* say: "Metal, wood, center, water, fire—these five guard the single elixir field." When these five scatter, the whole body becomes *qi*; when they gather, the elixir field forms a treasure. Now, if one steadfastly and single-mindedly guards the elixir field without reckless expansion or contraction, they will blend and fuse, transforming into a single *qi*, congealing into golden liquid. Expansion is excess; contraction is insufficiency. Excess harms things; insufficiency fails to generate them. Only when one maintains unbroken continuity, as if present, and guards it with intention—over time, when the moment arrives and *qi* transforms, the crucible fills and must overflow, and the numinous and bright will naturally come.

The *Yi* speaks of the sun and moon. The sun and moon traverse the Yellow Way, circulating day and night in ceaseless revolution, cycling and returning without end. The human body—head and trunk as *qian*, abdomen as *kun*—resembles heaven and earth. Its two *qi* ascend and descend just like the sun and moon. Thus, one emulates the function of the sun and moon to achieve the same work as heaven and earth. The essential lies in unblocking the *Ren* and *Du* meridians. These two meridians are the sea of yin and yang for the entire body, the mechanism and barrier of the five *qi* and true origin.

The *Ren* meridian arises below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the inner abdomen up to *Guanyuan*, reaches the throat, and belongs to the sea of yin meridians. The *Du* meridian arises from the *Xiaji* point, runs alongside the spine, ascends to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, reaches the crown, follows the forehead to the bridge of the nose, and belongs to the sea of yang meridians. It is called the *Ren* meridian because women rely on it for conception and nourishment. It is called the *Du* meridian because it governs and leads the sea of meridians. If one can unblock these two meridians, all meridians will flow freely, naturally circulating throughout the body without stagnation or obstruction, and the Dao of longevity and enduring vision is decisively here.

Those who dwell in obscurity and concealment allow spirit to enter *qi*, *qi* to enter the navel, and sink to return to the sea’s depths. Those who transform within wait for the time when *qi* naturally transforms; when stillness reaches its limit, the mechanism spontaneously activates, and the sun emerges from within. The mother of the golden elixir is nothing but the primordial singular *qi*. Split into two, divided into three, scattered into the myriad things—all arise from this singular *qi*. Thus it is said: "It enfolds the ten thousand things as the guiding principle of the Dao."

The *Daodejing* states: "Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the center’s emptiness that makes the cart useful. Clay is shaped into a vessel; it is the hollow within that makes the vessel useful. Doors and windows are cut to make a room; it is the emptiness within that makes the room useful." These three are metaphors for the function of the void. Thus it is said: "Existence provides the advantage; nonexistence provides the function." Carts, vessels, and rooms are all tangible things with practical uses, yet what makes them carts, vessels, and rooms is the function of their emptiness.

Now, Master Wei speaks of using the void to control the existent, employing emptiness as the vessel’s function—this is Laozi’s teaching. In elixir methods, the Great Void serves as the crucible and furnace, and within the Great Void, there is naturally a wondrous function. *Guanyinzi* says: "Shaking clothes in emptiness yields wind; exhaling on things yields fire." Chen Baoyi’s commentary states: "Knowing that shaking emptiness yields wind, one can drum the bellows to generate *qi*. Knowing that exhaling on things yields fire, one can refine one’s *qi* into essence." If one is ignorant of this and seeks elsewhere for the crucible and vessel, it is not the Dao of emptiness and nothingness.

*Xi* (rest) is the sign for advancing fire, as *kun* transforms thrice into *qian*. *Xiao* (dissolution) is the sign for withdrawing the tally, as *qian* transforms thrice into *kun*.

From the first day of the lunar month when the *Zhen* trigram governs, passing through *Dui* to *Qian*, and from the full moon when the *Xun* trigram governs, passing through *Gen* to *Kun*—in this interval, the positions of *Kan* and *Li* are not seen. Is this what is meant by the disappearance of *Kan* and *Li*? No, *Kan* and *Li* have not disappeared; they move within the Six Voids, coming and going without fixed abode.

The words here are not carelessly fabricated. Wei Gong himself stated that he composed this book to reveal the secrets of this Dao, refusing to fabricate baseless words to deceive later generations. All his explanations are drawn from verified effects and personal, authentic attainment. Fearing his teachings might not suffice to convince posterity, he further calibrated the numinous movements of the sun and moon as a method and traced the principles of the *Yi* trigrams as evidence. Truly, he labored diligently for others.

*Kan* is yin without and yang within—this is the image of the moon. *Li* is yang without and yin within—this is the image of the sun. *Kan* receives *wu* (戊), the yang earth; *Li* receives *ji* (己), the yin earth. When the two earths unite, yin and yang harmonize, hardness and softness balance—just as the characters for "sun" (日) and "moon" (月) combine to form the character for "change" (易). Green, red, white, and black correspond to wood, fire, metal, and water, each occupying one direction, while earth resides at the center, dividing its vigor among *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*, weaving through the beginning and end of the year. Thus, wood draws its flourishing from earth, fire its waning, metal its birth, and water its cessation—all depend on its power.

This earth pervades the universe, having no fixed position: in *Kan*, it is *wu* earth; in *Li*, it is *ji* earth; in the Central Palace, it is *wu-ji* earth; in the four seasons, it is *chen-xu-chou-wei* earth—all the same substance. Without the true earth to harmonize them, yin and yang would be blocked, hardness and softness divided, and the elixir could not form. As the *Wuzhen Pian* says: "The Four Symbols and Five Phases rely entirely on earth." How critical this is!

Between the dark moon and the new moon—this is the time of transformation and circulation. In elixir methods, where months are reckoned as days, this corresponds to the transition between *hai* and *zi* each day. Within the human body, yin and yang converge at this moment. If one practices the elixir at this time, the inner truth and outer response align like tallying tokens, neither early nor late, precisely at the center—this is the supreme wonder of heaven, earth, and humanity.

Before the primordial *qi* divides, there is chaos; when yin and yang mingle, they follow one another. In elixir terms, this is the state of utter stillness, where spirit congeals and *qi* gathers, unaware of the world’s existence, of one’s own body, of heaven as canopy or earth as carriage. All concerns vanish, and the Dao is one. After a while, the Three Palaces fill with *qi*, the mechanism stirs, and the flute sounds—with one sword-stroke, chaos is split open; with two hands, the primal mist is torn apart. This is called "generating being from non-being." The immortals’ refinement consists solely of gathering the primordial *qi* to serve as the mother of the golden elixir. "Gathering" means gathering without gathering; "taking" means taking without taking—all is attained within stillness and quiescence, without the slightest thought intruding.

Before the Supreme Ultimate divides and yin and yang separate, this is the primordial state before heaven and earth. In elixir terms, this is the moment of returning to the root and restoring stillness. When utterly still, the mind communes with heaven, and the workings of creation may be seized. The *Cuixu Pian* says: "Do not seek the workings of creation in the kidneys; rather, seek the primordial in the heart." Formerly, the Yellow Emperor lost his mysterious pearl and sent Li Zhu and Qi Gou to search for it, but they could not find it. Only Xuan Xiang obtained it—Xuan Xiang means "forgetting form." Only by forgetting form can the primordial *qi* be regained. The *Huánjīn Piān* says: "Where ghosts and spirits do not see, dragon and tiger surely meet." This is profoundly clear.

When the time arrives and *qi* transforms, yin and yang interact—this is the heaven and earth within the body, the intertwining of male and female within. Suddenly, the fire-wheel scorches the earthly veins, the spirit surges in astonishment, and the mountain springs gush forth. Between heaven and earth, all is moistened and greatly abundant. Without personal, authentic attainment, how could one know such true scenery exists?

The numinous brightness of heaven and earth cannot be measured. When yin and yang unite, the spirit and *sha* conceal themselves—this is the numinous moment of heaven and earth. When dragon and tiger merge, the *gui* spirit is unaware—this is the numinous moment of one’s body. Aligning the numinous spirit of one’s body with that of heaven and earth, the inner truth and outer response coincide. At the *Xun* gate, in the midst of stillness, both sides ascend and unite as one. If this could be attained through contemplation, calculation, or measurement, it would not be called the numinous.

"Exploiting the use to secure the body" and "waging virtue in the wild"—in elixir methods, where months are reckoned as days, this occurs at midnight, at the transition between *Kun* and *Fu*. Cross the legs, sit upright and unmoving as a mountain stone, seal the mouth and restrain the breath like a hibernating snake—this is "exploiting the use to secure the body" and concealing the form. At this time, contain the light, silently reflect inward, and let the breath return gently to the life-stem. After a while, one feels profound and indistinct, as if facing an unfathomable abyss—this is the moment when spirit and *qi* return to the root, body and mind revert to destiny, and the golden liquid congeals.

The fire-timing of elixir refinement mirrors the waxing and waning of the moon. On the third day of the month, the moon begins to brighten, starting in the northeast, in the region of *Ji* and *Dou*, then turning right until evening, when it rises like a wheel, sprouting in the southwest, above *Mao* and *Bi*. This image corresponds to *Zhen*; in terms of the *Qian* hexagram, it aligns with the first nine. This illustrates the initial stirring of the yang fire within the body. On the eighth day of the month, the moon’s light is half-bright, corresponding to *Dui*; in terms of *Qian*, it aligns with the second nine, illustrating the halfway point of the yang fire’s work. On the fifteenth day, the moon is full, its spirit abundant and light complete, corresponding to *Qian*; in terms of *Qian*, it aligns with the third nine, illustrating the fullness of the yang fire. On the sixteenth day, the moon begins to wane, corresponding to *Xun*; in terms of *Qian*, it aligns with the fourth nine, illustrating the beginning of the yin tally’s succession. On the twenty-third day, the moon’s light is half-diminished, corresponding to *Gen*; in terms of *Qian*, it aligns with the fifth nine, illustrating the halfway point of the yin tally’s work. On the thirtieth day, the light vanishes entirely, corresponding to *Kun*; in terms of *Qian*, it aligns with the top nine, illustrating the conclusion of the yin tally.

Wei Gong used the six trigrams to illustrate the fire-timing, matching them to the six lines of *Qian*, for the elixir is a treasure of pure yang, and *Qian* is the hexagram of pure yang.

Within the six trigrams, *Qian* is called the "nine in the third place," where vigilance at dusk guards against loss and the divine tally’s fracture; *Kun* is called the "nine at the top," where the dragon battles virtue in the wild. For in defending the city with *Qian*, civil strategy is employed, while in field combat with *Kun*, martial force is wielded—both demand vigilance against peril and foresight of danger.

The "Use of Nine" soars as the ancestral principle of the *Yijing*, for nine is the culmination of yang numbers. The elixir Way models itself on *Qian* and returns to pure yang, thus the "Use of Nine" also illustrates the nine revolutions of the fire-timing within the crucible. Each line of the fire-timing, once traversed, gives way to the next, without the slightest deviation—this is the compass and square of the Dao, ceaselessly renewed.

Metal’s nature and wood’s disposition are one thing divided into two, separated east and west. Yet if the Dipper’s handle is grasped to turn the mechanism, wood’s nature will yearn for metal, and metal’s nature will long for wood. With *Kan* and *Li* ascending and descending, metal and wood naturally cease to be divided.

The immortal’s returning elixir is the *Yijing* within the body; the nine revolutions of the fire-timing are the *Qian* within the body. The Dao circulates throughout the self—no line can be observed, no image or number sought. You may pursue it yet not see its head; follow it yet not see its tail. How could it possess form or substance to be perceived?

Only when heaven moves in concealment does heaven move, and when earth moves in concealment does earth move. The six lines shift and transform—these are the six lines of *Qian*. From this, extension and contact generate the sixty-four hexagrams, all tracing their ancestry here. Gradually, the great is traversed.

When *Dazhuang* reaches its peak, day and night first divide—*Dazhuang* is the hexagram of four yang lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Jiazhong*; in a day, it is dawn at *mao*; in a month, it spans from the eighth to the eleventh day; in a year, it is the month when *mao* is established. At this time, yin assists yang, and qi gathers to bring forth things. This illustrates that within the body, the yang fire is halfway complete, and the qi-timing is balanced. Thus, it is said that punishment and virtue carry each other, and day and night first divide. Yet all things should be sprouting in spring—why do the elm pods fall at this time? It is because yang contains yin.

*Guai* is when yin retreats and yang ascends, washing and cleansing the wings to shake off the dust of the past—*Guai* is the hexagram of five yang lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Guxi*; in a day, it is the *chen* hour of the morning meal; in a month, it spans from the eleventh to the thirteenth day; in a year, it is the month when *chen* is established. At this time, yang qi is already abundant, pressing near the edge of heaven. This illustrates that within the body, the yang fire ascends. Thus, it is said that yang ascends forward, and it is also said to wash and cleanse the wings, shaking off the dust of the past—like the great roc about to migrate to the celestial pond, striking the water to rise, its momentum must be vigorous.

*Qian* is strong and flourishing, its brightness spreading to the four neighbors—*Qian* is the hexagram of six yang lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Zhonglü*; in a day, it is the *si* hour of mid-morning; in a month, it spans from the thirteenth to the fifteenth day; in a year, it is the month when *si* is established. At this time, yang qi is at its peak, pervading the universe. This illustrates that within the body, the yang fire is complete, and the radiance of the elixir appears. The spirit of the head disperses into four streams, pouring into the mountains below, governing a nation without omission. Thus, it is said to spread to the four neighbors, and it is also said that yang ends at the center of *si* and interacts with *Gan*—here, the count of yang fire is complete, and the yin tally begins its work.

*Gou* begins to weave the threads, treading frost first—*Gou* is the hexagram of one yin line, where yin is the master. Its musical note corresponds to *Rui Bin*; in a day, it is noon at *wu*; in a month, it spans from the sixteenth to the eighteenth day; in a year, it is the month when *wu* is established. At this time, yin qi first arises, illustrating the ground where the yin tally begins within the body. Once the numinous elixir enters the mouth and returns, it re-enters the cold spring. One must gently guide it back to the cinnabar field, not rushing or hastening. Thus, it is said to tread frost first, the cold spring at the well’s bottom. It is also said that the guest serves yin, for yin is the master—here, one yin takes charge, and the many yang become guests. *Bin* means respect, a warning to guard against danger and consider risks.

*Dun* retreats from worldly position, gathering its essence and cherishing virtue, awaiting the time in secluded obscurity—*Dun* is the hexagram of two yin lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Linzhong*; in a day, it is the *wei* hour of dusk; in a month, it spans from the eighteenth to the twenty-first day; in a year, it is the month when *wei* is established. At this time, yin qi gradually grows, illustrating that within the body, the yin tally departs from the *wu* position, gathering and descending—like a worthy one retreating to a secluded valley. Thus, it is said to cherish virtue and dwell in seclusion.

*Pi* is blocked and impassable, leading to the ruin of name and reputation—*Pi* is the hexagram of three yin lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Yize*; in a day, it is the *shen* hour of the afternoon meal; in a month, it spans from the twenty-first to the twenty-third day; in a year, it is the month when *shen* is established. At this time, yang qi gradually wanes, illustrating that within the body, the yin tally descends further—like the three yin lines in the season of withering, when grasses and trees yellow and fall. Thus, it is said that yin stretches and yang bends, ruining name and reputation.

*Guan* weighs the scales, examining the sentiments of mid-autumn—*Guan* is the hexagram of four yin lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Nanlü*; in a day, it is dusk at *you*; in a month, it spans from the twenty-third to the twenty-fifth day; in a year, it is the month when *you* is established. At this time, yin assists yang’s work, and all things contract and mature. This illustrates that within the body, the yin tally is more than halfway descended, entering the cinnabar field—like trees withdrawing their blossoms to bear fruit. Thus, it is said to nurture the tender and young. Yet why do all things wither in autumn, while shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout at this time? It is because yin contains yang.

*Bo* rots the limbs, leading to the loss of the numinous—*Bo* is the hexagram of five yin lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Wuyi*; in a day, it is twilight at *xu*; in a month, it spans from the twenty-sixth to the twenty-eighth day; in a year, it is the month when *xu* is established. At this time, yang qi declines and perishes; the fruits on the branches all rot and fall to the ground. This illustrates that within the body, the yin tally is nearly exhausted, and the spirit’s work has nowhere to manifest. Thus, it is said that the transforming qi is spent, and the numinous is lost.

When the Dao is exhausted, it returns to *Kun Yuan*—*Kun* is the hexagram of six yin lines. Its musical note corresponds to *Yingzhong*; in a day, it is the *hai* hour of human rest; in a month, it spans from the twenty-eighth to the thirty-first day; in a year, it is the month when *hai* is established. At this time, pure yin takes charge, and all things return to their roots to renew their lives. This illustrates that within the body, when the yin tally is exhausted, it becomes still and motionless, returning to the origin and restoring tranquility. In this state, yin and yang interact no differently than in heaven and earth. Heaven’s qi descends to earth, and the things born within earth are all heaven’s qi. This is what is meant by returning the spirit to qi—the inner elixir’s Dao naturally completes itself. Between *hai* and *zi*, at the boundary of yin and yang, when the six yin lines are exhausted and the one yang has yet to arise, in this silence and emptiness, the immortal forges the elixir. Blocking *dui* and lowering the curtain, the spirit’s light shines downward into the *kan* palace. At first, it is dim and guarded, like the moon submerged in a cold pond. Then, spirit and qi unite, barriers silently dissolve—like a magnet drawing iron.

When forging the elixir, it is like the *hai* month: though the work is secret and hidden, the year’s nurturing begins its gestation here. When the night’s qi is not yet scattered, one gathers the spirit and collects the qi, sitting upright for a moment. Soon, spirit and qi return to the root, naturally giving birth to being from non-being. Gradually, they condense and accumulate, forming a measure of golden essence. At this time of the body and heart’s renewal, the spirit enters the vastness, becoming one with the great void. After long stillness, when the flower of the heart blooms, the three palaces fill with qi. One feels only a trance-like obscurity, not knowing how it comes to be. Then, in an instant, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born; stillness reaches its limit and the mechanism stirs. The gates of the face open wide, the empty sky shatters, and a burst of radiance breaks the silence, placing the power of transformation in one’s hands.

This chapter clearly reveals the source of the medicine’s production, thoroughly discussing the secrets of existence and non-existence, host and guest, before and after. There is no level ground that does not slope, no slope that does not return—this is the natural Dao. The elixir’s method, where stillness reaches its limit and moves, and movement reaches its limit and stills, with each movement and stillness mutually rooting the other, also arises from nature. The golden elixir is the *Yijing* within the body, where flourishing and decline alternate without end, and change is never obstructed. Thus, it is said that flourishing and decline follow one another; yang begins at *Fu* and ends at *Kun*, with head and tail connected. Thus, it is said that beginning and end form a ring. Those who study the Dao, working diligently all day in step with the times, may endure for a thousand years and remain eternal.

At the helm of governance—when the first yang stirs to forge the elixir—it is as when a sovereign takes the throne to govern. Renewing the old and reforming the obsolete, with no embellishment, the adept seals every aperture with vigilant care: the eyes enfold their light, the ears condense their resonance, the nose regulates its breath, the tongue seals its qi, the legs cross in stillness, and the body sits upright, the spirit withdrawn in inner guard—no thought turned outward even for an instant.

For when the eyes do not see, the *hun*-soul naturally returns to the liver and does not leak through the eyes; when the ears do not hear, the essence naturally returns to the kidneys and does not leak through the ears; when the tongue makes no sound, the spirit naturally returns to the heart and does not leak through the mouth; when the nose detects no scent, the *po*-soul naturally returns to the lungs and does not leak through the nose; when the four limbs do not move, the intent naturally returns to the spleen and does not leak through the limbs’ pores. With these five unbreached, essence, spirit, *hun*, *po*, and intent merge and fuse, transmuting into a single qi that gathers in the cinnabar field, congealing into the supreme treasure.

The crux of the elixir’s method lies entirely in the Dipper, which steers the yin and yang of the entire body and governs the myriad transformations within, just as the rope draws the net or the clasp fastens the garment. The three fields of the human body are divided in three locations; when the Dipper’s handle turns to steer them, true qi circulates up and down like the flowing of the Celestial River—this is called the essential Dao.

When the hexagram’s lines stir within, the first yang arises within the body—this is the moment of receiving qi. Though easily attained, at this instant one must act, for fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement, and not a hair’s breadth of deviation is permissible. The five phases must be gathered, metal and fire must share the same crucible—all hinges on a single thought’s return to the source. Otherwise, the constellations within the crucible will all be misaligned, and heaven and earth will stand far apart.

How well Lü Chunyang, the Old Immortal, said: “When water and fire are evenly balanced, the medicine is formed; when yin and yang are askew, the elixir fails—beware!” The *Records of the Grand Historian: Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states that the six stars of the Dipper’s bowl form the Palace of Literary Flourishing, and there are also the Three Terraces and Four Assistants, around which the stars of the celestial divisions revolve. Within the human body, the central palace is the sovereign who governs heaven and earth, and there are also the Three Dragons, Four Tigers, and the myriad hexagrams of the fire tally—let none neglect the cyclical signs: let *jia* and *yi* not lose *geng* and *xin*, and let no deviation occur.

The canonical departments regulate the twenty-four solar terms, arranging the twenty-eight lunar lodges across the celestial circuit, while the crucible’s fire times are meticulously calibrated. The beginning is the new moon, the end the dark moon.

The thread of preservation and dissolution lies within the dark and new moons—yin nears its end yet remains unfinished, yang approaches its birth yet has not yet arisen. Within this interval, the withdrawal and advance, the bathing and conjoining, must not err even slightly, for preservation and dissolution hinge upon this most profound and mysterious continuity.

The sovereign is the spirit; the minister is the qi. When forging the elixir, lead and mercury return to the earthen crucible, while body and mind remain still and unmoving. If the body stirs, qi scatters; if the mind stirs, spirit scatters. Only by congealing the spirit and gathering the qi, with mind and breath interdependent, may the numinous embryo be formed. Otherwise, the celestial luminance within the body will wax and wane in discord, bringing misfortune and calamity.

Tracing the cause, it arises from the mind’s indulgence and deviation from the Dao, whereupon qi turns devious and perverse, moving contrary to its proper course—thus it too suffers reproach. The *Fu Ming* chapter states: "Drive back the Northern Dipper, turn the celestial net; grasp the Southern Culmen, enter the chamber of depths." One may see that at the pole of the celestial pivot, its majesty resides in the moment of containing radiance and silent stillness, continuous yet as if present, allowing it to unfold naturally—one must not weary the spirit.

The *Treatise on the Celestial Offices* states: "The Eastern Palace’s Azure Dragon includes the Chamber and Heart constellations; the Heart is the Hall of Light." The *Yellow Court Classic* says: "The Hall of Light, the Golden Casket, the Purple Chamber—where are they? Between the brows, whence radiance descends to illuminate, just as the sovereign sits in the Hall of Light to govern and extend the Dao to the nine barbarians and eight wild tribes."

**Middle Scroll** *(This speaks of the Dao of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi for extending life, nurturing nature, and attaining longevity.)*

To nurture nature and extend life, one must first reflect deeply—consider what comes after, but first ponder what preceded it. The body one inherits is originally formless, a primordial essence, as Master Yu’s commentary states: *"Flowing forth, it relies on qi to lodge itself; yin and yang serve as its measure."* The soul and spirit reside within: the yang spirit is the sun-soul, the yin spirit the moon-soul. Soul and spirit dwell in mutual abodes. Nature governs the inner, establishing boundaries; emotion governs the outer, constructing walls. When walls are complete, all beings find peace.

At this time, when emotion harmonizes with heaven and earth: *Qian* moves and straightens, its qi spreading as clear streams; *Kun* is still and receptive, becoming the dwelling of the Dao. The firm retreats when applied; the yielding flourishes and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reversions, eight reunions, six residences—male white, female red. Metal and fire restrain one another, then water settles; fire is the inception of the Five Phases. *"The highest good is like water,"* pure and flawless, the formless image of the Dao. The True One is difficult to depict, yet its divisions are distributed, each dwelling alone. Like the egg’s white and black, they correspond—length and breadth but an inch, the beginning of limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb: bones supple enough to coil, flesh smooth as maltose.

The *Kan* male is the moon; the *Li* female is the sun. The sun bestows virtue; the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation—its body unharmed, its yang unbroken in covenant, its yin unencroaching upon its brightness. When darkness and new moon press close, eclipses veil and obscure, each overwhelming the other. Yang’s form dissipates; yin’s calamity arises. Male and female mutually contain and exhale to nourish; yin and yang intermingle, seeking one another. When metal transforms into water, water’s nature circulates without restraint; when fire transforms into earth, water cannot flow. The male moves and extends outward; the female is still and stores within. If overflow exceeds measure, the female restrains it—the po controls the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in timely accord, each attains harmony. Together they exhale, verifying the tally:

*"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the isle in the river.
The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady—
for our prince a good mate."*
Male does not dwell alone; female does not live in solitude. The dark warrior, coiled dragon—intertwined, they support one another, clarifying the union of yin and yang. If two women share a chamber, though their beauty be striking, though Su Qin’s eloquence and Zhang Yi’s persuasiveness serve as matchmakers, though tongues loosen in clever speech and honeyed words pour forth to reconcile hearts—though they become husband and wife, hair may rot and teeth fall out, yet they will never truly know one another.

If medicinal substances are not of the same kind, their properties differ; if weights and measures are unequal, their principles diverge. Though the Yellow Emperor tend the furnace, Taiyi grasp the flame, the Eight Lords of Huainan refine and blend, though they erect lofty altars with jade steps, offer unicorn jerky and phoenix delicacies, grasp tallies and kneel in prayer, beseeching spirits with lamentations—though they bathe, fast, and purify in hope of some attainment—it is like mending a cauldron with glue, plastering a wound with salt, applying ice to dispel cold, or using hot water to remove frost. Flying phoenixes and dancing serpents only appear more perverse.

The highest virtue takes no action and does not seek through scrutiny; the lesser virtue acts without ceasing. When the upper is closed, it is called *having*; when the lower is closed, it is called *nothingness*. *Nothingness* serves the *having*; the *having* possesses divine virtue. Within these two apertures, the method of metal and qi also requires mutual dependence. Know the white to guard the black; the numinous will come of itself. White is the essence of metal; black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao; its number is one—the beginning and end of yin and yang. It contains the Yellow Sprout, the master of the Five Metals. The Northern River Cart is lead: outwardly black, inwardly harboring yellow. Cloaked in coarse cloth, it conceals jade. Outwardly a madman, inwardly gold is the mother of water; the mother gives birth to the child. Water is the child of gold; the child resides in the mother’s womb. The True Person’s subtlety is as if present, as if absent—vague as the great abyss, now sinking, now floating. Advancing and retreating, they disperse yet each guards its own domain.

Gather the white; refine it to vermilion. Forge it into a protective exterior, with white as the inner lining, steadfast within. Square and round, a mere inch in diameter—intermingled, they support one another. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and lofty, surrounded by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai. Encircled, sealed, yet four pathways converge. Hesitant, one guards and defends, tightly securing it to bar all wickedness. Curved chambers connect to form a bulwark against unforeseen threats. No need for anxious thought; no cause for wearying the spirit. When qi fills the chamber, none can detain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it ever accompanies the person. Internally, it nurtures the self; in tranquility and emptiness, it returns to the original luminosity, illuminating the body within. Seal the orifices, fortify the spirit-root. The Three Lights sink into obscurity; warmly nurture the child-pearl. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought.

Chen Xianwei says: *"All that pertains to blood and qi has its nature, and that nature never deviates from the correct. All that pertains to blood and qi has its destiny, and that destiny never departs from emotion."*

Yet this nature is fundamentally correct—yet when one becomes deluded, loses the true nature, and sinks into deviant paths, even to the point of becoming a villain, a serpent, a scorpion, or some monstrous thing, there are those who transform true nature into perverse nature. This destiny is rooted in emotion—yet when one awakens the mind, perceives the nature, and comprehends that all sentient beings establish their destinies through lust, one may refine essence into qi, ascend to sagehood, transcend the mundane, and transmute destiny into rightful destiny. Only by knowing the root of nature can one nurture it; only by understanding the correctness of destiny can one prolong it.

Consider this: when a person first receives their bodily form, it is fundamentally a single correct nature. Yet when father and mother unite in essence, clouds of primordial qi spread forth—does this arise from correctness, or from emotion? The *Yuanjue Jing* states that destiny arises from desire, which aligns with this principle. Regulating yin and yang serves as the measure, each dwelling in solitude.

Emotion and nature arise from the hun and po souls; the hun and po arise from brightness and darkness; brightness and darkness arise from the sun and moon; the sun and moon arise from yin and yang. The sage, observing the mechanisms of Qian and Kun—firmness and softness, movement and stillness, opening and closing—deduces from them the Way of the Great Elixir, which accords with the *Great Change*. Its essential principle does not depart from regulating yin and yang.

Thus, when the sun emerges at *mao*, the sky brightens and the hun soul flourishes; when the sun sets at *you*, the sky darkens and the po soul prevails. The hun is the yang spirit; the po is the yin spirit. The hun makes the day its chamber; the po makes the night its dwelling—yet in truth, they do not depart from the two mechanisms of brightness and darkness.

When a person’s day is bright, they employ the hun and the spirit, for the hun’s essence is nature. When night is dark, they return to essence and the po, for essence and po are the root of destiny. Destiny generates emotion, so essence and po serve as the city walls. Nature generates the mind, so preserving the mind and spirit serves as the inner and outer ramparts. When the city walls are firm, people and things are at peace.

At this time, if one directs emotion outward, then Qian and Kun unite, and the principles of firmness and softness, movement and stillness, opening and closing are attained. Thereupon, a single circulation of qi pervades the great void, ascending and descending, merging and transforming. True earth, nine metals, eight woods, seven fires, and six waters all return to their abode—all become earth within earth. When earth is returned to, the Five Phases are complete, and the myriad things are born within it. The man appears in white form; the woman manifests in red hue. For when the Five Phases gather and coalesce, metal and fire restrain each other. Fire refines metal, and the metal coffer holds water like boiling soup in a cauldron; the jade cauldron seethes as if in a furnace, the golden furnace blazes. It is said that water, metal, and fire—these three are all within earth. When fire is mentioned, wood naturally exists. Once the transformations are complete, lead congeals and mercury coagulates within the cauldron—water’s achievement is the most excellent of all.

The supreme treasure is flawless; the utmost reality is difficult to grasp. When the fire-timing is sufficient and the Five Phases are distributed, each then dwells in solitude without encroaching upon the other. It is like a chicken’s egg—smooth as maltose, an inch in breadth, slightly narrower in width—within it resides the Dharma-body.

The ancients said: *"How much better to leap beyond the radiance of the pearl, surging forth until one reaches the Purple Tenuity Palace!"* The Kan male becomes the moon; with mutual seeking, heaven and earth endure long. The reason heaven and earth can endure is that the sun and moon move in alternation, yin and yang exchange and support each other to emit radiance. If this measure is ever lost, there arises the calamity of eclipse. The Kan and Li of humans are like the sun and moon of heaven and earth—can one steal the mechanism of heaven and earth?

Metal transforms into water; both emit verifying signs. This speaks of the marvel of metal and wood as husband and wife, water and fire as mates. Metal generates water; water’s nature is moist. Without earth to restrain it, there would inevitably be the peril of overflow. Water generates fire; fire generates earth. Once earth is generated, water cannot flow freely—it is restrained, stored, and paired with fire as its mate. Thus, metal and wood, though mutually destructive, become husband and wife through the power of fire. Water and fire, though mutually destructive, become mates through the power of earth. Thereafter, advance and retreat align with the seasons, each attaining harmony and manifesting in timely transformations, all emitting verifying signs.

*"Guan guan go the ospreys..."*—this speaks of the Way as the unity of one yin and one yang. Excessive yin or excessive yang is called illness. If one attains their proper match, no further effort is needed—naturally, they commune and conjoin to form the sacred embryo. If one fails to attain their proper match, then all efforts are in vain, and mental exertions are wasted—ultimately, nothing is achieved, and one only becomes more perverse.

The superior virtue takes no action; the inferior virtue cannot be without action. The Way of heaven descends to illuminate; the Way of earth ascends to humble itself. The Way of Kun ascends, yet its body is fundamentally still—stillness means non-action, and it cannot be sought through examination. The Way of Qian descends, yet its body is perpetually in motion—movement means action, and it ceaselessly strives. When the upper is closed and called "having," this refers to Kun’s Way ascending—closing it yields water, and water has form. When the lower is closed and called "non-having," this refers to Qian’s Way descending—closing it yields fire, and fire leaves no trace.

"Non-having" serves the upper: Qian can seek Kun to ascend. The upper possesses Kun’s virtue and harbors the treasure of True Unity. When Qian descends, it can generate Kun’s qi; when Kun ascends, it can generate Qian’s metal. The essential point lies in the two orifices of Qian and Kun mutually employing each other. When upper and lower commune in harmony, metal abounds and qi naturally arises; qi abounds and metal naturally flourishes. Thus, metal and qi truly depend on each other—this is the wondrous function of Qian and Kun.

*"Know the white, guard the black"*—the white is silver; the black is lead. "Know the white, guard the black" means refining silver within lead. When silver is refined within lead, spiritual clarity naturally arises. Yin is the essence of metal; lead is the foundation of water. Among the Five Phases, only water’s number is one, aligning with the pivot of the Dao and serving as the beginning of yin and yang. Though it is not the True One itself, it fulfills the function of the True One. Thus, the Way of the True One first takes golden sprout as the root of the yellow bud—golden sprout is water. To unite the myriad differences into one, one must first seek the one within the myriad differences as the foundation.

This is why the method of the golden elixir takes lead as its material—its principle is thus. Therefore, water is called the pivot of the Dao. Only at this point does it become clear that water fulfills the function of the True One, though it is not the True One itself. Water’s generating number is one; water’s completing number is six. In terms of the completing number six, water contains one part water and five parts earth. Thus, lead appears black externally yet contains golden splendor within, possessing the wondrous function of the Yellow Bud.

Water is the beginning of the Five Phases; lead is the master of the five metals. Water originally resides in the north; when transported to the south, it ascends from below, bearing the treasure upward—like the river chariot in motion. Hence, it is called the river chariot. Because yellow is mixed with black, it is called "clad in coarse cloth"—for lead’s substance is inherently base.

And because white silver lies within, it is called "concealing jade"—meaning the supreme treasure is guarded in secret. Generally, the principles of creation and transformation are such that the base guards the noble, obscurity nurtures clarity, the lowly preserves the exalted, and madness conceals sagacity. Though outwardly appearing as a madman, within he harbors the supreme treasure. Thus, the mechanism remains sealed and unexposed; the wise merchant hides his wealth deeply. How can this be spoken of in the same breath as those who hastily seek recognition from others?

Master Wei’s secret, though fundamentally rooted in lead, also extends its meaning to encompass both. Gold is the mother of water, each guarding its own domain. Silver is metal; lead is water. Metal generates water, hence gold is the mother of water. Water is the child of metal, and lead conceals silver, so the mother is within the child’s womb, and the child is within the mother’s placenta. The golden embryo resides within lead—this is the True Person within the abyss, now visible, now hidden, now sinking, now floating. Yet when lead is employed and the water recedes, the abyss clears, and the True Person emerges, each then returning to its own domain.

The *Jinbi Jing* states: "In the fiery crucible, lead sinks and silver floats"—its secret is the same. When one gathers the white, it becomes supremely exalted. Gathering the white means collecting the floating silver, the supreme treasure of the west. When refined, the vermilion congeals, and the sacred embryo of the Golden Elixir forms in the southern chamber. Once the Elixir is complete, its manifestation resembles the primordial chaos of Master Hundun, or the square and round, inch-wide True Lord of White Within—intermingled and mutually sustaining. This is Master Wei’s revelation of the precelestial symbolic method.

Having arisen before heaven and earth, its exalted supremacy is beyond all thought or discussion. Surrounding it are walls and gates, ever present with humanity. Within the divine chamber, the symbolic form is complete, and the world is established. The golden wheel encircles it like a surrounding wall, while the world resides at its center, as beautiful as Penglai. With the firmness of silver mountains and iron walls, it blocks all evil and ensures security. Its fourfold openness, like towers of jade and pavilions of pearl, allows for unobstructed spiritual play.

At this time, one may be free from anxious thoughts, untroubled by sorrow or toil, preserving the Great Harmony as if holding a full vessel. A single thought of movement or stillness, and the Dharmakāya follows. When the spirit and qi fill the body, it is most difficult to preserve. Guard it, and one flourishes; lose it, and one perishes. Let the scholar take heed!

Inwardly, one must cultivate oneself. Though near and easily sought, when the Elixir resides in the divine chamber, one must conceal its brilliance, turning the light inward to illuminate within. In non-action and silence, the root is deeply secured. Let the sun, moon, and all phenomena sink together, so that radiance remains hidden. The infant and the sacred pearl grow in warmth, nurtured without deficiency. Within the work of non-action, the divine work is revealed—not in form, but in the formless. Though near and easily sought, it is not obtained from without. It lies in the scholar’s hidden merit and virtuous conduct.

Peng Xiao said: Master Wei taught that those who wish to prolong life and avert death must understand the beginning and end of the body. The beginning and end are the primordial qi. The cultivation of the Returned Elixir relies entirely on primordial qi to achieve completion. It is by connecting the boundless primordial qi to the limited physical form that one does so. The boundless primordial qi is the long-lived true essence of heaven and earth, the yin and yang—the qi of the sagely father and numinous mother. The limited physical form is the short-lived, turbid, and chaotic qi of ordinary parents. Thus, by transforming the body of ordinary parents with the qi of the true parents, one becomes a being of pure yang true essence, attaining a lifespan equal to that of heaven and earth.

Taoist Master Tao said: Primordial qi is the root of humanity. An ancient song says: *"Refine it, nourish it for a thousand days—once the body is free of yin, how can death come?"* Thus, the pure yang essence and qi are indestructible. The measure of yin and yang: In the preparation of the divine elixir of golden liquid, one first establishes the measure of yin and yang, then sets up the Qian and Kun cauldrons and furnaces. The soul and spirit reside within, each serving as the other’s dwelling. This means the sun’s soul and moon’s spirit are bound within the golden chamber, forming the foundation of the Elixir.

The nature resides within, establishing the inner enclosure. Nature belongs to metal, which governs principle within and receives external signs to nurture the numinous mercury. The enclosure is the physical form. The emotions operate externally, constructing the firm city walls. Emotions are the fire of the talisman; fire moves through the six voids to become cinnabar mercury. The city walls and people are the cinnabar mercury. At this juncture, it is also due to the movement and stillness of Qian and Kun, the flowing of qi, and the distribution of essence. Earth resides in the central palace as the dwelling of the Dao. Yang subdues yin, and the cycle of peace and adversity alternates. The punishment and virtue of yin and yang are the fundamental paths of the medicine.

The nine returns, seven reversions, eight returns, and six residences refer to: metal’s generating number is four, its completing number nine; fire’s generating number is two, its completing number seven; wood’s generating number is three, its completing number eight; water’s generating number is one, its completing number six; earth’s generating number is five, its completing number ten.

The white male and red female: Metal initially generates water and belongs to yin, corresponding to the north and the Kan trigram, which symbolizes the male within Qian—hence the "Kan male." Metal is white, so it is called the "white male." Fire belongs to yang, corresponding to the south and the Li trigram, which symbolizes the female within Kun—hence the "Li female." Fire is red, so it is called the "red female." When true metal is within the crucible, it is the Kan male, the husband of the Li female. When outside the crucible, it reverses to become the Li female, the wife of the Kan male. Thus, the metal mother receives the qi of the great yang and produces the numinous mercury.

Water stabilizes fire: This means metal and fire restrain each other, preventing true water from flowing away. The beginning of the Five Phases: Water’s generating number is one. The highest good resembles water: Water is the mother of all things, clear and flawless, invisible in its form. The image of the Dao is subtle and operates within the crucible, transforming endlessly, beyond depiction. When it transforms and distributes: This means the Five Phases each guard their boundaries, aligning with fire and the four seasons without error.

In the preparation of the golden liquid Returned Elixir, there is an altar, upon which stands a furnace, upon which sits a stove, within which is a crucible. The crucible contains the divine chamber, and the divine chamber holds the metal and water. The divine chamber resembles a chicken’s egg, and the metal and water are the same—layered and enveloped. The black and white correspond: Metal and water envelop each other. Its length and width are one inch, to accommodate the numinous mercury.

If one uses the Qian and Kun pivot to control Kan and Li, the ten-month gestation forms a body no different from a human’s, with four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and flesh all complete. These several lines reveal Master Wei’s disclosure of the inner and outer symbolic forms and the appearance of cinnabar mercury.

The *Divine Chamber Song* of the Yin True Lord says:
*"The golden crucible of Earth’s womb gives birth to life and death,
Seven inches long, the divine chamber shines with threefold clarity.
Five inches in diameter, one inch across—primordial chaos wanders,
Heaven and earth, five stars, yin and yang unite in a form like a chicken’s egg.
Yellow and white, inside and out, thickness and thinness even,
Six and one firmly sealed—guard well the southern gate."*

The *Cantong Qi* also states: *"Use water to fly the earth mother and restrain it."*

Here the text notes: *"Smooth as maltose"*—Peng’s version reads *"smooth as lead,"* hence the annotation is not included.

The Kan male is the moon’s essence, seeking union through the symbol ㄈ; the moon’s spirit is golden cinnabar, the sun’s soul is fiery mercury. When the sun retreats, the moon seizes authority—gold and fire alternately apply their functions, mutually restraining and subduing without harm. Between the dark and new moons lies the moment of yin-yang succession, the time of lunar waxing and waning, when sun and moon eclipse, obscure, and overwhelm each other, dissolving their forms.

This illustrates how within the crucible, yin talismans and yang fire intermingle with each passing moment, as darkness departs and dawn arrives, hours and shadows shift and change. Since they obscure one another, it is said that calamity arises. Within this process, the Kan male and Li female—masculine essence and feminine nature—mutually require, inhale and exhale, gather and generate transformations, forming true essence into divine medicine.

Gold transforms into water—when both exhale in verification, fire reaches its peak at the second and eighth months, gold and water flow freely. Either water emerges from gold, or golden cinnabar transmutes into water, thus harmonizing and manifesting their function. When fire’s number is exhausted, its work returns to earth; earth guards the four seasons, preventing water from flying, thus halting its movement.

When the male moves and externally exerts, fire circulates outside; when the female remains still and internally conceals, gold abides in the central palace. Though fire encounters gold, it is constrained by water; once the yin spirit is bound, the yang soul also submits. Cold and warmth entwine, each finding its proper place, both exhaling in verification to nourish and generate the numinous mercury.

*"The ospreys cry on the islet..."*—the more one observes, the more discordant it appears. Those who refine golden liquid and return cinnabar must first clarify the root of lead and fire, then recognize the principle of yin and yang. Solitary yin cannot produce alone; solitary yang cannot complete alone. One must await the union of yin and yang, the mating of female and male, the dragon’s exhalation and tiger’s inhalation, the male’s completion and female’s production. Thus it is said: a hen cannot hatch its own chicks alone; two women living together will not harmonize in affection. Moreover, between heaven and earth, if yin and yang are separated, the myriad things cannot arise. Therefore, one gathers heaven and earth’s true essence, takes yin and yang’s fundamental root as the foundation of the medicine. If one uses metals, stones, herbs, ice, snow, frost, dew, salt, or brine—things not of the same kind, solitary yin or solitary yang—even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, the Great One holds the fire, the Eight Lords forge, or Huainan harmonizes, though altars are grandly arrayed, offerings and libations abundantly prepared, and prayers reverently offered to all spirits, the attainment of returning cinnabar will be as futile as using glue to mend a cauldron or applying brine to heal a wound—flying toads and dancing snakes will never be achieved.

The *Highest Virtue* is non-action—water resides above; the *Lesser Virtue* is fire below. Water and fire achieve mutual completion, which is the meaning of Qian and Kun. Water above remains constantly still, non-active, dwelling in yin without seeking through observation. Fire below constantly moves, revolving through the twelve earthly branches, its function unceasing. The upper closure is called "having" (inner water); the lower closure is called "non-having" (outer fire). "Non-having" serves the above: fire circulates the qi of the four seasons and five phases to nourish the divine embryo, hence it is said that above resides the divine virtue—this is the divine embryo of golden mercury.

These two apertures, the method of gold and qi, also mutually require: this means the two qi of water and fire, yin and yang, interlock and mutually require to form the divine medicine; there is no other path. In this chapter, Master Wei profoundly elucidates the great outline of the method’s imagery and the direction of the divine medicine.

*Know the white, guard the black*—the white is gold, the black is water. Knowing the root of gold and water and using it as the foundation of the medicine, the numinous essence will naturally arise within the vessel, hence it is said the divine illumination comes of itself. White gold is born from water, thus becoming a divine vessel; the water’s body is unbroken, making gold and water’s dual nature the pivot of the Dao.

Water’s number is one, the beginning of heaven and earth, yin and yang, the five phases, and the myriad things. Water is one, fire two, wood three, gold four, earth five. *"The profound contains the yellow sprout"* refers to gold and water generating the yellow sprout. The master of the five metals is the northern river chariot; the river chariot is water and fire, meaning the two qi of water and fire circulate to generate the five phases.

Thus, lead’s exterior is black while its interior harbors golden radiance—before lead transforms into white gold, it is mixed within ore, its outer appearance black yet concealing inner golden splendor, like a madman in coarse cloth hiding jade. *Gold is the mother of water*—gold generates water; gold as the mother of water means gold and water are born yet reverse their forms in water, like a child within the mother’s womb. The child hides in the mother’s womb: this means black lead transforms and lodges in the west as the white tiger, the golden embryo. Water contains gold yet again conceals its essence within the golden womb—this is true mercury.

The true person’s utmost subtlety lies in each guarding its boundary: true mercury, compelled by external talismanic fire, drifts within the mother’s womb, now sinking, now rising, flying and hiding unpredictably, as if present, as if absent. Following the talismanic response, advancing and retreating, each guards its own domain and dares not transgress. In this chapter, Master Wei profoundly elucidates the inner imagery, the state of true essence beyond sight and hearing, the elusive and imperceptible appearance and disappearance. Profound and wondrous! Divine and sagely!

Gathering it, the white takes precedence—this means that at the initial movement, white metal leads first. Refining it, it becomes vermilion—this refers to the smelting process, where with blazing fire it is wrought into cinnabar. Forging it as an outer defense with white within as the true abode—this is to take white metal as the divine chamber.

Square and round, a *cun* in diameter, blending yet mutually restraining—this describes the golden embryo’s form, modeled on primordial chaos, crafted with upper and lower halves. Hollow within, square and round, a *cun* in diameter, it holds true mercury. Once the two halves are sealed together, tightly bound and impervious, yin and yang align without the slightest leak, nurturing dragon and tiger. As the ancient song says: *"Seal the embryo to prevent leakage, and transformation occurs in an instant."*

Before heaven and earth arose, lofty and exalted—this refers to true lead, which took shape before the existence of heaven and earth, yin and yang. Lead first attained the One, then gradually gave rise to heaven and earth, yin and yang, the Five Phases, and the myriad beings. Thus, lead is the father and mother of heaven and earth, the root and origin of yin and yang. The sage gathers the root of heaven and earth’s parents as the foundation of the great medicine, assembling the pure essence of yin and yang as the substance of the returning elixir. Such a creation is beyond the transformations of ordinary things.

At the outset of elixir refinement, one takes the root of heaven and earth as the root of the medicine, the mother of yin and yang as the mother of the elixir. If one cannot generate heaven and earth, yin and yang within this process, it is not the Way of the golden liquid returning elixir. If one uses substances produced after the arising of heaven and earth, yin and yang—such as the five metals, eight stones, herbs and trees, ashes and lye, morning frost, night dew, snow broth, ice water, green salt, or white brine—mixing them together, is this not difficult? Those of like mind should ponder this long and naturally awaken. Thus, a later passage says: *"After ten thousand repetitions, the divine may be glimpsed. If one reveals it to others, there are walls and gates beside."*

In refining the returning elixir, there are the altar, furnace, crucible, and hearth, upper and lower connected like Penglai’s isle, open on all four sides. The crucible has a cover and a divine chamber, the golden embryo intricately linked. Within the crucible, there are also pivots and bolts, tightly sealed to block evil and prevent the true qi from escaping, thus avoiding stray thoughts and needless worry.

One must firmly secure the defenses so that the divine qi fills the chamber. Then, one must regulate and harmonize yin and yang, alternating their functions to retain the true essence and bring about transformation. If the fire talismans are misapplied, even with true essence within, it will scatter and flee. All depends on harmonizing water and fire, guarding without loss—then success is assured. Thus, the true qi’s movement and stillness, activity and rest, all constantly accompany the practitioner.

Internally nurturing the self—when the divine embryo resides in the Central Palace, the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases harmonize, allowing the divine embryo to nurture the self in tranquility, effortlessly abiding in emptiness and non-being, naturally transforming.

Originally, it illuminates within and reflects the body—this means that metal can illuminate and, by its own light, when joined with fire, further enhances its brilliance. Seal its *dui*—the *dui* mouth. Once the golden tiger’s numinous root is settled in the Central Palace, one must tightly seal the crucible’s opening, directing the workings of the Three Lights’ true essence to enter within, nourishing the pearl-child and numinous mercury. Thus, it is said: *"The Three Lights sink into the depths."*

The Three Lights are the yang fire, yin talisman, and golden embryo, symbolizing the sun, moon, and stars. Externally, there are also Three Lights, distributed within the moments of activity and stillness, the alternations of yin and yang’s talismanic fire, transforming and completing.

Since both inner and outer possess the bodies of yin and yang’s transformations, they cannot be exhaustively discussed. At this level of subtlety, nothing is not oral instruction, difficult to convey in writing.

When metal and mercury transform within the crucible, their changes are unfathomable, impossible to glimpse. Yet by employing the celestial mechanism to control the symbolic pivots, metal and mercury dare not flee, and dragon and tiger achieve union. Thus, it is said: *"Near and easy to seek."* The *Yin Martial Classic* states: *"The cosmos is in your hands, the ten thousand transformations arise from your body."*

Chen Zhixu said: This speaks of how one must first cultivate one’s nature before one may refine one’s destiny. What, then, is nature? It is the thing of Qian. If one can nurture it, the yang of Qian will not wane; essence will be guarded within, and qi will arise from without. With this, one may refine the elixir and enter sagehood. Yet people do not know that nature and destiny are two aspects of one thing. Some conjecture that nature is numinous clarity and awareness; others take it to be the stubborn heart of flesh; still others identify thought and consciousness as nature, or point to the intangible as nature, or liken it to empty nothingness. Some even take *ling* as destiny. How could they know that the subtle, elusive thing is nature, or recognize the gate of ceaseless generation and transformation as destiny? With only blind guesses and dreamlike fancies, how can they attain the Way of the sages?

The Yellow Emperor said: *"Heaven’s nature is human; the human heart is mechanism."* The noble one who attains it preserves his person; the petty one who attains it trifles with his life. Confucius said: *"Exhaust principle, fulfill nature, and so reach destiny."* Mencius said: *"Preserve the heart, nurture nature—this is how one serves Heaven."* *"Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; cultivate the self and await it—this is how one establishes destiny."* The Way of the sages, as transmitted down to Mencius, is perfectly clear. Yi [Wing] said: *"In ancient times, the sages composed the *Yijing* to accord with the principles of nature and destiny."* Thus, they established the Way of Heaven as yin and yang, the Way of Earth as yielding and firm, and the Way of Humanity as benevolence and righteousness.

The immortals above say: *"If one cultivates nature but not destiny, how can one enter sagehood? If one cultivates destiny before nature, one enters the path of practice."* Some say Buddhists cultivate nature while Daoists cultivate destiny—how could there be two Ways in the world? This is because they have not studied Mencius’ Way of preserving the heart, nurturing nature, cultivating the self, and establishing destiny. To establish destiny, one must first nurture nature. Without awakening to nature, how can one know destiny? Thus, the *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *"What Heaven decrees is called nature; following nature is called the Way."* Therefore, the sage has no dual heart.

This is why, if one wishes to nurture nature and prolong destiny, one must first instruct people on what it means to nurture nature. Dongbin thus used *"refining the self"* to clarify it. But what is establishing destiny? Zhang and Xu used *"refining the elixir"* as a metaphor. *"Only essence, only unity—hold fast to the center"*—this is nurturing nature. *"Male and female unite in essence, and the ten thousand things transform and generate"*—this is establishing destiny. *"Accumulating essence, amassing qi"*—this is nurturing nature. *"Flowing wu to ji"*—this is establishing destiny.

Those who scrutinize the end but neglect the beginning are people who, though endowed with intelligence, cling to perversity and refuse to turn back. They say: *"Since there is birth, there must be death—how could there be longevity?"* Yet sages, immortals, and buddhas are all born of Heaven. How could a teacher grant this to others? How could they achieve it themselves without careful reflection? Those who resign themselves to death should first consider: *"Where does my body come from?"* If one says it arises from the qi of father and mother’s yin and yang, then the qi of yin and yang must be able to prolong destiny and enable one to become a sage, immortal, or buddha.

Thus, refining the Great Elixir is no different from the moment of receiving qi at birth—only the direction differs. Confucius said: *"If one does not know life, how can one know death?"* The sages clarified the causes of life and death in nature and destiny, and revealed the Way of yin and yang—how it proceeds in reverse or in sequence. That which follows the sequence to generate beings is the human; that which reverses the sequence to generate the elixir is the sage. This is called *"original essence spreading like clouds, relying on qi at the beginning."*

What is meant by *"yin and yang as measure, the abode of hun and po"*? Yin and yang take hun and po as their substance; hun and po take yin and yang as their dwelling. Li is the sun’s hun; Kan is the moon’s po. Po is the yang within yin, governed by wu earth; hun is the yin within yang, governed by ji earth. Hun and po mutually serve as chambers, and yin and yang interflow. Nature presides over treasuring essence within, establishing the inner barrier; emotion presides over subduing qi without, constructing the outer walls.

What is the *"city"*? It is the encasing of the radiant flower. What is the *"outer wall"*?

The chamber for refining the elixir—at this moment, Qian’s nature stirs and straightens, so essence and qi unite as one body; Kun’s emotion settles and converges, becoming the dwelling of the Dao. That which is firm and straight, once applied, retreats; that which is soft and transformative spreads its moisture to nourish the elixir, producing the child within the crucible and returning to complete the work.

What is called the *"Nine Returns"*? Earth generates metal in four phases, heaven completes silver in nine stages; dragon and tiger intertwine, the qi of metal and silver returns to the crucible—hence *"Nine Returns."* The *"Seven Reversions"*? Earth generates fire in two phases, heaven completes cinnabar in seven stages; hun and po yearn for each other, the essence of cinnabar and fire reflects back into the crucible—hence *"Seven Reversions."* The *"Eight Returns"*? Heaven generates water in three phases, earth completes mercury in eight stages; wu and ji unite as one, the true mercury returns to the refining crucible—hence *"Eight Returns."* The *"Six Residences"*? Heaven generates water in one phase, completing lead in six stages; emotion and nature resonate, the marvel of lead and mercury returns to reside in the crucible—hence *"Six Residences."*

The male is white, the female red; metal and fire constrain each other. The male belongs to the Azure Dragon’s wood, receiving the qi of dui metal, tempered to return as white. The female belongs to the White Tiger’s metal, refined by the essence of li fire, smelted to return as red.

Thus, the water must be stabilized, the fire regulated. The altar and its surroundings must be pure and solemn, the medicinal substances authentic and correct. One must adjust the quantity of water by drawing and adding, gauge the maturity of the fire by refining and tempering. At this time, it is the inception of the five phases’ transformation.

The highest good is like water: within water lies metal, capable of generating *li shui*. Seek its utmost clarity, utterly undisturbed, without substance or blemish—only then can it transform. This is called the image of the *"Supreme Good"* and the *"Dao."*

The male and female are the forms of the Dao; Qian and Kun are the images of the Dao. Within form and image, the true qi of the One is born—yet one cannot depict its form or map its image. Thus, this form and this image each follow their transformative mechanisms, dispersing and residing, wielding life and wielding death. Jia and yi roam from the east, geng and xin lodge in the west—hence it is said, *"each dwells alone."*

Like a hen’s egg: the returning elixir has form.

Where black and white align, yin and yang achieve union. A span of one *cun* marks the initial coagulation of the elixir—first as minute as a grain of millet, then gradually expanding to fill that breadth. Not only does the divine chamber swell with abundance, but the *qi* suffuses the four limbs, moistening the five viscera, sinews, and bones, all suffused with ease. After ten months of work, the elixir takes form, shedding its womb—this is called the *"Yang Spirit."* The image of the Yang Spirit is the *qi* of the primordial, congealing into bone; thus, it may be rolled supple as flesh, smooth as lead, unlike the *jing* and blood of the posterior heavens that form men and creatures, whose bones are heavy and flesh turbid, incapable of transformation.

The *Kan* male is the moon; both emit verifying signs. *Kan* is water, the moon, the middle son; *Li* is fire, the sun, the middle daughter. *Kan* is yin without and yang within, its center holding *wu* earth to store metal and water, nurturing its yin *po*—this is the inner essence, the gate of Dao and righteousness, the white within black. *Li* is yin within and yang without, its center holding *ji* earth to house cinnabar and mercury, governing its yang *hun*—this is the accomplished nature, the body of benevolence and virtue, the black within white. The moon’s body is inherently black; receiving the sun’s light, its radiance unfurls without diminishing its substance. When yang loses its counterpart, the union is broken. When yin encroaches upon yang’s brightness, eclipses occur: at the new moon, the moon obscures the sun’s light, directly opposing it—the sun above, the moon below, momentarily veiling the sun’s brilliance. This is called *"yang’s form wanes, yin’s calamity arises."* Thus, men of this world cannot preserve true yang, repeatedly scorched by yin’s encroachment.

When female and male attain union, inverted and mutually drawn, when man and woman seek each other in reversal, the transformative mechanism arises: *Dui* metal transmutes to generate *Kan* water. Without true earth, *Kan*’s water overflows and floods. *Li* contains fire, which generates *ji* earth to restrain *Kan*’s water—thus, the water does not flood. Therefore, the Dao of the male is *Qian*’s hardness, outwardly bestowed; the virtue of the female is *Kun*’s stillness, inwardly concealed. When *Qian*’s outward bestowal exceeds its measure, it is constrained by *Kun*’s female, the *po* restraining the *hun*. The *po* belongs to *Dui*, the *hun* to *Zhen*. When *Zhen* male and *Dui* female—yin and yang—unite, they must not indulge in excess. One must alternate cold and heat, advance and retreat in timely harmony, neither premature nor delayed. Only then will female and male each emit their verifying signs, and their efficacy be witnessed.

The crux of this chapter lies in this: when one exceeds bounds, indulges in excess, or transgresses measure, yin encroaches and calamity arises—like enacting summer’s heat in midwinter or winter’s cold in midsummer. When the male acts and the female does not follow, when yang sings and yin does not harmonize, yin and yang fall into discord, all due to exceeding bounds and indulging in excess. Refining the elixir is no easy task; one must not take it lightly. The Venerable Pure Yang, having received the transmission from the Elder Immortal Zhongli, entered seclusion and repeatedly applied effort, yet deemed it imperfect and did not immediately achieve the elixir. Later, Master Cui of the Primordial Yuan bestowed upon him the *Mirror of Ingredients*, through which he gained thorough understanding. He then composed a poem: *"Beholding Master Cui’s Mirror of Ingredients, / The heart’s ground grows ever clearer."* Thereafter, his work swiftly bore fruit.

Later fools, clinging to non-action and empty nothingness as the Dao, drift through days, resigned to life and death—these are the great sinners of the teaching, how dare they speak of cultivation? The *guan guan* cries of the osprey... the greater the discord. The immortal elder directly points out that the golden elixir must have paired ingredients: one yin, one yang, relying on mutual arousal; one female, one male, to achieve transformation. If one dwells alone in solitude, where lies the mechanism of ceaseless transformation? With many females and no male, where is the Way of ceaseless generation? To refine the returning elixir, one must seek the primordial *qi* to complete it.

This passage’s words are forthright and need not be reiterated. *"The highest virtue takes no action..."* This speaks of the highest and lesser virtues, as the *Dao De Jing* states: *"The highest virtue takes no action and has no purpose; the lesser virtue acts and has purpose."* The *Wenshi Jing* says: *"Forgetting essence and spirit transcends life; seeing essence and spirit prolongs life."* The highest virtue is emptiness extreme, stillness profound; essence naturally transforms into *qi*, *qi* naturally transforms into spirit, spirit naturally returns to emptiness—this is the learning of the Great Dao. Thus, it does not rely on discerning pursuit. The lesser virtue takes emptiness and stillness as its root, the fire tally as its function: refining essence to merge with *qi*, refining *qi* to merge with spirit, refining spirit to merge with emptiness—this is the method of using spirit to guide *qi*. Thus, its function does not cease.

The highest virtue is one who embodies complete power, a person of *"nothing not done."* When a man reaches sixteen, his true essence is whole and prone to leakage. One of complete power can preserve and cherish it without loss. Meeting a wise teacher who imparts the Dao of non-action and cultivation, he perpetuates his longevity—this is the person of *"nothing not done,"* the complete person of the highest virtue. This is the sage enacting the transformation of non-action, the great person accomplishing the work of non-action. The lesser virtue is one who steals from the transformations of creation, a person who plunders the myriad things. When a common man reaches sixteen, his true essence has not leaked—this is called *"pure Qian."* Once desire stirs, the middle line of *Qian* moves into the palace of *Kun*; *Qian* cannot remain pure, the heart emptied, becoming *Li*. Thereafter, day and night, leakage persists—how much remains stored? Only the perfected person, without waiting for depletion, practices the sage’s Way of returning to wholeness, immortalizing the body—this is the person of the lesser virtue, one who steals from creation. This is the sage’s Way of following nature, the divine person’s work of action.

The highest virtue takes no action yet leaves nothing undone, attaining the complete body of the Great Ultimate and accomplishing the work of the posterior heavens—this is called *"not relying on discerning pursuit."* The lesser virtue acts and has purpose, seizing the function of creation to accomplish the work of the primordial—this is called *"its function does not cease."* The immortal teacher said: *"Begin with action—no one sees; / Reach non-action—all know. / Though non-action seems essential, / Who knows action is the root?"* These words exhaust the matter of the golden elixir—it is not easy. The perfected person acts out of necessity. Laozi thus said: *"Fine weapons are inauspicious tools, / Used only when unavoidable."* This refers to the same principle.

*"Closing above"* is called *"having"*—closing above is *Kun*, and *Kun*’s virtue is its stillness, its gathering and possession. This is the *wu* earth within *Kan*, containing the primordial true *qi* of the One. *"Closing below"* is called *"lacking"*—closing below is *Qian*, and *Qian*’s virtue is its stillness.

Here the exclusive focus on *"lacking"* constitutes the *ji* earth within *Li*, which conceals the postnatal spontaneous mercury. At this point, the aperture of dual illumination and dual function is revealed. As the *Classic* states: *"Abide in constant non-desiring to observe its mystery; / Abide in constant desiring to observe its aperture."* These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names—together they are called *"the Profound, the ever more Profound."* The gateway of the myriad mysteries. The sage has no dual mind; his profound words and wondrous phrases are never lofty or remote, yet none in the world can fathom their beginnings or ends. Essential transmission from a teacher is required. Even the supremely sagely Yellow Emperor, had he not studied under Guangchengzi, could not have illuminated this Dao on his own.

Such is this aperture—even the sage can find no recourse but to describe it. When all is said and done, Fu Xi drew the trigrams, beginning with *Qian* and *Kun* to establish this aperture. King Wen clarified it without redundancy, and Confucius expounded the meaning of *Qian*’s straightness and *Kun*’s receptivity. Laozi spoke of *"the gate of the Profound Female, / Which is called the root of Heaven and Earth."* Śākyamuni pointed directly to the treasury of the true Dharma, the wondrous mind of nirvana. All these are direct indications, clearly visible.

The superior practitioner may illuminate this aperture on his own, yet its functions and applications remain obscure without a teacher. *"Lacking"* is the offering to what is above—it is the wordless self-nature. *"Having"* is the *wu* disposition; if the self’s nature can serve the *wu*’s disposition, then the meaning of disposition will not cling to the benevolence of nature.

Above, benevolence and virtue reside—this is the primordial *qi* of the One arriving from the midst of emptiness, the virtue of spirit. The immortal elder further emphasized: *"These two apertures, the method and the qi, mutually depend on one another."* These two lines are the key to the *Cantong Qi*, a passage that even millennia later, the wise and discerning Yan and Min could not penetrate on their own. Master Yunfang said:

*"The gate that gives me life, the door that brings my death—
How many wake? How many realize?
Last night, iron man, ponder deeply:
Long life and immortality are made by man alone.
Is not that gate of life, that door of death,
The very two apertures?"*

Having previously expounded the principles of *Qian* and *Kun*, the sun and moon, and the workings of creation, we now firmly establish the profound barrier and directly point to the two substances, metal and water, arranging the text in proper sequence without digression. The cultivator of the elixir, having grasped this aperture, must further investigate: What is the metal-water? What is their mutual dependence and function? Only with deep and thorough understanding can one proceed to refine the elixir.

To *"know the white"* is to guard the black—recognize the purity and untainted whiteness of the metal’s essence, which is *"knowing the white."* Guard the foundation of the black, awaiting the time when water is generated, which is *"guarding the black."* The initial arising of water is called *"prior Heaven,"* for its utmost truth is named *"spirit."* When white and black align, metal and water flourish abundantly. Upon encountering *ji* earth, water is restrained, gold is refined, and the crucible fills with metal and water. Thus it is said: *"Spirit and illumination come of themselves."*

What is called *"water"*? It is the pivot of the Dao, its number named *"one,"* for water arises from Heaven’s one, making it the origin of yin and yang. The *Wings* states: *"Though yin possesses beauty, it contains it to serve the king’s affairs."* Thus the Great Profound is water, and the yellow sprout is the elixir. Water contains the elixir, hence the metaphor *"the Profound contains the yellow sprout."* Within black lead lies hidden white metal; within the river chariot resides the yellow sprout. This is like a scholar concealing jade, or one clad in coarse cloth yet unharmed. Metal is the mother of water, for *Dui* metal generates *Kan* water, and the central line of *Kan* belongs to metal—hence it is called *"the mother concealing the child."* The water of *ren* and *gui* arises from the west, and the central line of *Dui* pertains to *Kan*—thus *"the child resides in the mother’s womb."*

The true person is most wondrous—the true person is the body of *Qian*. *Qian* as a thing is supremely spirit-like and wondrous; its form is sometimes present, sometimes absent. The great abyss is the image of *Kun*. *Kun* as a thing can sink or float; its form is neither visible nor audible. Thus *Qian* can transform, and *Kun*’s virtue is to nurture life. Once transformation and generation are complete, *Qian* and *Kun* distribute and each guards its domain.

To refine it to pure white is to extract silver from lead. When congealed into the inner elixir, cinnabar alone is refined into lead powder. If refining the outer elixir, the same principle applies: the outer elixir must be externally protected, appearing as red and lustrous as cinnabar, while internally preserving its true whiteness.

Round or square, a *cun* in diameter, mutually constrained—this describes the object within the obscure barrier, the state before the Supreme Ultimate divided, when the primordial true *qi* of prior Heaven was contained within. It resides before the Supreme Ultimate, which precedes all images—hence it is called *"lofty and exalted."* Surrounded by walls and gates, it resembles Penglai; *Qian*’s image also resembles walls and gates, or Penglai. These metaphors describe the vessel, the body, and the self. All above refer to the cauldron and its apparatus.

Encircling and sealing denote protection; the four directions are open yet guarded, with external defenses secure. Vigilant and steadfast defense cannot be relaxed for even a moment.

Should it be forsaken, it is not the Dao. To block and sever the pernicious and the deviant, one must regulate ingress and egress with measured discipline, keeping inner and outer distinct so that awe is instilled and the True Lord within remains immaculate in its whiteness.

Where winding corridors interconnect, altars and sacred precincts must be established, their solemnity a bulwark against unforeseen calamity. The Immortal Elder, in his compassion, from the encircling seals and closures downward, has meticulously pointed out the teachings—yet unforeseen harm may still arise. Thus, one must abide in thoughtlessness and fearlessness, free from anxiety and toil, for it is said: "One may be without thought, but not with sorrow or labor." Only thus can spirit and *qi* fill the chamber without depletion, for it is said: "He who guards it prospers; he who loses it perishes." Even the slightest lapse invites ruin. Therefore, in movement and stillness, rest and repose, not a moment may be spent in carelessness or neglect. Then the *qi* of the golden crucible remains firm between self and other, mutually harmonized and subdued. Hence it is said: "It ever abides with the person."

This passage directly points to the essence of the two apertures, elucidating the function of metal and water. For the practitioner of cultivation, upon reciting the *Cantong Qi* to this point, one realizes that the very first step is already a matter of great difficulty. Those of lesser virtue who practice the Dao of deliberate action rely entirely upon the refinement of the self. If the refinement of the self is even slightly deficient, the numinous will not come, and the inner self cannot be nourished. To nourish the self is to cultivate the body and refine the self.

Confucius said: "The noble person secures his person before acting, stabilizes his mind before speaking, and establishes his relationships before making requests. The noble person cultivates these three, and thus remains whole." The sage, in his profound foresight, prepares for adversity and thoroughly understands human nature. Every action, word, and request—these three are the ultimate principles for entering sagehood, the essential words for truly nourishing the self. To treasure essence and enrich *qi* is to nourish the self; to forget the mind amid circumstances is to refine the self; to remain quiescent yet responsive is to refine the self; to accumulate virtue and perfect merit is to refine the self. To endure hardship in practice is called "refinement through suffering"; to perfect one’s conduct is called "refinement through mastery."

The cultivator of the elixir must first refine the self, enduring hardship and forbearance, so that when the time comes to enter the chamber, the six roots are perfectly settled, and one attains such mastery that forgetting reaches its ultimate limit. Only then can affairs be accomplished. Thus, the *Great Learning* states: "The Way of the *Great Learning* lies in illuminating the luminous virtue, in renewing the people, and in resting in the highest good." Having illuminated virtue and renewed the people, to rest in the highest good is precisely the refinement of the self. Moreover, "Knowing where to rest, one may then be steadfast; being steadfast, one may then be tranquil; being tranquil, one may then be at ease; being at ease, one may then deliberate; deliberating, one may then attain." This aligns perfectly with the essentials of quiescence and emptiness.

"Emptiness" does not mean utter vacuity. The Immortal Master said: "The primordial unity of *qi* arises from the midst of quiescence and emptiness"—this is the ultimate of quiescence and emptiness. The root and origin must be sought where one’s own embodied life began, for only then can one know that true essence and true *qi* are the foundation of this body. The enlightened understand that most people dissipate their spirit and *qi* through the desires of their cleverness. The great cultivator dismisses cleverness, sets aside wisdom, inwardly illuminates the form, and outwardly forgets the self. Sealing the senses and fortifying the numinous root, withdrawing the gaze to warmly nurture the child-pearl—sealing the numinous root is the refinement of the self and the coagulation of spirit; warming and nurturing the child-pearl is the accumulation of essence and the amassing of *qi*. Only when the refinement of the self is perfected may one proceed to refine the returning elixir.

Yet most people, ignorant of the great matter of refining the self, rashly pursue the work of obtaining the medicine in half a day, vainly hoping for success—how foolish indeed! Thus, the *Qingyang Jing* states: "Inwardly observe the mind, outwardly observe the form, distantly observe things—only to perceive emptiness. Emptiness has no object; the object of emptiness being none, there is also no emptiness. With no emptiness, there is profound and constant stillness, stillness without any locus of stillness." At this point, to the ordinary person, it would seem the ultimate rest, the great liberation. Yet how can desire arise from this? If desire does not arise, it is true stillness. Only true stillness can respond to things. Upon careful reflection, one sees that arriving at the point of true stillness and responding to things is the beginning task for the novice. If one speaks of refining the elixir, it must be thus.

Yet today, ordinary people perform a single fast, erect a single pagoda, engage in the Three Peaks practice, sit in desiccated meditation, recite scriptures, practice "non-action," or offer prayers and sacrifices—all these may be considered virtuous, but if one claims to be cultivating the Dao, one has not yet entered the gate. Thus, if the work of nourishing the self is lacking even slightly, it will not suffice. As Lü Dongbin said: "The sevenfold returning elixir lies within the person; first refine the self and await the time." The Mud-Pill Palace states: "If words do not resonate, they are not kin; if the work is not perfected, it is not square or round." Master Zi Yang said: "If you wish to refine the ninefold cycle, first refine the self and hold fast to the mind." How can one not heed these words?

The Perfected of Great Emptiness, having received the teachings of Lord Huangfang, proceeded to the Wuyi Mountains to undertake the work. At the outset of refining the self, obstacles and demons arose in the hundreds. The Perfected, resolute, declared: "Bind and dispatch the demonic spirits!" He beheaded the six thieves, then sat in settled breath. This thought, once arisen, was severed at the root of love. Only then did he begin to learn contemplation. This matter of refining the self demands even greater reflection.

This passage speaks only of nourishing the self, without mention of the golden tiger, the crucible, or the chamber. To equate the Three Lights with the yang fire and yin tally, or the golden embryo, is mistaken.

Yu Yan said: "Whether foolish or wise, all share the same nature and life. The noble person knows that nature must be nourished and life extended; uniting nature and life in dual cultivation, how can one not attain longevity? Yet to seek longevity, one must seek that which preceded one’s own birth—how this body came to be—only then can one discuss the Way of nourishing nature and extending life." Thus it is said: "One must consider what came before."

When a person is born, it is through the union of the parents’ *qi* that form is constituted. Form is the root that receives *qi*; *qi* is the source from which form arises. If *qi* does not obtain form, there is no basis for its establishment; if form does not obtain *qi*, there is no means for its completion. The heavens have the ecliptic as their measure, and the sun and moon travel within it—this is their abode. In the human body, the ecliptic is the path where the yin tally and yang fire move, the direction where the sun’s hun-soul and moon’s po-soul reside. One who can observe the Way of Heaven and grasp its movements, who understands the progression of yin and yang and the abodes of hun and po, can circulate the three hundred and sixty-five degrees of the celestial revolution in the space of a single breath. The sun and moon emerge from the subtlety of exhalation and inhalation—exhalation is yang, inhalation is yin—sharing the same wondrous function as Heaven and Earth.

The sun, being great yang, unfolds its light by day, hence it is called the hun-soul. The moon, being great yin, gathers its radiance by night, hence it is called the po-soul. The sun’s hun-soul is rightly termed a yang spirit. The moon’s po-soul, though yin essence, is also called a spirit because it is ceaselessly active, circulating through the six directions, coming and going without fixed abode, neither constant in ascent nor descent. The hun-soul pertains to the east and wood; the po-soul pertains to the west and metal. Metal and wood are not two distinct bodies—the eastern neighbor is the western household. Coming and going, ascending and descending, they alternate in their ingress and egress.

Nature is quiescent, emotion is active; nature governs the interior and establishes boundaries. Sitting upright with an empty mind, turning inward to observe, one seizes the golden essence as the foundation of life.

Emotion governs the exterior and serves as the city walls—this is the pivot and mechanism that journeys through the eight directions day and night, like a dragon moving in fire. When the city walls are intact and all beings are at peace, qi naturally surges through the joints and penetrates them, essence fills to overflowing, and the Valley Spirit abides.

At this moment, when one unites Qian and Kun, the River Chariot of day and night does not pause for even an instant, silently aligning with the great creation and moving in unison. When Qian is active and Kun is quiescent, if one abides by Qian, qi flourishes and essence flows, spreading to fill the Three Lights without fail—just as heaven’s movement directly nourishes the myriad things and reaches throughout the cosmos. If one abides by Kun, qi gathers and essence congeals, returning to the Original Sea to become the dwelling of the Dao—just as earth’s stillness gathers the myriad things and stores them within the soil.

Now, when Qian’s yang descends to aid Kun, and Kun’s soft compliance receives it, the medicine is born. Once the fire of refinement is applied, the firm acts and the retiring yin ascends, transforming into sweet springs that moisten the Nine Realms. How is this different from the creative process where yang descends, yin ascends, and all things are nourished?

The numbers six, seven, eight, and nine correspond to wood, fire, water, and metal. In the hexagrams, they are Zhen, Li, Kan, and Dui; in the directions, east, south, west, and north; in the lunar lodges, Room, Void, Star, and Wall; in the images, the serpent, phoenix, dragon, and tiger; in the seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter; in the hours, zi, wu, mao, and you—all are the same things.

Now, nine is called *return*, seven is called *reversion*, eight is called *homecoming*, yet six alone is called *abiding*. This is because the north, the position of Kan, is the native place where True Lead resides. When True Lead abides here, the upright qi of the nine metals, eight woods, and seven fires—like spokes converging at the hub or rivers flowing to the sea—all gather here.

"Male and female, red and white" refer to the yin and yang within the body. When yin and yang inwardly stir and resonate, spirit and qi unite, just as metal and fire constrain each other. When metal and fire constrain each other and rest within the north, in the water of Kan, spirit congeals and qi gathers, and the water naturally settles. If one can, at this moment, turn the light inward and reflect, exhaling subtly and inhaling gently without interruption, then spirit and qi will return to the root. Gradually entering, gradually softening, gradually harmonizing, and gradually settling—after long settling, when both exhalation and inhalation cease, the medicine and ingredients will naturally coalesce.

Thus, water is the root-source of the Great Elixir, residing at the head of the Five Phases, the native place where the medicine and ingredients of our body are produced. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is pure and non-action, yet it acts without contrivance—what is called "all day like a fool" is the true and proper work. Water’s nature is still and settled; when anchored, it is clear; when disturbed, it is muddied. This is why it is used as a metaphor: when one can be still and settled, the Dao naturally comes to dwell. There is a thing, undifferentiated, born before heaven and earth—its name is the Dao. It has no form or image to seek, much less can it be captured in a diagram.

At the moment of profound stillness and silent darkness, when not a single thought arises and all myriad concerns vanish, it is vast and boundless like the Supreme Ultimate before its division, deep and obscure like the Two Modes before their manifestation. Only this one thing remains, clear and profound like the moon reflected in a limpid pool, utterly still like motionless water without a ripple. One does not know which is lead and which is mercury—this is called the True One. When the time arrives and qi transforms and distributes, the light and pure ascend while the heavy and turbid settle below. Thus, in the Kan palace there is lead, and in the Li palace there is mercury. What was once undifferentiated and obscure is now divided into two, each residing separately.

The Golden Elixir is conceived in the prior heaven and born in the posterior heaven; its marvel lies in the moment when the Supreme Ultimate is about to divide yet has not divided, when stillness has reached its extreme but has not yet moved, when yang is about to return but has not yet departed from yin. Here, the mechanisms of heaven and earth converge, and the place where the elixir coalesces is known. If one grasps the knack of where to begin, then within the indistinct and vague, one seeks the existent thing; within the profound and obscure, one draws in true essence. Only then does one realize that "from nothing, something is born," and the marvel of the True One truly cannot be captured in a diagram.

It is like a chicken’s egg—smooth as malt sugar, its black and white being the two qi of yin and yang. When a person first forms in the womb, it is from the father’s essence and the mother’s blood, the two qi of yin and yang temporarily uniting to form a chaotic whole, like a chicken’s egg. After a hundred days, the four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape, and at the appointed time, the child is born, emerging from the womb with weak bones, soft sinews, tender flesh, and smooth skin—called an infant. Now, in the method of the elixir, spirit and qi unite and coalesce, "from nothing, something is born," following the same principle as the conception of a child in man and woman. The ten months of warming and nurturing, with true breathing gentle and unbroken day and night, are also no different from the time before the infant’s birth. From this, one knows that in refining the sacred embryo, there has never been a case where one could achieve success quickly without ten months of work.

Kan is the middle son, yet its body is Kun; its central line is Qian’s yang, hence "yin contains yang," and thus it has the image of the moon. Li is the middle daughter, yet its body is Qian; its central line is Kun’s yin, hence "yang contains yin," and thus it has the image of the sun. The sun bestows virtue, which is the husband’s Dao; the moon spreads its light, which is the wife’s Dao. Now, taking the moon as Kan’s male is making the wife into the husband; taking the sun as Li’s female is making the husband into the wife. This is the inversion of yin and yang within the body, which thus mutually support each other without harm.

The eclipses of the sun and moon are the conjunctions of their numbers. When the sun faces the moon, the moon is eclipsed; when the moon obscures the sun, the sun is eclipsed. Thus, the sun is eclipsed at the new moon, and the moon is eclipsed at the full moon. Yet there are times when there is an eclipse and times when there is not: when they conjoin, there is an eclipse; when they do not conjoin, there is no eclipse. Master Wei used the sun and moon to illustrate the mutual support of yin and yang, earnestly emphasizing the crescent and new moon, the partial and total eclipses—his intent surely lies herein. If scholars do not cling to the text or grasp at images but turn the light inward and reflect to seek the sun and moon within their own bodies, the crescent and new moon, they will begin to trust that his words do not deceive me.

"Male and female mutually assisting, both spitting forth verifying signs": male and female, yin and yang, are both the two things within our body. If one can turn the light inward and reflect, causing one’s own yin and yang to unite within, then firm and soft will pair, the Three and Five will return to the One—why seek elsewhere for male and female, yin and yang? When the two things’ qi mutually resonate, they naturally exhale and inhale, coalescing into an embryo. The Upper Clarity’s *Clouds* says, "Within one’s own body there is a husband and wife"—how people of the past must have laughed at this! Scholars should seek it through purity and non-action, not through deviant indulgence.

Gold is born in the Kan palace—it is merely qi.

Before it transforms into water, it is merely subjected to the true fire of the Great Yang, which lies concealed and steams from below, thus melting and transforming into water. The nature of water is to flow freely and abundantly—who could restrain it? Yet when fire reaches its extreme, it transforms into earth, and earth can restrain water; when water encounters earth, it halts, and thus cannot flow.

The *Mirror of Entering the Elixir* states: "Water can flow, fire can flame—within the body, this may be verified." Therefore, in harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir, one must not exceed the proper measure or overstep the nodal point. Now, the Kan male moves and emits outward, while the Li female remains still and conceals within. If the outward emission exceeds its measure or oversteps the node, the Li female will then restrain and control it, so that yin and yang may unite, hun and po may restrain one another, and excess does not lead to dissipation.

When gathering the medicine, the firing process must be neither too swift nor too slow, but rather harmonious, allowing for union. The *Fu Ming Pian* says: "Hard and soft mutually guard, qi evenly balanced—the subtlety lies in avoiding harm." The hexagrams Dui and Zhen emphasize that harmony is paramount.

The *Guan Guan* cries of the osprey—how much more do deviations appear perverse! The great Dao of the golden elixir is simply the interplay of one yin and one yang. This principle applies to human affairs and the patterns of all things. Now, Master Wei draws from the meaning of the *Guan Ju* ode, where the virtuous maiden matches the noble man, to illustrate the pairing of male and female within the body. He also takes the meaning of the intertwining of the dark and yellow dragons to illustrate the mutual dependence of the female and male within. This may be called a broad analogy, a detailed metaphor—nothing is left unaddressed.

Moreover, when the Dui woman and Gen man respond to one another above and below, it is called *Xian* (Union). When the two women of Li and Dui dwell together yet their aspirations differ, it is called *Kui* (Separation). This clarifies that yin and yang value mutual attainment and cannot be one-sided.

As for the matter of furnace and fire in refinement, yin and yang must be equally balanced. If the medicine and materials are not of the proper kind, or if their weights and measures lose their guiding principles, then even if the Yellow Emperor were to tend the furnace, the Great One to hold the fire, the Eight Lords of Huainan to refine and harmonize, using gold and jade for the altar steps, unicorns and phoenixes for the dried meats, fasting and bathing, holding the register and kneeling to present the blue memorial, bowing with the vermilion petition to pray to the gods above and below—I would still see it as a waste of time and effort, laboring in vain. It is like mixing glue with mud to patch a broken cauldron, or applying cinnabar to a festering sore, or trying to dispel cold with ice, or remove dampness with boiling water, or dancing with snakes—only to see the deviations grow more perverse.

Some may doubt the saying that "the male does not dwell alone, the female does not reside in solitude," arguing that if one refines the elixir without a woman, it becomes a case of solitary yang. They falsely cite this passage as proof and mock the orthodox Dao as impractical—all of which are perverse and fallacious arguments.

The *Dao De Jing* states: "Supreme virtue acts without contrivance; lesser virtue acts with intent." Here, "supreme virtue acts without contrivance" refers to the spirit guarding the mysterious palace in silent non-action. "Lesser virtue acts with intent, its function unceasing" refers to qi rising in the female palace in an unbroken stream.

This borrows from Laozi’s words to reveal the secret of the Kan and Li cavities. The upper closure is called "having"—the Li palace has form and conceals true water. The lower closure is called "non-being"—the Kan gate is formless, the crimson dragon. "Non-being" serves "having"; above, there is the spirit of virtue. When the original spirit dwells in its palace, qi follows and ascends—thus the subtlety lies in firmly sealing the eight gates.

These two apertures, "having" and "non-being," depend on one another: if the lower is not closed, fire will not gather; if the upper is not closed, the medicine will not ascend. Therefore, the Kan and Li cavities must be mutually paired and dependent.

Yet "non-being" does not oppose "having," nor does "above" oppose "below"; "spirit" does not oppose "qi," nor does "virtue" oppose "power"—this interchanging of terms is to prevent people from rigidly seeking "having" or "non-being," "above" or "below," "spirit" or "qi," "virtue" or "power."

White is metal; black is water.

The elixir method takes water as its foundation, and the essence of metal is born within water—thus one who knows the white must first guard the black. By guarding the black, the white naturally appears. How to guard it? Like a cat watching its burrow to await the mouse: the body remains unmoving, the eyes unblinking, the mind fixed solely on the mouse, with no other thoughts.

Spiritual clarity is the mechanism of heaven. If one wishes to steal this mechanism, one must first empty the heart. When the heart is empty, the spirit congeals, breath stabilizes, and both sides ascend together as one pound—then spiritual clarity naturally arrives.

Heavenly One generates water, standing at the head of the Five Phases, thus serving as the pivot of the Dao and the beginning of yin and yang. When water is augmented with earth (five), lead is produced within water. Nurtured by earth, it assumes the form of the Yellow Sprout. Lead, the master of the five metals, is born within water, residing in the northern direction within the Mysterious Barrier. When refined by true fire, it emerges, and the River Chariot dares not linger—its circulation ascends to the summit of Kunlun Peak.

Golden Flower is the Yellow Sprout, the essence of lead. Though the exterior of lead is black, the Golden Flower lies concealed within, like a supreme treasure hidden in the bosom of a coarse-clad man. Metal is born of water, thus metal is the mother of water, and water is the child of metal. Water contains metal, so the mother conceals the child’s embryo, and the child shelters the mother’s womb. If scholars understand the meaning of metal within water, they will know the source from which the medicine is produced.

The Perfected One’s utmost subtlety lies in its nearness and ease of pursuit—the Perfected One is the original spirit. It exists as if present, as if absent, continuously yet effortlessly maintained. Vaguely floating and sinking, the Perfected One moves to and fro within the great abyss, faintly drifting like a shadow, now rising, now descending.

The *Great Compendium of Golden Elixir* states: "On Kunlun’s peak lies the path of the Yellow Flower; at times it leads the original spirit away, then brings it back." For the great abyss is Kunlun itself. In the elixir method, one advances from *zi* and retreats from *wu*; advance and retreat are distributed, each guarding its own domain without encroachment.

White is metal; vermilion is mercury. To gather them, one takes the white—collecting the white metal from the northern *Kan* palace as the elixir mother. Yet white metal and vermilion mercury are of the same kind, naturally following one another. In cultivation, the vermilion (mercury) daily circulates fire to draw out the lead qi while adding mercury in its place—this is what is meant by "true lead does not use lead."

Scholars merely know to conjoin lead and mercury as the medicine, yet fail to recognize the fire-work of withdrawing lead and replenishing mercury. Without this, even if the elixir’s head is formed, it cannot avoid dissipation. Refining as external defense refers to the true fire operating in the outer furnace. The steadfast dwelling within the white signifies the Golden Elixir residing internally. The inner furnace holds the elixir, but it must be refined day and night by the fire of the outer furnace to reach maturity.

The *Tai Gu Collection* states: "At the crown, the Black Pearl circulates its light; within the abdomen, the secret treasure is stored, radiant and secure." Is this not the fire operating externally while the elixir is concealed within?

"Square and round, a span in diameter" refers to the Mud Pill Palace. Today, people merely call the heart "a square inch," unaware that the three fields of the human body are all hollow, each a span in size, with qi and vessels all interconnected. "Blended and mutually supporting" describes the nine palaces of the head, with the Mud Pill at their center. The *Yellow Court Classic* states: "The Mud Pill’s nine Perfected Ones each have their chambers; this is the square and round span of one inch."

"Born before heaven and earth" refers to the Mud Pill’s single aperture, the ancestral aperture of the body’s myriad orifices. When this aperture opens, all orifices open in unison. "Lofty and revered" describes the Mud Pill Palace atop Kunlun Peak, the dwelling of the original spirit, corresponding above to the Mysterious Capital, the gathering place of the ten thousand spirits.

"Flanked by ramparts and gates" refers to the seven orifices arrayed externally, with the Cavern Chamber and Yellow Gate situated before them. "Resembling Penglai" is like the three immortal mountains upon the sea, with Penglai at their summit. "Encircled and sealed" means withdrawing vision and returning hearing, carefully closing the gates. "Fourfold communication and lingering" describes the original harmony circulating internally, qi flowing unimpeded, as the Scarlet Phoenix soars around the Jade Terrace.

"Guard and defense, firm and secure" is like a dragon nurturing its pearl, the mind never forgetting, or a hen brooding its egg, the breath never ceasing. "Blocking and cutting off wickedness" means that no matter how demonic realms intrude, one simply wields the axe. "Interconnected winding pavilions to guard against the unforeseen" means that if the spirit departs, it must be recalled, and the Twin Lads will forever guard the cavern’s gate.

Yet if the heart is without action, qi harmonizes; when qi harmonizes, the supreme treasure coalesces. If the heart acts, qi scatters; when qi scatters, the essence disperses. Thus, one may be free from thought, but not from sorrow and toil.

Through long and sincere accumulation, supreme harmony overflows. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, one must always guard carefully. Guarding brings prosperity; loss brings ruin. One cannot depart from it for even a moment.

This is what is meant by "in walking, standing, sitting, and lying, never leave *this*—walking, place the feet on level ground; standing, concentrate the spirit in the great void; sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of the nose; lying, embrace the pearl below the navel." Through long and unbroken practice, this becomes the true work. Otherwise, the mind-monkey is restless, the intent-horse gallops, spirit and qi scatter externally—how can one hope to congeal the elixir?

Thus it is said: "Empty the heart, forget the form, guard the One, embrace the numinous, and you will be able to secure essence, preserve qi, and complete spirit." Wang Chongyang’s *Golden Perfected Collection* states: "The wondrous function of the Mysterious Pass is not difficult to fathom—it lies solely in wordless silence. Only in wordless silence, concealing emptiness and utmost stillness, does the original yang true qi naturally return."

The great principle of cultivation lies in returning to the root and reverting to the origin, turning the light inward to illuminate, like metal and water concealing their brilliance within the ear.

The *Dui* mouth is the numinous root of the *Kan* palace.

Closing the *Dui* mouth seals the upper from leakage; consolidating the numinous root of the *Kan* palace prevents the lower from seepage. When spirit does not stray outward, harmonious qi suffuses and fills, and beauty resides within.

The Three Lights and the Cavern Chamber are the numinous images. If one can gather the Three Lights and turn their illumination inward, the Central Upright Position will yield the Mysterious Pearl.

Though the great elixir of Golden Cinnabar possesses no visible form or substance, if one seeks it through proper method, it requires but a moment’s effort before golden blossoms fill the eyes—how distant could it be? As the *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"The effort is easy, the medicine not remote."* Those who break into laughter do so because the seeker overlooks what is near and readily attainable, instead pursuing it in the distant and abstruse.

**The *Ancient Text of the Kinship of the Three* with Collected Explanations, Volume I** *[Below: *Zibu, Daoist Works, Ancient Text of the Kinship of the Three with Collected Explanations*]*
**Imperially Commissioned *Siku Quanshu*: *Ancient Text of the Kinship of the Three* with Collected Explanations, Volume II** *[Above]*
**Ming Dynasty, Jiang Yibiao (editor)**
**The *Kinship of the Three*** *[Eastern Han, Wei Boyang (author)]*
**Lower Scroll** *[This speaks of the sagely and worthy’s path of consuming the elixir and ascending in flight through Golden Cinnabar.]*

Of old, the sages and worthies embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True, ingesting and refining the Nine Cauldrons. Their traces dissolved into the dragon’s depths, where they nurtured essence, cultivated spirit, and communicated virtue with the Three Lights. Their fluids overflowed, sinews and bones strengthened, all perverse influences were dispelled, and upright qi abided. Through long accumulation, they transformed their forms and became immortals.

Pitying later generations who loved the Dao, they followed the winds and gathered the currents, inscribing ancient texts and crafting illustrated manuals to reveal the branches and leaves while concealing the root, assigning various names to obscure the truth. Scholars obtained these works, storing them in caskets, passing them from father to son and grandfather to grandson, yet generation after generation remained deluded, never glimpsing their meaning. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their plows, merchants forsook their trades, and scholars impoverished their households. I grieve deeply for them.

This text is concise and easy to ponder, its matters simple and unencumbered. Its clauses are laid out for inspection, its measures and weights precise. Following their sequence, I have composed these disordered words. The gates and apertures lie within—those who understand should reflect carefully and observe *[or: contemplate]* them.

The River Worker and the Maiden are numinous and most spirit-like. When fire is applied, they take flight, vanishing without a trace of dust. Dragons and turtles hide, their whereabouts unknown. To restrain them, the Yellow Sprout serves as the root.

All things possess yin and yang; to defy Heaven and oppose the Origin is to leave the Mysterious Female unable to hatch her fledglings. Why is this? Because the union is incomplete, the Three and Five unjoined, hardness and softness sundered. The essence of transformation *[or: the Dao of transformation]* arises from Heaven and Earth’s natural movement: fire ascends, water flows downward—no teacher guides them to be so.

The Origin’s governance is upright and cannot be altered. Observe the mating of male and female: hardness and softness intertwine inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without craft or control. The male is born prone, the female supine, receiving qi from the womb and placenta at the outset—not merely visible at birth. Even in death, they replicate this pattern. Neither parents nor instruction compel them; it is inherent in the union’s fixed arrangement from the beginning.

The Primordial Yang’s flowing pearl ever seeks to depart, but when it encounters the Golden Flower, it turns and follows, transforming into white liquid that congeals into hardness. The Golden Flower takes the lead, and between the nape and neck, it dissolves into water. The horse’s teeth gleam like *banggan* jade, and yang then proceeds to harmonize. Nature and disposition naturally compel restraint; the time of yin’s confinement approaches.

The compassionate mother nurtures, the filial son repays kindness; the stern father issues commands, teaching and instructing descendants. The Five Phases clash and flourish, each claiming dominance to generate fire. Fire’s nature melts metal, metal fells wood, and the Three and Five unite as One. Heaven and Earth’s purest essence can be transmitted orally but not inscribed.

You should turn right at noon, then rotate eastward between *mao* and *you*. The boundaries separate host and guest, the two names: the dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both drink and feed, each coveting the other, until they interlock, swallowing and chewing, devouring one another. Mars guards the west, Venus traverses the heavens—wherever their killing qi descends, what can stand unshaken? Foxes and dogs guard against them, birds and sparrows fear the goshawk, each fulfilling its nature—how dare they make a sound?

Without grasping the principle, one should not speak recklessly. Exhausting family wealth, leaving wives and children hungry and poor, from ancient times to now, countless seekers have failed to succeed. Rare are those who attain it. Seeking widely for famous medicines only leads one astray from the Dao.

Cinnabar and wood essence, when united with metal, form a pair. Where metal and water meet, water and fire become companions. These four merge in chaos, arrayed as dragon and tiger. The dragon is yang, its number odd; the tiger is yin, its number even. The liver, green, is the father; the lungs, white, the mother; the kidneys, black, the child; the heart *[or: *Li* trigram]*, red, the daughter; the spleen, yellow, the ancestor. The Five Phases begin with the child; the Three Things and One Family all return to *wu* and *ji*. Hardness and softness alternate, traversing and distributing.

The dragon resides in the west, the tiger in the east. Establishing the warp of *mao* and *you*, punishment and virtue converge in joyous union. Punishment governs suppression, virtue governs generation. In the second month, the elm’s fruits fall as the *Kui* star descends upon *mao*; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts as the *Tian Gang* star occupies *you*. North and south, child and noon, serve as the guiding principles. The number one-nine concludes and begins anew.

Embracing the Primordial in *Xu* and *Wei*, one disseminates essence at the *zi* hour. Diligently practicing day and night without rest, after three years of consuming the elixir, one soars lightly and travels afar. Unscathed by fire, unmoistened by water, one can preserve or abandon life, ever joyful and free from care. The Dao is accomplished, virtue perfected—one conceals oneself to await the time. The Great One summons, and one relocates to the Central Land. When merit is complete and work ascends, one receives the register and the chart.

If one carefully encounters and perceives its beginnings, using analogy to measure things from start to finish, the Five Phases mutually overcome each other, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids, the father bestows and congeals essence, shaping form. Metal and stone do not decay. If one is meticulous and does not leak, one attains the Dao *[or: attains the upright Dao]*. Erect a pole, and the shadow appears; call into the valley, and the echo responds—how can this not be numinous?

Yet the supreme image of Heaven and Earth, if treated like a wild beast—a mere inch of croton seed, a mere ounce of *ba dou*—once swallowed, leaves one rigid, unable to bend or straighten. At such a moment, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, how could they revive the fallen or restore the dead?

Chen Xianfang said: Wei Jun, fearing that later generations would not grasp the underlying principle, pointed to the ancient sages and worthies who embraced the Mysterious and held fast to the True. Without exception, they consumed the Nine Cauldrons and communicated virtue with the Three Lights, dispelling perversity, preserving uprightness, transforming their forms, and becoming immortals. Pitying those of later times who loved the Dao, he lamented that they would recklessly annotate and practice immortal scriptures, not only failing to perceive the truth themselves but also leading their descendants into delusion. Thus, he grieved deeply and composed this scroll.

The River Maiden of the north, the upright qi transformed into a maiden, takes flight when fire is applied, emerging and vanishing, dragon-like and elusive. Only when the Yellow Sprout is refined can she be subdued—like a child and mother placed in a lapis lazuli bowl, where even divine powers cannot intervene.

Those who attain the heights of my Dao will naturally comprehend it—things possess neither yin nor yang [...]. As Master Zhang Ziyang’s poem states:
*"Do not mistake solitary yin for possessing yang;
Cultivating but one thing only weakens the frail."*

Master Zhongli’s poem declares:
*"Do not claim this body alone is the Dao—
Cultivating but one thing is solitary yin.
Know that the Dao is called ‘one yin, one yang.’
Only after the union of male and female, the essence of the myriad things transformed,
may one speak of the Returned Elixir.
If the two things do not merge, the Three and Five fail to interact,
water and fire remain uncrossed, hardness and softness stand apart—
then yin and yang are severed, Heaven and Earth sealed.
This is what is called ‘partial yin, partial yang’—a malady."*

The Radiant Pearl of Great Yang [...], difficult to describe in writing. Human life resides in the *mao* day: it emerges at *mao*, and the myriad things depend upon it to live. Thus, the myriad things all possess the essence of Great Yang to establish their lives.

The Radiant Pearl of Great Yang is the treasure of life. When this life-treasure lodges in spirit, it drifts restlessly in chaotic thoughts; chaotic thoughts lead it to follow things and transform. When it lodges in essence, it clings to fullness yet proves hard to preserve; hard to preserve, it stirs desires and risks leakage.

Thus it is said: *"Always seek to depart from others."*
Yet few among the world understand this principle.
Even among those who understand, fewer still can preserve it.

Yet the treasure of Great Yang is fundamentally the essence of the Wood-soul. If it meets the Flower of Metal and is subdued thereby, it transforms into a white liquid, congealing into the Yellow Sprout—resembling horse’s teeth or lustrous jade. Confined within the *you* gate, it undergoes transmutation. The method follows the principle of the Five Phases’ mutual consumption: like a father driving his son, like a child returning to its mother, like a mother nurturing her child, like a child repaying its mother’s kindness. Thus, one first employs fire to melt metal, then metal to fell wood—both acts akin to a stern father driving his son. Only then does it transform into water, which is the mother of wood.

Hence it is said: *"The mother nurtures."* Again, it congeals into metal and water, where water is the child of metal. As the child transforms into the mother, it is said: *"The child repays its debt."* The essentials do not exceed the Three, the Five, and the One—these three characters alone. From ancient times to the present, those who truly understand are rare indeed. Without encountering a perfected person to transmit the oral instructions, how could one lightly presume to fathom the celestial mechanism through written words?

O disciple, when you turn to the right—how dare there be sound? You come from the right, turning eastward from *mao*; *wu* comes from the east, revolving westward to *you*—each traversing nine revolutions. Thus, the Dragon emerges from within fire, the Tiger is born from within water. Mars guards the west to restrain metal, while Venus traverses the heavens and appears by day. Naturally, the Dragon calls to the Tiger, the Tiger inhales the Dragon’s essence. The fox borrows the Tiger’s might to restrain the leopard, while the sparrow fears the kestrel that gazes upon the sun. Each attains its function and dares not exhale—all following the principle of the Five Phases’ mutual restraint, which admits no alternative.

Without grasping this principle, one strays far from the Dao. Lacking this understanding, one seeks external medicines in vain, squandering resources. Cinnabar and Wood-essence—all return to *wu-si*. Metal and Wood, *jia* and *geng*, mutually assist in their function, for both hold true earth within. When four parts Metal unite with one part Water, they transform into five parts Earth. When three parts Wood unite with two parts Fire, they too transform into five parts Earth. Though the Dragon of eastern Water and the Tiger of western Metal—three and four, odd and even—are unequal, when divided into three families and united in one dwelling, all return to *wu-si*.

Hard and soft alternate in ascent. From *zi* to *si* is the Qian trigram, hard; from *wu* to *hai* is the Kun trigram, soft. Recognizing this principle of alternation, the Dragon naturally moves west, the Tiger east; *zi* lies south, *wu* north. *Mao* and *you* establish the warp, generating and killing, rising and subduing, each serving as the other’s guiding principle, each attaining its proper time. In the second month, life arises, and the west’s *you* governs it—thus the elm dies and returns to its root. In the eighth month, killing prevails, and the east’s *mao* governs it—thus shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout. Proceeding nine revolutions from west to *mao*, one beholds the south’s *zi*; reversing nine revolutions from east to *you*, one beholds the north’s *xu-wei*. This single ninefold number contains the primordial void of *xu-wei*. Disseminating essence at *zi*, diligently practicing—receiving the register, bearing the chart, persevering day and night without cease—within three years, the Elixir Path is accomplished. Then one may enter and exit fire and water, ascend lightly on distant journeys, transform with numinous efficacy, and roam freely at ease.

Yet once the Dao is achieved and virtue perfected, one must remain concealed among men, accumulating merit and amassing deeds, awaiting the summons of the Primordial Sovereign of Grand Unity. Only then may one ascend to the Central Continent, receive the chart and register, and when merit is complete, ascend bodily to the Purple Palace. This is what is meant by: *"When merit accumulates to three thousand, one becomes an Immortal of the Great Veil; when conduct fulfills eight hundred, one becomes a Guest of the Grand Veil."* The degree of one’s merit and conduct determines the outcome.

If one truly encounters this path and discerns its beginnings, one may seize Heaven and Earth’s creative power, measuring the end and beginning of all things. The Five Phases mutually overcome one another—how could one not grasp this? Once understood, one may hasten death or prolong life. Poison entering the mouth, even sages and worthies cannot revive; an elixir ingested, even ghosts and spirits cannot harm. The marvel of the numinous lies entirely in emptiness and clarity, rooted in the Five Phases’ transformative mechanism, the true body of Great Creation’s arising. Thus, a pole casts a shadow—all is the numinous clarity of spirit-fire; a valley echoes a voice—all is the responsive resonance of spirit-emptiness. Metal and stone endure because they arise from the formless, while lead and mercury are most numinous because they are born of creation. This may be called: *"Within the indistinct, there are things; within the dim and distant, there is essence."* Who but the most numinous under Heaven could comprehend this?

Peng Xiao says: The Wei Duke stated that the Three Sovereigns refined the Nine Cauldrons’ divine elixir, consuming it to nourish essence, cultivate qi, and penetrate the virtue of the Three Luminaries, dissolving form to become spirit-immortals and guests of the Supreme Emperor. Yet pitying later seekers of the Dao—some relying on ancient texts, others gathering fragmentary instructions, offering shallow guidance, revealing branches while concealing roots, falsely attributing their methods to minerals, and confusing the ancestral tradition—he did not reveal the truth, leaving posterity unable to trace its origins. Relying on texts and following whim, they take the false for the true, hoarding their secrets in caskets, leading one another astray. Thus, fortunes are ruined, careers destroyed, and the Dao-heart wasted. Therefore, he recorded this篇, leaving behind concise words easy to ponder, straightforward matters free of entanglement, exposing the core without obscuring it with disorderly phrases—hoping to awaken the uninitiated, directly discussing cinnabar and mercury. The wise, upon careful reflection, will surely grasp its true meaning.

The Maiden of the Yellow River is true mercury. When she sees fire, she soars and leaps like a dragon, vanishing without trace. To restrain her, one must obtain the Yellow Sprout as her mother to nurture and preserve her. The Yellow Sprout is true lead.

All things lack inherent yin and yang. Without their union, there is no fixed beginning or restraint. The *Yi* says: *"One yin, one yang—this is called the Dao."* Between Heaven and Earth, if yin and yang are separated, the myriad things cannot exist. Solitary yin or solitary yang cannot generate or complete anything. Thus, in the workings of the divine medicine, if the Three and Five remain unconnected, if Metal and Wood do not interact, how can the Elixir be formed?

Fire flames upward, water moistens downward—both are natural tendencies. When properly matched and cultivated, they naturally produce their essence and spirit, for each receives the primordial qi, and their natures are thus determined. For instance, a male is born facing downward and dies in the same posture; a female is born facing upward and dies likewise. Thus, from the union of male and female, true essence is inherited.

The Radiant Pearl of Great Yang is the coalescence of earthly and heavenly qi into a pearl-like dew—pure yang essence and qi, capable of generating the myriad things. Though it possesses qi, it lacks form, hence it is called the Red Dragon. Yang fire transforms qi into cinnabar; fire engenders earth, earth engenders metal. Metal is the mystery of Great Yin, capable of nurturing the myriad things. Though it possesses qi and substance, it is called the Flower of Metal.

The Red Dragon originates in the Wood phase of Jia and Yi, also called the Azure Dragon—yang, father, husband, and fire. The Flower of Metal resides in the Metal phase of Geng and Xin, also called the White Tiger—yin, mother, wife, and water. This is the meaning of the Azure Dragon and White Tiger. Alternatively, when yin and yang are inverted and the Five Phases mutually interact, male and female alternately become husband and wife, which is the same principle. As the *Song of the Supreme White Realized One* states:

*"The Five Phases inverted—art of reversal—
The dragon emerges from fire’s core.
The Five Phases unaligned—path askew—
The tiger arises from water’s store.
The root of Returned Cinnabar,
The ancestor of Dragon and Tiger:
The dragon from fire is born,
The tiger from water is bred—
These words are immutable."*

The Metal Wife first intones, the Water Husband sows his essence; the Divine Mother conceives and gives birth to the Maiden of Cinnabar. As the Maiden grows, her transformations are manifold: she may dissolve into water or take the form of horse-teeth jade. Though the Metal Mother arises from water, amid her transformations, the watery essence never ceases. When yang moves to harmonize, their natures naturally align—this is the mutual generation of Metal and Mercury.

When urgency presses, yin constrains and the Gate of Prohibition is sealed—this is the operation of yin qi, providing sustenance and defense within the Inner Palace. The Compassionate Mother nurtures, and the Filial Son repays her kindness: the Compassionate Mother is the inner embryo, the Filial Son the true Mercury. As the *Song of the True Yin Sovereign* states: *"Yang is true cinnabar, yin is true mercury."* Since Mercury is born of the Metal Mother, this is called repaying kindness.

Their mutual devouring is the exchange of qi between Dragon and Tiger. The Stern Father issues commands, instructing his descendants: the Qian trigram is the Father, ordering the hexagrams to assist in rotation—the Li Maiden, the Kan Male, and the Five Phases together generate the Mercury and Cinnabar offspring. Returned Cinnabar takes "Lead" and "Fire" as its ancestral principles, governing all operations from beginning to end. The remaining qi, temporal markers, and symbolic tokens serve as aids in establishing the divine foundation. Beyond this lies not the Way of Golden Liquor Returned Cinnabar.

Fire can melt Metal, yet Fire is born of Wood, and Metal in turn restrains Wood—thus Metal and Wood reverse their restraints to achieve harmony. An ancient song says:

*"Cinnabar and Water Essence unite with Metal,"*
and also:
*"When the Three Natures converge,
The Two Flavors naturally bind,
The embryo is secured, no leakage occurs,
Transformation transpires in an instant."*

The Three Natures are Fire, Metal, and Water; the Two Flavors are Lead and Mercury, Dragon and Tiger. Thus it is said: *"The Three, the Five, and the One—these are the supreme essences of Heaven and Earth."* Such wondrous principles are difficult to record—how could they be lightly discussed with the uninitiated?

The annotation "alternately becoming male and female" refers to the Divine Water restraining Fire, yet within the Divine Chamber, Fire in turn restrains Metal. Mercury is water within Metal, Metal is cinnabar within water—cinnabar generates Mercury, Metal generates water.

The Child should turn right—how dare it make a sound? The Child turns right to You; Wu rotates eastward to Mao. These twelve earthly branches follow the cyclic return of yin and yang, aligning with the fire phases. Mao and You mark the boundary where Metal and Water qi balance. The Host and Guest are designations for Metal and Wood.

When the Azure Dragon exhales qi, the White Tiger inhales essence; essence and qi intermingle, generating pure perfection. *Yinghuo* (Mars) represents the extreme yang fire number. Guarding the West means fire qi presses upon the Metal embryo. When Metal receives the fullness of fire, its radiance illuminates the vessel’s interior. Metal qi, borne by fire, traverses the heavens—thus it is said: *"When the killing qi descends, how could it not topple?"* Then the True Lead of the Maiden of Cinnabar dare not flee, like a cat seizing a mouse or a sparrow fearing the hawk.

*Taibai* (Venus) is the essence of Metal; "traversing the heavens" refers to Jia and Yi. Metal, Fire, and Wood alternately restrain one another, yet none are harmed—each achieves success, and no discordant sounds arise. Without grasping the principle, one strays far from the Dao. As Master Wei said: *"Without understanding the principle of Golden Liquor Returned Cinnabar, one must not act recklessly, wasting wealth and burdening wife and children."* From ancient times to the present, countless seekers of the Dao—numbering in the millions—have failed to meet a true teacher or encounter authentic instructions, ultimately achieving nothing.

*"Cinnabar and Wood Essence—
All return to Wu and Si."*

Cinnabar originally returns to the Metal embryo to coalesce, while Mercury is Metal refined by fire, producing cinnabar—thus cinnabar is able to merge with Metal. Metal and Wood transform themselves; Water and Fire mutually operate. The four intermingle within, as Dragon and Tiger traverse yin and yang, odd and even numbers, ascending and descending day and night.

The Liver, green, is the Father: Jia and Yi govern Fire and unite with the Metal Mother, hence the name "Father." The Lungs, white, are the Mother: the Metal Mother resides within the embryo, constantly using Fire as her tally, hence the name "Mother." The Kidneys, black, are the Child: the Metal Mother is born from Water, yet within the crucible, Water in turn generates Metal—thus it is the Water Child. The Water Child, number one, is the beginning of the Five Phases. Metal, Fire, and Wood share the same function, their transformations all converging in Wu and Si—thus the Spleen, yellow, is the ancestor of the medicine.

Hard and soft alternate in ascent; essence is sown into the Child Water. Fire and Water alternate in ascent, traversing and circulating through the twelve earthly branches. Dragon and Tiger divide at Mao and You; yin punishment and yang virtue rise and fall. When punishment and virtue meet, they mutually restrain and harmonize—hence it is said: *"Behold the joy!"*

In the second month, the elm scatters its pods: from Zi, fire advances to Mao. Though yang qi prevails, it has not yet reached pure yang, and residual yin remains—thus within yang lies yin, and it suffers punishment. Yin steals yang qi, causing the elm to shed its pods in the mid-spring month of growth.

In the eighth month, wheat sprouts: from Wu, yin tally retreats to You. Though yin qi prevails, it has not yet reached pure yin, and residual yang remains—thus within yin lies yang, and it receives virtue. Yang steals yin qi, causing wheat to sprout in the mid-autumn month of withering.

This analogy illustrates how, within the crucible, the Metal Mother, amid the waxing and waning of yin and yang, either contracts or expands her true essence, or causes the Mercury offspring to scatter. The South (Zi) contains yang within yin, symbolizing the Kan Male; the North (Wu) contains yin within yang, symbolizing the Li Maiden.

The number one is yin; the number nine is yang.

The beginning and end of yin and yang serve as the function of the elixir; primordial qi generates the void and peril, and yang qi once more sows essence into the Zi to give birth to true numen. Diligently practice this—when you have attained the register and received the chart, devote yourself day and night to unceasing cultivation. Once the elixir is completed, consume it for three years, and you will ascend to wander afar, untouched by water or fire, able to sit or stand at will, to live or die as you choose. Secretly perform hidden virtues, conceal yourself, and await the hour when the Great One summons you to dwell in the Central Land. Count the days until your ascension, when you receive the register and chart.

The Great One is the master overseer of the refined elixir; the Central Land is the Divine Land. When worldly people first attain the Dao, their names are engraved on golden tablets in this land, and upon receiving the chart and register, they ascend. If one truly encounters this and examines the beginning and end of things, and having received oral transmission, perceives its signs, then taking up the crucible to refine it will ensure success from beginning to end.

The five phases overcome one another, then rise again in sequence, driving and cycling. The five phases generate and overcome one another, alternately serving as father and mother, mutually acting as husband and wife. Father and mother bequeath to one another, giving birth to yin and yang, which depend on each other to establish the foundation and together form the immortal elixir. If one obtains this, one should guard it closely to perfect the Dao.

If even setting up a pole casts a shadow, and an echo answers in an empty valley, or if wild herbs entering the mouth can produce immediate effects, how much more so the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir? Chen Zhixu said: The ancient sages and great worthies necessarily understood the supreme Dao, which is why the books of Fuxi, Shennong, and the Yellow Emperor all speak of the great Dao. Thus, the Yellow Emperor refined the Nine Cauldrons’ great elixir at Mount Dinghu, rode a dragon to ascend, and this was not a matter of burning and refining metals, stones, herbs, or trees. Rather, it was about subduing the primordial qi to form the elixir. Thus, it is called "subduing and refining," not "consuming and refining." (The scripture speaks of consuming and refining.)

What is called "subduing and refining" involves various practices: embracing the mysterious and holding the true, transforming traces and concealing like a submerged dragon, containing essence and nurturing spirit, and connecting virtue with the Three Lights. Of these seven, the first matters must be practiced—this is called "furnace and fire," which refers to refining the self. If one can refine the self, true qi will steam and pervade the entire body, like fire in a furnace warming it—hence it is called "furnace and fire," and thus "refining the self."

When the fluids, interstices, sinews, and bones become firm, all evil is expelled, and upright qi abides long—these four are called "subduing qi," which is refining the elixir. "Embracing the mysterious" means internally holding the unified qi of the mysterious; "holding the true" means carrying the true essence of the Great One. "Transforming traces" means concealing one’s light and hiding one’s tracks so that others do not know me, and those who do are few, making me precious. "Concealing like a submerged dragon" means sinking and hiding so that others cannot recognize me. Thus, the ancients who were adept at being scholars guarded the mysterious and penetrated the profound, making themselves unrecognizable. "Containing essence" means encompassing the true essence of mercury to refine the self; "nurturing spirit" means externally nurturing the spirit of the entire body to harmonize with qi. Accumulating merit to this point is the great essential of connecting virtue with the Three Lights.

Virtue is the highest matter in cultivating the Dao. To cultivate the Dao without cultivating virtue is to have yin without yang; only when virtue and Dao are both cultivated do yin and yang naturally pair. If one cultivates virtue while claiming to have it but in truth does not, this is due to deluded thoughts, and virtue will not resonate. For those who cultivate the Dao, the deeper their virtue, the less they think of it. Heaven and earth, gods and spirits, sun, moon, and stars—all respond to virtue. Like Zhang Guo and Xu You, who accumulated and cultivated virtue from the heart without seeking it, this is what is meant by connecting virtue with the Three Lights.

Once refining the self is diligent and virtue resonates, one may subdue and refine the great elixir. The fluids and interstices: fluids are jade fluids, which are white snow; liquids are golden liquor, which is yellow sprouts. When jade fluids and golden liquor fill the chamber of spirit, the sinews and bones of the entire body become firm. All evil—all the yin of the hundred bones—is expelled, and upright qi, the primordial yang, abides long and unharmed. Accumulating this over time transforms the body into that of an immortal. This is what the Yellow Emperor’s refining of the Nine Cauldrons’ great elixir refers to.

The *Record of Auspicious Meetings* states: In his first life, the Xuanyuan clan served as commoners; in his second, as ministers; in his third, as sovereigns. Having accumulated merit to its fullest, they ascended to heaven. Pitying later students who loved the Dao, they followed their example, drawing and composing charts and texts to instruct later generations. Some revealed branches while concealing roots, or adopted various names to obscure the truth among the masses of texts. What was revealed was only a rough outline, such as "Qian and Kun are the gate of the *Changes*." As for the roots, they necessarily relied on oral transmission, hence they were concealed like submerged dragons.

What is called "adopting names to obscure" means that what could not be made explicit was metaphorically scattered among various books. Later, those with clear eyes, having obtained the texts but not met the master, kept them in a casket for their entire lives. Only those who are vessels of the Dao, like Gongsun and his successors, can succeed. Some students, though they record these texts, lack a teacher’s guidance and become confused, leading others astray into deviant paths. They do not understand yin and yang, confuse the five phases, and rush about aimlessly.

Later followers of the Dao who rely solely on these texts without oral instructions are like scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants who have lost their livelihoods: officials seeking office have no path to the register, farmers wishing to till have no land to plow, artisans holding skills have no means to apply them, and merchants calculating profits have lost their capital. Just so, students who possess the texts but lack a teacher’s instructions have no starting point, and their wild guesses and reckless actions cannot lead to the Dao.

The immortal sages, pitying this, refined the furnace and opened the *Dinglu*, making this text a model for ten thousand generations. Its words are concise, its meaning easy to ponder; its matters are few, its principles not cumbersome. Its clauses are laid out, its essentials verified, making it easy to peruse. Within it, numbers and weights all have their methods. With a teacher’s single instruction, following and practicing this can lead to the completion of the elixir. What appears as disordered words is the meaning of "adopting names to obscure." What seems like holes and apertures encompasses the profound mystery, serving as the ladder to the great sea and the torch for the dimly lit path. Later sages and secondary worthies should carefully consider and use it with caution.

Only the sage can understand the great Dao; only the worthy can speak of it. Thus, a father cannot transmit it to his son, nor a minister present it to his lord. Is the Dao of the sages not to be transmitted? It is feared that without virtue, one cannot bear it, and if spoken lightly, one may later stumble—hence the wise carefully consider and observe.

The River Maid on the banks—here, the river is a metaphor for the river of love and sea of desire; the maiden is one’s own yin essence of mercury. Why is she called numinous and most divine? Because she can give life to people, but also kill them, and she can unite to form the elixir. When she is utterly still and unmoving, a single numen is nurtured within. Suddenly, she responds and connects, rushing like a spirit. When emotions move, fortune is born from form; when intent is corrupted, mercury chases fire and flies away like dust, never to be retrieved. The dragon hides its essence, the clouds scatter, and the sky is empty—emptiness is form. To control her, the yellow sprout serves as the root. The maiden, if followed, is easily lost; without the one yang of the yellow sprout, she cannot be subdued.

The yellow sprout is the primordial qi, called the true lead of the One. Burning this lead qi as the foundation, mercury will not flee. Why?

The pairing of yin and yang makes it so. If things lacked yin and yang, they would defy the heavens of creation and turn their backs on the origin of life. Those who refine the elixir do not depart from yin and yang in establishing their foundation. Once the true qi of the One has returned and the elixir is fully ripened, only then can one leap beyond yin and yang. The foolish people of the world, not having studied the elixir classics, claim that cultivators must dwell in deep mountains, must first live in solitude, must abandon wives and children, must practice grain avoidance, must embrace non-action, and must engage in seated meditation—these are their ways. How foolish! Without employing yin and yang, without investigating the five phases, without distinguishing metal and wood, without knowing dragon and tiger, without recognizing lead and mercury, without understanding kan and li, merely relying on silence—how can one attain the Dao? Thus, this book vigorously corrects such errors, repeatedly stating that only the matching of yin and yang can be called the Dao. Just as a hen, without a rooster, may brood over eggs, but no chicks will hatch—this is solitary yin without yang. If one wishes to hatch chicks, one must place water in a vessel at noon and expose it to the sun to warm it, borrowing yang qi so the chicks may fully form. Without this warmth, they will not come to life. Why is this so? It is like the workings of creation: without the union of the Three and Five, without the intercourse of hardness and softness, how can the generative Dao be fulfilled? Thus, in the Land of Women, where no men exist, if they wish to conceive, they must choose an auspicious day and, three times daily, gaze into the well’s depths to borrow the qi of true water. Observing the reflection in the well, they engage in sympathetic resonance to become pregnant. This is the essence of yin and yang’s transformative power, the natural mutual resonance of heaven and earth. Fire flames upward, water moistens downward—without a teacher’s guidance, how could this be so? The origin is governed by the unifying qi, already settled. The *Yijing* says: "Great indeed is the primal qi of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it; it governs heaven." The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each fulfilling its nature and destiny. Once nature and destiny are settled, how can they be altered again? Thus, observe the moment when male and female mate: hardness and softness intertwine inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm. Without artificial control, the male naturally lies prone while the female arches her body—these are the utmost principles of creation, which not even the workings of nature can alter. How much more so in life? Even those who drown must die with the male prone and the female arched—this is not taught by parents but is determined at the moment of union. Common scholars may find such words trivial, but the intent of this book is to make people thoroughly understand the principles of yin and yang, hence the repetition is not tiresome.

The "flowing pearl of the Great Yang" [至] deviates from the Dao. This passage clearly designates the flowing pearl and golden radiance as the two entities of yin and yang, further revealing the secrets of refinement to prevent leakage—this is most detailed and precise. As for the oral instructions, they are difficult to record in writing.

Master Gongyang reiterated this meaning in a gatha:

The flowing pearl of the Great Yang is the sun within Li,
The maiden of Li Palace is neither form nor beauty.
The bright dragon of the Great Yang is truly called the dry father,
Within cinnabar lies mercury, mercury is the ancestor of cinnabar.
People, led astray by the six thieves,
Carve and chisel, causing the flowing pearl to drip [like a dragon’s saliva] or flee.
Metal originally dwells in Dui, lodging in Kan to generate radiance.
The true water of Kan can then restrain the cinnabar of Li.
Mercury, subdued by metal and water, transforms into a white liquid.
When refined in due time, metal returns to its former state, first spitting forth radiance.
The true earth of *jisi* must be spiritually potent;
The earth spirit surges, a jade platform ascends to the high seat.
Exposed to the sun, the soles of the feet are guarded.
Golden radiance transforms into water, its color like horse-teeth stalactites,
Resembling *banggan* jade.
The dry yang becomes the guest, seeking the host.
Yang’s nature, yin’s disposition—harmonious [熙] and intertwined.
Yin is pressed by yang, yang is urged by yin.
They urge and press each other, yin restrained and nurtured
Within the two kidneys, called the Gate of Prohibition.
One yin, one yang; one Qian, one Kun.
The compassionate mother says: "Metal."
Metal generates the water of Kan—water is the filial son of metal.
The stern father says: "Wood."
Wood generates cinnabar-mercury—the son begets a grandson.
The grandson’s descendants, if not single-minded and strict,
Will issue commands chaotically, the five phases misruling in inversion.
Lead and mercury, cinnabar and silver, rely on earth.
Fire flourishes, generating earth; earth is the mother of metal.
Fire reigns, melting metal; wood fears metal’s punishment.
Metal, felled by fire, allows wood to flourish.
In the southeast, five parts wood, three parts fire;
In the northwest, five parts water, one part metal, four parts earth.
At the center, *wu* and *si*—this is the number of the Three and Five.
From one to ten thousand, through countless eons, the numbers align with heaven and earth.
The utmost essence responds—this responds to that, uniting.
The oral instructions must clarify: the child should turn right.
Whether halting or hastening, yang metal is born at *zi* and *wu*, thus rotating eastward.
Yin mercury is born at *wu*, embracing and securing yang essence.
*Mao* and *you* govern east and west, host and guest.
The two names, metal and wood, though separated by ten thousand miles,
Cherish benevolence and virtue—metal follows wood’s joy.
Dragon calls, tiger inhales; metal yearns for wood.
Benevolence is the host, one guest, one host—eating and drinking in kinship.
One crow, one rabbit, both covetous,
Like a man and woman, mutually swallowing and gulping,
Like a *chī* and a snake, chewing and devouring each other.
The spirit of the south, the Vermilion Bird, guards the west with fiery brilliance,
Refining metal’s virtue, the killing power of Dui.
Be cautious, do not err.
Containing and storing the qi of life,
It is said: "The Great White traverses the Yellow Path,
Returning faithfully to Qian’s gate."
When the killing qi arrives, the qi of life naturally spreads,
Like a cat catching a mouse, like a sparrow fearing the *zhān*—
Each fulfills its function, how dare they make a sound?
Without the oral instructions, how can one guess?
Wasting family wealth, pursuing heterodox paths and crooked byways,
Engaging in sexual arts, misleading the true and deceiving the earnest—
The weight of sin is great, who would spare another’s poverty?
From ancient times to now, countless have sought this,
Yet few meet true teachers, and even fewer succeed.
Without understanding yin and yang, how can one be like the vast multitude
Seeking famous medicines, only to deplete the true?
True qi, metals, minerals, herbs, and trees—
These are not the multitude, they are without feeling, far from the Dao,
Separated by ten thousand miles.
The methods for later learners are outlined in general,
Expounding and clarifying the profound classics,
To become immortals and true elixirs.
Cinnabar and wood essence [至] all return to *wu-si*.

The most numinous and precious treasures of the human body are essence and qi.
The *Heart Seal Scripture* regards them as the work and medicine,
Zhang Ziyang regards them as the treasure of life.
The books composed by immortals share similarities yet differ.
What is the similarity? When metal returns to nature, only then is it called the returned elixir—this is the simplest and most shared point.
What are the differences? Qian and Kun, Kan and Li; the female and male, the bellows and key; opening and closing; non-being and being; yin and yang; sun and moon; the Mysterious Female and *wu-si*; hardness and softness; female and male; the pivot of the Dipper and the handle of the Northern Dipper; the crow and rabbit; hun and po; metal qi and spirit brightness; the yellow sprout and the river chariot; lead and silver; cinnabar and mercury; floating and sinking; white and black; the Primordial Chaos and the indistinct; the compass within and the pivot; emptiness and the obscure; the true person and the great abyss; the walls and gates; Penglai and the Vermilion Bird; the *chī* and snake; the White Tiger and the Green Dragon; the pivot of refinement and the flowing pearl; golden cinnabar and mercury; the eight minerals and yellow earth; the two orifices and the dwelling of spiritual virtue; the crescent moon furnace and the suspended embryo cauldron; the red-colored gate and the bright window’s dust; the upper and lower *nuan*; civil and martial fire; cinnabar and wood essence; the river work and the maiden; the walled city; horse-teeth stalactites and *banggan* jade; the Gate of Prohibition and the knife-point; golden radiance and autumn stone; temperament and nature; host and guest; white snow and yellow sprouts; the Mysterious Ditch and the River Drum; Mount Zeng and the faint shadow; stalactites and the blue-green liquid; the Three and Five and the two sevens; weights and measures; hexagrams and tally marks—
Such names and forms are all treasures within the body.
Some are metaphors for gates and doors, some refer to the chamber of the spirit,
Some denote the cauldron and vessel, some compare function and application,
Some mix shapes and images, some liken advance and retreat.
Thus, the *Yijing* uses Qian’s straightness and Kun’s breadth as the gates of life and death.
The elixir method uses the Magpie Bridge and the Yellow Path as the routes of coming and going—
Yet all do not depart from the body’s essence and qi.

These employ borrowed names and variant characters—thus, when it speaks of cinnabar and the essence of wood, it obtains metal and merges with the preceding "flowing pearl of Grand Yang." The meaning remains consistent: the flowing pearl, the maiden, and cinnabar all inherently possess yin yet lack yang, belonging to the posterior heaven and thus unable to form the elixir. Metal, the yellow sprout, and golden radiance are the lead of prior heaven, which can refine the returned elixir. Therefore, cinnabar and the essence of wood are the mercury within *li*, the father of fire, the wood of eastward *jia-yi* that engenders its essence—this is the central maiden. Thus, the wood of eastward *jia-yi* and the fire of southward *bing-ding* are one father and one daughter. The father and his daughter, being yang within yin, make *zhen*-wood and *li*-fire their companions. The yellow sprout and golden liquid are the lead within *kan*, the mother of water, the metal of westward *geng-xin* that conceives its liquid—this is the central son. Thus, the metal of westward *geng-xin* and the water of northward *ren-gui* are one mother and one son. The mother and her son, being yin within yang, unite *dui*-metal and *kan*-water in their dwelling. Wood, fire, metal, and water—these four, arrayed in primordial chaos, become dragon and tiger, one to the east and one to the west. The dragon dwells in the east, its number three, hence called the odd yang number of the dragon; the tiger belongs to the west, its number four, hence called the even yin number of the tiger. That wood and fire are companions means the dragon emerges from within fire; that metal and water unite means the tiger is born within water. The liver, green and belonging to wood, is the father of fire; the lungs, white and belonging to metal, are the mother of water; the kidneys, black and belonging to water, are the son of metal; *li*, red and belonging to fire, is the daughter of wood; the spleen, yellow and belonging to earth, is the ancestor of the four. The son resides at the inception of the five phases, thus is the chief of the single yang. Metal and water, water and fire, dragon and tiger—these are called the three substances. When these three substances converge and act as one household, they must rely on the power of the two earths, *wu* and *si*, to accomplish their function.

Hard and soft alternate in ascent—when essence is sown into the child, the green dragon belongs to the east and the white tiger to the west: this is their proper alignment. Yet when distributed further, the green dragon establishes its weft in the west, and the white tiger establishes its weft in the east. Here, punishment and virtue converge, and dragon and tiger rejoice in their inversion, meeting face-to-face. When dragon and tiger meet and unite in one place, the two substances rejoice, governing life as their virtue. If the dragon remains in the east and the tiger in the west, each fixed in its own position of generation and flourishing, the two substances contend and disturb, governing killing as their punishment. Punishment signifies the discord of yin and yang, the metaphor of male and female meeting; virtue signifies the inversion of the five phases, while punishment signifies their sequential progression. Punishment arises when yin diminishes yang; virtue arises when yang harmonizes with yin. Punishment occurs when yin is abundant and yang scarce; virtue occurs when yin is scarce and yang abundant. For instance, the hexagram of the second month has four yang and two yin: as yang grows and yin recedes, though yang is abundant, it remains in excess. Abundant yang constitutes virtue, while excess yin governs killing. Thus, in the three springs, the myriad things flourish, yet the elm’s pods fall—just as in humans. In the prime of life, when yang is abundant and yin scarce, one grows stronger day by day. Yet at this time, desire-fire blazes fiercely; though yang is abundant, it is consumed by yin. Even with excess yang, it cannot govern, and the hundred diseases assail. As yang nears depletion, one’s thoughts remain bound to the realm of desire, exhausting all effort to seek yin. Excess yang encounters yin and is entirely consumed, leading to sudden demise—this is virtue reversed into punishment.

Yet if one of superior wisdom seizes the remaining yang as a stepping-stone and swiftly practices the Way of the returned elixir, one may restore long life—this is the joint defense of punishment and virtue, the joy of mutual encounter. Conversely, the hexagram of the eighth month has four yin and two yang: as yang is consumed by yin, though yin is abundant, some yang remains. Abundant yin constitutes punishment, while residual yang governs life. Thus, in the three autumns, the myriad things wither, yet shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout—just as in humans. When one nears sixty-one, with yin abundant and yang scarce, one declines day by day. Yet if at this time one possesses residual yang and practices the golden elixir’s Way, one may restore yang—this is returning to youth and longevity, punishment reversed into virtue.

At the hour of *zi* in the second month, the Dipper’s *kui* star aligns with the *mao* position, while the *gang* star rests above *ji*—this orientation belongs to the southeast, governs life, and embodies virtue. At the hour of *xu* in the eighth month, the Dipper’s *gang* star occupies the *you* region, and the *kui* star aligns with *hai*—this orientation lies in the northwest, governs killing, and embodies punishment. The classics state: when the *gang* star points to *chou*, its body resides in *wei*; what it points to is auspicious, while its location is inauspicious—this principle applies to all positions. This analogy illustrates the function of elixir-refining.

*Zi* to the south and *wu* to the north invert the Five Phases. The immortals and sages declare: when the Five Phases flow in sequence, they become the fiery pit of the *dharmadhātu*; when inverted, they yield the seven treasures of the great earth. Thus, only when water and fire serve as mutual regulators can the *Completion* be achieved.

Yang arises from one and culminates at nine; when yang’s number reaches nine, it reaches its limit and returns to one—this is the cycle of one and nine, ending and beginning anew. The *Xu* and *Wei* lodges sow essence at *zi*—the divine work of the elixir lies in these two lines. For *Xu* and *Wei* are the day after the conjunction of sun and moon, the place where the first yang stirs, the coiled serpent’s knot—hence the *Taiyi* contains the primordial qi of precelestial origin. When true essence encounters *zi*, it is sown; this echoes the earlier principle of *zi-wu* circulation.

Ordinary people hear only of *mao* and *you* as the bathing phase, yet how can they grasp the analogy of punishment and virtue? Virtue and life parallel the moment of obtaining the medicine, while punishment and killing signify its instantaneous loss. Thus, when entering the chamber, one must guard against danger and contemplate peril—only then can the elixir be refined. The immortal elder likens this to the flourishing of spring, when all things grow, yet the elm’s pods wither: within virtue, one guards against punishment; within life, one guards against killing. In the solemnity of autumn, all things wither, yet shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout: within punishment lies virtue, and within killing lies life.

This text discusses these matters with utmost clarity, illuminating its central intent: to obtain the precelestial qi. If one carefully discerns and encounters the *return*, one may rise and drive it forth—this means that when meeting a teacher, one must first examine their origins: are they upright or perverse? Compare this with the *Cantong Qi*; if they are a true master, they will answer without ignorance, leaving no doubt. If they are a blind teacher, they will know nothing of ten things in nine, fabricating strange tales to lure people into the weeds—some claim silence is the Dao, others insist on sitting in meditation and observing emptiness. Ask them about cinnabar and mercury, dragon and tiger, metal and wood, the separation of the three days, or the inversion of the *Zhen* trigram’s precelestial use, and they will fall silent, unable to respond. Foolish worldly people hear only that someone has sat in meditation for years or entered seclusion in several places, and they clamor that such a person possesses the Dao—how would they know of Mazu’s rebuke of Nanyue for polishing a tile? How would they comprehend the principles of yin-yang’s mutual devouring and the dynamics of life and killing?

There are also vulgar sorts who parrot others’ words, wielding sharp Zen wit and debating endlessly, calling this the "Nature School" and claiming it as the Dao to deceive the world—how laughable! What do they know of Zen or nature?

What is nature? It is *qian* in its ninth line, dynamic and direct. If one fully realizes this, it is the *True Dharma Eye Treasury*. What is Zen? It is *kun* in its sixth line, dynamic and expansive. If one knows this, it is the *wondrous mind of Nirvana*. When Zen and nature unite, earth restrains lead; when metal and wood interact, lead subdues mercury. Benevolence and righteousness are applied to nurture directly—thus, the alternation of yin and yang is the Dao of the *Yi*. Cultivating concentration in the *Li* palace is the essence of Zen; seeking the mysterious elixir in the watery abode is the safeguard of the Dao. Though their names differ, the three teachings are ultimately one. Observe the methods of cultivation in the three teachings: all require the same foundation to succeed—this is what is meant by "comparing with the same standard."

What does it mean to measure the beginning and end of things? One must assess the causes of human and natural life, the waxing and waning of yin and yang. Thus, the Five Phases generate and overcome one another, flourishing and declining in endless alternation—this is the Dao practiced by parents and the highest sages, nothing more than yin and yang. That which governs the storage and nurturing of generative fluids is *kun* and *dui*, alternating to become the Holy Mother. That which governs the marvel of bestowing and completing life is *qian* and *zhen*, alternating to become the Numinous Father. Qi and fluids congeal into essence, flowing to form the elixir—firm as metal and stone, imperishable.

Careful examination and single-minded focus prevent leakage, enabling the attainment of the Dao. Like standing a hundred-foot pole to see its shadow, or calling into a thousand-peak valley to hear its echo, yin and yang naturally resonate and interact, most efficaciously aligning with the supreme image of heaven and earth’s creation. Even the wild *yedu* and croton—mindless plants—can kill; though King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, Confucius, the various sages, Bian Que the divine physician, Wu Xian the wise diviner, and the acupuncture and prayer masters were all great, they could not cure their poison. How much more, then, when the true yin and true yang—sentient beings of the same standard—unite, can they fail to congeal the numinous elixir?

Yu Yan said: Laozi said, "Concentrate your qi to attain suppleness, able to be like an infant"—this is the meaning of embracing the mysterious and holding the true. The nine cycles of the nine tripods’ firing times are the nine transformations. The sages of old, without seeing or hearing, embraced the spirit in stillness; when the nine cycles of firing times were complete, they transformed and roamed freely, riding the void and soaring through the space between heaven and earth.

Those who contain essence do not externally exhaust their bodies; those who nurture spirit do not internally strain their minds and wills. With prolonged effort and deep practice, spirit is stored within, harmonious qi fills and overflows, and the hundred bones and myriad orifices are all unobstructed—naturally flowing like the Milky Way. The three *yuan*—upper, middle, and lower *dantian*—when primordial qi is preserved, primordial essence is produced, blood transforms into marrow, and fills the space between the skin.

Refining essence is most critical for filling the brain, for the brain is the sea of marrow. When the brain’s marrow is full, pure yang flows and fills all the marrow; then the bones are solid, the sinews strong, and one is forever free from the worries of cold and heat. Those who cultivate and attain long life do so by stealing the upright qi of heaven and earth. The ability to steal this upright qi arises from their breathing: exhalation reaches the root, inhalation reaches the stem, returning to the *dantian* and residing there continuously.

Yet the Dao cannot be attained in a single step—it must be accumulated through the refinement of essence and the accumulation of qi. Thus, after the initial moment of embryo formation, a hundred days bring spiritual efficacy, ten months complete the gestation, one year achieves minor success, three years major success, and after nine years of full accomplishment, all worldly affairs are exhausted—then one can transcend time, stand alone, grow feathers, and ascend as an immortal.

It is also said: one year in heaven is like one breath in humans. After the winter solstice comes exhalation; after the summer solstice comes inhalation—this is the yearly breath of heaven and earth.

After midnight comes exhalation; after noon comes inhalation—this is the daily breath of the human body. In one day, the human body has thirteen thousand five hundred exhalations and thirteen thousand five hundred inhalations. Each exhalation and inhalation constitutes one breath, and within each breath, one subtly seizes the movement of heaven, which corresponds to thirteen thousand five hundred years. In one year, there are three hundred sixty days and four million eighty-six thousand breaths, subtly seizing the movement of heaven over four million eighty-six thousand years. Thus, the turbid body is entirely transformed into a body of pure yang. First, the qi is altered; next, the blood; then the vessels, flesh, marrow, sinews, bones, hair, and finally the form. After nine years, nine transformations are completed. Only then is all yin qi refined away, transforming into pure yang, and one’s years become equal to those of heaven and earth—this is the Dao of long life and transcendence.

The *Yi Jing* states: "The Dao of heaven moves with vigor; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens the self." The *Yin Fu Jing* says: "Observe the Dao of heaven and grasp the movement of heaven." Alas, it is all here!

The *Zhi Xuan Pian* says: "Those who seek immortality but do not recognize true lead and mercury idly read thousands of volumes of alchemical texts." For the so-called lead and mercury in alchemical texts are all metaphors. It is for the learner to expand upon them through personal realization—one should not abandon the body to seek externally.

Only the ancient sages and worthies, pitying later generations of Dao-seeking scholars who could not grasp the teachings, thus gathered peripheral insights, illustrated ancient texts, and composed diagrams and books to guide them. Their true intention was to provide seekers with a path to trace back to the source. Yet in their writings, they often concealed the root, refusing to speak plainly, instead using the names of the five metals and eight minerals as codes to reveal only the branches. Later generations, failing to investigate deeply, merely stored these texts away, remaining confused for life, even passing this bewilderment to their descendants. They exhausted cinnabar and mercury in vain, achieving nothing. Thus, officials abandoned their posts, farmers neglected their fields, merchants lost their livelihoods, and scholars had no means to sustain themselves—how lamentable!

Master Wei thus composed the *Cantong Qi*, a book in which every measure and number is precise, not a single word carelessly uttered. Following its sequence without deviation, not a single character is superfluous. When its branches and leaves are unfolded, the core is immediately revealed—its words are concise, its meaning easy to ponder, and its affairs unburdened by complexity.

Some may see its three chapters as excessive, suspecting redundancy. Yet the three chapters are but one phrase. A single oral formula is dispersed throughout the three chapters, its words deliberately disordered and its gates concealed, lest the secret be fully disclosed. Those of wisdom, if they carefully ponder and contemplate its meaning, will surely awaken to the truth.

The true mercury arises from *li* (☲, the south), which is feminine and resides in *wu* (the seventh earthly branch, noon). By regional division, *wu* corresponds to the Three Rivers, hence it is called the "maiden of the river." Investigating its origin, it is obtained through emptying the heart and concentrating the spirit. Since it emerges from one’s own heart, it is called "spirit-mercury" or "divine mercury." Its nature is fierce and violent—when exposed to fire, it flees without a trace, like a dragon or serpent vanishing into hiding, its whereabouts unknown. Without the yellow sprout as its root, how could it be restrained? The yellow sprout is true lead.

Only when mercury obtains true lead can it be captured, restrained, and bound, thereafter unable to flee. This is why it is used as the root of the golden elixir. The Dao is spoken of as the union of one yin and one yang; an excess of either yin or yang is called illness. For example, if a hen lays eggs without a rooster, there will surely be no chicks. Why? Because solitary yang does not generate, and solitary yin does not complete.

Heaven and Earth enact transformation like water and fire—burning and moistening—yet this is not by human effort but occurs naturally. The human head models Heaven, and the abdomen mirrors Earth. Simply conceal the spirit within, guarding it without interference or assistance, and regulate the breath through the nose without indulgence or restraint. Naturally, there will be opening and closing, receiving and bestowing, no different from the Dao of Heaven and Earth’s transformative work. When the time arrives and the qi stirs, the mechanism moves: fire arises from below the navel, and water is born within the crown. Its wonder lies in its spontaneity, not in striving through effort or force.

Thus, this Dao is a creation of Heaven and Earth, fixed and unchanging. The *Cuixu Pian* states: "It is like a husband and wife in conjugal union—when they guard the essence and blood, the infant of the golden elixir is formed." This union refers to the internal resonance of yin and yang, the intermingling of spirit and qi. When spirit enters qi, and qi merges with spirit, they meet at the right moment, forming an inseparable bond of hardness and softness. There is no craft or control to be applied; one simply observes its occurrence without knowing how it comes to be.

The *Xinyin Jing Zhu* says: "Men and women receive the same endowment; it is only the sequence of resonance that distinguishes yin and yang." The *Qu Yi Shuo* states: "Opening qi is male; closing qi is female." Yang qi gathers in the front, so men are front-heavy at birth and must lie prone. Yin qi gathers in the back, so women are back-heavy at birth and must lie supine. This remains true even at death, as can be observed in those who drown. Was this taught by parents? No—it was determined at the moment of receiving qi, when the sequence of opening and closing was already fixed.

Master Wei’s intent is for students to thoroughly understand the yin and yang within their own bodies, to know the natural principles of creation and transformation. The "flowing pearl of great yang" is spirit-mercury. The *Lingyuan Dadao Ge* says: "This substance has no fixed position; it changes with time and shifts with the heart’s intent. In the body, when stimulated by heat, it becomes sweat; when the nose encounters wind, it becomes mucus; when the kidneys unite, it becomes essence; when the eyes grieve, it becomes tears." Thus, it constantly seeks to leave the body.

Golden radiance is true lead. When mercury obtains true lead, it turns and clings to it, naturally ceasing to flee or wander, lingering within and transforming into golden liquid, congealing into utmost hardness. True lead arises from the *kan* (☵, the north) position, first as liquid, then congealing into the yellow sprout, hence the metaphors of "horse’s teeth" and "red jade." The *Cuixu Pian* says: "The cinnabar head is nothing but primordial qi; when refined, the yellow sprout emits jade blossoms."

Lead is the ruler; mercury is the minister. Lead moves first, and mercury responds—like a ruler initiating and a minister harmonizing. Lead belongs to metal; mercury belongs to wood. Wood’s nature loves metal, and metal’s essence yearns for wood. When yin and yang meet, they naturally resonate and unite. In elixir-making, one should closely observe the moment when yin reaches its extreme and welcomes the first stirring of yang, seizing the mechanism to advance the fire. It must not be excessive nor insufficient—only then can the hundred vessels be urged to return to the source, the gates of exhaustion be penetrated to the core, and the sovereign fire, ministerial fire, and common fire all be gathered in the yellow palace to forge the supreme treasure.

True lead is conceived in the womb of the *kun* mother, nurtured like a loving mother’s care. When the flying work reaches the *gan* palace, it captures and restrains true mercury, uniting with it to form the elixir, which then returns to the *kun* mother’s abode—this is the filial son repaying kindness, the kind crow feeding its parent in return. Yet without the fierce fire of scorching and extreme refinement, true lead cannot take flight—this is the strict father’s instruction and command.

Metal generates water, and wood generates fire—this is the normal sequence of the Five Phases. But in elixir-making, wood and fire become companions, and fire reverses to generate wood; metal and water unite, and water reverses to generate metal. Thus, it is said: "The Five Phases are arranged in mutual dominance to generate." Fire’s nature melts metal—this is moving the fire of the southern *li* palace to refine the metal within northern water. Metal cuts down wood’s flourishing—this is moving the metal within northern water to restrain the wood within southern fire.

One (water) and two (fire) combine to form three; five is earth. Three and five become one—water, fire, and earth intermingle and fuse into a single qi. At this time, the mysterious yellow intermingles, and the clear and turbid are not yet separated, like the primordial chaos of Heaven and Earth. After a short while, when the time arrives and qi transforms, something arises from nothing. In the profound and indistinct, a mass coalesces, and the supreme essence of Heaven and Earth is conceived within.

Qutu Shenhe said: "If one understands the unity of three and five, one may become an earth-walking immortal. Its wonder must be received by the heart and transmitted orally—it cannot be fully expressed in writing." Without encountering a wise teacher, students can only speculate on their own. You should turn right from the west, rotating to the *zi* position, where the tiger is born from water. *Wu* is the east rotating to the south, where the dragon emerges from fire. *Zi* and *wu* are north and south, water and fire; *mao* and *you* are east and west, metal and wood.

Right rotation and left rotation, one concealing and one arising—then water and fire unite, and metal and wood naturally do not separate. However, *mao* and *you* as east and west are alternate names for metal and wood, not the directions of Heaven and Earth or the left and right of the human body. Yet one must not abandon the body to seek elsewhere. When making the elixir, the southern *li* dragon is driven downward to call to the northern *kan* tiger, which then inhales and absorbs the dragon’s essence. With each exhalation and inhalation, the two consume and merge into one.

When Mars guards the west, fire enters the metal region. When Venus traverses the heavens, metal passes through the southern *wu* position and appears. When making the elixir, the spirit-fire is directed to illuminate the metal region. Pressured by fire, the metal takes flight and ascends, appearing in the south. This metal is true lead.

Wherever the killing *qi* descends, what can remain unshaken? True lead ascends to capture true mercury, and true mercury naturally emerges to surrender to true lead. At this point, spirit enters *qi* to form the embryo—like a wildcat or dog lying in wait for a rat. The medicine, refined by fire, becomes the elixir—like birds and sparrows fearing the hawk. This arises from the mutual restraint of their natures: at first sight, they submit of their own accord, and thus dare not make a sound.

The method is supremely divine and exceedingly simple, yet one may fail only by not knowing what the dragon and tiger truly are. The *Returning to Metal Chapter* states: "Without grasping the origin of yin and yang, one labors in vain to discuss the mysterious workings—how much less can one succeed?" Without understanding the principle, how can one dare to speak recklessly from mere conjecture?

From ancient times to the present, countless seekers have pursued famous medicines, consorted with wandering adepts, and squandered their family wealth, causing brothers, wives, and children to scatter—yet in the end, none achieved harmony. How rare are those who succeed in the world! Why? Because they entered the gate in error, straying far from the Dao, and never encountered a luminous teacher to illuminate the principle.

Now, mercury is originally the essence of wood, and its nature is to flee and wander, making it difficult to subdue. Only when cast into the lead crucible does it merge with lead—this is what is meant by "moving to the western position to stand alongside metal." The *Celestial One* generates water, dwelling in the north, its symbol the Dark Warrior. The *Earthly Two* generates fire, dwelling in the south, its symbol the Vermilion Bird. The *Celestial Three* generates wood, dwelling in the east, its symbol the Azure Dragon. The *Earthly Four* generates metal, dwelling in the west, its symbol the White Tiger. These four each reside in their own quadrant, fundamentally unrelated. Yet when we speak of "metal and water uniting," it refers to the metal of the western *White Tiger* descending into wood. When we speak of "water and fire as companions," it refers to the wood of the eastern *Azure Dragon* ascending into fire. Thus, metal is no longer in the west but unites with water in the north; water is no longer in the east but becomes fire’s companion in the south. The White Tiger transforms into the Black Tiger, and the Azure Dragon becomes the Red Dragon—this is what is meant by "the yang dragon originally emerges from the *Li* palace, and the yin tiger returns from the *Kan* position." When metal, water, wood, and fire gather as one, they merge into a primal chaos like the undivided *Taiji*. When they separate into two, the *Zhen* dragon-mercury emerges from the *Li* region, and the *Dui* tiger-lead is born in the *Kan* palace.

Though the four each have their own symbol, we speak only of dragon and tiger because north and south form the warp, while east and west form the weft. As Zhang Ziyang said: "The Four Symbols do not depart from the Two Bodies"—this truly captures the essence of their mutual restraint.

The liver is green and the lungs are white, representing metal and wood. The kidneys are black and the heart is red, representing water and fire. Metal generates water, and wood generates fire, so the liver and lungs are likened to parents, while the heart and kidneys are likened to children. Yet metal and wood both arise from earth, so the spleen is called the ancestor.

Why, though the kidneys are considered the child, are they assigned the first of the five? It is because the kidneys belong to water, and the number of water is one. The *qi* of the day begins at *zi*, born in the kidneys, then cycles through the liver, heart, spleen, and lungs. Yet why are the five not called the Five Viscera but instead the Three Substances? It is because metal and water unite, water and fire become companions, and together with *wu-ji* earth, they form the Three.

The Four Symbols and Five Phases all rely on earth; without *wu* earth, the elixir cannot form. This is why the Three merge into the One Earth. The Golden Elixir is originally formless, born from the center—it is not a tangible substance but merely uses the Five Phases as a metaphor. Within the human body, the two *qi* nourish each other, circulating and flowing through the celestial stems and branches. Like the movement of the celestial net, when *mao* and *you* align, metal and water naturally remain inseparable.

The subduing of the killing *qi* is like its return to the ocean depths—akin to autumn’s solemnity, gathering all things inward. The arising of the generating *qi* is like its ascent to the southern sea—akin to spring’s vitality, flourishing outward. In the second month, *mao* is established, and the lunar general is *He Kui*, which belongs to *xu*. Within *xu* lies *xin*, the withered elm—this month, the killing *qi* of *xin* metal descends upon *mao*. In the eighth month, *you* is established, and the lunar general is *Tian Gang*, which belongs to *chen*. Within *chen* lies *yi*, the sprouting wheat—this month, the generating *qi* of *yi* wood occupies *you*.

When the sun travels the western path, it is spring, and in the second month at *mao*, the western path lies in the northeast, while the eastern path is in the south. When the sun travels the eastern path, it is autumn, and in the eighth month at *you*, the eastern path lies in the southwest, while the western path is in the north. North and south are the warp of Heaven and Earth; east and west are the weft. Within the crucible, when *Kui* and *Gang* revolve, the dragon flees west, the tiger flees east, *zi* is in the south, and *wu* is in the north—just like the creative transformations of the second and eighth months at *mao* and *you*. This is a metaphor for the Heaven and Earth within the body: ascent contains descent, descent contains ascent, and fire holds peril, warning one to guard the mind like a city, lest it scatter.

Yang is born from one and completed at nine. When the yang number reaches nine, it reaches its limit and returns to one. The *Xuan Wei* is the place where the sun and moon unite, between *hai* and *zi*—the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang is born. *Zi* is where the first yang stirs. The elixir method lies in the *prior-heaven*, containing only the *qi* of the *Taiyi*. In the *post-heaven*, it transforms into true essence and is disseminated.

The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir differs from the minor, fleeting methods of side paths. One must sever worldly affairs, focus the mind, and diligently practice day and night without the slightest lapse. After entering seclusion for a year, one must continue to nurture the elixir and not hastily venture far. Only after three years will the body become like mist and clouds, walking as if flying—able to lightly ascend and travel afar. Though great floods rise to the heavens, they cannot drown me; though severe drought melts metal and stone, scorching mountains and earth, I remain unscathed. Life and death lie within my control, and I dwell in eternal joy without care. Yet once the nurturing is complete, one must still conceal oneself among people, accumulating merit and virtue, guiding and enlightening the lost, before one can ascend as an immortal. Thus, Zhu Linggen admonished Huangfu Lüdao to guide later students, warning that one cannot seclude oneself in obscurity—one must first benefit all beings before ascending as an immortal. How can one merely cultivate oneself in solitude?

Generally, the minor arts of side paths are complex and difficult, easy to encounter but hard to accomplish. The Great Dao of the Golden Elixir is simple and easy, hard to encounter but easy to accomplish. Once one discerns the signs of its encounter and compares them to the mutual resonances of things, measuring the beginning and end of their principles, then within Heaven and Earth—whether vast or minute, high or low, sentient or insentient—everywhere is the Dao, and all things touch and nurture it. Like the crane’s midnight cry or the rooster’s crow at dawn—why is this?

When one aligns with the qi of Heaven and Earth, all resonates in accord. Consider the cold cicada drinking the wind, the rhinoceros gazing at the moon, the jade-green pool beneath the night moon, or the evening clouds veiling the blue mountains—all are manifestations of the Golden Elixir’s imagery. As Zhang Ziyang said: *"Those who cultivate and refine must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation."* Is this not true?

The essence of the Elixir’s method lies in nothing greater than the Five Phases. The marvel of the Five Phases lies in refining metal with fire, subduing wood with metal. When fire flourishes, water tempers it; when water flourishes, earth restrains it—this is the mutual conquest of the Five Phases. Metal generates water, for water is the child of metal, yet within water, metal is born. Wood generates fire, for fire is the child of wood, yet within fire, wood is born—thus they alternate as father and mother. The father is like Heaven, the mother like Earth: Heaven’s qi descends to Earth, and Earth receives it to fulfill the work of generation and nurturance. Hence it is said: *"The mother contains the nourishing fluids; the father bestows the endowment."* When the essence of the Five Phases coalesces into metal and stone, they endure for a thousand or ten thousand years without decay. How much more so for a person who congeals the essence of their own Five Phases into a treasure—shall they not endure eternally with Heaven and Earth? How can mere metal and stone compare?

At this critical juncture, one must fix the mind unwaveringly upon this single point, maintaining focus without distraction, silently sustaining it day and night, like a hen brooding over her eggs. Only then will the work remain pure, the medicinal materials avoid dissipation, the fire’s power remain unbroken, and the Dao be accomplished.

When one abides in stillness, the Dao naturally arrives. It is like standing a pole and seeing its shadow, or calling toward a valley and hearing the echo—there has never been a resonance that did not elicit a response. Just as the sun and moon hang in the sky: when one seeks fire, fire arises; when one seeks water, water comes. The response is so swift—how can it not be supremely efficacious?

Yet in the world, all see it, yet none truly know.

The wild *yegu* and croton are the most virulent poisons among herbs—ingesting even a *cun* of *yegu* or a *liang* of croton will cause instant collapse, and even if the sages Zhou or Kong were to divine with milfoil stalks or the physicians Bian Que or shamans were to ply their needles and drums, none could revive the stricken. Yet people know only that poison taken by mouth can swiftly kill, while refusing to believe that an elixir ingested can grant longevity. Why do they not reflect more deeply on this?

Later in this text, the rustic scholar of Kuai, dwelling in a secluded valley, embraces simplicity and shuns worldly glory. Content in obscurity, he disregards fame and profit, holding fast to tranquility, seeking peace in quietude. Thus, he composed this work, singing of the *Great Change* and the legacy of the Three Sages, examining their intent to unify all under heaven in shared principles, aiming to align with the Dao, radiate vitality, and let the spirit’s transformation flow freely, bringing harmony to the four seas. He set forth this model as a sequence to be followed for ten thousand generations, a guide for governance without excess, drawing inward to nurture nature, embracing the natural Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, wherein profound virtue lies in returning to the root and reverting to the origin—close to the heart, never leaving the self. Embracing the One without abandonment ensures enduring existence. Paired with ingestion of the dual essences, he arranged the four substances (the following eight characters absent in modern editions), guarding the five phases in cyclical rotation, discarding the eight minerals of Wudu, and carefully employing the refined elements prized by the world. Three stems, their branches intertwined, emerge from one source under different names—this is no mere ornate verse but a text of true substance, worthy of contemplation. Had I feigned falsehoods, I would have incurred blame; thus, I composed the *Cantong qi*, guarding its essence. Its words are few, yet its Dao vast, and later ages should heed it, casting off harm and entrusting themselves to the mountains, wandering the vast expanse, befriending immortals, transforming their forms to transcendence, and vanishing without a trace. For a hundred generations hence, they may roam the mortal realm, spreading their wings to the four directions. Yet in times of calamity—whether scorching drought or flooding rains, when wells are cut off and leaves wither, losing their splendor—each bears their own burdens. Only the steadfast path of longevity remains secure.

**First Section**

Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams. Kan and Li frame the void, turning the hub and axle. The four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li serve as bellows and keys, covering and enveloping the Dao of yin and yang. Like a charioteer holding the reins and bit, wielding the plumb line and compass, they follow the wheel tracks, abiding in the center to govern the exterior. Their calculations are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendars, with months and nodes divided into five and six. The warp and weft serve the sun, combining to form sixty. Hard and soft have their outer and inner aspects. At dawn, *Zhun* is established; by dusk, *Meng* is received. Day and night each govern one hexagram, applied in sequence. Before *Ji Ji* arrives and as twilight ends, the cycle begins anew. The sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases. Spring and summer rely on the inner body, from *Zi* to *Chen* and *Si*. Autumn and winter engage the outer function, from *Wu* to *Xu* and *Hai*. Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; darkness and light follow cold and heat. The words of the lines embody benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in due time. Thus, they align with the four seasons and five phases, attaining their proper order.

**Master Zhenyi (Peng Xiao) says:**
Before *Taiyi*, *Taixu*, and *Taichu*, though the wondrous was contained in emptiness, no signs had yet appeared. At *Taishi* and *Taisu*, during the *Taiji*, there was primordial chaos—hun-tun. Within it lay the essence of *Zhenyi*, the beginning of heaven and earth, the mother of the myriad things. Once the single *qi* took form, the Two Modes divided, and then there were Qian and Kun. There were yin and yang, the Three Powers and Five Phases, and the myriad things with their countless names. Thus, Qian and Kun are the guiding principles of heaven and earth, the bellows and keys of creation. With Qian and Kun established, yin and yang move within them.

**Master Xu** (originally written as *Wei*, hereafter the same) states: The refinement of golden liquid and returning elixir shares the same path as creation. Borrowing the images of the *Yi* to discuss it, all begin by gathering the primordial *qi* of heaven and earth’s chaos and *Zhenyi* as the root foundation. Then, they take the essence of Qian and Kun, the subtle movements of their operation, as the model. Following the numbers of Kan, Li, Pi, and Tai, they establish the mechanisms of punishment and virtue, stealing the transformations of yin and yang to complete winter and summer. Yang arises after *Zi*, and movement begins at the start of yang’s nine; stillness follows yin’s six—this is the great principle of elixir refinement. Thus, Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel; Kan and Li frame the void. Water and fire become husband and wife; yin and yang, dragon and tiger. The Five Phases weave to contain true essence; the Three Powers warp to gather purity. Cold comes and heat goes, circulating through the 384 lines. The hare rises and the crow sinks, ascending and descending over 384 days—all beginning with the substance of Qian and Kun’s two hexagrams and culminating in transformation. Hence, it is said: Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams.

In refining golden liquid and returning elixir, the crucible contains the Golden Mother and the Flowery Pond, also called the Golden Womb and Spirit Chamber. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li’s four hexagrams serve as the crucible, medicine, bellows, and keys—their pivots and bolts. Covering and enveloping refer to wrapping and encasing. Thus, there are the yin crucible and yang furnace, hard fire and soft tally, all following the sixty-four hexagrams in endless cycles, mutually employed. Within this, they operate the twenty-four solar terms of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, dividing the seventy-two pentads. A year’s twelve months of *qi* and climate are compressed into one month; a month’s *qi* and climate are gathered into a day and night’s twelve hours. The clepsydra’s marks are set, dividing the two watches, separating *Zi* and *Wu*. Yin and yang communicate through darkness and new moon, uniting dragon and tiger. Aligning with heaven and earth’s great numbers, they harmonize with yin and yang’s transformative mechanisms. If control is not errant and movement not lost, then externally, yin and yang’s tally will match; internally, the dragon and tiger’s bodies will form. Thus, it is said: The skilled artisan relies on the plumb line to avoid error; the capable charioteer holds the reins and bit without wavering, conforming to the compass and wheel tracks.

This metaphorically describes the alchemist’s regulation of fire times. The "five and six" of the monthly nodes refer to thirty days; each day and night governs one hexagram, totaling sixty hexagrams. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are the father and mother of the medicine, the pivots and bolts of the crucible. Beyond the day and night’s numbers, the *Cantong qi* speaks comprehensively, combining them into sixty-four hexagrams. The warp serves the sun, and the weft refers to the pitch pipes and calendrical numbers. Hard and soft have their outer and inner aspects: yang hard, yin soft; water and fire, metal and wood mutually serve as outer and inner. In all encounters of day and night, yin and yang’s ascent and descent, fire numbers follow the hexagrams’ lines. Day and night each govern one hexagram, beginning with *Zhun* and *Meng* as the first two. From dawn’s *Zhun* to dusk’s *Meng*, this is the sequence. *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji* refer to the hexagrams *Ji Ji* and *Wei Ji*. *Hui Shuang* refers to the alternation of darkness and new moon, yin and yang’s brightness and obscurity. "The sun and stars set the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases" means yang pertains to movement, yin to stillness. Within the twelve hours, early and late divide yin and yang’s ascent and descent, fire numbers circulating endlessly, mutually employed.

Yang fire advances from *Zi* to *Si*, pure yang in operation—inner yin seeking outer yang. Yin tally retreats from *Wu* to *Hai*, pure yin in operation—outer yang attaching to inner yin. This is the principle of inner and outer bodies, of flourishing and decline, beginning with *Fu* and ending with *Kun*, all measured by the lines’ images. Spring’s *qi* generates, called reward; autumn’s *qi* withers, called punishment. From *Zi*, *Chou*, and *Yin* is spring; *Mao*, *Chen*, and *Si* are summer—yang fire times. *Wu*, *Wei*, and *Shen* are autumn; *You*, *Xu*, and *Hai* are winter—yin tally times. Within the twelve hours, fire tally operates, corresponding to these four seasons and five phases, darkness and light, cold and heat, benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger. The lines’ images must not err by even a hair’s breadth. Thus, it is said: "Not losing" means the crucible’s four seasons are unharmed; the images’ cold and heat are unified—then the elixir will surely form.

An ancient song says:
*The sage seizes creation’s intent,*
*Hand-rolling sun and moon, setting crucible and furnace.*
*Subtly ascending, inverting heaven and earth’s essence,*
*Gathering yin and yang, the spirit immortal’s sun soul and moon spirit.*
*Whoever recognizes this is a true immortal child.*
*Chain it, feed it—after a thousand days,*
*The body, free of yin, cannot die.*

Thus, refining golden liquid and returning elixir, if not modeled on heaven and earth’s creation and natural principles, has no other path.

**Master Baoyi (Chen Xianwei) says:**
The *Jinbi Jing* states: The Spirit Chamber is the elixir’s pivot, the father and mother of all minerals. Master Xu’s saying—"Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams"—shares the same meaning.

Without the Spirit Chamber, there is no means to refine the elixir; without Qian and Kun, there is no way to perceive the *Yi*. Qian and Kun are the hexagrams of pure essence. The Six Children break this pure essence to form hexagrams. As Master Mayi says: "Qian and Kun intermingle to give birth to the Six Children." The Six Children are the broken essence of Qian and Kun. Thus, the Six Children arise from Qian and Kun, and the sixty-four hexagrams likewise emerge from Qian and Kun. Hence, they are called the father and mother of all hexagrams. The essence of father and mother is originally pure yang and pure yin. With the birth of the Six Children, the pure yang and pure yin are broken—how can they remain pure? Chen Xiyi says: "Refine the broken essence to restore the pure essence." From this, we know that refining the broken essence can return it to pure essence and enter the Dao, just as refining the myriad minerals can return them to the Spirit Chamber to form the elixir. Yet the myriad minerals are no other than the hexagrams within our body, and the Spirit Chamber is no external thing—it is the Qian and Kun within our body. To refine the great elixir, first establish Qian and Kun as the Spirit Chamber. Once the Spirit Chamber is set, transformation resides within it.

When Qian and Kun are established, yin and yang naturally unite. Qian descends to unite with Kun, forming Kan; Kun ascends to unite with Qian, forming Li. With Kan and Li complete, transformation again resides within them. It is also said: The sun is heaven, yet it does not descend from the west to unite with earth; the moon is earth, yet it does not ascend from the east to unite with heaven—this is the image of male and female uniting in essence. The sun and moon’s movements give rise to cold and heat, the four seasons, the division of day and night, and the settling of yin and yang. Heaven and earth do not create cold and heat; cold and heat arise from the sun and moon’s distance. Heaven and earth do not create the four seasons; the four seasons arise from the sun and moon’s north-south movement. Heaven and earth do not create day and night; day and night arise from the sun and moon’s rising and setting. Heaven and earth do not create darkness and light; darkness and light arise from the sun and moon’s conjunction and separation. Though yin and yang are subtle, they do not transcend the sun and moon; though creation is vast, it does not transcend Kan and Li.

Thus, though the changes of the hexagrams are not uniform, they do not depart from the central lines of Kan and Li, which circulate through the six positions—like the spokes of a wheel, though varied, all revolve around a single hub. The central lines of Kan and Li refer to the one yang within Kan and the one yin within Li, ascending and descending within the six lines. Laozi says: "Thirty spokes share one hub; it is the emptiness within that gives the wheel its use." Those who attain the Dao move the sun and moon within their bodies, while ordinary people, ignorant of this principle, violate the yin and yang of creation and thus cannot avoid the peril of collapsing moats or the fault of broken spokes—what then remains of the wheel’s frame and true axle?

Qian is pure yang, the male hexagram; Kun is pure yin, the female hexagram. Kan contains yang within yin, and Li contains yin within yang—these are the hexagrams of male and female union. Hence, they are called the four hexagrams of male and female. The remaining sixty hexagrams—some with partial yin above, partial yang below; some with partial yang above, partial yin below—lack pure yin and yang and do not unite male and female, so they cannot be called male and female. Only these four hexagrams encompass the Dao of yin and yang, serving as the bellows and piston. Qian and Kun are the body of the bellows and piston; Kan and Li are their function. Knowing the body and function of these four hexagrams is like a craftsman following the inked cord and adhering to the compass and square, or a charioteer holding the reins and bit to follow the wheel tracks—abiding by principle within and mastering subtlety without, so that all actions are without error and every movement accords with nature.

Within the calendar’s lunar month of thirty days, the remaining sixty hexagrams beyond the four male and female hexagrams are assigned to the days, with two hexagrams per day—one as the warp, one as the weft. From morning *Zhun* and evening *Meng*, morning *Xu* and evening *Song*, to *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the hexagrams’ inner and outer, hard and soft essences shift: in the morning, the upper position; in the evening, the lower; hardness on the outside, softness within. Together with the four preceding hexagrams, the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* are all employed for our use. Thus, the Dao of the great elixir can be examined through the *Yi*, and this is why the *Cantong Qi* was composed.

Master Mayi says: "The waxing and waning of day and night do not cease in the words; beyond the words, the intent becomes clear." He also says: "Hexagrams have reversal and correspondence, which are most crucial. When the reversed form is profound, the corresponding form is especially subtle." *Zhun* is a hexagram; its reversal is *Meng*. From *Xu* and *Song* onward, all are arranged in reversed order. For hexagrams like *Yi* and *Xiaoguo*, which cannot be reversed, their corresponding forms are used instead. Thus, *Yi* is followed by *Daguo*, which is its corresponding form. From the new moon’s morning use of *Zhun* and *Meng* to the last day’s morning use of *Jiji* and *Weiji*, the cycle ends and begins anew. From this, we see that morning is yang and evening is yin; day is movement and night is stillness. Intimacy and distance alternate, host and guest shift, waxing and waning succeed one another, avoidance and approach, life and death, advancing fire and retreating tally—beware of the slightest error in a moment, the tiniest deviation in a hair’s breadth. Extraction and addition must distinguish floating and sinking; operation must discern dawn and dusk. Scholars should seek intent through images and, having grasped the intent, forget the images. As the *Wuzhen Pian* poem says: "Within this, grasp the intent and do not seek the images; if you exhaust the hexagrams, you will only weary the mind." This is the truth.

Hexagrams have inner and outer bodies: the inner trigram of three lines models the spring and summer of a year and the period after midnight to noon of a day; the outer trigram of three lines models the autumn and winter of a year and the period from noon to before midnight of a day. The inner trigram models yang, the outer trigram models yin—this is the image of Qian and Kun in harmonious union. Spring and summer nurture yang; autumn and winter nurture yin. After midnight, advance the fire; after noon, retreat the tally—this principle is consistent. Reward is yang, punishment is yin; benevolence is yang, righteousness is yin; joy is yang, anger is yin. In the morning, act with yang to correspond to spring and summer; in the evening, act with yin to correspond to autumn and winter. If one can respond appropriately to the four seasons, one naturally attains the principle of the five phases—not through the trivial acts of bestowing rewards or punishments, hastily practicing benevolence or righteousness, or feigning joy or anger. Master Xu merely used this to illustrate the life and death of yin and yang.

Moreover, the elixir is the essence of utmost yang. If even a trace of yin remains, and refinement is incomplete, it will never be accomplished. Practitioners of the true Dao—can they not be cautious in movement and stillness, speech and silence? Furthermore, acts such as cherishing life and benefiting others, kindness and forgiveness, compassion and love, loyalty and trust, harmony and joy, purity and tranquility, truthfulness and sincerity—these are all yang. Acts such as harming life, cruelty and jealousy, greed and stinginess, oppression and arrogance, harshness and obstinacy, lust and desire, deceit and falsity—these are all yin. By abstaining from yin and cultivating yang, one will naturally eliminate yin and perfect yang, thereby attaining the true Dao.

Master Shangyang Chen Zhixu says: Fu Xi observed the River Chart and first drew the eight trigrams; the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun wore robes and ruled the world, taking Qian and Kun as their model. The *Guicang* of the Xia dynasty took Kun as its head; the *Lianshan* of the Shang dynasty took Gen as its head. The *Zhouyi* of King Wen took Qian and Kun as its head. Confucius’ commentary says: "Are not Qian and Kun the gates and doors of the *Yi*? Qian is the yang thing."

Kun is the yin thing. It is further said: When Qian is still, it is concentrated; when it moves, it is straight—thus it greatly engenders. When Kun is still, it is contracted; when it moves, it opens—thus it broadly engenders. Master Wei deeply grasped the precautions of the Three Sages and composed the *Cantong Qi* with annotations, the *Upper Wings* of which states: "The Way of the Three Sages ferries all people of the world." Its opening line directly points out: "Qian and Kun are the gates and doors of the *Yi*, the father and mother of all hexagrams." Qian, as a thing, is yang—hence it is the door of the *Yi*. Kun, as a thing, is yin—hence it is the gate of the *Yi*. Without the gates and doors of Qian and Kun, how could the Supreme Polarity take form? How could Heaven and Earth establish their positions? How could the sun and moon shine? How could the myriad beings transform and generate? How could the sage practice the Dao?

Thus, when Qian moves and straightens, yang reaches the Supreme Polarity and generates yin. When Kun moves and opens, yin reaches the Supreme Polarity and generates yang. Yin and yang intermingle to form Li and Kan. Confucius said: "The *Yi* has the Supreme Polarity, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the eight trigrams." The function of Qian is nine: first riding Kun to form *Fu* (Return); within *Fu*, *Zhen* (Thunder) is conceived; from *Fu* comes *Shi* (Army); within *Shi*, *Kan* (Water) is conceived; from *Shi* comes *Qian* (Modesty); within *Qian*, *Gen* (Mountain) is conceived; from *Qian* comes *Yu* (Enthusiasm); *Zhen* is born from *Yu*; from *Yu* comes *Bi* (Union); *Kan* is born from *Bi*; from *Bi* comes *Bo* (Splitting); *Gen* is born from *Bo*. Thus, the three sons—*Zhen*, *Kan*, and *Gen*—are all conceived and born from Kun.

The function of Kun is six: first riding Qian to form *Gou* (Encounter); within *Gou*, *Xun* (Wind) is conceived; from *Gou* comes *Tongren* (Fellowship); within *Tongren*, *Li* (Fire) is conceived; from *Tongren* comes *Lü* (Treading); within *Lü*, *Dui* (Lake) is conceived; from *Lü* comes *Xiaoxu* (Small Accumulation); *Xun* is born from *Xiaoxu*; from *Xiaoxu* comes *Dayou* (Great Possession); *Li* is born from *Dayou*; from *Dayou* comes *Guai* (Parting); *Dui* is born from *Guai*. Thus, the three daughters—*Xun*, *Li*, and *Dui*—are all conceived and born from Qian.

When male and female intermingle and mutually assist one another, Qian twice joins Kun to form *Lin* (Approach); from *Lin* comes *Tai* (Peace); from *Tai* comes *Dazhuang* (Great Strength); from *Dazhuang* comes *Guai*—this is yang seeking yin. Kun twice responds to Qian to form *Dun* (Retreat); from *Dun* comes *Pi* (Stagnation); from *Pi* comes *Guan* (Contemplation); from *Guan* comes *Bo*—this is yin responding to yang. This is how Qian generates the three daughters and Kun generates the three sons. Proceeding from this, the three sons and three daughters alternately become husband and wife, and the sixty-four hexagrams emerge in sequence. This is what is meant by Qian and Kun being the father and mother of all hexagrams.

What is meant by Kan and Li as the framework? When yang rides yin, Qian’s center becomes empty and forms Li. When yin rides yang, Kun’s belly becomes full and forms Kan. Thus, Kan and Li succeed the body of Qian and Kun as the framework of yin and yang. Compared to Qian and Kun, Kan and Li are like the spokes to the hub and axle. Qian and Kun are the true spokes of Kan and Li; Kan and Li converge at the hub of Qian and Kun. Laozi said: "Thirty spokes share one hub"—this is the same principle as the great and small *Xi Jun*.

The terms "female" and "male": the female is the mother of livestock, the male the father of livestock. Thus, the female is the general term for yin things, the male the general name for yang things. Together, Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are called the four hexagrams of male and female. They serve as the bellows and key, just as yin and yang serve as the ebb and flow. The bellows symbolizes the gate of yin; the key, the door of yang. Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are like a bellows and key within Heaven and Earth.

To employ the Way of the bellows and key to generate beings is called "beings." To employ the Way of the bellows and key to generate humans is called "humans." To employ the Way of the bellows and key to transcend the ordinary and enter sagehood is called "sage." The sage is one who skillfully seizes the transformations of creation, who skillfully employs Kan and Li. One who skillfully seizes the Way of creation is like a master craftsman who uses the plumb line and inked cord to correct the compass and square—what task cannot be accomplished? One who skillfully employs the Way of Kan and Li is like one who holds the reins and bit to follow the tracks—where can one not succeed? The sage is one for whom the cosmos is in hand and the myriad transformations are born from the body.

The sage is one who skillfully abides in the center to govern the external, who illuminates the pitch-pipes and calendrical reckoning to comprehend the numerical patterns. The pitch-pipes correspond to the seasonal indications of creation, while the calendar records the revolutions of the celestial sphere. When the first yang arises, the pitch-pipes respond to the Yellow Bell; from *zi* to *hai*, the celestial degrees complete their circuit, and thus when a year has fully passed, yang is reborn at *zi*. The lunar nodes consist of five or six: the lunar nodes divide two nodes into one month; five or six means five days form one *hou* (seasonal marker), and six *hou* make one month—thus one month has thirty days. One day has twelve hours, and two hexagrams with twelve lines correspond to one day, forming its warp and weft; one month has sixty hexagrams, serving as its guiding framework.

At the new moon’s dawn, *Zhun* governs affairs; by dusk, *Meng* is to be received—what does this mean? The hexagram *Zhun* (䷂) consists of *Zhen* below and *Kan* above: *Zhen* is the eldest son, capable of restoring the yang within *Kan* to bestow the power of generation and nurture—hence it is said that *Zhun* governs affairs. The hexagram *Meng* (䷃) consists of *Gen* above and *Kan* below: *Gen* is the youngest son, capable of gathering the yang within *Kan* to perform the function of warming and nourishing—hence it is said that *Meng* is to be received. Each day and night is governed by one hexagram, and within the sixty hexagrams, yin and yang mutually bestow generation and nourishment.

The dark and new moons mark the beginning and end of a month; morning and evening regulate a day’s activity and stillness. The four seasons determine a year’s rewards and punishments: those who achieve excellence are rewarded, while those who fail in their tasks are punished—without losing the proper balance of benevolence, righteousness, joy, and anger. The essential principle is to grasp the patterns of the four seasons and five phases. The overarching meaning of this chapter summarizes the unifying thread of the *Cantong Qi*: it designates Qian and Kun as the gate and door of the *Yi*, not merely referring to the elixir, medicinal substances, or firing times.

Master Quanzhenzi, Yu Yan, said: "Closing the door is Kun; opening the door is Qian. The ceaseless alternation of closing and opening constitutes transformation and penetration—this is why Qian and Kun are the gate and door of the *Yi*." Qian gives birth to the three sons; Kun gives birth to the three daughters. The union of male and female generates the myriad beings—this is why they are the parents of all hexagrams. *Kan* is the moon; *Li* is the sun. The sun and moon travel along the ecliptic, circulating endlessly day and night like the rim of a wheel. The hub is like the body; the axle is like the heart. To set the hub in motion, one must first align the axle—this metaphor means that to circulate the sun and moon within the body, one must first rectify the heart. Qian is the pure yang, the male hexagram; Kun is the pure yin, the female hexagram.

*Kan* contains yang within yin; *Li* contains yin within yang—these are the hexagrams of intermingling female and male. In the elixir method, Qian and Kun are positioned above and below, while Kan and Li are arrayed east and west. The closing and opening of Qian and Kun, the coming and going of Kan and Li, resemble the bellows and its pipe—both hollow vessels. Such is the Dao of the elixir. If one grasps it, it endures; if one neglects it, it perishes. Thus, one must guard the inner gate and be vigilant without, just as the *Liezi: Chongxu Zhide Jing* describes the driving of Tai Dou: "The reins are held with harmony, their tension and ease regulated by the lips; the chest and diaphragm maintain steadiness, the grip and grasp align inwardly with the heart and outwardly with the horse’s intent. Thus, advance and retreat follow the plumb line, and turns conform to the compass."

The numbers in the *lü* and calendar records correspond to the thirteen positions traversed, matching the twelve pitches of the *lü*, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve-year cycle. The five or six divisions of the lunar nodes arise from dividing a thirty-day month into six segments. The warp establishes Qian and Kun’s fixed positions north and south, while the weft reveals Kan and Li’s subtle functions east and west. Those who serve the sun’s commands move in accord with heaven’s revolutions, rising and setting with the sun without the slightest deviation.

Combining these yields sixty: excluding Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, precisely sixty hexagrams remain. Each day comprises twelve hours, with two hexagrams governing affairs—each line corresponding to one hour. Two hexagrams total twelve lines, matching the numbers of the *lü*, calendar, and cycle. A thirty-day month thus yields sixty hexagrams. Arranged across thirty days, the first day at dawn is *Zhun*, at dusk *Meng*; from there, dawn is *Xu*, dusk *Song*, dawn *Shi*, dusk *Bi*, progressing in sequence until the month’s end, when *Jiji* and *Weiji* are used. From the last day to the first, the cycle repeats endlessly. Within this sequence, the hexagrams’ inner and outer, hard and soft structures may oppose or align, illustrating the greater phases’ rise and fall—yet one need not rigidly adhere to this.

Chen Ni’s *Ninefold Verdant Void* states: "Heaven’s twelve forms are clearly divided; all people divide them into stages of elixir refinement." For the sun is fire, and the celestial stems are markers. If one can reverse the celestial stems and seek them within the body, then the sun’s position becomes the hour. The active rise with the sun’s emergence, the quiescent rest with its setting. Within the body, the sun’s rising and setting naturally align with the fire phases’ movement and stillness, all subtly harmonizing with heaven’s measures.

The hexagrams comprise six lines: the lower three form the inner, the upper three the outer. Observe the hexagrams *Zhun* and *Meng*: at dawn, *Zhun* is employed, its yang fire ascending. *Zhun*’s initial nine corresponds to the *zi* hour within the body, moving from inner to outer—thus it is said that spring and summer occupy the inner, proceeding from *zi* to *chen* and *si*. At dusk, *Meng* is employed, its yin tally descending. *Meng*’s top nine corresponds to the *wu* hour within the body, moving from outer to inner—thus it is said that autumn and winter occupy the outer, proceeding from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Yang qi arises in spring, yin qi withers in autumn, illustrating the reward and punishment of elixir refinement. The long day emerges from the east at *yin*, the short day enters the west at *shen*, illustrating the dawn and dusk of elixir refinement. The line texts speak of benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger—these lie hidden or revealed, advance or retreat, wax or wane, each according to its time. Is there truly such a thing as the four seasons, the celestial stems and branches, dawn and dusk, brightness and dimness, or benevolence and righteousness, joy and anger, reward and punishment? All are metaphors for the waxing and waning of yin and yang within the body, the measures of excess and deficiency. To truly rely on tidal phases and seasonal markers in practice would be mistaken.

Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them. Heaven and earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*. "Establishing positions" refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*. *Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed abode, neither above nor below, nor any constant reality.

Peng Xiao’s *One Child* states: "Heaven and earth establish their positions" refers to the *jiji* cauldron as a vessel modeled on *Qian* and *Kun*. "The *Yi* moves within them" refers to the yin and yang of *Kan* and *Li*, the tally-fire, circulating within it. The cauldron, modeled on *Qian* and *Kun*, is then filled with the Golden Mother to complete the three powers of heaven, earth, and humanity. "*Kan* and *Li*’s two functions have no fixed line positions" means that externally applied water and fire, in their ceaseless movement and stillness, circulate through the six voids, coming and going, above and below, without fixed position.

Bao Yi Zi, Chen Xianwei, says: This is Xu Jun’s self-explanation, taking *Qian* and *Kun* as the divine chamber, arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing, causing *Kan* and *Li* to interact within them to achieve the power of transformation. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*—the sun and moon as the *Yi*. The sun and moon are the *Yi* of heaven and earth; *Kan* and *Li* are the *Yi* within the human body. *Qian* and *Kun* are its substance; *Kan* and *Li* are its function. These two functions, without fixed line positions, circulate through the six voids, coming and going without fixed abode, neither above nor below, nor any constant reality.

Shangyang Zi, Chen Zhixu, says: The *Ten Wings*’ *Xici* states, "Heaven is noble, earth is base—*Qian* and *Kun* are thus determined." Xu Jun’s commentary says: "Heaven and earth establish their positions, and the *Yi* moves within them." His further annotation states: "Heaven and earth are the images of *Qian* and *Kun*. 'Establishing positions' refers to arranging the positions of yin and yang in mutual pairing. The *Yi* refers to *Kan* and *Li*—*Kan* and *Li* are the two functions of *Qian* and *Kun*." His words are already detailed, his intent too earnest—how could he mean that the world’s people, lacking faith and slow to awaken, would fail to grasp it? The *Wings* say: "Dividing yin and dividing yang, alternating soft and hard, thus the *Yi*’s six positions form a pattern." The two functions: *Qian* employs nine, *Kun* employs six. There is function but no fixed position. "Employing nine: seeing a flock of dragons without a leader is auspicious" speaks of the noble one practicing the Way until virtue reaches its utmost. "Employing six: profit lies in eternal steadfastness" speaks of *Kun*’s virtue—the Way of earth, the Way of the wife, the Way of the minister.

The Way of earth achieves no completion yet succeeds in bringing things to their end. Thus, *Kun*’s function, being solitary yin, accomplishes nothing—this is why "employing six" follows *Qian* and proceeds in tandem with it. Yet *Qian* "employing nine" pairs with *Kun* in the southwest to gain companions. *Qian* and *Kun* transform and each rectifies its nature and destiny: *Qian*’s Great Beginning, "employing nine," rides the yang of *Kun*, containing its yin in emptiness to form *Li*; *Kun*’s Great Unity, "employing six," bears *Qian*’s yin, containing its yang in fullness to form *Kan*. Thus *Kan* and *Li* attain the exclusive embodiment of yin and yang, their transformations and functions enveloping and nurturing without cease. Like the sun and moon in the heavens—now waxing, now waning; now darkening, now renewing—so too in the human body: yin and yang now at the Supreme Ultimate, now in constant flux. The Way of the *Yi* repeatedly shifts, its movements never abiding. If *Qian* and *Kun* were destroyed, the *Yi* would have no means to manifest. The sage therefore purifies the heart, retreats to concealment, and reverses the course of the *Yi*’s Way.

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: "Heaven’s position is above, earth’s below, and the two qi circulate between them, ascending and descending without end—like a bellows. Humans receive the harmonious qi at birth and are no different in substance from heaven and earth. If one can embody emptiness and stillness, qi will naturally circulate throughout the body: when it issues forth, it resembles earth qi rising; when it withdraws, it resembles heaven qi descending. Thus one may attain the same longevity as heaven and earth—this is the *Yi*. How could it belong to heaven and earth alone? *Qian* is heaven, *Kun* is earth—these are the cauldron and vessel of our body. *Li* is the sun, *Kan* is the moon—these are the medicinal substances of our body. The precelestial eight trigrams place *Qian* in the south and *Kun* in the north, arranging the positions of heaven and earth in pairing; *Li* in the east and *Kan* in the west divide the gates of the sun and moon’s ingress and egress. Seeking within our body, the principle is the same. *Qian* and *Kun* are the body, *Kan* and *Li* are the function. These two circulate, ascending and descending through the six voids, coming and going above and below—originally without fixed positions. When *Kan* and *Li* operate within the cauldron of our body, heaven and earth lie concealed within—how could there be fixed positions? The *Yi* is imagery, and no imagery is more luminous than the sun and moon. The sun combines the essences of the five phases; the moon receives the measures of the six pitch-pipes. Five and six make thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle renews. Exhausting the numinous to know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, issuing and withdrawing, coiling and uncoiling. The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines; the elixir has three hundred eighty-four measures. Twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*; three hundred eighty-four *zhu* make sixteen *liang*—this is the tally of two eights. The lines embody the principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent. Extracting the trigrams to form tally-signs and observing the signs to regulate the fire—these tally-signs are the lines of the day, not separate from them. In the language of the *Yi*, they are called trigrams; in the language of the elixir, they are called tally-signs. Thus it is said: the tally-signs refer to the sixty-four hexagrams.

Master Zhenyi, Peng Xiao, said: "The *Yi* is imagery, for it is formed by the union of the sun and moon. The golden liquid returned elixir is likewise formed by the union of the sun and moon’s yin and yang essences. 'The sun combines the essences of the five phases' means that each month it once conjoins with the moon. 'The moon receives the measures of the six pitch-pipes' refers to the metal and water within the cauldron, which each month receive half a month’s pitch-pipe qi. [The twelve pitch-pipes are divided between the sun and moon.] The sun, moon, and five stars weave together to generate the myriad things—this is likened to the cauldron receiving the external yin and yang qi, ascending and descending at the midnight and noon tally-signs, arranging the essences of the five stars, and conjoining the purest essences of the sun and moon. Negation and affirmation follow one another, cycling without end—beginning anew after completion, this is *Kun*. Thus the yin and yang essences issue and withdraw, coil and uncoil, circulating day and night in an endless cycle. Following the sixty-four hexagrams and their three hundred eighty-four lines, extracting the tally-signs according to the lines, the fire advances and retreats as yin arrives and yang departs, yang conceals and yin extends. The eastern and western qi intermingle, the sentiments of husband and wife unite. At this moment, 'the *Zhen* hexagram arrives to receive the tally-sign': heaven and earth commingle their essences, the sun and moon join their souls and spirits. The *hun-dun* is the divine chamber, resembling an egg with its two *hun* conjoined—like the *hun-dun*. The yang dragon and yin tiger within the *hun-dun* bear and respond to each other’s qi, establishing the root and foundation, nurturing the budding sprout to ultimately congeal the spirit and form the body, becoming a refined entity. Thus within the cauldron-chamber is another heaven and earth. All crawling and wriggling creatures arise from this. The male yang belongs to heaven and is *xuan*; the female yin belongs to earth and is *huang*. These are the old yang and old yin—*Qian* the father and *Kun* the mother—mutually employing the fire tally to its utmost measure. Thus we know that within a single cauldron, the workings of creation are each a clear image of heaven and earth’s movements, giving rise to the myriad things. If the firing times are missed, the additions and withdrawals are excessive, the cold and heat do not correspond, or the advances and retreats are disordered, then by what seasonal nodes would heaven and earth generate things? By what yin and yang would they produce dragons and tigers?

Master Baoyi, Chen Xianwei, said: "The *Jinbi Jing* states: 'No alchemical technique is more luminous than the gold and fire.' The subtleties of gold and fire exhaust transformation: when yang moves, yin dissolves. Master Xu used the *Xici* of the *Yi* to verify this. The great Way of the *Yi* hangs its imagery in the sun and moon; the great Way of the elixir manifests its luminosity in gold and fire. Gold and fire are *Kan* and *Li*. Thus when the essence of metal flourishes, the Jade Hare’s radiance increases; when the power of fire prevails, the Golden Crow’s brilliance doubles. This passage uses five and six to clarify the functions of water and earth. The number of earth is five; the number of the sun is five, and the number of the five phases is also five. The number of water is six; the number of the moon is six, and the number of the six pitch-pipes is also six. From *jia* to *gui* are the ten celestial stems, called the ten days—five stems are firm, five are yielding—this is the number five of the days. The twelve pitch-pipes consist of six *lü* and six *lü*—this is the number six of the moon. Five times six makes thirty degrees, and when the degrees are complete, the cycle renews—this is the ceaseless alternation of dark and new moons. The two substances, gold and fire, mutually arise and vanish between the dark and new moons. Once the scholar has exhausted the numinous and known the transformations, causing yang to depart and yin to arrive, converging like spokes in a wheel, revolving in alternation, mutually issuing and withdrawing, coiling and uncoiling—taking the lines of the *Yi* as tally-signs and observing the sun and moon’s dawn and dusk to regulate the fire—naturally one seizes the mechanism of heaven and earth and steals the marvel of creation. The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines; the medicine has three hundred eighty-four measures. Twenty-four *zhu* make one *liang*; three hundred eighty-four *zhu* make sixteen *liang*—this is the tally of two eights. The lines embody the principle of yin and yang’s ascent and descent. Extracting the trigrams to form tally-signs and observing the signs to regulate the fire—the tally-signs are the lines of the day, not separate from them. In the language of the *Yi*, they are called trigrams; in the language of the elixir, they are called tally-signs. Thus it is said: the tally-signs refer to the sixty-four hexagrams."

When the hexagram aligns with *Zhen* (Thunder), where yang is born, the fire advances with the tally-sign of one yang. At this moment, the divine chamber refines its essence-metal, and fire and qi move in concert—yang the dragon is propelled, yin the tiger follows. The one who scatters the mystery is the dragon soaring into the celestial void to descend as rain; the one who transforms the yellow wrap is the tiger entering the earth to produce metal. This is the image of heaven above and earth below in primordial union. Here, the foundation is laid, the root established; through nurturing cultivation, the boundary is fostered. Once its spirit congeals, its form naturally takes shape—from the vastness of heaven and earth to the tiniest creeping things, all that possess form and qi arise from this. If this single barrier is produced externally, it descends from root to branch, becoming the Dao of ceaseless generation; if produced internally, it returns to the root and restores the source, becoming the Dao of long life and transcendence.

Master Shangyang Zi, Chen Zhixu, said: Confucius said, "Nothing is more vast in adaptability than the four seasons; nothing is more luminous in manifesting clarity than the sun and moon." Master Xu Jun further elucidated this, drawing it out to affirm its truth. This book models its patterns on the sun and moon to illustrate yin and yang. The sun and moon adhere to heaven, exhibiting waxing and waning, conjunction and opposition; yin and yang exist in the world, displaying sequence and reversal, generation and completion. The sun is pure yang’s essence, called the Great Yang; the moon is pure yin’s essence, called the Great Yin. The celestial sphere measures three hundred sixty-five degrees and a quarter. Each day and night, heaven completes one revolution, constituting a single day. The Great Sun travels one degree per day; after thirty degrees, a month is formed. The Great Moon travels thirteen degrees and a fraction per day; completing one revolution around heaven constitutes a month. The sun’s movement of one degree is called a day. The sun combines with the five phases’ essence in: *zi*, *chou*, and *yin* (the months); the sun aligns with the five planets in the north at *mao*, *chen*, and *si*; in the west at *wu*, *wei*, and *shen*; in the south at *you*, *xu*, and *hai*. In the time of Yao, the celestial heart was established at *zi* and *jiachen*, with the winter solstice at the position of *Xu* (Void) and the Rat. In the Han *Taichu* era, the winter solstice shifted to *Qianniu* (Oxherd); in the Tang *Taiyan* era, to the eastern *Dou* (Dipper); from the Song to the present, to the southern *Ji* (Winnowing Basket). This is called the precession of the equinoxes. Thus, the Great Sun gains the essence of fire and earth, its radiance enhanced, and the brilliance of metal and water further intensified. The moon is governed by the six pitch-pipes: the *lü* (yang) and *lü* (yin) harmonize in a cycle of one, five, one, six, uniting at thirty-three and thirty degrees, completing two revolutions of the sun and moon. Hence it is said: when the degrees are exhausted, renewal begins. The sun and moon circulate endlessly, giving rise to fullness, waning, darkness, and conjunction. The world follows these phases, experiencing the alternation of cold and heat; people follow this alternation, undergoing birth, aging, illness, and death.

What is meant by "exhausting the spirit to know transformation"? Nothing is more spirit-like than heaven and earth; nothing is more wondrous in transformation than yin and yang. The Dao of heaven revolves leftward, completing one revolution each day, traversing over five hundred fifty thousand *li*. Earth rests within its qi, unmoving like a floating plank upon water. The spirit of the Great Sun is the primordial qi of heaven and earth. Its body is as resplendent as metal; all things rely on its yang fire, the blazing red qi, for growth, maturation, and fruition. Its diameter spans eight hundred forty-five *li* and a fraction. Its movement does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator but shifts within the yellow path, inside and outside. By day, it resides north of the celestial equator, shortening the day; by night, south of the yellow path. Why speak of north and south, inside and outside? Because the north contains the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, where the Emperor’s seat resides—hence the north is called "inside," and the south "outside." Its spirit is unfathomable: this is the spirit of the Great Sun.

The spirit of the Great Moon is the supreme essence of heaven and earth. Its body is entirely black; all things rely on its yin water’s transformative power for gestation, birth, and nourishment. Its diameter spans six hundred seventy *li* and a fraction. Its movement does not follow the ecliptic or celestial equator. The yellow and celestial equators, like two intersecting rings, are separated by twenty-four degrees. The moon travels through their midst, deviating from the yellow path by approximately six degrees. Though its body is black, it shines when illuminated by the sun. The *Dushu* uses the image of a black lacquer ball hung beneath the eaves to instruct: when sunlight strikes the ball, its light projects onto a dark wall. The moon’s round body, like the black lacquer ball, shows light where the sun strikes and darkness where it does not. Thus, it is always half-illuminated and half-dark. At full moon, the moon opposes the sun: at night, the moon is above, the sun below, and the illuminated side fully faces the world, while the dark side faces heaven, unseen by the world. At conjunction, the moon shares the sun’s path, lying beneath it; the illuminated side faces heaven, the dark side earth. When the moon separates from the sun by twenty-five degrees, people begin to see its faint glow; as the distance increases, the light grows. When the moon is ninety degrees from the sun, half its light is visible—this is called the first quarter. After full moon, the light gradually diminishes.

Thus, the moon’s body is not inherently round or crescent; it depends on the amount of sunlight it receives. Foolish people may claim that the earth obstructs the sun and moon at opposition, unaware of heaven’s vastness and the principle of yin and yang’s qi, which, though seemingly obstructed, secretly communicate. The apparent blemishes in the moon are the shadows of the great earth. The sun’s body is large, the moon’s small; the sun is distant from heaven, the moon even more so. Yet the moon’s transformations cannot be fully revealed—this is the spirit of the Great Yin.

This is what is meant by "exhausting the spirit to know transformation." *Zi* is the beginning of one yang; by *si*, yang reaches its peak, and yin is born. *Wu* is the beginning of one yin; by *hai*, yin reaches its peak, and yang is born. Cold and heat alternate, warmth and coolness balance; yin reaches its extreme, and yang is born; yang departs, and yin arrives. Yin attaches to yang like spokes to a wheel—spokes converge, and the wheel turns. Yin coils, and yang unfolds. The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines; extracting tally-signs from the lines means that one hexagram has six lines, and one line has three tally-signs. Each day has two hexagrams, totaling thirty-six tally-signs. Yin and yang interact, yet this does not last a single hour, nor exhaust the function of a single line. Within an hour, there are three tally-signs, but only one is used. The activation of one tally-sign occurs when one yang is born beneath *Kun* (Earth), forming *Zhen* (Thunder). *Zhen* is one yang that subdues two yins. Thus it is said: when *Zhen* arrives, the tally-sign is received.

At this juncture, heaven and earth unite their essences, and the myriad things, suspended in emptiness, receive life. The sun and moon hold fast, the crow and hare intertwine without separation. Yang, male and firm, stands erect, scattering the mystery; yin, female and receptive, transforms the yellow wrap to contain and nourish. In the profound darkness of primordial chaos, the two unite in congress. *Quan yu* (the beginning) refers to the initial union, the planting of the root. *Quan yu* means "beginning"; the ancients created the steelyard starting with the *quan* (weight), and the cart beginning with the *yu* (chassis). This analogy speaks of the inception of creation.

Moreover, *quan* signifies "temporary," while *yu* signifies "stable"—this speaks of the work at hand being both provisional in its operation and most steadfast in its execution, never faltering or collapsing. Nurturing *qi* with meticulous care to foster the *yinqie* (the protective enclosure), congealing and spreading the essence of yang to form the bodily frame—this passage merely describes the initial division of the Great Ultimate, the beginning of yin and yang’s harmonious flow, and the birth of humanity and all things. Thus it is said: "The multitude tread forth, and all that writhes and stirs arises therefrom." Yet people remain unaware that the Dao of post-celestial sequential flow also draws upon the metaphor of "morning *tun* and evening *meng*," and that the root and foundation of *yinqie* are likened to the alchemical crucible of returning elixir—this is not so. Quanyangzi Yu Yan states:

The *Yi* (Book of Changes) embodies the union of sun and moon, for among all things between heaven and earth, none are as manifest and luminous as these two luminaries. Thus they are pointed to as exemplars, enabling one to perceive clearly the subtle workings of heaven and earth’s yin and yang, and to silently grasp the marvels of divine transformation. The sun possesses five *gan* (celestial stems): five *gan* of yang, five *gan* of yin. The moon possesses twelve *guan* (lunar phases): six *guan* of yin, six *guan* of yang. In the Dao of the Elixir, the sun is fire, the moon is the medicine. The sun contains the essence of the Five Agents—one entity embracing five hues. The moon receives the governance of the six pitch-pipes, as white metal is refined through the six trigrams. The Great Yang traverses one degree each day, reaching thirty degrees before uniting with the Great Yin, cycling endlessly. Sun and moon traverse the ecliptic, emerging and entering in alternation, ascending and descending, coiling and uncoiling, their diurnal revolution like a turning wheel. If one can reflect inwardly upon the sun and moon within the body, they are no different from those in heaven and earth.

The entire *Yi* comprises three hundred eighty-four lines; a single piece of the Great Medicine weighs three hundred eighty-four *zhu*. Herein lies the correspondence between the Dao of the Elixir and the Dao of the *Yi*. The *yao* (lines) are the strokes of the trigrams; the *fu* (tally-signs) are the integrated bodies of the trigrams. In elixir methods, *Qian* and *Kun* serve as the crucible and vessel, *Kan* and *Li* as the medicinal substances, while the remaining sixty trigrams govern the fire phases. Now, observing *Qian* and *Kun*: from *Tun* and *Meng* to *Ji Ji*, every instance of reversed and corresponding bodies aligns perfectly. Thus it is evident that "one yin and one yang are called the Dao."

Between the dark of the moon and the new moon, *Qian* intermingles with *Kun* to form *Zhen*—within the body, the solitary yang arises. At this moment, spirit and *qi* unite, *qi* and spirit merge, akin to heaven and earth commingling their essences, sun and moon forming a single disk. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, unite in timely congress to mold the myriad things and accomplish the year’s work. *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, unite in timely congress to seize the workings of creation and form the sacred embryo. This borrows the time of sun and moon’s union as a metaphor—it is not to say that only the dark and new moon are suitable for practice.

The male yang scatters the mystery, as heavenly *qi* descends to earth. The female yin transforms the yellow wrap, as earth receives heavenly *qi* to generate beings. The *Wuzhen Pian* states: "When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite; when the yellow sprout emerges, *Kan* and *Li* conjoin, augmenting the elixir method." The birth of medicine and the generation of beings by heaven and earth are no different—they are but the interplay of yin and yang, the congress of mystery and yellow. Yin and yang, a single *qi*, ascend and descend in mutual embrace, merging into oneness. Thus it is called "primordial chaos," which is the encompassing boundary of heaven and earth, the womb of the myriad things. In elixir methods, this serves as the *quanyu* (beginning) to establish the root and foundation. Then heaven and earth, the myriad things, are all within one’s own body, and there is no need to seek them externally.

The crux lies in the *jingying yinqie*—*yinqie* being the root and stem. In elixir practice, when one engages in *jingying* (meticulous nurturing) and turns the light inward, spirit yearns for *qi* and congeals, *qi* yearns for spirit and abides. Naturally, they intertwine and form the embryo. This Dao is the source of generation and transformation. Not only do humans and beasts emerge therefrom, but all that flies, writhes, walks, or breathes does so likewise. Yet when applied to humans, it generates humanity; when preserved within oneself, it generates the medicine. The distinction between sage and commoner, reversal and sequence, lies herein—yet this is truly the origin from which the human Dao arises.

Thus Confucius praised the *Hongmeng* (Vast Obscurity), declaring the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* to be profoundly empty. He examined antiquity, tracing back to the primordial sovereign, where the *Guanju* established the beginning: the intertwining of *qi* in the first year, the sprouting of the bud. Zhenyizi Peng Xiao states:

Confucius praised the *Yi*, dividing *Qian* and *Kun* as the foremost of the myriad things, establishing *Xian* and *Heng* as the foundation of husband and wife. He cleaved the *Hongmeng* and chiseled the primordial chaos, revealing the forms of gods and spirits, and communicating the sentiments of heaven and earth. Thus the principles of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, male and female, the mutual generation and restriction of the Five Agents, and the mechanisms of the myriad things’ transformations are all encompassed. *Qian* and *Kun* illuminate their profound emptiness. Hence Master Xu used the *Yi* as an analogy, creating the crucible and vessel, moving the celestial mechanism, uniting the forms of dragon and tiger, and harmonizing the bodies of husband and wife. Initially, there was no form or substance, as in the midst of *Hongmeng* and primordial chaos. Once the fire was kindled and the tally-signs moved, the *qi* of male and female intertwined. Thus, from the moment the fire is first applied, it corresponds to the first year’s sprouting. Day by day, month by month, the bodies of dragon and tiger take shape.

Baoyizi Chen Xianwei states:

Before form and *qi* are constituted, it is called *Hongmeng*; once constituted but not yet separated, it is called *hunlun*. The *Yi* states: "The *Yi* possesses the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes." The *Yi* is like *Hongmeng*; the Great Ultimate is like *hunlun*. *Qian* and *Kun* are the transformations of the Great Ultimate. United, they are the Great Ultimate; divided, they are *Qian* and *Kun*. Thus, when *Qian* and *Kun* are spoken of together, it is called *hunlun*; when spoken of separately, it is called heaven and earth. Confucius praised the *Yi*, first presenting *Qian* and *Kun* as the gateway of the *Yi*, for the virtue of *Qian* and *Kun*’s profound emptiness contains the *Yi* of *Hongmeng*. The *Guanju* poem and the rites of capping and marriage take the intertwining of the two *qi* as their meaning. Before *Qian* and *Kun* divide, it is called *hunlun*; when yin and yang intertwine, it is called the beginning. The *Liezi* states: "The Great Beginning is the inception of *qi*; the Great Commencement is the inception of form." Thus it is said: "The *Guanju* establishes the beginning."

The Golden Elixir is the Supreme Unity, the Primordial Sovereign, who takes the *qi* of *Qian* and *Kun* before their division, the *qi* of yin and yang before their separation, and transforms it into the true and eternal, refining it into the true elixir. Hence it is said: "There is a thing formed in chaos, born before heaven and earth." The *Jinbi Jing* states: "The Primordial Sovereign first refined the mercury in the divine chamber, containing the profound emptiness and the mystery of white, giving birth to the Golden Duke. Majestically, he established the beginning." This "beginning" refers to the first year. At the outset of cultivation, in the first year, the yellow sprout grows, and the Golden Elixir is accomplished.

Scholars must observe the seasons and conditions, commence practice, gather the supreme treasure, and conjoin the elixir’s head. Once the elixir’s head is obtained, one naturally guards the celestial mechanism in silence and ascends to the sacred realm.

Shangyangzi Chen Zhixu states:

The *Wings* state: "The *Yi* possesses the Great Ultimate, which generates the Two Modes"—this is Confucius’ praise of *Hongmeng*. The virtue of *Qian* and *Kun* is the profound and wondrous emptiness of primordial chaos; the Primordial Sovereign is the initial splitting of Pan Gu. This is Confucius’ examination of antiquity. The *Guanju* concerns the proper human relations of men and women, the foremost of husband and wife, and the rites of capping and marriage. Confucius ordered the *Book of Songs*, placing husband and wife first to rectify the Dao of yin and yang without deviation. Confucius appended the *Wings* to the *Yi*, placing *Qian* and *Kun* first to clarify the principle that hardness and softness must be paired. The *Appended Judgments* state: "The *Yi* accords with heaven and earth, thus it can encompass the Dao of heaven and earth. Looking up, one observes the patterns of heaven; looking down, one examines the principles of earth. Thus one knows the causes of the obscure and the manifest, tracing back to the beginning and returning to the end, thereby knowing the portents of life and death."

What is meant by "tracing back to the beginning"? It is the Dao of yin and yang’s sequential flow, which generates beings. Hence it is said: "The rites of capping and marriage intertwine *qi*." This is called "knowing life." What is meant by "returning to the end"? It is the ability to reverse the flow of the pre-celestial Dao, transcending the common and entering the sacred. Hence it is said: "The first year sprouts the bud." This is called "knowing death."

Quán Yángzǐ Yú Yǎn states: Thus, the *Yijing* begins with *Qian* and *Kun*, the *Book of Documents* esteems "investigating antiquity," the *Book of Songs* places *Guān Jū* first, the *Book of Rites* emphasizes the capping ceremony and marriage, and the *Spring and Autumn Annals* takes the first year as its primary principle. The sages composed the classics, all with a foundational premise. How could the alchemical method disregard its beginning?

The sages did not arise in vain. Looking up, they observed the manifest celestial signs. These signs advance and retreat, contract and extend, responding to the seasons. Thus the *Yijing* unifies the heart of heaven. The *Fù* hexagram establishes the beginning, where the sprouting Yang inherits the father’s body and founds its omen upon the mother. The waxing and waning correspond to the pitch pipes, the rising and falling follow the pivot of the Dipper. On the third day, brightness emerges; *Zhèn* receives *Gēng* from the west. On the eighth day, *Duì* receives *Dīng*, and the upper crescent levels like a taut cord. By the fifteenth day, the celestial stem’s body reaches fullness; *Jiǎ* in the east, the toad and hare’s essence, the dual brightness of sun and moon’s *qi*. The toad gazes at the hexagram’s nodes, while the hare spits forth radiance. The seven-and-eight Dao is complete, then bends, lowers, and descends. On the sixteenth day, it turns to receive governance; *Xùn* and *Xīn* appear in balanced brightness. Descending to the twenty-third day, it mirrors the upper crescent, with metal and water each at half. On the thirtieth day, *Kūn* and *Yǐ* in the northeast lose their companion; the nodes are exhausted, and the bodies alternate in succession. The dragon of *Rén* and *Guǐ* pairs with *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ*; *Qián* and *Kūn* encompass the beginning and end. The numbers seven and eight, fifteen and nine, six and six likewise correspond. The four combine into thirty, and the Yang *qi* withdraws, vanishing into concealment.

Zhēn Yīzǐ Péng Xiào states: Fú Xī, the sage, looked up and observed, looked down and examined, establishing the numerical images of the *Yijing* and knowing the conditions of the ten thousand things. He bequeathed this to later generations, enabling those yet unenlightened to grasp the apertures of heaven and earth, steal the essence of yin and yang, recognize the root of creation, and distinguish the forms of correspondence. Generation and conquest, advance and retreat, contraction and extension—all lie within one’s grasp. Thus it is said: the *Yijing* unifies the heart of heaven.

Therefore, the method is devised with symbolic images, gathering the utmost essence. The crucible and furnace are prepared, the talismanic fire is moved, the clepsydra is followed, the hexagrams and lines are employed, and the hours and seasonal nodes are determined to exhaust the great numbers of heaven and earth. The *Fù* hexagram establishes the beginning, where the sprouting Yang inherits the father’s body and founds its omen upon the mother. The *jī* refers to the six yin lines below, where the first transforms into a single yang line, forming the *Fù* hexagram. Thus it is said: "establishing the beginning, sprouting." It is called "founding its omen upon the mother" because the lower line of the *Kūn* hexagram transforms into a *Qián* line, and the inner body becomes *Zhèn*, as *Zhèn* is conceived within *Kūn*. Thus *Zhèn* is *Qián*’s eldest son, and from here, it gradually transforms with the seasons until the fifteenth day, when it becomes pure *Qián*, the father. Thus it is said: "inheriting the father’s body."

This is also like the moon, which appears on the third day and by the eighth day forms the upper crescent, with the yang number reaching half—analogous to the crucible’s metal and water each being half. By the fifteenth day, it is full and round, emerging in the east. The toad and hare’s essence shine doubly, analogous to the crucible’s metal and water being full and attaining the fire’s timing. Master Xú used this hexagram to illustrate the moon’s waxing, condensing the three half-month phases into six hours of a single day, advancing the Yang fire and withdrawing the *chou* within the crucible, where it receives the fire’s talisman and undergoes these transformations and sprouting omens.

The "seven-and-eight Dao" refers to the fifteenth day, when the *Qián* body is complete. "Bending, lowering, and descending" refers to the text below, where after the sixteenth day, the Yang fire retreats and the yin talisman is employed. "Turning to receive governance" refers to the sixteenth day onward, when the Yang fire first retreats and the yin talisman begins to arise. "*Xùn* and *Xīn* appear in balanced brightness" is like the initial advance of the Yang fire, akin to the moon’s third day. "Descending to the twenty-third day" again mirrors the upper crescent, with metal and water each at half. "*Kūn* and *Yǐ* on the thirtieth day in the northeast lose their companion" means the yin talisman is exhausted by this point, and the Yang fire vanishes. Since within a month yin and yang are each half, alternating in succession, and water and fire mutually require one another, once the month ends, it returns to the beginning, again employing the *Fù* hexagram to commence. Thus it is said: "the body succeeds, and the dragon is reborn." *Rén* and *Guǐ* are yin; *Jiǎ* and *Yǐ* are yang.

The pairing of yin and yang refers to the Elixir Mother within the Qian-Kun cauldron receiving the qi of the yang dragon and yin tiger in union—thus it is said that Qian and Kun encompass the beginning and end. The numbers seven, eight, nine, and six together make thirty days. Within thirty days, seven and nine correspond to yang numbers, six and eight to yin numbers; Qian and Kun each take half, and by the thirtieth day, both yin talisman and yang fire are complete.

Bao Yizi Chen Xianwei said: "What manifests the celestial talisman are the sun and moon. The sun and moon have their advances and retreats, their extensions and contractions, which correspond to the principles of the *Yi* hexagrams’ yin-yang ascent and descent, their comings and goings, their transformations. Thus we know the *Yi* unifies the celestial mind, and the sages who composed the *Yi* rendered great merit and virtue to the world—how could this be empty? The Great Dao takes form in creation, yet creation is most difficult to fathom. If one can fathom creation and discern its mechanism, then one can probe the wonders of the Dao and steal its use—who but true immortals and supreme sages could achieve this?

The ancient perfected sages, benevolent toward the world’s heart, were beyond comprehension. Having discerned the mechanism of creation to benefit themselves, they further illuminated the wonders of creation to benefit others. What lies within oneself can indeed be known by the heart and guarded by intention, but to reveal it to others, how could one do so without borrowing images and entrusting them to writing to make it clear, enabling others to silently comprehend? Thus, looking up and down between heaven and earth, nothing reveals the wondrous workings of creation more than the sun and moon. Searching through the classics, nothing records the wondrous principles of creation more than the *Yi* hexagrams. Moreover, the sun and moon’s waxing and waning, their traces of fullness and decline, when aligned with the principles of the *Yi* hexagrams’ line movements and transformations, are all mutually corroborating and unified. This is why the *Cantong Qi* was composed—to "triangulate the principles of the Great Simplicity, unify the wonders of creation, and seal the Dao of the Great Elixir."

Now observe: when the first yang arises, its hexagram is *Fu*. *Zhen* is below, *Kun* above; *Zhen* is the eldest son, *Kun* the mother, *Qian* the father. The *Fu* hexagram is originally pure *Kun*, with one yang coming from *Qian* to transform the lower into *Zhen*—thus it is said, "by the mother the foundation is established." *Zhen* possesses the body of *Qian* in a subtle way; gradually accumulating, two yangs become three yangs, and the body of *Qian* is complete. Thus it is said, "the eldest son succeeds the father’s body." The waxing and waning correspond to the twelve pitch-pipes: each month, one line is added. According to the *Doushu*, each hour, one line advances.

On the third day of each month, the moon appears faintly bright in the west at the *geng* position, corresponding to *Zhen*’s first yang arising. In the *Zhouyi*’s "Receiving the Stem" method, the *Zhen* hexagram receives six *geng*s—thus the principles of creation and the *Yi* are so interwoven. On the eighth day, the moon appears in its first quarter in the south at the *ding* position, corresponding to the *Dui* hexagram’s two yangs arising; in the "Receiving the Stem" method, *Dui* receives six *ding*s. By the fifteenth day, the moon is full in the east at the *jia* position, and the *Qian* hexagram receives six *jia*s. At this time, the hexagram is complete with three yangs, the hare and toad both flourishing. The toad is the essence of metal qi, thus it waxes with the hexagram’s progression; the jade hare is the spirit of *mao* wood, thus it emits light when facing the great yang.

Seven and eight make fifteen. When the Way of three and five is complete, what was full recedes, what was extended contracts, what was high descends, and what was ascending lowers. By the sixteenth day, one yin arises, and yin begins to take charge. The moon appears at dawn in the west at the *xin* position, corresponding to the *Xun* hexagram receiving *xin*. By the twenty-third day, the moon appears at dawn in the south at the *bing* position, corresponding to the *Gen* hexagram receiving *bing*. By the thirtieth day, the moon sets in the east at the *yi* position, corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram receiving *yi*. When the cycle ends, it alternates again, and yang resumes its charge, the body succeeding and the dragon reborn—the dragon is *Zhen*.

Among the eight hexagrams, only *Kan* and *Li* do not participate, for their two functions ascend and descend within the six hexagrams. The functions of *Kan* and *Li* are great indeed! *Qian* receives the six *jia*s and six *ren*s; *Kun* receives the six *yi*s and six *gui*s. Among the eight hexagrams, only *Qian* and *Kun* receive two stems; the rest receive only one. Thus it is said, "*Ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*; *Qian* and *Kun* encompass the beginning and end," revealing that within *Qian* and *Kun* lies true water.

The young yang number is seven, the young yin number eight; together they make fifteen. The old yang number is nine, the old yin number six; together they make fifteen. The four numbers combined make thirty, corresponding to a month’s days. Seven, eight, nine, and six are the four images. The principles of the *Great Yi* and the principles of creation are entirely unified.

By the thirtieth day, at the moon’s setting, the yang qi is utterly extinguished and concealed. Beyond this, one yang arises again. Revolving in cycles, it ends and begins anew.

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhixu, said: "Thus, when the sages descended into the world, they looked up and down, carefully examining yin and yang, taking yin as the talisman and yang as the mandate. What is meant by 'looking up to reveal the celestial talisman'? The yin qi in heaven and earth is called the celestial talisman; the yang qi in heaven and earth is called the celestial mandate. The yin qi within the human body is called the fire talisman; the yang qi within the human body is called the nature and life. When yin and yang extend and contract, the talisman becomes the indicator of advance and retreat. When the talisman’s indicator is precise, timing is not lost.

Thus, the Dao of the *Yi* unifies the celestial mind. The celestial mind is the correct position of *Qian*’s *zi*, the gate of yang’s arising. *Qian* is the yang thing; the celestial talisman is pure yang. *Qian*’s yang first arises beneath two yins, becoming *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the eldest son; *Fu* arises from *Kun*. *Fu* is one yang hidden beneath five yins; *Kun* is the mother—thus it is said, 'by the mother the foundation is established.' The correspondence of the pitch-pipes and the *Doushu* refers to the Yellow Bell’s pitch at *zi* and the *Doushu*’s movement establishing *zi*, both corresponding to the time when the first yang begins to sprout. On the third day’s dusk, the moon’s faint yang arises in the southwest; yang arises beneath the moon, resembling *Zhen*—thus it is said, '*Zhen* receives *geng* in the west.' On the eighth day, the first quarter appears; *Dui* receives *ding*. The yang fire ascends to half, level as a string. On the fifteenth day, at opposition, the west has the moon, the east the sun; the hare fully emits its light, the yang fills the hexagram’s body, and *Qian* is complete.

On the sixteenth day, at dawn, *Xun* appears at *xin*; the yin talisman envelops the yang, preventing its escape. By the twenty-third day, the yin talisman half-conceals the light, halting the lower crescent. On the thirtieth day, the moon’s body is entirely dark, white exhausted by black, its pure light facing heaven. In the northeast, it loses its companion—the northeast is *Gen*, the region of *jishui*; *Gen* is the ghostly path. In the human body, when *gui* is full, the meridians move, and its qi is diminished. When the cycle ends and *gui* is exhausted, one yang arises again—thus *ren* and *gui* pair with *jia* and *yi*. *Qian* begins with *Fu*; the numbers seven, eight, nine, and six end at thirty. When thirty ends, *Kun* is complete, and true qi returns to concealment."

Quán-Yángzǐ Yú Yǎn states: As for the subtleties of the *huohou* (fire-timing), there are aspects not easily expressed in words. Thus, the perfected ancients observed the Dao of Heaven and devised symbolic methods to instruct humanity. They likened Heaven and Earth to the crucible, the sun and moon to the medicinal substances, and the waxing and waning of the sun and moon to the *huohou*. The moon traverses the heavens once each month, conjoining with the sun—hence it is called the "celestial tally," responding to the seasons. There are twelve hours in a day.

From the first day of the month onward, the moon’s light gradually increases: the *hun* grows while the *po* wanes, yin recedes and yang extends—this mirrors the period from *zi* to *si* within a single day. From the sixteenth day onward, the light gradually diminishes: the *po* grows while the *hun* wanes, yin advances and yang recedes—this mirrors the period from *wu* to *hai* within a single day. The progression and retreat, the extension and contraction of the *huohou*, follow the same pattern.

The *Yi* speaks of yin transforming into yang. After the tenth month, the first yang returns in revival—this is the heart of Heaven, manifest in the center of the *zi* position in the north. The revival corresponds to the eleventh month’s hexagram, precisely aligned with the *zi* position in the north. Its qi responds to the winter solstice, accumulating to form a single yang line concealed beneath the hexagram—hence it is called *Fu* (Return).

This mechanism does not lie solely in the initial moment of the winter solstice at *zi*; it resides within our own bodies. Without profound comprehension of the workings of creation, its secrets remain unknown. The *qian* line descends to the initial line of the *kun* mother, forming *zhen* (Thunder). *Zhen* is the eldest son, thus it is said, "The eldest son inherits the father’s body." *Zhen* arises from the body of *kun*, just as an infant is born from its mother’s womb—hence it is said, "It establishes its foundation through the mother." Scholars who grasp this will understand that in refining the elixir, one need not seek the winter solstice; within the body, a single yang naturally arises, unbound by rigid adherence to the calendar.

There are years, months, days, and hours. From *zi* to *si* is *xi* (growth); from *wu* to *hai* is *xiao* (decline). The waxing and waning correspond to the twelve pitch-pipes: each month, one pipe is changed, and over a year, all twelve are cycled through—just as the *huohou* waxes and wanes. From below to above is *sheng* (ascent); from above to below is *jiang* (descent). The ascent and descent follow the pivot of the Dipper: each hour, the Dipper shifts one position, traversing all twelve celestial markers in a day—just as the *huohou* ascends and descends.

If one reverses this and seeks it within the body, the subtleties may be silently guarded. On the third day of the month, the moon begins to wax...

At the birth of light, dusk resides in the west at the *geng* position, its image like *Zhen* (☳), corresponding to the *Zhen* hexagram’s reception of *geng*. In terms of the body’s *huohou*, this is the moment when the "River Chariot" dare not pause even briefly.

By the eighth day of the month, the moon reaches *shangxian*; dusk is in the south at the *ding* position, its image like *Dui* (☱), corresponding to the *Dui* hexagram’s reception of *ding*. This illustrates the halfway ascent of the body’s yang fire.

By the fifteenth day, the moon faces the sun; dusk is in the east at the *jia* position, its image like *Qian* (☰), corresponding to the *Qian* hexagram’s reception of *jia*. This signifies the body’s moment of full yang abundance.

The toad is the essence of the moon; the rabbit’s soul is the light of the sun. Sun and moon are not doubly bright: the sun shines by day, the moon by night. When the sun rises, the moon sets; when the moon rises, the sun sets. Day and night alternate in illumination, their emergence and retreat like the rolling and unfurling of a scroll.

Man’s breath is none other than the sun and moon—how is this different?

In the alchemical method, the first half of the month is yang, belonging to *Zhen*, *Dui*, and *Qian*; the latter half is yin, belonging to *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Kun*. Thus it is said: the toad gazes at the hexagrams’ nodes. The moon is *Taiyin*, governing reception; the sun is *Taiyang*, governing emission. The moon has no light of its own but receives the sun’s light to become white—hence it is said to "emit born light." Seven and eight make fifteen: the yang fire ascends from *Zhen* until, by the fifteenth day, it is pure *Qian*, having reached fullness. The momentum of the first half of the month is at its peak, its Dao perilous—it can no longer avoid bending, turning, and descending.

By the sixteenth day of the month, the "living soul" is born; dawn is in the west at the *xin* position, its light a single crescent. Its image is like *Xun* (☴), corresponding to the *Xun* hexagram’s reception of *xin*. In terms of the body’s *huohou*, this is the moment when yin receives yang’s succession, the path winding and turning.

By the twenty-third day, the moon reaches *xiaxian*; dawn is in the south at the *bing* position, its light half a crescent. Its image is like *Gen* (☶), corresponding to the *Gen* hexagram’s reception of *bing*. This illustrates the halfway descent of the body’s yin tally.

By the thirtieth day, the moon is dark; dawn is in the east at the *yi* position, its light entirely lost. Its image is like *Kun* (☷), corresponding to the *Kun* hexagram’s reception of *yi*. This signifies the body’s moment of yin tally’s exhaustion.

A month is divided into six nodes, each node comprising five days. From the new moon’s dawn, five days belong to *Zhen*, then sequentially to *Dui*, *Qian*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Kun*—thus the six nodes are complete.

Yet after the conjunction of sun and moon, yang again receives yin’s succession, transforming back into *Zhen*. *Zhen* is the dragon, with one yang stirring beneath two yin.

*Qian* receives *jia* and *ren*; *Kun* receives *yi* and *gui*. Thus it is said they pair: the ten Celestial Stems begin with *jia* and *yi*, end with *ren* and *gui*—hence they encompass beginning and end. The body’s *huohou* in its drawing and adding is no different from the moon’s waxing and waning.

Seven is the number of fire; eight is the number of wood.

When combined, they yield fifteen—the nine being the number of metal. Six is the number of water; combined, they also yield fifteen. The four together total thirty, corresponding to the thirty days of a month. When the count of thirty is complete, sun and moon conjoin as jade disks, and the *Yi*’s images vanish into concealment.

This resembles the mid-winter node, when grasses and trees all wither and assist yang in its seclusion. Merchants and travelers halt their journeys; the lord deeply conceals himself. The image accords with the season’s decree: mouths close, and none speak of the Dao of Heaven—so vast and boundless, so profoundly formless, so empty and still that it cannot be perceived. Only by dissolving the outer frame can delusion and error be dispelled, lest one’s undertakings end in ruin. Thus, I set forth these Four Images to enlighten those blind to the truth.

**Zhenyi Zi (Peng Xiao) says:**
In cultivating the elixir, the fire-timing may branch and flourish like stems, or bear fruit in ripened abundance, or wither like grasses and trees—responding to mid-winter’s opening and closing, all in accord with the fire’s movement. The merchants and travelers who assist yang in its seclusion are like sealing the passes and prohibiting travel, symbolizing the firm closure of the crucible to prevent leakage of true essence and true qi. The lord who deeply conceals himself is the Golden Mother of the Central Palace. The closed mouth that does not speak is the chamber of *Dui* metal. The Dao of Heaven is vast and boundless, so the transformations within the crucible are limitless; the Great Profundity is formless, so the fluids of metal and water are unfathomable, their subtle workings infinite, their divine transformations without direction. As the four seasons shift, the outer frame dissolves, and the forms of metal and water transmute.

**Xu Jun says:**
The Great Dao nurtures the true master without form. If one does not regulate and harmonize yin and yang with method and imagery, restraining and binding them to subtle transformations, how can one contend with the celestial mechanism to draw in the essences of sun and moon, retaining them within the crucible’s narrow chamber to achieve wondrous transformation? If one errs in the thread of affairs, ruin is certain. Thus, I compose this text to awaken those yet unenlightened.

**Baoyi Zi (Chen Xianwei) says:**
At the mid-winter node, the myriad things return to their roots. At this time, the workings of creation are unfathomable. Observing the Dao of Heaven, one finds it sealed and impassable, vast and unknowable. Examining the Great Profundity, one sees only emptiness and stillness, hidden and formless—what basis is there to fathom the mechanism of creation? Xu Jun distinguishes the Four Images to instruct later generations, as detailed in the following chapter.

**Shangyang Zi (Chen Zhixu) says:**
From *"This resembles the mid-winter node..."* to *"to enlighten those blind to the truth"*—fourteen sentences remain unclear.

**Quanyang Zi (Yu Yan) says:**
In the alchemical method, the winter solstice, the last day of the lunar month, and the new moon all serve as metaphors for the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang begins to stir. When mid-winter arrives, grasses and trees wither completely. The *Yi* says: *"Thunder lies within the earth—*Fu*. The former kings, on reaching the solstice, closed the passes; merchants and travelers did not journey; rulers did not inspect the regions."* This is to cultivate stillness to nurture movement and to accord with the Dao of Heaven.

Yet the Dao of Heaven is vast, and the true mechanism lies within a single instant; the Great Profundity is formless, and the wondrous resides within the subtle and obscure. Thus, at the moment of the winter solstice, one must first seal the *Dui* trigram, calm the heart, and guard silence, causing metal and mercury to return together to the crucible. Like sun and moon conjoining as jade disks, their outer frames hidden, they sink into the profound emptiness. Then spirit congeals, qi gathers, and the golden liquid coagulates. This is the oral instruction for elixir cultivation: gathering qi and congealing spirit are the foremost principles.

If scholars do not know to gather qi and congeal spirit, forgetting restraint and silence, they will recklessly ascend the towering edifice, dissipating into the vast emptiness, becoming like inert wood or dead ashes—thus inviting their own ruin. Later scholars, failing to grasp the essentials, blindly lead the blind, mistakenly taking the waxing and waning of the three-day moon as the fire-timing for a full month. Therefore, I distinguish these Four Images of seven, eight, nine, and six to enlighten the unenlightened, that they may understand the thirty days of a month as metaphorical, not literal—referring to the third day’s fire advancement and the sixth day’s receipt of the tally.

If scholars comprehend that seven, eight, nine, and six correspond to the thirty days of a month, then all other indirect metaphors can be silently recognized. Why cling to the text or adhere rigidly to images?

The Eight Trigrams are arrayed; the luminaries shift without losing the central origin. The subtle essence is difficult to perceive, so one infers, verifies, and establishes standards. By observing images, one models their forms; by setting markers, one defines the scope. Through divination, one determines fortune or misfortune, issues commands in accord with the seasons, and never misses the moment of a moving line. Above, one observes the patterns of the Milky Way; below, one sequences the flows of earth’s terrain; in the center, one examines the human heart. By integrating and investigating the Three Powers, when active, one observes the trigram’s nodes; when still, one follows the *Tuan*’s words. *Qian* and *Kun* are employed to act as Heaven and Earth—only then is there order.

**Zhenyi Zi (Peng Xiao) says:**
When circulating the fire for a month, one follows the Eight Trigrams’ array and the luminaries’ movement—north and south, east and west—drawing and adding, ascending and descending. Thus, yin and yang unfold and contract, harmonizing metal and water. If the fire’s movement is mistimed, leading to unseasonable rains or droughts, the principles of growth and completion are disrupted, and the forms of dragon and tiger cannot be retained. Those who circulate the fire must carefully consider this.

*Yuanjing* is the divine spirit within the crucible, the true essence, the primordial qi of Heaven and Earth. It cannot be grasped or seen, yet it subtly follows the mechanism of transformation, giving birth to the myriad things. Though profoundly subtle and difficult to perceive, one must infer, verify, and establish standards. By issuing commands and enacting decrees in accord with celestial signs, one observes the celestial patterns above and follows the terrestrial principles below, thereby uniting the souls of Heaven and Earth, harmonizing the severity and gentleness of yin and yang, and establishing the Three Powers. By aligning with the trigrams and following the line texts, arranging morning and evening, sequencing ascent and descent, *Qian* and *Kun* achieve peace, husband and wife harmonize, dragon and tiger unite, and Heaven and Earth are ordered.

Above, all is discussed in terms of following the clepsydra’s timing, circulating the tally-fire, clarifying the drawing and adding, distinguishing advance and retreat—none deviating from the movements of sun, moon, and stars. Thus, within the crucible, the myriad things are born in accord with the four seasons, and the divine essence is perfected.

**Baoyi Zi (Chen Xianwei) says:**
If the movement does not lose its center, it accords with creation without error and aligns with the trigrams and lines without deviation.

*Yuanjing* is the most numinous and divine treasure, born from emptiness and nothingness, without form or image to perceive, dwelling in the subtle and indistinct, without trace or track to pursue. To gather it, one must thoroughly understand yin and yang, deeply penetrate creation, infer its signs, verify its methods, and establish standards. When still, observe images to model their forms; when active, set markers to divine fortune or misfortune. Above, examine the celestial patterns; below, observe the tides; in the center, examine the human heart. One must follow the trigram’s nodes: when yang is active, do not miss the moment of a moving line; when yin is still, do not lose the principle of utmost softness and contained radiance. In this way, the powers of *Qian* and *Kun* are at one’s disposal, and the divine essence of spirit can be gathered.

Moreover, when the eight winds harmonize, sweet dew descends; when yin and yang are balanced, sweet springs arise—these are the signs of Heaven and Earth in order.

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhixu, states: Thus we know the eight trigrams—*Qian* and *Kan* reside in the north, *Gen* and *Zhen* return to the east, *Xun* and *Li* face the south, *Kun* and *Dui* revert to the west—interweaving and arraying their radiance, shifting and revolving without losing the center. This center is the celestial heart, the Great Central Ultimate, the primordial essence of the original *qi*, subtle and beyond perception. Heaven generates the sage, who infers, measures, and verifies through signs and proofs. Observing the images of the sun and moon, one models their forms; like the celestial observer who erects a gnomon to measure shadows and set standards, one divines the seasons and determines fortune or misfortune. At the first command, one must align with the seasons, emulate the movement of lines, and know when yang arises. Above, examine the *Hetu* to clarify the images of *Qian* and the interplay of yin and yang; below, sequence the earth’s forms to detail the body of *Kun* and the wondrous transformations of metal and water. Within, examine the human heart, issuing commands in accord with the seasons, moving in step with the trigram’s nodes. When *Zhen* stirs first, stillness follows the *Tuan* commentary. How great is *Qian*’s primordial power! Clouds drift, rain falls, the myriad beings flow and flourish, embracing vastness and brilliance. Gentle and yielding, it moves with steadfast integrity. When the celestial patterns are examined, the earth’s forms sequenced, and the human heart rectified, the gates of *Qian* and *Kun* open, and the Dao of yin and yang is enacted, allowing Heaven, Earth, and all beings to attain the governance of spontaneity.

This passage cites the sage’s investigation of antiquity and observation of Heaven as a metaphor: the union of sun and moon, the functions of *Qian* and *Kun*, enabling people to distinguish yin and yang, recognize advance and retreat, comprehend creation, model forms, respond to signs, and regulate movement and stillness. In this way, the Heaven and Earth within the body are brought to order.

It is not a matter of extracting or adding within the cauldron of dragon and tiger. Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, says: In the method of elixir refinement, the eight directions are arrayed with the eight trigrams, and the twenty-eight constellations are arranged in a circuit. Yet the sun and moon travel along the ecliptic, never deviating from the center. Thus the monkey of the mind does not bolt outward, and the elixir naturally coalesces.

The *Daodejing* states: “Abstruse, oh! Obscure, oh! Within it is essence. Its essence is most real; within it is sincerity.” The primordial essence resides in the body, subtle and unobservable. Yet the elixir method aligns with creation: when Heaven’s sincerity arrives, the jade bell tolls once, and the twin caves of the Jade Grotto open. When the *Kan* and *Li* of the body intermingle, the two banks ascend together and merge as one—this is the sign of the primordial essence’s generation.

Moreover, in stillness and profound silence, observe the image of *Qian*: “The movement of Heaven is strong; the noble person ceaselessly strengthens the self.” This is the movement of Heaven and the modeling of its form. Though the elixir method does not rely on fixed hours, when spirit and *qi* harmonize, inner and outer align; when spirit is dull and *qi* restless, the shadow and time diverge, and one cannot but stabilize them. Thus, like the celestial observer who erects a gnomon to measure shadows and set standards, one may divine whether the firing times are balanced and determine fortune or misfortune.

When the thunder of Earth shakes and the gate of *Xun* opens, the dragon faces east, and the deep pool leaps—this is the moment when a single yang line stirs within the body. At this time, warm *qi* surges and merges, the heart feels a fleeting trance, and one must advance the fire without delay, lest the moment be lost. The *Huanyuan* chapter states: “When the myriad winds first rise and the thousand mountains’ moon is newly full, hasten to issue the command and circulate the *zhou tian*—this is the meaning.”

Thus we see that Master Xu’s words also follow the *Yi*. The *Shangqing* Collection states: “By observing the Dipper’s handle circulate the *zhou tian*, one suddenly awakens to the immortal’s wondrous secret. When true yang arises in the *Kan* position, it repairs the deficiency of the *Li* palace. Since ancient times, *Qian* and *Kun*, *Kan* and *Li*, the sun and moon have never ceased. This year, at the winter solstice, the plum blossoms still congeal in the snow. The ancient sages closed their gates on this day, cutting off all comings and goings—all for the sake of the multitude of beings. Every being contains the intent of generation; it lies in the first moment of *zi* and the last of *hai*. Creation is soundless, yet fire arises in water—its wonder lies in the *xuwei* cavity. Now that the golden crow has been seen flying into the toad’s cave, this too is the Dao of Heaven.”

The ancients who refined the elixir looked up to observe the celestial patterns, looked down to examine the earth’s principles, and examined the human heart within. Thus they emptied their minds, moved their spirits, turned the celestial gate, and revolved the earth’s axis. Above, they aligned with the luminous revolutions of the Milky Way; below, they corresponded to the ebb and flow of the sea tides. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, their sun, moon, stars, five phases, and eight trigrams are all gathered within the body—some as the crucible, some as the medicinal substances, some as the firing times. In a single inward gaze, the Three Powers are complete within the self, never seeking outside the body.

When the dragon appears and thunder sounds, a single yang stirs beneath six yin—one change yields *Fu*, two changes yield *Lin*, three changes yield *Tai*, four changes yield *Dazhuang*, five changes yield *Guai*, and six changes yield *Qian*. Thus yang *qi* pervades the six voids. The great medicine of the golden elixir must arise within utmost stillness. The *Tuan* commentary on *Kun* states: “Utmost, oh! *Kun*’s primordial power. The myriad beings rely on it for birth; it compliantly receives Heaven.” *Kun* is Earth, capable of embracing and receiving Heaven’s *qi*, thus all flourishing beings arise upon it. In the elixir method, yang *qi* gradually advances, just as the trigrams transform; the spirit returns to illumination, just as *Kun*’s virtue. This is why one must follow and emulate it.

Yet the intermingling of *Kan* and *Li* is called the lesser *zhou tian*. Only when *Qian* and *Kun* unite in *Gou* does the inner and outer both intermingle, initiating the operation of the greater *zhou tian*. Thus yin and yang intermingle, harmonious *qi* brings auspiciousness, and Heaven and Earth are ordered.

As for the utmost sages: Fu Xi first drew the eight trigrams, modeling Heaven and Earth; King Wen, the ancestor of emperors, structured the body and composed the line statements; Confucius, the most eminent of sages, supplemented them with the Ten Wings. These three lords, Heaven’s chosen, arose in succession, each governing their time. Though their steps varied in excellence and their merits differed, their achievements did not diverge. Their creations followed precedent, their measurements were precise to the fraction, their forms were easy to contemplate, and their portents were difficult to foresee. Their undertakings became models for the world, and they established these books as standards. Though lacking prior knowledge, Master Xu (referring to himself) awakened through his teacher (referring to Wei Boyang), as if lifting the curtain and gazing from a high terrace. The *Huoji*’s six hundred chapters point the way without confusion. Yet the text is solemn, and people do not ponder deeply to trace its source. The obscure and the manifest originally dwell together. I humbly speak for the worthy—how dare I treat the book lightly? Yet if I were to seal my lips and silence the Dao, I would incur the crime of punishment. To express my thoughts on bamboo and silk might risk leaking Heaven’s tally. Alone, I sigh in anticipation, looking up and down, and compile these foolish words. The methods of refinement have their standards, which cannot be fully expounded. I briefly outline their essentials; the branches and leaves will be seen in their luxuriance.

Master Zhenyi, Peng Xiao, states: Master Xu praised the three sages—Fu Xi, King Wen, and Confucius—Heaven-endowed with heroic spirit and mutually illuminating virtue. In expounding the *Yi*, they penetrated the sentiments of Heaven, Earth, and the myriad beings; in editing the *Book of Songs* and *Book of Documents*, they arranged the teachings of rulers, ministers, and the multitude. Moreover, they determined the line images, analyzed the fractions, and controlled the calculations of the celestial cycles, exhausting the great Dao. Though Heaven and Earth are vast, they cannot conceal the mechanisms of closure and opening; though yin and yang are utterly empty, they cannot hide the numbers of movement and stillness. Thus the sages followed them, taking counsel from the great Dao. They used *Qian* and *Kun* to image the crucible and chamber, causing the embrace of the One *qi* to govern the myriad spirits, and the passage of yin and yang through the time markers to traverse the six voids and generate the multitude of beings. Yet the forms that are easy to contemplate belong to Heaven and Earth.

The signs without omen are difficult to strategize—these are yin and yang. If not for the Three Sages’ unfolding of the *Yi*, by what path would water and fire be deployed? If not for the teachings bequeathed through ten thousand generations, by what gate would the dragon and tiger be harnessed? Thus it is said: "Without prior knowledge, one awakens through this." As if lifting the curtain, clarity reveals what is seen; as if ascending a high tower, one still cannot fathom its limit—this metaphor illustrates the Dao of the sages: the higher one gazes, the loftier it becomes; the deeper one delves, the more impenetrable it grows.

Following the Dao of the *Yi*, the *Fire Record* was further elucidated. The *Fire Record* of six hundred chapters embodies the great reckoning of the cyclical stars. "Morning *tun*, evening *feng*"—each corresponds to a hexagram, directly aligning with affairs. Thus, the six hundred chapters, in their sequential order, are all identical. Therefore, the year aligns with the month, the month with the day, the day with the hour.

Master Xu, though unwilling to seal his tongue and obscure the great Dao, also dared not openly inscribe bamboo and silk to leak the celestial mechanism. Hesitant and sighing, he deeply pondered the inadequacy for posterity. Thus, he briefly outlined the essential principles, slightly revealing the branches, while the remaining subtleties were preserved in oral instructions.

Master Chen Xianwei of Baoyi said: Master Xu’s innate endowment was exceptional, yet even he relied on his teacher for awakening. Thus, he sighed that the wondrous principle of the Golden Elixir, being without form or omen, is truly difficult to fathom. Though the Three Sages embedded this principle within the *Yijing*, and the eight trigrams interweave the mysterious workings of creation, the images point to the marvels of formed things, and words manifest the achievements of foreseeable signs. Comparing this with the *Cantong Qi*, it still adheres to worldly methods. Though the sages meticulously divided and crafted, enabling learners to explore and seek, how could they guard the secret within the text, transcending images? If the *Cantong Qi* were not composed, how could this be clarified? This is why Master Xu, in accordance with books that exhaust principle and fulfill nature, illuminated the path of transcending the ordinary and entering sageliness—like holding the left tally, like lifting the front curtain. It fundamentally arises from the teacher-disciple transmission, not from prior knowledge. Thus, we know that though the celestial mechanism is distant, every person has a share; though the great Dao is not remote, each generation finds its inheritor. Do not say that only those with innate immortal bones may aspire—know only that with a willing heart, nothing is impossible.

Reviewing Master Xu’s humble words before and after, one realizes the compassion of past perfected beings. Scholars of later ages, encountering alchemical classics and purple texts, descriptions of fire phases, the functions of advancing and retreating, civil and martial arts, and the distinctions of beginning and end, start and stop—few are without doubt. Thus, many scriptures state there are six hundred chapters to convey the functions of fire phases. Yet they do not know that though the words differ, the principle is one; though the applications vary, the use is the same. Once one recognizes the reversal of "morning *tun*, evening *feng*," one understands the cyclical return of "day *gou*, night *fu*"—like the turning of the celestial sphere, like following wheel tracks. Though the wording is solemn, the transmission is earnest. Thus, the six hundred chapters complete the three hundred days, never exceeding the two hexagrams of advance and retreat. It depends solely on the sincerity of beginning and end, the precision of intent, and unwavering focus.

Alas! The sagely words are not concealed, yet without deep reflection—Master Xu further expounded three chapters, all embodying the same principle. His aim was to systematically analyze the essentials and expound the methods, making it easier for later learners to comprehend. How vast!

Master Chen Zhixu of Shangyang said: These words on the Three Sages’ establishment of teachings and transmission of instructions follow the intent to honor past and future sages. Confucius, in his *Wings*, said: "In ancient times, when Fuxi ruled the world, he looked up to observe the images in heaven, looked down to observe the patterns on earth, and examined the markings of birds and beasts and their suitability to the land. He drew near and took from his own body, drew far and took from other things. Thereupon, he first drew the eight trigrams to communicate with the virtue of the numinous and to categorize the conditions of the myriad things." King Wen structured the body and unfolded the line statements, revealing the wonder of "gaining friends in the southwest." What are the Ten Wings? They assist the *Yi*.

The *Yi* as a book: Fuxi drew the trigrams, King Wen appended the line statements, and the Duke of Zhou wrote the line texts—these form the two chapters called the *Main Classic*. Confucius, after the *Main Classic*, added ten chapters as wings: *Upper Commentary on the Decision*, *Lower Commentary on the Decision*, *Great Images*, *Small Images*, *Appended Statements (Part One)*, *Appended Statements (Part Two)*, *Words of the Text*, *Explaining the Trigrams (Part One)*, *Explaining the Trigrams (Part Two)*, and *Explaining the Trigrams (Part Three)*—these ten chapters are the Ten Wings. Originally, they explained the *Yi*, yet they are not called "explanations" but "wings," for they assist the Dao of the *Yi*.

Without the Ten Wings, how would the Dao of the *Yi* be illuminated? How would words communicate change? How would movement be recognized? How would vessels be fashioned? If the Dao is not communicated through words, the resonance of feelings and nature cannot be attained. If the Dao does not know change and movement, the transformation of metal and water cannot be achieved. If the Dao is not skilled in fashioning vessels, the use of the crucible and furnace cannot be obtained. If the Dao does not comprehend fortune and misfortune, the principles of reversal and compliance cannot be grasped. The *Wings* say: "The *Yi* contains the four Dao of the sage"—this is it. Thus, when the noble person is about to act...

When about to take action, one inquires and, through words, receives the mandate—as an echo responds without regard to distance, remoteness, obscurity, or depth, thus knowing what is to come. For obscurity and depth are what we call "dim and indistinct, faint and elusive." When the noble person acts or moves, it must be within this dim and indistinct, faint and elusive realm that they know what is to come. If not for the utmost refinement in all under heaven, who could partake in this?

Master Xu said: "The Ten Wings assist it"—these words exhaust the matter. The sage’s merit and function equally benefit later generations, yet scholars may lack the great good fortune and virtue, the great wisdom, to fully inherit it. A thousand kinds of obstructions prevent them from seeing or hearing. The Three Sages arose in succession, creating and measuring, establishing a model for ten thousand generations. We must revere the supreme Dao: heaven produces sages and wise ones, yet how could there be self-realization without a teacher’s transmission? Those endowed with intelligence, planning, and deliberation may still encounter obstacles. But if a benevolent and worthy person diligently investigates to the utmost, suddenly gaining the teacher’s guidance, their mind and chest become open and clear—just as if, in a room, the curtains were drawn back, revealing everything distinctly and penetratingly, as if one had opened their eyes and ascended a high terrace: what would not be seen?

If one does not seek a teacher, how could they awaken? Should they find a teacher, they must first examine the *Book of the Kinship of the Three*. If they can clarify every sentence and thoroughly comprehend every chapter, this is true attainment. But if even one sentence remains vague or ambiguous, it cannot be trusted. To claim there is another path to accomplish the Dao apart from this book is a great deception of others. Why? Because this book is what King Wen, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius inherited from Fuxi.

Thus Master Xu said: "Among the many sages and heroes of later ages, who could surpass Confucius?"

Alas! Moreover, the *Yellow Emperor’s Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman* and Laozi’s *Five Thousand Characters of the Dao and Virtue* align without discrepancy—only by illuminating this Way. Thus, the Celestial Master of the Ancestral Lineage, Xu, and the immortals Fuqiu and others all entered the Dao through this. Likewise, works such as *Ziyang’s Awakening to Reality*, *The Supervisor of the Back Channel*, and *Questions on the Golden Elixir* all trace their origins to the *Book of the Kinship of the Three*. When compared with Buddhist sutras and Daoist scriptures, all harmonize with this text. Yet if someone claims, "My teacher is so-and-so, who in turn studied under so-and-so," and their teachings flow like a river, yet when asked about the *Book of the Kinship of the Three*, they remain largely ignorant—these are seeds of hell. They falsely assert that the supreme Way does not reside in written texts, deceiving and blindly leading others. Who would know that only by verifying this book’s authenticity can one truly begin?

Moreover, the *Six Hundred Fire Records*—with their timings, hexagram symbols, esoteric words, and wondrous phrases—from beginning to end are solemn and weighty. Yet if one does not deeply ponder and trace their source, how can they grasp the shared mystery of the hidden and the manifest? This book is meant for the wise to discuss; how dare one speak of it lightly? If one were to remain silent, where would the Way be expounded? Yet to fully reveal it in writing would leak the celestial tally. Those who hesitate and sigh in regret are like the creature called *youyu*—a beast of many doubts. Dwelling in the mountains, upon hearing a sound, it climbs up and down trees repeatedly, unable to decide. Thus, it is named *youyu* ("hesitation"). Master Xu himself said: "Hesitating at the riverbank, fearing the peril, one only increases their sighs, looking up and down again and again, delaying this text’s transmission."

Yet in refining later generations, there are methods of concealment and revelation, though their oral instructions cannot be fully disclosed. Here, only the main principles are outlined, with branches briefly glimpsed. Quanziyang Yu Yan said: "Fuxi modeled heaven and earth to create the *Changes*, first drawing the eight trigrams. In the *Primordial Heaven* diagram, *Qian* is above, *Kun* below, *Li* to the east, *Kan* to the west, with *Zhen*, *Xun*, *Gen*, and *Dui* arrayed at the four corners. King Wen followed the trigrams’ structure to compose the *Changes*’ line statements. In the *Later Heaven* diagram, the two woods *Zhen* and *Xun* generate *Li* fire, followed by *Kun* earth to store it; the two metals *Dui* and *Qian* generate *Kan* water, followed by *Gen* earth to restrain it. Though Confucius held no official position, he became the teacher of emperors for ten thousand generations—truly the foremost among the many sages. He composed the *Ten Wings* to elucidate the *Changes*. These three noble men, all ancient great sages, arose in succession to govern their times. Though their steps and strides differed in excellence, when measured by their merit and virtue, they were of one standard, without distinction.

Moreover, in the eight trigrams’ line statements and the *Ten Wings*, there are no superfluous words, no extraneous characters. Their deliberations on weight and light are exceedingly detailed and precise, and their compositions all follow a precedent. Now, the *Book of the Kinship of the Three* by Wei Boyang borrows the *Changes*’ trigram imagery to expound the Dao—truly, it follows a precedent. The elixir method has no form, no sign; it cannot be measured by calculation or deliberation. If not demonstrated in words, how could later generations take it as a model? This is why the *Book of the Kinship of the Three* was written.

Yet how could Master Xu have expressed his own views? He merely recorded the teachings passed down by his teacher. If one today can seek a teacher and visit friends with a sincere and empty heart, true immortals will follow at their doorstep, imparting oral instructions. In an instant, all doubts vanish, as if the curtains were drawn back and all obstructions removed—bright as ascending a high terrace to gaze upon the vast wilderness. How joyous!

Later learners, failing to grasp the true trap, see the *Six Hundred Fire Records* and are invariably dismayed, thinking the fire timings so intricate and difficult. They do not realize that the *Six Hundred Records* are like the sixty hexagrams representing a month’s timing, while the *Six Hundred Records* span ten months’ timing. For the sixty hexagrams are uniform, and the six hundred records are likewise similar. Thus, it is said: "Their aims are not different." From ancient times to today, elixir texts number in the thousands, with countless words—could this not be called solemn and weighty? Yet when tracing their source, it is but one yin and one yang. These two, though named differently, share the same origin. The ancient immortals poured out their hearts to inform others, yet the people of the world, their blessings and karmic conditions shallow, had no leisure to ponder deeply.

Now, the *Book of the Kinship of the Three* elucidates the origins of the cauldron and vessel, the sources of the medicinal substances, the methods of fire timing, and the esoteric words on existence and nonexistence, host and guest, priority and sequence. Every word is thorough and substantial, composed for the world’s worthy ones. How could it be lightly written to fish for empty fame? The *Supreme Mysterious Regulations* states: "To meet someone and not transmit is to lose the celestial Way; to transmit to the unworthy is to leak the celestial treasure. If one obtains the right person, their body gains merit; if one recklessly transmits, for seven generations they will suffer its consequences." Thus, Master Xu wished to remain silent, fearing that uttering a single word might sever the Dao’s lineage and incur guilt. Yet to express his feelings in writing would risk leaking the celestial tally and inviting punishment. Hence, he hesitated, sighed, looked up and down, and pondered deeply. Though he wished to speak plainly, he dared not lightly reveal the true mechanism. Instead, he described the cauldron, medicinal substances, and fire timings in broad strokes, allowing later generations to infer the meaning from the words. Perhaps this Way would not perish in transmission.

Yet unable to bear either speaking clearly or remaining silent, he could only present its grand principles and extract its essential mechanisms, refining and shaping the methods scattered across the three chapters—like branches spreading out in luxuriance.

The burning-mirror draws fire only when facing the sun; the moon-pearl yields no water unless turned toward the moon. These two qi, though distant and subtle, still respond and transform—how much more so the intimate qi residing within the body, close at heart and breast, where yin and yang pair as sun and moon, water and fire, manifesting their effects as clear signs.

Master True Unity Peng Xiao says: The burning-mirror and moon-pearl respond to qi and still produce water and fire. Heaven and earth, sun and moon, set forth their images—how could they not generate and complete? Taking the near from the body and the far from things, one first gathers the Mother of Heaven and Earth to lay the foundation of the elixir, then unites the essence of sun and moon to serve as the ancestor of the medicine. When lead and mercury give rise to one another, water and fire restrain each other—how could there be no proof of efficacy?

Master Embracing Unity Chen Xianwei says: The burning-mirror is made by refining five-colored stone into a mirror, which, when turned toward the sun with mugwort, draws fire. The *Huainanzi* calls it the "fire-pearl." There is also the "water-pearl," made of crystal, which, when turned toward the moon, yields water—this is called the "yin-mirror." Without the sun and moon, neither the burning-mirror nor the moon-pearl can produce water or fire. Within the human body, the ascent and descent of yin and yang move in harmony with the transformations of heaven and earth. How could the principle of water and fire interflowing be external to the mechanism of the sun and moon’s mutual approach and exchange? This is sought as proof of their effects.

Master Upper Yang Chen Zhixu says: The burning-mirror is a yang object, containing qi within, so when it responds to the sun, it can generate fire. The moon-pearl is a yin object, containing essence within, so when it responds to the moon, it can generate water. The sun and moon hang high and distant in the sky, yet the burning-mirror and moon-pearl, though far apart, still allow yin and yang qi to respond and transform. How much more so the true yin and true yang within the human body, close at heart and breast, intimate and easily sought—how could they not respond and transform? The obstacle lies only in later generations failing to grasp the Way.

The yin and yang of the human body correspond to the sun and moon in the sky, while the water and fire of the various mirrors serve as metaphors for the essence and qi within the body. Even inanimate objects still respond thus—how much more so beings with consciousness and spirit, which naturally interact! Among all things between heaven and earth, humans are the most spiritually endowed. Even the basest and most foolish know the principle of yin and yang’s transformative nurturing without needing instruction to act accordingly. Yet all the deluded and confused know only to follow the natural course to generate beings. As for reversing its use, without a teacher, none can fathom it. Reversing the use of yin and yang is the Way of refining essence and subduing qi to form the elixir.

This passage simply clarifies how the two qi of yin and yang respond and transform to accomplish creation.

Master Complete Yang Yu Yan says: The *Rites of Zhou*, in the "Autumn Office," states that the Officer of Fire is in charge of using the wooden burning-mirror to draw bright fire from the sun and the moon-pearl to draw bright water from the moon. The moon-pearl, or yin-mirror, is a large clam, polished smooth and lustrous. When turned toward the moon, water is produced. The sun and moon hang in the vastness of space, countless thousands of miles from earth, yet the burning-mirror obtains fire from the sun, and the moon-pearl obtains water from the moon—how swiftly they respond and transform! How much more so the water and fire that naturally reside within the body, close at heart and breast, where the medicinal materials already exist. If one can empty the mind, concentrate the spirit, and inwardly settle without a single stray thought, gathering the light of one’s own sun and moon within the body, then over time, when the qi stabilizes and stillness arrives, extraordinary effects will naturally arise. The supreme Way is not distant—it is always before our eyes. When yin and yang attain harmony, they naturally respond and transform. Hares conceive, clams form pearls—they still steal from heaven and earth, seizing the work of creation. Yet people remain deluded and forget to return, unable to seek within.

The three treasures—ears, eyes, and mouth—must be closed and sealed, not allowed to issue forth. The Perfected One dives into the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the center of the compass. Rotating and curving, sight and hearing open and close, all converging to serve as the body’s pivot. In movement and stillness, never exhausted, the qi of *li* and *kan* inwardly flourish, while the defense of *kan* does not employ hearing, and the closure of *dui* does not engage speech. Following the primordial chaos, these three are locked and sealed. The body rests in an empty chamber, the will entrusted to emptiness, with no-thought as the constant. The proof is difficult to shift: the mind is focused, never straying. In sleep, the spirit is embraced; in waking, its presence or absence is awaited. The complexion gradually moistens, the bones and joints grow stronger. Expelling the host of yin demons, one then establishes the true yang and cultivates it without ceasing. May the qi of clouds and rain flow abundantly, like spring rains, trickling like melting ice. From the head, it flows down to the feet, then ascends again, circulating endlessly, penetrating the infinite. The inner countenance is suffused with warmth, returning to the center—this is the verification of the Way. The weak is the handle of virtue. Plowing and weeding the long-accumulated filth, the fine qi becomes harmonious and smooth. The turbid is the path to clarity; prolonged darkness will give way to brightness.

Master True Unity Peng Xiao says: The *Book of Changes* states: *Kan* is the ear, *li* is the eye, *dui* is the mouth. *Kan*, *li*, and *dui* are water, fire, and metal. The key is to seal water and fire, enclosing the Golden Mother. The infant and the maiden are the Perfected Ones, floating and roaming within the womb, causing the mother’s body to relax and rest in the empty vessel, with no movement of thought, to verify its naturalness—the mutual generation of male and female.

Once the cauldron’s yin and yang ascend and descend in harmony, the dragon and tiger within the womb rise and fall, embracing and securing the true essence. The complexion gradually moistens, the bones and joints grow stronger. Cultivating without cease, over time, proof will appear. Drawing out the yin fire means expelling yin demons; inserting the yang tally means properly arousing the yang. Circulating endlessly, the spirit chamber becomes peaceful. Clouds move, rain falls, the golden liquid flows perpetually, like ice melting, suffusing from the feet to the head. The Perfected One’s body comes and goes, the Golden Mother’s form is restored. The fire qi is pent up within the cauldron, the golden essence guards the weak within the compass. Prolonged darkness gives way to brightness—this is the moment when yin reaches its extreme and yang arises, when clarity emerges from turbidity, when fire returns and water resumes. The four seasons alternate, the five phases interact. The reverse is the verification of the Way; the weak is the foundation of virtue.

Yang extends, yin withdraws: *kan* is the ear. To make it unhearing is to harmonize the yin spirit, causing the true water not to flow away. *Li* is the eye. To make it unseeing is to warmly nurture the yang soul, causing the true mercury not to escape. *Dui* is the mouth. To make it unspeaking is to seal the golden womb, preventing the opening and closing that would leak the red dragon’s essence.

Master Xu’s *True Kinship* in three chapters uses metaphors and allusions, drawing from the far and applying to the near. It speaks plainly yet conceals its meaning, neither wishing to openly reveal the celestial mechanism nor to obscure the supreme Way. Thus, it fully clarifies that the inner image and outer use are one. Master Embracing Unity Chen Xianwei says: The ear not hearing causes the water of *kan* to settle inwardly; the eye not seeing causes the fire of *li* to nurture inwardly; the mouth not speaking causes the metal of *dui* to remain silent. Once these three are closed, the Perfected One roams freely within. One must use no-thought, no-anxiety, never fretting or laboring, entrusting the will to emptiness, the mind focused and not straying. Resting the body in an empty chamber has no other meaning.

Thus, one must embrace the feminine, hold to unity, and relax the body, dwelling alone in an empty chamber. In sleep, the spirit embraces itself; in wakefulness, it secretly observes presence and absence. Only then can yin evil be expelled, pure yang accumulate within the body, and supreme harmony overflow—like ice melting into fluid, like spring’s warmth dissolving all, as qi moves like clouds and rain, like mist ascending and descending, flowing from head to foot. With unceasing practice, filth is entirely purged, sinews and bones harmonized, the complexion radiant, the skeletal frame sturdy, and blood transformed into white marrow. Both spirit and form attain perfection.

Yet once the seven gates return, one nearly forgets life; all meridians settle, form and qi dissipate, strength wanes, and one cannot endure—dazed and turbid as if drunk. This is the verification of the Dao, the handle of virtue.

Obscurity is the foundation of clarity; turbidity is the source of purity. From this point onward, perfect illumination, penetrating vision, emptiness, and spiritual communion all begin with obscurity and turbidity.

Master Upper Yang Chen Zhixu says: This passage meticulously reveals the secrets of refining the elixir in the chamber. Once a disciple receives the master’s oral instructions, they must recite this passage ten thousand times, pondering each sentence and scrutinizing every character. Do not read carelessly, for even a single word missed will fail to complete the elixir. This passage is the sharpest point of convergence in the *Cantong Qi*, where the unspeakable is treasured by heaven.

Moreover, though human nature at birth is without ungoodness, as one grows older—unless endowed with the capacity of a sage and resolutely guarding integrity—few remain untainted. External enticements by wanton friends and internal delusions by sensual pleasures and desires ensnare the six sense gates, where every sight, sound, and taste becomes an object of attachment. Day and night, each act erodes and poisons—most grievously, the ears, eyes, and mouth.

Hear with the ears, see with the eyes, and the mouth craves flavors—from this cause, fortune follows form to ruin, harm follows sound to arrive, illness enters through the mouth, and drunkenness and dreamlike death follow one another endlessly. How can there be an end? Most scholars fail to achieve the Dao because they are led astray by the three neighbors of the ears, eyes, and mouth, which mutually entice and drown their true nature. The immortal elders regard the ears, eyes, and mouth as the "Three Treasures," holding them in reverence and never daring to let them loose. Thus, they close and seal them, allowing no leakage. Only when entering the chamber does their great function manifest, and the six roots attain perfect stability—then one may gather and refine the true person, who is none other than one’s own earth.

Those who dwell in the deep abyss use their own earth to overcome water in seeking the elixir. Those who float and guard the compass’s center—this compass center is called the "cavern of creation." When refining the great elixir, in the instant of this single talisman, one must be most cautious and secretive. The floater must remain ever still yet ever responsive, never departing from this function for even a moment. The guardian must diligently turn inward, illuminating with sincerity, for there is indeed something to await. These two lines are again the sharpest point of convergence in the *Cantong Qi* annotations, akin to the work of wielding a great axe. Thus, the true immortals and sagely masters have uttered these profound words and dharma teachings, which no one in ten thousand generations can fathom. Master Shangyang, having fully revealed them, merely wishes that all may understand this Dao and practice it.

To "turn and curve in seeing and hearing" is not a dull, closed-off blockage. Within, one must turn and curve, yielding and cautious, to guard and regulate seeing and hearing, so that the opening and closing of earth (wu) are neither hidden nor exposed, merging with one’s own earth in harmony. If one swallows or guards, one’s nature may become reckless and wild—only by making earth (wu) its pivot and control can this be remedied. This is called "making it the pivot and control of oneself." What does it mean to be inexhaustible in movement and stillness? The Dao of oneself: in movement, it is direct; in stillness, it is focused. If skillfully employed, it will not lead to exhaustion.

To "detach qi and internally nourish and guard" is to withdraw the eyes’ gaze and inwardly illuminate. For "kan, do not use hearing" is to turn the ears inward and listen, so that hearing does not leak. For "dui, harmonize without speech," one refines words and regulates breath to comply with the transformations of primordial chaos. Only when these three are skillfully managed at the gate can the body relax in the empty chamber. To "relax the body" is to be at ease without strain; the "empty chamber" is stern and pure without杂. One entrusts the will to emptiness and nothingness, for nothingness is the place where qi is born. This is called the "primordial qi that comes from nothingness." To obtain this qi, one must bend and curve the will and thoughts to seek it.

"Without thought" is most useful as a constant. The true person dwelling in the deep abyss responds with "without thought." The floater guarding the compass’s center awaits with "without thought." Inhalation and exhalation nurture with "without thought." When the three natures unite, one enters with "without thought." To be able to respond, await, nurture, and enter—this work is only mastered through abundance, thus making it a constant.

That which is difficult to shift is called earth (wu), known as the White Tiger. The tiger’s nature is changeable, restless, and hard to stabilize. If one uses one’s own earth to guard it, one must never allow it to run rampant or shift. Should the heart lack focus, disasters and anomalies may arise. Earlier, it was said "without thought," and now it is said "the heart must be focused and not run rampant." Can one not reflect deeply on this?

In sleep, when spirit and qi embrace, the heart neither runs rampant nor shifts. At this moment of sleep, spirit and qi naturally unite as one. Yet one must remain ever awake and alert, awaiting the presence or absence of this single qi. Only at this stage of refining the elixir does one begin to personally know and verify the work. In the past, when I received my master’s instructions on this, I found it exceedingly difficult. Recently, practicing this great work on the northern slope of Mount Daluo, I have come to realize its ease. The great essential is to cultivate it without ceasing or resting, and only then can the full achievement be completed.

Thus, the immortal elders repeatedly clarify that during the gathering, firing, and refining of the elixir, not even a hair’s breadth of error is permissible. From the gradual moistening of one’s complexion downward, every line is sharply applied, with not a single line left idle. Only then, after obtaining the elixir, will the natural effects appear, and various signs of verification manifest. Those who cultivate this Dao dwell in the turbid, evil world of the five defilements, practicing the Dharma beyond the world. If one practices without interruption for a long time, success is certain. Do not, on account of minor demonic obstacles, abandon the path midway. This is what is meant by "the path of turbidity clears, and after long darkness, brightness returns."

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: To regard the ears, eyes, and mouth as the "Three Treasures" and say "close and seal, do not leak" is to wish that one restrains the ears’ and eyes’ clarity and seals the tongue’s true qi, gathering it all within and not letting it escape outward, like treasuring and hiding a precious jewel. To regard the original spirit as the "true person" and say "dwell in the deep abyss, guard the compass’s center" is to wish that it follows the true breath’s coming and going, allowing the true qi’s ascent and descent, so that from dawn to dusk, the original spirit always abides in the muddy pellet.

This is the simple and easy Dao. Gently stirring the gate at the crown of the head, evenly and silently lifting, the three palaces naturally ascend and descend, and the hundred bones and ten thousand apertures naturally flow and circulate. The *Huangji Jingshi* says: The heavens’ spirits dwell in the sun; humans’ spirits emerge from the eyes. At birth, one dwells in the realm before heaven and earth; at death, one returns to the realm before heaven and earth. The five phases gather here; the five viscera store the numinous here. Saliva, nasal mucus, essence, fluids, qi, blood, and liquid—these seven form the essence here. The great heaven and earth can contain it, yet the smallest speck of dust cannot enter—this is the great treasure within our bodies.

The elixir method of turning the light inward to illuminate the cinnabar field causes breath to unite with it, and the three palaces naturally ascend and descend, circulating endlessly without cease, like a wheel with its movement governed by the heart. The wheel’s pivot lies in the eyes, and its control lies in the linchpin. This is what is meant by "containing the light is the medicine of long life." "Detaching qi and internally nourishing and guarding" is to withdraw the eyes’ gaze so that the light does not leak. "For kan, do not use hearing" is to turn the ears inward to listen so that hearing does not leak.

For *dui* harmony, do not rely on speech; rare words follow the vast primordial chaos. Let the depths of the heart grow cold as ashes, silent and wordless—this guards the sacred embryo. With these three principles thus established, the next step is to relax the body in an empty chamber, moving slowly and at ease without straining the form. Enter a quiet room, free from worldly entanglements, and commit the will to guarding emptiness. Let the heart be free of stray thoughts, the mind not wander outward, and thus dwell all day in the play of true emptiness.

To make this a constant practice is to ensure thoughts follow one another without interruption, ever maintaining the qi’s bearing in accord with the Dao of heaven. Generally, in cultivation, each measure of effort yields a corresponding sign of verification. If one practices diligently, day and night without rest, after a hundred days of efficacious work, the two kidneys will simmer like boiling water, the bladder’s fire will blaze, the eyes will gleam with spirit-light, the ears will hear subtle resonances, the nose will detect rare fragrances, the mouth will fill with sweet fluids, and the entire body will melt into a flowing essence. These verifications advance day by day. What is most precious is a concentrated heart, never scattered or wayward—lest the principles remain obscure and, within the stillness of samādhi, one falls into a state between dream and waking, or is seized by demonic illusions.

For when spirit and qi first congeal, they are easily lost. During sleep, one must hold fast to the spirit, never sinking into confusion or drowning in dreams. Upon awakening, one should be like a hen brooding over her eggs, maintaining a continuous warmth lest the fire grow cold and the elixir’s formation be delayed. Thus, one must attend to its presence or absence throughout the twelve hours, whether moving, staying, sitting, or lying down, ever holding this in mind. Only then will the effort become pure, the medicinal ingredients not dissipate, and the firing times not falter—this alone may be called true cultivation. As Xia Yunfeng said: *"When the natural timing arrives, the dream elixir manifests."*

The Confucian method of "ever-wakeful awareness" applies here as well. As the complexion grows lustrous and the bones and joints grow strong, the deeper the treasure’s accumulation, the more flourishing the essence’s radiance—like jade concealed in a mountain, its brilliance shines forth, or a pearl hidden in a marsh, its beauty enchants. In the human body, all that has form is nothing but the turbid dregs of yin and impurity. The immortals’ cultivation consists in generating being from non-being, seizing the one true yang of heaven and earth to form the elixir’s beginning. Then, day and night, they circulate the fire to refine away the yin qi. After ten months, the embryo is complete; after three years, the work is fulfilled. Only then does the body transform into pure yang, the form transmuted into that of an immortal.

The *Tongxuan Secret Formula* states: *"Day and night, without rest, work the great elixir. When the essence pierces the crown, the hundred spirits submit in reverence. Able to dwell alone in a quiet chamber, continuing the work night after day without cease, one day it will suddenly penetrate through. Naturally, within the cinnabar field and sea of qi, the essence of great yin crosses the *weilü* cavity, guards the *jiaji* gate, blocks the *fengfu* wind-house, ascends to the *niwan* mud-pill, then descends through the *mingtang* bright hall, enters the nose’s bridge, and flows into the *huachi* flower pond, where it transforms into sweet fluids. Swallowed, it irrigates the five viscera and six bowels, reaching the cinnabar field. Above and below, it circulates in endless cycles, filling the four great limbs and returning to the beginning. The body is pervaded without exception, melting like mountain clouds rising into the great void, misting like fine rain moistening the wilds, abundant as spring waters filling the four marshes, fluid as river ice about to melt. It flows up and down, the hundred vessels surging and harmonizing, filling the valleys within and coursing through the four limbs. One feels the heart brimming with spring, the state resembling that of slight intoxication."*

The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"The primordial qi and the postnatal qi—those who obtain them are ever as if drunk."* If one practices only in the morning and abandons it by evening, how can one ever attain this with a scattered will? *"Reversion"* means turning back. The *Daodejing* says: *"Attain utmost emptiness, guard deep stillness. The ten thousand things arise together; I thereby observe their return."* For the effects of elixir refinement emerge from utmost emptiness and deep stillness, uniting with heaven and earth. Only then does the primordial qi return with the one yang. If emptiness is not utmost and stillness not deep, it is like building a mountain nine *ren* high but losing the final basket—how can one ever see verification?

*"Weakness"* means softness and yielding. The *Daodejing* says: *"Concentrate the qi to attain softness, able to be like an infant."* For the root of elixir cultivation lies in holding fast to the will without violence to the qi, like an infant’s softness and weakness. If the will is not guarded and the qi not nurtured, what is gained will be but a fraction, and what has been accumulated will crumble like a mountain cliff—what then can serve as the root and handle?

The elixir method of *"weeding and hoeing the old impurities"* means to quiet all concerns, dispel inauspicious qi, expel the ghostly corpse, and pacify the six senses. Within the five aggregates, in the midst of right mindfulness, one attains clarity, brightness, emptiness, and radiance. Then the five viscera grow cool, the six bowels harmonize, the three hundred and sixty joints and eighty-four thousand pores are free of obstruction, all flowing smoothly, and the Dao-qi abides constantly.

It is like cutting away the roots of noxious weeds to prevent their regrowth, allowing the good to flourish. The *Cui Xu Pian* says: *"When spirit and qi unite at the proper time, bones and flesh melt and harmonize—one does not even know it."* At this moment, the three fields are full of qi, and one feels as if in a dream. Could this be called turbid confusion? The student who reaches this state must not slacken, for turbidity will eventually clear and obscurity will eventually brighten. When the time arrives and qi transforms, the spirit-light will naturally appear, each part growing bright and clear, all manifesting within the realm of the indistinct. How could this end in turbidity?

Gradually, the *"yellow center"* opens, the principle permeates, and moisture reaches the skin. The beginning is upright, so the end is cultivated; the trunk stands firm, and the branches may be grasped. One who conceals this to deceive the world remains unknown. Peng Xiao of *Zhenyi Zi* said: The *Book of Changes* states: *"The noble one is centered in the yellow, the principle permeates, the position is correct, the body is upright, and beauty resides within, flowing to the four limbs and manifesting in affairs—this is the height of beauty."* It speaks of the golden tiger in the crucible, initially receiving the external yin and yang essences, gradually moistening the skin. Once it receives the first qi, the sprout begins to grow. The trunk is made upright, and in the end, the fruit is formed. This is a metaphor for the true gold-sand’s first sprouting shoots. *"One"* is water, for the water’s root is true gold, securely sealed within the vessel—ordinary people cannot know it.

Chen Xianfeng of *Baoyi Zi* said: *"Yellow is the color of the central palace; cinnabar is the treasure of the central palace."* The *Book of Changes*, in the *Wenyan* commentary on the sixth line of the *Kun* hexagram, says: *"The noble one is centered in the yellow, the principle permeates, the position is correct, the body is upright, and beauty resides within, flowing to the four limbs and manifesting in affairs—this is the height of beauty."* How much more so when the body contains the great elixir and harbors the supreme treasure—then the spirit and energy are extraordinary, and the skin’s moisture is self-evident.

Generally, to become an immortal, one must first become a noble person. If one’s virtue and conduct fall short of the noble person’s standard, the human Dao is still incomplete—how much more so the Dao of immortality? Thus, Master Xu drew upon the *Book of Changes*’ words on *"dwelling in the center and treading the upright"* to elucidate the principle of *"having the center and manifesting it externally."* Those of superior capacity who hear this will accumulate deeds and amass merit to ascend as immortals; those of middling capacity who hear it will at least not fail to become good persons and noble ones.

The sutra states: "When the One is realized, the myriad affairs are complete." Yet how easily can this wondrous principle of the One be known? If one truly knows this One, then one may attain this One—such is the true One, the One of oneness, not the numerical One. The true One of oneness is born of the Dao, whereas the numerical One is the "Heavenly One generates Water." Knowing that the One arises from the Dao, the Way of the celestial elixir leaves no residue unencompassed. Thus it is said: "The One serves to conceal." Yet the world’s people cannot comprehend it.

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhixu, said: "Only thus can one attain the *yellow center penetrating principle* and the moist, lustrous skin." At the outset, this is the work of refining the self; in the end, it is the matter of approaching the furnace. The *qian* hexagram stands complete in the path of refining the self, while the later stages hold the merit of entering the chamber. The One is the self, the *wu* (戊). Guard this single word—it is the point where one penetrates to the heart-ground of Boyang.

Confucius said: "My Way is threaded through with a single principle." Laozi spoke of "attaining the One, and the myriad affairs are complete." The Buddha declared: "The myriad dharmas return to the One." Thus, "Heavenly One generates Water"—one must know that this Water is born from within the One. The One within is the central line of the *kan* trigram. When the One is concealed, essence gathers and spirit coalesces; when the One is obscured, numinous power disperses and qi scatters.

If one can know the One, the cosmos lies within one’s grasp. If one attains the One, the myriad transformations arise within the body.

The marvel of the One cannot be illuminated without a teacher—thus it is said that the One is concealed and hidden, unknown to the world. If one truly encounters the transmission of an authentic teacher and can practice this Way, attaining sagehood and realizing the truth may be hoped for in days. Its efficacy is most wondrous and swift, hence it is called the Divine Elixir.

Quanyangzi Yu Yan said: When the Elixir Field contains substance and the one qi flows unimpeded, harmony accumulates within and radiance naturally manifests without. This is what is meant by "when the exterior is upright, the shadow is straight; when the source is deep, the flow is long." Attain the One, and the myriad affairs are complete—this is the teaching of the beginning, middle, and end, the trunk and branches.

The *Zhixuan Pian* states: If one can ensure that with every breath all is mutually attended to, transforming the entire bodily frame, the Jade Fluid flows. If exhalation lacks the governance of the spirit-master, even a single breath is incomplete; if inhalation lacks the governance of the spirit-master, each breath remains interdependent. When spirit and qi guard one another, thought after thought continues unbroken, forging them into a single whole—only then are form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth.

The *Lingyuan Dadao Ge* says: Spirit is nature, qi is life. When spirit does not stray outward, qi naturally settles. Ordinary people exhale qi within, yet their spirit is constantly entangled and enslaved without. From youth to old age, not a single breath rests within the body, causing spirit and qi to move separately without mutual guardianship. Ultimately, the dwelling becomes empty, the walls crumble, and the master cannot sustain himself—how could this be the doing of heaven and earth or the harm of ghosts and spirits? It is the loss of the Way that leads to self-departure.

Those with aspiration for the Elixir Way must not fail to establish the trunk from the outset. In sum, the ancestor of the Great Dao does not transcend the one qi to accomplish transformation. When divided, it becomes black and white; when separated, it becomes blue and yellow. Metaphorically, it is called the sun and moon, dragon and tiger—all these manifold distinctions are merely the two of yin and yang, lead and mercury, which in truth are one thing. Likewise, spirit water, Flowery Pond, lead furnace, and earthen cauldron are all one place. The two characters, when split, become zi and wu, mao and you, new moon and full moon, the twenty-four qi, the seventy-two seasonal nodes—one year’s conjunctions, one month’s revolutions—are all one time. Yet this one time is one place, and one place is one thing, all issuing forth from within this One—what is called the True One. How many in the world truly know this One?

Those who do not know it resort to methods such as internal visualization of the viscera, contemplation of the five organs’ radiance, pacing the Dipper and walking the celestial stems, aligning with days and hours to perform the Ninefold Obscuration, exhaling the upright and inhaling the turbid, consuming primordial qi through the primordial womb, fasting from sleep day and night, ceaselessly laboring through new and full moons. Their bodies grow daily weary, their spirits confused and disoriented, appearing as if deranged. Their hundred vessels seethe like a boiling cauldron, never attaining clarity. They dwell in earthen huts, erect altars, and morning and evening pay homage to ghosts and spirits, seeking apparitions in dreams. With hearts moved and minds elated, they believe they will surely prolong life—only to die prematurely, their corpses exposed, their forms decayed. With every gesture, they violate and rebel, losing the pivotal mechanism. Such arts are myriad, numbering in the thousands, yet all deviate from the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, twisting and contorting to the Nine Capitals. The wise examine these methods and suddenly understand their origins.

True One Master Peng Xiao said: The methods of internal visualization of the viscera and the contortions to the Nine Capitals—Master Xu referred to them as the crooked paths of secondary gates, pursued by those who do not grasp the fundamental origin of the Great Dao. There are those who practice minor arts of inward contemplation, pacing the Dipper and stepping the celestial stems, aligning with the six jia and days and hours—these are but the first steps for the uninitiated. Others engage in bedroom arts of aligning with scenes and joining qi, bending and stretching, grasping and sealing, holding the breath and swallowing saliva. Through these, qi becomes disordered, spirit exhausted, hun damaged, po depleted, leading to the yang spirit fleeing the palace, yin thieves plundering the lungs and liver. Truly, this is due to internal and external mutual encroachment, the clash of yin and yang at the hours of yin and shen. The seven po wander among the dead, the three corpses wage war in the eyes, the hundred vessels boil, the three fields collapse. What was hoped to be longevity instead harms life—how can one attain clarity?

Others externally erect altars and shrines, sacrificing to licentious ghosts, hoping to encounter the Dao and beg for extended years. Instead, ghostly qi transmits to their essence and po, and perverse winds arise in their heart-chambers. Some commune in dreams, others see forms and hear voices, believing longevity is within reach—unaware that their life is in their own hands, they hasten their demise, discarding their decaying forms. These many kinds all belong to heterodox paths: the more one seeks to advance, the more one stagnates; the more one seeks speed, the slower one becomes. They rebel against the utmost truth, deviate from principle, violate heavenly reason, and falsely claim to be high Daoists. They obscure and conceal the true teachings, entirely losing the true transmission of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Thus, Master Xu did not wish for people to practice secondary gates, but to directly enter the correct path. Even if the methods of internal visualization yield minor accomplishments, they ultimately cannot escape death and decay. Only the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir, after ingestion, reverses aging and restores youth, allowing one to attain the rank of True Person and share the longevity of heaven and earth.

Hence, the following text says: When golden sand enters the five viscera, mist and fog arise like wind and rain, steaming and reaching the four limbs. The complexion becomes radiant, the hair turns from white to black, new teeth grow, the old man regains youth, the aged woman becomes a maiden. The form is transformed, worldly calamities are avoided—this is called the True Person. The *Huangting Jing* also states: Even at one hundred and twenty years, one may still return. Beyond this, cultivating the Dao becomes exceedingly difficult. Though one may await the nine transformations and the eight jade elixirs, the essence of the sun and moon, to rescue the aged and infirm, it is known that this method is the supreme path of ascending to heaven in broad daylight and attaining longevity. This is now clear.

Master Xu admonishes those who delight in the Dao to reflect deeply on these words, and they will naturally become enlightened.

Baoyizi Chen Xianfang said: The arts and techniques in the world are innumerable. Even the methods of internal visualization of the viscera require the learner to discern the false from the true, to examine right from wrong. Practices such as closing the eyes to inwardly visualize and contemplate the radiance of the five viscera, pacing the Dipper to align with the upright qi of the celestial stems, aligning with days and hours to perform the Ninefold Obscuration and practice yin arts, exhaling the upright qi and inhaling the turbid, consuming primordial qi through the primordial womb, fasting from sleep day and night without rest—these cause the body to grow weary, the spirit confused and disoriented. Some erect altars to sacrifice to ghosts, others seek spirits in dreams. Though such arts are many, none are the correct method. What was hoped to prolong life instead hastens death, causing the form to decay and stink, vainly harming the mandate of heaven—truly lamentable. How could they know that the Golden Fluid Returning Elixir transforms the fleshly body of one’s parents, allowing one to ascend and soar?

The aforementioned methods all violate the Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi. Observing their conduct, they instead incur calamity in the Nine Capitals’ precincts. Those who understand this Dao reflect on Master Xu’s words and know the proper path of cultivation.

Shangyangzi Chen Zhixu said: As a cultivator, one must understand the correctness of the Great Dao. Without the union of yin and yang, the transformations of kan and li, all else are secondary gates and heterodox paths. Practices such as inwardly visualizing the five viscera, imagining and exhaling, outwardly pacing the Dipper and stepping the celestial stems, grasping mudras, or engaging in bedroom arts to control the Three Peaks with women, or practicing the Ninefold Obscuration, sword methods, the Five Affairs, aligning with scenes to join qi, and disturbing the primordial womb—these are all defiled practices, the lowest of secondary gates. Others exhale the upright and inhale the perverse, endure hunger and consume qi, or discuss years of sitting in meditation without sleep day or night, or erect altars to sacrifice to ghosts and spirits, seeking apparitions. These are the chaotic paths of secondary gates, causing the spirit to become disoriented, the hundred vessels to seethe, the heart to rejoice daily, and dreams to manifest nightly. Though there are a thousand paths and a hundred byways, all are without merit. They violate the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, do not study with true teachers, and fail to grasp the harmony of yin and yang. Their twists and turns invite calamity from the Nine Capitals—how can they congeal the pearl of unity? What was hoped to extend life instead shortens it. If there are those of discernment who encounter the words of a true teacher and reflect on the *Cantong Qi*, they will suddenly know the correct path and not be deluded by secondary gates and heterodox paths.

Master Quanyang Yu Yan said: The three thousand six hundred methods of life-nurturing and the dozens of schools swarm in confusion, too numerous to count. Some, like those who shut their eyes to visualize inwardly through the five viscera or tread the Dipper’s steps in empty space to invoke the celestial stems in sacrifice—how can these be the Dao of the Elixir? As for those who practice the Yin arts, taking "nine shallow, one deep" as their fire-timing, they only stir chaos in the primordial womb. Those who ingest qi, using "exhaling the old and inhaling the new" as their medicinal substance, merely cause the bowels and stomach to growl with emptiness. Those who sit in stubborn vacuity endure sleepless days and nights, while those who exert themselves in labor disregard bodily fatigue. Some shake their heads and sway their brains, clench their fists and strain their strength, until the hundred vessels seethe and erupt into abscesses and ulcers. Others pile earth to erect altars, worshipping at dawn and sacrificing at dusk, only to dream of ghostly couplings at night and fall prey to demonic seductions. At first, their hearts rejoice, believing they can surely prolong life, yet suddenly, midway, they meet an early death, their forms decaying all the same. All these practices are perverse in their grasp, flagrantly violating the writings of the Yellow Emperor, their every action errant and wholly losing the safeguards of Lord Lao. Clinging to delusion, they reach this end—how they incur calamity! And who is to blame?

Thus, Master Wei composed this *Cantong Qi*, resplendent as a torch on a darkened thoroughfare, luminous as a needle in a bewildering sea. He desired that later men of discernment, through its words and safeguards, might suddenly achieve penetrating clarity, knowing the path by which to refine and cultivate.

Amidst fire, lead white turns corrupt and reverts to lead; ice and snow, when warmed by hot water, dissolve into the Great Mystery’s gold. With cinnabar as the essence, it harmonizes with mercury, transforming through its authenticity. From beginning to end, all follows in sequence. Those who seek to refine and consume the elixir of immortality must employ like-kind elements: just as planting grain requires grain, and hatching chicks demands eggs, so too must one rely on the natural order to complete the work. Smelting fish eyes cannot yield pearls; thistles cannot become sandalwood. Only like-kind elements coalesce, while disparate things fail to form treasures. Swallows do not hatch phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse colts. Water does not flow upward in flames; fire does not moisten downward.

In this world, many scholars—profound and gifted—chance upon no true encounter. They exhaust their resources, clinging to texts and fabricating interpretations without foundation. Their measurements falter, their methods stray. They grind and refine chalcanthite, mica, alum, magnetite, sulfur, and mercury, burning cedar wood to concoct the Five Minerals, using copper as a catalyst. Yet their natures clash, refusing to unite. A thousand attempts yield ten thousand failures. Hoping for reversal, they achieve only folly; fortune eludes them to the end.

The Perfected alone comprehend this. From youth to white-haired age, they waver midway, doubting the Way, clinging to delusion. They stray from the correct path, entering crooked byways, peering through a tube to glimpse the sky—how can such narrow vision fathom what lies ahead?

**True Unity Master Peng Xiao says:**
Lead white is refined from black lead; cast into fire, it reverts to lead. Ice and snow, formed from water’s qi, dissolve into water when warmed. Gold, cinnabar, and mercury are of one body: gold as the mother gives birth to cinnabar and mercury. Thus, planting grain requires grain, and hatching chicks demands eggs—all things of like-kind generate one another, beginning and ending in mutual dependence, following the Dao of nature. To use metals, minerals, herbs, frost, dew, ice, snow, salt, or brine is misguided; later passages clarify this.

The root of Heaven and Earth becomes the root of the medicine; true gold mother becomes the mother of the medicine, producing yin and yang to form the essence—gold cinnabar and numinous mercury—into the elixir of longevity. Is this not so? Hence, swallows do not hatch phoenixes; foxes and hares do not nurse colts. Fire’s nature is to flame upward; it cannot moisten downward. Water’s nature is to moisten downward; it cannot flame upward. Extending this principle of natural root-kind, it becomes clear that the gold mother produces gold cinnabar.

Master Wei observed that many learned scholars, versed in the Dao and fond of alchemical pursuit, fail to meet enlightened teachers. They rely solely on texts and formulas, fabricating interpretations, squandering wealth, and grinding miscellaneous medicines in vain hope of longevity and transcendence. Years pass; their hair turns white, yet they persist in error, clinging to narrow views, straying into crooked paths. A thousand attempts yield ten thousand failures—how can they gauge what lies ahead? The incompatibility of disparate natures has already been explained in prior annotations.

**Embracing Unity Master Chen Xianwei says:**
Things of like-kind resonate without premeditation, inevitably so. Lead white, refined from lead, reverts to lead when cast into fire. Ice and snow, formed from water, return to water when warmed. The birth of supreme treasures arises from the true essence of the Great Yang, coalescing into numinous radiance. When cinnabar first forms, it already contains true mercury. Mercury separated from its mother is called "quicksilver." Quicksilver, refined in the great crucible by the Great Yang over years, congeals into silver; over time, silver transforms into gold. Thus, gold takes cinnabar as its essence—cinnabar is the spirit, mercury the essence.

In the initial stages of elixir refinement, one first gathers yang essence to transform it into cinnabar, then takes mercury to blend with the cinnabar, grinding and harmonizing the two. Through smelting, they become gold. Only after gold is formed does one use lead to nurture it. The true essence arises from the Great Yang, born through its union with the Great Yin. Only true lead is fit for consumption; true lead is born of the Great Yin. Thus, like-kind elements must be used: gold finds true lead as a child finds its mother. With this mutual assistance, smelting is easily accomplished—like planting grain with grain or a hen hatching eggs, all resonate with like-kind, mutually dependent qi.

Without this knowledge, seeking disparate elements is futile, wasting effort and resources—like swallows failing to hatch phoenixes or foxes and hares failing to nurse colts. Water cannot steam things; fire cannot moisten them. Yet when cinnabar and mercury unite, spirit and essence are born; when water and fire merge, steam and moisture arise. Fire beneath water can fulfill its upward-flaming nature; water above fire can achieve its downward-moistening virtue. Who but the most refined in the world can attain this? The principle of the Golden Elixir surpasses creation, transcending the bounds of thought. Without encountering a Perfected One, all efforts are in vain. Using external substances is even more delusional. Clinging to error and forsaking the correct path is no virtue of the worthy.

Many who study the Dao refuse to steadfastly seek teachers or friends, to endure hardship and diligently inquire. Some begin but do not persist; others waver midway, wasting years until their hair turns white and old age arrives without achievement. All this stems from peering through a tube at the sky—self-satisfied, self-conceited.

Yet the sun and moon shine brightly; Heaven and Earth endure. Cold and heat alternate; day and night succeed one another—all embody the principle of the Great Dao’s unfolding. Without encountering a Perfected One, it is difficult to fathom. Scholars should first accumulate merit and virtue to invoke resonance. Let none deceive themselves, reaching this treasure mountain only to return empty-handed.

**Upper Yang Master Chen Zhixu says:**
Lead white is refined black lead; when exposed to fire, it reverts to its original nature. Ice and snow are congealed cold water; when warmed, they return to their source. Gold enters mercury and turns white; with fire, it regains its red hue. People, led astray by desires, disrupt their nature. Preserving one’s nature enables longevity. What does it mean for gold to take cinnabar as its essence? What does it mean to harmonize with mercury?

Those who cultivate the Dao must understand creation, penetrate yin and yang. To refine the Golden Elixir, first accumulate mercury from the inner fire and blend it with the water mercury of the Jade Pool. Then use the water of Kan to aid the fire of Li. When water and fire are balanced, gold and cinnabar unite in form, transforming through the authenticity of like-kind. From beginning to end, yin and yang serve as the foundation. Thus, those who seek to refine and consume the elixir of immortality must employ like-kind elements—this is certain. Just as planting grain requires grain and hatching chicks demands eggs, so too must one proceed to become an immortal or Buddha. Without like-kind elements, even if one enters the marketplace a hundred times or sits in meditation for a thousand years, it will all end in emptiness.

Those who do not follow the Way of Like-Kind but pursue heterodox paths—whether through bedchamber arts, controlling women, or the "Three Peaks" battle of essence—all tread deviant paths, mistaking fish eyes for pearls and mugwort for sandalwood. How could they know that transformation arises from authenticity?

Swallows and sparrows are flying birds, yet cannot give birth to phoenixes; foxes and hares are running beasts, yet how could they nurse horses? These are not of the same kind. Water’s nature is to moisten downward, yet cannot blaze upward; fire’s function is to flame upward, yet cannot moisten downward. For yin and yang to interact, they must accord with the natural Dao.

Master Xu taught that to seek an enlightened teacher, one must first grasp the *Cantong Qi* and harmonize yin and yang before speaking of the Elixir. When the Purple Jade Elder first received instruction from the True Man of Great Void, the first question upon entering the chamber was: *"Is the* Cantong Qi *for understanding the* Changes *or for practicing it?"* The Great Void replied: *"The* Changes *concerns only the two matters of yin and yang. One who can understand and practice them is a sage."* Thus, the *Changes* states: *"In the southwest, one gains companions and proceeds with like-kind."* This is what "like-kind" means—following the same path. If matters diverge, no treasure is formed. First understanding, then practicing—this is the sage’s way.

Yet some later practitioners, though endowed with fine talents, do not seek true teachers. Instead, they rely on ancient texts, arbitrarily measuring and speculating: some use Shaoyang’s chalcanthite to refine gold, others employ Chensha’s cinnabar to burn silver; they pound and refine the Five Metals, smelt the Eight Stones, take the Three Yellows as like-kind, and use purified red copper as an auxiliary pivot. But these stones and metals are not of our like-kind—how could they willingly merge with our qi and dwell within our bodies?

Long ago, Zhang Xiang of Jiujiang refined and consumed elixirs. Lü Dongbin, pitying his earnest devotion to the Dao, transformed into a master to visit and save him. Zhang, arrogant from long elixir consumption, believed himself certain of ascension and treated the master with disdain. Dongbin abruptly departed, leaving only a poem on his seat:

*"Alas for Zhang, Minister of Jiujiang,
Who lost his sight from elixirs, his spirit withered.
He did not ponder the formless Returning Elixir,
But foolishly consumed metals and stones—how blind!"*

Later, Zhang indeed went blind and died. Such people, though gifted, cling stubbornly to error, willingly misled by blind teachers who point to metals and stones as like-kind. They waste their wealth on refining and consumption, yet to their deaths remain deluded. Like those who peer at the sky through a tube, how could they know that true immortals and sagely teachers exist in the world?

People are habituated to the commonplace and unwilling to transcend it, to broadly seek and learn. With narrow vision and low aims, how could they hear or see lofty and distant matters? Yet they strut about, calling themselves "great men"—all while squandering their fine talents, lost in self-reliance and complacency.

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: *"Hu powder is made from black lead; if cast into fire, it reverts to lead. Ice and snow are formed from yin qi; if drenched with warm water, they melt into water. Why? Because returning to the source is a principle that cannot be otherwise."*

The method of refining gold takes cinnabar as its foundation and blends it with mercury, for mercury is born from cinnabar and shares its like-kind nature. Thus, from beginning to end, they interact to produce transformation through authenticity.

The *Wuzhen Pian* states:
*"To mend broken bamboo, use bamboo;
To hatch a chick, use an egg.
All else is not of like-kind—vain labor,
Like true lead meeting the sage’s mechanism."*

For true mercury to meet true lead is for one yin and one yang to resonate in qi—this is like-kind. It is like planting grain requiring millet, or hatching a chick requiring an egg. Following like-kind, the Way unfolds naturally, effortlessly achieving transformation. But if one abandons like-kind to seek other things, it is like mistaking fish eyes for pearls or mugwort for sandalwood—no transformation can occur. Just as swallows and sparrows can only produce swallows and sparrows, not phoenixes; foxes and hares can only nurse foxes and hares, not horses.

Fire’s nature is to blaze upward—can it be made to moisten downward? Water’s nature is to moisten downward—can it be made to blaze upward? Thus, to refine and consume the elixir of immortality, one must employ like-kind. Like-kind follows the same path; divergence fails to form treasure. This is certain.

Few among the world’s gifted scholars and earnest learners fail to seek, yet rare are those who encounter a true master and receive the correct transmission. Some possess the medicines of the Three Yellows and Four Spirits, mistakenly believing the Dao lies therein. Yet they do not know that the five metals and eight minerals are substances of form and matter, their kinds disparate and natures distinct. The Golden Elixir arises from nothing to become something—how could the supreme medicine consent to merge and dwell together with them? Thus, all who practice this art meet with a thousand failures for every ten thousand attempts, desiring success yet growing deluded. Why? Because their beginnings lack cause and condition, their measures lose hold of proper discipline.

Hence it is said: the world does not recognize true lead and mercury, taking common cinnabar and quicksilver to be them. Time and again, they waste fire and squander wealth, yet achieve no success, until their hair turns white in bewilderment, and they sigh in vain at emptiness. Alas! The true Dao is simple and unburdensome; its profound words are bland and flavorless. Who would believe and practice them? Even those who receive the correct transmission may, midway, generate doubt, turning from the right path to deviance—such cases abound.

The *Tongxuan Secret Formula* states: “Many rely on cleverness, forcibly asserting right and wrong. Though they hear the essential teachings, they contradict themselves. Thus, they turn from the great Dao and cling to deluded paths, peering at heaven through a tube without broad vision—how can they discuss the boundless mysteries of the future?”

The *Fire Record* is not idly composed; it elucidates through the *Yi*’s principles. The recumbent-moon method employs the crucible: the White Tiger as the pivot of refinement, mercury as the flowing pearl, the Green Dragon dwelling with it. Raising the east to meet the west, hun and po naturally constrain each other. Above, the trigram *dui* holds the number eight; below, *gen* also holds eight. The two eights unite their essence, and the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete—two eights correspond to one catty. The Dao of the *Yi* stands upright, never tilting.

Zhenyi Zi, Peng Xiao, said: “Though there are records of fire, one must abide by the Dao of the *Yi* in practice, following the hexagrams’ lines and circulating through *pi* and *tai*. The crucible of the recumbent moon is the upturned moon. The Metal Tiger within serves as the pivot of the medicine; the Vermilion Mercury and Green Dragon are governed by *bing* and *ding*. The Vermilion Bird pursues and chases in time, all entering the golden womb—hence it is called ‘raising the east to meet the west.’ *Hun* and *po* are the Green Dragon’s *hun* in the east and the White Tiger’s *po* in the west. The upper and lower eights combine to form the number of one catty, completing the forms of *qian* and *kun*, matching the number of one celestial cycle.”

Baoyi Zi, Chen Xianwei, said: “Ancient elixir texts describe the functions of fire timing, calling them *Fire Records*—altogether six hundred chapters. Their precautions do not exceed the *Zhou Yi*. Was the *Fire Record* composed idly, without basis? It should be elucidated through the *Yi*’s principles. The *Yi* has three hundred eighty-four lines, corresponding to the fire timing of the celestial cycle. The upper and lower eights, two eights making one catty, and one catty equaling three hundred eighty-four *zhu*—these precisely match the hexagrams’ lines. The *qian* lines number one hundred ninety-two, and the *kun* lines one hundred ninety-two, thus the Dao of *qian* and *kun* is complete.

The recumbent-moon crucible refers to the body and function of the Mysterious Pass’s single aperture. That aperture is half white, half black, like a half-moon—hence it is called the recumbent-moon crucible. Knowing the recumbent moon as the crucible and furnace, one has grasped more than half of the Great Elixir’s Dao.

The White Tiger below serves as the pivot for kindling fire; the Green Dragon above stirs the winds and waves of rising clouds. Within, true mercury transforms into flowing pearls. Thus, the eastern dragon and western tiger unite, yin *po* and yang *hun* restrain each other, divine workings circulate in the golden crucible, and sacred medicine is forged in the jade furnace. The mechanism of creation is inverted, the functions of *qian* and *kun* are overturned—who but the most profoundly penetrating in the world could achieve this?”

Shangyang Zi, Chen Zhixu, said: “These words speak of the crucible and furnace, the Green Dragon and White Tiger, the *qi* of the eights, the recumbent-moon crucible, the White Tiger, the upper eight, *dui*, and *po*—all pertain to the west. That is the jade pool.”

“Mercury is called ‘flowing pearl,’ the Green Dragon, the lower *kan*, *gen*, and *hun*—all pertain to the east. That is the self, the golden crucible.

The recumbent-moon crucible is none other than the Great Unity’s divine furnace, called the yin crucible. Its recumbent and upturned form resembles the moon at its first crescent. The White Tiger is the being of the western *dui* palace. When heaven and earth first divided, its primordial essence belonged to that quarter. The tiger’s might responds when struck, its refined radiance nurturing the myriad beings. Though it can wound or kill, it harbors the vastness of the Great Vehicle. King Wen, in his profound *Yi*, said: ‘Treading on the tiger’s tail, it does not bite the man—sublime.’ And again: ‘Treading the Way, level and vast, the secluded one’s steadfastness brings good fortune.’ Confucius said: ‘Joyful yet responsive to *qian*,’ and ‘Treading the white path, one walks alone in fulfillment of one’s wish.’

The adept who refines the elixir, knowing to fear this tiger, must first subdue and tame it. Once tamed, it becomes the pivot for refinement and will not bite. *Li* is the sun, mercury; within it lies cinnabar, called ‘flowing pearl.’ The Green Dragon is the being of the eastern *zhen* palace. When the kalpa’s cycle is complete, its primordial essence belongs to the self. The dragon’s might transforms and responds, moving clouds and sending rain, shaping the myriad forms. *Qian*’s nine-two says: ‘The dragon appears in the field—auspicious to see the great person.’ The Master said: ‘Dragon virtue, centered and correct.’

People fail to grasp the dragon’s life-generating power and are often harmed by it. If one awakens, fears it, regulates and subdues it, one can then drive and employ it. Raising the east to meet the west is the harmonious union of propriety. *Dui* and *gen* each number eight, flowing *wu* to join *ji*. *Hun* and *po* restrain each other, metal and water do not separate. The two *kan* unite their essence, *qian* and *kun* form the body, and the Dao of the *Yi* does not topple—this must be the balance of two eights to make one *jin*.

The Perfect Yang Master, Yu Yan, said: ‘The ancient *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters merely expand upon the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Yi* to elucidate the full ten-month fire times. The recumbent-moon crucible is the lead furnace, its position in *kan*, where the White Tiger resides. The flowing-pearl palace is the mercury crucible, its position in *li*, where the Green Dragon resides. The White Tiger as the pivot for refinement means the White Tiger guards the cinnabar field, and fire issues from below the navel. The Green Dragon joins it by being driven down to meet the White Tiger. East and west are *kan* and *li*; *hun* and *po* are the sun and moon. The origins of dragon and tiger and the sources of lead and mercury are not two paths. If the adept knows the subtlety of driving the dragon to meet the tiger, then one understands the method of casting mercury into lead.

The elixir method is utterly simple and easy. If one can empty the heart, still the self, concentrate the spirit, and enter the qi cavity, then east and west naturally pair, dragon and tiger mate, and *hun* and *po* unite to produce the purple gold—what need is there for exertion?

When the upper *kan* is in effect, the *dui* hexagram governs, and the moon’s light is half-born—thus its number is eight. When the lower *kan* is in effect, the *gen* hexagram governs, and the moon’s essence is half-formed—thus its number is also eight. Observing the union of the two *kan*, the *qian* and *kun* crucible is established, and medicine, ingredients, and fire times are all contained within. Two eights make sixteen *liang*, one *jin*—the sixty-four hexagrams of the *Yi* correspond exactly to this number, which also symbolizes the subtlety of the elixir Way: yin and yang in perfect balance and union.

When metal enters fierce fire, its color does not fade, and its radiance shines forth. Since the beginning of creation, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness, and true gold has never lost its weight. The sun and moon retain their forms as ever, for gold is born from the moon. At the new moon, the sun bestows its tally, and gold returns to its mother. At the dark moon, they embrace, concealing their outlines, sinking into the cavernous void. Gold regains its original nature, and the crucible’s radiance glows.

The True Unity Master, Peng Xiao, said: ‘The five phases overcome one another—fire overcomes metal, yet when metal meets fire, it becomes a vessel, neither harmed. Thus, the metal embryo in the crucible does not dissipate; its color grows ever more luminous. Since the establishment of the *qian* and *kun* crucible, the sun and moon have infused their essence within, mutually benefiting and growing ever brighter. The gold’s weight remains as before, and the sun and moon perpetually encircle and illuminate. Gold is born from the moon because gold is yin essence, lodged in the west—thus it is said that gold comes from the moon. The moon, from the new moon, receives the sun’s tally and thereby generates gold. When gold returns to its mother, the moon takes charge, and gold reverts to water. At the dark moon, yang qi is exhausted, and the two—gold and water—naturally embrace, concealing their outlines and sinking into the cavernous void. The dark moon symbolizes the year’s end; the new moon, the year’s beginning. When gold and water form within the crucible chamber, they perpetually contain harmonious qi, and success is seen—thus the crucible glows. Glowing means harmony; harmony means gold and water congeal—nature’s Way is complete.’

The Embracing Unity Master, Chen Xianwei, said: ‘The sun, moon, and gold endure the longest. Since heaven and earth opened, the sun and moon have retained their forms without ever waning in brightness, and true gold has kept its weight without ever losing its color—these three are one body. People see only that when gold’s essence flourishes, the moon’s brightness doubles, knowing that gold is born from the moon but not that the moon’s brightness is born from the sun. Thus, at their union, the moon conceals its light, sinking into the cavernous void to receive the sun’s radiance and thereby generate gold. Gold’s nature originally comes from the sun—its hardness, weight, and solidity bear the sun’s color and possess the sun’s nature. All things meet fire and melt, yet when gold enters fire, its color does not fade. Refined a hundred times, it grows harder; tempered in great smelters, it glows redder. Fire is the qi of the Great Yang; gold is the essence of the Great Yin. When gold enters fierce fire, it regains its original nature—thus, when the crucible’s fire blazes, the gold’s color grows ever more vivid, and its radiance glows with loveliness.’

Shangyang Zi, Chen Zhixu, said: ‘This speaks of gold’s function—without gold’s power, the elixir cannot form. Thus, the gold elixir is not the gold or jade of the world, nor that which comes from earth and stone. It is the subtlety of heaven and earth’s creation, the five phases inverted, born from the womb of *qian* and *kun*’s great transformation—this is the true gold.

Today’s blind masters, when they speak of the gold elixir, become flustered, not knowing what it is. They prattle of cultivation yet never hear the name of the gold elixir, nor do they fathom the words of the *Cantong Qi*. They deceive the world. Little do they know that the immortals have clearly pointed out this gold’s divine transformations. There are fools who, upon seeing these texts but failing to discern the true gold’s yin-yang body and function, guess it refers to smelting and furnace fires—what a pity!’”

Alas! If we do not reveal some hint of this to the world, then in ten thousand generations hence, this text will grow ever more lofty and distant. People, unable to glimpse its shores, will abandon it and never read it—how then shall they seek the path of cultivation? Those of superior roots and keen faculties must know: this gold existed before the primal chaos of *hongmeng*, before the division of the Great Ultimate. Originally belonging to *qian*, it is thus called *qian*-gold. When the great kalpa is about to turn, those who would repay the virtue of chaos come to this: as *qian* first joins with *kun*, this gold stumbles and gallops, rushing into the palace of *kun*, and is called *kun*-within-gold. *Kun*, receiving this gold, becomes inwardly replete and transforms into *kan*. The three lines of *kun* were originally all hollow, called *kun*-earth; now, with this gold filling its center, it forms the image of *kan*. *Kan*’s proper position is in the north, the land of *gui*-water. As *kan* is water and gold is concealed within it, it is called water-within-gold. This water-within-gold is a treasure of the prior heavens, yet it cannot long abide in the posterior *kan*. Thus, it transforms into *dui*. *Dui* may leap at the gate of the northern *kan* or occupy the western *you* direction—there, this gold grows day by day, night by night. *You*’s proper position belongs to *dui*, and thus this gold governs the practice of the elixir path within *dui*, hence called *dui*-gold.

Those who refine the elixir must seek the subtle and probe the obscure, tracing beginnings to ends, investigating things to extend knowledge, exploring its source and flow, and examining its roots and sprouts. If one refines the gold elixir, one must seek this gold. To seek this gold, one does not seek in *qian*, nor in *kun*, nor in *kan*, but solely in *dui*. *Dui* as a thing shares the same vessel as *kun*-moon—this is called “same vessel.” It is easy to apply effort to *dui*, difficult to craft with *kun*. *Dui*’s wonder lies in its acting on *kun*’s behalf in the Way. Thus, in refining the gold elixir, apart from this *dui*-gold, all else are side doors that cannot lead to the Dao. The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, the ancient sages and immortals, all used this gold to complete the Dao. King Wen’s *Xun* hexagram, the nine in the fifth place: “First *geng*, three days; after *geng*, three days.” Confucius’ commentary on *Xun* and *Dui*: “The yielding follows the firm.” The noble person, in issuing commands and acting, does so in accord with this. *Geng* is metal. The classic says: “Three days, the moon emerges at *geng*—this is it.” Moreover, Śākyamuni borrowed this gold to become a Buddha, hence called the Golden Immortal. For the gold within *dui* shares the same body as the great yin of heaven, born at the same time as brightness. Thus, the moon in heaven is called the great yin. Because this *dui*-gold shares its function, it is also named the lesser yin, or yin-within-gold. The great yin of heaven receives the radiance of the great yang to complete the seasons. The lesser yin of *dui*’s path continues the great thousand worlds, transforming and giving birth to beings. The immortals, having penetrated the wisdom of former sages, know this gold’s root and source, and trace its wondrous transformations—only this gold’s divine changes are singled out.

That worldly gold can endure as long as heaven and earth, entering fire to grow ever more refined, enduring smelting without losing its weight—how much more so this *dui*-gold, born from the great transformative furnace of *qian* and *kun*? The moon’s light waxes and wanes; *dui*’s gold flows and turns. Thus it is said: “In form, it is like the constant new moon. At dawn, sun and moon form a bi-disc; the moon receives the sun’s tally and manifests a single yang’s light at the *geng-shen* position—this is the great yin of heaven. Correspondingly, this *dui*-gold, in accord with the moon’s new moon, begins to generate the yang elixir at the position of chaos on the third day—this is the lesser yin of the human realm.” Hence it is said: “Gold is born from the moon. At dawn, it receives the tally.” What does it mean for gold to return to its mother? The abode of gold is *dui*; the mother of *dui* is *kun*. *Dui* cannot long retain its gold; the gold, too, acts in due season. *Kun*’s wing is said to “contain pattern and be steadfast, acting in its time.” The sage’s heart is wondrous in this: when this gold is put to use, *dui* returns to its mother and enfolds *kun*, just as the moon at its darkest is enfolded by the sun. Why? At the dark of the moon, at dawn, the moon’s gold body hides its frame, covered by the sun. For one, two, three days, it moves through its degrees, and its radiance returns. Likewise, when gold returns to its mother, the gold’s true essence sinks into profound emptiness, put to the world’s use: one generates two, two generates three, and when the kalpa’s turn comes again, the gold will be reborn.

If this gold is reborn, it must restore its original nature. Why? Nature is *qian*’s function; *qian*’s is the straight. Gold is lodged in *kun*, *kun* in *kan*, *kan* in *dui*. When *dui*-gold unfolds its essence, it restores its original nature, returning this gold to the palace of *qian*. *Qian*’s gold crucible regains its seed, and the refined gold elixir is thus called the “gold fluid returning elixir.” The crucible is called the “awe-inspiring radiance gold crucible”—“awe-inspiring radiance” signifies blazing fire, flourishing and abundant.

Quanzhenzi Yu Yan said: “All things in the world are destroyed by fire, only gold is not. Among the five phases, generation reaches its limit at metal. As a thing, when smelted, it yields to water; when struck, it yields to fire. Its softness resembles wood, its color resembles earth. It embodies all four seasons. Thus, true gold, refined a hundred times, grows ever firmer, never losing its original weight. Since heaven and earth opened, for who knows how many thousands of years, the forms of sun and moon remain constant, never diminishing their brightness. For the essences of yin and yang mutually conceal their abodes, each finding its proper place—thus the forms of sun and moon do not change.” In the elixir method, nothing is more luminously manifest than metal and fire. Metal is the moon; fire is the sun. “Gold is born from the sun; at dawn, it receives the tally”—this is the true yin-gold of the great yin, born in the palace of *kun*, originally transformed by the true fire of the great yang. Its initial reception of qi is like gold: though the moon’s light is born from the sun, the moon receives the sun’s light beginning at dawn. “Gold returns to its mother; the moon at its darkest is enfolded by the sun”—this is gold in the palace of *kun*, guarding fire, just as on the moon’s darkest night, sun and moon hold each other. “Hiding its frame, sinking into profound emptiness”—spirit and qi deeply enter their root, gradually sinking to the sea’s bottom, like the moon’s dark body unseen. “Gold restores its original nature; the awe-inspiring radiance crucible blazes”—the moon’s body is originally black; receiving the sun’s light, it becomes white. Now, enfolded by the sun, hiding its frame, it restores its original blackness. Simply guard its blackness, not asking about its whiteness. Over time, spirit and brightness will come of themselves. In an instant, radiance pierces the crucible; fire’s power blazes intensely. Then, on the third day, *geng* is born at *dui*’s gate. From black silver, refined white silver emerges.

Worldly people, fond of petty arts, do not examine the depth of the Dao. They abandon the correct path to follow deviant byways, seeking speed but blocking progress—like the blind who cannot use a staff, or the deaf who listen to the *shang* note. They drown in water to catch pheasants and hares, climb mountains to seek fish and dragons, plant wheat hoping for millet, or use a compass to draw a square. They exhaust their strength and spirit year after year, yet see no result. If one wishes to know the method of ingesting the elixir, the matter is simple and not complex.

True Unity Master Peng Xiao said: Master Xu observed that worldly people favor petty arts and hasten along swift paths, not knowing that petty arts and swift paths have a beginning but no end. Those who expend great effort achieve little success—like the blind and deaf who, in matters of seeing and hearing, or hunters and fishers who err amid rivers and mountains. Since their choices are misguided and their judgments confused, how can they diligently seek the supreme Way, which is simple and not complex? Moreover, the Golden Liquor Returned Elixir is the supreme Way of ascending to heaven in broad daylight. If one encounters an enlightened teacher or receives divine instruction, follows the wondrous formula, and cultivates accordingly, then the principle of ease and simplicity is attained.

Embracing Unity Master Chen Xianwei said: Worldly people abandon the correct path to follow the deviant, indulging in petty arts and exhausting their minds and strength, yet achieve nothing. How could they know the wonder of the great Dao, which is utterly simple and easy, concise and not complex?

High Yang Master Chen Zhixu said: Worldly people favor petty arts, yet petty arts are not the vessel of the Dao—they are narrow and shallow, unworthy of the great Way. The Dao is vast, encompassing heaven and earth; it is deep and boundless as the sea. People, however, cannot comprehend it. First poisoned by blind teachers, their initial words become their master. The correct Way has no chance to be heard, while side doors and arts of *cai-zhan* are preferred. They abandon the correct path to follow deviant byways, ingesting medicines to seek lightness and ascent, desiring speed but blocking progress. Their essence is exhausted, their nature unnurtured—like the blind who cannot use a staff, or borrowing the Way to engage in empty talk, like the deaf who listen to the *shang* note. Why not study the *Cantong Qi* and the five phases without inversion? Why climb mountains to seek fish and dragons, or sit in dry meditation to pursue immortality? Why plant wheat hoping for millet, or strive for effortless attainment while using a compass to draw a square? Such actions exhaust strength and spirit. Without encountering a sagely teacher, they see no result year after year. Those who wish to know the method of ingesting the elixir—ancient immortals’ words are not complex: "Subdue the *qi* without ingesting *qi*; ingest *qi* only after subduing it. Ingesting *qi* does not grant longevity; longevity requires subduing *qi*." These words are the true and wondrous formula, guiding those of the highest rank.

Whole Yang Master Yu Yan said: The great Way of the Golden Elixir is accomplished through the accumulation of essence and the amassing of *qi*, forming the embryo in a moment and establishing the foundation in a hundred days. After one year, one enters the chamber; after three years, refinement and nurturance follow their proper sequence. Alas, scholars do not examine the depth of the Dao or discern whether their teachers are deviant or correct. They seek quick results, favoring petty arts—some know one aspect but neglect another, some grasp the body but lose its function, confined by partial views and self-satisfied. Worse still, they promote heterodox teachings and slander the correct Way, distorting true scriptures to gain the trust of the unlearned, recklessly teaching the deluded and spreading confusion. Such people are many.

Occasionally, there are those of keen intelligence who refuse to humble themselves to seek instruction, instead poring over old texts in hopes of enlightenment—how is this different from the blind who do not use a staff? As for the ignorant and dull, who do not comprehend the supreme principle but force their conjectures to align with alchemical texts—how is this different from the deaf who listen to *gong* and *shang*?

As for taking the navel as the Mysterious Pass—this is like hunting pheasants and hares by entering water. Taking the two eyes as the Flowery Pond—this is like seeking fish and dragons by climbing mountains. Other practices, such as learning bedroom arts in hopes of immortality or sitting in stubborn emptiness to pursue longevity—are these not like planting wheat yet expecting to harvest millet, or using a compass to seek a square? All these waste effort and energy, leaving one white-haired and bewildered, with no results to show. Alas!

The Golden Elixir is born within *Kan* (Water), forced out by fire to shift position, traversing the Three Palaces before descending into the mouth—hence it is called "ingestion." The essential method is not complex; the oral instructions are most simple. Using gold as the embankment, water enters and flows freely. The gold is reckoned at fifteen, and the water’s measure is the same. When tending the furnace, fix the weights: if five parts of water are in excess, two parts are taken as true. The gold remains as heavy as its original state, while the third part does not enter the fire but accompanies the two. Once the Three Substances are united in proper measure, their transformations are as if divine. Below, the *qi* of the Great Yang lies concealed, steaming and warming. In an instant, it first liquefies, then congeals—this is called the Yellow Chariot.

When years and months draw to an end, nature is destroyed, lifespan harmed, and the body reduced to ashes and dust, resembling dust on a bright window. True Unity Master Peng Xiao says: The Gold Mother resides in the Central Palace as quicksilver. The embankment allows gold and water to flow freely, their natures intertwined. Gold and water follow the celestial stems, each receiving half of the *qi*, together making up a full catty. Once the Golden Sand is produced, the mother is not diminished—hence it is said, "the gold remains as heavy as its original state." The third part that does not enter is true earth. Gold, fire, and wood are the Three Substances; water and fire follow the celestial stems, entering the vessel together, where the three natures unite and the two flavors constrain each other, transforming as if divine.

The Gold Mother, initially steamed by the essence-*qi* of the Great Yang, can then liquefy and congeal—this is called the Yellow Chariot. When the cycle of the stars is complete, the work of yin-yang and the Five Phases is fulfilled, and all forms retreat, their merit returned to the Central Palace—the virtue of the Yellow Emperor’s earth. Thus, it is said: nature is destroyed, lifespan harmed, and one returns to earth’s virtue, where spirit and form become like dust on a bright window.

Embracing Unity Master Chen Xianwei says: To refine the Great Elixir, first use pure gold to build the city walls, encircling them completely. Then take true water and let it enter—only then will there be no leakage. Whether called the gold embankment or the city walls, the meaning is the same. Yet in building the gold embankment, if one understands the principle that the Four Images and Five Phases all rely on earth, then gold will naturally form. The embankment employs the true earth of the Five Phases, which can complete the true gold of the Five Phases—for earth is the mother of gold. Once the true gold of the Five Phases is formed, it can contain the true water of the Five Phases—for water is the child of gold. When water, earth, and gold intertwine, they form a square shape, and the Infant appears within.

When the work ascends, golden light fills the chamber, billowing like a chariot in motion—hence it is called the Yellow Chariot. Yet when tending the furnace, the gold’s weight should not exceed five parts. If the water is slightly more, it is no hindrance. The third part that does not enter the fire, accompanying the two, refers to wood (three) and fire (two). Fire (two) and wood (three) do not enter, just as a person’s hun and shen are originally formless, manifesting through things. In the work of self-cultivation, one refines water, earth, and gold. Once these Three Substances are united and the treasure formed, the hun and shen naturally accompany it.

Water entering the gold embankment is originally congealed liquid, steamed and refined by the *qi* of the Great Yang below, transforming into the Yellow Chariot. When the fire’s power is complete and the divine work fulfilled, a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations arise—phoenix carriages and dragon chariots are all of this substance. When the embryo is shed, the body shimmers like sunlight casting dust on a bright window—this is the manifestation of Master Xu’s accomplished transformations. Alas, how can those who do not know, recklessly speculating without ever dreaming of it, dare to fabricate theories? Only those who have personally experienced it can understand.

Upper Yang Master Chen Zhixu says: These words describe entering the chamber, tending the furnace, beginning the work, and sealing the elixir within the crucible. Those of the highest capacity should clearly understand this text, which is most orderly and not at all vague. This section contains the essentials—without this one section’s details, how could later generations begin the work of elixir refinement? Those who practice elixir cultivation but have not met a teacher will find this text profound yet obscure. Upon reaching this section, they will be like chewing wax, with no entry point, and can only guess it refers to smelting the Five Metals and Eight Stones. In the end, they achieve nothing and blame the sagely masters for idle talk—truly pitiable.

Now, to dispel doubts forever: "Using gold as the embankment" refers to the great cultivator who, in refining the Nine-Return Golden Elixir, must understand that this gold is the gold within *Dui* (Lake) of the West. First, prepare the true heart to seek that *Dui* gold, establish an altar, and constantly maintain vigilance. Fortify the embankment to await the birth of this gold’s water. The water thus born must be carefully examined and discerned: is this water of the Prior Heaven or the Posterior Heaven? If it is of the Posterior Heaven, the water is turbid and cannot be used to refine the Returning Elixir. If it is water of the Prior Heaven, one must wait until the water is clear before using it.

A poem says:
*The Jing is muddied by the Wei—*
*For the Jing is clear while the Wei is turbid.*

The elixir cultivator waits for the Jing’s clarity, flowing freely within the embankment, undisturbed—this is what is meant by "water enters and flows freely." Within this clear water lies true gold. Zhou Xingsi says: "Gold is born in the Li River, clear to the utmost." Moreover, one must know its weight and measure before using it. This *Dui* gold must be precisely fifteen taels, approximating one catty—hence it is said, "the gold is reckoned at fifteen." When the gold weighs fifteen taels, it can generate the Li River’s water.

What is meant by "the water’s measure is the same"? It does not mean the water is also fifteen taels, but that the water corresponds to the gold. For fifteen taels of gold, there is a certain amount of water it can generate—hence it is said, "the same." Thus, Master Xu repeatedly emphasizes: when tending the furnace, first fix the weights. If fifteen taels of gold have generated five parts of water, the water is in excess and cannot be used—hence it is said, "five parts of water are in excess." If this gold initially generates two parts of water, this is truly usable—hence it is said, "two parts are taken as true." This two parts of water must correspond to fifteen taels of gold—hence it is said, "the gold remains as heavy as its original state." If the water has reached three parts, it is also unusable—hence it is said, "the third part does not enter." When the measures of gold and water are timely and equal, swiftly combine them with two parts of fire—hence it is said, "fire (two) accompanies them."

Once gold, water, and fire are united, the fire receives the gold’s *qi* and is further restrained by the water, forming the Returning Elixir, which can then transform as if divine.

Here begins the crucial work of approaching the furnace—nothing is more essential than this. Thus, the sage takes the year to select the month, places gold within the moon, measures the day to heed the tide, chooses the hour within the day to correspond with the hexagram, and fixes the fire within the hour to enact the talisman. What is meant by "enacting the talisman"? The ancient sages and former worthies regarded the refinement of the Golden Elixir as a matter of utmost importance. They calculated the seasons and established the method of accumulation, condensing the seventy-two seasonal nodes of a year into a single day, gathering the three hundred sixty hexagrams of a year into a single month, and dividing the thirty-six talismans across a day and night to mark the twelve hours. Within one hour, there are six nodes—yet in seeking the Elixir, only two nodes are employed. Within one hour, there is one hexagram—yet in seeking the Elixir, not even half a hexagram’s moment is needed. Within one hour, there are three talismans—yet in seeking the Elixir, only one talisman’s span is used. This is what is called the "single talisman, single method." Thus, the Yellow Emperor spoke of the *Yin Fu* (Tally of Yin): this is it. Hence it is said, "People know its divinity, yet the divine knows not why it is divine"—this is the reason.

When the immortal cultivator of the Elixir seizes this single talisman’s span, they compress the three thousand six hundred breaths of primordial *qi*, reversing and drawing them into the womb. At this moment, they seize the creative power of Heaven and Earth, steal the essence of the sun and moon. The earth’s axis takes form in the heart, the celestial gate rests in the hand. They blend the *qi* of the dragon and tiger, pound the true essence of gold and water into one. The serpent coils within the elixir furnace, the crow and hare traverse the Yellow Road. Black and white intermingle, hardness and softness alternate in succession. Auspiciousness is stored in the jade chamber, purple radiance reflects the sun. The fiery star guards the western pole, the Vermilion Bird flames in the void. They hasten the movement of water, urge the entry of metal, and press fire into the crucible. Steaming with the *qi* of the Great Yang, it coalesces into the Elixir of the Yellow Chariot.

When first refining gold and water, one guards against reckoning in years and months. Yet at the moment of combining the Elixir, only a single talisman’s effort is used. If prolonged, it harms one’s nature and damages the Elixir; if even slightly deficient, it shortens one’s lifespan. Thus it is said, "When years and months are nearly spent, nature is harmed and lifespan injured." The cultivation of the Elixir is fundamentally for extending life and ascending to truth—yet if off by a hair’s breadth, it instead harms one’s longevity. Therefore, Master Xu admonished later students: one must be cautious and meticulous. The "dust on the bright window"—this is the Elixir’s subtlest point.

Quanzhenzi Yu Yan said: In the method of the Elixir, first use half a catty of metal as the outer furnace, establishing the embankment in the southeast. Then let half a catty of water descend from the west into the northern inner furnace, so that its force is not constrained but flows freely and naturally. The ascent of metal spans from the first to the fifteenth day—fifteen days in total. The descent of water spans from the sixteenth to the thirtieth day—also fifteen days in total. This is what is meant by "half a catty each of metal and water." However, the method requires that the ascent be civil (wen) and the descent martial (wu). Without this, it cannot deeply reach the nine springs below. Hence it is said, "when approaching the furnace, fix the weights—five parts of water are in excess."

When metal and water combine to form the weight of one catty in the ratio of two to eight, opening and closing in endless alternation, this is the true yin and yang of our body. Yet the water must be slightly over half a catty, while the metal must not fall short of its half-catty weight. Hence it is said, "two parts are taken as true; the gold remains as heavy as its original state." As for the earth that "does not enter," this is because the crucible’s circumference contains only half a catty of metal above and half a catty of water below—there is no place for earth. Hence it is said, "it does not enter." Yet this is not truly "not entering." Earth has no fixed position; there is nowhere it does not enter. For example, among the twenty-four positions of Heaven and Earth, there is no wu-ji (戊己). Does this truly mean there is no wu-ji? From ren-zi to gui-hai, it wanders without constancy, rising and falling without regularity—there is nowhere that is not the domain of wu-ji. "Two accompanies them": earth pervades the crucible, moving together with the two, metal and water. When metal, water, and earth move as one, the three substances mutually contain and receive, merging the two into one. Merging the two into one, the clouds of ten thousand acres on Green Mountain are stilled, and the moon of one wheel is scooped from the azure pool—its transformations are as if divine.

Now, the ascending is metal, the descending is water, and what enables their ascent and descent is earth. Yet metal, water, and earth are but metaphors. The Great Dao has always been beyond names and forms—how could there be metal, water, or earth? The *Yuzhi Shu* states: "Refine the Elixir with the *qi* of the zi hour, when yang arises and the fire’s power is complete. At other times, the fire is not so." For at the zi hour, the Great Yang is in the north, and in the human body, it reaches the Gate of the Tailbone. Kindling the fire at this time unites inner and outer, allowing one to steal the mechanism of Heaven and Earth to form the Elixir. Initially, the Great Yang is below, water and fire mate, and the two *qi* steam and blend into liquid. Next, the fire within water ignites, yang *qi* gradually blazes, and the liquid congeals within, pressing out the golden radiance—this is true lead. As it is employed and ascends, it surges like a chariot traveling the Yellow Road, hence called the "Yellow Chariot."

When the work deepens and the fire’s timing completes a celestial cycle, it is like the thirtieth day of the twelfth lunar month, when Heaven’s movement is about to conclude. Then the true nature hides, and lifespan also comes to an end. This is what is meant by "shortening lifespan without duality—cultivate the body and await it."

People merely know that at the zi hour, when kidney *qi* arises, firing and refining can congeal it into liquid, mistaking this for true lead to be taken and transformed into the true mercury of the Li Palace. Yet they do not consider: once it has become liquid, it has form, substance, weight, and turbidity—how could it flow upward against the current? When immortals make the Elixir at this time, they merely kindle fire below to stir its *qi*. When the fire’s power is strong, the *qi* naturally billows upward, like clouds rising over mountains and rivers. Only after ascending into the Mud Pill Palace does it transform into sweet dew and descend into the Double Towers—never once using its substance. The Elixir method speaks of "taking the clear and discarding the turbid." The turbid sinks down—this is the form and body, becoming ash and earth. The clear floats up—this is like the dust on a bright window.

The *Cuixu Pian* says: "Hasten to return the hundred vessels to their source; when the pulse halts and *qi* ceases, the Elixir begins to form." An ancient song says: "Lead is the mother of the sprout, the sprout is the child of lead. Once the golden radiance is obtained, abandon lead and do not use it." It also says: "When it comes time to use lead, using lead is still a mistake"—its caution is profound.

Peng Haogu appended: This speaks of the Earthly Prime’s work. The Earthly Prime’s initial steps rely entirely on the three substances: metal, water, and fire. Within blackness, take white. Use metal as the embankment for water, so that metal and water flow freely, their natures in harmony. Calculating their weights: metal’s fifteen units correspond to the first to fifteenth days, totaling half a catty of metal above. Water’s fifteen units correspond to the sixteenth to thirtieth days, totaling half a catty of water below. As for the gathering, it lies in approaching the furnace and weighing the taels. Twenty-four zhu make one tael, one hundred ninety-two zhu make eight taels. Two zhu and four lei make one qian; one zhu and two lei make five fen. Water weighing five fen does not exceed one zhu and two lei—this is no concern. Yet at this point, it is already in excess, and the metal, from beginning to end, remains only eight taels, unable to balance with the water.

The Heavenly One generates water, the Earthly Four generates metal. In refining the Golden Elixir, only these two are true. The Heavenly Three’s wood does not enter into it, while the Earthly Two’s fire is the primordial fire within the Great Yang, which ever accompanies metal and water and cannot be separated from them.

Why is this so? The elixir is but metal and fire. The medicine is the parent of fire, and fire is the offspring of the medicine. Water resides within metal—thus they form the Three: metal, water, and fire. Once these three unite according to the proper method, the hun and shen naturally undergo wondrous transformations without end.

At first, the Great Yang lies below, its essence and qi steaming and brewing, gradually congealing the metal fluid. Next, fire arises within water, the yang qi blazing, and the metal fluid slowly solidifies. Later, when the fire’s power is sufficient, the metal fluid congeals completely and gathers in the Central Palace, becoming the divine chamber that gives birth to the numinous mercury, called the Yellow Chariot.

When the forging and refining have deepened and the years and months are nearly complete, the three substances all perish, their natures damaged and their years spent. The form and body transform into ashes and dust, glowing and flickering like sunlight through a window or motes of flying dust—intangible and beyond grasp.

These two are considered true, while the third does not enter. Ancient and modern interpretations differ: some take the two as the two phases of the medicine, with the third as the three phases, and beyond the four phases lies another wondrous use not included within the three phases. Others take the two as the two yang months, when the metal emerges from the geng direction and is suitable for gathering, while the third is the three yang months, when the metal is at its fullest and too distant for medicine-gathering. Still others take the two as half a catty of metal and half a catty of water, with one tael of lead containing three parts of divine water and one tael of cinnabar containing three parts of divine fire—this formless medicine is not included in the weight of the metal exchanged.

Upon careful reflection, none of these interpretations is entirely satisfactory. Those who grasp the principle must discern it for themselves.

In pounding, refining, and combining, hold fast as you enter the Red Gate. Secure its borders and defenses, ensuring they are complete and firm. Kindle the blazing fire below, maintaining its sound day and night with diligent care. Begin with the civil and end with the martial. Observe the signs, exercise caution, and carefully regulate the cold and warmth, cycling through the twelve nodes. When the cycle is complete, renew the effort, drawing close to the qi until life’s breath is nearly spent and death approaches. The hun and po transform, and the color shifts to a radiant purple—thus is the Returned Elixir formed. Powdered and shaped into a single pill the size of a knife’s tip, it is most divine.

Master True One Peng Xiao says: Pound and refine the foundation of the elixir until it is firm and complete, then secure the crucible within, calling it the Red Gate. Above, water flows downward; below, fire blazes upward. From new moon to full, advance and retreat; day and night, ascend and descend. The civil fire arises at midnight, the martial follows at dawn, ceasing at noon and beginning again with the yin tally until midnight. Govern the waxing and waning, adjusting the cold and warmth through the twelve nodes. When the cycle ends, begin anew. When the fire is sufficient, the hun and po change form, transforming into radiant purple gold—the Elixir is complete. Ingesting a single grain the size of a knife’s tip brings wondrous and boundless merit.

Master Embracing Unity Chen Xianwei says: This speaks of the work of activation, moving the bellows of Heaven and Earth. Pound and refine until reaching the southern Red Gate, then firmly seal it so that water and fire meet at their borders. This work continues day and night without cease. First ascend with the civil, then descend with the martial, cycling through the twelve hours. When the day ends, renew the effort, drawing close until the qi is nearly exhausted and life’s breath is on the verge of extinction. The hundred vessels return to their root, the ten thousand apertures fall silent—this is not death, yet it resembles death. After extinction, revival comes: the golden light turns purple, taking the form of purple powder. A mere knife’s tip of it appears here and there, its transformations unfathomable, its divine wonders beyond thought.

Master Supreme Yang Chen Zhixu says: Pounding and refining are the intermingling of yin and yang. Holding fast means preserving and gathering it in. The Red Gate is the door of qian; the elixir returns through qian’s door to the divine chamber. Securing it means closing the breath; the defenses are the nine apertures, all of which must be firm and complete, without loss. The blazing fire below, maintained day and night with diligent care—this is because when the yang elixir first arrives, it bears the signal of the fire within li. Day and night, it circulates through the body, and the hundred nodes and ten thousand spirits all obey its command. One must guard it diligently, keeping the sound still and the intent harmonious, the breath even and the pulse settled, so the elixir may begin to congeal.

"Begin with the civil and end with the martial" means that at the start of elixir-refining, one uses the civil fire, while the beginning and end both employ the martial fire. At the start, the martial fire refines the self; at the end, it warms and nurtures. Thus, the three phases are said to be martial at the beginning and end, civil in the middle.

"Observe the signs and exercise caution" means one must not be careless. As the Mud Pill Palace says, "If the work is insufficient, it will not be square and round." "Carefully regulate the cold and warmth" means not to be deceived by people or things. As the Purple Yang Elder said, "Adjust the fire’s timing, entrusting it to yin and yang."

Cycling through the twelve nodes, beginning anew each time, continue until the mercury is replenished and the lead is drawn out. When the lead is nearly exhausted and the mercury dries, the seven po die and the hun transforms—this is the qi being spent, life’s breath nearly gone, the hun and po on the verge of death.

At this stage, the color shifts to radiant purple gold—the Returned Elixir of cinnabar. "Powdered and shaped into a single pill the size of a knife’s tip, most divine" means its smallness is like a pinch of powder, like a grain of millet called a pill. Its lightness is like the tip of a knife—utterly minute. Yet its divine wonders are beyond description.

This passage thoroughly describes the work of beginning the practice. Yet its subtleties and mysteries must be transmitted orally by a master—who could rely on the text alone to accomplish the task?

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, states: The great elixir of the Golden Pill is born from the Kun earth, yet its seed lies in the Qian heaven. Qian resides above as the crucible, Kun below as the furnace. Without fierce firing and extreme forging, it cannot emerge from the furnace; without counterflow and reverse rotation, it cannot ascend to the crucible. The grinding, refining, and merging—these two are captured from their respective places and brought together in a single furnace, where a single ladle of divine water congeals into true butter.

When entering the Crimson Gate, one seizes the essence and marrow of the hare and crow, which must be swiftly gathered into the crucible and fired. The *Dacheng Ji* says: "Carry it to the crown and bind the Three Flowers, fasten the Golden Gate and Jade Lock." When golden cinnabar ascends to the crucible, the sealing must be firm and meticulous, so that the sacred embryo may be complete and unyielding.

This is the work of beginning in the postnatal realm. Within it, there is also the movement of spiritual fire to observe the true heart, and the stirring of the Xun wind to draw in the true spirit—subtle functions unknown to most. The *Jianwu Ji* says: "Because the fire of the elixir burns below, the Yellow River’s waters flow backward." Thus, the fire of refinement must burn intensely. When the fire in the Cinnabar Field blazes, clouds steam and mists surge; wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace, and the roars of dragons and tigers resound.

At the time of gathering the medicine, concentrate the spirit and gather the qi, with breath flowing continuously without interruption. Over time, the spirit settles and the qi stabilizes, naturally causing the Xun Gate to thunder, dragons to soar, and tigers to leap, driving the tail back to the empty cavity, chasing the flame into the Celestial Thoroughfare, and rushing upward to the King’s Palace. The *Baoyi Yun* says: "Civil fire gives rise, martial fire solidifies—begin with the civil and end with the martial; one cannot rely on a single path."

In vigilant observation, one must seal the orifices, lower the curtains, and contain the light, silently awaiting the arrival of heaven and earth’s qi. Only then does one stabilize the breath to gather it and assemble the fire to refine it. One must carefully assess its maturity, not acting carelessly. In examining cold and warmth, adjust the fire’s intensity; in examining slowness and urgency, proceed gradually and fiercely, not hastily or abruptly.

The twelve nodes are the twelve celestial stems within the body—positions of the fire’s timing. The fire’s timing ascends from *zi* to *wu* and descends from *wu*, circling the exterior of the crucible. When the entire celestial cycle has been traversed, the celestial net returns to *zi*, hence it is said: "One must be personally attentive."

When the Golden Pill congeals, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance halt their turning, and the sun’s spirit and moon’s essence both sink into the northern sea’s depths, extinguished and concealed, as if dead. At this moment, one returns to the root and revives the mandate; the spirit congeals and the qi coalesces, the eight vessels all still, breath entirely absent, the qi as if severed. After this severance, there is rebirth—what is called "this time, a great death, now truly alive."

The *Cuixu Pian* says: "Shedding the yellow and donning the purple—what is the reason? Only because the River Chariot has turned deeply." When the nine revolutions of the fire’s timing are complete, the Returned Elixir shines brilliantly, transforming into the radiant light of purple gold. It also says: "Gather it, refine it—before a moment passes, the qi flows ceaselessly through the Three Passes. The Three Passes come and go, the qi endless; a single white meridian ascends to the Mud Pill Palace. Above the Mud Pill Palace is the Purple Gold Crucible; within the crucible, a lump of purple gold transforms into jade nectar, flowing into the mouth, fragrant and sweet, refreshing and cool, filling the tongue. Swallowing it, it enters the five viscera, harmonizing the organs, strengthening the body, and bringing peace. For the Returned Elixir entering the mouth is like honey, sweet and fragrant as the coolness of *polan*—this is the 'knife’s tip, the corner of the jade tablet,' a mere trifle. Yet upon success, its thousand transformations and ten thousand changes are wondrous beyond measure, incomparable to minor arts of side paths. It is rightly called divine."

The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three; *wu* and *si* are called the Five Threes. When harmonized, the Eight Stones establish the proper order. Breath contains and nurtures, awaiting union as husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal, flowing pearl the child of water. Water takes earth as its ghost; earth restrains water from rising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, balancing victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire ages; when the old man revives, the aged woman becomes the youthful maiden, reshaping to escape worldly calamity—this is called the True Person, the True Unity.

Master Peng Xiao of the True One says: "The *zi* water is numbered one, the *wu* fire numbered two; together they form three. The *wu* and *si* earth are numbered five. Three and five combine to form eight—this is the harmony of the Three Fives, the proper order of the Eight Stones." Thus, the Green Dragon calls to the White Tiger, and the White Tiger inhales the Green Dragon; breath contains and nurtures, awaiting union as husband and wife.

"Yellow earth is the father of metal, flowing pearl the child of water"—earth can restrain water, so mercury does not fly away; this is the earth phase of the four seasons’ tail fire. Metal is complete through the Vermilion Bird, the spirit of fire, which balances victory and defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; when the new moon and crescent both end, merit returns to earth’s virtue.

When the three natures unite, they return to their original nature and shared ancestor. This means that metal and fire arise from the same number within the water’s qi, for they are born from the primordial qi before heaven and earth, capable of generating the Five Phases—not merely the two flavors of metal and water.

Master Chen Xianwei of the Embracing Unity says: "The Eight Stones are the external medicine. Using the Three Fives as analogy: *zi* water is one, *wu* fire is two; the numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three. Earth is numbered five, hence *wu* and *si* are called five. The harmony of the Three Fives is the union of water, fire, and earth. These three act as husband and wife, alternately as ruler and minister, like the Eight Stones mutually regulating one another. Earth generates metal, so earth is the father of metal; earth restrains water, so water is the ghost of earth. Flowing pearl is mercury, born from the sun and congealing into metal; metal generates water, so flowing pearl is the mother of water. Watering it, fire does not blaze; restraining it with earth, water does not overflow. Thus, the three substances become one family, all returning to *wu* and *si*. Water subdued by earth dissipates; fire subdued by earth is extinguished; metal subdued by earth returns to its father. Earth is the father of metal, so fire is the ancestor of metal—hence, when the three natures unite, the original nature shares a common ancestor."

Master Chen Zhixu of the Upper Yang says: "*Zi* resides in the north, the proper position of *kan*, numbered one; *wu* resides in the south, the proper position of *li*, numbered two. Within *kan* is earth, called *wu*, numbered five; within *li* is earth, called *si*, numbered five. *Wu* guards the gate of *kan*, controlling the qi of the primordial True Unity; *si* directs the door of *li*, accumulating the mercury of the postnatal utmost truth. To seek the primordial qi, one must pass through *wu* earth; to use the postnatal mercury, one must subdue it with *si* earth. When *zi* and *wu* joyfully harmonize, and *wu* and *si* unite, the essence of the two fives congeals and solidifies. *Wu* earth enters the *si* crucible, where the two earths bind—hence the name *gui*. The Eight Stones are Qian and Kun; Kun is the image, the father and mother of stones. Without Kun, one cannot obtain the order of *dui*. *Zi* and *wu* call to each other, *wu* and *si* contain and nurture, lead and mercury intertwine as husband and wife."

Yellow earth is *wu* earth; *wu* earth can generate metal within *dui*, thus it is the father of metal. Flowing pearl is wood-mercury; lead-water can nourish the mercury within wood, thus flowing pearl is the child of water. Lead-water takes *wu* earth as its ghost—once *wu* earth stabilizes the central palace, water does not recklessly flow outward. The Vermilion Bird is the substance within *li*, the essence of fire. When the heart is calm and qi harmonized, the pulse settles, allowing one to regulate its dominance and submission.

Water overcomes fire, fire overcomes metal, metal overcomes wood—these four ultimately dissolve their functions, returning to the fertile earth. Fertile earth is *si* earth. The three natures are *wu* metal and water. The gate of *kan* is called *wu*; the central line of *kan* is *dui* metal. Metal generates the water of Great Unity; once metal generates water, *wu* further restrains it—this is the convergence of the three natures in mutual containment. The wood nature is *si* earth; the door within *li* is called *si*. When *wu* metal, water, and *si* earth unite with the wood nature of *si*, wood is gradually overcome. All transform into the Great Elixir, hence it is said: "The original nature shares a common ancestor."

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: "The number of *zi* water is one, *wu* fire is two; combined they form the number three. The number of earth is five, thus the central *wu* and *si* are called five. Three and five together make eight, hence it is called the Eight Stones. When three and five harmonize, water, fire, and earth unite as one."

Moreover, earth overcomes water, water overcomes fire—how can they harmonize? It is because earth serves as the mediator between water and fire, reconciling and uniting them, enabling water and fire to bind as husband and wife, thus achieving harmony. Once the Eight Stones unite as one, the fundamental principles are rectified, and all phenomena unfold.

Yang ascends, yin descends—heaven and earth breathe within. This is the path to longevity; those who emulate it may also attain longevity. The *Jindan Dacheng Ji* states: "Exhale from the heart and lungs to connect with the celestial root; the dragon’s chant rises like clouds. Inhale into the liver and kidneys to connect with the terrestrial root; the tiger’s roar stirs the wind. Through this breathing, wind and clouds congeal into golden liquid—this is the natural respiration of the primal qi, not the breathing of mouth and nose."

If one can empty the heart, concentrate the spirit, and turn the light inward to illuminate the true person’s breath, following its ascent and descent, then after a short while, breath will mutually nurture, and one will stand in tranquil stillness. Thus, all becomes one, binding as husband and wife.

Liao Chanhui said: "Facing the navel’s wheel, behind the kidneys, at the center lies the true golden crucible—this is its place." Earth dwells at the center, hence it is called yellow earth; earth generates metal, thus it is the father of metal. True mercury flows and moves without fixed form, hence it is called flowing pearl. When it enters water and solidifies into metal, metal generates water, thus it is the mother of water. Now, earth enters water, and water is restrained by earth, unable to carry metal upward—hence it is said: "Water takes earth as its ghost." Earth fills water, preventing it from rising.

The Vermilion Bird is the fire essence of the southern direction, governing the summer season. Now, *kan* water is being subdued by earth; if it encounters the fierce firing of the southern fire, the fire will blaze intensely, the water will boil, and the metal will ascend with the water. Thus it is said: "The Vermilion Bird is the fire essence, balancing and regulating dominance and submission." When the boiling water surges upward into the *li* palace, *li* fire is in turn overcome by *kan* water. Fire, being overcome by water, dissipates—yet water must not overflow. Thus, earth is again used to restrain water, and water is stabilized by earth. Hence it is said: "Water and fire both return to earth."

When water and fire encounter earth, they become the three natures. Once the three natures unite, they merge into one, all returning to the *kun* palace—hence it is said: "The three natures share a common ancestor." Sesame can prolong life; the returning elixir can be ingested. Metal’s nature does not decay, thus it is the treasure of all things. Alchemists who consume it attain long life. Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding boundaries and establishing rules. Golden sand enters the five viscera, its mist and vapor like wind and rain, steaming and reaching the four limbs. The complexion becomes radiant, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow in their original sockets, old men regain youth, and aged women become maidens. The form is transformed, worldly calamities are averted—this is called a true person.

Master Zhenyi, Peng Xiao, said: "Giant sesame is sesame. Even those who consume it can prolong life—how much more so the golden liquid returning elixir? Once ingested, can one not attain immortality? The returning elixir first arises from true gold; the gold body is indestructible. This true gold is the ancestor of heaven and earth’s primal qi, the mother of all things. The *Daodejing* states: 'Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things.' Before heaven and earth, the primal qi was the origin, giving birth to all phenomena. Gold is the root of water, taken as the foundation of the medicine—thus true gold, the mother, can produce golden sand and form the returning elixir."

Earth travels through the four seasons, marking the beginning and end of the elixir path. Master Xu admonished later generations: the refinement and consumption of this medicine are wondrously unlike ordinary drugs. When this elixir enters the mouth, it is like clouds, mist, wind, and rain, directly entering the five viscera and four limbs, restoring youth, reversing aging, regenerating hair, and regrowing teeth—granting long life and enduring vision.

Master Baoyi, Chen Xianwei, said: "Sesame is also called giant sesame—this is an ordinary medicine. Even consuming it can prolong life; how much more so the divine elixir, the pure yang essence, whose nature is indestructible like vajra? Gold is the most precious treasure among all things. If one obtains and consumes it, longevity is assured—how could it not be ten thousand times superior to ordinary medicine?"

The four directions—*chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*—all contain earth, demonstrating that metal, wood, water, and fire all rely on earth to stand. Though the five viscera correspond to metal, wood, water, and fire, in truth, they rely on the five earths to flourish. Metal is the child of earth. When the true elixir enters the abdomen and the qi of metal penetrates the five viscera, a misty vapor pervades the body, steaming like a kiln when the fire is blazing, with water rising and descending like smoke and mist. At that time, the four limbs and hundred vessels are suffused as if by spring rain, steaming and flowing naturally. The complexion is renewed, bones are transformed, old age returns to infancy, the countenance becomes radiant, the spirit joyful, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow, old men become youthful, aged women become maidens, the form is altered, and worldly calamities are escaped. Day and night, clarity prevails; the spirit remains undimmed. The dharma body and illusory form are both fulfilled; yin spirit and yang spirit are equally wondrous—only then can one be called a true person.

At that time, though mingling with sages and mortals, one transcends the three realms. Though dwelling in the impure world, one’s actions and concealment are unfathomable. If one wishes to depart, one directly reaches Penglai; if one desires to roam freely, one instantly transcends the external world.

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhixu, said: "Giant sesame is sesame. If one regularly consumes it as food, it can prolong life—how much more so the returning elixir, refined from metal, water, *wu*, and *si*, becoming the supreme treasure of heaven and earth? Alchemists who subdue and consume it attain longevity equal to the sun and moon. 'Subdue' means to subdue the primal qi; 'consume' means to swallow the millet-sized elixir. Later generations mistakenly write it as 'serve' (*fu*), unaware of the subtlety of 'subdue' (*fu*)."

Thus, the immortal masters say: "To subdue qi, not to consume qi; to consume qi, one must first subdue qi. Consuming qi alone does not confer longevity—longevity requires subduing qi." The single word "subdue" (*fu*) operates in reverse, transforming the mechanism. Earth wanders through the four seasons; the four seasons are *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Earth combines with its days of prosperity: in each seasonal month, it reigns for eighteen days, called its "wandering." Only in summer, when fire generates earth, does earth’s virtue prevail, for metal fears fire. Thus, when autumn arrives, belonging to the *shen* month, the ancients held that both water and earth are born in *shen*: earth is generated by summer’s fire, while water arises at the Three Enclosures, restraining fire so that earth may generate metal. Therefore, at the onset of autumn, earth’s virtue first reigns for nine days, generating *geng* metal, and ceases at *xu*, where its nine-day reign is divided.

To guard boundaries and establish norms: in the east, *Di* earth guards the Azure Dragon’s domain; in the west, *Wei* earth regulates the White Tiger’s power; in the south, *Liu* earth measures the gate of *Li* fire; in the north, *Nü* earth stabilizes the door within *Kan*. Thus, the qi of cinnabar and true gold are subdued and returned into the five viscera. When the elixir first arrives, its qi disperses like mist, moistening like rain. The elixir’s qi steams and permeates the four limbs. Once spirit and qi are complete, the complexion becomes radiant, teeth regrow, hair blackens, old age reverts to youth, and withered forms are transformed. One forever escapes the calamities of the mortal world, achieving wondrous unity of form and spirit.

The Purple Radiance True Person said: "To begin refining the elixir, first harmonize the *wu* and *si* earths; only then may one gather metal and water to form the elixir."

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: "Giant sesame is sesame. Consuming it can still prolong life—how much more so the nine-times-cycled Great Returning Elixir of golden liquid, the time when metal’s essence is robust? Stealing the right qi of heaven and earth to congeal the sacred embryo, how could it not confer longevity? Gold’s nature is firm and unyielding, enduring ten thousand years without decay—it is the supreme treasure among the myriad things. Thus, the immortals esteem it highly. They do not call it the elixir of water, fire, earth, or wood but uniquely name it the Golden Elixir."

Earth has no fixed position but circulates between *chen*, *xu*, *chou*, and *wei*. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter are all places where earth wanders. Earth can exhaust water and conceal fire: when guarding water, water does not flow; when guarding fire, fire does not flame. Now, using it to guard *Kun* while gathering the medicine and to guard *Qian* while circulating fire—this is what is meant by "guarding boundaries and establishing norms."

Thus, when golden cinnabar ascends the crucible, it pierces the two kidneys, guides along the spine, passes through the heart meridian, enters the sea of marrow, rushes through the lung’s transport point, traverses the liver, crosses the spleen, and returns to the elixir field. As it ascends, it billows like clouds filling the four directions, whirls like a sudden storm, flashes like waking from a daydream, and disperses like a chronic illness leaving the body. Spirit and qi unite like husband and wife in embrace, bones and flesh harmonize like bathing and rising—these are the true visions.

From this point, day and night, one nurtures it without interruption, allowing the true qi to steam and reach the four limbs. Naturally, the spirit becomes clear, qi becomes invigorated, the complexion glows, white hair turns black, fallen teeth regrow, old men revert to youth, and aged women become maidens. Transforming form and transcending the world, one leaps from the cage, forever escaping the calamities of the dusty realm, becoming one with heaven and earth without end—thus is one called a True Person.

Extrapolating the numbers of the five phases, the method is concise yet not cumbersome. Using water to restrain fire extinguishes its light suddenly; the sun and moon mutually eclipse, always at the new and full moons. When water flourishes, *Kan* encroaches on yang; when fire wanes, *Li* dims the day. Yin and yang consume each other—this is the natural Dao.

True Unity Master, Peng Xiao, said: "The five phases are the qi of emptiness and nothingness, difficult to perceive. Yet if one examines them through the total numbers of heaven and earth, none escape their operation. Within the crucible, the five phases are constrained, yin and yang unite, fire rises as water retreats, water excites fire’s decline. The sun’s essence (*ri hun*) arises at the new moon, the moon’s spirit (*yue po*) ends at dusk. Male and female alternate, cinnabar and mercury generate each other—heaven and earth act naturally, and the elixir’s path becomes clear."

Embracing Unity Master, Chen Xianwei, said: "If one compares the five phases, fire, when meeting water, is suddenly extinguished. Yet the sun and moon are also water and fire—why, at every conjunction, do they not harm each other? Because heaven and earth’s yin and yang interact and consume each other according to fixed numbers. At set times, there is no harm from water flourishing or fire waning. If one can discern this mechanism and steal its use, then the cosmos is in hand, and the myriad transformations are born in the body. Though water and fire are mutually destructive, they unite as husband and wife; though metal and wood are separated, they naturally communicate. Yet none in the world can see or know this—how lamentable!"

Master Shangyang, Chen Zhixu, said: "The numbers of the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, earth—extend to the numbers of three, five, and one. In refining the Golden Elixir, lead, mercury, silver, cinnabar, and earth are the five phases, matched to yin and yang. Thus, water can extinguish fire because yin can dissolve yang. The sun and moon eclipse only at the new and full moons, where yin and yang, in their waxing and waning, encroach upon each other. If yin and yang harmonize and mutually consume, then the natural Dao of interaction arises."

Master Quanyang, Yu Yan, said: "*The Book of Changes* states: 'Heaven one, earth two; heaven three, earth four; heaven five, earth six; heaven seven, earth eight; heaven nine, earth ten'—these are the generative numbers of the five phases."

Zihua Zi said: "Among the great numbers of heaven and earth, none surpass five, none center upon five. Five is the number of earth, residing in the center. Combined with the north’s water one, it becomes six; with the south’s fire two, it becomes seven; with the east’s wood three, it becomes eight; with the west’s metal four, it becomes nine. The numbers stop at nine, for nine is the extremity of numbers. Speaking of the five numbers—one, two, three, four, six, seven, eight, nine—five is truly the central number. Numbers originally have no ten; that earth becomes ten arises from the north’s one, south’s two, east’s three, and west’s four converging at the center to form ten. Thus, when the center’s five disperses to the four directions, becoming six, seven, eight, and nine, water, fire, wood, and metal all rely on earth to form. If the four directions’ one, two, three, and four return to the center to form ten, then water, fire, wood, and metal all return to their source and are contained within earth.

Alas! The profound! The enlightened reverse and seek it within themselves—then it is utterly simple and not cumbersome."

The *Wuzhen Pian* states: "Two things arise from the child producing the mother." The *Hunyuan Baozhang* says: "The four positions are distinct, yet their use is inverted; the five phases together rise and together return." Both elucidate this principle. The *Huangji Jingshi* states: "The mutual eclipses of the sun and moon are the convergence of numbers." This principle is no different from the mutual restraint of water and fire. Now, if one pours water to douse fire, the fire is overcome by water, and its light is suddenly extinguished. When the Greater Yin obscures the Greater Yang, the Yang is vanquished by Yin, and the sunlight dims by day. Why is this? The mutual exchange and mutual consumption of Yin and Yang are the natural Dao.

Yet the mutual eclipses of the sun and moon always occur between the last and first days of the lunar month. Those who cultivate the elixir, seeking to steal from Heaven and Earth and seize the workings of Creation—can they not pursue this from this very point? "Naming" defines the essence, while "character" expresses the nature. Only when metal returns to its original nature can it be called the Returned Elixir. I dare not speak falsely; I emulate the sages' writings and ancient records. The titles—*Dragon and Tiger*, the Yellow Emperor’s *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s *Autumn Stone*, Yuyang’s *Yellow Sprout*—the worthy can practice them, while the unworthy have no part in them. From ancient times to the present, the Dao follows a single path. In discourse and planning, scholars must exert effort, ponder deeply, and hold fast to the essentials. The words are utterly revealed, bright and clear, never deceiving me.

Zhenyi Zi, Peng Xiao, says: "Metal is essence; water is nature. When metal gives birth to cinnabar, essence returns to nature. Moreover, metal is born from water, and water is the child of metal. The child, in turn, is born from metal, so water returns as the mother of metal—hence the name Returned Elixir. The earlier text speaks of the mother nurturing the child in the womb, the child nestled in the mother’s embrace. Yet Master Xu’s account is hardly deceptive; he borrows the imagery of the *Yijing* and the ancient *Dragon and Tiger Classic* to discuss it, praising the Yellow Emperor, Huainan, Yuyang, and the earlier perfected sages, all of whom practiced and achieved it. From ancient times to the present, the path is one and the same—beyond the reach of the unworthy. Thus, I admonish later generations to ponder deeply and seek the essential words, which are fully revealed, bright and clear, never deceiving us."

Baoyi Zi, Chen Xianwei, says: "This explains why the Returned Elixir is so named. 'Return' refers to essence, while 'elixir' refers to nature. 'Metal returns to its original nature' means that Metal Duke, born of my nature, now returns to meet its mother and reunites with the Maiden, forming the Infant—hence the name Returned Elixir. As the poem by Ziyang says: 'The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s child, sent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow. Once recognized, he is called home to nurture and wed the Maiden.' Though names vary across the ages, the Dao remains one."

Shangyang Zi, Chen Zhixu, says: "Metal and water share the name 'essence,' while wood and fire share the character 'nature.' Essence resides in the northwest, nature in the southeast. The southeast is 'self,' the northwest 'other.' The essence of metal and water naturally comes from without to restrain wood and fire. The nature of wood and fire returns within to congeal the Golden Elixir—this is what is meant by 'metal returns to its original nature' and is thus called the Returned Elixir. These two lines are the marrow of the *Cantong Qi*."

"I dare not speak falsely; I emulate the sages' writings." Master Xu received the true transmission of Boyang’s teachings, cultivated according to the method, and achieved the elixir. He then composed this book to instruct later generations. He recounted the Yellow Emperor’s achievement of the elixir, calling it *Golden Flower*; Huainan’s achievement, calling it *Autumn Stone*; Yuyang’s achievement, calling it *Yellow Sprout*. Each, upon ascending, bore a different name—yet all were this Returned Elixir, all were the primordial unified qi, all were the same substance.

Later generations, hearing *Golden Flower*, guessed it to be the five metals; hearing *Yellow Sprout*, guessed it to be the eight minerals; hearing *Autumn Stone*, guessed it to be urine. How could they know that the ancient sages and perfected ones established these names for convenience? The elixir they refined lies nowhere beyond Yin and Yang—is there another path? This Dao can only be diligently practiced by sages. From ancient times to the present, it has been one and the same. The great sages of the Three Teachings must share this substance to apply their efforts. Thus, it is said: "From ancient times to the present, the Dao follows a single path. In discourse and planning, apart from this one way, there is no other method." Later seekers must exert effort, ponder deeply, and seek a teacher’s guidance—then they will know that this book is bright and clear, fully revealed, never deceiving.

Quanyang Zi, Yu Yan, says: The *Fuming Pian* states: "One thing divides into two; what can make two is called the Two—namely, metal and wood. Metal and wood are not two separate entities. If metal is named, then wood is its character; if wood is nature, then metal is essence. In truth, they are one thing. The Metal Duke was originally the Eastern House’s child, sent to the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow—yet this cannot yet be called the Returned Elixir. Only when it is poured into the Eastern Yang’s alchemical furnace, returns home, and meets the Blue Maiden, producing a luminous pearl like the full moon, can it be called the Returned Elixir. Alternatively, when stillness is unmoving and essence returns to nature, it is also called the Returned Elixir—another meaning. The essential secrets of the Returned Elixir are fully revealed here.

The ancient records—*Dragon and Tiger*, the Yellow Emperor’s *Golden Flower*, Huainan’s *Autumn Stone*, Yuyang’s *Yellow Sprout*—are merely metaphorical names to convey meaning. How could the *Cantong Qi*, a single book, be empty fabrication or groundless speculation? It also emulates the subtle intent of the ancients. The *Fuming Pian* says: 'This Dao is most sacred; do not lightly disclose it. It depends entirely on virtue and conduct; frivolity and shallowness must be strictly avoided.' This shows that the Dao inherently detests both indiscriminate disclosure and failure to disclose to the right recipient. Grasp this one point, and all matters are complete—how true! There is no second Dao; the sages have no second mind. The myriad volumes of immortal scriptures all converge on the Golden Elixir as their root and origin. If scholars repeatedly ponder and savor this book, one day their minds will comprehend and their spirits will guard it—then they will know that the essential words are indeed fully revealed, bright and clear, without the slightest obscurity."

**Postscript:**
The *Cantong Qi* employs few words yet conveys great meaning; its language is subtle yet its principles profound. It arrays the Five Emperors to establish governance and matches the Three Sovereigns to institute order. Though rulers and ministers differ in rank, with no fixed standard for superiors and inferiors, if governance is thus ordered, great peace will not be achieved. The method of "subduing and consuming" cannot confer longevity; learning to nurture nature does not extend lifespan. Yet when it dissects Yin and Yang, harmonizes their weights, aligns the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, and forms the images of the Eight Trigrams—when male and female enact transformation, hardness and softness move and rest, and the grains of rice are distinguished—it takes the *Yijing* as its proof, its intent robust indeed. Thus, I have written this commentary to transmit it to later worthies. Only those who understand the Great Image will attain longevity, strengthen themselves, and benefit their bodies. Those who pursue this Dao must pay it utmost heed.

*Daoist Category – Synopsis*

[Your Servants] respectfully note: The *Baopuzi Nei/Wai Pian* in eight *juan* was composed by Ge Hong of the Jin dynasty. Hong, styled Zhichuan, was a native of Jurong in Danyang. He was deeply devoted to esoteric arts and once heard that consuming cinnabar could prolong life. He petitioned to serve as Magistrate of Julou, later retiring to Mount Luofu to refine elixirs and compose texts, expounding on the arts of nourishing life, *huangbai* (aurifaction), and other techniques. He styled himself *Baopuzi* ("Master Who Embraces Simplicity"), hence the title of the work. In his preface, he states that the *Neipian* (Inner Chapters) comprise twenty *juan* and the *Waipian* (Outer Chapters) fifty *juan*. However, the *Sui Shu*, *Tang Shu*, *Tongzhi*, and *Tongkao* record varying numbers of *juan*, suggesting discrepancies due to differing divisions in transmission. Chao Gongwu noted that the *Jin Shu* records 116 *pian* (chapters) in total for the Inner and Outer Chapters, while the version transmitted today contains only forty. Chen Zhensun further observed that the *Guange Shumu* (Catalogue of the Imperial Library) lists fifty *juan* for the Outer Chapters, though these have not been seen. Additionally, the *Yongle Dadian* includes a table of contents that, when compared to the present edition, reveals the loss of eight *pian*, including the *Dansha Fa* (Method of Cinnabar). This indicates that complete versions were already rare by the Song and Yuan dynasties. The present edition was collated and printed by Lu Shunzhi of Wucheng during the Ming dynasty, based on an acquired Song edition and two versions from the imperial library. Compared to other editions, it alone preserves the fewest omissions, and its chapter count aligns with Ge Hong’s original preface, confirming that Hong likely treated each *pian* as a single *juan*. As for Chao’s reference to 116 *pian*, its source remains unknown.

The *Waipian* (Outer Chapters) discuss the successes and failures of contemporary governance, the merits and demerits of human affairs, and abound in allusive analogies, displaying a wealth of reasoned argument. The *Neipian* (Inner Chapters) expound on matters of immortals, breath cultivation, and talismanic writs. Some Confucian scholars dismiss these as heterodox, yet the work’s diction is incisive, its erudition vast, and its literary elegance resplendent—qualities unmatched by later Six Dynasties compositions. It should not be summarily dismissed merely because it originates from the Daoist tradition.

**Preface to the *Baopuzi Neipian***

My nature lacks transcendent talent, yet I happen to favor the practice of non-action. Were I to unfurl my wings, I could soar through the empyrean; were I to spur my hooves, I could chase the wind and tread upon shadows. Yet I choose instead to restrain my mighty pinions among the flock of wrens and conceal my soaring traces within the herd of lame donkeys. How much more so when Nature endows me with wings of but ordinary span and Creation lends me hooves of the most halting gait? Having carefully assessed my abilities, I know my limits and dare not proceed. How could I, like a fly, aspire to the heavens’ vaulting flight, or like a lame turtle, pursue the hare’s swift course? How could I adorn the ugliness of Mo Mu to seek the beauty of the matchmaker, or demand a thousand gold from a goldsmith’s forge for a heap of sand and pebbles?

To stretch the strides of a *jiaoyao* dwarf to match the tracks of Kuafu is why the man of Yue stumbles and fails. To strain the frailty of Yao Li to shoulder the task of lifting a tripod is why the man of Qin breaks his back. Thus, I renounce the path of glory and honor, contenting my aspirations in the realm of poverty and adversity. To me, pulse and greens are as sweet as the eight delicacies, and a thatched hut brings the joy of carved rafters. Therefore, though the gates of the powerful and noble lie but a footstep away, I do not follow. Yet for those who know the Dao, though the way be arduous and distant, I must journey there.

Having perused no small number of rare and wondrous texts, I find that most abound in cryptic language, scarcely to be readily understood. Unless one’s spirit is supremely refined, one cannot plumb their depths; unless one’s practice is steadfast and sincere, one cannot fully perceive their truths. Among Daoist scholars, those of profound learning and wide discernment are few, while those who indulge in reckless conjecture and groundless assertions are many. From time to time, there arise men of earnest intent who wish to cultivate and refine themselves, yet in their haste they know not where to begin. When doubts arise in their minds, there is none to whom they may turn for counsel.

Thus, I have composed this work, roughly outlining the principles of long life. Its most sublime truths cannot be fully conveyed in written words; what is set down here is but a coarse and sketchy account, offered as a corner of the whole, in the hope that those who are stirred to earnest inquiry may reflect upon it and thereby grasp more than half the matter. How could this suffice for those of dim and obstructed vision to fathom its subtleties or traverse its vast expanse? It is but a preliminary discussion of what must come first.

The scholars of this world, shackled by their unquestioning devotion to the teachings of Zhou and Kong, cling to death and refuse to believe in the affairs of immortals, dismissing them as heretical delusions. Should they chance upon this work of mine, they will not only laugh it to scorn but also slander and revile what is true and authentic. Therefore, I have not sought to conform to the world’s expectations. Among the many works I have authored, I have set this one apart, titling it *Inner Chapters*, comprising twenty scrolls, each arranged in its proper sequence alongside the *Outer Chapters*.

Though it may not be worthy of concealment in a famous mountain’s stone chamber, I intend to seal it within a golden casket, to be shown only to those who recognize its value. Let it not be seen by those with whom such matters cannot be discussed. My aim is that future generations of seekers of long life may have their confusions dispelled—how could I seek validation from those who refuse to believe?

**The Inner Chapters of the Master Who Embraces Simplicity, Scroll One**
*Composed by Ge Hong of the Jin Dynasty*

**Chapter One: Elucidating the Dao**

The Master Who Embraces Simplicity states: The Dao is the primordial ancestor of all spontaneity and the great origin of the ten thousand differences. How profound its depths—thus it is called "mysterious." How boundless its expanse—thus it is called "wondrous." Lofty, it crowns the nine heavens; vast, it envelops the eight directions. Brighter than the sun and moon, swifter than lightning, it now flickers and vanishes like a shadow, now scatters like drifting stars, now shimmers like a limpid abyss, now billows like floating clouds. From the faintest stirrings, it gives rise to being; in utter stillness, it becomes nonbeing. It sinks into the deepest obscurity, soars beyond the farthest reaches. No metal or stone can match its hardness; no dew or mist can equal its softness. Square yet unbound by the carpenter’s square, round yet unconfined by the compass, it comes unseen and departs untraced.

Heaven is exalted by it; Earth is humbled by it. Clouds drift by its motion; rain descends by its bestowal. It shapes the primordial unity within the womb, forges the Two Modes from its mold. It exhales and inhales the Great Beginning, smelts and tempers the myriad things. In ceaseless revolution, it completes the twenty-eight constellations, steers the numinous mechanism of chaos, breathes forth and draws in, encompasses the obscure and the silent. It expands and contracts, sinks the turbid and raises the pure, measures the Yellow River and the Wei like a wine steward—adding without overflow, ladling without depletion. Bestow, and it does not flourish; seize, and it does not wither.

Where the Dao abides, joy knows no end; where the Dao departs, vessels decay and spirits flee. The five tones and eight timbres, the flowing strains of *qingshang*—they deafen the sharp-eared. Rare blossoms and dazzling hues—bright as flame, resplendent—they blind the clear-eyed. Feasting in ease, fine wine and fragrant spirits—they disorder the nature. Alluring beauty, painted faces, leaden powder and white silk—they sap the life. Those who know the Dao may attain enduring existence; those who know it not can scarcely preserve their lives.

A glance may become the instrument of death; lips and tongue, the pivot of rise and fall. Ornate pavilions overlook the Milky Way; gilded chambers, carved rafters, and embroidered curtains interlace like clouds. Silken canopies drift like mist, kingfisher plumes adorn the inner chambers. Golden goblets flash in the revelry, clear melodies and clamorous pipes blend in unison. The dances of Zheng swirl in profusion, mournful flutes soar to the clouds, feathered canopies float upon rippling waters. Plucking fragrant blossoms in orchid groves, toying with crimson petals in pools of pearls, ascending heights to gaze afar and forget a hundred sorrows, peering into depths to dispel morning hunger—entering banquets aglow with a thousand gates, departing in chariots of vermilion splendor.

Yet when joy reaches its peak, sorrow follows; when fullness is attained, loss is near. Thus, when the music ends, sighs arise; when the feast concludes, the heart grieves. This is the inevitable summons of principle and circumstance, like echo answering sound, shadow following form. No borrowed illusion, but truth itself—things pass as if forgotten.

The Dao of the Profound—those who attain it turn inward, those who lose it turn outward; those who employ it are spirit, those who forget it are mere tools. This is the essential teaching of the Profound Dao.

Those who attain it hold honor without need of golden axes’ might; they embody wealth without reliance on rare treasures. Lofty beyond ascent, deep beyond fathoming, they ride the streaming light to guard against time’s flight, soaring through the Six Voids, pervading and dissolving—emerging from the realm above all, entering the realm below none, traversing the boundless gate, roaming the distant wilds. In carefree wandering through the indistinct and vague, in lingering amid the faint and fleeting, they swallow ninefold blossoms amid cloud peaks, savor the six qi upon cinnabar clouds, meander through the obscure, soar through the subtle, tread the coiled rainbow, stride the revolving sphere. Such are those who attain it.

Next are those of true contentment. Knowing sufficiency, they can withdraw in reclusion, nurturing their radiance in mountain forests, unfurling phoenix and dragon wings among the tiniest creatures, cultivating vast qi within humble thatched huts. They wear hempen robes and woven belts, yet do not envy the splendor of embroidered silks; they walk with staff and sandals, yet do not exchange them for the trappings of four-horse carriages. They hide luminous pearls in lofty peaks, untouched by other mountains’ assaults; they sink scales and armor into dark abysses, avoiding the calamity of drilling and scorching. In movement and stillness, they know when to stop—nothing is lacking. They cast aside the dazzling pomp of court, shun the perilous paths of overturned chariots, chanting and whistling among green cliffs where all things become mere dust, delighting beneath lush boughs where vermilion gates are but hempen cords. Holding the plow in open fields, they wave their insignia as if merely wielding a whip; sipping tea and rinsing with spring water, they find the grandest feast no better than wild greens. Thus, they abound in joy within the realm of non-action, rejoicing equally in high and low where no strife exists. Embracing purity and guarding simplicity, free from desire and care, they preserve their true nature within the empty vessel, dwelling in equanimity, vast and unbounded—equal to the undifferentiated, in harmony with creation’s accord. Like darkness turning to light, like turbidity clarifying, seemingly slow yet swift, seemingly waning yet full, how could they deign to cast aside the dust of sacrificial priests, abandon the master craftsman’s role, or usurp the butcher’s place with ignorant hands? They do not wield the carpenter’s line to aid the hand-wounding laborer, nor fret over trifles like the stench of rats, troubling the common man’s joys and sorrows. Detached, they do not delight in the praise of the vulgar; unshaken, they do not fear the slander of the herd. They do not let external things disturb their utmost essence, nor allow profit and harm to stain their purity. Thus, neither extreme wealth nor supreme rank can tempt them, nor can praise bring them pleasure. Even the threat of naked blades or boiling cauldrons cannot coerce them.

How could slander and defamation ever distress them? Ever without intention amid the myriad vexations, they have never mingled with things.

Consider those who wield a Sui pearl to shoot a sparrow, guard against Qin’s hemorrhoids to secure a chariot post, climb a rotten rope to raid a nest, or swim the Lüliang rapids to catch fish—who by day strike the pose of a lone lord and by night scavenge like a fox or crow. Their beams sag, their tripods overturn, they founder and cannot recover. Such are the deeds that make the world race and strain to keep pace, yet chill the heart and freeze the marrow of those who have attained the Way.

Thus the perfected person silently embodies the music of Shao and Xia, veils their radiant hues, and unfurls their six pinions in the wasteland of the five domains without need of reed-stalk defenses. They conceal their scales and horns in places of no use, without relying on crooked or superfluous preparations. Below, they are free from the haughty screech of the owl; above, they know no regret for overreaching. No one recognizes them—they are distant indeed.

**Discourse on Immortals, II**

Someone asked: “Immortals do not die—can this truly be attained?”
The Master Who Embraces Simplicity replied: “Even with the keenest sight, not all forms can be seen; even with the sharpest hearing, not all sounds can be heard. Though one possess the wisdom of Yu, Yi, Qi, and Xie, what one has recognized is far less than what one has not. The ten thousand things teem—how could they not include immortals? The bamboo and silk records are filled with them. Why would the Way of undying be absent?”

The questioner laughed loudly: “Whatever has a beginning must have an end; whatever exists must perish. Thus the sages of the Three Dynasties and the Five Emperors, the wisdom of Jie and Ping, the eloquence of Duan and Ying, the valor of Ben and Yu, and the strength of the Five Ding—all died. This is the constant principle of human existence, the great inevitability that must come to pass. We have heard of plants withering before the first frost, wilting in midsummer, bearing ears that never bloom, or withering before they fruit—but never of one who enjoys ten thousand years of life, an age of enduring vision. Therefore, the ancients did not seek immortality in their studies, nor speak of marvels in their words. They rejected heterodox paths and upheld this natural order, relegating the crane and the tortoise to another realm, equating life and death with morning and evening.

“To torment the heart and constrain the self in pursuit of futile endeavors is like carving ice or chiseling rot—ultimately, no certain success can be achieved. Would it not be better to unfurl lofty defenses for the age, summon the blessings of the present, causing purple and azure to intertwine in layered splendor, black tripods to stand in place of plows, and swift chariots to replace weary steps? Is this not far more splendid?

“Often I ponder the *Poet’s* rebuke in ‘Fufu,’ and deeply reflect on Confucius—both are proof of mortality. Why grasp at the wind’s formless breath, chase shadows impossible to seize, seek what cannot be obtained, or tread paths that cannot be traversed? To abandon glory and endure hardship, forsake the easy to pursue the most difficult, is like a mourner chasing a wandering woman—inevitably leading to double loss. The blind faith of a single-minded zealot invites swift calamity, both internal and external.

“The striped autumn cicada cannot shave tile or stone into a needle’s point; Ou Ye cannot forge lead or tin into a Gan Jiang blade. What cannot be done, even spirits cannot accomplish; what cannot be achieved, even heaven and earth cannot bring to fruition. How could the world possess a miraculous formula to restore the old to youth or revive the dead? Yet you seek to prolong the mayfly’s life to span epochs, to nurture the morning mushroom’s brief bloom into the accumulation of months and years. Are you not mistaken?”

“I urge you to reflect further,” said the Master Who Embraces Simplicity. “Many things share a common root yet diverge in their ends—they cannot be lumped together. To say that whatever has a beginning must have an end is often true, but to conflate them all is not sound reasoning. One may say summer must be long, yet shepherd’s purse and wheat wither; one may say winter must be barren, yet bamboo and cypress flourish. One may say all that begins must end, yet heaven and earth are endless; one may say all that lives must die, yet cranes and tortoises endure.

“Scorching summer should be hot, yet there are cool days even in midsummer; deep winter should be cold, yet there are moments of warmth even in the harshest season. The hundred rivers flow east, yet some surge northward; the earth’s nature is utterly still, yet it may quake and crumble. Water is inherently cold, yet there are boiling springs in warm valleys; fire is by nature scorching, yet there are icy flames on Xiaoqiu. Heavy things should sink, yet the Southern Sea has mountains of floating stone; light things should float, yet the Fang branch has streams where feathers sink. The myriad differences cannot be judged by a single standard—so it has long been.

“Of all living things, none are more spiritually endowed than...”

“Of all living things, none are more spiritually endowed than humans, yet their natures should not be assumed identical. The wise and the foolish, the upright and the perverse, the fair and the foul, the long-lived and the short-lived, the pure and the turbid, the chaste and the wanton, the swift and the slow, the hasty and the patient—what they pursue and what they desire through ear and eye differ so utterly that between them lies a gulf as vast as that between heaven and earth, as irreconcilable as ice and burning coals. Why then should it seem strange that immortals differ from ordinary mortals in not sharing their inevitable death?

“If one claims that all beings receive a fixed measure of qi, then how is it that the pheasant becomes a clam, the sparrow a mussel, the loess gains wings, the river frog takes flight, the water-rat turns into a clam, the water-shield plant into maggots, the field mouse into a rail, the rotting grass into fireflies, the alligator into a tiger, and the snake into a dragon? If one claims that humans are endowed with a singularly upright nature while all other creatures receive their mandate from Heaven without distinction, then how is it that Niu Ai turned into a tiger, the old woman of Chu into a soft-shelled turtle, Zhi Li into a willow, and the maiden of Qin into stone—only to revive, exchanging male for female, transforming their forms? Why is it that Lao Peng lived long while Shangzi died young?

“If such differences exist, then what limit can there be to their strangeness? As for the immortals, they nurture the body with medicinal substances and prolong life through arts of calculation, preventing internal illness and warding off external harm. Though they may live long without dying, their original form remains unchanged. If one possesses the Dao, this presents no difficulty.

“Yet those of shallow understanding, bound by convention and clinging to the commonplace, all say, ‘We have never seen an immortal, so such beings must not exist in the world.’ But what can truly be known by what the eye has once seen? Within the vastness of Heaven and Earth, boundless and without limit, how can its myriad wonders be so quickly exhausted? A man may wear the sky as his canopy yet never know what lies above it; he may tread the earth all his life yet never fathom what lies beneath it. Even his own body, which he possesses, remains a mystery to him—he does not understand how his heart and lungs function. Lifespan lies within his own power, yet he does not know how to extend or shorten it. How much less, then, can those who rely on their shallow senses to judge the existence or nonexistence of the profound mysteries of immortality and the abstruse principles of the Dao be anything but pitiful?

“Suppose there were a sage of great talent who, shunning worldly employ, concealed his brilliance and veiled his splendor, casting off falsehood and abandoning desire, holding fast to the uncarved block in the midst of perfect purity, and leaving trivial affairs to the vulgar world. Even such a man would seldom be recognized by his contemporaries, for few can discern the true nature of one whose aspirations soar beyond the nameless, whose spirit dwells within a humble form. How much less, then, could the immortal be perceived? His pursuits are singular, his path extraordinary. He regards wealth and nobility as misfortune, glory and splendor as defilement, luxury as dust and dirt, and fame as morning dew. He treads through scorching winds yet remains unburned, steps lightly upon dark waves, stirs the dust with beating wings, and rides the wind with a chariot drawn by clouds. He soars upward to the Purple Pole, rests below on Kunlun. How could such a being be seen by those who are but walking corpses?

“Even if he were to wander playfully through the human realm, concealing his true form and disguising his marvels, appearing no different from the common crowd, shoulder to shoulder and step for step—who would be able to recognize him? If all immortals were like the man from the suburbs with his square pupils or Qiong Shu with his double ears, then indeed they might stand out.”

Those like the Yellow Thearch riding dragons or Prince Jin personally driving white cranes—some with scaled bodies and serpent heads, others in golden chariots and feathered robes—might yet be known. But if they are not thus, how could one not of penetrating vision ever glimpse their forms, or one not of acute hearing ever catch their voices?

Ordinary people, already lacking belief, recklessly heap slander and reproach, which the perfected ones find loathsome, driving them ever deeper into concealment. What the common crowd cherishes, the lofty scholar detests; what the vulgar hold dear, the realized one scorns. Even the noble scholar of vast capacity, who nurtures his boundless *qi*, still finds no joy in the company of the shallow and worldly—how much less would the divine immortals trouble themselves to make known their existence to those no better than straw dogs? What could they possibly seek from such as these? Yet people marvel at what they have never truly known.

Eyes that can barely discern objects a hundred paces away presume that what they see exists and what they do not see does not—yet how much must remain unseen in the world! This is like measuring the sea with a finger and claiming the water ends where the fingertip reaches. How could the mayfly compare itself to the giant turtle, or the white orchid fathom the great *chun* tree?

Emperor Wen of Wei, who had read widely and heard extensively, claimed to have experienced all things under heaven, declaring that no blade could cut jade nor fire-washed cloth exist. Yet when he wrote his *Dian Lun*, scarcely had he spoken these words when both objects appeared before him. The emperor sighed and swiftly destroyed his treatise, for nothing is certain, and all things may yet prove otherwise.

Prince Si of Chen wrote his *Shiyi Lun*, saying at first that the arts of the Dao were mere tricks to deceive the foolish, empty words without substance. But after witnessing Emperor Wu test Zuo Ci and others, who went without grain for nearly a month yet showed no pallor and retained their strength, claiming they could go fifty years without food—what doubt remained then? He also saw Gan Shi feed fish with an elixir before boiling them in seething oil: those without the drug cooked and became edible, while those that had swallowed it swam playfully all day as if still in water. Gan Shi also fed silkworms with a powdered mulberry drug, and they lived until the tenth month without aging. He fed chicks and newborn puppies with an "eternal youth" elixir, and they ceased growing. He fed white dogs with a "returning black" drug, and within a hundred days, their fur turned entirely black. Thus, he realized that the affairs of the world cannot be fully known, nor can one rely on conjecture alone.

Yet he lamented that he could not renounce sensual pleasures and devote himself wholeheartedly to the study of the Dao of long life. Both Cao Cao and Cao Pi were men of learning, with no book left unread, and talents that marked them as paragons of their age. Yet at first, they dismissed such things as nonexistent, only to later acknowledge their reality. Their sighs of regret at not matching such beings were profound—how could those who do not believe in immortals be blamed?

Liu Xiang, a scholar of vast learning, delved into the subtlest mysteries, his thoughts far-reaching and his reasoning clear, discerning truth from falsehood and verifying existence from nonexistence. In his *Liexian Zhuan*, he recorded over seventy immortals—if these accounts were fabrications, why would he have composed them? The events of remote antiquity cannot be witnessed firsthand; we rely on records and transmitted accounts. The *Liexian Zhuan* shines with undeniable truth—yet because its words did not emerge from the gates of the Duke of Zhou nor pass through the hands of Confucius, the world ultimately refuses to believe. If this were so, then all records in ancient histories would be false—how could only this one matter be an exception?

Ordinary people, greedy for glory and eager for advancement, chase after fame and profit, projecting their own hearts onto the ancients. Thus, they disbelieve that there were those who fled imperial abdications and scorned the honors of ministerial rank—men like Chao Fu and Xu You, Lao Lai and Zhuang Zhou. How much more difficult, then, to comprehend the divine immortals? How could one seek to make them known to such people? Yet in this age, many still believe in Liu Xiang, though he was no sage, and dismiss his records as unverifiable—this is truly cause for sighing.

The *Spring and Autumn Annals* could not match the virtue of heaven and earth, yet Confucius relied on them to compose his classic. The *Records of the Grand Historian* could not rival the brightness of the sun and moon, yet Yang Xiong praised them as true accounts. Liu Xiang was a renowned Confucian of the Han dynasty—how could his records be discarded?

The reason people do not believe that immortality can be learned or that life can be prolonged is precisely because the First Emperor of Qin and Emperor Wu of Han sought it in vain, and because men like Luan Da and Shao Jun failed to produce results. Yet one cannot deny the wealth of Tao Zhu and Yi Dun simply because of the poverty of Qian Lou and Yuan Xian, nor deny the beauty of Xi Shi and Nan Wei because of the ugliness of the woman from Wuyan or the woman with the goiter.

Even in worldly pursuits, there are those who do not succeed: farmers may fail to reap a harvest, merchants may suffer losses. How much more so for the Way of immortality? Why should the failures of a few determine the impossibility of success? Those who dismiss what they have never known are like the man who measures the sea with his finger and declares the water ends where his fingertip reaches. How could the ephemeral mayfly compare to the giant turtle, or the fleeting white orchid fathom the great *chun* tree?

Even in warfare, there are those who achieve no merit—how much more so for the pursuit of immortality, a far more difficult endeavor? Why must every seeker succeed? Those two sovereigns and their two ministers may have sought in vain, or perhaps they began with diligence but grew lax, or never encountered a true master. How could their failure prove the nonexistence of immortals?

The quest for longevity and the cultivation of the supreme Way depend upon resolve, not upon wealth or rank. For those unsuited to the path, high position and vast riches become nothing but heavy burdens. The methods of immortal learning require serenity, detachment, and the cleansing of desires—turning inward, dwelling in stillness, and abiding without thought. Yet emperors bear the weight of all under heaven, managing the affairs of state, their minds strained by ten thousand concerns, their spirits scattered across the cosmos. A single misstep disrupts the royal Way, and the people’s suffering disturbs the harmony of qi. *[Text missing]* Allurements sever the roots of life, dissipating essence and wearing down the mind, eroding the purity of the spirit. *[Text missing]* The matter cannot be fully expounded here.

When mosquitoes bite the skin, one cannot sit in peace; when lice swarm, one cannot sleep at ease. How much greater are the affairs of the four seas—how could one possibly shield one’s senses, still one’s breath, maintain long fasts, and purify oneself, rising early and retiring late to tend the furnace and refine the eight minerals?

Emperor Wu of Han reigned longer than any other, having already gained some small benefit in nurturing his nature. Yet the aid he received was but a drop in the bucket compared to the vast expenditures he made. *[Text missing]* His lavish patronage of fangshi led them to dare such wild fabrications. Had Luan Da truly possessed the Way, how could he have been executed? Those who possess the Way regard rank as a cauldron of boiling water, seals of office as mourning garments, gold and jade as dirt and dung, and grand halls as prisons. How could they clench their fists in empty boasts, hoping to chance upon glory and splendor? Dwelling in vermilion chambers, receiving boundless gifts, bearing the seal of the Five Powers, marrying imperial princesses, and wallowing in power and profit without restraint—such men clearly never attained the Way.

According to the *Household Records of Li Shaojun* compiled by Dong Zhongshu, Shaojun possessed the formula for immortality but was too poor to purchase the necessary ingredients. Thus, he entered Han service as a pretext to seek funds, and once his Way was complete, he departed. Furthermore, the *Daily Records of the Han Palace* state that before Shaojun’s departure, Emperor Wu dreamed of ascending Mount Song with him. Halfway up, a messenger riding a dragon descended from the clouds, bearing a tally, and said, “The Supreme One summons Shaojun.” Upon waking, the emperor told his attendants, “As in my dream, Shaojun will soon leave me.” Days later, Shaojun claimed illness and died. After some time, the emperor had his coffin opened, and only his clothes and cap remained.

The *Scriptures of the Immortals* state: the highest adepts ascend bodily into the void, becoming celestial immortals; the middling roam the famous mountains, becoming terrestrial immortals; the lowest die first and then shed their forms, becoming corpse-liberated immortals. Shaojun must have been one of the latter. In recent times, Master Hu took Fei Zhangfang away, and the Daoist Li Yiqj departed with two disciples. Later, they were seen in Pixian County. Their families each opened their coffins and found only a bamboo staff inscribed with cinnabar script—all were corpse-liberated immortals.

In the past, Wang Mang cited the classics to adorn his treachery, yet one cannot say all Confucians were usurpers and thieves. Sima Xiangru eloped with Zhuo Wenjun through the pretext of playing the zither, yet one cannot say all refined music promotes licentiousness.

Those who choke to death cannot blame Shennong for sowing grain; those burned to death cannot resent Suiren for drilling fire; those drowned cannot resent the Yellow Emperor for inventing boats; those who perish from alcohol cannot condemn Du Kang for brewing wine. Seeing Zhao Gao and Dong Zhuo, one cannot claim there were no Yi or Zhou in antiquity; seeing Shangchen and Modu, one cannot claim there were no Boqi or Xiaoji in ancient times.

Moreover, the *Collected Writings on Divine Immortals* contains methods for summoning spirits and exorcising demons, as well as techniques to make people see demons. Common folk, upon hearing this, dismiss it as empty rhetoric. Some say there are no demons in the world; others claim they exist but cannot be summoned or exorcised. Still others say that those who see demons—men called *xi*, women called *wu*—must possess the ability naturally and cannot acquire it through learning. Yet the *Book of Han* and the records of the Grand Historian both state that the Qi man Shaoweng was appointed by Emperor Wu as General Wencheng. When the emperor’s beloved Lady Li died, Shaoweng enabled him to see her as if she were alive, and even allowed him to behold the kitchen god. These are clear accounts in the historical annals.

If techniques can make demons appear in visible form and even allow those who have never seen them to perceive them, then what else might not be possible? Demons and spirits often manifest strange and wondrous transformations in the world, and many such accounts are recorded in the classics. Yet even these, common folk refuse to believe—how much less, then, would they accept the existence of immortals? Immortals dwell in lofty, distant realms, their pure currents flowing apart from the turbid. Ascending beyond, they depart and never return to the world. Without attaining the Dao, how could one witness or hear of them? The Confucians and Mohists, knowing such matters cannot serve as instruction, thus never speak of their existence. Is it any wonder that common folk do not believe?

Only those with true insight, who examine and test myriad methods, can verify their signs and confirm their existence—this is knowledge attainable only by the discerning. It cannot be forced. Thus, not seeing demons or immortals does not mean they do not exist in the world.

All people, wise or foolish, know their bodies possess *hun* and *po* souls. When these souls depart partially, illness follows; when they depart entirely, death ensues. If they depart partially, practitioners of the arts have methods to restrain and recall them; if they depart completely, the rites prescribe means to summon them back. These are the closest of all phenomena to us. Yet from birth to death, none have ever perceived them directly. Can one then deny their existence simply because they have not been seen?

Consider the demon of Lord Fu, who repaid kindness; the spirit of King Tang, who raged against Qi; the ghost of Shensheng, who spoke through a fox; the specter of Du Bo, who exacted vengeance on King Xuan of Zhou; Pengsheng, who took the form of a black boar; Ruyi, who borrowed the body of a gray dog; Guan Fu, who guarded the field of Tian Ben; the descent of Rushou at the mourning of Duke Jian of Yan; the sojourn of the Marquis of Luan in a commoner’s home; the discourse of Su Jiang on weft prophecies; the writings of filial sons; the words of the Divine Lord to Emperor Wu; and the service of Yang Shi in the court of Wu. Accounts of demons and spirits fill the bamboo and silk records, so numerous they cannot all be recounted. Yet the blind still deny their existence—how much more so the rare and seldom-heard-of matter of immortality? To demand absolute belief in such things is like expecting a mosquito to carry a mountain or a frog in a well to discourse on the sea.

Common folk, having never seen dragons, unicorns, *luan* birds, or phoenixes, claim such creatures do not exist, dismissing them as empty auspicious omens invented by the ancients to encourage rulers to unceasing self-improvement in hopes of attracting such treasures. How, then, can they be made to believe in immortals?

When Liu Xiang failed to transmute gold, people concluded that Su Qin’s strange conduct and fondness for propagating emptiness meant his *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals* was also a fabrication. Alas! This is like discarding a foot-long luminous pearl because of a tiny flaw, or casting aside a priceless pure hook because of an ant-nose sword. It is not the far-reaching insight of Jing He or the true discernment of Feng Hu. This is why Zhu Gong was filled with sorrow and Xue Zhu sighed endlessly.

The methods for transmuting gold are all found in the *Collected Writings on Divine Immortals*. The Prince of Huainan copied them out to create the *Hongbao* and *Pillow Book*. Though the texts exist, their essentials are kept secret, requiring oral instructions and on-the-spot explanations before they can be practiced. Moreover, the ingredients used often have altered names, making them impossible to identify and use directly. Liu Xiang’s father, Liu De, obtained these books while overseeing the Prince of Huainan’s imprisonment. Liu Xiang himself had no teacher in the Daoist arts; he merely chanced upon these texts and assumed their meaning was fully contained on the page. Thus, his failure to transmute gold was inevitable.

As for his *Arrayed Traditions of Immortals*, he compiled it from the Qin Grand Historian’s records and the *Book of Han*, or from what he had personally witnessed—it was no fabrication. Even madmen’s ramblings and children’s rhymes are sometimes heeded by sages, and the words of woodcutters may not be discarded. One gathers *feng* and *fei* without rejecting their roots—how can a single error in a hundred considerations lead one to dismiss the classics entirely? Just as one does not deny the great brilliance of the celestial bodies because the sun and moon sometimes eclipse, so too should one not reject the possibility of immortality.

Foreigners make crystal bowls by combining five kinds of ash, and today in Jiaozhi and Guang many have mastered this method and cast them. Yet when told this, common folk refuse to believe it, insisting that crystal is a natural substance, a kind of jade or stone. How, then, could they accept that naturally occurring gold might be artificially produced? Fools do not believe that red lead and ceruse are made from transformed lead, nor that mules and *ju* are born of donkeys and horses. They claim each thing has its own kind—how much more so for matters difficult to comprehend!

The less one sees, the more one finds strange—this is the way of the world.

Indeed, how true are these words! Though the matter concerns the brilliance of heaven, people dwell beneath an upturned steamer—how could they recognize the profound truth?

*Responding to the Common, Part Three*

Someone objects: "That Lao Peng exists among men is like the pine and cypress among trees—both are endowed by nature. How can this be learned?"

The *Baopuzi* replies: "Of all things shaped by the potter’s art and the transformations of creation, none is more numinous than man. Those who grasp its surface can command the myriad things; those who penetrate its depths can attain long life and enduring vision. Knowing that the supreme medicines extend years, they ingest those medicines to seek immortality. Knowing that cranes and tortoises enjoy remote longevity, they emulate their guiding and pulling to increase their years. Now, the pine and cypress differ from other trees in their branches and leaves, and the crane and tortoise differ from other creatures in their form and appearance. Yet Lao Peng remains but a man—no different in kind—yet his life alone is long. This is due to attaining the Dao, not to nature. Other trees cannot imitate the pine and cypress, and other creatures cannot learn from the crane and tortoise; thus, they are short-lived and perish. If a man possesses wisdom and can cultivate the Dao of Lao Peng, he may achieve the same merit.

If one claims there are no immortals in the world, then consider this: the records of former sages list nearly a thousand, each with surname and given name, each with deeds and origins—these are no empty words. If one claims they were all uniquely endowed with exceptional qi, then know that their transmission all involved teachers and the ingestion of medicines; it was not inborn knowledge. If the arts of the Dao cannot be learned, then how does one account for the transformations—swallowing swords, spitting fire, sitting yet vanishing, standing yet disappearing, summoning clouds, raising mists, calling forth insects and snakes, assembling fish and turtles, instantly turning thirty-six stones into water, dissolving jade into paste, liquefying gold into broth, entering the depths without drowning, approaching blades without injury? The arts of illusion number over nine hundred, and when tested and practiced, none fail to take effect. Why, then, refuse to believe that immortality can be attained?

The Dao of immortality is slow to mature and entails many prohibitions. Without transcendent aspirations and steadfast resolve, one cannot uphold it. Some may harbor slight interest but waver in doubt, abandoning the path midway, and thus conclude that the Dao of immortality and long life are truly unattainable. The *Scriptures of the Immortals* say: 'Ingest the elixir, guard the One, and you shall unite with heaven. Return the essence, embrace the embryo, and your life shall be without limit.' These are the essential words of the supreme Dao.

Even among the gentlemen of the common folk, there are those who inwardly do not betray their hearts, outwardly do not shame their shadows, above do not deceive heaven, and below do not break their word. How much more so for the true persons of antiquity? Would they fabricate empty texts to deceive future generations with matters that are certainly unattainable? If one lacks the destiny for it, they will never believe—how can they be forced to do so?

Someone objects: "The long life of cranes and tortoises is but an empty saying of the world. Who has accompanied these creatures from beginning to end to know this?"

The *Baopuzi* replies: "If one grasps the essentials, then what lies beyond the eight directions is as clear as the palm of one’s hand, and the events of a hundred generations past are as if occurring in the same moment. One need not wait for them to be in the courtyard or within sight to know them."

The *Yufang Ji* states: "The thousand-year-old tortoise displays all five colors, and the two bones atop its head rise like horns, floating above lotus leaves or beneath clusters of milfoil. At times, white clouds coil and swirl above it. The thousand-year-old crane cries in accordance with the seasons and can perch upon trees—those not yet a thousand years old will never alight upon branches. Their plumage is pure white, and their brains have turned entirely vermilion; thus, upon seeing them, one may know their age at once. Yet creatures that have grown old are often wise, and most conceal themselves in distant, secluded places, so few people ever encounter them.

According to the *Yufang Ji* and the *Changyu Jing*, not only these two creatures possess such longevity. It is said that the thousand-year-old pine tree sprouts branches on all four sides, while its crown ceases to grow, appearing from a distance like an inverted canopy. Within it, one may find beings resembling green oxen, green sheep, green dogs, or green humans—all of which live for a thousand years. It is further said that serpents possess boundless longevity; macaques live eight hundred years before transforming into apes, and apes live five hundred years before becoming *jue*. The toad lives three thousand years, the qilin two thousand, and the *tenghuang* horse and *jiguang* beast each live three thousand years. The thousand-year bird and ten-thousand-year fowl both have human faces and avian bodies, their lifespans matching their names. Tigers, deer, and hares all live a thousand years; when they reach five hundred, their fur turns white, and those that live five hundred years gain the power of transformation. Foxes, jackals, and wolves live eight hundred years; at five hundred, they skillfully assume human form. Mice live three hundred years; at a hundred, their fur turns white, and they gain the ability to lean upon humans and divine, known as *Zhong*—able to foretell auspicious and inauspicious events for the year and matters a thousand *li* away. Such examples cannot all be recorded here, but those of broad learning can name things upon encountering them, and those of extensive knowledge suffer no confusion in principle. Why must one constantly keep company with tortoises and cranes to know these things? If one fails to recognize creatures, even the plants, trees, birds, and beasts in one’s own garden or fields may remain unknown—how much more so for those beyond?"

How extraordinary indeed! The *Records of the Grand Historian*’s "Biography of *Xuan* and *Fang*" states that in the region between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, when villagers were children, they would prop up their beds with *xuan*—and even after death, their families would move the bed while the *xuan* remained alive, living thus for no fewer than fifty or sixty years. To go so long without eating or drinking and yet not die is a difference far beyond that of ordinary creatures—why then doubt those said to live a thousand years? Do not the immortals’ methods of emulating the *xuan*’s breath have their basis?

Thus, Chen Zhonggong of Yingchuan, the venerable scholar and Grand Administrator of Taiqiu, was a man of rigorous discourse. In his *Record of Strange Tales*, he wrote of a man from his commandery, Zhang Guangding, who during a time of chaos often took refuge in the wilderness. He had a daughter of four who could not walk long distances and could not be carried—calculating that abandoning her would surely lead to starvation, he did not wish her bones to be left exposed. At the edge of the village stood an ancient, massive tomb whose summit already bore a hole. He placed her in a vessel and lowered her into the tomb, leaving her with several months’ worth of dried rice and water before departing. When the world at last grew peaceful, three years later, Guangding returned to his hometown and wished to retrieve the bones of the daughter he had abandoned in the tomb to rebury them properly. When he went to look, the girl was still sitting in the tomb, and upon seeing her parents, she recognized them and rejoiced. Her parents, at first, feared she was a ghost. Drawing near, they realized she was not dead. When asked how she had obtained food, the girl said that when her provisions had first run out, she grew very hungry. Then she saw a creature at the corner of the tomb stretching its neck and swallowing *qi*. She tried imitating it and found she was no longer hungry. Days and months passed in this way until the present. The clothes and bedding her parents had left remained in the tomb, untouched and unspoiled, so she suffered no cold. Guangding then searched for the creature the girl had described and found it was merely a large *xuan*. When the girl first ate grain again, her stomach ached and she retched, but after some time, she grew accustomed to it. This further confirms that the *xuan* possesses a method of immortality, and those who practice the Dao may emulate it to attain the same longevity as the *xuan*.

Sima Qian and Zhonggong were not men of reckless speech. The creatures of the world—birds and beasts—are many indeed.

The ancients singled out these two creatures alone to illustrate that they possess qualities distinct from all others. Observing even one is enough to awaken understanding.

Someone may object: "The *xuan* can hibernate underground, and the crane can soar in the heavens. If one were to hibernate for but a moment or fly for an instant, one could not even match their longevity—how then could one learn from them?"

The *Baopuzi* replies: Many creatures can hibernate, and countless birds can fly. Yet only the *xuan* and the crane are cited for their longevity, for their immortality does not arise from hibernation or flight. Thus, the true adept need only emulate their *daoyin* to prolong life and follow their method of consuming *qi* to abstain from grain—without learning their underground hibernation or celestial flight. Those who attain the Dao can ascend to the clouds above or conceal themselves in the rivers and seas below. Thus, Xiao Shi soared with the phoenix through the void, and Qin Gao rode the crimson carp into the deep abyss—such are the proofs. How could this be mere momentary hibernation or fleeting flight?

Dragons, serpents, jiao, chi, monkeys, *ju*, *tuo*, and *li* can all fast through the winter yet grow plumper than when they feed. None have grasped their method. Moreover, many creatures surpass humans in singular virtues—not just the *xuan* and crane. Thus, Taihao learned to weave nets from the spider, Jintian observed the wild goose to regulate the seasons, Emperor Xuan awaited the phoenix’s song to tune the pitch pipes, Tang Yao studied the *mingjia* to mark the months’ end, Gui knew the past by watching the magpie, the Fish Earl discerned floods and droughts by *qi*, the mayfly recognized hidden springs, the white wolf foretold the rise of the Yin, and the *yuzhuo* heralded the Zhou’s prosperity. That the *xuan* and crane alone understand nurturing life is hardly strange.

Furthermore, the immortal scriptures teach hundreds of methods for abiding long in the world—only the pace and complexity vary. Not all need imitate the *xuan* and crane.

Someone may ask: "If one could truly attain immortality through learning, rising above the clouds and forsaking the world, abandoning ancestral rites—would the ancestors not know they go unfed?"

The *Baopuzi* replies: To preserve the body unharmed is called perfect filial piety—how much greater, then, to attain the Dao, achieve long life, and endure beyond heaven and earth, surpassing mere preservation of the body? If one could ascend the void, tread the radiant clouds, ride the rainbow canopy, feast on morning mist, drink the pure essence of *xuanhuang*, sip jade nectar and golden broth, eat crimson mushrooms and jade herbs, dwell in palaces of jasper and chambers of jade, and wander freely through the Great Purity—would the ancestors not share in this glory? One might then assist the Five Emperors, oversee the hundred spirits, attain rank without seeking it, savor celestial delicacies, command the forces of Fengdu, wield awe over the pillars of the earth. If one truly grasps the Dao and comprehends its wonders, who would go hungry?

The highest attainment in the Dao was none other than Boyang. Boyang had a son named Zong, who served as a general in Wei, rendered meritorious service, and was enfeoffed at Duangan. Thus, those who study immortality today all have descendants to continue ancestral sacrifices—why should they sever the line?

Someone may ask: "Those who attain the Dao master breath control and dietary arts, hear across a thousand *li* with covered ears, and see the future with closed eyes. Some ride dragons instead of fine steeds, abandon the Middle Kingdom for Penglai and Yingzhou, linger among the common folk, or wander freely among people—why do they not simply vanish into the void? Their aspirations are the same, yet their departures differ. Why?"

The *Baopuzi* replies: I have heard from my teachers that immortals may ascend to heaven or remain on earth—both paths lead to long life, and their choice of abode depends on personal preference. Moreover, the methods of consuming the elixir of returned cinnabar and golden liquor vary: if one wishes to remain in the world, one takes half the dose and sets the rest aside; if one later seeks to ascend to heaven, one consumes the remainder. Once the matter of immortality is settled, there is no fear of sudden demise. If one merely wishes to roam the earth or enter famous mountains, what cause for concern remains?

Pengzu said that heaven is filled with exalted officials and great spirits, while new immortals hold lowly positions with many duties—hence the toil is not worth serving in heaven, and they remain among people for over eight hundred years. He also said that some ancient immortals grew feathers and wings, transformed, and flew away, losing their human form to assume other shapes—like the sparrow becoming a clam or the pheasant turning into a *shen*—which is not the human way.

The human way is to eat rich foods, wear fine clothes, engage in yin and yang, hold office, and enjoy keen senses, strong bones, radiant complexion, and ageless vigor. To live long, sit where one pleases, and remain untouched by cold, heat, wind, or damp, unharmed by malevolent spirits or baleful *qi*, unscathed by weapons or poisons, and unaffected by sorrow, joy, slander, or praise—this is true nobility. To abandon wife and children, dwell alone in the mountains and marshes, cut off from human affairs, and live like a stone among trees is not worthy of praise.

In the past, Master Anqi, Lord Longmei, Ning, and Yang Yin all achieved long life by consuming half a dose of golden liquor. They remained in the world for nearly a thousand years before departing. To speak earnestly, those who seek long life simply cherish what they desire today.

Those who seek the Dao are not eager to ascend to emptiness or take flight as if it were superior to remaining on earth. If one is fortunate enough to stay at home and not die, why must one hasten to ascend to heaven? If attaining immortality means no longer attending to worldly affairs, it is but a single matter. The words of Peng Zu were merely accommodating to human sentiment.

Some say: "We people of today do not understand the principles of long life—how did the ancients alone come to know them?" The *Baopuzi* replies: This is the narrow talk of the ignorant and benighted, not the concern of those of broad understanding. The lofty scholar’s thoughts reach far and wide, naturally profound and unobstructed, yet it is difficult to infer the distant concerns of divine beings from the shallow sentiments of the vulgar. Now, as with the methods of astrologers—[text missing]—they pace the waxing and waning of the Seven Governors, discuss past transgressions and encroachments, examine rise and decline in what is to come, gaze upward to discern the omens of clouds and celestial phenomena, and look downward to determine the auspiciousness or inauspiciousness of terrestrial signs. They manipulate the Three Divination Sticks to determine the success or failure of military campaigns, apply the Nine Talismans to foretell the fortunes and misfortunes of regions, and through a single calculation of addition and subtraction, fathom the conditions of spirits and gods. They interweave the Six Emotions to assess the boundless good and ill—such principles have roots that can be investigated, and their patterns can be sought. Yet even those of mediocre talent and limited capacity cannot master them, instead exhausting their sharp minds on dregs, unable to plumb their profound subtleties.

Consider the crude craft of carving tenons and mortises—even Wheelwright Bian possessed an untransmittable marvel. Or the humble skill of catching cicadas—yet the hunchbacked old man achieved a mastery bordering on the divine. Such excellence lies in the person’s utmost refinement. How much more so with the Way of immortality, whose subtleties run deep and whose roots are not easily grasped? Even the likes of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao, though they attained its effects, may not have fully understood its underlying principles—how much less so ordinary people? Yet its methods can be learned, and so the ancients recorded and transmitted them for those of discernment.

If one’s mind comprehends and intention aligns, one may trust and cultivate it. But if doubt lingers in the heart, it is merely because one’s fate is not meant to be. Why question why the ancients alone understood this while you alone do not? Indeed, I now know that immortality can be attained. I can cease taking grain and abstain from food. I can preserve the Flowing Pearl and take flight.

The pursuit of alchemical gold and silver can be achieved, yet if you demand of me their fundamental principles, I must confess I truly do not know them. If the world insists that whatever cannot be grasped by thought must not exist, then few things in this world would remain. Thus, Laozi spoke of using a cat’s head to cure rat bites and a woodpecker’s beak to prevent tooth decay—these too are methods one may seek. Yet the crab’s transformation into lacquer or hemp’s decay into wine cannot be deduced by reason. With myriad phenomena so diverse, how can the mind fathom them all?

Suppose one suffers from a grave illness and requires potent medicine but refuses to take it until understanding why Shennong and Qibo chose this herb for this ailment—would they not perish? Some say life and death are fated, longevity predetermined, and no medicine can alter them. Once a finger is severed, reattaching it is impossible; once blood is spilled, swallowing it brings no benefit. How much less could consuming the strange elixirs of pine and cypress extend one’s fleeting years? This is far from the truth.

The *Baopuzi* states: If such arguments held, then only identical substances could bring benefit. Yet a severed finger and spilled blood were once part of the same body—why, then, can the one not be reattached and the other not be ingested? I have witnessed people use snake-oil salve to reconnect severed fingers and swap a chicken’s foot for a duck’s with beans—such benefits from strange substances cannot be denied. If you claim no reliance on external things, then you should pound flesh to mend bones for sword wounds or boil skin and hair to cure baldness. Yet water and soil, though not of the same substance as plants, sustain their growth; the five grains, though not born of humans, are essential to life. Fat is not fire’s kind, nor is water the fish’s kin, yet when fat is exhausted, fire dies, and when water dries, fish perish. Cut down a tree, and the mistletoe withers; mow the grass, and dodder wilts. When river crabs do not return, oysters decay; when mulberry trees are felled, borers perish. From these, one may grasp the truth.

Gold and jade placed in the nine orifices preserve the dead from decay; salt brine applied to flesh and marrow keeps dried meats from rotting. How much more so when substances that nourish the body and extend life are taken into oneself—why marvel that they grant longevity?

Some object: The formulas in books on immortality seem plausible but are likely fabrications by meddlesome enthusiasts, not teachings from the hands of the Yellow Emperor or Laozi, nor witnessed by Master Red Pine or Wang Qiao. The *Baopuzi* replies: If such were the case, they would not prove effective. Yet even minor techniques never fail. I have seen people use a *fangzhu* vessel to draw water from the evening moon, a burning mirror to kindle fire from the morning sun, dissolve forms into nothingness, alter appearances into strange beings, toss a headscarf to the ground and make it run like a hare, or stitch a red sash and make it slither like a snake. Fruits ripen in an instant, fish and dragons leap in basins—all as described. If such arts exist, how can the Way of long life be false?

The *Records of the Grand Historian* and *Book of Han* recount how Luan Da first met Emperor Wu by making chess pieces move and collide on their own, while the *Book of Later Han* records Wei Shang’s ability to vanish while sitting and reappear while standing, and Zhang Kai’s power to summon clouds and raise mists—all attested by reliable historians. These arts belong to the realm of immortals; their authenticity cannot be denied. If the *Records* are trustworthy, why should the Way of long life be any different?

Someone asks: Should those who seek the Dao first establish merit and virtue? Is this correct? The *Baopuzi* answers: Indeed. According to the middle chapter of the *Jade Bell Classic*, the highest merit lies in saving others from peril and sparing them from disaster, followed by curing illness to prevent unjust death. Those who seek immortality must take loyalty, filial piety, harmony, benevolence, and trust as their foundation. Without cultivating virtue but merely pursuing the mysterious Dao, it is of no benefit.

The gods who oversee destiny observe human transgressions. For major wrongdoings, the Director of Destiny seizes a *ji* (twelve-year cycle); for minor faults, it seizes a *suan* (one-year cycle), the severity determining the amount taken. A person’s lifespan is predetermined: those endowed with abundant destiny find their cycles difficult to exhaust and die late, while those with meager endowment who commit many offenses see their cycles swiftly depleted and die early.

It is also said: To become an earthly immortal, one must perform three hundred good deeds; to become a heavenly immortal, one thousand two hundred. If one has performed one thousand one hundred and ninety-nine good deeds but suddenly commits a single evil act, all previous merits are lost, and the count must begin anew. Thus, goodness need not be great, nor evil slight. Even if one commits no evil, merely speaking of past deeds or demanding repayment for charity nullifies that single good act—though not all merits are lost.

Moreover, if one’s accumulated good deeds are incomplete, even taking immortality elixirs is of no use. If one neither takes elixirs nor performs good deeds, though one may not attain immortality, one can at least avoid sudden death. I suspect that even Peng Zu and his kind lacked sufficient merit, which is why they could not ascend to heaven.

**On the Golden Elixir**
The *Baopuzi* states: I have examined books on nurturing life and collected methods for prolonging existence, having perused thousands of scrolls. None fail to regard the Reverted Elixir and Golden Liquid as the ultimate essentials. Indeed, these two are the pinnacle of the immortal’s path. If consuming them does not lead to immortality, then no immortals have ever existed.

In former times, when the central states fell into chaos, none did not scatter and flee in all directions. I wandered through the regions of Xu, Yu, Jing, Xiang, Jiang, and Guang, traversing several provinces, and encountered hundreds of wandering Daoist practitioners. Some I had long heard of, their names as distant as clouds and sun, yet they were all alike in their resemblance. Their knowledge and insights, whether profound or shallow, were insufficient to surpass one another. Though each possessed dozens of scrolls, they could not fully comprehend them—merely copying errors from one another. At times, some knew methods for circulating *qi* or abstaining from grains, or techniques for consuming various herbs and woods, and their manuals were roughly uniform in content. Yet none lacked the *Daoji Jing*, which they regarded as the utmost secret, claiming it was composed by Yin Xi. I told them: "This was written by Wang Tu, a military supervisor of the Wei dynasty—it is not the work of an ancient." Wang Tu, ignorant of the great elixir, sought immortality through *qi*-circulation and chamber practices, composing the *Daoji Jing* under the delusion that the Dao was fully encompassed therein. This is a grave misguidance of others.

I occasionally questioned these Daoists about matters of divine elixirs, golden liquids, the *Sanhuang Wen* for summoning celestial and terrestrial spirits, yet not one among them knew of them. Most boasted and praised themselves, deceiving others by claiming long lifespans or past travels with immortals. Those whose claims could be fully verified were exceedingly few. Some had vaguely heard of the golden elixir but insisted it could no longer be obtained, asserting that only immortals of the distant past had mastered it. Others possessed fragments of esoteric teachings but lacked the true scriptures, or held miscellaneous elixir formulas, believing these exhausted the methods of alchemy.

In the past, Zuo Yuanfang of Tianzhushan concentrated his thoughts, and a divine being bestowed upon him the *Jindan Xianjing*. Fleeing the chaos of the Han’s end, he had no time to compound the elixir and instead crossed the river to Jiangdong, intending to seek a renowned mountain to cultivate this Way. My great-uncle, the Immortal Master, received the teachings from Yuanfang, including the *Taiqing Danjing* in three scrolls, the *Jiuding Danjing* in one scroll, and the *Jinye Danjing* in one scroll. My teacher, Master Zheng, was a disciple of my great-uncle, the Immortal Master, and from him I also received these texts. As my family was poor and unable to purchase the ingredients, I personally served him, sweeping and attending for many years, until at last I established an altar on Maji Mountain, took vows, and received the transmission, including all the oral instructions not recorded in writing. These texts were previously unknown in Jiangdong; they originated with Zuo Yuanfang, who transmitted them to my great-uncle, who passed them to Master Zheng, who in turn bestowed them upon me. Thus, no other Daoists knew of them.

Yet I have received these teachings for over twenty years now, possessing no wealth—no grain, no coin—to pursue them. I can only sigh in vain. Those who hoard gold filling chests or amass fortunes like mountains remain ignorant of this deathless method. Even if they were to hear of it, not one in ten thousand would believe. Just as one who drinks jade nectar finds common broth insipid, or one who gazes upon Kunlun finds hills and mounds base, so too does one who beholds the Way of the golden elixir lose all desire to regard lesser manuals. Yet the great elixir is ultimately difficult to obtain, and one must for now rely on minor medicines to sustain oneself. Though consuming other medicines by the bushel may yield slight benefits, they can never grant true longevity.

Thus, the oral instructions of Laozi say: "Without obtaining the Reverted Elixir or Golden Liquid, you labor in vain." Even the five grains sustain life—one who obtains them lives, while one deprived of them dies. How much more so the divine medicines of the highest grade? Their benefits surpass the five grains ten thousandfold. The golden elixir, when refined, grows ever more wondrous with time. Gold, cast into fire a hundred times, does not melt; buried, it does not decay through the ages. Consuming these two medicines refines the body, enabling one to avoid aging and death. This is akin to borrowing external substances to fortify oneself—like fat nourishing a flame to keep it from extinguishing, or verdigris coating wood to prevent rot when submerged. Yet the golden elixir, entering the body and permeating the meridians and vessels, far surpasses such external applications.

Most in the world do not believe in the supreme Way, and such skeptics are everywhere. Yet if by chance there arises one who is earnestly devoted but never encounters this method or meets a renowned teacher, they will never learn of this wondrous matter in the world. I now briefly outline the essentials of the golden elixir to share with those of like aspiration. They must diligently seek it and not cling to shallow, common formulas, believing these sufficient to transcend the world. Those who fail to encounter it should instead devote themselves wholeheartedly to the boundless marvels. Upon hearing its teachings, they will surely recognize how one emerges from stagnant puddles to float upon the vast sea, turns from fireflies to face the sun and moon, perceives the crudeness of cloth drums beside thunder, or grasps the insignificance of minnows beside the great whale. Once they understand the futility of their former pursuits, how can they persist in seeking ascent through inferior medicines? It would be no different from chasing the swift wind on a lame donkey or crossing a great river in a wicker boat.

There are many minor elixir formulas, but their effects vary in depth and potency, with no comparison between the superior and inferior—just as a single brew of wine cannot rival the richness of nine fermentations. Yet even the lesser elixirs far surpass the finest herbs and woods. All common herbs and woods turn to ash when burned, but cinnabar, when refined, becomes mercury, which upon further transformation reverts to cinnabar—its distance from ordinary plants and trees is vast. Only the divine immortals perceive this principle. How immeasurably distant are they from the common folk?

People of the world, knowing little, find much strange. Some, unaware that mercury derives from cinnabar, refuse to believe it, asking: "Cinnabar is red—how can it become this white substance?" Others say: "Cinnabar is a stone. When other stones are burned, they turn to ash—why does cinnabar alone not burn to cinders?" If such simple matters remain incomprehensible, is it any wonder they laugh at the Way of immortality? The true persons of antiquity, pitying those of later ages who might be taught, devised methods in intricate detail, wishing to deliver them from the calamity of death. Their words were most profound, yet the common people persist in disbelief, dismissing them as empty rhetoric. If these were empty words, how could the nine transformations and nine changes, completed in precise days as described, come to pass? The true persons’ understanding of this cannot be sought through ordinary, shallow thinking.

From my youth, I loved the arts of the Dao, traveling on foot to seek instruction, unafraid of peril or distance. Every unusual teaching I heard brought me joy, and though I faced ridicule, I did not grieve.

Those who know the future will not surpass the present—this is why I have written this to show the discerning. How could I merely esteem the strange and embellish empty words, wishing only to circulate books in the world and win the trust of the vulgar? When flourishing yang cannot revive withered wood, and the highest wisdom cannot transform the lowest ignorance, books are transmitted for the enlightened to read, and affairs are valued by the wise to know. If a farmer were given a vermilion bow to scare birds, or a southern barbarian a court robe to gather firewood, how could those who do not understand be forced to comprehend?

The people of this world, sated with food all day, may not even apply themselves to the studies of the Confucians and Mohists or cultivate the work of advancing virtue. Instead, they idle away their years in carefree wandering, pursuing only what brings honor or profit. Some chase birds and hunt beasts across the plains, some linger over cups in bustling markets, some drown in music and silk, some exhaust their strength in riding and archery, some squander their efforts in gambling. When they hear the words of the supreme Way, they act as if drunk; when they see the discourse on the great Dao, they yawn and doze. They neglect the cultivation of their bodies, hastening toward death, yet refuse to seek the methods of nurturing life. They willingly subject themselves to the torments of cutting, boiling, emaciation, and exhaustion. But those who possess the Way treasure and guard their knowledge, asking nothing of others—how could they be willing to force their teachings upon them?

The common saying goes that if long life were attainable, the wealthy and noble of antiquity would have already obtained it, and since none did, such a Way does not exist. Yet they do not realize that the wealthy and noble of old were no different from those of today—all disbelieved and did not seek it. If there truly were an immortal Way in the world, would it not again be mocked by those who attain it? The sun and moon cannot illuminate everything; how can the human heart alone be trusted?

The *Baopuzi* states: According to the *Huangdi jiuding shendan jing* (Scripture of the Nine Cauldrons’ Divine Elixirs of the Yellow Emperor), the Yellow Emperor consumed them and thus ascended as an immortal. It also says that while breathing exercises, guiding and pulling, and consuming herbal medicines may extend life, they cannot prevent death. Ingesting divine elixirs grants boundless longevity, allowing one to endure with heaven and earth, ride clouds, and mount dragons, ascending and descending the Great Clarity. The Yellow Emperor transmitted this to Master Xuanzhi, warning him: "This Way is most weighty; it must be entrusted only to the worthy. If one is unfit, even if their jade were piled as high as a mountain, do not reveal this Way to them." The recipient must cast a golden figurine and golden fish into the eastern flowing waters as a pact, swearing a blood oath. Without the bone of immortality, one cannot behold this Way.

To compound the elixir, one must go to a famous mountain, a place without people, with no more than three companions. First, fast for a hundred days, bathe in the five fragrant waters, and maintain utmost purity. Avoid defilement and association with the vulgar, and do not let those who disbelieve in the Way know of it. If they slander the divine medicine, the elixir will not form. Once completed, it can make an entire household immortal, not just oneself.

The people of this world do not compound divine elixirs but instead trust in herbal medicines. Yet herbs and plants rot when buried and burn to ash when burned—they cannot preserve themselves, so how can they preserve humans? The nine elixirs are the essence of long life, not something ordinary people should hear or see. The teeming masses, foolish and ignorant, know only to covet wealth and honor—are they not merely walking corpses?

When compounding the elixirs, one must perform sacrifices according to the illustrated methods in a separate scroll. The first elixir is called *Danhua* (Cinnabar Splendor). First, refine *xuanhuang* (mysterious yellow), using realgar water, *bin* stone water, a bowl of mercury, halite, brine, *bin* stone, oyster shell, red clay, talc, and lead powder, each in quantities of several dozen catties. Seal with *liuyi* mud and fire for thirty-six days. Consuming it for seven days grants immortality. It can also be formed into *xuangao* (mysterious paste) pills. Placing this elixir over a fierce fire briefly turns it into gold. Mixing 240 *zhu* of it with a hundred catties of mercury and firing it also produces gold. If the gold forms, the elixir is complete; if not, reseal the medicine and fire it again for the same number of days—it will invariably succeed.

The second elixir is called *Shendan* (Divine Elixir), also known as *Shenfu* (Divine Talisman). Consuming it for a hundred days grants immortality. One can walk on water by applying this elixir to the soles of the feet. Ingesting three *daogui* of it eliminates the Three Corpses, Nine Worms, and all illnesses.

The third elixir is called *Shendan* (Divine Elixir). Consuming one *daogui* for a hundred days grants immortality. Feeding it to livestock also renders them immortal. It repels weapons, and after a hundred days of consumption, immortals, jade maidens, and mountain and river spirits will attend you, appearing in human form.

The fourth elixir is called *Huandan* (Returning Elixir). Consuming one *daogui* for a hundred days grants immortality. Vermilion birds and phoenixes will hover above you, and jade maidens will approach. Mixing one *daogui* with a catty of mercury and firing it instantly produces gold. Applying this elixir to money or objects causes them to return the same day. Writing with this elixir on a mortal’s eyes causes all spirits to flee.

The fifth elixir is called *Erdan* (Nourishing Elixir). Consuming it for thirty days grants immortality. Spirits will attend you, and jade maidens will appear before you.

The sixth elixir is called *Liandan* (Refining Elixir). Consuming it for ten days grants immortality. Mixing it with mercury and firing it also produces gold.

The seventh elixir is called *Roudan* (Softening Elixir). Consuming one *daogui* for a hundred days grants immortality. Mixing it with the juice of *quepen* and consuming it allows even a ninety-year-old man to father children. Firing it with *jingong* (lead) instantly produces gold.

The eighth elixir is called *Fudan* (Subduing Elixir). Consuming it grants immortality the same day. Shaped like a jujube pit [text missing], it deters bandits, tigers, and wolves, who dare not approach.

The ninth elixir is called *Handan* (Cold Elixir). Consuming one *daogui* for a hundred days grants immortality. Immortal boys and girls will attend you, and you will be able to fly lightly without wings.

Of these nine elixirs, obtaining even one grants immortality; it is not necessary to compound all of them—it depends on one’s preference. Those who consume the nine elixirs may ascend to heaven if they wish, or remain among humans as they please. They can come and go freely, and none can harm them.

The *Baopuzi* states: There is also the *Taiqing shendan* (Great Clarity Divine Elixir), whose method originates from the Primordial Lord, the teacher of Laozi. The *Taiging guantian jing* (Great Clarity Scripture of Observing Heaven) has nine scrolls. The upper three cannot be taught; the middle three are unworthy of transmission in this world and should be sunk beneath the three springs. The lower three scrolls are precisely the elixir scriptures, comprising three volumes: upper, middle, and lower.

The Primordial Lord was a great immortal who could harmonize yin and yang, command spirits, summon wind and rain, and ride nine dragons and twelve white tigers. All the immortals under heaven practiced under him.

Those who have attained it still claim their achievement comes from studying the Dao and ingesting elixirs—not from natural endowment. How much less can ordinary people expect otherwise? The scriptures state: the superior practitioner who obtains the Dao ascends to become a celestial official; the middling practitioner who obtains the Dao dwells upon Kunlun; the inferior practitioner who obtains the Dao enjoys longevity in the world. Yet the ignorant masses do not believe, dismissing such teachings as empty words. From dawn to dusk, they engage only in actions that hasten death, never seeking life—how could Heaven force life upon them? Ordinary people know only fine food, fine clothing, sensual pleasures, and wealth, indulging their desires without restraint until they suddenly perish. Take care never to speak of divine elixirs to such people, lest they mock the Dao and slander the true transmission. If the elixir scriptures do not find their proper recipient, misfortune will surely befall the bearer.

If one encounters a person of sincere faith, one may share a portion of the completed elixir, but never lightly transmit the formula. What need has one who understands this Dao for kings and marquises? Once the divine elixir is complete, it not only grants longevity but can also be used to create yellow gold. When the gold is made, take one hundred *jin* and first perform a grand offering—this ritual has its own separate method in one scroll, distinct from the Nine Cauldrons offering.

The offering should be apportioned as follows, with each portion labeled and recorded:
- Heaven: twenty *jin*
- Sun and Moon: five *jin* each
- Northern Dipper: eight *jin*
- Great Unity: eight *jin*
- Well: five *jin*
- Stove: five *jin*
- River Earl: twelve *jin*
- Earth Altar: five *jin*

To the Gate Spirits, Neighborhood Spirits, and Pure Lords, five *jin* each—altogether eighty-eight *jin*. The remaining twelve *jin* should be placed in a fine leather pouch. On an auspicious day, go to a bustling market, and at the height of its activity, silently cast it among the crowd before departing without looking back. Only when one has used more than one hundred *jin* may one freely employ the gold. If one does not first offer gold to the spirits, one will surely incur misfortune.

It is also said: The Dao of longevity does not lie in sacrifices to spirits, nor in guiding and pulling or bending and stretching. The essence of ascending as an immortal lies in the divine elixir. To know this is not easy; to practice it is truly difficult. If you can refine it, you may attain enduring existence.

In recent times, during the late Han, Lord Yin of Xinye refined this Supreme Clarity Elixir and achieved immortality. He was originally a scholar, gifted in thought and skilled in composing poetry, as well as in writing eulogies and prefaces for elixir scriptures. He recorded the beginnings of his Daoist studies, his reception of his teacher’s teachings, and all he knew of those who had attained immortality—over forty individuals—with great clarity.

Refining this Supreme Clarity Elixir is somewhat more difficult than the Nine Cauldrons, yet it is the method for ascending to heaven in broad daylight. When compounding it, one must first prepare the Flower Pool, Red Salt, Gen Snow, Mysterious White, and Flying Talisman, as well as the Three-and-Five Spirit Water, before kindling the fire.

The divine elixir, once transmuted, may be ingested; after three years, one will attain immortality.

The two-transmutation elixir, when ingested, grants immortality in two years. The three-transmutation elixir, in one year. The four-transmutation elixir, in half a year. The five-transmutation elixir, in a hundred days. The six-transmutation elixir, in forty days. The seven-transmutation elixir, in twenty days. The eight-transmutation elixir, in ten days. The nine-transmutation elixir, in three days.

If one takes the nine-transmutation elixir and places it within the divine crucible after the Summer Solstice, firing it, the crucible’s lid will suddenly blaze with radiant, five-colored divine light—this is the transmutation into the Return Elixir. Ingesting even a knife-tip’s measure will cause one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight.

As for the nine-transmutation elixir, when sealed and coated within an earthen cauldron, fired first with gentle heat and then with strong, each transmutation—from the first to the ninth—varies in duration and quantity. From this, one may discern: the fewer the transmutations, the longer the time required, for the elixir’s power is insufficient, thus necessitating more time for ingestion and delaying immortality. The greater the transmutations, the more potent the elixir’s power, thus requiring less time for ingestion and hastening immortality.

There is also the Nine Radiance Elixir, differing in method from the nine-transmutation elixir yet largely similar. Its preparation involves combining various ingredients and firing them to transmute the Five Stones—the Five Stones being cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, malachite, and magnetite. Each stone, when transmuted, yields five colors, resulting in twenty-five hues from the Five Stones. Each is weighed in taels and stored in separate vessels.

To revive one who has died within three days, take a knife-tip’s measure of the green elixir, mix it with water, and bathe the deceased. Then place another knife-tip’s measure into their mouth, and they will immediately revive.

To summon provisions, take the black elixir, mix it with water, and apply it to your left hand. Whatever you desire or speak of will manifest, allowing you to summon all things under heaven.

To conceal your form, foreknow future events, or attain ageless longevity, ingest a knife-tip’s measure of the yellow elixir, and you will immediately achieve immortality and eternal youth. You will also be able to perceive events thousands of miles away, knowing fortune and misfortune as if they were before your eyes. You will comprehend the destined prosperity, decline, lifespan, and fate—wealth or poverty—of all people. These methods are all detailed in the middle volume of the *Supreme Clarity Scripture*.

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* states: There is also the *Scripture of the Divine Elixir* in one scroll, containing five methods. It employs cinnabar, realgar, orpiment, sulfur, malachite, orpiment, magnetite, halite, *taiyi* (Grand Unity) *yuyuliang* (limonite), as well as Six-One Mud and the divine chamber. After performing rituals and offerings, the elixir is compounded in thirty-six days. It also uses the Five Emperors’ Talismans, inscribed in five colors, which grant immortality, though they are not as potent as the Supreme Clarity or Nine Cauldrons elixirs.

There is also the Min Mountains Elixir method, obtained by the Daoist Zhang Gai through deep meditation in a stone chamber on Mount Min. Its method involves smelting yellow copper to create a *fangzhu* (square vessel) to collect moonlight, covering it with mercury to capture the essence of the sun’s fire. Long-term ingestion grants immortality. If this elixir is placed in a bronze vessel with realgar, covered, and exposed to the sun for twenty days, then refined and ingested with well-flower water in the size of a small bean, the blind will regain sight, the ill will recover, white hair will turn black, and fallen teeth will regrow.

The Wuchengzi Elixir method uses *basha* (mercury ore) and mercury placed in an eight-inch copper plate, set over a charcoal-filled earthen furnace with three sides dug out. The plate is covered, and sulfur water is poured over it to maintain a mud-like consistency. After a hundred days of ingestion, one attains immortality.

The Xianmenzi Elixir method mixes three *sheng* of wine with one *jin* of elixir, exposing it to the sun for forty days. Ingesting it for a day dispels the Three Corpses and all illnesses; after three years, the Dao of immortality is achieved, and two jade maidens will attend you, ready to be commanded and to summon provisions. This elixir can also suppress malevolent spirits, ward off the baleful influences of the four directions, and protect against the misfortunes of the dead or construction disturbances. Hang it facing the afflicted area to avert harm.

There is also the Instant Elixir, which has nine variations resembling the Nine Cauldrons but is less potent. Its essential method, according to another source, involves taking orpiment and realgar, burning them, and casting the residue into a copper vessel. This vessel is then inverted over three-year-old pure bitter wine for a hundred days, during which red stalactites, several *fen* long and sometimes five-colored like *langgan* jade, form. These are buried and ingested, granting longevity. They can also be mixed with *tusi* (dodder), the root of its initial growth, which resembles *cong* (scallion). Extract its sap and blend it with this elixir; ingestion allows instantaneous transformations at will.

Alternatively, mix it with *zhucao* (vermilion grass), which resembles a small date tree, growing three to four *chi* tall with red branches and leaves. Its stem is like coral, thriving in famous mountains beneath cliffs. When cut, its sap flows like blood. Jade, the Eight Stones, gold, or silver placed within it can be shaped like clay; over time, it becomes liquid. Gold added to it is called *yuli* (jade nectar), and ingestion grants longevity.

There is also the Subduing Elixir method, which states that among the world’s waters, those named after elixirs—such as the Dan River in Nanyang—contain elixir fish. Ten days before the Summer Solstice, observe them at night: the elixir fish will float near the water’s edge, their red glow illuminating the surface like fire. Capture them, but do not take all, even if many are caught. Smear their blood on the soles of your feet to walk upon water and dwell indefinitely in the depths.

The Red Pine Master’s Elixir method involves taking the sap of thousand-year-old *lü* (creeping fig) and *lin* peach, soaking the elixir in a non-leaking vessel, sealing it, and burying it three *chi* underground for a hundred days. Then, squeeze the juice from the red fruit of the *ning* tree, mix it with the elixir, and ingest it to turn one’s face and eyes red, granting longevity. Was not the Red Child of the Central Yellow Immortal one who ingested this?

The Stone Master’s Elixir method takes fledgling birds before their feathers grow, feeds them cinnabar mixed with beef, and when their feathers turn red, slaughters them. After drying them in the shade along with their feathers, grind them into powder. Ingesting a knife-tip’s measure grants a lifespan of five hundred years.

The Kang Fengzi Elixir method uses sheep, crow, crane eggs, and sparrow blood, mixed with the juice of *shaoshi tianxiong* (aconite from Shaoshi Mountain), formed into pills, and placed inside a pigeon egg. This is then sealed in mica water for a hundred days, transforming into a red liquid. Ingesting one *ge* extends life by a hundred years; one *sheng* grants a thousand years.

The Cui Wenzi Elixir method involves placing elixir inside a duck’s belly and steaming it. Ingestion extends lifespan, and long-term use grants immortality.

The Liu Yuan Elixir method involves placing cinnabar in *xuanshui* (mysterious water) for a hundred days until it turns purple and can be held without staining the hands. Mixed with mica water, sealed in a tube, and submerged in a well for a hundred days, it transforms into a red liquid. Ingesting one *ge* grants a hundred years of life; long-term use grants immortality.

The Le Zichang Elixir method involves steaming *zengqing* (azurite) with lead in cinnabar for eighty days. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean for three years grants immortality.

The Li Wen Elixir method involves wrapping cinnabar in white silk and boiling it in bamboo sap, naming it the "Crimson Spring Elixir." Steamed over floating water and mixed with *xuanshui* (mysterious water), ingesting one *ge* daily for a year grants immortality.

The Yin Zi Elixir method involves mixing cinnabar with mica water, sealing it tightly, and placing it in the Golden Flower Pool for a year. Upon retrieval, ingesting one *daokui* (scant measure) until a full *jin* is consumed grants five hundred years of life.

The Taiyi Zhao Fangbi Elixir method employs the Five Minerals and seals them with Six-One Mud, resembling the Nine Elixirs. It excels at reviving those who have died suddenly within three days: place one pill in the mouth of the deceased, and another mixed with sulfur, both washed down with water to reach the throat, and they will revive immediately. It is said that messengers bearing tallies will come to summon them.

The Cai Nü Elixir method involves mixing cinnabar with rabbit blood and *qi* (malt), steaming it for a hundred days. Ingesting a pill the size of a *wutong* seed, one large dose thrice daily, will summon two divine maidens to attend and serve after a hundred days.

The Ji Qiu Zi Elixir method involves mixing pure sesame oil, Hundred-Flower Wine, Dragon Ointment, and sealing it with Six-One Mud, then simmering it with chaff fire for ten days. Ingesting a pill the size of a small bean until the entire dose is consumed grants five hundred years of life.

The Mo Zi Elixir method involves heating mercury and the Five Minerals’ liquid in a copper vessel, stirring with an arsenic spatula for ten days until it reverts to cinnabar. Ingesting one *daokui* cures all illnesses; long-term use grants immortality.

The Zhang Zihe Elixir method involves sealing *qi* (malt), mercury, *zengqing* (azurite), and water together, steaming them in red millet for eighty days. Mixed with jujube paste into pills and ingested in doses the size of a large bean for a hundred days, it grants five hundred years of life.

The Qi Li Elixir method first sublimes the Five Minerals to obtain "jade dust," then combines it with cinnabar and mercury in a large copper vessel, boiling it for a hundred days. Ingesting it grants immortality. Using a hundred *jin* of lead and a hundred *daokui* of the elixir, refining them with fire produces silver. Mixing with realgar water and firing for a hundred days yields gold. If the gold is too hard, boil it in lard; if too soft, boil it in white plum.

The Yu Gui Elixir method involves mixing cinnabar with Hua Chi (Flower Pool) liquid, covering it with powdered *zengqing* (azurite) and sulfur, layering it in a bamboo tube, and steaming it in sand for fifty days. Ingesting it for a hundred days summons jade maidens, the Six Jia and Six Ding spirits, to attend and serve, granting knowledge of all affairs under heaven.

The Zhouhou Elixir method involves mixing cinnabar with Golden Flower, sealing it in a dry tile, and steaming it for eighty days. Taking a dose the size of a small bean and placing it on a plate to face the sun, its light connects with the sun. Ingesting it in such doses grants longevity. When the elixir is cast into molten realgar copper, it transforms into gold.

The Li Gong Elixir method uses true cinnabar and the liquids of the Five Minerals, each one *sheng*, mixed to a mud-like consistency and fired in a cauldron for thirty-six days. Upon retrieval, it is mixed with liquid stone sulfur. Ingesting it for ten years harmonizes one’s lifespan with heaven and earth.

The Liu Sheng Elixir method involves mixing chrysanthemum sap, *dichu* (earth paper mulberry) sap, and *chu* (ailanthus) sap with cinnabar, steaming it for thirty days. After grinding and combining, ingesting it for a year grants five hundred years of life. Old men who ingest it become youthful and unrecognizable; youths remain ageless.

The Wang Jun Elixir method involves placing *basha* (realgar) and mercury inside a chicken egg, sealing it, and having a hen incubate three eggs on a *wangxiang* (auspicious) day. Ingesting it halts aging; children who ingest it cease growing. When fed to newborn chicks and puppies, they no longer grow; the same applies to birds and beasts—this has been verified.

The Chen Sheng Elixir method involves mixing white *qi* (malt) with cinnabar, sealing it in a copper vessel, and submerging it in a well for a full year. Ingesting it eliminates hunger for years; consuming a full *jin* grants a hundred years of life.

The Han Zhong Elixir method involves simmering cinnabar with lacquered *qi* (malt) and ingesting it to extend lifespan and preserve vision. Standing in the sun, one casts no shadow. Beyond this, there are dozens more methods that cannot all be enumerated.

The *Baopuzi* states: The Golden Liquid is what the Great One ingested to attain immortality, second only to the Nine Elixirs. Its preparation requires an ancient scale, one *jin* of gold, along with *xuanming* (mysterious brightness), Dragon Ointment, Taiyi Xunshou Stone, Ice Stone, Purple Wandering Maiden, *xuanshui* (mysterious water), liquid gold-transforming stone, and cinnabar. Sealed for a hundred days, it transforms into a liquid.

The *True Scripture* states: When the Golden Liquid enters the mouth, the body turns golden. Laozi transmitted it to the Primordial Lord, who said, "This Dao is most profound, emerging but once in a hundred generations. It must be concealed in a stone chamber. Its preparation requires a hundred days of purification, during which one must not associate with the vulgar. It should be refined beside a famous mountain by an eastward-flowing stream in a separate purified chamber. After a hundred days, ingesting one *liang* grants immortality. If one does not yet wish to depart the world but desires to become an Earth-Water Immortal, purify for a hundred days and ingest half a *liang* to attain agelessness, impervious to all harm and poisons. One may then keep a wife and children, hold office, and pursue desires without restriction. To ascend to heaven, purify and abstain from desires for a year, then ingest another *liang* to achieve flight."

The method of the Golden Liquid as the mighty and victorious elixir involves taking the Golden Liquid and mercury, combining and boiling them for thirty days. Upon retrieval, store it in a yellow clay jar, seal it with Six-One Mud, and fire it intensely for sixty hours until it transforms into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a small bean grants immortality. One *daokui* of this elixir can transmute a *jin* of mercury into silver. Taking a *jin* of this elixir, placing it over fire, and fanning it melts it into flowing red gold, called "Elixir Gold." Coating swords and blades with it repels weapons for ten thousand *li*. Using this Elixir Gold to make plates and bowls, and eating from them, grants longevity. Catching the liquid from the sun and moon with it is like obtaining water with a *fangzhu* (a legendary mirror). Drinking it grants immortality.

Refining the Golden Liquid with yellow earth in a Six-One Mud vessel over intense fire transmutes it entirely into gold for internal use. Further firing transforms it back into an elixir. Ingesting a dose the size of a bean allows one to enter famous mountains and great rivers as an Earth Immortal. One *daokui* of this elixir can instantly transmute mercury into silver; one *liang* of silver mixed with a *jin* of lead also becomes silver.

Following the *Golden Liquid Scripture*, cast eight *liang* of gold and silver into an eastward-flowing stream, swear an oath by drinking blood, and then receive the oral instructions. Those who steal the method and attempt to refine it without adhering to the original method will never succeed.

Only those of utmost sincerity may be given the elixir; its scripture must not be lightly transmitted, for both giver and receiver will suffer calamity. The celestial spirits observe mortals closely—this is unknown to most.

The *Baopuzi* states: The Nine Elixirs are indeed the supreme method of immortal medicines, yet their preparation requires many rare ingredients. If the four directions are unobstructed, these may be obtained in markets; if the nine regions are divided, the materials become unattainable.

Moreover, one must kindle the fire and tend it day and night for several dozen days, vigilantly attending to its intensity lest it deviate from the proper measure. The labor is arduous and exacting—far more so than the preparation of *Golden Liquid*, which is comparatively simple. The sole difficulty in compounding *Golden Liquid* lies in obtaining gold. By the ancient scale, one *jin* of gold now weighs two *jin*, and its cost seldom exceeds thirty thousand cash. The other ingredients required are somewhat easier to procure. Furthermore, no fire-tending is needed; one merely places the materials in the *Flower Pool* for a set number of days, and the elixir forms of itself. The total expense may reach forty thousand cash, yielding one dose sufficient for eight immortals. Yet if the ingredients are even slightly deficient, their *qi* will lack the potency to transform and coalesce—just as brewing wine from a few *sheng* of rice will never succeed.

The *Baopuzi* states: Next in efficacy is the method of ingesting refined gold. Though it does not equal *Golden Liquid*, it far surpasses all other medicines. Some methods involve refining gold with pig’s back fat and wine; others treat it with the bark of the *ailanthus* tree; still others dissolve it in *vitex* wine with magnetite. Some allow the gold to be drawn into threads like silk, while others instantly liquefy it for consumption. Each method has its prohibitions, though none are as stringent as those for *Golden Liquid*. Some combine realgar and orpiment with the gold, stretching and weaving it like leather—all methods for attaining earthly immortality. Silver and large pearls from mussels may also be transmuted into liquid and ingested, but these require long-term consumption without interruption, and thus still fall short of *Golden Liquid*.

The *Baopuzi* states: To compound *Golden Liquid* and the Nine Elixirs, one must expend wealth and withdraw into renowned mountains, far from human habitation. Thus, few can undertake it, and among thousands or tens of thousands, only one may chance upon the scripture. This is why most Daoist texts scarcely mention the *Golden Elixir*. The foremost prohibition is this: never allow skeptics who disbelieve in the Dao to slander or deride the process, for this ensures failure. Master Zheng explained that the reason lies in the necessity of offering sacrifices when compounding such great medicines. Upon sacrifice, the Supreme Unity Primordial Sovereign, Lord Lao, and the Mysterious Maiden all descend to oversee the alchemist. If one does not seclude oneself in a remote, hidden place, allowing vulgar and foolish people to witness the process, the celestial spirits will reproach the alchemist for failing to uphold the scriptural precepts. Once such people utter slander, the spirits withdraw their protection, allowing malevolent *qi* to intrude and the medicine to fail. One must enter a renowned mountain, observe a hundred days of purification, abstain from the five pungent vegetables and raw fish, and avoid contact with ordinary people—only then may one prepare the great medicine. Even after its completion, one must continue the purification, not merely at the outset.

Master Zheng said: Lord Lao warned that no minor mountain is suitable for compounding *Golden Liquid* or the divine elixirs. Lesser mountains lack true spirits to govern them and are instead inhabited by the essences of trees and stones, thousand-year-old creatures, and blood-consuming demons. These beings are all of perverse *qi*; they do not seek to benefit humanity but only to cause harm. A Daoist must employ arts to shield himself and his disciples, yet these entities may still spoil the medicine. Even today, physicians compounding fine medicines or salves avoid exposure to chickens, dogs, children, and women, for if such beings violate the process, the medicine loses its efficacy. If a dyer’s work is marred by an ill-omened gaze, its beauty is lost—how much more so for the great medicines of immortality? Thus, ancient Daoists prepared divine medicines only in renowned mountains, never in ordinary ones, precisely for this reason.

Furthermore, the immortal scriptures state that for those who wish to focus their minds and compound medicines, the following mountains are suitable: Mount Hua, Mount Tai, Mount Huo, Mount Heng, Mount Song, Mount Shaoshi, Mount Chang, Mount Taibai, Mount Zhongnan, Mount Nüji, Mount Difei, Mount Wangwu, Mount Baodu, Mount An

Knead it between the fingers until it becomes like mud. If it does not boil or fails to emerge between the fingers when kneaded, melt it again and immerse it in clear wine—this may be repeated countless times. Once prepared, take it in the size of a pellet, either one or two, or divide into smaller pills. After thirty days, one will be free from cold and heat, and divine beings and jade maidens will attend to you. Silver may also be ingested in the same manner as gold. Consuming these two substances enables one to dwell in renowned mountains or stone chambers; after a year, one will become light and ascend. Even if taken only among mortals, one will become an earthbound immortal. Do not transmit this recklessly.

*Two Modes Elixir: Method for Ingesting Gold*
Take three *jin* of pig’s back fat and one *sheng* of pure bitter wine. Place five *liang* of gold in a vessel and heat it over an earthen stove. Dip the gold into the fat a hundred times, then into the bitter wine a hundred times. Consuming one *jin* grants longevity spanning heaven and earth; half a *jin* grants two thousand years of life; five *liang* grants twelve hundred years. Regardless of quantity, it may be ingested. Prepare and take it on a day of royal vigor. The effects are wondrous—do not transmit or show it to others, lest the medicine fail to form or lose its potency. When ready to depart, one should ingest cinnabar.

*Principles Profound, Fifth*
The Master Who Embraces Simplicity said: "The subtleties of defense are difficult to discern, and those who doubt are many. How could my wisdom surpass others?"

Those with partial understanding may happen upon insights—cranes know midnight, swallows know the hours of Wu and Ji, yet they may not grasp other matters. Through comparison and verification, one knows that longevity is attainable and that immortals are not born of lineage. The subtleties of the Dao cannot be fully recorded in writing, and its more accessible aspects are not worth expounding. In ancient times, Gengsang Chu and Laozi toiled diligently in their studies for many years before receiving the great transmission—there was good reason for this.

Of those with rounded heads and endowed with qi, who does not delight in life and fear death? Yet glory and power seduce the mind, unadorned beauty and jade-like skin dazzle the eyes, and the melodies of clear *shang* and flowing *zheng* confuse the ears. Love and aversion, benefit and harm agitate the spirit; fame and reputation bind the body. These all arrive unbidden and form without instruction. Unless one is destined to transcend, comprehends the Dao in solitude, perceives transformations beyond the ordinary, and wields discernment in the realm of the profound and boundless—awakening to the intimacy or estrangement of body and name, lamenting the fleeting swiftness of time like lightning—how could one forsake fleeting social ties, suppress desires, relinquish immediate cravings, and pursue the distant achievement of the Way?

For being arises from non-being, and form is established through spirit.

The existent is the palace of the non-existent; form is the dwelling of spirit. Thus, it may be likened to a dike—when the dike collapses, water does not remain. It may be compared to a candle—when the candle melts, the flame does not abide. When form is wearied, spirit scatters; when qi is exhausted, life ends. When roots wither and branches flourish, the verdant leaves depart the tree. When qi is fatigued and desires prevail, the essence-spirit departs the body. That which passes has no return; once decayed, there is no principle of rebirth. How lamentable for those who comprehend the Dao!

How could one not have reason to value seclusion over worldly splendor? Thus, those who nurture their nature in mountain forests and transcend convention to attain their intent regard lofty honors as mere excrescences, comparing all things to the wings of a cicada. How could they idly boast or feign disdain for worldly affairs? Truly, their vision is clear, and they abandon such things as if forgetting them.

Therefore, they dwell in remote seclusion, concealing their brilliance and veiling their splendor. They restrain the eyes that crave sights, dismiss colors that dazzle the vision, and block the ears that seek sounds. They distance themselves from clamorous voices, purify their profound contemplation, embrace the feminine and hold to the One, refine their qi to achieve suppleness, and stabilize themselves with tranquility. They dispel the perverse emotions of joy and sorrow, disregard the external gains and losses of honor and disgrace, sever the poisonous attachments of indulgent living, and silence the mechanisms of excessive speech. Only after turning inward do they hear with clarity; only after inner vision do they perceive the formless. They cultivate the spiritual root in the profound crucible, eliminate enticing desires in their interactions with the world, and cut away trivial concerns to govern themselves with ease and contentment. Through non-action, they preserve the principles of Heaven.

Thus, they chew and absorb the precious blossoms, bathe their spirits in the Great Clarity. Externally, they expel the five luminaries; internally, they guard the nine essences. They fortify the jade lock at the Gate of Life, bind the Northern Culmen to the Yellow Court, and draw the Three Radiant Ones into the Hall of Light. They soar with the Primordial Beginning to refine their form, savor the divine liquid upon the golden beam, drive the white away and retain the green, congeal the limpid spring within the cinnabar field, and draw the sunken pearl from the five cities and jade tripod. Below, they stoke the cauldron with the aquatic fowl; above, they make the splendid blossoms sing. The celestial deer sprouts its jade antlers, and the heavy jade ring is suspended in the Crimson Palace. The nine lights are concealed within the cavernous abyss, clouds darken and stretch to the heavens, and the long valleys run deep and intertwine. They tread upon the Qian and Dui trigrams, summon the Six Ding spirits, and recline in the purple chamber. They chew the golden petals, their countenances radiant as autumn chrysanthemums, crimson blossoms, jade-green stems, and crystal nectar overflowing like dew. They cure hunger and quench thirst, their bodies lightened, enabling them to ride the winds and clouds, soar through the void, merge with the primordial chaos, and attain eternal life.

Yet, dust accumulating to the depth of a foot cannot be sought in a fleeting moment, nor can the resonant flow of a mountain stream be attained in an instant. Those who achieve this are exceedingly rare, while those who fail are numerous and conspicuous. The world cannot comprehend those who succeed but only sees those who fail, and thus declares that immortality is but an empty path.

The *Baopuzi* states: When a dam is firm, water does not leak and waste; when tallow is abundant, the flame does not flicker and fade. The Dragon Spring sword, though unused, remains ever-sharp; axes and hatchets, though used daily, quickly wear out. Snow, though shunned in warmth, is stored through summer; ice, though buried deep, endures the heat. A single cloth may shield a mirror from scorching, and common plants may cover the ground through winter. Mud and earth are easily dissolved, yet when fired into pottery, they endure as long as Heaven and Earth. Oak and willow swiftly decay, yet when burned into charcoal, they may last for eons. Swine raised in comfort die young, while fine horses, though climbing steep paths, perish early. Cold-loving insects live twice as long, and southern trees thrive in warmth. Yet when exposed to killing frost, they wither, and when touched by spring’s harmony, they flourish. All things share the same nature, yet their flourishing and decay differ in function. How can there be fixed limits to autumn’s harvest or immutable laws for winter’s storage?

Human life and the span of death are not as predictable as plants in the cold of winter. Yet the principles of nurturing life and the methods of remedying harm offer benefits far beyond mere warmth. Why, then, do the effects of prolonged observation not convince the world? People cling to the familiar and the narrow, dismissing the Dao of immortality as fantastical and the teachings of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi as mere delusion. How lamentable!

The foolish refuse to trust even in medicine and acupuncture—how much less in matters deeper than these? They say: "If physicians like Yu Fu, Bian Que, Qin Yueren, and Cang Gong could cure illness, why did they not avoid death?" Or: "The wealthy and noble have no lack of medical skill, yet they do not live longer—is this not simply the natural course of fate?" To demand that such people believe in immortals is like making an ox climb a tree or a horse chase a bird.

The *Baopuzi* states: Summoning the lesser elixirs—three agents in pills or the five flowers and eight minerals—small medicines may instantly dissolve solid ice or float upon water. They can sever demonic influences, repel tigers and leopards, break up accumulations in the viscera, annihilate illness in the depths of the body, revive the suddenly dead from their abandoned corpses, and restore departed souls. These are but pills, yet they can bring the dead back to life. How, then, could the supreme medicines fail to grant immortality to the living?

The physician from Yue revived the prince after his death; the Hu shamans revived Su Wu after his breath had ceased. Chunyu Yi could open the skull to treat the brain; Hua Tuo could cut open the abdomen to cleanse the intestines. These are but minor skills of physicians, yet they achieved such feats. How much more can the Dao of immortality accomplish?

The reason people die is the harm wrought by desires, the afflictions of the hundred diseases, and the poisoning of noxious influences.

The harm wrought by perverse qi, the assault of wind and cold—these too are causes. Now, through guiding and pulling to circulate qi, returning essence to replenish the brain, regulating food and drink, moderating activity and rest, ingesting medicinal substances, contemplating the spirit, and guarding unity; by upholding celestial prohibitions, observing precepts, wearing talismans and seals, and utterly shunning all that harms life—thus one may avoid these six afflictions.

Today, physicians prescribe the "Pill for Illuminating Kidney Qi," the "Powder for Internal Supplementation of the Five Networks," the "Decoction for Filling the Bones with Wolfberry," and the "Decoction for Fortifying the Center with Astragalus." Those who take these all attain robust health. Lacquer leaves and *qingzhen* herbs—mere withered plants—were consumed by Fan A, who lived two hundred years, his ears and eyes still keen, and he could yet wield the needle to treat illness. These are recent factual accounts recorded by faithful historians.

It is further said that Wu Pu, having learned the "Five Animals' Play" from Hua Tuo to replace guiding and pulling, lived over a hundred years. These are but the most rudimentary of medicinal arts, and yet they achieve such results. How much more can be accomplished by those who employ their subtleties?

Now, when one tells the common folk that the "Regulating the Center" and "Four Harmonies" formulas can save those with cholera, that *kuandong* and *ziwan* can cure cough and counterflow, that *lilu* and *guanzhong* can slay the nine worms, that *danggui* and *shaoyao* can halt colicky pain, that *zhenjiao* and *duhuo* can dispel the eight winds, that *changpu* and *ganjiang* can arrest numbness and dampness, that *tusi* and *congrong* can supplement depletion and fatigue, that *gansui* and *tingli* can expel phlegm and accumulations, that *gualuo* and *huanglian* can heal wasting-thirst, that *jini* and *gancao* can resolve a hundred poisons, that *luru* and *yiyu* can prevent all wounds, and that *mahuang* and *daqing* can master cold damage—they still refuse to believe. They would rather slaughter living beings to entreat blessings, divide milfoil to divine misfortune, and refuse to trust the skilled physician’s attack on illness, instead relying on the chaos of shamans and scribes. How much less, then, would they heed the teaching that golden elixirs can transcend the world or that magic mushrooms can prolong life?

In ancient times, Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Liu, devised extraordinary strategies—none of his contemporaries could match his foresight and planning—yet even he declared that immortality could be attained. Though his wisdom and intelligence surpassed those of ordinary men, he said, "I shall abandon worldly affairs to follow Master Red Pine," and so he practiced *daoyin* and grain avoidance for a year, seeking the Way of lightness and ascension. When Empress Lü pressed him to devise a plan to secure the position of the Crown Prince, Liang had no choice but to write to summon the Four Whiteheads. As he had foreseen, Empress Lü, grateful for his counsel, compelled him to eat heartily, thus preventing the completion of his Way.

According to the *Secret Records of Kong Anguo*, Liang had received from the Yellow Stone Master not only the art of warfare but also the method of immortality. It further states that Liang’s true teachers were the Four Whiteheads—Master Jiaoli, Master Qili, and their companions—all of whom were immortals. Liang had fully received their divine formulas. Though Empress Lü forced him to eat and drink, he soon resumed his practice of the immortal arts, secretly transcending the world. Yet the common people, unaware of this, claimed he had died. If Kong Anguo’s words are true, then Liang indeed attained immortality.

Moreover, Zhang Cang, the Han Chancellor, happened upon a minor technique: by suckling a woman’s milk, he lived to one hundred and eight. This was but a shallow practice of the Dao, yet Cang thereby tripled the lifespan of an ordinary man. How much more, then, could one achieve long life by fully practicing the secret methods?

This account appears in the *Book of Han* and is no empty claim. As the *Baopuzi* states: "Ingesting elixirs is the foundation of long life, but if one can also practice *qi*-circulation, the benefits will be swift. Even without elixirs, if one fully masters *qi*-circulation, one may live for several centuries. However, one must also know the arts of the bedchamber. Without understanding the techniques of yin and yang, frequent exhaustion will weaken the efficacy of *qi*-circulation."

Man dwells within *qi*, and *qi* dwells within man. From heaven and earth to the myriad things, nothing exists without *qi* to sustain it. Those skilled in *qi*-circulation use it inwardly to nourish the body and outwardly to repel evil, yet the common people employ it daily without awareness.

In Wu and Yue, there are methods of incantation and *qi*-restraint that yield remarkable results. Those who master them can enter a great epidemic, share a bed with the sick, and remain uninfected. They can also protect dozens of their kin, leaving them unafraid—this is *qi* warding off heavenly disasters. If malevolent spirits or mountain demons invade a household, hurling tiles and stones, setting fires, or manifesting in visible or invisible forms, a master of *qi*-restraint can silence them instantly—this is *qi* subduing demonic spirits.

In mountain forests, where poisonous vapors and vipers abound, ordinary travelers are invariably harmed, yet those skilled in *qi*-restraint can clear a radius of dozens of *li*, ensuring their companions remain unharmed. They can also subdue tigers, leopards, and venomous snakes, rendering them motionless. With *qi*, they can staunch the bleeding of wounds, mend bones and sinews, and even tread upon blades or endure stabbings unscathed. If someone is bitten by a viper, a master of *qi* can cure them instantly.

In recent times, Zuo Ci, Zhao Ming, and others could reverse the flow of water with *qi*, making it surge upward for one or two *zhang*. They could cook food over a fire atop a thatched roof without burning it, or drive a nail seven or eight *cun* into a pillar and then expel it with a breath. They could boil water, toss in a hundred coins, and have someone retrieve them unscathed. They could expose water to the open air in freezing weather without it icing over, or prevent all cooking fires within a *li* from burning. They could silence dogs, rendering them unable to bark.

Once, when the Wu kingdom sent General He to suppress mountain bandits, the bandits had a master of *qi*-restraint who, during battle, rendered the official troops’ swords and blades immovable and caused their arrows to reverse and strike their own ranks. General He, resourceful and quick-witted, reasoned: "I have heard that edged weapons can be restrained, and poisonous creatures can be restrained, but objects without edges or venom cannot be restrained. Their restraint must be limited to weapons." He then had sturdy wooden clubs made and selected five thousand elite soldiers to lead the charge. When they attacked, the bandits, relying on their *qi*-restraint, were unprepared for unarmed weapons. The official troops crushed them with clubs, killing tens of thousands. The bandits’ restraint indeed no longer worked.

If *qi*, issuing from the body, can achieve such effects, why doubt that it can enable grain avoidance, cure illness, prolong life, and nurture one’s nature?

Zhongchang Tongli, a man of profound talent, wrote in his *Changyan* that *qi*-circulation could eliminate hunger and illness. At first, he did not believe it, but upon witnessing its practitioners, he found it to be true. The methods of nurturing life are so simple, yet he had not mastered them. Was this not because his mind was distracted by worldly affairs and his thoughts consumed by mundane concerns? Others who fail to practice must share this same affliction.

Long ago, a renowned master who knew the Way of immortality was sought by the Lord of Yan. Before the envoy could learn the method, the master died. Enraged, the lord intended to punish the envoy. A remonstrator said: "What we fear most is death, and what we value most is life. If even he lost his life, how could he have granted you immortality?" The lord relented, and this was indeed sound advice. Yet it was not entirely correct. If the master possessed the method of immortality, and if what I have heard of *qi*-circulation is true, then the master’s death did not necessarily mean he was ignorant of the Way. He simply could not abandon worldly affairs to practice it, so though he knew the method, it was of no benefit. It was not that the method of immortality did not exist.

It is also said that in Mixian County of Henan, a man named Bu Cheng studied the Dao for many years. One day, he bid farewell to his family, and as he walked, his steps gradually lifted him into the clouds until he vanished—this is what is meant by "lightening the body, ascending in broad daylight, and becoming an immortal of the highest order."

Chen Yuanfang and Han Yuanchang, both eminent scholars of Yingchuan, lived near Mixian. Their belief in the existence of immortals stemmed from their fathers and grandfathers having personally witnessed Bu Cheng’s ascension. This is yet another proof of immortality.

**Subtle Proofs, Part Six**
The *Baopuzi* states: "Those who share the same path and purpose need no words to trust one another, while those on divergent paths, even with earnest advice, are met with doubt. The Way is as near as a foot or a span, yet people debate trivial matters of worldly gain and loss. They distinguish black from white as clearly as gold from feathers or ink from powder, yet many remain confused and unable to discern the truth."

How much more so when one speaks of matters beyond the ways of the world and reveals the subtlest of proofs—yet mockery has long been the response. Is this unique to our time? What the enlightened eye perceives, even in the darkest depths of the netherworld or the faintest glimmer of a hair’s tip, presents no difficulty in discerning. Yet where understanding fails to reach, even the radiance of the sun and moon illuminating the heavens or the towering majesty of Mount Song piercing the clouds remain unseen.

The Divine Son and the Illustrious Sage, with profound insight and singular vision, uncovered secret texts in the sacred mountains and received the scriptures of immortality from divine beings. They cast off the dust of the world to shed its burdens, soared to the farthest reaches in lofty ascent—neither gold nor stone could match their durability, nor could cranes or tortoises rival their longevity. Moved by those who aspire to what lies ahead and pitying those who, though faithful, lack guidance, they bequeathed methods clear and luminous. Small efforts yield small gains; great endeavors bring great verification. Yet the shallow-minded cling stubbornly to their narrow views, content with bitterness like the sow-thistle and smartweed, unaware of the sweetness of maltose; drunk on thin wine, they fail to savor rich, unstrained liquor. They know the value of life yet remain ignorant of the Way of nurturing it; they fear death yet do not believe in the methods of transcending it. They recognize that excess in food and drink hastens illness yet cannot restrain their craving for rich flavors; they understand that indulgence in passion and desire leads to depletion and decay yet refuse to curb their desires.

Though I speak of the attainability of immortality, how can I make them believe? Some may object: "Your body lacks the auspicious signs, your understanding falls short of profound insight, your bones bear no extraordinary marks, and your years do not rival those of Anqi or Pengzu. You have never laid eyes on an immortal—how, then, can you claim to know of the possibility of long life or the evidence of cultivating one’s nature? If you have glimpsed the mysterious and wondrous within your heart and discerned the extraordinary through your own vision, I dare not affirm it." Such is the reasoning of those who, lacking even the means to cover their skin or provisions for the evening, yet boast of the arts of Tao Zhu or the methods of Yi Dun, inviting ridicule. Those burdened by chronic illness speak of the skills of Bian Que, or those who have repeatedly fled in defeat claim mastery of Sun and Wu’s strategies—people disbelieve because they see no results.

I reply: If a minnow swims in a puddle, it may claim the world holds no vast seas; if an ant writhes within a fruit pit, it may assert the eight directions end there. Though told of boundless oceans or the expanse of the cosmos, it would dismiss such words as empty talk and refuse to believe. If my eyes were square pupils and my ears extended beyond my crown, if I were to rein in flying dragons and ride auspicious clouds, outracing lightning to reach the inverted shadows—how then could you question me? Even if you saw me, you would call me a celestial spirit, an earthly deity, or some strange creature, never acknowledging that my attainments arose from study.

I merely seek to guide those of like mind as a precursor—how could I compel all your followers to believe? If immortals filled every household, visible as clearly as brows and lashes, even the blind would not doubt. But when such beings achieve the Dao, they tread the azure heavens and draw near the Purple Pole—unless one possesses spiritual communion, they remain unseen and unheard. You, however, dismiss this as nonexistent. The world trusts its hasty judgments, bows to its limited vision, and claims infallibility in its assessments. Is it any wonder, then, that they find the extraordinary so strange?

Those who dismiss what they rarely hear, pointing to their palms, will never awaken to its origins—this has long been the case. How is it only so today? Some may say: "Having repeatedly received your fine discourse, I no longer doubt the existence of immortals. Yet I still regret my inability to become one. Dare I ask if there is a more essential Way that can be practiced alone?"

I, Baopuzi, reply: In all Daoist cultivation, one must ascend from the shallow to the profound, proceed from the easy to the difficult. With steadfast sincerity and resolute determination, nothing will not be achieved. Doubt, however, yields no success—this is no single matter. To seek branches and leaves reaching the clouds without roots penetrating the earth, or to desire a river’s flow spanning ten thousand li without a deep and distant source—such things have never existed.

Without accumulating hidden virtue and secret goodness, one cannot move the divine spirits. Without wholehearted sincerity and mutual affinity, one cannot bind teacher and friend. Without meritorious deeds, one cannot undertake great trials. And without encountering an enlightened teacher, one cannot obtain the essential Way.

The Nine Elixirs and Golden Liquor are the foremost methods for immortality, yet their affairs are grand and their costs heavy—one cannot complete them hastily. Preserving essence and cherishing qi are most urgent. One should first ingest minor medicines to extend life and study basic arts to repel evil and misfortune, thereby gradually ascending to subtler realms.

Some may ask: "The methods and arts are so numerous—truly difficult to master in full. Setting aside the Golden Elixir, which of the remaining practices is best to cultivate?"

I reply: If one has not yet attained the greatest essentials, then the lesser ones cannot be neglected. For the various arts together accomplish long life. To illustrate with a grand analogy: it is like a ruler governing a state—civil and martial arts, rites and laws, none can be dispensed with. To illustrate with a small analogy: it is like a craftsman building a carriage—spokes, shafts, hubs, and linchpins, none may be lacking. The arts serve to inwardly cultivate form and spirit, extending years and curing illness, and outwardly to ward off evil, preventing calamity and harm. Compared to a zither or lute, one cannot seek the five notes with a single string. Compared to armor, one cannot withstand blades with a single plate. Why? The five notes must be used together, none can be missing; blades converge from all directions, none can be absent.

In nurturing life, one must desire extensive hearing yet grasp the essentials, see broadly yet choose wisely. Relying solely on one practice is insufficient. Moreover, those fond of life often cling to their own strengths: those who know the arts of the bedchamber say only those arts can transcend the world; those versed in exhalation and inhalation say only circulating qi can extend life; those who know the secrets of flexion and extension say only daoyin can forestall old age; those who know herbal formulas say only medicinal diets can lead to endless life. The failure of Daoist cultivation arises precisely from such one-sidedness.

Those of shallow vision, having learned but one thing, claim it is enough and do not recognize the truth. Even if they obtain an excellent method, they still seek endlessly, wasting effort and time, their intentions shifting without constancy—both sides err in this.

Some, dull-witted by nature and knowing only the most superficial, rashly enter famous mountains, braving poisonous stings and bites, repeatedly suffering harm. Ashamed to seek return, some are eaten by tigers and wolves, some killed by demons and sprites. Lacking methods to fast or warm themselves, they die in ravines and valleys—is this not foolish?

In pursuing learning, choosing a teacher is more important than the pursuit itself. If the teacher’s knowledge is narrow and they do not teach all they know, they may say: "The Way does not lie in multiplicity. Once you possess the Golden Elixir’s essentials, you need not rely on the rest." Yet those who know this are exceedingly rare—how can one idly await unknown great matters and neglect the small arts that bring mutual benefit?

It is like building a household without using other goods—this only applies if one has gold, silver, pearls, and jade in hand, sufficient to supply generations of expenses. If one lacks these, how can one not broadly sow grains and abundantly store fruits and vegetables?

Thus, grain abstention, avoiding weapons, suppressing demons, warding off evil spirits, restraining poisons, curing illnesses, entering mountains to make beasts not attack, crossing waters to make dragons not harm, passing through epidemics without fear, and facing crises by concealing one’s form—these are all minor matters one cannot be ignorant of. How much more so for matters beyond these?

Some may ask: "Dare I ask what prohibitions and taboos exist for cultivating long life?"

I reply: The most urgent prohibitions lie in not harming and not damaging. According to the *Yi’s* inner admonitions, the *Scripture of Red Pine*, and the *River Chart’s* records of life talismans, heaven and earth have spirits that oversee transgressions, reducing one’s allotted years according to the severity of the offense. When years are reduced, one suffers poverty, depletion, frequent illness, and repeated misfortune. When years are exhausted, one dies.

There are hundreds of ways to lose years—too many to enumerate. It is also said that within the body dwell the Three Corpses. Though formless, they are truly spiritual demons. Desiring a person’s early death, these Corpses, when able, act as demons, freely roaming and partaking in human sacrifices. Thus, on every *gengshen* day, they ascend to heaven and report a person’s transgressions to the Controller of Destinies. On the night of the month’s end, the Stove God also ascends to report one’s sins. For grave offenses, one’s *ji* is taken—*ji* being three hundred days. For lesser offenses, one’s *suan* is taken—*suan* being three days (or one day). I cannot verify the existence of these matters.

Yet the Way of Heaven is distant, and spirits are hard to fathom. Zhao Jianzi and Duke Mu of Qin both personally received golden defenses from the Supreme Emperor, with clear evidence in the land. Mountains, rivers, grasses, trees, wells, stoves, ponds, and pools all possess essence and qi—how much more so heaven and earth, the greatest of all things? By principle, they must have spirits. With spirits, they should reward good and punish evil. Yet their bodies are vast and their responses slow—they need not react instantly like an echo.

However, perusing all Daoist admonitions, none do not say: Those who seek long life must accumulate goodness and establish merit, be compassionate toward all things, extend forbearance to others, bring kindness to insects, rejoice in others’ fortune, pity others’ suffering, relieve others’ crises, and rescue others’ distress. Do not harm life with your hands or incite calamity with your mouth. See others’ gains as your own gains, others’ losses as your own losses. Do not exalt or praise yourself, do not envy those who surpass you, do not flatter or secretly harm others—only thus can one possess virtue and receive heaven’s blessings. What one does will surely succeed, and seeking immortality may be hoped for.

If, however, one hates good and loves killing, speaks falsely while harboring deceit, contradicts oneself, perverts justice, oppresses subordinates, deceives superiors, betrays those one serves, fails to appreciate kindness, manipulates the law for bribes, bends the straight and twists the upright, abandons the public for the private, punishes the innocent, destroys families, seizes treasures, harms others’ bodies, usurps positions, encroaches upon and suppresses the worthy, executes the submissive, slanders sages and worthies, injures Daoist practitioners, shoots flying birds, disembowels fetuses, breaks eggs, hunts in spring and summer, curses spirits, teaches others to do evil, conceals others’ goodness, endangers others for one’s own safety, takes credit for others’ work, ruins others’ fine deeds, seizes what others love, separates others’ kin, humiliates others to prevail, takes others’ long coins and returns short ones, diverts water and fire to harm others, coerces the weak, exchanges bad for good, forcibly takes and plunders, causes unjust harm, acts unfairly, indulges in debauchery, overthrows the upright, bullies orphans and widows, picks up lost items and takes offerings, deceives and swindles, loves to gossip about others’ private matters, holds others’ faults, invokes heaven and earth in curses, borrows without returning, exchanges loans without repayment, seeks desires endlessly, resents and rejects loyalty and trust, disobeys superiors’ commands, disrespects teachers, mocks others’ good deeds, ruins others’ crops, damages others’ belongings, impoverishes others, troubles others with uncleanness, uses light scales and small measures, short cloth and narrow gauges, mixes false with true, seeks illicit profit, lures others to take things, steps over wells and stoves, sings on the last day of the month and wails on the first—every such act is a sin. According to its severity, the Controller of Destinies reduces one’s *suan* and *ji*. When *suan* and *ji* are exhausted, one dies.

If one harbors evil thoughts without evil deeds, *suan* is reduced. If one commits evil that harms others, *ji* is reduced. If *suan* and *ji* are not exhausted yet one dies prematurely, the misfortune extends to one’s descendants.

Those who forcibly seize others’ property—calculating that their wives, children, and household will eventually repay the debt with death—bring ruin not immediately, but in time. If their evil deeds are insufficient to kill the victim’s family, they will nonetheless, over time, suffer from floods, fires, banditry, or the loss of valuables; or they may encounter official punishment, illness, and the expenses of medical treatment, animal sacrifice, and ritual offerings—all of which will inevitably exhaust the wealth they wrongfully took.

Daoist teachings say that those who wrongfully kill others do so with blades, slaying one another in turn. Those who seize wealth without justice, heedless of resentment, are like one who eats spoiled meat to stave off hunger or drinks poisoned wine to quench thirst: though they may briefly satisfy their craving, death will soon follow. If, however, one who has committed such evils later repents and reforms—having wrongfully killed, one should seek to save those facing death to atone; having unjustly taken others’ property, one should give alms to the poor to make amends. [Text incomplete.]

Some ask: “If one’s virtue is not yet perfected and one has not yet retreated to the remote mountains, how can one avoid the dangers of this age, where thieves and bandits abound, and guard against unforeseen calamities?”

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* replies: On a day governed by the *Trunk*, take earth from the position of the six *Gui* and mix it with the leaves of a hundred plants and fragrant herbs to plaster your door, one foot square—thieves will not come. Alternatively, take earth from the south gate of the market, or from the *Broken Year* and *Established Month* positions, shape it into a human figure, and place it in the Vermilion Bird direction—this will also suppress bandits. In an emergency, enter *Shengdi* (Living Earth) and remain there, and you will be safe.

The world has its *Shengdi*, a province has its *Shengdi*, a commandery has its *Shengdi*, a county has its *Shengdi*, a village has its *Shengdi*, a hamlet has its *Shengdi*, a house has its *Shengdi*, a room has its *Shengdi*.

Someone asks: “If even a single room has its *Shengdi*, is this not too restrictive?”

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* replies: The scriptures say that in the utmost extremity, one may even take refuge beneath a cart’s axle. Even within a single cart, there is *Shengdi* and *Sidi* (Dead Earth)—how much more so in a room?

Another asks: “I have heard that to seek the Way of life, one must know the Two Mountains. I do not know where these mountains are—would you deign to enlighten me and dispel my confusion?”

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* replies: They do exist, but they are neither Mount Hua nor Mount Heng, nor Mount Song nor Mount Tai. The Great Yuan Mountain is difficult to know yet easy to seek: neither in heaven nor on earth, neither submerged nor afloat, utterly remote and perilous, towering and rugged. Its harmonious *qi* swirls in abundance, and spirits and sages wander there together. Jade springs flow deep and unceasing, irrigating the hundred and twenty palaces and courts that stand in array. The *Li* and *Kan* trigrams hold their positions, and ten thousand stalks of dark mushrooms grow alongside crimson trees. Its treasures surpass gold and jade, and sweet springs flow from its corners. Those who drink from its pure streams become companions of Peng and Wang—this is the first mountain.

The Long Valley Mountain is vast and towering, its dark *qi* drifting like mist, its jade nectar scattering like dew. Golden pools and purple chambers lie hidden in its recesses. Fools who recklessly approach perish, but those of the Dao who ascend do not age. They pluck and consume yellow essence to ascend to heaven—this is the second mountain. Both are secrets guarded by the sages of old; ponder them deeply.

Another asks: “I wish to hear of the Realized One’s art of guarding the body and refining the form.”

The *Master Embracing Simplicity* replies: Profound is your question! At the beginning of the *Qing* cycle, when the moon and sun are half-risen and conjoined, they emerge as one. That which enters the jade pool and the golden chamber is the size of a pellet, yellow as a tangerine, containing a fine flavor sweet as a jujube. If you obtain it, guard it carefully and do not lose it. Once it has passed, it cannot be retrieved. When the body is about to perish, a pure white *qi*, subtle and dense, ascends through the secluded pass, winding thrice before reaching the radiant cinnabar of the *Mingmen* (Gate of Life), where form is not yet complete. How deep and wondrous! Difficult to attain, this is the oral transmission of the master. Those who know it fear neither the myriad demons nor the five weapons.

One asks: Can those who fully master the arts of the bedchamber through single practice attain transcendence, avert disasters, absolve sins, transform misfortune into blessing, secure high office, or multiply merchants’ profits? Is this true?

Embracing Simplicity replies: These are all exaggerations from the books of shamans—wild and deceptive claims, embellished by meddlers to the point of falsehood. Some are even fabricated by charlatans to deceive the world, weaving tangled threads to solicit offerings, gathering disciples to pursue worldly gain.

The arts of yin and yang, at best, may cure minor ailments or prevent depletion—nothing more. Their principles have limits; how could they lead to transcendence or dispel misfortune and summon fortune? Yet one cannot remain entirely without yin-yang union, lest illness arise. If, however, one indulges without restraint, exhausting desire without moderation, it will cut short one’s years.
