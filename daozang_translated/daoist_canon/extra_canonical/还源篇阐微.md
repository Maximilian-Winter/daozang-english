**Preface to *Elucidating the Return to the Source***

Those who cherish the primordial truth wander through sacred realms, seeking the transmission of the true Dharma, ever aspiring to benefit the world. They abide in singular devotion to the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of life. For though the study of immortality is most simple, men make it difficult for themselves; though liberation from the dust is not hard, men find it elusive—how lamentable indeed!

As the ancients said:
*"Deluded clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,
Karmic winds stir the sea of stillness."*

Years ago, at a post station, I encountered my late master, the Perfected Zhang Ziyang. In words of utmost simplicity—no more than half a phrase—he revealed effects that manifested in but a moment. Thus I knew that immortality could indeed be learned, and privately rejoiced. When the golden elixir congealed and the sacred embryo attained perfection, I composed *The Return to the Source* in eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, offering it to later students that they might early awaken to the true trap. Do not wait until old age, when lead is spent and mercury scarce—awaken swiftly! Seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend together the immortal ranks, transform and take flight—this is my deepest wish.

**Postscript**

Those who refine the golden elixir must know that the winter solstice does not lie in the *zi* hour, nor is bathing confined to *mao* and *you*. Mercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, qi, blood, nor fluids. The *seven returns* are the return to the root; the *nine reversions* are the return to the source. When the essence of metal and the fluid of wood meet earth, they unite. Dragon and tiger, horse and ox—all are without form.

As my late master’s *Awakening to Reality* states: *"The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond"*—this refers to lead and mercury. If one knows the origin of lead, one knows the source of mercury. Knowing lead and mercury, one knows the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing the divine water of the Flowery Pond, one may refine the golden elixir.

The work of the golden elixir is accomplished in an instant—do not cling to the timetable of nine years or three years, nor fixate on years, months, days, or hours for its operation. As Zhongli said: *"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin."* Thus one cannot seek within the body itself, but must seek the single yang essence within it. Yet this yang essence resides in one aperture, which ordinary people cannot fathom. This aperture is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the very divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing this, one may gather and unite, then refine, bathe, and separate the embryo, followed by gentle nurturing. When the elixir is complete, how could one fail to discern its source, know its weight, or recognize its time?

Since receiving my master’s teaching, I have known that this body need not die, and that this elixir must surely be achieved. Now that the great work is underway, I proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.

**Elucidating *The Return to the Source***

*The Return to the Source*, in eighty-one chapters, was composed by the Perfected Shi of Apricot Grove during the Song dynasty. A disciple of the Perfected Zhang Ziyang, he was the second patriarch of the Southern Lineage. Moved by pity for those who study books in pursuit of the Dao yet fail to awaken to their own nature, he wrote this work to repeatedly clarify the path of returning to the root and source.

The method of returning to the source begins with unwavering adherence to right mindfulness. In the midst of daily ethical conduct, one must everywhere restrain anger and suppress desire, acting with sincerity and without pretense, practicing ritual—this is *refining the self*. Silently applying effort to purify the mind and forget emotions, one dredges and opens the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. Through vigilant solitude, one retreats and conceals within the profound—this is *laying the foundation*. Naturally, a single point of true yang qi emerges from the body, and a single drop of true yin essence flows from the heart. These intermingle and congeal into the elixir—this is the *elixir head*.

From this point, the heart naturally abides in sincerity, and qi naturally circulates throughout. Over time, the heart is concealed within the heart yet unseen, and qi is stored within qi yet unfathomable. In stillness, one is empty; in motion, one is direct. Qi is fresh, and spirit is clear—this is *completing the body*. Only when the three temporal realms are fully penetrated, all conditions stilled, the six senses purified, and the square inch of the heart empty and luminous—only then, after a month of unbroken practice, do the medicinal substances flow ceaselessly. Throughout, one operates with pure stillness and naturalness, thereby returning to the source, reverting to the root, and uniting with the Dao—this is *perfecting the true*.

Such is the essence of the golden elixir. Yet the great key lies first in knowing the single aperture within the body, for only then can one begin. This aperture is the window of spirit and brightness, the origin of nature and life. When scattered, it disperses into the seven apertures; when returned to its root, it coalesces into one. Only one who can gather the body with the heart knows how to fathom principle and exhaust nature. Only one who can conceal the heart within the body can exhaust nature and attain life.

For the heart and body are the supports of nature and life, while nature and life are the root and stem of the heart and body. Essence and qi are the functions of the heart and body, while the heart and body are the gathering and storing places of spirit and qi. Thus, one who can gather the body’s qi with the heart causes spirit to return to the Celestial Valley, enabling the fathoming of principle and the exhaustion of nature. One who can conceal the heart’s spirit within the body causes qi to return to the Crimson Palace, enabling the exhaustion of nature and the attainment of life.

Only when principle is fathomed are desires purified; only when nature is exhausted are emotions forgotten. With desires purified and emotions forgotten, nothing disturbs the center. I alone guard the profound mystery of life, and suddenly the single aperture opens wide—this is *opening the barrier*. Perceiving that within it is emptiness without exhaustion, movement without cessation, one follows the transformations of opportunity and allows all to proceed naturally. This is what the *Book of Documents* means by: *"The Dao-heart is subtle; only with precision and unity can one truly hold to the center."* And what the *Dao De Jing* means by: *"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth."*

Having returned to the root, one recovers life; recovering life, one returns the elixir. How could one not, by tracing the flow to its source, first return to the moment of receiving qi at birth? Returning to my origin, the valley spirit does not die.

Guard well the beginning to secure the end, and the Golden Elixir may surely be accomplished.

(Received) This treatise was graciously bestowed by my late master, the Venerable Tai Xu, who also instructed me in the essentials of superior-grade lead and mercury. I have pondered it in silence, daring not to presumptuously add my own interpretations, until a single word from the master’s illumination suddenly brought full awakening.

The method of returning to the source, as revealed in the sequence of this text, encompasses all oral instructions—from *gathering* and *joining* to *smelting*, *bathing*, *parting the embryo*, *warming and nurturing*, and finally the elixir’s completion and liberation—none other than the repeated elucidation of the Way of returning to the root and restoring the origin, exhausting the subtlest to attain the vastest.

One who cultivates accordingly may enter the inner sanctum of sages and worthies, may ascend the stairway of immortals and buddhas. Now that the karmic conditions have ripened, I reverently honor my master’s intent and expound upon the text’s subtleties. Here, I command my grandnephew Yang Lin to record the following:

**Lead and mercury form the true body;
Yin and yang conjoin the Great Origin.**

The master said: *"Lead refers to the body; mercury refers to the heart. When they meet the Origin in due time, this is the superior-grade elixir path."*

My humble observation: At the moment before birth when one first receives qi, a single aperture forms within, containing essence, qi, and spirit—these three intermingled as one, steaming and swirling within, growing day and night. By the tenth month, when the fetus is fully formed, with a sudden forceful cry, the primordial aperture bursts open, connecting to the seven orifices, and breathing begins.

Within the body, three valleys then emerge: above, the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace, the abode of spirit; in the center, the Resonant Valley of Crimson Palace, the abode of qi; below, the Hollow Valley of Pass of Origin, later to become the abode of essence. At that time, primordial essence has already spread throughout the solid regions of the body and circulates; primordial qi has gathered in the central valley of Crimson Palace to serve as the foundation of life; primordial spirit then floats upward to the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace to serve as the lodging of nature.

Presently, primordial qi stirs and generates yang, beginning to flow into the lower valley of Pass of Origin to become essence—hence the lower valley is also called the Sea of Qi. Yet this essence remains primordial essence, still circulating with qi throughout the body. Whenever stillness reaches its utmost, the seven orifices merge back into one, and within the body, a single point of true yang qi rises to ascend toward the primordial spirit—this is what the elixir path calls *true lead*. Thus, the master designates the body as lead.

Primordial spirit, in stillness, generates yin, which also spreads into the central valley of Crimson Palace to become qi—hence the central valley is also called the Chamber of Spirit. Yet this qi remains primordial qi, still congealed with spirit, constantly generating fluid to nourish the heart. Whenever yang stirs, the single aperture is about to divide into seven, and from the heart first flows a single drop of true yin essence to meet the yang qi—this is what the elixir path calls *true mercury*. Thus, the master designates the heart as mercury.

When lead-qi obtains mercury-essence to circulate, the physical form matures—hence *"lead and mercury form the true body."* When yin-essence combines with yang-qi to ascend, primordial spirit congeals—hence *"yin and yang conjoin the Great Origin."*

In truth, lead refers to the qi within the body, and mercury refers to the essence within the heart—these are the primordial yang-spirit and yin-essence that have descended into the postnatal state, resembling the hidden Qian and Kun within Kan and Li. Yin refers to the qi within the sea, and yang refers to the spirit within the chamber—these are the postnatal lead-qi and mercury-essence returning to the primordial state, resembling the postnatal Kan and Li reverting to Qian and Kun.

Simply by inverting Kan and Li and returning the postnatal to the prior, spirit then lodges in the heart, resembling Qian; qi then relies upon the body, resembling Kun. Kun provides life—hence it is called *body*; Qian provides inception—hence it is called *Origin*. *"True body"* clarifies that the body has not yet leaked, remaining the body of the True One; *"Great Origin"* clarifies that the Origin has not yet dissipated, still holding the primordial of the Supreme Ultimate—both formed spontaneously at birth without reliance on artificial effort.

This chapter establishes the fundamental principle, explicitly pointing to the origin and showing that the body formed by the congealing of essence and qi serves as the foundation of primordial life, while the heart formed by the congealing of spirit and qi serves as the lodging of primordial nature. With body and heart attained, nature and life are complete; essence and qi daily flourish, medicine and fire are both prepared—one need only return daily to the True One.

**Merely knowing the practice of the two eights,
One may refine the Golden Elixir.**

This means that when one attains this body, heart, nature, and life—with spirit relying upon the heart and belonging to Qian, and qi depending upon the body and belonging to Kun—if one can maintain constant clarity and stillness, the seven orifices long remain merged into one, still resembling a single formed Supreme Ultimate. Nature has not yet leaked away, resembling a solid golden elixir. One need only return to emptiness and unite with the Dao to merge with the true Origin—why employ deliberate cultivation with the troubles of restoring nature and life?

Yet after birth, the seven orifices have already become individually perceptive and cannot constantly return to the one aperture. Thus, the undifferentiated is shattered into knowledge, and knowledge in turn transforms into consciousness. From this point, the heart is moved by external things and develops preferences and aversions; the body encounters external things and experiences joy and anger.

The essence within the heart, once drawn by external objects, no longer obeys the governance of primordial nature, constantly chasing outward instead of nourishing the heart. Primordial nature, having no lodging, thus dissipates. The primordial spirit, previously modeled on Qian, now becomes hollow and transforms into Li.

The qi within the body, once stirred by yin-essence, no longer circulates in accordance with primordial life, constantly leaking outward instead of filling the body. Primordial life, lacking sufficient foundation, daily diminishes. The primordial qi, previously modeled on Kun, now becomes substantial and transforms into Kan.

Primordial spirit was originally solid, but by constantly chasing qi, it daily appears hollow. Primordial qi was originally empty, but by constantly flowing into essence, it reverses and appears solid.

At last, the hollow grows ever more hollow, and the solid loses its solidity once more, giving rise to the afflictions of aging, sickness, death, and suffering. This is not due to any inherent flaw in the root or source, but rather the harm of pursuing the branch while neglecting the root, of mistaking the flow for the source.

When spirit loses its solidity, the heart transforms in form to become Li. When qi loses its hollowness, the body likewise transforms in form to become Kan. Thus, the single spark of yang within the postnatal Kan-body is none other than the prenatal primordial qi. In the hexagram’s virtue, it resembles fire within water—hence it is called "yang-qi." The single drop of yin within the postnatal Li-heart is none other than the prenatal primordial spirit. In the hexagram’s virtue, it gathers as water within fire—hence it is called "yin-essence."

The term "two eights" refers to the symbolic numbers within the hexagrams. Kan-water is already formed water, its number six belonging to earth. The fire within water is newly born fire, its number two also belonging to earth—six and two both pertain to earth, forming one of the "eights" of earth. This represents the prenatal primordial qi issuing forth from within my body, metaphorically called "lead." Li-fire is already formed fire, its number seven belonging to heaven. The water within fire is newly born water, its number one also belonging to heaven—seven and one both pertain to heaven, forming one of the "eights" of heaven. This represents the prenatal primordial spirit issuing forth from within my heart, metaphorically called "mercury." Thus, whenever speaking of medicine or fire, one must refer to it as "two eights," and no other number will suffice.

The phrase "practicing the two eights" is precisely the Dao of "timely uniting the primordial," as the master taught—employing only purity and naturalness in its application. Now, recognizing the harm of mistaking the flow for the source and wishing to return to the root, if one does not restrain anger and suppress desires, there is absolutely no way to begin. If one wishes to suppress desires and restrain anger, then uniting and practicing these two eights will make spirit the fire and qi the medicine.

At the time of gathering, it is called "medicine," for it is still postnatal yin-essence and yang-qi. At the time of refinement, it is called "fire," for it belongs to the prenatal—spirit is yang, while qi is yin. Simply knowing how to employ spirit to guide qi is to use fire to refine medicine, which can then form the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.

The term "refinement" implies the need for vigilance against danger and caution against risk, yet it still employs only purity and naturalness in its application. For the yang-qi within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the hollow valley, if not congealed by spirit, risks scattering. The yin-essence within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the responsive valley, if not circulated by qi, risks sinking back into its former state.

Only by constantly establishing the substance of the Dao through tranquility can one obtain true lead and mercury as the function of the Dao. When using these two substances—lead and mercury—to unite the primordial, they coalesce into one. The proper thought immediately retreats and conceals itself, congealing into profound stillness. Within thought, there is no thought—thus, in an instant, they congeal, returning to the moment when my born body first received qi.

Confucius said, "Essence and qi become things," does this not refer to the true body formed by the congealing of lead and mercury? Laozi said, "There is a thing, undifferentiated and complete," does this not refer to the Great Primordial formed by the congealing of yin and yang? Master Zhang Ziyang said, "Grasp the foundation of Kan and Li, and the three realms return to one body," does this not refer to the pivotal method of practicing the two eights to refine the Golden Elixir?

Thus, lead and mercury are yin and yang; the union of yin and yang is the Great Primordial; the Great Primordial is the true body. The true body, the Great Primordial, is my prenatal "one that becomes two." When timely united, it becomes "two that return to one." Now, one can suddenly awaken!

**Chapter One (conclusion)**
This entire chapter serves as the guiding principle, revealing that body and heart, nature and life, spirit and qi, medicine and fire—all are complete from the very beginning of one’s existence. Thus, it spares no effort in clearly expounding the original source of human life to aid practitioners in personal realization. The following eighty chapters are all annotations to this chapter.

The next seven chapters systematically elucidate the methods of gathering, uniting, and refining. Chapters nine through fifteen teach the secrets of beginning practice. Chapters sixteen through twenty-four expound on the crucial openings, detailing the processes of refinement, bathing, guarding against danger, contemplating risks, as well as the methods of separating the embryo, nurturing, and forming the elixir. Chapters twenty-five through forty-eight re-emphasize the central tenets, unfolding the true mechanism so that readers may have all doubts dispelled.

From chapters forty-nine to sixty-eight, the text clearly instructs on returning postnatal essence and qi to prenatal spirit and qi to form the Valley Spirit. From the Valley Spirit, one refines the yang-spirit, and from the yang-spirit, one further refines to restore the primordial spirit—ultimately returning the primordial spirit to the true Non-Ultimate to become a True Person, thus merging with the Dao in truth. The completion of the Golden Elixir directly reveals the ancient sages’ intent to thoroughly investigate principle, fulfill nature, and attain life—this teaching is earnestly imparted with meticulous steps.

The final three chapters once more invoke the heart-transmission of the ancient sages, earnestly urging the necessary union of spirit and qi, body and heart, nature and life, thereby summarizing the entire work’s meaning. If a practitioner has truly cultivated the work of refining the self, concentrating qi and unifying spirit, holding fast to the singular, numinous, and upright thought, then facing this text, they will naturally perceive the method as exceedingly simple and can immediately enter the Dao through seated practice.

Mercury is the marrow of the Azure Dragon; lead is the fat of the White Tiger. The yin-essence within the heart originally emerges from the fissure of the root of nature. Here, it is called the marrow of the Azure Dragon because alchemists use the Azure Dragon to symbolize the hun-soul. In the prenatal hexagram positions, it belongs to Li, residing in the east—thus Master Zhang referred to it as "the Wood of the Eastern Hun." The prenatal hun-soul remains concealed within Qian, unmoving. In the postnatal state, Qian becomes hollow at its center, transforming into Li. Li resides in the south and pertains to fire—thus Master Zhang also called it "the Fire of the Southern Spirit."

This hun-soul is stored in the liver, though it still resides in the east, its hexagram has already transformed into the moving image of Zhen, prone to anger. Its function relies on the heart to become spirit, for the heart is the abode of spirit. The yin-essence now spilling from my heart originally arises from the prenatal root-qi to become mercury—previously likened to "water within fire," yet in truth, it is the fluid of Wood. Thus it is called the marrow of the Azure Dragon, meaning it requires refinement.

The yang-qi within the body originally draws forth from the stem of life. Now called the fat of the White Tiger, alchemists use the White Tiger to symbolize the po-soul. In the prenatal hexagram positions, it belongs to Kan, residing in the west—thus Master Zhang referred to it as "the Metal of the Western Po." The prenatal po-soul remains concealed within Kun, unmanifest. In the postnatal state, Kun becomes replete at its center, transforming into Kan. Kan resides in the north and pertains to water—thus Master Zhang also called it "the Water of the Northern Essence."

This po-soul is stored in the lungs, though it still resides in the west, its hexagram has already transformed into the joyous image of Dui, inclined toward gentleness. Its function depends on the body to become essence, for the body is where essence congeals. The yang-qi now surging within me originally stems from the prenatal Metal-qi to become lead—previously likened to "fire within water," yet in truth, it is the fluid of Metal. Thus it is called the fat of the White Tiger, meaning it requires smelting.

Gather them into the crucible; the timing of their gathering must be known.

This speaks of the moment when the two substances, essence and qi, arise—precisely the time for their gathering. The method lies solely in summoning them at will to unite, returning them to the crucible. Thus Kan, now hollow at its center, reverts to Kun, while Li, now replete at its core, returns to Qian. When essence and qi merge within the crucible, Qian and Kun likewise unite to restore the Supreme Polarity. This is called the "elixir head," which Master Zhang termed the "true seed."

To return is to store; the crucible is the orthodox transmission of the *Yi*’s Dao. The alchemists’ watchword has no visible form—it resides at the very center of the sixfold harmony within this body. As the ancients said, "Within lies a true golden crucible," yet it has no fixed location to confine it. The *Yi* states, "The crucible: the noble person rectifies their position and consolidates their mandate."

The "time" refers to the moment when *gui* arises—half of the "living midnight." If one has not yet awakened, one should sit upright in meditation as practice. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, this is the time of *gui*’s arising. Swiftly withdraw the proper thought and conceal it in secrecy for gathering; any diversion of intent will fail. This must not be sought elsewhere.

In sum: the yang-qi within Kan is true lead; the yin-essence within Li is true mercury. Kan and Li give birth to lead and mercury, while lead and mercury arise from body and mind. The function of body and mind is essence and qi, and the substance of essence and qi is nature and life. Extracting the yang from Kan returns it to Kun; filling the void in Li restores it to Qian. These two substances are like a wellspring—qi is primordial qi, essence transforms into spirit. When spirit and qi interact, Kan and Li revert to Kun and Qian. As they wondrously merge and congeal, Qian and Kun blend into the Supreme Polarity. From this point, yin and yang, movement and stillness become each other’s root, binding inseparably, harmonizing indistinguishably, and uniting purely without end.

Is this not the simplest and easiest method of gathering?

The maiden rides the lead tiger,
The golden elder straddles the mercury dragon.
The maiden is true mercury,
The golden elder is true lead.
Their names and meanings are detailed in Chapter Ten.
The tiger symbolizes the body,
The dragon symbolizes the mind.
Master Zhang said, "The mind’s wildness is like a dragon,
The body’s ferocity is like a tiger."
"Rides" and "straddles" describe the image of mutual mastery.
When the two medicines are gathered into the crucible,
Yin-essence naturally masters yang-qi,
And yang-qi governs yin-essence,
Forming an undifferentiated whole.
Yet if at this moment tranquility is lacking,
The spirit scatters outward,
And the elixir head dissolves.
One must await the renewed gathering of lead and mercury,
Hence the following admonition to clarify the proper command.

---

*Jia* and *geng* clarify the proper command,
Refining to forge a furnace of red.
*Jia*, belonging to wood, symbolizes nature;
*Geng*, belonging to metal, symbolizes indolence.
The "proper command" is an unbiased decree—
What Confucius called "straightening what is upright,"
What Master Bai termed "the movement of thought as the Mysterious Female,"
And the *Wenyan* of Kun’s second line describes as "the noble person’s reverence to straighten within."
To "clarify the proper command" is to first understand it in ordinary times,
So that when the moment arrives, a single reaffirmation suffices,
And all parts naturally obey.
At the first union of essence and qi,
One must ensure tranquility of nature and ease of emotion
To preserve harmony without dissipation.
The method relies on the power of reverence and sincerity cultivated in advance.
While the mind has not yet stirred,
Swiftly clarify the Dao of nurturing uprightness,
First concealing it in secrecy,
So that within thought there is no thought.
Essence congeals with qi to form spirit,
Emotion returns to nature in great stillness,
And the elixir head solidifies without risk of leakage—
What Mencius called "nurturing with uprightness and causing no harm."
"A furnace of red" is what alchemists call
"A furnace of flame forging emptiness,
The very path of refinement,"
What Mencius termed "fullness radiating brilliance."

The serpent’s po seizes the dragon’s marrow,
The tortoise’s hun subdues the tiger’s essence.
The serpent symbolizes emotion,
Which often responds to gentleness with joy—
The work of the po-soul, hence "serpent’s po."
The "dragon’s marrow" symbolizes the yin-essence within the mind.
The tortoise symbolizes nature,
Which often reacts to shock with anger—
The work of the hun-soul, hence "tortoise’s hun."
The "tiger’s essence" symbolizes the yang-qi within the body.
This continues from the previous chapter:
When the proper command is clarified,
Emotion is forgotten and returns to its original nature,
Thus the wild dragon of the mind is captured.
As essence ceases to waver and nature stabilizes,
The root of emotion is severed,
So the ferocious tiger of the body is subdued,
And qi no longer stagnates.
"Seizes" and "subdues" are but acting without contrivance—
As the saying goes, "The tiger is tamed, the dragon is lowered,
The macaque no longer peers through the six windows."
Does this not describe it?

Within the divine waters of the Flowery Pond,
A single bud of jade fat takes form.
Master Zhang states: "When lead meets mercury, it is called the Flowery Ground; when mercury enters lead, it is called the Divine Water."
In my humble understanding of Master Zhang’s intent:
Lead symbolizes the body, likened to a pond—
When mercury appears, its qi flourishes, hence the name *Flowery Pond*.
Mercury symbolizes the mind, called water—
As it moves in and out of lead, the spirit is invigorated, hence the name *Divine Water*.
When mercury and lead harmonize,
It is but a metaphor for Divine Water entering the Flowery Pond—
In truth, it is only the spirit returning and the body’s qi naturally restored!
When lead and mercury have congealed,
Emotion is forgotten and nature stabilizes,
The spirit enters qi as water returns to the pond.
There is a master ever wakeful,
Like a flower budding with sap, blossoming in joy;
Or jade congealing into fat, dense and solid in form—
Such are the metaphors.
○ Chapter Four above.
This continues from the previous chapter, elucidating that once the two substances have united,
Nature and emotion are rectified, their substance undivided—
Thus the elixir’s foundation is established!

White snow flies in the jasper garden,
Yellow sprouts emerge in the jade orchard.

"White snow" refers to the body belonging to *kan* (☵). Within *kan*, the single yang is *qian*-metal, hence its color is white. The generation of lead within the body arises from the overflowing of metal-qi; when it encounters mercury and transforms into divine water, bright, pure, and crystalline, it takes on the appearance of snow. *Jasper garden* is a metaphor for the body.

"Yellow sprouts" refers to the heart belonging to *li* (☲). Within *li*, the single yin is *kun*-earth, hence its color is yellow. The generation of mercury within the heart arises from the abundance of wood-fluid; when it meets lead and congeals, it enters the Flowery Pond, blending and flourishing—thus taking on the appearance of sprouting. *Jade orchard* likewise metaphorically refers to this body.

"Flying" and "emerging" describe how, when lead receives the union of mercury, it ascends and permeates, its momentum poised to scatter across the sky; when mercury receives the congealment of lead, it descends and flows, its momentum poised to flourish across the earth.

Master Zixian Xuezi said: *"Without white snow, there are no yellow sprouts. White snow is the divine water of the spirit-chamber; yellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi-pivot."* This serves as verification!

Yet one must not seek them with intention.

Yet if one can resemble the recumbent moon, where then is the forging of red lead?

To resemble the recumbent moon is but a transformed image of the original mysterious aperture. Before the elixir is obtained within this body, one maintains inner purity and guards the One—all seven apertures return to the single aperture. Within it, emptiness and numinous clarity stand open, round and whole as an egg, for in stillness it contracts. When the elixir arises, the moment one’s true command arrives, the aperture turns upward like a vessel to receive the medicine, for as it is about to move, it also begins to open. Viewed from the side at that moment, its form resembles the recumbent moon. Once the medicine is received and merges into darkness, it returns to the egg-like guarding. For the instant a thought stirs, it settles again—the mysterious aperture opens only to contract once more. If moved by emotion and the heart stirs, the aperture will open into seven, and the medicine scatters. Thus, the ability to resemble the recumbent moon serves as verification of receiving the medicine. Yet this describes only its likeness, for it arises spontaneously, without form or substance to behold.

Red lead, as Master Zhang states, is “true lead born in Kan, whose function lies in the Li palace”—the transformation from black to red. Yet even this has no color or appearance. To ask “where is it forged” is to remind that spirit has no fixed form, warning against attachment to deliberate action. This is what Mencius meant by “there must be doing, yet without fixation.”

In essence, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at all times. If one can only clarify the true command, no external distractions will intrude. Within, it will naturally receive at all times. Over time, with qi abundant and spirit full, the Valley Spirit will naturally be replete.

For the cultivator, at first one suffers from not knowing the aperture; once the aperture is understood, one must vigilantly guard against its severance. Withdrawal and concealment beforehand are essential—purity and stillness are wondrously subtle. If one can withdraw and conceal beforehand, then when the moment arrives, one will not miss the opportunity, and subsequent thoughts will not disturb. Knowing this, the heart can be rectified!

Above, Chapter Five.

Building upon the previous chapter, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at every moment, and the more one gathers, the more inexhaustible they become. Yet one must never turn the mind to calculation or measurement, for then this inner realm will naturally receive—absolutely no contrivance should be employed to hasten the process. This is what Master Zhang meant by “one grain begets another, from the subtle to the manifest,” speaking only of the grandeur of accumulation, without any form or image to liken it to.

The medicinal material opens the primordial chaos; the fire-tending refines the vast expanse.
The “medicinal material” is the term used at the moment of gathering; the “fire-tending” is the designation during the process of refinement—both refer to this essence and qi. To say “opening the primordial chaos” and “refining the vast expanse” means that this essence and qi emerge only in the midst of purity and stillness, when the seven apertures return to one, like the unmanifest within chaos, naturally unfolding. Refining it with the intent of purity, without distinguishing inner or outer, is like the formless vastness of the primordial state, naturally coalescing into success. This clarifies the earlier teachings on the true command and the waning moon, instructing one to grasp it with a mind free of effort, rather than through labored striving.

After ten months, the immortal embryo transforms—only then does one recognize the work of the nine revolutions.
“Transformation” is what Master Bai referred to as “shattering emptiness to reach completion,” the same as the later “transcendence of the embryo and spiritual transformation.” The “nine revolutions” are the nine returns. Nine is the completion number of metal, signifying the return of the yang qi within the body, not nine literal cycles. It means that when the medicinal material arises from nothing, one must refine it like the great creation’s primordial vastness, without pausing to assess its appearance. Only after three hundred days, when the embryo is complete, does one realize the work of gathering the body’s original yang qi when first forming the elixir.

Above, Chapter Six.
Here, it speaks of obtaining the elixir and refining it, without clinging to form or seeking signs—its efficacy will become known in time. As the *Canticle* says, “Do not seek through examination.”

Where the dragon rightly conceals its pearl, where the hen just broods her egg—
who knows when lead and mercury unite? Precisely then may one drink the *daogui*.
“Concealing the pearl” and “brooding the egg” illustrate the wondrousness of the aperture. The *Inner Landscape* states: “Once one knows to return all to the single aperture, one has grasped the method of dwelling in secrecy—simply be like the dragon nurturing its pearl, like the hen brooding her egg, with spirit unwaveringly fixed.” The word “who” carries profound meaning. My teacher, Master Taixu, in his commentary on the *Nine Heavens’ Heart-Seal Repentance Text*, said: “Neither self nor other, inexpressible yet forcibly called—‘who.’” The word “who” appears eleven times in this text, and each instance may be understood in this light. To say “who knows when lead and mercury unite” means only to conceal the spirit in secrecy, guarding purity and stillness, without distinguishing what is other or primary, what is self or guest, nor even whether the two substances have merged—this is true seamless union.

The *daogui* refers to the two earths, wu and ji, both numbered five, originally sharing the central position. After generation, they lodge in Kan and Li—Kan’s yang is the essence of wu earth, Li’s yin is the essence of ji earth. The ancients spoke of this as the principle of Kan-Li and the *daogui*; earlier scholars called it “the essence of the two fives”... to clarify that when Kan’s wu and Li’s ji meet, there is no intervening substance, and they unite in the center—hence *daogui*. It teaches that one should employ only the initial intent, which is the true command, the same as what the earlier sages called “the true of the limitless” and “the wondrous union of the two fives, congealed.”

Laozi’s *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness* says: “Without form, without emotion, without name—forced to name it, call it the Dao.” This is the true meaning of my teacher’s explanation of “who”—it is the Dao that may be employed when meeting the origin. The first thought after the initial one is already attachment; though correct, it has fallen into the postnatal, instantly turning into deliberation, and the two earths become separated by the nature of wood and the disposition of metal. Qi, being Kan’s wu, flows into breathing, and the water palace cannot preserve its source; essence, being Li’s ji, seeps into the bladder, and the spirit chamber cannot secure its dwelling. Thus, water-essence and fire-spirit cannot assist each other, and the four images are no longer at one’s disposal—how then can lead and mercury unite to congeal the immortal embryo? Therefore, the cultivator must take the ability to drink the *daogui* as the proper method for uniting lead and mercury. To say “precisely then may one drink” means that at the moment when lead and mercury first arise—when the heavenly heart’s stillness first stirs into the true command—this is when the two substances have congealed and may be refined. It does not say “use” but “drink,” implying the self-awareness of drinking water or broth, hot or cold. Where my intent is aware, refinement naturally follows, illustrating the wondrous function of the true command, where within use there is correct awareness—still, only purity and unbroken density are the work. From this, one may know that a moment’s effort already encompasses refinement. For the union occurs at the stirring of the thought, in an instant; refinement, self-contained and withdrawn, requires a moment’s duration to become firm. The union arises naturally; refinement is what congeals it. Thus, before the union, one works within the workless work, sitting in meditation to prepare for gathering. When the medicine arises, one practices effortless use within useful use, abiding in great stillness without thought or action—this is refinement. This is the subtlety within subtlety—how easily can it be spoken? Yet having spoken it, the words are already overly verbose. Let the reader condense and refine, apprehend it spiritually—it rests with the person.

Above, Chapter Seven.
This continues the previous chapter, elucidating the Dao of refinement: one need only maintain unbroken continuity, as Master Bai said, “Guarding against interruption and lack of focus.”

Bathing relies on the Water of Kun, breath revives through the Wind of Xun.
At this stage, if thoughts are not sealed tightly, the fire scatters, and the body feels chilled. Yet when one clarifies the true mandate, the spirit returns to the center and qi naturally flows back—there arises a direct qi that steams through the entire body for bathing, and warmth returns. This is called "relying on the Water of Kun": as one’s bodily form has already transformed into the primordial, the northern position is no longer the postnatal Kan trigram, so this natural bathing qi is termed the Water of Kun. If distracting thoughts arise and disturb, the fire becomes impure, and the body feels restless and hot. Yet when one turns back to the correct mindfulness to quell agitation, the inner stillness remains undisturbed, and true breath gently blows, bringing coolness throughout—harmony returns. This is called "relying on the Wind of Xun": as one’s Kun body has reverted to the primordial, the southwest region is originally the Xun palace of the nose, so this natural breath is termed the Wind of Xun. This is the wondrous remedy for balancing cold and warmth—when the spirit returns, qi follows of itself, and one need not seek it in the qi aspect. Master Bai took vigilant awareness as "conducting the fire," the steaming of true qi as "bathing," and stilling thoughts as "nurturing the fire"—his method is precise indeed!

The infant has no affairs, dwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity.
The infant refers to the spirit formed when the yin essence within the heart has coalesced with yang qi, now returning to reside in the original palace of the Celestial Valley—called the Valley Spirit. The ancients likened it to an infant, for at this stage its spiritual power is still weak and requires one’s correct mindfulness to constantly sustain and guard it. The Palace of Grand Tenuity, in the heavens, is the Grand Tenuity Enclosure with the imperial seat at its center; in the human body, it is the central palace among the nine palaces of the head—the Mud Pill Palace, the abode where the Valley Spirit resides to nurture the true. My teacher often said: "The infant is the true person—it must be in a state of leisure and non-use, idly and alone nurturing the primordial spirit." His meaning is profound! This is the light of self-nature. Within the human body, only this is true nurturance; when the true body manifests, it is the Perfected One of the wondrous Dao.

Above, Chapter Eight.
This continues the previous chapter, stating that after refinement comes bathing. If cold or warmth becomes unbalanced, it is always due to the spirit straying outward or thoughts disturbing within—one must swiftly correct the fault. Guarding the infant, dwelling alone in the upper valley, practicing non-action and stillness, allowing qi to circulate naturally—this is the remedy for harmony, without need to startle the spirit. If the spirit is startled, it clings to phenomena and remains adrift in the cycle of birth and death. From the previous chapter to this, the principles of the elixir foundation, gathering, union, refinement, and bathing are fully expounded. Yet the essential teaching lies in sustaining mindfulness for gathering, concealing mindfulness for absorption, stilling the spirit for union as delusions vanish, concentrating qi for refinement, and absence of delusion for congealing. When delusion vanishes, correct mindfulness endures; when correct mindfulness is concealed, delusion does not arise—the method is upright, simple, and unburdensome. The following seven chapters continue from this, elucidating the principles of nurturing, parting the embryo, and forging—all emphasizing pure stillness, complete non-action, to be inwardly realized and personally practiced. The phrase "concentrating qi" comes from the *Daodejing*, meaning one should be as self-sufficient in qi as an infant, practicing this without mental contrivance.

In the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li; in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan.

At the matchmaking of the Yellow Matron, the Great Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.
The Purple Palace is an analogy for my body; the Vermilion Mound, for my heart; the Yellow Matron, for my intent.

In my humble interpretation: The postnatal body corresponds to the northern Kan trigram, Kan belonging to Water, its color originally black. To revert to the prenatal Kun trigram, one must seek the Yin within the southern Li to receive it. Li belongs to Fire, its color vermilion; vermilion and black blend to form purple—hence "in the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li." The Maiden is the Yin within Li, meaning the postnatal Kan body reverts to the prenatal Kun body. The postnatal heart corresponds to the southern Li trigram; to revert to the prenatal Qian trigram, one must seek the Yang within the northern Kan to pair with it. The Vermilion Mound is the name of a cavern on the Southern Marchmount, used as an analogy for the heart’s abode—hence "in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan." The Youth is the Yang within Kan, meaning the postnatal Li heart reverts to the prenatal Qian heart.

Yellow is the color of Earth; *pó* is an honorific for an elder woman. The Yellow Matron thus refers to one’s correct mindfulness. It speaks of refining the postnatal heart and body: first, within the body, seek the Yin essence of the heart to pair with the Yang qi of the body. When Yang qi obtains Yin essence, it courses straight through; the Yin essence, relying on Yang qi, is refined into spirit, which then returns to its original palace, the Valley of Mystery—all depending on one’s correct mindfulness first withdrawing to mediate in secret. Thus, the Three of body, heart, and intent are embraced as one Great Ultimate, forming this Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit’s arising is the congealing of essence and qi; correct mindfulness remains singular, its command clear. It naturally merges within, yet claims no merit—hence "the Great Ultimate naturally embraces the Three."

○ Above, Chapter Nine.
This continues the previous chapter, elucidating how body and heart revert—solely by relying on one’s sincere intent to secretly unite as one aperture. The following chapter will expound upon this repeatedly.

The Qian horse drives the Metal Gate, the Kun ox enters the Wood Palace.
Metal symbolizes emotion—once Vermilion Mound is paired with the Kan youth to form Qian, one may employ the Dao of firm strength to govern emotion, so the spirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, ever dwelling in Heavenly Valley to nurture nature. Yet who brings this about?
Wood symbolizes inherent nature—once Purple Court is united with the Li maiden to form Kun, one may employ the virtue of gentle compliance to guide inherent nature, so qi naturally fills the void, ever attending Mud Pill to nurture life. Yet who truly enables this?

Ah, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?
The maiden is the Yin essence within Li, entering Kan to become Kun—since she returns from Li to Kun as qi, she bears the image of a maiden returning to her dwelling, hence the Alchemical Maiden.
The Metal Elder is the Yang qi within Kan, entering Li to become Qian—since he returns from Kan to Qian and transforms into spirit, he bears the image of youth maturing into age, hence the Metal Elder.
"Wedding" speaks of Yin essence departing Li to enter Kan, thereby pairing Kun with Qian, illustrating how the heart becomes the dwelling of the body and the body becomes the vessel of the heart, evoking the image of a bride following her husband.
When Yin essence departs Li for Kan, Yang qi’s departure from Kan to enter Li goes without saying!
At that time, had my correct command not illuminated its virtue, foreseeing the future and concealing the past, how could qi nurture form to achieve compliance, or essence refine into spirit to achieve strength?
Now, with compliant form paired to steadfast spirit, wondrously merging into the profound obscurity of the Great Ultimate, nature and emotion each attain their proper place—whose power is this?

The Metal Gate refers to the Dui trigram, Dui being the image of Qian’s metal gate; the Qian horse driving the Metal Gate symbolizes the *Guai* hexagram, when Yang qi is already abundant.
The original palace refers to the Gen trigram, Gen being the image of Kun earth harnessing wood as its palace; the Kun ox entering its original palace symbolizes the *Bo* hexagram, when Yin essence is already abundant.
The Alchemical Maiden refers to the single Yin atop *Bo*, returning to her dwelling to form Kun; the Metal Elder refers to the *Guai* image.
"Ah, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?" echoes the alchemical saying of "half a catty matching eight ounces."
For the four Yang hexagrams contain eight Yang lines as half a catty, while the four Yin hexagrams contain eight Yin lines as eight ounces—together they form the eight trigrams as a full catty.
This speaks of the moment when Yin and Yang are equally robust: without the habitual reverence of sincerity and the tempered resolve of unwavering faith, who could withdraw the heart to conceal it in secrecy, allowing the single Yang atop *Bo* to naturally pair with *Guai* to form Qian, even as the single Yin atop *Guai* returns to *Bo* to form Kun?
Thus, the body fully embodies Kun’s compliance to nurture qi, while the spirit returns to Qian’s steadfastness to govern form.
From this, the origins of generation and life are renewed, cycling through *Gou* and *Fu*, their transformations boundless.
Here, the meaning of the next chapter’s "cavern chamber generating auspicious qi" is also elucidated, appearing more direct.
Yet in the highest alchemical teachings, earlier masters framed their words within the principles of the *Yijing*, not through hexagrams or lines, but by pointing directly to concrete realities, making them accessible to all.
For those with prior learning, one may observe the images and ponder the words to penetrate the profound meaning; for beginners, however, language laden with classical allusions may instead obstruct their perception.
Thus, in annotating this text, it is fitting to focus on the tangible elements within the human body, speaking plainly and concretely, so that all may see and know without needing to seek images or delve into abstractions—thereby upholding our teacher’s compassionate vow of universal deliverance.
This chapter, prompted by the "Metal Gate" and "Wood Palace" images left unaddressed in the primary commentary, clarifies their meaning lest it be lost to heterodox interpretations. It thus employs the *Guai* and *Bo* hexagrams to illustrate their mutual transformation into *Gou* and *Fu*, averting the calamity of excess and the regret of overweening Yang. May all reflect upon this.

○ Above, Chapter Ten.
This elaborates on the preceding chapter’s principle of reverting to the primordial, all depending on the habitual practice of concealing correct mindfulness.
For since the initial coalescence of the elixir’s essence, spirit and qi have grown daily stronger, gradually enabling the separation of the embryo—one must then redouble efforts to preserve abundance, conceal spirit, and nurture qi.

The Alchemical Maiden is but sixteen, the Metal Elder precisely nine-three.
The Alchemical Maiden symbolizes the qi transformed from my Yin essence, sixteen being the number of a full catty, denoting sufficient measure.
The Metal Elder symbolizes the spirit congealed from my Yang qi, nine-three signifying inner Yang’s fulfillment, akin to Qian’s inner trigram reaching its third line.
This speaks of the stage in elixir refinement when the body’s spirit and qi are both robust, poised to separate the embryo—yet often unsettled by restlessness, if one indulges impatience, qi will agitate the heart, and the Valley Spirit will struggle to remain tranquil.
Nothing full fails to overflow, so the text specifies "precisely sixteen" and "exactly nine-three" to clarify the firing times, teaching one to remain vigilant in due season, neither arrogant nor anxious. Thus, inner beauty is contained, anger and desire do not arise, and the embryo’s separation incurs no fault.

The cavern chamber generates auspicious qi, their joyous union produces the firstborn son.
The cavern chamber symbolizes my body, the secret aperture within.
"Generating auspicious qi" refers to the vigorous stirring of Yang qi within my body, the very sign of primordial life’s return and the nascent foundation of Yang spirit.
"Producing the firstborn son" speaks of the initial conception of Yang spirit, like *Zhen* as the eldest son, superimposed upon Qian to form the image of *Lei Tian Da Zhuang*—a single Yang stirring in the outer trigram.
At this stage, with the body’s qi already robust and the spirit further concealed, Yang qi suddenly surges, instantly uniting with the spirit. In that moment, the Valley Spirit transforms into Yang spirit.

Just as the firstborn son is newly born, this is the return of primordial life—here the Valley Spirit achieves success, and one may preserve the spirit to attain immortality.

**Chapter Eleven.**
This describes the phenomenon of primordial life’s return, elucidating the Dao of natural embryo separation. Should one read this and attain realization:
When Yang flourishes to the point of overcoming, this is the image of the *Guài* hexagram. Swiftly withdrawing and concealing oneself, the upper trigram reverts to the initial Yang. This is what Confucius meant by “knowing the future and concealing the past.” *Guài* interchanges with *Gòu*, just as *Bō* interchanges with *Fù*—from this, Yang spirit takes its foundational birth. Only then does one understand why the “use of nine” and “use of six” are both auspicious and without regret.

Last night on the western riverbank,
Toad-light illumined the jade-green waves.
Gathered and brought to the jade chamber,
Within the crucible, the sun’s searing blaze.

“Last night” refers to the time of primordial life’s return. The West is the *Kǎn* hexagram’s primordial position; *Kǎn* is Water, hence “western river.” The toad, originally lunar radiance, is called “toad-light” to symbolize the upward breakthrough of Yang qi. Whenever the text speaks of the Yang spirit’s initial foundation, it invariably compares it to the toad, alluding to its three legs and the upward breakthrough of Yang light. The “jade-green waves” symbolize the post-heaven bodily image of the *Kǎn* hexagram’s qi—*Kǎn* Water is inherently black, but when illuminated by toad-light, the water turns jade-green, hence “jade-green waves.” The “jade chamber” symbolizes my body, for once primordial life has returned, spirit and qi become dense and refined, thus called the jade chamber. “Within the crucible” refers to the spirit chamber. “Searing blaze” alludes to the method of “refining with focused qi” and “tempering through non-delusion.” It means that in the past, my primordial life’s return arose from the post-heaven *Kǎn* image’s abundant spirit and qi. Suddenly, Yang qi surged upward, breaking through the Celestial Valley, merging with spirit to transform into Yang spirit. Now, the body has reverted to the primordial, the *Kūn* image has resumed its northern position, and *Kǎn* has retreated to the West. Tracing back, it is like last night on the western riverbank, witnessing the toad’s light illuminating the water. I then gathered it and brought it into the spirit chamber, refining it so that it seethes and tempers itself—yet one feels only a gentle warmth, with no visible sign of searing blaze. Thus, it transforms into Yang spirit, and life is restored! This is the Dao of the jade tally preserving the spirit, so the Valley Spirit may not die.

**Chapter Twelve.**
This continues from the previous chapter, stating that once primordial life has returned, one must preserve and harmonize the Great Harmony to ensure proper advantage.

*Lí* and *Kǎn* do not copulate,
*Qián* and *Kūn* spontaneously generate.
One who understands this principle
Lets a single point descend into the Yellow Court.

It means that in the past, my post-heaven heart and body united, nominally called “conjunction,” like the sun and moon conjoining in the same palace—yet not true copulation. At this moment of life’s return, though called the copulation of *Qián* and *Kūn*, it is merely spirit congealing and qi gathering, naturally generating a perfect Great Ultimate. Should one grasp this principle, then all that the alchemical classics describe—“a single Yang within the body, a single Yin within the heart,” referring to two things—are but different names for the same origin. Their encounter naturally merges into a single right thought; when thought subsides and returns to the hidden, it descends into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court refers to a single aperture, the very secret place—yellow being the central true color, and court signifying the void and empty expanse, hence the name. Yet one must not seek it through form or appearance.

**Chapter Thirteen.**

Building upon the preceding chapters, this elucidates the essential principle that the beginning and end of the alchemical Dao all arise from spontaneity, and that the two must merge into one.

Within the Cinnabar Valley, spirit-water is born;
In the Yellow Court lies the Great Granary.
No longer thoughts of hunger or thirst arise—
Straightaway one enters the immortal realm.

The Cinnabar Valley is another name for the Crimson Palace within the human body; the Yellow Court has already been discussed in the previous chapter. Here it is said that the central valley naturally generates qi, which spirals upward from the lower valley to meet the spirit, thereby producing spirit-water that irrigates the entire body. Thus, the Valley Spirit also receives qi in audience, just as the Great Granary ceaselessly stores and then releases spirit-water to fill the whole body. Within the body, there is naturally a nectar that irrigates without thirst, without any appearance of overflow; the Valley Spirit itself possesses a sustenance that sates without hunger, without any form of accumulation. Knowing this, one may dispense with all worldly theories of nourishment, and the heart will be free from any fear of hunger or thirst. If even hunger and thirst need not be feared, what other thoughts could arise? One may then settle the mind and withdraw, directly reaching the immortal realm—this is the teaching of a single thought unarisen, all illusions at rest.

This continues the above chapters, instructing one to hold fast to the right thought, withdraw into the hidden as the work, and never allow the mind to stray into other concerns, lest one err on the great path to immortality.

The intent-steed returns to the spirit-chamber;
The heart-ape guards the grotto-chamber.
With single-minded withdrawal, the spirit naturally does not scatter—once returned to the hidden, it is the Heavenly Heart. All conditions released, the heart abides within the body; seizing this state of non-doing, it too withdraws into the hidden.

Spirit, essence, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent—
Transform into Purple Gold Frost.
Essence is stored in the kidneys; when kidney qi is complete, essence rests securely in the kidney viscus, and one attains wisdom.
Spirit is stored in the heart; when heart qi is complete, spirit rests securely in the heart viscus, and one attains propriety.
The ethereal soul is stored in the liver; when liver qi is complete, the ethereal soul rests securely in the liver viscus, and one attains benevolence.
The corporeal soul is stored in the lungs; when lung qi is complete, the corporeal soul rests securely in the lung viscus, and one attains righteousness.
Intent is stored in the spleen; when spleen qi is complete, intent rests securely in the spleen viscus, and one attains trustworthiness.
Thus, the five viscera each hold one qi and each possess one virtue. If one can make intent sincere and the heart upright, then the five qi are all complete and each rests in its proper viscus, and the five virtues are also complete. This is the Confucian teaching of "unity throughout" and "withdrawal into the hidden," which is the alchemical method of gathering the five phases into a single aperture. When the five qi converge as one, they can congeal into spirit—this spirit is the elixir. The "elixir" of the Quanzhen school is what the Confucian school calls "benevolence," like the kernel within a fruit. It is called "purple" because the initial golden elixir is formed from the union of water and fire—water is black, fire is red, and their intermingling produces purple, as when Master Guan Yin saw Laozi’s qi as purple. It is not called "elixir" but "frost" lest one cling to the word and mistake it for a physical pellet, thereby accumulating delusive thoughts and causing qi blockages in the body, which would be a grave error. Thus, it is likened to frost formed from scattered dew: visible in its traces yet ungraspable when gathered, evoking the image of empty space pulverized. This describes the wondrous arising of the golden elixir within the formless to become true form—hence, Purple Gold Frost.

These two chapters further demonstrate that human cultivation and nurturance share the same work as heaven and earth. How so?

Heaven suspends its images to cover all things, yet it nurtures only the imageless—thus its images grow ever more luminous, perpetually covering the myriad things without end. Earth solidifies its form to bear all things, yet it nurtures only the formless—thus its form grows ever more vast and deep, perpetually bearing the myriad things without leakage. Man dwells in form to complete all things, yet if he can nurture the formless, his form will endure ever longer, encompassing the transformations of heaven and earth without transgression, shaping the myriad things without omission. Thus may he attain longevity and lasting vision, his wisdom pervading all categories, his blessings flowing beyond the world, standing as the third between heaven and earth.

Master Bai Zi once said: *"If man is not burdened by form, the world before his eyes is the Great Luo Heaven."* He also said: *"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness, forget emptiness to merge with the Dao."* This single word "forget" is itself the absence of things. *"Originally there was not a single thing—where could dust alight?"* Why then cling to distinctions of what is essence, what is spirit, what is hun or po or intent? All returns to the single secret of nurturing the formless. Simply allow the natural flow of qi-transformation to fulfill the utmost sincerity of one’s inherent nature without cease.

The above concludes Chapter Fifteen. This continues the themes of the preceding chapters, elucidating the immaterial nature of the golden elixir and instructing how to begin the work. It is nothing more than sincerity without duality, nurturing the formless to merge with the imageless and formless—then true qi naturally flows through heaven and earth, and primordial spirit naturally gathers within the body, all achieved through the wondrous subtlety of inherent clarity and stillness. This is what Li Níwán called the *"Three-One Sound-Symbol"* and what Master Zhang referred to as *"Grasping the foundation of Kan and Li, the three realms return to one body."*

From the first chapter to this point, the text forms a comprehensive summation. The following nine chapters expound upon the key apertures and the nurturing of the elixir, further clarifying the meanings of the preceding chapters.

---

One aperture, three passes—the three passes are the crucial junctures.
Suddenly moving lightly, the divine water flows throughout.

This "one aperture" refers to the single aperture where the seven orifices return to their root. The "three passes" denote the refinement of essence into qi as the lower pass, the refinement of qi into spirit as the middle pass, and the refinement of spirit into emptiness as the upper pass—the highest-grade path of elixir refinement. Some identify the three passes as the post-mortem locations of the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow (lower, middle, upper), while others locate them in the front of the body as the magpie bridge, cinnabar palace, and pass of origin (upper, middle, lower). Our tradition also adopts this interpretation for its utility in establishing the foundation: dredging the Governing and Conception Vessels to dissolve long-standing illnesses and impurities, thereby enabling the later unimpeded flow of true qi. Yet this is achieved solely through emptying thoughts and forgetting emotions, without further contrivance. Here, however, the "three passes" need not be confined to such interpretations.

The "aperture" refers precisely to this single aperture within the true body—the pivotal juncture where essence accumulates, qi gathers, and spirit congeals. Simply abide in emptiness and stillness, nurturing to the point of formlessness, and suddenly the lead and mercury respond in unison, essence having transformed into qi, naturally ascending to the valley—this is the five qi returning to the origin. At that moment, spirit and qi interact, qi transforms into spirit, spirit congeals and qi gathers, then transmutes into divine water suffusing the entire body—this is divine water entering the flower pool. Allow it to circulate and move without pause, naturally and spontaneously, beyond the grasp of cognition, while one’s spirit remains settled in unshakable stillness—hence the three flowers gathering at the crown.

Through this, I realized that the transformation of essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness to merge with the Dao depends solely on the mutual forgetting of heart and breath within the formless and insubstantial. The method begins with interdependence, gradually withdrawing into concealment. From this interdependence in nothingness, concealment itself is forgotten in the moment when nothing remains to conceal—this is mutual forgetting. Profound and ever-quiescent, this is the transformation into emptiness. When quiescence reaches the point of no-quiescence, this is the refinement of emptiness to merge with the Dao.

My teacher, Master Taixu, once said: *"The study of heavenly immortality revolves around the three—essence, qi, and spirit—turning within a single aperture, like a child in the womb, unmeasured and unweighed, the mother nurturing the fetus without effort, mother and child mutually forgetting yet at peace. It is like a pearl in a crystal dish, rolling and glistening, naturally round and radiant, with no dregs or obstructions within. Unlike other elixir methods that rigidly prescribe set times for refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—failing to grasp the secret of this single-aperture turning point—they cannot attain such intimate and authentic practice, resorting instead to trivial techniques, idle words, and arbitrary schedules to deceive and mislead."*

Our tradition’s heart-transmission is the highest-grade elixir method. For our lineage’s heart-transmission necessarily takes the merging and transformation of spirit as the work of heavenly immortality. Thus, when examining the treasures of the school, every detail is clarified with concrete evidence. When instructing practitioners, they are first taught to seek the master within, to proceed with utmost sincerity and diligence, with utter simplicity and honesty. Only then, when beginning the elixir refinement, will subduing the tiger and dragon, refining the hun and po, become effortless. Returning to the secret of the single aperture, one directly reaches the source of the three passes—no longer difficult. Thus, the great returning elixir of golden liquid can be accomplished in three hundred days.

All my fellow practitioners, I urge you not to be misled: do not mistakenly fixate on a cavity beside the spleen, imagining qi ascending and descending, calling it "qi steaming," "essence dripping," "spirit numinous," or "emptiness void"—such misconceptions uproot the source and exacerbate errors.

As if starving and eating salt, only to grow more parched—such practice ensures one will never refine essence into spirit, nor attain the moment of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao. Idle sitting wastes qi and wearies the spirit, unaware that the foundation of the elixir is laid in an instant, that the workings of creation are enacted within the body. How lamentable this is.

**Chapter Sixteen (conclusion)**
This chapter reveals the secret of the single aperture that turns the mechanism, and particularly clarifies the principle of blending qi and essence to refine them into spirit—entirely the subtle efficacy of nurturing the formless through quiescence and profound stillness.

To restrain the *po* is not the heart’s restraint; how could the *hun* be bound by intention?
When one nurtures the formless, the *shen* of consciousness dies while the *gu shen* (Valley Spirit) lives.
The *gu shen* lives, thus passions fade; passions fade, and the *po* is extinguished!
Indeed, only one who has first mastered the heart can restrain it—the heart itself cannot restrain the *po*.
When form is forgotten, the seven apertures become still while the single aperture shines.
The single aperture shines, thus nature manifests; nature manifests, and the *hun* is stored!
Only one who holds to this intention can bind it—how could intention itself bind the *hun*?

**Chapter Seventeen**
Only abide in spirit and qi, and in a fleeting moment the Mysterious Pearl is formed.
The *hun* stored, thus spirit is whole; the *po* extinguished, thus qi is full.
Spirit and qi interact and naturally congeal.
"Mysterious" reflects its profound abyss; "pearl" reflects its luminous purity—hence it is called the Mysterious Pearl.

**Chapter Seventeen (conclusion)**
This continues the previous chapter, expounding that by nurturing the formless, qi naturally becomes abundant and spirit naturally finds its refuge.

The oral instructions are few; the elixir is refined in a moment.
This speaks of the elixir-refining oral instructions—namely, the two lines from the previous chapter, "Only abide in spirit and qi"—where the meaning lies entirely in the phrase "few in number" and the "fleeting moment."
Yet how spirit and qi are to be conjoined, how in a fleeting moment they congeal, has its own simple and easy method—precisely what the original preface to *The Stone Tablet* calls "no more than half a phrase."
When the practitioner’s effort is pure and mature, wisdom arises from concentration, and one naturally awakens, seizing the initiative—what is called "attaining it without the least exertion."

Gently stoking the fire’s timing, after ten months the infant is born.
Rather than idly tending the elixir furnace to watch the fire’s timing,
simply settle the spirit and rest the breath, allowing nature to take its course.
When qi is focused and thought is still, no error arises.
Nurturing it for three hundred days, it naturally becomes lively as an infant emerging from the womb,
manifesting the image of "the dragon seen in the field"—a metaphorical expression.

○ Above: Chapter Eighteen.
This continues the preceding two chapters to introduce the intent of the following six.
The previous two chapters spoke of gathering and conjoining; this chapter highlights the two words "oral instructions,"
and teaches that when applying the instructions, the fire’s timing must be gentle.
The next six chapters will elaborate on bathing, the division of the embryo, gentle nurturing, and the completion of the elixir.

The husband and wife first unite in joy, and as the years deepen, their affection grows more profound.
Auspicious qi arises in the bridal chamber, where spring winds blow without cease.
The husband and wife symbolize heart and body; the bridal chamber, the single aperture; the spring winds, gentleness.
This speaks of how body and heart, initially congealed by essence and qi into spirit, already feel inseparable in their union.
After refining through firing and bathing, accumulated over days and months, their harmonious affection deepens beyond its initial state.
In their constant communion, true qi naturally steams and bathes them, its warmth as gentle as sitting amid spring winds.
Readers must not let the words obscure the meaning.

Master Zixian Xue has a song:
*"True husband, true wife,
When Kan’s man and Li’s woman unite in resonance,
The sky is empty, the earth dew-laden, without a speck of dust."*
This depicts the luminous scene within the single aperture—how could the slightest dust of mundane perception remain?

○ Above: Chapter Nineteen.

This continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how prolonged firing and refining naturally give rise to the bathing of true qi, its warmth still taken as the standard—seemingly no different from the function of firing and refining. Yet one must understand: once the medicine coalesces within, the initial application of fire must be meticulous, and this is called "firing and refining." Later, when true qi constantly ascends in audience, suffusing the entire body, its warmth and moisture are called "bathing." Thus, firing and refining arise from the regulation of fire, while bathing is the natural power of the medicine. This is why Master Bai speaks of "taking activity and stillness as advance and retreat"—firing and refining are activity, bathing is stillness. Activity is the advance of fire, where there is use within the absence of use; stillness is the retreat of fire, where effort is applied within the effortlessness of prior effort. This must not be overlooked.

Sudden rain on paper butterflies,
Golden furnace with jade peonies.
At midnight, a red sun blazes,
In the sixth month, pristine frost chills.

The first line depicts peril, the second danger; midnight signifies cold, the sixth month heat. The red sun dispels cold, pristine frost dissolves heat. This speaks of how, in the flourishing stage of the elixir path, one is often inclined toward movement rather than stillness, yet the fire regulation must occur in a state of non-doing and non-action. If the spirit is truly settled and still, with no thoughts arising within thought, the work is pure and nothing need be feared. But if one’s prior refinement of the self remains impure, upon reaching this state of non-doing, thoughts will inevitably stir, causing the spirit to scatter outward. The peril is like paper butterflies caught in sudden rain; the body grows cold as midnight. One must then draw upon the warmth of the red sun to dispel it, so the spirit returns to the Celestial Valley, the cold recedes, and warmth is restored. If thoughts grow restless, the spirit turns volatile, the danger like jade peonies cast into a golden furnace; the heart burns as in the sixth month. One must then draw upon the chill of pristine dew to quell it, so qi returns to the Crimson Palace, and restlessness naturally subsides into moisture. The key is to maintain no-thought within thought, movement rooted in stillness, always keeping warmth and moisture as the measure. Yet how can one obtain the sun at midnight or frost in the sixth month? If one seeks remedial methods at this stage, how can they be effective?

One must realize: midnight is precisely the *zi* hour, the sixth month when the sun is at *wu*. Cold is always likened to midnight, heat to the sixth month—these vivid warnings of danger from reckless movement also subtly reveal the opportune moment for timely adjustment. If one awakens to the location of the primordial embryo, one may then proceed to regulate it. For those who have not yet grasped the method, read the next chapter.

○ Above: Chapter Twenty.

This continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how, during the cessation of fire and bathing, all depends on the spirit’s stillness and qi’s movement to achieve fullness and ultimately part the embryo. If thoughts stir and qi scatters, peril arises—this is why Master Bai insists on "taking discontinuity and lack of focus as a dike." Herein lies the insight.

Those whose prior refinement of the self runs deep will not suffer this affliction. Those with the aspiration to cultivate the elixir—can they not first rouse vigilance?

Fire flies from the sea’s depths,
Earthen springs flow from mountain peaks.
In a moment, union is achieved,
The jade crucible emits blue smoke.

The sea’s depths signify the *weilu*, mountain peaks the crown of the head. Golden fire is the fire of life, earthen springs the water of nature. "Union achieved" describes the harmony and balance attained in secrecy; the jade crucible is this single aperture of mystery, and the rising blue smoke is the sign of warmth and transformation.

This continues from the preceding chapter, addressing how to obtain the sun at midnight: one must direct the true command to fly the pure yang *qian*-gold fire of *kan* from the sea’s depths at the *weilu*, ascending to the crown and returning to *qian*—like the blazing red sun suffusing the body with harmony. How to obtain frost in the sixth month? One must guide the pure yin *kun*-earth springs of *li* from the mountain peak downward, returning to the sea and reverting to *kun*—like pristine frost’s chill bringing warmth and moisture throughout the body. Though expressed in two lines, it is in truth a single process: ascending from below to return to *qian* is called "flying golden fire," while descending from above to return to *kun* is called "flowing earthen springs." This is the method of "advancing fire and retreating tally" described in other elixir texts. Through such adjustment, in but a moment the entire body attains warmth and harmony, just as the crucible emits smoke—no further pursuit of qi is needed. Yet this is ultimately not natural but a last resort for remedy. Otherwise, the treasure should not be lightly toyed with, as Master Zhang has warned in detail.

In sum, the study of human nature and life (*xingming*) lies entirely in guarding the mind like a fortress. Thus, when King Wen expounded the third line of *Kun* in the *Yijing*, he appended the phrase "containing brilliance, it may be steadfast." ○ Chapter Twenty-One. This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating the method of remedy.

In my humble view: The nineteenth chapter above expounded the proper way of natural bathing; these two chapters teach the means to remedy deviations, which is why Master Bai spoke of the practices of "operation, withdrawal, and replenishment."

Break open the Gate of the Mysterious Origin; surge through the Barrier of Chaos.
The "Gate of the Mysterious Origin" refers to the singular aperture of the mysterious image. "Break open" means to return the seven apertures to their root in this one aperture, whereupon it suddenly opens wide, and one directly perceives the original True Unity—rooted before the myriad phenomena, penetrating the inner and outer of the physical form, utterly void and utterly nonexistent, most wondrous and most mysterious. One feels only boundless obscurity beyond measure by inches, vast expanse beyond confinement by shores; its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the finest hairtip. Above, there is no further color; below, no further abyss. A single thing is perfectly complete, manifesting through the ages—this is the moment when the singular aperture unifies the seven, and the Mysterious Barrier stands fully open.

The "Barrier of Chaos" describes the time when *qi* has grown abundant, and the yang spirit dwells alone in the Celestial Valley, receiving the homage of *qi*, yet remaining in a state of primal undifferentiation, like a lump at the threshold of chaos. "Surge through" means that at this stage, the elixir’s power is sufficient, the fire’s force is complete, so vast and unyielding that it cannot remain hidden. One’s Valley Spirit has already beheld the Mysterious Origin, and the true aperture suddenly bursts open, whereupon the center glows with penetrating principle. Rightly positioned within the body, its *qi* courses through heaven and earth, its spirit commands the Dharma-body. Suddenly, one feels thunder’s roar and lightning’s flash, shaking heaven and earth; immediately, the hundred meridians bristle, the Three Passes are fully opened, the entire body becomes pure yang, and the form grows fiery hot—this is the true scene, not a metaphor.

The preceding line dissolves the former toil of refining thoughts and cleansing the mind through the six-day cycle, returning all to the root in a single stroke. The following line then directly points to the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, unifying the seven in the one, nurturing it straightaway without harm—what Laozi called "returning the report," saying "serene, serene" and "restoring life." Only at this point is the original life fully restored!

In short: In the postnatal realm, it pertains to body and mind, and the work must proceed from movement to stillness to return to one’s prenatal state. Upon returning to the prenatal, it pertains to nature and life, and the work naturally shifts from extreme stillness to movement, exhibiting the image of "leaping in the abyss." Without the foundation of "day and night, establishing life in profound secrecy," how could one attain this?

Yet knowing only to refine water and fire, one lets tiger and dragon coil at will. The refining of water and fire is precisely the work of gentle nurturing, as will be explained in the next chapter. The tiger originally symbolized the body, but here symbolizes qi; the dragon originally symbolized the mind, but here symbolizes spirit. At this stage, the mysterious aperture has already opened—no need to seclude oneself in the colored body for hidden cultivation. Yet the original nature remains unrecovered, just like the ninth-fourth line in the outer trigram of Qian. Confucius called this: "No constancy in rising or falling, no permanence in advancing or retreating." One cannot ascend to join Heaven, nor descend to embrace Earth; one has not yet advanced to merge with the Dao, nor retreated to preserve the body. This is the time of congealing yet unsettled, when one can only gather the sack within, gently nurturing the sagely work.

Like the spring first welling beneath the mountain in *Meng*, the noble one, through resolute action, cultivates virtue to nurture its stability as water. Like the fire first kindling beneath the mountain in *Bi*, the noble one, through illuminating governance, dares not adjudicate disputes, nurturing its wisdom as fire. In such refinement, one must proceed to the end without presuming completion.

Thus, in the perfect formula of *Heavenly Immortals’ Heart Transmission*, I say: "Guard the Three Powers as an egg; yellow is the field of fortune. I dwell within, blending and transforming Kun and Qian." This means still congealing spirit and qi in the sincerity of unwavering unity, enclosing nature and life within the aperture of emptiness and spontaneity. Let tiger and dragon coil together, awaiting the meeting of wind and cloud—only then may one hope for the elixir’s completion.

*(Lin’s note: My teacher once told others, "To seek the essentials of the Golden Elixir, study the Qian and Kun of the *Zhouyi*, and the Dao will be complete." I, Lin, once read the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, and awakened to the method of gathering and refining. Reading the first line of Qian alongside the first of Kun, I understood the way of congealing and binding. Reading the second line of Qian alongside the second of Kun, I grasped the way of refining and tempering. Reading the third line of Qian alongside the third of Kun, I knew the way of bathing and cleansing. Reading the fourth line of Qian alongside the fourth of Kun, I saw that once the embryo is divided, one must proceed with gentle nurturing. Reading the fifth line of Kun alongside the fifth of Qian, I attained the way of elixir completion. Re-reading the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, alongside the ‘using nine’ and ‘using six,’ I finally awakened to the way of transcending life and death. Thus, the Duke of Zhou composed the *Tuan* to let people contemplate its oracles, while Confucius supplemented it with the *Xiang*, *Tuanzhuan*, and *Wenyan* to elucidate its subtleties—truly one may observe the images, know the changes, contemplate the words, and understand the oracles!)*

**Chapter Twenty-Two (Continued)**
This follows the preceding chapter, speaking of how, once bathing is complete, there naturally arises the Way of embryo division—precisely what Master Bai referred to as "shifting the spirit to exchange the crucible." In truth, there is nothing to divide, nothing to shift; it is only that knowledge and perception expand until heaven and humanity are no longer separate, spirit and qi fill until self and other are without boundary. Yet one must nurture with gentle warmth until maturity is reached, only then will the elixir be complete.

However, the work of gentle nurturing is difficult to bring to fruition within a set time—this depends on whether one’s usual practice of vigilance in solitude is pure, which determines its swiftness or slowness.

*In the Sakaṭa’s waters, fire;*
*On Kunlun’s peak, waves.*
*Who can fathom its operation?*
*The great intent lies with the Yellow Dame.*

"In the Sakaṭa’s waters" points to the sea’s depths; "on Kunlun’s peak" points to the mountain’s summit. Though these two lines appear identical to the first couplet of Chapter Twenty-One, previously the words "flying and circulating" described the method of internal restoration within the physical form. Here, however, the spirit has already settled into its proper position to consolidate life, and qi has penetrated both within and without. One now knows that within the sea of Sakaṭa lies the treasure of one’s wisdom-life, and that atop Kunlun’s summit dwells the abode of one’s settled nature. There is no east or west, no distance; neither water nor fire ascends or descends. One simply allows the vast, upright qi to flow of itself, while all things grow together in the sacred work of gentle nurturing. Its operation differs greatly from the time before the barrier was opened. All that is required is a steadfast, reverent, and careful adherence to the great intent—never allowing flightiness or restlessness to disturb the body’s constant ease. In harmonious radiance, seated in unity, one may naturally await the return of the original nature.

Master Zixian Xue composed a song:
*"Water is true water, fire is true fire,*
*As before, awaiting the season, circulating the celestial sphere.*
*In harmony, refined to perfection—*
*The treasure of long life."*

This may serve to illuminate its operation.

**Chapter Twenty-Three**

Building upon the preceding chapter, this further elucidates the Dao of gentle nurturing and sustaining fullness.

The elixir is drawn from the primordial qi,
The fire sought from the essence of the Great One.
To know the elixir is to take the fire—
Within stillness, the cinnabar is formed.

The "elixir" refers to the qi of the five: spirit, essence, soul,魄, and intent. When the five qi flow as one to return to the origin, they coalesce into the nebulous primordial spirit of undifferentiated simplicity, and the body then contains the pure yang qi—this is the primordial qi. The "fire" refers to the radiance of the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. When the three radiances transform in unison and gather at the crown, they inwardly congeal the essence of the Great One containing truth, and the heart then holds the pure yin essence—this is the essence of the Great One.

Our fellow disciple Qu Jun observed: *"In the* Spring and Autumn Unification Diagram*, the five stars of the North Pole reside in the Purple Tenuity Palace, which is the essence of the Great One, the celestial chamber of the Heavenly Emperor. Its position, slightly south of and near the Heavenly One, corresponds precisely to the crown of a person’s head, thus enabling direct resonance and infusion into the heart."* This principle is indeed well-founded, for it is the very origin of the primordial union of yin and yang at the moment of a person’s birth.

I have further verified this with Chapter Seventeen, which describes what is obtained at this stage as the *"marrow of Heaven and Earth."* Heaven and Earth are the Supreme Ultimate, so the Great One’s root in the Supreme Ultimate is precisely what He Quzi described as *"the Supreme Ultimate flowing its essence in profound obscurity."* Yet the Supreme Ultimate is invisible, so it is likened to the Great One that governs Heaven. Thus, the essence of the Great One in the Purple Tenuity Palace is clearly the essence flowing from the Supreme Ultimate—rightly called the marrow of Heaven and Earth. However, this need not be discussed in detail.

In essence, human qi is originally interconnected with Heaven’s qi. At this stage of cultivation, one constantly fuses the true qi of the five returning to the origin with the primordial spirit of the three radiances gathering at the crown. Abiding in unbroken continuity, with the heart as still as ashes, one naturally awaits the return of the original nature. This is to seek the essence of the Great One as fire and gather the primordial qi as the elixir. With fire to refine the elixir, within stillness the cinnabar is formed—just as Bai Zi said: *"It may be met without intent, but cannot be sought with intent."*

Thus, Master Zixian Xue composed a song:
*"The elixir is no thing, the fire no season—*
*Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang,*
*Refined into boundless life through ten thousand kalpas."*

We need only guard it in the formless clarity of stillness, and naturally the fire will forge the spirit into perfection—this is *"within stillness, the cinnabar is formed."* If one seeks with knowledge, it is like Zhuangzi’s *"Yellow Emperor losing the dark pearl,"* sending knowledge to seek it in vain.

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
This chapter, building upon Chapter Twenty-Three, clarifies that from gathering the elixir to the formation of the cinnabar, the process does not depart from the simple Dao of Qian and Kun—methods that are easy to know and simple to practice. With the right mindfulness, in natural stillness and undivided purity, after three hundred days of effort, one may thereafter roam beyond the world, playfully wandering among mortals, coming and going without obstruction, in harmony with the natural Dao.

I note: From the first chapter to this twenty-fourth, the discourse on the cinnabar Dao is now complete. However, in explaining the stages of transmutation, gathering, union, refinement, bathing, as well as embryo division and gentle nurturing, one cannot avoid using metaphors, nor can distinctions be omitted for clarity. Yet I fear that later practitioners may cling to the words and become mired in imagery, mistaking it for something tangible and deliberate, thus failing to awaken suddenly. Even if they grasp its truth, they may still err in thinking the two (elixir and fire) must be used together, fixating on the labor of ascent and descent without realizing their unity. Even if they understand unity, they may yet cling to distinctions between inner and outer after refining the Valley Spirit, unaware that the true body originally encompasses form and dharma as one, inherently transparent within and without.

Therefore, the following text will further expound upon Chapter Twenty-Four to clarify the central meaning of the preceding chapters. Though it occasionally employs metaphors drawn from things, its every passage dispels doubts, and each chapter reveals the true teaching. Its lingering resonance carries meaning beyond words—profound and far-reaching, it merits deep contemplation.

The primordial qi—how to ingest it?
True essence—no need to shift.
True essence and primordial qi,
These are the foundation of the Great Elixir.

What I speak of is the qi produced within my body—formless primordial qi, unlike tangible food that can be discussed in terms of how to consume it. The essence born of my heart is immaterial true essence, unlike external objects that are solid and heavy, and thus requires no transference.

If one can know the medicine and grasp the fire, one knows that medicine is fire and fire is medicine. True essence and primordial qi are one yet two, two yet one. Clearly, they form the foundation of the Great Elixir!

**Above: Chapter Twenty-Five.**
This chapter continues from the previous twenty-four, clarifying that the foundation of the Elixir lies solely in the union of these two—essence and qi—with no need for external seeking.

---

Confucians elucidate nature and principle,
Buddhists strike at empty nothingness.
Unacquainted with the immortal’s art,
The Golden Elixir’s work is momentary.

This speaks of how, in that era, both the sagely Dao and Buddhist Dharma lacked true transmitters. Confucians merely clarified nature and principle without investigating the primordial mandate as the root of nature. Buddhists merely struck at empty nothingness without exploring the primordial nature as the source of mandate. Thus, they failed to recognize the immortal’s all-pervading Way.

What is called refining medicine with fire to form the Elixir is simply guiding qi with spirit to achieve the Dao—this is exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining mandate. Alas!

The former sages of Confucianism composed the *Zhouyi* and the *Zhongyong*; the World-Honored One of Buddhism expounded the *Vajra* and the *Perfect Awakening*. If one takes these and examines them together, one will know that the immortal’s art of the Golden Elixir is the art of benevolence. It can, in an instant, establish the foundation of transformation for the entire body.

What the earlier Confucians called "comprehending the one and completing all things"—only then does one realize that since ancient times, the world has never had two Ways, and the sages of the Three Teachings have never had two hearts.

**Above: Chapter Twenty-Six.**
This chapter, following the preceding text, laments that people do not know how to unite essence and qi to form the Elixir. With profound compassion, it sharply admonishes the followers of the Three Teachings, urging them to explore the transmitted hearts of the Three Sages, practice the same art, and universally deliver all beings.

In the crescent-moon furnace, mercury;
In the cinnabar tripod, lead.
Tortoise and snake—true unified qi,
Born in the prior heaven.

The crescent-moon furnace refers to the place within the human body where the furnace for refinement can be established, without need to fixate on specific locations. Cinnabar symbolizes the heart’s image; the term "tripod" signifies the heart’s inherent emptiness, capable of containing and refining things.

The tortoise and snake were mentioned in Chapter Four; here, they further elucidate the meaning of the first chapter, stating that the lead and mercury within body and heart originally derive from the true unity of yin and yang, all produced in the prior heaven. One need only attain emptiness and tranquility to observe their return—no external seeking is required.

Thus, the worthy Xue Zixian composed a song:
*"Crescent-moon furnace, cinnabar tripod,
Know to embrace the One and guard harmony,
Without concern for penetrating barriers or casting into the jade well."*
Master Xue was a disciple of Master Shi, having received the true transmission of this chapter’s secret and thus composing this song.

**Above: Chapter Twenty-Seven.**
This clarifies that the furnace, tripod, medicine, and fire are all present from the very beginning of our existence, lamenting that people remain unaware and fail to practice.

---

New moon, full moon, crescent, and dark—
Drawing and adding mirror waxing and waning.
Unknowing of true creation and transformation,
What thing is true lead?

New moon, full moon, crescent, and dark are images of waxing and waning, ebb and flow. "Seeking" means turning, not searching. "Drawing" means reducing when full; "adding" means supplementing when empty—all arising naturally.

From non-being to being is called creation; from being back to non-being is called transformation—this is following nature. The Dao of the Elixir follows nature: the human body naturally has movement and stillness, the qi mechanism naturally has concealment and activation, just as the moon in the sky has new moon, full moon, crescent, and dark. One draws and adds according to its waxing and waning, never maintaining perpetual fullness.

If one does not recognize waxing and waning as the true mechanism of creation and transformation, then after the first crescent and before the new moon or dark, seeking the moon’s appearance in the west at dusk will be impossible. This illustrates that when refining the Elixir and gathering the medicine, one should embrace purity and stillness as the body and guard true lead as the function.

If the initial stirring of *gui* has not yet arisen, one will never find—even searching the entire body—what thing could be true lead. This further elucidates the meaning of Chapter Two: *"To gather and refine, one must know the time."*

**Above: Chapter Twenty-Eight.**
The previous chapter having clarified the source of the medicine, this chapter specifies the time of its arising, hoping that all may know and practice.

---

Qi is the life within form,
Heart is the spirit within nature.
One who knows the cavity of spirit and qi
Is indeed an immortal.

Form is the body; the body relies on the stem of life’s true qi to live, thus qi is the life within form. The heart is the heaven of nature, where the primordial spirit gathers, thus the heart is the spirit within nature—meaning the heart is the chamber of spirit.

In sum, nature and life are the root of body and heart; spirit and qi are what body and heart emit. Thus, knowing that body and heart are the support of nature and life, body and heart are the cavity of spirit and qi. The perceptive person who attains this true cavity, gathers and stores it, has established the foundation of life in profound secrecy.

Without this knowledge, where does one begin the refinement of the immortal?

**Above: Chapter Twenty-Nine.**
This further elucidates the function of body, heart, nature, and life, relying solely on spirit and qi for application, hoping that people will suddenly awaken to the method of return and restoration to regain their source.

Wood marrow refines the golden tripod,
Spring flow pours into the jade furnace.
Wood symbolizes nature; nature relies on the heart. The single point of true essence within the heart originally arises from the root of nature—this is my primordial essence, like the marrow within wood, hence "wood marrow."

This clarifies the source of mercury. Gold represents the primordial Qian virtue; the primordial heart originally belongs to Qian, hence the heart is metaphorically called the "golden heart"—the foundation upon which nature relies. Nature is inherently without flaw, thus it resides within the heart, which possesses all principles to respond to the myriad affairs. Just as smelting gold forms a tripod capable of regulating water and fire to refine the five flavors, it is called the "golden tripod." The heart is originally perfectly pure; when untainted by external objects, it remains without blemish, and its essence and marrow can be refined into spirit. Yet since birth, without refinement, it becomes distracted by sensory desires, laboring the heart and instead being enslaved by form. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, how can one expect to condense essence into mercury? Therefore, one must first establish the correct mandate, purify the heart through stillness, and refine it to clarity, thereby completing the original spirit of one’s nature. Once lead arises, true mercury is produced, condensed and refined into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *"Wood marrow refines the golden tripod."*

"Spring" refers to water still within the mountain before its emergence, symbolizing my life. Life depends on the body; the single point of true qi within the body originally arises from the root of life—this is my primordial qi, like a flowing stream with its source, hence "spring flow"—this clarifies the source of lead. Jade embodies the primordial Kun body; the primordial body originally belongs to Kun, hence the body is metaphorically called the "jade body"—the foundation upon which life relies. Life is inherently vigorous, thus it resides within the body. At midnight, when a single yang stirs, it is like carving jade into a furnace, wherein fire warms and qi grows more temperate, hence the "jade furnace." The body is originally perfectly still; when untouched by external objects, it remains free from illness, nourished by fetal breathing to mature. Yet after encountering external things, if one no longer cherishes it, the qi mechanism becomes agitated, flowing into essence and causing leakage. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, this qi is still deemed impure. One must first firmly uphold the correct thought, guiding qi to gather within the body, settling and purifying it, thereby attaining the primordial qi. Naturally activated, it refines mercury into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *"Spring flow pours into the jade furnace."*

Who among the bustling world would contemplate life and death’s great matter, rectifying the root and purifying the source of the heart and body’s essence and qi, refining them like gold and jade, and then devote three hundred days of effort, neither forgetting nor forcing, to cultivate it steadily?

**Above: Chapter Thirty.**
This chapter, following the previous one—which has thoroughly revealed the origins of spirit and qi, seemingly allowing for sudden awakening and return to the source—addresses those who have yet to awaken. Due to deep-seated habitual defilements, their spirit is dull and qi turbid; the spiritual barrier remains unopened, and they cannot fully embrace it. Thus, it further instructs them to invigorate their spirit, refine and purify it, awaiting the proper time to commence the firing process.

The jade tripod refines lead fluid,
The golden furnace nurtures mercury essence.
The tripod symbolizes the spirit chamber; when the master within, through the cultivation described above, becomes clear and luminous, the spirit is as flawless as jade, hence the "jade tripod." When lead qi arrives, mercury fire is activated to refine it, forming spirit water, hence: *"The jade tripod refines lead fluid."* The furnace symbolizes the sea of qi; when the true qi within, as described above, is settled and purified, the qi naturally solidifies like gold, hence the "golden furnace." When qi is produced, it must encounter mercury essence, which is naturally nurtured and enters the flowery pond, hence: *"The golden furnace nurtures mercury essence."*

Nine returns are nine transformations, as explained in Chapter Six. Properly gathering the ingredients is the way of refinement and union. "Resembling the revolving stars" means following the celestial bodies that govern the four seasons and the regularity of dawn and dusk, all rooted in the heavens’ ceaseless motion, naturally revolving around the pivot without error. This illustrates that bathing and nurturing should be modeled after this principle. The main point of this chapter is to clarify that spirit is fire and qi is the medicine; when fire meets medicine, it vigorously refines, and when medicine encounters fire, it solidifies, thereby forming the returned elixir. "Refining" and "nurturing" refer to the process from union to refinement, employing Qian’s steadfast stillness to nurture until the bathing stage, when the embryo separates and the elixir is completed.

**Above: Chapter Thirty-One.**
This chapter, building upon the previous one, states that after invigorating the spirit, when the time arrives and all converges, one can condense and refine the elixir. It further instructs on the precise nature of medicine and fire, enabling one to clearly understand the theory of the nine returns without doubt.

Jade fluid nourishes the spirit chamber,
The golden embryo forms the qi pivot.
Seek only the medicine within the body,
No need to consult alchemical texts.
Jade fluid refers to heart qi, and the golden embryo refers to lead heart. When qi is sufficient to become spirit, it can refine the elixir. Therefore, one must first cultivate heart qi to nourish the spirit chamber, so that when lead is encountered, it merges into a single embryo. Once the embryo’s qi is formed, the entire body’s qi mechanism follows the celestial pivot like the revolving heavens, without errant movement. Thus, spirit is the qi pivot. When Kun constantly condenses, qi gathers without fail—all is the medicine within the body, which can only be sought within oneself. Alchemical texts of past dynasties merely clarify the main principles, teaching people to introspect and cultivate internally, without needing to consult them.

**Above: Chapter Thirty-Two.**
This explains the correct method of union.

Fire jujubes have no pits,
Intercourse pears leave no dregs.
All day long, tend the fire and timing,
Divine water irrigates the golden flower.

The jujube is called "fire jujube," metaphor for true mercury refined from lead into elixir.
The pear is called "intercourse pear," metaphor for the elixir head where mercury and lead merge as one.
"Divine water" is explained in Chapter Four; the "golden flower" is the Flower Pool.
This speaks of spirit having no pit, qi leaving no dregs—only by maintaining stillness and emptiness throughout the day, nurturing the formless, does spirit naturally condense into the qi cavern.
This is the Dao of "lead and mercury forming the true body" achieved spontaneously, as mentioned in the first chapter.
As Laozi said, "Daring not to act brings life."

Master Zixian Xue has a song:
*"True intercourse pear, true fire jujube,
After eating the pear, the four limbs grow refined;
When swallowing the jujube, ten thousand kalpas are sated."*
Do you not believe it so?

**Above: Chapter Thirty-Three.**
This explains the correct method of refinement. The next chapter will address the errors of those who practice qi refinement and spirit preservation, lamenting their failure to grasp the subtlety of the superior-grade true formula.

---

Refining qi is but wasted effort,
Preserving spirit is mere exertion.
How could they know the marvel of the elixir formula—
All day long, one delights in true emptiness.

"Delighting" is like the roc soaring ninety thousand li and resting for six months, never straying beyond the heavens.
"True emptiness" means spirit is real, qi is void.
When I enter the qi cavern with spirit, the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm are both swept away, and the entire body becomes utterly transparent, inner and outer as one true emptiness.
"Delighting in true emptiness" is what Master Haichan meant by:
*"Illuminating the body, long life is empty yet not empty;
The numinous mirror embraces heaven and holds the ten thousand things."*

This speaks of human primordial qi, which should only be nurtured, not refined—let it circulate freely, and it will be clear and unobstructed.
Yet some refine qi: if not through manipulation, then by breath-holding.
Little do they know that breath-holding and manipulation are techniques used in talismanic practices, where the emptied realm is feigned to store and deploy qi, creating an illusion of efficacy—this is refining through deliberate effort.
If true qi is already circulating naturally and one still refines it, this is fettering qi.
Fettering qi causes stagnation and blockage, and when asleep or unaware, it will inevitably leak out, wasting effort without result.
This is the error of those in lesser alchemical traditions who cling to the emptied realm, failing to grasp the principle of inner-outer unity.

Moreover, primordial spirit should only be settled, not preserved through effort—constantly retreating into concealment, it becomes real and not hollow.
Yet some preserve spirit: if not through focused visualization, then by silent invocation.
Little do they know that focused visualization and silent invocation are practices used in ghostly rites, where the perception of emptiness is feigned to express reverence, achieving resonance—this is preserving through deliberate intent.
If the elixir spirit is already serene and one still preserves it, this is self-disturbance.
Disturbing spirit shackles and unsettles it, inevitably driving it toward wandering thoughts and delusions, wasting effort without gain.
This is the error of the Two Vehicles in Buddhism, who remain attached to the perception of emptiness, failing to achieve the forgetting of both self and dharmas.

Chen Niuwan’s *Song of Emerald Emptiness* points out these flaws:
*"All stem from not understanding the true one’s correct formula,
Leading to vain labor and endless harm."*

How could they know the marvel of the superior-grade elixir formula, which long ago swept away both the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm, achieving true emptiness without obstruction?
Spirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, nurturing the formless;
Qi naturally fills the void, meeting its ultimate limit.
From the moment of the living zi hour’s true union onward to the living zi hour’s initial union, one remains serene all day,
Using activity and rest, movement and stillness as fire and timing.
Rising with the sun to work like the roc in flight,
Resting at dusk like the roc at rest,
Eating when hungry, sleeping when weary,
Responding to events with compliance, returning to stillness when guests depart—
The ten thousand things cannot disturb my non-awareness,
Heaven and earth cannot enslave my formlessness.
Freely circulating through the six qi,
I alone contain the myriad existences in sincerity.
This is the marvelous formula of "tending the fire and timing all day" from the previous chapter, and "delighting in true emptiness all day" in this chapter—
Why trouble with the vain labor of refining qi and preserving spirit?

**Above: Chapter Thirty-Four.**
This chapter, following the previous one, speaks of the life treasure not to be lightly tampered with—only by concealing qi within qi without detection, concealing spirit within spirit without awareness,
Neither clinging to emptiness nor to nothingness,
Like a fish in water, carefree and at ease,
Responding to things with integrity and compliance,
Departing from things with vast impartiality,
Existing in perfect oneness—
This is the correct method of bathing.
If one can be thus, what danger need one fear?

To refine primordial qi,
First dry the living mercury.
Once the sacred embryo is formed,
The crown breaks open with thunderous roar.

"Living mercury" refers to unrefined mercury—
The single point of yin essence in my heart,
Initially unmet by lead’s refinement,
Like quicksilver, lively and hard to control.
"Breaking the crown" follows the meaning of "chiseling through" in Chapter Twenty-Two.

This speaks of treasuring the yin essence in my heart because, when it encounters the yang qi in my body, it can be seized and refined.
Yet essence, being yin, is like quicksilver—lively and prone to dissipation.
How can it gather qi to become spirit?
Thus, to refine primordial qi, one must first, in daily life,
Be cautious and fearful, steadfast in resolve,
Through vigilance in solitude, retreat into concealment—
Taking purity as the foundation, guarding lead and mercury as the function.
When gui is born, exert unwavering strength,
Seize this unruly yin essence like a dragon,
Wrestle and capture the fierce yang qi like a tiger,
Wrestle them into a death grip, surging upward,
Turning back in a single motion—
Then they unite joyously without separation.

At that moment, my yin essence—long resented for its tendency to dissipate, likened to quicksilver—has its fluid wholly absorbed by yang qi, congealing into spirit and returning together to the formless cavity. This is called the Mysterious Female.
As Master Bai said: *"Two mud oxen wrestle into the sea—henceforth, all trace of them vanishes."* Yet this describes only the initial formation of the elixir-head; thereafter, the coming and renewal of primordial life and primordial nature are all rooted in this profound concealment as their foundation.
Even the true qi that perpetually arises in the body at ordinary times is none other than this "spiritless spirit," wondrously merging and congealing within the realm of nothingness.
Day after day, night after night, without reckoning the passage of days or months, the sacred embryo naturally takes form. One day, when the cavity at the crown breaks open, it becomes the gate of the Mysterious Female.
Suddenly, this body seems to sit atop the heavens—only to behold thunder roaring and lightning flashing in the void, shaking earth and startling sky. In an instant, the hundred meridians all still, the Three Passes become radiantly clear.
From then on, the body is as if ablaze, wholly yang throughout, all chronic ailments vanish, and dreams no longer arise.
The ancients revered this return of life as the reappearance of the primordial numinous treasure, the True Person of Original Life; in the return of nature, they saw the reappearance of the primordial Supreme Ultimate, the True Person of Dao and virtue. When refining emptiness to merge with the Dao, they called it the return of the primordial Wuji, the original unified qi.
Clearly, they took the Three Pure Ones, who unfold the transformations of heaven, as the true essence of the flowing unity of qi. Their teaching indeed contains profound truth, yet I humbly suggest that in the path of elixir refinement, the first steps are the return of qi and the return of spirit, followed by the revelation of the return of life, the return of nature, and the merging with the original source as the ultimate achievement—thus unfolding the essential aim of returning to the root and restoring the origin in a way that feels more intimate and less abstract.
Therefore, there is no need to invoke honorific titles at every step; this is not to dismiss the established teachings of the ancients.

Qi does not arise from the kidneys, nor does spirit reside in the heart.
Qi and spirit are elusive—
They transform into a single mass of gold.
This "single mass of gold" does not distinguish between the five qi, the three flowers, inner or outer, movement or stillness, form or dharma—it is simply nurtured with a tranquil mind in the formless.
As the *Taiyi Saving from Suffering Sutra* says:
*"Heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming natural spirit.
The natural has a distinct essence, originally in the empty cavern.
The empty cavern’s trace is no-trace, pervading the body with emptiness.
First, entrust qi to stand;
Second, follow qi to arise;
Third, complete the ten thousand dharmas;
Fourth, generate radiant light."*
This continues the previous chapter, speaking of the qi initially entrusted to the body, which returns from the dwelling palace of the empty valley to the responding valley—not originating from the kidneys.
The spirit transformed from yin essence returns from the responding valley, circulating with qi to revert to the celestial valley—not residing in the heart. Yet this remains within the tangible body, where grasping is possible, and does not yet manifest the Dharma-body.
Here, form and dharma are merged as the practice of nurturing and refining.
Know that spirit has no direction, and qi has no form—what is concealed in secrecy is called spirit, and what fills the void is called qi.
When qi and spirit interact, it occurs within the vast emptiness, leaving no trace to trace. Only in the midst of vagueness do they meet, and within profound obscurity does transformation arise.
If one seeks to find it, it can never be grasped; yet in the space between stillness and movement, a flash of flame scatters across the void—truly a mass of golden light, permeating the entire body.
When employed, the true spirit manifests; when released, it hides within the unchanging stillness.
This is no mere metaphor—it is the true vision.

The cavity is called the Mysterious Female,
Within it, qi and spirit are stored.
Who knows this cavity?
Seek no further for the real.
This chapter reveals the cavity formed at the moment of receiving qi at birth, which the ancients named the Mysterious Female. It arises only when I attain tranquility, the seven apertures return to their root, and essence and qi revert to congeal into spirit—this cavity can then contain them, hence the name Mysterious Female.
The key lies in that single moment when a steadfast and upright thought arises, allowing a brief instant of congealment.
Thus, Master Bai said: *"The Mysterious Female is where the thought stirs."*
The Master taught:
*"Qi arises from the hidden abyss and becomes spirit—hence it is called 'Mysterious,' the true yin within Li, the yin essence within the heart. When qi congeals, it completes my celestial nature.
Qi relies on spirit to gather and transform into spirit-water—hence it is called 'Female,' the true yang within Kan, the yang qi within the body. When it merges with qi, it completes my original life.
When qi and essence unite in one cavity, it is called the Mysterious Female. Who knows it?
If one understands why this cavity is called the Mysterious Female, then this single thought alone is real—beyond it, nothing is genuine. Why seek further?"*
Master Zixian Xue composed a song:
*"The true Mysterious Female, the true Mysterious Female—
The Mysterious Female is but one cavity,
Not in the mouth, nose, heart, or kidneys."*
This elucidates the chapter.
Master Chunyang said: *"Trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth—
No wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed."*

The explanation grows ever clearer!

**[On Chapter 37]**
This speaks of why the single cavity is called the Mysterious Female.

The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit,
The bladder is but surplus of the kidneys.
I urge you: cease your clinging attachment—
This is not the ladder of the Elixir.

The spleen and stomach store the qi of grain, not the chamber of spirit; one must not obstruct them, lest transformation become difficult. The bladder is merely the kidneys’ surplus, storing turbid water—do not mistake it for yang essence and recklessly circulate it through the River Chariot. The steps of the Dao of the Elixir lie not here; abandon your rigid attachments.

**[On Chapter 38]**
Following the previous chapter’s warning against external seeking, this cautions against internal misdirection, teaching one to nurture only the formless—this is the true ladder.

A thousand poems of inner visions,
A single cup of Central Yellow wine.
Carefree, unburdened by things,
Beyond the body lies Heaven and Earth.

*Inner visions* refer to the scenes within the colored body. *Central Yellow* is the Yellow Court within the celestial axis. *Beyond the body lies Heaven and Earth* describes the radiance uniting the seven apertures—once the crown is suddenly pierced, one beholds a golden light pervading the colored body inside and out, formed from the vast qi of primordial Heaven and Earth. Boundless in expanse, infinitesimal in subtlety, it permeates the colored body, which is contained within it. Thus, the body beyond the body is the integrated whole of Heaven and Earth.

At this stage, the inner visions cannot be grasped, nor can fire be applied to the Central Yellow. It is best to compose verses in response to the scene, cultivating the nature of Heaven and Earth, and to harmonize yin and yang’s spirit with wine. Refining one’s temperament demands meticulous care, hence a thousand poems flow without obstruction; nurturing qi must not be excessive, hence a single cup suffices. Spirit and qi thus roam freely within the Dharma-body. Though this colored body soars ninety thousand miles or rests for six months, soaring at will, it never strays beyond the Dharma-realm, and no worldly desire can burden its spirit. This is the Way of mutual nurturance within and without—what Master Zhang called, *"When the inner is unobstructed, the outer is also unobstructed."*

**[On Chapter 39]**
Building on the two preceding chapters, which swept clean and clarified inner and outer, this now emphasizes their mutual nurturance. One must refine temperament and cultivate nature, truly nurturing one’s vast qi. Thus, all three hundred rituals and three thousand deportments are the sage’s means of tempering harmony within Heaven and Earth, guiding each to the essence of their nature. Rooted in soundless music and formless ritual, moving with ease along the central path, ascending and descending in unity with Heaven and Earth—how could any external thing burden the spirit?

The Sun-Crow and Moon-Hare boil each other,
The Tortoise and Serpent coil of themselves.
Refined into a single grain of elixir,
Warmed and nurtured to become the Embryonic Immortal.

The crow is the solar soul, signifying this moment’s nature;
The hare is the lunar spirit, signifying this moment’s emotion.
Their boiling together means nature gathers emotion,
and emotion follows nature—
an image of water and fire in mutual completion.

The tortoise, skilled at concealment, signifies spirit;
The serpent, skilled at coiling, signifies qi.
Their self-coiling means spirit guides qi,
and qi naturally nurtures spirit—
a form of yin and yang in spiral embrace.

Following the previous chapter,
which taught refining emotion and cultivating nature,
so one may drink wine and compose poetry,
the master now fears disciples may cling to distinctions of inner and outer.
Thus, he further instructs to forget form entirely:
nature and emotion, through refining and forging, become boiling;
qi and spirit, through movement and stillness, become coiling.
Naturally, they merge and transform into a single grain of elixir—
vast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all interiors,
intelligence pervading the ten thousand things,
spirit transforming without limit,
fused with the Great Ultimate and ever abiding.

Chen Niniu said,
*“Seize the crow and hare as medicinal ingredients,
take the Great Void as crucible and cauldron,”*
which is precisely the Way of returning to nature and uniting with the Origin.

Master Zixian Xue composed a song:
*“The crow has no form, the hare no shadow,
the crow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon.
When crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.”*
Another song says:
*“The tortoise has no image, the serpent no trace,
the tortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang.
When the two qi unite, they merge into one.”*
Both illustrate nature and emotion, spirit and qi.

The Dao undergoes constant change,
yet one must merge and perfect it to nurture that single grain of cinnabar heart,
responding to circumstances with fluid transformation,
in motion and stillness alike attuned,
uniting inner and outer as one body.
One must not fixate on one side in seeking it.

**[On Chapter 40]**
This chapter, building on the previous one,
reveals that at this stage, yin and yang, spirit and qi,
shift and move without fixed abode—
no division of inner and outer remains.
Whether manifest as ritual and music
or subtle as ghosts and spirits,
all return to my refined emotion and cultivated nature,
warming and nurturing the mechanism of transformation,
leading gradually to the realm of no sound, no scent—
where the elixir is complete!

---

All things born must die,
the primordial spirit dies and revives again.
When spirit returns to the qi cave,
the Dao of the elixir naturally forms.

Spirit here is primordial spirit;
qi is the true qi of the Limitless Primordial Yang.
If one nurtures thus, one may seem to achieve
longevity, deathlessness, joyous freedom—
why then seek elixir completion, immortality, or ancestral mastery?

Yet observe: all things under heaven,
once born, must die.
Even my yang spirit and primordial life,
once before, had perished.
Though now, by secret method, they have revived,
who can guarantee they will not die again?
Such nurturing is not the ultimate resolution.

At this stage, one must advance further,
waiting until the warming and nurturing are fourfold complete
before success is assured.
Why?
Since the opening of the passes and orifices,
my spirit and qi have been nurtured directly, without harm,
filling heaven and earth, penetrating the Three Clarities.
I await the completion of the Great Ultimate
within the natural void,
then arouse a single spark of the Limitless Primordial Yang’s true qi.
I then settle as in the beginning—
this is spirit returning to the qi cave,
unyielding even if earth overturns and heaven collapses.
After a brief moment of such work,
the yang spirit, infused with primordial qi,
manifests in form—
able to ascend and transform,
or dwell in tranquil stillness.
In its substance:
ears hear the nine heavens,
eyes see ten thousand miles,
no hunger from fasting,
no drunkenness from wine,
mouth can dry mercury,
belly can steam cakes.
In its function:
the body radiates light, myriad spirits pay homage,
it can command thunder, clear skies, summon rain.
Ghosts and demons lose their souls at its sight,
spirits and monsters vanish upon encounter.
Yet it remains unmoved before its own reflection,
serene and unchanging,
encompassing all phenomena,
nurturing the primordial spirit—
naturally uniting virtue with heaven and earth,
brightness with sun and moon.
This is uniting with the Origin.

When the primordial spirit is accomplished,
awaiting the moment of transformation,
it merges with the Dao in truth—
as the *Daodejing* says:
*“Work is completed, affairs are settled,
the people all say, ‘It happened naturally.’”*
Who would know that my effort, from beginning to end,
lies solely in nurturing the formless,
in the single secret of spirit returning to the qi cave?
Without true wisdom, intelligence, spiritual power, and non-violence,
who could partake in this?

This is the method of refining form with golden liquid,
thus the yang spirit can manifest in form.

**[On Chapter 41]**
This chapter, together with the preceding five,
all expound the warming and nurturing to complete the elixir.
Ultimately, no artificial effort is needed—
one merely awaits the return of the primordial spirit and true nature,
relying on the yang spirit’s stillness and steadfastness to fulfill its course.
The following seven chapters are all written to dispel doubts,
not to introduce new practices.
Readers will naturally understand.

Where spirit and qi return to the root,
body and mind recover their mandate—
this true aperture,
few indeed know it.

Spirit and qi were discussed in the previous chapter.
The root is the root of heaven and earth,
my primordial nature.
The mandate is the primordial life.
At this stage, one reaches the time of returning to the root and recovering the mandate.
Fearing that people might not know what “returning” refers to,
the master clearly points to the four words: spirit, qi, heart, body.
No longer borrowing metaphors from things,
he clarifies that where spirit and qi return to the root
is precisely when body and mind recover their mandate—
both are the virtue of nature,
the Way of uniting inner and outer.
Thus, its application is always timely,
not imposed from without.
He teaches that one need not seek another aperture—
this single aperture of the seven apertures returning to the root,
once restored to true emptiness,
is the true aperture.
As Master Bai said,
*“Returning to the origin and restoring the source is true emptiness,”*
but in truth, it is simply that when one empties the heart,
the Dao naturally returns.

Laozi’s words, *“All under heaven return to it,”* and Confucius’s words, *“The world returns to ren,”*—how could these refer to some other visible aperture? ○ Above is Chapter Forty-Two. This is to elucidate the aperture of returning, so that people may be enlightened. Thus, Master Bai’s saying, *“Returning to the root and recovering the mandate is the completion of the elixir,”* holds true.

Within the body lies the Mysterious Female,
in the heart, no dust or defilement remains.
Who can comprehend this?
A single aperture contains the true.

Before receiving the true formula, the body lacks the Mysterious Female, so one must diligently wash away the dust from the heart. Once the cleansing deepens and the true formula is attained, with the arrival of the correct command, lead and mercury come together at once, without need for thought or calculation, and naturally retreat into concealment. From this, spirit resides in the Celestial Valley, and qi returns to the Crimson Palace—this is the Mysterious Female. Now that the body contains the Mysterious Female, spirit naturally abides in sincerity, qi naturally flows in depth, and the heart is utterly free of dust or defilement, so no further washing is needed. In this vast and empty state, the heavens stretch boundlessly—who among the unknowing can comprehend it? It is only because my spirit and qi have merged into a single right thought, concealed together within one aperture, nurturing the celestial true, undisturbed by externals. This heart thus becomes a luminous terrace, where dust and defilement cannot leave a trace. This teaches that one need not flee the world or shun desires—dwelling in the dust, one may yet transcend it. In sum, it is a practice of simplicity and ease, enduring and vast.

Master Bai’s words: *“Those who strive yet do not meet must meet a true person. Once the true formula is attained, likes and dislikes are all discarded, and when matters arise, judgment is always fitting. With mastery within, the myriad things cannot enslave me.”* ○ Above is Chapter Forty-Three, which particularly clarifies that upon attaining the formula and completing the elixir, deluded thoughts vanish of themselves. It urges people not to fear difficulty and settle for ease—its words are most earnest!

The true dragon and tiger of *Li* and *Kan*,
the proper horse and ox of *Qian* and *Kun*.

Every person is fully endowed—why then do they not know to cultivate? The *Li* trigram illustrates the postnatal heart: the heart possesses yin essence but lacks restraint, thus like a dragon it runs rampant. The *Kan* trigram illustrates the postnatal body: the body possesses yang qi but lacks return, thus like a tiger it rages fiercely. Here, *Li* and *Kan* are called the true dragon and tiger—yet they must still be captured and tamed. The *Qian* trigram illustrates the prenatal heart, which Confucius in the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “fine horse.” The *Kun* trigram illustrates the prenatal body, which the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “mother-and-calf cow.” Here, *Qian* and *Kun* are called the “proper horse and ox”—for these are all docile by nature.

The cultivation of the elixir is fundamentally nothing more than refining away the obstinacy of the postnatal body and heart, and perfecting the docility of the prenatal nature and life. Every person possesses body and heart, every person is endowed with Heaven’s constant principle—why then do they not know to cultivate? It is because they have not obtained the true formula, and do not know first to conceal their spirit within the One Aperture. Thus, the hun and po are not at peace in the liver and lungs, all overstepping their bounds to usurp the kitchen, acting on likes and dislikes to indulge their joy and anger, daily flowing downward into filth without knowing to return. How lamentable!

The next chapter will clearly expound the method for molding the hun and po.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Four. This continues from the previous chapter, stating that every person possesses the material of immortality, and exhorting them to advance in cultivation.

The hun and po serve as the heart’s master, while spirit and essence are enveloped by intent. Steadfastly conduct the firing process, silently move the initial yang line. Intent is what the heart emits—it is where my thought first stirs. “Enveloped by intent” means to keep this thought constantly in mind, concealed in secrecy. “Steadfastly” means that as soon as a thought arises, it is like a seal matching its imprint, immediately withdrawing and concealing itself. “Silently” is like a commander deliberating affairs alone within the tent, allowing no outside interference—this illustrates how one gathers and trains the spirit to return to life, holding fast to this single intent in secrecy, not permitting the hun and po to usurp the heart’s mastery.

The “initial yang line” is where the thought first stirs. The Dao of the elixir takes spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent as its medicinal ingredients, yet the hun and po are originally stored in the liver and lungs, not the heart’s master. Within the heart, the true spirit naturally dwells in serene stillness, calmly governing the hundred bones, and all follow its commands. When it issues forth as intent, this is the first stirring of the true thought. With firm faith and careful guarding, it gathers the essence and qi, so the hun and po also submit and return to their proper places, enabling me to abide in benevolence and follow righteousness to nurture my virtue and power, which in turn nourishes my spirit.

However, after birth, the heart engages with things and cannot remain concentrated and still. The spirit then flows into qi, and qi flows into essence, causing the qi to become substantial while the spirit becomes empty, leaving the heart without a master to govern the body’s organs. The hun and po, no longer content in their original viscera, instead seek to manipulate the spirit and usurp the heart’s mastery. When the hun—Wood—leaves the liver and dwells in the heart, Fire flares and injures the nature. When the po—Metal—leaves the lungs and dwells in the heart, it is smelted and the emotions flow unchecked. Thus, the hun loses its benevolence and vents its anger, while the po violates righteousness and indulges its desires. From this, anger, fear, likes, dislikes, worries, and disturbances surge within, suddenly and uncontrollably—all because the spirit does not guard its abode, allowing the hun and po to seize its authority and act as the heart’s master.

Therefore, those who practice cultivation, knowing that the hun and po cannot serve as the heart’s master, must first gather and train the spirit, firmly holding to the true thought. When the true thought congeals, the heart and kidneys naturally communicate. The spirit and essence are then enveloped by intent and do not scatter, while the hun and po, drawn to the spirit, return together with it into the intent. This is the gathering of all elements, with the true thought now wielding authority as the heart’s master. Keeping this thought constantly in mind, steadfastly and unmoving, one conducts the fire of quietude and naturalness. Suddenly, one yang returns, silently circulating the Zhou Tian. The hun and po can no longer recklessly interfere with perception, and the yang qi is no longer shaken—it rises directly to meet and unite with the spirit. The true thought also merges to become spirit, and the elixir’s foundation is thus formed. This is the essential formula for gathering and uniting, and when compared with Chapter Sixty below, it further proves that the true thought must first be established.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Five. This continues from the previous chapter, lamenting that people do not know the proper method, and revealing the true formula for molding the hun, casting the po, and gathering the spirit.

Below the heart, above the kidneys,
west of the liver, left of the lungs.
Neither intestines nor stomach,
qi flows freely on its own.

This continues from the previous chapter. “Silently move the initial yang line” means circulating this yang qi—yet how precisely to circulate it, and where it returns, has not been fully revealed. Lest people, doubting, fall into delusion and cause grave error, the text now clearly points out the body’s interconnected passage. Yet it does not speak of a single aperture, but says it lies between the heart and kidneys, west of the liver and left of the lungs—neither in the intestines nor the six viscera. It seems to be in the spleen, yet Chapter Thirty-Eight states, “The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit.” Thus, all substantial places in the body are not the homeland to which the true qi returns. It is only in this empty, secret space, like the Great Ultimate encompassing the Six Directions’ void, where qi naturally flows freely, without stagnation or the labor of circulation. Simply allowing qi to nourish the spirit, it comes and returns repeatedly. Over time, it can form the yang spirit throughout the body, and one may then suddenly comprehend the meaning of the One Aperture.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Six. This further clarifies the true Dao of emptying the heart so qi flows freely, dispelling doubts about seeking apertures and orifices.

The marvelous function does not depend on intention,
The true mechanism requires no timing.
Who can know this aperture?
Yet do not merely indulge in non-action.

This aperture is the secret key, the hidden stem—
it need not be understood as a mere cavity or orifice!
Speaking of the Dao of congealing the elixir:
it fundamentally relies on our true intention, inherently pure and quiescent in its essence.
When essence arrives to unite with qi,
qi then refines essence to become spirit.
At this juncture, the marvelous function arises solely from the wondrous fusion and coagulation of essence and qi—
it does not depend on deliberate effort or contrived intent.
For instance, when yang qi arises,
though Chapter Two speaks of the necessity of "knowing the timing" for gathering,
what is meant by "timing" is merely the true mechanism of subtle awareness within the secret,
not the measured moments of striking clocks or dripping clepsydrae.
Who, indeed, can truly know this aperture of prior withdrawal and concealment?
Thus, at the moment of union,
it is precisely "acting within non-action";
before union occurs,
one must "exert effort within effortlessness"—
this is where our correct mindfulness should reside in non-action.
Until the time of fetal nurturance arrives,
do not prematurely surrender to non-action and fall into boundless dissipation,
losing the opportune moment.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Seven.
This continues the themes of preceding chapters,
clarifying that the subtlety of the true mechanism must not be abandoned to mere non-action,
lest one miss the moment and court danger.
Therefore, our correct mindfulness must be ceaselessly maintained:
in stillness, we cultivate the work of preserving and nourishing correctness;
in movement, we apply the power of reflection and examination,
so as to avoid error.
Should an error occur, one fears a host of ills may arise—
the elixir overturned, life endangered,
all prior efforts lost, and further refinement requiring time.
Formerly, Bai Ziyu of the Southern Lineage’s Five Patriarchs,
though he had not yet awakened to the purport of *Awakening to Reality*,
underwent three refinements and three collapses.
Yet his heaven-endowed talent prevented disaster!

(Sun Lin, in his early years of practice,
knew only to purify the heart
but not how to sustain mindfulness and withdraw into the secret.
It was like chasing a thief while driving away the master of the house—
thus, in stillness, he could not concentrate;
in movement, he lacked directness;
and in matters, he wavered.
This heart was half governed by the hun and po,
and his spirit and essence could not be encompassed by intention.
In the winter of the *xinmao* year,
he was graced by a single phrase from my teacher at his ear—
as if ambrosia poured upon his crown, sweet dew sprinkled upon his heart.
At once, he welcomed the master home,
gradually sensing stillness as emptiness and movement as directness.
Indeed, his daily practice became effortless,
and in matters, he responded smoothly without difficulty.
Yet he had not yet awakened to the prior mechanism,
and this heart remained unable to be constantly responsive and quiescent.
He thus built levees of restraint to guard against transgression.
After another three years,
my teacher imparted this text,
instructing him to purify his heart and withdraw to listen.
When purification reached its limit,
a half-word of marvel arrived—
suddenly, all was opened.
The teacher had deeply mastered the Dao,
wishing Sun Lin to realize it for himself.
Had the time not been ripe,
he might well have heard without comprehending.
I humbly append this account of my arduous learning.)

There is substance, yet it is not nothing;
Non-action harmonizes with action.
The power of transformation returns to one’s grasp—
Sun and Moon congeal golden fat.

Sun and Moon refer to the luminaries,
symbolizing the nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth.
"Golden fat" is an image of concentrating qi to attain softness,
like metal in the crucible, supple as grease—
just as Bai Ziyu said, "Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, soft as silk,"
and Chen Ninwan said, "Soft as a silk floss ball, hard as iron."

Essence and qi are substantial, not insubstantial.
When mercury meets the arising of lead, they congeal;
when lead obtains mercury, it penetrates directly—
these are methods of action.
Yet if these two substances of action are left to linger and turn back,
they will flow downward and refuse to ascend—
this is not good.
But if guided by our non-action’s correct mindfulness,
we gather and unite the two substances of action,
first withdrawing and concealing,
then the heart, free of distraction, returns together to the secret—
this is good.
Thus, the subtle power of creation returns to the grasp of the one who presides over it.
The three great barriers of before and after naturally align with the method,
and one may wander with the Creator, wielding control over its beginning and end.
When our nature and feelings are rectified,
the nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth are also rectified—
hence Zisi transmitted the Dao of harmony and equilibrium,
and the Pure Yang Master spoke of healing the world and praising transformation.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Eight.
This particularly elucidates the function of constantly preserving correct mindfulness,
so vast and potent,
serving as a summation of the meaning of Chapter Forty-Seven.
The following fifteen chapters teach the method of refining the Valley Spirit;
from Chapter Sixty-Four to Seventy, the way of refining the yang spirit;
from Chapter Seventy-One to Seventy-Eight, the method of refining and uniting the original spirit to shed and return to the source.
The principles are profound, the methods simple—
those with the aspiration to advance in cultivation
should further refine and contemplate them,
so that through long familiarity, they may naturally enter the marvelous.

The tiger roars on the western mountain,
The dragon intones in the eastern sea.

Capture it for the wild battle,
Entrust it to the Palace of Gen and Kun.
The tiger, by nature, symbolizes the yin aspect of the body—here, "the tiger roars" metaphorically signifies the near-fullness of yin essence.
The dragon, by nature, symbolizes the yang aspect of the heart—here, "the dragon intones" metaphorically signifies the nascent arising of yang qi.
The western mountain marks the precelestial Gen position, an image of gradual attainment of pure yin.
The eastern sea marks the precelestial Zhen position, an image of the first stirring of solitary yang.
"Wild battle" refers to what Master Bai Zi calls "subduing body and mind."
The Teacher says: "In the postcelestial arrangement, at the juncture of Xu and Hai, within lies Qian—yang enveloped by yin—hence the sixth line of Kun’s hexagram depicts 'dragons battling in the wild.'"
Thus, Han Confucians took Qian as the wild, while earlier Quanzhen masters called the Xu-Hai juncture "the wild."
Confucius’ *Wenyan* states: "When yin congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable—hence 'wild battle.'"
The Palace of Gen and Kun is the Great Yin among the Four Images.
Gen serves as the palace gate, Kun as the closed door—an image of sealing the chamber in profound concealment.
At this juncture, the three treasures of ears, eyes, and mouth must be shut and not allowed to communicate; this is the marvel of secret concealment in contemplation, the very method of refinement.
It speaks of the moment when one lies in repose, the nocturnal qi just arising—precisely when true yin is nearly full, and within the heart’s center a single drop of yin essence has gathered.
Suddenly, upon awakening, this is the moment of extreme yin giving birth to yang: beneath the Kun body, a single point of yang qi stirs, and yin essence naturally congeals to engage yang in battle.
At that instant, correct mindfulness detects it—hastily withdraw and conceal within the secret aperture.
This is the subduing of body and mind, where essence and qi naturally merge as one, surging upward through the spine to settle in its rightful position, then issuing forth as divine water to suffuse the entire body.
I remain concentrated for a brief moment—this is entrusting it to the Palace of Great Yin, the very Dao of withdrawing and concealing in secrecy.
"Capture" and "entrust" merely reflect the retrospective contemplation of the initial union of these two substances, as if through the power of my stillness they were seized and concealed.
During the practice itself, one must not entertain the slightest deliberation.

※ The *Wenyan* of the *Book of Changes*’ Kun hexagram states: "When yin congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable, for it suspects the absence of yang." The ancient text originally read: "When yang congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable, for it is overlaid with yang." *Yi* (doubt) was written as *ning* (congeal), *xian* (suspect) as *jian* (overlay), and the character *wu* (absence) was omitted. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, all Quanzhen predecessors have followed this version, and thus it is retained here to explicate the natural coagulation of the highest-grade elixir.

○ Above is Chapter Forty-Nine.
This chapter speaks of timely preservation of mindfulness to first conceal, using the subduing of body and mind as the marvelous method for gathering, uniting, and refining.
Though the explanation is slow, the coagulation is swift—all depends on attaining clarity and stillness.
At the moment of awareness, withdraw and conceal; concentrate for a brief moment—this is "capturing and entrusting."
The so-called Palace of Gen and Kun refers precisely to this moment of concentration, not some obscure yin realm.
One must never seek traces or pursue signs, lest one deviate from the true intent of the alchemical blade.

The *Fù* hexagram governs the transition from darkness to light—from obscurity to clarity—while *Lún* governs the shift from dawn to dusk. The elixir furnace congeals into pure white snow; there is no place to seek the heart of the monkey.

*Fù* is the hexagram of *yin* reaching its extreme and *yang* emerging anew, illustrating the moment in the human body when stillness reaches its peak and movement begins, when *yang* qi first stirs. *Jié* is the hexagram of *yang* flourishing and *yin* arising, depicting the moment when the mind’s agitation reaches its height and stillness follows, when *yin* essence spontaneously generates.

The *Lún* hexagram—*Zhèn* below, *Kǎn* above—represents movement within peril, for when *yang* qi first stirs, *yin* essence immediately congeals within. This is the moment of danger: when difficulty arises, one must swiftly conceal the true mind and withdraw to listen as this qi breaks through the peril and ascends straight—only then can clarity be achieved.

The *Méng* hexagram—*Kǎn* below, *Gèn* above—represents peril beneath and stillness above, symbolizing that when the mind perceives the qi just beginning to form, it seeks to seize it, a moment of danger. One must immediately quiet the mind, withdraw first, and not disrupt this qi—this is the way of nurturing what is true.

"Clarity and obscurity, dawn and dusk" speak of movement, as when night gives way to morning; movement returning to stillness, as when day fades into evening—all follow the natural flow of qi. "Govern" and "direct" mean that true qi naturally governs and directs, embodying stillness and upright movement.

If one only collects and restrains body and mind without allowing them to sway, this is what Zhang Zai meant by *"Let the other be host, I the guest."* Here, "the other" refers to qi, and "I" to the mind—then the elixir furnace naturally congeals, and white snow spreads throughout the body, with no stray thoughts to intrude. Even if one wishes to purify the mind, there is no trace of its arising or vanishing to be found.

White snow is the *shénshuǐ* [spirit-water]; its meaning has already been explained in Chapter Five. The "monkey’s heart" refers to, before attaining the secret, all contrived perceptions and all delusive thoughts and stray notions.

○ **Chapter Fifty**. This continues from the previous chapter, elaborating further on the method of gathering and refining.

「] The black mercury yields yellow leaves, the red lead unfurls purple blossoms. One must further proceed with the fire’s alchemy, within the cauldron to congeal the cinnabar essence.

The "heart’s essence" (*xīn jīng*) has already followed the body’s *qi* and ascended, hence the metaphor of "black mercury." The "body’s *qi*" has absorbed the yin essence and become spirit, hence "red lead." When it is said "to yield yellow leaves," it means the black mercury has already contained the yang *qi*, harmonizing with the pure yin *kūn tǔ* [yin earth], and congealing for a moment—now having obtained the nourishing earth *qi*, it yields the tender yellow leaves, the first sprouts of the yellow shoot. **Qu Jun** said, *"The leaves bear the yin essence and flourish with the yang *qi*, likening yin congealing within yang and the auspicious signs of cinnabar formation."* When it unfurls purple blossoms, it means the red lead also relies on the black mercury, and during that moment of shared stillness, it has already obtained the fire *qi*’s vaporous influence—thus, it unfurls purple blossoms, for the hue between water and fire is purple. **Qu Jun** said, *"The purple blossoms are the fruit’s seed-pod, likening water receiving fire’s aid and the initial foundation for cinnabar formation."*

At this juncture, if one recklessly indulges outward distractions, the spirit-*qi* will still scatter—how can it be permanently congealed to form the *gǔshén* [embryonic spirit]? One must urgently set aside body and mind, firmly store the true thought, and hold the luminous stillness as the alchemical fire’s refinement.

Like an infant’s focused *qi* to attain softness, neither forgetting nor aiding—when one observes its eyes are open, the heart-*qi* is abundant, as if the cinnabar essence congeals within the cauldron. Its virtue/power (*déxìng*) is firm and congealed, and its *qi*’s nature is also steadied—only then can it be called the *gǔshén*, yet it still cannot preserve its immortality.

○ **Chapter Fifty-One**. This continues from the previous chapter, further elucidating the method of mutual absorption and alchemical refinement.

] The wood essence must guard against the hare, the metal essence must further forbid the rooster. Wood symbolizes nature, and the mind arises from nature, hence "wood essence." The hare, in the earthly branches, belongs to *mǎo* [wood], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Léi Tiān Dà Zhuàng* [Thunder-Heaven, Great Strength]—a hexagram where yang *qi* flourishes beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the mind has already attained its proper grandeur; upon seeing a petty person, it recoils as one would from foul stench. Anger arises with the world’s transformations, and fire erupts from wood—it will inevitably counter-naturally subdue itself, hence one must guard against it. If one waits for anger to manifest before restraining it, then nature is already disordered and the *gǔkūn* [embryonic earth] is in peril! Hence the saying, *"The gentleman does not tread where there is no propriety"*—this is how one steadies nature. Nature steadied, then the great is truly strong! Guard against it to remove moral obstacles.

Metal symbolizes emotion, and the body arises from emotion, hence "metal essence." The rooster, in the earthly branches, belongs to *yǒu* [metal], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Fēng Dì Guān* [Wind-Earth, Contemplation]—a hexagram where yin *qi* grows beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the body has already thrived; upon encountering external stimuli, it succumbs to lustful desires, and the emotion overpowers—water leaks, metal withers—making it difficult to control emotion, hence one must further forbid it. If one waits for desire to stir before suppressing it, then emotion is already drawn and the *gǔshén* is in jeopardy! Hence the saying, *"The gentleman contemplates his own life"*—this is how one checks desire and forgets emotion. Emotion forgotten, then Contemplation is effortless! Forbid it to sever the demon of passion.

Drawing and adding must be accompanied by bathing, precisely at the time of the full moon. If one practices such guarding and forbidding as drawing and adding, true *qi* will naturally circulate within the body, vaporously bathing and nourishing—from this point onward, one progresses. Just as in the hexagram *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], one must take its hexagram virtue/power (*guàdé*), ruling *qi* with spirit, yielding to respond to the strong. Thus, my nature and emotions become harmonious and my spirit-*qi* flows freely, like the moon’s approaching fullness. Yet beware of self-praise and self-satisfaction, of exhausting *qi* and straining spirit—one must still retreat and hide deeply, imitating the gentleman’s bestowing of blessings upon others yet not dwelling in his own virtue/power, so that the heart expands and the body becomes plump, preserving fullness without overflow.

○ **Chapter Fifty-Two**. This continues from the previous three chapters, instructing on the method of bathing.

] A thousand sounds stir with the first wind, a thousand peaks embrace the full moon.

「Swiftly issue the correct precepts, then one may circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven, Circulation].
A thousand sounds symbolize the myriad orifices of the body, a thousand peaks represent the channels traversing the entire form.
When a person’s body and mind, nature and emotions, are refined to this stage, the spirit is complete and the *qi* is full, the myriad orifices open freely, and the channels are clear as crystal.
Just as the first wind stirs all sounds, and the moon’s initial fullness illuminates the thousand peaks—this marks the transition from *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], approaching the realm of *Chunyang* [Pure Yang, *Qián*].
It is the moment when the primordial command is about to revive, and the moment when the discerning spirit is about to transform.

If one does not strictly and closely preserve this internally, then when the body’s myriad orifices are fully open, the **Three Corpses and Nine Vermin** (*sānshī jiǔchóng*) will seize the opportunity to intrude and plunder. They will seize my **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*), causing it to escape through the body’s orifices, unaware of its dispersion—whether it becomes **flying, hidden, moving, rooted, fetal, ovate, moist, or transformed** (*wéi fēi, wéi qián, wéi dòng, wéi zhí, wéi tāi, wéi luǎn, wéi shī, wéi huà*).
It will take form according to one’s lifelong inclinations, and even one’s rightful awareness will be lost along with it. Thus, though one may not die, they will become dull and lifeless!
This is why those who know only how to advance but not retreat will inevitably meet regret.
Therefore, at this time, one must urgently reiterate the correct precepts.
Strengthen vigilance, maintain meticulous and sustained practice, guarding the **Precepts of the Embracing Bag** (*Guābā zhēn*), revering the **Symbol of the Leaping Abyss** (*Yuèyuān xiàng*).
Achieve emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the revival of the primordial command (*yuánmìng*), then the discerning spirit will naturally transform, and one may broadly circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven].
○ **Chapter Fifty-Three**. This follows the previous chapter, teaching the Dao/Way of maintaining secrecy.

Medicinal substances must be distinguished by their aged or fresh qualities; the fire’s intensity must be adjusted by **drawing and adding** (*chōu tiān*).
When the **single grain of Elixir Light** (*dān guāng*) arises, the **Cold Toad** (*hán chán*) emits radiance toward the **Jade Eaves** (*yù yán*).
Medicinal substances refer to the revived primordial command (*lái fù zhī yuánmìng*), when the *qi* is excessive, it is aged; when insufficient, it is fresh.
One’s constitution and *qi* nature vary, and at this juncture of maintaining fullness, if one’s temperament is slightly unbalanced—
the bold may rush forward to meet it and thus lose through **suddenness** (*zhòu*), the timid may falter and fail to act, thus losing through **cowardice** (*qiè*).
The sudden will grasp it too quickly, and the medicinal substance remains fresh; the timid will obtain it too late, and the medicinal substance becomes aged—both miss the **middle fire intensity** (*zhōng huǒhòu*).
Hence, my correct precepts must carefully examine one’s *qi* nature and constitution:
“**The forceful must not befriend the overbearing** (*qiáng fú yǒu gāng*), **the harmonious must befriend the yielding** (*xiè yǒu róu*), **the deep and hidden must overcome the overbearing** (*shěn qián gāng*), **the lofty and bright must overcome the yielding** (*gāo míng róu*).”
One must adhere strictly to this balance of **moderation and rectitude** (*píngkāng zhèngzhí*), maintaining secrecy within the rules, acting only at the right time—
then the medicinal substance will be perfectly suited, and subsequent **warming and nourishment** (*wēn yǎng*) will be effortless.

Thus, at this time, the fire’s intensity must be drawn and added appropriately, while still observing the strict and secret precepts.
Suddenly, the single grain of Elixir Light (*dān guāng*) radiates forth, and one feels within the body like thunder or lightning—
this is the sign of the primordial command’s revival (*yuánmìng lái fù*).
Even if it ascends straight to the peak, it will eventually rest in the **Heavenly Valley** (*Tiāngǔ*), as described in the later **Chapter Sixty-Four**:
“**Retaining Mercury in the Golden Tripod**” (*liú gǒng jū jīn dǐng*).
One then perceives the pulse ceasing and breathing stopping, a moment of **boundless stillness** (*míngmò piànsī*), followed by a sense of **expansive heart and plump body** (*xīn guǎng tǐ pán*).
The skin feels refreshed and clear, all old ailments vanish, and there are no more dreams or slumber.
For the **Soul** (*hún*) has already melted into the spirit-*qi*, and the **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*) has merged with the revived primordial command to become the **initial foundation of the Yang Spirit** (*yángshén zhī chūjī*).
Though the Heavenly *qi* has already returned to the body, the Yang Spirit is just forming—
like the faintest glimmer of the **Toad’s light** after the Winter Solstice (*dōngzhì*), which still requires **warming and nourishment**.
The light has not yet fully emerged from the eaves, hence the saying: *“the Cold Toad emits radiance toward the Jade Eaves”* (*hán chán shè yù yán*).

The fool notes: **The Gold Elixir’s three hundred days of cultivation** (*jīndān sān bǎi rì gōngfū*)
commences at this stage, when **preheaven true *qi*** (*xiāntiān zhēnqì*) begins to condense into spirit, allowing one to advance the Dao/Way without obstruction.
Recently, other alchemical texts (*dānshū*) describe this stage and hastily write of the **Yang Spirit manifesting** (*yángshén xiànxíng*), yet this is still **spirit dispersing** (*shénchí*).
If they say it manifests within the body, it is still unsatisfactory.
As for the phrase *“manifesting form”* (*xiànxíng*), I do not know from where its phantom image arises.
The **Pure Yang Master’s** (*Chunyáng Zǐ*) *Qiaocao Song* [Divining-Stick Strike Song] states:
*“With three lead, one lead is obtained, yet the Golden Fruit and Immortal Herb have not yet manifested form.”*
This serves as proof!

○ **Chapter Fifty-Four**.」

「This follows upon the preceding chapter, elucidating the intent of **urgent rectification** (*zhènglìng*), which is the **Dao of division and gestation** (*fēntāi*). Indeed, its foundation has long been laid in the **hidden subtlety** (*yòumì*) of **preheaven true *qi*** (*xiāntiān zhēnqì*) through day and night! Thus, when **original essence and destiny** (*yuánmìng*) return to their source, this is the **success of the Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén chénggōng*), the moment when one may **retain form and not die** (*liúxíng bùsǐ*)—the **initial formation of the Pure Yang Spirit** (*zhèngyángshén chūjié*).

The **nurturing and warming** (*wēnyǎng*) practices are detailed in **Chapter Sixty-Four** and beyond, while the following nine chapters expound upon the **essentials of returning the elixir** (*huándān*) and further reinforce the **exhortation to earnest practice** (*quànmiǎn zhī cí*).

---
**The Pearl within the Shell is easily split, the Hen’s Egg within the Nest is readily found.**
From **nothingness, somethingness arises** (*wúzhōng shēngyǒu*), as **spirit-*qi*** (*shénqì*) naturally interpenetrates.
It speaks of how even **subtle things** (*wéiwù*) know to **remain still and focused** (*jìngzhuān*) until **somethingness is achieved** (*yǒuchéng*).
Like the shell containing the pearl, like the hen brooding the egg—all belong to **somethingness arising from nothingness** (*wúzhōng néngshēng yǒuwù*).
Thus, one’s **elixir Dao** (*dān dào*) must be **steadfast and sincere** (*héngchéng*).
Only when **spirit-*qi* is steadfast and unshaken** (*shénzhù bùyí*), when **concentrated *qi* yields softness** (*zhuāngqì zhìróu*), and when **subtlety is sustained without interruption** (*mìmì miánmián*), will **spirit-*qi* naturally interpenetrate and coalesce**—this is all there is to it.
○ **Chapter Fifty-Five**.»
This uses **material analogies to illustrate human practice** (*wùyǐ pìrén*), and further implies the **Dao of natural nurturing and warming after division and gestation** (*fēntāi hòu zìrán wēnyǎng*). Can humans not surpass even these analogies?

---
**Spirit-*qi* is not parent-child, the body-mind is not husband-wife.**
But only when one **harmonizes with the celestial mechanism** (*hé tiānjī*), will anyone recognize the **place where the elixir is formed** (*jié dān chù*).
This is due to the **master-transmitted alchemical texts** (*shīchuán dānshū*) of former generations, which often use terms like **parent-child** (*zǐmǔ*) and **husband-wife** (*fūfù*), to metaphorically describe **spirit-*qi* and body-mind** (*shénqì shēnxīn*).
The **parent-child analogy** (*zǐmǔ zhī yù*) is still too disjointed, while the **husband-wife analogy** (*fūfù zhī yù*) falls into the error of **deliberate fabrication** (*wàngzuò*).
Thus, I particularly clarify that these are metaphors for **spirit-*qi* and body-mind** (*shénqì shēnxīn*), not actual **parent-child** (*zǐmǔ*) or **husband-wife** (*fūfù*).
I instruct students not to be **entangled in the literal wording** (*ní dānwén*), but only to comprehend the **timely celestial mechanism** (*shí míng hé tiān jī*), which begins with **action** (*yǒuwéi*) and ends with **non-action** (*wúwéi*).
**Refining yin essence** (*yīnjīng*) into **Pure Yang Spirit** (*yángshén*)—
when **spirit condenses and *qi* gathers** (*shénníng qìjù*), the elixir naturally forms.
If asked where the elixir is formed, it is only within **formlessness and profound seclusion** (*wúxiàng yōudú*), where **perfect substance arises from nothingness** (*wánzhì shēngxiàng*).
It is merely the **practice of nurturing *qi*** (*yǎngqì zhī shí*), where the **substantial essence of concentrated spirit** (*shénníng zhī shí*) is directed toward **stillness and emptiness** (*jìngxū*), and the **void of condensed spirit** (*shénníng zhī xū*) returns to **my steadfast substance** (*wú dūshí*).
With time, it becomes **strong and robust** (*gāngjiàn*), and thus **radiance emerges** (*suǐyǒu guānghuī*).
Therefore, the **Pure Yang Spirit manifests** (*yángshén xiànxíng*), and the **celestial *qi*** (*tiānqì*) returns—who can truly recognize this?
○ **Chapter Fifty-Six**.»
**Rejecting false visions of seeking emptiness** (*pìchú mìkōng wàngjiàn*), and **clarifying the application of true mechanism** (*zhǎnmíng yùnyòng zhēnjī*).

「The **elixir’s initial formation** (*dāntóu chūjié chù*), when the **medicinal substances condense** (*yàowù yǐníng shí*).
The **Dragon and Tiger engage in mutual combat** (*Lóng Hǔ jiāoxiàng zhàn*), yet the **Eastern Sovereign remains unaware** (*Dōngjūn zǒng bùzhī*).
It is said that when the **celestial *qi* obtains the refined essence** (*qì dé jīng jiān ér shàng tòu*) and they **coalesce upward** (*jīng suì níng qì yǐ chéng shén*), this is the **elixir’s initial formation** (*dāntóu chūjié zhī chù*), the very moment when the **medicinal substances condense** (*yàowù yǐ níng zhī shí*).
One must know that the **essence condenses within the *qi*** (*jīng níng yú qì*) like the **Dragon and Tiger’s mutual combat** (*Lóng Hǔ zhī jiāoxiàng*), yet my **true directive** (*zhēnglìng*) has long since **retired into secrecy** (*tùicáng yú mì*).
Those who fail to recognize this remain unaware, hence the **celestial *qi* naturally overcomes** (*qì zì zhànshèng*).
As **Zhangzi** says: *“Only after the battle can one behold the Sage”* (*“Zhànbà fāngnéng jiàn shèngrén” yě*).
○ **Chapter Fifty-Seven**.
This further clarifies that the **interaction and refinement** (*jiāojié shēngliàn*) occur in a single instant, and with the **dispelling of the forty-nine chapters’ futile speculations** (*pòchú sìshíjiǔzhāng nèi zhuōqí yǔyán*), it teaches one to **know the hidden and the revealed** (*zhī lái cáng wǎng*), to **neither forget nor assist** (*wùwàng wùzhù ér yǐ*).

○ **Chapter Fifty-Eight**.
**Marginal and minor methods** (*pángmén bìng xiǎofǎ*), **heterodox techniques and idle words** (*yìshù jí xián yán*).
The **Golden Elixir Reversion Formula** (*Jīnyè huán dān jué*)—**no other path exists** (*hún wú dìèr mén*).
It is said that this **Golden Elixir Reversion Formula** (*Jīnyè huán dān zhèng jué*) is the **unified, singular Dao** (*yī bùèr fǎmén*) of the **Buddha’s Great Vehicle** (*fózǔ dàshuàn zhèngzōng*) and the **Confucian *Zhōngyōng* Way** (*Kǒngmén Zhōngyōng zhìdào*).
It does not compare to **marginal methods** (*pángmén*), which **invite misfortune and disaster** (*yìshù rěn rén rěhuò zhāoyāng*), nor to **minor techniques and idle words** (*xiǎofǎ xián yán*), which **lead only to wasted effort** (*tú fèi gōnglì ér yǐ*).

○ **Note by Yanglin**: Marginal methods and heterodox techniques—my teacher has never explicitly pointed them out, and I, Lin, am unaware of their details. Only upon reading **Fourth Patriarch Chen Nihuan of the Southern School’s** (*Nánzōng sìzǔ Chén Níhuán zhēnrén*) *Emerald Void Chant* (*Cuìxū yín*) did I discern the **orthodox and heretical** (*xiézhōng*), as clear as the **radiant sun illuminating the azure sky** (*rào rì zhī lì qīngtiān*). The following is appended for reference. ○ **Chapter Fifty-Eight**.」

「To teach the Dao and select methods, one must first distinguish clearly between orthodoxy and heresy—only then can one avoid straying into **marginal methods**.

Whether noble or humble, high or low,
husband and wife, brothers and kin—
if one has the **portion** (*fèn*) for cultivating the Dao,
all may study the **Alchemical Canon**.

For the **Way of Nurturing the Transcendent**, it matters not rank or gender—
only that one remains in one’s proper place, diligently tends to one’s duties,
and sincerely resolves to cultivate.
Then one is among those **destined** (*yǒu fèn*), a kin of the **Immortal House**.
Such **Alchemical Canons** are for all to read.
○ **Chapter Sixty-Nine.**
This is an exhortation to the multitude, declaring all may learn together.

A broken house is easily repaired,
a spent medicine is not hard to regrow.
Yet one need only return to the **Law**—
then gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains.

Though the previous chapter declared all may cultivate,
I fear worldly scholars might mishear idle words of **heterodox methods**,
and sigh that their **medicine is spent**, abandoning hope of transcendent practice.

Yet the **Supreme Authentic Alchemy** of the **Complete Reality** requires no aged materials—
its essence lies in **spirit-qi** (*shénqì*), which pierces heaven and earth,
knowing no division of youth or age.
A single moment of **spirit’s stillness** is a moment of **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*),
a single moment of **clear vital intent** is a moment of **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).
If one steadfastly guards this moment’s **spirit**, one nourishes this moment’s **qi** in circulation.
Thus, through unbroken, enduring practice,
**qi nourishes spirit**, spirit condenses, and **essence spontaneously generates qi**.
As **essence daily thrives**, spirit grows vibrant—
**spirit-water** irrigates, the **Sea of Qi** fills,
and **yang-qi** naturally ascends, penetrating upward,
condensing **essence into spirit**.
When **spirit is complete** and **qi is full**,
one reverses aging, returning to infancy—
this is the **Law of Return**.
What difficulty is there in the **medicine**?
Thus I liken the body to a house:
if one but wills to repair it, it will soon mend.
The **medicine within** is not hard to regenerate—
only gather the mind, refine the heart, and conceal them in secrecy,
and **spirit will return**, **qi will restore itself**.
Day by day, month by month,
gold and treasure will pile like mountains within—
as **Zhūyáng Zhāngzǐ** said:
*“When does the true gold of a house ever decay?”*
This too speaks of the same.
○ **Chapter Seventy.**
This continues from the previous chapter,
encouraging even the aged to undertake cultivation.»

In sum, so long as breath remains, life and nature still belong to me.
When spirit stands firm and unyielding,
qi flows ceaseless and continuous—
this resolve must not falter in the least.

The following three chapters then expound the **Law of Return**.

The soul and vital essence form three natures,
spirit and qi gather the Five Phases.
Within them, four symbols divide,
concentrating to form the embryonic essence.

Human nature is fundamentally one,
bestowed by Heaven (as the field above, grass below) upon my heart,
while soul and vital essence reside in liver and lungs,
originally not permitted to stand alongside the heart.

The Master Qú remarked:
*“Before cultivation, the heart of right and wrong is indeed one’s innate nature.
Its branches and offshoots, its conflicting tendencies—
these are the work of the soul;
its partiality and stubbornness, its disregard for justice—
these are the work of the vital essence.”*

Li Shàn’s annotation in the *Wénxuǎn* states:
*“The soul is the essence of the body, the vital essence the resolve of nature;
both can divide the authority of true nature.”*
This principle is most clear.

Thus, when ordinary people encounter matters,
their first thought is pure and clear—
rooted in the heart, it is true intention;
but when a second thought arises,
it is the soul’s doing—
though doubt may linger, it is not yet wholly corrupt;
until the third thought decides,
it is the vital essence’s creation—
pure yin, entirely selfish.
Man has but one nature,
yet the heart, seduced by external things, cannot discern good from evil,
and thus allows soul, vital essence, and intention to rule together—
a state of three ministers in one kingdom.
Hence it is said: *“The soul and vital essence form three natures.”*

Yet the soul of the East Wood truly gives birth to the spirit of South Fire,
and the vital essence of West Metal truly generates the essence of North Water.
The Dao of the Elixir draws from spirit and qi,
which in turn depend on soul and vital essence for their origin—
thus soul and vital essence are the mother of spirit and qi,
and spirit and qi are the sign of life and nature.
Therefore, one must gather the Five Phases into one
to fully achieve the Dao of the Elixir.

The Classic says:
*“To sincerely intend, first perfect knowledge;
when knowledge is perfected, one exhausts principle and nature reveals itself.”*
Thus, those who cultivate must first exhaust principle and perfect nature,
establishing great defenses—
when nature is perfected, the heart naturally becomes firm and resolute,
and supreme authority no longer drifts elsewhere.

On one hand, gather spirit and establish unshakable faith and vigilance,
dividing soul, vital essence, and spirit into the four symbols within.
Condense essence to gather the vital essence,
calm spirit to conceal the soul—
since spirit and qi depend on soul and vital essence for their origin,
soul and vital essence are thus gathered into spirit and qi.
When intention is pure and still,
the four symbols cluster in the hidden and secret place—
this is the gathering of the Five Phases’ qi into one,
condensed and firmly established as embryonic essence.

As Master Zhāng said:
*“Two elixirs combined, refining soul and vital essence into sacred spirit.”*
When soul and vital essence are transformed,
spirit naturally condenses,
and my nature and emotions may be steadied.
This chapter, when compared with the forty-fifth above, reveals even greater wonder.

○ **Chapter Sixty-One.**
This continues from the two preceding chapters,
illustrating that exhausting principle and perfecting nature are essential to the Dao.
When nature is steadied, one may align with the Way.

○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**
Determine the will to seek lead and mercury,
quiet the heart to find earth and gold.
Only then does one recognize the true unity—
who can fathom this profound depth?

The will is the matter my nature points toward—
my original resolve.
Earth and gold refer to the stillness of pure yin, the *Kūn* soil concealing a point of *Qián* gold—
when *Wu* rests in *Kūn*, forming *Kǎn*—
this is the initial stir of my true intention.

This follows from the previous chapter:
when nature is steadied, the will is also steadied,
and from this, the seven orifices return to their root.
Focused intent and silent heart
are the method of seeking yang qi and yin essence.
When qi and essence awaken in harmony,
one must still maintain a silent, ashen heart—
this is the way to seek true intention and contain spirit.
Thus, when spirit condenses and qi becomes still,
all return to the true, unerring unity within—
naturally merging to form the Elixir.

Master Bái said:
*“When the will is not scattered, it condenses into spirit.
A silent, ashen heart—within, the Elixir forms.”*
Such profound and abyssal learning—
who can truly recognize it?

○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**
This too continues from the previous chapter,
revealing the secret method of establishing life.

○ **Chapter Sixty-Three.**
Creation has no root or stem,
yin and yang have their origin.
These true mysteries—
fathers do not transmit them to sons.

The nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth is the root of creation;
the named mother of all things is the origin of yin and yang.
Indeed!
Yet this most subtle and profound secret
can only be grasped by the heart—
it cannot be easily spoken of.

Let us first speak of creation, yin, and yang by name.
Creation is the power Heaven alone wields to give birth to all things—
the natural, intentional Way of Heaven.
Yin and yang are what man and all things share with Heaven and Earth,
rooted in the boundless, primordial *Yīqì*—
the unborn, unending, empty, and natural Way of non-action.

From non-being arises being—creation;
from being returns non-being—transformation.
This is spoken of in terms of birth and death.
Extreme motion becomes stillness—yin;
extreme stillness returns to motion—yang.
This is spoken of in terms of circulation and return.
Birth and death pertain to form and substance,
circulation and return pertain to spirit and qi.

Since man and all things’ form and substance arise from the condensation of spirit and qi,
when man obtains yin essence and yang qi at the beginning,
spirit is born—
this is the root of life.
Why does this chapter specifically speak of non-action as the root?
Because the world does not know that the **Law of Return** originates from parents,
whose natural essence and qi construct this body.
Once the umbilical cord is severed at birth,
it is as though the root is cut and the stem falls.
Though the spirit and qi received from Great Creation vary in quantity,
determining one’s lifespan—
the virtuous may prolong it slightly,
the unvirtuous may shorten it—
the wise and foolish neither extend nor shorten it,
but follow or resist it, exhausting their allotted measure.
Early or late, all return to dissolution,
once more entering the furnace of Great Creation.
Thus, all things cannot escape fate.

The lifespan’s birth year, month, and day are called *mingzào* (命造), while death’s year, month, and day are called *huàmìng* (化命). The *Exhortation to Virtue* speaks of prolonging life or shortening it, and of fate being exhausted leading to death—all asserting that what is formed must perish, and what is created must transform. Hence, it is said, *"Zàohuà wú gēntí"* (造化无根蒂).

Though the yin essence and yang qi within a human body are also rooted in what Heaven endows, Heaven and Earth themselves rely on these yin and yang to form shapes and bodies. Heaven and Earth merely forget their forms and bodies, not burdening their spirit with material substance, thus using this yin and yang to give birth to all beings.

Humans are the most refined of all things, knowing to revere the high and humble the low, imitating Heaven and following Earth, cultivating emptiness within and substance without to nourish the formless. Within them, the interplay of these two qi moves like the *Wújí Yuānbù* (无极元始) qi—endlessly swelling and waning, like fish in water, perpetually interconnected.

Yet those who do not return to the source are like a single ladle of water or a pinch of earth—played with briefly before the ladle shatters and the pinch scatters, with water returning to the sea and dust to the earth. But those who return to the source naturally align with their origin. A ladle of water preserved without clinging to its vessel remains ever in its source; a pinch of earth settled with sincerity cultivates virtue without ceasing. Over time, water gathers into lakes, earth accumulates into mountains—gradually filling lakes to become seas, embracing emptiness to merge with the *Tàiqīng* (太清), condensing to expand mountains into earth, bearing *Huáyuè* (华岳) with solidity. All this is the original essence of that ladle of water and pinch of earth.

Humans accumulate essence and qi to form spirit, refine emptiness and nourish vastness to attain the Dao—this belongs to the intrinsic response to the source. Laozi’s *"Gǔshén bùsǐ"* (谷神不死) is rooted with Heaven and Earth at the *Xuānpìn* (玄牝) gate! Hence, it is said, *"Yīnyáng yǒu běnyuán"* (阴阳有本源)—though this is only a *zhōngpǐn* (中品) explanation.

As for the *shàngpǐn* (上品) elixir method, there exists a prior move, a direct path through the *Kǒngdào* (孔道), where the *Xuānguān* (玄关) may be instantly realized. One naturally perceives the mysteries of the *Dàodé* (道德) first chapter, knowing that human spirit shares the same *zàohuà* (造化) as Heaven and Earth—that is, the same *Yuānbù miàowúwéi* (元始妙无为) root.

Human qi, like all things, draws from yin and yang—that is, from the *Língbǎo miàoyǒuwéi* (灵宝妙有为) source. It is not like the laborious gathering of multitudes or heaps of earth; it requires only a sincere, unshaken thought, ensuring uninterrupted practice and swift return.

Thus, when discussing *zàohuà* through yin and yang, these belong to the post-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *sèsēn* (色身). If lifespan is neither prolonged nor shortened, and one adheres to the *shàn dào* (善道) of guarding death, this is the *Dàrén* (大人) practicing *"Hòutiān ér fèng tiānshí"* (后天而奉天时).

Hence, Yán Zǐ did not die young—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to perish, but because he could *"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào"* (常无以观其妙). Zháojí did not live long—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to dissolve, but because he failed to *"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào"*.

If *zàohuà* is understood through yin and yang, then *zàohuà* originates from the pre-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *fǎshēn* (法身). If wisdom and fate can restore their source and return to their origin, they naturally respond to all things in constancy, attaining their true nature. This is the *Dàrén* practicing *"Xiāntiān ér tiān bù wéi"* (先天而天不违).

Thus, beings cycle through the *Liùdào* (六道) wheel, while sages and kings cannot become Buddhas because they sacrifice their *fǎshēn* to yin and yang’s likes and dislikes, failing to *"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào"* (常有以观其徼). The *Wén Dì*’s seventeen incarnations, Laozi’s eighty-one transformations—these follow yin and yang’s movement and stillness, thus able to *"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào"*.

Hence, it is said:
*"Sèsēn píng zàohuà, yóu tiān bù yóu jǐ"* (色身凭造化，由天不由己)—since one has no root to rely on.
*"Fǎshēn guàn yīnyáng, yóu wǒ bù yóu tiān"* (法身贯阴阳，由我不由天)—since one has a source to penetrate.

Heaven aids the sincere; nothing is unlucky.

Yet all things arise from existence, and existence from non-existence. Non-existence is the source of existence, while existence is the root of non-existence. Thus, existence and non-existence are movement and stillness; movement and stillness are yin and yang; yin and yang are *zàohuà*; *zàohuà* are existence and non-existence.

I need not distinguish between existence and non-existence, yin and yang, creation and transformation. Only in my every movement and stillness do they mutually root, without preference or aversion, following the *Wángdào* (王道).

If one nourishes the *fǎshēn* with the *sèsēn*, then gathering is form, scattering is qi. If one stabilizes the *sèsēn* with the *fǎshēn*, stillness becomes the *Jīndān* (金丹), movement becomes thunderous lightning. What birth, what death, what preservation, what annihilation?

As Mèngzǐ said:
*"Tiān shòu bù èr, xiūshēn yǐ sì zhī, suǒyǐ lì mìng yě."*
(天寿不贰，修身以俟之，所以立命也.)
How could there be a division between life and death?

And again:
*"Wànwù jiē bèi yú wǒ yǐ! Fǎnshēn ér chéng, lè mò zài yān."*
(万物皆备于我矣！反身而诚，乐莫在焉.)
How could there be a distinction between preservation and annihilation?

Thus, one may awaken to the effortless ease of those who are ever responsive and ever still!

Qi is like water, spirit like earth. Qi is what fate depends on; spirit is what nature entrusts. The wise delight in water to nourish qi, acting without contrivance to cultivate wisdom. The virtuous take joy in mountains to solidify spirit, dwelling in earth to cultivate sincerity without wavering, thus fostering tranquility.

Let me exhaust this principle of simultaneously cultivating nature and fate: first, store the spirit in the heart; settle the spirit to still the mind; forget the mind to nourish the form; forget the form to nourish the qi; forget the qi to nourish the spirit; forget the spirit to nourish the void.

Thus, one attains **Master Yan’s** *zuòwáng* (坐忘), exhausting one’s nature to fulfill fate, and further forgetting the void to merge with the Dao—then Heaven itself will grant one sainthood, and the Original Command and Original Nature will naturally return.

When nature and fate are complete, there is no scheming, no certainty, no rigidity, no self—thus merging with the primordial *yīqì* (一氣) of Preheaven, this is the union with the True Dao, transcending past and present while ever enduring, participating in Heaven and Earth without division. In motion, it becomes the eternal constancy of the Great Ultimate; in flow, it is unobstructed. In stillness, it is the True One of the Non-Ultimate, secure and unchanging.

If one attains this constancy, then all impermanence falls under command; if unobstructed, then all obstruction will be penetrated.

As the earlier Confucian scholar Zhouzi (周子) said:
*"The Five Phases are but one yin-yang; yin-yang is but the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate originates from the Non-Ultimate."*

The Non-Ultimate is indeed void; the Great Ultimate is indeed existence—the root of transformation, the origin of yin-yang. How could one willingly be bound by yin-yang, confined within the Five Phases, vainly clinging to life while fearing death, debating existence over nonexistence?

One must instead grasp its fundamental root, comprehend its pivotal essence, and transcend the confines of transformation—only then may one be called a true Daoist.

These profound truths, where life and death intersect with colored phenomena, cannot be transmitted by father to son if one does not personally embody and awaken, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, returning to the True Teacher beneath the divine canopy. With pure mindfulness unfettered, silent and scentless, one must verify it oneself—thus self-stabilizing, self-establishing, self-reverting, self-restoring, self-returning, self-fulfilling, self-liberating. Even the deepest filial bonds cannot convey this.

Hence, the seventh patriarch of Longmen, Master Wang Ziyuan of Kunyang, declared after enlightenment:
*"Recognize the True—run all night,
Seek a pillar with neither existence nor nonexistence.
Empty, vast, and solitary in cultivation,
Neither thirst nor hunger—Heaven’s longevity."*

As stated in the annotations of the Twenty-Two Chapters, *"The advantage of using Six"* is *"eternal constancy,"* while *"The advantage of using Nine"* is *"seeing the dragons without a head—auspicious."*

○ **Chapter Sixty-Three (上第六十三章).**

This follows the preceding four chapters, elaborating on the middle-grade precepts, demonstrating that transformation lacks roots while yin-yang has its source, revealing the beginnings of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature. It teaches self-realization, awakening to life and death, and directly attaining the sacred realm of wondrous existence and wondrous nonexistence—thus returning to the origin and source, aligning with the highest-grade elixir cultivation and verification. Only then does one grasp Confucius’ saying: *"To trace the beginning and the end, thus knowing life and death."* This is what he meant.

This true profundity may now be applied with skill.

This is the pivotal eye-opening insight of the entire passage, elucidating the overarching key of refining the Valley Spirit in Chapters Forty-Nine to Fifty-Four, and setting the stage for the subsequent chapters.

※ From *Zhouyi · Xìcí Zhuàn* (《周易·系辞传》): *"Original beginning and end."* The character *jí* (及) is taken from the Han scholar’s annotation: *"He who traces the beginning and attains the end knows the saying of life and death."* The meaning is clear; thus, I follow it.

Retain the mercury within the golden cauldron,
And lead into the jade pool.

Host and guest know no left nor right—
Only recognize the infant.

Mercury refers to the spirit,
Lead refers to the qi.

The golden cauldron denotes within the body
The Upper Valley (*Tiāngǔ*), where in infancy the spirit is stored.

The jade pool denotes within the body
The Middle Valley (*Yìnggǔ*), where in infancy the qi is stored.

The infant refers to the Original Command’s return—
The nascent spirit of the Valley’s first transformation.

This follows Chapter Fifty-Four,
Speaking of the moment when the Original Command returns.

This spirit, having been nurtured in the Middle Valley until fullness,
Riding the qi ascends and circulates the Microcosmic Orbit,
Then returns to its original position in the Mud Ball Palace,
Thus remaining in the Upper Valley—this is the Valley Spirit.

The stone child calls this *division of the embryo*,
The white child calls it *transference of the spirit and exchange of the cauldron*—
Hence, *"retain the mercury in the golden cauldron."*

And the qi likewise returns to its original position,
Entering the Middle Valley’s vermilion chamber—
Hence, *"lead into the jade pool."*

This shift requires no artificial effort;
It moves naturally.

Master Zhang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:
*"When using, divide left and right armies—
Let the other be host, I the guest."*

This chapter clarifies its essence,
Teaching that qi should be host and spirit the guest—
No distinction of left or right,
Thus aligning with the Dao’s authenticity and returning to neither death nor birth.

Only when the spirit is securely hidden within
Does it not seek life through external contrivance—
Hence the qi flows boundlessly,
Temporarily retaining the spirit to avoid death.

Only the infant can guard such pure qi,
Thus: *"Host and guest know no left nor right—
Only recognize the infant."*

At this moment, one attains this nascent spirit,
Just as the infant at birth—
Only guard the pure qi as the infant does,
And the pure yang body will naturally flourish!

○ **Chapter Sixty-Four**

Summarizing the past nine chapters,
All elucidating the subtle essence of exhausting principle and perfecting nature,
Revealing the origin of the Original Command’s return,
And the natural functions at the moment of its return.

The next chapter will speak of the method of gentle nurturing.

The Yellow Nurse’s twin breasts are fair,
The Old Man’s single heart is kind.
No other method in gentle nurturing—
Only from the Void, the child is raised.

The Old Man points to the heart:
At the moment of Original Command’s return,
When all is settled and at rest,
One must not cling to any *having*—
Only nurture the formless spirit,
Mastering purity with unwavering devotion,
Guest to lead and mercury in solemn stillness,
Then the qi flows naturally to nourish the spirit-chamber.

Like a nurse feeding her child,
Let it drink as it will,
Her heart tender and yielding,
Following the qi’s course,
Ever watchful and returning—
Thus the body grows uniformly warm,
And the infant thrives naturally, needing no other art.

The Void is the meaning of *not-having*.
As the *Golden Lotus Sutra* says:
*"If one seeks me through form or sound, it is not so."*
Only the method of *Observation of Self-Nature* suffices—
To forget form, forget qi,
And nurture the spirit that is not-spirit.

○ **Chapter Sixty-Five**

This follows the previous chapter,
Revealing the fire’s timing in gentle nurturing—
Only the secret of forgetting form
Is the way to cultivate the Grain-Spirit.

○ **Chapter Sixty-Six**

Within the vessel, the sky of Heaven never darkens,
And fine, white snow descends in delicate flakes.

The crimson gate—
This refers to the **Zhonggu** (Midgut), the place where the **Ying** (Response) resonates in the **Jiangong** (Crimson Palace).
The soaring **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix)—
This signifies that at this moment, the **qi** emerges fresh from its original position in the **Jiangong**, like the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) taking flight.
As the *Yinfu Jing* (Scripture of the Mysterious Response) states: *"The bird is within the qi,"*
Hence, the **Qingfeng** is likened to the **qi**.
The *Shiming* (Explication of Names) says: *"Qing, means 'to generate.'*
Thus, the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) symbolizes the **qi** in its nascent state.

The **Dantian** (Elixir Field) here refers to the **Upper Dantian**,**—**
That is, the **Tiangu** (Heavenly Grain), the **Nihuan Gong** (Mud Pillow Palace).
The **Yushen** (Jade Hare)—
This denotes the **yang** spirit within the **Gutian** (Grain-Sky), now nurtured and no longer cold as in its initial state, but warm as jade.

The **white snow**—
This signifies the **qi** circulating to the **Gutian** (Grain-Sky), where it mingles with the spirit, forming **shenwater** (spirit-essence).
Its **qi** is clear, pure, and pervasive, like white snow.

At this stage, the **yang** spirit has grown strong and must not be disturbed—
It rests naturally in its **not-spirit** state;
The **qi** flows freely on its own,
Like the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) ascending to the **Nihuan Gong** (Mud Pillow Palace),
Nourishing this spirit.
When the spirit and **qi** unite, they become **shenwater** (spirit-essence),
And it descends like fine, white snow,
Filling the entire body.
One feels uniformly clear and serene,
As though the body were a sky that never darkens.

○ This is **Chapter Sixty-Six**.
This describes the phenomenon of the **qi** flowing freely during the **warming-nurturing** phase—
Such is the true method of **nurturing life**,
How does it compare to the various minor techniques of life-nurturing in *The Chui Xu Yin* (Jade Emptiness Ode)?
With a **clear heart and bright eyes**, one can surely discern the difference.

After the **qinsè** (zither and se) harmonize, the **jīqiú** (winnowing basket and quilt) is set aside.
The **qi** flows freely without need of **fires** (refining techniques),
Yet one must not fear harming the **baby** (nascent spirit).

This is when the **original spirit** (元神) is tempered and nurtured,
Not the same as before when the **grain spirit** (谷神) was refined by **fires** (火候).
For now, the **grain spirit** has already merged with the **life-qi** (命气),
Just as the **qinsè** has harmonized, and the **qi** circulates freely.
When the **yang spirit** (陽神) is fully matured,
It is the time when the **jīqiú** is truly complete—
No longer bound by **emotions** (情) or **desires** (识好恶).

If one still stirs the **heart-fire** (心火) to refine,
Exhausting the spirit and **violating the qi** (暴气),
Then the **qi** will not fully fill the **emptiness** (虚),
And the spirit will struggle to attain its **completeness** (完夫实).
When will this ever be achieved?
The **yang spirit** will be damaged beyond measure—
Thus one must simply let go of body and mind,
Calm the spirit and still the **qi**,
Let it flow freely on its own,
Naturally filling and complete—
Never probing its **fires** (火候).

○ **Chapter Sixty-Seven**.
This speaks of **nurturing life** (温养) without **forcing** (助长).
Before, one exhausted the **nature** (性) to attain the **life-qi** (命),
Now one must nurture the **life-qi** to guide the **nature** (性),
Only then can one return to the **root source** (本源).

When the **eldest son** (長男) enters **Dui** (Joy),
The **young maiden** (少女) returns to **Qian** (Heaven),
The **Xun Palace** (巽宫) aligns with the **earthly position** (土位),
And the **passageways** (关锁) are sealed within the **Great Circulation** (周天).
The **eldest son** refers to **Lu** (Exposure), symbolizing **yang** (陽) in its nascent form.
The **young maiden** refers to **Dui** (Joy), symbolizing **yang** (陽) now mature—
Entering **Dui** and returning to **Qian**,
This is the **original heaven** (先天) **hexagram** (卦) and **line** (爻) imagery:
The first **yang** (一陽) as **Zhen** (Thunder),
Growing to two lines as **Dui** (Joy)—
**Dui** is the **young maiden** (少女)—
Then to three lines as the **pure yang** (纯陽) **Qian** (Heaven) symbol.
The terms **"just entering"** (才入) and **"already returns"** (便归)
Show how swiftly the **yang spirit** (陽神) matures.

The **Xun Palace** (巽宫) is the **nasal orifice** (鼻窍) of the body.
The **earthly position** (土位) refers to the **physical form** (形体)—
**"Aligning"** (并) is the **Gen-Kun Palace** (艮坤宫) as mentioned in **Chapter Forty-Nine**.
For one **yin** (一阴) is **Xun** (Wind), two **yin** become **Gen** (Mountain),
Three **yin** become **Kun** (Earth)—
This is the **earthly position** (土位).
From the time the **nature** (性) determines the **life-qi** (命),
The **yang spirit** (陽神) initially hides like **Zhen** (Thunder)’s single **yang** (陽),
Concealed within the **heavens**, as the **grain spirit** (谷神) and **life-qi** (命气) flow,
The body grows strong like **Dui**’s two **yang** (二陽),
Then swiftly fills as the **pure yang** (纯陽) **Qian** (Heaven) symbol—
The spirit now dwells in its **proper position** (正位) within the body.

While the **qi** too, like the **Xun Palace**’s single **yin** (一阴), initially rests,
Then stills as **Gen**’s **arrest** (止),
And withdraws like **Kun**’s **concealment** (藏),
Filling the body and flowing freely through the **four limbs** (四肢),
Reaching its utmost perfection!

For the spirit grows stronger through **concentration** (凝),
And the **qi** becomes more abundant through **stillness** (寂),
This is the natural order—
There should be no **excess or deficiency** (偏胜).

Yet within the **uterus** (胞胎), a trace of **blood-qi** (血气) remains uneliminated.
If one does not **guard strictly** (戒严), **withdraw deeply** (深藏), and **keep secret** (宥密),
There is still fear of **excessive movement** (好动) and **not abiding in stillness** (不安于静).
In **movement, stillness, sitting, or lying** (行止坐卧),
If one hears the **nasal breath** (鼻息) as having sound,
Or if the **body** (形体) is **exhausted** (驰骤), **labored** (劳顿),
Then the **qi** will **return to agitation** (返动心),
And the spirit will **constantly stray outward** (神常外驰),
Leading to **leaking the **Passageway** and losing the **qi**** (透关漏气).
Future attainment of the **Dao fruit** (道果) will be **unbalanced** (偏) rather than **complete** (圆),
For the **qi** overpowers the spirit.

Thus it is essential to have **true breath** (真息) flowing **leisurely** (悠悠),
The **body** (形体) **relaxed** (申申),
The **appearance and complexion** (容色) **serene** (夭夭),
Following the **Six Qi** (六气) in their **circulation** (周流),
Conforming to the **Great Circulation**’s **rhythm** (运度),
So the **qi mechanisms** (气机) naturally **seal and lock within** (关锁于内),
Without the **flaws of imbalance or dissipation** (偏胜流失),
This is the **true nurturing of the Great Qi** (善养浩然).

○ **Chapter Sixty-Eight**.
This speaks of the **nurturing life** phase when the **qi** is **strong and mature** (壮盛),
Requiring no **artificial effort** (不假作为),
Only **restraint and moderation** (制节谨度) to preserve **fullness without overflow** (满而不溢).

---

The **strings** (弦) after and before,
The **full and waning moons** (月圆月缺).
**Withdrawing** (抽) and **adding** (添) mirror **punishment** (刑) and **virtue** (德),
**Bathing** (沐浴) and **adjusting** (按) follow the **swell and ebb** (盈亏).
**"Strings after and before"** (弦后弦前) illustrate the **qi’s** **ebb and flow** (消息),
**"Full and waning moons"** (月圆月缺) point to the **qi’s** **swell and ebb** (盈亏).
**Harshness** (刚) governs as **punishment** (刑),
**Softness** (柔) yields as **virtue** (德).

At this time when the **spirit is flourishing** (神旺) and the **qi is abundant** (气足),
The **Great Qi** (浩气) flows freely, filling **heaven and earth** (天地).
One must not let it **agitate** (动荡),
Nor **suppress it** (抑制).
Only **withdraw when full** (因盈而抽) and **supplement when depleted** (因虚而添),
Still applying the **method of firmness overcoming softness** (刚克柔克),
So that this **true qi** (正气) **constantly harmonizes and refreshes** (冲和以为沐浴),
Then the **body** (体) will always be **relaxed and expansive** (舒泰广大宽平),
Waiting for the **original heaven’s yang** (先天元阳) to **encounter summer and return to origin** (遘夏还元).

In summary,
The more **abundant the qi** (气体愈旺),
The more the **spirit withdraws** (则神愈退藏).
Do not let the **spirit be enslaved by the qi** (勿使神为气役),
Then the **yang spirit** (陽神) will naturally attain **completeness** (圆足).

○ **Chapter Sixty-Nine**.
This speaks of the **phase of holding fullness** (持盈),
Ensuring the **spirit is clear** (神清) and the **qi is still** (气静),
Avoiding **excess or deficiency** (过不及) in either.

At this juncture, the three grades within the body have completed the **Pure and Chaste Essence** (太素贞白), and upon obtaining this **true lead of great red** (大赤之真铅), their fusion and congealing—intermingling red and white—yield the crimson.

The **marrow of Heaven and Earth** (天地髓) refers to this very **true lead**. When it is said that the **spirit, qi, and essence** are all fully suffused, utterly undefiled, and ready as **old cinnabar**, it is only that the **nurturing work** is yet insufficient. Once a single point of **true lead** arises and turns crimson, it becomes the **golden elixir of Great Return**.

Yet at this time, the **yang spirit** within the body merely abides in stillness and seclusion. One lets the **Heavenly qi** flow freely, until its completeness is fully realized and the **qi stands motionless in stillness**.

As the **White Boy** said:
*"Concentrate the heart, solidify the spirit,
Attain emptiness, guard stillness—
Then the empty chamber births the white."*

Truly natural!

Then one feels the body steadfast as a towering mountain, vast and high.
Suddenly, a point of **true lead** emerges, deep and piercing—
A radiant red heaven, for this is the **marrow of Heaven and Earth**, the very **original nature returning in summer**.

It stirs the earth and shakes the heavens, surging through the **mixed and chaotic**—
My spirit is thus enveloped in drowsiness,
Unknowing, unaware, as if in deep slumber.

After a moment, one awakens to **clear spirit and refreshed qi**,
The body as if aflame, the heart as ice released.

If speaking of further cultivation,
One must yet engage in **fusion and refinement**;
If speaking of its effects,
Then the **light of nature shines universally**, penetrating the profound and subtle.
One hears the **Nine Heavens**, sees **ten thousand miles**,
The entire body pure **yang**—**golden sinews, jade bones**—
This is the **yang spirit manifesting in form**, able to move freely in nature.

As for the **Dao of longevity**, it is here complete!

Yet fearing that **yang has its yin counterpart**,
And that the **six directions of emptiness** still linger,
Unable to avoid the **coming and going of concealment and revelation**—
How could one then **consort with the Creator** and hold dominion over its beginning and end?

Thus, it is impossible not to **bind together** the **primordial chaos** of the past and the **manifested forms** of now,
And **refine them into the golden elixir of Great Return**.

○ **Chapter Seventy**
This speaks of the **yang spirit already formed**,
The moment when the **original spirit first unites**.

※Within this chapter, the word **"seize"** (夺) aligns with the *Yin Symbol Classic*’s **"steal the mechanism"** (盗机).
The *Spring and Autumn Annals* states:
*"The Military Records say: ‘The ancients had the mind to seize from others.’"*
They speak of war’s value in **spiritual swiftness**—
Seizing the **vital points** before the enemy’s intent even stirs.

Here, the study of cultivation lies in **spiritual might**—
Seizing the **pivotal essence of yin and yang** before one’s own mind moves.

The **marrow of Heaven and Earth** is the **pivotal essence of yin and yang**.

At the **mysterious juncture of fire and time**, who from ancient or modern times would dare transmit it?
None have yet known how to **extract the elixir**,
Nor even inquire about the **circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit**.

*"Play"* (玄) is *"Heaven"* (天).
When the **original nature is restored** and the **yang spirit formed**,
There remains no **fire and time** to be applied within the body—
The **fire and time** lie only in the **path to Heaven**.
From antiquity to now, who would clearly transmit it?
Because the world lacks those who can **restore life and nature**,
Nor those with the wisdom to seek—
Thus the **golden elixir of Great Return** remains unplucked,
And the **fire and time of this Microcosmic Orbit** are not yet to be asked.

○ **Chapter Seventy-One**
This follows the meaning of **"seize"** from the previous chapter,
Revealing the first glimpses of **fire and time**.

*Clouds disperse over the sea-pink moon,
Spring deepens with willow winds.*
Who knows this intent?
Gazing upward, questioning the void.

**Note:** At this stage, one has obtained the **original official of the Great Polarity** as one’s body.
The **fire and time** is merely **forgetting the void to merge with the Dao**—
A single move where **spirit and qi are entrusted to mutual oblivion**.

Thus, the opening line speaks of **clouds dispersing** while the **moon reaches the sea-pink**—
As if the **spirit is now utterly pure and luminous**, without sound or stench.
The next line speaks of **spring deepening** as the **wind blows through the willows**—
As if the **qi is now perfectly harmonious and unrestrained**, leaving no trace.

Scholars must apply this to **body and mind**,
Completing its structure—
The first line describes the **unmanifest emotions** as the **central equilibrium**,
The second describes **manifested emotions in perfect measure** as **harmony**.

In terms of its function,
The first line models the **Three Penetrations of Virtue** as my **inherent knowing**—
That which all share.
The second models the **Five Penetrations of the Dao** as my **inherent ability**—
That which all follow.

Yet regarding the **mysteries of the Microcosmic Orbit’s fire and time**,
The principle of **gathering and refining** has not yet been entered.

And why does the text then say, *"eyes question the void"*?
This must be **self-body and self-enlightenment**—
Unifying one to comprehend all,
Only able to attain the **original heart’s sincerity**.

Thus, in **action**, one aligns with the **common nature of humanity**,
In **stillness**, one merges with the **original mandate of Heaven**,
Ever nurturing the **undivided whole**—
Then everywhere one touches, it is **penetratingly clear**,
And one knows the **spirit and qi** have long since **naturally fused within heart and eyes**,
And **vanished into the void**.

Why?
The **movement and stillness of qi** follow the **spirit**,
Yet the **spirit is always prior to qi**.
The **ascension and concealment of the spirit** depend on the **heart**,
Yet the **heart is even prior to the spirit**.
The **first impulse of the heart** lies in the **eyes**—
Thus the **eyes are truly the heart’s first impulse**,
The **primary concern of spirit and qi**.

As the *Yin Symbol Classic* says:
*"The heart is born from things, dies from things—
Its mechanism lies in the eyes."*
Thus it is known that the **eyes are the first impulse of the heart**,
The **true priority of spirit and qi**.

If the **eyes flee**, then the **heart withdraws** and **qi is obstructed**, the **spirit perishes**.
If the **eyes are clear and inwardly gazing**, then the **heart is pure**, the **spirit condenses**, and the **qi expands**.
If the **eyes merge with the void**, then the **heart wanders at the origin of things** without attachment,
And the **spirit and qi** remain **serene and ever still**.

When nurturing reaches **stillness without stillness**,
One knows the **ten directions and three realms** are not outside the **One Heart**,
Past and future are not separate from the **One Self**—
Originally unborn, now unextinguished,
Originally unreduced, now unincreased.

This **suchness**—who knows it?

「Once, I inquired about this meaning from my teacher during his abode in the **Great Void (Tàixū)**.
The teacher was reciting the *Sutra of the Wordless Guan Yin*,
and thus spoke: **"The first sentence is like pointing at the moon to make others see it—
do not mistake the finger for the moon itself.
The second sentence is like the flag of a horned demon—
do not mistake the flag for the wind.**

Indeed, after the **thunder and rain fill the form (xíng)**,
the scene of **radiant light, clear wind, and the moon’s brilliance (guāngfēngjìyuè)** unfolds.
The first sentence, with its **dispersion (sàn)**, is akin to the verse:
*—But if one only sits in the heavens’ expanse, no need to turn back and see the white clouds dip low.*
—**This is the Dao/Way of the spirit, the very essence of life (xìng)**,
yet how can one cling to the metaphor and call it the **spirit** itself?
The second sentence, with its **depth (shēn)**, is akin to the verse:
*—Casually recognizing the face of the east wind, one sees all purple and red blossoms—spring’s very self.*
—**This is the nature of qi, the very essence of life (mìng)**,
yet how can one narrowly call it only the **qi**?

My teacher, the **Dirt Pellet (Níwán) Master**, once left behind a **Dao/Way verse (dàojì)**,
which reads: *"The willows too should dance beneath the bright moon,
the magnolias bloom in the fine wind’s embrace."*
And again: *"The clouds drift freely, each home holds the moon,
the earth blooms with spring, flowers appear everywhere."*
This is precisely the **serene and boundless light of heaven (dàn dàng tiān guāng)**,
an **unlimited mirror of clarity (wúbiān míngjìng)**,
mutually containing and receiving all things,
without fixed boundary or trace.

You must only **steadfastly abide in the close, subtle (mì), concentration, and insight (dìnghuì),
and the equal observation (děngguān)**—
then from sincerity comes clarity,
and clarity knows no obscurity.
Thus, you fulfill the **Dao/Way’s true nature of life (tiān mìng xìng)**,
and **nature and life merge with the Original (yuán)**—
how then could the **Great Void (xūkōng)** be forgotten?

To **observe nature (zìrán)** and **merge with the Dao/Way (hé Dào)**,
is to **unite with the Dao/Way’s true essence (hé Dào zhēn)**,
and **eternally preserve the boundless rest of true emptiness (wúài zhēng)**.»

Thus, bowing deeply, he praised:
*"I dwell within the **Great Void (Tàixū)**,
where **emptiness and clarity (xūmíng)** hold nothing at all.
**Freedom is the Original Nature (zìrán)**,
the **True Self of Heaven (tiān zhēn)**—
cool winds stir the vast moon."*

Such is the **Great Vehicle’s true teaching (Dàchéng zhèngzōng) of the wondrous Dao/Way of emptiness (xūwú miàodào)**.
If not for the **accumulated strength of sincere and steadfast contemplation (jiǒuxīng héngzhī)**,
how could one grasp even half a sentence’s **initial insight (xiān jī)**?
This was **authenticated by my teacher, the Great Void Treasure (Xūkōng Zàng)**—
even if one travels to the ends of the world,
who could truly know this meaning?

※From the *Yì·Tún Cò Guà* (I Ching, Tún Hexagram Commentary):
*"The movement of thunder and rain is full and overflowing."*
The **Han scholar’s annotation (xíng)** originally reads *"swelling (yíng)"*,
but this refers to the **abstract unity of the second, third, and fourth lines of the Tún hexagram**.
All the **Perfect Reality (Quánzhēn)** predecessors interpreted it as *"form (xíng)"*—
I follow this tradition here as well.
○[End of Chapter Seventy-Two]」

This follows the previous chapters, pointing to the **alchemical fire-refinement (tōngxuán)**—
the very **initial insight (xiān jī)** of **unifying the Primordial (héyuán)**.
By **integrating the Three Treasures** with the *Emerald Chamber’s* **Lü Xiucai’s single secret (Dìníhuán Chǔixū Yín Lǚ Xiūcāi yījué)**,
one comes to know the **subtle body and its wondrous application (miàotǐ miàoyòng)**—
its **vast and minute (guǎngdà jīngwēi)** nature,
revealing the **True Realm of the Great Void (Tàixū Zhēnjìng)** in such ineffable splendor.

○[**Human affairs weigh nothing upon one**,
**Heaven’s path offers the steps of the Immortal.**]
Already **mastering cloud-riding**,
**Awaiting the crane’s arrival to ascend the void.**

When the **secret is directly attained (jié)**,
then **all dross is refined into pure gold (jiàngjìn yínchún)**,
**Smoke and fire are extinguished (yānxīo huǒmiè)**—
**embracing all phenomena (bāohán wànxiàng)**,
**without a thread remaining (bùguà yīsī)**.
Human **entanglements dissolve (wùlèi wúguān)**,
**Heaven’s Immortal path is now within reach (xiānjiē yǒufèn)**.

Yet one **does not dare ride the clouds alone**,
but **waits in reverence for the crane’s arrival to pierce the heavens (chōngxiāo)**.

**Teaching others** is not to **boast of concealment or revelation (chūrù yǐnxiǎn)**—
**only thus can one attain the Dao of transformation and ascension (zàobiàn fēishēng zhīdào)!**
○[End of Chapter Seventy-Three]

This continues from the last chapter—
**having clarified the fire-refinement (huǒhòu)**, one now **reaches the realm of elixir completion (dānchéng zhījìng)**.
○[**The heart-field is free of weeds (xīntián wúcǎohuì)**,
**The nature-ground is utterly free of dust (xìngdì juéchénfēi).**]

**Under the moonlit quiet of the night, a single spring bird’s cry.**
Here, the "moonlit quiet of the night" refers to the interplay of **Wuji** (無極) and **Taiji** (太極) in mutual concealment and revelation—
illustrating the moment when **stillness reaches its peak and primal movement begins**, when **True Yang-qi harmonizes with the Original (yuán)**.

The "single spring bird’s cry" signifies the emergence of a single **true seed of transformation** from **Wuji**—
my **preheaven Five Phases essence (yuánxīng)**, the **golden elixir** born from **Heaven’s One (Tiānyī)**,
which the ancient scholar **Zhou Dunyi** called **"Wuji’s True Essence" (wújí zhīzhēn)**,
and **Chen Ti’an** named **"a single cup of Hongmeng wine" (yīzhǎn hóngméng jiǔ)**.

Once ingested, it frees one from **Yin-Yang’s bonds**,
no longer bound by the **Five Phases’ constraints**!

○**[Chapter Seventy-Four]**
This speaks of the **Dao of nurturing the Original Spirit (yuánshén)**.**

---

**White gold simmers through the Six Changes (liùguà),**
**Black tin passes the Orchid Pass (Lán Guān).**
Within the **third watch of the night (bàn yè sān gēng),**
**The golden crow enters the Palace of Broad Cold (Guǎng Hán).**

**White gold**—the **Original Spirit now refined into singular, undivided purity**, like the **golden elixir’s sudden return**.

The **Six Changes (zhèn duì qián xùn gèn kūn)**—
the **Six Qi** in cyclical flow, unceasing, embodying **Taiji’s movement**.
"To simmer" means **reaching supreme emptiness, uncarved**.

**Black tin** is **lead (qiān)**, symbolizing the **Yang-Spirit**, now having **internalized the Original Spirit**,
its body **softened and compliant**, like **lead and tin awaiting ignition**.

The **Three Passes (sānguān)**—
the **mixing and refining of Original Essence, Original Qi, and Original Spirit (yuánjīng yuánqì yuánshén)**,
each transforming and returning to **void**.
This is when the **three leads are all perfected**.

Within the **third watch of the night**—
the moment when **Wuji’s primal seed of transformation stirs**, as in the **"moonlit quiet"** of the last chapter.
The **golden crow**, also bearing the **Three Legs’ meaning (sānjǔ)**, is the **soul of the sun** in heaven—
here, it borrows to signify the **primal seed of transformation**, the **"spring bird"** of the last chapter.
The last chapter spoke of **Hearing-Vehicles**; here, it is **Causally Awakened**.

**Broad Cold** mirrors **Taiji**.

When **nurturing is complete**, the **Original Nature contains the Six Qi in ceaseless circulation**,
**reaching uncarved void**—
the **Original Command has passed the Three Passes**, arriving at **Wuji**, where **no further Dao can be practiced**.
Then, **Wuji’s true seed naturally erupts**—
my **wondrous Original One-Qi (miàowú yuánqì)** returns and **mixes with the Original Spirit**,
becoming the **Great Return of Golden Elixir**.

Thus, **True Original-Qi bursts forth**,
and one becomes a **True Person of the Wondrous Dao**—
**able to endure the world, or withdraw from it**.

Like the **Lion’s hidden tracks**, no lion can trace its path;
like the **Spirit Dragon’s transformations**, no dragon can compare its **mystic agility**.

**How profound and wondrous! How perfect and divine!**

The **Wen Wang** thus bound **Heaven’s** *"Use Nine"* and beheld *"the group dragons without a head"*—a most auspicious sign.
This is called **refining the void and uniting with the Dao**,
where **nature and life merge as one**,
and the **Taiji remains ever whole**.

Yet though one first obtains the **Original Ancestral Essence of Heaven and Earth**,
one must still **unite with the Dao’s true essence** to **forever avoid decline**.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Five (above)**
This speaks of the moment when the **Original Spirit unites with the Dao**.

When the **elixir is ripe**, there are **no longer Dragon and Tiger**—
the **fire terminates in the body of Mercury and Lead**.
Having **shed the mortal coil and attained divine transformation**,
one then becomes a **Pure-Clear Immortal**.

The **elixir** refers to the **True Person’s body**,
the **fire** to the **True Person’s heart**,
and **Pure-Clear** is the **sublime domain of the Most High, Original Beginning, Miao Wu**.

This follows the previous chapter,
speaking of **refining the void and uniting with the Dao**—
yet still **not fully merging with the Dao’s true essence**.
One must **connect with this true body**,
no longer clinging to perceptions of **heart, body, or wisdom**;
and **this true heart**,
no longer divided into **yin-yang, spirit, or qi**.

Only through **exhausting the Dao of utmost sincerity**,
and **devoting unceasing reverence**,
does one **hide the spirit without intent**,
and **need not feign emptiness to contain reality**;
**nurture the heart without constraint**,
nor **boil the hexagrams to still the vital mechanism**;
**secure the body without rigidity**,
nor **pierce the passes to refine the form**;
**respond to things without self**,
nor **cling to thought to attend to affairs**.

The **ten directions and three realms** lie within a single hall;
**past and future** are but **one self**.
**Hinayana and Mahayana disciples**—
like ice melting and snow brightening—
**emerge, vanish, soar, and leap**,
acting spontaneously in accordance with circumstances.

With a **serene and vast heart**, one **broadens the great aspiration**,
and **resting the lead-mercury qi**, one **expands the cosmic balance**.
When **true and false are utterly extinguished**,
and **being and non-being are not distinguished**,
only then has one **truly united with the Dao**—
able to **shed the mortal coil and attain divine comparison**—
**ascending to Pure-Clear**,
**forever becoming a Great Luo Immortal**;
**transmitted through the ages**,
known as a **sage teacher of an era**.

This is the day the **Great Return of Golden Elixir** is complete.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Six (above)**
This speaks of the **elixir’s completion and divine transformation**, merging with the Dao’s true essence.

**The Yellow Springs’ path is sealed shut**,
**the Purple Palace’s gate is burst open**.
How could **Hai Zhan’s son**—
**transformed into a crane**, emerging from the **muddy homunculus**?

The **Purple Palace** is where **Dong Hua Qing Tong Mu Gong** resides,
the **Dao Lord** is the **founder of the Full-Perfection Teaching**.
**Dong Hua’s Purple Palace** is where the **Primordial Foundation is established**,
and the **Minor Yang Emperor** selects immortals.

It is said that **only when the elixir is complete and one has undergone divine transformation—merging with the Dao’s true essence—**
does one **forever seal the Yellow Springs’ path**,
**directly ascending to the Dao Ancestor’s gate** to await selection as an immortal,
**ascending to receive celestial honors**,
or **becoming a sage teacher of an era**.

The earlier text likened the **Cold Hare** to the **completion of the Valley Spirit**,
and the **Jade Hare** to the **vigorous Yang Spirit**.
Now, the **Sea Hare** signifies that the **Original Spirit has obtained the true mechanism of Wuji’s transformation**,
thus **piercing the muddy homunculus like a crane taking flight**—
using the **crane as a metaphor for the True Person**,
speaking of the **cultivator’s transformation from hare to crane**,
not referring to **Liu Gong, the Southern School’s Sea Hare**.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Seven (above)**
This speaks of **shedding the mortal coil and divine transformation**,
**ascending to pay homage to the Dao Ancestor**—
the **final attainment of fruit and true essence**.

Where shall the rivers and seas return?
To whom do mountains and cliffs belong?

Once the **Golden Elixir** ripens,
It is the supreme treasure within one’s halls.

The **Dao of the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid** has been expounded in full threefold,
Yet still I fear the world may read it and know yet not cherish it,
Cherish it yet not delight in it.
Its root cause lies in clinging to mundane affections,
Failing to awaken a single true thought to cultivate and establish one’s foundation.

Thus, I further reveal this chapter:
When the Golden Elixir ripens,
It merges with the **Great Void** as one body.
All worldly rivers, seas, mountains, and cliffs are cast aside—
They are but household treasures.
Speaking of mountains and rivers,
I encompass all that is finer than them.
Teach people to cast aside all worldly ties,
Hold fast to a single thought,
And naturally, the path of **True Cultivation** will open,
The Dao will have no obstacles,
Success will be inevitable—
Even enlightenment for others will follow.
Otherwise, when the **Impermanence** arrives,
*"All else will vanish, only karma remains to be transformed."*
Then, even regret will be too late!

---
**Chapter Seventy-Eighth**
This is written to awaken the true thought within people,
Thus stating that once the Elixir ripens,
It becomes one with Heaven—
Mountains, rivers, and the earth are all household treasures.
As the ancients said:
*"The vast eight extremes are all within my gates."*
Was this not true?

---
**Lü Chengzhong’s Oral Instructions, Ge Laoshi’s Transmission to Zheng Xin.**
No idle words—only **mercury and lead**.
Lü refers to **Dao Ancestor Pure Yang Emperor**, the **Pure Yang Emperor Lü**,
While **Zhong** refers to **Zhongli the Elder**, the **True Yang Emperor**.
Ge refers to **Lao Ge the Immortal**, surnamed **Xiaoxian**, the **Taiji Left Elder**.
Zheng refers to **Zheng Zhenren, Master of Thoughtful Retreat**.
From ancient times, countless **High Immortals** attained the Dao through cultivation—
Like Lü and Ge, whom all know and revere.
Yet their transmitted oral instructions contain no extraneous words—
Only **mercury and lead**,
Teaching people not to seek the Dao through external beliefs or external means.

---
**Chapter Seventy-Ninth**
This speaks of the **Original Elixir Method**,
The **easy and simple Dao** of ancient sages,
Not like other obscure arts whose methods are complex and difficult.

---
**Mercury and lead return to one crucible,
Sun and moon must share the same furnace.**
When refining fire, beware of anger and desire,
Teach you to **congeal the Jade Acid Butter**.

This reveals the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**:
Mercury and lead must merge as one,
Their natures must harmonize.
In the stages of **cooking, bathing, and refining fire**,
The essence lies in avoiding wrath and lust,
Adjusting the heat with precision—
Day and night, maintain utmost secrecy,
Then **self and object merge**, the six senses grow still,
The mind becomes clear—
Naturally, the Elixir congeals.
The term **"Jade Acid Butter"** speaks of
Nurturing the **Spirit** and **qi** so thoroughly
That within **warmth, refinement, and harmony**,
It achieves the subtlest fusion.
From beginning to end, the **Three Great Intersections** are all thus nurtured,
Requiring no effort—
Its completion is swift.

---
**Chapter Eightieth**
This elucidates the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**.

---
**Gathering herbs and forming connections,
Refining fire and bathing in elixir.**
When the time of **shedding the mortal coil** arrives,
The **nine times nine of pure Yang** will be complete.

This chapter summarizes the entire text,
Clarifying the **ordered stages of Elixir Cultivation**,
Teaching people to progress step by step—
When the **pure Yang** is complete,
Naturally, the **transformation of Spirit and form** occurs,
And one ascends to become an Immortal.
Readers must not squander this **sincere guidance** to return to the Origin!

---
**Chapter Eighty-First**
This marks the sequence of the Elixir instructions,
Concluding the meaning of all eighty chapters.

**Note:** This entire section on techniques begins with **deliberate action**
And ends with **effortless spontaneity**.
The **deliberate action** is to **rectify the body, stabilize the vital breath,**
And **nurture the boundless and sincere**.
The **effortless spontaneity** is to **strengthen oneself unceasingly,**
And **nurture the formless**.

My teacher once said to people:
*"If one straightens their body, empties their mind,
And makes their thought **True One**,
Then practicing the Elixir instructions will naturally be easy.
Even without cultivation, it suffices to **ward off illness and prolong life**,
And to remain strong in old age."*

This is indeed the **fundamental and supreme method** for beginners.

For if one straightens their body,
Their posture will have no crookedness or leaning,
And their **five senses, four limbs, and hundred bones**
Will all be orderly—
External things will find no way to disturb them.
If one empties their mind,
The **flow of qi** will be unobstructed,
And their **entire body’s meridians, tendons, and bones**
Will have no stagnation—
Thus, the **qi returns to the Void**.
If one makes their thought **True One**,
They will act with sincerity,
With no hesitation in their heart—
Then, the **yin essence** within will naturally congeal with the **true qi**,
Forming the **Spirit**, which then returns to its origin.

Thus, **body, mind, and intention** are always united,
And the **Valley Spirit** is nourished in **unconscious awareness**—
Strength and vitality naturally follow.

Therefore, the **Method of Returning to the Origin**
Must first uphold a **true thought**.
If the **true thought** is sincere,
Then the body will naturally straighten,
And the mind will naturally empty.
Once the mind is empty,
The **medicine arises**, and the **fire will be true**—
There will be no fear of **metal and wood obstruction**,
Nor of **water and fire failing to aid each other**.
Only when **Spirit and qi** merge in subtlety
Does the **Elixir congeal**.
Within this lies the **root**—
Then nurture the **formless**,
Gradually leading to **no form, no body**,
And the **Great Return of Golden Fluid** will be achieved!

**Gold** is the **Heavenly One’s** self-generated metal,
**Fluid** is the **Heavenly One’s** pre-natal water essence.
The **Great Return** is when these **Five Agents’** refined essences merge and congeal,
Restoring the **Taiji** to the **Wuji** of **Prenatal Heaven**.
Once the **entire fluid congeals**,
Add the **functions of bathing and nurturing**,
Day by day, month by month,
From subtle to manifest,
To achieve **enduring and vast virtue**—
How could the body not become an **indestructible Golden Body**?

The **Source** is as such,
And **Returning to the Source** is as such.
From these words, one may suddenly awaken to the **Dao of Congealing Essence into Spirit**.

The **Method of Settling the Furnace** is to observe the initial three to four slender months of the moon’s cycle—
when the intention of **nurturing and resting** is most harmonious and wondrous beyond words,
hence the saying: *"Refining the elixir requires seeking the reclining crescent furnace"* (the furnace base is pressed firmly against the lower palate, with the body tilted upward on all fours).

The furnace base must be **expansive and void**, resting gently upon the **Lianquan** spring,
while the furnace edges hover near the **lower teeth and Huiyan** junction** (the throat’s opening),
descending like a pendulum, its force clinging close to the **rear of the throat**,
as though an infant were suckling—
then the **qi** and breath will easily descend.

If the furnace base is **fully hollowed**,
the **Heavenly One’s** **Spring-Summer-Growth-Autumn-Storage-Winter-Hiding** cyclical **qi**
will enter through the **Xuanpin** (the nostrils),
flooding the **Dantian** and traversing the **Governing** and **Conception Vessels**,
not merely manifesting in men as the **testicles’ contraction** as proof,
nor in women as the **breasts’ contraction** (the method of **massaging the breasts** is utterly mistaken)—
but also, the **qi** will naturally reach the soles,
and one will feel the **Yongquan** at the foot’s heart as if ants were crawling.
When this luminous scene appears,
one may say the furnace is **settled** and the elixir is **ripe**.

Once this body leaves the mother’s womb,
it gradually forgets the **original path** of its **roots**,
and after one year, the **Governing** and **Conception Vessels’** **pathways** become **blocked** for a year.
If further exposed to **wind, cold, heat, or dampness** of the **evil pathogens**,
the **viscera and bowels** will close and **death** ensue.

Thus, the *Suwen·Tianzhen Lun* begins with:
*"Those who know the **Dao** have their **qi** and **vessels** always **unobstructed**."*
and continues to:
*"The **Sages** transmit the **Heavenly One’s qi** to **penetrate Spirit and Mind**."*
Yet its words are **brief** and lack detail.

Still, even **Huangdi and Qibo** (the Yellow Emperor and his minister) held this method in such high regard,
and now, for mortals to **clear and unblock the Governing and Conception Vessels’ pathways**—
how could this be easy?

It must be done at the **child and noon hours**, seated facing south,
striving to **close the breath** as though it were **not exhaled**.
With all one’s might, direct the **qi** downward and **hold the breath**,
repeating this **once, twice, or thrice**,
up to ten, twenty, or thirty times—
there will surely come a day when the **pathways are cleared**.

It is best practiced in **winter months**,
when the **Heavenly One’s qi** is **concealed** and **yang** is **hidden**—
then the **qi** will be **conserved** without harm.

If done **gradually and leisurely**,
one must wait a full year before the **pathways** will open!

**The Return to Source Chapter**

The Sage Tai Su sought the **Dao** of the True Essence,
and wandered through all sacred realms.
He received the **orthodox method** in transmission,
and vowed to take **saving the world** as his heart’s purpose;
yet he singled out **preserving the Three** above all,
and placed **nourishing life** as his highest priority.
For he said: *"Learning the art of immortality is easy, yet mortals struggle;
escaping the dust is not hard, yet mortals find it difficult—
how lamentable this is!"*

The ancients spoke:
*"Clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,
winds of karma scatter the ocean of tranquility."*

In years past,
by chance, he encountered his **preceptor**, the **Venerable Sage of Purple Yang**, Master Zhang.
His words of **ease** were but half a sentence;
his **verification and efficacy** were but fleeting moments.
Yet knowing that immortality could be **learned**,
he privately rejoiced in his discovery.
When the **golden elixir** was **refined** and the **sage’s embryo** formed,
Tai Su composed *The Return to Source Chapter* in **eighty-one sections** (to correspond with the **pure yang of yin and yang’s cycles**),
each in **four lines of five characters**,
to instruct those who came late to the **Dao**.

*"Awaken early to the **True Essence**,
do not wait until old age when **lead and mercury** are depleted!*
*Act swiftly and resolutely—
**seek the teacher** and **pursue the Way**.*
*Refine the **golden vessel** together,
and **ascend to immortality** as one.*
*When the **elixir** transforms and **ascends**,
this is what I truly desire.*

*The **lead** and **mercury** form the **True Body**,
**yin** and **yang** unite to create the **Great Primordial**.*
*Once the **Twenty-Eight Movements** are known,
the **golden elixir** can be **refined**.*

*Mercury is the **essence of the Azure Dragon**,
**lead** is the **fat of the White Tiger**.*
*Gather them within the **cauldron**,
and **harvest** them at the **right moment**.*
*How wondrous!—
the **Female of Separation** rides the **White Tiger**,
the **Golden Sage** straddles the **Mercury Dragon**.*
*When **Geng** and **Jia** align in **harmony**,
a single **refinement** yields **red**.*

*With **snake’s essence** and **dragon’s marrow**,
and **tortoise’s soul** tempering the **Tiger’s essence**,
within the **Divine Pool’s waters**,
two **celestial mushrooms** emerge.*
*The **White Snow** ascends to the **Jade Terrace**,
the **yellow sprout** blossoms in the **Jade Garden**.*
*If you know the **False Moon**,
where then do you **refine the red lead**?*

*The **medicinal materials** are **united in the Primordial Void**,
the **fire’s intensity** is **cultivated in the Great Darkness**.*
*In the **tenth month**, the **embryo of immortality** forms,
only then is the **Ninefold Transformation** known.*
*Where the **Dragon King hides his pearl**,
the **rooster clutches the **Dao** at **cock’s crow**.*
*Who knows that **lead and mercury** unite?
Just then, the **elixir of the **Great Primordial** can be consumed.*

*Bathing in **spittle** nourishes the **Eternal Feminine**,
**breathing** relies on the **wings of the **Dao**’s wind**.*
*The **babe** has not yet spoken a word,
alone in the **Great Mystery’s chamber**.*
*He seeks the **Female of Separation** in **Purple Palace**,
and pairs the **Male of the **Dao**’s **Jade Terrace** with the **Female of the **Kan**’s **Abyss**.*
*The **Yellow Matron** arranges the **marriage**,
and the **Great Primordial** naturally **encloses the Three**.*

*The **Celestial Horse of **Kan** gallops through the **Golden Door**,
the **Earthly Ox of **Li** enters the **Wood Palace**.*
*Who would wed the **Snake’s Daughter**,
to the **Golden Sage**?*

*The **Bride** is **Twenty-Eight**,
the **Groom** is the **Dragon’s Three**.*
*The **nuptial chamber** emits **auspicious qi**,
and their union brings forth the **Firstborn Male**.*

*Last night, upon the **Western State’s banks**,
the **pond’s light** illuminated the **emerald waves**—
**returning**, they enter the **Royal Domain**,
within the **cauldron**, self-**refinement** begins.*

*The **Female of Separation** and the **Male of the **Kan**’s **Abyss** are not **wedded sisters**,
yet the **Great Primordial** naturally **transforms and gives birth**.*
*If mortals grasp this principle,
a single point will **fall into the Yellow Court**.*

*The **Elixir Valley** grows the **Divine Tree**,
the **Yellow Court** holds the **Great Treasury**.*
*No longer craving hunger or thirst,
one **ascends directly** to the **Immortal Realm**.*

*The **Mind-Horse** returns to the **Divine Chamber**,
the **Heart-Monkey** guards the **nuptial chamber**.*
*The **spirit, soul, and intent**,
transformed into **purple-golden frost**.*

*One **orifice** is the **Mysterious Female**,
within which **qi** and **spirit** are **hidden**.*
*Who knows this **orifice**?
Then do not **seek the Way** beyond.*

*The **spleen and stomach** are not the **Divine Chamber**,
the **flanks** are but **excess of the kidneys**.*
*I urge you not to cling to **dogma**,
for this is not the **Elixir’s pivot**.*

*Within the **inner landscape**, a thousand verses arise,
yet a single **goblet of **Yellow Court** wine** suffices.*
*When **emptiness** is **encountered** without obstruction,
**heaven and earth** lie within the **self**.*

*The **bird and hare** **roast each other**,
the **tortoise and snake** **wrap around one another**.*
*Transformed into a **single grain of elixir**,
**nurtured**, it becomes the **embryo of immortality**.*

*All things undergo **birth and death**,
yet the **Primordial Spirit** dies and **rebirths**.*
*By **returning the spirit to the **qi** within**,
the **Way of the Elixir** naturally **manifests**."*

「The **Dao** lies where **qi** and **spirit** return to their roots,
when **body** and **mind** restore their **command**.*

This **true orifice** is known to few,
though it holds the **mystery supreme**.

Within the **self** exists the **Primordial Male**,
the **heart** untainted by **filth and dust**.*
Yet none discern its **recognition**—
all **truth** is contained in this **orifice**.

The **True Dragon and Tiger** transcend **Kàn**’s* limits,
**Heaven and Earth** align in **Mǎ Niú**’s* rectitude.*
All possess such **completeness**—
yet why do few know to **cultivate**?

The **hun** and **pò** govern the **heart**,
**shén** and **qì** are bound by **intent**.*
The **firing process** proceeds with **equanimity**,
**refining** the **initial essence** in **silent operation**.

Below the **heart**, above the **kidneys**,
west of the **liver**, east of the **lungs**’*
—neither **intestines** nor **stomach**—
**one breath** flows freely through.

Its **marvelous use** is not a matter of **will**,
its **true mechanism** not bound by **time**.*
Who knows this **orifice**?
Do not let it **linger in inaction**.

There is **substance** yet not-**substance**,
**inaction** harmonizes with **action**.*
**Alchemical authority** rests within the **hands**,
**Black Hare** and **White Rabbit** fuse into **golden essence**.*

The **Tiger roars** on the **Western Peak**,
the **Dragon hums** in the **Frozen Northern Sea**.*
To **seize them** requires **wild combat**,
to **deposit them** is in the **Virtuous Official’s** domain.*

They **adorn** the **minister of brightness and darkness**,
**layering clouds** to pierce **morning’s** and **evening’s** veil.*
The **cauldron** condenses **pure white snow**,
nowhere to **find** the **monkey of the heart**.

**Black Mercury** yields **Yellow Leaves**,
**Red Lead** blooms **Purple Flowers**.*
Still, the **firing process** must be **conducted**,
within the **cauldron**, **cinnabar elixir** forms.

**Wood’s essence** must guard against **Rabbit**,
**Metal’s essence** forbids **Rooster**.*
**Drawing and dripping** must be **bathed in mist**,
precisely when the **moon is full**.

All **depends** on the **first breath of wind**,
a thousand **peaks** beneath the **half-moon’s** glow.*
The **urgent decree** must be **executed**,
then the **circulation of the cosmos** begins.

**Medicinal substances** differ in **maturity**,
**firing stages** require **drawing and dripping**.*
With one **grain of elixir** glowing,
**cold bees** sting the **jade curtain**.

The **pearl** was once **split from the oyster’s** belly,
the **egg** was **gathered** from the **Rooster’s** nest.*
**Substance arises from non-substance**,
**spirit and qi** **mutually invade**.

**Spirit and qi** are not **male and female**,
**body and mind** are not **husband and wife**.*
Yet when **heavenly mechanics** are **properly aligned**,
who knows where the **elixir forms**?

The **Dragon and Tiger** first **congeal**,
when the **substances** have **solidified**—
their **clash** is **ignited**,
yet **East Lord** remains **unaware**.

**False paths** and **minor methods**,
**erroneous roots** and **idle chatter**,
the **precept of the Mercury’s Return***
—no **other gate** exists.

**Nobility and humility**,
**husbands and wives**, **brothers and sisters**—
if **Daoist cultivation** has **distinction**,
all may **consult the Elixir Scriptures**.

**Outer garments** are easily **refined**,
**medicinal herbs** **wither** without **difficulty**.*
But know the **method of return and restoration**,
and **golden treasures** will **accumulate like mountains**.

The **hun** and **pò** manifest **three natures**,
**shén** and **qì** **harmonize the Five Phases**.*
Within this, **four symbols** are **divided**,
**clustered** to form the **embryonic essence**.*

**Focus the will** to seek **Lead and Mercury**,
**dispel the mind** to find **Earth’s Metal**.*
Only then does one grasp the **orifice’s mystery**—
who can **fathom** its **depth**?

**Creation** has no **foundation or base**,
yet **yin** and **yang** spring from **Wood’s origin**.*
These **true marvels**,
even **father and son** cannot **fully transmit**.

**Retain Mercury** in the **Golden Cauldron**,
**introduce Lead** into the **Jade Pool**.*
**Host and guest** have no **left or right**—
only **recognize the infant**.

**Yellow Mother’s** twin **breasts** are **beautiful**,
**Non-Aging Child’s** **heart** is **compassionate**.*
To **nurture** requires no **other technique**—
**non-substance** **nourishes the infant**.

**Refining the gate**, the **Azure Phoenix** takes flight,
**Elixir Field** **rears the Jade Embryo**.*
The **cauldron’s heavens** never **darken**,
**white snow** falls in **delicate threads**.

After the **qin** and **se**** harmonize**,
**Jī Xiàng**** is **settled**—
no need to **conduct the firing process**,
yet fear **damaging the infant**.

When the **eldest son** enters **Dùi**,
the **youngest daughter** returns to **Heaven**,
**Yì Guān**** and **Tǔ Position** **lock together**,
**circulating** through the **cosmic cycles**.

**Before and after the string**,
when the **moon waxes and wanes**,
**drawing and dripping** mirror **punishment and virtue**,
**mist-bathing** follows **fullness and emptiness**.

**Mature Mercury**, three **catty** of **white**,
**true Lead**, one **point** of **red**,
**plucking Heaven and Earth’s marrow**,
**intercourse with the Maiden** at the **critical moment**.

The **firing process** **penetrates the mystery**,
yet **ancient and modern** few **transmit**—
**unfamiliar substances**,
do not **inquire** about the **cosmic cycles**.

The **wind scatters** the **clouds**,
the **sea’s camellia** blooms in **moonlight**,
the **spring deepens** with **willow’s wind**—
who **understands** this **intent**?
**Gazing upward**, **question the void**.

Between **mortals**, there is no **burden**,
above, the **Path of Immortals** awaits.*
**Having solved** the **Cloud-Riding**,
**accompany the White Crane**.*

The **heart-field** bears no **weeds**,
the **nature-ground** **excludes dust**.*
In the **stillness of night**, **moonlight bright**,
**one cry** of the **spring bird**.

**White Gold** is **boiled in six seals**,
**Black Tin** **crosses three passes**,
by the **third watch**, **Golden Rooster** enters **Broad Cold**.*

When the **vessel is ripe**, there are no **Dragon and Tiger**,
when the **fire is complete**, **Lead and Mercury** are **no more**.*
**Embryo’s escape** marks **spirit-transformation**,
then **ascend** as the **Pure-Clear Immortal**.

**Bar the Yellow Spring’s road**,
**burst open the Purple Treasury’s gate**—
how **Sea-Sand Child**,
**transforms into Crane**, emerging from the **mud-embryo**.

**Where do rivers and seas return**?
**Which mountain and cliff belongs to whom**?
After the **Golden Elixir** **matures**,
it is **always a treasure** of the **chamber**.

**Lǚ Chéng’s** **precept of the Bell-Mouth**,
**Gě Zhōu’s** **transmission of the Heart-Mind**—
no **idle words** remain,
all **gather** only **Lead and Mercury**.

**Lead and Mercury** return to **one cauldron**,
**sun and moon** must **share the furnace**.*
**Advancing fire** must **avoid taboos**,
I **instruct you** to **form Jade Cream**.

**Collecting herbs** must **reunite and congeal**,
**firing** with **mist-bathing**—
until the **embryo’s escape**,
**ninety-nine days** of **yang** **sufficiency**.*

Those who **refine the Golden Elixir**,
must know **winter solstice** is not **at Child**,
**mist-bathing** is not **at Mào Wǔ**.*

**Lead and Mercury** are not **saliva, nasal mucus, or seminal fluid**,
nor **vital breath** or **blood**.

**Seven returns** mean **returning to origin**,
**nine restorations** mean **restoring to source**.*
**Metal’s essence** and **Wood’s essence**,
**meet Earth** and **intermingle**.

**Dragon, Tiger, Horse, Ox**—
all are **formless**.

The **Master’s** *《Awakening to Truth》*,
says the **essence of the Golden Elixir** lies
in the **Spirit-Water Jade Pool**—
that is **Lead and Mercury**.

If one knows **where Lead emerges**,
then one knows **where Mercury is produced**.
Having known **Lead and Mercury**,
one knows the **Spirit-Water Jade Pool**.
Having known the **Spirit-Water Jade Pool**,
one can **refine the Golden Elixir**.

The **Golden Elixir’s merit**,
**achieved in an instant**,
cannot be **measured by nine years or three years**’ **timeline**,
nor **confined to years, months, days, and hours** in **operation**.

**Zhōng Lí’s*** **saying**:
*"The **Four Great Elements** compose **one body**,
all belong to **yin**.*

Thus, one cannot **seek within the body**,
but must **find the single point of yang essence** within it.

Yet this **yang essence**,
dwells in **one orifice**—
**common folk** cannot **guess its location**.

Only this **orifice**,
is the **Primordial Female’s gate**,
the **Spirit-Water Jade Pool** itself.»

Knowing this, one may then **harvest and gather** it,
proceed to **intercourse and fusion**,
then **cook and refine**,
until **bathing in the elixir**,
and **dividing the embryo**—
further requiring **nurturing to perfect the elixir**.

How could one not **discern the river’s source**,
know the **weight in catkins**,
and **grasp the timing**?

Since **Tai Zi** obtained the Master’s **precepts**,
he knew this **body cannot die**.
He knew the **elixir must succeed**.

Now that the **great work** has begun,
this is proclaimed to all **future aspirants of Dao**.
**Stone Tai of the Peach Grove** records this once more.
