**The Divine Mechanism Revealed: Direct Pointers to the Great Return of Golden Elixir**

The medicines of the supreme Dao and the substances of the consummate Way are fundamentally the Three Powers. Yet the wondrous principles of generation and completion lie beyond the Two and Five. For all practitioners, entry begins with the fullness of spirit and sufficiency of qi. When spirit is full and qi is sufficient, true essence is born; when true essence arises, qi and spirit are preserved. For when essence is exhausted, spirit flees; when spirit perishes, qi scatters. Qi is born of the heart, while essence issues from the body. Grasping this wondrous principle, the sacred work of return and reversal is nothing more than the fusion of body and mind. Thus, the generation and completion of the supreme Dao lie in this alone.

Master Mud-Pillow said: Qi belongs to Heaven, essence to Earth, and spirit to Man. Since man is formed by receiving the essence of the Two and Five, man is Heaven and Earth, and Heaven and Earth are man. Therefore, to perfect the Dao of Heaven and Earth, to model Heaven and emulate Earth, is nothing beyond the self. What is the method? The heart is as clear as Heaven, the body as tranquil as Earth. Achieving clarity and tranquility, one becomes Heaven and Earth! From this, the Great Return proceeds. The work of cultivation is simply to attain spontaneity. The secret of reaching the ultimate lies in nothing more than utmost sincerity without ceasing. Those who attain ceaselessness do so by inheriting the essence of the Two and Five. Thus, Master Mud-Pillow said: Only through utmost sincerity without ceasing can one achieve the Great Return of Golden Elixir. Yet this is neither from within nor without; the ancient sages called it "from emptiness and nothingness." For the Dao is fundamentally the most empty, and its substance is the most non-existent. Thus, the Great Return of Golden Elixir is the return to the substance of the Dao. To cultivate in accordance with the substance of the Dao is what the Most High meant by "recognizing the One, and all things are complete."

Min Xiaogen said: Carefully examining this text, its title and chapter headings indeed derive from the oral transmission of a divine person. Yet the composition of its content is clearly not the original oral version. Later hands must have interspersed additions. Thus, jade and stone are mixed together. Without emendation, the harm to later generations would be no small matter. Therefore, I have compiled the *Profound Discourse of the Sincere Studio of Supreme Emptiness*, based on the oral transmission of the divine person, and presented it here. Alas, it has not yet been verified by the ancient sages, so I record it awaiting confirmation by the wise.

**Foundation-Laying Relies Entirely on the Bellows**

For all people, spirit is born of essence, and essence is born of qi. When the five qi merge and fill the body, they manifest as the constructive and protective energies, nourishing yin and yang and transforming into essence and marrow. However, if the body flows, essence leaks. If one does not know how to preserve the substance of the Dao, essence flows and marrow follows, gradually depleting. All people in this world begin practice only after damage has occurred, so when they begin, they must first establish a foundation. To establish this foundation, one must start with regulating the mind. When the mind is regulated and qi harmonized, one may hope to attain true breathing.

True breathing is what *Nanhua* calls "heel breathing," and what Master Mud-Pillow refers to as the origin of embryonic breathing. Yet relying on intention to guide it does not achieve spontaneity. Once embryonic breathing is accomplished, one directly unites in virtue with Heaven and Earth, with no room for the mind in between. Exhaling follows exhalation, inhaling follows inhalation, like a bellows. Inhaling and exhaling in ceaseless circulation—this is true breathing. Once true breathing is regulated, intention manifests immediately, opening and closing naturally, without relying on mental effort. One need only follow the method to open and connect.

The upper and lower magpie bridges are gently propped open with the diaphragm. The qi in the heart is lowered to the lower abdomen and stored in the extreme of the Kun Palace, called "emptying the heart and filling the abdomen." Both hands cup the penis and scrotum, lifting and warming them—raising them is even better—so that one’s yang qi is emitted. Then the yang qi of Heaven and Earth responds, drawn into one’s body. One must not fixate on it or stir desire, for if the fire of desire flares, original yang becomes chaotic, and instead of absorbing the yang qi of Heaven and Earth, one’s own yang qi will be consumed by them. Therefore, one need only keep the heart and breathing interdependent.

Master Mud-Pillow said: At this stage of practice, one must use intention to nurture and preserve, allowing descent and forbidding ascent. When the fire in the Cinnabar Field blazes and the two kidneys boil like a decoction, after about nine breaths, use intention to guide it. Penetrating the spine from behind, one will experience the verification of the Five Dragons Bearing the Sage. There may be sensations of the spine breaking, the pass burning, and the wall scattering into the brain—one must not be alarmed. Suddenly, the grotto palace may open, revealing what has never been heard or seen. One must guard against attachment. Abiding in stillness for a long time, one will feel sweet dew pouring down, so abundant it cannot all be swallowed. Descending from the Tower Chamber to the Descending Gate, a cool delight pervades the heart, bringing indescribable peace. After a while, it sinks down, transforming like boiling water, and one feels harmony surging throughout the body. After achieving this, the human Dao is complete, and one may proceed to the immortal Dao without the flaw of skipping stages.

What is the immortal Dao? When yang arises, use the Heavenly Eye to illuminate the Yin Heel vessel. Simply follow the opening and closing of true breathing, gently inhaling to activate the Yin Heel, rising and falling with the breath. Practicing as if nothing exists, one will feel a numinous aperture open before the coccyx. Within it, a rustling sensation arises, like a magnet attracting a needle. The true qi of Heaven and Earth enters the Yin Heel, ascending along the spine before the heart and behind the back, straight to the Mud-Pillow. One must retain it for about three to five breaths, then allow it to descend to the Flower Pool, passing through the Tower Chamber and Descending Gate to the lower Cinnabar Field. Both places require retention for about three to five breaths. Then, at the Yin Heel, absorb the qi that entered with the previous breath, and retain it for nine breaths before allowing it to ascend. Thereafter, practice follows spontaneity, for one has already embedded ascent and descent within opening and closing.

Master Mud-Pillow said: Practicing thus without counting repetitions, one proceeds until circulation is endless. When the two qi balance, the entire body feels harmonious and comfortable. Initially, one may experience limbs as heavy as mountains and the body like a wooden stump. This is because the latent yin qi in the body, encountering this yang qi’s attack, seeks to depart, hence the sensations of heaviness and dullness.

When the yin dissipates in an instant, an indescribable clarity and joy arise. Thereafter, with each practice, the fire suffices and the body feels light, while the spirit delights in ever more beautiful and wondrous scenes, advancing day by day. The primordial yang gradually flourishes, and the primordial qi surges in harmony, transforming the yin impurities within the body into the essence of primal harmony, and transmuting the mundane flames within the heart into the qi of the True One. The marrow solidifies and the essence congeals, forever free from the afflictions of leakage or reckless dissipation. The foundation is firmly established, and the outer gate of the alchemical household is complete. This is called "the body unmoving."

Yet the meaning of "the body unmoving" extends beyond the firmness of essence: even tears, sweat, and the seven bodily fluids vanish entirely, and one remains unmoved even when encountering desires. Moreover, as the classics say, "When essence is sufficient, one does not think of lust"—all these refer to the body unmoving.

Min Xiaogen said: In the alchemical regulation of qi, there are originally three paths: the red, the black, and the yellow. The red is the Conception Vessel, the path in front, the route through which the heart’s qi flows. The heart is red in color, hence it is called the red path. Yet the nature of red is to blaze upward, so the method must restrain it and cause it to descend, thereby cooling the heart and warming the kidneys. The black is the Governor Vessel, the path behind, the route through which the kidneys’ qi flows. The kidneys are black in color, hence it is called the black path. Yet the nature of black is to moisten and descend, so the method must restrain it and cause it to ascend, thereby circulating the marrow and calming the spirit. These two paths are the routes through which essence and qi emerge, enabling the existence of all beings. Thus, the method designates them as the "human path," which both alchemists and physicians describe in detail.

The yellow is the Yellow Center, the path lying between the red and black, situated before the spine and behind the heart. Its virtue governs the two qi, serving as the master of opening and closing. Its realm is utterly empty and still, so only the primordial can traverse and abide there. The formation and perfection of the immortal embryo for both ordinary beings and immortals occur within this realm. Though there are distinctions among the three fields, in truth they are one continuum. Thus, the method designates this as the "immortal path." Yet because it was treasured and kept secret by the ancient sages, alchemical texts fill the shelves, yet few dare to expound it fully. From the Zhou and Qin dynasties through the Ming, the teachings were transmitted orally, and the transmission required a midnight oath.

My late teacher, Master Taixu, said: The first to commit the teachings to writing was Yin the Disheveled, my teacher, the Mud-Pillow Immortal. Yet even he merely hinted at the beginnings, for if the nature of the heart-mind is not understood, later generations, being of ordinary constitution, will be prone to curiosity and impatience. Moreover, the world abounds with heterodox teachings, all relying on sensory knowledge for instruction—this is diametrically opposed to the essence of the Dao, let alone other matters.

Now, upon solemnly reading this text, it omits the red and black and directly describes the Yellow Center. The celestial mechanism remains unexposed, so how dare I conceal it? Failing to supplement it would betray the Immortal. Thus, I have composed this supplementary chapter; may readers forgive me.

**Refining the Self Requires True Lead and Golden Water to Forge the Sword and Gather the Primordial**

The "self" is earth; earth is intention—specifically, the perfectly sincere and unerring true intention. The heart pertains to fire, and delusive thoughts and desires all belong to the postnatal. Blazing and racing, they are difficult to extinguish. Only with a speck of true gold from the primordial water—the primordial yang’s true essence—can the mundane flames be extinguished and transformed into true intention. This is what alchemists call the Yellow Center within the Yellow Court, also known as the golden tripod or the spirit chamber, for it can be bounded yet boundless, formless yet embodied.

According to the earlier foundation-building, the self was already refined, and there was a wondrous mutual dependence. Previously, mercury was cast into lead to refine lead and produce gold, which in the human body corresponds to refining the form and nourishing the true essence. Only at this stage is lead cast into mercury, achieving the harmony of water and fire. In the human body, this corresponds to refining essence into qi and forming the golden elixir’s spirit chamber.

The secret method lies in the moment of yang arousal, the living midnight. Yet the living midnight also differs between the primordial and the postnatal, as the *Awakening to Reality* describes as "two kinds of function." If desire is aroused by sensory encounter, giving rise to thoughts, this is the postnatal human heart, stirred by desire. At this time, one must employ the method of pursuit and restraint: secure the upper and lower gates, settle the body and calm the heart, lower the eyelids to inwardly illuminate the Yin Heel, and guide it upward from the tailbone. Stir the bellows to penetrate the void, and the thought will vanish, the desire will extinguish. Though this yang qi carries the fire of desire, if it lingers in the Mud-Pillow Palace without the method of transmutation, its accumulation will eventually erupt through the crown, leading to seated transformation. The remedy is to use the Celestial Eye to encircle the Mud-Pillow Palace, rotating the intention thirty-six times to the left and twenty-four times to the right. After a brief pause, this yang qi will naturally transform into a cold spring and descend into the Crimson Palace, dispersing into the meridians. Even a short period of tranquil sitting yields minor benefits.

As for the primordial living midnight—whether at midnight, the hour of *zi*, or the hours of *chou* and *yin*—when stillness gives rise to yang, the body’s ordinary yang qi responds to the yang qi of heaven and earth and arises, not generated by emotional thoughts or qi stimulation. This is the true one’s primordial yang qi of the celestial heart-mind. Yet at this time, there is a proper measure: it must neither be excessive nor deficient. If deficient, the fire is insufficient and the gold does not appear; if gathered, it is mere fire, and the medicine will be consumed, rendering it useless. If excessive, the gold transforms into water and becomes substantial; if gathered, it is mere water, foul and harmful.

Thus, the classic states: "When lead encounters *gui*, gather it swiftly; when gold meets the full moon, it is unfit to taste." One must recognize the equilibrium of gold and water. At the winter solstice, the celestial heart-mind remains unchanged, and in the moment before the myriad things are born, the yang is at its firmest. The Yin Heel and tailbone exhibit a sensation like insects crawling—this is the sign. Swiftly employ the hand seal: gently lift the perineum and the urethra, stir the bellows, and the body’s true qi will draw the yang qi of heaven and earth to enter from the tailbone with a rustling sound. Following the bellows’ *xun* wind, it ascends to the Mud-Pillow Palace. Maintain steadfast observation without movement, and these yin and yang qi will transform into jade dew, sprinkling down into the Crimson Palace. This droplet extinguishes all mundane flames, and the primordial qi emerges to meet it. Entering the Yellow Center, they coalesce into a lump of cinnabar, which is called the "self."

Yet the classic states: "Within a single flavor of water lies gold," revealing that the alchemical tradition, from beginning to end, concerns but this one thing, this one matter. Previously, only the bellows was mentioned; here, refining lead into gold and generating true essence speaks of producing the water within lead-gold, which is used to restrain fire and form earth. This practice still belongs to the work of discipline, hence it is called "refining the self." After refining the self, true earth is established, and one then gathers the qi of heaven and earth to transform earth and generate gold, thereby forming the elixir of pure yang gold-liquid.

The medicine thus possesses depths and shallows, each differing according to the realm. Only when the medicine is obtained and the firing process—withdrawing and adding fire without error—is applied does one become an immortal upon the earth. "Cooking" refers to yang cooking; "refining" refers to yin refining. The medicine must be obtained at the *living midnight*, the moment when the single yang revives within the body, the great medicine acquired in the second watch. From the initial work of laying the foundation and refining the self, all involve the practice of gathering medicine. This is reiterated for clarity: the earlier gathering of medicine served to cultivate the cauldron and furnace, while the present gathering and refining aim to complete the returning elixir.

One must await the quiet midnight hour, when the celestial mechanism stirs of itself, and the external yang arises—this is called the union of heaven and human. Yet one must not gather immediately; rather, one must assist with intention, called "advancing the yang fire," until the tortoise’s eyes round and the dragon’s body stands erect, precisely the firing time. Use only the mind’s eye to illuminate the lower field: the mind is true intention, the eye is the celestial eye. Then, the field will manifest a millet-like pearl, and the inner and outer qi will sense each other’s attraction, growing from subtle to manifest. One feels the true qi drawing in more intensely, with the sensation of insects crawling between the orifices. The chest, abdomen, neck, and back reveal hidden glimmers of true light—this is when the true gold qi is full and the celestial water is just being born. One must swiftly gather it.

Employ the martial fire: lift the urethra, contract the perineum, raise the lower abdomen, and open the bellows. After a moment, one senses this medicine transforming into true qi, which must then be guided upward with intention. It will surely ascend with a rustling sound, rising along the Governing Vessel to the brain, halting at the *zhen* (pillar). The *zhen* is the human pillar, the crown of the head, a structure formed after birth as the body’s vital qi ascends. It corresponds to the celestial pillar, the central star among the five stars, the congealed essence of heaven and earth. The *chen* position governs the celestial stem, whose light, when shining, gives life, and when concentrated, effects transformation. "Shining" means universal illumination; "concentration" means focused infusion. Creation relies upon it for generation and completion, while the perfected one borrows it to refine the body. Now, it is used to meet the stem and merge with the Conception Vessel, descending from the celestial eye along the pool and pillar: the pool is the upper pool, the mouth; the pillar is the nose bridge, the mountain root. The method of reaching the *zhen* is to greet the star in the brain—the star is the celestial pillar—thereby transforming the mundane and returning to the primordial.

This is of utmost importance, hence it must be held for nine breaths—not out of attachment, but to await the primordial yang qi transforming into sweet dew, which follows the stem and pillar to shower down upon the pool and palace. This dew is cool, fragrant, and sweet, its mysterious function boundless. Moreover, its showering along the stem and pillar holds profound significance. The Master of the Mud-Pillow says: "The tangible dew follows the stem to dot the palace; the intangible dew follows the pillar to return to the Yellow Center." Thus, all dew descending via the Magpie Bridge to rest in the Crimson Palace must be swallowed through the mouth to pass through the tower and reach the barrier, where it divides into clear yang and turbid yin. The perfected one at this stage stores the turbid yin to transform into blood and fluids, circulating through the meridians, while the clear yang merges into the central Yellow, uniting with one’s primordial qi. Following the true intention, within the central palace, it revolves left-up and right-down from small to large for thirty-six cycles, then right-up and left-down from large to small for twenty-four cycles, halting at the center of the central palace—this is called the *mao-you* circumpolar revolution.

Sit in stillness for a while, then rise, sleep, or act as one pleases, without seeking where it settles or where it resides. Only when it feels dissolved into emptiness and non-attachment does it become the true reality of the spiritual breath and the womb of primordial qi. Upon obtaining the medicine and completing its ascent and descent, one feels the entire body at ease and blissful. Beware of attachment, for even a trace of clinging instantly reverts one to the mundane, inviting no small calamity. After the practice, guard only the true breath, floating and roaming within the pupil, without seeking externally. Thus, daily gathering and refining will fill the hexagrams and accumulate grains, filling the three fields, warming the two kidneys like boiling water, igniting the qi sea with fire, and floating the jade liquid in the void. When the great medicine is about to form, one must enter the enclosure to await the birth of the infant, thereby attaining the great Dao of celestial immortality. Guard this closely! Guard it well!

---

To seek the great medicine and verify the golden immortal’s firing process for nine revolutions:

The great medicine is the great returning of gold-liquid, the great medicine of celestial immortals. It is what the *Wuzhen Pian* calls: "To learn immortality, one must learn celestial immortality; only the golden elixir is most certain." The previous medicine was external true lead, called the external golden elixir, also named the jade-liquid returning elixir, the medicine of earthly immortals. Once the jade-liquid is full, one must swiftly enter the enclosure to silently await the birth of the gold-liquid, which will transmute the primordial spirit into the sacred embryo and congeal the primordial qi into the divine treasure.

Choose a blessed mountain and auspicious site to construct the enclosure. Its height, depth, brightness, and darkness must be appropriate. Engage three devoted Daoist companions to guard it. Within the chamber, place a level couch draped with curtains on all sides. Hang a bright mirror above, and place swords to the left and right. Beneath the bed, lay three *jin* of realgar, and upon it, a meditation cushion and a *hunyuan* robe, along with a bolster. Allow no other objects before it. Arrange the eight trigrams at the four corners. Select an auspicious time and report to the Celestial Emperor.

Enter the enclosure and sit in stillness, practicing non-action and non-attachment, focusing the mind within the *guan* (inner elixir field). Let the body be like withered wood, sit in full lotus posture, and remain thus day and night without interruption. Only maintain fetal breathing, where spirit and *qi* embrace each other, neither issuing forth nor entering in—like being within the mother’s womb. To outsiders, one appears as if unconscious, for this is the moment of returning to the root and restoring life. The birth of the gold-liquid may take seven, fourteen, or even twenty-one days. The devoted companions must guard without the slightest lapse, strictly avoiding any disturbance by sound, and especially shunning startling noises. At this time, the adept’s spirit rests in the valley of response; sound may rouse awareness, and noise may cause alarm. If awareness stirs, one falls out of concentration, and the nurturing practice is lost. If startled, the spirit scatters—no misfortune could be greater. As the *Nihuan* states: "The role of external protection is tied to life and death."

When the adept reaches this stage, a moon-like wheel will appear suspended in the west, and a sun-like orb will manifest in the east. In stillness, guard these two wheels as they alternately swallow and spit, eventually merging into a single luminous sphere suspended before the valley. As *Changchun* said: "At this time, the adept relies entirely on understanding companions who, from the side, carefully observe and silently guard. When a radiant light appears between the adept’s brows, they must be promptly informed—not by voice, but by sound alone—so the adept may inwardly comprehend, apply the mind’s *gang* (celestial pivot), and direct the gaze of the attendant spirits. Then the spirit will naturally rest in the valley, and the great medicine of resonance will be born, following the *gang* to merge with the primordial, fusing into a pearl-like essence."

Having attained this state, the adept’s spirit communes with the Great Void, and *qi* flows unimpeded—no longer divided by the three realms or the six directions. This is the moment when, as the alchemical classics say, "gold returns to nature," and the pearl is the divine treasure, the divine treasure is the golden immortal. Once the divine treasure is obtained, one must proceed with ten months of gentle nurturing and carefully sustain the nine revolutions to complete the embryo’s formation and transform the pearl, thereby embodying the sacred infant.

Yet this nurturing and firing differ from earlier stages. Before, there were distinctions of withdrawal, addition, ascent, and descent; now, one focuses the mind within the *guan*, like fish in a spring pond or hibernating insects, absorbing and gathering primordial yang, preventing the dissipation of numinous *qi*, summoning the Great Void, and cultivating primordial essence. This step relies entirely on the *gang* and the two stellar guardians, which must be preserved and illuminated at every moment. The method lies in neither presence nor absence, neither forgetting nor forcing.

As the *Nihuan* master said: "The mind must not scatter, for scattering cools the fire; thoughts must not arise, for arising inflames the fire. Both harm the embryo—utmost care is required." Thus, a full year—equivalent to nine months of work—is called the nine revolutions. The two months of February and August are excluded from firing, not as a complete abandonment but as a time of effortless attention, no longer applying deliberate focus. Yet the withdrawal of fire brings the clarity of water’s tide—this is the time for bathing, the moment to irrigate the yellow sprout.

This method calculates from the day of elixir formation as the Winter Solstice of the eleventh month. Counting ninety days forward, the first bathing occurs at the second month’s node. Taking the day of elixir formation as the first day of the month, the second bathing occurs on the twenty-third day of the eighth month, and the following day becomes the first day of the twelfth month. The time of embryo formation is reckoned as *mao* (the fourth double-hour) for the *mao* month and *you* (the tenth double-hour) for the *you* month. With this flexible method, nurturing and bathing proceed until the nine revolutions of fire are complete, the *qi* and timing are fulfilled, and the infant stirs.

Before proceeding, the adept must self-examine: Has the work of returning and refining reached purity? If all residual mundanity has dissolved, then movement and stillness will be as one, and whether to remain in the world or ascend beyond is a matter of choice. For one has now become the world itself, the earth itself, the heavens themselves—merged with the Dao in truth. What further distinction could there be between entering or exiting, ascending or descending, high or low, near or far, mortal or sacred?

Should the process of aligning with fate—achieving communion, transformation, coagulation, and perfection—proceed unevenly, with lesser progress followed by greater, and the adept’s body remain unrefined, then one must first release a sphere of golden light, suspending it in the void above the crown. This is called the *Mind-Pearl*, corresponding to the Star of Stability above.

Master Tai Xu states: The Star of Stability governs the celestial pivot, formed by the ascent of Earth’s primordial *qi* from *Kun*. Where its light shines, life arises; where its radiance pours, transformation occurs. All beings depend on it for birth and completion. Positioned at the center of heaven, it is the central star among the five, towering above the sun, moon, and all other stars.

My master, Ni Wan, says: In the human body, this corresponds to the *lumen* bone at the crown—the bone where the *qi* of life converges after birth. Lü Dongbin called it the "human stabilizer." Its essence is termed the *Mind-Pearl* in the Golden Palace, employed by the Most High to guard the sacred infant. Disciples must not remain ignorant of this.

If the elixir is attained prematurely, during the phase when the sacred infant has been nurtured but not yet matured, one may temporarily employ this pearl, suspending it in the void above the crown. This compensates for any lingering impurities in the work of returning and refining, or for the untransformed *shen* of consciousness, warding off temptations and humiliations to prevent the infant from being devoured by demonic forces. This has been elaborated in *Zheng Yang’s Final Stroke*. Zheng Yang said: "To speak of cultivating the infant to completion—how easily is it said? Yet so long as a trace of *yin* remains unexhausted, the body’s residual awareness will inevitably attract external demons, colluding to assail and humiliate. The only method is to withdraw and conceal the Dao-body. If progress has been uneven, then merge into the *Mind-Pearl*, allowing self-fusion, self-transformation, and self-creation. Inner and outer dissolve like ice, and over time, the body becomes equal to that of an ancient Buddha."

Tai Xu says: The *Mind-Pearl* is thus precious beyond measure. Yet among the transmitted scriptures of successive patriarchs, few have described it in full. This method was devised to rescue those of inferior root-nature who have not yet penetrated their intrinsic nature. For those whose nature-light has stabilized early, this method is unnecessary at the final stage.

Thereafter, one’s body merges into the pearl, which in turn envelops the body. Inner fusion harmonizes with outer dissolution, refining away all residual mundanity until it is naturally purged. Disciples must simply abide in emptiness—silent, still, and void—to effect this transformation. Eventually, all perceptions vanish, and when stillness reaches its ultimate stillness, the true and constant nature is attained, no different from the state of pure returning and refining.

Though innate endowments differ and entry points vary, whether proceeding with ease or effort, the fruition remains the same. The workings of creation harbor no partiality. Thus, those who verify their attainment must examine themselves: some may choose to remain in the world in their embodied form, fulfilling their nature to the utmost and perfecting their destiny to realize their aspirations.

Min Xiao Gen says: "We who cultivate the Dao devote our lives to diligent practice, all for the sake of verification and ascension. Should we falter even slightly, all prior efforts may be lost. Now, in this text, I have edited and expounded upon oral transmissions, detailing what has been passed down through the world. What is my intent? It is to abridge the descriptions while amplifying the master’s teachings, supplementing them with annotations and verifications. Thus, it may be seen that divine beings indeed possess authentic transmissions—not mere baseless claims."

Nine years of wall-facing severs worldly ties, fulfilling the original vow of immortality. To fulfill this vow, nothing surpasses the practice of wall-facing—undertaken when perfection has been attained but transformation is not yet complete.

Ni Wan says: This is a special transmission outside the teachings of the Western Sage, originating with the Buddha Vajra and inherited by Bodhidharma. Manifesting in the eastern lands, he engaged in nine years of wall-facing. Since then, over centuries, practitioners on both sides of the world have received this lineage, yet few grasp its essential principle.

Yet most pursue it merely to refine nature and fulfill destiny, unaware that when the First Patriarch arrived, his nature and destiny were already perfectly realized—so much so that he could cross rivers on a reed, a clear testament to this. Yet he still practiced nine years of wall-facing, specifically to demonstrate to the perfected ones of this land the shared practice of embodying the present life as the present world, and the present world as the mind—with wall-facing as the essential gateway. Only thus does the vow for a governed world begin to attain fulfillment. The method is fully expounded in Lü Zu’s *Three Numinous Principles of World-Rectifying Practice*, yet it is undertaken while the colored body remains untranscended, hence the instruction to ride the hours, days, months, and years of this very life.

Our tradition is that of the Complete Realization, and the ultimate great endeavor of the Complete Realization points precisely to this step. Thus, the Dao advances through practice, and merit depends on the perfection of virtue—hence the accumulation of three thousand merits and eight hundred deeds. Yet for an ordinary person of low station, how can merit be accumulated or deeds perfected? Only through this special transmission, which requires no strenuous effort, no expenditure of a single coin—only a single heart aligned with the transformations of creation, embodying principle in this very body. With unwavering sincerity and unceasing practice, no result will fail to manifest, no merit will fail to be perfected. The method is supremely simple and easy: it is nothing more than attaining the clarity of heaven and the stillness of earth.

Thus, the mind is heaven, the body is earth, and spirit is the human. When this is embodied, why seek governance beyond the self? Yet these are celestial mysteries, which the sages of old never divulged—until Ni Wan revealed them. I have inherited and recorded them, hence I still call it *Revealing the Celestial Mystery*.

Min Xiaogen says: The *World-Rectifying* tradition is the hidden treasure of the Vinaya school, formerly transmitted only orally. Though this text does not expound it, out of prudence, since the chapter titles have been detailed, the general outline should be briefly sketched. If one doubts this principle, let them read the *Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch*. Having received the master’s instruction, I respectfully supplement and record it here.

Respectfully noted by the later student Min Yide on the seventh day of the seventh month in the *gui-si* year of the Daoguang reign.
