**On Primordial Qi (with Preface):**

Before the chaos, there was the Great Void;
At the dawn of chaos, the Great Harmony resided.
Silent and vast, without preference or aversion—
The Three-in-One merged as the primordial origin,
The Six-in-One coalesced as qi,
All without form or image,
Profound and obscure—
This was the Great Simplicity,
When primordial qi had yet to take shape.

Next came the Great Beginning,
When primordial qi first sprouted;
Then the Great Commencement,
When form and qi first emerged;
Then the Great Purity,
When form and qi acquired substance;
Then the Great Ultimate,
When substance transformed and qi arose.
Before qi divided into forms,
It congealed like an embryo or egg,
Round and complete in its qi—
This was called the Great Oneness.

Primordial qi, first pure, ascended to become Heaven;
Primordial qi, later turbid, descended to become Earth.
Thus, the Dao of the Great Void and emptiness was born.
The Dao, being unborn, is the root of spontaneity—
Indescribable in name,
Yet we know spontaneity is the parent of the Dao,
The root of qi.

Spontaneity is fundamentally One,
The Great Dao is fundamentally One,
Primordial qi is fundamentally One.
This One is the true, perfect, and primordial,
Pure yang qi,
United in body with the Great Void,
Of one heart with the Great Dao,
Of one nature with spontaneity—
Thus it is without beginning or end,
Without form or image,
Pure and turbid as one,
The unformed chaos.
Therefore, its depths cannot be fathomed.

When primordial qi first stirred,
Sprouting forth in its infancy,
Heaven and Earth divided,
Qian and Kun were established.
Yin and yang interacted,
Primordial qi spread forth,
And from their harmony, humanity was conceived.

First came Pangu,
Who at death transformed his body:
His breath became wind and clouds,
His voice thunder,
His left eye the sun,
His right eye the moon,
His four limbs and five extremities the four poles and five peaks,
His blood rivers,
His sinews the earth’s veins,
His flesh fields and soil,
His hair and beard the stars,
His skin and hair the grasses and trees,
His teeth and bones metals and stones,
His essence and marrow pearls and jade,
His sweat rain and moisture.
The myriad creatures upon his body,
Stirred by the wind,
Transformed into the black-haired people.

By Heaven’s decree, they were called "the blue-born";
By their black heads, "the black-headed";
Also "the black-haired."
The basest among them were called "blue heads."
Today, people self-mockingly call themselves "black-headed worms,"
Or "naked worms"—
For after Pangu and before the Three Sovereigns,
All were naked in form.

In the age of the Three Kings,
They began to cut hides and weave grass,
Build nests and dig caves,
Eating the fruits of grasses and trees,
Devouring the flesh of birds and beasts,
Drinking blood and chewing fur,
Crude yet untroubled.
Later, they roasted millet and split pigs,
Drank from earthen cups,
Beat clay drums,
Harnessed the benefits of fire,
The advantages of silk and hemp,
Cast metal and molded clay,
Constructed grand palaces,
Set up watchtowers and barred gates,
Built doors, windows, kitchens,
Roasting, boiling, stewing, grilling—
Nurturing life and sending off the dead,
Honoring ghosts and spirits.

From the Great Void and primordial antiquity
To this age,
The record cannot be complete.
From Fuxi to the present day,
Over four thousand years have passed,
With births, deaths, and transformations,
The establishment of human relations,
As rulers and ministers,
Fathers and sons,
Rises and falls, gains and losses,
Advances and retreats, successes and failures—
Earlier scholars recorded them,
Later scholars inherited them,
Endlessly entangled,
Impossible to exhaust in a single discourse.

Moreover, after Heaven and Earth emerged from the primordial mist,
Humans arose from Pangu’s remains,
Scattered into the warp and weft of Heaven and Earth,
The patterns of Heaven and the principles of Earth,
The Five Nets and Two Luminaries,
The intersecting paths of the Yellow and Red,
The Five Peaks and Hundred Rivers,
Day and night,
Giving birth to the myriad things,
Nurturing all beings—
Of feathers, scales, and shells,
Each numbering three hundred and sixty,
Totaling one thousand eight hundred kinds.
Humans, the foremost of creatures,
Are counted among them.

Humans and all living things
Are endowed with the qi of the primordial One,
And thus are born and formed.
Of all that is born, grows, and matures,
None is more noble or precious
Than the qi of humanity.

Having presumptuously partaken in this one kind,
And shamefully usurped the role of the Three Powers,
I have fished among the hundred schools,
Sifted through the ages,
Thoroughly discussed primordial qi,
Exhaustively traced its roots,
Committed myself to spontaneity,
Turned my heart to the Great Dao,
Sought its profound truths,
Compiled these arcane discourses,
Recorded them in the true scriptures,
To be passed down to future sages.
Those of understanding who encounter this,
Beware of taking life lightly—
Day by day, hour by hour,
Diligently refine and practice,
That your crane-like spirit may dwell among white hair,
And you not come to regret too late.
Those of like mind who receive this,
Should treasure it always.

**Discourse:**
Primordial qi has no name,
Yet its transformations give rise to names;
Primordial qi envelops all alike,
Yet its transformations produce different kinds.
Its enveloping is formless,
Thus it is called "primordial" as one qi;
Its dwelling has form,
Thus it establishes myriad names and appearances.
Therefore, "the nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
The named is the mother of the myriad things."
Constantly desireless, observe its mystery;
Constantly desiring, observe its manifestations.
Manifestations are the surface,
Mystery is the core.
The core is the foundation,
The surface is the beginning.
The beginning may be called the father,
The mystery the mother—
This is the Dao.
That which can be named is not the eternal name.
The two emerge together but differ in name.
Together they are called the Dao,
Apart they are called the profound.
Profound upon profound—
The gateway to all mysteries.

It is also said:
There is a thing, formless yet complete,
Born before Heaven and Earth,
Silent and vast.
Standing alone, unchanging,
Circling without cease,
It may be called the mother of all under Heaven.
I know not its name,
So I style it the Dao.
It is born of spontaneity.

Once the Great Dao exists,
The Dao gives birth to yin and yang,
Yin and yang give birth to Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth give birth to father and mother,
Father and mother give birth to this body.
Emotions, nature, form, and fate
Are all endowed by primordial qi.
Nature is universally enveloped,
Fate differs by kind.
Nature cannot be separated from primordial qi,
Fate follows kind in its transformations.
Thus, the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, and ritual—
These five cannot be momentarily separated.
That which can be separated is not the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, or ritual.

The Dao is trust,
Thus it is honored in the central palace,
Called the Dao of the Yellow Emperor.

Virtue is wisdom,
Thus it is honored in the north,
Called the Black Emperor’s virtue;
Benevolence is humanity,
Thus it is honored in the east,
Called the Azure Emperor’s benevolence;
Righteousness is timeliness,
Thus it is honored in the west,
Called the White Emperor’s righteousness;
Ritual is law,
Thus it is honored in the south,
Called the Vermilion Emperor’s ritual.

Thus, the Three Sovereigns are styled the Great Dao,
The Five Emperors are styled the Constant Dao—
These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names.

Primordial qi is fundamentally one,
Yet its transformations give rise to the ten thousand things.
The ten thousand things must obtain the One
To achieve generation and completion.
If the ten thousand things lose the One,
They immediately return to the realm of death—
Thus the One must not be lost.

The One is called the Great One.
The Great One divides to form Heaven and Earth,
Heaven and Earth are called the Two Modes.
The Two Modes divide to establish the Three Powers,
The Three Powers refer to humanity—
Thus it is said: "When the powers are complete, humanity is perfected."
Humanity divides into the four seasons,
The four seasons divide into the five phases,
The five phases divide into the six pitch-pipes,
The six pitch-pipes divide into the seven governances,
The seven governances divide into the eight winds,
The eight winds divide into the nine qi.
From one to nine is the number of yang;
From two to eight is the number of yin.
Nine nines are eighty-one, the supreme limit of yang’s ninefold completion;
Eight eights are sixty-four, the supreme limit of yin’s sixfold completion.

The One contains the five qi—this is called universal enveloping;
The One transforms into the ten thousand things—this is called differentiation by kind.
Though divided into three and into the ten thousand,
They cannot be momentarily separated from the one qi.

The five qi follow fate to form nature,
Pursue things as intentions shift,
And are stained by customs and habits—
Thus their transformations are boundless,
Not merely ten thousand in number,
Hence it is said: "The wandering soul brings about change."
For instance:
The old man of Wudu transformed into a woman,
The ancestress of the Jiang clan transformed into a soft-shelled turtle,
The Black Womb Clan’s pig changed into a human,
The man of Kuaiwu in An transformed into a tiger—
These are verifications of the wandering soul.

The One contains the five qi:
The soft qi becomes water—water’s number is one;
The warm qi becomes fire—fire’s number is two;
The gentle qi becomes wood—wood’s number is three;
The hard qi becomes metal—metal’s number is four;
The wind qi becomes earth—earth’s number is five.

Before the five qi took form,
Before the Three Powers were divided,
Before the Two Modes were established,
There was chaos—
Also called the Primal Chaos,
Also called the primal mass like an egg.
The five qi were blended as one;
Once the One divided from the primal,
It arrayed itself as the five qi.
When qi emerged, it bore images—
Thus it is called "qi-images."

Zhang Heng’s *Ling Xian* and *Hun Tian Yi* state:
"The root of covering and supporting
Is none other than primordial qi;
The origin of numinous luminaries
Is the division of qi into primal images."
In ancient times, the former kings trod the celestial path,
Using it to establish numinous patterns.
Tracing back to the primal origin,
They first aligned it with the celestial sphere—
This was called the Correct Instrument,
This was called the Established Measure.
Only then could the August Ultimate be erected,
And the revolutions of the heavens be examined—
This was the root of "warping Heaven and wefting Earth."

The sage fundamentally has no mind,
Yet through this, a mind arises.
The mind is born of things,
And dies in things.
The mechanism lies in the heart and eyes—
The ten thousand mechanisms of Heaven and Earth,
Success and failure, rise and fall,
Gain and loss, departure and abiding—
All arise from the heart and eyes.

Death belongs to yin,
Life belongs to yang.
Within yin and yang lies the art of the Way of life,
Yet those who do not know the path of cultivation
Constantly wander the byways of life and death—
Thus Mo Di grieved over silk,
And Yang Zhu wept at the fork in the road—
This is the reason.

Before the Great Simplicity,
There was profound clarity and mysterious stillness,
Silent and dark, beyond all images.
Within, there was only emptiness;
Without, there was only nothingness.
This state endured eternally—
It is called the Primordial Abyss,
The root of the Dao.

Once directions were established,
The Great Simplicity began to sprout.
Though sprouting, it had not yet manifested—
One qi, uniform in color,
Chaos undivided—
Thus it is said: "There was a thing chaotically formed."
Yet though its qi was formed,
It could not yet take shape.
Its measures of slowness and swiftness
Could not yet undergo transformation.
This state endured eternally—
It is called the Vast Swan,
The trunk of the Dao.

Then primordial qi split apart,
Hard and soft first divided,
Yin and yang conjoined their essences,
Clear and turbid took their separate places.
Heaven was completed on the outside,
Earth was settled within.
Heaven embodies yang,
Resembling the trunk of the Dao—
With things, it forms a body;
With the compass, it covers and nurtures;
Through movement, it begins to generate.
Earth embodies yin,
Resembling the root of the Dao—
With namelessness, it forms its substance;
With the square, it bears and gives birth;
Through stillness, it ends in death—
This is what is meant by "Heaven is completed, Earth is leveled."

Once in motion, it acts and bestows;
In stillness, it contains and transforms.
Pent-up qi conjoins its essences,
Timely nurturing the myriad kinds—
This is called the Celestial Origin,
The substance of the Dao.

In Heaven, images are formed;
On Earth, shapes are formed.
Heaven has nine positions,
Earth has nine regions.
Heaven has the three luminaries,
Earth has mountains and rivers.
There are images to be emulated,
Shapes to be measured.
Natures and dispositions are infinitely varied,
Interconnected and mutually responsive—
Naturally giving rise to one another,
Beyond all reckoning.

The warp and weft of the cosmic order—
Here I briefly expound them.
The four directions and eight extremities
Are the boundaries of Earth.
Its diameter is 232,517 *li*;
North to south is 1,000 *li* shorter,
East to west is 1,000 *li* broader.
From Earth to Heaven is half the distance to the human pole;
The depth of the Earth’s center is likewise half this distance—
The diameter and circumference are half those of Heaven.
Calculating the distance between Heaven and Earth:
110,258.5 *li*—
Multiplying this by four yields the great number of the Primal Chaos.

The Way of Heaven moves leftward,
Opposing the movement of things—
Thus Heaven’s qi fills the left and contracts the right.
Heaven revolves through yang,
Earth halts its wheel through yin.
Thus Heaven achieves its movement,
Bestowing qi and unfolding light;
Earth achieves its stillness,
Eternally awaiting the signs of brightness.
Heaven moves in compliance,
Not losing its light—
Thus the four seasons follow their order,
Cold and heat do not err.
Earth is still in compliance,
Not losing its body—
Thus the ten thousand things flourish,
And life and death follow their rites.

Thus the myriad beings take form—
Heaven and Earth employ their compliance.

Of all that is vast, none surpasses Heaven;
Of all that is thick, none surpasses Earth;
Of all that is abundant, none surpasses water;
Of all that is hollow, none surpasses soil;
Of all that is radiant, none surpasses wood;
Of all that is solid, none surpasses metal;
Of all that is insubstantial, none surpasses fire;
Of all that is luminous, none surpasses the sun and moon;
Of all that is dim, none surpasses the dark void—
When the sun and moon, though bright, encounter the dark void,
they are eclipsed and obscured, their light dimmed.
How much more so for man?

Earth possesses mountains and peaks, rivers and valleys,
wells and springs, great rivers and streams,
caverns and lakes, ponds and marshes,
dikes and swamps, ravines and gullies—
all to exhale and disgorge its qi.
Heaven possesses the constellations and stars,
three hundred and forty-eight in all,
formed from the essence and qi of Heaven,
congealed and luminous as stars.

Stars—
their bodies arise from Earth,
their essence is perfected in Heaven,
arrayed in ordered ranks, each with its proper place.
These are called the "suspended images,"
or the "mysterious images"—both names may stand.

The sun and moon measure seven hundred *li* in circumference,
with one thirty-sixth part;
their central land spans two hundred *li*,
with one thirty-second part.

The sun is the sovereign of yang essence,
accumulating essence to form its image,
its image taking the shape of birds—
the golden rooster, the firebird,
all said to have three feet,
symbolizing the yang kind, their number odd.
The moon is the sovereign of yin essence,
accumulating essence to form its image,
its image taking the shape of beasts—
the jade hare, the toad,
all with four feet,
symbolizing the yin kind, their number even.

Thus the numbers of odd and even,
the qi of yin and yang,
do not lose their luminosity—
truly born of the Primal Qi.

Man receives the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth,
beginning with the union of father’s essence and mother’s blood,
yin and yang conjoined, above and below in harmonious compliance.
Spirit divides, qi diminishes,
body forgotten, self abandoned—
then my nature descends,
my life is recorded at birth.
For ten months within the womb—
all men dwell in the embryonic sac for ten months,
as explained in the final scroll—
yet in truth, conception spans thirty-eight *la*.
One *la* is one seven-day period.
Each day brings one transformation,
thirty-eight transformations in all,
then the fetus seeks birth.

At the time of seeking birth,
within four days,
those of keen wisdom and brightness—
as if in a royal chamber,
receiving every joy—
emerge with ease,
as if descending from Heaven.
Mother and child are well,
free from all suffering;
kinsfolk rejoice,
neighbors celebrate.
Those of wickedness and perversity—
as if in a prison cell,
enduring every torment—
the two lives contend,
suffering unbearable pain.
Kinfolk are anxious,
neighbors are alarmed.

For all in the world who receive conception,
the count of days is fixed—
yet good and evil diverge.
How can a child of man defy the Five Inversions?

When a child reaches thirty days,
celebration is held,
called the "full month"—
a custom long established.
Qi is complete, form is whole,
all spirits are present.
Like the Two Modes dividing the Three Powers,
the body follows Earth, models Heaven,
embracing yin, holding yang—
like a melon ripe, its stem loosened,
pecking and hatching in unison.
Thus is the newborn brought forth,
the red child.

The perfected man harbors the Dao and virtue,
his nature serene, his emotions tranquil,
embracing the One, guarding emptiness,
calm and untroubled.
His body merges with the Void,
his mind rests in embryonic breathing.
Thus it is said:
"One whose virtue is profound
is compared to the red child."

The heart of the red child
is one with the heart of the perfected man.
Within, it is preserved by the Dao and virtue;
without, it is protected by spirit and luminosity—
like a loving mother with her red child.

The red child’s heart is whole harmony;
the sage’s heart is whole virtue.
Externally, there is no mind of discrimination;
internally, there is no heart to harm.
The red child, in whole harmony,
can clench its fists and grasp firmly—
so it is said:
"Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.
Unknowing the union of male and female, the *xiao* stirs—
the perfection of essence."
Crying all day without hoarseness—
the perfection of harmony.

The firm grasp arises from the fullness of Primal Qi,
weak bones and soft sinews.
Unknowing the union of yin and yang,
yet the source of contained qi stirs—
this is the work of pure and unadulterated essence and qi.
Yin is the female, yang the male;
*xiao* refers to the source of qi and life.
The source of qi and life
is the root of Primal Qi.

The red child’s heart is free of desire,
its mind without discrimination.
Though the *xiao* stirs,
it is not drawn by external cravings,
never fearing the breach of the tailbone’s gate.
Its qi is true, its essence pure,
flowing and returning naturally,
free and unconstrained,
following its nature, abiding in truth.
Thus it is called "the perfection of essence."
Crying all day without hoarseness—
this is the perfection of pure harmony.
Hoarseness is the breaking of the voice.
The red child, with Primal Qi filling within,
true essence secure,
perfect harmony unbroken,
does not scatter.

The *Shangqing Dongzhen Jing* states:
"Man’s birth—
he receives the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth,
becoming spirit and form;
he receives the Qi of the Primal One,
becoming fluids and essence.
When Heaven’s qi is depleted, spirit scatters;
when Earth’s qi is depleted, form sickens;
when Primal Qi is depleted, life is exhausted.
Thus the Way of the Sovereign One’s Returning Wind
flows back through the hundred vessels,
upward to replenish the Muddy Pellet,
downward to strengthen Primal Qi.
When the brain is full, spirit is whole;
when spirit is whole, qi is whole;
when qi is whole, form is whole.
Form whole, the hundred passages are harmonized within,
the Eight Evils vanish without.
When Primal Qi is full,
marrow congeals into bone,
intestines transform into sinews—
all through pure and unadulterated essence,
original spirit, original qi,
never leaving the body.
Thus can one attain long life."

Master Qin Shaoqi’s *Discourse on the Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Difficulties* states:
"Men are born in *yin* (*wood*, yang);
women are born in *shen* (*metal*, yin).
Primal Qi arises in *zi*—
here lies the origin of man’s life."

The man proceeds thirty steps leftward from *zi*, the woman twenty steps rightward from *zi*, both arriving at *si*—here husband and wife conceive, receiving the qi of gestation. The man proceeds ten steps leftward from *si* to *yin*, the woman ten steps rightward from *si* to *shen*—both undergo ten months of receiving qi, until qi is full and form is complete; *yin* and *shen* are thus where man and woman are born.

Proceeding thirty steps leftward from *yin* to *wei*, *wei* is called "Lesser Auspice," the culmination of a man’s life cycle. Proceeding twenty steps rightward from *shen* to *chou*, *chou* is called "Greater Auspice," the culmination of a woman’s life cycle. Only then may a man marry and a woman be betrothed. If this order endures without cease, Primal Qi will never be exhausted, essence and qi will never scatter—thus can one attain long life.

Now, the Primal Qi of Heaven and Earth arises from the position of *zi*, which belongs to *Water*. The trigram of *Water* is *Kan*, governing the eternal North, corresponding to the *Yue* and *Jizhou* regions. Human Primal Qi is the same as that of Heaven and Earth, residing in the kidneys within the body.

Human Primal Qi possesses the marvel of natural stillness, embracing the pure, empty, and mysterious body. Mysterious beyond mystery, marvelous beyond marvel—this is called the "Gate of Myriad Marvels," the wondrous path of Primal Qi. Thus, the mysterious is called *spirit*; the numinous of spirit is called the *Dao*; the Dao gives birth to the body of spontaneity—hence can one attain long life. The root of life is none other than Primal Qi.

The kidneys are the chamber of spirit; if spirit has no chamber, it cannot rest; if the chamber has no spirit, how can one be healthy? When the chamber is firm, spirit dwells in peace. Then one transforms from the mundane to the sagely, and spirit attains numinous communion. If spirit loves life but the chamber cannot be secured, spirit cannot rest, the chamber becomes desolate, and one is cast into the realm of death.

If one cultivates movement with subtlety, diligently refines progress, maintains inner purity and outer stillness, and severs all defilements, then the grandly fortified chamber will allow spirit and soul to dwell in peace. Spirit and its divine counterpart constantly serve as guardians; body and spirit mutually cherish and protect. Thus, when the body attains the Dao, spirit also attains the Dao; when the body attains immortality, spirit also attains immortality. Body and spirit depend on each other, reaching into the boundless.

Primal Qi is the source of life, namely the moving qi between the kidneys. It is the root of the five viscera and six bowels, the origin of the twelve meridians, the gate of breath, the source of the Triple Burner—also called the "Spirit that Guards Against Evil." The sage likens it to a tree for illustration. This qi is the root of human life; if the root is severed, the viscera, bowels, sinews, and meridians become like branches and leaves—when the root rots, the branches wither, as is evident.

**Question:** What is the moving qi between the kidneys?
**Answer:** The right kidney is called the *Gate of Life*. The qi of the *Gate of Life* moves and emerges from between them, for the space is central, and movement arises from life. It is the tether of Primal Qi, the abode of spirit and essence. The *Gate of Life* holds the spirit of true essence, which excels at securing and guarding. When defense is perfect, evil qi cannot recklessly enter—hence it is called the "Spirit that Guards Against Evil." If it fails to guard against evil, evil will enter, and upon entry, one dies.

That by which one preserves life is this: Primal Qi belongs to *yang*, and *yang* is *ying* (nutritive qi); blood and vessels belong to *yin*, and *yin* is *wei* (defensive qi). When *ying* and *wei* flow constantly, life endures. They are also called *ying* and *wei*: *ying* and *wei* are the flourishing qi and vessels, like the blossoming of trees. *Ying* and *wei* nourish the viscera and bowels, cherish spirit and qi, enabling their circulation and safeguarding the path of life.

It is also said: the clear is *ying*, the turbid is *wei*. *Ying* flows within the vessels, *wei* flows outside the vessels. By day, they circulate through the body; by night, they circulate through the viscera. In one hundred *ke*, they complete fifty cycles, converging at dawn. At the *cun*, *guan*, and *chi* positions of both hands, *yin* and *yang* interpenetrate and flow ceaselessly, like following a ring without end. If they cease, one dies; if they flow, one lives. Thus, one must regulate and nurture them, cherishing and preserving them so that *ying* and *wei* circulate without end, spirit and qi never deplete—then one may share the longevity of Heaven and Earth.

After the separation of primordial chaos, the Three Primal Qi of Heaven, Earth, and Water gave rise to humanity and nurtured the myriad things. Humans emulate this, designating the Three Burners and Three Elixir Fields to nourish the body and generate spirit and qi.

There are three positions but no distinct organ; they reside within the body, governing three functions. The Upper Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Heaven and is called the Upper Elixir Field. Its domain extends from above the stomach orifice, below the heart and above the diaphragm, up to the Muddy Pellet. The Upper Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Heaven’s Primal, governing the *Danzhong* point in the chest. The *Danzhong* point regulates warmth between the skin and muscles, like the irrigation of mist and dew.

The Middle Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Earth and is called the Middle Elixir Field. Its domain extends from below the heart and diaphragm to the navel. The Middle Elixir Field receives the yin qi of Earth’s Primal, governing the stomach duct. The stomach duct point lies below the heart, governing the decomposition of grains and ripening of fluids, transforming the flavors of water and grain in the stomach to produce blood and nourish the viscera, bowels, and body—like the steaming of Earth’s qi.

The Lower Burner emulates the Primal Qi of Water and is called the Lower Elixir Field. Its domain extends from the navel down to the bladder and *Louquan* point. The Lower Elixir Field receives the yang qi of Water’s Primal, governing the *Qihai* point one *cun* below the navel, residing in the *Qijie* (Street of Qi), which is the pathway of qi.

The Triple Burner is the master of qi circulation, hence it resides in the *Qijie*, a thoroughfare connecting all directions. The Lower Burner governs the movement of qi and blood, the circulation of meridians, the gathering of spirit and essence, and the interplay of *yin* and *yang*—like water flowing toward moisture, moisture being the source. Moisture refers to water flowing downward, irrigating in due time. Cloud qi ascends, then descends as rain.

The *Immortal Classic* states: "My life is in my hands. Preserve essence and receive qi—longevity knows no limit."

It further states: "Do not exhaust your form, do not dissipate your essence. Return the heart to stillness and silence—thus may one attain long life. The root of life and destiny lies decisively in this Way. Though one may practice breathwork and daoyin, cultivate blessings and merit, study myriad methods, or ingest great elixirs, without knowing the Way of primal qi, it is like a tree with lush branches and leaves but no roots—how can it live long?

If one indulges in the pleasures of the long night—sensual delights and carnal joys—these may seem abundant, yet one will ultimately encounter the sorrow of early death and the eternal pain of burial in the yellow springs. Such shallowness is indeed extreme. But if one spends years in diligent cultivation, following methods to extend life, adhering to the Jade Canon’s teachings, observing dietary prohibitions, and grasping the essence of primal qi—restraining the hun-soul, controlling the po-soul, preserving the embryo, and halting essence—this shallowness is not present. One will ultimately attain enduring longevity and dwell forever in the celestial realms. Such profundity is indeed extreme.

Thus, the limits of life and destiny are truly finite, while the passions of desire are boundlessly insatiable. To pursue endless desires with a finite life is to hasten one’s own destruction. Earth may muddy a river, but it cannot muddy the sea; wind may uproot a tree, but it cannot uproot a mountain. Desire may disturb the petty person, but it cannot move the noble one—why is this so? The noble one is a hermit, while the petty person is a wanderer.

One must recognize that one’s nature has limits, and life’s tenure is precarious. If the pivotal mechanism is not shown, the essential Way not transmitted, the heart’s compliance not proclaimed, and the essence of refinement not imparted, then even a single phrase may remain unknown for ages, and a lifetime of study may not yield the hearing of the Dao.

What, then, is the Dao? The Dao is primal qi. Primal qi is the end of life. The end of life lies solely in the art of the center. Taking the preservation of the Dao as the method and the transformation of essence as the subtlety, one causes qi to flow unimpeded. Thus, flowing water does not stagnate, and a door hinge does not rot.

If one knows the mystery within the mystery, and man and woman cultivate together, husband and wife both become immortals—this is called the wondrous Way. The *Immortal Classic* states: "One yin and one yang are called the Dao; the union of the Three Primes and Two Harmonies is called the elixir. Tracing the flow to replenish the brain is called returning; essence transforming into qi is called transmutation. With each transmutation, one change, one augmentation—each transformation extends life by one cycle, and nine transformations extend it by one hundred and eight years."

The Queen Mother of the West said: "Inhale and exhale the Great Harmony, preserve and guard the natural. First honor the qi, for qi is the source of life." The Way of augmentation and transformation—augmentation refers to augmenting essence, and transformation refers to transforming form. Those who can augment and transform are recorded in the registers of the highest immortals; those who cannot augment nor transform do not escape the calamity of death.

Those who practice this Way are said to constantly contemplate the Numinous Treasure. The numinous is spirit, and the treasure is essence. Simply cherish qi and treasure essence, grasp firmly and close the mouth, swallow qi and swallow fluids. Fluids transform into essence, essence into qi, qi into spirit, spirit back into fluids, fluids back into essence, essence back into qi, qi back into spirit. Thus, seven returns and seven reversions, nine transformations and nine changes—once essence is augmented, form is transformed. This transformation is not death but the living transformation of form: changing old age into youth, youth into childhood, childhood into infancy, and infancy into the newborn. This is the true person.

When this Way is accomplished, it is called embryonic breathing. With unwavering cultivation, spirit and essence overflow, primal qi grows robust, the brain congeals, and the bones are renewed. As the *Immortal Classic* says: "In the Way of yin and yang, essence and fluids are the treasure. Guard them carefully, and one may grow old only after the celestial mandate." It further states: "If you desire long life, you must enter through the gate of your origin. Dwell and move with moderation, advance and retreat in proper measure, act and rest according to method, depart and remain by rule—thus may you extend life and cure illness."

It also says: "Refining gold with gold is called true gold; refining a person with a person is called a true person. People often lose the Dao—it is not the Dao that loses people. People often depart from life—it is not life that departs from people. Always nourish the spirit and do not lose the Way of life. Let the Dao and life preserve each other, and spirit and life guard each other—then form and spirit shall both endure."

The Queen Mother said: "A person refining qi is like a dragon refining water. Qi returns to the natural, spirit returns to emptiness, and essence returns to the Mud Pill Palace. Water flows from high sources: upward into the Celestial River, downward into the Yellow Springs, and horizontally into the hundred rivers—ultimately returning to the four seas. Qi and water circulate through heaven and earth, flow through the human body, revolving endlessly and operating without limit. If one can govern them, one’s lifespan aligns with heaven and earth, and one’s brightness matches the sun and moon."

The *Ancient Records of Prohibitions* state: "A person’s primal qi is the feast of the spirit and soul, hence it is said: 'The cinnabar of the child advances the feast of the correct yellow.'" Thus, the spirit consumes primal qi, while the form consumes the five flavors. When qi is clear, the spirit is bright; when qi is turbid, the spirit is sick. Therefore, one must constantly cultivate and refine qi, keeping it clear—this is called refining the spirit and refining the soul, repelling ghosts and controlling the po-soul, so that form and spirit are both at peace.

The hun descends from heaven and is called spirit; the po originates from earth and is called ghost. Ghosts belong to yin, and spirits belong to yang. Thus, refining the hun and spirit, and consuming primal qi, one may live for ten thousand years without dying and ascend to heaven in body. Consuming the five flavors and invoking lascivious ghosts, one dies ten thousand deaths, and the form perishes in the earth.

When the hun flies to heaven and the po sinks into the springs, water and fire separate, each returning to its origin. In life, they share the same body; in death, they diverge. Flight and sinking differ—this is the natural endowment. Why is this so? Consider a single piece of wood: when burned by fire, the smoke rises, and the ash sinks—this, too, is naturally so."

The *Scripture of the Nine August Ones* states: Beneath the Primordial Azure, the moon and sun—two halves—rise together and merge into one. Emerging from that Jade Pool, they enter the Golden Chamber, large as a pellet and yellow as a tangerine. Within lies a fine flavor, sweet as honey; if you attain it, guard it well and do not lose it.

A note explains: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube grow within the human body, their size like a pellet, their hue like a tangerine, their taste exceedingly sweet, sweet as honey. Neither far nor near, they reside in the Chamber of the Heart. The Chamber of the Heart is the abode of spirit, the dwelling of qi, the master of essence, the union of hun and po. The Jade Pool is the fluid produced upon the tongue within the mouth; when this fluid merges with spirit and qi, it is called the two halves becoming one.

The *Great Clarity Declaration* records: In a letter from Xu Yuanyou to Wang Xizhi, it is said: The intertwined pear and fiery jujube are the medicine of ascent. If you, my lord, can cut away the brambles, forsake self and other, and dissolve right and wrong, then these two trees will grow within your heart. Their leaves will flourish, their branches spread, they will bloom and bear fruit. If you partake of even one branch, you may traverse ten thousand miles in a single glance—this is the inner elixir.

Simply nurture the spirit, harmonize the primal qi, and swallow the fluids. When the fluids and essence are inwardly secure, flourishing vitality arises, like a tree whose roots are strong and leaves luxuriant, blooming and bearing fruit, nurturing wondrous flavors surpassing the common. What grows within the heart is none other than the form and spirit. Yin and yang are like the sun and moon, rain and dew, gentle winds and harmonious mists—moistening, nourishing, and irrigating. When qi circulates and breath is regulated, the branches and leaves flourish. When the nature is pure and the heart joyful, the flowers bloom. When essence is preserved and the embryo retained, the fruit forms. When fluids flow smoothly, the flavor is sweet.

The oaths of the ancient immortals were solemn, transmitted mouth to mouth. Now, through brush and ink, they are bestowed—fitting to entrust to an extraordinary person. The *Forest of the Dao* states: This method is also called the *Rite of Jade Elixir and Golden Nectar*. Jade elixir and golden nectar refer to the refinement and consumption of the fluids within the mouth. They are: first, essence; second, tears; third, saliva; fourth, mucus; fifth, sweat; sixth, urine. Within the human body, these six fluids share a single primal qi, distributed among the five viscera, six bowels, nine orifices, and four limbs.

Those who know the art can refrain from emission by year’s end—engaging in union without loss, becoming a solitary immortal who sleeps alone. If one can go all day without spitting, constantly holding and swallowing the saliva, the essence and qi will remain, the fluids will abide, and the face and eyes will radiate light. The *Laozi’s Sectional Exegesis* states: Saliva, when abundant, gathers as the Pool of Sweet Wine; when flowing, it becomes the Palace of the Flowery Pond; when dispersed, it is the fluids; when descending, it is sweet dew. Rinsing and swallowing it irrigates the viscera, moistens the body, unblocks the hundred vessels, nourishes the ten thousand spirits, strengthens the joints and hair, and ensures enduring vitality. This is the so-called inner golden nectar, which can nurture the spirit and replenish the primal qi.

As for refining jade into elixir and smelting gold into nectar, transforming their original substance to be supple yet unyielding, their color gleaming like ice and snow, their fragrance surpassing all scents—drinking a single cup, one’s lifespan will equal heaven’s. This is the so-called outer golden nectar, which can fortify the body and strengthen the viscera. Furthermore, one should not recklessly sweat, for sweat is the messenger of the spirit. When qi is harmonized and movement induces a slight sweat, it is fitting—only avoid rushing into cold winds. If extreme exertion robs the body of essence through sweat, the pulses will drip without cease, greatly exhausting spirit and form. One should move slowly, labor without excess, and in sitting or lying, avoid fatigue. In walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, always act with ease, practicing guiding and pulling, massage and regulation, so that upon rising, one feels light and agile, the mind unobstructed and at ease.

Also, attend to the two matters of excretion, neither forcibly restraining nor allowing excess. Whether obstructed, cold, slippery, or profuse, all harm qi and life, bringing swift calamity. This is what is meant by knowing advance and retreat, preservation and loss—the Dao of the sage. What both sage and commoner treasure is life; what both wise and foolish cherish is the body. Thus, the sage employs the Dao, virtue, benevolence, righteousness, humility, compassion, reverence, frugality, celestial patterns, and human affairs to foretell auspicious omens for the noble. Ritual, music, punitive expeditions, laws, punishments, ghosts, spirits, divination, dreams, and waking portents are shown to the petty.

The essentials of nurturing life begin by cautioning the external and then guarding the internal. When inner and outer are tranquil, this is called skillfully entering non-action. To seek non-action, one must first avoid harm. What does this mean? Keep distant from suspicion, petty people, ill-gotten gains, and reckless actions; be cautious in speech and diet, in the sharpness of the tongue, in bustling places, and in physical conflict. Constantly reflect on one’s faults and reform to follow goodness. Moreover, one should comprehend celestial patterns, earthly principles, human affairs, ghosts and spirits, timing, and arts and calculations. Thus, one’s merits will equal the sage’s, and one’s virtue will match heaven’s.

Among arts and calculations, none surpass refining the spirit and purifying the true qi to extend years and cure illness. Externally, one wards off evil and malign influences, purifies heart and body, so that misfortune does not encroach. The *Discourse on the Dao and Virtue* states: Among the images of the Great Center, none is loftier than the Dao and virtue; next, none is greater than spirit and illumination; next, none is more expansive than Great Harmony; next, none is more revered than heaven and earth; next, none is more evident than yin and yang; next, none is clearer than the sage’s works.

The Dao and virtue can be spoken of but not traced to their origin; spirit and illumination can be born but not extended; Great Harmony can be embodied but not transformed; heaven can be traversed but not proclaimed; yin and yang can be employed but not obtained; the sage’s works can be observed but not articulated. Know that what can be spoken of is not the natural Dao; what can be illuminated is not the pristine truth. For those who cultivate non-action to enter the true Dao, one must first preserve the Dao’s qi within the body and rest the primal qi within the viscera. Then, aided by medicinal substances and supported by a hundred practices, one can internally cure the ten thousand illnesses, externally pacify the ten thousand spirits, return the inner qi to its origin, and naturally repel external evil.

Repelling calamities externally while nurturing spirit and virtue internally—when inner and outer mutually sustain one another, preserving body and life, is this not excellence?

As *Laozi* states: "When merit is accomplished and fame attained, withdraw the self—this is the Dao of Heaven." It also says: "When merit is accomplished and affairs completed, the people all say, ‘We are naturally so.’" And further: "Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes true; cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal." Observing the self through the self, observing the world through the world—how do I know the world’s nature? By this.

Thus, when instructing the Son of Heaven, one models affairs upon Heaven; when instructing feudal lords, one governs the state with proper administration; when instructing in military affairs, one dares not act as the host; when instructing in powerful implements, one must not display them to others; when instructing in worldly conduct, one harmonizes light and blends with the dust; when instructing in leaving the household, the Dao opposes the secular; when instructing in nurturing nature, the Valley Spirit does not die; when instructing in preserving life, good fortune and longevity do not perish; when instructing in cultivating the body, spirit is preserved and qi is complete; when instructing in cultivating the mind, the mind is emptied to guard the Dao; when instructing in foresight, one constantly excels at saving beings; when instructing in karmic retribution, spirits do not harm people. This is what is meant by "few affairs, profound principles"—all depends on the person’s preparation and transmission.

Those who attain it possess bones and joints firm and strong, complexions joyful and lustrous; though old, they return to youth, neither declining nor decaying, abiding long in the world, attaining longevity and enduring vision. Cold, heat, wind, and dampness cannot harm them; ghosts, spirits, and spectral beings dare not approach; the five weapons and hundred insects dare not injure; sorrow, grief, joy, and anger do not burden them. Constantly using the Six Classics to instruct the common folk and employing masters of methods to transmit techniques—this is truly grasping the essentials of the Dao.

The Perfected One says: The sage knows that the primordial qi arises at *zi*, is born in the kidneys, is enveloped at *si*, gestates at *wu*, thus abides in the heart, rests in fire, is nurtured in *wei* earth, is born in *shen* metal, bathed in *you*, girded at *xu* earth, attains office and glory in *hai*, reigns as sovereign in *zi* water, declines in *chou* earth, ails in *yin* wood, dies in *mao* thunder, and is interred in *chen* wind. Interment means concealment, return, and ending.

The primordial qi originates in water and ultimately returns to wind, concealing wind within earth—this is called returning the hun-soul. *Xun* is wind, *chen* is earth; water flows and returns to *chen*, hence it is said that the earth is deficient in the southeast, and water flows into the *xun* gate. As *Liezi* states: "Beyond the seas there is a great abyss called the Tail End, where all great waters drain." The primordial qi of humans likewise has a Tail End abyss, thus resembling water.

Know that earth conceals wind, wind conceals earth, earth conceals water, water conceals earth, earth conceals fire, fire conceals earth—thus fire is interred in *xu* earth, and water is interred in *chen* earth. Earth conceals wood, wood conceals earth, earth conceals metal, metal conceals earth—thus wood is interred in *wei* earth, and metal is interred in *chou* earth. Earth can conceal wood, metal, water, and fire, and earth itself also returns to earth—thus it is interred in *chen* earth. This is the Dao of returning to the origin, reverting to the root, and restoring life.

*Laozi* says: "The myriad beings flourish, each returning to its root. Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called restoring life; restoring life is called constancy; knowing constancy is called clarity." This is to know the principle of the constant Dao and comprehend the affairs of the speakable Dao—then one knows the path of clarity and reaches the level expanse of the shore.

Thus it says: "Know the white, guard the black—this is the model for the world. Knowing constancy, one is accommodating; being accommodating, one is impartial; being impartial, one is kingly; being kingly, one accords with Heaven; according with Heaven, one accords with the Dao; according with the Dao, one endures." This is called the impartial Dao. "Stealing" the impartial Dao, "stealing" Heaven and Earth—all things are universally accommodated.

*The Scripture of the Hidden Talisman* states: "When the Three Thieves are harmonized, the Three Powers are at peace." Thus it says: "Eat in season, and the hundred bones are ordered; move the mechanism, and the myriad transformations are at peace."

The Perfected One says: Those who know this Dao recognize true water and true fire, true lead and true mercury, true dragon and true tiger, true teeth and true chariot, true gold and true stone, true wood and true earth, true cinnabar and true medicine, true spirit and true qi, true beings and true essence, true guest and true host. Once all are recognized as true, then follow the teacher to employ the teacher, follow the Dao to employ the Dao, follow the technique to employ the technique, follow the method to employ the method. Refine and temper, wash and sift, grind and purify, harmonize and practice—this is why immortals call the eight-character wondrous gate and the one-origin true method: "Empty the heart, fill the abdomen; hunger for qi, thirst for fluid."

The oral instruction says: "Constantly maintain an empty and tranquil mind—even goodness is not stored, let alone a speck of filth or evil!" This is what is meant by "still the mind and guard the One, eliminate desires and cease disorder." When all impurities are removed, all affairs are complete. Always keep the abdomen full and replete—what is meant by "the abdomen free of dregs and filth, containing only true essence and primordial qi." Refining and tempering without cease, naturally the flower blooms and the fruit forms.

When hungry, swallow qi; when thirsty, swallow fluid. When neither hungry nor thirsty, harmonize and practice, ensuring circulation and flow, unobstructed and unimpeded, joyfully content, blissfully at ease—unaware of the size of Heaven and Earth, unaware of the revolutions of the sun and moon. One may take eight hundred and ten years as a single great cycle.

As for the methods of refinement: they speak of harmonizing and uniting spirit and qi, ensuring they circulate without exhaustion in the kidneys. The kidneys are the Gate of Life—hence this is called the art of life. When spirit and qi are inexhaustible, the bodily form attains long life. Refining the bones and transforming the form, one roams the imperial court, attains the rank of Perfected One, and nurtures the primordial qi—both men and women preserve it.

The *Scriptural Hymn* says: "The Dao treasures essence; this treasure should be kept secret. Bestow it upon others, and they live; retain it for oneself, and one lives. Living for oneself, one eternally transcends the world, and one’s name is recorded in the register of immortals. If one is born into the world, the self is ensnared; when the self withdraws, merit is accomplished and fame attained."

To bind the infant is not yet possible—how much less to abandon it idly? Cast aside and unnoticed, it multiplies; with decline and age, life falls away.

Heaven and Earth possess yin and yang; primordial qi is what humans treasure. To treasure it is to unite with the Dao—only then should one guard it with care. One who nurtures the primordial preserves it ceaselessly, ingesting its qi, returning its essence in cycles, refining its purest essence into harmony.

One who ingests primordial qi cannot be spoken of in the same breath as those who consume a single leaf or flower, a blade of grass or twig, the essence of lingzhi or minerals, the dregs of cinnabar or grit—how could they share the same year or age?

*Laozi* says: Essence is the river-source of blood and vessels, the numinous spirit that guards the bones—thus it is treasured as a jewel. Qi is the cloud-vapor of flesh and muscle, the true substance that secures the form—thus it is treasured as life.

The human body mirrors a kingdom: spirit is the ruler, essence the minister, qi the people. When the people possess virtue, they may be revered; when the ruler follows the Dao, the realm endures forever. Thus, one who cultivates qi with merit may transform it into essence; one who nurtures essence with virtue may transform it into spirit; one who cultivates spirit with the Dao may transform it into the whole body, preserving life eternally.

The *Three-One Formula* says: In refining primordial qi and the true spirit, those who preserve the Three-One see essence transform into spirit, spirit into the infant, the infant into the Perfected One, the Perfected One into the Red Child. The Red Child is the True One; the One is the Imperial Lord, who governs the body and commands the thirty-six thousand spirits. When the Imperial Lord dwells within, the thirty-six thousand spirits are all present—thus one may ascend in body to roam the imperial court.

The *Celestial Elder’s Ten Stems Classic* says: The Dao of ingesting qi holds qi as the supreme treasure. In one year, it fills and flourishes the skin; in two years, it harmonizes the joints; in three years, it strengthens the bones; in four years, it fills the marrow and brain to fullness. Heaven has four seasons, and qi responds in four years. Ingesting qi and guarding the One, with four years of accomplishment, spirit and form commune. When form communes with spirit, it shines like the sun—seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, arriving without movement, knowing without perception. This is called "one form, a thousand spirits," and one is deemed an immortal; "one form, ten thousand spirits," and one is called an infant; "one form, eighteen thousand spirits," and one is called a Perfected One; "one form, thirty-six thousand spirits," and one is called the Red Child, the True One and Imperial Lord. With the sun and moon, one attains long life; with Heaven and Earth, one shares their age—thus the Dao is perfected.

Primordial qi is one, yet in use it becomes two: employing yang qi, one may fly freely, ascend to the Great Clarity, and wander the Five Peaks; employing yin qi, one may abide in the world with long life, traverse the Great Yang, and roam cave grottoes. This is called the one nature of primordial qi with yin and yang as its two aspects. The One generates the Two, the Two generates the Three, and the Three generate the myriad things. Without primordial qi to distinguish the functions of yin and yang, the myriad things would have no means to be born, transform, and grow. Thus, without primordial qi, spirit is not numinous; without primordial qi, the Dao does not arise; without yin and yang, primordial qi has no form. Form requires qi, qi requires yin and yang, yin and yang require essence, essence requires spirit, spirit requires the Dao, the Dao requires technique, technique requires method, method requires the heart, the heart requires the One, the One requires the true, the true requires the ultimate—ultimate emptiness, ultimate purity, ultimate clarity, ultimate subtlety, ultimate brightness. The ultimate continues without end, transmitted only to those most intimate; it must be bestowed upon the right person—do not give it to those without the Dao.

One who studies the Dao engages in true study; one who studies external matters engages in excessive learning, which is also called the heterodox path. Studying the Dao is called inner study, which concerns the affairs of the inner heart—known as the Three Elixir Fields and the Three Primordial Qi. One elixir holds three spirits; one qi divides into six qi. Yang concludes at nine, yin at six; nine times six is fifty-four, the limit of Heaven and Earth, and also the human limit. Reaching this is called returning to the origin and reverting to the root.

What is called the limit? It is when primordial qi is stored within, with no breath of entry or exit. Even where there are orifices for breath, there is no breath of entry or exit—this is called attaining the Dao, the ultimate void.

The *True Classic* says: In refining primordial qi to the point of no entry or exit of breath, one becomes a fugitive from the registers, no longer governed by the Great Yin, unrecorded by the Three Officials, and secretly guarded by the myriad spirits.

What is called the Primal Chaos? It is qi. All things under the celestial cycle are named Primal Chaos. The qi of Primal Chaos originally arises from wind. Wind’s power is greatest—it sustains Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases. Heaven, Earth, the Three Powers, and the Five Phases cannot surpass the wind. Wind and qi share the same body, yet they can make flowers bloom and willows split, bear fruit and ripen—all through the four qi and eight winds.

Cultivating the heart is the root of the Three-One; refining qi is the tree of the flourishing Dao. With heart and qi, it is like preserving the tree and its root. The root is the heart—preserving the heart preserves qi; preserving qi preserves the One. The One is the Dao; preserving the Dao preserves the thirty-six thousand spirits in their entirety, stilling the myriad affairs. Stilling the myriad affairs, there is nothing not done; in doing nothing, the supreme elixir appears. One who ingests the supreme elixir shares the age of Heaven and Earth.

What is the supreme elixir? It is the true spirit of the Elixir Field, the True One and Imperial Lord who dwells within as master, with all spirits preserving the body, primordial qi undispersed, thoughts severed from lust, qi obeying its spirit, restraining old qi, and attaining breath without entry or exit—one who masters fetal breathing will never see life overturned. This is called the form retaining qi and the spirit moving naturally.

Master Luo Gongyuan’s *Three Peaks Song* says: "When a tree withers, earth is added to its roots; when yang declines, qi is replenished. Nurture primordial qi—take care not to lose measure."

The annotation states: "Nothing is more devoid of passion than trees. When a tree reaches the point of withering decay, even if dust and soil are heaped upon its roots, it may yet flourish anew. Moreover, when tender branches are grafted onto an old tree, it too may attain long life, reverting to fresh vitality. Extending this principle, when yang declines, qi must be replenished—this is only fitting. If declining yang is supplemented with primordial qi without loss, drawing its essence and fluids back into the body, the countenance will return to youth. How much more so for one whose pure, original qi remains undispersed, whose primordial harmony is whole and unified! Should such a one encounter cultivation, the merit will be a hundredfold! Thus, those who study the Dao must take utmost care to prevent their own primordial qi from scattering and fleeing."

The Perfected One says: "In cultivation, one must always remove the hairs from the nostrils, purge the filth and turbidity from the five viscera and six bowels, rinse the mouth and teeth, and bathe the body. Guard against excessive wine, shun inappropriate lust, and avoid improper conduct. When taking food or drink, first offer it before the Hall of Light, with the heart mindful of making sacrifice to the Three Elixir Fields, the Ninefold Unity and Imperial Perfected, and the thirty-six thousand spirit-lords. Maintain singular focus, harmonizing and regulating spirit and qi. From beginning to end, ensure the breath remains even. By steadfastly upholding this, essence and qi will be secured, and one may then practice breath-regulation.

When regulating the breath, first close the mouth and silently observe the outer breath entering through the nose. With intention, anticipate the incoming breath by three parts and retain one part, allowing it to remain. Once the breath has fully entered, anticipate the outgoing breath by three parts and retain one part. In both inhalation and exhalation, regulate one part—this must not be interrupted. The subtlety of breath-regulation lies in harmonizing one’s intention with the nose, thereby naturally arresting the breath. If one does not regulate it, the breath will move autonomously in and out. But if one masters regulation, the breath will no longer dare to move freely—this is called regulation by the person, not by the breath.

Qi and spirit are governed by the Dao, and the Dao is governed by the heart; the heart is governed by intention. Thus, intention is the master of the Dao, and intention may also be called spirit. In general, spirit commands qi, and the subtlety lies in intention. If the nose loses control and the breath escapes through the mouth, one must labor to close it. Press the tongue against the teeth, and if slight discomfort arises, release it slightly, retaining one part in three before closing again. As described above, when regulating the breath, let the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, and the heart think nothing. Practice this cyclically and persistently.

If the qi is not yet harmonized, allow a small portion to escape. Once the intention senses the qi has harmonized, regulate it according to the method. If one’s intention can regulate the breath for a full day as if it were ordinary respiration, the qi will become permanently stabilized. No further release or regulation will be needed; through diligent practice, the qi will naturally remain at rest, no longer entering or exiting through the mouth and nose. Instead, it will flow and disperse effortlessly through the pores of the skin, like wind and clouds in the mountains, marshes, and heavens—free and unconstrained.

As the *Scripture of the Immortals* states: "When primordial qi is harmonized and subdued, one may constantly ingest it without cessation or exhaustion, and it will no longer exit through the mouth and nose." After a hundred days of cultivation, the ears and eyes will naturally cease to perceive.

Those who cultivate must not eat indiscriminately. Any flavor will cause primordial qi to surge and disrupt, preventing the heart from attaining purity. Those who disregard the teachings, indulging only in greed for wealth and sex, envy, gluttony for pungent and foul foods, harboring malice and resentment, disrespecting the methods of immortality, engaging in theft, betrayal, and rebellion—such wicked ones will have their transgressions recorded by the Three Officials. The Northern Yin will summon their souls, and before death, their spirits will scatter and vanish. They will forget past and future, becoming like the drunk and deluded, stumbling in confusion, suffering calamities, and extending misfortune to their nine generations. Their forms will perish in the Nine Springs—this is the consequence of losing the Dao and betraying the divine.

The Perfected One says: "The Dao is without obligation and without favor. Have you not seen the *Scripture of the Unseen Correspondence*, which states: 'Heaven is without favor, yet great favor arises; heaven’s utmost selfishness is employed with utmost impartiality'? The regulation of creatures lies in qi. Life is the root of death, and death is the root of life. Favor arises from harm, and harm arises from favor."

Thus, Heaven and the Dao show no partiality toward humans but extend favor to the myriad things. Humans and the myriad things naturally feel reverence and gratitude toward Heaven and the Dao, not presuming upon their merit. Utterly impartial, utterly selfless, they do not distinguish between right and wrong, great and small, noble and base. They abandon attachment and aversion, relinquishing all deliberation. Therefore, those who follow the celestial seasons will live, while those who defy the celestial will perish. Killing is not done out of selfishness, nor is life granted out of impartiality—it is simply that the rise and fall of beings follow their compliance or defiance, naturally resulting in life or death. Thus, the Dao is said to be without obligation and without favor.

As for the Dao’s accessibility: even enemies may be transformed by it, while those beyond its reach—even parents—will remain forever unenlightened. This is because predestined affinity or its absence is recorded in the celestial registers, not achieved in a single morning or evening. That which is transformed by life is called death, and that which is transformed by death is called life. The roots of life and death alternate in constant recurrence.

Those who are adept at life do not engage in conduct that leads to death, while those unskilled in life do. Those who engage in conduct leading to death will die, while those who engage in conduct leading to life will live. Thus, all who attain life do so through qi. Qi can transform into life or death—into life when it transforms toward life, and into death when it transforms toward death. Hence it is said: "The regulation of creatures lies in qi." It operates through qi’s resonance, not through force. Qi’s resonance arises from emptiness and nothingness, yet it governs the ten thousand existents. Even the heavens and earth, the sun and moon, the stars and constellations, clouds and thunder—all rely on qi’s circulation to prevent collapse and fall.

Vast and boundless, without beginning or end, it rests in its movement and delights in its stillness—this is the naturalness of Dao-qi. As for the regulation of creatures within the body, it truly depends on the heart. Whether one can regulate or not also depends on the heart.

In the dusty world of mortals, where only profit and fame prevail, one who neither flatters nor deceives, neither harms nor injures, who never disrupts the harmony of qi in things and always nurtures a heart of care—such a person approaches benevolence. One who neither covets nor contends, neither affirms nor denies—such a person approaches the Dao.

Neither internal nor external, this treasure is held fast, and the numinous records of yin will inscribe its blessings. Disasters and calamities will recede, misfortunes and mishaps will be unable to intrude. Heaven above and earth below will take heed, lengthening one’s years and extending one’s lifespan. This is the origin of the great Dao’s primordial power.

To bestow kindness upon others is called *en* (grace); to harm or destroy others is called *hai* (injury). Practicing grace brings forth fortune; practicing injury brings forth misfortune. Do not, like one gazing into a mirror seeking an image, let suspicion arise from resonance. Among the deluded and the mad, demonic spirits will disturb the six inches of primordial qi, unsettling the hundred spirits. In an instant, one’s foundation may be lost—this is a profound warning.

The primordial qi spans six inches: three within and three without. If one can preserve one inch, thirty years of life are added. If one can secure all six inches, the myriad spirits will gather in the body, and one will naturally attain eternal longevity. Losing one inch reduces one’s lifespan by thirty years.

The *Formula of Primordial Qi* states: "Heaven and earth may collapse, but my life remains natural." When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dark Pearl, he sent Li Lou, who failed to obtain it, while Wang Xiang succeeded. The Dark Pearl is qi; Li Lou is the eye, and Wang Xiang is the heart. The primordial void is the body of the Dao—empty, natural, and non-doing. Non-doing means the heart does not move. When the heart does not stir, external phenomena do not enter; inner and outer are at peace. When the spirit is settled and qi harmonized, primordial qi arrives of itself. When primordial qi arrives, the five viscera are nourished and unobstructed. When the five viscera are unobstructed, the hundred vessels flow freely. When the hundred vessels flow freely, fluids ascend in response, and one no longer craves the five flavors or suffers hunger or thirst. The three fields are forever sealed. When the Dao is accomplished, the body is full and the storehouses replete, and one’s complexion remains youthful and ever-spring.

In cultivating primordial qi, qi transforms into blood, blood into marrow. In one year, qi is renewed; in two years, blood; in three years, the vessels; in four years, the flesh; in five years, the marrow; in six years, the sinews; in seven years, the bones; in eight years, the hair; in nine years, the form. From then on, one may extend life for ten thousand years—this is called an *immortal*. Nine years refine qi into form—this is called a *perfected one*. Further refining form into qi, and qi into spirit—this is called a *supreme one*.

The *Scripture of Immortals* states: "The spirit always loves humanity, but humanity does not love the spirit." The spirit’s love lies in using the body to nurture the numinous. If one commits evil and brings misfortune, the body is ruined. Once the body is destroyed, the spirit departs, and death follows—how can one not be alarmed? This is what is meant by "not knowing the constant and recklessly acting with malice."

When the Yellow Emperor sought the Dao from the Sovereign One, the Sovereign asked what he had attained. The Emperor listed one thousand two hundred matters, to which the Sovereign replied: "What you have attained are but minor affairs." He added: "If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be illuminated." The Three Ones are the first chapter of the *Yellow Register of the Supreme Sovereign*. Those who understand them will be untouched by the ten thousand misfortunes.

For the art of long life, nothing surpasses ingesting primordial qi, securing the inner through embryonic breathing, and refining the numinous fluid and golden elixir—these are the supreme medicines. Thus, hibernating creatures preserve themselves without eating, for they rely on their primordial qi. When the regulation of qi is accomplished, one may learn to swallow qi. Simply close the mouth, focus the intention, and gently swallow as if eating. Whether swallowing saliva or qi, do so as if swallowing food. Visualize it entering the kidneys and the Gate of Life, ascending along the spine into the palace of the brain, then irrigating the navel and the Five Stars. The five viscera meet, inner and outer resonate, each connected by primordial qi’s channels and bonds. In the circulation of primordial qi, there is no place it does not reach. For any illness within the body, inwardly visualize the five colors—gold, wood, water, fire, earth—mutually generating and overcoming. Direct intention to the afflicted area, and it will be instantly healed.

There is also a wondrous method: though the six breaths—*he*, *xi*, *hu*, *chui*, *xu*, and *si*—are known, they do not compare to the two breaths, cold and warm, in curing the hundred diseases. When regulating qi with ease over time, hold the breath until it warms before swallowing—this is *warm qi*, which cures deficiency and cold. If one swallows immediately upon filling with qi, it is *cold qi*, which cures deficiency and heat. In practice, one must gauge the situation with intention.

For certain illnesses, simply exhale *hehe* ten to thirty times, and one will know its efficacy. Wine poison and food poison are both expelled through the *he* breath. If one can single-mindedly ingest primordial qi and focus on one thing, visualizing and invoking it, one may shine as brightly as the sun and moon.

Heaven attains the One and becomes clear. Heaven is the mud-pill palace, containing the Double Field Palace and the Purple Palace—also called the Brain Palace. There are three palaces within: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the upper Three Ones, whose names are Red Child, Imperial Minister, and Primordial First. Constantly visualizing them sharpens the ears, brightens the eyes, and fills the brain.

Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil. Earth is the qi sea within the navel, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the lower Three Ones, whose names are Infant, Primordial Yang, and Valley Dark. Visualizing them over time ensures the mouth never lacks fluids, the belly is full, the heart is still, and one is neither confused nor deluded—naturally communing with the numinous.

The spirit attains the One and becomes numinous. The heart governs the spirit; the heart is the sovereign, master of spirit and qi’s transformations. Responses follow the heart, neither existing nor non-existing, neither empty nor form. From coarse to subtle, from mortal to sage—the heart is the Crimson Palace, also containing three palaces: the Cinnabar Field, the Cavern Chamber, and the Hall of Light. These are the abodes of the Three Ones, whose names are Perfected One, Vermilion Child, and Radiant Firmness. If one visualizes them without cease, the Imperial One will never leave the body and heart. Body and heart at peace, even if a blade threatens, one need only invoke the One to save another—and surely escape calamity. The Dao does not speak falsely.

The three Cinnabar Fields each house nine spirits, all three inches in height, clad in vermilion robes, vermilion caps, and vermilion shoes, seated upon golden beds and jade couches, with golden censers before them. Constantly visualize their forms and invoke the One—if male, the spirit is nine fen in height; if female, six fen. Both should be visualized and focused upon.

That which is called the primordial destiny is the primordial qi. The destiny of the embodied being cannot arise without qi. Secure the primordial with the Dao, secure destiny with techniques, and body, form, spirit, and qi will endure forever.

The spirit of my destiny is the Three Ones of the three Cinnabar Fields. Their forms, shadows, essence, radiance, qi, and complexion comprise thirty-six thousand spirits, all subjects of the Imperial One. One divides into two: yang qi transforms into the Primordial Dragon, yin qi transforms into the Jade Maiden.

The formula states: Where qi resides, spirit follows and arises; when spirit abides in qi, it returns; when spirit departs, qi disperses. If one can visualize and hold to the spirit to guard the primordial qi, qi will also become spirit, and spirit will also become qi. Cultivating to this point, when qi converges, it forms essence, radiance, qi, and complexion; when qi scatters, it becomes clouds, mist, wind, and rain. Emerging, it becomes disorder; entering, it becomes truth. Above, it binds the Three Origins; below, it binds the myriad things. In stillness, it serves as my body; in motion, it serves as my spirit. The resonance of form and spirit lies in their activation; the transformations of spirit and qi lie in visualization.

The *Scripture of the Three Origins* states: The spirit of the Upper Origin is named Primordial; the spirit of the Middle Origin is named Returning Cinnabar; the spirit of the Lower Origin is named Child Peace. These must also be visualized with the same focus as the Three Ones and the nine spirits. In all actions—coming and going, moving and resting, sitting and rising—encounter them thus. With concentrated intent and single-minded visualization, it is the profound within the profound, the utmost secret of the Dao.
