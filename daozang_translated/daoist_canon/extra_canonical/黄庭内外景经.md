**"The Jade Mirror Classic of the Yellow Court: Inner Mirror Classic, Chapter One of the Upper Clarity**

Before the Purple Mist Void of the Upper Clarity,
The Supreme Way’s Jade Dawn Lord resides in leisure,
Dwelling in the Reeds of the Pearl,
He composes seven-character verses,
Dispersing and transforming into the Five Forms,
Manifesting myriad divine essences.

This is the Yellow Court’s Inner Classic.
With a heart of jade, threefold chanting,
The dancing form ascends to the celestial realms,
Nine breaths radiant—emerging between the clouds,
A divine canopy veiled in childlike purple mist.

This is the *Jade Book* to be refined with precision,
Singing it ten thousand times to ascend to the Three Heavens,
Dissipating a thousand calamities,
Curing a hundred ailments,
Undaunted by the ferocity of tigers and wolves,
And warding off old age to prolong life eternally.

**Chapter Two: The Upper Classic**

Above, the spirit-soul (*魂灵*) abides in the Lower Guan,
To the left, the Minor Yang; to the right, the Great Yin,
Behind, the Secret Door; before, the Life Gate.

Rising with the sun, setting with the moon—
Breathing retains the essence,
As the Original Qi merges with the celestial hosts.
Purple mist ascends and descends,
Three ethereal vapors (*三素云*) nourish the Five Palaces,
Planting the soul-root with the Seven Fluids,
Flowing through the cavernous Lu Pavilion.

Returning to the Yellow Court, embracing the Purple within the Elixir Field,
Illuminating the Inner Chamber, revealing the Yang Gate.

**Chapter Three: The Mouth**

The mouth is the Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Palace,
Rinsing and swallowing the numinous fluid—
No calamity can touch it.
The body radiates luminous brilliance,
Qi fragrant as orchids and lotuses,
Warding off a hundred malevolent influences,
Refining the jade-like visage.

One who practices with diligence ascends to Broad Cold,
Neither day nor night sleeping—
Thus attaining the True.
Thunder roars, lightning surges,
The divine essence merges and merges.

**Chapter Four: The Yellow Court**

Within the Yellow Court, one wears brocade robes,
A purple mist skirt flutters, enveloped in cloud-qi.
Crimson and verdant banners—
The emerald spirit’s verdant staff,
Seven jade incense burners seal the twin gates,
Double doors of gold and jade, hidden mechanisms,
Mysterious springs in shadowed caverns,
Lofty and towering, the Three Fields’ essence refined.
Graceful maidens, slender and veiled in celestial light,
Eightfold splendor shines in the double hall,
Heavenly Palaces and Earthly Gates arrayed like cauldrons and scales,
The numinous platform (*灵台*) steadfast—
Its vigor never wanes.

**Chapter Five: The Central Pool**

Within the Central Pool, the divine wears crimson pearls,
Cloud-silk robes of crimson brocade,
Embroidered with tiger talismans.
The Three-Inch Crossing (*横津*) is where the spirit dwells,
Hidden herbs and shadows support each other.
In the Central Peak’s Chapter Six,

**Chapter Six: The Central Peak**

The Central Peak’s divine essence must be refined with care,
For its cloud-dwelling is where the Jade Emperor sojourns.
The pathways are open, endless—
Brows marked with the Five-Petal Canopy,
Covering the luminous pearl.
Nine depths of sun and moon—
The cavernous void contains no end,
Yet within its dwelling lies the True,
Wearing robes of crimson and crimson pearls.

One who sees this with precision suffers no illness,
The crimson pearl’s luminous skirt—
A radiant, five-petaled splendor.
Beneath the tongue, the *Ying* (*膺*) Spirit emerges,
The shore of life and death.
Emerging from Azure, entering into the Void—
Two breaths radiant.
If one encounters this, they ascend to the Celestial River.

**Chapter Seven: The Supreme Dao**

The Supreme Dao requires no complex formulas—
The True Essence abides within.
The muddy pellet (*泥丸*) and a hundred joints all hold spirit.

The hair-spirit is *Cang Hua* (*苍华*), named the Great Primordial.
The brain-spirit is *Jing Gen* (*精根*), named the Muddy Pellet.
The eye-spirit is *Ming Shang* (*明上*), named the Noble Void.
The nose-spirit is *Yu Long* (*玉垄*), named the Spirit-Firm.
The ear-spirit is *Kong Xian* (*空闲*), named the Silent Field.
The tongue-spirit is *Tong Ming* (*通命*), named the Rectified Pattern.
The tooth-spirit is *E Feng* (*峨峰*), named the Thousandfold Array.

The spirit of the face belongs to the Muddy Pellet,
The Muddy Pellet holds nine true essences,
Each with its own chamber.
Round and square, one inch in measure—
Within, one wears purple robes,
Fluttering like cloud-silks.
Yet to think of one aspect alone
Is to attain boundless longevity.
These are not separate dwellings—
All reside within the brain,
Arranged in ranks, facing outward,
Their presence in the heart corresponds precisely.

**Chapter Eight: The Heart-Spirit**

The heart-spirit is *Dan Yuan* (*丹元*), named *Shou Ling* (*守灵*).
The lung-spirit is *Hao Hua* (*皓华*), named *Xu Cheng* (*虚成*).
The liver-spirit is *Long Yan* (*龙烟*), named *Tai Ming* (*台明*).
The *Yi Yu* (*翳郁*) guides the smoke, mastering turbid and clear.

The kidney-spirit is *Xuan Ming* (*玄冥*), named *Yu Ying* (*育婴*).
The spleen-spirit is *Chang Zai* (*常在*), named *Hun Ting* (*魂停*).
The gallbladder-spirit is *Long Yao* (*龙曜*), named *Wei Ming* (*威明*).

The spirits of the six fu and five zang, their vital essences,
All within the heart move the celestial pathways,
Day and night preserve them—eternal life is assured.

**Chapter Nine: The Lung-Spirit**
The lung’s domain resembles a *Hua Gai* (華蓋),
Beneath sits a youth upon a jade gate.
The seven *Yuan* children regulate the breath,
Corresponding externally to the central peak—nose and navel.
In silk robes of white, with yellow cloud sashes.

When panting and breathing bring discomfort,
Swiftly preserve the White *Yuan* and harmonize the six *qi*.
The immortals, long observing, suffer no calamity—
Practice without ceasing, and the body remains unobstructed.

**Chapter Ten: The Heart-Spirit**
The heart’s domain enfolds a lotus blossom,
Beneath sits a youth in the *Dan Yuan* abode,
Regulating cold and heat, harmonizing *rong* and *wei*.
In crimson silk robes, fluttering with jade patterns,
Golden bells and vermilion sashes, seated in *po sha* splendor.

Adjusting blood and vital command—no withering of the body,
Externally manifesting in mouth and tongue, the five *hua* emitted.
At the brink of death, call upon it—revival is granted.
Long practice brings ascent upon the *Tai Xia*.

**Chapter Eleven: The Liver**
Within the liver shines a jade-lined chamber,
Beneath dwells the youthful *Shen Gongzi*, clad in azure.
He governs the *guan*’s mirror—its clarity first appears,
In emerald brocade robes, adorned with jade bells.

He harmonizes the soul and spirit, balancing the body’s fluids,
Externally manifesting in eyes—pure as sun and moon.
A hundred remedies gather here, yet none prevail without his essence,
For seven days of practice, self-repletion is assured.
At the brink of death, invoke him—revival is granted,
Soul and spirit restored, eternal and unshaken.

**Chapter Twelve: The Kidneys**
The kidneys’ palace is the *Xuan Yin* garden,
Within sits a youth, *Ming Shang Xuan*, in silent reverie.
He commands the six *fu* and nine *ye* sources,
Externally manifesting in ears—fluid essence refined.

In somber brocade and clouded robes, he dances with the Dragon *Pan*,
Ascending to the *De*’s mist, the sun’s celestial glow.
A hundred ailments, a thousand calamities—urgently preserve him,
For the two *Water Kings* stand guard at the *Gate of Life*,
Granting eternal life and ascent to the Nine Heavens.

**Chapter Thirteen: The Spleen**
The spleen’s domain belongs to the *Wu* and *Ji*,
Within sits the radiant youth in yellow robes.
He consumes grains, disperses *qi*, and fortifies the teeth,
Known as the *Tai Cang*’s twin luminous youths.
Seated in the *Golden Fusion City*, ninefold,
A square inch within the *Gate of Life*,
He regulates a hundred grains and five *Ju* aromas,
Warding off emaciation and sickness alike.
Externally manifesting in the *Chi*’s dwelling—fragrant vitality,
Illuminating brilliance that reveals itself.
In golden brocade and jade robes, he bears the Tiger’s sash,
Summoned in thought to the *San Laozi*—lightly soaring.
Long life and lofty immortals evade death’s reach.

**Chapter Fourteen: The Gallbladder**
The gallbladder’s palace holds the *Six Palaces* of essence,
Within sits the youth of resplendent might, radiant and clear.
With eightfold thunder and lightning, he raises the jade banner,
The Dragon’s flag spans the heavens, hurling fire and jade bells.
He governs all *qi*-forces, summoning the Tiger’s troops.
Externally manifesting between the *eye-youth* and *nose-pillar*,
Brain-hairs and vital *qi* mutually support each other, fresh and vivid.
In nine-hued brocade robes with emerald-green skirts,
Wearing the golden belt and jade Dragon-Tiger talisman,
He can preserve the *Chengming*—ascending on auspicious clouds,
Commanding ten thousand spirits to pay homage to the *San Yuan*—Three Primordials.

**Chapter Fifteen: The Inscription of the Spleen’s Length**
The spleen, a foot long, conceals the *Tai Cang*—Great Granary,
Within its core, the *Laozi* of the Middle refines the *Ming Tang*—Hall of Radiance.
Its *guè* character is *Ling Yuan*—Numinous Origin, named *Hun Kang*—Mystic Support.
It heals a hundred ailments, consumes grains and provisions.
In yellow robes and purple sashes, bearing the Dragon-Tiger talisman,
It sustains longevity and vitality, relying on the sovereign’s might.
Three invocations of its name, and the spirits respond in kind.
The Three Primordials sit together, each with their own retinue—
Some as essence, some as fetus, each holding their own method.
The *Peach Boy* and *Peach Girl* jointly extend the *Hua Mang*—Luminous Radiance.
Male and female spirits hover in *Peach Kang*—Peach’s Support.
The *Dao Father* and *Dao Mother* face each other in the *Dan Xuan*’s realm—Crimson Mysterium.
One may employ *cúnsì*—preserving thought to ascend the *Xūkōng*—Void Space.
Though paths diverge, they converge at the *Yào Zhōng*—Essential Terminus.
Sealing the Three Passes, grasping *Gù Tíng*—Solid Stillness,
Swallowing the *Golden Fusion* and engulfing the *Jade Flower*,
Thus attaining non-hunger, where the *Three Worms*—parasitic *qi*—perish.
Heart and mind perpetually harmonized, yielding joyous prosperity,
The clouds of the *Five Sacred Mountains*—*Wu Yue*—rise in *Peng Heng*—Abundant Vitality.
It guards the *Jade Pavilion*—*Yu Lu*—to repay itself,
The Five Forms complete and firm, free from calamity.

**Chapter Sixteen: The Upper Vision**
The Upper Vision of the Three Primordials resembles linked pearls,
Falling and rising, its luminous scene illuminates the Nine Corners.
The Five Spirits serve as night torches, blazing across the Eight Regions.
The *Child of Essence*—*Zi Cún*—dwells with the Inner Sovereign, and we wander together.
Clad in wind-garments, bearing the Tiger’s talisman,
A single visit suffices to soon ascend the *Xūwú*—Voidlessness.
Within the square inch, deep contemplation is stored,
Not square nor round—sealing the window and portal.
The Three Spirits return essence, the *Lao*—Primordial—becomes robust.
Soul and spirit are inwardly guarded, no longer contending.
Spirit is born in the abdomen, bearing the precious jade,
Vital *qi* flows to the *Yōu Què*—Mysterious Gate, and no loss occurs.
A million-league jade column may shelter and prop one up,
The Three Souls remain tranquil, the *Di Shū*—Imperial Decree—commands.

**Chapter Seventeen: The Numinous Platform**
The Numinous Platform looms dark, gazing upon the Yellow Wilds,
A three-inch chamber with upper and lower divisions.
Between the *Jian Què*—Interstices—stand the *Ying Wei*—Camp Guards*, lofty and mysterious.
The Purple Extremes’ chamber holds the *Ling Mén*—Spiritual Gate.
This was what the *Tai Shang*—Great On High—told me:
The Left Spirit Prince emits divine speech,
Beside him stands the White Primordial, aligned externally,
The Hall of Radiance’s golden box and jade chamber within.
The *Shang Qing*—Upper Clarity—stands before me,
In yellow robes, the *Zi Dan*—Child of the Elixir—frequently exhales *qi*.
Asking where he resides at the brow’s twin peaks,
The Inner Sojourn lists the *Sun and Moon*—*Ri Yue*—and the *hosts*—*Xiù*—in order,
The Seven Luminaries and Nine Primordials crowned at the *Sheng Mén*—Life Gate.

**Chapter Eighteen: The Three Passes**
Within the Three Passes, essence-*qi* runs deep,
In the Nine Microcosms, it is dark and hidden.
The mouth is the *Heavenly Pass*—*Tiān Guān*—where spirit-*qi* is activated,
The feet are the *Earthly Pass*—*Dì Guān*—where life-*qi* is dispersed,
The hands are the *Human Pass*—*Rén Guān*—holding prosperity and decline.

**Chapter Nineteen: The Chapter of Attainment**
If one attains the Three Officials preserving the *Xuan Dan*—Mysterious Elixir,
The *Tai Yi*—Great Unity—flows its pearls to stabilize *Kun Lun*—the Primordial Mountain,
Layer upon layer of pavilions, twelvefold encircled,
Ascending and descending, all are *True Persons*—*Zhēnrén_.
The Jade Hall deciphers the *Yè*—script—of all Mysterious Officials,
The *Xuan Ji*—Suspended Pivot—and *Huáng*—Balance—scales the *Lán*—Blue—*Jian*—Smiting.
Gazing upon the youth seated in the revolving plate,
Asking, “Which child is in my body?”
This person may depart and enter the *Ní Lóng*—Mud Dragon,
Thousand upon thousand, self-linking in endless chains,
One by one, ten by ten, like piled mountains.
The *Yun Yí*—Cloud Form—of Five Auspicious Ones sojourns at the *Ear Gate*—*Ěr Mén_,
The *Red Sovereign*—*Chì Dì_—and *Yellow Lao*—*Huáng Lǎo_ share my soul.
The Three True Ones flank the *Xū*—Void—*Shū*—Support—together at the *Fáng Jīn*—Chamber of Essence.
The Five *Dou*—Luminous Beings—illuminate the Seven Primordials,
Sun and Moon fly through the *Six Harmonies*—*Liù Hé_.
The Sovereign’s Domain is at the *Heavenly Center*—*Tiān Zhōng_—and the *Earthly Portal*—*Dì Hù_,
The face’s soul-spirit eternally intertwined, mutually preserved.

**Chapter Twenty: The Breathing**
Breathing the Primordial *qi* to seek the Dao,
The Daoist Prince and Spirit Youth may now approach.
The *Zhū Niǎo*—Vermilion Bird—exhales and contracts from the *Bái Shí*—White Stone—source,
Condensing essence to nurture the fetus, transforming the body.
Retaining the fetus and halting essence, one attains longevity,
The Three *Qi*—*Sān Qì_—hover rightward, the Nine Dao illuminated.
The *Zhēng Yī*—Upright One—contains the *Hua*—Flower—of perfection.
Gazing afar, the mind is like the *Luó Xīng*—Pleiades Cluster.
Beneath the Golden Chamber, it may not topple,
Extending my white hair, returning to infancy.

**Chapter Twenty-One: The Jade Chamber**
Within the Jade Chamber, the *Tai Sù*—Great Purity—converges,
The *Ní Jiǔ*—Mud Nine—*Furen*—Ladies—stand in its midst.
The *Cháng Gǔ*—Long Valley—of Mysterious Dao encircles the suburbs,
The Six Dragons scatter and fly, scarcely distinguishable.
The path to longevity is most cautious within the *Chamber*—*Fáng Zhōng_—urgent.
Why die? Let the spirits weep in vain.
Suddenly, calamity strikes the Three Spirits.
But one must inhale *qi* and record the *Child of Essence*—*Zi Jing_,
Within the *inch-field*—*Cùn Tián_—and *foot-dwelling*—*Chǐ Zhái_—to govern life.
If one were to drain the *Sea*—*Dà Hǎi_—in a hundred readings,
The leaves fall, the tree withers, losing its verdant green.
When *qi* is lost and fluids leak, it is no longer my form.
Sealing and guarding the *Jing*—Effulgence—achieves lasting tranquility,
Preserving the *Ní Lóng*—Mud Dragon—with its Three Auspicious Spirits,
Serene and detached, closing the gaze inwardly illuminates itself.
Things do not interfere, the *Great Peace*—*Tài Píng_—prevails.
Cautious indeed, the *Lǎo*—Primordial—becomes robust once more.
Contemplating the *Jade Text*—*Yù Shū_—of the *Tai Shang*—Great On High—Clarity.

**Chapter Twenty-Two: The Constant Contemplation**
Constantly contemplating the Three Chambers, they become interconnected.
Piercing vision reveals no inner or outer distinction,
Preserving and rinsing the Five Teeth brings no hunger or thirst.
The *Spirit-Effulgence*—*Shén Huá_—holds the towel, the Six Primordials pay homage.
Urgent guarding of the *Essence Chamber*—*Jīng Shì_—must not be recklessly drained,
Sealing and treasuring it ensures longevity.
Rising from the body’s core, initially not broad,
The Three Officials are near, easily hidden and grasped.
The Void is empty and silent, a natural essence within,
The form must not be sullied.
The Nine Chambers are upright and void, the *Spirit Abode*—*Shén Míng Shè_—is pure.
Preserving thought in a hundred contemplations, observing the nodes,
The Six Palaces are refined, not left as they were.
Thus, one soars freely, entering the *Heavenly Path*—*Tiān Lù_.

**The Three Spirits’ Joy (Chapter Twenty-Four)**
The Three Spirits’ delight lies in seclusion’s shade,
Swiftly roaming, free from all care’s weight.
Feathered robes arrayed, the Eight Winds obey,
Guiding the Three Pure to ride the dawn’s glow.
Golden carriage stands, the Jade Carriage follows—
Why not climb the peaks and chant my scroll?
Darkly brooding, the True Person’s realm,
Entering the mountains—what difficulty?
Yet hesitation lingers, though the path is clear.

**The Five Phases (Chapter Twenty-Five)**
The Five Phases cycle, yet return to One,
Three-Five merge their qi, the Nine-Nine’s tune.
Hidden arts may turn the Eightfold Way,
The Ox of Darkness veiled in mystic array.
The Three Luminaries bloom at life’s edge,
The Celestial Chamber’s spirit mirrors sun and moon.
Father is the Mud Ball, Mother the Yin One,
The Three Lights radiant enter the Son’s Hall.
Preserve the Mysterious True—all else is done,
One spirit’s essence must not be undone.

**The Lofty Flight (Chapter Twenty-Six)**
Loftier than sun and moon, the Dao ascends,
Idyllic Compliance glows with radiant ends.
The Jade Pure Elder of the Void appears,
To reverse the years, to fill the brain’s veins.
Mouth holds the Spirit-Beam, the Five Sovereigns near,
A Tiger’s Seal at waist, the Golden Bell to bear.
Swiftly summoned, life’s feast at Eastern Mong,
Where the True Person’s path is clear and strong.

**The Primordial One (Chapter Twenty-Seven)**
The Primordial One refines the soul’s arc,
One thing vast—its might is plain to see.
Only the Utmost True may turn to gaze,
Forbidden: death’s miasma, all that’s base.
The Six Spirits gather in the Void’s embrace,
Pearls formed, essence sealed, the Spirit-root’s grace.
Jade Spoon and Golden Key ever firm,
Tongue curled back, the Fetal Essence sipped—
Thus I attain the craft, the Flying Sage’s gift.

**The Sage’s Path (Chapter Twenty-Eight)**
Sages and Daoists hold no godly might,
Accumulated essence, qi—this is their right.
The Yellow Boy’s melody, rare to hear,
Jade scrolls and crimson boats with secrets clear.
The True Person’s cap—golden, bright,
Shouldering armor, holding talismans right,
Opening the Seven Gates with fire’s might.
Soldiers of flame guard the Spirit’s way,
Forebearing, lowly, ranks arrayed.
Sword a hundred paces, silken banners swayed,
Ten Absolutes spin through empty space,
Fire-bells tolling, smoke and mist’s embrace.
Where is this Yellow Gate ‘twixt brows so wide?
Not branch or leaf—this is the root’s pride.

**The Purple Clarity (Chapter Twenty-Nine)**
The Purple Clarity’s Sovereign, Dao’s Lord,
Great Mysterious, Great Harmony’s guard.
Transforming all things, making me divine,
Ascending ten heavens on the Jade Wheel’s shine.
Day and night, seven days—sleep not at all,
If you can walk this path, you’ll live to fall.
Crafted virtue, not by nature’s hand,
From sincerity, from focus, from command.
Within, firm and true, the True’s own core,
Silent stillness—spirit’s natural store.

**The Hundred Grains (Chapter Thirty)**
The Hundred Grains’ fruit—earth’s vital seed,
Five flavors’ allure, yet demons feed.
Stench confuses the spirit, wastes the Fetal Breath,
How then return to youth? To infancy’s death?
The Three Souls scatter, the Spirit’s frame decays—
Why not eat the Qi, the Heavenly’s rays?
Thus one never dies—Great Yellow’s peace.

**The Heart’s Canon (Chapter Thirty-One)**
The Heart’s Canon—one body, Five Visceral Kings,
Movement and stillness, virtue’s moral strings.
Pure and bright, the good qi shines its light,
Rising or seated, both sustain the might.
Day’s sun, night’s moon—when shadows close,
Circulate the Flowered Essence, balance yin and woe.

**The Celestial Passage (Chapter Thirty-Two)**
The Celestial Passage hides the Ox and Rooster’s hour,
The Two Kidneys’ spirits guard life’s long power.
Descending to the Dipper’s first bright star,
Knowing the Male, guarding the Female—no aging near.
Knowing White, seeing Black—sit firm and clear.

**The Liver’s Qi (Chapter Thirty-Three)**
The Liver’s Qi surges, clear and long,
Arrayed in Six Palaces, the Three Lights’ song.
Heart’s essence focused, inner balance kept,
Above the Three Burners, below the Jade Elixir’s wept.
Mysterious Liquids drift, fragrant, deep,
Healing the teeth, refining the square’s step.
Drawing the津 from the Mysterious Store,
Pouring down the throat—spirit’s path is sure.
Sitting beneath the Flowered Canopy’s grace,
Floating through the Three Emperors’ cool place,
Five-colored clouds in emerald array,
Eyes closed within—self-reflecting gaze.
Thus the Heart’s spirits all in reverence rise,
Seven Mysteries bloom at the Commanding Door,
Circulating Heaven’s Way, preserving the Root’s force,
A hundred twenty years—yet more to course.
Beyond this, guarding the Dao is hard indeed,
Only the Nine Transformations enter the Jade Elixir’s seed.
Reflect on essence, store the Seven Primordials’ might,
Sun and moon’s radiance saves the old and blighted.
The Liver’s Qi flows—its cycle’s end is sighted.

**The Lung’s Chapter (Chapter Thirty-Four)**
The Lung’s Qi arises from the Three Burners’ flame,
Gazing, listening—darkness, the Boy’s claim.
Adjusting the Five Floras, teeth and hair grow bright,
Thirty-six swallows in the Jade Pool’s light.
Opening the Hundred Vessels, blood and fluids flow,
Complexion gleams like gold, the jade’s own glow.
Teeth firm, hair black—no trace of white,
Preserve this True Spirit, lest it take flight.
Remember this Official has its place,
All spirits gather, turning in their chase.

**Hiding Myself (Chapter Thirty-Five)**
Hiding beneath the Feathered Canopy’s shade,
Morning worships the Sun with joyous parade.
The Eight Powers of the Bright Spirit repel the foul,
The Spleen-Spirit returns to the Stomach’s hall.
Nurturing the Spirit-Root, it withers not,
Sealing the Commanding Door, the Jade Metropolis’s lot.
Ten thousand spirits feast—longevity’s store,
This is the Spleen’s foundation, central core.
The Five Visceral Organs, Six Bowels’ kings,
Above the Heaven’s Gate, the Great Bright Hall’s wings.
Guarding the Female, storing the Male, the Three Lights’ crown,
Square without, round within—the Spirit’s throne.
Circulating blood and vessels, the Five Visceral’s might,
Blue bones, red sinews, marrow like the frost’s white.
The Spleen rescues the Seven Orifices’ fate,
Sun and moon aligned—yin’s harmonious state.
The Two Spirits meet, transforming Jade Elixir’s glow,
Tasteless, flavorless—Heaven’s and Man’s own food.
The Son’s Elixir served, the Yellow’s pure,
Called the Lingao, the Jade Frost’s cure.
The Supreme Hidden Ring, the Supreme Substance’s pearl,
Watering the Eight Fluids, the Kidneys’ store.
Lodged in Great Yin, my form is shown,
Raising the Three Mysteries, the Azure’s dawn.
Flickering between—pure spirit’s grace,
Seated on the Whirlwind Platform, the Red’s birthplace.
The Free Domain’s radiance, True Nourishment’s art,
Inner gazing, silent—refining the Five Forms’ heart.
The Three Qi’s wandering brings the Spirit’s light,
Hidden Dragon, Fleeing Charm, Cloud-Lan’s bright.
This can sate the hungry, feed the myriad souls,
Above the Supreme Mysteries, the Tiger’s scrolls.

**The Middle Scripture (Second Section)**
*Cultivate in ease, dwell in solitude,*
*Nurture nature, guard the void within.*
*Serene and undisturbed—what need for thought or care?*
*The wings are now complete, the branches stand upright.*

*Longevity seen, then the flight begins,*
*The Five Phases intertwined, their roots one.*
*The Three Five *qi* unite—its origin is singular,*
*Who shall share this with the sun and moon?*

*Embrace the Jade, cherish the Pearl in the Inner Chamber,*
*If you can guard the One, all things are fulfilled.*
*Hold your own—nothing will be lost,*
*Enter the Golden Chamber to seek non-death.*

*The Great Month and the Little Month are my Dao,*
*Heaven’s Seven, Earth’s Three—guard them in return.*
*Ascend and descend, advance and retreat—harmonize to endure,*
*The falling of jade and stone are my treasures.*

*What do you have? Why not guard it well?*
*The mind knows the roots—nurture the five hues’ bloom.*
*Follow Heaven, align with Earth—conceal the *jing*.*
*Five openings in the Seven Orifices must harmonize,*
*On Kunlun’s heights, no wandering nor error.*

*On the Nine Springs’ mountain, how grand it stands,*
*Within, the True Person may command.*
*Covered by the Purple Official’s boat, the city’s towers,*
*Illuminated by sun and moon like bright pearls.*

*Ten thousand years shine clear—no end in sight,*
*The Outer Roots are the Three *Yang*—from them all things arise,*
*The Inner Bonds are the Three Spirits—longevity is theirs.*

*The Soul seeks Heaven, the Shadow enters the depths,*
*Returning the Soul, the Shadow—*Dao*’s natural law.*
*Bind the Pearl, fortify the Spirit Root with Jade,*
*The Golden Spoon and Key preserve the body’s firmness.*

*Carrying Earth, suspending Heaven, circling the Dry and Wet,*
*Mirrored in the Four Seasons, red as the boat.*
*Forward bowing, backward low—arranged at the gate,*
*Select the Elixir of Return or the Obscure Spring’s waters.*

*Like the Tortoise, draw *qi*—awaken the Spirit Root,*
*Within, the True Person wears the Golden Headband,*
*Clad in armor, holding talismans, opening the Seven Gates,*
*This is not the leaf—it is the root.*

*Day and night, forbear from this—life will endure,*
*The Immortals’ created Scholars are no different,*
*Accumulating *jing* leads to harmony and pure benevolence.*

*All men eat grain and the Five Flavors,*
*But I alone consume the Great Harmony’s *yin-yang qi*.*
*Thus I do not die—Heaven’s favor is granted.*

*Now speak of the Five Organs, each with its method,*
*The Heart is the sovereign, the Five Organs’ king.*
*Receiving intentions, active or still, *qi* flows to act,*
*The Dao itself leads my spirit’s radiant light.*

*Bright by day, guarded by night,*
*Thirst brings the drink, hunger is sated.*
*Pass through the Six Palaces—store at *zi* and *you*—*
*Regulate my *jing* and *qi*—balance *yin* and *yang*.*

*Turn *yang* to *yin*, conceal it in the Nine,*
*If you can practice this, your ears will not grow old.*
*The Liver’s *qi*—cultivate to make it long,*
*Arranged in order, the Five Organs master the Three Lights.*

*Above, the Three Burners merge; below, the Jade Nectar flows,*
*My Nine Spirits and Six Shadows dwell in the center,*
*The *jing* and fluids flow like a spring—nose’s fragrance arises,*
*Standing at the Obscure Back, containing the Bright Hall.*

*Thunder and lightning crash—echoes resound,*
*Left *you*, right *zi*—my chamber stands.*

「Chapter Three of the Lower Section
*Lie hidden at the志门 (Zhìmén, "Will Gate"), awaiting the Dao of Heaven,*
*Near at hand in the body’s *zi* (子, "Water Branch"), yet still self-guarded.*

*In stillness and quietude, the spirit abides without action,*
*Its radiant light divides, ascending and descending with clarity.*
*The *jing* (精, "essence") awaits the Dao of Heaven—eternal life’s grass grows,*
*When the seven orifices open, age is unknown.*

*Return and sit at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting *yin* and *yang*,
*Descend to the throat—spirit’s light flows through.*
*Pass beneath the华盖 (Huágài, "Flowering Canopy") to find purity and coolness,*

*To command the Nine Spirits to open the命门 (Mìngmén, "Life Gate").*
*Unlock the Dao of Heaven, preserving the灵根 (Línggēn, "Spiritual Root").*
*Yin and yang arranged like falling stars,*
*The Liver’s *qi* circulates endlessly.*

*The Lung’s *qi*—from the三焦 (Sānjiāo, "Three Burners")—rises,*
*Sitting at Heaven’s Gate, awaiting the Way’s path.*
*Saliva and fluids flow like醴泉 (Lìyuán, "Jade Nectar Spring") through the Six Palaces,*
*Ascending and descending through the nose, the two ears open wide.*
*Peering at Heaven and Earth, preserving the童子 (Tóngzǐ, "Child Spirit"),*
*Refining the essence, nurturing hair and teeth—*
*Complexion radiant, luster bright, no return to whiteness.*

*Descend to the throat—how serene!*
*The Nine Spirits gather, seeking one another.*
*Enter the大绛宫 (Dàjiànggōng, "Great Purple Palace"), where紫华 (Zǐhuá, "Purple Flower") is concealed,*

*Focus the mind and spirit, turning to mutual invocation,*
*Behold my radiant light, banishing all malevolence.*
*The脾神 (Píshén, "Spleen Spirit") returns, relying upon the大家 (Jiā, "Great House").*
*Reaching the胃管 (Wèiguǎn, "Stomach Passage"), it flows without obstruction,*
*Nurturing the灵根 (Línggēn) so it never withers,*
*Sealing the命门 (Mìngmén) like玉都 (Yùdū, "Jade Capital").*
*Longevity extends to万岁 (Wànsuì, "Ten Thousand Years"), with years yet remaining.*

*The spirit within the脾 (Spleen) governs the中官 (Zhōngguān, "Central Official"),*
*Morning assemblies with the Five Organs, aligning the Three Lights.*
*Above, it merges with Heaven’s Gate and the Bright Hall,*
*Flowing through the Six Palaces, harmonizing the Five Elements—*
*Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth reign supreme.*
*Regulating the止脉 (Zhǐmài, "Stopped Pulse") and sweat as nourishment,*
*Refining the seven orifices, dispelling all ill fortune,*
*The two spirits attend, transforming into玉英 (Yùyīng, "Jade Flower").*
*Ascending to Heaven’s *qi*, my life’s vitality grows ever longer.*

*The sun and moon arranged, expanding *yin* and *yang*,
*The Five Organs’ sovereign is the kidney—most refined.*
*Resting in the太阴 (Tàiyīn, "Great Yin"), my form is perfected,*
*Entering and exiting the二窍 (Èrqiào, "Two Orifices"), merging with the黄庭 (Huángtíng, "Yellow Hall").*

*Breathing the void, my form is revealed,*
*Strengthening sinews, bones, blood, and vessels.*
*Faintly, I pass unseen through the青灵 (Qīnglíng, "Blue Spirit"),*
*Sitting beneath the通庐 (Tōnglú), with a few small童子 (Tóngzǐ).*

*Within, I store my thoughts—spirit’s light remains,*
*Emerging from Heaven’s Gate, without pause or idle breath.*
*Serene and undisturbed, desireless, I nurture the华茎 (Huájìng, "Flowering Stem"),*
*Consuming the玄气 (Xuángì, "Mysterious Breath"), eternal life is achieved.*

*Returning through the七门 (Qīmén, "Seven Gates"), drink from the太渊 (Tàiyuān, "Great Abyss"),*
*Flowing through my悬膺 (Xuányīng, "Suspended Breastplate"), past the青灵 (Qīnglíng),*
*Sitting between the膺 (Yīng, "Breastplate"), I see the small童子 (Tóngzǐ).*
*I question the仙迂 (Xiānyǔ, "Immortal Circuitousness") about奇方 (Qífāng, "Marvelous Methods"),*
*Consuming芝草 (Zhīcǎo, "Mushroom Grass") and玉英 (Yùyīng, "Jade Flower").*
*Head adorned with白素 (Báisù, "White Purity"), feet rooted in the丹田 (Dāntián),*
*Bathing in the华池 (Huápíng), the灵根 (Línggēn) is born anew.*
*The Three Palaces unite, unlocking the命门 (Mìngmén);*
*The Five Flavors all arrive—virtuous *qi* returns,*
*Loosening my hair and setting forth, I may endure forever.*

*The Great Dao vast and boundless—mind, do not be troubled,*
*My words are complete—do not transmit them recklessly.*

**The Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Embryonic Breath**
*The Jade Emperor, Heaven’s Sovereign, says:*
*The embryo forms from hidden breath,*
*The breath arises from the embryo’s presence.*

*Breath enters the body—this is called life,*
*The spirit departs, leaving form—this is called death.*
*Knowing the spirit and breath,*
*One may attain eternal life.*

*Thus, guard the void,*
*To nurture the spirit and breath.*
*The spirit moves, the breath moves,*
*The spirit abides, the breath abides.*

*If you seek eternal life,*
*Let spirit and breath intermingle.*
*The heart undisturbed, no thoughts arise,*
*Neither coming nor going,*
*Neither exiting nor entering—*
*The spirit abides naturally.*

*Diligently practice this,*
*And you walk the true Dao.*
