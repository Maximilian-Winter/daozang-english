# 道德经（唐易州龙兴观道德经碑本）

**"The Dao De Jing: The Tang-Era Easy State Dragon Thriving Temple Dao De Jing Stele Edition**

Qian Da-xin remarked: *"Examining the He Shang Gong annotated edition, the section beginning with ‘The Dao that can be spoken’ constitutes the Dao Jing (Upper Scroll), while the section beginning with ‘The highest virtue is non-action’ forms the De Jing (Lower Scroll)."*

Zhao Shuo, in his postscript to Wang Bi’s commentary, stated that Wang did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, thus preserving a form closer to the ancient text. Yet, Lu De-ming’s *Shuowen Jiezi* explicitly follows the Fu Si edition, titling it *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)*, identical to the He Shang Gong edition. Zhao’s claim that his version was closer to antiquity was likely based on a Song-dynasty transcription, without further verification.

In my private collection, there are five stone-carved editions of the *Dao De Jing*, among which only the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s annotated edition and this one divide the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*—a structure consistent with Han and Wei-era chapter divisions. This edition, carved in early Tang, differs significantly in phrasing from other versions. For instance:
- *"Wu"* (無) is rendered as *"Wu"* (無),
- *"Yu"* (愈) as *"Yu"* (俞),
- *"Yun"* (芸) as *"Yun"* (云),
- *"Yu"* (誉) as *"Yu"* (豫),
- *"Huang"* (荒) as *"Mang"* (忙),
- *"Zuo"* (佐) as *"Zuo"* (作),
- *"■"* (an obscure character) as *"Xi"* (翕).

Further, where the text reads *"Thus, it can conceal without renewal, achieving completion,"* the stele version states: *"Thus, it can conceal and return to completion."* Beneath *"Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow,"* the stele omits the lines *"After a great army passes, there will surely be years of calamity."* Below *"The High General takes the right,"* the stele lacks the phrase *"Speak to them with funeral rites."* In the passage *"Only when one is sick of sickness does one not fall ill; the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness,"* the stele simplifies it to: *"Thus, the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness."*

Such variations far surpass other editions, and I cite only a few examples to illustrate the value of ancient stone inscriptions.

Wu Yi remarked that dividing the *Laozi* into *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)* aligns with ancient editions.

Later, Lu You’s postscript noted: *"Zhao claimed that Wang Fu-si’s *Laozi* did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, saying it was closer to antiquity. Yet this edition has long been divided."* Thus, the Song dynasty had already lost Fu Si’s definitive text. Proof lies in Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* citation of the *Laozi De Jing*: *"The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes."*

Yet further examination of *Han Shu* annotations reveals:
- In the *Wei Bo* transmission, Yan Shigu cites the *Laozi Dao Jing*: *"When a state is in chaos, loyal ministers arise."*
- In the *Tian Heng* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *"The noble relies on the lowly as foundation; the exalted relies on the humble as base—thus, lords and kings call themselves ‘orphaned, widowed, and unworthy.’"*
- In the *Chu Yuanwang* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace."*
- In the *Yan Zhu* transmission, he notes: *"This is what the *Laozi* says: ‘Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow.’"* Yan Shigu comments: *"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*."*
- In the *Yang Xiong* transmission, citing *"Few know me, yet I am noble,"* Yan Shigu states: *"The *Laozi De Jing* says: ‘Few know me, yet I am noble.’"*
- In the *Cruel Officials* transmission, the *Laozi* states: *"The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue; the lowest virtue clings to virtue, thus it lacks virtue. When laws proliferate, thieves multiply."* Yan Shigu remarks: *"This is from the *De Jing* of the *Laozi*."*
- For *"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs,"* he notes: *"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*."*

In the *Western Regions* transmission’s annotation, it cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *"When the world follows the Dao, horses are led backward to manure."* Clearly, the sources that distinguish *Dao* and *De* in their citations align with the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s *"Dao Jing Audio and Meaning"* and *"De Jing Audio and Meaning."*

Additionally, Jia Gongyan’s *Zhou Li Shi Shi* commentary asserts: *"The *Laozi Dao Jing* states: ‘The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.’"* Below, he notes: *"The *De Jing* states: ‘The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue.’"*

Zhang Huai’s *Hou Han Shu* annotation, in the *Zhi □* transmission, claims: *"The *Laozi Dao Jing* says: ‘Fish cannot escape the spring.’"*

These scholars, in early Tang, uniformly attested to this division. (The *Dream True Guest Stele* also states: *"Examining the *Dao Jing*, compassion is the treasure."*) Such divisions must have originated from Jin and Song-era editions, as evidenced by this stele’s titles, which are well-founded.

Wang Kang remarked: *"The upper scroll is titled *Laozi Dao Jing*, and the lower *Laozi De Jing*, clearly distinguishing *Dao* and *De* without merging them. Thus, Xuanzong’s annotations truly follow this ancient structure."*

Dong Jiong’s *Collected Books Record* incorrectly states: *"After Xuanzong’s annotations were completed, the text was standardized as the *Dao De Jing*, grouping all references to *Dao* in the upper scroll and *De* in the lower."* This is incorrect.

Wu Yun noted: *"The *Sui Shu Jing Ji Zhi* records the *Dao De Jing* in two volumes with Wang Bi’s commentary. Zhao Shuo and Xiong Ke-zhong’s postscripts both claim it was not divided into *Dao De Jing*, yet the current *Shuowen Jiezi* edition is split into two scrolls, leading some to suspect later carvers inserted divisions. However, Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* cites the *Laozi De Jing*: ‘The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes,’ and Yan Shigu’s *Han Shu* annotations frequently cite the *Laozi Dao Jing* and *De Jing* separately. Thus, the division predates Lu De-ming. This stele’s *De Jing* division is well-justified."*

Sun Yi-ran stated: *"The *Laozi* consists of eighty-one chapters divided into upper and lower scrolls, titled *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*. The He Shang Gong edition, the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s recorded Wang Bi edition, the Daoist Canon’s Tang Fu Yi annotated edition, and the stone-carved Tang Xuanzong annotated edition all follow this structure."*

The *Hongming Ji* in its *Mouzi Lihuo Lun* states: *"The reasoning is correct in its thirty-seven articles, and it also follows the Daoist teachings of Laozi’s thirty-seven chapters of the *Dao Jing*."* Thus, during the Han dynasty, this book was already divided into the *Dao Jing* (thirty-seven chapters) and *De Jing* (forty-four chapters), matching the structure of the current edition.

The extant *Wang Bi* annotations, however, derive from the Song dynasty edition as collated by Chao Shao, which does not split the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*. Though this may be logically coherent, it does not reflect the original Han or Tang editions.

**Laozi Dao Jing**
**Chapter 1**
The Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
Non-naming is the origin of Heaven and Earth;
Naming is the mother of myriad things.
Ever non-being, one seeks to observe its mystery;
Ever being, one seeks to observe its peril.
These two emerge together yet bear different names—
Both are called the *Xuan* (profound).
The *Xuan* that is yet again *Xuan*—
This is the gate of all mysteries.

**Chapter 2**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness already exists;
When all know goodness as goodness, evil already exists.
Thus being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short define each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Sound and voice harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
Therefore, the Sage acts in non-action,
Teaches without speech.
Myriad things thereby arise and do not resist,
Are born and not possessed,
Are achieved and not claimed,
Succeed and not dwelled upon.
It is only because he does not dwell upon them
That they do not depart from him.

**Chapter 3**
Do not exalt the virtuous,
Thus the people do not contend;

「Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods,
Thus the people do not steal;
Do not display what is desirable,
Thus the heart does not become disordered.

The Sage governs by:
Emptying their heart,
Filling their belly,
Weakening their will,
Strengthening their bones.
Ever keep the people in ignorance and free from desire,
Make the wise dare not act,
Then there will be nothing left to govern.

**Chapter 4**
The Dao is boundless,
Yet its use endures without exhaustion.
How profound!
All things take it as their origin.
It blunts the sharp,
Unravels the tangled,
Mellows the glaring,
Aligns with the dusty.
Deeply abiding, ever present—
I do not know whose child it is.
It precedes the Sovereign of the Yellow Court.

**Chapter 5**
Heaven and Earth are not kind;
They treat all things as straw dogs.
The Sage is not kind;
They too treat the people as straw dogs.
Between Heaven and Earth—
It is like a bellows.
Empty yet never exhausted,
Pushed yet never rigid.
Much speech leads to exhaustion,
Better to guard the center.

**Chapter 6**
The Valley Spirit does not die—
This is called the Mysterious Female.
The gate of the Mysterious Female—
The root of Heaven and Earth.
Endlessly, as if present,
Used yet never exhausted.

**Chapter 7**
Heaven is long, Earth is enduring.
Heaven and Earth endure long because
They do not seek to live for themselves,
Thus they endure long.
Therefore the Sage puts themselves last,
Yet they are first;
They abandon themselves,
Yet they are preserved.
Because they have no selfishness,
They achieve their own ends.

**Chapter 8**
The highest virtue resembles water.
Water benefits all things yet does not contend.
It dwells where others disdain to be,
Thus it approaches the Dao.
Residing in good ground,
Heart deep and still,
Associating with good people,
Speaking with trustworthiness,
Governing with skill,
Acting with competence,
Moving with timing—
Because it does not contend,
It incurs no blame.

**Chapter 9**
To grasp and fill is not as good as stopping in time.
To shape and sharpen is not as good as knowing when to cease.
Gold and jade fill the hall,
Yet none can keep them.
Rich and noble yet arrogant,
They bring ruin upon themselves.
When achievement is complete and fame is secured,
Withdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.

**Chapter 10**
Nurturing the vital essence, embracing unity,
Can one avoid separation?
Focusing the qi, attaining softness,
Can one return to infancy?
Purifying and clarifying, gazing into the profound,
Can one avoid flaws?
Loving the people, governing the state,
Can one act without doing?
Opening and closing the Heavenly Gate,
Can one become the receptive?
Illuminated and far-reaching,
Can one avoid knowing?
Nourishing yet not possessing,
Creating yet not relying,
Growing yet not dominating—
This is called the Mysterious Virtue.

**Chapter 11**
Thirty spokes converge at one hub,
Yet it is the empty space that makes the wheel useful.
Clay is shaped into vessels,
Yet it is the empty space that makes them useful.
Doors and windows are carved for rooms,
Yet it is the empty space that makes them useful.
What exists is useful,
What does not exist is also useful.

**Chapter 12**
The five colors blind the eye;»

The five tones make the ears deaf;
The five flavors make the palate insipid;
Galloping and hunting in the wilds make the heart frenzied;
Rare and coveted goods make conduct erratic.
Therefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.
Thus, he discards that and embraces this.

**Chapter 13**
Honor and disgrace—both cause alarm;
Treating great calamity as one’s own body—what does this mean?
What is meant by *honor and disgrace causing alarm*?
Disgrace is lowly—
To gain it is alarming,
To lose it is alarming—
This is called *honor and disgrace causing alarm*.
What is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?
It is because of my body that I have great calamity.
When I have no body, what calamity can I have?
Thus, to cherish the body above all under Heaven,
Is to be entrusted with all under Heaven;
To love ruling all under Heaven as one’s own body,
Is to be entrusted with all under Heaven.

**Chapter 14**
It cannot be seen—called *level* (Qi);
It cannot be heard—called *rare* (Xi);
It cannot be grasped—called *subtle* (Wei).
These three cannot be pursued or examined,
Thus they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
Below, it is not dark.
Boundless, it cannot be named—
Returning to nothingness.
This is called the *form of formlessness*,
The *image of imagelessness*—
This is called *dim and vague*.
Approach it, you see no head;
Follow it, you see no tail.
Holding the ancient Way,
To speak of those who now have it—
To know the ancient beginning,
This is called *the Way already*.

**Chapter 15**
The ancients who were skilled as *scholars* (shi)
Were subtle, mysterious, and profound—
So profound they could not be fathomed.
Because they could not be fathomed,
They forced themselves to appear thus:
Cautious as one crossing a winter river,
Fearful as one wary of neighbors,
Solemn as a guest,
Dissolving like ice about to melt,
Solid as uncarved wood,
Muddled as muddy water,
Vast as a valley.
How can muddy water be made clear?
Gradually, it settles.
How can stillness be made to move?
Gradually, it stirs.
How can life be nurtured?
Gradually, it grows.
Those who preserve this Way
Do not seek fullness.
Because they do not seek fullness,
They can be depleted and yet renew.

**Chapter 16**
Push emptiness to its utmost,
Guard stillness with steadfastness.
All things arise together—
I observe their return.
Things drift and drift,
Each returning to its root.
Returning to the root is called *stillness*;
Stillness is called *returning to life*;
Returning to life is called *constancy*;
Knowing constancy is called *clarity*.
Not knowing constancy,
One forgets to act—disaster.
Knowing constancy, one is tolerant;
Tolerance makes one fair;
Fairness makes one sovereign;
Sovereignty makes one heavenly;
Heavenliness aligns with the Dao;
The Dao endures eternally—
One’s life ends without peril.

**Chapter 17**
The Supreme Sage
Makes the lowly aware of his existence;

**Chapter 18**
Next, they are cherished and indulged;
Next, they are feared and scorned.
If trust is insufficient, there will be distrust!
Because of their reverence for words,
When deeds are accomplished and affairs succeed,
The people say, *"It happened naturally."*

**Chapter 19**
When the Great Dao declines,
There arises righteousness.
When wisdom and cunning emerge,
There arises great deceit.
When family bonds fracture,
There arises filial piety.
When the state is chaotic,
There arise loyal ministers.

**Chapter 20**
Abandon learning, and there will be no worries.
*"Yes" and "No"*—how far apart are they?
Good and evil—how far apart are they?
What people fear, one must not fail to fear.
The multitude bustles and rejoices,
As if feasting on the finest sacrificial meat,
As if ascending the spring platform.
My essence is yet unmanifest,
Like an infant not yet weaned.
Drifting, drifting, with nowhere to rest!
The multitude all have excess,
While I alone seem abandoned.
With my simple heart,
Pure and unadorned—
The common folk are bright and clear,
While I alone seem dim.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
While I alone am muddled and obscure.
My stillness is like the sea,
Floating without end.
The multitude all have purpose,
While I alone seem crude and vulgar.
I alone differ from others,
Yet I alone honor the Mother of the Way.

**Chapter 21**
The sage holds this vessel with ease,
Following only the Dao.
The Dao as a thing—
Only vague, only elusive.
Within vague and elusive, there is form;
Within form, there is substance.
Within profound obscurity, there is essence;
Its essence is most profound,
And within it, there is truth.
From ancient times to now,
Its name has never faded,
To observe all things.
How do I know all things are thus?
By this.

**Chapter 22**

**Chapter 23**
When bent, it remains whole;
When crooked, it stands straight;
When hollowed, it fills;
When worn, it renews;
When few, it gains;
When many, it falters.
Thus the sage, embracing Oneness,
Sets the pattern for all under Heaven.
Not self-illuminating, yet clear;
Not self-righteous, yet manifest;
Not self-praising, yet achieves;
Not self-glorifying, yet endures.
Only by not contending
Does one surpass all contention.
Was it not said of old:
*"When bent, it remains whole"*—
Was this mere empty speech?
Thus completion returns to its source.

**Chapter 24**
Speak little, act naturally.
A sudden gust does not last the morning,
A sudden rain does not last the day.
Why so?
Heaven and Earth.
Heaven and Earth cannot endure above,
How much less so mortals?
Thus those who act in accord with the Dao
Are nurtured by virtue;
Those in harmony with virtue
Are further nurtured by virtue;
Those in discord with virtue
Are abandoned by the Dao.
When trust is insufficient,
The untrustworthy arise.

**Chapter 25**
The striving do not endure;
The overreaching cannot proceed.
Self-illumination brings no clarity;
Self-righteousness brings no renown;
Self-praise yields no merit;
Self-glorification brings no longevity.
In the Way, it is called *"excess food, superfluous movement"*—
Some may detest it,
Thus those who embody the Dao
Find no place to dwell.

**Chapter 26**
There is a thing, indistinctly formed,
Born before Heaven and Earth.
Silent and void!
Standing alone, unchanging,
Circulating without weariness,
It may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.
I do not know its name—
I forcefully call it the *Dao*,
Forcefully name it *Great*.
Great means passing;
Passing means distant;
Distant means returning.
The Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
The Sovereign is great.
Within the four greats, the Sovereign holds one.
Humans follow Earth,
Earth follows Heaven,
Heaven follows the Dao,
The Dao follows *Naturalness*.

**Chapter 27**
Heavy is the root of light,
Stillness is the master of movement.
Thus the noble one, though journeying all day,
Never strays from his provisions.
Though adorned with splendor,
He dwells in serene detachment.
How then can the ruler of ten thousand chariots
Lighten himself over the world?
Lightness brings loss of ministers;
Movement brings loss of subjects.

The Way is good—
It leaves no tracks behind.
Good speech leaves no stuttering;
Good planning needs no calculations.
Good closure requires no locks to open;
Good binding needs no cords to untie.
Thus the sage always rescues people without abandoning them,
Always rescues things without discarding them.
This is called *Clinging to Clarity*.
The good are teachers for the ungood;
The ungood are resources for the good.
If one does not honor their teacher,
Does not cherish their resource,
Though they know the great confusion,
This is called *Essential Mystery*.

**Chapter 28**
Know the masculine, hold to the feminine—
This is the Way of the world.
The Way of the world, ever virtuous, never departs,
And returns to the infant.
Know the bright, hold to the dark—
This is the model for the world.
Ever steady, never erring,
And returns to the formless.
Know the honored, hold to the humble—
This is the valley of the world.
The valley of the world, ever sufficient,
And returns to the uncarved.

The uncarved scatters to become vessels;
The sage uses it for officials and leaders.
Thus great governance leaves no mark.

**Chapter 29**
If one would take the world and act upon it,
I see that it cannot be done.
The world is a divine vessel—
It cannot be acted upon.
To act upon it brings ruin;
To grasp it brings loss.
Things move or follow,
Breathe or exhale,
Are strong or weak,
Are joined or broken.
Thus the sage avoids excess,
Avoids extravagance,
Avoids extravagance.

**Chapter 30**
The ruler who governs by the Way
Does not use force to dominate the world.
His affairs return to their natural course:
Where his armies dwell, thorns and brambles grow.
Thus the good are content with their harvest,
And do not seek to dominate.
Content, yet not arrogant,
Content, yet not proud,
Content, yet not boastful,
Content, yet not self-sufficient—
This is content without domination.
Things that are male grow old,
And are called *Not the Way*.
Not the Way perishes early.

**Chapter 31**
Fine weapons are ominous instruments—
Men detest them,
So those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them.
The noble, at home, values the left;
In war, values the right.
Weapons are ominous instruments,
Not the tools of the noble.
Used only when unavoidable,
They are held with solemnity—
This is the highest.
To delight in them is not beautiful;
If one delights in them,
One takes pleasure in killing.
Those who take pleasure in killing
Cannot find joy in the world.
Thus auspicious matters are honored on the left,
Inauspicious matters on the right.
Hence the Left General commands the left,
The Right General commands the right.
When many are killed, one mourns with tears;
When victorious, one treats it with solemn rites.

**Chapter 32**
The Way is ever nameless.
The uncarved, though small, under Heaven
No one dares to serve as its minister.
If kings and lords could guard it,
All things would come of their own accord.
Heaven and Earth unite,
And send down sweet dew—
No one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.
When names are first established,
Heaven knows when to stop.
Knowing when to stop brings no danger.
The Way in the world
Is like valleys to rivers and seas.

**Chapter 33**
To know others is wisdom;
To know oneself is enlightenment.
To overcome others is strength;
To overcome oneself is power.
To know contentment is wealth.
To persist with resolve is will.
To abide in one’s place is endurance;
To die without perishing is longevity.

**Chapter 34**
The Great Way flows widely,
Yet people prefer its sides.
All things rely on it to live,
Yet it does not claim them.
It accomplishes without possessing,
Nurtures without dominating—
This may be called the Great.
Thus the sage never seeks to be great,
And so achieves true greatness.

**Chapter 35**
Grasp the great image—
The world turns toward it.
Turning toward it, yet unharmed,
It rests in peace and ease.
Delight and bait—
Passersby stop.
The Way emerges in speech,
Flavorless, insipid.
Looked at, not enough to see;
Listened to, not enough to hear.
Used, never exhausted—

**Chapter 36**
If one would gather it,
One must first let it expand;

**Chapter 36 (continued)**
If one would weaken it,
One must first make it strong;
If one would make it appear insufficient,
One must first let it flourish;
If one would take it away,
One must first give it.

This is called **subtle clarity** (微明).
The soft overcomes the hard,
The weak overcomes the strong.
Fish cannot be lifted from the depths,
A state possesses sharp tools—
One must not display them to others.

**Chapter 37**
The Dao is ever **non-action** (無為) yet nothing remains undone.
If lords and kings could uphold it,
All things would transform of their own accord.
When transformation begins and things take form,
I shall govern them with the **nameless simplicity** (無名之朴).
The **nameless simplicity**, too, shall not desire.
**Non-desire** with **stillness** (靜),
The world will return to its natural order.

**Chapter 38**
The **virtue/power** (德) of the highest **Dao/Way** (道) is not **virtue/power** (德).
And so it has **virtue/power** (德).
The **virtue/power** (德) of the lowest **Dao/Way** (道) does not lose **virtue/power** (德).
And so it has no **virtue/power** (德).
The highest **virtue/power** (仁) acts yet does not claim credit.
The highest **righteousness** (義) acts yet does claim credit.
The highest **rites** (禮) acts yet none respond.
And so it forces arms and insists.
Thus, when the **Dao/Way** (道) is lost, **virtue/power** (德) follows;
When **virtue/power** (德) is lost, **仁** (仁) follows;
When **仁** (仁) is lost, **righteousness** (義) follows;
When **righteousness** (義) is lost, **rites** (禮) follow.

**Rites** (禮) are the thin veneer of **loyalty and trustworthiness** (忠信),
Yet the beginning of disorder.
**Preconceived notions** (前識) are the adornment of the **Dao/Way** (道),
Yet the origin of folly.
Thus the **great person** (大丈夫) abides in its substance, not its adornment;
Resides in its truth, not its veneer.
Therefore, abandon the latter and embrace the former.

「If the **valleys** (谷) are not filled, they shall fear exhaustion;
If all things lack their source, they shall fear annihilation;
If the **sovereigns and kings** (侯王) lack **uprightness** (贞), they shall fear ruin.
Thus, the noble esteems the lowly as its foundation,
And the exalted takes the humble as its base.
Therefore, when the **sovereigns and kings** call themselves *"lonely"* (孤), *"widowed"* (寡), *"without wheels"* (不毂),
Is this not their taking the lowly as their foundation?

Thus, when a multitude of chariots is gathered, there is no single chariot.
They do not wish to gleam like jade, nor to clatter like stone.

---
**Chapter 40**
The **Dao/Way** moves through reversal,
The weak are its instrument.
Under heaven, all things arise from the **Having** (有),
Yet the **Having** arises from the **Non-Having** (无).

---
**Chapter 41**
The **superior person** (上士) hears the **Dao/Way** and diligently practices it;
The **middle person** (中士) hears the **Dao/Way** and holds it as if present, as if absent;
The **inferior person** (下士) hears the **Dao/Way** and laughs in derision.
If it is not laughed at, it is not the **Dao/Way**.

Thus, the **profound statement** (建言) says:
To illuminate the **Dao/Way** is like obscurity,
To advance the **Dao/Way** is like retreat,
To smooth the **Dao/Way** is like disorder,
The highest **virtue/power** (德) is like a **valley** (谷),
The greatest whiteness is like a stain,
The most expansive **virtue/power** is like insufficiency,
To establish **virtue/power** is like theft,
To preserve sincerity is like deception,
The greatest square has no corners,
The greatest vessel is fashioned late,
The greatest sound is faint,
The greatest form is shapeless.
The **Dao/Way** is hidden, nameless.

Only the **Dao/Way**—
Generous in lending, yet generous in repaying.

---
**Chapter 42**
The **Dao/Way** gives birth to **Oneness** (一),
**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two** (二),
The **Two** gives birth to the **Three** (三),
The **Three** gives birth to all things.
All things bear the **yin** and embrace the **yang**,
And through **harmonizing qi** (冲气) achieve balance.
What people detest are *"lonely"* (孤), *"widowed"* (寡), *"without wheels"* (不毂),
Yet the **kings and nobles** (王公) take them as their titles.
Thus, some things are diminished to benefit,
Others are increased to harm.
What people teach, I also teach:
The strong and violent shall not meet a proper end—
I shall take this as my lesson.

---
**Chapter 43**
Under heaven, the most **yielding** (柔) overcomes the most **unyielding** (坚).
That which has no substance enters where there is no reputation.
Thus, one knows the benefit of **non-action** (无为).
Teaching without words, benefiting through **non-action**—
Few under heaven can attain this.

---
**Chapter 44**
**Names** (名) and **substance** (身) become intimately familiar...

「身与货熟多？
**Wealth and body grow intimately familiar—how much more so?**

得与亡熟病？
**Gain and loss become well-acquainted—how much more so?**

是故甚爱必大费，多藏必厚亡。
**Thus, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure;
The more one hoards, the heavier the loss.**

故知足不辱，知止不殆，
**Therefore, one who knows contentment suffers no humiliation,
One who knows restraint faces no peril,**

可以长久。
**And may endure forever.**

**Chapter 45**
The **greatly accomplished** (大成) seems incomplete—
Yet its use is **unexhausted** (不弊).
The **greatly full** (大盈) seems overflowing—
Yet its use is **unending** (不穷).
The **greatly upright** (大直) seems bent—
The **greatly skillful** (大巧) seems clumsy—
The **greatly eloquent** (大辩) seems inarticulate.
The **restless** (躁) overcomes the **obstructed** (塞),
The **serene** (静) overcomes the **boiling** (热).
**To remain in stillness and clarity is to uphold the Dao as the standard for all under heaven.**

**Chapter 46**
When the **Dao prevails** (有道) under heaven,
**The finest steeds are turned back to till the fields.**
When the **Dao does not prevail** (无道) under heaven,
**Warhorses breed in the suburbs.**
No crime is greater than **covetous desire** (可欲),
No calamity than **not knowing contentment** (不知足),
No misfortune than **desiring what one cannot obtain** (欲得).
**Thus, true contentment is constant contentment—
One who knows it never strays from it.**

**Chapter 47**
**Not stepping beyond one’s door, one knows the world;
Not peering through windows, one sees the Dao of heaven.**
The farther one’s gaze, the more distant one’s knowledge;
**The more one seeks to know, the closer one’s understanding.**
**Therefore, the Sage acts without venturing,
Sees without gazing,
Does without contriving—
And thus achieves completion.**

**Chapter 48**
**To study learning is to daily increase,
To cultivate the Dao is to daily diminish.**
Diminish and diminish again—
Until one reaches **non-action** (无为).
**Non-action is the ultimate action.**
**To take the world with ease is to act with simplicity;
Yet when affairs arise, such simplicity is insufficient to take the world.**

**Chapter 49**
The **Sage has no fixed heart** (无心),
**Taking the hearts of the people as their own.**
The **good, I make good** (善者吾善之),
**The not-good, I also make good** (不善者吾亦善之)—**thus attaining goodness.**
The **trustworthy, I trust** (信者吾信之),
**The untrustworthy, I also trust** (不信者吾亦信之)—**thus attaining trust.**
**The Sage, present in the world, is cautious;
Yet in serving the world, their heart is at ease.**
**All the people strain their ears and eyes,
Yet the Sage treats them as infants.**

**Chapter 50**
**Birth and death intertwine—
Life and death are but one.**
Of those who cling to life, **thirteen perish in ten ways** (生之徒十有三),
Of those who cling to death, **thirteen perish in ten ways** (死之徒十有三).
**Humans, clinging to life, are thrust into death’s domain—
In thirteen per ten.**
**Why is this so?**
Because their **vitality is overbearing** (生生之厚).
**Yet those who skillfully preserve life**
**Walk upon land without fear of tigers or rhinoceroses** (不遇虎兕),
**March into battle without being struck by weapons or armor** (不被甲兵).
**The rhinoceros finds no place to hurl its horn,
The tiger finds no place to wield its claws,
Weapons find no place to lodge their blades.**
**Why is this so?**
Because they **avoid death’s domain** (无死地).

**Chapter 51**
The **Dao** (道) gives birth to it,
**Virtue** (德) nurtures it,
**Form** (物) molds it,
**Circumstance** (势) completes it.
**Thus, all things reverence the Dao and honor virtue.**
The **Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—
None command them, yet they arise naturally.**
**Therefore, the Dao gives birth and does not possess,
Acts and does not claim credit,
Grows yet does not rule—
This is called **mysterious virtue** (玄德).**

**Chapter 52**
Under heaven, there is a **beginning** (始),
**Which we call the Mother of the world** (天下母).
**Knowing this Mother, one also knows her child.**
**Knowing the child, one returns to guard the Mother—
And thus perishes not in body.**
**Seal the senses, shut the doors—
And thus one’s life is never weary.**
**Open the senses, advance one’s affairs—
And thus one’s life is never saved.**
**To see the small as bright is clarity,
To hold the yielding as strong is power.**
**To use its radiance and return to its clarity—
Without leaving behind one’s own ruin—
This is called **the Way of habit** (习常).**

**Chapter 53**
**If I were to claim knowledge and stand firm in the Dao,
I would fear only to act in excess.**
**The Dao is most smooth, yet people love ruggedness.**
**Morning’s fields are cleared, yet afternoon’s are overgrown,
Granaries are empty, yet treasures overflow.**
**Adorned in fine silks, girded with sharp blades,
They glut themselves on food and drink—
Yet their wealth remains abundant.**
**This is called **the ostentation of thieves** (盗夸);
It is not the Dao!**

**Chapter 54**
**The well-built stands firm and is not uprooted,
The well-embraced is not cast off—
Thus their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.**
**Cultivate it in oneself, and one’s virtue is true;
Cultivate it in one’s family, and one’s virtue overflows;
Cultivate it in one’s village, and one’s virtue grows long;
Cultivate it in one’s state, and one’s virtue becomes abundant;
Cultivate it under all of heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.**
**Thus, to observe oneself through oneself,
One’s family through one’s family,
One’s village through one’s village,
One’s state through one’s state,
All of heaven through all of heaven—
How do I know all of heaven thus?**
**By this.**」

「The depth of **virtue** (德) is like that of an infant.
**Poisonous insects** do not sting,
**Fierce beasts** do not seize,
**Savage birds** do not attack.
The bones are frail, the sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.
They do not know the union of male and female yet their **vital essence** (精) is fully formed—this is the peak of **vital essence** (精).
They cry all day yet never grow hoarse—this is the peak of **harmony** (和).
To know **harmony** (和) is to know the **constant** (常),
To know the **constant** (常) is to know **clarity** (明).
To benefit life is to bring **auspiciousness** (祥);
To let the **heart** (心) command the **qi** (氣) is to be strong.
When things grow robust, they grow old—
This is called **not the Dao/Way** (不道),
And **not the Dao/Way** (不道) will soon perish.
**Chapter 66**
The wise do not speak,
Those who speak do not know.
Stop up its **mouth** (兑),
Close its **door** (門),
Dull its **sharpness** (鋭),
Relieve its **anger** (忿),
Harmonize its **radiance** (光),
Blend with its **dust** (塵)—
This is called **Mysterious Uniformity** (玄同).
Thus, it cannot be grasped as near,
Nor rejected as distant;
It cannot be taken as advantageous,
Nor discarded as harmful;
It cannot be prized as noble,
Nor despised as lowly.
Thus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.
**Chapter 67**
To govern a state with **rectitude** (正),
To employ **strategies** (奇) in warfare,
To take the world with **non-action** (無事)—
How do I know this is so?
By this:
Under heaven, many **taboos** (忌讳) exist,
Yet people grow ever poorer;
Many **clever devices** (利器) are wielded,
Yet the state grows ever more **corrupt** (昏);
Many **artful tricks** (伎巧) are practiced,
Yet **strange things** (奇物) proliferate;
**Laws and rituals** (法物) grow ever more prominent,
Yet **thieves and robbers** (盗贼) abound.
Thus the **sage** (聖人) says:
*"I practice non-action, yet people transform themselves;
I love tranquility, yet people become upright;
I have no affairs, yet people grow rich;
I have no desires, yet people return to simplicity."*"
**Chapter 68**

When governance is **obscure and quiet** (闷闷),
Its people are **pure and sincere** (醇醇);
When governance is **bright and scrutinizing** (察察),
Its people are **deceitful and cunning** (缺缺).
**Calamity** (祸) depends on **fortune** (福),
**Fortune** (福) depends on **calamity** (祸).
Who knows their **extremes** (極)?
It is **without rectitude** (無正).
Governance that is **too strange** (奇),
**Goodness** (善) that is **too bizarre** (妖)—
The people’s **delusion** (迷) will endure long.
Thus the **sage** (聖人) remains **square without cutting** (方而不割),
**Modest without harming** (廉而不害),
**Upright without excess** (直而不肆),
**Radiant without dazzling** (光而不曜).

**Chapter 69**
To govern the people and serve **Heaven** (天),
Nothing surpasses **frugality** (啬).
For only **frugality** (啬)
Is called **early cultivation** (早服).
**Early cultivation** (早服) is **laying down deep virtue** (重积德).
To lay down deep virtue is to achieve nothing it cannot overcome,
To overcome nothing is to know no bounds.
To know no bounds is to have a state.
The **mother of a state** (有国之母),
Can endure long.
This is called the **Dao/Way of deep roots** (深根),
**Firm stems** (固蒂),
**Long life** (長生),
**Enduring vision** (久視).

**Chapter 70**
To govern a great state is like **cooking a small fish** (亨小鲜).
To apply the **Dao/Way** (道) to all under heaven,
Its **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神).
It is not that its **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神),
But that when they are **ominous** (神), they do not harm people.
It is not that when they are **ominous** (神) they do not harm people,
But that the **sage** (聖人) also does not harm people.
Thus, both do not harm each other—
Hence they can **return and abide** (交归) together.

**Chapter 71**
Great states **flow downward** (下流),
The **pivot of the world** (天下之交),
The **receptive** (牝) of the world.
The **active** (牡) always **overcomes the receptive** (牝) through **tranquility** (静),
And **tranquility** (静) is **to flow downward** (下).
Thus, great states **flow downward** (下) to the small states,
And **take** (取) them;
Small states **flow downward** (下) to the great states,
And **are taken** (取).
Thus, sometimes one **flows downward** (下) to **take** (取),
Sometimes one **flows downward** (下) as if to **take** (取).
Great states desire only to **harbor and nourish** (兼畜) the people,
Small states desire only to **enter and serve** (入事) them.
These two, each attaining what they desire—
The greater ought to **flow downward** (下).
Thus, **to flow downward** (下) is to **take** (取).

**Chapter 72**
The **Dao/Way** (道) is the **mystery** (奧) of all things.
**Virtue** (善) is the treasure of people;
**Non-virtue** (不善) is what people do not treasure.
**Fine words** (美言) can earn **esteem** (尊),
**Actions** (行) can **augment** (加) others.
If people’s **non-virtue** (不善) is cast aside, what remains?
Thus, to **establish the Son of Heaven** (立天子),
To **appoint the Three Exalted Ones** (置三公),
Even with **arching jade tablets** (拱璧) and **four horses** (先驷马),
It is not as good as **sitting and presenting this Dao/Way** (坐进此道).
Why did the ancients value this **Dao/Way** (道) so highly?
Was it not because **to seek and obtain** (求以得),
And **to have faults yet strive** (有罪以勉)?
Thus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.

**Chapter 73**
To **act without acting** (無為),
To **do without doing** (事無事),
To **taste without tasting** (味無味).
Great or small, many or few—
**Repay resentment with virtue** (報怨以德).
**Difficult tasks** (難) are **easier than easy ones** (易),
**Great affairs** (大) are **smaller than small ones** (細).
Under heaven, **difficult tasks** (難) must begin with what is **easy** (易);
Under heaven, **great affairs** (大) must begin with what is **small** (細).
Thus, the **sage** (聖人) never **acts as great** (為大),
Hence they can **complete their greatness** (成其大).
He who **makes light of promises** (輕諾) will **lack trustworthiness** (寡信),
He who **multiplies cleverness** (多易) will **encounter many difficulties** (多難).
Thus, the **sage** (聖人) **avoids what is difficult** (犹難之),
Hence they **never encounter difficulties** (終無難).

**Chapter 74**
Its **tranquility** (安) is **easy to maintain** (易持),
Its **latent signs** (未兆) are **easy to plan against** (易谋),
Its **fragility** (脆) is **easy to break** (易破),
Its **subtlety** (微) is **easy to disperse** (易散).
To **act before its existence** (未有),
To **govern before its chaos** (未乱).
A tree as thick as **two arms embracing** (合抱之木),
Grows from a **tiny sprout** (毫末);
A **nine-tiered terrace** (九层之台),
Rises from a **heap of earth** (累土);
A **thousand-li journey** (千里之行),
Begins with a **single step** (足下).
To **act is to court defeat** (為者敗之),
To **cling is to lose it** (执者失之).
Thus, the **sage** (聖人) **does not act** (無為), hence **no defeat** (故無敗);
**Does not cling** (無执), hence **no loss** (故無失).
The people’s **endeavors** (從事),
Often **fail just as completion nears** (常于几成而敗之).
To **be cautious at the end as at the beginning** (慎终如始),
Then there will be **no failed affairs** (敗事).
Thus, the **sage** (聖人) **desires yet does not desire** (欲不欲),
Does not **value difficult-to-obtain wealth** (貴難得之货);
**Learns yet does not learn** (學不學),
**Repeats what others have already passed over** (復眾人之所過).
To **aid the natural course of all things** (辅万物之自然而),
Yet **dare not act** (不敢為).

「Frugality, hence able to be expansive;
Not daring to lead the world, hence able to **fulfill one’s role and endure** (成器长).
Now to abandon **virtue/power** (慈) and yet be **bold** (勇),
To abandon frugality and yet seek **expansiveness** (广),
To abandon **humility** (后) and yet **take the lead** (先)—
This is death.

**Virtue/power** (慈): in battle, it brings victory;
In defense, it brings **fortification**.
When Heaven intends to **aid** (救) one, it does so with **virtue/power** (慈) as its shield.

**Chapter 68**
The ancients who excelled as **scholars** (士) were not **martial** (武);
Those skilled in war did not **rage** (怒);
Those who best **vanquished enemies** did not **contend** (争);
Those who best **employed benevolence** (仁) **took the lower position** (为下).
This is called the **virtue/power of non-contention** (不争之德).
Thus, by **utilizing others’ strength** (用人之力),
This is called **harmonizing with Heaven’s ultimate** (配天古之极).

**Chapter 69**
In wielding arms, there is a saying:
*“I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,
Not dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.”*
This is called **moving without movement** (行无行),
**Repelling without arms** (攘无臂),
**Confronting without rivals** (仍无敌),
**Seizing without weapons** (执无兵).
**No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy** (轻敌),
For underestimating the enemy nearly **loses one’s treasures** (丧吾宝).
Thus, when armies clash, **the compassionate prevail** (哀者胜).

**Chapter 70**
My words are **easy to know, easy to act upon** (易知，易行).
Yet the world **cannot know them, cannot act upon them**.
Words have their **root** (宗), affairs have their **master** (君).
It is only because of **ignorance** (无知) that they **do not know me**.
Few **know me**, hence those who **follow me are precious** (则我者贵).
Thus, the **sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade**.

**Chapter 71**
To **know what one does not know** is **superior** (知不知上),
To **not know what one knows** is **illness** (不知知，病).
Thus, the **sage does not fall ill**.
Because he **heals illness with illness**, hence he **does not fall ill**.

**Chapter 72**
When the people **do not fear authority**, **great authority arrives**.
Do not **narrow their dwelling**, do not **exhaust their sustenance**.
It is only because of **not exhausting** that there is **no exhaustion**.
Thus, the **sage knows himself but does not display himself**,
Loves himself but does not **exalt himself**.
Hence, **discard that, take this**.

**Chapter 73**
To be **bold in daring is to kill**,
To be **bold in not daring is to live**.
Know that these two may bring **benefit or harm**.
What Heaven **abhors**, who knows its reason?

Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—
**Non-contention yet triumphant**,
**Silent yet responsive**,
**Unsummoned yet arriving**,
**Unassuming yet masterful in planning**.
Heaven’s net is vast and **meshed yet not entangled** (恢恢，疏而不漏).

**Chapter 74**
The people do not fear death—
How can you **terrify them with death**?
If one **always fears death** and yet **acts strangely** (为奇),
I would **seize and kill them**—what would I **dare**?
There are always **official executioners** who kill.
For one to **usurp the executioner’s role** and kill—
This is called **usurping the master carpenter’s chisel**.
He who **usurps the master carpenter’s chisel**—
Few escape **injuring their hands**.

**Chapter 75**
The people’s **hunger** stems from their **rulers’ excessive taxation** (食税之多),
Thus they **suffer hunger**.
The people’s **difficulty to govern** stems from their **rulers’ interference** (有为),
Thus they are **hard to govern**.
People **trifle with death** because their **burden of living is heavy** (生生之厚),
Thus they **lightly regard death**.
It is only those who **do not cling to life** who are **superior to those who prize it**.

**Chapter 76**
**Life’s vitality** (生之柔弱) is **soft and weak**,
Yet in death, it becomes **hard and strong**.
All things—grasses and trees—
In life are **tender and fragile**,
Yet in death become **withered and brittle**.
Thus, the **hard and strong** belong to death,
The **soft and weak** belong to life.
Hence, **strong arms do not conquer** (兵强则不胜),
**Hard wood is easily split** (木强则共).
Thus, the **hard and strong** take the **lower position**,
The **soft and weak** take the **upper position**.

**Chapter 77**
Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—
Is it not like **drawing a bow**?

「**Chapter 78**»
The **high are lowered**,
The **low are raised**,
The **excessive are diminished**,
The **deficient are supplemented**.
Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—
It diminishes excess and supplements deficiency;
Yet **human affairs** are otherwise—
They diminish the deficient and heap upon the excessive.
How can one **heap upon the world** and yet **supplement the deficient**?
Only those who **embody the Dao**.
Thus, the **Sage acts but does not claim** (恃),
Accomplishes deeds but does not dwell upon them—
This is how **the Sage is not seen as virtuous**.

**Chapter 79**»
The **soft and weak** of all things under Heaven
Are none greater than **water**,
Yet it **assails the hard and strong**—
None can **outdo it** (先),
And there is **nothing to replace it**.
Thus, the weak **overcome the strong**,
The **soft overcomes the rigid**—
Yet none under Heaven **know** or **can practice** this.
Hence, the **Sage says**:
“To **bear the filth of the state** (垢) is to be called the **lord of the ancestral altars** (社稷主);
To **bear the state’s calamities** (不祥) is to be called the **king of all under Heaven**.”
**Right words seem inverted**.

**Chapter 80**»
**Sages of small states with few people**,
Though they possess **hundreds and thousands of implements** (什伯之器),
Do not **utilize them**;
Though they **value life**,
They do not **flee to distant lands**.
Though they have **chariots and boats**,
There is **none to ride them**;
Though they have **armor and weapons**,
There is **none to display them**.
They **restore the people** to **tying knots** (結绳) for record-keeping,
Content with their **food**,
Adorned in their **garments**,
Secure in their **dwellings**,
Delighted in their **customs**,
Where neighboring states **look upon one another**,
And the sounds of **chickens and dogs** are heard between them—
The people **grow old and die**,
Yet **do not travel to one another**.

**Chapter 81**»
**Trustworthy words** are not **ornate**,
**Ornate words** are not **trustworthy**.
**The virtuous do not argue**,
**Those who argue are not virtuous**.
**The wise are not learned** (博),
**The learned are not wise**.
**The Sage does not hoard**—
When he **acts for others**, his **virtue/power** (德) increases;
When he **gives to others**, his **abundance** (有) grows ever greater.
Heaven’s **Dao/Way**—
**It benefits but does not harm**.
The **Sage’s Dao/Way**—
**It acts but does not contend**.
