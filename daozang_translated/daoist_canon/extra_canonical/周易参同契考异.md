*Investigation of Discrepancies in the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*
Daoist Category
Preface

We, your ministers, respectfully note: *Investigation of Discrepancies in the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, one fascicle, was compiled by Master Zhu of the Song dynasty. Chen Zhensun’s *Book Records with Annotations and Synopses* states that Master Zhu, finding the *Cantong Qi*’s diction and rhymes archaic and elegant, difficult to comprehend, and often recklessly altered by readers of shallow learning—with more errors than in other texts—thus collated various editions and mutually corrected them. Master Zhu himself cautioned that all discrepancies were preserved for reference and verification, hence the title *Investigation of Discrepancies*. Upon examination, however, the text explicitly notes variants in only two instances: for the character *治* in “Only when all under heaven is so can it be *governed*,” which is glossed as “or written as *principle* (理)”; and for *熺* in “the radiant cauldron,” which is noted as originally written *僖*. Other conjectural emendations—such as *修* suspected to be *循*, *六五* suspected to be *廿六*, *铅* suspected to be *饴*, and *与* suspected to be *为*—amount to no more than six or seven instances where Master Zhu himself made corrections. The remainder of the work, with annotations appended to each section elucidating the text, follows the form of commentary rather than exhaustive textual emendation. Thus, the title *Investigation of Discrepancies* does not fully reflect its content.

At the end of the work, the compiler signs as “Daoist Zou Xu of Kongtong.” As Zou was originally from the state of Zhu, which later lost its city and became the surname Zhu, this is a borrowed name. The *Rites of Zheng*’s commentary notes that *防* should be written as *熹*, and the *Collected Rhymes* states that both *熹* and *防* are pronounced *xū* in the *qí* tone. The adoption of this name likely alludes to the elixir of the cinnabar heart—a teaching beyond the purview of Confucian scholars—hence the veiled language.

Examining Master Zhu’s recorded dialogues, his discussions on the *Cantong Qi* are quite thorough. His *Chronological Biography* also records that in the third year of the Qingyuan era, when Cai Yuanding was to be exiled to Daozhou, he lodged with Master Zhu at Hanquan Retreat, where they discussed the *Cantong Qi* late into the night. In his collected writings, there is a letter to Cai Jitong stating: “The *Cantong Qi* has no gaps, nor does it require mental effort; I merely hope one day to become Liu An’s chickens and dogs.” Such words suggest that, amid the hardships of the era, he had no choice but to take refuge in the rhetoric of immortals—an intent akin to Han Yu’s visit to the monk Dadian while exiled to Chaozhou.

Huang Ruijie’s supplementary notes observe that Master Zhu and his disciples harbored the intention of “casting off the world,” capturing his true sentiment. Huang Zhen’s *Daily Excerpts* remarks: “The *Cantong Qi* was written by Wei Boyang of Shangyu. Its teachings derive from immortals and are not to be trusted. Cai Jitong, a scholar of broad learning yet not without flaws, once devoted himself to this text. Master Zhu, associating with him, thus edited and corrected the work, which has since circulated widely. Yet if one seeks its meaning, it is entirely absent.” While his critique is sound, he fails to grasp the intent to “take refuge under a guise.”

Respectfully submitted after collation in the ninth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

*Investigation of Discrepancies in the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*
By **Zhu Xi** of the **Song Dynasty**

**Preface to the Exegesis by Peng Xiao of the Five Dynasties:**
Wei Boyang of Guiji in Shangyu was a man who cultivated the Dao in seclusion, nurturing his will in emptiness and nonbeing. His literary prowess was vast, and he was versed in apocrypha and prognostication. Having fully grasped the mysteries of the ancient *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, he then condensed the *Zhouyi* to compose the *Cantong Qi* in three chapters, later adding a supplementary chapter to fill omissions. Much of its content employs allegory, borrowing events to obscurely reveal profound truths. It was secretly transmitted to Xu, an Attendant Officer of Qingzhou—Xu being his surname—who annotated it. During the reign of Emperor Huan, Boyang further transmitted it to his fellow townsman, Chunyu Shutong, whereupon it spread throughout the world.

*Cantong* means "correspondence" or "union"; *qi* means "agreement." It signifies that the work’s principles correspond and align with those of the *Zhouyi*. The text metaphorically employs the relationship between ruler and minister to elucidate inner and outer, narrates the hexagrams *Li* and *Kan* to directly indicate mercury and lead, and establishes the *Qian* and *Kun* hexagrams as the foundation of the cauldron. It clarifies the beginning and end through the analogy of parents and guardians, unites them as husband and wife to constrain their intercourse, compares them to male and female to manifest generation, and analyzes them through yin and yang to guide their cyclical transformations. It demonstrates the waxing and waning of the moon through obscurity and visibility, coordinates ascent and descent with the hexagrams and lines, follows the handle of the Dipper to circulate the stars, divides time by dawn and dusk, and illuminates the hours through the water clock. Without exception, it discusses all these matters by drawing upon the imagery of the *Yi*. Hence, it is called *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.

**Appendix:** The annotated editions of the *Cantong Qi* number nineteen works in thirty-one fascicles, as listed in Zheng Qiao’s *Yiwen Lue* of Jiaji. Peng Xiao’s edition is the most widely transmitted, though he divided its three chapters into ninety sections to correspond with the yang number nine, and appended a *Song of the Cauldron* to match the water number one. Such arrangements are mere imitations of the *Heshang Gong*’s division of the *Daodejing* into eighty-one chapters, yet in truth, they are not so. Mr. Bao remarked that Peng’s edition, altered by shallow scholars of recent times, contains errors, omissions, and redundancies in both the Palace copies and those circulated among the people, making it impossible to determine the correct version. Master Zhu, in his collation and emendation, relied on this edition as his basis, and thus we dare not further append other interpretations.

**Appendix—Master Zhu’s Remarks:**
The *Cantong Qi* was not originally intended to elucidate the *Yi*. It merely borrowed the method of "inserting the heavenly stems" to convey the timing of advancing and retreating in cultivation. In the past, I wished to study it but could not obtain its transmission, nor find a starting point, so I dared not lightly discuss it. However, the method of "inserting the heavenly stems" it describes is the same as the divination technique of Jing Fang, as seen in the *Fire Pearl Forest*. What it refers to as *jia*, *yi*, *bing*, *ding*, *geng*, and *xin* pertains to the moon’s appearance and disappearance at dusk and dawn, not to the division of the six hexagrams’ directions.

Though this was not devised to elucidate the *Yi*, the *Yi* encompasses all things. If its teachings form a coherent system that can be extended and applied, they do no harm to the *Yi*. Boyang’s *Cantong Qi* may share some origins with the learning of [Chen] Tuan. The *Xiantian Tu* corresponds with the system of pitch standards, and Cai Jitong claimed it aligns with the *Cantong Qi*. Observing it through the diagram: between *Kun* and *Fu* lies obscurity; *Zhen* represents the third day, when the first yang arises; the eighth day is *Dui*, when the moon’s upper edge is full; the fifteenth day is *Qian*, when the moon is full; the eighteenth day is *Xun*, when the first yin arises; the twenty-third day is *Gen*, when the moon’s lower edge wanes. *Kan* and *Li* represent the sun and moon, hence they are not used in the *Cantong Qi*. The remainder pertains to the firing times.

Shao Yong elucidated the *Xiantian Tu*, which was transmitted from Chen Tuan, who in turn received it from another source. This is the technique of the fangshi, employed in cultivation—precisely what the *Cantong Qi* describes.

The *Cantong Qi*’s literary quality is excellent, likely composed by one of the finest writers of the Later Han. Its diction is based on ancient texts, incomprehensible to modern readers, which has led to many misinterpretations. Numerous versions exist, one of which states:
*"After a thousand cycles, resplendent and flourishing,
Ten thousand repetitions will reveal the numinous.
It may enlighten others, or the spirit may suddenly awaken on its own."*
Reciting it over time, the essential meaning and key instructions will naturally become clear.

**Liu of Xuqi** remarked: "Among ancient texts, only the *Cantong Qi* resembles pre-Qin prose."

**Upper Chapter:**
*Qian* and *Kun* are the gate and door of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams.

Qian and Kun, when spoken of in terms of the cosmos, mean that Qian as Heaven is above and Kun as Earth is below, and the transformations of yin and yang, the beginnings and endings of the myriad things, all occur between them. When spoken of in terms of the human body, Qian as yang is above and Kun as yin is below, and the yin and yang of the entire body, the transformations of the myriad things, their beginnings and endings, all occur between them. This is why Qian and Kun are called the gate and door of the *Yi*, the parents of all hexagrams. All discussions of the *Yi* refer to the transformations of yin and yang, which in the human body are what is called the Golden Elixir and the Great Medicine. Thus, are Qian and Kun not the crucible and furnace? Kan and Li serve as the enclosing frame, turning the hub and aligning the axle.

Qian and Kun are positioned above and below, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them—this is what is meant by the *Yi*. In the arrangement of the precelestial positions, Qian is south, Kun is north, Li is east, and Kan is west. Thus, their configuration resembles the shape of a walled enclosure, and their ascent and descent are like an axle piercing the hub to turn the wheel—one descends as the other ascends. The hub is the center of the wheel, solid on the outside to hold the spokes and hollow within to receive the axle. The axle is the horizontal wood beneath the cart, its two ends passing through the hubs to receive the linchpins.

The four trigrams of union—Zhen, Dui, Xun, and Gen—serve as the bellows and its pipe. The "four trigrams of union" refer to the paired trigrams Zhen and Dui, Xun and Gen. The bellows and its pipe are like the mechanism of the *na jia* method. Qian represents the full moon, Kun the new moon, while Kan and Li ascend and descend between them. Zhen governs the waxing light, Dui the culmination of brightness; Xun governs the waxing darkness, and Gen the culmination of obscurity—like the bellows, which has its rhythms of tension and release.

**Appendix (Zhu Xi’s remark):**
Master Shao said: "Qian and Kun establish the positions of above and below; Kan and Li arrange the gates of left and right." The *Cantong Qi* begins by laying out the hexagram positions—all following the same principle.

The Way of covering and enveloping yin and yang is like a skilled charioteer holding the reins and bit, guided by the marking line and carpenter’s square, following the tracks to maintain the center and regulate the external. The numbers are recorded in the pitch pipes and calendrical systems.

This speaks of how the human mind can govern yin and yang, turning the hub and axle to form the Elixir. The "reins and bit" refer to what directs yin and yang; the "marking line and carpenter’s square" refer to the firing times; the "tracks" indicate the pathways of ascent and descent; "center" refers to the mind; "external" refers to qi; and "numbers" refer to the firing times of the sixty hexagrams described below.

The lunar nodes have five or six divisions; following the sun’s path, they combine to form sixty. Hard and soft have inner and outer aspects. The moon takes five days as one node, six nodes as one cycle, and combining day and night makes sixty, corresponding to the sixty hexagrams. Day is hard, night is soft; hard is inner, soft is outer. Among the sixty-four hexagrams, Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li are used as the furnace, crucible, and medicine, leaving sixty hexagrams to serve as the firing times.

At dawn on the new moon, *Zhun* governs the affairs of the day; by dusk, *Ge* takes its place. Day and night each correspond to one hexagram, used in sequence. This is the general rule for the sixty hexagrams—a full cycle completes in one month, reflecting the early and late timing of daily practice.

Before the end of the dark moon and the break of dawn, the cycle begins anew. The celestial stems and branches serve as the measure; movement and stillness have their early and late phases. "Before the end" refers to the hexagram of the dark moon—morning is *Ji Ji*, evening is *Wei Ji*. "Break of dawn" refers to the time when light is born.

In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, proceeding from *zi* to *chen* and *si*; in autumn and winter, employ the outer use, starting from *wu* and ending at *xu* and *hai*. Spring and summer correspond to morning, autumn and winter to evening. The "inner body" refers to the preceding hexagram, the "outer use" to the following hexagram. This is also a general rule for the sixty hexagrams. The latter chapter states: *Zhun* uses *zi* and *shen*, *Ge* uses *yin* and *xu*—this fully expounds the *na jia* method. Generally, the four times of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* are used in a single day.

Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn; dawn and dusk follow the sequence of cold and heat. The line statements embody benevolence and righteousness, manifesting joy and anger in accord with the seasons. Thus, they respond to the four seasons and five phases, maintaining their proper order.

This speaks of how morning and evening practice differ, though the details are not fully explained.

Heaven and Earth take their positions, and the *Yi* operates within them. Heaven and Earth are Qian and Kun; "take their positions" refers to the arrangement of yin and yang in their paired positions. The *Yi* refers to Kan and Li—Kan and Li are the two functions of Qian and Kun.

This quotes the *Yi* to explain the functions of Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li, clarifying that Qian is above and Kun below, Li descends and Kan ascends. The "two functions" refer to Qian’s "use of nine" and Kun’s "use of six"—nine is old yang, six is old yin.

The two functions have no fixed line positions; they circulate through the six voids. Their coming and going are not fixed; neither above nor below is constant. They hide and conceal, ascending and descending within, enveloping the myriad things as the guiding principles of the Dao. By means of the formless, they regulate the formed; the vessel’s function lies in its emptiness. Thus, the waxing and waning of Kan and Li vanish without trace.

The two hexagrams Qian and Kun each have six lines, with nine and six in fixed positions. Only the "use of nine" and "use of six" have no fixed positions, yet the nine and six of the six lines are precisely these nine and six, circulating and ascending/descending. In the *na jia* method, Qian corresponds to *jia* and *ren*, Kun to *yi* and *gui*, Zhen to *geng*, Xun to *xin*, Gen to *bing*, and Dui to *ding*—all have fixed positions. Only Kan corresponds to *wu* and Li to *ji*, which have no fixed positions, for the yin and yang of the six trigrams are the circulation and ascent/descent of the middle lines of Kan and Li. Thus, the formless here governs the formed there; the vessel has form, yet its function lies in the emptiness of its form. This aligns with Laozi’s words: "Kneading clay to make a vessel, it is where there is nothing that the vessel’s use resides." "Waxing and waning" refer to the waxing from Kun through Zhen and Dui to its culmination in Qian, and the waning from Qian through Xun and Gen to its culmination in Kun. "Vanishing without trace" means having no position. The later chapter’s passage on the "use of nine" fluttering as the ancestral hexagram of the *Yi* expresses the same idea.

**Appendix (Zhu Xi’s remark):**
Someone asked: "Is the *Cantong Qi* truly the *Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic*?"
Zhu Xi replied: "No. Later people, seeing that Master Boyang’s transmission included the phrase *Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic*, fabricated this text. Generally, it is a patchwork of phrases from the *Cantong Qi*, though some parts are mistaken. For example, the 'two functions' refer to the 'use of nine' and 'use of six'—nine and six are also Kan and Li. The 'six voids' are the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and top line positions of Qian and Kun. It says that although the two functions have no fixed line positions, they constantly circulate through the six lines of Qian and Kun, just as a person’s essence and qi circulate throughout the body without fixed location. The *Dragon-Tiger Classic*, however, mistakenly speaks of 'void and danger,' forcing an interpretation where none fits."

**Appendix (Note by Peng):**
Peng believed that Master Wei obtained the ancient text of the *Dragon-Tiger Classic* and composed the *Cantong Qi*. Zhu Xi considered the *Classic* a later forgery. Now, examining the *Cantong Qi*, it contains passages from an ancient text recording the Dragon and Tiger, which likely once existed. For instance, the *Fire Record*’s text may not be the same as the version transmitted today. Bao suggested that this may be comparable to the *Three Tombs* and the *Fox-Head Classic*—whether this is true remains uncertain.

**Appendix (Further Note):**

The *Ancient Text of the Dragon-Tiger Upper Classic of the Golden and Azure* is somewhat simpler than the *Cantong Qi*, yet its phrasing and arrangement do not differ greatly from the *Qi*, and indeed appear more refined. Its closing line—*"The Fire Record is not falsely composed"*—also echoes the *Qi*. Thus, might the *Fire Record* itself be the source of the *Cantong Qi*?

Its words are not carelessly crafted, its theories not idly born; it cites evidence, demonstrates effects, measures by celestial patterns, and infers from divine illumination. It takes the formation of characters as proof: Kan (坎) as the moon’s essence (戊), Li (離) as the sun’s light (己); the union of sun and moon becomes the *Yi*. Hard and soft correspond, earth reigns over the four seasons, and the web of beginning and end—green, red, white, and black—each occupies its quadrant, all receiving the power of the central palace’s 戊 and 己.

This explains the method of character formation to clarify the union of Kan’s moon and Li’s sun into the *Yi*. For Kan’s 戊 and Li’s 己 both reside in the central palace of earth, and the four directions and four phases all derive their qi from it.

The *Yi* is imagery; no image is more luminous than the sun and moon. To fathom the divine and know transformation: when yang departs, yin arrives; like spokes converging at the hub, the wheel turns, alternating between emergence and withdrawal.

This broadly conveys the meaning of the *Yi* as the sun and moon. Below, it elaborates on the method and the fire-phase of a single month.

From the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, Zhen (震) arrives to receive the tally. At this moment, heaven and earth unite their essence, sun and moon clasp and hold; the male yang scatters its mystery, the female yin transforms into a yellow embrace. Chaos intermingles, the root of power is planted, the foundation laid. Nurturing the bud, the calyx forms; spirit congeals into form. All things tread forth, wriggling into motion—none does not arise from this. Confucius praised the primal chaos, the virtue of Qian and Kun filling the void. Tracing antiquity, the *Yuanhuang* is invoked; the *Guanju* establishes the beginning. At the first marriage, qi intertwines; the first year sprouts forth. The sage does not act in vain—gazing above, he observes the manifest celestial tally. The tally advances and retreats, bends and extends, responding to the seasons.

The method of this text divides a month into six segments, each assigned to one of the six hexagrams: Zhen (1), Dui (2), Qian (3), Xun (4), Gen (5), and Kun (6). Each segment spans five days. Thus, at the dawn of the new moon, Zhen begins its work, marking the initial union of sun and moon’s yin and yang. Here, the practice of refinement is applied, just as the sage’s composition of the Six Classics all had a point of origin. This is the essential passage of the entire work, and *"the male yang scatters its mystery, the female yin transforms into a yellow embrace"* is the crucial point of this segment; all else serves to clarify this.

Thus, the *Yi* governs the heart of heaven. The hexagram Fu (復) establishes the beginning, the eldest son succeeds the father’s body, relying on the mother to lay the foundation. Waning and waxing respond to the bell and pitch pipe; ascent and descent follow the pivot of the Dipper.

This further divides the month into twelve segments, ordered as Fu (復), Lin (臨), Tai (泰), Da Zhuang (大壯), Guai (夬), Qian (乾), Gou (姤), Dun (遁), Pi (否), Guan (觀), Bo (剝), and Kun (坤), with each segment spanning two and a half days. Fu corresponds to the first of the previous six segments, Zhen. The eldest son is Zhen, the father Qian, the mother Kun. A later passage states: *"At the dawn of the new moon, it is Fu."*

On the third day, brightness emerges; Zhen receives 庚 in the west. On the eighth day, Dui receives 丁 in the upper reaches, its surface level as a stretched cord. On the fifteenth day, Qian’s body is full and abundant, 甲 in the east.

The third day marks the midpoint of the first segment, when the moon begins to brighten. It first receives a single yang’s light, faintly visible at dusk in the west, at 庚. The eighth day marks the midpoint of the second segment, when the moon’s surface levels. It receives two yang’s light, visible at dusk in the south, at 丁. The fifteenth day marks the midpoint of the third segment, the full moon. It fully receives the sun’s light, abundant and bright, visible at dusk in the east, at 甲.

The toad and the hare’s spirit—sun and moon, unmatched in brilliance. The toad gazes upon the hexagram’s segments; the hare spits forth light. This describes the full moon’s evening, when the moon fully receives the sun’s light, borrowing the toad for sight and the hare for emission.

At seven and eight, the Dao is complete; bending and lowering, it descends. On the sixteenth, it receives governance from Xun (巽) at 辛, appearing at dawn’s clarity. Gen (艮) stands upright at 丙 in the south; on the twenty-third, Kun (坤) at 乙. On the thirtieth day, in the northeast, its light is lost. The segments exhaust and succeed one another; the body revives. Dragon’s 壬 and 癸 pair with 甲 and 乙; Qian and Kun encompass beginning and end.

Seven and eight refer to the fifteenth day. The sixteenth day marks the beginning of the fourth segment, when the first yin arises as Xun, forming the moon’s spirit, setting at dawn in the west at 辛. The twenty-third day marks the midpoint of the fifth segment, when the middle yin arises as Gen, descending to set at dawn in the south at 丙. The thirtieth day marks the end of the sixth segment, when all three yang transform and the light is spent, its body hidden in the northeast—borrowing the character *peng* (朋) for *ming* (明). The six segments of the month are complete, passing to the next month. The eldest son succeeds the father, Zhen revives; 壬 pairs with 甲, 癸 with 乙, all belonging to Qian and Kun, encompassing the ten days’ beginning and end—from the dark of the moon to the dawn of the new moon, this is the fire-phase of a single month.

**Appendix (Zhu Xi’s Note):**
In a single breath, there are the phases of dark, new moon, first quarter, full moon, and last quarter. The phase of ascent is when qi, having reached its peak, begins to descend; the phase of descent is when qi, having reached its nadir, begins to rise. The full moon is when qi is full—the sun sinks below, and the moon is round above. Between the dark and new moon, the sun and moon conjoin above. This is what is meant by *"raising water to extinguish fire"* and *"metal returning to its nature at the beginning."*

Seven and eight make fifteen; nine and six also correspond. Four of these make thirty—when yang qi is exhausted and hidden, its store is spent.

The eight trigrams are arrayed, the luminaries shift, never losing the central mystery. Subtle and elusive, difficult to behold, one infers, measures, and verifies by effect. Residing in observation, one examines its images, models its forms, sets up markers as standards. Divining and fixing fortune, issuing commands in accord with the seasons, one does not miss the moment when lines move. Above, one examines the patterns of the *River Chart*; below, one orders the earth’s topography. In the center, one investigates human nature, harmonizing and examining the Three Powers. In motion, one follows the hexagram’s segments; at rest, one relies on the hexagram’s judgment. When Qian and Kun are employed, the world is governed.

This refers to the line *"When Qian is employed, the world is governed"*—above, *"Qian and Kun are employed"* means *"employing nine"* and *"employing six."* *"Governed"* may be written as *"ordered"* to avoid Tang taboo. From here to *"the state suffers no harm to the Dao"* is all metaphor for state governance.

How can one not be cautious? At the helm of governance, one must grasp the subtle and profound, open and close, distribute the precious essentials of the Dao. The handle of the Dipper commands transformation; the net’s knot is the lines’ movement within. Fortune and misfortune arise externally. The five planets move erratically, responding to the seasons. When the four and seven are discordant, excess and separation arise; bowing and raising, Wen and Chang record it all. The censors and ministers, the hundred officials and their bureaus, each oversee their domains. Daily, they harmonize the five phases’ essence; monthly, they receive the six pitch pipes’ measure. Five and six make thirty degrees; when the degrees are complete, the cycle begins anew. Tracing beginning to end, one preserves the thread of survival and extinction.

If the ruler is arrogant and indulgent, overbearing and contrary to the Dao; if ministers are treacherous and flattering, acting outside proper bounds—then the waxing and waning of the tally will deviate, bringing misfortune. Enforcing the law, admonishing and criticizing, binding faults, shifting the ruler’s fate—only when the pole star receives its proper alignment can one leisurely entrust matters to subordinates. The Bright Hall distributes governance, and the state suffers no harm to the Dao.

These are all metaphorical expressions, yet within them lie points worthy of careful reflection. Internally, one cultivates the self through tranquility, emptiness, and non-being, returning to the primordial root. The inner light illumines the body; the orifices are sealed and fortified, the spirit-root stabilized. The Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, and the warming nurture of the "child-pearl" begins. Though unseen to the eye, it is near and easily sought. The Yellow Center gradually opens, its principle moistening and permeating to reach the skin. At first, one rectifies the foundation; in the end, one refines the branches. Yet if one clings to a single method, it obscures the world, and none will comprehend.

This is spoken of internal matters, and in the classics, it is most essential. The phrase "the Three Luminaries sink into obscurity, warming and nurturing the child-pearl" is the most essential of the essential. The earlier metaphors of "governing at the outset," "the handle of the Great Dipper," and "the guiding net" all refer precisely to this. "First rectifying the foundation" speaks of the beginning; "refining the branches in the end" speaks of the conclusion. "Clinging to a single method" refers to the obscurity at the inception, where the Way remains unmanifest.

The highest virtue acts without striving, not seeking through scrutiny; the lower virtue acts, and its function never ceases. When the upper is sealed, it is called "having"; when the lower is sealed, it is called "non-being." "Non-being" serves "having"; above, the numinous virtue resides within these two apertures. The method follows the metal qi, and they mutually depend.

What follows grows increasingly difficult to comprehend; here, I briefly interpret it according to my understanding. The "highest virtue" is what the earlier text calls the "feminine yin transforming the Yellow," enveloping the Three Luminaries’ sinking into obscurity, and what the later text calls "mercury as the flowing pearl," the "Azure Dragon accompanying it"—the "flowing pearl, mother of water," precisely what thought cannot reach. The "lower virtue" is what the earlier text calls the "masculine yang disseminating the Mysterious," warming and nurturing the "child-pearl," and what the later text calls the "White Tiger as the pivot of refinement," the "Yellow Earth, father of metal"—precisely where intention and effort are applied. When sealed, both lose their proper place.

The lower cannot be without "non-being," which serves the upper. The "numinous virtue" refers to the subtle and wondrous. The *Dragon and Tiger Classic* states: "Above, the Azure Dragon resides in the metal qi," meaning the masculine yang and the White Tiger. Generally, when yang descends, yin naturally ascends—this is what the "apertures" refer to. The *Song of the Cauldron* says: "Yin above, yang below rushing"—this, too, is a most essential statement.

"Knowing the white, guarding the black," the spirit and brightness come of themselves. The white is the essence of metal; the black is the foundation of water. Water is the pivot of the Dao; when dispersed, each is singular. The white refers to mercury; the black, to lead. "Essence of metal" speaks of its birth from lead; "foundation of water" speaks of its ability to generate water. White and black are each singular, yet water is the pivot of the Dao—this is what the "numinous virtue" refers to.

The beginning of yin and yang contains the Mysterious and the Yellow, the master of the Five Metals—the Northern River Chariot. The Mysterious and the Yellow contain earth within water, still yet intentional. The Northern River Chariot is black and generates water. According to the later text, this refers precisely to lead.

Thus, lead is black externally but harbors golden splendor within—"clothed in coarse cloth, yet holding jade." Lead is what the earlier text calls the "metal qi." Metal is the mother of water; the mother conceals the child in her womb. Water is the child of metal; the child hides in the mother’s embryo. This is the meaning of "knowing the white, guarding the black."

The Perfected One’s subtlety is as if present, as if absent, faintly resembling the great abyss—now sinking, now floating. Retreating, they disperse and each guards their domain. This is what is called "warming and nurturing the child-pearl."

Gazing from afar, it appears snow-white; approaching, it is cinnabar-red. Chains form its outer defense; white within, the true essence resides. Square and round, a cun in diameter, they blend and restrain each other. Born before heaven and earth, majestic and lofty, it is encircled by walls and watchtowers, resembling Penglai. Enclosed and sealed, the four directions connect. Hesitating, guarding, tightly secured, it blocks all wickedness. Curved corridors communicate, ever vigilant against the unexpected.

The "cun in diameter" is what is called the "child-pearl." The "walls and watchtowers" may refer to what the later text calls "the emotions governing the external, constantly forming city walls and watchtowers"—though the exact meaning remains unclear.

One may be without thought, yet cannot be without care and toil. When the qi fills the hall, none can retain it. Those who guard it prosper; those who lose it perish. In movement and stillness, rest and activity, it is ever with the person. Whether in right or wrong, one practices the method of internal vision: contemplating, treading the steps of the Dipper and the lunar lodges, the Six Jia, the hours and days, the yin path suppressing the Nine Ones. Guarding against turbid chaos, preventing the Mysterious Embryo from harm, one ingests qi, causing the intestines to rumble. Exhaling the stale, inhaling the fresh, day and night without sleep, from dusk to dawn without rest, the body grows weary and dazed, as if mad. The hundred vessels boil like a cauldron, racing without clarity. Dwelling in a circular enclosure, one erects an altar, worshipping and sacrificing to spirits morning and evening. Seeing forms and images in dreams, the heart stirs with emotion, joy, and delight—one believes longevity is assured, yet suddenly meets an early death, the body decaying and exposed. Every action violates the proper order, losing the pivot of the mechanism. Such arts are myriad, numbering thousands or tens of thousands. Advancing and retreating, they deviate from the Yellow and the Old, twisting and turning, rebelling against the Nine Capitals.

This speaks of how this Way differs from all other minor methods and cannot be explained in detail. The wise will reflect on this, suddenly understanding the path. Diligently practicing day and night without rest, after three years of ingesting and refining, one becomes light and travels afar—entering fire without burning, entering water without drowning. One can preserve or abandon life, ever joyful and without sorrow. The Dao is accomplished, virtue perfected; one conceals oneself, awaiting the time. The Great One summons, and one moves to the Central Land. When merit is complete, one ascends, receiving the register and the Fire Record. The teachings are not false, as the *Yi*’s evolution makes clear.

The crescent-moon method: the cauldron and furnace. The White Tiger is the pivot of refinement; the Sun-Mercury is the flowing pearl. The Azure Dragon accompanies it. Raising the East to join the West, the hun and po naturally restrain each other. The upper trigram is *dui*, number eight; the lower trigram is the same.

The "crescent moon" likely refers to the shape: round below, deficient above, resembling an inverted crescent. The White Tiger is lead, fire, qi, the West, the po, and yang—acting as the pivot of refinement, speaking of the downward rush that brings steaming moisture upward. Mercury is the essence of the sun; the Azure Dragon is water, the East, the hun, and yin. The upper trigram is yang; the lower trigram is yin.

[Master Zhu appended: The terms *kan*, *li*, water, fire, dragon, tiger, cinnabar, mercury, and the like are merely interchangeable names—ultimately, they refer only to essence and qi. Essence is water, *kan*, the dragon, and mercury; qi is fire, *li*, the tiger, and lead. The method uses spirit to move essence and qi, binding them to form the elixir. Yang qi, initially below, first becomes water; refined by fire, it congeals into the elixir. This explanation is most unusual.]

When the two trigrams unite their essence, the body of *qian* and *kun* is complete. Two eights correspond to one jin; the Way of the *Yi* is perfectly balanced. Eight days form *dui*, the upper trigram; advancing another eight days completes the body of *qian*. Twenty-two days form *gen*, the lower trigram; retreating another eight days completes the body of *kun*. One version notes: "A *zhu* has three hundred eighty-four, corresponding to the number of the hexagrams—this is the number of *zhu* in one *jin*." Beginning at *zhen*, rising to *qian* to reach fullness, passing through *xun* to wane, and ending at *kun* to exhaustion.

When gold enters fierce fire, its color remains unaltered; since the dawn of creation, the sun and moon have never waned in brightness, just as gold never loses its weight. The sun and moon retain their constant form, for gold is born of the moon. At the new moon, it receives the sun’s emblem; when gold returns to its mother, at the dark of the moon, they enfold each other, concealing their frame. Sunken into the cavernous void, gold regains its original nature, its majestic radiance blazing within the crucible.

Gold is lead. When it returns to its mother and regains its original nature, it is gathered and stored, no longer in use. The sun does not shine, and the moon is pure *kun* trigram. The character *熺* originally meant "blazing"; in the *Hou Han* texts, it is often used. The numbers of *zi* and *wu* combine to form three; *wu* and *ji* are called the five threes. When the five threes harmonize, the eight minerals serve as the proper framework. Inhalation and exhalation desire each other, awaiting union as husband and wife. Yellow earth is the father of metal, flowing pearl the mother of water. Water treats earth as its ghost; earth fills water, preventing it from rising. The Vermilion Bird is the essence of fire, maintaining balance to determine victory or defeat. When water prevails, fire is extinguished; when both perish, they return to the thick earth. Once the three natures unite, they guard their original essence and share a common ancestor.

*Zi* (water) is one, *wu* (fire) is two; their numbers combine to form three. *Wu* and *ji* (earth) are five; three fives combine to make eight, symbolizing the eight minerals. Yet in truth, there are only two things—water and fire—with earth as the master. Earth pertains to the spleen, which governs intention, meaning one uses intention to direct fire downward and water upward, so they breathe in harmony. Gold is fire; the Vermilion Bird likely refers to the heart, which governs intention. This "fire" differs from the "roasting" (*熬*) mentioned earlier—it is another kind of fire. "Maintaining balance" means holding the scales, governing summer. The intent of this text is largely to use fire to boil water and water to extinguish fire, echoing the earlier idea of the moon receiving the sun’s light and returning to its mother.

Sesame prolongs life; the returning elixir can be ingested. Gold’s nature does not decay, making it the treasure of all things. When alchemists consume it, their lifespans lengthen. Earth travels through the four seasons, guarding its boundaries and establishing rules. When golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain. Steaming heavily, it reaches the four limbs; the complexion becomes radiant, white hair regrows black, fallen teeth re-emerge, and the old man regains his youth, the aged woman transforms into a maiden. Changing form to escape worldly calamity, one is called a True Person.

This refers to the inner elixir; the method of ingestion remains unclear, as discussed in later chapters. It enters the Crimson Gate below.

When lead powder is cast into fire, its color is ruined and reverts to lead. Ice and snow melt in warm water, dissolving into the Great Mystery. Gold takes cinnabar as its master, harmonizing with mercury; transformations arise from their true nature, beginning and ending with themselves. All use the analogy of like transforming like.

To refine an elixir for immortality, one must use like substances: plant grain with grain, cover chickens with their own eggs, and rely on the natural to assist the natural. Things will easily take form. Fish eyes are not pearls; fleabane does not become sandalwood. Like follows like; disparate things cannot form treasures. Thus, swallows do not give birth to phoenixes, foxes and rabbits do not nurse horses, water does not flow upward to blaze, nor does fire move downward to moisten.

Again, it is shown that unlike things cannot succeed; this is repeatedly clarified.

Many scholars in the world possess lofty talent, yet by chance, they do not encounter proper methods. They waste their efforts, squander their wealth, and rely on textual interpretations, arbitrarily imposing their own ideas. Without foundation, their measurements and handling go awry. They pound and refine orpiment, mica, arsenolite, magnetite, sulfur, and mercury, burning camphorwood and mud to smelt them. They add the five minerals, copper, and other substances as aids, but their natures differ, and they refuse to unite. A thousand attempts lead to ten thousand failures; seeking immortality, they instead become foolish. Even in old age, with white hair, they remain doubtful midway, abandoning the Dao to cling to delusion, straying from the correct path into depravity. Peering through a tube, their narrow vision makes it difficult to gauge the future.

This refers to those who pursue the outer elixir; if the medicines are not of like kind, they cannot form treasures.

As for the utmost sages: Fu Xi drew the eight trigrams, modeling the celestial patterns; King Wen of Zhou, the emperor’s ancestor, structured the hexagrams and composed the line statements; and Confucius, the most eminent of sages, added the Ten Wings to assist them. These three rulers, raised by Heaven, succeeded one another in governing their times. Though their steps varied in excellence, their virtues did not differ. Their creations built upon one another; they measured and weighed, carefully distinguishing the smallest details. What had form was easy to manage; what lacked form was difficult to grasp. They acted so their deeds could serve as models, establishing the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* for the world. These works contained no prior knowledge but relied on teachers to awaken understanding—like lifting the curtains to gaze from a high tower.

The three sages succeeded one another, and their achievements had varying degrees of excellence. Fu Xi modeled Heaven, King Wen followed Fu Xi, and Confucius followed King Wen. What had form was easy to regulate; what lacked form was hard to attain. This passage explains that one awakens to this principle through a teacher. The meaning of the lines on the *Book of Poetry* and *Book of Documents* remains unclear.

The *Fire Records* comprise six hundred chapters, all pursuing the same goal. The text is earnest, yet people do not ponder deeply to trace its origins. The hidden and the manifest originally dwell together. I await the worthy to discuss this; how dare I lightly commit it to writing? Holding my tongue, I wish to remain silent, but cutting off the Dao would incur punishment. Pouring out my feelings onto bamboo and silk, I fear revealing Heaven’s signs. Hesitating, I sigh, looking up and down, and compile these foolish words. There are methods for refining, but I dare not fully expound them. I merely outline the framework and reveal the branches.

The *Fire Records* of six hundred chapters may be an ancient text now lost.

Using gold as a dike, water and fire remain at ease. Gold’s number is fifteen, and water’s number is the same. When the furnace is prepared, the weights and measures are fixed: five parts water, with two parts remaining as the true essence. Gold’s weight returns to its original state; the three parts do not enter the water but accompany the two. The three substances contain and receive each other, transforming as if by magic. Below, the *qi* of the Great Yang steams and rises. After a moment, it first liquefies, then congeals, called the Yellow Chariot.

This describes the first transformation of the elixir. Gold and water appear together; some versions say "fire" instead of "water." According to the following text, the three substances should be "fire." Yet it also mentions "below, the *qi* of the Great Yang," suggesting only two substances. Perhaps it should read "eight" instead of "three," and "two" instead of "three." This refers to gold and water, both numbered fifteen, with water divided into five parts, only two of which are used—six parts of fifteen. The three parts are nine parts of fifteen. Water (or fire) is two, corresponding to the two above; the three substances below align with them. However, the absence of fire’s weight above and the mention of "Great Yang" below cast doubt. The mutual containment of the two substances refers to the union of *yin* and *yang*, *kan* and *li*. The error of "three substances" is evident.

When years and months near their end, nature is harmed, and lifespan is cut short. The body becomes ashes and dust, like dust on a bright window—this is the second transformation.

The grinding, refining, and blending are swiftly introduced into the Crimson Gate, where its borders are firmly sealed to prevent any leakage. Vigilance must be maintained to ensure its integrity, while blazing fire is kindled below, burning day and night with unwavering diligence. Begin with the civil and conclude with the martial; then, observe and inspect with utmost care, adjusting warmth and coolness with meticulous attention. Circulate through the twelve joints, exhausting each in turn, for one must personally attend to the *qi* when life’s breath is on the verge of severance. When the *po* and *hun* fade and the color shifts, it transforms into a radiant purple—thus is the Returned Elixir formed. Taking a single pellet, the size of a knife’s tip, is most potent. This is the third transformation.

The grinding, refining, and blending here serve a distinct purpose. The Crimson Gate refers to the mouth. When saliva congeals into ash-like earth, the principle must be self-evident—spit it out, refine it, then swallow it again. The blazing fire is the so-called Great Yang *qi*. The phrase "sound is diligent" is echoed in later passages, describing a mournful wail like an infant longing for its mother. The character for "cultivate" may be a scribal error for "follow." The *qi* seeking life’s end reprises the earlier theme of fire extinguished and metal restored. The terms "powdered cinnabar" and "knife’s tip" remain unclear.

Expounding upon the Five Phases’ numerology is concise yet unburdensome. Water is used to stimulate fire, which suddenly extinguishes its brilliance. The sun and moon contend, their radiance enduring only in the interplay of darkness and new moon. When water waxes, *kan* encroaches upon *yang*; when fire wanes, *li* dims the day. *Yin* and *yang* consume one another, their mutual transformation following the Dao’s natural course. The name is fixed by essence, while the term arises from inherent nature. Only when metal returns to its original nature can it be called the Returned Elixir. This elucidates the meaning behind the name "Returned Elixir," which arises from fire’s extinction and metal’s restoration.

I dare not speak idly but emulate the sages’ ancient texts. The *Dragon-Tiger Classic* praises the Yellow Emperor’s Golden Flower; the *Huainanzi* refines autumn stone; Wang Yang adds yellow sprouts. The worthy may practice this, while the unworthy must not partake. From ancient times to the present, the Dao has been a singular discourse. Scholars, exert yourselves, ponder deeply, and grasp the essentials. The words are plain and luminous, never deceiving.

**Middle Section**

*Qian* is firm, *kun* is yielding; their union and containment arise from *yang* endowing and *yin* receiving. Male and female depend on one another, and through their interaction, essence and *qi* unfold. *Kan* and *li* crown the head, their radiance cascading—mysterious and profound, beyond depiction. The sage measures and arranges, grounding the four in the primordial chaos, entering the formless. The sixty-four hexagrams spread like a chariot’s canopy, harnessed to the dragon-horse. The enlightened ruler steers the times, and harmony follows, the path smooth and unerring. The deviant way is perilous, steep, and treacherous, endangering the state.

This mirrors the opening chapter of the preceding section.

When the noble one dwells in his chamber and speaks with virtue, his words resonate a thousand *li* away—such is the lord of ten thousand chariots, issuing decrees from his nine-tiered palace. His commands align with *yin* and *yang*, storing instruments until the proper time, never transgressing the hexagrams. *Zhun* governs the hours of *zi* and *shen*, while *meng* governs *yin* and *xu*. The remaining sixty hexagrams each have their appointed days. Here, two images are presented, though their full intricacies remain unexplored. Establishing principles and enacting punishments, bestowing virtue upon the benevolent, and dooming the rebellious to misfortune—these follow the calendar’s decrees. Sincerity and precision are paramount; observe the celestial stems and branches, scrutinizing their waxing and waning. Even the slightest deviation invites regret and harm. At the solstices, the degrees shift; errors accumulate, and distortions arise. In the depths of winter, scorching heat; in the height of summer, hail and snow. At the equinoxes, imbalance reigns—timekeeping falters, wind and rain arrive unseasonably, drought and flood contend, locusts surge like boiling water, mountains crumble, and the earth splits. Heaven displays its omens, and strange portents emerge. The filial son’s devotion stirs the August Ultimate, its effects rippling near and far, even to distant lands. These may bring calamity or fortune, usher in peace or war—all stem from the heart’s movements.

Maintain constancy in action and stillness, adhering to the plumb line. Harmonize with the four seasons and the *qi* to discern firmness and yielding. They do not intermingle; the Five Phases observe their boundaries, neither overfilling nor depleting. The *Yi*’s cycles flow—bending and extending, reversing and returning.

This mirrors the preceding section’s discussion of *zhun* and *meng*, their inner and outer applications intertwined. *Qian* governs *jia* and *ren*; *kun* governs *yi* and *gui*; *zhen* governs *geng* and *xin*; *kan* governs *wu*; *li* governs *ji*; *gen* governs *bing*; *dui* governs *ding*.

The method of doubling the hexagrams: *Qian*’s lower three lines govern *jiazi*, *jiayin*, and *jiachen*, while the upper three govern *renwu*, *renshen*, and *renxu*. *Kun*’s lower three lines govern *yimao*, *yichou*, and *yihai*, while the upper three govern *guisi*, *guichou*, and *guiyou*. *Zhen*’s lower three lines govern *gengzi*, *gengyin*, and *gengchen*, while the upper three govern *gengwu*, *gengshen*, and *gengxu*. *Xun*’s lower three lines govern *xinchou*, *xinhai*, and *xinyou*, while the upper three govern *xinwei*, *xinmao*, and *xinsi*. *Kan*’s lower three lines govern *wuchen*, *wuyin*, and *wuzi*, while the upper three govern *wuxu*, *wushen*, and *wuwu*. *Li*’s lower three lines govern *jichou*, *jihai*, and *jiyou*, while the upper three govern *jisi*, *jiwei*, and *jimao*. *Gen*’s lower three lines govern *bingchen*, *bingwu*, and *bingshen*, while the upper three govern *bingxu*, *bingzi*, and *bingyin*. *Dui*’s lower three lines govern *dingmao*, *dingchou*, and *dinghai*, while the upper three govern *dingyou*, *dingwei*, and *dingsi*. The inner body spans from *zi* to *chen* and *si*, while the outer application ranges from *wu* to *xu* and *hai*. Thus, at dawn during *zhun*, the *jiazi* line of the initial nine corresponds to the *zi* hour, and the *wushen* line of the six in the fourth place corresponds to the *mao* hour. At dusk during *meng*, the *wuyin* line of the initial six corresponds to the *wu* hour, and the *wuxu* line of the six in the fourth place corresponds to the *you* hour. The remaining sixty hexagrams follow this method. This reiterates the fire-times within a single day.

Between the dark and new moons, the signs align, and the primordial chaos flows. The female and male unite, their essences blending, moistening and nourishing, their transformations circulating. Heaven and earth’s spirits defy measurement. Utilize this to stabilize the body, conceal the form, and preserve the origin.

In the northeast, near the Dipper and *Ji* constellations, the wheel turns rightward, spewing forth sprouts. Hidden in the depths, images emerge, and radiant essence scatters. Above *Bi* and *Mao*, *zhen* stirs, heralding the inception of *yang* *qi*. The initial nine, the Hidden Dragon, establishes *yang* with three and *yin* with eight, thus connecting them. On the third day, *zhen* moves; on the eighth, *dui* acts. The nine in the second place, the Visible Dragon, embodies harmony and clarity, its virtues perfected. The *qian* body is complete. The nine in the third place, vigilant at dusk, waxes and wanes, its spirit tallying the ebb and flow, gradually transforming until it returns to its origin. *Xun* continues the lineage, firmly grasping its borders. The nine in the fourth place, leaping or retreating, treads a perilous path. *Gen* governs advance and retreat, forbidding transgression of the appointed time. On the twenty-third day, it holds to its allotted period. The nine in the fifth place, the Flying Dragon, ascends to heaven’s throne, its joy unmatched. The six in the fifth place, *kun*’s embrace, binds the beginning and end, nurturing all beings as the eternal mother. When *yang*’s numbers are exhausted, they recommence, emotions aligning with nature, turning to unite. The nine in the top place, the Exalted Dragon, battles in the wilds. The *yong* of nine, soaring as the Dao’s compass, follows the celestial sphere’s revolutions, ascending and descending, circulating without end. The six lines defy easy scrutiny, for they lack fixed positions—such is the *Yi*’s ancestral origin.

This again describes the fire-times within a lunar month, using the *qian* hexagram’s six lines to illustrate *yang* *qi*’s waxing and waning. The Dipper and *Ji* refer to the northeast, while *Bi* and *Mao* denote due west—borrowing heaven’s directions to describe earth’s, not implying heaven’s northeast or west. The "six in the fifth place" may be a scribal error for "twenty-six," as *kun* governs from the twenty-sixth day onward. The following passage on the *yong* of nine mirrors the earlier discussion of *qian* and *kun*’s dual applications.

At the new moon’s dawn, *Fu* arises—*yang* *qi* first flows, entering and exiting without hindrance. Erect the gnomon: subtle yet firm, the Yellow Bell establishes *zi*, its omen flourishing and manifest. Scattering warmth, it nurtures the tender and steams the masses, attaining constancy. Tending the furnace, it unfurls branches and opens paths, its radiance pure, growing ever brighter with each passing day. At *chou*, the Great Regulator coalesces, its pitch rising and falling to form *Tai*. Hard and soft flourish together, *yin* and *yang* unite—what was small departs, what is great arrives, converging at *yin* to advance with the season. Gradually traversing *Dazhuang*, it flanks the *mao* gate; elm pods fall, returning to their root. Punishment and virtue contend, day and night first divide.

At *Guai*, *yin* retreats as *yang* ascends, washing and cleansing feathers and wings, shaking off the dust of old lodgings. *Qian*’s vigor, resplendent and vast, spreads to the four neighbors, *yang* culminating at the center of *si*. *Gou* begins its thread, treading frost—the first wellspring’s chill. At *wu*, *Ruibin* serves *yin*, for *yin* is now host. *Dun* withdraws from its position, gathering its essence, cherishing virtue, awaiting the hour. It lingers in repose.

At *Pi*, closure and obstruction: what sprouts does not grow. *Yin* extends, *yang* contracts, *yang*’s name and form vanish. Observing its measures, weighing mid-autumn’s mood, it bears the young, the tender, the old, the withered—all revive. Shepherd’s purse and wheat sprout anew, shrouded in life’s mantle.

At *Bo*, limbs rot, form dissolves, *qi* transforms and depletes, spirit’s path exhausted—it returns to *Kun*’s origin. Ever compliant with earth’s principle, it receives heaven’s decree, spreading afar, profound and distant, yet linked across barriers. It nurtures all, the source of *yin* and *yang*, boundless and indistinct, its beginning unknowable. First lost, then guiding; later, the sovereign. No level ground remains uninclined—such is the Dao’s natural flux, its ceaseless alternation of waxing and waning, mutually engendering. *Kun* ends, *Fu* begins, like tracing an endless ring. Emperors and kings inherit and govern for millennia—this is how the twelve hexagrams finely divide a month’s *huohou*, and likewise a year’s.

A month’s method: two and a half days per hexagram. *Fu* is *Zhen*’s *Kun*; *Lin* is *Dui*’s *Kun*; *Tai* is *Qian*’s *Kun*; *Dazhuang* is *Qian*’s *Zhen*; *Guai* is *Qian*’s *Dui*; *Qian* is *Qian*’s *Qian*; *Gou* is *Qian*’s *Xun*; *Dun* is *Qian*’s *Gen*; *Pi* is *Qian*’s *Kun*; *Guan* is *Kun*’s *Xun*; *Bo* is *Kun*’s *Gen*; *Kun* is *Kun*’s *Kun*. *Lin* is *Fu*’s *Zhen*; *Dazhuang* is *Fu*’s *Dui*; *Qian* is *Fu*’s *Qian*; *Dun* is *Fu*’s *Xun*; *Guan* is *Fu*’s *Gen*; *Kun* is *Kun*’s *Kun*. The principles of extrapolation employ hexagram names, pitch names, and celestial stems—*fucou* is *Taicu*, *xialie* is *Jiazhong*, *xizhuo* is *Guxi*, *zhong* is *Zhonglü*, *moshu* is *Linshen*, *shen* is *shen*, *renxu* is *Nanlü*, *ge* is *hai*, *ying* is *Yingzhong*. Most are metaphorical allusions, not to be scrutinized deeply.

The phrase "later the sovereign" should read "after studying the *Yi*, one attains sovereignty"—the error has persisted long.

To cultivate nature, prolong life, and forestall aging, one must first reflect on origins. The body one inherits is originally undifferentiated, its primordial essence dispersed, borne by *qi*, its measure set by *yin* and *yang*. Here dwell *hun* and *po*: *yang* spirit is the sun’s *hun*, *yin* spirit the moon’s *po*. *Hun* and *po* serve as each other’s abodes. Nature presides within, establishing boundaries; emotion operates without, building walls and ramparts. When walls and ramparts are whole, beings find peace.

At this time, emotion aligns with *Qian* and *Kun*: *Qian* moves and straightens, *qi* spreads, essence flows; *Kun* is still and receptive, the Dao’s dwelling. The firm retreats, the soft transforms and nourishes. Nine returns, seven reverses, eight reverts, six resides—male is white, female red. Metal and fire restrain each other, then water settles. Fire is the first of the Five Phases, the highest good like water, clear and flawless—the Dao’s form, the True One, hard to depict. Changing and dispersing, each dwells alone, like a chicken’s egg: black and white conjoined, an inch in diameter, the beginning. Limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones take shape, enduring ten months before emerging from the womb—bones pliable as silk, flesh smooth as lead.

This mirrors the earlier "Knowing the White" and "Pivot of the Yellow Cart," speaking of human birth as the union of *yin* and *yang*. Now, to forge the elixir, one proceeds likewise. All references to the Dao are veiled names for the elixir. "Lead" may be a corruption of "maltose," a phonetic error.

The solar mirror gathers fire—without the sun, no light is born. The moon’s vessel yields no water without stars. These two *qi*, though distant, still resonate—how much more so when near, dwelling close to heart and chest? *Yin* and *yang* pair with sun and moon; water and fire serve as proof.

The three treasures—eyes, ears, mouth—must be firmly sealed, not vented. The true person lurks in the deep abyss, floating and roaming, guarding the compass’s center, circling and bending to survey. Opening and closing align, the axle and linchpin their own. Movement and stillness never cease; *li* *qi* internally guards and protects. *Kan* is not used for hearing, *dui* does not speak—few words accord with the primordial chaos. These three are the key. Relax the body, dwell in an empty chamber, entrust your will to emptiness, make non-thought your constant. Proof is unshakable; the heart, undistracted, does not stray. In sleep, spirit embraces spirit; upon waking, it awaits presence or absence. The countenance gradually moistens, bones and joints grow ever stronger. Repelling the host of *yin* demons, one then establishes true *yang*, cultivating it without cease. The bedchamber’s *qi* becomes clouds and rain, flowing gently like spring’s moisture, trickling like melting ice—from head to feet, then back upward, ascending and descending through the boundless cavern. Flourishing within, this is the Dao’s verification. Weakness is virtue’s handle. Weed and hoe old impurities, even the minute, to attain harmony. The turbid’s path: long obscured, then bright.

This passage concerns the work of nurturing the root—especially vital.

Those who favor petty arts do not discern the Dao’s depth, abandoning the true for the deviant. Seeking speed, they block their path, like the blind without a staff, the deaf hearing music, diving for pheasants and hares, climbing mountains for fish and dragons, planting wheat to harvest millet, or using a compass to seek squares. Exhausting spirit and strength, they see no results year after year.

To know the method of ingesting the elixir: it is simple, not cumbersome. The sun’s flowing pearl ever seeks to leave; suddenly, golden blossoms arise, transforming and intermingling to become a white liquid, congealing into hardness. The golden blossom first initiates; in a moment, it dissolves into the Water Horse’s teeth, wilted and dry. *Yang* then proceeds to harmonize nature and emotion, naturally pressing forward. *Yin* constrains and binds, like a kind mother nurturing, a filial son repaying kindness, a stern father issuing commands to discipline descendants. The Five Phases clash and prevail, relying on each other to generate fire. Fire’s nature melts metal; metal chops wood. The three, five, and one—heaven and earth’s purest essence—can be transmitted orally but not in writing.

You should turn right at *wu*, then rotate east at *mao* and *you*, where boundaries divide. The host stabilizes two names: the dragon calls to the tiger, the tiger inhales the dragon’s essence. Both drink and eat, mutually coveting, chasing and biting, swallowing each other. Mars guards the west, Venus traverses the sky—where killing *qi* descends, what does not topple? Foxes and dogs guard the pass; birds and sparrows fear the goshawk. Each has its function—how dare they make a sound?

Without grasping the principle, idle talk is futile. Exhausting family wealth, leaving wife and children destitute—from ancient times to now, countless have pursued this, yet few succeed. Broadly seeking fame, delighting in what contradicts the Dao—if you truly encounter it, observe its threads, compare and measure things from beginning to end. The Five Phases overcome each other, alternating as father and mother. The mother contains nourishing fluids; the father bestows essence, congealing form. Metal and stone do not decay. Focused and undivided, not leaking—this is the way to achieve the Dao.

Those who study petty arts labor without result; those who attain this method find it simple, not cumbersome. The following, from "The Sun’s Flowing Pearl" onward, mirrors the earlier "Knowing the White," "Pivot of the Yellow Cart," and other chapters. The Five Phases engender each other—this is the kindness of mother and child.

Fire and Metal overcome each other—this is the stern command of the father. The "Three and Five" refers to Fire, Metal, Wood, and the Five, all receiving the qi of Earth. Another interpretation holds that the "Three and Five" are the Zi, Wu, Wu, and Si of the earlier chapter. Yet another view remains unclear, or suggests that "as" should read "with" in the following passage, aligning with the "Three and Five" below—while "east" should be "left." This speaks of the fixed positions of yin and yang.

The six lines on Dragon and Tiger express the kindness of mother and child. From "Mars and Venus" onward, the eight lines describe the stern command of the father. Those who fail to grasp the principle and broadly seek the elixir of fame pursue external alchemy. Comparing and measuring things, as in the earlier chapter, the Eight Stones serve as the fundamental standard.

Setting up a pole casts a shadow; calling into a valley echoes a response—how can this not be efficacious? Yet the supreme images of Heaven and Earth, if treated carelessly—like a single *ye* herb or a liang of croton entering the throat—will cause one to stiffen, unable to bend or straighten. At such a time, even if King Wen cast yarrow stalks, Confucius interpreted omens, Bian Que wielded needles, or Wu Xian beat drums, how could they revive the fallen or restore the dead to swift movement?

By the riverside, the radiant maiden is most divine: when she obtains fire, she flies away, leaving no dust or trace. Dragons and demons hide, their whereabouts unknown. To restrain her, yellow sprouts serve as the root. No thing lacks yin and yang; to defy Heaven and oppose the source is like a fat hen hatching her chicks—why are they not whole? Because the union is incomplete: the Three and Five do not meet, hardness and softness remain apart, and the essence of transformation scatters. The natural order of Heaven and Earth—fire rising and flaming upward, water flowing and moistening downward—requires no teacher to guide it. The origin and governance of things cannot be altered.

When male and female unite, hardness and softness bind inseparably, attaining their proper rhythm without need for craft or control. Just as a boy is born prone and a girl supine, so too do they receive qi from the womb and placenta—not merely at birth, but even in death, they mirror this pattern. This is not taught by parents; it is determined at the moment of union. Kan (the male) is the Moon, Li (the female) the Sun. The Sun bestows virtue; the Moon spreads its light. The Moon receives the Sun’s transformation, its body unharmed. If yang loses its bond, yin encroaches upon its brightness; at conjunction and new moon, they press close, enveloping one another. Yang’s form wanes; yin’s encroachment brings calamity.

Male and female depend on each other, inhaling and exhaling to nourish; male and female intermingle, seeking one another. When Metal transforms into Water, Water’s nature circulates restlessly. When Fire transforms into Earth, Water cannot flow. Thus, the male moves outward, the female remains within. If overflowing exceeds measure, the female restrains him; the po checks the hun, preventing excess. Neither cold nor heat, advancing and retreating in harmony—each attains balance, both emitting confirming signs.

The analogy of poison’s power to kill and yellow sprouts’ power to restrain the radiant maiden illustrates external alchemy, here referring to cinnabar. Yet its precise meaning remains unclear. The passage beginning "No thing lacks yin and yang" clarifies the principles of things: for this method, the union of yin and yang is fundamental.

Cinnabar is the essence of Wood, and when it obtains Metal, they merge. Where Metal and Water unite, Wood and Fire become companions. These four, in primordial chaos, array as Dragon and Tiger: the Dragon is yang, odd in number; the Tiger is yin, even in number. The Liver, green, is the father; the Lungs, white, the mother; the Kidneys, black, the child; the Spleen, yellow, the ancestor. Three things form a family, all converging in Wu and Si. Hardness and softness alternate, traversing their divisions. The Dragon lies west, the Tiger east; the warp is established at Mao and You. Punishment and virtue guard each other, meeting in joy. Punishment subdues killing; virtue governs generation. In the second month, the elm dies when the Demon Star nears Zi and Mao; in the eighth month, wheat sprouts when the Celestial Stem stands at You. Zi is south, Wu is north—they serve as the fundamental standard. The numbers nine and one cycle endlessly, beginning anew. Embracing the original and holding to the true, they sow essence in the child.

*"Guan guan go the ospreys, on the isle in the river. The modest, retiring, virtuous young lady: for our prince a good mate she."* The male does not dwell alone; the female does not live in solitude. The Dark Warrior, tortoise and snake coiled together, illustrate the mutual dependence of male and female. If two women share a chamber, their beauty exquisite, even if Su Qin speaks persuasively, Zhang Yi arranges the match, their hair unbound and tongues eloquent, their words sweet and hearts in harmony—urging them to wed—their hair will rot and teeth decay before they know each other. If herbs and minerals are not of the same kind, their names and categories differ, their proportions misaligned, their standards lost—even if the Yellow Emperor tends the furnace, the Great One descends to sit, the Eight Lords pound and grind, Huainan holds the fire and erects the hall, the altar is raised with jade steps, unicorn jerky and phoenix腊 are offered, registers are held and prayers kneeling recited, spirits and gods entreated, ghosts implored, with bathing and fasting—all in vain hope—it is like applying glue to a cauldron to heal a wound, adding ice to remove cold, or using hot water to fly tortoises and dance snakes: the result is only greater disorder.

"Cinnabar is the essence of Wood, and when it obtains Metal, they merge" echoes the earlier chapter’s "radiant maiden and yellow sprouts." The two chapters on the red heart and yellow spleen are absent in some versions; it is unclear which is correct. The lines on Dragon and Tiger, Zi and Wu intersecting in their positions, and the passage beginning *"Guan guan"* further clarify that herbs and minerals not of the same kind are like two women.

**Later Chapter**

Only the sages and worthies of old embraced the mysterious and held to the true, ingesting the nine-times-cycled elixir. Their traces transformed, dragons and fishes concealed; they contained essence and nurtured spirit, penetrating virtue’s three origins. Essence and fluids converged in their principles, sinews and bones became firm. All evil was repelled; vital qi remained constant. Through long accumulation, they changed form and became immortals.

Grieving for later generations who love the Dao, they followed the winds and gathered traces, inscribing ancient texts and creating diagrams to reveal the branches and leaves while concealing the root. They entrusted names to various stones, veiling the workings of internal yin and yang. Scholars who obtained these texts stored them in caskets, passing them down through generations. Sons followed fathers, grandsons succeeded ancestors—yet through the ages, confusion reigned, and none perceived the truth. Thus, officials failed in their duties, farmers neglected their fields, merchants abandoned their goods, and scholars impoverished their families. I lament this deeply.

This record is concise, its principles simple, its affairs unburdensome. Its clauses are laid out, its facts verifiable, its weights and measures precise. Following one another, they form a tangled web of words, their gates and apertures obscure. The wise will ponder deeply and compare them with intent.

The immortals of old wrote books to instruct others but did not speak plainly of their methods, instead using the names of stones to signify the internal workings of yin and yang. Thus, many scholars lost the thread. This book is written to be brief and easily understood, yet I still fear its secrets may leak. Therefore, I have filled it with misleading and disordered words, obscuring its gates and apertures. The following songs distill the book’s essential meaning.

*(Note: The appended disordered words resemble the "Luan" section of the* Li Sao. *See below.)*

No image is greater than Heaven and Earth;
The mysterious gully spans ten thousand li.
The Drum Star nears the Starry Sequence—
The people all tremble in fear.
Shadows recklessly advance and retreat;
Nine years of misfortune befall.
The August Emperor gazes upon it—
The king retreats and reforms himself.
The key has its highs and lows;
Harmful qi flees in haste.
The rivers and Huai run dry—
Waters flow into the sea.

This passage speaks of the calamity of floods overflowing. If the king can reform himself, harmful qi will cease, and water and earth will be balanced. The "mysterious gully" refers to the Celestial River; "Drum Star" is a star’s name; "Starry Sequence" is the position of *chou*. Its meaning remains unclear. "Nine years" refers to the Great Flood. "Key has its highs and lows" signifies the ascent and descent of yin and yang. "Harmful qi" is the qi of disaster, illustrated through the analogy of the human body—also representing the unbalanced interaction of water and fire.

*(Appended: Zhu Xi says, "The 'mysterious gully' and 'harmful qi' likely refer to matters within the human body, serving as metaphorical language. The *Biography of Wang Mang* states, 'The harmful qi is about to be exhausted.' The above text describes the disaster of floods, and if the king reforms, harmful qi departs, and the floods subside. 'Harm' was mistakenly written as *zhou*, then further corrupted to *gu*; later scholars erroneously altered it to 'essence' and added the word 'increase,' both incorrect. However, the character *zhou* reveals its origin as 'harm,' for their seal and ancient scripts are similar.)*

Heaven and Earth as female and male,
Wander between *zi* and *wu*, *yin* and *shen*.
Yin and yang’s origin,
Enters and exits, completes its beginning and end.
Following the Dipper’s handle in its sweep,
Grasping the balance to fix the primal order.
Ascending and roasting on Mount Zeng,
The blazing fire spreads below.
The White Tiger leads the way,
The Azure Fluid harmonizes behind.

*(Appended: Zhu Xi says, "Tiger was once written as *yu*, once as *fan*. All three are borrowed names. The next line speaks of 'azure fluid,' so if this is *yu* or *fan*, and the preceding text mentions 'magnet' (*yu ci*), then *yu* is appropriate. Yet the following line mentions the 'Vermilion Bird' and lists the names and positions of the Three Beasts, so this should be 'Tiger,' and 'fluid' should be 'Dragon.' 'Leads the way' corresponds to the earlier 'roasting pivot,' while 'harmonizes behind' seems to refer to sentient beings. Thus, using Dragon and Tiger is fitting. This passage describes refining water with fire, then restraining fire with water, uniting Metal and Water to return to the original state.")*

The Vermilion Bird soars and plays,
Its feathers gleam with five hues.
Encountering nets and snares spread,
It is pressed down, unable to rise.
Its wails are mournful,
Like an infant longing for its mother.
Overturned into the boiling cauldron,
Its feathers and plumage are crushed and broken.
Before half a *ke* has passed,
Dragon scales stir in restless motion.
Five-colored forms dazzle,
Transforming without constancy.
The bubbling cauldron boils fiercely,
Surging violently without cease.
Layered and piled in disarray,
Like interlocking dog’s teeth.
Its form resembles midwinter ice,
With stalactites jutting forth.
Towering and jumbled together,
They accumulate and prop each other up.
When yin and yang find their match,
They settle in tranquil harmony.
The Azure Dragon dwells in House Six,
Spring blossoms in the east at *mao*.
The White Tiger resides in *You* Seven,
Autumn’s edge in the west at *you*.
The Vermilion Bird in *Zhang* Two,
The true yang of *Li* in the south at *wu*.
When all three come to court,
Their kin become companions.
Originally two things,
In the end, they become three and five.
Three and five unite with one,
All gathering at the second place of governance.
As described above,
The days are counted, first white, then yellow,
With red permeating inside and out.
This is called the First Cauldron,
Its nourishment like grains of millet.

This again summarizes the method of returning the elixir, distilling its essence. *Zi* and *wu* signify *qian* and *kun*; *yin* and *shen* signify *kan* and *li*. "Ascending and roasting" refers to the "roasting pivot" and steaming. The White Tiger is Metal; the Azure Dragon is Water; the Vermilion Bird is Fire. Metal generates Water, and Water extinguishes Fire to form the elixir—its form is thus. The earlier "first fluid, then congealing" and "horse’s teeth in disarray" describe this. The "mournful wails" correspond to the earlier "day and night, the sound ever earnest." When yin and yang find their match and settle in tranquil harmony, it means "each guards its domain, dwelling alone." *House* is among the seven eastern lodges, with six as its degree. *You* Seven and *Zhang* Two—these two things are yin and yang. Three and five are Fire, Metal, and Wood, all receiving the qi of Earth. "Unite with one" and "gather at the second place" require careful interpretation of the text, though the meaning of "first white" and "all" remains unclear.

What nature does,
Is free from deceit or falsehood.
The qi of mountains and marshes steams,
Rising as clouds to become rain.
When mud dries, it turns to dust;
When fire dies, it becomes earth.
Like the yellow dye from *nie*,
Or indigo making green,
Boiling hides to make glue,
Or fermenting yeast to brew wine—
Though their transformations differ,
Without the proper method, skill is in vain.

*(This illustrates the above principles.)*

Only this wondrous art,
Is precise and free from deception.
Passed down to countless generations,
It shines clearly for posterity,
Radiant as the starry Han,
Luminous as the sea’s source.
Ponder it thoroughly,
Review it again and again, a thousand times over.
Brilliant and resplendent,
After ten thousand repetitions, it becomes visible.
The divine may reveal it to you,
Or your spirit may suddenly awaken.
Seek its threads and origins,
And you will find its gate and door.
The Dao of Heaven is impartial,
Yet it is always transmitted to the worthy.

This passage clarifies the book’s intent: if scholars read it a thousand times, ten thousand times, they will naturally understand, as if the divine had instructed them. Dong Yu said, "Read a book a thousand times, and its meaning will become clear." He also said, "Ponder it, ponder it again, and ponder it further. If you still do not grasp it, ghosts and spirits will teach you—not by their power, but by the extremity of your spirit. This is no idle talk."

The Five Mutual Reflections:
*(This text has five chapters: one, the* Cantong Qi*; two, the* Taiyi*; three, the* Xiangbi*; four, the* Kuiguo*; five, the* Weishi*.)*

The *Cantong Qi* presents an outline,
Yet it is not entirely complete, with omissions and gaps.
Now I have compiled and supplemented it,
Filling its lacunae, refining its profundities,
Drawing connections to ensure coherence,
Aligning its intent and equalizing its aims,
So that its purpose remains unobstructed.
Thus, I have composed this *Five Mutual Reflections*,
In which the nature and emotions of the *Taiyi* are fully expressed.
The nature and emotions of the *Taiyi* each follow their measure.
The Yellow Emperor and Laozi explored and compared them,
And the art of furnace and fire has true basis.
The Three Ways emerge from the One,
Their paths, branches, flowers, leaves, and fruits
All depend on the root.
Do not lose your original sincerity.
What I have spoken is careful and without error.

The image of midwinter,
When bamboo and trees are broken and harmed,
Assists yang in interrogating *shang*.
The traveler and the lord deeply conceal themselves,
Following the season’s rhythm.
Seal your lips, do not speak of the Dao of Heaven—
It is vast and boundless,
Too profound for form or description,
Empty and still, beyond perception.
Its framework fades away,
Preventing errors and lost threads.
Speak separately of these Four Images
To enlighten later generations who are blind.

This describes the time between the dark and new moons,
When chaos and the primordial mist take form and hide.
The *Taiyi* is without form,
The highest good like water,
The true unity difficult to depict.
The Four Images remain unclear.

The rustic from Kuai, a humble man of secluded valleys,
【*Zhu Xi notes: "Wei Junshi of Shangyu—should read 'Fang Ji' or perhaps 'Wei Kui' in the dialect; the text writes 'Kuai'"*】
Clasped simplicity and plainness, untouched by fleeting glory.
Dwelling in obscurity, he disregarded fame,
Holding fast to tranquility, indifferent to worldly ease.
A wanderer in distant lands, at leisure in the halls of Yan,
He composed this text, chanting the *Great Ease*—
The three sages’ bequeathed words.
Examining its hidden purport, he saw all things united in one principle,
Striving to align with reason, to illumine the spirit,
That its numinous transformation might flow freely,
Bringing peace to the four seas.
He set it forth as a model for ten thousand generations to follow,
A guide for governance, effortless in practice.

Inwardly cultivating nature,
He embraced the natural Way of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi,
Holding profound virtue within.
Returning to the root, reverting to the origin—
It lies near in the heart, inseparable from the self.
Embracing the One, never forsaking it,
One may endure forever.
Paired with dietary arts—
The male and female principles arrayed,
The eight minerals of Wudu refined and cast aside—
Discern their use, and success is achieved.
What the world treasures, he laid out in three branches,
Stems and twigs intertwined,
All emerging from a single gate under different names.

Not merely ornate phrases in harmonious pairs,
This text holds its truth—
Grit and gravel may be observed,
While I, in spreading falsehoods, am burdened with excess faults.
The *Cantong Qi*’s subtle threads I barely glimpse,
Its words few, its meaning vast.
Later descendants should heed and entrust themselves to the times,
Avoiding harm, relying on the mountains,
Roaming the boundless expanse,
Neighbors to spirits,
Transforming their forms to become immortals,
Merging with silence, soundless.
Once in a hundred generations, they descend to wander among men,
Displaying their feathered wings,
East and west, south and north, they incline—
Tang met with calamity,
Water and drought divided,
Branches and leaves withered and yellowed,
Losing their flourishing splendor.
The fortunate ride in comfort,
Secure and steadfast, they may attain long life.

**Song of the Cauldron**
Round, three by five *cun*, its mouth one *fen* wide,
Four *liang* and eight *qian* in weight, its rim two *chi* long,
Even in thickness.
Its belly threefold aligned, seated and suspended,
Ever warm.

**Variations and Annotations**
Two *chi* is sometimes written as one *chi* and two *cun*; Peng Xiao interprets it as two *chi*. The "three alignments" are sometimes written as "alignments three." *Qi* (齐) here denotes the *navel*.

Yin above, yang below—rushing forth:
These two lines are the essential method.

Head and tail martial, the center civil;
Yin fire, white and yellow sprouts;
Lead and mercury, the seven apertures as aids;
The human gallbladder governs the brain, settling the ascent.
The *Xuanzi* abides in the center, secure and preserved.
Coming and going, roaming yet never leaving the gate,
Gradually the great nature is perfected,
The temperament pure, returning to the One,
Restoring the original source.
One cycle is most arduous—
Guard closely, guard against confusion,
Lest the path grow distant and the mystery profound.
Should one attain this, the joy of Heaven and Earth in the Dao—
Seek its root, examine the Five Phases,
Weigh each *zhū* and *fēn* with care,
Reflect deeply—no need for further discourse.
Conceal it, preserve it, do not transmit it.
Mount the white crane, ride the scaled dragon,
Roam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lords,
Receive the celestial charts, be named a Perfected One.

**Colophon and Postface to the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* with Textual Variants**

The *Cantong Qi* is coarse in diction yet vast in Dao; its words subtle, its warnings profound. It arrays the Five Emperors to establish enterprise and matches the Three Sovereigns to institute governance. Though lord and minister differ in rank, above and below lack fixed order, yet in ordering governance, great peace is not attained. The methods of ingesting elixirs cannot confer long life; learning to nurture nature does not extend years. Yet in dissecting yin and yang, harmonizing their weights, the waxing and waning of the sun and moon, the images of the Eight Trigrams, the transformations of male and female, the movements of hard and soft, the divisions of activity and stillness—all are judged by the classics, their intent robust. Thus, it sets forth a method to transmit to later worthies. Only those who fathom the great image may attain long life, strengthen the self, and benefit the body. Those who pursue this Dao must apply their minds with gravity.

This appears to be a postface appended to the commentary, composed by a later hand. The original commentary is lost, and only the preface remains. "Setting forth a method" (*lì fǎ*) was likely a scribal error for "setting forth a commentary" (*lì zhù*).

**Appended Note by Master Zhu [Xi]**
Some say this is the postface; others, that it is Wei Jun’s eulogy. The style and meaning suggest it is a postface to the commentary. Peng Xiao’s preface states: "Wei Jun secretly showed it to Xu, the Attendant of Qingzhou, who annotated it." Xu’s given name was Lü, and he provided the commentary. This may be Xu’s own words, for his commentary no longer survives.

**Right: *Zhouyi Cantong Qi* by Wei Boyang**
Wei Jun was a man of the Later Han. The title of his work likely imitates the style of apocryphal texts. Its diction and rhymes are archaic and elegant, difficult to comprehend. Superficial readers rashly alter it, so it contains more errors than other books. Here, I have collated various editions and corrected them against one another. Many passages remain obscure and cannot be fully resolved; I have recorded what I know as a definitive version, preserving all variants for further comparison.

—Zou Fang of Kongtong Daoist Abbey

**Appended Note**
The name "Zou Fang" was borrowed by Master Zhu as a pseudonym. *Zou* was originally the state of Zhu in the Spring and Autumn period. In the *Record of Music*, "Heaven and Earth *xié* in harmony," Zheng’s commentary reads: "*Xié* should be *xī*."

**Appended Note by Master Zhu [Xi]**
Examining the *Wei Shu*, it begins with the four trigrams Qian, Kun, Kan, and Li as the bellows and key, then proceeds to the sixty hexagrams of Zhun and Meng to illustrate the early and late stages of daily practice. Next, it discusses the six hexagrams of Na Jia to show the advance and retreat of daily practice, followed by the twelve sovereign hexagrams, which divide the six Na Jia hexagrams into two, detailing the monthly nodes internally while encompassing the yearly work externally. Such is its use of the *Yi* as a framework—nothing more. It never addresses the three hundred eighty-four lines.

The fire-phase methods transmitted today take the three hundred eighty-four lines as the count of one celestial cycle, with each line governing one day. Since the lines exceed the days, four hexagrams and twenty-four lines are removed, awaiting the arrival of the twenty-four qi to gradually add them. This no longer accords with the natural harmony of the system. Moreover, the lines used each day—whether yin or yang—lack order, and it is unclear how the practice distinguishes them. Furthermore, within a single day, the count already completes three hundred sixty, yet the addition of one qi corresponds to only one line. The imbalance in weight and measure is evident. The twenty-four additions and subtractions proceed by minute increments or abrupt reductions, lacking the cyclical rhythm of advance and retreat. This is likely a later invention, not the original intent of Wei Jun.

I suspect the crux of this book lies in the two trigrams Kan and Li. If one grasps their essential principles, the timing of the practice—though not explicitly stated by Wei Jun—can be inferred. As long as the periods of early and late, advance and retreat are not lost, one may proceed without rigid adherence to old interpretations. Thus, I have deduced the method of *fang* numbers, which, though not mentioned by Wei Jun, offers a coherent system. The method of line counts, though also unaddressed, may yet hold some rationale.

The moon is divided into twelve hexagrams, each governing two and a half days. Each hexagram’s lines govern the *fang* of its own hexagram. From the hexagram Guan in the eighth month to the hexagram Tai in the first month, yang employs twenty-eight *fang* of youthful yang, while yin employs twenty-four *fang* of mature yin. From the hexagram Dazhuang in the fourth month to the hexagram Pi in the seventh month, yang employs thirty-six *fang* of mature yang, while yin employs twenty-two *fang* of youthful yin. Yang is the intent in motion; yin is the release into stillness. One line suffices as one opening and closing of qi. The twelve hexagrams of rest constitute one day’s work; the twelve hexagrams’ cycle constitutes one year’s movement. The process repeats endlessly, without excess or deficiency. The numbers are illustrated in a diagram, which I intended to discuss with Ji Tong but never sent before his death.

**Appended Note**
Among Master Zhu’s earlier works that established his scholarly reputation, he never lightly attached himself to the followers of the sages. He considered the *Manyi Yi* to be by Dai Shiyu and the *Guanziming Yi* to be a forgery by Ruan Kan, so rigorously did he uphold authenticity. Yet regarding the *Cantong Qi*, he offered no skeptical remarks. His interpretation of the *Yi* drew heavily from Shaozi, and he acknowledged that Shaozi’s insights derived from Xi Yi, whose lineage traced back to the *Cantong Qi*. Thus, he deferred to its authority.

He once remarked: "I see it clearly in my mind’s eye, but I lack a starting point." And again: "Now I grasp the outline, but I have yet to master the materials, the cavities, the openings." In the ding-si year of the Qingyuan era, Ji Tong was assigned to Daozhou. On the eve of his departure, he stayed at Hanquan, where they revised the *Cantong Qi* together through the night without sleep. Alas! Such was the bond between teacher and disciple, unshaken even in hardship, yet so devoted were they to this text. His resolve to transcend the worldly was unmistakable.

The following year, Ji Tong passed away. Later, he discovered the method of *fang* numbers and regretted not being able to discuss it with Ji Tong. Two years later, the Master himself died.

Thus, from the very beginning of their master-disciple relationship, the *Cantong Qi* and the *Yinfu Jing* were held in accord with the sages—this is indeed trustworthy. Therefore, when compiling his work, he placed them after the *Taiji* and *Xiantian* diagrams; how could there be any discrepancy? The *Zhouyi Cantong Qi Kaoyi*.
