**The Fifteen Treatises of the Daoist Teachings Established on Double-Ninth Festival**

**First Treatise: Dwelling in the Hermitage**
All who take the path of leaving the home must first seek refuge in a hermitage.
A hermitage is a dwelling—one’s very self leans upon it.
When the body has its resting place, the mind gradually finds peace.
With **qi** and spirit harmonious and unobstructed, one attains the true Dao.

All actions must not be excessive; excess drains **qi**.
Nor must one be entirely inactive—for then **qi** and blood stagnate.
One must balance movement and stillness within moderation,
Only then can one maintain steadfast tranquility.
This is the way of dwelling in the hermitage.

**Second Treatise: Wandering in the Clouds**
There are two kinds of wandering in the Dao:
One is to gaze upon mountains and waters of clarity and splendor,
Or to admire the crimson and verdant hues of flowers and trees.
Some revel in the bustling opulence of prefectures,
Some marvel at the pavilions and halls of temples and observatories;
Some seek friends to indulge their whims,
Some linger for food and clothing.
Such people, though they traverse ten thousand miles,
Exhaust their bodies and weary their spirits,
Searching far and wide for the wonders of the world—
Yet their minds are scattered, their **qi** diminished.
These are but hollow wanderers in the clouds.

The second kind is to probe the nature of life and death,
To seek the wondrous and profound mysteries.
Ascend perilous heights to visit tireless masters of renown,
Cross turbulent waters to question the Dao without satiety.
If but one phrase resonates, a radiant illumination arises within.
Understanding the great matter of birth and death,
One becomes a man of perfect fulfillment.
Such people are true wanderers in the clouds.

**Third Treatise: Studying the Classics**
The way of studying the Classics must not be to chase after words and lose one’s focus.
Instead, one should extract meaning to align with the heart,
Abandon the text to delve into its essence and grasp its principles.
When reason and essence are harmonized, and delight is found,
Then one may truly absorb it into the mind.
With prolonged sincerity, the heart’s light naturally overflows,
And the spirit’s wisdom leaps forth—
Nothing remains unpenetrated, nothing unsolved.
If one reaches this stage, one may cultivate and refine,
But must not indulge in reckless pursuits,
Lest one lose the path of life and death.
If one does not exhaust the true intent of the Classics,
But merely seeks to memorize and recite extensively,
Discussing with others to astonish the learned and clever—
This profits nothing in one’s practice,
And harms the spirit’s vitality.
Though one reads many books, what benefit does it bring to the Dao?
Once the meaning of the Classics is attained,
One should keep it deeply hidden.

**Fourth Treatise: Alchemy and Medicine**
Medicine is the refined **qi** of mountains and rivers,
The essence of grasses and trees.
It can warm or cool, supplement or purge;
It can surface or support.
The skilled alchemist nurtures life’s vitality,
While the mediocre physician harms the body’s form.
Those who study the Dao must not fail to understand medicine.
If one does not understand it, one cannot aid the Dao.
Nor must one cling rigidly—
For then one risks harming one’s **yin** cultivation.
Greed for external wealth depletes the inner treasury of truth.
This is not merely a sin in this life,
But a warning against retribution in the next.
My esteemed disciples, carefully ponder these words.

**Fifth Treatise: Building the Hermitage**
A thatched hut or simple dwelling must suffice to shelter the body;
Sleeping under the open sky or in the wilderness risks exposure to the sun and moon.
If one constructs ornate beams and towering halls,
This is not the deed of a noble seeker.
Grand palaces and lofty chambers—
Are these the livelihood of one who follows the Dao?
Felling trees disrupts the earth’s vital currents,
And hoarding wealth from alchemical arts consumes the blood and **qi** of others.
Only external cultivation is pursued,
While inner refinement is neglected—
Like drawing a cake to satisfy hunger,
Or piling snow to store as grain—
All labor in vain, leading to emptiness.
Those with true resolve should seek the palace within their own body,
And the vermilion towers of their flesh.
If one does not understand how to refine it,
One will see it crumble piece by piece.
The wise and discerning must carefully observe this.

**Tenth Discourse: Harmonizing the Five Qi**
The Five Qi converge in the central palace,
The Three Primordials gather at the crown.
The Azure Dragon exhales crimson mist,
The White Tiger emits black smoke.
Ten thousand deities arrayed,
White veins surge upward.
Cinnabar glows luminous, lead and mercury congeal pure.
Though the body dwells among mortals,
The spirit already roams the heavens.

**Eleventh Discourse: Merging Essence and Qi**
Essence is spirit, qi is vitality.
When essence meets qi,
It is like birds catching the wind—
Lightly ascending, effortless, swiftly accomplished.
As the *Yin Symbol Classic* states: *"To seize it lies in controlling the qi."*
Those cultivating the True Way must ponder this deeply.
Do not reveal it to the unworthy,
Lest divine retribution descend.
Essence and qi are the foundation of cultivation—
Guard them closely and forge them diligently.

**Twelfth Discourse: The Path of the Sage**
To enter the Sage’s Way,
One must endure hardship for years,
Accumulating merit and practice.
Only the enlightened and virtuous
May tread this path.
Though confined to a single chamber,
The essence fills the cosmos.
All heavenly sages silently protect;
The Boundless Immortal Lord subtly surrounds.
One’s name is recorded in the Purple Bureaus,
One’s rank stands among the celestial tiers.
Though the form lingers in dust,
The mind transcends the mundane.

**Thirteenth Discourse: Transcending the Three Realms**
The realms of desire, form, and formlessness—
These are the Three Realms.
When the mind forgets deliberation,
It transcends the realm of desire.
When the mind forgets all phenomena,
It transcends the realm of form.
When the mind clings to void perception,
It transcends the formless realm.
Beyond these three,
The spirit dwells in the land of immortals and sages,
And essence attains the realm of Jade Purity.

**Fourteenth Discourse: Nourishing the Body**
The *Dharmakāya* is formless essence—
Neither empty nor possessed,
Neither bound nor free,
Neither low nor high,
Neither short nor long.
When applied, it permeates all;
When stored, it lies dormant and undetectable.
If one attains this Way,
It may be properly nourished.
The more it is cultivated, the greater the merit;
The less it is tended, the lesser the gain.
Do not cling to return,
Nor to the world—
Departure and abiding come naturally.

**Fifteenth Discourse: Severing the Mundane**
To sever the mundane is not to abandon the body,
But to purify the mind.
The body is like a lotus root,
The mind like its flower—
Rooted in mud yet blooming in empty space.
Those who attain the Way
Dwell in the mundane while their essence soars in the sacred.
Today’s seekers, desiring immortality and severance from the mundane,
Are greatly deluded, failing to grasp the truth.
The Fifteenth Discourse warns those with resolve in the Gate:
Examine this deeply and know it well.
