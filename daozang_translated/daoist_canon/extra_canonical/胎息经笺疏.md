# 胎息经笺疏

**The Scripture of Embryonic Breathing**

The embryo forms from the concealed qi,
And qi breathes within the formed embryo.
Qi enters the body to give life;
Spirit departs from form to bring death.
Knowing that spirit and qi can grant long life,
Firmly abide in emptiness and non-being
To nurture spirit and qi.
Where spirit moves, qi moves;
Where spirit rests, qi rests.
If you desire long life,
Let spirit and qi pour into one another.
The heart stirs no thought,
Neither coming nor going,
Neither exiting nor entering—
Naturally, they remain constant.
Diligently practice this,
And it is the true Way.

The above scripture contains eighty-three characters in seventeen lines.

**Preface to the Annotations and Commentaries**

Since childhood, I have been plagued by illness and lacked the wisdom to align with things and delight in heaven. Constantly anxious about the realm of life and death, I have studied all manner of cultivation arts, Daoist and Buddhist teachings, hoping to prolong life, secure my form, and transcend to attain fruition.

Yet, reflecting on these many years, the more I learned, the more my practice sprawled, increasingly at odds with the principle of daily diminution. I was well aware of this.

On the twenty-fifth day of winter in 1951—fifteenth day of the twelfth lunar month—idle and without occupation, I pondered: after half a lifetime of Daoist study, what benefit have I gained? When impermanence arrives, how shall I respond? Startled, I resolved to rectify past errors and practice with utmost effort.

But what should my practice be based upon?
Carefully considering the various Daoist texts, those that are false and erroneous need not be mentioned.

Among the rest, though not false or erroneous, some are excessively abstruse in their doctrines (such as the *Can Tong Qi* and *Wu Zhen Pian*), while others are fragmented and devoid of essentials (like the vast majority of texts in the *Daoist Canon*). Seeking one that could serve as a model for beginners, with content precise and concise enough to serve as a foundation for realization, perhaps none surpasses the *Classic of Embryonic Breathing*. Regrettably, the commentaries and Master Huan Zhen’s annotations are both inadequate. Thus, I resolved to consult the essential teachings of various schools and compile my own annotations, both to guide my own practice and to cross-verify with Esoteric Buddhist teachings. However, in recent years, my engagement in compiling medical texts and Buddhist scriptures has left this intention long deferred. Now, fortunately, both endeavors are largely complete, allowing me to finally undertake this task—such is the origin of these annotations.

Furthermore, I note the words left by the Perfected Min Xiao Gen: *"To delight in needless difficulty is to waste a lifetime; to indulge in strange and ostentatious practices is utterly futile. Only this ordinary Way holds the secret of returning to the source. In three hundred days, the garden is ever luminously clear."* How excellent these words are! They resonate deeply with my own heart.

What the scriptures attest to reveals that among the nineteen Daoist texts of the *Daozong shu*, the *Xingming guizhi* conceals the "Qi Cavity Section" beneath its passages, where this segment is titled *The Embryonic Breathing Sutra of Patriarch Bodhidharma*. At first glance, its spuriousness is evident. Thus, when the Perfected Wu Chongxu cites the opening two lines in *The True Principle of Celestial Immortality*, he refers to it simply as the *Ancient Embryonic Breathing Sutra* without attributing an author. Since the *Xingming guizhi* was published in the Wanli era of the Ming, and *The True Principle* dates from the same period, this scripture may well have been fabricated by a Song or Yuan adept knowledgeable in the Dao, falsely ascribed to Bodhidharma.

**The Aim of the Scripture**
The essence of this sutra is none other than Internal Alchemy. Internal Alchemy is the Yin Elixir, a concoction harmonized within one’s own body without reliance on external agents—also termed the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir (though the Southern School defines "Jade Fluid" as the post-foundation work of gathering medicine to form the Elixir, hence the distinction marked by "also"). In truth, it is the practice of cultivating one’s nature.

While the fruition of Daoist practice is ultimately one, the entry points are manifold. Some cultivate alone, some rely on medicinal substances, some depend on crucibles and vessels, and some employ all three methods in varying degrees. Among those using vessels, some work solely with the Tiger, while others engage both Dragon and Tiger. Though the paths differ in depth, this stems from the varying root capacities and karmic virtues of practitioners. Yet, in the end, none can achieve great attainment without the convergence of the Three Families.

In this degenerate age, emulating the feats of Jingyang or Zhang Sanfeng is no longer feasible. The only recourse is to fulfill one’s nature to the utmost, ensuring that this shore’s affairs are complete so that the other shore may be readily traversed. This aligns with the words of the Perfected Wen Yi: *"Though form and spirit are said to be difficult to perfect together, one must first fulfill one’s nature before completing one’s destiny."*

Yet, from ancient times to the present, most Dao seekers fail to distinguish between internal and external alchemy, leading to confusion and discord. They overlook that Yin and Yang differ as *within the body*, *of the same kind*, and *of the void*—hence the divergence in elixir methods: Jade Fluid, Golden Fluid, and the Mysterious Pearl. Thus, those who refine Jade may scorn Gold, those who refine Gold may dismiss Jade, and some, though versed in both, remain ignorant of the *Xuan Zhu*’s method of transforming form, achieving at best a corpse-liberation.

Recently, Master Chen Yingning of Wan has clarified this tangle by defining Jade Fluid as the cultivation of the Dao and Golden Fluid as the refinement of the Elixir. He has carved a path of luminous clarity through the confusion, offering seekers a means to distinguish truth amid obscurity. This resonates deeply with my own heart—I am profoundly indebted! Without vast reading and transmission from a profound lineage, how could one grasp this?

Here, I provisionally divide Yin and Yang into three categories—*within the body*, *of the same kind*, and *of the void*—though this is merely one perspective. In truth, the pure Southern School begins with *of the same kind*, progressing from shallow to deep, with each stage differing in method. The pure Northern School practices solitary refinement throughout, though even its "solitary" end is not truly solitary. The Eastern and Western Schools synthesize North and South, entering through the Northern School’s method and attaining fruition through the Southern School’s—such are the distinctions in lineage and method, which must not be overlooked.

Other traditions, like that of Zhang Sanfeng, employ Dragon and Tiger at every step. Li Huiqing’s commentary on the *Cantong qi* and Weng Baoguang’s (Xue’s) commentary on the *Wuzhen pian* (among the Three Commentaries) align closely with this approach. Lu Ziye’s commentary on the *Wuzhen pian*, however, clearly follows the methods of both schools.

Initially, I dismissed these dual approaches as inauthentic, but my study of Esoteric Buddhism revealed my earlier view to be that of a frog in a well. In sum, the Dao of self-cultivation has many gates—*"Wherever there are willows, a horse may be tethered; every household’s door opens onto Chang’an."* With a true teacher and true instructions, every path can lead to fruition; it depends solely on the practitioner’s karmic conditions and the depth of their practice.

**Annotations on the *Embryonic Breathing Sutra***

The ancient immortals said: *"Embryo’ refers to the embryo of spirit; ‘breathing’ refers to the stilling of qi."* Thus, "embryo" denotes the supreme stability of spirit—unmoving, unshaken, free from sorrow or fear, thought or imagination—like an infant nestled in its mother’s womb. "Breathing" denotes the cessation of coarse qi, the halting of external respiration, so that qi is no longer drawn in, and the hundred vessels naturally harmonize in a single radiance.

Know that qi is like water, and spirit is like the moon. The moon’s movement arises from water’s ripples; the spirit’s agitation stems from qi’s pull. When water is still, the moon is bright; when qi is settled, the spirit is wise. In the Jade Fluid Returned Elixir, the practice is nothing other than the embrace of spirit and qi, neither issuing nor entering, like a woman with child.

Only by ensuring that spirit does not leave qi and qi does not leave spirit, each breath interdependent, can one attain great stillness and the Internal Elixir naturally form—hence the title *Embryonic Breathing Sutra*. "Sutra" means the constant Dao: this practice of embryonic spirit and breath is the eternal Way of the Jade Fluid.

Now, "spirit" is called "embryo." Consider pregnancy: after the union of the Two Fives, there is something within the womb, naturally abiding, unceasing in its flow, unbroken in its nurturance. Yet our spirit is restless all day, even in dreams unsettled—how can it hope to hibernate unmoving, vast and luminous?

I have already noted that qi can stir the will, but the principle that the will can stir qi must not be overlooked. For scattered thoughts are not the true heart or true spirit—they are like wind. Water is inherently still, but wind stirs it into ripples. If the wind ceases, the water returns to clarity, and the moon’s reflection shines undisturbed. Thus, the adept eliminates the Three Minds and extinguishes the Four Marks. With delusive thoughts severed, the true spirit (the One Numinous) radiates, and qi naturally returns to its root, neither issuing nor entering.

Shiyi Zi (Wan Qixing) expounds on the method of *zhuanxi* (revolving the breath), saying:

“The Dao abides between Heaven and Earth; from ancient times to the present, it is borne by a single breath. Since the Dao cannot be seen, what may be quietly observed and realized is only this one breath. Yet breath has the true and the ordinary: ordinary breath is respiration, easily known to all, while within ordinary breath lies true breath, known only to those who cultivate the Real. Beyond true breath lies breathlessness, and within breathlessness lies non-breath—only the perfected person can discern these.

At the moment of utmost emptiness and profound stillness, ordinary breath departs and true breath appears. In the depths of boundless obscurity, true breath manifests and breathlessness arises. In the ceaseless, subtle continuity of the moment, breathlessness settles and non-breath revolves. To know the revolving of breath is to know the revolving of consciousness; to know the revolving of consciousness is to know the revolving of the subtlest movement—does this not approach the numinous?

Yet revolving the breath is no simple matter. To know the revolving of breath, one must first know *fenxi* (divided breath); to know divided breath, one must know *lixi* (detached breath); to know detached breath, one must know *hexi* (united breath); to know united breath, one must know *tongxi* (pervading breath). Pervading, it is one; one becomes two, two becomes one. Does this not correspond to what Zhuangzi meant by ‘riding the constancy of Heaven and Earth, steering the transformations of the six qi, and roaming the boundless’?

The above elucidates the classic’s title.

The embryo is formed within subdued qi.
The spirit is like a person; qi is like a horse.
As a horse carries a rider in gallop, so qi pulls the spirit into motion. Thus, if one wishes the spirit to abide in tranquility and freedom, like a pregnant woman carrying a child, nothing can be achieved without subduing the qi and returning it to its root, where it hibernates in concealment.

But where does it return to its root? How is qi subdued?”

Here lies a profound subject for inquiry. Cao Wenyi states: *"Focus the qi to achieve suppleness, and the spirit will abide long."* The *Record of Northern Journeys* recounts: *"I recall my master (referring to Ancestor Qiu) expounding during a state of great samādhi that among all methods of practice, visualization of the lower dantian is paramount—yet it remains but one method, not the Dao itself."* Master Huanzhen’s commentary on the *Embryonic Breathing Classic* notes: *"Three inches below the navel lies the Sea of Qi, also called the lower dantian."*

Furthermore, the lower dantian is where spirit and qi return to their root. Its precise location lies slightly below and behind the navel, though one must not fixate on exact measurements in inches or fractions. Knowing the general area suffices. As the ancients said: *"Behind the navel, before the waist; below the heart, above the kidneys"* (here, "kidneys" refers to the *yinqiao* point). The region between these landmarks should not be rigidly defined.

The *Guidance Within the Compass* discusses the *Mysterious Gate* (*xuanpin*): *"A substance of inch-wide dimension, uniting the Three Powers, situated above the kidneys and below the heart—its interior is vaguely discernible, called the Mysterious Pass. It cannot be grasped with intent, nor sought without intent. To grasp it with intent is to never attain it."*

With intentless seeking, one ultimately reveals its nonexistence—how could this suffice?

For when focus remains undivided, spirit congeals; merely preserve the heart and sever thoughts, regulate the breath to evenness. In serene illumination, avoid dullness or distraction. Await the settling of qi into harmony, and the True Person enters samādhi. Within this samādhi, observe and reflect upon the inner landscape. The moment intent arises, its sign immediately germinates—one then senses a breath emerging from the *Compass Within*, flowing continuously, rising and surging without cease. Preserve it with sincerity, listen with the heart. The six senses settle, fetal breathing congeals, neither forced nor counted, left to its natural course. At the extreme of stillness, exhalation arises like fish in a spring pond; at the extreme of movement, inhalation comes like hibernating insects. With misty opening and closing, its wonders are boundless.

After a brief interval, one must forget the breath and merge with spirit, returning wholly to primordial chaos. At the utmost of emptiness, the deepest stillness is maintained. The heart moves no thought, neither coming nor going, neither exiting nor entering—abiding in profound clarity. This is called the True Person’s breath, where the breath at the heels reaches its deepest culmination. Here, spirit and qi intermingle—this is the sign.

From this arises primordial qi, from this arises true breathing. Where intent reaches, creation is perceived. Where this breath arises, there lies the *Mysterious Pass*. It is neither high nor low, neither left nor right, neither forward nor backward, neither biased nor partial. Within the human body’s microcosm, this is the very center.

Here lies the place of gathering, of union, of refinement, of bathing, of gentle nurturing. Here, the embryo is knit; here, the embryo is shed in spiritual transformation—all occurs within this point. This aperture, where yang expands and yin contracts, has no fixed form. Intent arrives, and it opens; opening and closing occur in due time. After a hundred days, the foundation is laid, the *qi*-mother nurtured. From the empty chamber, light naturally arises. This was the Dao of the Yellow Emperor’s three-month inner contemplation.

According to Master Chen’s discourse, this merges the middle and lower *dantian* in explanation. Yet distinguishing between them is most difficult to grasp. Only Master Min’s *Precious Scroll of the Heavenly Immortal’s Path* elucidates it in detail. He states: *"When not a speck of dust clings, the absence of杂念 is evident. Only when thoughts cease does the breath settle; only when the breath settles does the pass open—this is an immutable principle. Yet there are those for whom a single moment of emptiness and stillness suffices to open it. This is the *qi*-cavity, not the *qi*-aperture. The *qi*-cavity is where ancestral *qi* naturally emerges, while the *qi*-aperture resides within it. When the *qi*-aperture opens, the *Mysterious Pass* unfolds. This is one explanation—few understand it."*

Alas! This is why earthly immortals outnumber heavenly immortals. A deviation by a hair’s breadth leads to an error of a thousand miles. As the saying goes: *"To know the path at the mountain’s foot, ask one who has traversed it."* Without a teacher’s guidance, one may toil in vain until old age, becoming a mere relic. How fortunate I am!

Did not the master say: *"If the *qi*-cavity does not open, there is no gate for advancing the fire. If the *qi*-aperture does not open, the sacred embryo will not form. Forgetting and forgetting again, the *Mysterious Pass* unfolds. It is two yet not two, one yet not one—like a hen brooding an egg, speaking without words."*

Wan Qixing said: *"The *qi*-cavity lies below, the *qi*-aperture above—they share the same point but differ in aperture."* He also said: *"Before the *Mysterious Pass* opens, one concentrates spirit upon the *qi*-cavity, practicing the work of the human element. Once the *Mysterious Pass* opens, one concentrates spirit upon the *qi*-aperture, directly connecting to the heavenly element."*

From this, beginners should take the lower *dantian* and the earthly abdomen as their foundation. When concentrating spirit and gathering *qi*, the *Mysterious Pass* manifests—yet this pass may open or close at times. Thus, it is said: *"When effort is sufficient, it appears; when the mechanism is still, it vanishes."* This is the *kun*-furnace, also called the spirit-furnace, the place where breath begins and ends—truly the *qi*-cavity. Yet it is also named the *Mysterious Pass* because it appears after spirit and *qi* merge, embodying the wondrous mechanism.

However, the true *Mysterious Pass*, also called the *Mysterious Aperture*, only emerges after the *ren* and *du* meridians are unobstructed and the human Dao is fully realized. At the extreme of emptiness and stillness, this aperture appears. Thus, without decades of practice, one cannot speak of its opening. Once opened, it remains so, providing a sanctuary for spirit—hence the *Yellow Chamber* and *spirit abode*. From here, *qi* naturally arises from the *yinqiao*, ascending through the central seam between the spine and the front of the channels, piercing the *niwan* palace as if without ascent or descent. This is precisely the place where the *Yellow Center* connects to the heavens, where heavenly immortals form and shed their embryos.

*Baopuzi* states: *"Thus, practicing *qi* may cure a hundred illnesses, ward off plagues, subdue tigers and snakes, stanch bleeding wounds, dwell underwater, walk upon water, dispel hunger and thirst, or prolong life. Its essence lies in fetal breathing alone. Those who attain fetal breathing need not breathe through nose or mouth, as if within the womb—then the Dao is achieved."*

For beginners practicing *qi*, draw *qi* through the nose and hold the breath, counting silently to one hundred twenty before gently exhaling through the mouth. Both inhalation and exhalation should be so subtle that one’s own ears cannot hear the breath’s passage. Always let inhalation exceed exhalation. Place a goose feather before the nose and mouth—if the breath does not stir it, this is the sign. Gradually increase the count over time, eventually reaching a thousand. At a thousand, the aged grow younger, regaining a day for each day practiced.

One should practice *qi* only during the time of living *qi*, not during dead *qi*. Thus it is said: *"The immortals ingest the six *qi*."* In a day and night, there are twelve hours. From midnight to noon, the six hours are living *qi*; from noon to midnight, the six hours are dead *qi*. Practicing *qi* during dead *qi* yields no benefit.

One skilled in the use of *qi* may, by exhaling upon water, cause it to flow backward for several paces; by exhaling upon fire, extinguish it; by exhaling upon tigers and wolves, render them crouched and unable to rise; by exhaling upon serpents and vipers, coil them so they cannot flee. If another is wounded by blade or weapon, exhaling upon the injury will stanch the blood. Should one hear of another bitten by venomous creatures, though unseen, one may exhale from afar while reciting an incantation over one’s own hand—men exhale over the left, women over the right—and even if the afflicted lies a hundred *li* distant, they will be instantly cured. For sudden ailments or acute afflictions, merely swallowing the *qi* of three nines will bring immediate recovery.

Yet human nature is often restless, and few can remain tranquil to cultivate the Way. Moreover, in the practice of *qi*, one must not overeat, nor consume raw vegetables, rich meats, or overly fresh foods, for these strengthen the *qi* and make it difficult to contain. One must also refrain from anger, for excessive wrath disorders the *qi*, preventing its overflow and sometimes causing swelling in the jaw. Thus, few succeed in this art.

The Three Essentials of Nurturing Life state: To cultivate *qi*, one must begin with regulating the breath. The Chan school speaks of four kinds of breath: that which produces sound in the nostrils is *wind*—to focus on wind is to scatter; though soundless, if the breath is rough and obstructed, it is *panting*—to focus on panting is to bind; though neither noisy nor obstructed, if its passage is perceptible, it is *breath*—to focus on breath is to labor. The true *breath* is that which neither enters nor exits.

Master Zhu’s *Inscription on Regulating the Breath* says: When stillness reaches its limit, exhale like fish in a spring pond; when movement reaches its limit, inhale like creatures in winter hibernation. Fish in spring stir with the *qi*, their movement exceedingly subtle; insects in winter hibernate with the *qi*, their stillness without trace. In regulating the breath, one must emulate this—subtle, continuous, quiet, and faint. With each exhalation, the *qi* follows out through the hundred bones and ten thousand pores; with each inhalation, the *qi* follows in through the hundred bones and ten thousand pores. If this regulation is unceasing, true *qi* will arise—this is the essential method.

It further states: In nurturing the body, one must not allow the *qi* within to conflict. For instance, when walking for a long time and wishing to sit, this is a transition from movement to stillness. As one prepares to sit, first walk slowly for a few steps, gently extending the *qi*, gradually relaxing the body. The *qi* of stillness will arrive as the *qi* of movement departs. Sitting thus, the coarse will not clash with the fine. Conversely, when sitting for a long time and wishing to walk, this is a transition from stillness to movement. One must first stir the body, stretching the limbs as if massaging them, then begin to walk slowly. Otherwise, the fine *qi* within will conflict with the coarse *qi*—all other transitions follow this principle.

It also says: Practicing breath-holding and swallowing it is called *embryonic breathing*; swirling the spring beneath the tongue and swallowing it is called *embryonic nourishment*. In spring, one consumes the morning glow—the red *qi* at sunrise; in autumn, the sinking Han—the red-yellow *qi* after sunset; in winter, the flowing night mist—the *qi* of the northern midnight; in summer, the three yang—the *qi* of the southern noon. Diligently practicing this can enable grain avoidance, and I have tested it with good results.

It further states: When first learning to regulate the breath, one must imagine the *qi* exiting and entering through the navel. Once the breath is refined to extreme subtlety, one may abandon the use of mouth and nose, breathing solely through the navel, as if within the womb—hence the term *embryonic breathing*. Initially, hold one breath, breathing with the navel, counting to eighty-one or one hundred twenty before exhaling through the mouth. The exhalation should be exceedingly fine, such that a goose feather placed before the nose and mouth remains unmoved. With gradual practice, the count may be increased over time, eventually reaching a thousand. At a thousand, the aged grow younger, regaining a day for each day practiced.

Master Ge the Immortal would, even in the height of summer, descend to the depths of deep abysses, remaining for a day before emerging—this was due to his mastery of breath-holding and *embryonic breathing*. Yet merely knowing breath-holding without *embryonic breathing* is of no benefit.

It further states: The *qi* should be soft, not forceful; compliant, not contrary; gathered, not scattered. Thus, Daoists most abhor wrath, for the moment anger arises, the *qi* becomes forceful rather than soft, contrary rather than compliant, disordered rather than settled, scattered rather than gathered. Forcing its containment may cause coughing. Therefore, the practitioner must be like a clear breeze after rain, a bright moon after clouds, a lucky star or auspicious cloud—without a trace of perverse *qi*—before progress can be made. Consuming raw vegetables, rich meats, or overly fresh foods also strengthens the *qi*, making it difficult to contain. Eating at irregular times or consuming foods that stir the *qi* also causes it to become contrary. Excessive thought disorders the *qi*, and excessive speech scatters it—both must be deeply avoided.

The True Man of Three Peaks’ *Plain Teachings on the Dao* says: Concentrate the spirit in emptiness, as if sitting atop a high mountain gazing upon all other mountains and waters, or lighting a heavenly lamp to illuminate the nine depths and nine obscurities. Regulating the breath is not difficult—once the heart and spirit are still, the breath follows naturally. One need only guard its spontaneity while directing the light of the spirit downward, and the breath will be regulated. To regulate the breath is to harmonize the *qi* of the Yin Heel Vessel with the *qi* in one’s heart, meeting within the *qi* cavity.

It further says: When the heart rests below the navel, it is called *concentrating the spirit*; when the *qi* returns below the navel, it is called *regulating the breath*. When spirit and breath depend on each other, guarding their natural purity is called *non-forgetting*; following their natural purity is called *non-assistance*. Neither forgetting nor assisting, in silence and softness, the breath becomes lively and the heart at ease. Employ the *drilling* method: use emptiness as the dwelling for the heart, and profound stillness as the abode of the spirit and breath. After two or three attempts, refining again and again, suddenly spirit and breath will forget each other, merging and harmonizing. Unaware, one will feel as if yang has arisen, and the person becomes intoxicated.

It further says: In regulating the breath, one must use the postnatal breathing to seek the place of the true person’s breathing. As the ancients said: *"Postnatal breathing stirs a gentle wind, drawing forth the true person’s breathing."* Yet in regulating postnatal breathing, one must allow it to regulate itself, only then can the prenatal breathing be cultivated. I need only attain emptiness and guard stillness—once the true breath stirs, the Mysterious Pass is not far.

Pursuing practice in this manner, the foundation may be established with ease, requiring not even a hundred days.

Furthermore, in refining *qi* through embryonic breathing, one must rely on breath regulation as the method. The techniques of breath regulation were most thoroughly expounded by [Zhang] Sanfeng, and thus this commentary frequently cites him—these are the true oral instructions of the immortals. As for the method of breath retention, many ancient immortals have rejected it, yet it also has its appropriate applications and cannot be entirely dismissed. However, in practice, one should proceed with utmost naturalness, beginning with the harmonious *qi* of gentle, continuous regulation and gradually advancing. I have already discussed this in detail in *Research and Practice of Qigong for Health Preservation*.

In the preface to *Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* by the Perfected Zhang Ziyang, it is said: *"One must know that within the body there is an aperture called the Mysterious Female. This aperture is neither heart nor kidney, neither mouth nor nose, neither spleen nor stomach, neither the anus nor the bladder, neither the Cinnabar Field nor the Mud Pill Palace. To know this aperture is to know where the Winter Solstice resides, where the medicinal substances are found, where the firing times are set, where the bathing occurs, where the Elixir coalesces, and where the body is transcended. This aperture has no left or right, no inside or outside—it is the root of spirit and *qi*, the valley of emptiness. One must seek it within the body and not elsewhere. This aperture cannot be conjectured by private speculation; it must be transmitted heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth. Should one proceed otherwise, all efforts are in vain."*

The Perfected Min Yide annotates: *"Conjecture is merely a thought. The Great Dao teaches one to forget thoughts—how can one speculate with private intent? Yet to forbid conjecture is also to forbid external seeking. The insistence on heart-to-heart and mouth-to-mouth transmission is to show the seeker that realization must come from within. For those of superior wisdom, whose celestial disposition is already settled, reading this may lead to sudden enlightenment. For those of middling capacity, who must progress gradually, there is still the risk of seeking shortcuts without guidance. Now, in reverence for the compassionate intent of Ancestor Zhang, I shall point out the correct path for entering this aperture within the body of all practitioners: it is the method of stopping thoughts. To stop thoughts, one must first curb anger and restrain desires, eliminating all杂念 and retaining only the right thought. Though the right thought is retained, one must not allow it to cling to subsidiary thoughts, which may subtly grow. When this thought suddenly ceases and the next has not yet arisen, all concerns vanish—this is the most wondrous moment. Receiving a single phrase from the teacher at this instant, one may directly grasp it in the heart. Yet if one can, in the gap between the cessation of the prior thought and the arising of the next, suddenly awaken with a single decisive awareness, it is no different from heart-to-heart transmission—what need is there for oral instruction? The key is to awaken in that instant, without startling oneself. Not startling oneself brings stability; stability deepens the medicinal substances within the body, and the so-called method and measure will naturally flow from all sides. The Winter Solstice, medicinal substances, firing times, and all else mentioned above are truly found here. If one speculates with private intent, will this not be like traveling south by driving north? How could it be otherwise?"*

Furthermore, the general transmission of the Daoist lineage often follows the gradual path of refining *qi* to gather the heart-mind, whereas the Perfected One’s teaching—that stopping thoughts reveals the Mysterious Female—is the supreme vehicle of the Daoist lineage, a method of refining the heart-mind to gather *qi* that resolves all at once. This principle aligns with the Chan School of the exoteric Buddhist teachings and the Great Seal and Great Perfection transmitted in the esoteric teachings—this is most worthy of attention.

*Qi* breathes as if within the womb—how does it breathe? It relies entirely on the great stillness of spirit. As the ancient immortals said: *"When spirit departs, draw it back; when spirit returns to the body, *qi* naturally follows."* Master Lü’s *Hundred Verses* states: *"Without thought, stillness arises; in stillness, *qi* naturally levels. When *qi* breathes and rests, it returns to the root. Returning to the root, one sees the original nature; seeing the original nature is true realization."*

When spirit enters the realm of profound indistinctness and the body returns to the state of emptiness and silence, this is what is meant by *"nurturing life through nurturing nature."* The *Master of Broad Accomplishment* said: *"The essence of the supreme Dao is subtle and obscure; its ultimate is dim and silent. Without seeing, without hearing, embrace spirit in stillness—then the body will naturally rectify itself. Be still, be clear; do not labor your form, do not disturb your essence—only then can you attain longevity. With eyes that see nothing, ears that hear nothing, a heart that knows nothing, your spirit will guard your form, and your form will attain longevity. Guard your inner self, close off the outer; excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I guard the One and abide in harmony—thus I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined."*

Peng Zu said: *"The Dao does not lie in compliance. Simply do not think of clothing, do not think of food, do not think of sound, do not think of color, do not think of victory, do not think of defeat, do not think of loss, do not think of gain, do not think of honor, do not think of disgrace. Let the heart-mind not labor, the body not exhaust itself; constantly guide and lead the inner *qi* to rest—thus may one attain a thousand years."* (Some versions include the lines: *"Do not think of crookedness, do not think of straightness."*)

The *Perfected Bai’s Treatise on Revealing the Secrets of the Mysterious Pass* states: *"The subtlety of refining the form lies in concentrating spirit. When spirit is concentrated, *qi* gathers; when *qi* gathers, the Elixir forms; when the Elixir forms, the form is stabilized; when the form is stabilized, spirit is preserved whole."*

Thus, the Perfected Tan (Tan Zixiao, author of the *Book of Transformations*) said: *"Forget the form to nurture *qi*; forget *qi* to nurture spirit; forget spirit to nurture emptiness; forget emptiness to nurture the Dao. In forgetting all, the work is perfected."*

The Celestial Master Zhang Xuqing’s *Song of the Great Dao* says: *"The Dao is not far—it is within the body. All things are empty, yet nature is not empty. If nature is not empty, harmonious *qi* abides; when *qi* returns to the primordial sea, life is boundless."*

To keep the spirit within the body, let nothing linger in the mind’s chamber. If things remain within, the spirit is not clear—it dissipates vitality and weakens sinew and bone.

Spirit commands *qi*; *qi* sustains form. No need for miscellaneous arts—longevity comes of itself. Arts are easy to know, but the Dao is hard to awaken to. Even if awakened, without single-minded practice, of the thousands who study, barely one or two succeed.

If the spirit strays, draw it back. When spirit returns to the body, *qi* naturally follows. Morning after morning, evening after evening, the true embryo of the Red Child is born.

The Perfected Cao Wenyu said: *"When spirit does not stray outward, *qi* settles of itself."*

From the recorded sayings of the Perfected Dan Yang:
The Master said: *"Qi* is hard to master—swift as a galloping horse. Only stillness makes it easy. One must abandon external attachments. Though splendid sights unfold before the eyes, regard them as if in a deep mountain valley. This is the heart of a Daoist. If one has not reached the state of no-mind, mastery is impossible. Thus, those who know the Dao value no-mind."*

From the *Record of Northern Travels*:
*"Now I speak truthfully to all of you—these are not my private words, but the words of the Perfected Masters. Those who study the Dao and uphold goodness begin with diligence, but before long, they grow lax. They cling to deluded desires, and when no results appear, doubt arises, unshakable. Thus, they abandon the path halfway.*

*The sages established teachings for later generations to dispel delusion and restore nature, preventing emotions and desires from disturbing the heart. When the heart finds its natural equilibrium, this is the foundation of entering the Dao. Were the sages without emotion? They simply did not let their hearts be moved. Like heaven’s four seasons—cold and heat in motion, thunder, wind, and rain transforming all before them—yet the true essence of the Great Void never stirs. When practitioners investigate this to its core, they reach the state of ordinary mind. Hence it is said: ‘The ordinary is the Dao.’*

*First preserve this ordinariness. Accumulated practice and merit depend on oneself—this is what lies within our power. The manifestation of the Dao, grasped by sages and worthies, lies with heaven. One must fulfill what is within one’s power and leave what lies with heaven. When merit and practice are complete, the Dao is naturally attained. To seek it with intention is delusion.*

*It is also said: Purity and stillness have inner and outer aspects, non-action and action. Only non-action leads to true attainment—this is genuine purity and stillness, bestowed by sages and worthies. Today’s practitioners may engage in visualization or breath regulation, which is good, yet they never see success. It is like forcing flowers to bloom in winter under shelter—not without marvel, but they never bear fruit. Only non-action and stillness reach the ultimate, with the sign of no leakage. After three years without leakage, the lesser elixir forms; after six years, the middle elixir forms—matters beyond full expression. After nine years, the upper elixir forms, ascending into the Mud Pill Palace. The Three Palaces rise and descend, transformations endless. Even a thousand or ten thousand emanation bodies emerge from this. How is this achieved? By taking the ordinary mind as the foundation. When the mind is at peace, spirit stabilizes; when spirit stabilizes, essence congeals; when essence congeals, *qi* harmonizes. This manifests in the face and radiates through the four limbs—all naturally. The root lies in taking the ordinary mind as the foundation.*

*What lies within our power must be fully realized; what depends on heaven cannot be forced. Only when merit and practice accumulate sufficiently does attainment come of itself.*

*It is also said: Patriarch Qiu said, ‘Dan Yang and I both studied the Dao under the same master. The master sent me back into worldly labor without rest, while Dan Yang received silent transmission of the mysteries. One day, the master shut his door. I listened through the window and heard him teaching the method of ‘the Valley Spirit never dies’—breath regulation. After a long time, he opened the door and stopped speaking. After that, once my worldly duties were complete, I practiced what I had heard. Though I practiced diligently, Dan Yang attained the Dao in two and a half years, while I endured countless hardships for eighteen or nineteen years without results. The Dao our master transmitted was the same—why such disparity? Only because each person’s accumulated merit and practice differ in depth, so attainment comes sooner or later. Dan Yang’s cultivation spanned lifetimes; by this life, his merit was complete. Applying the Valley Spirit’s method at that time, he quickly saw results. My merit was incomplete, so even with long practice, no results appeared—this was only natural.’*

*Practitioners must first cast aside worldly affairs, cultivate all virtues, free themselves from every encumbrance, and focus the mind on emptiness until reaching the state of stillness beyond stillness. When merit and practice are complete, fortune arrives; when fortune arrives, the heart opens. A single point of light enters—this is the root of heaven and earth. The two substances naturally merge into one. Then, apply the unbroken thread of the Dao to nurture it, filling it to fullness, and one becomes deathless for eternal kalpas.*

*The *Three Essentials of Nurturing Life* states: ‘Gathering essence depends on nurturing *qi*; nurturing *qi* depends on preserving spirit. Spirit’s relation to *qi* is like a mother’s to her child.’ (It records the method of refining essence: at midnight, rise and sit up, rub both hands until extremely hot, use one hand to support the external kidneys, and the other to cover the navel, concentrating spirit on the internal kidneys. With long practice, essence flourishes.) Thus, when spirit congeals, *qi* gathers; when spirit scatters, *qi* dissipates. If one treasures essence and *qi* but neglects spirit, it is like enjoying the flower while forgetting the root.*

*It also says: The Chan school’s *cessation and insight* is the essential method of preserving spirit. One day’s ‘binding to a single object’ is the same as fixing the mind on one point."*

"Second is *restraining the mind to cessation*: no longer binding the mind to one place, but whenever a thought arises, immediately halting it. This is what is meant by ‘not fearing thoughts arising, only fearing delayed awareness.’

Third is *embodying the true cessation*: amidst the myriad worldly conditions, the true mind remains unmoved. In all circumstances of fortune or adversity, the mind does not recklessly follow external objects—this is abiding by embodying the true.

*The Nourishing Life Skin and Tongue* says: When a person first dies, their ears, eyes, mouth, nose, hands, and feet—all their physical form—remain intact, yet their parents, siblings, spouse, and children no longer love them. Why? Because their spirit has departed. Thus, what people love is the spirit, not the form. Yet today, what people cultivate is the form, not the spirit—why is this?

Today, when people compose literature, their spirit departs; when they handle affairs, their spirit departs; when they delight in sounds, their spirit departs; when they indulge in sensual pleasures, their spirit departs. In all their movements and activities, their spirit scatters without cease, yet they do not regret it. Only when the spirit is utterly exhausted do they grieve deeply—how belated is their insight!

When a person engages in thought and contemplation, each thought emits a spirit, each focused intention emits a spirit, like dividing a flame: the more it is divided, the more the oil is depleted, and the smaller the flame grows. The more the spirit is divided, the more essence is exhausted, and the less spirit remains. Only when it is cut off do they grieve deeply—how belated is their insight!

An ancient immortal said: ‘The moment the spirit departs, draw it back. When the spirit returns to the body, *qi* naturally returns. If you do this morning and night, naturally the old man and woman will revert to childhood.’ Alas! This truly communicates the life-force of heaven and earth.

It also says: Lu Yuanhe, discussing the essence of nourishing life, stated: ‘It is nothing more than concealing the spirit in the abyss, preventing it from wandering outward. Over time, the spirit will naturally transform—no need for excessive talk.’

Master Sanfeng’s *Daoist Words in Plain Speech* says: The great Dao enters through the character *zhong* (center). This *zhong* has two meanings: one within the body, and one beyond the body. The practice must be done in two layers.

First, seek the *zhong* within the body. As Zhu Xi said: ‘Guard the center to control the external.’ To guard the center, one must turn the light inward and reflect, focusing attention on the *guiding* (one *cun* and three *fen* below the navel), neither clinging nor departing—this is seeking the *zhong* within the body.

Second, seek the *zhong* beyond the body. The *Doctrine of the Mean* speaks of ‘before joy, anger, sorrow, and delight arise.’ At this time of non-arising, one neither hears nor sees, maintaining reverence in solitude. Naturally, the nature settles and the spirit becomes clear; when the spirit is clear, *qi* becomes refined. Only then can one see the original face—this is seeking the *zhong* beyond the body.

By using the *zhong* within the body to seek the *zhong* beyond the body, human desires are easily purified, and heavenly principle is restored to clarity. The sages, immortals, and buddhas of all ages have taken this as the first step in practice.

It also says: *Congealing the spirit and regulating the breath, regulating the breath and congealing the spirit*—these eight characters are the initial practice. They must be pursued as a single endeavor, progressing through stages without interruption.

*Congealing the spirit* means gathering the already-cleared mind and entering within. When the mind is not yet clear, do not rashly close the eyes. First, one must self-exhort and self-encourage. Only when the mind is coaxed back, cool and tranquil, should it be gathered into the *qi*-cavity—this is called *congealing the spirit*. Once the spirit is congealed, one sits like atop a high mountain, gazing upon all mountains and waters, or like lighting a heavenly lamp to illuminate the nine depths and nine mysteries—this is what is meant by *congealing the spirit in emptiness*.

It also says: Conceal the mind in the abyss, and the spirit will not wander outward. When the mind is dragged by affairs, fire stirs within. When fire stirs within, it inevitably agitates essence. When the mind is still, the breath naturally regulates; with prolonged stillness, the mind naturally settles. Kill the mind to nourish *qi*; refine the breath to purify the mind.

Essence, *qi*, and spirit are the three inner treasures; the ears, eyes, and mouth are the three outer treasures. Always ensure the inner three treasures do not chase after external objects, and the outer three treasures do not penetrate within to disturb. Let the breath be continuous and deep, entering the *dantian*. Make breath the husband and wife, spirit and *qi* the mother and child. When mother, child, husband, and wife gather without separation, the mind does not stray outward, intention does not wander, the spirit does not roam, and essence does not recklessly move. Constantly steaming the four limbs—this is the orthodox lineage of the golden elixir’s great Dao.

It also says: *Congealing the spirit and regulating the breath* requires only a peaceful mind and harmonious *qi*. When the mind is peaceful, the spirit roams; when *qi* is harmonious, the breath regulates. The character *ping* (peace) is most wondrous: a mind without waves is *ping*; a mind that holds to the center is *ping*. *Ping* is precisely this center. When the mind is in this center, it does not stir waves—this is the *mysterious pass* of the alchemical classics.

It also says: Without knowing the *mysterious pass* in cultivation, regardless of other matters, this alone is like entering a dark room—where to begin? The *mysterious pass* is the *qi*-cavity. When the spirit enters the *qi*, it is as if dwelling in a deep cavern. When spirit and *qi* long for each other, the substance of the *mysterious pass* is established.

Master Wu Chongxu said: The ancient *Embryonic Breathing Classic* states: ‘The embryo forms from *qi* lying hidden; breath ceases within the formed embryo.’ These words are the essential method for all past and future divine immortals and heavenly immortals. I wish to further elucidate and directly discuss this.

When a person first loses their body, only the union of two *qi* as empty space remains—there is no embryo, nor breath. Due to the mother’s breathing, the embryo grows; due to the embryo, breath grows. When the embryo is complete, the wonder lies in following the mother’s breath to become breath. Thus, one breathes all day without feeling stifled. This is because the breath does not pass through the mouth and nose but only communicates through the navel, appearing as if without breath—this is the true scene of embryonic breathing.

Once separated from the embryo, breath is cut off. Without the mother’s navel connected to the child’s navel, one cannot but begin breathing through one’s own mouth and nose, which is the same as embryonic breathing but temporarily differs in the aperture."

The principle of reverse cultivation and return—how could it not involve taking one’s present breathing and reverting it to the breath within the womb? Whenever one returns the breath, the *qi* drawn through mouth and nose is restored to the locus of embryonic breathing, as if the breath were once again in the womb. Gradually refining it, even the true embryonic breath vanishes. This "true void" signifies the extinction of breath. Only then does one revert to the state before birth, returning to the realm prior to breath and prior to the embryo, no longer subject to the path of birth and death.

Yet the breath is most difficult to subdue. Only with the support of primordial *qi* can it stabilize and form embryonic breathing. This is another instance of what is meant by "solitary yin cannot complete." It requires the moment when the mechanism of precelestial *qi* stirs, when the primordial spirit awakens alone, and when breath and *qi* interdepend—only when the Three Treasures converge and the Great Medicine is first refined can one return to the Yellow Court, the locus of embryo formation. At this time, one nourishes the fetal spirit with embryonic breathing, allowing spirit and *qi* to ride the breath of embryonic breathing and stabilize within. This is the beginning of embryo formation. Though there may seem to be a faint breath at the navel wheel, it is as if it is not at the navel wheel but in empty space. Gradually, breath ceases, and the embryo forms, seamless and unbroken, directly attaining the great samādhi of the yang spirit. Without movement or stillness, arising or ceasing, the embryo is perfected, and the samādhi of extinction is achieved, giving rise to the yang spirit.

Master Wuyuan said: "When the four great elements are unattached, the body is purified; when all thoughts cease, the mind is purified; when the light is turned inward in reflection, the eyes are purified; when sounds do not enter, the ears are purified; when fragrance and stench do not reach, the nose is purified; when right and wrong do not move, the tongue is purified. Sweeping clean all conditions, departing from all extremes, responding without attachment—this is the purification of the heart."

Master Min said: "At this stage, the Dao-body is fully manifest. If one recognizes this and continues to the point where nothing is established and both self and dharmas are forgotten, advancing to the boundless, one naturally enters the infinite realm of transformation. Body and mind merge with the workings of creation. Further, one maintains the scattered purification for forty-nine days without losing this state. When the time arrives, one responds to the moment with spontaneity, naturally attaining realization in one’s own body. The six supernormal powers are complete—how could the precelestial be obscured, or the embryo fail to form and perfect? Thus, one may suddenly transcend to the supreme knowledge and virtue, resolving all at once. Even if obstacles arise, the Mysterious Pass will surely open widely and remain open. The processes of gathering, forming, nourishing, and liberation—all operate through non-abiding, awareness without attachment."

*The Guide to the Center* says of the medicine: "Generally, the Mysterious Female is the origin of yin and yang, the dwelling of spirit and *qi*. Spirit and *qi* are the medicine of nature and life, the root of embryonic breathing, the ancestor of respiration. The Dao of deep roots and firm stems— the embryo is the palace that houses the spirit, and breath is the source that transforms the embryo. The embryo arises from breath, and breath abides through the embryo. Without breath, the embryo cannot form; without spirit, breath has no master."

It further states: "The immortals teach that in refining essence, one must return to its origin, restore its beginning, regenerate the five viscera, reestablish the bodily form, and from formlessness give rise to form, structuring the sacred embryo. The secret says: 'Concentrate *qi* to achieve softness—can you be like an infant? Eliminate defilement, cease thoughts, still the heart, and guard the One. External perceptions do not enter; internal perceptions do not exit. All day, remain in primordial chaos, as if in the mother’s womb. Spirit stabilizes to meet *qi*; *qi* harmonizes (or abides) to unite with spirit. Spirit congeals as *qi*; *qi* abides as spirit. Serene in the realm of rest, dimly present in the land of nothingness, the heart of heaven is obscure, attention fixed on the One aperture. Like a hen brooding an egg, like a fish in water—exhaling to the root, inhaling to the stem, continuous yet subtle, guarding the single breath within the embryo. Guarding without fixation, the true breath naturally abides. Vanishing as if nothing, though the heart is in the heart, nothing is retained. Within the profound darkness, one only perceives the vast emptiness, where a single spirit governs creation. When the time is ripe, the wondrous principle manifests of itself. Gently it moves, silently it rises. With subtle intention, *qi* is stabilized, responding to the pivot of creation. Then metal and wood naturally merge; water and fire naturally ascend and descend. Suddenly, a single point, as large as a millet grain, falls into the Yellow Court—this is the mechanism of gathering lead and merging mercury, forming the elixir of a single day within that day."

*The Return of Life* says: "At night, primordial chaos crashes to the ground—all the myriad forms are utterly unknown. At this time, the body merges with emptiness, equal to the void. One does not know spirit as *qi*, nor *qi* as spirit. Such transformation is not through visualization—it is the natural Dao. I do not know why it is so, yet it is so."

Once the medicine is born, the fire emerges. Generally, when the medicine arises, in its small form it can align with the workings of Kan and Li; in its great form, it can synchronize with the movements of Qian and Kun. The essence of the golden elixir is fully revealed here, leaving no residue. How could it be spoken of in the same breath as lesser methods? If you do not believe me, abandon the Mysterious Female to establish a foundation, seek medicine outside spirit and *qi*, practice fire times without knowing the natural embryonic breathing—forsaking the root for the branches, chasing delusion and losing the real—heaven will shorten your allotted time. What more can I say?

Now, regarding Master Chen’s passage: though it primarily discusses the Jade Fluid, it also briefly touches on the Golden Fluid. Though the small and great differ, their principle is one. This "one" refers to the union of yin and yang to give birth. Whether in the lesser elixir, the greater elixir, or the Mysterious Pearl—without union, there is no birth. Master Yin said, "There has never been creation without union"—this is precisely what he meant.

Qi enters the body to give life; spirit departs from form to bring death. All living things possess qi, and life dwells within qi. The awareness and movement of all living things arise from the functioning of qi. Without qi, there can be no movement—it becomes a dead thing. All creatures, however humble, contain spirit; spirit is the numinous, and nature resides within it. Without spirit to govern, it is like wood or stone—what else but death?

Thus, we know that what gives life to the human body is qi and spirit. Yet this qi and spirit are endowed by Heaven and further shaped by its molding. As the *Yin Fu Jing* says, "Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things are thieves of one another," and the ancient sages declared, "Heaven gives it, Heaven takes it back." When qi is lost, qi is exhausted, and death follows—all referring to this.

Knowing that spirit and qi can prolong life, one firmly abides in emptiness to nurture them. This is the most essential secret of this classic. Emptiness here means attaining emptiness and guarding stillness, the method of establishing the Mysterious Female. To be empty is to empty the heart; to be without is to forget the body. Emptying the heart, spirit becomes clear; forgetting the body, qi becomes still. When clarity and stillness are achieved, spirit and qi nurture themselves.

Yet this is not something attainable in a single leap. From morning to night, in movement and stillness, one must remain unwavering—only then can success be achieved. Hence, it is called "firmly guarding," meaning not a moment’s separation, not a single instant of slackness. Moreover, this practice of firmly guarding emptiness is the very method by which immortals unite yin and yang, stealing the creative power of Heaven and Earth. Without knowing this secret, there can be no return; without attaining this state, there is no path to return. Thus, it will be expounded further below.

Laozi said: "Attain utmost emptiness, guard profound stillness." The *Huangdi Neijing*’s "Discourse on the Heavenly Truth of High Antiquity" states: "Serene and empty, true qi follows; spirit guarded within—how could illness arise?" Master Danyang’s recorded sayings say: "The Dao takes non-mind as its essence, forgetting words as its function, softness and weakness as its root, and purity and stillness as its foundation. If applied to cultivation, one must moderate diet, sever thoughts, sit in stillness to regulate breath, and rest peacefully to nurture qi. When the heart does not wander, nature stabilizes; when the body is not wearied, essence is born; when spirit is not disturbed, the elixir coalesces. Then, extinguishing emotions in emptiness and calming spirit to the utmost, one may be said to attain the wondrous Dao without stepping beyond the threshold."

He also said: "Purity and stillness—purity is to clarify the source of the heart, stillness is to purify the sea of qi. When the heart’s source is clear, external things cannot disturb it, so emotions settle and spirit’s clarity arises. When the sea of qi is pure, base desires cannot intrude, so essence is preserved and the abdomen is full. Thus, settling the heart is like clarifying water; nurturing qi is like raising a child. When qi flourishes, spirit becomes numinous; when spirit is numinous, qi transforms—this is the result of purity and stillness. If one practices with intention and effort, it is a method with limits; if one practices the principle of non-mind and non-action, it is the boundless emptiness of purity."

He further said: "Non-action means no thought, no worry—concentrating on a pure heart and tranquil mind, nurturing qi and preserving spirit, wandering in the realm of carefree ease, entering the land of nothingness." He also said: "Liu Gaoshang lived in a humble abode for forty years, doing nothing else but emptying his heart, filling his abdomen, shedding vanity, forgetting fame, abandoning profit, purifying his spirit, and preserving his qi. The elixir formed of itself, and immortality was achieved." There is a eulogy for him that says: "Block the openings, close the gates." I once recited these words, but now I see such a person—truly simple and fitting.

He also said: "The cultivator, in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, must not for a moment let the heart stray from the Dao. In walking, place the feet on level ground; in standing, concentrate the mind on the great void; in sitting, regulate the breath at the tip of the nose; in sleeping, embrace the pearl below the navel. Over time, breath is harmonized without interruption, and though one appears foolish all day, this is the true work—no artificial effort or forced practice."

He addressed the assembly, saying: "The Dao has no form or name; it is the ancestor of spirit and qi. When primordial qi descends and transforms, numinous awareness arises of itself. Refining spirit to merge with the Dao—this is true cultivation. All other names and forms are mere distractions, unreliable as standards. I will now present its great outline for you: the essentials of this practice do not depart from spirit and qi. Spirit and qi are life and nature; life and nature are dragon and tiger; dragon and tiger are lead and mercury; lead and mercury are water and fire; water and fire are the infant and maiden; the infant and maiden are true yin and true yang; true yin and true yang are none other than spirit and qi. All these names and forms must not be clung to—they are merely the two words: spirit and qi.

To nurture qi and preserve spirit, one must cast aside all worldly ties, purify both inside and out. Over time, with unbroken focus, spirit congeals and qi surges. After three years without leakage, the lower elixir forms; after six years without leakage, the middle elixir is achieved; after nine years without leakage, the upper elixir is perfected—this is called the fulfillment of the three elixirs, the completion of the nine transformations. Marrow solidifies, blood and vessels become true, inner perfection overflows externally, radiance and clarity shine through. In stillness, there is no movement; in response, there is no limit. A thousand changes, ten thousand transformations—sitting in death, standing in life. The thirty-six thousand spirits leap forth, roaming the world. The three realms welcome you together; within the eight difficulties, a thousand perils and ten thousand poisons cannot harm you. Even in the great kalpa’s transformations, when flames rage on all sides, spirit fills the great void without obstruction. Thus, heaven may at times collapse, earth may at times sink, mountains may at times crumble, seas may at times dry up—all things with form will ultimately perish. Only the cultivator, when spirit merges with the Dao, remains eternally unbroken, and the merit extends to nine generations of ancestors, ascending to the Upper Clarity."

The Master then addressed his disciples, saying, "How many hours are there in a day?"
The disciples replied, "Six hours in a day."
The Master asked, "How many hours are there in a day and night together?"
The disciples answered, "Twelve hours in a day and night."
The Master said, "Within these twelve hours of day and night, the Dao of Heaven moves, revolving and creating transformations—does it ever pause even for an instant?"
The disciples replied, "It never pauses."
The Master said, "Those who cultivate the Dao must emulate the Dao of Heaven, revolving and transforming within their own bodies. In all twelve hours, maintain constant purity and clarity, without the slightest dust-like thought arising. Only then is this true cultivation. Progressing day by day, month by month, without interruption, you will assuredly become an immortal. If you falter in effort or lose conduct, how can you attain realization? I observe that among you, in these twelve hours, there is not a single hour devoted wholeheartedly to the Dao. Having received offerings from patrons in the ten directions, how can you repay them? Once your eyes close in death, you will reenter the wheel of rebirth—when will you ever escape? I now earnestly remind you: simply settle the mind and dispel desires, unstained by the myriad entanglements. When spirit and qi harmonize and ascend, this is the Dao. Cultivate accordingly, and you will not err. If you procrastinate and grow indolent, failing to uphold the practice, the fault is not mine. Do you not consider your seven generations of ancestors, who in life committed manifold evil deeds and now suffer torments in the netherworld, hoping their descendants will attain the Dao and deliver them to rebirth in heaven? Let this be your resolve. Hold fast to the Dao even unto death—this is my wish for you. Take heed.

The *Regulations Within the Rules* on the firing process states: The Jade Toad says, 'Fire originally belongs to the southern *Li* trigram, corresponding to the heart. The heart is spirit; spirit is fire. Qi is the medicine.' To refine the medicine into the elixir with fire is to guide qi with spirit and thereby accomplish the Dao. This explanation is so clear, so direct—yet those without the bone of immortality dismiss it as empty words, missing it even as it stands before them. How lamentable!

The essential oral instructions on the firing process must be sought within true breathing. For breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, breath is regulated. When breath and heart return to the root, this is the mother of the golden elixir. The *Heart Seal Sutra* says, 'Returning the wind to merge as one—after a hundred days, the work becomes efficacious.' This is it. One must guide qi with spirit, stabilize breath with qi, and regulate the bellows’ opening and closing, the ascent and descent of yin and yang. Let inhalation and exhalation proceed naturally. Focus the qi to attain suppleness, contain the light, and remain silent. Whether moving or still, sitting or lying down, maintain continuity as if something were present—like a woman nurturing a pregnancy, like a young dragon tending its pearl. Gradually gather, gradually refine, gradually condense, gradually solidify. When the work becomes pure, it coalesces into one. In movement and stillness, be ever mindful. Do not let thoughts arise—for when they do, fire flares. Do not let intention scatter—for when it does, fire cools. Simply ensure no excess or deficiency, maintaining balance in action and rest. Let spirit embrace qi, and qi embrace spirit. With singular intention, harmonize and envelop the primordial chaos. This is called the continuous transmission of the fire-seed, keeping the elixir crucible perpetually warm, without a single breath’s interruption or the slightest deviation. Refining thus for a moment is a moment’s celestial revolution. Refining thus for an hour is an hour’s celestial revolution. Refining thus for a day is a day’s celestial revolution. Refining for a hundred days is called establishing the foundation. Refining for ten months is called the fetal immortal. Even when yang arises from the primordial sea and fire emerges within water, when heaven and earth cycle and qian and kun reverse—all remains inseparable from a single breath. Moreover, in bathing, nurturing, advancing, retreating, withdrawing, and adding, the subtle alignment with the celestial mechanism and the hidden accord with creation brook no forced effort. Thus it is said: 'Though fire has its timing, it need not be held; the subtle mechanism I know myself. Simply rest the spirit and breath, letting nature take its course—this is the definitive teaching of the former masters.' 'Day and night, the cyclical methods proceed naturally—what need is there to diligently watch the firing process?' This is the unerring judgment of the ancient teachers. The intent of the sages—to transmit the medicine but not the fire—is fully realized herein.

The *Secret Essentials of Cultivating the Real* states: When a cultivator begins to establish the foundation, one must first make the heart like still water without ripples, like the great void without clouds—a state of absolute quiescence. Then, within the mysterious pass of the single aperture, emulate the work prior to the time of one’s parents’ birth. Stabilize the true breath and true qi, ensuring qi does not leave breath and breath does not leave qi, merging them into one. Let the inner not exit, the outer not enter. Up and down they circulate within the single aperture, continuously present as if in the womb before birth—a speck of precelestial ancestral qi, vast and harmonious, warm as spring, blissful as intoxication. Beauty resides within, manifesting on the face, flourishing on the back, extending to the four limbs. The four limbs, though silent, are eloquent. Gazing, one sees no form; seeking, one finds no shape. Not for a moment does it depart from the mysterious pass. At this point, the sprout returns to the crucible, and the firing process may commence.

Thus, the wondrous function of the primordial spirit naturally operates with the true heart, circulating and revolving within the primordial pass. Gradually tempered, gradually condensed, true essence increases daily. When effort reaches depth, it grows from small to great, from subtle to manifest. The primordial pearl takes form, coalescing into the sacred embryo—all proceeding naturally, without knowing how. From spirit to spirit, without knowing how it is so. Like a child nestled in the mother’s womb, following each breath, gathering the qi of profound harmony and emptiness, forming a body imperishable through the ages. When the embryo matures after ten months, it transforms into an infant, identical in appearance to when one was in the mother’s womb before birth. Then, diligently apply the work of nurturing: focus the qi to attain suppleness, concentrate the mind unwaveringly. In movement and stillness, speech and silence, in haste and separation, nurture it fully. When nurturing is complete, the body becomes empty as space. Then, split open the primordial chaos, cleave the undifferentiated, and reveal the original face. A body exists beyond the body, freely transcending dimensions, transforming without limit."

The Oral Secrets of the Mysterious Mechanism state: Assume the full lotus posture, withdraw the gaze and restrain the hearing. Align the mind with the rising and falling of the breath, neither constraining nor indulging it. In continuous, unbroken flow, one merges with the natural Dao. The method of the Golden Elixir is thus from beginning to end—if one applies effort with excessive intent, it is already mistaken.

Laozi said: "Subtle and continuous, as if existing yet not exerting force." Thus, in beginning the practice, one is not bound by time or moment. In stillness and concentration, dispersion belongs to yin; in concentration and emptiness, forgetfulness within dispersion gives rise to the yin spirit, while forgetfulness within concentration gives rise to the yang spirit. When both internal and external mechanisms are forgotten, the mind of nurturing remains ever-present. In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, one constantly abides in suppleness. Dispersion leads to inert emptiness, while stillness leads to true emptiness. In quiescent concentration, essence, qi, and spirit all coalesce. Forget the form but not the mind; forget the mechanism but not the guard. Focus solely on emptiness and non-being, wherein being arises. Constant vigilance ensures presence—only the unmoving mind remains. In purity and non-action, one must ever attend closely, lest thoughts arise. The moment a thought emerges, counter it with a civil and martial response. One must firmly guard without interruption.

Zhang Sanfeng’s discourse on the firing times of elixir refinement states: The initial work lies in extinguishing emotional attachments and sweeping away stray thoughts—removing stray thoughts is the first step, the work of laying the foundation and refining the self. Once the human mind is eliminated, the celestial mind returns; once human desires are purified, celestial principle abides. Each day, first enter stillness for a time until body and mind are fully settled and the breath is harmonized. Then, gently close the eyes, lower the eyelids, and inwardly observe the space one *cun* and three *fen* between the heart below and the kidneys above—neither clinging nor departing, neither forgetting nor forcing. All thoughts vanish, and the solitary spirit remains—this is called the right thought. At this moment, within this thought, one is lively and free; within that qi, one is leisurely and unhurried. The exhalation rises upward without rushing the heart; the inhalation descends downward without disturbing the kidneys. With each opening and closing, each coming and going, after one or two weeks of practice, the fire of the two kidneys naturally begins to steam, and the qi of the cinnabar field warms. The breath regulates itself without effort; the qi refines itself without cultivation. Once the qi and breath harmonize, they naturally ascend, descend, and abide in the upper, middle, and lower without exiting or entering, coming or going—this is called fetal breathing, spirit breathing, the true bellows and furnace, the true cauldron. This is returning to the root and restoring life, the Mysterious Female’s gate, the root of heaven and earth. At this stage, the qi is like a budding flower or an early-stage embryo, naturally steaming and nourishing the constructive and protective qi. It passes from the coccyx through the spine, ascends to the mud-pill palace, descends the magpie bridge, traverses the multi-storied tower, and settles in the Crimson Palace before returning to the middle cinnabar field—this is the initial movement of the river chariot. However, though the qi arrives, the spirit is not yet complete; this is not the true movement. One must not interfere but merely subtly concentrate and guard the central palace. Naturally, boundless vitality arises—this is what is meant by "nurturing the tender shoot."

After one or two months of practice, the spirit becomes increasingly still, and prolonged stillness generates more qi—this is the work of spirit generating qi and qi generating spirit. After a hundred days or slightly more, the spirit flourishes, and true qi gradually fills. With a gentle firing time, the blood and water become abundant. Naturally, kan and li unite, qian and kun converge. Spirit and qi harmonize, and in an instant, true qi blends. A gust of returning wind surges upward through the hundred meridians—this is the true movement of the river chariot. Within it, a single point of numinous light is felt in the cinnabar field—this is the Mysterious Pearl at the water’s bottom, the Yellow Sprout within the earth. At this time, the first yang revives, as if the red sun rising over the vast sea, misty and hazy, now hidden, now visible—thus the lead fire is born.

Before qian and kun, kan and li unite, in the emptiness and extinction of non-being, the spirit congeals at the center. The work continues without interruption, forging into a single mass—this is the union of the Five Agents. When water and fire interact, the second phase of gathering begins. The river chariot reverses its course, and in the fourth phase, the medicine is obtained. The spirit resides within, and the elixir’s light never departs—this is called the Great Celestial Cycle, the practice of the Ninefold Great Return. At this stage, a single point of utmost yang essence congeals within, concealed in the time of purified desire and stilled emotion, taking on form and appearance. Here, the breath rests in the embryo, and both internal and external nurturing proceed without the slightest lapse—this is also called the ten-month work.

Though this passage appears in the *Complete Works of Sanfeng*, it is not necessarily by Sanfeng. However, its discussion of entering stillness is logically sound, and thus it is recorded here.

The *Secret Principles of the Three Vehicles* by Master Hanxu states: In beginning the practice, first still the mind, then seal the mouth, and then regulate the breath (a still mind calms the qi; the highest regulation is no regulation). When the nasal breath is harmonized, close the eyes and inwardly observe, directing the spirit below the root of the kidneys to the yin convergence vessel (this vessel lies behind the scrotum, before the anus, and ascends directly to the sea of qi). After a time, lift the mind and breath into the void aperture (the region behind the navel, before the waist, between the heart below and the kidneys above—do not cling rigidly). Rest the spirit and settle the breath, taking naturalness as the principle. If the mind is too strict, it becomes scorching—this is the civil fire. If the mind is too scattered, it becomes cold—this is the martial fire. The civil fire nurtures; the martial fire refines. The wondrous application from beginning to end lies in the evenness of the internal breath—neither assisting nor forgetting. At this time, the mind is like the great void; if the breath accompanies it, it is not void. The mind is like the great emptiness; if the breath follows it, it is not empty. Between non-void and non-empty, stillness deepens into deeper stillness, purity into deeper purity. All is released; the entire body is forgotten. Mind and spirit are silent; the breath is continuous. All enter into profound obscurity—this is called "piercing the profound obscurity." Within this obscurity, there is qi, and the solitary spirit alone awakens—this is the true breath.

When the true qi emerges, it warms the heart with a melting sweetness and opens the apertures—yet one must still settle it into the cavity, within the void aperture, accumulating and layering it. Then the stem of life grows and yang qi flourishes, allowing the opening of the passes and the circulation of qi.

Master Min said: The method of observing return ultimately lies in nothing beyond "attaining utmost emptiness" and "maintaining deep stillness"—these two phrases are the essential techniques. How many truly understand this secret?

The *High-Grade Alchemical Method* states: As the *Dan Jing* says, "Heaven attains the One and becomes clear; Earth attains the One and becomes tranquil; Man attains the One and attains longevity." This primordial One Qi emerges from the midst of emptiness—yet it is not the same as utter void. By maintaining stillness to the extreme of emptiness, the body abides in the midst of the indistinct and obscure, in primordial chaos and great stability. Spirit and clarity arise naturally; the solitary numen remains ever serene—this is the true primordial, emptiness yet not emptiness.

Where spirit moves, qi moves; where spirit abides, qi abides. This means that spirit and qi are one, not two. Without qi, spirit has no support; without spirit, qi has no master. Since spirit is the master, when spirit moves, qi functions; when spirit does not move, qi also does not move—like a shadow following form. As the ancient immortals said, "Breath arises from the heart; when the heart is still, breath is harmonized." This is the meaning.

Further examining this passage: Though the classics speak of spirit and qi in parallel, yin and yang side by side, the work of Dao cultivation lies solely in the union of yin and yang. To firmly guard emptiness is to "attain utmost emptiness" and "maintain deep stillness," which is also the means to achieve union.

Mencius said: "The will is the commander of qi."
The *Baopuzi* said: "The method of refining qi should be practiced before noon. It can move mountains and seas, subdue tigers and leopards, and restrain bandits."
The *Three Essentials of Nurturing Life* said: "A person’s qi, when blown, feels cool; when exhaled, feels warm. Warmth and coolness change between blowing and exhaling—thus in summer one can make things cold, and in winter, hot. Those who practice qi circulation can enter plague-ridden areas, ward off snakes and tigers, dwell underwater, walk upon water, or blow water to make it flow backward for a thousand miles. The transformations of qi are boundless, all depending on nurturing it with the proper method."

Master Shuju said: "Where the heart directs and qi assists, one can summon wind and rain, move mountains. Where the heart halts and qi guards, one can traverse time—past, present, and future. Thus the Buddha could sit through five thousand kalpas in the snap of a finger, and Daoists could master creation in the palm of their hand."

Master Min said: "Innate nature is fundamentally still. After long stillness, it naturally moves. When movement is concentrated, it becomes the great handle. Returning to the root, one reverts to stillness—stillness is called 'returning to life,' which is the esoteric secret. Concentration is reverence inwardly aligned; if movement is not concentrated, it is distraction. Returning from distraction to stillness is confusion. Thus, when the heart moves, it must be concentrated—this is the principle of selecting the good and firmly holding to it. When movement ends, return to stillness; when heart and spirit are calm and clear, this is clarity embodied."

He also said: "The opening and closing of heaven and earth are nothing but movement and stillness. The life and death of the human body are nothing but movement and stillness. Like leaving the battlefield—after battle, one naturally returns to stillness. Like a theater—after the performance, one returns to stillness. Thus, all movement arises from emotion; stillness is one’s true nature."

*Note: Master Min was a direct lineage holder of the Northern School, hence his teachings on stillness practice are especially intimate.*

If one desires longevity, spirit and qi must be mutually infused. When spirit and qi unite and stabilize, this is the essence of this passage. For where spirit moves, qi moves; where qi moves, essence decays, and the body withers. Only when spirit congeals and qi stabilizes does the body follow in peace—naturally attaining longevity. This passage is particularly crucial.

Master Wenyu said: "When merged into one, then forget the one—thus may one emerge and submerge with the primordial transformation." He also said: "When primordial harmony circulates internally, true attainment is achieved; seeking it externally through breath is ultimately futile."

Master Sanfeng’s plainspoken teachings said: "In general, when sitting in meditation, one must embrace qi with spirit and tether breath with intention, within the Cinnabar Field, gently and leisurely, gathering without scattering. Then the internal qi and the externally drawn qi converge in the Cinnabar Field, growing day by day, month by month, reaching the four limbs and flowing through the hundred channels. It strikes open the double passes of the spine and ascends to the Muddy Pellet; then it descends again to the Crimson Palace and returns to the Cinnabar Field. Spirit and qi guard each other, breath follows breath—thus the path of the River Chariot is opened. At this stage, half the effect of laying the foundation is achieved."

The *Oral Secrets of the Immortals’ Mysterious Mechanism* said: "The method of immortal cultivation lies in concentrating spirit into the qi cavity." The qi cavity is the Mysterious Pass. This aperture lies below the heart and above the kidneys, in the central empty space, facing the navel wheel in front and the kidneys behind—it is the root of life and the foundation of the body. The primordial qi congeals to become nature; the postnatal qi coalesces to become life. The source of nature and life, the stem of life and death—human longevity or brevity all depend on this. The seed of immortals and sages is also contained here. Knowing this aperture and gathering the heart to nurture it, life is in one’s own hands; ignoring this aperture and following the heart’s whims, life is left to heaven.

When beginning practice, fix the heart upon the Mysterious Pass, using the method of heart and breath interdependence: inhale qi into it, gently and continuously; exhale softly and subtly. Before the exhale ends, let the inhale follow. If the heart does not guard the aperture, though breath enters, spirit does not infuse it—the pass will not open. Only with unwavering attention can it be achieved. If breath does not enter the aperture, though the heart guards it, qi does not penetrate—the pass will not open. Only when breath constantly returns to the root can it be achieved."

Though both heart and breath reach the aperture yet allow them free ingress and egress, qi will not gather, and the pass will not open—only as Zhongli Quan said, "more in, less out," can it be achieved.

Combining these three principles—neither forcing nor forgetting—maintaining the proper pace, neither too slow nor too swift: "not forgetting" means unceasing practice; "not forcing" means no need for deliberate effort or hastening. When spirit settles and qi fills, brimming in the cinnabar field, the aperture must open, and essence must arrive.

It is like a wisp of incense smoke in a sealed chamber—at first, barely perceptible. If the flame is never extinguished, the smoke gradually fills the room, and every crevice becomes permeated. The true qi of the human body begins in the abdomen, then gradually opens the aperture, and in time, flows through the four limbs and hundred bones—just so. To accumulate qi is to generate essence. In but a moment, true qi circulates, and true essence arises naturally. This is what is meant by "the nine returns forming the great medicine," where in an instant, divine power manifests.

Once this aperture opens, all apertures open. If there is illness, after a slight warmth and pain—lasting three or four days, or seven or eight—the pain ceases, and the illness departs with it. If there is no illness, it serves as supplementation, leading to the union and return of the elixir, conception of the embryo, shedding of the embryo, transcendence, and spiritual transformation—all occurring when the time arrives and the wondrous aperture opens, without reliance on artificial effort.

When true essence arises, as long as qi is sufficient and spirit abundant, it swiftly reaches the four limbs and hundred bones, and the skin feels as though insects crawl upon it. Practicing thus with unwavering diligence, not a moment’s slack, the Ren and Du meridians meet at the lips, Kan and Li, Qian and Kun, the small and great cycles, the three vehicles and three fields, the head and face, the bubbling spring—no place remains untouched. Practicing thus without cease, the effects are boundless, each unique: the embryo forms and is shed, the sun and moon unite, spirit emerges and transforms.

All these wondrous realizations begin and end with this oral instruction, arising naturally, without knowing how or why.

Furthermore, this passage, along with the earlier esoteric oral instructions on "firmly guarding emptiness to nurture spirit and qi," was hand-copied by Master Fu Qingzhu of the Ming loyalists and annotated in red by the Qing scholar Gu Tinglin. As Master Fu often associated with true immortals and extraordinary individuals, his teachings transcend both principle and practice, unlike the superficial, speculative theories of armchair scholars. Those earnest in cultivating life and entering transformation should wholeheartedly practice, for it is no deception.

Wang Dongting said: "To know interdependence is to steal from heaven and earth, to seize the workings of creation." To know the natural interdependence of heart and breath is dual cultivation.

He also said: "The body is true emptiness; spirit is nature. To attain these, one must seek in the Qian heaven of the West. Function is wondrous existence; qi is life. To attain these, one must seek in the Kun earth of the sea’s depths." When spirit and qi unite, nature and life are dually cultivated.

He further said: "Do not seek within the physical body, nor within the mouth and nose." Those who receive the true transmission must know how to borrow the breath of mouth and nose to return to the primordial true unity of qi.

He also said: "When speaking of heart and breath interdependence, the heart is not the fleshly heart but the primordial congealed original essence; the breath is not the breath of mouth and nose but the primordial flowing original qi. The wondrous union of heart and breath is the primordial original spirit."

He also said: "The two characters 'natural' are the fundamental principle of the Dao, heaven, earth, and humanity. One must follow the natural, not merely listen to it."

He also said: "Dual cultivation relies entirely on the firing times; the firing times rely entirely on the natural."

He also said: "The primordial unity of qi comes from the midst of emptiness. To be empty is to empty the heart, and spirit naturally perceives; to be without is to be without the body, and qi naturally stills." There is a distinction between pre-heaven and post-heaven: pre-heaven pertains to the Dharma body, post-heaven to the physical body. Pre-heavenly emptiness and stillness are for refining the self and laying the foundation; post-heavenly emptiness and stillness lead to solitary yin’s extinction. The great path of the golden elixir most values the emptiness beyond the body—cultivating the pre-heavenly Dharma body is also cultivating the post-heavenly physical body.

He also said: "Spoken separately: without descending the dragon, how can one subdue the tiger? Without accumulating mercury, how can one obtain lead? Mercury is the inner medicine; lead is the outer medicine. At the outset, one must first connect the inner medicine, then the outer medicine. Thus it is said: when the inner connects, the outer must also connect."

Spoken together: refining the self is laying the foundation; laying the foundation is refining the self. Refining the self is nurturing spirit; laying the foundation is settling the breath. When the heart does not move with thoughts, there is no coming or going, no exiting or entering—naturally abiding. When the heart does not move with thoughts, there is no coming or going—this is the work of settling the heart and congealing spirit. Not only is there no coming or going, but one must transcend duality, leave the two extremes, empty the three times, and abide thusly, dwelling where there is no dwelling. When the heart does not move, qi does not move. Thus, it is said: "no exiting or entering, naturally abiding." This is qi without exit or entry, breath extinguished in perfect stillness—heart and qi are not two.

Master Min said: "Simply observe movement and stillness; do not cling to the perception of movement. There is no going, nor is there coming—I am thus ever at ease. Movement and stillness are not it; let go and observe from both ends."

He also said: "I am now ever at ease, neither moving nor still. Within □, I am naturally awake—heaven, earth, beings, and I are one." Diligently practicing this is the true principle.

Having obtained such wondrous instructions, one must practice with utmost diligence to surely attain the wondrous fruit. This is the path of the true immortals’ great Dao, incomparable to the lesser methods of side doors.

What is the wondrous fruit? Sima Chengzhen said: "The Dao has supreme power, transforming form and spirit. When form follows the Dao’s flow, it unites with spirit. When form and spirit unite, this is called the spirit person."

The spirit’s nature is emptily fused, its essence without change or extinction. When form aligns with it, there is no birth or death. Concealed, form merges with spirit; revealed, spirit merges with form. Thus one treads water and fire without harm, faces sun and moon without shadow. Existence and cessation lie within oneself; entry and exit are without gap. Though the body is a coarse substance, it attains the utmost emptiness and subtlety—how much deeper and farther, then, does its numinous wisdom extend?

Yet the Dao of emptying the heart has depths and shallows. Deep, it pervades the form; shallow, it reaches only the heart. Those pervaded in form are spirit persons; those who reach only the heart attain but wisdom and awareness, and the body is not spared decay. Why? Wisdom is the function of the heart; excessive use wearies the substance. At first, small wisdom brings joy and much debate, scattering and depleting the spirit and qi, leaving no numinous essence to moisten the body. Life thus ends prematurely, and the Dao remains incomplete. The scriptures call this "corpse liberation."

It is also said: Mountains have three [grades], and by them grasses and trees do not wither. When humans embrace the Dao, their forms endure forever. Nurtured by its influence over time, their substance transforms to match the spirit. Refining the spirit to the subtle, they merge with the Dao in darkness. They disperse one body into the ten thousand dharmas and blend the ten thousand dharmas into one body. Wisdom illumines without bound; form transcends all limits. They unify emptiness and form as their function and harmonize with creation as their achievement.

It is further said: When the body aligns with the Dao, there is no time when it does not exist. When the heart aligns with the Dao, there is no dharma it does not penetrate. The ear becomes the Dao-ear, hearing all sounds without sound. The eye becomes the Dao-eye, seeing all colors without color. The six senses become thoroughly clear—this is the reason.

Still, according to these words, the fruition of practice varies in height. The shallow attain spirit’s subtlety but not the body’s; this is the fruit of corpse liberation. The deep attain subtlety in both form and spirit—this is called attaining sagehood in the body and ascending to heaven in broad daylight. Yet when one examines how this is achieved, it is nothing other than nurturing wisdom without employing it, thereby suffusing the four great elements, accumulating over long duration, transforming the form into an immortal.

To embark on the immortal’s Dao, one begins by verifying the presence of warmth in the abdomen, gradually extending it to fill the entire body with harmony. The mouth can then dry mercury, and the breath can sear flesh—one’s whole body becomes a single mass of pure yang. The substance of the body is inherently yin; when yang flourishes, yin wanes; when yang is firm, yin is soft; when yang is pure, yin is extinguished. With the presence of such yang—drying mercury and searing flesh—how could the yin of blood and flesh not be transformed?

Further, examining the words of the Śākya school: The origin of the human body lies solely in *āyus*, warmth, and consciousness. *Āyus* is endowed by the offering of father and mother; the length of a person’s life varies according to the thickness or thinness of this endowment. Warmth is the life of sentient beings; when warmth flourishes, life thrives; when warmth ceases, life ends. Consciousness is the numinous awareness—the "master who comes last and goes first." Thus the essentials of cultivation lie in nurturing *āyus*, increasing warmth, so that the body is naturally robust and the spirit has a dwelling. With this as foundation, warmth increases without cease, the form gradually becomes subtle, life endures forever, the body transforms into a rainbow, without change or extinction. Consciousness severs defilement and returns to perfect clarity—is this not one with the Dao’s nine returns and seven reversions?

In esoteric methods concerning the Dao of transforming form, cultivating the qi channels and *bindu* is most direct and effective. For those who take *Dzogchen* as their main practice, the preliminary observations and the final entry into *Tögel* are the essential techniques for transforming form through the heart’s absorption of qi.

The *Commentaries on the Scripture of Embryonic Breathing* are here complete.

There is a superfluous remark: Though the above assembles the renowned sayings of ancient sages and arranges them under various sections, one must know that from beginning to end, it all comes down to the two words *spirit* and *qi*—there is no fixed sequence of before and after. Yet in embarking on practice, effort progresses from shallow to deep, and the effects differ step by step. Though the effects differ step by step, the cultivator of truth never departs from the mutual embrace of spirit and qi. With spirit and qi, there is embrace; forgetting spirit and qi, one enters emptiness. Emptiness does not empty itself—the Dao’s essence is perfectly luminous.
