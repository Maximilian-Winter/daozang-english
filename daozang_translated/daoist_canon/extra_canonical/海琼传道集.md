# 海琼传道集

**Preface to *Haiqiong’s Transmission of the Dao***

Master Guan Yin said: "What can be transmitted is called *affairs*, not the Dao." Lord Lao said: "I know not its name; I forcefully name it the Dao." The circulation of this collection stands in profound contrast to the three thousand six hundred methods and the dozens of schools of life-nurturing. May all of like mind delve deeply into it, as one would into the Lu dialect.

Some say that the Master’s words on *nature* and the *Dao of Heaven* cannot be heard. Alas! Later generations, failing to grasp the Master’s intent, take these as matters of lofty difficulty. Yet how could they know that among the Master’s disciples, only Yan Yuan was singled out for praise? Having attained it, Yan Yuan went three months without straying from *ren*, and spent his days in such stillness that he seemed dull-witted. Thus, dwelling in a humble alley, he found joy in a bamboo bowl of rice and a gourd of water—until at thirty-two, he shed his mortal form.

If one awakens to Yan Yuan’s teaching of the *fast of the mind*, one comprehends the discourse on the *chamber of spirit*. Having grasped the *chamber of spirit*, one grasps *spirit-water*. Mencius said: "Nature is like water." Is this not what he meant?

*The Awakening to Reality* states: "The essence of life-cultivation lies in the Golden Elixir; the essence of the Golden Elixir lies in the *spirit-water* of the Flowery Pond." So simple, so effortless—even the dullest and most ignorant, by practicing it, may ascend to sagehood in an instant.

The *Daodejing* says: "My Dao is most easily known, most easily practiced." Long ago, Zhongli Quan transmitted this to Lü Dongbin; Lü to Liu Haichan; Liu to Zhang Boduan; Zhang to Shi Tai; Shi to the Venerable Daoguang; Daoguang to Chen Nianzu; and Chen to Bai Yuchan—who is my teacher.

In the autumn of the *yihai* year, I encountered him at Mount Wuyi. In the spring of the *wuyin* year, we met again on Mount Lu. Passing through the Temple of Supreme Peace and Prosperity, we met the Daoist Hong Zhichang, styled Mingdao, who called himself the Master of Kan and Li. He had long devoted himself to the inner and outer elixirs, exhaustively studying the teachings of a thousand masters and poring over ten thousand scriptures without finding the trace. Yet in an instant of karmic affinity, with but half a phrase, the golden needle scraped away the film from his eyes; in a fleeting moment, the Mystery Pearl took form.

Hong the Venerable resolved to conceal his form and vanish from the world, sealing his gate and severing all ties. Seated in meditation, he refined the fire and timing to nurture the sacred embryo. Fearing this Dao would be lost without transmission, he thus published for the world his master’s *Shortcut to the Golden Elixir*, the *Linked and Locked Cyclical Scripture*, and the *Song of Joy from Mount Lu*—compiling them under the title *Anthology of the Transmitted Dao*, that all under heaven might share in it.

Disciple of the Elixir-Spoon, Chen Shoumo, styled Zizhi, and Zhan Jirui bow in reverence and inscribe this record.

**Illustrated Transformation: On Medicinal Substances**
*(Lord Lao said: "Put the self behind, and the self leads; forget the self, and the self endures.")*

**First Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *First Return*, called the *First Restoration*.
Like the dung-beetle in filth—use lead yet not lead, for within lead the work must be done.

**Second Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Second Return*, called the *Second Restoration*.
As the dung-beetle shapes dung into a pellet, the Mystery Pearl takes form, the Great One returns to truth.

**Third Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Third Return*, called the *Third Restoration*.
Like the dung-beetle with its pair—one male, one female—an aged couple reunited, their affection lingering.

**Fourth Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Fourth Return*, called the *Fourth Restoration*.
As the beetles roll the dung-pellet together, moving across the earth, the fire and timing of the Celestial Cycle flow freely in the River Chariot.

**Fifth Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Fifth Return*, called the *Fifth Restoration*.
Like the two beetles embracing the dung-pellet, guarding it with focused intent, nurturing the upright and holding fullness, embracing the feminine and the One.

**Sixth Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Sixth Return*, called the *Sixth Restoration*.
Within the dung-pellet, wriggling white grubs gather—spirit and essence converge to form the sacred embryo.

**Seventh Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Seventh Return*, called the *Sevenfold Restoration*.
Within the dung-pellet, the white grub transforms into a cicada’s shape.
Within it is essence, dim and obscure;
Within it is substance, faint and indistinct.

**Eighth Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Eighth Restoration*.
Like the cicada shedding the shell of the dung-pellet, the seasonal cycle complete, the embryo emerges through divine transformation.

**Ninth Turn of the Golden Elixir**
Called the *Ninth Restoration*.
As the dung-beetle dies, the dung-pellet splits, and the cicada takes flight—form and spirit both perfected.

**Heavenly Mechanism: On Fire and Timing**
*(Lord Lao said: "Subtle and unceasing, as if present; use it without exhaustion.")*

**First Turn of Fire and Timing (Eleventh Month)**
Like a peach pit planted in soil.
Draw the solid center from the Kan position to pierce the yin within the Li palace.

**Second Turn of Fire and Timing (Twelfth Month)**
Like a peach pit sprouting.
From formlessness, form arises—this is the restored elixir. Who would believe a child is nurtured from nothing?

**Third Turn of Fire and Timing (First Month)**
Like a peach pit sending forth shoots.
White snow and yellow sprouts—once past, a fierce fire forges the red peach.

**Second Month**
This month belongs to *mao* Wood, flourishing in *mao*.
Guard against danger, tend with care—bathe the elixir’s head.

**Fourth Turn of Fire and Timing (Third Month)**
Like peach shoots bursting into bloom.
In a flash, flames soar, and the true person appears.

**Fifth Turn of Fire and Timing (Fourth Month)**
Like peach shoots unfurling leaves.
Draw the White Tiger back to nurture it, and it yields a luminous pearl like the full moon.

**Sixth Turn of Fire and Timing (Fifth Month)**
Like the peach tree blossoming.
At this stage, cinnabar must be bathed, refined, and replenished—apply caution in operation.

**Seventh Turn of Fire and Timing (Sixth Month)**
Like the peach blossoms fallen.
The calyx remains; drink the elixir-spoon, ingest the cinnabar.

**Eighth Turn of Fire and Timing (Seventh Month)**
Like the calyx of the peach blossom.
The seed forms within the egg, the white within the Yellow Dragon’s pearl.

**Eighth Month**
This month belongs to *you* Metal, flourishing in *you*.
Only tend the fire; do not indulge or bathe.

**Ninth Turn of Fire and Timing (Ninth Month)**
Like the peach ripening to crimson.

**Tenth Month**
Frost descends, the elixir matures.
The embryo rounds in the tenth month, transcending the mortal to enter sagehood.
In the tenth month, the embryo sheds its husk, swallowed into the belly—only then does one know: "My fate is not ruled by heaven."

Lord Lao said: "The Dao does not seek emptiness; emptiness naturally returns to it.
If one can empty the heart, the Dao naturally returns."

**Diagram of Heaven and Earth in Union**
**Diagram of Sun and Moon Conjoined**

**Oral Instructions on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir**
The ancients said: "Sages transmit the medicine but not the fire."
This *Shortcut to the Golden Elixir* fully expounds the subtle principles of the elixir method—yet it dare not openly speak of the fire and timing.
For the fire and timing entail seizing the qi of heaven and earth, stealing the essence of sun and moon—one must not treat this lightly.
Only those with innate immortal bones will naturally have a share in it.

**Illustration of Creation**
White Jade Toad said: "Emptiness and spontaneity—from nothing, something arises.
All things are one thing; the one is prized in its constancy.
Whirling wind blends, all day like drunkenness.
Awakening from the great dream, thunder roars and lightning flashes.
Clouds disperse, rain scatters—heaven endures, earth abides."

Fire is mao and you; mao and you are the Hare and the Rooster; the Hare and the Rooster are the Crow and the Rabbit; the Crow and the Rabbit are the Tortoise and the Serpent; the Tortoise and the Serpent are the Horse and the Ox; the Horse and the Ox are Qian and Kun; Qian and Kun are Kan and Li; Kan and Li are the female and the male; the female and the male are husband and wife; husband and wife are children and grandchildren; children and grandchildren are the lunar mansions Fang and Bi; Fang and Bi are the sun and the moon; the sun and the moon are heaven and earth; heaven and earth are humanity; humanity is the Yellow Dame; the Yellow Dame is the Metal Duke; the Metal Duke is the Alchemical Maiden; the Alchemical Maiden is the Infant; the Infant is Ding the Elder; Ding the Elder is the Red Child; the Red Child is the Sacred Embryo; the Sacred Embryo is the Three Passes; the Three Passes are the Golden Liquor; the Golden Liquor is the Jade Liquor; the Jade Liquor is the Knife-Point; the Knife-Point is the Cinnabar Field; the Cinnabar Field is the Crimson Palace; the Crimson Palace is the Muddy Pellet; the Muddy Pellet is the Sea of Qi; the Sea of Qi is the kidneys; the kidneys are the heart; the heart is the Dao; the Dao is the Dharma; the Dharma is the Art; the Art is emptiness; emptiness is spontaneity; spontaneity is application; application is fire; fire is the elixir; the elixir is qi; qi is spirit; spirit is the Elixir Head; the Elixir Head is the Great Return; the Great Return is the Seven Reversions; the Seven Reversions are the Nine Returns; the Nine Returns are Metal and Fire; Metal and Fire are the Purple Mushroom; the Purple Mushroom is the Water Source; the Water Source is the Earthen Cauldron; the Earthen Cauldron is the Metal Tripod; the Metal Tripod is the Jade Furnace; the Jade Furnace is the Spirit Chamber; the Spirit Chamber is the Primordial Altar; the Primordial Altar is the Yellow Court; the Yellow Court is the eyes; the eyes are the nose; the nose are the ears; the ears are the pine; the pine is the dung beetle; the dung beetle is the peach; the peach is the red tangerine; the red tangerine are the Six Thieves; the Six Thieves are the Three Corpses; the Three Corpses are the Three Hun; the Three Hun are the Seven Po; the Seven Po are the Five Spirits; the Five Spirits are the Myriad Spirits; the Myriad Spirits are the One Spirit; the One Spirit are the Myriad Treasures; the Myriad Treasures are bathing; bathing is withdrawal and replenishment; withdrawal and replenishment are advance and retreat; advance and retreat are civil and martial; civil and martial are weight and measure; weight and measure are fortune and misfortune; fortune and misfortune are punishment and virtue; punishment and virtue are existence and extinction; existence and extinction are black and white; black and white are being and non-being; being and non-being are beginning and end; beginning and end are movement and stillness; movement and stillness are cold and heat; cold and heat are yin and yang; yin and yang are the winter solstice; the winter solstice is the summer solstice; the summer solstice is the full moon; the full moon is the new moon; the new moon are the quarters; the quarters is the dark moon; the dark moon are the tidal signs; the tidal signs is the lunar orb; the lunar orb is the solar radiance; the solar radiance is the Great One; the Great One is the Mysterious Pearl; the Mysterious Pearl are the Four Symbols; the Four Symbols are the Five Phases; the Five Phases are the Eight Trigrams; the Eight Trigrams are the Three Powers; the Three Powers are the Three Luminaries; the Three Luminaries are the Two Modes; the Two Modes is the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate is the Supreme; the Supreme is the Primordial Chaos; the Primordial Chaos is the Beginningless; the Beginningless is the Endless; the Endless is the Primordial Beginning; the Primordial Beginning is the One Qi; the One Qi is the Void; the Void is emptiness; emptiness is the Undifferentiated; the Undifferentiated is the Golden Elixir.

The Old Lord said: "Attain the One, and the myriad affairs are complete; complete the myriad, and the One is accomplished."
Zhang Ziyang said: "Hooks and locks link in an unbroken chain—Dao has no end or beginning, flowing ceaselessly. Only humanity is most numinous; with the heart, one joins the Dao. The Dao is in heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know the Dao; it is in the myriad things, yet the myriad things do not know. Thus, those who attain the Dao—body is heaven and earth; heaven is earth; earth is heaven; heaven is the Dao; the Dao is heaven and earth; heaven and earth is the body; body is the heart; heart is spirit."

Chen Niniwan said: "The ancient immortals and sagely worthies transmitted it mouth to mouth, without establishing written words. Now I record it in writing for the world. The superior person attains it, and the heart becomes like the Great Void; the middling person attains it, and the body becomes like withered wood; the inferior person attains it, and body and heart remain restless."

Guan Yinzi said: "The worthy cling to the inner; the multitude cling to the outer; the sage regards both as false."

Bai Yuchan said: "Those who attain awakening may transmit the sagely Dao. Without awakening, there is no attainment; those who awaken attain the sagely Dao. It has no past, no present—its departure is not past, its arrival is not present. What can be transmitted is only called 'affair,' not 'Dao.' The Dao is fundamentally untransmittable; the Dao has no sound or color; the Dao has no form or appearance; the Dao has no past or present; the Dao has no coming or going."

Dao Guang said: "Practice for one year, and the Sacred Embryo forms; practice for two years, and the Infant becomes numinous; practice for three years, and the body outside the body appears; practice for four years, and children beget grandchildren; practice for nine years, and one may ascend in flight. If merit and practice are incomplete, there may be gathering and dispersal—gathered, it forms a body; dispersed, it becomes a wind-child. But for a fleeting moment, behold the Mysterious Pearl! The Mysterious Pearl is the essence of the Primordial Chaos. When refining, simmer the fire gently to preserve your body, aligning with heaven and earth."

Liu Haichan said: "Diligent yet unmet, one may still encounter a sagely teacher; met yet indolent, one ultimately becomes a lesser ghost."

Lü the Realized said: "To lightly divulge or carelessly leak brings calamity upon the nine ancestors; through cultivation and practice, the body ascends to the Great Tenuity."

Zhongli Quan said: "Gently roll up, silently gather; bathe in joyous harmony, ever-flowing." The *Daodejing* says: "Ceaseless as if existing, concentrate qi to attain softness, like a newborn babe. Constant virtue does not depart, returning to the state of the infant."

*Song of Joy* (For the Daoist Chen Zhibai)

Joyful, joyful, truly joyful,
All at once, I cast it all away.
Hands unbound, I sing loudly and return,
Ginger and pepper—ah, how pungent!

Now joyful, greatly joyful,
Sometimes wild, sometimes unruly.
Within this body, husband and wife reside,
Tell this to others, and they’ll surely laugh.

Once joyful, a small joy,
Like a rootless tree, plucked clean.
A man, truly pregnant,
Mother and child, one form, lively and free.

Joyful, joyful, truly joyful,
The void shattered like an autumn hair’s end.
Through countless lives of rebirth,
Only this great death brings true life today.

Old nests and hollows, past livelihoods,
Now all swept clean, cast away.
It turns out father was only father,
Bewildered, entangled in one’s own web.

Lately, vaguely discerning east from west,
Forty-eight, as before, after seven sevens.
Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, heart unwavering,
Like a hen brooding her eggs, breath unbroken.

Like the cold cicada sipping dawn’s breeze,
Like the old oyster holding the autumn moon.
A single idle man between heaven and earth,
A great laugh shakes the vastness of heaven and earth.

Clothing: one robe for all four seasons,
Food: one bowl from a thousand homes.
In a three-house village, I play the madman,
Through ten-house streets, I dash wildly.

One husband, one wife, with six children,
Whether walking or sitting, ever steadfast.
Gather and release, act freely,
This is the Buddha of the ten directions and three times.

One cup of wine, then another,
One song sung, then another.

At midday, clear and bright, three meals taken,
After eating, a snoring nap.
Letting go of ten thousand entanglements, all cast aside,
Only when freed and at ease does true joy arise.

Exhausting all cleverness to learn folly,
At this moment, the scene transforms—dawn’s secret attained.
Ordinary folk fail to turn somersaults,
Like eating salt when hungry, only increasing thirst.

By chance, wandering to Mount Lu,
Amid white duckweed and red smartweed.
Ascending the Pavilion of Heavenly Sounds to gaze,
The yellow crane has not returned—spring rain chills.
How many in this world feel heartache,
Failing to refine the golden elixir of the Great Return.

Forgetting form to nurture qi is the golden liquid,
Facing scenes with no mind is the Great Return.
Forgetting form, transforming qi; qi transforming spirit,
This is the Great Dao penetrating the Three Passes.

The Crimson Palace burns like a crescent moon furnace,
The Spirit Terrace stands silent as the Great Mystic Altar.
Cinnabar is the blood of the red phoenix,
Quicksilver is the liver of the black tortoise.
Golden lead gathered into the earthen crucible,
Wooden mercury flees to dwell in the Mud Pill Palace.

The Flowery Pond lies within the Sea of Qi,
The Spirit Chamber rests between the Yellow Court.
Scattered, eyes and ears, nose and tongue grow busy,
Gathered, meridians and protective qi lie at ease.
The five viscera and six bowels each have their spirits,
Myriad spirits pay homage to the One Spirit.

This One Spirit is called the Primordial Essence,
Preceding and following heaven, the Creative flourishes.
Sages gather this as medicinal material,
Assembled, it exists; scattered, it vanishes.
Day and night, the River Chariot never pauses,
Silently harmonizing with the Great Creation in its course.

Every person originally possesses a drop of gold,
Golden essence and wooden liquid, each half a catty.
The twenty-eight constellations return to one furnace,
One water, one fire—balance must be precise.
One phase firm, one phase yielding,
One line strong, one line gentle.

The heart’s sky marks the seasons of cold and heat,
The nature’s earth divides realms like Chu and Qin.
In a single day, eighty-four thousand miles,
The Dipper’s handle turns the celestial wheel.
When one sheds the shell beyond yin and yang,
One cannot but refine mercury into silver.

Only when the Yellow Dame arrives at the Purple Court,
Do the Golden Elder and the Mysterious Maiden wed.
Green Dragon and White Tiger encircle the golden tripod,
At midnight, a sprig of yellow sprout blooms.
At the bend of the Nine-Curved River, white snow flies,
Atop Kunlun’s peak, purple clouds surge.

Ding Gong silently guards the jade furnace,
In union and gentle nurturing, the fetal immortal forms.
Divine water extinguishes the fire of the Three Corpses,
The sword of wisdom sweeps away the armies of the Six Thieves.
From nothing, something arises—a grain of powder,
Within the dung pellet, the scarab’s form.

Truly, one gain becomes eternal,
In a fleeting moment, it may coalesce.
Suddenly, the four great elements birth empty whiteness,
Unknowing, the One Spirit ascends to the Great Clarity.
Even if skillfully mercury meets lead,
Without knowing the firing times, all is in vain.

In general, one must rely on the celestial fire,
Only after ten months does the sacred embryo begin to round.
Though the elixir’s head may form, it ultimately dissipates,
Only with the firing times does it solidify and endure.
Movement and stillness, life and death—bathe them,
Fortune and misfortune, advance and retreat—value withdrawal and addition.

After nine revolutions of ceaseless fire,
The medicinal substances may become the fetal immortal.
One hour and eight quarters make one celestial cycle,
Twelve double-hours correspond to one year.
From each yang union onward,
Refinement proceeds until the six pure yangs.

Spirit and essence come and go, knowing the tides,
Qi and blood wax and wane like the moon’s soul.
A single hub has always had thirty spokes,
The wonder lies in the waxing and waning arcs.
Concentrating qi to achieve softness is utmost benevolence,
Ritual, righteousness, wisdom, and trust fuse into benevolence.

True earth returning to its place is utmost truth,
Water, fire, metal, and wood all perfectly whole.
Essence-water, spirit-fire, and intent-earth,
Refine them so soul and spirit return to their root.
The primordial qi of former heaven now abides,
Scattered among the ten thousand things and the human body.

Flowers bloom in spring winds, birds sing on their own,
Who knows the Creator’s heaven as spring?
The common folk use it daily yet remain unaware,
Qi enters the four limbs, only to wither and fade.
Pines and bamboo, hollow-hearted, receive qi in full,
Defying frost and snow, they stay verdant through the years.

How much more so the human primordial spirit, which never dies—
This qi is the yellow sprout, the lead.
The old may become young, the sick may grow healthy,
The scattered may gather, the short-lived may extend.
The heart enters emptiness, practicing the firing times,
Inner scenes, inner images—the heaven within the pot.

Know that each speck of dust is Penglai,
And each leaf is a transcendent.
Spirit is fire, qi is medicine,
The heart is the furnace, the body the field.
Cultivate, plant, and refine yourself,
Each day, a grain like millet.

The magic mushroom’s life brings sweet dew to fall,
Tortoise and snake, through the ages, ever entwined.
One morning, thunder and lightning shake mountains and rivers,
One becomes the sun, ten thousand become smoke.
Within the sun, the golden crow flies,
Every night at the third watch, it enters the Broad Cold.

Children and grandchildren, hundreds of millions,
Furnace, tripod, chickens, and dogs all ascend to heaven.
The Great Dao has thirty-two transmissions,
Passed to Zhang Wuzhen of Tiantai.
Four transmissions later, to Bai Yuchan,
Whose eyes spanned the four seas, sighing for lack of people.

By chance, at the Taiping Xingguo Palace,
An old Daoist with white hair, surnamed Chen.
Half a lifetime resolved to study lead and mercury,
Wandering myriad waters and mountains in vain hardship.
One day, by chance at the foot of Mount Lu,
He waved his hand, laughing, and stepped out of the world’s dust.

On a windy, rainy night in a jade pavilion, beds side by side,
The elixir method was taught to restore the origin.
What is a human life like? A cup of wine,
What is a human life like? A lamp’s flame.
Where are Penglai and Fangzhang?
I long to return on blue clouds and white cranes.

Joyful, joyful—truly joyful,
For you, I speak these final words.
The final words, personally imparted,
Universally for all under heaven who study immortality,
Clearly pointing out the path to Penglai.
