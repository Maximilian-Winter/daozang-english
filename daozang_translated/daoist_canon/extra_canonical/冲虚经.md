# 冲虚经

**The *Chongxu Jing* (Scripture of Pervasive Emptiness)**
**Chapter One: Heavenly Portents**

Master Liezi dwelled in the gardens of Zheng for forty years, yet none recognized him. The lord of the state and his ministers regarded him as one of the common folk. When the state’s resources grew insufficient, he prepared to take a wife in Wei. His disciples said: *"Master, once you depart, there will be no set time for your return. We dare to ask: what teachings will you leave us?"*

Master Liezi smiled and said: *"What did Master Huqiu say? Though I have not heard him directly, our teacher once spoke of this to Bohun Maoren, and I overheard it in passing. Let me tell you what I recall. He said: There is that which is born yet does not give birth, and that which transforms yet does not transform. That which does not give birth can give birth to birth, and that which does not transform can transform transformation. What is born cannot but be born, and what transforms cannot but transform—thus there is constant birth and constant transformation. In constant birth and constant transformation, there is no time without birth, no time without transformation. This is merely yin and yang, merely the four seasons. That which does not give birth is solitary and unchanging; that which does not transform moves in cycles. Cyclic movement has no end to its boundaries; solitary constancy has no limit to its Dao. The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: ‘The valley spirit does not die—this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of Heaven and Earth. Subtly enduring as if present, its use is inexhaustible.’ Thus, that which gives life to things does not itself give birth, and that which transforms things does not itself transform. Things are self-born, self-transforming, self-formed, self-colored, self-knowing, self-powered, self-dissolving, self-ceasing. To speak of them as ‘birth and transformation,’ ‘form and color,’ ‘knowledge and power,’ ‘dissolution and cessation’—this is incorrect."*

Master Liezi said: *"In ancient times, the sages followed yin and yang to unify Heaven and Earth. If that which has form is born from that which is formless, then how did Heaven and Earth come to be? Thus it is said: There is the Supreme Simplicity, the Supreme Beginning, the Supreme Inception, and the Supreme Plainness. The Supreme Simplicity is before qi is seen; the Supreme Beginning is the inception of qi; the Supreme Inception is the inception of form; the Supreme Plainness is the inception of substance. When qi, form, and substance are all present yet not yet separated, this is called the Primal Chaos. The Primal Chaos means that the myriad things are intermingled and not yet distinct. It cannot be seen, cannot be heard, cannot be grasped—thus it is called the Simplicity. The Simplicity has no boundaries of form; it transforms into the One, the One transforms into the Seven, the Seven transforms into the Nine. The Nine is the ultimate transformation, which then reverts to the One. The One is the inception of form’s transformation. The clear and light ascends to become Heaven; the turbid and heavy descends to become Earth; the harmonious qi becomes Man. Thus, Heaven and Earth contain essence, and the myriad things are transformed and born."*

Master Liezi said: *"Heaven and Earth have no complete achievements, the sages have no complete abilities, and the myriad things have no complete uses. Thus, Heaven’s duty is to give life and cover, Earth’s duty is to shape and bear, the sage’s duty is to teach and transform, and things fulfill their proper roles. Yet Heaven has its shortcomings, Earth has its strengths, the sage has his limitations, and things have their penetrations. Why? That which gives life and covers cannot shape and bear; that which shapes and bears cannot teach and transform; that which teaches and transforms cannot defy what is proper; and what is proper, once established, does not transgress its position. Thus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is either yin or yang; the teachings of the sages are either benevolence or righteousness; the proper roles of things are either softness or hardness—all follow what is fitting and cannot transgress their positions. Therefore, there are things that are born, and there are things that give birth to birth; there are things that have form, and there are things that give form to form; there are things that have sound, and there are things that give sound to sound; there are things that have color, and there are things that give color to color; there are things that have flavor, and there are things that give flavor to flavor. What is born from birth dies, yet that which gives birth to birth never ends; what is formed from form is solid, yet that which gives form to form has never existed; what is sounded from sound is heard, yet that which gives sound to sound has never been uttered; what is colored from color is manifest, yet that which gives color to color has never been displayed; what is flavored from flavor is tasted, yet that which gives flavor to flavor has never been presented—all are the awareness of non-action. It can be yin or yang, soft or hard, short or long, round or square, alive or dead, hot or cool, floating or sinking, gong or shang, emerging or submerging, dark or yellow, sweet or bitter, rank or fragrant. It has no knowledge, no ability, yet there is nothing it does not know, nothing it cannot do."*

Liezi journeyed to Wei and ate by the roadside. His followers came upon a century-old skull, plucked some mugwort to point at it, and turned to his disciple Baifeng, saying: "Only you and that one know that there has never been birth, never been death. Has this one missed nurture? Has this one missed joy? There are many kinds of seeds: frogs become quails, and when they find water, they become water-plants. At the water’s edge, they become the raiment of frogs and toads. Born among mounds and hillocks, they become plantain. Plantain that finds rich soil becomes crow’s-foot. The root of crow’s-foot becomes a grub, its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies decay and transform into insects, born beneath the stove, their form like a cast-off skin, named *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* transforms into a bird called *ganyugu*. The spittle of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*. *Simi* becomes *shixiyilu*. *Shixiyilu* gives rise to *shixihuanghuang*, *shixihuanghuang* to *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* to *maorui*, and *maorui* to *fuquan*. Sheep’s liver transforms into *digao*, horse’s blood into *zhuanlin*, and human blood into wildfire. Sparrow-hawks become kestrels, kestrels become cuckoos, and cuckoos in time revert to sparrow-hawks. Swallows become clams, field mice become quails, rotten gourds become fish, old leeks become amaranth. Aged rams become apes, and fish roe becomes insects. The beast *danyuan* conceives of itself and is born, called *lei*. The river marsh bird *yi* is born from gazing. The purely female is named *daxxxx*, the purely male *zhifeng*. A longing scholar, though unwed, may be moved to conception; a longing maiden, though husbandless, may conceive. Houji was born from a giant’s footprint, Yi Yin from the hollow mulberry. *Juezhao* was born from dampness, vinegar flies from wine. *Yangxi* paired with *bugou*, and from long bamboo came *qingning*, from *qingning* came *cheng*, from *cheng* came horses, from horses came humans. Humans, in time, enter the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things return to the mechanism."

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: "When form moves, it does not give rise to form but to shadow; when sound moves, it does not give rise to sound but to echo; when nothing moves, it does not give rise to nothing but to something." Form must come to an end—does heaven and earth also end? They end together with me. Do they advance toward an end? I do not know. The Dao ends where there was originally no beginning, advances where there was originally no duration. With birth, there is a return to non-birth; with form, a return to formlessness. That which does not birth is not originally non-birthing; that which is formless is not originally formless. Birth is the principle that must come to an end. What ends cannot but end, just as what is born cannot but be born. To desire the permanence of life and to delineate its end is to be deluded by calculation.

Spirit belongs to heaven’s portion; bones and flesh to earth’s. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its true nature—hence it is called *gui* (ghost). *Gui* means "return," returning to its true dwelling.

The Yellow Emperor said: "When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, do I still remain?"

From birth to death, the great transformations of a person are four: infancy, youth and prime, old age, and death. In infancy, qi is concentrated, the will is unified—harmony reaches its peak. No thing harms it, no virtue surpasses it. In youth and prime, blood and qi surge, desires and thoughts arise in full—things assail it, and virtue thus declines. In old age, desires and thoughts soften; the body prepares to rest, and no thing takes precedence. Though not yet the wholeness of infancy, it is far removed from youth and prime. In death, there is a return to stillness, a reversion to the ultimate.

Confucius was traveling on Mount Tai when he saw Rong Qiqi walking in the wilds of Cheng, clad in a deerskin girdled with rope, plucking his zither and singing. Confucius asked: "Sir, what is the source of your joy?" He replied: "My joys are many. Heaven gives birth to the ten thousand things, and humans are the most noble—this is my first joy. Among humans, there is a distinction between male and female, with men honored and women debased, so to be born a man is my second joy. There are those who never see the sun or moon, who never leave swaddling clothes—I have already lived ninety years, and this is my third joy. Poverty is the constant lot of the scholar, death the end of all people. Abiding in constancy and attaining one’s end—what is there to grieve?" Confucius said: "Excellent! He knows how to console himself."

As Lin Lei approached a hundred years of age, he wandered through late spring clad in furs, gleaning stray grains from abandoned fields while singing as he went. Confucius, passing through Wei, saw him in the wilds and turned to his disciples, saying: "That old man may be one with whom words can be shared—go and inquire of him!" Zigong volunteered to go. He met the elder at the end of a ridge and, facing him, sighed: "Sir, do you have no regrets, singing and gleaning as you do?" Lin Lei walked on without pause, his song unbroken. Zigong persisted in questioning him until at last the old man looked up and replied: "What should I regret?" Zigong said: "In youth, you did not strive; in maturity, you did not vie for success; in old age, you have no wife or child, and death draws near—what joy is there in gleaning and singing?" Lin Lei laughed: "The source of my joy is shared by all, yet they turn it to sorrow. In youth, I did not strive; in maturity, I did not vie for success—thus I have lived to such an age. In old age, I have no wife or child, and death draws near—thus I can be joyful as I am." Zigong asked: "Longevity is what all desire; death is what all abhor. Why do you find joy in death?" Lin Lei replied: "Death and life are but a going and a returning. How do I know that one who dies here does not live again there? Thus I know they are not the same. How do I know that busily seeking life is not delusion? And how do I know that my death now is not better than my life before?" Zigong, unable to grasp his meaning, returned and reported this to the Master. Confucius said: "I knew he was one with whom words could be shared—indeed it is so! Yet what he has attained is not yet complete."

Zigong, weary of study, said to Confucius: "I wish to find rest." Confucius replied: "In life, there is no rest." Zigong asked: "Then where may I, Si, find rest?" Confucius said: "There is a place—look to the grave mounds, towering and vast, solemn and still, like a tripod’s steadfast form. There you will know where rest lies." Zigong exclaimed: "How great is death! The noble man finds rest there; the petty man is laid low."

Confucius said: "Si! You have understood. Men all know the joy of life, yet not its toil; they know the weariness of age, yet not its ease; they know the dread of death, yet not its rest. Yanzi said: ‘How good is the ancient truth of death! The virtuous find rest there; the unvirtuous are laid low.’ Death is the culmination of virtue. The ancients called the dead ‘those who return.’ If the dead are called ‘those who return,’ then the living are ‘those who journey.’ To journey without returning is to lose one’s home. If one man loses his home, the world condemns him; if the whole world loses its home, none know to condemn it.

There are those who leave their native land, abandon their kin, forsake their family’s work, and wander the four directions without returning—what manner of men are they? The world must call them reckless wanderers. And there are those who prize worldly worth, boast of their skills, cultivate fame, and vaunt themselves before the age, yet do not know themselves—what manner of men are they? The world must call them cunning strategists. Both are lost, yet the world approves one and rejects the other. Only the sage knows what to approve and what to reject."

Someone asked Liezi: "Why do you value emptiness?" Liezi replied: "Emptiness has no value." Liezi said: "Not in name—rather, in stillness, in emptiness. Stillness and emptiness find their proper place; grasping and giving lose theirs. When affairs are broken and ruined, then those who dance with benevolence and righteousness cannot restore them."

Zhou Xiong said: "The turning ceaselessly revolves; heaven and earth shift in secret—who perceives it? Thus what is diminished there is filled here; what is completed here is diminished there. Loss and gain, fullness and deficiency follow the age and follow death. Coming and going join in succession, with no gap to spare—who perceives it?

In truth, qi does not advance all at once, nor does form diminish all at once. One does not sense its presence, nor its loss. It is like a man from youth to old age: his appearance, complexion, wisdom, and bearing differ not a day, yet skin, nails, and hair fall away with the passing years—not that they paused in infancy and never changed. The change is imperceptible until afterward, when one knows."

In Qi there was a man who, worrying that heaven and earth would collapse and he would have no place to dwell, neglected sleep and food. Another, concerned for his concern, went to enlighten him, saying: "Heaven is but accumulated qi, with no place devoid of it. As you bend and stretch, breathe in and out, you move and rest within it all day—why fear collapse?" The man replied: "If heaven is indeed accumulated qi, should not the sun, moon, and stars fall?" The enlightener said: "The sun, moon, and stars are but luminous accumulations within qi; even if they fell, they could cause no harm." The man asked: "What of the earth’s ruin?" The enlightener said: "Earth is but accumulated clods, filling the four directions, with no place devoid of them. As you stride and tread, you move and rest upon it all day—why fear its ruin?" The man then relaxed, greatly delighted, and the enlightener likewise relaxed, greatly delighted.

Master Changlu heard and laughed: "Rainbows, clouds, mist, wind, rain, and the four seasons—these are the forms qi takes to compose heaven. Mountains, rivers, seas, metals, stones, fire, and wood—these are the forms matter takes to compose earth. Knowing qi accumulates, knowing clods accumulate, how can one say they do not decay? Heaven and earth are but a tiny thing within the void, the greatest within existence. That they are hard to exhaust, hard to fathom—this is certainly so; that they are hard to measure, hard to know—this is certainly so. To worry over their decay is indeed too distant; to say they do not decay is also incorrect. Heaven and earth cannot but decay, and when they do, they will return to decay. When that time comes, why should one not worry?"

Master Liezi heard and laughed: "To say heaven and earth decay is also mistaken; to say they do not decay is also mistaken. Decay and non-decay—I cannot know them. Nevertheless, that is one state, this is another. Thus the living do not know death, the dead do not know life; the coming do not know the going, the going do not know the coming. Decay and non-decay—why should I concern myself?"

Shun asked Zheng: "Can the Dao be possessed?" Zheng replied: "Your body is not your own—how can you possess the Dao?" Shun said: "If my body is not my own, then whose is it?" Zheng said: "It is heaven and earth’s entrusted form. Life is not your own—it is heaven and earth’s entrusted harmony. Nature and fate are not your own—it is heaven and earth’s entrusted compliance. Children and grandchildren are not your own—it is heaven and earth’s entrusted shedding. Thus one walks without knowing where one goes, abides without knowing what one holds, eats without knowing why. Heaven and earth are the powerful yang qi—how can they be possessed?"

In the state of Qi, Yue was immensely wealthy; in Song, the Xiang family was exceedingly poor.

Yue of Song traveled to Qi to seek his method. Guoshi said to him: "I am skilled in the art of thievery. When I first took up thievery, I had enough after one year, was content after two, and greatly prospered after three. From then on, my bounty extended to the entire district." Xiang was overjoyed, grasping the words of thievery but not its Dao. He then scaled walls and broke into chambers, seizing whatever his hands and eyes reached. Before long, he was caught for his crimes and stripped of his ancestral wealth.

Believing Guoshi had deceived him, Xiang went to reproach him. Guoshi asked: "How did you go about thieving?" Xiang recounted his actions. Guoshi exclaimed: "Alas! Have you so misunderstood the Dao of thievery? Now I shall tell you. I have heard that heaven has its seasons, earth its advantages. I steal heaven and earth’s timely benefits—the soaking nourishment of clouds and rain, the bounty of mountains and marshes—to grow my grain, cultivate my crops, build my walls, and construct my dwellings. On land, I steal from birds and beasts; in water, from fish and turtles—nothing is not stolen. Yet grain, crops, timber, birds, beasts, fish, and turtles are all born of heaven—how can they be mine? Thus, though I steal from heaven, I incur no misfortune.

Gold, jade, treasures, grain, silk, and wealth are what men amass—how can they be heaven’s gifts? If you steal these and are punished, whom can you blame?" Xiang was deeply perplexed, thinking Guoshi was again deceiving him. He went to consult Master Dongguo.

Master Dongguo said: "Is not your very body a form of theft? You steal the harmony of yin and yang to complete your life and sustain your form—how much more so with external things? Truly, heaven, earth, and the myriad things are inseparable. To claim possession of them is delusion. Guoshi’s theft is the public Dao, so he incurs no misfortune; your theft arises from private desire, so you are punished. Whether one acts with public or private motives, it is still theft; whether one advances without public or private intent, it is still theft. The interplay of public and private is the virtue of heaven and earth. Who, knowing this virtue, can be called a thief? Who can be called not a thief?"

Emperor Huangdi, Part Two

In the fifteenth year of his reign, the Yellow Emperor delighted in the five celestial supports bestowed upon him. He nurtured his proper destiny, gratified his ears and eyes, and sated his nose and mouth. Yet his complexion grew parched and sallow, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

Another fifteen years passed, and he grew anxious that the world remained ungoverned. He exhausted his wisdom and intelligence, exerted his strength, and toiled for the common people. Again, his complexion grew parched and sallow, and his five faculties dimmed in confusion.

The Yellow Emperor then sighed in lament, saying: "My excesses have been grievous indeed. Nurturing myself alone brought such affliction—how much more so governing the myriad things!"

Thereupon, he relinquished all state affairs, abandoned his palace chambers, dismissed his attendants, and stilled the bells and chimes. He reduced his meals, withdrew, and secluded himself in the Hall of the Great Courtyard. There, he purified his heart and disciplined his form, refraining from governance for three months.

One day, as he dozed, he dreamed of wandering in the land of Huaxu. The land of Huaxu lay west of Yan Prefecture and north of Tai Prefecture, its distance from Qi numbering thousands or tens of thousands of *li*—beyond the reach of boats, quadrupeds, or human strength, accessible only through spiritual wandering.

In that land, there were no rulers or leaders; all arose of itself.

The people there knew no cravings or desires; all arose of itself.
They knew not the joy of life, nor the dread of death, so none met untimely ends.
They knew not partiality toward themselves, nor estrangement from things, so none felt love or hatred.
They knew not defiance, nor compliance, so none encountered benefit or harm.
Nothing did they cherish, nothing did they fear.
Entering water, they did not drown; entering fire, they did not burn.
Strikes and blows brought no pain, pokes and prods no itch or irritation.
Treading the void as though on solid ground, resting in emptiness as though on a bed.
Clouds and mist did not obstruct their sight, thunder and lightning did not disturb their hearing.
Beauty and ugliness did not unsettle their hearts, mountains and valleys did not trip their steps—all was but spiritual wandering.

Awakening from his dream, the Yellow Emperor felt a profound contentment. He summoned Tian Lao, Li Mu, and Tai Shan Ji, and addressed them: "For three months I have secluded myself, purified my heart, and disciplined my form, seeking the Way to nurture the self and govern things, yet I found no method. Exhausted, I slept, and dreamed thus. Now I know the supreme Dao cannot be sought through human sentiment."

"I have grasped it! I have attained it! Yet I cannot convey it to you."

Twenty-eight years later, the realm reached great order, nearly resembling the land of Hua Xu. Then the Emperor ascended in transcendence, and the people mourned him for over two hundred years without cease.

Mount Lieguye rises amid the sea and rivers. Upon its summit dwells a divine being who drinks the wind and sips the dew, partaking not of the five grains. His heart is like a deep spring, his form like a maiden’s. He clings not, he loves not, yet immortals and sages serve as his ministers. He fears not, he rages not, yet the sincere and earnest act as his envoys. He bestows no favors, yet all things are self-sufficient. He gathers not, he hoards not, yet he lacks nothing. Yin and yang remain ever in harmony, sun and moon ever bright. The four seasons proceed in constant order, wind and rain in perfect balance. All things are nurtured in due season, the harvest ever abundant. The land knows no blight, the people no untimely death, creatures no blemish or plague, and ghosts no eerie resonance.

Liezi studied under Master Lao Shang and befriended Bo Gaozi. Having mastered the Way of these two, he rode the wind and returned home. Yin Sheng heard of this and followed Liezi, dwelling with him for months without thought of his own lodging. One day, he seized the opportunity to request the art, but though he asked ten times, ten times Liezi refused. Displeased, Yin Sheng asked to take his leave, yet Liezi gave no response. Yin Sheng withdrew.

Months later, his longing unabated, he returned to follow Liezi again. Liezi asked, "Why do you come and go so frequently?" Yin Sheng replied, "Before, when I, Zhang Dai, made my request, you would not teach me, and so I harbored resentment. Now, my heart is once more at ease, and thus I have returned." Liezi said, "I once thought you discerning—how base you have become! Ji, I shall now tell you what I learned from my master.

After I began serving my master and befriending such men, for three years my heart dared not ponder right and wrong, my mouth dared not speak of profit and harm. Only then did my master deign to glance at me. After five years, my heart again pondered right and wrong, my mouth again spoke of profit and harm, and my master at last relaxed his countenance in a smile. After seven years, I followed my heart’s inclinations without right or wrong, spoke as my mouth willed without profit or harm, and my master at last drew me to sit beside him on the mat. After nine years, whatever my heart conceived, whatever my mouth uttered, I knew not whether it was my own right or wrong, profit or harm, nor whether it was another’s. I knew not whether my master was my teacher or those men my friends—within and without, all had advanced. Thereafter, my eyes were as ears, my ears as nose, my nose as mouth; all were the same. My heart congealed, my form dissolved, flesh and bone fused into one. I no longer sensed the body’s support or the feet’s tread, drifting east and west with the wind like a withered leaf or empty husk. In the end, I knew not whether the wind bore me or I the wind."

Here now is your translation:

---

"Now you have dwelt but briefly at the Master’s gate, yet resentment and vexation have arisen again and again. Your slender frame will not endure the qi, your single limb will not be borne by the earth. How can one tread the void and ride the wind? How long could such a thing last?"

Yin-sheng flushed deeply, held his breath for a long while, and dared not speak again.

Liezi asked Guan-yin, “The perfected person walks through water without getting wet, treads fire without feeling heat, moves above the myriad things without trembling. May I ask how one attains this?”

Guan-yin replied, “This is the preservation of pure qi, not the realm of cunning, skill, or bold resolve. Foolish one! The fish speaks to you. Whatever has form, image, sound, or color is merely a thing. How can things be far removed from one another? Why should you strive to reach what came before? It is but form. Thus, things arise from the formless and come to rest where transformation ceases. Those who attain this and exhaust it—how could they be called correct? They abide in a depthless measure, conceal themselves in a traceless principle, and wander where the myriad things end and begin. They unify their nature, nourish their qi, embrace their virtue, and so penetrate to the source of things. Those who are thus preserve the wholeness of Heaven, their spirit knows no fissure—how could things find entry?

When a drunken man falls from a carriage, though the speed be great, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit is whole. He does not know when he rides, nor when he falls. Death and life, alarm and fear, do not enter his breast; thus he encounters things without dread. If one who is whole through wine can be like this, how much more one who is whole through Heaven? The sage hides in Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.”

Lie Yukou shot arrows for Bohun Maoren, drawing the bow to its fullest, placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrows, and the arrowheads followed one upon another, the shafts fitting perfectly into the nocks. In that moment, he was like a wooden figure.

Bohun Maoren said, “This is the shooting of one who shoots, not the shooting of one who does not shoot. Suppose I take you to climb a high mountain, tread on perilous rocks, and stand at the edge of a hundred-fathom abyss—could you still shoot then?”

Thereupon, Maoren ascended the high mountain, trod upon the perilous rocks, and stood at the edge of the hundred-fathom abyss. His back faced the void, his feet hung two-thirds over the edge, and he beckoned Yukou to advance. Yukou prostrated himself on the ground, sweat streaming down to his heels.

Bohun Maoren said, “The perfected man gazes upward into the blue sky, plunges downward into the Yellow Springs, and roams to the eight limits of the world—his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes; your inner strength is surely imperiled!”

The Fan clan had a son named Zihua, who was skilled at cultivating his private reputation. The entire state deferred to him; he was favored by the Lord of Jin yet held no office, ranking above the three ministers. Whatever he glanced at with partiality, the state ennobled; whatever he spoke of with disdain, the state demoted. Those who frequented his courtyard equaled the court officials in number.

Zihua employed his knights-errant to attack one another with cunning and vulgarity, to overpower the weak with the strong. Though they were wounded and broken before him, he paid no heed. Day and night, he made this his sport and amusement, until the state nearly became a custom.

Hesheng, Zibo, and Fan’s chief retainers once traveled beyond the fields and lodged at the dwelling of Tian Geng, a farmer named Shang Qiu Kai. In the middle of the night, Hesheng and Zibo spoke to each other of Zihua’s fame and power, how he could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich.

Shang Qiu Kai, who had long suffered from hunger and cold, secretly listened from behind the north window. He then borrowed provisions and a basket and went to Zihua’s gate. Zihua’s disciples were all from noble families, clad in white silk, riding in carriages, walking with slow steps and haughty gazes. When they saw Shang Qiu Kai—old, frail, dark-faced, and poorly dressed—they all sneered at him. Soon they grew familiar, mocking and deceiving him, pushing, shoving, and striking, doing whatever they pleased. Shang Qiu Kai never showed anger, and the guests’ tricks were simple, exhausted by their jesting.

Then they all ascended a high terrace, and amidst the crowd, someone idly said, “Whoever can throw themselves down will be rewarded with a hundred gold pieces.” The crowd all clamored to respond. Shang Qiu Kai believed it to be true and leapt down first, his form like a flying bird, landing lightly on the ground without injury to flesh or bone. Fan’s followers thought it a fluke and did not yet find it strange.

They then pointed to a deep bend in the river and said, “There is a treasure pearl in that water; if you swim, you can retrieve it.” Shang Qiu Kai again followed and swam, emerging with the pearl in hand. The crowd began to share their doubts.

Zihua then ordered that he be given meat to eat and silk to wear.

Suddenly, the Fan clan’s storehouse erupted in flames. Zihua said, “Whoever can enter the fire and retrieve silk will be rewarded according to the amount they bring out.” Shang Qiu Kai went without hesitation, his face showing no fear. He entered the fire and returned, his body unstained by soot, his flesh unscorched. The followers of the Fan clan, believing him to possess the Dao, gathered to apologize: “We did not know you possessed the Dao and thus deceived you. We did not know you were a divine being and thus humiliated you. You must think us fools, deaf, blind—we dare ask, what is your Dao?”

Shang Qiu Kai replied, “I have no Dao. Even my own heart does not know the reason. Nevertheless, there is one thing I can tell you. When your two guests lodged at my home, I heard them praise the power of the Fan clan, saying it could make the living perish and the dead live, the rich poor and the poor rich. I believed them wholeheartedly and came without delay. Upon arriving, I took your followers’ words as truth, fearing only that my belief was not sincere enough, that my actions fell short. I did not consider where my body might be placed or where profit and harm might lie. My heart was unified, nothing more. Where things do not oppose, it is just like this. Now that I know your followers deceived me, inwardly I harbor suspicion, outwardly I am cautious in what I see and hear. I recall with dread how I was not burned or drowned before, and my heart grows hot with alarm, my body trembles with fear. How could I dare approach fire or water again?”

From then on, the disciples of the Fan clan, whenever they encountered beggars or veterinarians on the road, dared not insult them but would alight from their carriages to bow. Zai Wo heard of this and told Confucius. Confucius said, “Did you not know?”

The man of utmost sincerity can move all things. He moves Heaven and Earth, stirs ghosts and spirits, and traverses the Six Directions without resistance—how could this be limited to treading perilous paths or entering water and fire? If Shang Qiu Kai’s belief in falsehoods still met no opposition, how much more when both parties are sincere? Remember this well!”

At the time, King Xuan of Zhou was inspecting the royal pastures when he encountered a servant named Liang Yang, who could raise wild birds and beasts. He kept them in the palace gardens, and even tigers, wolves, eagles, and osprey grew gentle under his care. Males and females gathered before him, breeding and thriving in groups. Different species lived together without attacking or biting one another. Fearing that Liang Yang’s skill would die with him, the king ordered Mao Qiu Yuan to learn it. Liang Yang said, “I am but a lowly servant—what skill could I teach you? I fear the king will think I am hiding something, so let me tell you my method for raising tigers. All creatures with blood and qi are by nature pleased when obeyed and angered when opposed. Yet their joy and rage are not recklessly expressed—they arise only when provoked. When feeding a tiger, one must not give it living prey, for it will grow enraged at having to kill; nor should one give it whole prey, for it will grow enraged at having to tear it apart. One must time its hunger and satiety, understand its temper. Though tigers and humans are of different kinds, they fawn upon those who tend them—this is obedience. Thus, to kill them is opposition. But I do not dare oppose them to provoke their anger, nor do I obey them to elicit their joy. For joy inevitably turns to anger, and anger often shifts to joy—neither is balanced. Now, my heart holds neither opposition nor obedience, so the birds and beasts regard me as one of their own. Thus, those that roam my garden do not long for distant forests or open marshes; those that rest in my courtyard do not yearn for deep mountains or secluded valleys. This is the principle at work.”

Yan Hui asked Confucius, “I once crossed the Shangshen Ford, where the ferryman handled the boat as if by divine skill. I asked him, ‘Can one learn to steer a boat?’ He said, ‘Yes. Those who can swim can be taught, and skilled swimmers learn quickly. As for divers, they have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease.’ I asked further, but he would not explain. May I ask what he meant?”

Confucius said, “Ah! You and I have long pondered its surface meaning, yet failed to grasp its essence—yet you still insist on discussing it. Those who can swim may be taught, for they are unburdened by water; skilled swimmers master it swiftly, for they have forgotten water altogether. As for divers who have never seen a boat yet handle it with ease—such men regard the depths as hills, and a capsized boat as a mere stumble in their chariot. When the myriad things lie arrayed before them, none can enter their dwelling; where could they find no leisure?

Those who play with clay are nimble; those who play with hooks grow cautious; those who play with gold grow dull. The skill is one, yet when they cling to externals, they weigh themselves down. All who weigh externals grow clumsy within.”

Confucius observed the Lüliang Falls, where the water plunged thirty *ren* and the spray stretched thirty *li*, a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles could not swim. He saw a man swimming there and took him for one in distress, seeking death. He sent his disciples along the current to rescue him. After several hundred paces, the man emerged, hair unbound, singing as he strolled along the bank. Confucius followed and asked him, “The Lüliang Falls plunge thirty *ren*, and the spray stretches thirty *li*—a place where soft-shelled turtles, alligators, fish, and turtles cannot swim. When I saw you enter, I thought you were in distress, seeking death, and sent my disciples along the current to save you. Yet you emerged, unbound your hair, and sang as you walked. I took you for a ghost, but now I see you are a man. May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?”

The man said, “No, I have no Dao. I began with habit, grew with nature, and fulfilled my fate. I enter with the current and emerge with the flow, following the water’s Dao without imposing my will. This is how I tread it.”

Confucius said, “What do you mean by beginning with habit, growing with nature, and fulfilling fate?”

The man said, “I was born on the hills and am at ease on the hills—this is habit. I grew up in water and am at ease in water—this is nature. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is fate.”

Confucius traveled to Chu and, passing through a forest, saw a hunchback catching cicadas as if plucking them. Confucius said, “You are skillful! Is there a Dao to this?”

The man said, “I have a Dao.”

“In five or six months, if I stack two pellets and they do not fall, I lose only a fraction; if I stack three and they do not fall, I lose one in ten; if I stack five and they do not fall, I pluck them as easily as if they were cicadas. My stance is like a withered stump, my arm steady as a dead tree’s branch. Though heaven and earth are vast and the ten thousand things many, I know only the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, nor do I let the ten thousand things distract me from the cicada’s wings—how could I fail?”

Confucius turned to his disciples and said, “When the will is undivided, it congeals into spirit. This is what the hunchbacked elder means!”

The elder said, “You, a scholar in fine robes—what do you know of such things? Cultivate what sustains you, then perhaps you may speak of loftier matters.”

There was a man by the sea who loved gulls. Each morning he went to the shore and wandered among them, and the gulls that came to him numbered in the hundreds. His father said, “I hear the gulls all follow you. Bring some back so I may play with them.” The next day, when he went to the shore, the gulls danced above but would not descend.

Thus it is said: the ultimate word leaves words behind, the ultimate act is non-action; what even wisdom knows is shallow.

Lord Xiang of Zhao led a retinue of one hundred thousand to hunt in Mount Zhong, setting the undergrowth ablaze and scorching the forest for a hundred li. Amid the flames, a man emerged from a stone cliff, rising and falling with the smoke and embers. The crowd called him a ghostly apparition. When the fire passed, he walked out unhurriedly, as if untouched by what he had traversed.

Xiangzi detained him in astonishment and observed him closely: his form, complexion, and seven orifices were those of a man; his breath and voice were those of a man. Xiangzi asked, “By what way did you dwell in stone? By what way did you enter fire?” The man replied, “What thing do you call stone? What thing do you call fire?” Xiangzi said, “What you just emerged from was stone; what you just passed through was fire.” The man said, “I do not know.”

Marquis Wen of Wei heard of this and asked Zixia, “What manner of man was he?” Zixia said, “From what I have heard of the Master’s teachings, one who harmonizes attains great unity with things, so that nothing can harm or obstruct him. To wander through metal and stone or tread through water and fire would then be possible.” The Marquis said, “Why do you not do this?” Zixia said, “To hollow out the heart and cast off knowledge—this I have not yet been able to do. Nevertheless, I shall attempt to speak of it when I have leisure.” The Marquis said, “Why does the Master not do this?” Zixia said, “The Master is capable of it but capable of not doing it.” The Marquis was greatly pleased.

A divine diviner from Qi arrived in Zheng and was called Jixian. He could foretell a person’s death or life, survival or ruin, fortune or misfortune, long life or early death—down to the year, month, ten-day period, or day—with the precision of a spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. When Liezi saw him, he was enraptured and returned to tell Master Huqiu, saying, “At first I thought your Way was supreme, but now there is something even more supreme.” Huzi said, “I have shown you only its outward form, not yet its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? If you oppose the world with the Dao, you will surely be believed. That is why he was able to read your fortune. Try bringing him here and let me show myself to him.”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi. When they came out, Jixian said to Liezi, “Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. He cannot last ten days. I saw something strange: I saw damp ashes.” Liezi went in, his tears soaking his lapels, and told Huzi. Huzi said, “Just now I showed him the pattern of earth—still and unmoving, as if my virtue were sealed. He likely saw me with my power of life nearly extinguished. Bring him again!”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi again. When they came out, Jixian said to Liezi, “Fortunate that your master met me—he is recovering. There is life in the ashes now. I saw his power of life restrained.” Liezi went in and told Huzi. Huzi said, “Just now I showed him the pattern of heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from the heels. This is the restraint of life. He likely saw the nearness of my good fortune. Bring him again!”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi again. When they came out, Jixian said to Liezi, “Your master did not fast before sitting—there was nothing I could discern. Let him fast, and I will observe him once more.” Liezi went in and told Huzi. Huzi said, “Just now I showed him the formless state of the Great Thoroughfare—he likely saw the balance of my qi at its limit. The whirlpool of the salamander’s pool forms a deep, the whirlpool of still water forms a deep, the whirlpool of flowing water forms a deep, the whirlpool of overflowing water forms a deep, the whirlpool of surging water forms a deep, the whirlpool of spring water forms a deep, the whirlpool of dammed water forms a deep, the whirlpool of turbid water forms a deep, the whirlpool of rich water forms a deep—these are the Nine Deeps. Bring him again!”

The next day, Liezi brought him to see Huzi again. Jixian had not yet settled when he lost himself and fled. Huzi said, “Pursue him!” Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. He returned and reported to Huzi, saying, “He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.” Huzi said, “Just now I showed him what had never yet departed from my origin. I met him with emptiness and drifting change, so that he knew not who or what I was. He took me for drifting reeds, for flowing waves—thus he fled.”

After this, Liezi considered himself as one who had never yet begun to learn. He returned home and did not go out for three years. He cooked for his wife, fed pigs as he would feed people, and took no partiality in affairs. Carved jade returned to plain stone; he stood alone in his form, sealed and bound, and remained thus to the end.

When Liezi was traveling to Qi, he turned back halfway. He encountered Bohun Maoren, who said, “Why have you returned?” Liezi said, “I was startled.” “What startled you?” “I ate at ten millet-drink stalls, and at five of them they served me first.” Bohun Maoren said, “If that is so, why were you startled?” Liezi said, “When inner sincerity is not dissolved, the outward form shines with radiance, overawing others’ hearts and making them slight the noble and the aged, dismissing their concerns. Those millet-drink sellers merely deal in food and broth, seeking small profits and slight gains—yet even they acted thus. How much more would a lord of ten thousand chariots, wearied in body by the state and exhausted in wisdom by affairs, entrust me with tasks and demand results from me? That is why I was startled.”

Bohun Maoren said, “A fine observation! If you conduct yourself thus, others will protect you.” Soon after, Liezi went to visit him, and the shoes outside his door filled the entrance. Bohun Maoren stood facing north, leaning on his staff and pressing it against his chin. After a while, he said nothing and went out. The attendant told Liezi, who rushed barefoot, shoes in hand, to the gate. He asked, “Since you have come, Master, have you not neglected your medicine?” Bohun Maoren said, “It is done. I told you before that others would protect you—now they truly protect you.”

“It is not that you can make others protect you, but that you cannot prevent others from protecting you—why then be moved by this? Being moved produces strange outcomes. Moreover, if one must be moved, it unsettles one’s root and self—what meaning does that have? Among those who travel with you, none will tell you this. Their petty words are all poison to men. If none awaken, none comprehend, how can they be your true companions?”

Yang Zhu journeyed south to Pei, while Lao Dan traveled west to Qin. They met by chance in the outskirts. When they reached Liang, Laozi looked up to heaven and sighed midway, saying, “At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.” Yang Zhu did not reply. Upon arriving at their lodging, he brought water for washing, a towel, and a comb, removed his shoes outside the door, and advanced on his knees, saying, “Earlier, Master, you looked up to heaven and sighed, saying, ‘At first I thought you could be taught, but now you cannot.’ Your disciple wished to ask for an explanation, but the journey afforded no leisure, so I dared not speak. Now that you are at leisure, I beg to hear where I have erred.” Laozi said, “Your gaze is haughty, your bearing arrogant—with whom could you dwell? The purest white seems tarnished; the greatest virtue seems insufficient.” Yang Zhu’s expression changed abruptly, and he said, “I respectfully receive your instruction.”

On his earlier journey, when he arrived at an inn, the innkeeper’s family welcomed him, the master of the house took up the mat, his wife held the towel and comb, the inn’s servants withdrew from their seats, and the kitchen staff left the hearth. On his return, the inn’s servants vied with him for seats.

Yang Zhu passed through Song and stayed at an inn in the east. The innkeeper had two concubines: one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was honored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason. The innkeeper’s young servant replied, “The beautiful one is conscious of her beauty, so I do not see her as beautiful. The plain one is conscious of her plainness, so I do not see her as plain.” Yangzi said, “Disciples, take note! Act with worthiness but abandon the conduct of self-regard—wherever you go, will you not be loved?”

In the world, there is a Way that always prevails, and a Way that does not always prevail.

The Way that always prevails is called softness; the Way that does not always prevail is called strength. Though both are known, people do not understand them. Thus, the ancients said: "Strength first confronts those not equal to oneself; softness first emerges from oneself. Confronting those not equal to oneself, when one reaches those equal to oneself, one is imperiled. Emerging from oneself, there is no peril. Using this to overcome a single person is like overcoming a multitude; using this to bear the world is like bearing nothing. This is called overcoming without overcoming oneself, bearing without bearing.

Master Zhou said: "To desire hardness, one must guard it with softness; to desire strength, one must preserve it with weakness. Accumulating softness must yield hardness; accumulating weakness must yield strength. Observe what is accumulated, and you will know the direction of fortune and misfortune. Strength overcomes those not equal to oneself, but when it reaches those equal to oneself, it is brittle. Softness overcomes what emerges from oneself—its power cannot be measured."

Laozi said: "Arms that are strong will perish. Wood that is strong will break. The soft and weak are the companions of life; the hard and strong are the companions of death."

Appearance need not be childlike, yet wisdom may be childlike; wisdom need not be childlike, yet appearance may be childlike. The sage embraces childlike wisdom and discards childlike appearance, while the multitude clings to childlike appearance and distances itself from childlike wisdom. Those whose appearance resembles their own, they draw near and love; those whose appearance differs, they distance and fear. Possessing a seven-foot frame, distinct hands and feet, hair upon the head and teeth within the mouth, standing upright and moving forward—this is called a human. Yet humans are not without the hearts of beasts; though they may harbor the hearts of beasts, by appearance they are deemed kin. Bearing wings and horns, fangs and claws spread wide, soaring aloft or crouching to run—this is called a beast. Yet beasts are not without the hearts of humans; though they may possess human hearts, by appearance they are held at a distance.

Fu Xi, Nü Wa, Shen Nong, and the Xia sovereigns had serpentine bodies and human faces, bovine heads and tiger noses—these bore non-human forms yet possessed the great virtue of sages. Jie of Xia, Zhou of Yin, Duke Huan of Lu, and King Mu of Chu had the seven apertures of human visage, all identical to man, yet harbored the hearts of beasts. The multitude clings to a single appearance in pursuit of supreme wisdom—this is hardly attainable.

The Yellow Emperor and the Flame Emperor clashed on the wilds of Banquan, leading bears, brown bears, wolves, leopards, lynxes, and tigers as vanguard, with eagles, hawks, falcons, and kites as banners—this was commanding beasts by force. Yao tasked Kui with overseeing music, striking and tapping stones, and the hundred beasts danced in unison; when the *Xiao Shao* melody reached its ninth movement, the phoenix came to pay homage—this was summoning beasts by sound. If this is so, then how do the hearts of beasts differ from those of humans? Their forms and sounds differ from man’s, yet the way to engage them is unknown. The sage knows all and penetrates all, thus able to lead and employ them. The wisdom of beasts naturally aligns with that of humans in some respects; in regulating desires and preserving life, they do not borrow wisdom from man.

Male and female pair, mother and child bond; they avoid level ground and seek perilous heights, shun cold and pursue warmth. At rest, they form groups; in motion, they move in ranks. The small dwell within, the strong without; when drinking, they accompany one another, when feeding, they call in flocks. In the age of great antiquity, they dwelt alongside humans and walked among them. In the age of emperors and kings, they began to scatter in alarm and disorder. By the degenerate age, they hid and fled, evading harm. Now, in the land of the Jie people of the east, there are those who frequently understand the speech of the six domestic animals—this is but a partial knowledge. The divine sages of great antiquity fully comprehended the dispositions of all things and entirely understood the sounds of different species. They gathered and assembled them, trained and instructed them, making them equal to the people. Thus, they first convened ghosts, spirits, and demons, then connected with the peoples of the eight directions, and finally assembled beasts, insects, and moths. For those with blood and qi, the hearts and minds are not so distant. The divine sages, knowing this, left nothing untaught in their instruction.

In Song there was a man called Master Ju, who loved macaques and raised them in troops, able to comprehend their intentions; the macaques, too, understood his heart. He diminished his household’s provisions to satisfy the macaques’ desires. Soon, however, he faced scarcity and sought to limit their food. Fearing the macaques would not submit, he first deceived them, saying: “I will give you chestnuts—three in the morning and four in the evening. Is that enough?” The macaques all rose in anger. Then he said: “I will give you chestnuts—four in the morning and three in the evening. Is that enough?” The macaques all prostrated themselves in delight. Things are ensnared by their own abilities and vulgarity, all in this manner. The sage ensnares the multitude of fools with wisdom, just as Master Ju ensnared the macaques with his cunning. Names and realities remain unharmed, yet their joy and anger are manipulated!

Ji Shengzi reared fighting cocks for King Xuan of Zhou. After ten days, the king asked: “Are the cocks ready to fight?” He replied: “Not yet. They are still empty and arrogant, relying on their qi.” Ten days later, the king asked again...

He replied: “Not yet. They still react to shadows and echoes.” Ten days later, the king asked again. He said: “Not yet. They still glare fiercely and bristle with qi.” After another ten days, the king asked once more. He said: “Almost. Though other cocks may crow, this one shows no change. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock—its virtue is complete. No other cock dares respond; they turn and flee.”

Hui Ang sought an audience with King Kang of Song. The king stamped his feet, cleared his throat, and spoke rapidly: “What pleases me are courage and strength, not benevolence and righteousness. What instruction do you bring me?” Hui Ang replied: “I possess a Way by which, though a man be brave, his blade will not pierce; though he be strong, his blows will not strike. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “Excellent. This is what I desire to learn.” Hui Ang continued: “Yet if blades do not pierce and blows do not strike, this is still a form of disgrace. I possess a Way by which, though a man be brave, he will not dare to stab; though he be strong, he will not dare to strike. This lack of daring is not due to the absence of intent. I possess a Way by which a man fundamentally lacks such intent. Without intent, there is no thought of love or profit. I possess a Way by which all men and women under heaven joyfully desire to love and benefit one another. This surpasses courage and strength—it is the highest of the four grades. Does Your Majesty not wish to hear of it?” The king said: “This is what I truly wish to attain.” Hui Ang replied: “Confucius and Mozi embodied this. Kong Qiu and Mo Di, though they held no land as lords nor offices as ministers, all men and women under heaven craned their necks and stood on tiptoe, yearning for their peace and benefit. Now, Your Majesty rules a state of ten thousand chariots. If you truly embrace this intent, all within your four borders will receive its benefit. You would far surpass Kong and Mo.” The king had no reply. Hui Ang hurried out. The king said to his attendants: “How persuasive was that guest in convincing me!”

King Mu of Zhou the Third.

During the reign of King Mu of Zhou, a transcendent being from the farthest western lands arrived. He could enter water and fire unscathed, pass through metal and stone; reverse mountains and rivers, relocate cities and towns. Riding the void without falling, touching solidity without obstruction, his thousand transformations and ten thousand changes knew no limit. Having altered the forms of things, he could also shift the thoughts of men. King Mu revered him as a deity and served him as a lord. He yielded his own chambers for the transcendent’s dwelling, offered the three sacrificial animals, and selected female musicians to entertain him.

The transcendent deemed the king’s palace too humble and unfit to reside in, the royal kitchen’s fare too rank and coarse to partake of, and the king’s consorts too foul and unlovely to embrace. King Mu thereupon ordered its reconstruction. Every craft of earth and timber, every hue of ochre and whitewash, was employed without reserve. The five treasuries were emptied before the tower was completed. Rising a thousand *ren* in height, it overlooked the summit of Mount Zhongnan and was named the Terrace of Central Heaven. The fairest maidens of Zheng and Wei—lithe, graceful, and supple—were chosen. They were anointed with fragrant balms, their moth-like brows made straight, hairpins and earrings set in place, clad in fine silk and trailing skirts of layered gauze. Their faces were powdered white and their temples darkened with black pigment, jade pendants and rings adorning their waists. They were perfumed with mixed orchid and angelica, and entertained with the melodies of *Chengyun*, *Liuying*, *Jiushao*, and *Chenlu*. Each day and month, they presented robes of jade; every dawn, they offered jade delicacies. Yet the transcendent remained discontent, and only with reluctance did he deign to ascend.

Before long, he invited the king to journey with him. The king grasped the sleeves of his attendants, and together they soared upward until they reached the Terrace of Central Heaven. There, they beheld the transcendent’s palace, constructed of gold and silver and adorned with pearls and jade. It rose above the clouds and rain, its foundations unseen, appearing like a mass of gathered mist. All that met the eye and ear, all that entered the nose and mouth, was unlike anything in the mortal realm. The king truly believed it to be the Celestial Capital, the Purple Tenuity, the Grand Harmony of Heaven, the abode of the Emperor. Looking down, he saw his own palace pavilions like piled clods and heaps of straw.

The king, dwelling there for what seemed decades, forgot his kingdom entirely. The transcendent again invited him to journey, and wherever they went, neither sun nor moon was visible above, nor rivers nor seas below. The radiance that shone dazzled the king’s eyes so he could not see; the sounds that came overwhelmed his ears so he could not hear. His hundred bones and six viscera trembled and could not settle. His mind wandered, his spirit scattered, and he begged the transcendent to return. The transcendent moved him, and the king felt as if he were falling into the void. When he awoke, he was still seated where he had been before, his attendants unchanged. Before him, the wine remained unclarified, the dishes uneaten. The king asked where he had come from. His attendants replied, “Your Majesty was lost in silent contemplation.”

Thereafter, King Mu was disoriented for three months before recovering. He questioned the transcendent further, who replied: “I traveled with Your Majesty in spirit—how could your form have moved? Moreover, what difference is there between the place we visited and your own palace? What difference between the realms we traversed and your own domains? Your Majesty merely experienced a fleeting lapse of ordinary perception. The extremes of transformation, whether swift or gradual, can all be mirrored—how could they be fully grasped?”

The king was overjoyed. He neglected state affairs, took no pleasure in his ministers and consorts, and indulged in distant wanderings. He commanded his eight steeds to be harnessed: on the right of the lead chariot, *Hua* and *Liu*; on the left, *Lü’er*; on the right of the outer pair, *Chiji*; and on the left, *Baijian*. *Zaofu* drove the main chariot, with *Daojiong* as his attendant. The second chariot bore *Quhuang* on the right and *Yulun* on the left, with *Daoli* on the left outer horse and *Shanzi* on the right. *Boyao* drove, with *Sanbai* as his attendant and *Benrong* as his aide.

They galloped a thousand *li* to the land of the Giant Sou. The Giant Sou offered the blood of white swans for the king to drink, and the milk of cows and horses to wash his feet and those of his two chariot attendants. After drinking, they departed and lodged at the foothills of Kunlun, on the sunny side of the Red Water. The next day, they ascended the heights of Kunlun to view the Lü of the Yellow Emperor, and sealed it to bequeath to later generations. Then they were received as guests by the Queen Mother of the West, who toasted the king at the Jade Pool. The Queen Mother sang for the king, who joined in harmony; her song was mournful. They observed the place where the sun sets, traveling ten thousand *li* in a single day.

The king sighed and said: “Alas! I, alone, am deficient in virtue yet harmonious in pleasure—will later generations recount my transgressions?” Was King Mu not nearly a transcendent being? He exhausted the joys of his lifetime, yet lived a hundred years before passing. The world regarded him as having ascended to the realm of the immortals.

Lao Chengzi studied illusion under Master Yin Wen for three years without receiving instruction. Lao Chengzi requested to be told his faults and sought to withdraw. Master Yin Wen bowed and led him into a chamber, dismissed his attendants, and said: “Long ago, when the Old Master Laozi departed for the west, he turned to me and said: ‘The qi of living beings, the forms of material things—all are illusion. That which begins with creation and transforms through yin and yang is called life and death. To exhaust the numbers and comprehend the changes, to follow form and shift accordingly, is called transformation and illusion. The Creator’s craft is subtle, its work profound—truly difficult to exhaust or complete. Those who rely on form display their craft openly, their work shallow, and so arise and vanish in an instant. Only when you understand that illusion and transformation are no different from life and death can you begin to study illusion. You and I are also illusion—what need is there to learn?’”

Lao Chengzi returned home and, reflecting deeply on Master Yin Wen’s words for three months, attained the ability to control existence and nonexistence at will, to reverse the four seasons: summoning thunder in winter, creating ice in summer; making the flying run and the running fly.

He guarded his arts throughout his life, and so the world never transmitted them.

Master Liezi said: "Those who excel in transformation take flight. He guarded his arts throughout his life, and so the world never transmitted them."

Master Liezi said: "Those who excel in transformation keep their Dao concealed in the commonplace, their achievements indistinguishable from others’. The virtue of the Five Emperors and the accomplishments of the Three Kings were not necessarily all due to wisdom or courage—some were achieved through transformation. Who can fathom this?"

Awakening has eight signs; dreaming has six manifestations.
What are the eight signs?
First, the familiar; second, the intentional; third, the attained; fourth, the lost; fifth, sorrow; sixth, joy; seventh, life; eighth, death. These eight signs are what form encounters.
What are the six manifestations?
First, the ordinary dream; second, the confused dream; third, the thought dream; fourth, the waking dream; fifth, the joyful dream; sixth, the fearful dream. These six are what spirit engages.
Those who do not recognize the origin of sensory changes are perplexed when events arise, unaware of their causes. Those who recognize the origin of sensory changes understand the causes when events arise. Understanding their causes, they remain unperturbed.

The ebb and flow, waxing and waning of a single body all communicate with Heaven and Earth and respond to other beings. Thus, when yin qi is strong, one dreams of wading through great waters in terror; when yang qi is strong, one dreams of traversing great fires and burning; when both yin and yang are strong, one dreams of life and death. When overly full, one dreams of giving; when overly hungry, one dreams of taking. Those whose illness is floating and hollow dream of soaring; those whose illness is sunken and solid dream of drowning. Sleeping with a belt across the body, one dreams of snakes; if a bird pecks at one’s hair, one dreams of flying. Approaching yin, one dreams of fire; approaching illness, one dreams of eating. Those who drink wine grieve; those who sing and dance weep.

Master Liezi said: "Spiritual encounter produces dreams; physical contact produces events. Thus, daytime thoughts become nighttime dreams—what spirit and form encounter. Therefore, when spirit is concentrated, thoughts and dreams dissolve of themselves. Trusting wakefulness, one does not speak; trusting dreams, one does not comprehend—these are the comings and goings of the transformation of things. The true persons of old forgot themselves when awake and did not dream when asleep. Could this be mere empty talk?"

In the southwestern corner of the farthest west lies a country whose borders are unknown, called the Land of Ancient Wilderness. The qi of yin and yang do not intersect there, so cold and heat are indistinguishable; the light of the sun and moon does not reach it, so day and night are indistinguishable. Its people neither eat nor wear clothes but sleep often. They awaken once every fifty days, taking what they do in dreams as real and what they see when awake as illusory.

The Central Kingdom spans the four seas, crossing the Yellow River north and south, the Tai Mountains east and west, for over ten thousand li. Its yin and yang are precisely measured, so one cold and one heat alternate; the division of dusk and dawn is clear, so one day and one night alternate. Its people possess both wisdom and foolishness. The myriad things flourish, and skills and arts abound. There are rulers and subjects in mutual governance, rituals and laws in mutual support. Their deeds and undertakings are beyond counting.

One waking and one sleep—they take what they do when awake as real and what they see in dreams as false.

At the northeasternmost corner lies a land called the State of Fuluo. Its earthly qi is oppressively hot, and though the lingering light of the sun and moon shines upon its soil, no fine crops grow there. Its people eat grass roots and tree fruits, knowing nothing of cooked food. Their nature is fierce and violent; the strong trample the weak, prizing victory and scorning righteousness. They run swiftly and rest little, ever wakeful and never sleeping.

The grand steward Yin of Zhou amassed vast wealth, and his subordinates toiled without respite from dawn till dusk. An old laborer, his strength spent, was yet driven to greater exertion. By day, he groaned as he worked; by night, utterly exhausted, he slept soundly. His spirit scattered and lost, each night he dreamed of being a ruler—lording over his people, governing the affairs of state, wandering through palaces and gardens, indulging every desire, his joy boundless. When he awoke, he returned to servitude. Someone sought to console him for his toil, but the laborer said, “A man’s life spans a hundred years, divided equally between day and night. By day, I am a slave, and though it is bitter, it is bitter indeed; by night, I am a lord, and my joy is unmatched. What cause have I to complain?”

Steward Yin’s heart was consumed by worldly affairs, his thoughts fixed on his family’s estate. Both mind and body wearied, he too slept in exhaustion each night. Every night, he dreamed of being a servant—running errands, performing every task, enduring endless scoldings and beatings. In his sleep, he moaned and cried out until dawn. Troubled, Yin consulted a friend. The friend said, “Your rank brings you honor, and your wealth is more than enough—you surpass others by far. To dream at night of being a servant, alternating hardship and ease, is but the common course of things. How could you hope to have both waking and dreaming as you wish?”

When Yin heard his friend’s words, he eased the laborer’s workload and reduced his own burdensome thoughts. His illness gradually improved.

A man of Zheng was gathering firewood in the wild when he encountered a startled deer. He chased it down and struck it dead. Fearing others would see, he hastily hid it in a ditch, covering it with plantain leaves, his joy overwhelming. Soon after, he forgot where he had hidden it and took the whole affair for a dream. As he walked along, he recounted the tale aloud. A passerby overheard, followed his words, and took the deer. Upon returning home, he told his wife, “A woodcutter dreamed he had caught a deer but forgot where he hid it. Now I have it—he was truly the one dreaming!”

His wife said, “Are you not the one who dreamed of the woodcutter finding the deer? Was there ever a woodcutter at all? Now that you truly have the deer, is your dream the real one?”

The husband replied, “I possess the deer—what need have I to know whether he dreamed or I dreamed?”

When the woodcutter returned, distressed at losing the deer, that night he truly dreamed of where he had hidden it and of the man who had taken it. At daybreak, he followed his dream and found the man. They took their dispute to court, where the magistrate ruled: “At first, you truly caught the deer but mistakenly called it a dream; now you truly dreamed of the deer but mistakenly call it real. He truly took the deer, and now you dispute it with him. His wife claims you dreamed of recognizing another’s deer, so no one has the deer. But since he now holds it, let it be divided between you.” The case was reported to the lord of Zheng.

The lord of Zheng exclaimed, “Ah! Is the magistrate about to dream of dividing another’s deer?” He sought the counsel of his prime minister.

The prime minister said, “Whether it is a dream or not, I cannot discern. To distinguish waking from dreaming, only the Yellow Emperor or Confucius could do so. Now that they are gone, who can settle this? For now, let us follow the magistrate’s judgment.”

Hua Zi of Yangli in Song, afflicted in middle age with forgetfulness, would take something in the morning and forget it by evening, receive something at dusk and forget it by dawn. On the road, he forgot to walk; in his chamber, he forgot to sit. He no longer recognized what came before, nor remembered what came after. His entire household suffered from this. He consulted diviners and sought divination, but no omen appeared; he visited shamans and prayed, but the affliction remained unchecked; he sought physicians and underwent treatment, but it did not cease.

A scholar from Lu, offering himself as one who could cure him, met with Hua Zi’s wife, who pledged half of their household property in exchange for his method. The scholar said, “This is certainly not a condition that divination by tortoise shell or milfoil can address, nor one that prayers can remedy, nor one that acupuncture or medicine can cure. Let me attempt to transform his heart and alter his thoughts—perhaps then he may recover!”

Thereupon, he exposed Hua Zi to the cold to see if he would seek clothing; made him hungry to see if he would seek food; confined him in darkness to see if he would seek light. The scholar joyfully told Hua Zi’s son, “The illness can be cured! However, my method is a closely guarded family secret, not to be disclosed to others. Let us dismiss all attendants and remain alone with him in the chamber for seven days.” They complied.

No one knew what he did, yet an ailment of many years vanished in a single morning.

Hua Zi, having awakened, flew into a great rage. He cast out his wife, punished his son, and brandished a halberd to chase away the scholar. The people of Song seized him and demanded his reasons.

Hua Zi said, “Before, I was in oblivion—so vast and boundless that I did not even perceive the existence of heaven and earth. Now, suddenly awakened, I recall the past decades: all the gains and losses, life and death, sorrows and joys, loves and hates—ten thousand threads of disturbance arise at once. I fear that in the days to come, the turmoil of gains and losses, life and death, sorrows and joys, loves and hates will again disorder my heart. Could I ever recover even a moment’s forgetfulness?”

Zi Gong heard of this and found it strange. He reported it to Confucius. Confucius said, “This is not something within your grasp!” Then, turning to Yan Hui, he instructed him to record it.

Among the people of Qin, the Pang family had a son who was clever in his youth but, upon reaching adulthood, developed an illness of delusion and confusion. He heard singing and mistook it for weeping; saw white and took it for black; smelled fragrance and thought it rotten; tasted sweetness and deemed it bitter; considered wrongs as rights. Whatever his mind turned to—heaven and earth, the four directions, water and fire, cold and heat—all were inverted and disordered.

The Yang family said to his father, “The gentlemen of Lu possess many arts and skills. Might they be able to cure him? Why not seek their help?” His father traveled to Lu but, passing through Chen, encountered Lao Dan. He told him of his son’s condition.

Lao Dan said, “How do you know your son is deluded? Nowadays, all the people in the world are confused about right and wrong, blinded by profit and harm. Those afflicted with the same malady are many, yet none are awakened. Moreover, the delusion of one man is not enough to overturn a household; the delusion of one household is not enough to overturn a village; the delusion of one village is not enough to overturn a state; the delusion of one state is not enough to overturn the world. If the entire world were deluded, who could overturn it? If all the people in the world had hearts like your son’s, then *you* would be the deluded one. Who can correct the distinctions of sorrow and joy, sound and color, scent and taste, right and wrong? Furthermore, my words may not themselves be free of delusion—how much less can the gentlemen of Lu, mere waystations of delusion, resolve another’s confusion? Take your provisions and hasten home.”

A man of Yan was born in Yan, raised in Chu, and in his old age returned to his native land. Passing through the state of Jin, his traveling companions deceived him, pointing to a city and saying, “This is the city of Yan.” The man’s expression darkened with sorrow. They pointed to a shrine and said, “This is the shrine of your village.” He sighed deeply. They pointed to a house and said, “This is your ancestors’ home.” Tears welled in his eyes. They pointed to a mound and said, “This is your ancestors’ grave.” He wept uncontrollably. His companions burst into laughter, saying, “We were only jesting with you—this is Jin, not Yan.” The man was overcome with shame. When he finally reached Yan and truly saw the city and shrines of Yan, truly saw his ancestors’ home and grave, his sorrow was but faint.

Confucius was at leisure in his chamber when Zigong entered to attend him, his face clouded with worry. Zigong dared not ask, but upon leaving, he told Yan Hui. Yan Hui took up his zither and began to sing. Hearing this, Confucius summoned Yan Hui and asked, “Why do you alone find joy?” Yan Hui replied, “Why does the Master alone bear sorrow?” Confucius said, “First speak of your own aspirations.” Yan Hui said, “I once heard the Master say, ‘One who delights in the Dao and understands fate has no cause for sorrow’—this is why I find joy.”

Confucius’ expression grew solemn, and after a pause he said, “Did I truly say such a thing? You have misunderstood my meaning. That was merely my teaching of old. Let my words of today be taken as correct.”

You have merely grasped that delighting in the Dao and understanding fate brings freedom from sorrow, yet you do not know that delighting in the Dao and understanding fate entails a sorrow of the greatest magnitude. Now I shall tell you the truth of the matter.

To cultivate the self alone, to accept poverty or prosperity, to know that past and future are not one’s own, to banish disturbance from the heart and mind—this is what you call delighting in the Dao and understanding fate, free from sorrow. But in the past, I studied the *Odes* and *Documents*, rectified ritual and music, all with the intent to order the world and bequeath it to future generations—not merely to cultivate myself or govern the state of Lu. Yet the rulers and ministers of Lu daily grow more disordered, benevolence and righteousness ever more diminished, human nature ever more shallow. If the Way cannot prevail even in one state or in this present age, how much less can it prevail in the world or in ages to come?

I first realized that the *Odes*, *Documents*, ritual, and music were powerless to avert disorder, and I had not yet discerned the means to reform them—this is the sorrow of one who delights in the Dao and understands fate. Nevertheless, I have now grasped it. What is meant by “delighting and knowing” is not what the ancients called delight and knowledge. To be without delight and without knowledge—this is true delight and true knowledge. Thus, there is nothing one does not delight in, nothing one does not know, nothing one does not sorrow over, nothing one does not do. Why then abandon the *Odes*, *Documents*, ritual, and music? Why seek to reform them?

Yan Hui faced north, bowed deeply, and said, “I too have grasped it.” He went out and told Zigong. Zigong stood in a daze, lost in thought, and returned home to brood for seven days without sleep or food, until his frame was reduced to bone. Yan Hui went again to enlighten him, whereupon he returned to Confucius’ gate, strumming the zither and chanting the texts, never ceasing for the rest of his life.

A minister from Chen, on a diplomatic mission to Lu, had a private audience with the Viscount of Shusun. The Viscount said, “There is a sage in our state.” The minister asked, “Is it not Kong Qiu?” “It is,” he replied. “How do you know he is a sage?” The Viscount of Shusun said, “I have often heard Yan Hui say, ‘Kong Qiu can still the mind and employ the body.’”

The minister from Chen said, “There is also a sage in our state—did you not know?” “Who is this sage?” he asked. “Among the disciples of Lao Dan, there is one named Kang Cang, who has attained Lao Dan’s Way and can see with his ears and hear with his eyes.” When the Duke of Lu heard this, he was greatly astonished and sent his highest minister with lavish gifts to summon him. Kang Cang accepted the invitation and arrived.

The Duke of Lu, speaking humbly, sought his instruction. Kang Cang said, “The one who transmitted this was mistaken. I can see and hear without relying on ears and eyes, but I cannot reverse the functions of ears and eyes.” The Duke of Lu said, “This is even more extraordinary! What is your Way? I earnestly wish to hear it.”

Kang Cang said, “My body aligns with the mind, the mind aligns with qi, qi aligns with spirit, and spirit aligns with nothingness. When there is the slightest presence, the faintest sound—whether distant beyond the eight wilds or near as one’s brows and lashes—whatever comes to disturb me, I must know it. Yet I do not know whether it is my seven apertures or four limbs that perceive, or my mind, belly, and six viscera that comprehend; it is simply self-knowing.”

The Duke of Lu was greatly pleased. Another day, he told this to Confucius, who smiled but did not answer.

The Grand Steward of Shang saw Confucius and said, “Is Qiu a sage?” Confucius replied, “How would Qiu dare claim sagacity? Yet Qiu is one who broadly studies and retains much.” The Grand Steward said, “Were the Three Kings sages?” Confucius said, “The Three Kings were skilled in employing wisdom and courage—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.” He asked, “Were the Five Emperors sages?” Confucius said, “The Five Emperors were skilled in employing benevolence and righteousness—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.” He asked, “Were the Three Sovereigns sages?” Confucius said, “The Three Sovereigns were skilled in employing what was timely—whether they were sages, Qiu does not know.”

The Grand Steward, greatly startled, said, “Then who is a sage?” Confucius, his expression shifting, paused for a moment and said, “Among the people of the West, there is one who may be a sage—without governing, there is no disorder; without speaking, there is natural trust; without transforming, there is natural action. Vast and boundless, the people cannot name him. Qiu suspects he may be a sage. But does Qiu truly know whether he is a sage or not?”

The Grand Steward fell silent, pondering to himself, “Kong Qiu deceives me!”

Zixia asked Confucius, “What is Yan Hui’s nature like?” The Master said, “Hui’s benevolence surpasses Qiu’s.” He asked, “What is Zigong’s nature like?” The Master said, “Ci’s eloquence surpasses Qiu’s.” He asked, “What is Zilu’s nature like?” The Master said, “You’s courage surpasses Qiu’s.” He asked, “What is Zizhang’s nature like?” The Master said, “Shi’s solemnity surpasses Qiu’s.”

Zixia rose from his mat and asked, “Then why do these four serve you, Master?” Confucius said, “Sit! I will tell you.”

“Hui possesses benevolence but cannot return to simplicity. Ci possesses eloquence but cannot be reticent. You possesses courage but cannot be timid. Shi possesses solemnity but cannot be accommodating. Even if I could exchange my qualities for all that these four possess, I would not consent—this is why they serve me without divided loyalty.”

After Liezi had taken Huqiu Zilin as his master and befriended Bohun Maoren, he dwelled in the southern outskirts. Those who followed him there came daily in droves, yet never grew weary. Nevertheless, Liezi remained somewhat reserved, engaging in debate with them morning after morning, leaving nothing unheard. Yet for twenty years, though he shared a wall with Nanguozi, he never paid him a formal visit. When they chanced upon each other on the road, their eyes seemed not to meet. The disciples and servants of his gate assumed Liezi and Nanguozi were rivals without doubt.

A man arrived from Chu and asked Liezi, “Master, in what way are you and Nanguozi rivals?” Ziji said, “Nanguozi’s appearance is full, yet his mind is empty; his ears do not hear, his eyes do not see, his mouth does not speak, his mind does not know, and his form does not stir. What could he possibly do? Nevertheless, come—let us go together and observe.”

Forty disciples accompanied him on the journey. Upon seeing Nanguozi, they found him indeed like a disembodied spirit, impossible to engage. Turning to observe Liezi, his form and spirit seemed unpaired, impossible to join. Suddenly, Nanguozi pointed to one of Liezi’s disciples in the rear rank and spoke with him, brimming with ease as if he alone were upright and everywhere dominant. Liezi’s followers were startled. Returning home, all wore expressions of doubt.

Liezi said: “Those who attain the meaning speak not; those who advance in knowledge also speak not. To use non-speech as speech is still speech; to use non-knowing as knowing is still knowing. Non-speech and not-speaking, non-knowing and not-knowing—these are also speech and knowing. They are also nothing unsaid, nothing unknown; they are also nothing said, nothing known. It is thus and no more. Why this groundless alarm?”

Liezi’s learning proceeded: after three years, his mind dared not ponder right and wrong, his mouth dared not speak of benefit and harm, and only then did Old Shang deign to glance at him. After five years, his mind again pondered right and wrong, his mouth again spoke of benefit and harm, and only then did Old Shang begin to relax his countenance and smile. After seven years, whatever his mind pondered held no right or wrong; whatever his mouth spoke held no benefit or harm. Only then did the Master draw him to sit beside him on the same mat. After nine years, whether his mind wandered in thought or his mouth uttered words, he no longer knew whether these were his own right and wrong, benefit and harm, or another’s—inner and outer had merged. Thereafter, his eyes were like ears, his ears like nose, his nose like mouth, with no difference among them. His mind congealed, his form dissolved, flesh and bone fused; he no longer sensed what his body leaned against, where his feet trod, what his mind pondered, or what his words concealed. It was thus and no more. Then no principle remained hidden.

Liezi was fond of wandering. Huqiuzi said: “Yu Kou is fond of wandering—what does he find so pleasing in it?” Liezi replied: “The joy of wandering lies in what one plays with being without fixed form. Others wander to observe what they see; I wander to observe what transforms. Wandering, wandering! None can distinguish its nature.”

Huqiuzi said: “Is Yu Kou’s wandering truly the same as others’, or is it truly different? What all see is but the constant transformation of things. Playing with the formlessness of things, they do not know they themselves are formless. They strive to wander outwardly, not knowing to strive inwardly. Those who wander outwardly seek completion in things; those who observe inwardly find sufficiency in themselves. Finding sufficiency in oneself is the perfection of wandering; seeking completion in things is its imperfection.”

Thereupon, Liezi never again ventured out, believing himself ignorant of wandering. Huqiuzi said: “Is this not the perfection of wandering? The perfect wanderer knows not where he goes; the perfect observer knows not what he gazes upon. All things wander, all things observe—this is what I call wandering, what I call observing. Thus I say: Is this not the perfection of wandering? Is this not the perfection of wandering?”

Dragon Shu said to Wen Zhi: “Your art is subtle. I have an affliction—can you cure it?”

Wen Zhi replied: “I await your command. But first, tell me the true nature of your malady.”

Dragon Shu said: “In my village, praise brings me no honor; in my state, slander brings me no shame. Gain does not make me rejoice, nor loss make me grieve. I regard life as death, wealth as poverty, others as swine, and myself as one among them. Dwelling in my home, I see it as an inn for travelers; gazing upon my village, I see it as a land of barbarians. All these manifold afflictions—neither rank nor reward can sway me, neither punishment nor threat can intimidate me, neither prosperity nor decline, neither benefit nor harm can alter me, neither sorrow nor joy can move me. Thus I am unfit to serve a lord, befriend kin, govern a wife and children, or command servants. What is this affliction? What method can cure it?”

Thereupon, Wen Zhi instructed Dragon Shu to stand with his back to the light. Wen Zhi then positioned himself behind Dragon Shu, facing the light to observe him. After a moment, he exclaimed: “Ah! I see your heart now—its square inch of space is empty, nearly that of a sage! Your heart has six apertures flowing freely, yet one remains obstructed. Now I understand: those who take sagely wisdom as an affliction may suffer precisely from this! This is not a malady my shallow art can cure.”

That which arises without cause and yet endures is the Dao.
To be born from life, thus even in death one does not perish—this is constancy.
To perish from life is misfortune.
That which arises from a cause and yet brings constant death is also the Dao.
To die from death, thus even before one’s end one perishes of oneself—this too is constancy.
To be born from death is fortune.

Therefore, to live without reliance is called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain one’s end is called constancy. To die through reliance is also called the Dao; to employ the Dao and attain death is also called constancy.

When Ji Liang died, Yang Zhu gazed at his gate and sang.
When Sui Wu died, Yang Zhu caressed his corpse and wept.
The birth of a bondsman, the death of a bondsman—common folk sing, common folk weep.

One whose eyes are about to dim first sees the autumn down;
One whose ears are about to deafen first hears the gnat’s flight;
One whose palate is about to dull first distinguishes the waters of the Zi and the Sheng;
One whose nose is about to block first detects charred rot;
One whose body is about to stiffen first hastens in restless motion;
One whose mind is about to wander first discerns right and wrong.
Thus, when a thing has not yet arrived, it does not return.

In Zheng, the marshlands of Fu Ze abounded in worthies, and Dongli teemed with talent. During the campaign at Pu Ze, there was a man named Bo Fengzi who, passing through Dongli, encountered Deng Xi. Observing Deng Xi glance at his followers and laugh, he said: “Why trouble yourself to dance for that one approaching?” His followers said: “We wish to know.” Deng Xi addressed Bo Fengzi: “Do you understand the meaning of nurturing and being nurtured? To receive nurture from others yet be unable to nurture oneself is the way of dogs and swine. To nurture things so that they serve one’s use is the power of man. If your followers eat their fill, clothe themselves, and rest, it is the achievement of governance. Yet gathering young and old together to become fodder for pens and kitchens—how is this different from the way of dogs and swine?” Bo Fengzi did not respond. A retainer of Bo Fengzi stepped forward out of turn and said: “Has the great officer never heard of the many ministers in Qi and Lu? There are those skilled in managing earth and wood, those skilled in managing metal and leather, those skilled in managing music, those skilled in managing records and accounts, those skilled in managing armies, and those skilled in managing ancestral temples—all talents are complete. Yet without a ministerial position, none can employ their abilities. And those who hold positions lack knowledge, while those who employ them lack ability. Knowledge and ability are thus made to serve. The one who governs is but one whom we employ—why do you boast?” Deng Xi had no reply, glanced at his followers, and withdrew.

Gongyi Bo was renowned among the feudal lords for his strength. Tangxi Gong spoke of him to King Xuan of Zhou, who prepared gifts and invited him. When Gongyi Bo arrived and the king observed his appearance, he seemed a feeble man. The king, perplexed, asked: “What is the measure of your strength?” Gongyi Bo replied: “Your servant’s strength can snap the leg of a spring katydid and pierce the wing of an autumn cicada.” The king’s expression changed: “My strength can rend the hide of a rhinoceros or young buffalo. To drag the tail of nine oxen still leaves me wishing for more. You snap the leg of a spring katydid and pierce the wing of an autumn cicada, yet your strength is renowned throughout the world—why?” Gongyi Bo sighed deeply, withdrew from his mat, and said: “Excellent is the king’s question! Your servant dares to speak truly. I had a teacher named Shang Qiuzi, whose strength was unmatched in the world, yet his kin knew nothing of it, for he had never employed his strength. I served him unto death. He told me: ‘One who wishes to see what others cannot see observes what others do not peer at; one who wishes to obtain what others cannot obtain practices what others do not pursue. Thus, one who studies sight first sees a cartload of firewood, and one who studies hearing first claims to hear the striking of a bell. For one whose inner self is at ease, nothing is difficult without.’ Since outwardly there is no difficulty, his name did not extend beyond his own household. Now my name is known among the feudal lords—this is because I conceal my teacher’s teachings and display my own abilities. Yet my name does not derive from bearing my strength but from being able to employ it. Is this not still better than bearing one’s strength in vain?”

Zhongshan Gongzi Mou was a worthy prince of Wei. He delighted in associating with worthy men and neglected state affairs, taking pleasure in the company of Gongsun Long of Zhao. The followers of Le Zhengzi Yu laughed at him. Gongzi Mou said: “Why do you laugh at my delight in Gongsun Long?” Ziyu replied: “Gongsun Long’s character is such that he acts without a teacher, studies without companions, is glib but misses the mark, rambles without substance, delights in the strange, and speaks recklessly. He seeks to confuse men’s minds and silence their mouths, practicing alongside Han Tan.” Gongzi Mou’s expression changed: “Why do you describe Gongsun Long’s faults thus? Pray tell me the truth.” Ziyu said: “I laugh at Long’s deception of Kong Chuan, when he said: ‘A skilled archer can make the rear arrowhead strike the front nock, each shot following the last, each arrow linked to the next. The front arrow reaches the target without break or fall, and the nock of the rear arrow still holds the string—seen from afar, it appears as one.’ Kong Chuan was astonished. Long said: ‘This is not yet the marvel.’”

A disciple of Feng Meng named Hong Chao, enraged at his wife, sought to frighten her. He drew the Wuhao bow and nocked a Qiwei arrow, shooting at her eye. The arrow flew straight toward her pupil, yet her eyelids did not blink; the arrow buried itself in the earth, and no dust rose. Is this the speech of a wise man?"

Gongzi Mou said: "The words of a wise man are inherently beyond the comprehension of fools. The rear arrowhead striking the front nock is like the latter hooking the former. The arrow piercing the pupil without the eyelids blinking—this is the full force of the arrow’s momentum. Why do you doubt it?"

Yuezheng Ziyu said: "How could Gongsun Long’s followers not embellish his flaws? Let me speak of his most egregious claims. Long deceived King Wei of Wei, saying: ‘There is intention without mind. There is pointing without arrival. There is a thing not fully present. There is a shadow that does not move. A single hair can draw a thousand jun. A white horse is not a horse. An orphaned calf has never had a mother.’ His violations of categories and inversions of logic are too numerous to recount."

Gongzi Mou said: "You mistake the profound for the egregious—your error lies with you. Without intention, minds are the same. Without pointing, all arrive. Things are fully present in the hall. That a shadow does not move is explained by change. A hair drawing a thousand jun is due to equal force. A white horse is not a horse because form and name are separate. An orphaned calf never having a mother does not negate the calf’s existence."

Yuezheng Ziyu said: "You take all of Gongsun Long’s pronouncements as well-ordered. If such words issued from another’s mouth, you would surely accept them as well." Gongzi Mou fell silent for a long while before taking his leave, saying: "Allow me another day to call upon you and continue our discussion."

When Yao ruled the world for fifty years, he did not know whether the world was well-governed or not, nor whether the countless people wished to support him or not. He turned and asked his attendants, but they did not know. He asked the outer court, but they did not know. He asked those in the wilds, but they did not know.

Yao then donned humble attire and wandered the broad thoroughfares, where he heard children singing a folk song: *"You set our multitudes aright—none fail to reach your height. Unknowing, unperceiving, we follow Heaven’s decree without contrivance."* Delighted, Yao asked, "Who taught you these words?" The children replied, "We heard them from a grandee." Yao questioned the grandee, who answered, "It is an ancient poem." Returning to his palace, Yao summoned Shun and thereupon abdicated the realm to him. Shun did not decline but accepted.

Guan Yinxi said: *"Abiding nowhere in oneself, one’s form mirrors all things. In motion, it flows like water; in stillness, it reflects like a mirror; in response, it echoes like sound. Thus the Dao resembles things, yet things depart from the Dao—the Dao does not depart from things. Those who excel in the Dao neither employ ears nor eyes, neither strength nor mind. To seek the Dao through sight, hearing, form, or intellect is misguided. Gazing ahead, it suddenly lies behind; used, it fills the six directions; discarded, none know its whereabouts. Neither the mindful can grasp it from afar, nor the mindless draw near. Only those who silently attain it and nurture it through their nature possess it. Knowing yet forgetting emotion, capable yet not acting—this is true knowledge, true ability. If one lacks knowledge, how can emotion arise? If one lacks ability, how can action occur? Hoarding treasures or amassing dust—though effortless, it is not the principle."*

*Question Five of Tang*

King Tang of Yin asked Xia Ge, "Did things exist in primordial antiquity?"

Xia Ge replied, "In the very beginning, there were no things—how could there be things now? Would later generations be right to say there are no things in our time?"

King Tang said, "Then do things have no before or after?"

Xia Ge said, "The end and beginning of things have no ultimate limit. What begins as an end may become a beginning, and what ends as a beginning may become an end—how can one know their order? Yet beyond things, before the center, lies what I do not know."

King Tang asked, "Then do the above and below, the eight directions, have limits?"

Xia Ge said, "I do not know."

Tang pressed further.

Xia Ge said, "If there is nothing, there is no limit; if there is something, there is an end—how could I know this? Yet beyond the limitless lies no further limitlessness, and within the endless lies no further endlessness. The limitless has no further limitlessness, and the endless has no further endlessness. From this I know there is no limit and no end, but I do not know whether there is a limit or an end."

Tang asked again, "What lies beyond the four seas?"

Xia Ge said, "The same as within the central states."

Tang said, "How do you confirm this?"

Xia Ge said, "When I traveled east to Ying, the people were the same. Asking about what lay east of Ying, it was still like Ying. When I traveled west to Bin, the people were the same. Asking about what lay west of Bin, it was still like Bin. From this I know that the four seas, the four wastes, and the four poles are no different. Thus the great and small contain one another without end. What contains the myriad things is like what contains heaven and earth. Containing the myriad things, it does not exhaust itself; containing heaven and earth, it has no limit. How could I know that beyond heaven and earth there are not greater heavens and earths? This too is what I do not know. Yet heaven and earth are also things. Things have insufficiencies, so in ancient times Nüwa smelted the five-colored stones to mend their gaps, and severed the legs of the great turtle to prop up the four poles. Later, Gonggong contended with Zhuanxu for the throne, and in his rage struck Mount Buzhou, breaking the pillar of heaven and severing the cords of earth. Thus heaven tilted to the northwest, and the sun, moon, and stars moved there; the earth was not full in the southeast, so the hundred rivers and floodwaters flowed there."

Yao further asked: "Do things have greatness and smallness? Do they have length and shortness? Do they have sameness and difference?"

Ge replied: "To the east of the Bohai Sea, beyond countless millions of *li*, there lies a great chasm, a bottomless valley indeed, called the Returning Gully. The waters of the eight directions and nine fields, the currents of the Milky Way—none fail to pour into it, yet it neither increases nor decreases.

Within it stand five mountains: the first is called Daiyu, the second Yuanqiao, the third Fanghu, the fourth Yingzhou, and the fifth Penglai. Each mountain rises and winds for thirty thousand *li*, with flat summits spanning nine thousand *li*. The distance between their peaks is seventy thousand *li*, yet they are neighbors. Their towers and terraces are all of gold and jade; their birds and beasts are pure white. Trees of pearl and jade grow in clusters, their blossoms and fruits all rich in flavor—eating them confers agelessness and immortality. The inhabitants are all of the lineage of immortals and sages; those who fly back and forth in a single day and night are beyond counting.

Yet the roots of the five mountains have no fixed anchorage, drifting ceaselessly with the tides, rising and falling without pause. The immortals and sages, distressed, appealed to the Emperor. Fearing the mountains would drift to the westernmost reaches and scatter the dwellings of the sages, the Emperor commanded Yujiang to dispatch fifteen giant turtles to bear them on their heads. They took turns in three shifts, alternating every sixty thousand years. Only then did the five mountains stand firm.

But in the land of Longbo, there lived giants whose strides spanned the distance to the five mountains in but a few steps. One of them cast a line and hooked six of the turtles at once, carrying them back to his country to burn their bones for divination. Thus Daiyu and Yuanqiao drifted to the northern pole and sank into the great sea, displacing countless millions of immortals and sages.

The Emperor, enraged, diminished the land of Longbo to narrow its bounds and shrank its people to shorten their stature. By the time of Fuxi and Shennong, the people of that land were still tens of *zhang* tall.

Forty thousand *li* east of the Central States lies the land of Qiaoyao, where people stand but a foot and a half tall. In the far northeast lives a people called the Contentious, nine feet in height. South of Jing lies the Dark Numinous, for whom five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn. In high antiquity grew the Great Camphor, for whom eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn. Upon rotting soil grow fungi and mushrooms that sprout at dawn and wither by dusk. In the months of spring and summer, midges and gnats arise with the rain and perish at the sun’s touch.

North of the northernmost reaches lies the Dark Sea, a celestial lake, where dwells a fish. It spans thousands of *li* in breadth, its length proportionate—its name is Kun. There is also a bird, named Peng, whose wings hang like clouds veiling the sky, its body in equal measure. Who in the world knows of such creatures? Great Yu beheld them in his travels; Boyi named them with his knowledge; Yijian recorded them in his annals.

Between the riverbanks grow tiny insects, called Jiaoming by the chroniclers, which gather joyfully upon the lashes of mosquitoes without disturbing them. They come and go, roost and depart, yet the mosquito remains unaware. Li Zhu and Zi Yu, though they strained their eyes by day, wiping their lids and raising their brows, could not perceive their forms. Yu and Shi Kuang, though they pricked their ears by night, bowing their heads to listen, could not catch their sounds. Only the Yellow Emperor and Rongchengzi, dwelling on Mount Kongtong, fasted together for three months, stilling their hearts and wasting their bodies. Gradually, with spiritual vision, they beheld them as clearly as the slopes of Mount Song; gradually, with attuned *qi*, they heard them as thunderously as the crash of thunder."

In the lands of Wu and Chu stands a great tree called the *you*, its verdant branches bearing fruit in winter. Its berries are crimson and tart; consuming its bark and sap cures the malady of *fen jue*. The Central States prize it, yet when carried north across the Huai River, it transforms into the *zhi*. The myna does not cross the Ji River, and the raccoon dog perishes when it passes the Wen—such is the nature of *qi* in the land.

Though forms and *qi* differ, their inherent natures remain the same, unchanging and unexchangeable. All life is whole unto itself, and every portion is sufficient. How then may I discern the great from the small? The long from the short? The same from the different?

The Twin Mountains of Taihang and Wangwu span seven hundred *li* and rise ten thousand *ren* high. They once lay south of Jizhou and north of Heyang. There lived an old man of the Northern Mountains, nearly ninety years of age, who dwelt facing the peaks. Vexed by the cold blockade to the north and the circuitous paths of his comings and goings, he gathered his household and proposed: "Let us join our strength to level this perilous terrain, carving a path south to Yuzhou and onward to the southern banks of the Han—would this not be possible?" The assembly voiced their assent.

His wife, however, raised a doubt: "With your strength, you cannot even reduce the mound of Kuifu—how then can you contend with Taihang and Wangwu? Moreover, where will you dispose of the earth and stones?" The others replied: "We shall cast them into the far reaches of the Bohai Sea, north of the Hidden Land." Thereupon, the old man led his sons and grandsons—three men bearing burdens—and began to strike the rocks and till the soil, hauling the debris in baskets to the edge of the Bohai. The widow of the Jingcheng family, left with a young orphan, had a son who had just lost his milk teeth; he leapt forth to aid them. Seasons turned, and only then did they make a single return journey.

The Wise Old Man of the River Bend laughed at the mountain’s single hair, asking, "What can you do against such earth and stone?" The Old Fool of the Northern Mountains sighed deeply and said: "Your heart is not steadfast—so unyielding that you cannot be enlightened. You are not even the equal of a widow or a weak child. Though I may die, I will leave behind a son; my son will bear a grandson, and my grandson will have a son..."

"Each son will have his own sons, and each son will have his grandsons; sons and grandsons without end, inexhaustible in number—yet the mountains will not grow taller. Why then should they not be leveled?"

The Wise Old Man of the River Bend had no reply.

The spirit who wielded the serpent heard of this and, fearing their unceasing labor, reported it to the Emperor. Moved by their sincerity, the Emperor commanded the two sons of Wan’e to bear the two mountains away—one placed to the northeast, the other to the south of Yong. From then on, south of Ji and north of the Han River, no ridges blocked the way.

Kuafu, overestimating his strength, sought to chase the sun’s shadow, pursuing it to the edge of Yu Valley. Parched with thirst, he rushed to drink from the Yellow River and the Wei. Finding the rivers insufficient, he set off northward to drink from the Great Marsh. Before reaching his destination, he died of thirst. He cast aside his staff, and where his flesh and fat soaked the earth, the Deng Forest sprang forth—spreading wide for thousands of *li*.

Yu the Great said: "Within the Six Directions and the Four Seas, all is illumined by sun and moon, ordered by the stars, marked by the four seasons, and governed by the Great Year. What the spirits bring forth takes strange forms—some die young, some live long, yet only the sage can fathom their Way."

Xia Ge replied: "Yet there are those born without reliance on spirits, shaped without dependence on yin and yang, luminous without sun or moon, dying untimely without violence, living long without cultivation, eating without the five grains, clothed without silk or floss, traveling without boats or chariots. Their Way is spontaneous, beyond even the sage’s comprehension."

When Yu the Great governed the waters and lands, he became lost and strayed into a foreign realm. North of the Northern Sea, beyond countless thousands of *li* from the Central States, lay a land called Zhongbei, its borders unfathomable. There, no wind or rain, frost or dew fell, nor did birds, beasts, insects, fish, grasses, or trees grow. The land stretched flat in all directions, encircled by towering ridges.

At its center stood a mountain named Huling, shaped like an overturned jar. At its summit yawned a circular opening called Zixue, from which gushed a spring named Shenfen. Its fragrance surpassed orchid and pepper, its taste excelled fine wine. The single source divided into four channels, flowing down the mountain to irrigate the entire land without exception.

The earth’s *qi* was harmonious, and no plagues or epidemics arose. The people were gentle and yielding, neither competing nor contending. Their hearts were soft, their bones weak; they knew no arrogance nor envy. Young and old dwelled together without rulers or subjects. Men and women mingled freely, without matchmakers or betrothals. They built homes along the water’s edge, yet tilled no fields nor sowed crops. The land’s *qi* was warm and mild, so they wove no cloth nor wore garments. They lived a hundred years without premature death or illness.

Their population flourished without count, ever joyful, never aging, grieving, or suffering. Their custom favored music, and they would drink until intoxicated, remaining so for ten days before sobering. Bathing in the Shenfen, their skin grew sleek and glossy, its fragrance lingering for ten days. When King Mu of Zhou journeyed north and passed through their land, he stayed three years before remembering to return. Once back in the Zhou court, he longed for that country, lost in melancholy. For months, he neither drank wine nor ate meat, nor summoned his consorts. Only later did he recover.

Guan Zhong urged Duke Huan of Qi to journey to Liaokou, intending to visit that land together. As they nearly set forth, Xi Peng remonstrated: "My lord, why forsake the vastness of Qi, its teeming people, its majestic mountains and rivers, its abundant resources, its flourishing rites and virtues, its splendid robes, its palace filled with beauties, its court brimming with loyal ministers? With a shout, a million soldiers answer; with a glance, the feudal lords obey. Why envy that land and abandon Qi’s altars of state to follow barbarians?" Duke Huan desisted, relaying Xi Peng’s words to Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong replied: "This is beyond Peng’s understanding. I feared that land’s mysteries could not be known. Why cling to Qi’s wealth? Why heed Peng’s words?"

The people of the southern lands shave their heads and go bare; those of the northern lands wear felt caps and fur robes; those of the central lands don crowns and lower garments. Across the nine regions, their livelihoods vary—some till the soil, some trade, some hunt, some fish—just as winter calls for furs and summer for linen, water for boats and land for carts. These are known by instinct and shaped by nature.

East of Yue lies the state of Zhemu, where the eldest son, upon birth, is sliced and eaten, deemed "fitting for younger brothers." When a grandfather dies, they carry the grandmother away and abandon her, saying, "A ghost’s wife cannot share the same mat." South of Chu lies the state of the Yan people, where upon a relative’s death, they carve the flesh and discard it, then bury the bones, thus becoming filial sons. West of Qin lies the state of Yiqu, where upon a relative’s death, they gather firewood and burn the body. As the smoke rises, they call it "ascending afar," and only then are they deemed filial sons. Such practices are upheld as governance above and custom below—yet they are scarcely cause for wonder.

Confucius journeyed eastward when he saw two children arguing. Asking the reason, one child said, "I believe the sun is nearer to us at dawn and farther at noon." The other held that the sun was farther at dawn and nearer at noon. The first child said, "At dawn, the sun appears as large as a carriage canopy, but by noon, it shrinks to the size of a plate or bowl—does this not prove that what is distant appears small and what is near appears large?" The other child countered, "At dawn, the sun is cool and refreshing, but by noon, it burns like scalding water—does this not prove that what is near is hot and what is far is cool?" Confucius could not settle the matter. The two children laughed, saying, "Who claims you are so wise?"

Uniformity is the supreme principle of the world, and this holds true even for tangible things. When a bowstring is evenly drawn and balanced in weight, it snaps cleanly; if uneven, it does not. When truly uniform, it never breaks. Yet some dismiss this truth, while others laugh at those who affirm it.

Zhan He used a single silkworm’s thread for his line, a needle’s barb for his hook, a stalk of fine bamboo for his rod, and a split grain for his bait. With these, he drew fish as large as a cart from abyssal depths and rushing currents—his line did not snap, his hook did not straighten, and his rod did not bend. The King of Chu, hearing of this, found it extraordinary and summoned him to ask the reason. Zhan He replied, "I once heard my late master speak of Pu Juzi, who shot birds with a supple bow and fine thread, riding the wind to strike a pair of cormorants amid the azure clouds. His mind was focused, his hand steady and even. I took his method and applied it to fishing, spending five years mastering its Way.

When I stand by the river with rod in hand, my mind is free of distractions, fixed only on the fish. Casting the line and sinking the hook, my hand moves with perfect balance—nothing can disturb it. To the fish, my hook and bait appear no more than sinking dust or gathered foam, and they swallow it without hesitation. Thus, the weak overcomes the strong, and the light achieves the heavy. If Your Majesty governs the state with such focus and balance, the realm could be held in the palm of your hand—what further effort would be needed?"

The King of Chu said, "Well said!"

Lu Gongyu and Zhao Qiying, both afflicted with illness, sought treatment from Bian Que together, and Bian Que healed them. Once both had recovered, he said to Gongyu and Qiying, "The ailments you suffered before were external invasions of the organs and viscera, which medicine and stone could indeed cure. Now, however, you share a congenital malady, grown with your bodies since birth. If I were to treat this for you, how would you feel?"

The two replied, "We would first like to hear the evidence."

Bian Que said to Gongyu, "Your will is strong but your qi is weak, so you excel in planning yet falter in decisiveness. Qiying, your will is weak but your qi is strong, so you lack foresight and err in obstinacy. If I were to exchange your hearts, both would achieve balance in virtue."

Bian Que then gave the two men poisoned wine, rendering them unconscious for three days. He split open their chests, extracted their hearts, swapped them, and placed them back. After administering a divine medicine, they awoke as if restored to life. The two men took their leave and returned home.

Thereupon, Gongyu went to Qiying’s house and claimed his wife and children, but they did not recognize him. Likewise, Qiying went to Gongyu’s house and took his wife and children, yet they too did not recognize him. The two households then brought their dispute to Bian Que for resolution. Bian Que explained the cause, and the dispute was settled.

Paoba played the zither, and birds danced while fish leapt. Hearing this, Zheng Shiwen abandoned his home to study under Master Xiang. For three years, his fingers pressed the strings and hooked the pegs, yet he could not produce a single melody.

Master Xiang said, "You may return home now."

Shiwen set down his zither and sighed, "It is not that my fingers cannot hook the strings, nor that I cannot form a melody. What I seek lies not in the strings, nor does my aspiration rest in sound. If my inner self is not at peace, and my outer self does not harmonize with the instrument, I dare not move my hands to pluck the strings. Allow me a little more time to observe."

Before long, he met Master Xiang again. Master Xiang asked, "How is your zither playing now?"

Shiwen replied, "I have grasped it. Allow me to demonstrate."

In spring, he struck the *shang* string to summon *Nanlü*, and suddenly a cool breeze arose, causing grasses and trees to bear fruit. In autumn, he struck the *jiao* string to rouse *Jiazhong*, and a warm wind gently swirled, making grasses and trees flourish. In summer, he struck the *yu* string to invoke *Huangzhong*, and frost and snow descended together, while rivers and ponds froze over. In winter, he struck the *zhi* string to excite *Ruibin*, and the sun’s rays blazed fiercely, melting solid ice in an instant. Finally, he commanded the *gong* string to harmonize all four, whereupon a propitious breeze soared, auspicious clouds floated, sweet dew fell, and fragrant springs gushed forth.

Master Xiang clapped his chest and leapt with joy, exclaiming, "How subtle is your playing! Even *Qingjiao* of Master Kuang or the pitch-pipes of Zou Yan could not surpass it. I shall carry my zither and flute to follow in your footsteps."

Xue Tan studied singing under Qin Qing, but before mastering his teacher’s art, he presumed to have learned it all and took his leave to return home. Qin Qing did not stop him. At the crossroads outside the city, he gave a farewell banquet, beating time and singing a mournful song. His voice shook the trees, and its resonance halted the passing clouds. Xue Tan then begged to return, vowing never again to speak of leaving. Qin Qing turned to his friends and said, "Long ago, Han E traveled east to Qi, but her provisions ran out. Passing through Yongmen, she sold her songs for food. After she left, her lingering notes coiled around the beams for three days without ceasing, and those nearby believed she had not yet departed. At an inn, the innkeeper insulted her. Han E then let forth a long, sorrowful wail, and the old and young of the village wept in grief, unable to eat for three days. They hastily pursued her and brought her back. When she returned and sang a long, joyful song, the villagers leapt and danced with delight, unable to restrain themselves, forgetting their earlier sorrow. They then richly rewarded her and sent her on her way. To this day, the people of Yongmen excel in singing and wailing, emulating Han E’s lingering voice."

Bo Ya was skilled at playing the zither, and Zhong Ziqi was skilled at listening. When Bo Ya played with his mind set on ascending a high mountain, Zhong Ziqi said, "How splendid! Vast as the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers!" Whatever Bo Ya conceived, Zhong Ziqi always grasped. Once, Bo Ya traveled to the northern slopes of Mount Tai when a sudden storm overtook him. He took shelter beneath a cliff, and in his sorrow, he took up his zither and played. First, he performed *The Melody of Endless Rain*, then composed *The Sound of Crumbling Mountains*. With each piece, Zhong Ziqi fully discerned its intent. Bo Ya then set down his zither and sighed, "How excellent! Your understanding of my aspirations is as if you had imagined them from my own heart. Where can my music hide from you?"

King Mu of Zhou embarked on a western hunting expedition, crossing the Kunlun Mountains without reaching Yan Mountain. On his return journey, before reaching the Central States, a craftsman named Yan Shi presented himself along the way. The king summoned him and asked, "What skills do you possess?" Yan Shi replied, "I shall do as Your Majesty commands. However, I have already created something I wish you to see first." The king said, "Come with it tomorrow, and we shall view it together."

The next day, Yan Shi was granted an audience. The king asked, "Who is this person accompanying you?" Yan Shi answered, "This is my creation, one capable of performing." The king gazed at it in astonishment—it walked with measured steps, bowed and rose, indistinguishable from a real person. The skilled craftsman pressed its chin, and it sang in perfect harmony; he lifted its hands, and it danced in rhythm. Its transformations were boundless, adapting to every intention. The king believed it to be a real person and, together with Lady Sheng and her attendants, observed its performance.

As the performance neared its end, the performer winked and beckoned to the king’s attendants. Enraged, the king was about to execute Yan Shi on the spot. Trembling with fear, Yan Shi immediately disassembled the performer before the king, revealing it to be an assemblage of leather, wood, glue, lacquer, and pigments—white, black, red, and blue. The king examined it closely: within were liver, gallbladder, heart, lungs, spleen, kidneys, intestines, and stomach; without were sinews, bones, joints, limbs, skin, hair, teeth, and hair—all artificial, yet nothing was lacking. When reassembled, it appeared as before.

The king tested it further: removing its heart rendered it speechless; removing its liver left it blind; removing its kidneys made it unable to walk. Only then did King Mu smile and sigh, "Can human craftsmanship truly rival the work of creation?" He ordered a secondary chariot to carry Yan Shi back with him.

As for Lu Ban’s cloud ladder and Mo Di’s flying kite, they had considered their skills unmatched. Yet when their disciples Dongmen Jia and Qin Guli heard of Yan Shi’s craftsmanship, they reported it to their masters. From that day forth, the two masters never again boasted of their arts and diligently adhered to their compasses and squares.

Gan Ying, an ancient master archer, could draw his bow and cause beasts to cower and birds to fall. His disciple, Fei Wei, studied archery under Gan Ying and surpassed his teacher. Another disciple, Ji Chang, sought to learn archery from Fei Wei. Fei Wei said, "First, you must learn not to blink; only then can we speak of archery." Ji Chang returned home, lay beneath his wife’s loom, and fixed his gaze upon the moving shuttle. After two years, even when a needle’s tip brushed his eyelashes, he did not blink. He informed Fei Wei, who said, "Not yet. You must first learn to see; then we may proceed. When you can see the small as large and the faint as distinct, come tell me."

Ji Chang suspended a louse from the window with a strand of hair and gazed at it from the south. Within ten days, it gradually appeared larger...

After three years, the louse appeared as large as a cartwheel. All other things he beheld seemed like hills and mountains. Thereupon, he took a bow of Yan horn and an arrow of northern reeds, loosed his shot, and pierced the louse’s heart—yet the thread remained unbroken. He reported this to Fei Wei.

Fei Wei leapt with joy, clapping his chest, and exclaimed, “You have mastered it!”

Once Ji Chang had fully acquired Fei Wei’s art, he reckoned that but one man in the world could rival him. He resolved to kill Fei Wei. They met in the wilds, and the two exchanged arrows. Midway, their arrowheads clashed tip-to-tip and fell to the ground without stirring a speck of dust. Fei Wei’s arrows were exhausted first. Ji Chang loosed one final arrow, but Fei Wei deflected it with the point of a thorn, not missing by a hair.

Thereupon, the two wept, cast aside their bows, and bowed to each other upon the road, pledging to become father and son. They cut their arms and swore an oath never to teach their art to others.

The teacher of Zaofu was named Taidou. When Zaofu first began learning charioteering, he observed the rites with utmost reverence, yet Taidou did not instruct him for three years. Only when Zaofu’s observance grew even more meticulous did Taidou say to him, “The ancient poem states: *‘The son of a skilled bowyer must first weave baskets; the son of a master smith must first sew furs.’* First, observe my movements. When your movements match mine, then you may hold the six reins and drive the six horses.”

Zaofu replied, “I shall follow your command.”

Taidou then set up wooden markers to form a path, just wide enough for a foot. He placed them at measured steps. Zaofu trod upon them and walked.

He ran back and forth along the path without stumbling or erring. After three days of study, Zaofu mastered all its subtleties.

Taidou sighed and said, “How keen you are—how swiftly you grasp it! All charioteering is like this. Before, your walking was guided by your feet, yet answered to your heart. Extend this to driving: harmony is achieved in the interplay of reins and bit, while urgency and ease are balanced in the accord of the lips; correctness is measured within the breast, and rhythm is held in the grip of the hands. When the center is inwardly attained, it outwardly aligns with the horse’s will—thus one can advance and retreat along the line, turn and curve within the compass, take the road to distant places, and still have qi and strength to spare. Truly, this is the mastery of the art.

What is gained from the bit responds to the reins; what is gained from the reins responds to external things; what is gained from external things responds to the heart. Then one need not rely on the eyes to see, nor use the whip to urge. The heart is at ease, the body upright, the six reins untangled, and the twenty-four hooves land without error. In turning, advancing, or retreating, all is in perfect measure. Then beyond the wheels’ track, no trace is left; beyond the horses’ hooves, no ground is untouched. One ceases to perceive the peril of mountains and valleys or the levelness of plains and lowlands—all appear as one. My art is exhausted here. Remember this well!”

Wei Hei Luan killed Qiu Bingzhang out of personal enmity. Qiu Bingzhang’s son, Lai Dan, plotted to avenge his father’s death. Dan’s qi was fierce, his form exposed, and he measured his meals by calculation, rushing with the wind. Though enraged, he could not wield weapons to exact revenge. Ashamed to borrow strength from others, he swore to slaughter Hei Luan with his own hands and sword.

Hei Luan’s ferocity surpassed all, resisting a hundred men with nine defiances. His sinews, bones, skin, and flesh were not of mortal kind. He stretched his neck to meet the blade, bared his chest to arrows, yet though spearheads bent and edges dulled, his body bore no mark. Confident in his strength, he regarded Lai Dan as but a fledgling chick.

Lai Dan’s friend, Shen Ta, said: “Your hatred for Hei Luan is profound, and his underestimation of you is excessive. What plan will you devise?”

Lai Dan wept, saying: “I beg you to devise one for me.”

Shen Ta replied: “I have heard that your ancestor, Kong Zhou of Wei, obtained the treasured swords of the Yin Emperor. When a mere boy wore one, he repelled an entire army. Why not seek his aid?”

Dan then went to Wei and met Kong Zhou. Assuming the role of servant and charioteer, he first offered his wife and children as collateral before stating his request.

Kong Zhou said: “I possess three swords, any of which you may choose. None can slay a man, but first, let me describe their forms. The first is called *Han Guang* (Containing Light): it cannot be seen when looked upon, and its motion leaves no trace.”

The point it strikes vanishes without trace, passing through things as though they were unaware. The second is called *Cheng Ying* (Bearing Shadow): at the cusp of dawn’s first dim light, or the threshold of dusk’s fading brightness, if one faces north and observes it, faintly, as if something lingers—yet none can discern its form. Where it touches, a soft whisper sounds, passing through things without harming them. The third is called *Xiao Lian* (Night-forged): by day, one sees its shadow but not its light; by night, one sees its light but not its shape. When it strikes, it severs with a sharp *hua* sound, cleaving and sealing instantly—swift yet leaving no bloodied blade. These three treasures have been passed down for thirteen generations, yet never put to use. Kept sheathed and sealed, they have never been unveiled.”

Lai Dan said: “Even so, I request the lowest of them.” Kong Zhou then returned his wife and children, and together they fasted for seven days. At the hour when yin and yang intermingle, Kong Zhou knelt and presented the lowest sword. Lai Dan bowed twice, received it, and departed.

Lai Dan then took the sword and followed Hei Luan. At the time, Hei Luan was drunk, sprawled beneath the window. Lai Dan struck him three times from neck to waist—Hei Luan remained unaware. Believing Hei Luan dead, Lai Dan hastened to retreat. At the gate, he encountered Hei Luan’s son and struck him three times, as though striking emptiness. Hei Luan’s son laughed and said: “Why so foolish as to wave at me thrice?” Lai Dan, realizing the sword could not kill, sighed and returned home.

When Hei Luan awoke, he berated his wife: “You let me drink and expose me, making my throat sore and my waist stiff.” His son said: “Earlier, Lai Dan came. He met me at the gate and waved at me three times—it made my body ache and my limbs stiff. He must have cursed me!”

King Mu of Zhou launched a grand campaign against the Western Rong. The Western Rong presented him with a *kunwu* sword and fire-washed cloth. The sword measured a foot and a span, its blade forged of crimson steel, and when used, it sliced jade as easily as cutting mud. The fire-washed cloth, when laundered, must be cast into fire; the cloth turns the color of flame, while the grime takes on the cloth’s hue. Drawn from the fire and shaken, it gleams as dazzlingly white as snow. The royal heir deemed such things nonexistent, calling their chroniclers liars.

Xiao Shu said: “Your Highness is indeed resolute in self-trust, resolute in dismissing reason!”

**Force and Fate (Chapter Six)**
Force said to Fate: “How does your merit compare to mine?”
Fate replied: “What merit have you rendered to things, that they would rank you beside me?”
Force said: “Longevity or early death, success or failure, nobility or lowliness, wealth or poverty—all lie within my power.”
Fate said: “Peng Zu’s wisdom did not surpass that of Yao or Shun, yet he lived eight hundred years; Yan Yuan’s talent did not exceed that of the common man, yet he died at thirty-two. Confucius’s virtue did not fall below that of the feudal lords, yet he was besieged in Chen and Cai; King Zhou of Yin’s conduct did not surpass that of the Three Benevolent Ones, yet he occupied the throne. Ji Zha held no rank in Wu, while Tian Heng usurped the state of Qi. Boyi and Shuqi starved on Mount Shouyang, while the Ji clan grew richer than Zhan Qin. If these are within your power, why grant long life to one and early death to another, thwart the worthy and favor the perverse, debase the virtuous and ennoble the foolish, impoverish the good and enrich the wicked?”

Force said: “If it is as you say, then I indeed have no merit over things. Yet if things are thus, are they not subject to your control?”
Fate replied: “Since it is called Fate, how could there be one who controls it? I merely push forward the straight and entrust the crooked. Whether long-lived or short-lived, successful or failed, noble or base, rich or poor—do I have any knowledge of it? Do I have any knowledge of it?”

Beigongzi said to Ximenzi: “You and I are of the same generation, yet you are esteemed while I am not; we belong to the same clan, yet you are respected while I am not; we share the same appearance, yet you are loved while I am not; we speak the same words, yet yours are valued while mine are not; we act in the same way, yet yours are deemed sincere while mine are not; we serve in office, yet you are honored while I am not; we till the soil, yet you grow rich while I do not; we trade in goods, yet you profit while I do not. I wear coarse hemp, eat coarse grain, dwell in a thatched hut, and travel on foot. You wear embroidered silks, feast on fine meats, live in a mansion with towering beams, and ride in a carriage drawn by four horses. At home, you dismiss me with a carefree air; at court, you display disdain toward me. We no longer seek each other’s favor, nor do we wander together—this has been so for years. Do you truly believe your virtue surpasses mine?”

Ximenzi replied: “I have no way of knowing the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of the difference between thick and thin? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is indeed thick.”

Beigongzi had no reply. He departed in dismay and on his way home encountered Master Dongguo. The master asked: “Where have you been that you return with such a halting step and a look of deep shame?”

Beigongzi recounted what had happened. Master Dongguo said: “I shall relieve you of your shame. Let us go together to Ximen’s house and question him. Say to him: ‘Why do you so deeply humiliate Beigongzi? Speak plainly.’”

Ximenzi replied: “Beigongzi says we share the same generation, clan, age, appearance, words, and deeds, yet our status and wealth differ. I told him: ‘I have no way of knowing the truth of this. You undertake affairs and fail; I undertake them and succeed. Is this not proof of the difference between thick and thin? Yet you claim we are the same—your face is indeed thick.’”

Master Dongguo said: “Your notion of thick and thin refers only to differences in talent and virtue. My notion of thick and thin differs. Beigongzi is thick in virtue but thin in fate; you are thick in fate but thin in virtue. Your success is not due to wisdom, nor is his failure due to folly. Both are Heaven’s doing, not man’s. Yet you take pride in fate’s favor, while Beigongzi feels shame for his virtue—neither of you understands the principle that is so of itself.”

Ximenzi said: “Enough, Master! I dare not speak further.”

After Beigongzi returned home, he donned his coarse hemp robe and found the warmth of fox and badger fur; he ate his coarse beans and tasted the savor of fine rice and millet; he sheltered in his thatched hut and felt the shade of a grand hall; he rode in his humble cart and found the adornment of an ornate carriage. For the rest of his life, he lived in ease, unaware of glory and honor—whether they lay with others or with himself.

Master Dongguo, hearing of this, said: “Beigongzi has slept for a long time. A single word awakened him—how easily sorrow is dispelled!”

Guan Yiwu and Bao Shuya were close friends who lived together in Qi. Guan Yiwu served Prince Jiu, while Bao Shuya served Prince Xiaobai. The Qi ruling house had many favored sons, and the lines of succession were unclear. The people feared chaos. Guan Zhong and Shao Hu escorted Prince Jiu in flight to Lu, while Bao Shuya escorted Prince Xiaobai to Ju. Later, when Duke Wuzhi rebelled and Qi was left without a ruler, the two princes raced to return. Guan Yiwu and Xiaobai clashed on the road to Ju, and Guan Zhong’s arrow struck Xiaobai’s belt hook. Once Xiaobai ascended the throne, he forced Lu to execute Prince Jiu. Shao Hu died for his lord, while Guan Yiwu was imprisoned.

Bao Shuya said to Duke Huan: “Guan Yiwu is capable—he could govern the state.”

The duke replied: “He is my enemy. I wish to kill him.”

Bao Shuya said: “I have heard that a worthy ruler harbors no private grudges. Moreover, one who serves his lord faithfully will surely serve his ruler well. If you seek hegemony, you cannot do without Guan Yiwu. You must pardon him!”

Thereupon, the duke summoned Guan Zhong. When Lu returned him to Qi, Bao Shuya met him at the outskirts and freed him from his bonds. Duke Huan treated him with honor, placing him above the ministers Gao and Guo. Bao Shuya yielded to him and entrusted him with state affairs. He was styled “Zhongfu,” and Duke Huan became a hegemon.

Guan Zhong once sighed: “When I was young and poor, I once traded with Bao Shu, taking more than my share. He did not think me greedy but knew I was poor. I once devised a plan for Bao Shu that led to great hardship. He did not think me foolish but knew the times were unpropitious. I served three times and was thrice dismissed by my lord. Bao Shu did not think me cowardly but knew I had an aged mother. When Prince Jiu was defeated, Shao Hu died for him, while I was imprisoned and humiliated. Bao Shu did not think me shameless but knew I did not scorn small matters—my shame lay in my name not being known throughout the world. My parents gave me life, but Bao Shu truly knew me!”

This is why the world praises Guan and Bao for their fine friendship, and Xiaobai for his ability to employ the capable. Yet in truth, there was no fine friendship, nor was there any ability to employ the capable. There was no fine friendship and no ability to employ the capable—it was not that there was some other fine friendship or some other ability to employ the capable. Shao Hu did not choose to die; he had no choice but to die. Bao Shuya did not choose to recommend the worthy; he had no choice but to do so. Xiaobai did not choose to employ his enemy; he had no choice but to do so.

When Guan Yiwu fell ill, Xiaobai asked him: “Zhongfu’s illness is grave. If it should become critical, to whom should I entrust the state?”

Guan Yiwu said: “Whom do you have in mind?”

The duke said: “Bao Shuya will do.”

Guan Yiwu replied: “He will not. He is a man of integrity and purity, a true gentleman. Toward those who do not measure up to him, he will not associate. Once he hears of a man’s faults, he never forgets them.”

If you appoint him to govern the state, above he will entangle his lord, below he will oppose the people. His offense against his lord will not be long in coming.”

Xiaobai said, “Then who will do?”

Guan Yiwu replied, “If you must have someone, then Xi Peng will do. In his conduct, he forgets those above him and does not betray those below. He feels shame for falling short of the Yellow Emperor and pities those who fall short of himself. To share virtue with others is called sageliness; to share wealth with others is called worthiness. To rule others with worthiness never wins their allegiance; to humble oneself with worthiness never fails to win it. What he does not hear in the state, he does not see in his own household. If you must have someone, then Xi Peng will do.”

Thus, Guan Yiwu did not slight Bao Shuya out of choice—he had no choice but to slight him. He did not favor Xi Peng out of choice—he had no choice but to favor him. One may favor another at the outset only to slight him in the end; one may slight another in the end only to favor him at the outset. The coming and going of favor and slight are not of my doing.

Deng Xi wielded arguments of dual possibility, crafting endless words. When Zichan held office, Deng composed the *Bamboo Penal Code*. The state of Zheng adopted it, repeatedly challenging Zichan’s governance. Zichan yielded to him. Zichan seized and executed him, then soon after put him to death. Thus, Zichan did not choose to employ the *Bamboo Penal Code*—he had no choice but to do so. Deng Xi did not choose to yield to Zichan—he had no choice but to yield. Zichan did not choose to execute Deng Xi—he had no choice but to do so.

To live when one can live is Heaven’s blessing; to die when one can die is Heaven’s blessing. To fail to live when one can live is Heaven’s punishment; to fail to die when one can die is Heaven’s punishment. Some can live and can die, and so live or die; some cannot live and cannot die, yet live or die nonetheless. Yet life and death, life and death—neither things nor self, all is fate, beyond the reach of wisdom. Thus it is said: “Abysmally without bounds, the Dao of Heaven meets of itself; vacuously without division, the Dao of Heaven moves of itself. Heaven and Earth cannot transgress it, sages and wisdom cannot interfere, ghosts and spirits cannot deceive. That which is natural: silently it completes, levels, pacifies, guides, and welcomes.”

Yang Zhu’s friend Ji Liang fell ill, and after seven days his condition worsened. His sons circled him weeping and summoned physicians. Ji Liang said to Yang Zhu, “My sons are so foolish—why do you not sing for me to enlighten them?”

Yang Zhu sang:
*“Does Heaven not know? Can men alone awaken?
Not calamity from Heaven, not calamity from man.
I or you—who knows?
Physician or shaman—do they know?”*

His sons did not understand and ultimately consulted three physicians. The first was named Jiao, the second Yu, and the third Lu. They diagnosed his illness.

Physician Jiao said to Ji Liang, “Your cold and warmth are imbalanced, your deficiency and excess disordered. Your illness stems from hunger and satiety, from lust and desire. Your essence and thoughts are scattered—neither Heaven nor ghosts are to blame. Though grave, it can be treated.”

Ji Liang said, “A common physician—quickly send him away!”

Physician Yu said, “From birth, your prenatal qi was insufficient, your nursing milk excessive. Your illness did not arise in a day or a night; its causes accumulated gradually. It cannot be cured.”

Ji Liang said, “A good physician—let him stay and eat!”

Physician Lu said, “Your illness comes neither from Heaven, nor from man, nor from ghosts. You received life and form, and there is one who governs them, one who knows them. What can medicine and stone do for you?”

Ji Liang said, “A divine physician—richly reward and send him away!”

Soon after, Ji Liang’s illness resolved itself.

Life is not preserved by what is prized, nor is it cherished by what is loved. Life is not cut short by what is despised, nor is the self diminished by what is belittled. Thus, what is prized may not preserve life, what is despised may not cause death; what is loved may not cherish, what is belittled may not diminish. This seems contradictory, yet it is not—life and death, cherishing and diminishing, arise of themselves. Some are preserved by what is prized, some die from what is despised; some are cherished by what is loved, some diminished by what is belittled. This seems compliant, yet it is not—life and death, cherishing and diminishing, arise of themselves.

Yu Xiong said to King Wen, “What is long is not lengthened by itself, what is short is not shortened by itself. What is lost in calculation—what does it matter?”

Laozi said to Guan Yin, “Who knows the reason for what Heaven detests?” To anticipate Heaven’s intent, to weigh profit and harm—better to cease.

Yang Bu said, “Consider a man here: in years, he and his brother are the same; in speech, they are the same; in talent, they are the same; in appearance, they are the same. Yet in lifespan, they are father and son; in rank, they are father and son; in reputation, they are father and son; in love and hate, they are father and son. I am perplexed.”

Yangzi said, “The ancients had a saying I once learned, which I will tell you: ‘Not knowing why it is so, yet it is so—this is fate.’ Now, in darkness and confusion, in chaos and uncertainty, following what is done and what is not done—days depart, days arrive, who knows the reason? All is fate. Those who trust in fate do not distinguish long or short life; those who trust in principle do not distinguish right or wrong; those who trust in the heart do not distinguish compliance or defiance; those who trust in nature do not distinguish safety or danger. Thus, to say one trusts nothing and trusts everything—this is true, this is sincere. What to leave, what to approach? What to mourn, what to rejoice in? What to do, what not to do?”

The *Book of the Yellow Emperor* says: *“The utmost person abides as if dead, moves as if a machine.”* They do not know why they abide, nor why they do not; they do not know why they move, nor why they do not.

They do not alter their true nature or appearance by the gaze of the multitude, nor do they claim that their true nature or appearance remains unchanged when unseen by the multitude. Alone they come, alone they go, alone they enter, alone they depart—who can grasp them?

Mo Xi, Shan Zhi, Tan Xuan, and Bie Fu traveled together in the world, each following their own will; though they spent their years together, they never knew one another’s true feelings, each believing their own wisdom to be profound. Qiao Ning, Yu Zhi, Nan Zhuo, and Pian Pi traveled together in the world, each following their own will; though they spent their years together, they never spoke of their arts, each believing their own skill to be subtle. Miu Ya, Qing Lu, Jian Ji, and Ling Sui traveled together in the world, each following their own will; though they spent their years together, they never enlightened one another, each believing their own talent to be sufficient. Mian Tian, Zhui Wei, Yong Gan, and Qie Yi traveled together in the world, each following their own will; though they spent their years together, they never reproached one another, each believing their own conduct to be without fault. Duo Ou, Zi Zhuan, Cheng Quan, and Zhi Li traveled together in the world, each following their own will; though they spent their years together, they never glanced at one another, each believing their own timing to be fitting. Such are the many forms of human nature. Though their appearances differ, all return to the Dao—this is where fate leads them.

What seems to succeed is but a fleeting success, not true success at all. What seems to fail is but a fleeting failure, not true failure at all. Thus, confusion arises from these fleeting moments, for their boundaries are obscure. If one remains unobscured amid such fleeting moments, they will not be startled by external misfortune nor delighted by inner fortune. Moving or halting as they go, wisdom cannot comprehend it. Those who trust in fate harbor no duality between self and other. Those who harbor duality between self and other would do better to cover their eyes and plug their ears, turning their backs to cliffs and facing the moat—even then, they would not fall.

Thus it is said: life and death come from fate, poverty and wealth from the times. Those who resent early death do not understand fate; those who resent poverty do not understand the times. Facing death without fear, enduring hardship without sorrow—this is knowing fate and accepting the times.

Consider the man of great wisdom: he measures gain and loss, weighs emptiness and fullness, gauges human nature, and whether he succeeds or fails, he hits the mark. The man of little wisdom does not measure gain and loss, does not weigh emptiness and fullness, does not gauge human nature, yet whether he succeeds or fails, he also hits the mark. What difference is there between measuring and not measuring, weighing and not weighing, gauging and not gauging? Only when there is nothing measured and nothing unmeasured is one whole and without loss. It is not that one knows wholeness or mocks loss—one is simply whole, simply lost, simply perished of oneself.

Duke Jing of Qi wandered on Ox Mountain, gazing northward over his capital, and wept, saying: “How beautiful is this land! So lush and verdant—how could I bear to leave it and die? If the ancients had never died, where would I go from here?” Shi Kong and Liang Qiu Ju both followed him in weeping, saying: “We rely on our lord’s grace—coarse grain and tough meat are enough to eat, broken-down horses and rickety carts enough to ride. Even so, we do not wish to die—how much less our lord!” Only Yanzi laughed beside them. The duke wiped his tears and turned to Yanzi, saying: “Today’s outing has made me sorrowful. Ju followed me in weeping, yet you alone laugh—why?” Yanzi replied: “If worthy men always guarded it, then the Great Duke and Duke Huan would still be guarding it. If brave men always guarded it, then Duke Zhuang and Duke Ling would still be guarding it. Had those lords guarded it, would you now be standing here in straw cloak and hat, tilling the fields between furrows, worrying only about your tasks, awaiting death at any moment? How could you have attained this position? Because rulers have succeeded one another, coming and going, and now it is your turn—yet you alone weep for it. This is not benevolence. Seeing an unbenevolent ruler and flattering ministers, I could not help but laugh.” Duke Jing was ashamed, raised his cup to punish himself, and penalized his two ministers with two cups each.

Among the people of Wei was one Dongmen Wu, whose son died yet he showed no grief. His steward said: “No one in the world loved their son more than you. Now that your son has died, why do you not grieve?” Dongmen Wu replied: “I once had no son, and in that time of having no son, I did not grieve. Now that my son has died, it is the same as when I had no son—why should I grieve?”

Farmers rush to the season, merchants chase profit, artisans pursue skill, the benevolent follow power—forces compel them. Yet farmers face drought and flood, merchants meet gain and loss, artisans encounter success and failure, officials meet favor and disfavor—fate compels them.

**Section Seven of Yang Zhu**

Yang Zhu traveled in Lu and lodged with the Zhen family. Mengshi asked: “Man is but man—why seek fame?” Yang Zhu said: “To become rich.” “Once rich, why not stop?” “To become noble.” “Once noble, why not stop?” “For death.” “Once dead, what then?” “For one’s descendants.” “How does fame benefit one’s descendants?” “Fame brings suffering to the body and scorches the heart. Those who ride fame bring blessings to their clans and profit to their villages—how much more their descendants?” “Yet those who seek fame must be frugal, and frugality leads to poverty; those who seek fame must be yielding, and yielding leads to lowliness.” Yang Zhu said: “When Guan Zhong served as minister of Qi, if the lord was dissolute, he was dissolute; if the lord was extravagant, he was extravagant. Their wills aligned, their words followed, the Dao was practiced, and the state became hegemonic. After his death, the Guan family alone remained. When the Tian family served as ministers of Qi, if the lord was full, they diminished themselves; if the lord took, they gave. The people all turned to them, and thus they came to possess the state of Qi.”

"The descendants have enjoyed it to this day, unbroken."

"If true fame leads to poverty, false fame leads to wealth."

Yang Zhu said: "Truth has no fame, fame has no truth; fame is but falsity. In ancient times, Yao and Shun feigned to cede the world to Xu You and Shan Juan, yet did not lose the world, and their blessings endured for a hundred years. Boyi and Shuqi truly ceded the rulership of Guzhu, yet in the end lost their state and starved to death on Mount Shouyang. The distinction between truth and falsity is thus made plain."

Yang Zhu said: "A hundred years is the greatest span of life, yet among a thousand, not one attains it. Even if one does, half is spent in infancy and dotage. Of the remaining half, sleep by night and distraction by day claim yet another half. Pain, sickness, sorrow, loss, anxiety, and fear take nearly half of what remains. Measured in ten or so years, the time one is carefree and content, without a moment’s concern, is but a fleeting instant. Then for what does man live? For what does he delight? For rich flavors and sensuous pleasures. Yet rich flavors cannot always sate, nor can sensuous pleasures always be enjoyed. Thus one is further bound by rewards and punishments, advanced or checked by fame and law. Restlessly one competes for an ephemeral reputation in life, scheming for posthumous glory. Cautiously one guards what the ears hear and the eyes see, sparing the body and mind from blame. In vain one forfeits the supreme joy of the present, unable to indulge even for a moment. How is this different from a prisoner in heavy shackles?

The people of highest antiquity knew that life is but a brief sojourn, and death a brief departure. Thus they followed their hearts and acted, never opposing what nature loved. The joys of the present they did not forsake, and so were not swayed by fame. They roamed in accord with their nature, never resisting what the myriad things loved. Posthumous fame they did not seek, and so were not touched by punishment. Fame and reputation, longevity and brevity—they did not weigh these."

Yang Zhu said: "What sets the myriad things apart is life; what unites them is death. In life there are the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are their differences. In death there is stench, decay, and dissolution—this is what they share. Yet the worthy and the foolish, the noble and the base—these are not within one’s power. Stench, decay, and dissolution—these too are not within one’s power. Thus life is not what one lives, death is not what one dies, worthiness is not what one makes worthy, foolishness is not what one makes foolish, nobility is not what one makes noble, baseness is not what one makes base. Yet the myriad things are equal in life, equal in death, equal in worthiness, equal in foolishness, equal in nobility, equal in baseness. Whether one dies at ten or a hundred, whether one is humane and sagely or cruel and foolish—all die. In life, one may be Yao or Shun; in death, one is but rotting bones. In life, one may be Jie or Zhou; in death, one is but rotting bones. Rotting bones are all the same—who knows the difference? Pursue what life offers—why hasten to consider what comes after death?"

Yang Zhu said: "Boyi was not without desires—his insistence on purity led him to starve to death in exile. Zhan Ji was not without passions—his insistence on chastity led him to leave his clan diminished. Such are the errors of purity and chastity."

Yang Zhu said: "Yuan Xian lived in poverty in Lu, while Zigong amassed wealth in Wei. Yuan Xian’s poverty harmed his life, and Zigong’s wealth burdened his person."

"Then neither poverty nor wealth is acceptable—where, then, lies what is acceptable?"

He replied: "What is acceptable lies in delighting in life, lies in freeing the body. Thus one who delights in life does not live in poverty, and one who frees the body does not amass wealth."

Yang Zhu said: "An ancient saying goes: *'In life, they cherish one another; in death, they abandon one another.'* This saying is perfect. The Way of cherishing is not merely about affection—diligence can bring ease, hunger can bring satiety, cold can bring warmth, and poverty can bring success. The Way of abandonment is not without sorrow—yet they do not hold pearls or jade, do not wear embroidered silks, do not display sacrificial animals, do not arrange funerary objects."

Yan Pingzhong asked Guan Yiwu about nurturing life. Guan Yiwu replied: "Let it flow freely—do not block or obstruct it."

Yan Pingzhong said: "What does this entail in practice?"

Yiwu said: "Let the ears hear what they desire to hear, the eyes see what they desire to see, the nose inhale what it desires to smell, the mouth speak what it desires to say, the body rest where it desires to rest, and the mind follow where it desires to wander. When the ears desire to hear sounds yet cannot, this is called obstructing hearing; when the eyes desire to see beauty yet cannot, this is called obstructing sight; when the nose desires the scent of pepper or orchid yet cannot, this is called obstructing smell; when the mouth desires to speak of right and wrong yet cannot, this is called obstructing wisdom; when the body desires comfort yet cannot attain it, this is called obstructing ease; when the mind desires freedom yet cannot act, this is called obstructing release. All these obstructions are tyrants that ravage life. Cast off these ravaging tyrants, and live in joyful ease awaiting death—whether a day, a month, a year, or ten years—this is what I call nurturing life. Cling to these ravaging tyrants, binding oneself without release, and live in sorrowful constraint to a long life—whether a hundred years, a thousand years, or ten thousand years—this is not what I call nurturing life."

Guan Yiwu said: "I have told you about nurturing life—how, then, should one send off the dead?"

Yan Pingzhong replied: "Sending off the dead is a simple matter—what more is there to say?"

Yiwu said: "I still wish to hear it."

Pingzhong said: "Once dead, how does it concern me? Whether one dreams of them, sinks them in water, buries them in earth, exposes them to the elements, wraps them in firewood and casts them into a ravine, or robes them in embroidered finery and seals them in a stone vault—it is all a matter of what one encounters."

Guan Yiwu turned to Bao Shu Huangzi and said: "The Way of life and death—we two have now advanced it."

When Zichan served as minister of Zheng and held sole authority over the state’s governance for three years, the good were transformed by his influence, the wicked feared his prohibitions, and the state of Zheng was well-ordered.

The feudal lords stood in awe of him. He had an elder brother named Gongsun Chao and a younger brother named Gongsun Mu. Chao was fond of wine, and Mu was fond of women.

In Chao’s chambers, a thousand *zhong* of wine were amassed, yeast piled high as a mound. From a hundred paces outside the gate, the stench of fermented dregs assailed the nose. When he was lost in drink, he knew nothing of the world’s strife and peril, the regrets and resentments of human affairs, the presence or absence of his household, the closeness or distance of his nine clans, or the sorrows and joys of life and death. Even if water and fire, blades and weapons raged before him, he remained oblivious.

Mu’s rear courtyard housed dozens of chambers, each filled with young, graceful maidens. When he was consumed by lust, he shunned close kin, severed friendships, and fled to the inner quarters, sating himself day and night. He emerged but once every three months, yet still felt unsatisfied. If a village maiden of surpassing beauty appeared, he would bribe and summon her, employ matchmakers to entice her, and rest only when he had obtained her.

Zichan grieved over this day and night. Secretly, he sought Deng Xi and consulted him, saying: “I have heard that governing the self extends to the family, and governing the family extends to the state—this speaks of proceeding from the near to the far. I have brought order to the state, yet my own household is in chaos! Is my Way inverted? What method can save these two? Pray, instruct me!”

Deng Xi replied: “I have long marveled at this! Yet I dared not speak first. Why not attend to their governance in due time, admonishing them with the weight of life and destiny, and guiding them with the dignity of ritual and righteousness?”

Zichan heeded Deng Xi’s words. Seizing an opportunity, he visited his brothers and addressed them: “What elevates man above beasts is wisdom, and what wisdom upholds is ritual and righteousness. When ritual and righteousness are perfected, rank and position follow. If you act on impulse, indulging in desires, your very lives will be imperiled. Heed my words, and by evening, you will repent and enjoy emolument.”

Chao and Mu replied: “We have long known this and long deliberated upon it. Do we need your words to recognize it? Life is hard to attain, yet death comes easily. With a life so difficult to obtain, awaiting a death so easily met—how can one not reflect deeply? Yet to exalt ritual and righteousness to impress others, to feign nature and disposition for the sake of reputation—we deem this worse than death. We wish to exhaust life’s pleasures, to plumb the joys of our years, fearing only that our bellies will burst before we glut our thirst, that our strength will fail before we sate our lust. We have no leisure to fret over the shame of our names or the peril to our lives. Moreover, you boast of your ability to govern the state, seeking to sway our hearts with fine words, to delight our minds with honor and emolument—is this not base and pitiable? We would rather part ways with you.

Those who excel at governing the external may not bring order to things, yet their own bodies suffer. Those who excel at governing the internal may not bring chaos to things, yet their natures remain at ease. Your governance of the external, with its hardships, may be temporarily enforced in one state, but it does not accord with human hearts. Our governance of the internal can be extended to all under heaven, and the Way of ruler and minister will cease. We have long wished to expound this art to you, yet you now seek to instruct us with that other art!”

Zichan was left speechless, unable to respond. Later, he recounted this to Deng Xi. Deng Xi said: “You have dwelled with true men and yet do not know them—who would call you wise? The order of Zheng is but a coincidence, not your achievement.”

Wei Duanmu Shu was a descendant of Zigong. Relying on the wealth of his ancestors, his family amassed ten thousand gold pieces. He did not attend to worldly affairs but gave free rein to his desires. Whatever the people longed to do, whatever delights the human heart sought to enjoy—he did them all, he enjoyed them all. His walls and halls, terraces and pavilions, gardens and parks, ponds and pools, food and drink, carriages and robes, music and concubines—all rivaled those of the lords of Qi and Chu.

As for the desires of his heart, the sounds his ears longed to hear, the sights his eyes longed to see, the flavors his mouth longed to taste—even if they came from distant lands or remote states, from regions beyond Qi’s borders, he would inevitably procure them, as if they were mere hedgerow trimmings. In his travels, though mountains and rivers blocked the way, though the roads were long and winding, he would inevitably go, as if merely taking a few steps.

Each day, a hundred guests filled his courtyard; in his kitchens, the smoke and fire never ceased; in his halls and corridors, the music never ended. After providing for his own needs, he first distributed the surplus to his clansmen; after his clansmen, he gave to the villagers; after the villagers, he dispersed what remained throughout the state.

At sixty years of age, his vitality waning, he abandoned his household affairs and scattered all his storehouses, treasures, carriages, robes, concubines, and attendants. Within a year, he had exhausted everything, leaving no wealth for his descendants. When he fell ill, he had no medicines stored; when he died—

With no resources for burial. The people of the state who had received his bounty pooled their contributions to inter him and returned his wealth to his descendants.

Qin Gu Li heard of this and said, "Duanmu Shu is a madman—he has disgraced his ancestors." Duan Gan Sheng heard of it and said, "Duanmu Shu is an enlightened man—his virtue surpasses that of his ancestors. What he did and how he acted may shock the common mind, yet it is truly in accord with principle. The gentlemen of Wei, though they cling to propriety and ritual, were fundamentally incapable of winning this man’s heart."

Meng Sun Yang asked Yangzi, "Suppose there were a man here who valued life and cherished his body, seeking not to die—would that be acceptable?"
Yangzi said, "In principle, there is no not-dying."
"Then seeking long life—would that be acceptable?"
"In principle, there is no long life. Life is not preserved by valuing it, nor is the body made substantial by cherishing it. And what is the point of long life? The five passions of love and hate were the same in ancient times as now; the safety or peril of the four limbs were the same in ancient times as now; the joys and sorrows of worldly affairs were the same in ancient times as now; the alternations of order and chaos were the same in ancient times as now. Having heard of these things, having seen them, having experienced them, one may grow weary of a mere hundred years—how much more the suffering of long life?"

Meng Sun Yang said, "If that is so, then swift death is better than long life. Then one might tread upon blades, plunge into boiling water, and achieve one’s aim."
Yangzi said, "Not so. Once born, one should let go and follow the course, exhausting one’s desires until death comes. When death approaches, one should again let go and follow the course, exhausting one’s destiny until the end. There is nothing not to let go, nothing not to follow—why rush to choose between swiftness and slowness?"

Yang Zhu said, "Bo Cheng Zi Gao did not use a single hair to benefit others, abandoning his state to live as a recluse and till the soil. Great Yu did not use his whole body for his own benefit, leaving one side of his body withered. The ancients would not give up a single hair to benefit the world, nor would they accept the whole world’s offerings for their own bodies. If each person refrained from giving up a single hair, and no one sought to benefit the world, the world would be well-ordered."

Qinzi asked Yang Zhu, "If you could pluck out one hair from your body to save the world, would you not do it?"
Yangzi said, "The world cannot be saved by a single hair."
Qinzi said, "But suppose it could—would you do it?"
Yangzi did not answer.

Qinzi went out and told Meng Sun Yang. Meng Sun Yang said, "You do not understand the Master’s heart. Allow me to explain. Suppose someone could endure pain to their skin and flesh to gain ten thousand gold—would you do it?"
Qinzi said, "I would."
Meng Sun Yang said, "Suppose someone could sever one of your limbs to gain a kingdom—would you do it?"
Qinzi was silent for a while.

Meng Sun Yang said, "A single hair is smaller than skin and flesh, and skin and flesh are smaller than a limb—this much is obvious. Yet it is by accumulating hairs that skin and flesh are formed, and by accumulating skin and flesh that limbs are formed. A single hair is but one ten-thousandth of the body—how can it be taken lightly?"

Qinzi said, "I have no answer to give you. But if you were to ask Lao Dan or Guan Yin with your words, your argument would be correct; if I were to ask Yu or Mo Di with mine, my argument would be correct."

Meng Sun Yang then turned and discussed other matters with his disciples.

Yang Zhu said, "The world’s praise is heaped upon Shun, Yu, the Zhou kings, and Confucius, while its blame is heaped upon Jie and Zhou. Yet Shun plowed at Heyang and made pottery at Leize, his four limbs never knowing a moment’s rest, his mouth and belly never tasting fine food; his parents did not love him, his brothers and sisters did not treat him as kin. At thirty, he married without informing his parents. Then he received Yao’s abdication, by which time he was already old and his wisdom had declined. When Shang Jun proved unworthy, he abdicated to Yu, and lived out his days in sorrow—this was the bitter extremity of heaven and man. Gun’s governance of flood control failed, and he was executed at Feather Mountain. Yu inherited the task and avenged him, focusing solely on the wild lands, so that his son Qi was not raised and he passed his own door without entering; his body became withered on one side, his hands and feet calloused. When he received Shun’s abdication, he lived in a humble palace, wore fine robes and caps, and lived out his days in sorrow—this was the suffering of one without human aid. After King Wu’s death, King Cheng was young and weak, and the Duke of Zhou acted as regent for the Son of Heaven. The Duke of Shao was displeased, and the four states spread rumors. After three years in the east, he executed his brother and exiled another, barely saving himself, and lived out his days in sorrow—this was the peril and fear of heaven and man. Confucius clarified the Way of the emperors and kings, responding to the summons of the rulers of his time. He was barred from a tree in Song, his traces were erased in Wei, he was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged in Chen and Cai, humiliated by the Ji family, insulted by Yang Hu, and lived out his days in sorrow—this was the haste and distress of the world’s people. These four sages lived without a single day of joy, yet in death they gained fame for ten thousand generations. Fame, however, is not something real that can be taken. Though it is praised, one does not know it; though it is rewarded, one does not feel it—it is no different from a clod of earth. Jie inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored position of the ruler; his wisdom was sufficient to keep his ministers in check, his might sufficient to shake the world. He indulged his ears and eyes to the full, exhausted the desires of his heart and mind, and lived out his days in carefree abandon—this was the dissipation of the world’s people. Zhou also inherited the resources of generations, occupying the honored position of the ruler. His might knew no bounds, his will no opposition. He gave free rein to his passions in the Leaning Palace, indulged his desires through long nights..."

They did not torment themselves with ritual and righteousness, but lived in carefree abandon until their execution—these were the wanton among the world’s people. Those two tyrants enjoyed the pleasures of unbridled desire in life, yet in death bore the name of folly and violence. Reality is not something fame can bestow; though reviled, they did not know it; though praised, they did not know it—how were they different from a clod of earth? Those four sages, though the object of all praise, suffered to the end, and were no different from the dead. Those two tyrants, though the object of all condemnation, took pleasure to the end, yet met the same fate as the dead.

Yang Zhu met with King Hui of Liang and said that governing the world was as easy as turning something in the palm of one’s hand. The king said, “You, sir, cannot even manage one wife and concubine, nor tend three *mu* of garden—how can you claim that governing the world is as easy as turning something in the palm of your hand?” Yang Zhu replied, “Have you seen a shepherd? A hundred sheep in a flock, and a five-foot boy carrying a switch can drive them, wanting them to go east and they go east, wanting them to go west and they go west. But if Yao were to lead a single sheep, with Shun carrying the switch behind him, they would not be able to move forward. Moreover, I have heard that fish large enough to swallow a boat do not swim in shallow streams, and swans soaring high do not alight in filthy ponds. Why? Their aims are too lofty.”

The grand tones of *huangzhong* and *dalü* cannot accompany frantic, clamorous dances—why? Their notes are too sparse. One who would govern great things does not govern trifles; one who would achieve great deeds does not achieve small ones. This is what is meant.

Yang Zhu said, “The affairs of the farthest antiquity have perished—who records them? The deeds of the Three Sovereigns flicker between existence and oblivion; those of the Five Emperors waver between waking and dream; those of the Three Kings now hide, now appear, and of a hundred, one cannot recognize a single one. The affairs of one’s own lifetime—some heard, some seen—of ten thousand, one cannot recognize a single one. The matters before one’s eyes—some preserved, some discarded—of a thousand, one cannot recognize a single one. From remotest antiquity to the present day, the years are simply too many to count. Yet from Fuxi onward, more than three hundred thousand years have passed, and all distinctions of worth and folly, beauty and ugliness, success and failure, right and wrong have dissolved—only a matter of sooner or later. To pride oneself on fleeting praise or blame, tormenting body and spirit in pursuit of it, and to seek a lingering name for a few hundred years after death—can this moisten dry bones? Where is the joy in life?”

Yang Zhu said: "Humans resemble the class of Heaven and Earth, bearing the nature of the Five Constants, and are the most numinous of living beings. Yet their claws and teeth are insufficient for defense, their skin and flesh insufficient for self-protection, their speed and agility insufficient to evade harm or pursue advantage. Lacking fur or feathers to shield against cold and heat, they must rely on external things for sustenance, depending on wisdom by nature and strength by necessity.

Thus, what wisdom values most is preserving the self; what strength deems basest is encroaching upon others. Yet the body does not truly belong to oneself—once born, one cannot but preserve it; things do not truly belong to oneself—once possessed, one cannot but relinquish them. The body is indeed the master of life, just as things are the master of sustenance.

Though one preserves the body, one cannot claim ownership of it; though one does not discard things, one cannot claim ownership of them. To claim ownership of the body or things is to wrongfully appropriate the world’s bodies and things. Only the sage can do this: sharing the world’s body, sharing the world’s things—only the perfected person achieves this. This is what is called the utmost of the utmost."

Yang Zhu said: "The people cannot rest, for four reasons: first, for longevity; second, for fame; third, for rank; and fourth, for wealth. With these four, one fears ghosts, fears others, fears authority, and fears punishment—this is what is called a fugitive from life. Whether one lives or dies, control over fate lies outside oneself.

Not resisting fate, why crave longevity? Not prizing nobility, why crave fame? Not seeking power, why crave rank? Not coveting riches, why crave wealth? This is what is called a compliant person. With nothing in the world to oppose, control over fate lies within. Thus, the saying goes: 'If one does not marry or enter officialdom, half of human desires vanish; if one does not seek clothing or food, the Way of ruler and subject ceases.'

A Zhou proverb says: 'A field laborer can be killed by ease.' Rising at dawn and returning at dusk, he takes this as the constant of his nature; eating coarse beans and greens, he takes this as the finest of flavors. His flesh is rough and thick, his sinews and joints taut and stiff. If one morning he is placed upon soft furs and fine silks, offered fine grains and meats, orchids and citrus, his heart will sicken and his body grow weary, and internal heat will breed illness. If the lords of Shang and Lu were to exchange places with a field laborer, they too would not endure for a single day before collapsing in exhaustion. Thus, what the rustic finds at peace, what the rustic finds beautiful—he deems nothing in the world surpasses it.

Formerly, in the state of Song, there was a field laborer who always wore tattered hempen clothes, barely enough to survive the winter. When spring came and the eastern fields were tilled, he basked in the sun, unaware of the world’s vast mansions and secluded chambers, of silk floss and fox-fur robes. Turning to his wife, he said: 'The warmth of the sun on my back—no one knows of this. If I present it to our lord, I shall receive great reward.' A wealthy man of his village told him: 'Once, there was a man who praised the fine taste of wild beans, the sweetness of water-bamboo shoots, water-celery, and duckweed seeds to the village magnate. The magnate took them and tasted them, and they stung his mouth and pained his stomach. The crowd laughed and reviled him, and the man was deeply ashamed. You are of this kind.'"

Yang Zhu said: "Grand mansions and fine robes, rich flavors and fair faces—with these four, what more could one seek? Yet those who possess them and still seek beyond are of insatiable nature. Such insatiable nature is the blight of yin and yang.

Loyalty is not enough to secure a ruler’s peace, but only enough to endanger oneself. Righteousness is not enough to benefit others, but only enough to harm one’s life. Peace for superiors does not arise from loyalty, yet the name of loyalty is extinguished. Benefit for others does not arise from righteousness, yet the name of righteousness is lost.

When ruler and subject are both at peace, and self and others both benefit—this was the Dao of antiquity.

Master Yu said: *'Abandon fame, and you will have no worries.'*
Laozi said: *'Fame is but the guest of reality.'*
Yet the restless still chase fame without cease.

Can fame truly be abandoned? Can it truly be treated as a mere guest?

Now, with fame comes honor and glory; without fame, disgrace and humiliation. Honor and glory bring ease and joy; disgrace and humiliation bring sorrow and suffering. Sorrow and suffering violate one’s nature; ease and joy accord with it—this is what reality depends upon.

How can fame be abandoned? How can it be treated as a mere guest?"

Yet what is detestable is clinging to fame at the expense of reality. To cling to fame at the expense of reality is to court peril and ruin beyond salvation—how could it be merely a matter of ease and joy versus sorrow and suffering?

**Explaining Symbols, Chapter Eight**

Master Liezi studied under Master Huqiu Zilin.
Master Huqiu Zilin said: *"If you understand holding back, then we may speak of holding the self."*
Liezi said: *"I wish to hear about holding back."*
He replied: *"Turn and observe your shadow, and you will know."*

Liezi turned and observed his shadow: when the body bent, the shadow curved; when the body straightened, the shadow aligned. Thus, crookedness and straightness followed the body and did not reside in the shadow; bending and extending depended on things and not on the self—this is what is meant by *holding back yet being foremost.*

Guan Yin said to Master Liezi: *"Beautiful words produce a beautiful echo; ugly words produce an ugly echo. A tall body casts a long shadow; a short body casts a short shadow. Fame is but an echo; the self is but a shadow. Thus it is said: Be cautious in your words, for harmony will follow; be cautious in your conduct, for consequences will follow. Therefore, the sage observes the outward to know the inward, examines the past to know the future—this is the principle by which foresight is attained. Measurement lies in the self; verification lies in others. If others love me, I must love them; if others hate me, I must hate them. Tang and Wu loved all under heaven, thus they reigned as kings; Jie and Zhou hated all under heaven, thus they perished—this is what is verified. When both measurement and verification are clear yet not acted upon, it is like leaving without using the door or walking without following the path. Seeking benefit in this way—is it not difficult?"*

Yan Hui said: *"Those who ask about the Dao seek wealth. Now that I have obtained a pearl, I am wealthy—why need the Dao?"*
Master Liezi said: *"Jie and Zhou prized profit and belittled the Dao, thus they perished. How fortunate that I have not yet spoken to you of this! A person without righteousness, who eats only for sustenance, is no better than a chicken or a dog. Those who fiercely compete for food, where the stronger dominate—are but beasts. To be no better than chickens, dogs, or beasts, yet desire others’ respect—it cannot be attained. If others do not respect you, then peril and disgrace will befall you."*

Liezi studied archery and hit the mark, then sought instruction from Master Guanyin. The master asked: *"Do you know why you hit the mark?"*
Liezi replied: *"I do not."*
Guanyin said: *"Not yet."*

He withdrew and practiced further. After three years, he returned to report to Guanyin.
The master asked: *"Do you now know why you hit the mark?"*
Liezi said: *"I do."*
Guanyin said: *"Now it is sufficient. Hold to this and do not lose it. This is not only true for archery—governing a state and cultivating oneself are likewise. Thus the sage does not examine survival or extinction but examines the target that makes it so."*

Liezi said: *"Those whose appearance is grand grow arrogant; those whose strength is great become reckless—they cannot be spoken to of the Dao. Thus, even those with graying hair should not be carelessly instructed in the Dao’s loss, let alone those who act upon it? Therefore, one who acts recklessly will find no one to guide them. If no one guides them, they remain isolated and without support. The worthy entrust others, so even in old age they do not decline, and when wisdom is exhausted, they do not fall into chaos. Thus the difficulty in governing a state lies in knowing the worthy, not in being worthy oneself."*

In Song, there was a man who crafted a mulberry leaf from jade for his lord, taking three years to complete it. Its veins, stems, and branches were exquisitely detailed, with fine serrations and lustrous sheen—when mixed among real mulberry leaves, it could not be distinguished. This man then lived off his craft in Song.

When Master Liezi heard of this, he said: *"If heaven and earth took three years to produce a single leaf, there would be few leaves in the world. Thus the sage relies on the transformative power of the Dao and not on clever skill."*

Master Liezi was impoverished, his appearance bearing the pallor of hunger. A guest mentioned this to Ziyang, the minister of Zheng, saying: *"Lie Yukou is surely a man of the Dao, yet he dwells in your state in poverty. Does our lord not favor scholars?"* Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. When Liezi went out and saw the messenger, he bowed twice and declined. The messenger departed.

Upon returning home, Liezi’s wife struck her breast and said: *"I have heard that the wives and children of those who possess the Dao all live in ease and joy. Yet here you are, starving, and the lord sends you food—why refuse it? Is this not fate?"* Liezi laughed and replied: *"The lord does not know me personally. He sent me grain because of another’s words, and if he were to punish me, it would likewise be because of another’s words. This is why I did not accept."* Later, the people indeed rebelled and killed Ziyang.

The Shi family of Lu had two sons. One loved learning, the other loved military arts. The scholar presented his arts to the Marquis of Qi, who appointed him tutor to the noble sons. The soldier went to Chu and offered his strategies to the king, who delighted in him and made him a military commander. Their salaries enriched the family, and their ranks brought honor to their kin.

The neighboring Meng family also had two sons with the same pursuits, but they were reduced to poverty. Envying the Shi family’s success, they asked for the path to advancement. The Shi brothers told them the truth. One of the Meng sons went to Qin and presented his arts to the king. The King of Qin said: *"Nowadays, the feudal lords vie for power, and all that matters is military strength and provisions. If I govern my state with benevolence and righteousness, it would be the path to ruin."* So he castrated the man and banished him.

The other son went to Wei and offered his strategies to the marquis. The Marquis of Wei said: *"My state is weak, hemmed in by great powers. I serve the strong and soothe the small—this is the way to seek stability. If I relied on military authority, destruction would come swiftly. If I let you return intact to another state, you would become no small threat to me."* So he cut off the man’s feet and sent him back to Lu.

Upon their return, the Meng father and sons beat their chests in reproach against the Shi family. The Shi father said: *"Those who seize the moment prosper; those who miss it perish. Your path was the same as ours, yet your results differ—this is a matter of timing, not error in conduct. Moreover, there is no constant right in the world’s principles, no constant wrong in affairs. What was used before may now be discarded; what is discarded today may later be used. This matter of use and disuse has no fixed right or wrong. Seizing opportunities, adapting to circumstances without fixed method—this depends on wisdom. If wisdom is insufficient, even if one’s learning were as vast as Confucius or one’s strategies as cunning as Lü Shang, where could one go and not meet with failure?"*

The Meng father and sons relaxed their expressions, free of resentment, and said: *"We understand. Say no more."*

Duke Wen of Jin set out with the intention of attacking Wei. His son, Gongzi Chu, looked up to the heavens and laughed. The Duke asked why he laughed. Gongzi Chu replied: *"I laugh at a neighbor who was escorting his wife to her parents’ home. Along the way, he saw a woman picking mulberry leaves, took a liking to her, and struck up a conversation. Yet when he turned to glance at his own wife, there was someone beckoning to her as well. I laugh at this."*

The Duke grasped his meaning and called off the campaign. He turned the army back, and before they had even returned, an enemy had already invaded their northern border.

The state of Jin suffered from rampant banditry. There was a man named Xi Yong who could identify thieves by their appearance, discerning their nature from the space between their brows and lashes. When the Marquis of Jin sent him to inspect for thieves, not one in a thousand or a hundred escaped his notice. The Marquis was overjoyed and told Zhao Wenzi: *"I have found a man who can eliminate all banditry in the state. What need is there for more?"*

Wenzi replied: *"If our lord relies on spies and surveillance to catch thieves, banditry will never end. Moreover, Xi Yong will not meet a good death."*

Soon after, the bandits plotted among themselves: *"The one who has us cornered is Xi Yong."* They then joined forces to kill and mutilate him.

When the Marquis of Jin heard this, he was horrified. He immediately summoned Wenzi and said: *"Just as you predicted, Xi Yong is dead! But how should we deal with the bandits?"*

Wenzi replied: *"There is a saying in the Zhou proverbs: ‘To see the fish in the depths is inauspicious; to predict what is hidden brings misfortune.’ If Your Lordship wishes to eliminate banditry, there is no better way than to appoint worthy men and entrust them with governance. Let instruction be clear from above, and transformation spread below. If the people have a sense of shame, what banditry would arise?"*

Thereupon, the Duke appointed Sui Hui to oversee governance, and the bandits fled to Qin.

Confucius, returning to Lu from Wei, halted his carriage at a bridge over the Yellow River to observe. There was a waterfall thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*, where fish and turtles could not swim, and soft-shelled turtles and alligators could not dwell. Yet a man was about to ford it. Confucius sent someone along the bank to stop him, saying: *"This waterfall is thirty *ren* high, its currents swirling for ninety *li*. Fish and turtles cannot swim here, nor can soft-shelled turtles and alligators dwell here. Surely it is impossible to cross?"*

The man paid no heed, waded in, and emerged safely on the other side.

Confucius questioned the man, saying: *"Is this a skill? Or do you possess some Daoist technique? What enables you to enter and emerge unharmed?"*

The man replied: *"When I first entered, I began with loyalty and trust; when I emerged, I followed with loyalty and trust. Loyalty and trust placed my body amidst the waves, and I dared not act out of self-interest. This is why I could enter and emerge again."*

Confucius said to his disciples: *"Take heed, all of you! Even water may be approached with loyalty and trust to align oneself with sincerity—how much more so with people?"*

Bai Gong asked Confucius: *"Can one speak in subtle words with others?"*
Confucius did not respond.

Bai Gong asked again: *"If a stone is thrown into water, what then?"*
Confucius said: *"A skilled diver from Wu could retrieve it."*

Bai Gong said: *"If water is poured into water, what then?"*
Confucius replied: *"When the Zi and Mian rivers merge, Yi Ya could taste and distinguish them."*

Bai Gong said: *"Then is it truly impossible to speak in subtle words with others?"*
Confucius said: *"Why would it be impossible? Only one who knows the meaning of words can do so. For one who knows the meaning of words does not speak with mere words. Those who fight over fish get drenched; those who chase beasts must run—yet they do not delight in it. Thus, the highest words transcend speech, and the highest action is non-action. What shallow minds contend over is but the trivial."*

Bai Gong, unable to grasp this, later died in his bath.

Viscount Xiang of Zhao sent Xin Zhi Muzi to attack the Di. Victorious, he captured the cities of Zuoren and Zhongren. A messenger was sent to announce the news. The Viscount was eating when his expression turned troubled.

His attendants said: *"Two cities fell in a single morning—this is cause for joy. Why does my lord appear troubled?"*

The Viscount said: *"The greatness of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers lasts no more than three days; violent winds and torrential rains do not endure past morning; the midday sun does not linger. Now the virtue of the Zhao house has not been cultivated over time, yet two cities fell in a single morning. Ruin may yet reach us!"*

When Confucius heard of this, he said: *"The Zhao house will flourish! For it is through worry that one flourishes, and through joy that one perishes. Victory is not the difficult part; maintaining it is. A worthy ruler sustains victory in this way, and so his blessings extend to later generations. Qi, Chu, Wu, and Yue all once triumphed, yet ultimately met their downfall—they did not understand how to maintain victory. Only a ruler of the Dao can do so."*

Confucius’s strength was such that he could force open a city gate’s bolt, yet he was not known for his physical power. Mozi devised defenses against siege engines, and Gongshu Ban conceded, yet he was not renowned for military knowledge. Thus, those who skillfully maintain victory turn strength into weakness.

There was a man of Song who diligently practiced benevolence and righteousness for three generations without faltering. One day, his family’s black ox gave birth to a white calf. He asked Confucius about it, who said: *"This is an auspicious omen—offer it to the Supreme Lord."*

A year later, the man’s father suddenly went blind, and the ox bore another white calf. The father again sent his son to ask Confucius. The son said: *"Last time, you asked and he lost his sight. Why ask again?"*

The father replied: *"The words of a sage may first seem contrary but later prove fitting. The matter is not yet settled—ask once more."*

The son again questioned Confucius, who said: *"It is auspicious."* He instructed them to perform the sacrifice. The son returned and reported this. The father said: *"Follow Confucius’s words."*

A year later, the son also went blind. Later, when Chu attacked Song and besieged the city, the people resorted to exchanging children to eat and breaking bones for fuel. The able-bodied all climbed the walls to fight, and more than half perished. But this man and his father, being afflicted, were spared. When the siege lifted, their sight was restored.

In Song there was a man called Lanzi who sought patronage from Duke Yuan of Song by offering his skills. The duke summoned him and had him demonstrate his art: he bound two rods twice his height to his shins, then ran swiftly forward and back, juggling seven swords, tossing them in rapid succession so that five were always aloft in the air. The duke was astonished and immediately bestowed upon him gold and silk.

Another Lanzi, skilled in the art of the swallow dance, heard of this and likewise sought the duke’s favor. The duke grew furious and said: *"Formerly, a man with extraordinary skills sought my patronage. Though his art was of no practical use, it happened to please me at the time, so I rewarded him with gold and silk. This one must have heard of it and now comes seeking my favor again."* He had the man seized and nearly executed, only releasing him after a month.

Duke Mu of Qin said to Bo Le: *"You are advanced in years. Among your kinsmen, is there anyone I might send to seek horses?"* Bo Le replied: *"A fine horse can be recognized by its form, appearance, sinews, and bones. But the horse of the world—elusive as vanishing, as if lost—leaves no trace of dust or track. My sons are all of mediocre talent; they may be taught to recognize a fine horse, but not the horse of the world. I have a companion with whom I gather firewood and vegetables, named Jiu Fang Gao. In matters of horses, he is no inferior to me. I beg you to receive him."*

The duke granted him an audience and sent him forth to seek horses.

Three months later, he returned and reported: *"I have found it—it is in Shaqiu."* Duke Mu asked: *"What kind of horse is it?"* He replied: *"A yellow mare."* The duke sent men to fetch it, but it was a black stallion. Displeased, Duke Mu summoned Bo Le and said: *"A failure! The man you sent to seek horses cannot even distinguish color or sex—how could he know a horse?"*

Bo Le sighed deeply and said: *"Has it truly come to this? This is why he surpasses me ten thousandfold without measure. What Gao observes is the celestial mechanism: he grasps its essence and forgets its surface, attends to its inner nature and disregards its outward form. He sees what should be seen and does not see what should not; he regards what should be regarded and ignores what should not. In Gao’s appraisal of horses, what he values lies beyond the horse itself."*

When the horse arrived, it was indeed the horse of the world.

King Zhuang of Chu asked Zhan He: *"How should one govern the state?"* Zhan He replied: *"Your servant understands the governance of the self but not the governance of the state."* King Zhuang said: *"I have been entrusted with the ancestral temples and the altars of soil and grain. I wish to learn how to preserve them."* Zhan He replied: *"I have never heard of a well-governed self with a disordered state, nor of a disordered self with a well-governed state. Thus, the root lies in the self—I dare not speak of the branches."*

The king said: *"Well said!"*

An elder of Huqiu said to Sunshu Ao: *"There are three resentments among men—do you know them?"* Sunshu Ao replied: *"What are they?"* The elder answered: *"Those of high rank are envied by others; those in great office are resented by their lord; those with ample emolument are beset by grievances."*

Sunshu Ao said: *"As my rank grows higher, my aspirations grow humbler; as my office grows greater, my heart grows narrower; as my emolument grows richer, my generosity grows wider. By this, may I avoid the three resentments?"*

When Sunshu Ao fell gravely ill and was near death, he admonished his son: *"The king will repeatedly offer me a fief, but I shall not accept it. After my death, the king will then enfeoff you. You must not accept fertile land! Between Chu and Yue, there is a place called Qinqiu—this land is barren and its name most inauspicious. The people of Chu revere ghosts, and the people of Yue revere omens; only this place may be held in perpetuity."*

After Sunshu Ao’s death, the king indeed offered his son a fine domain. The son declined and requested Qinqiu instead. It was granted to him, and to this day it has not been lost.

Niu Que was a great Confucian scholar from Shangdi. Traveling south to Handan, he encountered bandits in the sands of Ou. They took all his clothing and carriage, leaving him to walk away with his ox. Gazing at him, they saw no trace of distress or resentment on his face. The bandits pursued him and asked the reason. Niu Que replied, *"A noble man does not harm what he nurtures for the sake of what nurtures him."* The bandits exclaimed, *"Ah! How virtuous!"* Then they conferred among themselves: *"With his virtue, if he goes to see the Lord of Zhao, and the lord takes us as an example, we will surely be ruined. It is better to kill him."* So they pursued and slew him.

When the people of Yan heard of this, they gathered their clans and warned one another: *"If you encounter bandits, do not be like Niu Que of Shangdi!"* All heeded this lesson. Soon after, Niu Que’s younger brother traveled to Qin. At the pass, he too encountered bandits. Remembering his brother’s warning, he struggled fiercely with them. When he proved no match, he pursued them again, pleading humbly for his belongings. The bandits grew angry: *"We spared your life generously, yet you persist in chasing us—our tracks will be exposed. Since we are bandits, where is there room for mercy?"* They killed him and slaughtered four or five of his companions as well.

There was a man of Liang named Yu Shi, a wealthy merchant whose household overflowed with abundance—countless coins and silks, boundless treasures. He ascended a high tower overlooking the main road, where music and wine were laid out. Gamblers played on the upper floor while knights followed him on his way. A gambler on the tower shot dice, striking the bright jade target, then laughed as two carved fish flipped over. Just then, a kite swooped down, dropping a rotten rat that struck the target. The knights conferred: *"Yu Shi has been wealthy for a long time, yet he has always held people in contempt. Though we have not offended him, he has humiliated us with this rotten rat. If we do not avenge this, we will have no standing in the world. Let us unite in purpose, lead our followers, and destroy his household to set an example."* All agreed.

On the appointed night, they gathered at Zhiqu, attacked Yu Shi’s home, and utterly destroyed it.

In the east there was a man named Yuan Jingmu, who, while traveling, collapsed from hunger on the road. A bandit from Hufu named Qiu saw him and offered a gourd of food to feed him. After Yuan Jingmu ate three mouthfuls, he could finally see and asked, *"Who are you?"* The man replied, *"I am Qiu of Hufu."* Yuan Jingmu exclaimed, *"Ah! Are you not a bandit? Why do you feed me? I will not eat the food of a bandit on principle."* He pressed his hands to the ground and retched, but nothing came up. Choking, he collapsed and died.

The man from Hufu was indeed a bandit, but the food he offered was not stolen. To call the food stolen simply because the man was a bandit, and thus refuse to eat it, is to confuse name and reality.

Zhu Lishu served Duke Ao of Ju, but believing the duke did not understand him, he withdrew to live by the sea. In summer, he ate water caltrops and water chestnuts; in winter, acorns. When Duke Ao of Ju faced disaster, Zhu Lishu bid farewell to his friends and went to die for him. His friends said, *"You left because you believed he did not understand you. Now you go to die for him—what difference is there between understanding and not understanding?"* Zhu Lishu replied, *"It is not so. I left because I believed he did not understand me. Now, in dying for him, I prove he truly did not understand me. I will die to shame future rulers who fail to recognize their ministers."* To die for those who understand you and not for those who do not—this is to walk the straight path. Zhu Lishu may be called one who resented injustice to the point of forgetting himself.

Yang Zhu said, *"Benefits given bring real returns; resentments sent invite harm in return. What is initiated within finds response without—only requests are exempt. Thus the wise are cautious in what they put forth."*

Yang Zhu’s neighbor lost a sheep. The neighbor led his own followers and also asked Yang Zhu’s servants to join the pursuit. Yang Zhu said, *"Hmm! Why so many pursuers for one lost sheep?"* The neighbor replied, *"There are many branching paths."* When they returned, Yang Zhu asked, *"Did you recover the sheep?"* The neighbor said, *"It is lost."* Yang Zhu asked, *"How was it lost?"*

Yang Zhu said, *"Among the branching paths there are yet more branches. I knew not where to go, and so I turned back."* Yang Zhu’s countenance fell into sorrow, and for a long while he did not speak; for the rest of the day, he did not smile. His disciples found this strange and asked, *"The sheep is but a lowly beast, and moreover not your own—why should its loss affect your words and laughter so?"* Yang Zhu did not answer. His disciples could not fathom his intent.

Later, the disciple Meng Sunyang went out and told this to Xin Duzi. Another day, Xin Duzi came with Meng Sunyang and asked, *"Once there were three brothers who traveled together in Qi and Lu, studying under the same master. They returned having advanced in the Dao of benevolence and righteousness. Their father asked, ‘What is this Dao of benevolence and righteousness?’ The eldest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me cherish my life before my reputation.’ The second said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness make me sacrifice my life to perfect my reputation.’ The youngest said, ‘Benevolence and righteousness allow me to preserve both life and reputation.’ These three teachings are at odds, yet all stem from the Ru. Which is right, and which is wrong?"*

Yangzi said, *"There was a man who lived by the river. Skilled in the water, bold in swimming, he plied the boat to ferry passengers, profiting enough to feed a hundred mouths. Those who wrapped their rations and came to study from him formed a throng, yet nearly half drowned. They studied swimming but not drowning—yet the gain and loss turned out thus. If you were to judge, which is right, and which is wrong?"*

Xin Duzi fell silent and left. Meng Sunyang reproached him, *"Why did you ask such a roundabout question, only for the Master to answer so obliquely? Now my confusion is even greater."*

Xin Duzi said, *"The great Dao scatters sheep across many forking paths; scholars lose their lives amid too many methods. The root of learning is not different, nor is its origin divided, yet the branches diverge so. Only by returning to unity and reverting to the One can loss and gain be avoided. You have long stood at the Master’s gate, studied the Master’s Way, yet fail to grasp the Master’s circumstances—how lamentable!"*

Yang Zhu’s younger brother, Bu, went out wearing plain white clothes. When the sky rained, he removed the white garments and returned in black. His dog, not recognizing him, rushed forward and barked. Yang Bu grew angry and was about to strike it.

Yang Zhu said, *"Do not strike it! You yourself are no different. If your dog had gone out white and returned black, how could it not have been startled?"*

Yang Zhu said, *"To act with goodness not for the sake of fame, yet fame follows; fame not sought for profit, yet profit accrues; profit not pursued in contention, yet contention arises—thus the noble person must be cautious in doing good."*

Formerly, there was a man who claimed to know the Dao of immortality. The Lord of Yan sent someone to learn it, but before success was achieved, the speaker died. The Lord of Yan was furious with his envoy and was about to punish him. A favored courtier advised, *"What people fear most is nothing so urgent as death; what they value most is nothing beyond life. He himself lost his life—how could he have enabled you to avoid death?"* Thus, the envoy was not punished.

There was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Dao. Hearing that the speaker had died, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, upon hearing of this, laughed and said, *"He desired to learn the art of not dying, yet the man himself died, and still he regrets it—this is to misunderstand why people study."*

Huzi said, *"Fuzi’s words are mistaken. There are indeed those who possess a method but cannot practice it, just as there are those who can practice it but lack the method. In Wei, there was a man skilled in calculation who, on his deathbed, taught the secret to his son. His son memorized his father’s words but could not put them into practice. When another person asked him, he repeated what his father had told him."*

The questioner applied his words and practiced the method, achieving results no different from his father’s. If this is so, why could the dead not speak the art of living?"

The people of Handan presented doves to Jianzi on the first morning of the new year. Jianzi was greatly pleased and rewarded them generously. A guest asked the reason. Jianzi said, "On New Year’s Day, I release living creatures to demonstrate my benevolence." The guest replied, "The people know you wish to release them, so they compete to capture them—many die in the process. If you truly wish to preserve life, it would be better to forbid the people from capturing them. To capture and then release them is a kindness that does not compensate for the harm done." Jianzi said, "So it is."

The Tian clan of Qi held a sacrificial feast in their courtyard, hosting a thousand guests. During the feast, someone presented fish and wild geese. Lord Tian gazed at them and sighed, saying, "How generous Heaven is to the people! It cultivates the five grains and gives life to fish and birds for our use." The assembled guests echoed his words like an echo. Bao’s son, twelve years old, was among the guests. He stepped forward and said, "It is not as you say. The myriad things of Heaven and Earth are born alongside us as fellow kinds. There is no inherent nobility or baseness among kinds—only differences in size, intelligence, and strength by which they dominate one another, preying in turn. They are not born for one another’s sake. Humans take what is edible and eat it—how could Heaven have originally created them for human use? Moreover, mosquitoes and gnats bite our skin, and tigers and wolves devour flesh—did Heaven originally create humans for mosquitoes and gnats, or flesh for tigers and wolves?"

In Qi, there was a poor man who often begged in the marketplace.

The townsfolk grew weary of his frequent begging, and none would give him alms. He then went to the stables of the Tian family, where he worked under the horse-doctor and lodged in the outer city in exchange for food. Someone mocked him, saying, "To eat by tending horses—is this not shameful?" The beggar replied, "Of all shames under Heaven, none surpasses begging. If begging is not shameful, how could tending horses be?"

A man of Song was traveling along a road when he found a discarded contract. He took it home and hid it, secretly counting its notches. He told his neighbor, "I shall soon be rich." A man had a withered parasol tree, and his elderly neighbor said that withered parasol trees were inauspicious. The man immediately cut it down. The neighbor then asked to take it as firewood. The man grew displeased and said, "The old neighbor only wanted firewood and so urged me to cut it down. To have such a neighbor—how treacherous can one be?"

A man lost his axe and suspected his neighbor’s son. He observed the boy’s gait—it was that of an axe-thief; his expression—it was that of an axe-thief; his speech—it was that of an axe-thief; every movement and mannerism was that of an axe-thief.
