# 太虚集录

From the *Suoguan Continued: On the Dual Cultivation of Nature and Destiny* (Collected Works of Taixu)

The ancient sages declared: "Cultivation comprises three vehicles—celestial immortals, terrestrial immortals, and aquatic immortals—yet its methods adhere to but three principles. What are these three? Uprightness of form, emptiness of mind, and sincerity of intent." (Intent here signifies *zhi*, the master governing inner and outer; hence it is also called the "host within.") These three phrases are the unceasing, moment-to-moment foundation of the dual-cultivation school (those who refine both nature and destiny), never to be neglected. (Neglect here means forgetfulness.) The progression or moderation of their practice may be self-assessed and maintained. (For innate dispositions vary in brightness and obscurity, constitutions in thickness and thinness, yin and yang in dominance and subordination, circumstances in busyness and leisure, and seasons in winter and summer.)

The alchemical texts record nothing but oral instructions for nurturing destiny, yet their application must strike the mean, and their refinement must align with the proper time. For the year has its two solstices, the month its new and full moons, the day its midnight and noon, and the body its natural *qi*-mechanisms. (Mechanism denotes the harbinger of movement, the foreknowledge of ascent and descent.) These manifest in diverse phenomena. (By quietly observing the mechanism, fortune and misfortune may be divined; once manifested, they are already determined. To attempt reversal, one must employ intention at the moment of the mechanism’s inception, awaiting its manifestation to adjust with subtlety—this is the art.)

The essence of fire-times lies therein. In truth, its secrets reduce to nothing more than ascent and descent, release and gathering. Its benefits and harms hinge on whether one forces or follows nature, whether one flows freely or clings obstinately, and whether one adheres steadfastly or wavers in doubt. The ancients condensed a year into a month, a month into a day, a day into an hour, and an hour into a moment—this they called "stealing the workings of creation." The *Mirror of Ingredient Entry* preserves their method, and all alchemical classics transmit it; none who practice it fail to witness its efficacy.

Yet the ancient sages insisted one must follow the body’s rhythms to await the proper time—time here refers to the "living midnight," and the body to the Dao-body. Consider: in winter and spring, the *qi*-mechanism favors delayed penetration. The method begins at the lower extreme, where *qi* pierces the *weilu*, ascends the spine, penetrates the *yuzhen*, and enters the *niwan*, where it lingers briefly before descending. It then flows from the *huachi* down the *chonglou*, pauses at the *jiangong*, and passes through the heart. (The *niwan* is called the Sea of Marrow; when warmth reaches the brain, it transforms into fluid. The *huachi* is the meeting point of the *Ren* and *Du* meridians, hence the brief pause is not confined to the *niwan* alone. The *chonglou* descends directly, while the *jiangong* is the palace storing *qi*; the fluid descending from the brain’s reservoir may here transform into blood.)

After passing the heart, it divides into two pathways to reach the lower back and kidneys, where it lingers again. (Behind the heart, two channels connect to the waist and kidneys. When one overtaxes the heart, its blood withers, and the kidneys’ essence reverses upward to rescue it—hence those who overwork the heart invariably deplete their kidneys, giving rise to symptoms of lumbar soreness and pain. By guiding the *qi* downward from the heart, blood follows, transforming into white essence while kidney-*qi* flourishes—thus the need for a brief pause.)

When warmth is felt converging toward the abdomen, encircling the navel, one must dwell upon it intently. (This is the wondrous function of refining fluid into *qi*, hence the need for deep focus.) Then, directing intention to the *mingmen*, one must linger there for an extended time. (This is the wondrous function of refining *qi* into *yang*-essence, hence the need for prolonged focus. According to the refinement methods, the *mingmen*, *jiangque*, and *niwan* are the three sacred sites shared by immortals and mortals alike. If one can concentrate here, essence, *qi*, and spirit will flourish; without these three, no immortal practice can begin. Yet the Water Palace is inherently cold, the *jiangque* inherently warm, the lower extreme a gathering place of yin turbidity, and the *niwan* the celestial realm of purity. Water by nature moistens and descends, fire by nature flames upward—how then can water be made to ascend and fire to descend? Without the command of intention, they will not obey. To make cold warm and heat cool, one must rely on true intention to reverse their course, though this also follows an inherent principle.

For the Water Palace possesses its own *mingmen*, resembling a lapis lazuli lamp before the Buddha, burning day and night without extinguishing. The *jiangque* contains the *huachi*, with the heart’s sprout nestled within, while the Sea of Marrow above and the straight yin below envelop it—this is the innate, heaven-crafted true realm. The ancient sages, within this true realm, silently employed true intention to sustain it.

If beginning at the Water Palace, at the living midnight when yang arises, one prevents outward leakage while silently gathering the four true fires to enter the *mingmen*. There, yang naturally flourishes, the host of yin delights in refinement, cold transforms into warmth, and true yang is nourished, making ascent effortless. Once ascended, the marvel of "transformation through passage, preservation through spirit" ensures unimpeded ascent—this is the natural wonder of the *Du* meridian’s thoroughfare to the extreme.

If beginning at the *jiangque*, at the living noon when yin arises, one prevents internal stagnation while silently gathering the four true waters to converge in the *huachi*. There, yin naturally flourishes, the host of yang delights in containment, heat transforms into coolness, and true yin is tempered, making descent smooth. As it descends, the same marvel of "transformation through passage, preservation through spirit" ensures unimpeded flow. The *jiangque* becomes spiritually clear, its heat forgotten, yielding the effects of blood and *qi* transformation. Thus descending to the Central Yellow, it opens a new realm, pacifying all four boundaries—this is the natural efficacy of the *Ren* meridian’s governance of the world.

Thereafter, it pierces the *weilu* and ascends, descends, and lingers as before. The method states that failing to pierce the *weilu* completes one *zhou tian*. (For this practice begins at the lower extreme, and upon returning to it, one full *zhou tian* is accomplished.)

This was titled by ancient sages as the winter-spring practice. If one encounters summer or autumn, one must attune to the qi dynamic, for then the priority lies in prior penetration. The method proceeds thus: after abiding in the Flowery Pond, one descends the Tower of Nine Stories to reach the Crimson Palace, where one should dwell in this Crimson Palace—its realm vast and profound, its ambience leisurely and serene, as if glimpsing the Water of Nature, its waves shimmering in azure (such is the teaching, yet beware of seeking by rote). Suddenly, one feels a cool liquid dripping from the heavens (in this moment of practice, the adept’s nape and back must remain straight, while the head and face adopt a slightly upturned posture). Upon reaching the Heart Palace, the coolness redoubles (as the method cautions, only now does the adept perceive the Water of Nature, realizing that the foregoing merely expounded its principle). At this juncture, one engages in *great abiding*—(what is called *great abiding* harbors no contrivance; to be wholly present yet wholly forgetful is precisely *great abiding*). Then, following the qi’s movement, it flows downward (savor this word *flow*, for it carries the joy of effortless spontaneity), branching to the heart’s posterior (from the heart’s posterior, the two channels diverge to the lumbar kidneys, where wondrous transformations occur: dew-like liquid transmutes into blood, dew-like blood into essence). As it reaches the abdomen, one feels the entire body suffused with misty vapor (this is the sign of surplus liquid transforming into qi). At the lower extreme, fire and heat arise (this is the sign of refining qi into qi). A faint perspiration emerges across the front and back of the body, evoking the sensation of bathing or immersion (if the effects manifest at this stage before completing one *zhou tian*, one may cease practice without harm. To cease, one must first forget the heat for a time). With a slight intention directed rearward (the word *slight* is used because, in summer, the inner landscape favors coolness; if the adept harbors no internal accumulations of cold or stagnation and has attained perspiration, the practice is already sufficient. To add further intention would defy the season), it penetrates the *weilu* and ascends to the crown (though in summer, once the practice has breached the passes and traversed the spine, one may intentionally guide the qi inward to dissolve latent yin accumulations—this too is a key technique). Upon reaching the Muddy Pellet, one must engage in *great abiding* once more (this act of abiding is subtly profound; the adept must not treat it as mere routine. It is the ultimate verification of the *Du* meridian’s penetration, the foundation for the *Ren* meridian’s opening, and the origin of central circulation. The Crimson Palace relies on it for tranquility, the Flowery Pond for purity, the Central Yellow for harmonious governance, and the Mysterious Orifice for spiritual coalescence—all growth and fruition depend on its influence. It is the convergence of inner and outer elixirs. Here, the adept must empty the heart, solidify the mind, follow the qi’s ascent without forgetting or forcing, and allow the qi to return fully, the marrow to clarify like the heavens. Then, the Flute Terrace and Jade Pavilion, the Jasper Gardens and Golden Courts, may fleetingly appear. One must abide in reverence and solemnity, avoiding attachment to such visions. When the adept’s practice deepens, these scenes grow clearer, yet they remain mere bodily phenomena, not yet the true attainment. This pure realm is called the *true reflection*, resembling the state one will ultimately realize upon Daoist accomplishment. For now, *great abiding* requires only heightened clarity and vigilance against wayward thoughts).

Thereafter, it descends from the brain to the Flowery Pond, reaching the Crimson Palace, where one abides once more (this abiding holds great significance, its method profoundly subtle, yet it remains an act of *wuwei* within practice. The Palace is the mansion of blood transformation; when the heart is cool, blood is generated, hence the need for *wuwei*. Blood must return to the channels, so the qi dynamic must be empty. If intention is not relaxed, the dynamic stagnates; if the center lacks gathering intent, blood flows recklessly. The method calls for guiding the dynamic with subtle assistance, while the chest, back, waist, and abdomen follow fixed postures. Any deviation from these postures, though effects may still manifest, will yield vastly different results, even leading to blood disorders. What are these fixed postures? The chest’s posture must incline rearward—this is the secret of emptying the heart and pacifying the Palace; let the adept take heed).

One then feels the entire body refreshed and at ease. The ancients called this one *zhou tian*, thus is the summer-autumn practice. (The ancients, aligning their practice with the seasons, followed this method.) Yet the foregoing describes the standard practice for those without illness. If one suffers from illness, there are other methods to be applied at discretion, always ensuring alignment with the Dao’s nature and the season—only then will the effects be divine. Beware of rigid adherence. If, in summer or autumn, one harbors internal accumulations of cold and stagnation, one should first employ the winter-summer interchange method. When practicing the summer-autumn method proper, the focus is on qi descent. If practicing the winter-spring method, after the qi descends to the abdomen, one engages in *great abiding* and circulation to warm the abdomen. When qi subsequently surges, one raises the buttocks, directs the intention to pierce the *weilu*, traverses the spine to the crown, and attains perspiration as the sign of success. Thereafter, the practice involves only the *forgetting heat* technique (when the heart is utterly still, one may even delve into the realm of no hearing and no seeing, and the heat is forgotten). Adjustments are made in sequence, forming the interchange method. If practicing the summer-autumn method exclusively, one must wait until all internal cold accumulations are expelled before proceeding; otherwise, not only will there be no effect, but the illness may worsen. For those with a constitution prone to phlegm, treatment is best undertaken in summer (at this time, the qi dynamic tends outward; the practitioner follows this outward movement, and internal accumulations are expelled with the qi, eradicating the root of the illness. This is the ancient method of aligning with the seasons).

The method begins by guiding qi downward in sequence. Once the qi has descended, the *sinking and infusing* technique is applied. The practice proceeds only when qi moves within the abdomen and is followed by the warming qi’s subsequent ascent—then the *raising the buttocks* and other formulas may be employed. After practice, if sweat is produced but heat becomes unbearable, the *clearing and descending* technique is added until the qi descends and the chest feels open. Once the qi has descended and the heart is cool, immediately proceed with *spirit-infusion at the Gate of Life*, sensing the qi’s ascent. Then apply the *raising the buttocks* and other formulas, and sweat will naturally permeate. After permeation, continue with the *clearing and descending* method. Practicing in such alternating cycles for one or two seven-day periods will inevitably yield warmth and ascent. Yet one must still apply the *sinking the abdomen* and *spirit-infusion* techniques.

The *sinking the abdomen* technique involves guiding qi downward from the right side of the chest, circling the navel, turning left, retaining it at the center, and propelling it downward—then phlegm will exit through the bowels. The *spirit-infusion* formula involves guiding qi downward from the left side of the chest, circling the navel, turning right, retaining it at the center, and directing the spirit to adhere to the Gate of Life. For the left-downward method advances fire, while the right-downward method retreats the talisman—each holds its own profound significance.

Proceeding thus, after ascent, copious cool fluid will descend from the nape and chest. (When this substance descends, the face must be tilted upward; otherwise, harm may ensue.) Do not mistake this for sweet dew—it is muddy essence, refined by spirit and transformed into descending refined substance. Without undergoing a thorough refinement at the navel wheel, it may still cause harm. The method requires focused infusion at the Gate of Life until fire arises. (This technique involves drawing back the external kidneys with intent when they rise, causing the fire to blaze intensely.) When the heat is like burning charcoal, retain and refine it. Proceed slowly with subsequent permeation techniques, focusing solely on *forgetting heat* while using true intent to horizontally bar the chest, preventing qi from ascending—this is crucial. If carelessness allows permeation, direct intent upward with the eyes to draw in the celestial qi for descent and suppression, causing the qi to return downward. Swiftly follow its momentum to guide it through the posterior pass, where the refined substance will break through. Then lead it with intent to the crown, and profuse sweat will pour like rain. (This is the transformation of accumulated yin into sweat; do not mistakenly fear excessive sweating as yang depletion.) Gradually, it will descend from the crown to the Crimson Palace. If a single drop descends swiftly and feels extremely cool, it is true fluid. If it descends slowly and without coolness, it remains a muddy transformation, not sweet dew. Only when sweet dew is achieved is the effect profound, though one must ensure all accumulated yin is expelled before pursuing further results.

For those suffering from internal heat and restlessness, employ only the *descending formula* or add the *empty-heart* technique, and food will naturally digest. Then practice *guiding fire back to its source*, infusing spirit at the Gate of Life. When qi moves to the lower extreme, follow its momentum in circular motion until turbid fire descends. Gently guide it with intent to release it through the prison gate. Then raise the eyes to the Mud Pill, drawing back pure qi to close the gate, and guide it downward from the Crimson Palace to the navel wheel, permeating the ancestral aperture. Apply the *forgetting* formula to guard it. Once spirit congeals and breath stabilizes, the chest and diaphragm will feel at ease, and the illness will depart. Only then may one proceed to *filling the abdomen*, which must be combined with *spirit-infusion at the Gate of Life*—the abdomen will naturally fill. Thereafter, the *thoroughfare vessel* technique may be practiced. When the thoroughfare vessel is open, fluid will descend, requiring careful discernment between the true and the ordinary—this is also crucial. Only when the descent is genuine may one proceed with formulas such as *refining essence into qi*, *refining qi into spirit*, and *refining spirit to return to emptiness*.

For those suffering from blood heat, qi stagnation, and chest tightness, first practice the *empty-heart* method, then add the *retreat the back* technique. One will feel two streams of refined substance behind the heart, dividing from the heart’s posterior and reaching the waist and kidneys, hot as boiling water. (For this practice, tilting the chest slightly upward is optimal.) Gradually, this heat will encircle the navel wheel, filling the abdomen with warmth and inducing slight sweat throughout the body. At this time, the heart will feel relaxed and open—this is entirely due to the *retreat the back* formula. The *retreat the back* technique involves guiding qi backward from the *Quepen* with intent. *Quepen* is the mansion where the Crimson Palace transforms blood and is also called the *qi repository*. This method has been rarely known since Li Shaojun. For those suffering from frenzied vomiting of networked blood, this formula must be practiced first. Then proceed to *clearing the central pass*, incorporating the *empty-heart* technique. Alternatively, one may start from the *Flowery Pond*, drawing in celestial metal and applying the *empty-heart* formula—this will also cure the illness. Collectively, these are called the summer-autumn methods. Some suggest waiting until the abdomen is fully warm before applying the *raising the buttocks*, *reaching the spine*, and *ascending to the brain* techniques. Once qi reaches the brain, retain it fully, then reverse the gaze to the Mud Pill, guiding this celestial palace’s true qi downward to meet the Conception and Governing Vessels at the Flowery Pond. Sweet dew will fill the mouth; swallow it repeatedly to steam the Crimson Palace, reaching the Central Yellow. One will feel the Crimson Palace cool and the Central Yellow warm and moist. At this point, practice the *tracing the ancients’ divine technique*—this is called *opening the central pass*, also known as *clearing the primordial chaos*. In alchemical texts, it is termed *opening the mysterious pass*. The method involves nothing more than *forgetting forgetting*. Once this pass is opened, the elixir has a place to grow, and the medicine has a repository. What is the true realm revealed? It is boundless and profound. This single principle is the true technique of *establishing life and destiny*—practitioners must treasure it. Alas! Diligence without encountering a true master is futile—practitioners, strive on.

One affliction arises when accumulated yin transforms into fire, presenting as if in excess. The method here is first to employ the summer and autumn techniques to address the branch, and once the condition lessens, add the winter and spring practices—this applies when the accumulated yin has not fully transformed into fire. If it has fully transformed into fire, the method is solely to guide the fire back to its source, with a measured addition of summer and autumn descending formulas to assist the fire’s return, thereby achieving resolution. (For this condition, one must take *ease* as the principle, regard this body as already dead, and whenever a thought arises, sweep it away with the Buddha’s name. Swallowing saliva as it wells up will bring relief.)

If the accumulated yin remains internally stagnant and has not yet transformed into fire, the formula is to internally mobilize the true fire while externally applying rubbing and lifting, circulating without interruption—only then may there be efficacy. (External practices include rubbing the waist and kidneys, abdomen, legs, knees, feet, and hands, as well as repeatedly lifting the shoulders, rotating both arms like a windlass, stretching the legs, swaying the waist, twisting the neck, and pushing upward as if supporting the heavens, washing the face, and swallowing saliva. Internal practices include techniques such as focusing the spirit and breath-holding.)

Wait until the abdomen feels warmth (which breath-holding can achieve), then add the *penetrating the posterior* technique. (Only when the breath-holding technique is mastered will the external penetrating technique yield results.) The reason is that the true *qi* in this region is not vigorous (precisely because the accumulated yin is too abundant), and yang cannot overcome yin, making efficacy difficult to attain. (It is like placing a basin of fire in an ice cellar—how can one feel warmth?) The method is to externally apply rubbing and lifting while internally practicing breath-holding (in this way, the *qi* mechanism becomes lively, and external penetration will eventually occur). Wait until yang is abundant, and the true scene of *self-penetration and self-attack* emerges (though called *self-penetration and self-attack*, it is achieved through breath-holding and other methods), then use intention to break through the pass. (This cannot be done unless one applies the technique when yang arises.) Only when yang is abundant can penetration be achieved.

If the accumulated yin is accompanied by stagnation in the hundred meridians (this condition makes progress even more difficult, as there is much blockage within!), the method is first to practice breath-holding, then add visualization and circulation in the *kun*-abdomen, so that the *qi* naturally penetrates the meridians, achieving signs of free flow. (Only when sweat pours forth like rain over several sessions will this effect be attained.) At this stage (when the practice has reached this point, results begin to appear), one must still apply focused visualization and circulation (if one fears hardship and stops, the furnace will grow cold). Why? The stagnant substances in the hundred meridians, when warmed by *qi*, will naturally follow the *qi* in its movement, converging toward the lower extremity (most people’s practices result in downward leakage for this very reason!). At this lower extremity, the massed yin forces prevail, resembling a basin of fire in a room surrounded by ice walls—warmth cannot overcome the cold. The method is to add more charcoal to the fire, yet even this may not suffice. Thus, one must intensify the effort without regard for time, aiming only for the complete melting of the ice walls—only then will there be great relief. Alas, practitioners often fail to realize this and abandon their efforts at this stage, a common occurrence throughout the ages. The method, therefore, lies in perseverance, diligence, and courage: practice yields results, and even if it does not, one must persist. In this way, though the stagnant substances may be many, they will eventually dissolve—why fear that great efficacy will never be achieved?

Surveying the world, ten or twenty percent of those afflicted with this condition are either merchants or scholars. Why? The condition arises from mental labor and physical idleness. Mental labor depletes the spirit, while physical idleness stagnates the *qi*; a depleted spirit and stagnant *qi* lead one to shun labor and seek ease—this is the origin of yin cold and stagnation. To cure this condition, one must reverse one’s habitual ways. If one can reverse these habits, the illness will naturally heal. Once healed, one may then seek the methods of practice—this is the royal road, to be followed by those who proceed in accord.

As shown above, the work of transformation is not something those of lesser capacity can sustain without giving up halfway. This is why the *Eight Brocades*, *Twelve Brocades*, *Sixteen Brocades*, *Twenty-Four Brocades*, and other such methods have been compassionately taught. For this yin essence forms due to *qi* stagnation; when *qi* stagnates, essence congeals and blood stasis arises. Without martial arts to stir and grind it, there will never be a time when efficacy appears. Practitioners, failing to understand this, abandon the practice—not out of weariness, but because they deem it a trivial skill unworthy of their effort. Alas! Just as one must ascend from the lowly, how much more so with these martial arts, which are employed to cure illness—when have they ever been relied upon for attaining the Dao? Practitioners, take heed.

A careful note: The ancient sages bequeathed seasonal techniques, condensed into the twelve hours. I now explain the twelve hours as a fixed *qi* configuration for practitioners:

The natural state of *water and moon mutually reflecting* occurs at midnight;
The state of *I am unaware of existence* occurs at the hour of the ox;
The state of *awareness of qi flowing* occurs at the hour of the tiger;
The state of *qi mechanism overflowing* occurs at the hour of the hare;
The work of *abiding in non-being while guarding being* occurs at the hour of the dragon;
The *qi* configuration of *hidden and manifest, unfathomable* occurs at the hour of the snake;
The *qi* configuration of *ten thousand images arrayed* occurs at noon;
The state of *true and illusory, impermanent* occurs at the hour of the sheep;
The method of *sweeping away thoughts as they arise* occurs at the hour of the monkey;
The omen of *the solitary spirit revealed* occurs at the hour of the rooster;
The state of *hearing and seeing suddenly extinguished, awareness without trace* appears only at the hour of the dog;
One must strictly guard against surprise or doubt, abiding in the method of the hour of the dog. The state of *profound stillness* occurs at the hour of the pig.

(Though this is a fixed *qi* configuration, only that which arises naturally is true. Thus, the key is indicated at midnight. Practitioners, follow this single profound instruction, and you will naturally align with it, never deviating midway. Know that the mechanism of *water and moon mutually reflecting* is rooted in profound stillness. When practitioners reach this state of profound stillness, with not a single thought arising, their *qi* becomes utterly pure, and the water and moon naturally appear—this is the *heavenly one generating water*, the image of *kan*. The single line within *kan* is the root of the moon’s appearance. With this essence present, its function naturally manifests—hence it is said to arise naturally.)

The principle is thus, yet it is essential to know that this step arises from the lowest extremity—this is the image of winter. The appearance of water and the rising of the moon are precisely the inner manifestation of *living midnight*, hence it is said that *midnight* holds them. At this time, the practitioner must be as though the body has no body. When one becomes aware of this body’s existence, the *living second* of the human form has already appeared, like heaven possessing earth—this is the image of *Tai* and *Li* in harmonious union. From non-being to being, from emptiness to fullness, this is the natural principle of the Great Dao. Thus it is said: "I am not aware of existence"—this is awareness without attachment. Yet once awareness arises, movement and stillness within must be self-perceived, and one then senses the flowing and circulating flavor of *qi*. However, if one merely embodies awareness within the state of *no hearing, no seeing*, this is the initial manifestation of the *Three Powers*, truly the autumn of *third-hour*. When the *qi*-mechanism overflows, it assumes an outward-penetrating momentum—this is the *living fourth-hour* image of the body. It bears the meaning of hearing and seeing about to commence, reaching *fifth-hour*. Here, the *qi*-mechanism is not without differentiation, yet the ancients placed this thought beyond calculation, treating all that is seen and heard as *having yet not having*. The intent is solely to guard the *hunmu* (primordial undifferentiated) image, preserving all existents within—hence it is called *preserving non-being*. In essence, this is the method of *guarding being*, and thus it is the practice of *fifth-hour*. The so-called method of practice is to preserve all existents within absolute non-being, thereby securing all existents. Yet within this, there are two meanings—hidden and manifest. The ancients’ method here was simply to let it be, without adding the slightest effort of maintenance. Thus, at *sixth-hour*, it is merely called *qi-image*, clarifying the meaning of *no need for effort*. *Seventh-hour* is likewise: the method is simply to let it arrange itself, hence it is summarized with the two words *qi-configuration*. Yet this moment marks the beginning of *living noon* and the generation of *yin*—the image of mid-summer. When the world’s course reaches this point, myriad paths open simultaneously, and the heart and eyes are easily dazzled. As the season wanes, emotions arise spontaneously—this is human nature. The ancients regarded this only as a *qi-configuration*, remaining utterly unmoved within, allowing growth and decline to follow their own course, attributing it to the workings of fate. Their discernment of worldly affairs had already penetrated deeply. Thus, when numinous realms appear, they let them flicker in and out of view, regarding them as mirages or sea markets—this is the *qi*-mechanism of *eighth-hour*. The method is simply to guard one’s true nature, though this is not within the capacity of beginners. Yet the more it manifests, the more wondrous it becomes, with shifting steps and changing shadows that stir the heart and eyes. The method is to sweep away thoughts the moment they arise—this accords with the *living ninth-hour* practice. Once this barrier is broken, inner wisdom-light fills the space, and a sign of *solitary spirit revealed* emerges from turbidity, while the *qi*-mechanism rests in tranquility—this is the state of *tenth-hour*. At this time, the practitioner does not abide in brightness but lets the spirit nest in stillness, thereby attaining a realm of *no hearing, no seeing*, where even the slightest trace is concealed. This true realm may be encountered but not sought; true *yang* is nourished therein, and true *yin* is thereby generated—this is *prior to the image of the Emperor*. Correlating with celestial timing, this is the ninth month of the year, the *living eleventh-hour*. Yet beginners, failing to comprehend, may mistake the cessation of hearing and seeing for the absence of all traces, thereby falling into confusion. The ancients, pitying them, marked this as *orthodox method* and *urgent warning*. If one can guard against regression, one attains *profound stillness* and aligns with heaven in virtue—this is the *living twelfth-hour* method. Thus it is said to occur at *midnight*, which is Laozi’s *"wandering the mind at the origin of things."* The marvelous secret lies in the word *"as"*—the wondrous meaning of *"as"* is the living soul of *"no abiding"* and the complete reflection of the Great Dao. If practitioners can continue cultivation from this word, they will alternately manifest, alternately guard, and alternately advance, advancing without end. They will naturally know that the workings of creation are in their hands, and fate is not in heaven. Practicing sincerely, they may, in a matter of days, race abreast with the ancient immortals.

The foregoing describes precisely the methods by which predecessors condensed years, months, days, hours, and moments, proceeding step by step—such are the numinous realms that manifest. Yet one must grasp them rightly, for the entire practice is complete in its principles. Its great aim lies in *no abiding*, while the essence of this aim depends wholly on the *unmoving* secret. [This secret lies solely in *no abiding* and *unmoving*—if true, practitioners who carefully embody the prior annotations will naturally proceed in perfect accord with the method.]

Thus, when practice reaches *midnight*, the method directs the spirit to focus on the lower *dantian*, while the work must be held as if present, as if forgotten. Suddenly, a single red sun appears, emerging from the center of the heavens within the eyes—initially seen no larger than a bean. [Note carefully: this moon first breaks through from the depths of the lower sea, then rides the central *qi* to ascend to the crown. At this moment, the practitioner’s achievement dissolves the body into no-body, and thus the water-moon appears. Know that the lunar essence still resides in the *Kan* position, its radiance shining upward, where the *qi* of *Qian* congeals it, producing this vision. At this time, the waves of *Kan*-water are serene, and the moon’s reflection is contained within them—hence it is called *mutual illumination*. As for its emanation of light, this occurs because the yang of the liver descends, clinging to the moon and halting its wheel, while the *hun*-soul is impregnated by the moon—this is the cause of the moon’s emission of solar brilliance. Yet the solar essence has not yet risen, still concealed in the depths of the sea. Thereafter, when the sun ascends, it should follow the *Du* meridian; the method requires only that intention be directed backward to achieve this. If, however, it ascends along the central *Ren* meridian, the calamity will be immeasurable.]

Utterly guard against the stirring of thought.

Thereafter, the moon recedes and the sun emerges in full radiance. The method requires only stilling the heart and awaiting this moment. When the *dantian* feels as though cauterized by moxa, this is the effect of the sun bathing in the depths of the sea—thus the entire body becomes suffused with harmony. One then senses the internal *qi* surging from behind, swiftly piercing the *Weilu* and ascending in a soaring current—this is free of harm.

Yet while the sea-bathing has not yet fully penetrated, one must guard against sudden arousal. Otherwise, there will arise an unfathomable peril, its symptoms resembling flowing fire. The remedy lies solely in repeatedly applying the *forgetting* technique until recovery.

The ancient sages, at this stage, subtly shifted their spirit to guide the breakthrough from behind, naturally shattering the barrier and ascending. Once reaching the *Yuzhen* (Jade Pillow), intention is employed to draw it through. For this *Yuzhen*, alchemical texts name it the "Iron Wall," and in the heavens, it is called the "Edge of the Big Dipper’s Handle"—without this true *qi*, none can penetrate it. Only by using this true *qi* to draw and guide it through does one achieve the *Du* meridian’s opening.

When the *Du* is opened, half the work is accomplished. Yet in practicing this method, one must use only the word *draw*—never resort to force. Any admixture of force will result in sounds like thunder or claps of lightning. Should the practitioner, through loss of discipline, encounter such phenomena, they must not be alarmed. [The technique involves clasping the *canghun* mudra with both hands while seated; even if startled, this prevents the peril of spirit-flight.] The method requires only deepening stillness and composure, maintaining it for the duration of half an incense stick’s burning. Then, a drop like a spring will descend from the void. In savoring its essence, one feels profound coolness or extreme sweetness. Whether this descending drop has form is good, but its formlessness is even more wondrous—beyond words.

[It must be understood that this state of stillness, from heightened attention to utter forgetfulness, requires half an incense stick’s time to attain, hence the subsequent phrase "then there is." This clarifies that the *sweet dew* is obtained only through forgetfulness, and such attainment is genuine. At this stage, the work has ascended to the realm of no-body, hence the phrase "from the void," and so on. Yet the practitioner should note that the words "in savoring" do not refer to meaning in the moment but to retrospective reflection after the event. The method at this point—whether from the void, discerning coolness or sweetness, form or formlessness—must be entirely set aside and not dwelled upon, for only then is the work complete. For before the drop descends, one feels only emptiness; when it descends, one naturally senses it falling from the void. Self-awareness at this point is not recklessness, but unawareness of its descent from the void borders on scatteredness—this is not the proper method. Merely adding interpretive meaning risks falling into emotional obstruction, entering the realm of consciousness, which must be guarded against. Thus this annotation is provided.]

The ancient sages called this drop the one that falls directly into the *Jianggong*—this can be swiftly understood.

This is called the *True Yin*. Whether its descent appears gradual or swift, both are acceptable—(the two "also"s here instruct later students to set aside such distinctions, for this is the ancient sages' method of preventing the intrusion of consciousness). Only when the drop falls unimpeded, point by point reaching the heart, is it most rare and precious. (Here one may realize that swiftness is the true sign.)

It is also said: when manifest in form and swift, it is called *Jade Liquid*; when formless and swift, it is called *Golden Liquid*. [This is an esoteric teaching not passed down; I received it in my youth from Master Taixu. Now in my old age, fearing it may be lost forever, I record it here in detail for those with karmic affinity.]

Master Taixu said: "Whether manifest and swift, or formless and gradual, all belong to the wondrous existence—one must recognize the true nature of the method." For when this drop reaches the heart, it is intensely cool; when it passes the heart, it is scorchingly hot, as if scalded by boiling water—only then is it the *True Liquid*. If the drop lacks these qualities, it remains within the postnatal realm, merely moistening the qi mechanism and not to be regarded as the elixir of immortality.

Yet in the moment of practice, one must strictly guard against the arising of conceptual thought. The method lies solely in proceeding step by step, which will yield beneficial effects. The ancient sages' practice encompassed aligning with the four seasons of heaven and the twelve divisions of the year and day. Their method was supremely fluid and profound, for what was discussed earlier—the four seasons and the twelve hours' spiritual realm—is condensed into a single moment. Its circumstances and scenery can indeed be depicted step by step. However, the student must ask: can one truly proceed without attachment, without straying into partiality or fixation?

If one proceeds without attachment, there will be no deviation; if attachment arises, deviation follows, and the manifested circumstances and scenery will differ greatly. How could the ancient sages have been anything but precise in their instructions? Master Taixu said: "If a student, in the midst of practice, clings to a single investigative thought, entertains a single conjecture, or falls into a single moment of consciousness, the incoming circumstances and scenery will shift unpredictably, diverging greatly from the ancient teachings. One should immediately cease practice and rest, waiting until thoughts settle and qi evens. Then resume the current step—or even retreat to an earlier stage—until one re-enters the initial spiritual realm of the first step, experiencing it without duality, before proceeding further. Otherwise, it is better to abandon all previous efforts and begin anew. The ancients' principle that 'practice must attain the mean, and celestial timing must align' refers to condensing the spiritual realm of a year, a month, a day, and an hour, gathering and arranging them in sequence, all manifesting within a single moment—encompassing the four seasons, twelve months, each month with its waxing and waning, thirty days, each day with its twelve hours, and each hour with its natural scenery. The method is supremely profound and true, yet only by stilling the heart, embodying the practice without doubt, and proceeding step by step can one align with the ancient teachings.

Alas! Know that in condensing a year’s scenery into a single moment, the method lies in activating the qi mechanism while quieting the heart and intent—thus naturally conforming to the ancient way. To practice for the duration of an incense stick’s burning is to seize a hundred years of transformation. The ancients therefore called this *the practice of seizing transformation*—difficult yet easy. Students, take heed!"

Originally, in the *zi* and *wu* hours, there is the *living zi* and the *living wu*.

At the year’s two solstices lie the living *zi* and *wu* of Heaven and Earth; the cyclical progression of years, months, days, and hours constitutes their fixed *zi* and *wu*. Considering the human realm, the two solstices of Heaven and Earth, along with the *zi* and *wu* of the cyclical progression of years, months, days, and hours, all belong to the fixed *zi* and *wu*. Only the *zi* and *wu* of these two hours are the living *zi* and *wu* within the human body. Yet even these are but the living *zi* and *wu* reluctantly revealed in alchemical texts—the so-called living *zi* and *wu* of the first stirring of yang. To discern their true essence, one must seek deeper still. The genuine living *zi* and *wu* must be pursued where form and image dissolve.

What then is the method? When practice reaches the point of stillness beyond stillness, one suddenly senses an inner mechanism stirring faintly—this marks the inception of the living *zi*. As the stirring grows vigorous, the living *zi* manifests in full; when qi wells up within and surges toward the male root, the living *zi*’s inner qi reaches fullness. The method employs the celestial eye to concentrate, guiding the qi to ascend the Governor Vessel in reverse to Kunlun. With a subtle intent to retain it, one feels the marrow sea’s waves settle, and the qi flows downward, generating a breeze in the Flower Pool that gathers at the Crimson Palace. At this moment, the Celestial Lord is at peace, and all realms are tranquil—this is called "drawing from Kan to fill Li."

Should the external kidneys rise and thoughts arise simultaneously, the external kidneys will surge further. The ancient sages swiftly guide the qi back with intent, reversing its course from the sea bottom to the crown, storing it in the Qian cauldron—neither forgetting nor forcing. As qi is nurtured by marrow, it transforms into jade dew, flowing naturally into the pool and descending to the Quepen. When the dew is retained in the basin, it transmutes into crimson fluid, streaming behind the heart. There, it meets the ascending yang of Kan, yielding a profound, spring-like savor. Yet one must merely comprehend this, strictly guarding against emotional entanglement. Should the heart stir, swiftly direct the true qi of the Qian palace downward to suppress it, instantly restoring clarity. Alternatively, envelop the phenomenon with intent and press it into the lower field, refining it thoroughly before guiding it to ascend the crown and store it in the Niwan, engaging in a grand purification—this "purification" means placing all perceptions and sensations beyond the reach of intent.

Thereafter, as the Flower Pool’s fluid surges, swallow it repeatedly, sensing the Crimson Palace gleam with golden splendor, expanding boundlessly. A mirage-like vision appears, shifting between near and far. Here, the practitioner first recognizes that the work of nature is the fortress preserving life. The method lies in setting it aside without attachment; otherwise, lascivious scenes may arise, unsettling the heart and will. Instead, envelop and gather it with intent, then dismiss it without scrutiny, swiftly directing the gaze and hearing into a state of no-seeing and no-hearing. In this act of preservation, one enters a realm where the self and world dissolve.

Once more, one perceives a misty, vaporous atmosphere emerging within profound stillness. Again, set it aside without interference, and one attains the state where both self and dharma are forgotten. At this stage, should a sense of the body arise, direct intent to examine the aperture within the aperture and halt. Alchemical texts call this "gathering the medicine into the furnace" or "practicing the living *zi* work"—such is its effect.

Yet alchemical texts often speak in metaphors, employing broad analogies without direct exposition, as if their intent were not fully conveyed. How could the verification of the living *wu* not be encompassed within the discourse on the living *zi*? This is because the ancient sages taught by guiding rather than explaining. Nevertheless, such ambiguity risks misdirection. Out of compassion, Tai Xu here reiterates the awakening secrets, wherein the work of gathering, extracting, refining, and congealing is inherently complete.

If one follows the alchemical texts, the external kidneys rise without thought—this is indeed the living *zi*’s yang arising. Yet one must further guide and draw it to the brain, retaining it there before directing it to the Central Yellow to commence gathering. Employing the "no-thought" technique once more, seal the furnace. Compared to other teachings, this method simplifies the process, yet the explanation merely completes the living *zi*’s work—it is incomplete. The alchemical texts’ account of what follows the living *zi* is left for practitioners to discern, but they often cling to a single interpretation, growing increasingly confused and ultimately sighing in despair. Yet this too reflects the ancient sages’ own journey; they never anticipated later students’ lack of insight, nor the pitfalls of over-interpretation. Moved by compassion, Tai Xu now offers this revelation.

What is called the living *wu* is, in essence, the continuation of the ancient sages’ work after the living *zi*—it is not a separate path. The ancient sages’ practice began with the living *zi*, whereas Tai Xu’s teaching emphasizes the living *wu*, introducing the "Twelve Hours of the Central Work." When the golden world manifests, this is the supreme realm of the living *wu*, where the work of gathering is appropriate. The gathering method employs the *Qingjing Jing*’s threefold contemplation. The highest practice involves engaging with the formless, yet without abiding in emptiness. Upon returning, one still rests in the formless, cycling thus until qi gathers into form and disperses into qi.

Some aspects of this method may be disclosed, yet one must grasp and embody it inwardly, holding it in secrecy—like seeking a steed with a diagram, or catching a fish and forgetting the trap. What then is the principle? Upon witnessing the golden world, swiftly rise with the supreme spiritual qi from behind, extending to the utmost height and distance, where light does not reach, and descend. Envelop the spiritual realm entirely, condensing it into a millet grain, either drawing it in through the precious vase or gathering it into the abdomen with intent. Alternatively, harnessing the enveloping force, sweep from the farthest point before oneself to the deepest below, ascending to the highest above, gazing down upon the spiritual realm where one’s colored body sits or stands within flames. Swiftly apply the "forgetting heat" technique, and the colored body melts away, revealing only radiance. With intent, gather and contract it, and a pea-sized pearl appears, suspended in the void.

Swiftly gather with intent, settling it within the serene and mysterious aperture of emptiness and quiescence, whereupon one attains a state of profound clarity, stillness, and mystery—here, let it rest.

Alternatively, when the spiritual realm manifests, gently employ true intent to draw this realm toward the rear of the body. Silently apply the "lifting" technique, raising it from behind, and with both eyes, gaze upward to the *niwan* (mud-pellet palace). Sense the true qi of one’s *niwan* suffusing and swirling. Then, with intent, guide it downward, feeling the qi overflowing a realm—vaguely beholding a pool of brimming water. This marks arrival at the *Huachi* (Flowery Pond), where jade-like and golden fluids abundantly flow. Swallow them, descending through the *Chonglou* (Weighty Tower) to the *Jianggong* (Crimson Palace), where supreme coolness is naturally attained. Proceeding further downward to the *Zhonghuang* (Central Yellow), another realm of delight unfolds, suffusing the entire body with harmony.

At this moment, one senses two qi spiraling left and right. Another qi ascends, while another descends. Once their tips align precisely, they rise to meet and descend to welcome, now chasing, now retreating, now intertwining without release. At this juncture, strictly guard against attachment and mundane thoughts. Should even a trace of emotion arise, these two qi will wage a fierce battle of engulfment, and the three families, once refined beyond the posterior heaven, will cause the body to tremble, breath to roughen, and the external kidneys to burn with fire—ushering in an ordeal nearly impossible to renew.

The remedy lies solely in raising both eyes upward to draw down true yin, suppressing the flames of emotion. Yet this supreme treasure has already transformed into the posterior heaven. The method requires summoning the true person in utmost urgency, fiercely refining and forging it anew, compelling it to once more penetrate the *Weilü* (Tail Gate), ascend to the *Niwan*, descend again through the *Chonglou* to the *Jiangque* (Crimson Palace), thereby attaining a grand renewal. Otherwise, this treasure cannot be restored. Thus, the ancients dared not disclose this stage, for few practitioners retain the purity of youth. Once the passions of the body are breached, how can one avoid stirring emotional thoughts when the work reaches this point? Moreover, this path is well-trodden—escaping its grasp without seizing the pass is exceedingly difficult.

Only those of unblemished youth, whose treasure remains unopened and who know nothing of this matter, when practicing to this stage, will merely sense the great spring of life, their spiritual mechanism ascending without descending—utterly free from such transformations. The ancients, with their pure and thorough cultivation of inherent nature, upon reaching this stage, swiftly drew true yin to suppress the turbid fire, relying on the coolness of the *Jianggong* to transform the qi, condensing it downward and storing it in the *qi* cavity. With intent, they sealed it, abiding in profound stillness for a moment before ceasing.

Generally, for those whose practice begins with the *huowu* (living noon), the *Qian* (Heavenly) palace is the most critical work. Refine this qi mechanism, directing it downward to the *Huachi*, irrigating the *Jianggong*. When the *huozi* (living midnight) arrives, rely solely on spiritual discernment. The union of *zi* and *wu* depends on the tranquility of inherent nature, with the work culminating in renewal as the proper measure.

For those whose practice begins with the *huozi* (living midnight), the *Kun* (Earthly) abdomen is the most critical work. Refine this fluid-qi, ascending it to the *Niwan*, descending it to the *Huachi*, and purifying the *Jianggong*. When the *huowu* (living noon) arrives, strictly guard against leakage of emotion. The union of *wu* and *zi* also depends on the tranquility of inherent nature, culminating in harmony as the proper measure.

When closing the eyes for inner observation, myriad spiritual realms may manifest—here, the method values non-attachment. As one advances step by step, the scenery shifts with each movement, and the realms are beyond enumeration. The method lies solely in non-abiding.

Upon the qi reaching the *Kun* position, warmth is the sign of achievement. When the qi subsequently penetrates to the crown and *Jianggong*, coolness is the sign of achievement. Such is the general principle. Only those who merge inner observation into oneness, embodying the spirit in its entirety, practice the method of celestial immortals—let the capable follow it. (The "two" refer to the two eyes; the "one" is the celestial eye.)

Master Taixu said: In our cultivation, it is indeed vital to harmonize with celestial timing. Yet the preceding discussion of *huowu* is because, without clarity on *huowu*, true yin is lost in vain. Even if one engages in *huozi*, without true yin to contain it, the work may refine the spirit, but its ascent cannot be assured. The elixir texts speak of coolness, gold, and jade, alluding to the work following *huozi*, hence the term "true yin." This refers to refining yang to obtain yin, yet within it lies the secret of refining yin to obtain yang—a method not omitted but simply not spoken aloud.

As for the twelve-hour secrets, the ancients guarded them closely. I now reveal them openly, for the true Dao has long been obscured, and practitioners often merely follow traces without understanding the landmarks of the journey. Proceeding without guidance is like a blind man without a staff—prone to confusion and retreat. Moreover, knowing your karmic affinity is profound and your capacity for selflessness great, if I withhold this method, this gathering would be in vain, and the true Dao would be lost.

Should one of great root and capacity encounter you and learn the twelve-hour secrets, inquiring into the *huosui* (living year), *huoyue* (living month), *huori* (living day), and *huoshi* (living hour), and practice them with precision, even if later interrupted by affairs, upon resuming the work, they will know the steps and the scenery to expect, proceeding without doubt or hesitation. Thus, they will advance unimpeded. To have previously heard of the *huosui*, *huoyue*, *huori*, and *huoshi* and now see them clearly—is this not a joyous matter?

This living principle cannot be grasped through effortful action, yet it is often lost in effortless non-action. Only those who comprehend the meaning of "employing the effortless within effort, practicing the effortful within non-action" will never err, and their attainment will surely be genuine.

Why not verify this with the elixir classics? "When the external kidneys rise without thought, it is yang arising," and it is also called "living midnight." From this, one may realize: "When the external kidneys rise greatly without thought, it coincides with the living noon within the body." Only then should one proceed with gathering—otherwise, what is obtained is not true yang. Using it for nourishing life may suffice, but relying on it to attain the Dao—is this not difficult?

Here the learner remains ignorant of the initial stirrings and first appearances of the inner mechanism, failing to nurture yang at its earliest resurgence. Waiting until the living noon to gather it, they ultimately err in their approach—unaware of the ancient sages’ "contraction" formula, still clinging to fixed midnight timing. Thus they err without realizing, and even if they apply effort according to instruction, they have already fallen into mid-course error.

Those timid and rigid in their views may even abandon the effort entirely, believing the yang of an overripe hour cannot be gathered. Little do they know this is still the waxing moon of true noon—discarding it is but another error compounded upon error.

Alas! To heedlessly squander the living noon is to miss the great pivot of Dao cultivation. Without thorough understanding of its nature, one will err ten times in ten encounters. Reviewing the refined practices of past masters, I find that while they often succeeded at the living midnight, their failures invariably occurred at the living noon. Why? Because their nature-work was insufficient, and nature was swayed by emotion.

*(Note: The error is not merely in losing control when numinous visions appear. Learners commonly falter when stray thoughts suddenly arise. For when thoughts surge like clouds during meditation, this is precisely the verification that the living noon has arrived within the body. To abandon the sitting, or to sit without restraint, or to restrain without settling—all are failures of preservation.)*

At the moment of true noon, myriad paths open simultaneously—nothing wondrous fails to appear, no subtlety remains hidden. All that belongs to the domain of destiny manifests without concealment. Generally, those with sufficient life-cultivation will witness ever more exquisite marvels. *(The ancient sages, endowed with self-knowing clarity, would half-lower their inner curtains at noon during practice. Though they had eyes, they acted as if sightless, relying solely on spiritual resonance to harmonize the qi mechanism, returning it to a state of pure harmony until the qi found its hidden abode and came to rest.)* Their experiences were not merely sounds or colors: above, celestial palaces of jade towers and rosy pavilions; in the middle realm, jade maidens and golden youths, rare flowers and sacred herbs—countless wonders. Even in the lower visions, one would encounter famous mountains and scenic lands, or be presented with celestial maidens and immortal feasts. Even the most modest numinous realms transcended the mundane, with such beauty in figures and such refinement in furnishings that one could easily be captivated.

Should emotion cling even slightly, one becomes mired and unable to transcend, delaying ascent and verification—like lingering in Tuṣita Heaven. Next, the spirit stagnates in the Mud Pill Palace, and the hope of rebirth vanishes. Worse still, if one abandons the practice to demonic occupation, the spirit may be devoured—all due to ignorance of the living noon’s functional secrets.

Master Taixu further said: When practice reaches the stage where true and illusory are indistinguishable, even if the hour is not yet noon, one may, by rousing the qi and will and applying concentrated stabilization, restore the living noon within half an incense’s time. A golden world then appears, illuminating the mind’s eye—this is the technique of Li Shaojun, who achieved a second noon at the hour of *rize*. The medicinal substance is most abundant then; gathered with intention, it transforms into true qi. Further condensed with intention and drawn into the ancestral aperture, this is called "obtaining the medicine"—the great accomplishment of the Southern Lineage’s patriarchs. The Prince of Huainan, Wei Boyang, and the two Perfected Ones Ge and Xu, through additional practices like *baoti* and other formulas, ascended bodily into immortality.

My teacher, Master Mud Pill, practiced without attachment, and I too have personally verified the six celestial tremors. The Master cautioned: "Do not practice this to completion. You should treasure and conceal it, awaiting the right person to transmit it to."

If, however, one’s practice reveals collapsing walls and ruined houses—various signs of decay—this indicates the learner’s yang is waning and yin is damaged. The method then is to venerate the true in every thought, align every action with proper measure, focus on preserving the Gate of Life, and combine emptiness of mind with fullness of the abdomen. Above all, guard against the arising of anxious or evil thoughts—this too is an oral formula from the ancient sages for entering practice through the living noon.

The Master further said: In our cultivation, we must follow the ancient sages and buddhas—refining nature in activity and life in stillness. Do not be like worldly learners who apply effort only during cross-legged sitting. Such practitioners invariably fail ten out of ten times, whereas the ancients succeeded a hundred times in a hundred attempts. I urge learners to begin by equating the body with empty space, using the vastness of heaven and earth as the Dharmakāya, this physical form as the divine chamber of the celestial heart, and this fleshly heart as the sovereign of the celestial heart. Let there be no preferences, no grasping or rejecting, no seeking or avoiding—no entanglements whatsoever, no wandering thoughts. Only maintain a state of utter emptiness, neither bright nor dark, what is called "vast and boundless, neither partial nor biased." Upright in body, empty in mind, sincere in thought—only then will you not waste this precious opportunity. When practice reaches the living midnight, do not fail to nurture it; when it reaches the living noon, master the formula for gathering and containing.

Alas! If this body is not liberated in this lifetime, in what future life will it be liberated? The ancient sages said: "When the front barrier is closed, subdue the heart and qi—success comes from summer and autumn practice." They also said: "When the rear barrier is opened, half the work is done—the true practice is contracting *gen* and opening *qian*."

Know that qi fails to ascend posteriorly because of congealed essence blocking the channels and apertures. The method is to direct the spirit to the Kun abdomen and return the qi to the Gate of Life. When the fire is vigorous, the qi becomes warm; congealed essence, meeting warmth, melts like water. Channels and apertures are no longer obstructed, and the qi naturally penetrates posteriorly.

Originally, qi circulates through the channels; if channels are blocked, qi stagnates. Know that the substance blocking the channels is the very essence that once coursed through them under qi’s guidance. Thus, qi’s failure to ascend stems from stagnation within essence; stagnation within essence arises from insufficient warmth in qi; qi’s lack of warmth stems from decline in the Gate of Life; decline in the Gate of Life’s fire stems from the spirit’s failure to guard it. For essence moves by means of qi, and qi is warmed by the spirit. When the spirit flourishes, qi is warm; when the spirit wanes, qi cools. Cool qi causes essence to congeal and fail to transform, internally becoming phlegm that fills the meridians and obstructs the apertures.

The consequences of this are dire: not only does the great Dao become difficult to practice, but even one’s life may scarcely be preserved. The only remedy lies in intensely warming the earthly abdomen to reverse the condition.

Know that essence, as a substance, when guided by flourishing qi, moves like clouds borne on dry winds—ascending to form rosy dawn, descending as gentle dew. Yet when guided by declining qi, it becomes like mist carried on damp winds, forming stagnant clouds that descend as heavy rain. Moreover, when this yin essence flows downward and lingers in the bladder, an occasional flare of ministerial fire may cause it to seep outward in an oily discharge—this is the gravest harm of stagnation below. If, however, it is guided by channel qi and dispersed throughout the hundred vessels, a single drying by wind-fire may transform it into abscesses or paralysis. Over time, it may accumulate and generate fire, leading to bone steaming; the consumptive ailments of the world all arise from this substance.

The sages of old feared this, hence their teachings on cultivating fire. The method of cultivating fire lies solely in focusing the mind on the earthly abdomen and returning qi to the Gate of Life. The fire of the Gate of Life is invisible to the eye, yet its presence is tangible—it is the root of the spirit-fire. When the fire of the Gate of Life flourishes, the essence of food and drink can be transformed into qi. Further, by directing intention to the earthly abdomen, dryness is nurtured into true earth, while moisture nourishes the hundred bones, invigorates the qi mechanism, and sustains the thunderous yang. The function of true fire is indeed vast!

In our daily lives, as food and drink are transformed day by day, we often neglect the teaching of cultivating fire. Thus, among the hundred vessels, few escape affliction, and in the bladder, this substance accumulates in abundance. Yin fails to transform yang, and the consequences unfold as described above—how can one remain unaware of where to direct their focus? If qi fails to ascend posteriorly, disaster is not far off. Moreover, if qi does not ascend posteriorly, it will inevitably rise anteriorly; should qi penetrate forward, the harm is even greater. (At best, it manifests as liver qi surging; at worst, as leg qi rushing upward.) The onset of illness invariably occurs in spring; spring outbreaks are manageable, but summer outbreaks are severe.

For this phlegm-like essence first obstructs the central palace, blocking qi from descending. Occasionally, some may follow qi downward, but with the Gate of Life’s fire weakened, the descending substance congeals below. When the coccyx point is obstructed, the governing and conception vessels along the spine, crown, and occiput become equally blocked—both the Ren and Du channels are sealed, and the calamity is beyond measure.

To remedy and reverse this, the method must combine the restraint of the Gen technique, gathering the ministers to assist and cultivate. Only then will the true fire of the Gate of Life flourish, warming and steaming the middle and lower regions. Yin essence will daily melt away, and true qi will grow in power, breaking through blockages and unobstructing the channels. Practicing thus for one seven-day period, then two, up to seven seven-day periods without interruption, the stagnations before and behind will dissolve, and the Ren and Du channels will open. Not only will illness be cured, but more shall be achieved.

Yet if one merely seeks to unblock without cultivating and assisting, the old stagnant sludge will remain in the vessels and apertures. Temporary relief may occur, but the root cause—weak yang, feeble qi, and the difficulty of rousing oneself—will persist. Deep-seated habits are hard to reverse, and this is the lamentable outcome. We, as aspiring scholars, must take heed and strictly avoid this.

Once the qi mechanism is unblocked, yin essence transformed, and chronic ailments resolved, one may proceed to the threefold practice of cultivation. Within this, there are further techniques:

From midnight to noon, the practice should involve raising the buttocks, bowing the body, straightening the neck, and contracting the Gen. Perform twenty-four breaths. Then, draw upward to the Qian position, visualize the spirit in the mud pill, and hold for six breaths without exhaling. Straighten the body, relax the abdomen, and sit with six breaths. In total, perform thirty-six breaths, repeating this cycle for six periods.

From noon to midnight, the practice should involve pressing the abdomen, straightening the waist, lifting the neck, and emptying the heart. Perform sixteen breaths. Then, visualize the spirit in the earthly abdomen for four breaths, and as before, straighten the body, with each breath returning to the navel for four breaths. In total, perform twenty-four breaths, repeating this cycle for six periods.

The sages have said: “From midnight to noon, one should advance the yang fire; when yang flourishes, it ascends, and when it ascends, the mechanism is lively. From noon to midnight, one should retreat the yin tally; when yin melts, it descends, and when it descends, stagnation dissolves.” They also said: “The head is the Qian cauldron, the heart the chamber of spirit, and the abdomen the Kun furnace. The heart is the palace storing qi, the abdomen the palace where life and nature converge, the land where medicine is born. The heart should be empty, the abdomen full. If the heart is not empty, thoughts scatter and qi becomes chaotic; old accumulations fail to transform below, congealing into phlegm-rheum. If the abdomen is not full, qi is deficient and stagnant; fluids and essence fail to melt, congealing into seminal leakage.” Let the learner take note.

Why must the body be upright? Know that for the Ren and Du channels, if the body is not upright, the qi mechanism becomes obstructed; when the body is upright, the qi mechanism flows unimpeded, and the hundred vessels are free. This is no minor matter.

However, when first practicing this technique, qi may not descend easily, often causing counterflow or surging, or sensations of distension, stagnation, or soreness in the front or back of the body. These arise from residual sludge in the vessels that has not yet dissolved, as channel qi penetrates and rushes through. Such discomfort is a sign of unblocking. One must urgently apply the technique of raising the buttocks to press the Du channel, and empty the heart while filling the abdomen to press the Ren channel. Once the Ren and Du are fully open, previous afflictions will naturally resolve.

After the Ren and Du channels are open, aside from the major methods of circulation and absorption practiced during the midnight and noon periods, one must, after obtaining the medicine, continue the techniques of raising the buttocks and emptying the heart, incorporating the upright practice to refine and nourish. With three years of practice, success will be achieved.

Why must the heart be emptied? If the heart is not empty, qi and spirit scatter with thoughts, principles lose their order, and practice lacks coherence—success is difficult. When the heart is empty, qi unifies, and even if stagnation remains, qi will dissolve it upon arrival. The practice becomes effective, and further subtleties reside within.

If one practices the technique of unblocking the Ren channel, upon completion, one must perform the technique of relaxing the abdomen and settling the spirit. Without this, there is a risk of yang sinking into yin, leading to dullness and torpor.

Those who master this technique will find their qi settled and spirit clear. At this juncture, one must also attain the singular practice of "a single spirit revealed." Without this, ascent becomes mixed with turbidity, often leading to distended brain, reddened eyes, restlessness, and stirred thoughts—invoking the thunderous yang and risking the peril of "thunderclap spirit-flight." With this technique in place, such afflictions are entirely avoided. Even if slight distension or dizziness arises, applying the methods of emptiness, relaxation, and unobstructed flow will resolve it instantly. The subtleties of this phrase are beyond description!

Master Taixu further states: After a full meal, one must strictly avoid abruptly performing the technique of relaxing the abdomen; the method lies solely in emptying the heart. Once the food has settled somewhat, one should only maintain spirit within the heart and abdomen, avoiding vigorous practice—the method is to walk slowly while gently caressing the abdomen. Only after digestion is complete may one engage in martial practice.

The ancients said: "After eating, practice with civility," and also: "After eating, add emptiness of heart—with an empty heart, food digests easily." For humans, food is paramount, yet the root of illness often lies in stagnant food within the central palace, transforming into phlegm and rheum, giving rise to conditions like regurgitation. Practicing vigorously after eating causes grain to follow qi downward, stagnating in the lower extreme—this is the origin of anal abscesses and hemorrhoids. When turbid qi stagnates in the channels, it leads to paralysis and other ailments. If this substance adheres to the joints and bones over time, it generates fire, eventually causing consumptive diseases like bone steaming. The "civility" of the ancients refers to maintaining spirit in the central palace and directing intention to the Gate of Life. If one forcibly relaxes the abdomen, the practice becomes martial, which only invites illness—hence the prohibition.

What is the method of emptying the heart? It is simply to relax the qi mechanism. Walking slowly aids the spleen in transforming food, while caressing the abdomen gathers and returns grain qi, guiding it to be refined by fire into qi. Once the food is digested, one must add the practice of "contracting Gen." What is the method of contracting Gen? It is akin to restraining the urge to defecate or urinate, preventing grain qi from stagnating externally while also ensuring it does not descend and stagnate below. For this substance, the pure aspect ascends with qi to transform into blood, dispersing and filling the hundred channels; the turbid aspect descends with qi to moisten the intestines and stomach. If spirit is not properly regulated, it readily congeals into yin fluids, bringing harm to the entire body. Thus, the ancients paid particular attention to this in three ways.

When one maintains spirit in the central palace and senses fullness and distension in the chest, respectfully guide intention to descend from the right side of the chest, circling around the navel wheel, then ascending from the left to encircle the navel and descend on the right—this is the "Retreat Yin Talisman." Since grain qi is overly abundant, one must employ the retreat method. Once slightly relaxed, cease the practice and simply apply the method of emptiness of heart, naturally attaining a sense of release. Gradually, one perceives a misty, vaporous phenomenon before the eyes—this is the initial effect of grain qi steaming. Next, this scene pervades the entire body, indicating that grain qi is riding the central qi to circulate throughout—this is the effect of its flow within. Eventually, the chest and diaphragm feel clear, though the abdomen remains full.

At this point, the food has descended, and one may add the practices of left, center, and right circulation. Carefully follow this method: align the body with nasal breathing—inhale left, then left; inhale center, then center; inhale right, then right. The principle is exquisitely subtle, yet the practice remains civil. The ancients, though not explicitly explaining the mechanism, simply instructed to follow the method in circulation.

[The ancient method relies on the qi of nasal breathing, moving left or right as it exits. However, the nose has only two nostrils—how can there be a "center" exit? The "center" refers to when both nostrils exhale simultaneously, forming the central qi. Human nasal breathing aligns with celestial timing, a truth long verified. The ancient method does not deceive: the cycle of exhalation and inhalation follows the twelve earthly branches—*zi* left, *chou* right, *yin* left, *mao* right—alternating precisely without deviation. At the transition between two hours, both nostrils exhale together. The count of exhalations increases notably at *zi* and *wu*, while other times are roughly similar.

In the circulation method: when qi exits the left nostril, descend from the left side of the chest, circle the abdomen to the right, then push inward at approximately two *cun* above the navel, directly attaching to the Gate of Life—this is called "Advancing Yang Fire." For those deficient in yang, perform up to thirty-six rotations. When qi exits the right nostril, descend from the right side of the chest, circle the abdomen to the left, then push inward at approximately two *cun* above the navel, reaching the lower field without attaching to the Gate of Life—this is called "Retreating Yin Talisman." For those deficient in yin, perform up to twenty-four rotations. When both nostrils exhale together as central qi, proceed straight from the Crimson Palace to the Central Yellow, rotating left thirty-six times and right twenty-four times around the navel wheel, then push inward at approximately two *cun* above the navel, entering the mysterious aperture. Remain thoughtless for a moment—this is called "Sealing the Crucible."

Practicing this method in accordance with the twelve hours without interruption is a great secret technique.]

If one inadvertently enters the *tun* and *meng* qi phase, this signals the spirit’s journey to the Water Palace. At this moment, the practitioner must swiftly apply the "Clear Emptiness" technique, further directing spirit to the Kun abdomen while employing the contraction of Gen—this will ignite the fire of the lower field. When the upper and central qi respond, strictly avoid premature ascent. The practice must continue its descent, aiding qi to press forward. Once the barrier is broken and transcended, qi surges up the spine, passes through the pillow, and ascends. After lingering for a moment, it naturally descends to the Flowery Pond. At this time, double the effort to still the heart, and one will surely receive a copious outpouring of sweet dew, filling the mouth to be swallowed in portions. The Crimson Palace feels as though true qi has congealed. Then, proceed with the "Forgetting" technique, attaining the wonder of a body without substance. Suddenly, one senses a drop descending from the void, straight into the heart—only an immense coolness is felt. Then, it descends further into the Central Yellow, evoking extreme warmth and moisture, as if spring pervades the entire body. This signifies that grain qi has transformed into the supreme treasure.

At this moment, the method lies solely in silently awaiting the state of "not knowing, not perceiving"—this is called "receiving the treasure and returning to the furnace," and in alchemical texts, it is termed *"Treasure Returns to Chaos."* For all practitioners, before reaching the stage of grain avoidance, how could this phase of cultivation be neglected? For herein lies the attainment of achievement—and herein, too, lies the risk of calamity.

Why must the initial step of Dao cultivation begin with the technique of *"making the self equal to the void"*? Because this void is the fundamental substance of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate realization of one’s own body. By employing this true image as the starting point, all subsequent methods and techniques will align with the Dao. Those who conduct themselves with utmost care, modeling their every action after Heaven and Earth, ultimately refine their practice by expanding their qi mechanism. Only when the qi mechanism is expansive can there be no stagnation within; then, one may take the body as lead, the heart as mercury, stillness as water, and wisdom as fire—without encountering the slightest difficulty.

Moreover, the void within the body corresponds to Heaven, while the solid corresponds to Earth. The heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys within are none other than essence, spirit, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent. In the realm of Heaven and Earth, they manifest as metal, wood, water, fire, and earth; in the Dao, they become benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust. Their functions serve but to remedy deficiencies and correct imbalances, yet all ultimately fall within the two principles of stillness and wisdom.

Some claim that stillness is the substance of the Dao, while wisdom is its function—this view appears plausible but is mistaken. For stillness is spoken of in contrast to restlessness, just as wisdom is contrasted with ignorance. In their profound meaning, both stillness and wisdom belong to the *function* of the Dao. The Dao as Dao is naturally pure and unified, yet encompasses the myriad existences; it spans past and present, appearing as if utterly quiescent and devoid of form—comparable to the Supreme Ultimate.

Responding to phenomena as they arise is the meaning of wisdom; not being carried away as they depart is the meaning of stillness—yet only the sage can achieve this. For us practitioners, we strive to approximate such mastery: at first, it is difficult; then, it becomes possible; finally, it becomes spontaneous.

The method of cultivation is nothing other than self-mastery. The practice of self-mastery lies in: when at rest, purifying the constant; when in action, purifying the changing. My teacher, the Venerable Tai Xu, said: *"If one takes the void as the Dharma-body yet fails to regard the physical body as the divine chamber of the Heavenly Heart, one falls into the emptiness of reckless nihilism, lacking any governing principle—this is the path of heterodoxy. Thus, the ancient sages invariably followed this technique with another, fearing the descent into the lifeless heterodoxy of non-sentience, and so further designated the fleshly heart as the heart of the Heavenly Heart."*

For the Heavenly Heart is never obscured, ever perfectly pure and awakened; thus, it responds to all things without bias, yet arises entirely from spontaneity. The qi mechanism naturally flourishes, and by following this, one engages in the alchemy of body and heart, lead and mercury, stillness and wisdom, water and fire—beyond this thought, no other thought intrudes. This is what is meant by *"no-thought within thought."* If one were to eliminate even this thought, it would be like boiling an empty cauldron with water and fire—this is the lifeless heterodoxy of non-sentience. Those who aspire to the rank of Heavenly Immortal must jointly investigate this.

The ancient sages began with *"non-delusion"* as their entry point. For us practitioners, we provisionally employ stillness and wisdom as distinct methods. The practice likewise begins with non-delusion: taking non-delusion as stillness, and the arising of delusion as the occasion for its eradication as wisdom. The stages proceed thus: first, eliminating coarse delusion; then, subtle delusion; finally, the delusion within non-delusion—culminating in natural purity and perfect completion.

First, establish this true thought as the seed of one’s Heavenly Heart—this is called *"directly refining the upper barrier."* For now, set aside concerns about *"conceiving the embryo, nurturing the embryo, and shedding the embryo,"* for these terms, as used by the ancient sages, contain profound meanings. They serve merely to delineate the stages in detail, preventing the error of skipping steps or hasty progression. The ultimate aim is nothing other than *"eliminating delusion and preserving the real."* The method of practice is simply *"using one to eliminate the myriad."*

The method of practice proceeds from the shallow to the deep. By tracing names to their realities, refining further and further, and verifying the subtle with the subtle, its ultimate manifestation culminates in *"non-abiding."* Yet this *"non-abiding"* is the very principle that sustains one from beginning to end. The true seed within the bow lies in *nature* as its essence and *life* as its function. Concentrate and preserve it, fuse it into oneness, refine it with spirit, and through deep cultivation, merge directly with the unmanifested origin—then there is no duality. With this Dao-body, its function becomes wondrous of itself. Yet how could this not begin and end with *"non-delusion"*?

This was the earnest intent behind the ancient sages' establishment of names and terms. Alas, later students failed to comprehend, instead clinging to delusion and fostering all manner of perverse views, leading them astray. Only those who grasp this principle may take up the alchemical texts to affirm and verify; otherwise, it is better to leave them untouched upon the high shelf.
