The Pure Yang Patriarch of the Lǚ Dòngbīn Alchemical Dao
Annotated by Fù Jīnquán of the [Qing] Dynasty

I. *The Yellow Crane Rhapsody*

Profound indeed! The supreme vehicle is that of non-action and non-striving.
The Reverted Elixir’s sevenfold return arises only when movement yields to stillness.

[Annotation: The Dao is divided into three vehicles: the initial, the intermediate, and the supreme. Upon reaching the supreme vehicle, there is nothing to be done. From the Three Passes, one reverses course—upon the thunderous departure from the womb, returning once more to the origin of the first year—where sound and scent dissolve entirely, and vastness merges with the Great Void. Should the true face of *qián*-Primordial ever emerge, the Buddhists call this the realization of true suchness, thereby revealing that the initial and intermediate vehicles necessarily involve action.
The Reverted Elixir is the elixir that was originally one’s own. *Reversion* signifies returning from without to within, from the other back to the self, a departure that reverts, a loss that is regained. Seven is the complete number of fire; yang’s movement reaches its extreme and turns to stillness, while yin’s stillness reaches its extreme and turns to movement. Movement and stillness propel one another, each serving as the root of the other. The art of elixir refinement lies in seeking the impulse of movement within the depths of stillness. As Master Shào said: “Between one movement and one stillness lies the utmost subtlety of heaven, earth, and humanity.”]

The superior virtue preserves form through the Dao, for it is the unbroken *qián*-Primordial.
The lesser virtue extends life through technique, for it is the *kǎn*-Abyssal already formed.

[Annotation: The *Dao De Jing* states: “Superior virtue does not act as virtue; lesser virtue does not lose virtue.” The immortal teachings say: “Form is preserved through the Dao; life is extended through technique.” One must first possess the technique to connect with life before attaining the Dao to preserve form. The unbroken *qián*-Primordial is the undefiled body of a virgin child. Should one encounter a sagely master, no foundational work of life-connecting is needed—one may proceed directly to the ten-month practice. Yet such an occurrence is rare across kalpas. Should one expend even a single drop of essence, the body becomes leaky.
For those in whom the *kǎn*-Abyssal is already formed, one must first undertake the hundred-day practice of refining essence into *qi*, followed by the ten-month gestation.]

Thus, the Dao of yin and yang is employed, relying on worldly methods for cultivation.
The method of transcending the world imitates the procreation of man and woman, yet it must awaken the celestial mechanism to discharge the celestial mechanism.

[Annotation: The *Book of Changes* states: “The alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.” *The Rootless Tree* says: “Apart from the Dao of yin and yang, nothing is complete.” This Dao necessarily pairs yin and yang, uniting water and fire. People see those who enter mountains to dwell in stillness, abstaining from marriage and office, and assume this is the way of cultivation. Yet the Dao resides among humanity, not within mountains. The Buddha said: “I cultivated the Way in the five turbid evil worlds and attained the Great Dao.” One seeks to transcend the world through cultivation, yet the method of transcendence is sought within worldly methods. The so-called worldly methods are the everyday affairs of ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife, elder and younger brothers, and friends. Human procreation gives birth to sons and daughters; the elixir-refiner emulates this. Ancestor Zhāng Sānfēng said: “Following the birth of people, one reverses to birth the elixir.” A single phrase surpasses countless thousands—no more talk of desiccated sitting in quiescent non-action.
The *celestial mechanism* is the celestial root. Only by awakening the celestial root can one penetrate and discharge this celestial mechanism.]

To cultivate both nature and life in tandem, one must rely on the dual application of method and wealth.

[Annotation: Without life, nature cannot stand; without nature, life cannot be complete. Initially, one cultivates life through nature; ultimately, one completes nature through life. From beginning to end, this is merely the full realization of the two characters *nature* and *life*—necessarily cultivated together, never singly. The Ancestor did not say: “Cultivating only nature without life is like adorning a dull chime with black gold; cultivating only life without nature is like a mirror reflecting a face without a precious glass.” He also said: “Cultivating only nature without life is the foremost illness in practice. Cultivating only the ancestral nature without the elixir, the yin spirit of ten thousand kalpas will hardly enter sagehood.” Xiāo Liǎozhēn said: “Cultivating both nature and life is the true transmission—profound, obscure, and mysterious.” People only understand solitary cultivation in stillness; they do not comprehend the wondrous principle of dual cultivation. Departing from yin and yang, turning away from creation, there can be no accomplishment. If one wishes to practice dual cultivation, one must rely on the mutual support of method and wealth. *Method and wealth* refers to resources within the method. *Dual application* means both are employed to their fullest. This is essential from the outset, hence the phrase *must rely*.]

First, unite like-minded companions as assistants;
Next, seek a great household to secure a favorable plan.

[Annotation: Ancestor Zhōnglí said: “Wealth is not difficult to obtain; a companion is hard to find.” The *Cantong Qi* states: “The two sevens gather, assisting the practitioner.” Yíng Chánzǐ said: “Aides of like mind cannot be lacking; three of one heart must carefully support one another.” Tiān Láizǐ said: “To refine the elixir, one must find friends—three of like mind guarding one another. Without companions of the same aspiration, the great medicine will hardly form, and mercury will escape.” The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: “One must select three fellow disciples as aides, mutually dependent.” Xue Daoguang said: “Three of one mind must guard against peril.” The *Song of the Cauldron* says: “Three people of one heart must be employed.” Across thousands of scriptures and ten thousand classics, all speak of three people—never has there been one who practiced alone.
*Seeking a great household to secure a favorable plan* means that to pursue this endeavor, one must rely on a great household. The common saying goes: “The golden elixir emerges from the wealthy.” Immortal Shí Xìnglín instructed Xue Zǐxián: “Go to a bustling metropolis and rely on someone of influence.” The *Essentials* state: “One must depend on a powerful household for inner support and outer protection.” Zhāng Zǐyáng achieved success only after obtaining Mǎ Dūyùn; Xue Daoguang completed the elixir only after meeting Zhāng Huánwèi.
First unite like-minded companions, then seek the opportune moment—proceeding step by step, one cannot expect sudden success without years of effort.]

】 Yet those who aspire to the supreme Dao must secretly knock upon the Mysterious Pass.
*[Annotation: When worldly people seek this most authentic Dao, its principles are subtle, its methods secret—rarely heard or known. There exists a mechanism most profound and wondrous; one must secretly inquire of the master and inwardly seal it in the heart.]*

Choose an auspicious site and guard the secrecy of the work; prepare the alchemical chamber and ensure the vessels are properly matched.
*[Annotation: An "auspicious site" is a blessed place; "guarding secrecy" means reverently attending to the work with utmost discretion, never daring to reveal it. Ancestor Dānyáng said: "Select companions, select resources, seek a blessed site." Master Shàngyáng said: "With companions and resources, much external protection—why must one retreat to deep mountains to become immortal?" Only with such a site may one then establish the alchemical chamber, where all vessels and implements must be properly matched. "Properly matched" means harmoniously paired.]*

Setting the furnace and erecting the crucible symbolize inner and outer—two Qian and Kun, heaven and earth. Refining the self and laying the foundation fortify both the personal realm and the state.
*[Annotation: Method, resources, companions, and site—lacking any one, success is impossible. Only when all four are complete may one set the furnace and erect the crucible. The crucible emulates heaven and earth, hence the metaphors of the Qian furnace and Kun crucible, or inner and outer crucibles. *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality* states: "The outer crucible refers to the form of the elixir field; the inner crucible refers to the qi within the elixir field." Qian and Kun are called "two," and these two are divided into inner and outer. The Ancestor said: "Two layers of heaven and earth, four phases of yin and yang." Once the crucible is prepared, one proceeds to refine the self and lay the foundation. Without refining the self, the foundation cannot be laid; if the foundation is not laid, refining the self is in vain. Ancient teachings say: "Cultivation has its stages; refining the self is boundless." *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "Gathering the medicine is easy; refining the self is most difficult." One must ensure the spirit is harmonious, the mind ashen, and the will settled. *The True Principle of Heavenly Immortality* says: "If unity is achieved, the foundation is laid; if unity is not achieved, the foundation cannot be laid." The ancients often compared the state to the human body: the heart as ruler, qi as minister, essence as the people. When essence is whole and qi abundant, it is called "a prosperous state with contented people." *Awakening to Reality* says: "Only when the people are content and the state prosperous may one seek battle; after battle, one may behold the sage." "The people content and the state prosperous" means the foundation is laid. The body is divided into self and other—how could the crucible and furnace not be inner and outer?]*

At the critical juncture, face circumstances without attachment, relying on the courage of keen vigor. Generally, temper the furnace and forge the sword, drawing upon the softness and hardness of Metal and Water.
*[Annotation: At the outset of practice, the crucial moment lies in facing circumstances without attachment. Confronting them yet unstained, one truly transcends worldly passions and forgets self and other. When beginning, all thoughts are emptied, the mind wholly devoted—entirely dependent on this resolute, keen, and courageous qi, may success be possible. *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* states: "With courage, success comes easily; with indolence, it is hard to achieve." The pivot of refining the self with Jade Liquid, the essence of forging the sword with Metal and Water—these are the spiritual roots of heaven and earth, the skeletal framework of yin and yang. Only when tempered to radiant sharpness may one soar as a spirit and walk as a sage. At the time of the third and fifth phases, the divine peak is keen and bright, hardness and softness responding in rhythm. The Ancestor said: "A flying spirit-sword with two edges—yet the returned elixir falls at the peak’s summit." "Tempering the furnace" means applying fire gently.]*

In operation, in withdrawal and addition, when encountering peril, one must bathe;

When plucking the zither or tapping bamboo, upon encountering contention, it is fitting to embrace the feminine. *[Note: The celestial gate lies in the hand, the earthly axis moves with the heart—pivoting yin and yang, steering the transformations of creation, wielding the mechanism of heaven and earth’s opening and closing, practicing the method of sun and moon’s union. Withdrawing lead and adding mercury, the curtain’s light shines through; the lead cauldron glows gently as dragon and tiger meet at the Magpie Bridge. At this moment, great peril arises—one must withdraw the fire, halt the talismans, and perform the work of bathing. Bathing means washing the heart and retiring into concealment. *The True Transmission of the Golden Elixir* states: "Bamboo must be tapped, the zither must be plucked." *A Sprig of Flowers* says: "Amidst the blossoms, I tap bamboo and pluck the zither, my heart serene as water." *Essentials* says: "First tap bamboo to rouse the dead, then pluck the zither to harmonize the sound." *Awakening to Reality* says: "Tap bamboo to summon the tortoise to swallow purple mushrooms, pluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the elixir pellet." Tapping bamboo empties the heart; plucking the zither fills the belly. The classic says: "Water flows downward and does not contend—this is truly embracing the feminine." Laozi says: "Never strive to be first, but always follow others." *Awakening to Reality* says: "I urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the enemy." And again: "Let them take the lead; I shall be the guest." This is the essence of non-contention. Facing Qian and Dui, reversing husband and wife—here lies the meaning of harmony and accord. After a hundred days, the work becomes spiritually responsive, bending and straightening as circumstances demand. After a year, the work matures, and pursuit and absorption become effortless. *[Note: *The Jade Emperor’s Heart Seal Scripture* says: "When the returning wind blends, a hundred days bring spiritual efficacy." *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* says: "After a hundred days of work, marvelously seizing the celestial cycle, one bends and straightens, responding to things with spiritual agility." A year is roughly stated—ten months plus Mao and You. Xue Daoguang says: "In the first year, bathing guards against peril; in ten months, regulation requires careful moderation." *The Song of Gathering Gold* says: "In ten months, diligently swallow the elixir." By this time, the embryo is formed and the fruit ripens—pursuit and absorption follow the heart. This is what is meant by "three hundred days of fire, ten months of gestation." The spirit leaves the body, coming and going at will, erasing the record of death and attaining the rank of immortality—only awaiting the refinement of the spirit to emerge from the shell. Then follows three years of nursing and nine years of wall-facing.]*]*

"One steals the generative qi within that destructive force to infuse one’s own yin essence within yang. *[Note: The Dao is the mechanism of theft. From the depths of yin, one steals the utmost yang—thus the *Classic of the Hidden Correspondence* says: 'This mechanism of theft—none in the world can see it, none can know it.' This Dao unites water and fire in one palace, employing life and death interchangeably. The generative qi is sought within this destructive qi. Master Shangyang said: 'There is a blade that kills, and a technique that revives.' The *Awakening to Reality* says: 'If one can turn this mechanism of life and death, disaster transforms into fortune in the turn of a palm.' It also says: 'If one understands the mechanism of killing and its reversals, one knows that harm conceals grace.' The Three Powers steal from one another, seizing the mechanism of Heaven and Earth to attain longevity and deathlessness. Now, what I possess is the yin essence within yang. As *Awakening to Reality* states: 'The yin essence within yang is not firm in substance; cultivating this single element only leads to delusion and weakness.' One must obtain the generative qi within that destructive force to infuse it. Thus it is said: 'If only the essence of Kan infuses the cavity of Li, pure Qian can then embrace the flying jade.' Stealing from that to infuse this—how clear this is, yet why do people not ponder it deeply?]*

The Jade Liquid and Golden Liquid perfect one’s nature and one’s life respectively; the two phases and four phases are half in Kan and half in Li. *[Note: The Jade Liquid perfects nature, the Golden Liquid perfects life. The *Essentials of the Golden Elixir* says: 'The Jade Liquid’s returning elixir is wondrously subtle, relying entirely on the Golden Liquid to refine mortal lead.' It also says: 'Through forging the sword and grafting, one attains eternal spring and longevity of ten thousand years.' It further states: 'The great Dao of the Golden Elixir lies wholly in the communion of spirit. The subtle mechanism of the Jade Liquid has no other wondrous technique.' The six phases of one hour: the first two phases gather the medicine, the latter four phases nurture it. As it is said: 'Two phases to gather the pearl, four phases to refine the spiritual work.' Half in Kan, half in Li—this does not mean dividing the six phases between Kan and Li. Rather, Li is empty while Kan is full; Li is yang within yin, Kan is yin within yang. Thus it is said: 'Take the solid center from the Kan position, infuse it to transform the yin within the Li palace.']*

At first, one brings nonbeing into being, and already the dragon resides in the tiger’s position; in the end, one flows Wu into Ji, and only then does one know the tiger meets the dragon’s palace. *[Note: The *Token for the Agreement of the Three* says: 'Being and nonbeing interpenetrate; above, the spirit-virtue resides.' Nonbeing is nature, being is life. Bringing nonbeing into being is the initial work of entry, cultivating life through nature. Nature is the Azure Dragon, life is the White Tiger. Exploring the tiger’s den, plucking the tiger’s whiskers, seeking the tiger’s marrow—thus the tiger’s den becomes the dragon’s abode. Ji is yang earth, Wu is yin earth; the two earths form the jade tablet. The *Crane Grove* says: 'Flowing Wu acts as the matchmaker to approach Ji; metal returns to nature, celebrating the bridegroom.' The White Tiger is metal within water; the Azure Dragon is wood within fire. Wood and fire share a palace, metal and water become companions. These two entities contain the Four Images; their union in the mysterious palace coalesces the elixir.']*

Lü Dongbin, the Pure Yang Patriarch of the Dao of the Elixir—*Five Chapters*"

To discern the maturity of medicinal substances, one must distinguish the clarity or turbidity of the water’s source.

[**Note:** The true work of gathering the medicine hinges on distinguishing maturity. *The Orthodox Principles of Heavenly Immortals* states: "If the true work is unclear, though one gathers, there is no medicine to gather. If the medicinal *qi* has not yet reached pure yang, though one knows to gather, the medicine will not be gathered. For if it is too tender, the *qi* is insufficient; if too old, the *qi* has already dispersed—neither can form the elixir. The so-called water’s source arises from the Heavenly One’s generation, prizing clarity and purity, not filth and turbidity, and this also depends on the stillness and stability of the mind. An ancient song says: *When intent is settled and spirit at ease, the water’s source is clear; when intent is scattered and spirit confused, the water’s source is turbid.* Discernment must be constant and meticulous, execution precise, allowing no trace of blindness or ignorance.]

Those who refine the self and await the moment must wait for yang to arise in the Red County; those who encounter urgency at the furnace must ensure *gui* stirs within the Divine Continent.

[**Note:** *The Spring at Miluo* says: "The sevenfold return of the elixir first requires refining the self and awaiting the moment. When the first yang stirs, that is the time. Awaiting the moment means waiting for its arrival. The Red County is like the Red Water. The Dark Pearl of Red Water may be obtained in due time. Thus, when facing the furnace and its conditions, one must await the true moment. Those who encounter urgency act immediately upon arrival, for the moment must not be lost. *Gui* stirring refers to the time of *gui*’s arising. *Awakening to Reality* says, *'When lead encounters *gui* arising, gather it swiftly.'* *The Song of Gathering Gold* states: *'Know when *gui* is born, recognize when *gui* appears—thirty-six hours, two and a half days.'* Yang arises in the Red County, *gui* stirs in the Divine Continent. How can one who seeks the furnace and sets the tripod remain ignorant of this?"]

When one observes the dragon in the field, one must fiercely refine and intensely forge; when one suddenly hears the tiger’s roar emerging from its den, one may invert and reverse the process.

[**Note:** The *Book of Changes* says: *"Seeing the dragon in the field is beneficial for meeting the great person."* This is the second yang line of *Qian*, the perfect time for withdrawal and addition, requiring fierce refining and intense forging. It is not like the first yang line, the hidden dragon, which is too tender, nor the third yang line, which has already formed a substance and is unfit for gathering. *Awakening to Reality* says: *"The White Tiger of Western Mountain rages wildly; the Azure Dragon of Eastern Sea cannot be withstood. Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death, transforming into a lump of purple frost."* *The Four Hundred Words on the Golden Elixir* states: *"The dragon comes from the Eastern Sea; the tiger rises from Western Mountain. The two beasts battle fiercely, transforming into the marrow of heaven and earth."* Inverting yin and yang, reversing the workings of creation, blowing the *xun* wind, fanning the bellows, from the Great Mysterious Pass, flowing backward to the Heavenly Valley Cavern, golden essence pierces the crown, silver streams surge like the sky, wind stirs in the Mud Pill Palace; the Crimson Palace shines with moonlight, the Magpie Bridge emits auspicious fragrance, sweet dew descends, the hundred vessels return to the origin, the nine passes are thoroughly opened—this is what is meant by *"When the union of Qian and Kun ceases, a single point falls into the Yellow Court."*

The fire compels the metal to move and exit the Kun furnace, hence the name "seven returns"; the metal, refined by fire, returns to the Qian tripod, called the "nine refinements."

[**Note:** The metal is the medicine. *The Kinship of the Three* says: *"When metal returns to its nature, it may then be called the returned elixir."* *The Guide* states: *"Fire compels metal to move, inverting the natural order."* *The True Blind of Chanting the Dao* says: *"People know fire overcomes metal, but do not know metal truly loves fire. Before metal leaves the ore and departs the furnace, without fierce fire compelling it, it cannot ascend."* Thus it is said: the seven returns are cinnabar returning to its origin; the nine refinements are golden liquid returning to its source. Seven is the number of fire; nine is the number of metal. Exiting the Kun furnace, returning to the Qian tripod, one gives and one receives, forming the return and refinement. One is nature, one is emotion, and this is called extracting from Kan to fill Li, returning essence to replenish the brain, illuminating the Li cavity, restoring the robust body of Qian—all refer to this meaning.]

The "return" is the substance Qian lost and has now regained; the "refinement" is the true self that departed and has now returned.

[**Note:** The precelestial Qian and Kun transformed into the postcelestial Kan and Li, meaning the middle line of Qian was lost. Now, taking the solid center of the Kan position and using it to transform the yin within the Li palace, what Qian lost is now returned to Qian—I am Qian. From the beginning of the primordial chaos, what was lost has now returned to its original state. Is this not what departed and has now come back?]

Little do they know that following the natural order gives rise to humans and beings, while reversing it produces immortals and buddhas.

[**Note:** The phrase *"little do they know"* means it is easily understood. Laozi said: *"My Dao is very easy to know, very easy to practice; yet the world cannot know it, cannot practice it."* Heaven and earth share the same root with me; the myriad things share the same body with me. Humans are the most spiritually endowed of all beings and grow alongside them. Thus, humans and beings are collectively named. To know the principle of becoming immortals and buddhas is initially no different from the principle of giving rise to humans and beings—only the distinction between following and reversing matters. Following gives rise to the ordinary; reversing produces the sage—this is ancient teaching. Master Tuo Yang’s *Entering the Mirror of Fire* says: *"Following produces humans; reversing produces the elixir. Grasping this principle, one becomes an immortal."* *The Rootless Tree* states: *"Following makes one ordinary; reversing makes one an immortal—only a reversal in between."* *A Single Stroke* says: *"If you know the origin of your birth, you will understand that creation lies in your hands."* Zhang Ziyang said: *"When the five phases follow the natural order, the common Dao has birth and death; when the five phases reverse, the elixir tripod remains eternally numinous and enduring."* *The Complete Methods of the Numinous Treasure* says: *"When humans first receive the essence and blood of their ordinary parents, they are turbid and chaotic, without form."*]

When the essence and blood settle, in the first month a gestational sac forms; in the second, the embryo takes shape; in the third, the hun-soul arises; in the fourth, the po-soul is fixed; in the fifth, the five viscera divide; in the sixth, the six bowels open; in the seventh, the seven orifices become clear; in the eighth, the eight luminous scenes are complete; in the ninth, the limbs are fully formed; in the tenth, the qi is whole—then the fetus emerges and is born.

The Way of the Returned Elixir largely follows this pattern. At the moment one receives the wondrous qi of the numinous father and sagely mother, the nine must harmonize with the ten before the metallic qi begins to arrive. It too is turbid and chaotic, an empty vastness of numinous clarity—no color or depth to rely upon, no form or shadow to depend on. The primordial qi rests in tranquility; the five phases scatter and spread, filling the encompassing expanse, silently congealing and merging. Drifting and roaming in luminous cultivation, it returns to the origin and reverts to emptiness; gathering and condensing in dense support, it conceives and nurtures the true, gives rise to the five viscera, orders the five qi, unites the hundred spirits, and knits the fetal immortal—this is called the yang-spirit.

Though it distinguishes self from other, it is in no way the chamber arts of bedroom alchemy.

Should one cling to the solitary self, how could one grasp the Peng bird’s mechanism for soaring south?

Though the distinction between self and other is already clear—where one steals the life-qi from the other’s midst of slaying to refine the yin essence within one’s own yang—this is further expounded here. While self and other are distinct, the process is upright and luminous, far from base, murky, or obscure. Observe the world: what does not follow the principle of duality? Where there is heaven, there is earth; where there is sun, there is moon; where there is yin, there is yang; where there is male, there is female; where there is self, there is other. Then consider cold and heat, day and night, purity and turbidity, movement and stillness, hardness and softness, husband and wife, female and male—is there anything singular that lacks its counterpart? To deny this is to lose the principle.

The ancestral masters, in their compassion to deliver the world, feared that people might misconstrue this principle as the chamber arts of bedroom alchemy, the consumption of filth, or the tactics of "bedroom warfare"—these are the delusions of hell-bound fools who fail to comprehend the matter of self and other. Thus, they reiterate: though there is a distinction between self and other, it is not that sort of affair.

*Master Zhuang* says: "In the Northern Darkness there is a fish, and its name is Kun. The Kun’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, and its name is Peng. The Peng’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. When this bird stirs, it will migrate to the Southern Darkness." The Kun and Peng are metaphors for the vastness of the Dao, transforming into a bird, transmuting qi to ascend. From north to south, from other to self. The self is *li*, the Vermilion Bird of the south, containing within it the Wood-fluid Azure Dragon; the other is *kan*, the Dark Warrior of the north, containing within it the Metal-essence White Tiger.

The ancestral masters, in their mercy, feared that people would rigidly fixate on heart and kidneys, groping within the confines of their own bodies, and thus fail to understand Master Zhuang’s meaning of "soaring south." *A Single Stroke* says: "They say destiny lies within this body of mine—who realizes that the solitary self possesses nothing? This wondrous art, this mechanism, fundamentally involves the distinction between self and other; it is not the affair of a solitary self."

Within *kan* resides a speck of black lead, called the primordial—without its kindred, it can never be obtained; within *li* dwell sevenfold vermilion cinnabar-mercuries, yet without the true seed, they vanish in an instant.

[Annotation: The *Cantong Qi* states: "The *kan*-male is the sun, the *li*-female the moon; the sun bestows virtue, the moon unfurls its light. The moon receives the sun’s transformation, its body unharmed and unwaning." The single speck of true yang within *kan* is the black lead, the essence of mysterious water, the primordial true qi. The single speck of water-mercury within *li* is cinnabar, the essence of grand yang, the primordial true fluid. The *Lingbao Bifa* says: "Heaven-one generates water, and within *kan* lies lead; Earth-two generates fire, and within *li* arises cinnabar." Embracing the essence of Heaven-one, it stands as the chief of the five essences—this is black lead. Lead gives birth to silver, lead is silver’s mother; receiving the qi of grand yang, it becomes the foremost among all stones—this is cinnabar. Within cinnabar is born mercury, mercury the child of cinnabar. Hard to obtain is the silver within lead, easy to lose is the mercury within cinnabar. The ancestral masters, in their compassion, pointed out that to seek this speck of black lead, one must search among its kindred. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Kindred easily yield to effort, without the seed skill avails not." Again: "Attaching to kindred accords with nature, things form readily through refinement." Again: "Kindred follow one another, affairs contrary yield no treasure." Again: "Yin and yang intermingle, seeking their kindred." Ancestor Sanfeng said: "All else apart from this kindred is madness." The *Jieyao* states: "Only with kindred is success easy; lacking the elixir’s wealth, it cannot be achieved." The *Wugenshu* says: "Kindred align, work proceeds well." Without kindred, solitary yin cannot generate, and the day of obtaining lead will never come.

The *li* trigram is yang without and yin within—this is the self. Its sevenfold seven apertures emit the fluids. Ancestor Zhongli said: "Within the human body, inside and out, all is yin. What is the yang essence, the true seed? It is the primordial true qi—black lead." Mercury’s nature is volatile and hard to restrain. The *Cantong Qi* says: "Ghosts hide, dragons conceal, none know where they abide." Yet when a speck of primordial true lead arrives, true mercury naturally abides, no longer flying away. Like a cat pouncing on a mouse, like a hare meeting a hawk, it becomes docile of its own accord.

Thus, one borrows Qian and Kun to establish the crucible and furnace, seeking the true qi contained within the Great One, relying on yin and yang as the means to pursue the mysterious pearl stored in the Water Palace.

[Annotation: Qian and Kun possess the names of crucible and furnace; the crucible and furnace bear the designations of medicinal substances. This Way borrows the false to cultivate the true, turning the false into the true. The *Bai Ju Zhang* says: "Others know not our Way—clearly, the false is made real." Borrowing Qian and Kun as metaphors, one forcibly names them crucible and furnace. The *Fuming Pian* says: "The crucible—originally, there is no crucible." It also says: "This medicine has no furnace, only a crucible; one crucible transforms into ten thousand crucibles." Borrowing Qian and Kun as the names for crucible and furnace, one employs the imagery of the *Yi* to clarify the principles of the elixir Way. Yet one must grasp the image and forget the words—one cannot cling to the text or be bound by the symbol.

The true qi of the primordial Great One cannot be sought without the crucible and furnace; the crucible and furnace cannot manifest their imagery without Qian and Kun. Without understanding yin and yang, there is no way to begin. Thus, yin and yang are truly the means for refining the elixir. The trap is for catching fish; the snare is for capturing hares—such is the method. The mysterious pearl is the elixir. This pearl lies concealed within the Great Abyss of the Northern Culmen. To seek it, one must thoroughly penetrate yin and yang and deeply comprehend the workings of creation. Like the trap for fish or the snare for hares, one may then grasp it, avoiding futility and failure.]

In fleeting moments, swift as a breath, the broken line of Qian is mended; in an instant’s transformation, the six hollows of Kun are restored. [Note: "Fleeting moments" and "instant’s transformation" denote the swiftness of the process. This speaks to the ease of returning the elixir. The *Xinyin Jing* states: "Preserve the void, guard the existent—accomplished in an instant." From the first union of yin and yang, the middle line of Qian enters Kun to become Kan; the middle line of Kun enters Qian to become Li. Now, drawing forth the single yin from Li to fill the single yang in Kan, Li is restored to Qian, and Qian’s flaw is no more. Having extracted the one line from Kan to mend Li into Qian’s three unbroken lines, Kun in turn withdraws the two broken lines from Li, returning to its six hollows. The *Guizhi* says: "From this, the robust form of Qian is transformed—hidden or soaring, all lies within the heart."]

At this point, the heart returns to the chamber of spirit, and one is ranked among the Heavenly Immortals; the elixir descends into the Yellow Court, and a thousand spirits bask in serenity. The August Emperor bestows praise, and heaven and earth stand in awe. [Note: "At this point" signifies the attainment of this stage. Here, qi gathers and spirit is whole, the heart settles and spirit congeals, the heart empties and spirit becomes numinous. *Zhuangzi* says: "Its heavenly guard is complete, its spirit without flaw." The *Yinfu Jing* states: "The spirit that does not act as spirit, breathless yet ever-breathing, is ranked among the heavenly offices as an Upper Perfected." Once the fire of the numinous root is kindled and the pearl from the sea’s depths is returned, a single elixir drops into the Yellow Court. At this time, qi coalesces and spirit solidifies, the hun rests and the po is stilled; the entire body harmonizes, and the hundred vessels brim with spring. The Heavenly Lord is at peace, and the myriad spirits obey his command. The August Emperor bestows praise, honoring his valor. Heaven and earth stand in awe, deeming it rare. The *Wuzhen Pian* says: "Countless divine dragons are utterly astonished."]

Lü Dongbin, the Pure Yang Patriarch of the Five Chapters, embraced the origin and guarded the One, nurturing it for ten months—spirit took form, and he refined it. Facing the wall, he sat in oblivion, and after nine years, his body transcended form. [Note: The *Jindan Jieyao* states: "When the nation is prosperous and the people at peace, the Dao is already achieved—then one should face the wall to nurture the original spirit. When the nine transformations are complete, ascend to heaven, and forever become a Heavenly Immortal, enjoying boundless spring." After returning the elixir, one proceeds to nurture it. Embracing the original spirit and guarding the true One, the fire of the great celestial cycle must not be interrupted in the slightest. By the time the tenth month’s work is complete, a spirit emerges from the Mud Pill Palace above the crown, and a body exists beyond the body. The Ancestor of the Mud Pill Palace says: "In the tenth month, the fetal immortal emerges, borne by thunder and lightning as a golden dragon." "Refining the spirit" means that at every step, one must remain vigilant—this is the work of nursing, requiring three years. Thereafter, one selects an auspicious mountain, a blessed site, an ancient relic, or a numinous altar—where water encircles and mountains pay homage, where qi gathers and wind is stored. Beside the clouds, one constructs a chamber, sits in profound stillness, and forgets form. Form and spirit become wondrous, merging with the true Dao. Water and fire cannot harm, blades and weapons cannot injure. When merit is fulfilled in three thousand deeds and the time of nine years arrives, transformations become effortless, and the eight directions present no barrier. One may then move mountains and overturn seas, traverse earth and reach heaven, aid the world and pacify the people, punish the wicked and eliminate harm. Awaiting the celestial decree’s descent, one ascends in broad daylight, attaining the highest rank of Heavenly Immortals. Equal in grandeur to heaven and earth, in radiance to sun and moon, and in longevity to the cosmos, this is the supreme first vehicle.

The Great Dao of Heavenly Immortals is the work of true heroes—only the greatest of heroes and most extraordinary of talents may undertake it.

The inception of this Daoist art appears heterodox yet is fundamentally orthodox; within its firing process from beginning to end, it resembles the deployment of extraordinary military strategy.

At the outset of its practice, from the very first steps, there lies a wondrous technique for connecting with life and prolonging years. This art is profoundly esoteric—*The Awakening to Reality* states that it begins with deliberate action yet remains unseen by ordinary men. It belongs entirely to proper and orthodox practice, never licentious or absurd. *The Three-Character Formula* says:
*"Spoken, it is ugly;
Practiced, it is marvelous.
All despise it,
Each one mocks it."*
Bai Yuchan observes: *"Reveal it, and people will surely laugh."* *The Gourd Song* declares:
*"Practiced, it is marvelous;
Spoken, it is ugly—
Fools laugh till their mouths split."*
Though the words seem absurd and the deeds bizarre, who would not mistake it for heterodoxy?

As the saying goes:
*"The wicked practice orthodoxy, and even orthodoxy becomes wicked;
The upright practice heterodoxy, and even heterodoxy becomes upright."*
Yet the heart remains pure and undefiled, without the slightest impropriety—only the outward traces may seem suspicious.

As for the firing process: it begins with field combat and ends with defending the city. There are methods for achieving victory through surprise and images of battle and triumph. *The Rootless Tree* states: *"Dragon and tiger mount the altar for a single battle."* *The Awakening to Reality* says: *"In application, one must divide left and right armies—let them be the host while I remain the guest."* Bai Ziqing remarks: *"Only after the spiritual battle concludes can one behold the sage."* *"Heroes act in due time, and weapons secure great peace."*

Lead and mercury lack the Elder of Fire (Bing); east and west remain divided.
Infant and Maiden lack the Yellow Dame (Huangpo); though close as a foot and a span, they stand apart.

[Annotation: The Elder of Fire is fire. Refining lead and mercury cannot succeed without fire. The Wood-mercury of the east and the Metal-lead of the west are utterly estranged—only with the fire of bing and ding can they be harmonized, so that instead of mutual conquest, they give birth to one another. *The Awakening to Reality* states: *"Wood’s nature loves Metal’s righteous compliance; Metal’s disposition cherishes Wood’s benevolent kindness. Devouring each other, they grow intimate—only then does the man conceive."* *The Emerald Writ* says: *"Infant Boy and Maiden Girl are sundered as if by the ends of the earth; only by relying on the Yellow Dame to entwine them both."* *The Single Branch* says: *"Moved only when the Yellow Dame beckons, awaiting only when the Maiden opens her lotus."* *The Song of Tapping the Hexagrams* says: *"When the Yellow Dame matches them in perfect union, the moment is flawless, the transmission sealed."* *The Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says: *"Entrust the Yellow Dame to woo the Maiden Girl—lightly, silently, she lifts them together."* The Yellow Dame is the deputy marshal of the elixir chamber, utterly indispensable. Without her, though they stand as near as a foot and a span, their affinity is thwarted, their passions discordant, and they remain askew, unable to unite.]

Master the urgent and the gradual, weigh fortune and misfortune—all rests in the craftsman’s hand, to measure and deliberate.
Discern advance and retreat, know when to halt and when to be content—how could the ignorant ever succeed?

**[Annotation: The crux of elixir-refinement lies in the four characters—*gradual, urgent, auspicious, inauspicious*—which demand the most thorough familiarity and deliberation.
To *hold the city* is gradual; *field combat* is urgent.
*Tempering and nurturing* is gradual; *gathering the medicine* is urgent.
*Vital qi* is auspicious; *lethal qi* is inauspicious.
*Yang qi* is auspicious; *yin qi* is inauspicious.
*The Mirror for Taking the Medicine* says: *"Receive qi auspiciously, guard against its turning inauspicious."*
*The Waking to Reality* says: *"Hold the city or wage field combat—know fortune and misfortune, and you may fill the crucible with numinous cinnabar."*
Only when this is deeply understood and practiced with mastery may one be called a *craftsman’s hand*.
*To measure and deliberate* means to act with precision, never straying from the plumb line.
*The Rootless Tree* says: *"The craftsman’s hand, firm at the helm, lets the ocean’s waves churn below."*
*The Single Branch of Flowers* says: *"Wield the craftsman’s hand to sail upstream—such is the meaning here."*
Zhang Quanyi says: *"Yang fire advances, turning from the left; yin tally retreats, spiraling to the west."*
Master Qiu Changchun’s *Secret Formula of the Microcosmic Orbit* states: *"From Zi to Si, the six yang employ nine, thirty-six breaths to gather, take in, and ascend. From Wu to Hai, the six yin employ six, twenty-four breaths to retreat, descend, refine, and simmer."*
*Advance and retreat* are thus *ascent and descent*.
*The Orthodox Principle of Celestial Immortality* says: *"When the mechanism of inhalation closes, I turn to Qian, taking ascent as advance. When the mechanism of exhalation opens, I turn to Kun, taking descent as retreat."*
Master Chongxu says: *"Advance and retreat are but empty metaphors—truly, no advance or retreat is seen."*
Zhang Ziyang says:
*"Before refining the returning elixir, refine swiftly;
Once refined, know when to halt and be content.
If you cling to excess with an insatiable heart,
You will not escape ruin and disgrace one day."*
Xiao Liaozhen says: *"Beware—do not proceed with firing recklessly;
Without knowing when to halt, you court collapse and peril."*
This speaks of ceasing the fire once the elixir is formed—a principle of profound subtlety.
Without the true master’s direct instruction, even the brightest and wisest may struggle to comprehend it.
How could the ignorant ever succeed?]**

Recognize the ebb and flow as the tides of the sea, ever faithful to their time;
Gauge the workings of creation by the waxing and waning of the sun and moon.

[**Note:** The character *xin* (信, "faithfulness") is the grand path of all truth and sages. *Zhuangzi* says: *"There is sentiment, there is faithfulness; there is non-action, there is formlessness."* *The Hundred Verses* says: *"Within this lies true faithfulness—when it arrives, even the lord must be startled."* The midnight and noon never err; the tides keep their appointed hours. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Heaven responds to the stars, earth responds to the tides."* Bai Yuchan says: *"Beneath the earth, the sea’s tides; above the sky, the moon."* *The Essential Instructions* says: *"When the time comes, await the tide’s sign—when the moon rises in the west."* By this, one measures faithfulness, and thus the principle of ebb and flow may be recognized at its source.

The sun and moon are the two luminaries of yin and yang. When qi issues forth as light, the moon borrows the sun’s radiance to shine. By the sun’s direct or slanted illumination, the moon’s spirit and body wax and wane. From this principle of waxing and waning, one may gauge the mechanism of creation.

On the third day, the moon emerges in the west—this is the first yang born in the Kan position. On the fifteenth, the moon is full in the east—then the six lines complete the Qian trigram’s primordial origin. [*The True Classic Song* says: *"On the third day, Zhen emerges in the west; by the winding river, the moon’s brilliance shines."* *The Union of the Three* says: *"On the third day, it emerges bright, Zhen receives the west; on the eighth, Dui receives the south, the upper arc straight as a cord; on the fifteenth, the Qian body is complete, full and flourishing in the east."* *The Awakening to Reality* says: *"On the southwestern path, the moon’s brilliance shines—from here the great medicine is born."* The great medicine is the returning first yang. This yang arises within the Kun body, emerging from pure yin. The full moon in the east: Qian contains *jia* and *ren*, Kun contains *yi* and *gui*; *jia*-wood and *geng*-metal face each other and become full. *The Union* says: *"When the three and five virtues are complete, the Qian body is formed, the six lines revolve in harmony."* *The Book of Changes* says: *"Transforming and moving without constraint, it flows through the six voids."* *The Union* says: *"Flowing through the six lines, it is difficult to perceive."* This describes how the two trigrams Qian and Kun revolve through the six trigrams, and how the central lines of Kan and Li revolve through the six lines. Qian and Kun give birth to the six children, each receiving one line from their central lines—thus it is said that without their central lines, they are incomplete.]

Split open the golden aperture, cleave the primordial chaos, revealing the innermost truths of Laozi and Zhuangzi;
Clarify the bellows and flute, drink the knife’s measure, spilling the heart and liver of Zhang Baiduan.

[**Note:** Unlocking the secret treasury of the golden lock, cleaving open the primordial chaos, one fully exposes the profound mechanisms of the *Daodejing* and *Nanhua*, the innermost truths of Laozi and Zhuangzi. The bellows and flute refer to the crucible. That with a base is the bellows; that without is the flute. The bellows of heaven and flute of earth are like the zither and flute, like the gourd. To drink the knife’s measure, first clarify the bellows and flute. *The Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: *"Drink the knife’s measure, glimpse heaven’s art."* *The Union* says: *"Crush it into one pill—nothing is more divine than the knife’s measure."* The Perfected Zhang Baiduan, styled Pingshu, composed *The Awakening to Reality*, baring his liver and gall, spilling forth the true teachings.]

Thus enlightening the friends who wander amidst mist and clouds, unveiling the hidden secrets of dragon and tiger.

[Annotation: Among those who wander amidst mist and clouds, many possess enlightened talents. Those with the aspiration to cultivate the Dao yet lack the opportunity to receive its methods—by reading this rhapsody, their long-cherished resolve may be fulfilled, and their wisdom awakened. This is not merely an exercise in parallel prose, but a revelation of the true essence of the supreme Dao, an unveiling of the hidden principles of dragon and tiger.]

Each seeks the firing times, early to ingest the millet-pearl.
In the Jasper Pool’s mystic gardens, hope stirs for another day.

[Annotation: Those with resolve must each seek their own karmic conditions, practice the secrets of the firing times, and ingest the pearl of millet. The Jasper Pool’s mystic gardens, the three thousand weak waters—none but the flying immortals may reach them. Yet by cultivating in accord with this rhapsody, that hope shall not be difficult to attain. *The Union* says: *"Mount the white crane, ride the dragon’s scales; roam the Great Void, pay homage to the Immortal Lords. Receive the celestial chart, be named a Perfected One."* It also says: *"When the Great One summons, remove to the Central Continent. With merit complete, ascend on high, receive the register and chart."*]

Without thought, stillness may arise;
in stillness, qi finds its balance.
When qi is balanced, breath comes to rest;
when breath rests, it naturally returns to the root.
Returning to the root, one perceives original nature;
perceiving nature, one begins to be true.

[Those who cannot attain stillness are bound by thoughts. Before one thought subsides, another arises—ten thousand cares surge ceaselessly, without a moment’s respite from youth to old age. How rarely is even a single breath of clarity known? To cultivate stillness, first enter through the cessation of thought. When thoughts are exhausted, passions and desires dissolve, and the heart-mind becomes pure. With the heart-mind purified, qi naturally harmonizes, like fish in a spring pond, like insects in hibernation—steaming and unfolding in boundless subtlety, its qi balanced. Over time, the in-and-out breath stabilizes, returning to its root, and breathing ceases entirely. As the *Perfected One* dwells in the deep abyss, floating and roaming within the compass of the rule, in ceaseless continuity, utterly serene—this is qi returning to the central pole, revolving without end, not truly without breath. When breath returns to the root, stillness settles into quiescence. At the utmost point of quiescence, original nature manifests, and the light of wisdom arises spontaneously. Original nature is the primordial spirit of one’s true destiny. The Buddha said: *"Seeing nature, one becomes a Buddha—this is called attaining the Dao."* Yet there is nothing to attain; attaining nothingness is true attainment.]

The myriad beings bear no scent;
beneath the earth, one hears thunder roar.
Ascending to the summit of Kunlun,
the path behind must be kept clear.

[When all conditions are stilled and sounds and scents vanish into boundless obscurity, the moment of returning movement arrives—suddenly, thunder bursts forth from the earth. The *Alchemical Classic* says: *"Earth’s thunder shakes the mountain’s peak; rain washes the yellow sprout as it emerges from the soil."* This is true yang revealing itself, blazing like fire, raging like a scorching wind. The *Yellow Court Classic* says: *"Within is a true person, crowned in golden cloth, bearing armor and talismans to open the seven gates."* This is no branch or leaf—it is the root itself. At this time, the river chariot is set in motion, crossing the Tail Gate, passing the twin barriers of the Spine Pass, ascending the Jade Pillow to reach Kunlun. This is the work of rising behind and descending before—one must keep the path distinct, never hasty or careless.]

Descend the mountain to meet the Magpie Bridge,
escorting it down to the Yellow Court.
Within the court, the *Yi*’s hexagrams unfold—
fifty-five, perfectly balanced.

[The elixir, descending from the summit of Kunlun, hangs from the upper palate, crosses the Magpie Bridge, passes the Towering Chambers, and is escorted to the Yellow Court, where it comes to rest. The Yellow Court is the divine chamber of the central palace. At this time, wind stirs in the Mud Pill, the moon shines in the Crimson Palace, kidney qi ascends, sweet dew descends, and all is returned to the earthen cauldron—wind calms, waves still, the nation at peace, the people secure. *"Unfolding the hexagrams of the *Yi* within the court"* refers to the three hundred eighty-four lines of the hexagrams and the three hundred eighty-four grains of firing time, modeling Qian and Kun, pairing Kan and Li, moving water and fire—all this is the unfolding. The fifty-five: the heavenly number is five, the earthly number is five; the five positions interact and each finds its harmony. The heavenly numbers total twenty-five, the earthly numbers thirty. All the numbers of heaven and earth sum to fifty-five—this is how transformations are accomplished and the spirits are set in motion. *"Balanced"* means harmonious alignment, serving as the method for refining the elixir, teaching one to seek its image through heaven and earth.]

Qi rolls forth to fill the four great elements;
sit or lie—watch as you proceed.

This is the principle of foundation-laying—
lone yin cannot ascend.

*[The four great elements fill the body,
all is qi’s repletion, nowhere incomplete.
It rolls and unfurls with the times,
flowing through the four limbs—
the four limbs need no explanation.
"Sit or lie—watch as you proceed":
The* Jindan Jieyao *says:
"Two bodies sit facing, the two luminaries appear before you."
The* Zhixuan Pian *says:
"Together on the bed, build the ladder to heaven"—
this may be done sitting, or lying down as well.
This is the principle of foundation-laying:
know that lone yin does not generate,
solitary yang does not grow.
If one cultivates alone in stillness,
how can ascent and descent be achieved?]*

Next, forge the spirit-sword—
three years to refine the self and succeed.
Thoughts upright, passions forgotten utterly,
before the furnace, the spirit remains unmoved.

*[This sword is not cast of bronze or iron—
it is the sword of wisdom.
The alchemical classics say:
"Emerging from being, entering non-being—
the three-exhaustion sword;
the elixir of immortality—
a single pellet."
Those who refine the elixir
must first forge the sword
before they can gather the medicine.
Only when the work of refining the self is complete
may the elixir be returned.
Refining the self means:
upright thoughts present,
wayward intentions absent,
passions forgotten, forms transcended,
staking one’s life in the effort.
Before the furnace, when the work begins,
the primordial spirit remains unmoved,
the heart wholly devoted—
this is the work of refining the self,
this is the method of forging the sword.]*

Seek and purchase the vessels of the elixir chamber—
five thousand forty-eight springs.
First observe the third night of the month,
when the moth-browed moon first appears in the *geng* direction.

*[The vessels of the elixir chamber
are not easily obtained.
They must be bought with money,
sought with effort,
before they can be acquired.
These vessels must correspond
to the number of the* Zangzhen Jing*—
five thousand forty-eight scrolls.
Only this true classic
reveals, on the third night of each month,
a crescent moth-browed new moon
in the* geng *direction—
this is the radiance of golden essence,
the time when the great medicine is about to emerge.
The* Qinyuan Chun *says:
"The warm lead cauldron,
light piercing the curtains."
To witness the* geng *flower appear,
turn back to seek the moth-browed moon.
Thus gather true lead—
each word must be truly transmitted.
*[The patriarchs, in their compassion,
have directly revealed the celestial mechanism.
They say: If you wish to see the flower appear in the* geng *direction—
though its position lies in the west, the* geng *region—
you must in fact seek it within the body,
and at once behold the moth-browed new moon.
The alchemical classics say:
"Suddenly glimpsing a moon in the western quarter,
pure yang swiftly runs to report to Zhongli."
When the time arrives,
do not delay or hesitate—
missing the celestial mechanism
means losing this wondrous secret of gathering true lead.
It is not easily known,
not easily gathered.
From ancient times to the present,
it has been transmitted mouth to mouth,
never lightly bestowed.
The pearl in the robe is near at hand,
yet deluded ones waste their efforts—
all because they have not met a true teacher
or received the true transmission.]]*

The firing times begin on the first day—
one *liang* gradually grows.
On the sixteenth, withdraw the yin tally—
two *liang* show no further increase.

*[Fire has its proper timing;
await the moment and employ it—
the work must begin on the first day.
The* Cantong Qi *says:
"In the first year, the sprout nourishes."
The first year is the first day.
"One* liang *gradually grows"—
from the first day, accumulate the lines and grains.
The so-called "eight* liang *of lead,
half a* jin *of mercury"—
all are amassed by increments of weight.
The sixteenth is after the full moon;
the method calls for withdrawing the yin tally.
No further weight can be added—
this is the time to cease firing and halt the tally,
when the two no longer meet.]*

Bathing occurs at the hours of hare and fowl—
guard against loss, guard against peril and collapse.
Golden qi naturally steams and suffuses,
the body’s sweat dripping profusely.

*[Hare and fowl are* mao *and* you.
*Mao* is the hare among the twelve earthly branches,
*you* is the fowl.
At this time, punishment and virtue arrive at the gate—
the method calls for bathing.
Bathing means washing the heart and cleansing the thoughts.
The* Yi *says:
"The noble one washes the heart and retires, hidden in secrecy."
This matter is perilous—
above is heaven, below is hell.
One must proceed with utmost care,
guarding against collapse,
before the golden qi can steam and circulate,
rising and descending,
pervading the four limbs,
filling the entire body.
Warm qi harmonizes,
and sweat drips abundantly.]*

After ten months, the embryo is complete—
the crown of the head must release the spirit.
Then face the wall for nine years—
ascend to the Jade Capital in flight.

*[The* Cantong Qi *says:
"After ten months have passed,
it emerges from the womb."
When the ten months’ work is complete,
the nurturing is finished.
The alchemical classics say:
"Three hundred days of firing,
ten months of gestation—
the spirit leaves the body,
now here, now gone."
At this time, the ore is exhausted, the gold pure,
the entire body is pure yang.
The five viscera are regenerated,
the hundred bones re-established.
The mouth produces numinous fluid,
blood transforms into white marrow.
A thunderclap resounds,
golden light pierces the earth—
the infant emerges from the crown.
Gradually regulate the spirit,
slowly emerge from the shell.
Piercing metal and penetrating stone,
in an instant, ten thousand miles.
From this, a hundred thousand transformed bodies—
then proceed to face the wall and nurture emptiness.
After nine years, the work is complete,
the celestial decree descends,
the body flies to the golden palace—
this is what is meant by:
"After nine transformations, ascend to heaven,
forever a celestial immortal, living ten thousand springs."]*

Three stages of the work—
I have clearly explained them to you.
Now I personally unseal and release them,
composing this book to embody the secret method.

*[The work of refining the elixir has three stages.
The first barrier: refining the self and laying the foundation.
The middle barrier: refining qi to transform the spirit.
The upper barrier: refining the spirit to return to emptiness.
These three stages of the work
have never been spoken of by anyone in the past.
Now I have clearly revealed them,
personally unsealed and released them,
elaborating them into a book.
Those who are determined to pursue this Way
should embody and recognize the true secret,
practice it diligently,
and naturally enter the sage’s realm,
transcending the common herd.]*

Transmitted to the children of true refinement—
a method of gold and jade.
The elixir’s true secret is taught by the master—
it must be discussed with immortals.

Here is the translation:

---

Now, the secret method that has remained unspoken for ten thousand ages is revealed and compiled into this book, transmitted to the children of true refinement. This book is truly a golden and jade-like method, a precious raft for ascending the clouds. Yet, though this is its general outline, it is not easily heard. As for the mystery within the mystery, the subtlety within the subtlety, it must be received through the oral transmission of a true master. As the saying goes, "The true string must be taught by a true immortal." Common people, interpreting texts by their words alone, often err and mislead. Why not seek a master with resolve and spirit? In the end, you will surely encounter one. This is what is meant by *"You must discuss it carefully with immortals."*

There is yet another wondrous elixir method,
but I fear revealing too much would make it seem trivial.
It is like plucking the zither and striking the se,
husband and wife harmonizing their natures.

*[The profound and subtle mechanisms are not limited to one method. There is another elixir method, uniquely wondrous. Yet I fear revealing it entirely would cause those who hear it to dismiss its marvel. What is this method? It is the method of plucking the zither and striking the se. As the poem says: "When husband and wife are in harmony, it is like the zither and se played together." The zither is not played alone; the se must be struck in unison. In the Way of nature and emotion, harmony comes first, and mutual resonance follows. The *Canticle* says: "Push emotion to unite with nature, turning and joining together." How could the subtlety of the elixir method be easily understood?]*

Rosy light illumines the winding waters,
the red sun rises over Kunlun.
Vague and indistinct, dim and obscure—
within this, there is true certainty,
and when certainty arrives, you will surely be startled.

*[Metal and water shine brilliantly, wood and fire blaze red. The golden crow emerges from the sea, the jade hare ascends the sky. The sun rises in the east over Fusang, casting its glow upon the winding waters. The winding waters are the Qujiang River. The *Linjiang Immortal* says: "Upon Qujiang, the moon’s radiance is pure and bright, and there flies a crow." Laozi said: "Vague and indistinct, yet within it there is form; dim and obscure, yet within it there is essence. Its essence is utterly true, and within it there is certainty." Certainty means adherence to the unerring timing. "When certainty arrives, you will surely be startled" means that when the moment arrives, the wondrous principle manifests of itself, and the medicine’s emergence is divinely known. This vague indistinctness and dim obscurity describe the scene of obtaining the medicine—when the primordial qi arrives and the Supreme Ultimate begins to take shape.]*

A single drop like a vermilion orange,
it must be met by quicksilver.
No instruments are used at all—
the method inverts heaven and earth.

*[At the moment of the returning elixir, a visible form appears—a single drop falls into the Yellow Court, shaped like a vermilion orange or a pellet. Quicksilver is mercury. When the elixir arrives, one must move a drop of true mercury to receive it. Once it arrives, it becomes the master: the husband sings first, the wife follows after, inverting yin and yang, reversing the workings of creation. This is what is called "two layers of heaven and earth, four aspects of yin and yang." The *Three-Character Formula* says: "The great key lies in inversion: I become the guest, and it becomes the host." Instruments refer to the zither and sword. Once the elixir returns to the crucible and the tally is complete, the fire is stilled—no instruments are used, only this wondrous mechanism. Countless learners in the world—how could they number less than ten thousand times ten thousand? Yet who truly knows? Knowing is not difficult; what matters is accumulating abundant merit and performing acts of kindness. Where your resolve lies, heaven will respond, and immortals will surely become your teachers.]*

The world does not understand the principle,
practicing the Three Peaks’ sexual arts,
some speak of the Three Passes,
others enter the furnace and face the moment—
even mouth-to-mouth,
filthy and unbearable to hear.
All conditioned methods
are the people of hell.

*[The world, failing to grasp the profound principle, sees in the elixir scriptures phrases like "mouth to mouth, aperture to aperture, do not disdain the filth, do not calculate the cost," and guesses it refers to the female crucible, practicing the Three Peaks’ sexual arts, the method of nine shallow and one deep. They beautify it with names like "Pengzu’s bedchamber arts." Some speak of the Three Passes—rear upper, front lower—while others engage in inner alchemy with women, facing the furnace and consuming filth, mouth-to-mouth. How vile and unbearable! All such side doors are this filthy and foul. They are all seeds of hell, beyond salvation. True masters are hard to meet, true methods hard to obtain. Those with resolve should diligently accumulate virtue.]*

There are those who cling stubbornly,
believing dead stillness to be true.
Their hair turns yellow, their teeth fall out,
their bodies like magpies, their forms like cranes.

*[Some fools, stubborn and unyielding, cling rigidly to stillness, believing it to be the unshakable truth. They practice bitter austerities, sitting day and night, causing their qi and blood to stagnate. Their bodies become like magpies, their forms like cranes, emaciated as sticks. Even when their hair turns yellow and their teeth fall out, they still do not awaken—how lamentable! The reason for this is that people commonly see Daoist practitioners as unmarried and unofficed, sitting alone in remote mountains, dwelling deep in valleys, empty and desiccated in their stillness, calling it "cultivating the truth." They also see in novels that entering the mountains to cultivate the Dao means becoming an immortal. How could they know that sitting until old age and death is all in vain? Ultimately, this comes from not carefully reading the elixir scriptures. When Zhang Sanfeng met the Fire Dragon Immortal, he was given a secret method and told to leave the mountains quickly to seek karmic conditions. Thus, *A Branch of Flowers* says: "I was commanded to leave the mountains, to seek companions and find lead." The Stone Immortal of Apricot Grove told Xue Zixian: "Go to the bustling cities and rely on those with power to assist you." Since ancient times, true immortals have all emerged from among people, sought from among the wealthy and powerful. The ancients had to leave the mountains, yet people today insist on entering them; the ancients all worked through action, yet people today only speak of non-doing. So many contradictions, running counter to the Dao. Stubbornly clinging to dead stillness, they die without regret. Why not read the *Scripture of Purity and Stillness*, which says: "Such purity and stillness gradually enter the true Dao; though it is called attaining the Dao, in reality, nothing is attained."]*

To transform sentient beings—this is called attaining the Dao. The text elaborates at length, reaching the utmost purity and stillness, yet suddenly appends a line: "Those who awaken to this may transmit the sacred Dao." Even at such purity and stillness, there is still transmission—why do people remain so unaware? In short, they are accustomed to the common principles of the human world and fail to witness the marvels of sages and spirits; this again hinges on the depth or shallowness of one’s innate capacity.

He knows not our Dao,
mistaking the false for true.
Observe heaven’s great Dao,
grasp heaven’s great workings.

[Annotation: All heterodox schools cling rigidly to their own views. How could they know the subtlety of our Dao—borrowing the false to cultivate the true, turning the false into the real? The *Scripture of Unconscious Unison* says: "Observe heaven’s Dao, grasp heaven’s workings—this is perfection." Heaven and earth form one great yin-yang; the human body, one small yin-yang. The heavens have Greater Yin and Greater Yang; the body, Lesser Yin and Lesser Yang—their principles are identical. The scripture states: "Simply focus the heart on emulating heaven. The movements of heaven and earth, sun and moon, the wondrous functions of Kan and Li in the body, the four cardinal gates of mystery—who truly understands these?"]

The moon hangs over the western river,
rosy clouds touch the southern shores.
Three days before is the dark of the moon—
pure yin within yang.

[Annotation: "The moon hangs over the western river" depicts the white moon atop the mountain, an image of fresh, tender medicinal sprouts. "Rosy clouds touch the southern shores" shows the red sun at the pool’s bottom, an image of vanquished yin demons. *Awakening to Reality* says: "On the southwestern path, the moon’s brilliance shines—great medicine arises from this place." The western river is where lead is produced; the southern Li is the source of fire. "Three days before" refers to the three days prior to *geng*. The "dark of the moon" is the day before the new moon. Thus, "three days before is the dark" signifies the moment before the living *zi* hour, the end of *hai*. At this time, the great medicine is about to emerge—what is called "the appearance of lead’s light three days prior" occurs precisely at the height of yin.]

---
Three days after is the new moon—
yang essence within yin.
Just as winter solstice arrives,
harmonious scenes herald a fine spring.

[Annotation: "Three days after" refers to the three days following *jia*, when the dark of the moon ends and the new moon begins, the transition from the end of *hai* to the start of *zi*. At this moment, yin reaches its extreme and yang is born, a single yang rising from beneath the ninefold earth—akin to the seasonal winter solstice. The winter solstice is heaven and earth’s true *zi* hour; the "yang essence" is the body’s living *zi* hour. When yang returns, the great earth becomes spring, radiant with vibrant light and vitality. The arrival of true yang in the body is like the sun rising over Fusang, its crimson glow suffusing the earth. Three hundred sixty joints, eighty-four thousand pores—all melt into harmony, a sweet, unbounded ease, the whole body bathed in spring.]

---
The eighth day is the first quarter,
inquire at the rabbit’s gate of *mao*.
The sixteenth is the beginning of *gou*,
the twenty-third is the gate of *you*.
Through this, examine the *Yi* hexagrams—
only then can you know the true Great Dao.

[Annotation: The new moon’s first quarter occurs on the eighth day of the month; the waning moon’s last quarter, on the twenty-third. *Mao* belongs to the rabbit, *you* to the rooster. These two hours are the gates of punishment and virtue, the moments of bathing—know that bathing at *mao* benefits mercury, while bathing at *you* benefits lead. The third day of the new moon marks the first return of a single yang; after the sixteenth day of the full moon, a single yin begins to *gou*. *The Union* says: "On the eighth day, *dui* receives *ding*, the first quarter level as a string; on the fifteenth, the *qian* body is complete, fullness in *jia* to the east; on the sixteenth, the mandate shifts, *xun*’s *xin* appears at dawn; *gen* aligns with *bing* to the south, the last quarter on the twenty-third." Scholars who study this principle and examine the *Yi* hexagrams will recognize that the Great Dao possesses its own truth—it cannot be falsified.]

---
A hundred verses in this chapter,
each word demands careful study.
This book is guarded by thunder gods—
those who obtain it must not treat it lightly.

[Annotation: This book contains one hundred verses. Within these hundred verses—five hundred characters in all—each is a luminous pearl, every word profoundly subtle. Scholars must seek the text’s meaning, ponder its phrases, and silently grasp its principles. To transcend the ordinary and become a sage, to hold the secret and mysterious mechanism—this is what heaven treasures. This chapter reveals the celestial mechanism in full, and thunder spirits guard this true formula. Readers must not dismiss it as mere casual speech. Revere it—do not neglect!]

**III. The Song of the True Scripture**

The Song of the True Scripture, the Song of the True Scripture—
those who fail to recognize the True Scripture are all possessed by demons.
Each person seeks meaning in the written word,
and many chant ceaselessly without end.

[Annotation: *True* is spoken in contrast to *false*. The *True Scripture* is the scripture of cultivating the True. In truth, the True Scripture has no written form—it exists before the primal chaos, before the beginning of the dark and yellow, before the Supreme Ultimate, as the ancestor of primordial qi. All heavenly immortals and buddhas: in their coming, none could enter the world without this scripture; in their going, none could leave the world without it. It is the root-source that gives birth to heaven and earth, to humans and the myriad things. Immortals and buddhas refine it to ascend; ghosts and spirits exist because of it. The sacred assemblies of the numinous altars, the blessed lands of the grotto-heavens—all are shaped by the True Governor of creation. The ten thousand affairs and principles of the world, the forms that arise from nonbeing, the qi that dissolves into being—none do not emerge from it. Great indeed is the True Scripture! It is beyond conception, beyond naming.

The common person uses it to bear sons and raise daughters, cherishing it as a trifle; the perfected one uses it to extend life and attain the True, treasuring it as sacred. This thing is abundant—whether in foreign lands or China, regardless of wealth or poverty, it fills the earth without exception. It is the blue sky beneath the roof, the living path before one’s eyes. Yet without a true teacher’s guidance, none can know its wondrous use.

People, failing to recognize its wondrous use, thus fall entirely into demonic paths—such as swallowing cinnabar and consuming filth, or engaging in sexual arts with women. These are the seeds of hell, deeds that prevent rebirth for ten thousand kalpas. Why do they enter these demonic ranks and suffer such demonic obstructions? Only because they do not recognize the True Scripture.

There are those who rely on textual exegesis, seeking profound principles solely in words and phrases, probing the trigrams for symbolic meanings, chanting endlessly—yet they remain a thousand miles from the Dao.]

Holding scriptures and incantations, reciting ritual codes,
arranging them on paper in hope of liberation—
if such means could transcend life and death,
then every monk on earth would become a buddha.

[Annotation: Holding incantations and reciting scriptures, following ritual procedures, seeking liberation solely through words and texts—this is to assume the true formula lies on paper. If such practices could free one from the sea of suffering, transcend the ordinary, and enter sagehood, resolving the great matter of life and death, then all beings on earth, and the countless monks who chant scriptures and incantations, would have long since become buddhas. Yet since ancient times, none have attained immortality or buddhahood through mere recitation—thus, the true path must lie elsewhere.]

Obtain the True Scripture, and emerge from the vast waves;
without the True Scripture, there is no recourse.
If you ask where the True Scripture truly lies—
in the primordial creation, nothing more.

[Annotation: The above passages allude to the scripture’s name and meaning; only now is its wondrous nature directly revealed. This True Scripture is most difficult to obtain. If one gains it, one may escape the vast waves. People drift in the sea of suffering, tossed by the currents without end. This scripture is the precious raft of the vast waves, the compassionate ferry to the other shore. Without it, there is truly no method—what can one do about these vast waves?

If one asks where the true and wondrous essence of this scripture lies, it is simply in seeking the primordial creation, the authentic mechanism of the mysterious. Its principle is most subtle, its practice most simple—there is truly nothing more to it.]

To follow the flow is death, to reverse the course is life—yet often you seek in vain.
The True Scripture originally bears not a single word,
yet it can ferry all beings beyond the Great Veil.

Dao of immortals and Dao of humanity differ only in following or reversing;
thus the *Yi* speaks of "reversing the reckoning."
To follow is to generate humans and creatures;
to reverse is to become immortal or Buddha.
It is also said: the Five Phases flowing forward make a fiery pit of the dharma-realm;
the Five Phases flowing in reverse bring undying longevity.
The human path begins with an initial spark,
proceeds to a wailing cry at birth,
then infancy, childhood, youth, maturity, old age, and death—
this is the forward flow of conditioned existence.
The immortal path returns from old age to youth,
then to the fetal state, to the Supreme Ultimate, to the Ultimateless—
this is the reverse flow of unconditioned existence.
Ten thousand volumes of alchemical scriptures speak only of principle.
Hence it is said: "Because alchemical scriptures lack oral instructions,
where can you form the numinous embryo?"
Though reversal may bring life,
its method is not transmitted,
often leaving seekers groping in the dark, unable to find it.
Know that this scripture is not a scripture of written words,
but the tides of the great ocean, where the moon never misses its appointed time.
As the *Cantong Qi* says: "Revolving through the twelve nodes,
when one cycle ends, you must draw near again."
This scripture alone can deliver all beings,
ascending them to the realm of the Three Pure Ones in the Great Veil.

To obtain the True Scripture and deliver yourself,
nothing suffices but the harmony of two like kinds.
Whether generating heaven, earth, or humanity,
how could it depart from the nest of yin-yang transformation?

The True Scripture’s secrets are not easily heard.
Out of compassion, the Patriarch speaks plainly to you, ordinary beings:
if you seek the True Scripture to deliver yourself,
I now directly point it out to you—
nothing suffices but the use of like kinds in mutual harmony.
Who, then, is the counterpart?
As the Patriarch does not fail to say:
"A broken pot must be mended with iron,
tattered clothes must be held together with cloth.
If a person’s vitality is damaged yet lacks the true golden qi,
how could one in ten thousand ever revive?"
The *Wuzhen Pian* says:
"A broken bamboo must be mended with bamboo,
to hatch a chick you must use an egg.
All efforts with unlike kinds are wasted labor—
how could they compare to true lead uniting with the sacred mechanism?"
It also says:
"Tattered clothes must be mended with cloth,
a weakened person must be restored with lead."
The *Cantong Qi* says:
"To prepare the elixir of immortality,
you must use substances of the same kind."
And again:
"Like kinds are easily worked,
unlike kinds cannot be skillfully employed.
Only like kinds follow one another—
without this, the work will not yield treasure."
Thus swallows do not hatch phoenixes,
foxes and hares do not nurse foals—
because they are not of the same kind.
Since it is called "like kinds" and "mutual harmony,"
the meaning is clear—what further doubt could there be?
If cultivators of the Dao truly seek by means of like kinds,
the qi of wondrous transformation will naturally arise.
This is how humanity is generated,
and how heaven, earth, and the myriad things are generated.
The *Lingbao Bifa* says:
"The Dao-qi resides entirely within the human body,
able to transform and generate all heavens,
illuminating the Three Luminaries."
Yin and yang are themselves like kinds;
only with yin and yang does transformation arise.
When transformation is spoken of as a "nest,"
there must be an aperture within it.

To speak of the true scripture is not to indulge in emptiness—
in the ravines of the Western Riverbed, yellow gold is born.
Five thousand and forty [days] return to the Yellow Way,
precisely matching one volume of the *Great Treasury of Scriptures*.

When the days are fulfilled and the qi-cycles align,
earth responds with tides, heaven responds with stars.
The First Patriarch Bodhidharma personally transmitted it,
the true, wondrous, and subtle Dharma of the *Lotus Sutra*.

The lotus is hollow within yet straight without,
emerging from filth yet unstained.
The Buddha said: "In this world of the five defilements,
I cultivated and attained the Great Way—
arising from the mire, not from purity."
The true, wondrous, and subtle Dharma is sought within this.

On the third day, the *Zhen* trigram emerges with *geng*,
above the Winding River, the moon’s radiance gleams bright.
Flower buds just unfurl, bearing pearls of dew;
in tiger’s den and dragon’s lair, one probes the turbid and the clear.

Water begets two, the elixir is true—
wait for three, and it cannot advance.
*Ren*-water first arrives, *gui* has yet to come:
swiftly gather it, discerning its rise and fall.

The golden crucible refines, the jade furnace smelts,
with gentle, warming embers, softly glowing.
The true scripture pierces the Mysterious Pass in a single shot,
like an arrow striking the red center of the target.

The body grows hot, as if steamed in a basket;
turning the light inward, it illumines the Central Palace.
Once the true scripture is attained, one is drunk as with wine—
breath and pulse return to their root, all hundred channels restored.

Essence enters *qi*, *qi* transforms into spirit;
after seven days in chaos, the soul returns anew.
Such is the true workings of creation’s message—
how few in the world dare to speak of it.

Alive within death, dead yet reborn:
since ancient times, immortals and buddhas have relied on the true scripture.
Whoever grasps this work of creation
shall ferry all beings across the Jambu continent.

And it further states:
*"Sentient beings descend to sow the seed,
By cause in the ground, the fruit is born again;
The insentient are of five kinds,
Without nature, they too are unborn."*

As in the Dragon Girl offering the pearl,
the earth surging with golden lotuses,
the earth surging with the jeweled pagoda,
or the perfection of the Tathāgata’s *māraṇa-guhya* form—
are these different from what is not different?
Yet today’s monks rarely engage in true cultivation.
The patriarchs, in their compassion, have all pointed this out.

If one can know this true scripture and practice this work of creation,
though the Jambu continent be vast, all may at once become immortals and buddhas.
The scripture says:
*"Were the common folk all to know this,
the world’s immortals would flow like water."*

The Great Dao abides first in the Supreme Ultimate,
originating before father and mother.
To ferry others, one must ferry them with the true scripture—
if asked what the true scripture is, *gui* is lead.

**[Annotation:**
Beyond the Supreme Ultimate lies the source of the Great Dao,
before father and mother.
As the *Cantong Qi* says: *"Original essence spreads like clouds,
borne by qi at the beginning."*
The patriarchs say: *"Exhaustively seek the moment of receiving qi at birth."*
Before birth, it is not like the Buddhists’ discourse on emptiness
or awakening to the absence of self—
one must awaken to the very inception of the self.

To ferry others, one must ferry them with the true scripture;
there is no other method besides this.
Knowing this scripture, the crucible, furnace, talismans, and fire
are all contained within it.
The Celestial Root and the Moon Cavern all arise from this.

If one asks what the true scripture is—
lead is *gui*, and *gui* is the scripture.
Compassion, compassion! I would weep,
weeping for all the aspirants in the world who fall short of their aim.

In vain they endure hardship, stubbornly sit in meditation,
failing to meet the right conditions,
suffering a lifetime of toil,
only to grow old without achievement—how pitiful!
Refining the mortal to enter sagehood is the greatest of matters,
rarely encountered in a lifetime.

May the worthy and wise of the world
broadly sow fields of merit,
cultivate hidden virtues,
seek a teacher to reveal the lead within water—
naturally, understanding one thing will open a hundred,
resolving one will settle all,
and one shall become true.

**IV. The Crucible’s Song**

**IV. The Crucible’s Song**

The crucible is none other than the body of Heaven and Earth,
the great elixir is nothing but essence, qi, and spirit.
If you can gather and refine them into one,
you must employ three like-minded people.

Three people—no other way—
only with a true teacher and true oral instructions,
who reveals the three-grade elixir of yin and yang,
can you then settle the mind and await the bright moon.

Await the bright moon, yet do not delay:
gather body and mind to first lay the foundation.
Split open the dust-laden heart, cast off the karmic net,
expel the five leakages, slay the three corpses.

Slay the three corpses, and the sword is forged;
refine the self to attain numinous knowing—then the signs appear.

**IV. The Crucible’s Song (continued)**

With hardness and softness transformed at will,
you drive away demons for ten thousand leagues swift as lightning.
*[Note: The three corpses are spirits dwelling in the flesh and blood of the human body. They do not wish for human life but thrive on human death. Whenever one acts recklessly in anger or surrenders to lust without restraint, it is these spirits that secretly stoke the fire, stirring chaos to overturn one’s resolve—hence the inevitable regret afterward. These corpses are the greatest hindrance to the Dao. The upper corpse resides in the brain, the middle in the abdomen, and the lower in the kidneys—collectively known as the Three Peng. Those who cultivate the Dao must first slay the three corpses. As *The Wuzhen Pian* states: "Only when the three corpses are slain can the Dao be attained." Yet they cannot be severed by blades of bronze or iron; only the sword of wisdom can seal the leaks. This sword is possessed by all, though few are willing to wield it. Forged by intent and wielded without form, it aids in refining the self until, over time, numinous resonance arises. Able to be firm or yielding, to bend or extend, it transforms at the heart’s command, driving away demons for ten thousand leagues with the speed of lightning.]*

Swift as lightning, the sword gains its numinous power,
then hang it in the south to guard the crystal waters.
Should yin ghosts rise from the north,
a single stroke severs all without mercy.
*[Note: Only when the sword moves like lightning is it called "numinous." It is hung in the south—the position of *li* (fire). The "crystal waters" signify a heart as clear as water. Without this sword’s support, it is impossible to remain unstained by even a speck of dust. Know that this path is like extracting treasure from a den of ghosts, where yin spirits follow at every step. As Master Xiao Liaozhen said: "When heretical demons suddenly display their might, brandish the Seven-Star Treasure Sword before you. In the very midst of the ghostly den’s battle, seize the luminous pearl and return." The phrase "without mercy" marks the utmost decisiveness—any hesitation, and the moment is lost. Beware, be vigilant.]*

Without mercy, abide in constant clarity,
the heart’s purity gleaming like a bright mirror.
When the mirror-heart is extinguished, still as empty space,
only then can you face the crucible without flaw.
*[Note: The slightest trace of tender attachment disrupts clarity. To cultivate pure karma, one must sever all private desires, allowing no indulgence, so that the mirror-heart becomes limpid, all thoughts dissolved, equal to empty space. Only then, when facing the crucible before the mirror, can one remain unstained and free of flaws. Otherwise, a single stirring of emotion summons a thousand illusions. At such moments, it all depends on one’s steadfast resolve—then one may tread upon the tiger’s tail without being bitten, and all will proceed smoothly.]*

Free of flaws, the crucible may be set,
harmonize the cauldron’s vessel without haste.
If words fail to connect, they are no true kin—
only when dragon rises and tiger thrives can the work begin.
*[Note: Only when not a speck of dust remains can the crucible and cauldron be established. This cauldron comes from the divine lands of the Red Continent and cannot be obtained without wealth. Even if purchased, it is not immediately usable—one must wait for the appointed days and seasons, then tend to it with meticulous care. It cannot be employed with a rough or impatient mind.]*

To commune in speech is to become kin,
yet one must await the thriving of dragon and tiger—
only then may the dragon be driven to the tiger,
and in turn, the tiger seize the dragon.
If the moment of their flourishing has not arrived,
do not act recklessly, for only in their vigor may the work begin.

Once the work may begin, observe the return,
and hew open the aperture of primordial chaos.
Watch in stillness the tiger’s roar and the dragon’s song,
and naturally the divine water of the Flowery Pond will arrive.

When the divine water arrives, discern its rising and sinking,
lest the hour pass and your efforts be in vain.
When lead meets the birth of *gui*, hasten to gather it;
when gold nears its fullness, it is no longer fit for intimacy.

If unfit for intimacy, do not recklessly take—
earth will split and mountains crumble, and you will lose control.
He who knows not when to cease courts peril;
in midsummer, bitter frost; in deep winter, scorching heat.

If scorching winter is not encountered,
guard the Three Treasures within the firm pass.
The Great Ultimate naturally generates transformation—
seize the moment to guide and convey it into the Yellow Palace.

Entering the Yellow Palace, tend it with care.

In the tenth month, water and nurture—do not miss the moment.
At *zi*, advance the Yang fire, tiger and dragon unite;
at *wu*, retreat the Yin tally, naturally preserve and secure.

[Note: The central divine chamber is called the Yellow Court.
Once the elixir enters here, it is called the divine elixir entering the crucible.
*The Wuzhen Pian* says: "Send it back to the earthen crucible, firmly sealed."
From this point, tend it with watering and nurture,
practicing the fire times of the great celestial cycle.
As before, advance the Yang fire at *zi*,
retreat the Yin tally at *wu*.
When Yang fire advances, tiger and dragon unite;
when Yin tally retreats, naturally preserve and secure.
This marks the boundary between dual cultivation and solitary practice.
Without a true teacher, how could one comprehend it?]

Preserve and secure, then briefly part,
sit upright, forget words, and await the hour.
Like spokes converging at the hub, cycling without end,
three hundred and sixty—do not miss the appointed time.

[Note: In solitary preservation, dragon and tiger briefly separate.
*The Cantong Qi* says: "Within, nurture the self,
abide in stillness and emptiness."
This is the meaning of sitting upright and forgetting words.
"Await the hour" refers to *The Rootless Tree*:
"Once unloaded, it will reopen at a fixed time."
*The Cantong Qi* says: "Cycle through the twelve nodes,
when one ends, begin anew."
Like spokes converging at the hub, cycling without end,
beginning again when finished.
Three hundred and sixty is the total number of the Qian and Kun hexagrams.
Qian’s number is two hundred and sixteen;
Kun’s number is one hundred and forty-four.
At *zi*, thirty-six advances, accumulating one hundred and eighty Yang lines;
at *wu*, twenty-four retreats, totaling one hundred and twenty Yin tallies.
This is Yang lines using nine—four nines make thirty-six;
Yin lines using six—four sixes make twenty-four.
Excluding *mao* and *you* for bathing, these are the numbers of the celestial cycle,
the measured limits of wondrous practice—one must not be ignorant of them.]

Do not miss the appointed time, for it sets the rule.
To awaken to the true principle, one must accord with it.
If you cling to the movement of lines and images,
you may only exhaust the spirit and wear the body thin.

[Note: Do not miss the appointed time—set the fixed limit, unalterable.
Take it as the rule. To cultivate the wondrous Dao,
first accord with the wondrous mechanism.
This true mechanism must be matched precisely—do not cling.
If you do not thoroughly awaken to the subtle mystery,
clinging to the text and fixating on images,
counting the clepsydra, weighing the lines,
the body will wear thin and the spirit labor in vain,
all effort wasted to old age.
This is all due to failing to awaken to the supreme principle within the mystery,
falling into error and confusion,
mistaking oneself for wisdom—all to no avail in the end.
Know this: without a true teacher’s guidance, not one in ten thousand will succeed.]

The body worn thin, yet the work persists,
but the heart’s machinations may not yet be at rest.
If thoughts of longing for the true err by a hair’s breadth,
lead dissolves, mercury scatters, and the elixir will not form.

[Note: "Persists" refers to the work of advancing and retreating, of small going and great coming.
When the body is worn thin and old age renders one unfit,
if one can practice this advancing and retreating,
naturally one will grow stronger day by day, with daily results.
Those who cannot do so are unsettled in mind,
a thousand worries and ten thousand anxieties leaving not a moment’s peace.
Refining lead and cooking mercury depend entirely on a still heart and a tranquil spirit.
The slightest thought or worry is already an error.
*The Mirror for Compounding the Medicine* says: "Err by a hair’s breadth, and the elixir will not form."
*The Wuzhen Pian* says: "A hair’s difference, and the elixir will not be made." This is the meaning.]

If the elixir does not form, reflect on refining the self,
for all is lost through failing to grasp the principle within the mystery.
When water dries and fire scorches, adjust and harmonize;
when punishment and virtue arrive at the gate, know when to advance and retreat.

[Note: The elixir’s failure to form is entirely due to the self not being sufficiently refined.
The ancients said: "If the self is not sufficiently refined, dare not return the elixir."
The work of refining the self is vast indeed!
It is said: "Cultivating immortality has limits; refining the self has none."
The two words "refining the self" are the great key,
the great function, the great foundation of elixir cultivation.
There has never been one who did not first refine the self and yet could return the elixir.
The deluded and ignorant, failing to understand,
rashly attempt the work of the twelve hours—few do not stumble.
Water and fire must be balanced, not allowed to dominate.]

Fire blazes and turns parched, water overflows and spills—all hinges on harmonizing to the mean.
When punishment and virtue arrive at the gate, they stand at the threshold of life and death.
This is the moment of bathing; one must know when to advance and retreat, never transgressing the measure.

Knowing advance and retreat, fear no misfortune—
within the crucible, a single crimson point is refined.
A child is born, its *qi* of *dui*-metal full,
three years of nurturing leave it dull as the deaf and mute.

The Dao of the elixir first demands knowing advance and retreat, fortune and misfortune.
"Advance and retreat" refer to advancing the fire and retreating the tally.
Receiving *qi* brings fortune; error brings misfortune.
If advance and retreat are clear, never overstepping the rule, fortune comes without misfortune—
a grain of golden elixir glows crimson in the crucible.
When the ten-month gestation is complete, the infant emerges from the crown,
the *qi* of *dui*-metal fulfilled—here it must be born.
Thereafter, three years of nursing care differ little from prior nurturing.
Worldly affairs and mundane attachments are utterly cast off, as if deaf and mute.

Seeming deaf and mute, yet truly joyous—
in stillness, the spirit is tuned to leave the husk.
East, west, south, north—roam freely,
entering and exiting, riding a white crane.

People see him as dull and witless,
devoid of lively spirit—how could they know
he wears coarse cloth yet holds jade within,
concealing priceless treasure?
In the realm of nothingness, the boundless sea of extinction—
true joy, who can know it?
Who attains this may here refine the spirit to depart the shell.
Thus: by morning roaming the Northern Sea, by evening lodging in Cangwu,
gazing upon the famous mountains within the six directions,
beholding the diverse winds of the eight quarters,
riding a crane through the sky, coming and going at will—
what joy can compare?

Riding the white crane, free of dust,
the immortals of the Three Isles gather in assembly.
Though mulberry fields turn to azure seas,
my spirit remains untroubled, poised in the numinous terrace.

The preceding verse speaks of the Dao perfected and virtue accomplished, lying in wait for the appointed time;
this verse tells of the Great One’s summons, moving to dwell in the Central Continent.
Shedding the mortal dust, ascending to the immortal realm.
The Three Isles lie in the sea, where immortals gather—
their lifespan spans myriad eons.
Henceforth, though seas turn to mulberry fields,
my numinous terrace remains serene,
wandering freely in the realm of true light and dharma—boundless and endless!

Accumulating merit and virtue to transcend the mortal world,
yet still manifesting transformations to guide the deluded masses—
only then are a man’s aspirations fulfilled.

The ranks of immortals vary by the magnitude of merit.
Thus the Yellow Emperor, considering great deeds, descended to the world:
first life as a commoner, next as a minister, then as a sovereign.
Therefore, in the mortal realm, one accumulates virtue and merit—
in the celestial realm of purity, building merit is difficult;
in the turbid world of men, establishing merit is easy.
No immortal or buddha lacks compassion,
wandering the dusty world to save the suffering,
now manifesting miracles, now silently aiding,
guiding the deluded across the sea of transformation.
As it is said: only after delivering all beings does one become a buddha.
Then, with merit accomplished and name fulfilled,
the heart of a great man, the aspirations of a heroic man—
all is resolved in this moment.
What greater virtue or grander achievement could surpass this?

Five: The Song of Gathering Gold

Dao, Dao, Dao—no artifice, no subtlety;
Mystery, mystery, mystery—no need for many words.
Unlocking the gates, unfolding the apertures is not hard.

[Note: The word *Dao* is itself but a forced name.
It existed before heaven and earth, and endures after them.
It is the stem of the formless, the root of the Supreme Ultimate.
No single thing *is* the Dao, yet no single thing *is not* the Dao.
Most utterly ordinary, utterly without artifice or subtlety.
The word *mystery* speaks of a principle profound yet subtle,
yet the matter itself is utterly simple.
Fifty hundred words cannot exhaust it; half a phrase suffices.
Ancestor Yuchan said: "Half a word, a single phrase, and mystery is penetrated—
what need for alchemical texts in the tens of thousands?"
He also said: "The oral instructions contain few words,
all held within half a phrase."
Though the work of unlocking the gates and unfolding the apertures exists,
it is, in truth, easy.
Only let the heart be steadfast, and nothing is difficult.
The *gates* are the Three Passes; the *apertures* are the Mysterious Aperture.
As the alchemical classics say: "When the Mysterious Aperture opens, all apertures open;
the Three Passes are penetrated without labor."]

Discern the female and male, keep both swords whole,
lay the foundation, refine the self, and gather the postnatal.
Though the postnatal is called impure substance,
first ingest the postnatal, then the prenatal.

[Note: The two swords, female and male, have been with us since birth,
worn upon the body—not bestowed by any master.
Few comprehend this principle, and fewer still can wield them.
Wield them to lay the foundation, and the foundation is laid;
wield them to return the elixir, and the work is accomplished.
*Laying the foundation* means gathering the prenatal within the postnatal—
the art of extending life and prolonging the years.
*Returning the elixir* means gathering the prenatal within the prenatal—
the task of becoming a buddha or attaining immortality.
The prenatal arises from the formless; the postnatal emerges from impure substance.
The prenatal is without form; the postnatal has substance.
Both are but a single *qi*, yet differ in their prenatal and postnatal nature.
*The Mirror of Ingesting the Medicine* says: "Prenatal *qi*, postnatal *qi*—
he who obtains them is ever as though drunk."]

This wondrous instruction must be transmitted by a master;
without a true teacher, all effort is in vain.

Advancing the work of *laying the foundation*,
the firing times of *zhun* and *meng* require withdrawal and addition.
**[Note: To study this Dao, one must first thoroughly understand the true instructions.
These instructions are not transmitted without a master. Should the foolish and deluded gain but a partial or superficial grasp, they may attempt to practice—yet how could they fathom the profound and subtle principles? Without a true teacher to unfold each step and guide every inch, all effort remains in vain.
At the initial barrier, advancing to lay the foundation demands bold and relentless progress—no retreat, only true achievement. The firing times advance and withdraw according to the hexagrams. *Zhun* at dawn, *meng* at dusk, each day encompassing two hexagrams. There is withdrawal and addition: withdrawing lead, adding mercury, all governed by fixed principles. *The Perfect Methods of the Numinous Treasure* states: "When it is time to withdraw, do not add."]**

To withdraw and add, recognize true lead—
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, linked in sequence.
Examine the Yellow Path, know the precise target,
and also study the *Five Thousand Words*.
**[Note: The instructions for withdrawal and addition first require identifying true lead without error.
"Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen" refers to the principles for selecting the crucible. Crucibles vary in size, strength, speed, and timing; they cannot be treated uniformly, for their use follows a fixed schedule. "Linked in sequence" means extending by category, its subtlety lying in examining the Yellow Path and knowing the precise target.
The Yellow Path is the course traversed by the sun and moon; the precise target is like an arrow striking dead center, neither deviating from the plumb line nor transgressing the square. Its essential subtlety lies in studying the scriptures. If one cannot study them alone, the observer must study and then explain.]**

The *Three Hundred Characters of the Yin Talisman* and the *Five Thousand Words of the Dao and Its Virtue* speak of nothing but the wonders of this sutra. Two sevens make the finest. Five thousand and forty-eight align perfectly. To know this is to know the Dao; to practice this is to ascend in flight.

When the medicinal sprout is fresh, observe with care—three days before the lead’s radiance appears. As the *gui*-water approaches, swiftly gather it; a hair’s breadth of error, and the elixir will not form.

**[Annotation: The moon whitens the mountain peak. The medicinal sprout is tender and new, this being the sign of the primordial omen—just the time to observe the sutras with care. As true lead nears, three days prior, its essence-light shines early in the southwest *geng* position, revealing a crescent’s trace. As the *Canticle* says: "In the hidden depths, an image appears; the essence-light manifests." At this moment, as *gui*-water approaches, one must urgently apply the work of gathering, lest the slightest deviation occur. A hair’s error, and the elixir will not form. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* states: "A hair’s breadth off, the elixir will not form."]**

Before gathering the medicine, establish the framework. At the time of union, employ the bellows. Use the bellows, drawing it near to your body—heed not the celestial bodies, or your efforts are in vain.

**[Annotation: As the great medicine is about to emerge, the work of gathering may begin. First, before gathering, establish the framework. The framework is that of the bellows. In the union of *kan* and *li*, the bellows must be used. This instrument for gathering medicine is called the handle of the Great Ultimate, the essential tool for entering the chamber and applying the work. The *Mirror of Entering the Medicine* says: "Above, the magpie bridge; below, the magpie bridge. Heaven responds to the stars, earth to the tides." The method of its use is neither far from the person nor distant from the self—just as *qian* and *kun* are heaven and earth, *kan* and *li* are the sun and moon, their bodies paired as yin and yang, their movements circulating water and fire. Failing to model oneself on heaven and earth is to labor in vain, climbing a tree to seek fish, exhausting the spirit to no purpose.]**

Know when *gui* is born, understand when *gui* appears—thirty *shichen* span two and a half days. Gathering occurs in but a single *shichen*, the six *hou* manifest in only two. [Note: If one truly knows the precise moment when *gui* is born and the direction from which it emerges, within these two and a half days and thirty *shichen*, the true celestial mechanism lies concealed here. This is what is meant by "gathering has its time, harvesting has its day." Yet this gathering takes but a brief moment, confined to a single *shichen*. *The Awakening to Reality* says: "Within one *shichen* the elixir is complete"—this is that very moment. Divided into six *hou*, the medicine is obtained in the first two; only in these two does the work become evident.]

The remaining four *hou* serve other purposes. When the medicine is obtained, do not covet or disorder. Be as one drunk or dazed, speak sparingly, fasten the gates and locks, secure the enclosure. [Note: One *shichen* is divided into six *hou*. Once the medicine is obtained in the first two and returned to the furnace, the remaining four *hou* involve another crucible and other tasks. The first two *hou* constitute the true work of gathering the medicine; the latter four are the supreme secrets of refinement. As the alchemical classics say: "Two *hou* gather the *mauni*, four *hou* employ divine skill." Yet when the medicine is obtained, one must rectify the mind and sincerely intend, being cautious and reverent, without the slightest stirring of covetous desire, lest the state be thrown into chaos. *The Canticle* says: "The heterodox path is perilous and treacherous, toppling nations and endangering the realm." At this time, be as one drunk or dazed, speak even less, and once the elixir enters the Yellow Court, fasten the gates and locks securely. *The Canticle* says: "Guard and defend with firm resolve, block and sever all perverse influences. The winding chambers connect, to ward against the unforeseen—this is the utmost caution."]

Choose your diet carefully, neither too much nor too little, lest you harm the vessel or invite disorder. Reduce sour and salty flavors, partake only of the bland. The Yellow Dame attends with watchful care. [Note: Eat before hunger arises, stop before fullness—this is the secret of the masters of longevity. *The True Principles of Celestial Immortality* also teaches that regulating diet and calming the body are simple matters. "Choosing your diet carefully" means abstaining from meat and strong flavors, reducing sour and salty tastes, consuming only pure, sprouted teas and plain rice. The elixir is the supreme treasure of the physical form, difficult to obtain and easy to lose. Cherish it at every moment, lest harm befall it and disorder arise. The Yellow Dame’s attendance must be diligent and attentive; she must observe with care, never slackening, lest the moment be missed—this bears the strictest admonition.]

A single lapse in hunger or satiety undoes all prior work: lead scatters, mercury withers, and the two no longer embrace. The ten-month work demands diligent swallowing; when swallowing diligently, guard against danger. [Note: A single careless breath scatters the lead and withers the mercury, disrupting the harmony of yin and yang, transposing dragon and tiger, so they no longer embrace. This all stems from immoderate hunger or satiety. The great celestial cycle of the middle barrier’s ten-month work must never be interrupted; one must swallow and refine diligently, vigilant at every step. Ancestor Zhongli said: "In the year’s bathing, guard against danger; in the ten months’ regulation, exercise utmost caution."]

Once you grasp the principle and comprehend the *Song of Illuminating Nature*, do not regard it as something easily attained.

The perfected transmit it, the unworthy are kept far from it—even ten thousand taels of gold would not be exchanged for it.

[Those who study the Dao must first clarify its principles, then cultivate the work of nature. The Dao’s wonders run deep and abstruse; none awaken to it on their own. Should one encounter a true master and receive verification of this text, awakening to the supreme celestial mechanism, this secret is treasured by Heaven itself, its mysterious law most strict, not easily heard or known. Do not regard it as something easily attained. This song is specially preserved as a ladder to Heaven for later worthies.

The *Kuan* says: *"The Heavenly Dao is not partial, yet it is ever transmitted to the worthy."*

Master Ziyang thrice transmitted it to the unworthy and thrice incurred Heaven’s censure—beware, beware!

Those who receive this transmission will forge an indestructible golden body through ten thousand kalpas, ascend with nine generations of ancestors to the immortal realms, and grant their wives and children boundless blessings. What treasure could compare to ten thousand taels of gold? It is but dust—how could it be worthy of exchange?]
