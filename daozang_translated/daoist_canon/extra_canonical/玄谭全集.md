# 玄谭全集

The *Complete Mystical Discourses* – Zhang Sanfeng states:

The Dao consists in nothing more than the Center. Thus the Confucians speak of "attaining the Center," the Daoists of "guarding the Center," and the Buddhists of "emptiness within the Center." Yet the Center of which Internal Alchemy speaks is the aperture within the aperture—the true Center.

I alone lament that people fail to recognize the Center. Some seek it amid the nine palaces, calling it the "Mud Pill," yet do not find it. Others seek it an inch and three-tenths below the navel, calling it the "Cinnabar Field," yet do not find it. Still others measure the span of eight inches and four-tenths between heart and navel, taking the midpoint of one inch and two-tenths as the Center, or search between the two kidneys, directly opposite the navel wheel—yet do not find it.

Seeking it through form, none can attain it. Then, reversing their approach, they name the barrier the "Mysterious Pass" and the feminine the "Mysterious Transformation"—is this not the valley of the formless, which cannot be sought through form?

Seeking it through the formless, they still cannot attain it. Reversing their approach once more, they say: "Neither clinging to nonbeing nor to being, is it not that which is neither being nor nonbeing, and thus clings to neither the realm of being nor nonbeing?"

Wisdom surpassing that of Yan [Hui] or Min [Sun] would struggle to fathom this. Now I transgress the prohibition and speak of it—not by choice, but of necessity.

For in this era, many immortals descend to be born among men, to save the world. Some take office, some become scholars, some engage in trade or commerce, some follow the Dao, some embrace Buddhism. Thus, I compose this text to present to them, that they may know how to save the world, return to the heavens above, and not fall into the dusty realm—this is my heart’s intent.

The *Outer Landscape* refers to externalizing the body and making it empty and void, first completing the cultivation of *xing* (nature). Zhang Sanfeng said: "The Buddhists complete *xing* but must maintain vegetarian discipline; thus, the Great Void is myself—first empty the body. Once the body is empty, heaven and earth are also empty; once heaven and earth are empty, the Great Void is also empty. When emptiness is emptied of itself, this is true emptiness." He also said: "Nonbeing itself gives rise to heaven and earth; externally, the void is embodied in nonbeing."

The *Inner Landscape* refers to internalizing the body and practicing fetal breathing, first completing the Daoist *Inner Landscape* cultivation of *ming* (life). Zhang Sanfeng said: "The embryo grows through breath, and breath abides through the embryo. Within the aperture is the aperture—this is the true place where immortals abide in breath and the embryo dwells." Though heaven and earth are vast, they are but one embryo, and the revolutions of the sun and moon, the turning of the Dipper’s handle—these are the true breath. Have you not observed the texts of the Three Teachings? The *Book of Changes* says: *"To preserve and sustain one’s nature is the gateway to the Dao and its power."* The *Dao De Jing* says: *"Mysterious and again mysterious—this is the gateway to all wonders."* The *Sutra of Bequeathed Teachings* says: *"Restrain it to one place, and nothing will remain undone."* All these are direct pointers.

When I read without obstruction, I know that the sage and the ordinary are one, and I am no longer deluded by blind men. Sweeping away all side doors, I reorder the mind’s monkey, rekindle my resolve, humble my heart and lower my intent, endure trials and tribulations, seek a true teacher with suffering, and exhaustively pursue the origin of reception. This origin is the primordial ancestor of precelestial existence. It contains a speck of true yin and true yang, born before heaven and earth, at the inception of primordial chaos. This luminous pearl, like a grain of millet, hangs in the midst of perfect emptiness and correctness, radiant and unbounded. Yet those who have not awakened to its meaning are like drunks—every step they take, every move they make, leads to side doors.

This luminous pearl, suspended in emptiness, encompasses all phenomena and gives rise to all things—all are this ⊙. In Daoism, it is called true lead and true mercury. Once attained, it is attained forever. Do not cling to the images of qian and kun, the sun and moon, or male and female. Instead, within one’s own body, set up the furnace and establish the tripod. Refine the self and uphold the heart; when principle is understood and nature is seen, gather the fire and ignite it. Within a single double-hour, a grain of the mysterious pearl appears above the winding river. The moment it enters the mouth of the knife-house, in an instant, one aperture opens and a hundred apertures open with it. Fire spreads through the four limbs, and the entire body—sinews, bones, blood, and flesh—transforms, becoming like external mercury.

At this stage, a hundred days of firing are required to achieve numinous subtlety. Once attained, it is attained forever, with no regression. Abiding in the world while preserving form, refining spirit to return to the void, one becomes one with the Dao.

○ In Buddhism, this is called true emptiness and true suchness, the awakened nature. If one knows the proper starting point, refining demons and seeing nature, in a moment’s effort, the true fire of samadhi arises, returning to the root and restoring the origin. All is perceived as one, heaven and earth are both empty, and a myriad of rosy clouds radiate. The five eyes and six penetrations are achieved, and the indestructible vajra body is forged, completing the mechanism that even ghosts and spirits cannot fathom.

○ In Confucianism, this is the Supreme Ultimate born of the Ultimateless. Considering the external heaven and earth, the Ultimateless is the encompassing boundary of heaven and earth, before the division of the sun and moon, when the four directions and above and below were indistinguishable—a single chaotic mass, like yin mist or water. When the time came and qi was full, it surged and gave rise to the Supreme Ultimate. The Supreme Ultimate is the sun and moon. One must model oneself after heaven and earth, the sun and moon—not seek to gather the sun and moon of heaven and earth. Once the sun and moon are born, heaven and earth separate. The clear qi rises to become heaven, a vast emptiness filled with spirits—all are the radiant light of pure essence. The turbid qi descends to become earth, with mountains, rivers, and people all below. The five grains and all myriad things, though born on earth, all rely on the qi of heaven to come into being.

Heaven’s clear qi is pure yang; earth’s turbid qi is pure yin. Dew descends from heaven—this is yang’s ability to generate yin. The myriad things arise from earth—this is yin’s ability to generate yang. Heaven and earth are a vast emptiness, boundless and infinite. The stars and spirits of heaven move and turn, each in its proper place; the myriad things on earth follow the four seasons and eight solar terms, all arising from emptiness. The sun and moon are the essence of heaven, illuminating the thirty-three heavens above and the nine springs of the Yellow Springs below. They revolve east and west, rise and descend, and the alternation of cold and heat proceeds. The sun is the body of pure yang, containing within it a speck of true yin essence. It pertains to the Green Dragon, the Maiden, jia wood, mercury, the Golden Crow, and the three *hun*—this is the external other. The moon is the body of pure yin, containing within it a speck of true yang. It pertains to the White Tiger, the Infant, geng metal, cinnabar, the Jade Hare, and the seven *po*—this is the internal self.

The creation of the human body mirrors that of heaven and earth. Thus, the human body also possesses a true sun and moon. The Dao is near at hand, yet people seek it afar. The three *hun* belong to *xing* (nature), and nature resides at the edge of heaven. The seven *po* belong to *ming* (life), and life resides at the bottom of the sea. The internal and external communicate—these two words, *xing* and *ming*, resolve the meaning of ten thousand volumes. *Xing* belongs to spirit and is yin; *ming* belongs to qi and is yang. Thus it is said: *"One yin and one yang—this is the Dao."* If one does not know that speck of true yin, how can one ever know and reach that speck of true yang?

Scholars of today not only fail to recognize true yang but also remain ignorant of true yin. Yet if one knows true yin, true yang is naturally known as well. Without encountering a true teacher, all efforts are spent in vain conjecture—though the Dao exists within heaven and earth, even heaven and earth do not comprehend it.

Scholars exhaustively investigate the wondrous apertures of the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—within the body, as well as the true workings of yin and yang within and without. If the essential meaning eludes them, upon seeing the varied names in texts, they lack firm understanding, cling to side paths, and cannot discern the principle. Unable to fathom the principle, the heart remains unilluminated; with the heart unilluminated, the celestial nature cannot shine like the bright moon. If one cannot see nature, how can one know life?

Alas! The alchemical classics lack oral transmission—where then can one conceive the spiritual embryo?

**Outer: The Precelestial True Yang**
This ⊙ diagram represents the creative workings within and without the body, called the *Tongtian Aperture*, the alchemical furnace, the path that evades life and death, the place of birth, the state before father and mother, where the five phases do not reach. That speck of true yang lies hidden in the secret place amid the four great form-mountains—this message is profoundly mysterious. This luminous pearl of spirit within the body shares the same essence as the external heaven and earth, sun and moon; it is the ancestor of the entire body. *"Today the true parents are revealed—tomorrow, one need not fear death or life."* This is the compassionate teaching of the Most High, the essence of the *Huangting Jing*’s *Outer Landscape*.

**Middle: Within the Body**
This ○ diagram is the creative source of heaven and earth, where the sword is forged as male and female, where the medicine is discerned as old or young. All things depend on this center—here heaven is established, earth is set firm. The karmic causes of ten thousand kalpas require correct transmission, for this is where heaven cannot descend to earth, nor earth ascend to heaven, eternally suspended in emptiness, its principle most difficult to clarify. Thus it is said: *"The central aperture is known by few—it must be transmitted directly by a clear teacher."* Yet the union of Qian and Kun, the intercourse of Kan and Li—all occur here.

**Inner: The Life-Master of the Sea-Bottom**
This ○ diagram is the numinous tortoise of golden essence at the sea-bottom, the *dui* metal of the other household within our body, the life-master of *wu* earth. The hundred vessels, the five viscera and six bowels—all depend on this entity for governance. Whether attaining immortality or buddhahood, transcending life and death—all rely on this cavity for arrangement. It is truly the place that secures life, the method that nurtures it, where no illness arises. It is the root and stem of all things, the Supreme Ultimate within the body—the compassionate teaching of the Most High, the essence of the *Huangting Jing*’s *Inner Landscape*.

The three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—are truly spoken of within one’s own body. Viewed from the postcelestial, the body contains images and directions; but when investigated from the precelestial, it is the formless, directionless thing that gives birth to heaven, earth, humanity, and the ten thousand beings.

The immortals say: *"Without the postcelestial, the precelestial has nothing to gather; without the precelestial, the postcelestial has nothing to transform."* These are the three true workings—upper, middle, and lower—of heaven, earth, and humanity within and without the body, the three true furnaces and tripods, belonging to the three teachings and the three vehicles of wondrous dharma. They embody the three talents—heaven, earth, and humanity—beyond form, and encompass the scriptures of the three teachings. This five-phase person within the five phases exists entirely within nature and life—how could one seek it elsewhere?

The *Wuzhen Pian* states: *"Three, five, and one—these three words; from ancient times to now, those who truly understand are rare."* What I speak is no empty boast. Even setting aside the subtle intricacies of fire-times and gathering, merely the three five phases are known by not one in a million. If one understands the mutual "theft" of the three talents, returning to this root and restoring this origin, transmitting essence and sending spirit, stealing essence and exchanging qi, inverting and gathering—if one dares to undertake this, attaining immortality or buddhahood is not difficult.

All who study cultivation must first thoroughly investigate the true furnaces and tripods within and without the body. Without recognizing the true furnaces and tripods inside and out, there is no place to begin. Once one knows that the establishment of the furnace and tripod lies within and without, as well as the principle of yin and yang’s coming and going, then one investigates the medicinal materials—what is to be refined in the furnace and tripod?

**Outer: True Lead and True Mercury**
This ⊙ aperture is the true furnace and tripod within and without the body. Here the nine-yang tripod is established, the wisdom-sword is forged to determine the timing, the pass is opened to gather the medicine, mercury returns within cinnabar, fire and water achieve balance through gathering and bathing. All occurs within this aperture, which contains a speck of true cinnabar mercury, clearly present in the neither-internal-nor-external place within the body—yet unknown to ten thousand people. Depart from this, and all is blind practice and aimless refinement. This is the external five phases of one’s own body, the external furnace and tripod, the external creative workings—precisely the nine-yang tripod cast by the Yellow Emperor.

**Middle: The Cauldron of Kun Earth**
This ○ aperture is precisely where the embryo is gathered and congealed, where heaven, earth, and the ten thousand beings are born, where wind, clouds, thunder, and rain arise—all within the central palace’s true position. This is the divine chamber, the precious tripod that produces the inner and outer medicines, forges the male and female swords, withdraws lead and adds mercury, awaits the moment to transmute the elixir. Thus it is said: *"The central aperture is known by few."*

**Inner: The Life-Master Below the Navel**
This ○ aperture is the root of initiating work, the bridge to attaining the Dao. Here the furnace is established and the tripod set within, water and fire refine, method and resources are complete, spirit and qi are whole. Only when the upper seven apertures radiate light is the true moment at hand—then one may gather the medicine from the external furnace and tripod of the body to pair with the male and female within. All depends on this cavity. When the regulation of spirit is perfected, the ten thousand spirits obey, the stars revolve and the Dipper turns—only then can one seize the celestial mechanism beyond.

The upper aperture is the body of pure yang, containing within it a speck of true lead’s essence—this is the other household’s substance within our body, externally within the internal. It is the speck of light between the two kidneys, manifested externally, hence the metaphor.

The lower aperture is the body of pure yin, containing within it a speck of true yang’s qi—this is the substance of our own household within the body, belonging to the internal. It is the essence that flows from the Qian palace into the Kun position, hence the metaphor of the self. The upper aperture is female within and male without; the lower aperture is male within and female without—thus the immortals often use the metaphors of male and female, self and other.

Between them lies the central aperture, the Yellow Dame’s matchmaking chamber. Only when inversion and union occur here can sagehood be attained. The treasure of life comes from beyond one’s own body, yet it is still the substance of one’s own Kun position—existing within the dharma-body and the physical form of the other household. Thus the immortals say, “Gathering does not depart from one’s original spirit.”

Scholars of the world, lacking proper transmission, know not where to begin—clinging to the self is wrong, yet departing from it is also wrong. Who realizes that the speck of original yang, bright and clear, resides in the lofty depths of one’s own mystery, concealed in the secret place neither inside nor out? Within and without, a single qi connects them, an esoteric secret untransmitted for ages.

Yet the human body already possesses two true mechanisms, identical to the sun and moon of the external heavens, not differing by a hair. Heaven and earth are the greatest of all things, while humans are the most spiritually endowed among the ten thousand beings. Heaven and earth are but a great person, and a person is but a small heaven and earth—thus human transformation mirrors that of heaven and earth.

Who awakens to the fact that each person has a celestial aperture? That each person possesses an elixir of immortality? That each person has a furnace for refining the pill? That each person has a ladder to ascend to heaven? That each person has something they do not recognize? That each person disbelieves in the formula for immortality? That each person disbelieves in the path to ascension in broad daylight? Choosing instead to accept death—how lamentable, how grievous!

In refining the Great Return Elixir, one must first replenish deficiency. Only when the marrow is full can one refine the Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir. The initial work begins by gathering the true yin within the upper aperture’s yang and introducing it into the inner golden tripod of the qi sea, where it unites with the kidney meridian. The true yin within yang is one’s own original spirit in its true form, externally corresponding to the three hun; the true yang within yin is the original qi of the body, corresponding to the seven po. When these two qi meet in sequence, Kan and Li naturally merge, hun and po blend, spirit congeals and qi coalesces, and fetal breathing stabilizes. Daily, like the intimacy of husband and wife, the joy is boundless—yet one must not fixate. When water and fire are balanced, they circulate through the four limbs like an active external flame. Maintaining equilibrium between water and fire is the fire-timing of the Small Celestial Cycle.

Harmonizing and steaming, the true breath in the throat reverses back to the original sea, and the lower kidney naturally enters within. True fire spontaneously surges into the four limbs, the entire body softens with indescribable comfort, and within the abdomen, a living dragon ascends and descends with dozens of transformations. The infant and the maiden naturally unite—this is the stage of gathering yang to replenish yin, the work of laying the foundation and refining the self.

In refining the Golden Liquid Great Return Elixir, one must amass both internal and external method and resources, abiding in carefree ease day and night, perpetually luminous—this is the Way of longevity and enduring vision. Ordinary people rely entirely on the five grains for sustenance; if they go several days without eating, their qi dissipates and they die. When a person ages, the lower origin becomes deficient, the marrow empty, and they can no longer endure the qi of the five grains—thus the five grains both nourish and kill. If one masters the balance of internal water and fire, with qi and blood flowing in reverse, the five viscera harmonize, the spleen and stomach open, and food entering the abdomen transforms into qi, generating essence and spirit.

Once the celestial mechanism is grasped and the initial work begins, one must wait until the marrow is full, the abdomen and navel swollen like a pregnant woman—though this is not the form of a physical mass, but rather qi, essence, and spirit all full. When these three are complete, true fire refines, spirit and qi are cultivated, and the great man naturally attains the moment of accomplishment and fulfillment.

I now urge the people of the world: seek diligently, inquire earnestly, and decisively unravel the celestial mechanisms within and without the body. Begin the work swiftly, refine the self, and await the moment. When the time arrives, choose a secluded place and enter the chamber to refine this Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir. It must be a quiet location where no roosters or dogs can be heard. Externally, only fellow adepts of the Dao should be present—no idle or unrelated persons may approach, lest the spirit be startled.

The immortals speak of harmonizing with the world, yet I speak of seclusion—why? To refine the self amidst the mundane and nurture qi in the mountains and forests. The Golden Liquid Return Elixir is the Way of transcending the ordinary and entering sagehood, incomparable to other pursuits. One must be unstained by a single speck of dust, free from all concerns, severed from all attachments like a blade cutting through silk, forever a stranger in a foreign land, with no thought of retreat or regret. The blood fills, the sinews and bones soften, the body becomes wrinkle-free like a spider’s form, the upper seven apertures radiate light day and night, the heart like the great void—only then is the true moment at hand, and one may seek immortality.

Focus the mind single-pointedly, cultivate the spirit to perfection, and when it takes form and obeys command, the stars revolve and the Dipper turns, transforming at will. Only at this time, when qi is full and spirit complete, with abundant method and resources, can one refine the Great Elixir and become a true alchemist.

Once the work is underway, the seven apertures radiate light, the Three Yangs flourish, the spirit-sword takes form. Seizing the current to push the boat, fanning the wind to ignite the fire, when the first yang arises within, one may seize the celestial mechanism beyond, begin the work of opening the passes, and gather the Golden Elixir from beyond the body—marrying the Dragon to the Tiger as husband and wife. If one masters the gathering, the gold from the sea bottom is calmly drawn up, then the spine is opened, the Mud Pill Palace is connected, and it descends into the Crystal Palace to unite with Wood Mercury. In less than half a double-hour, the gathering is complete, true fire surges into the four limbs, and the entire body’s flesh and bones feel as if burned by fire and cut by a knife—this is the most difficult to endure. Even the bravest hero loses all composure at this point. One must guard against danger, bathe the body and mind in ice, balance water and fire, and in an instant, the entire body feels like popping beans, with all pores bursting open. The qi and blood throughout the body take form and speak, clamoring together upon the body.

Beneath the root of the tongue lie two cavities: on the left, the Cinnabar Well, and on the right, the Sweet Spring—rightly named the Gushing Cavities. As the bone meridians open in unison, kidney water surges into the mouth, so copious that one cannot swallow fast enough; its flavor is most singular, far unlike that of granulated sugar. For thirty double-hours—two days and a half—this raging water is exhausted, and one awaits only the descent of celestial menses. At precisely this moment, a single drop of true lead descends, cool as a flake of ice, and immediately a drop of true mercury rises to meet it.

Once the gathering is complete, the entire body becomes serene, yet resounds like a thousand war drums, or roars like a million thunderclaps—this is the transformation of the hundred meridians and the blood throughout the body. Do not be alarmed; simply tread the Dipper’s steps, wield the sword, and grasp the seal. Here lies the most perilous point: three revolutions and nine turns, subduing marshals and summoning generals. With such vigilance, one may witness in the void the coupling of dragon and tiger, the harmony of heaven and earth, the union of sun and moon, or the manifestation of various immortal realms. Yet one must not mistake these for reality, lest external demons take hold.

Once true lead is united with mercury, after three days the great medicine is born. During this battle between the two, had I not personally revealed the secret, nine out of ten would have been frightened to death. Fear in the heart invites demonic obstructions. Having refined the primordial yang, the body transforms entirely into spirit, but if one turns back to harm oneself, though the form is transformed, it is but a yin spirit. Yin spirits are most cunning, capable of myriad transformations to cause harm, and unwilling to submit to good. As the common saying goes: *"Only when you master the six penetrations can you speak of life and death; without the six penetrations, do not dream of subduing spirits."* If one cannot subdue spirits, how can one attain the Dao? If spirits cannot be seen, how can they cause harm?

After another thirty double-hours—two days and a half—qi flows unimpeded, reaching its fullness. Suddenly, a radiant solar pearl emerges, lively and bright, leaping from its shell into the mouth. A million dragon spirits are struck with awe and lose their grip. This is the primordial seed, the true elixir of cinnabar. Only upon ingestion does one realize: *"My life is mine, not heaven’s to command."* The immortals say: *"Only after this great death does one truly live,"* and again: *"One battle settles all under heaven."* At this stage, true harmony between heaven and earth, the union of sun and moon, is finally achieved.

When the medicine of true yang arrives, the fire of the microcosmic orbit ignites in an instant. The skeletal frame melts into a mass of fleshly mud, and the yang spirit departs the body, free and unobstructed. One must focus the mind, uphold emptiness, and guard the void, allowing the spirit to transform at will. All things under heaven are born of heaven and earth, and thus all spirits pay homage and submit. Weary of the dusty world, one roams carefree in Penglai, attended by three thousand jade maidens, feasting daily at the Peach Banquet, drinking immortal wine, wearing immortal flowers, the four great elements suffused with intoxication, the entire body utterly translucent. The tortoise and serpent of the sea bottom naturally coil together—only now is the true method of the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons achieved.

After a hundred days of refinement, the Mysterious Pass opens of itself, the infant appears in form, the tortoise and serpent emerge, and the ten thousand spirits are at one’s command. Only now are true lead and true mercury truly inverted, the entire body enveloped in purple mist and radiant beams, auspicious qi in a thousand strands, a red glow encasing the form. At this stage, the adept’s mouth finally gains control over mercury.

After six months of refinement, the body resembles silver paste, the blood transforms into white nectar, the entire being exudes a fragrance that lingers, and the breath from the mouth forms clouds. This is the completion of the numinous elixir; one who consumes it shall never die and can even revive the dead. After ten months, the yang spirit departs the body, and a single form can divide into a hundred thousand. After twelve months, one seizes the full tally of heaven and earth, the yang spirit is perfected, and the eighty-four thousand yin spirits are shed from the body. One walks without casting a shadow in the sun or moon, passes through metal and stone unimpeded, drowns not in water nor burns in fire, blades find no purchase, spirits cannot fathom one’s designs, and transformations are endless—one has become a true person.

The entire body’s qi and vitality are now true medicine. A chicken that eats it becomes a phoenix, a horse that consumes it becomes a dragon, and a person who takes it becomes an immortal. This principle is even difficult for spirits to comprehend; without having seen or done it, who would believe such words?

The great medicine of the golden elixir, the work of creation and transformation, three revolutions and nine turns—its firing times are subtle. The oral instructions for the gathering lie within the span of five to seven. One overturns heaven and earth entirely, all naturally so. Though natural, one must understand the method of embodying heaven and earth’s creation to succeed; yet this does not mean one must rely on heaven, earth, sun, or moon to attain the Dao.

The matter of ingesting the great medicine must be personally experienced, witnessed, and tested before it aligns with the natural state. Though the work spans a year, the subtleties of the firing times lie within a hundred days; the perilous phases of movement and stillness occur within ninety days. Through inner and outer refinement, the gathering is achieved in an instant, and the sacred embryo is formed. It produces a pearl the size of a millet grain, which, when swallowed, ignites the fire of the microcosmic orbit. The womb is shed, the bones are transformed—one need only uphold emptiness and nurture the void, and all unfolds naturally.

If one truly finds a true teacher to clearly instruct, one first refines the self amidst the dust of the world, accumulates lead in the marketplace, gathers years into months, days into hours, hours into moments. Within this great stillness, all occurs in a single instant—less than half a double-hour—and the celestial mechanism is entirely overturned. One applies the work of ten months’ firing, embodying the natural method of heaven and earth. Without seeking life within death, how can one escape the three calamities and eight difficulties?

Scholars of great learning, keen and wise, who grasp one and know ten, who can expound and discourse on the scriptures of the Three Teachings—yet this only clarifies the principles of nature and the meanings of words. How can they comprehend the creation of the golden elixir, the celestial mechanism of the great Dao, or the two true messages of inner and outer? How can they awaken to this?

If one truly encounters a perfected being who imparts the authentic transmission, one will immediately penetrate principle, exhaust nature, and awaken—like water returning to the great sea. Then, upon examining all the alchemical scriptures, one finds the Dao in every line, horizontal or vertical. The alchemical texts of the various masters were not idly composed by their predecessors; not a single word or phrase is empty—only people fail to awaken to them.

Take, for instance, the saying “swallow the golden elixir into the belly.” Those who miss the essential meaning fixate on the mouth and stomach, unaware that the wondrous aperture draws in the profound mystery of the entire Western River! Or consider those who speculate wildly about heaven and earth, sun and moon, male and female—all mere guesswork. Clinging to the sounds and appearances of side doors, they repel others from a thousand miles away, unwilling to humble themselves before the worthy. They never attain awakening but instead nitpick and slander the lofty ones—how could they ever grasp the method and technique?

They become objects of shared disdain among heaven and humanity, seeds of hell indeed—how pitiable! I earnestly advise the world: if you encounter a perfected being, never cling to your own views. Instead, approach with an empty mind, seek out a luminous teacher with diligence, and only then will you avoid self-deception.

⊙This is the Governing Vessel. "Governing" means "to unify"—it unifies the qi channels of the entire body. It is precisely the primordial yang ancestral qi of the pre-cosmic state, before heaven and earth divided, before this body was born. It has endured through kalpas, unbroken from ancient times to the present.

○This is the Conception Vessel. "Conception" means "benevolence"—it is the primordial qi of ceaseless generation. Pure and vast, perfectly round, radiant and crimson, exquisitely refined, luminous and resplendent, vibrant and alive—this is the thing that precedes the image of the Lord-on-High, the ancestor of all spirits. It embraces the ten thousand images and gives rise to the ten thousand things. Buddhists call it the *maṇi-jewel*; Daoists call it the *millet-like mysterious pearl*; physicians call it the *ever-bubbling elixir of true numinous medicine*—truly a secret untransmitted for ages.

People today do not understand this principle, nor have they received its transmission, nor do they awaken to it—how could they know the wondrousness of the "inner and outer"? The Conception and Governing Vessels are indeed the mystery of the pre- and post-cosmic, yet the common folk use them daily without knowing it.

⊙The Governing Vessel—this aperture is the source of the body’s birth. Before this body existed, this aperture was already present. It is no ordinary bodily orifice but the wondrous aperture of the subtle mechanism. This subtle movement is precisely the primordial yang qi that existed before father and mother conceived.

○The Conception Vessel—this aperture governs the five viscera of the entire body, presiding over both inner and outer. If one knows how to invert and gather, it becomes the root from which the five viscera are born. Before the five viscera existed, this aperture was already present; before this body was born, this aperture was born first. This subtle movement is the method of nurturing life, the root and stem of preserving life without death.

These three true subtle movements—upper, middle, and lower—if received through proper transmission, can return one to the root and restore life. They cause the four qi to return to the lower origin, prevent the dispersal of hun and po, and achieve the harmony of water and fire—what illness could then arise? If this primordial yang is clearly transmitted, even if one encounters the net of the law and cannot escape, or cannot attain the Dao, one may, as a last resort, arouse the life-master at the sea-bottom—the root of the four qi—and return it to the undispersed primordial qi. With a single move, one may let go without obstruction. Apart from this subtle movement, one may also reemerge to study the Dao—this is the unfathomable mystery of gods and spirits.

This primordial qi, the millet-like mysterious pearl, if the true mind transmits it clearly and one practices it diligently, will suddenly bring great awakening. Then the scriptures of the Three Teachings will be clearly present before one, understood without need for reflection or thought.

From a grand theoretical perspective, the entire body—inside and out, blood and qi—is all post-cosmic dregs of turbid yin. Only the single point of primordial yang in the secret place is pure yang. This true form belongs to the heart, and this heart is the heart of true emptiness—not the heart of blood and flesh.

This true heart is unknown to the multitude, yet within it lies another world of heaven and earth. I shall describe the three hearts—inner, outer, and central—below.

**Outer Heart—Heavenly Heart**: ○This heart is the heart of true emptiness, called the *mysterious pass*, the aperture that communicates with heaven. It is precisely the true crucible and furnace of the inner and outer Five Agents. All methods of opening the pass, kindling the fire, pacing the stars, wielding the sword, and holding the seal—through which even gods and spirits cannot perceive the mechanism—depend entirely on this. One must know the proper method.

**Central Heart—Human Heart**: ○This heart is the central aperture, the dwelling of the Yellow Dame. The gathering of inner and outer depends entirely on her. Setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible, refining the inner and outer medicines, distinguishing maturity from immaturity, truth from falsehood—all emerge from this heart.

**Inner Heart—Earthly Heart**: ○This heart is the life-master at the sea-bottom, the stem of the ten thousand spirits. In cultivating the Great Vehicle, one must first cultivate the Lesser Vehicle: laying the foundation, refining the self, accumulating the wealth of the Dharma, and preserving the qi of mercury—all depend on this cavity. One must recognize hardness and softness.

These three hearts are the three subtle movements—inner, outer, and central—within the body. If one can invert heaven and earth, unlock the seamless lock, then a single phrase resolves the ancient Amitābha.

These three hearts are the secret untransmitted for ages. Apart from the heart of blood and flesh, there are three true hearts. These three hearts penetrate the true emptiness of the void. If one understands this true heart, then the ten thousand images of heaven and earth are contained within this empty heart. This empty heart embraces true yin and true yang, yet the subtle movement of true emptiness is the seamless lock—if it cannot be opened, where can one escape birth and death?

The immortals say:
*"The golden needle is easy to obtain,
The jade thread is hardest to thread.
To know the path of birth and death,
Is like tossing a mustard seed into a needle’s eye."*

This is a metaphor for yin and yang. Yin and yang are life and destiny—who truly understands them? Yet if one awakens for three, five, seven, fourteen, or twenty-one days, and wishes to preserve life without death, one must seize water, fire, and wind, preventing their dispersal, and return the life-master of the other household to one’s own body. Do not stir the heart—this is the method of not dying.

If one is aged and cannot practice to attain the Dao, one must turn back. Like a melon that ripens and its stem falls, it all depends on these subtle movements. Once the timing is known, arouse the life-master at the sea-bottom and return it to the primordial nature of the upper void. Then hun and po will not disperse, and one may act freely without delusion.

*Direct Pointers to Resolving Doubts on the Golden Elixir*

There are those of shallow roots and blind eyes who, upon hearing the immortals speak of outer yin-yang, outer crucibles, and outer medicines, cling to their delusions and take women as vessels—how pitiable! Such ignorant fools—how could they know that the Great Dao of purity encompasses the three bodies and four wisdoms, the inner and outer crucibles and furnaces, the inner and outer medicines, and the subtleties of inner and outer fire timings? How could they know that the ten thousand things are complete within me, and the creative transformations of heaven and earth are identical to my own greatness!

If a man of karmic affinity should encounter a true master, he must first practice the inner return of the Jade Liquid Elixir, refining the self to harmonize with radiance, holding fast to nurturing cultivation, and turning the light inward to reflect—this is the matter of illuminating the mind and seeing the nature. As for the Golden Liquid Return Elixir, it is the return of emotion to nature, reaching the state of true emptiness, where great function manifests before one. The Dragon Girl presents a single precious pearl, and only upon its revelation is there attainment that endures forever.

At the cusp of *hai* and *zi*, between the belly of *kun*, when the first yang stirs and work begins, one’s hand explores the Moon Grotto while the foot treads the Heavenly Root. The returning wind merges in harmony, and only then does the efficacy of a hundred days’ work manifest. The Golden Liquid Return Elixir is the great affair of completing the Five Phases.

Apart from this Way of dual cultivation of nature and life in purity, all else is but peripheral minor arts. Within my own body, inside and out, I have mastered the subtleties of setting up the furnace and establishing the crucible, the oral instructions for gathering the Five Phases, and the fine details of medicine and fire timing. Yet if one does not understand the measures of the void and rashly enters the chamber to perform the great work of ingesting the outer medicine and kindling the fire, when the practice reaches its secret point, the ten thousand spirits of the void will come to pay homage, and the immortal embryo will form at the crown. This matter is too profound for even ghosts and spirits to fathom. It is only because one has not refined the self amid the dust of the world, has not accumulated lead in the marketplace, the qi channels remain unsettled, and the foundation is not yet complete in three aspects. Though the principle is harmonized, the nature is not yet revealed. Thus, when the ten thousand spirits manifest, a hundred dangers arise: the heart and spirit grow distracted, unable to take command.

Moreover, without knowing companions of the Way to guard and protect outside, one may be startled by sounds and sights, scattering the primordial yang, agitating the crucible and scorching the furnace. The Heart Ape grows restless, the Intent Horse flees, the spirit does not guard the abode, and the qi does not return to the origin—one falls prey to yin demons. What are yin demons? I shall not elaborate, but later learners will not understand. It is all because the true yang scatters and yin qi takes control, with ghosts and spirits in the body causing harm day and night. Whether eyes are open or closed, one hears only the clamor of ghosts and spirits. By day it is bearable, but by night it is most unbearable—one dare not settle into stillness even for a moment. The life-master at the Sea Bottom of the other household, the *dui*-metal’s *wu* earth, surges through the five viscera and hundred channels, blood and qi all rising upward, lifting the body so it does not touch the ground, bringing death and ruin—the livelihood of ghosts.

I temporarily abandoned my previous efforts, following my master’s instructions to conceal myself in the marketplace, accumulating lead amid the dust of the world, drawing emotion back to nature, and returning the killing mechanism to the heart. From youth to old age, heaven, earth, and all beings have stolen my celestial authenticity. Now, within the dust and colors of the void, I must steal it back and return it to my celestial nature. Only then can the primordial essence, primordial qi, and primordial spirit be restored to wholeness. This depends entirely on extreme emptiness and profound stillness, whereby the myriad things flourish and each returns to its root. When the root returns, the principle harmonizes; when the principle harmonizes, the nature is revealed. Body and mind settle into great stillness, the Five Phases gather, and only then can one proceed to the upward work and complete the Dao.

Many worthy sages of former times abandoned their practice midway, all because they had not refined the self and held the heart, had not drawn metal back to nature. Thus, when they obtained the medicine in the second period and proceeded to the fire in the fourth period, not understanding the measures of the void and acting carelessly, Master Bai sighed, “Again must the pine and bamboo be hewn.” Who knows the subtleties of the void—so fine, so perilous, so fierce? If one fails to seize it, it will surely not spare them.

If a learner can understand the two subtleties within and without the body, attaining clarity without obstruction, and from there hold fast to nurturing cultivation, overcoming selfishness and restoring celestial principle, then the work of the elixir without fixed timing becomes most simple and easy. One may spend all day tending the yellow blossoms outside the body, awaiting the jade nectar of prior and posterior heaven—this is precisely the wonder of “drinking wine, wearing flowers, and awakening to longevity.”

Yet in the matter of primordial merging, there must be no intent, no insistence, no rigidity, no self. Whether life or death, forget others and forget the self. All day in the bustling marketplace, one plays with scenes to gladden the heart, sitting blankly in brothels and taverns, speaking idly—how could this not arouse the shock, doubt, laughter, and slander of others? Drawing in the environment to accumulate lead, employing both method and wealth—how could this not invite the deception and harm of vulgar men?

Thus, one relies on powerful families in great cities for external protection, perceiving the Dao with a glance while concealing one’s light and hiding one’s tracks. As the immortals say, “If you covet the treasure of heaven, you must use the wealth of the world.” This is the great treasure of the Nine Yang Crucible within my body. All beings dwelling between heaven and earth, men and women alike, rely on this single point of yang essence to live without dying. How could it be that those who study immortality—men learning the Dao must use women, women learning the Dao must use men—corrupt the customs of the world? Such acts are known only to beasts and animals. Alas! With speech incomprehensible and delusion unshaken, how could they be kin to immortals and buddhas?

If a learner can truly hold fast to nurturing cultivation, not losing the square inch of the heart amid haste, peril, or displacement, and then seeks the matter of ingesting the outer medicine, in an instant they will become profoundly still. Shedding the womb and changing the crucible, the whole body transforms into a single beam of golden light. The great earth becomes empty, and outside the body appears another body. The yang spirit leaves the form, holding emptiness to nurture the void—this is the Great Hibernation of the Five Dragons.

As the immortals say, “Without inner elixir, outer elixir will not succeed.” These words are trustworthy. One who receives the true transmission must first accumulate essence and amass qi, gathering both inner and outer method and wealth. When qi is full and spirit complete, the golden light appears, shining day and night without cease. At this time, the inner elixir is complete, and the outer elixir’s symbolic manifestation appears.

One must not read books and seek the steed by following the picture. Only when the golden light shines day and night, and the medicine sprout arises, may one gather the outer medicine of the body and pair it with the inner yin and yang. Once the golden light enters the mouth and the fire of the celestial circuit ignites, in an instant one becomes profoundly still, letting go without hindrance—this is the Great Molting of the Golden Cicada.

Before encountering a true master, one must be humble and cautious, accumulating merit and cultivating conduct. When faced with demons, do not retreat; when slandered, do not grow angry. Value the Dao and disdain wealth. Upon meeting a perfected one, devote oneself wholeheartedly to seeking, resolutely breaking through the two true mysteries within and without the body. Suddenly, one aligns with the true locus of realization and speaks of it—this is what is meant by "my body as heaven and earth."

Though this true locus is said to stand without reliance on form, how could the aperture within the aperture be without form? Now, we borrow an analogy to clarify: consider a forked mouth—when its center is full, it opens; when empty, it slackens. The aperture’s ability to open and slacken is just like this.

At the outset, one must first concentrate the spirit, entering the aperture within the aperture. With each breath returning to the root, the center becomes full, and with the center full, the embryo grows. Yet the spirit is originally born within the aperture of apertures and lodges in the palace of the heart. I have often called it: "what was originally my own, now returned to me."

The aperture within the aperture is the spirit-chamber. The spirit-chamber is the qi-cavern, the Central Yellow. Yellow is the true color of good earth, and earth is intent. Thus, the earth of Kan (☵) is *wu* (戊), whose intent ever tends toward Li (☲); the earth of Li is *ji* (己), whose intent ever tends toward Kan. Such is their nature and disposition, and thus they possess a natural affinity for union.

If one can recognize this moment of affinity and guide it with intent, spirit congeals and qi abides—naturally coalescing into a single grain of golden elixir. It is utterly simple and effortless, without forced contrivance. This is the mother’s qi subduing the child’s qi, as the qi of mother and child yearn for each other within the aperture of apertures. How could the elixir fail to form?

**Two Songs of the Right Dao**

I hold a single oral formula,
Yet sigh that none can hear it.
I search the world in vain—
To no one may it be spoken!

Forward is the elixir, reverse is immortality:
This is the true oral formula.
All else is vain striving,
Mere contortion and pretense.

Master the *Awakening to Reality*,
Seek a teacher with care.
Then some small wonder arises,
A mystery beyond spirit’s reckoning.

The marrow of heaven and earth, fused and warm,
Sipped with mindful timing.
One must seek the treasure beneath the earth,
And discern the moon in the sky.

Observe the floating and sinking to know ripeness,
Distinguish the water’s source for purity.
When the wild battle comes,
Let neither ape nor horse grow restless.

When the guest arrives, first act as host;
When the host arrives, then act as guest.
The Yellow Dame mediates the Dark Maiden—
Their union forges the elixir.

Outside, black as lacquer;
Within, white as snow.
At the center, radiant with yellow and purple,
Flesh green, skin like blood.

Once the Five Heroes’ elixir is formed,
The Three Corpses and yin ghosts perish.
The one refined and luminous,
Not the dull, deaf, mute, or clumsy.

Mind without thought,
Mouth without speech.
Employ the civil, then the martial,
Gather in accord with the season.

Keep the golden crucible ever warm,
The jade furnace never too hot.
In an instant, the union is complete—
Then nurture it for ten months.

A man may give birth,
Bearing a guest of the Three Isles.
Swallowing a single living grain,
Heavenly immortals come to welcome him.

When nine years of merit are fulfilled,
He strides steadily toward the Golden Gate.

Again:

This Dao-affection is no common feeling.
Once the mystery is known, it must not be taken lightly.

First lay down all worldly attachments,
Then delve into the wondrous principles to clarify them yourself.
Before refining the Returned Elixir, first refine your nature;
Before cultivating the Great Medicine, first cultivate your mind.
When the mind is settled, the Elixir’s nature naturally arrives;
When the nature is purified, then the medicinal ingredients arise.
Thunder rumbles faintly, shaking the empty void,
Yellow Court and purple mists veil a thousand fathoms deep.
Should you reach this point, do not be startled or afraid—
Only guard the Gate of the Grotto with your original spirit.
Guard the Grotto Gate as a cat, mouse, or hare meets an eagle.
Though myriad visions appear, none are true—
Only a single crimson light is the utmost reality.
This crimson light gives birth to strange phenomena,
Within it, like dust in a sunlit window.
It contains a single point of primordial qi,
Distant as a grape, near as gold.
Seize it with utmost care—
The slightest stray thought forfeits celestial truth.
Wait until the first yang returns to the Grotto Palace,
Transforming the body into the four seasons of spring.
A patch of white cloud drifts by,
Each rain’s passing brings renewal.
All day long, serene as a drunken man,
Leisurely guarding the grotto’s eternal spring.
When all yin essence is stripped away,
It transmutes into a mass of pure yang gold.
At this moment, breath ceases as in a minor death,
Forged into one whole—the perfected true self.
Here the work is complete,
Yet return to the mundane world to accumulate merit.
When merit is fulfilled and conduct perfected, Heaven’s decree arrives,
The yang spirit emerges, revealing true numen.
These words must not be spoken to the unworthy—
Reckless disclosure invites celestial thunder’s wrath.
I charge my immortal companions and Daoist peers:
Do not lightly discuss this with those who do not comprehend.
Each line here conveys profound mystery—
Beyond this truth, no truth remains.
Gather these brocade verses, seal them tightly,
That one day they may verify your practice.
Verify your practice—
Fifty-two lines for you to heed.
Should any falsehood be spoken, you’ll meet violent death,
Your spirit officer lashed to pieces.
