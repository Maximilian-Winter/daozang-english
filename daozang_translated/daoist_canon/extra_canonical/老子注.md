A Commentary on the *Laozi* by Chen Li of the Qing Dynasty
*Laozi Zhu* (Commentary on the *Laozi*), One Scroll
By Chen Li of Panyu
Manuscript copy by the Shi family, 1930

**Chapter One**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao;
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
[This means the eternal Dao cannot be spoken, nor can the eternal name be named. The eternal Dao and eternal name refer to the Dao. Chapter Twenty-Five states: "There is a thing, formlessly formed, born before heaven and earth. I know not its name, so I style it 'Dao.'" Such is the case. The Dao precedes heaven and earth and remains unchanged through all ages—hence it is called "eternal." After the existence of heaven and earth, myriad transformations arise without end; its Dao may be spoken, its name may be named, yet these are mutable and not eternal.]

"Nameless" is the beginning of heaven and earth;
"Named" is the mother of the myriad things.
[He Shanggong’s commentary states: "Nameless" refers to the Dao; "named" refers to heaven and earth.]

Thus, by constantly dwelling in non-being, one may observe its mystery;
By constantly dwelling in being, one may observe its manifestations.
[Non-desire means restraining one’s desires. By constantly restraining desires, one may observe the subtleties of the Dao. Yet all things possess desire—emerging into life and entering into death—so one must also constantly observe the tendencies of things through one’s own desires. He Shanggong says: "Manifestations" (*jiao*) means "tendencies" (*gui*), observing the tendencies of worldly customs. Lu [Huiqing] says: "*Jiao* means 'minor paths,' 'boundaries,' or 'subtle mysteries.'"]

These two emerge from the same source yet bear different names;
Both are called the profound.
Profounder still is the gate of all mysteries.
[He Shanggong says: "The two" refers to having desire and being without desire. Li comments: In restraint, it is called "non-being"; in its inherent state, it is called "being."]

**Chapter Two**

All under heaven know beauty as beauty, and already this is ugliness;
All know goodness as goodness, and already this is not goodness.
[Knowing beauty and goodness leads to competition in concealing goodness, losing their naturalness.]

Thus, being and non-being give rise to each other,
Difficulty and ease complete each other,
Long and short form each other,
High and low incline toward each other,
Tones and voices harmonize with each other,
Front and back follow each other.
[These six are the natural tendencies of the myriad things.]

Therefore, the sage abides in non-action,
Practices the teaching without words,
And the myriad things arise without refusal.
[They move of themselves without ceasing.]
They give life yet do not possess,
Act yet do not rely,
Accomplish yet do not dwell—
Only because they do not dwell,
Do they not depart.

**Chapter Three**

Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend;
Do not prize rare goods, and the people will not steal;
Do not display what is desirable,
And the people’s hearts will not be disturbed.
[All editions lack the character *min* ("people"); following the official edition.]

Thus, in the governance of the sage:
He empties their hearts,
[Removes cravings, eliminates chaos and confusion.]
Fills their bellies,
[Embraces the Dao and holds to unity, guarding the five spirits.]
Weakens their ambitions,
[Harmonious, yielding, and humble, not grasping authority.]
Strengthens their bones,
[Cherishes essence and values generosity, filling the marrow and firming the bones.]
So that the common people remain without knowledge and without desire,
And those with knowledge dare not act.
[The wise delight in action; restrain them so they dare not act.]
Act through non-action, and nothing will be left ungoverned.

**Chapter Four**

The Dao is empty, yet its use is inexhaustible.
[“Empty” means “void.”]
Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.
It blunts their sharpness,
[Sharpened by craft, they cannot long endure—thus it blunts them.]
Untangles their entanglements,
Harmonizes their radiance,
Mingles with their dust.
Deep, it seems perhaps to exist.
I do not know whose child it is—
[Laozi says: I do not know from whence it arises.]
It appears before the Lord of Heaven.

**Chapter Five**

Heaven and Earth are not humane—
They treat the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is not humane—
They treat the common people as straw dogs.
[Straw and dogs are the basest of things.]

Between Heaven and Earth,
Is it not like a bellows?
[Wang Bi says: *Tuo* refers to the "piston bellows."
*Yue* refers to the "musical pipe."]
Empty yet never exhausted,
[He Shanggong says: Without any time of depletion.
*Qu* (屈), *Fuwen* (《释文》) writes as *jue* (掘), noting He Shanggong’s version as *jue*.]
Moving, it brings forth ever more.
The more words are spoken, the sooner they reach their limit—
[Lu Deming says: Wang Bi says: "principle and number."
Gu Huan says: "circumstance and fate."]
Better to hold fast to the center.

**Chapter Six**

The Valley Spirit does not die—
[Valley (*gu*) means "emptiness."
Valley Spirit (*gushen*) is the spirit of emptiness.
*Fuwen*: *Gu*, pronounced *gu* (古木反), refers to that which is hollow at the center.]
This is called the Dark Womb.
[Dark (*xuan*) means "profound and deep."
Womb (*pin*) means "aperture."]
The gateway of the Dark Womb
Is called the root of Heaven and Earth.
[He Shanggong says: The gates of nose and mouth
Are the passages through which the primordial *qi* of Heaven and Earth flows in and out.]
Subtly continuous, as if existing—
[He Shanggong says: The breath of nose and mouth should be soft and fine,
As if present, yet as if absent.
Use the *qi* with ease and leisure,
Not with haste, urgency, or strain.]
Its use is never exhausted.

**Chapter Seven**

Heaven and Earth endure—
Heaven and Earth endure so long
Because they do not live for themselves.
[Heaven and Earth give life to things yet do not claim life for themselves.]
Thus they live long.
Therefore the sage places their person last yet finds themselves first,
Sets their person aside yet preserves it.
Is this not because they are selfless?
Thus they fulfill their self.
[The essence of Laozi’s teaching lies in fulfilling the self.]

**Chapter Eight**

The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits the ten thousand things yet does not contend,
Flowing where the many shun.
[Wang Bi: People shun the lowly.
Thus it nearly approaches the Dao.
He Shanggong: The nature of water nearly aligns with the Dao.]
It dwells in goodness,
Its heart is deep as an abyss,
[He Shanggong: Water is profoundly empty; the abyss is deep and clear.]
Its giving is kind,
[He Shanggong: The ten thousand things receive life from water, aligning with emptiness, not with fullness.]
Its speech is true,
[He Shanggong: Water reflects shadows within; forms do not lose their essence.]
Its governance is just,
[He Shanggong: Nothing remains unwashed; all is cleansed and level.]
Its work is capable,
[He Shanggong: It can be square or round, bending or straight, adapting to form.]
Its movement is timely.
[He Shanggong: It scatters in summer and congeals in winter, moving in accord with the seasons, never losing the celestial timing.]
Truly, because it does not contend,
It is without blame.

**Chapter Nine**

To hold and fill it to the brim
Is not as good as stopping in time.
[Wang Bi: To hold means not to lose virtue; yet even without losing virtue, one should act as if without virtue or merit.]
To grind and sharpen it,
[Chuai (*揣*) means "to grind."
Gu says: "to refine."
Rui (*锐*): *Shiwen* reads as *yue* (悦), noting He Shanggong’s version has *rui* (锐).]
Cannot be long preserved.
When gold and jade fill the hall,
None can guard them.
Wealth and honor breed arrogance,
Bringing misfortune upon oneself.
To withdraw once the work is done—
This is the Dao of Heaven.
[Wang Bi: The four seasons alternate; when the work is complete, they shift away.]

To carry the soul and embrace the One—
Can this be done without separation?
[The "One" is that which is called "the valley spirit never dies."
The human body carries the *hun*-soul and embraces the spirit—
Can this be done without separation?]

To concentrate the *qi* and attain softness—
Can one be like an infant?
Can the *qi* remain undivided,
And reach the utmost softness and weakness of an infant?

To cleanse and purify the mysterious mirror—
Can this be done without flaw?
[He Shanggong says: One should wash the heart,
Making it pure and clean.
The heart dwells in the realm of profound darkness,
Surveying and knowing the ten thousand things—
Thus it is called the "mysterious mirror."]

To love the people and govern the state—
Can this be done without knowledge?
[Chapter Sixty-Five: "To govern the state with cleverness
Is the state’s ruin."]

The gate of Heaven opens and closes—
Can one be without the feminine?
[The "gate of Heaven" is unclear.
He Shanggong says: The gate of Heaven refers to the nostrils.
Wang Bi says: The gate of Heaven is that by which all under Heaven follows.
"Opening and closing" refers to the juncture of order and chaos.
The feminine responds but does not initiate,
Following but not acting—
Does this mean the gate of Heaven opens and closes,
And one can *be* the feminine?
The *Guanben* edition notes: According to the commentary, *wu* (无) seems to read as *wei* (为).
Li says: *Wei* (为) is correct.
"To be the feminine" is what is called "guarding the feminine."
The interpretations of He Shanggong and Wang Bi remain unresolved.]

To understand the four directions and be all-pervading—
Can this be done without action?

To give life and nurture it,
To give life yet not possess;
To act yet not rely;
To lead yet not dominate—
This is called the profound *virtue*.

Thirty spokes join in a single hub—
It is where there is *wu* that the cart finds its use.
Clay is shaped to form a vessel—
It is where there is *wu* that the vessel finds its use.
Doors and windows are cut to make a room—
It is where there is *wu* that the room finds its use.
Thus, "having" brings advantage,
While *wu* brings use.

The five colors blind the eye;
The five tones deafen the ear;
The five flavors dull the palate.
Racing and hunting madden the heart;
Rare goods impede conduct.
Therefore, the sage attends to the belly, not the eye—
Thus, he rejects that and embraces this.

Favor and disgrace are both as startling—
Regard great trouble as you do your own body.

What does it mean, "favor and disgrace are both as startling"?
Favor is inferior—
Gaining it is startling,
Losing it is startling.
This is what is meant by "favor and disgrace are both as startling."

What does it mean, "regard great trouble as you do your own body"?
The reason I have great trouble
Is that I have a body.
If I had no body,
What trouble could I have?

Thus, one who values their body as the world
May be entrusted with the world;
One who cherishes their body as the world
May be charged with the world.

---

Look at it, yet see it not—call it the Level.
Listen to it, yet hear it not—call it the Rare.
Grasp at it, yet hold it not—call it the Subtle.
These three cannot be fully examined,
So they merge into one.
Above, it is not bright;
Below, it is not dark.
Endless, unnameable—
It returns to nothingness.
This is called the formless form,
The imageless image,
Called the indistinct and evanescent.
Meet it, yet see not its head;
Follow it, yet see not its rear.
Hold to the ancient Dao to master present being,
And know the ancient beginning—
This is called the thread of the Dao.

---

The ancients who were adept as scholars
Were subtly mysterious, profoundly penetrating,
So deep they could not be known.
Only because they could not be known
Do I force a description of their demeanor:

Hesitant, as if crossing a winter stream;
Wary, as if fearing neighbors on all sides;
Reserved, as if a guest;
Yielding, as ice about to melt;
Simple, as uncarved wood;
Vast, as a valley;
Opaque, as muddied water.

Who can still the turbid and gradually clarify it?
Who can remain at rest and slowly bring forth life?

Those who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness.
Only because they are not full
Can they be worn yet not newly made.

Reach emptiness to its utmost, guard stillness with sincerity.
All things arise together—
I thereby observe their return.
Now, things flourish in abundance,
Each returning to its root.

Returning to the root is called stillness;
This is called restoring the mandate.
Restoring the mandate is called constancy.
Knowing constancy is called clarity;
Not knowing constancy, reckless action brings misfortune.
Knowing constancy, one is all-embracing;
Embracing, one is impartial;
Impartial, one is kingly;
Kingly, one is celestial;
Celestial, one is of the Dao;
Of the Dao, one endures—
To the end of life, without peril.

In the highest antiquity, the people knew only that rulers existed.
Next, they drew near and praised them;
Next, they feared them;
Next, they reviled them.
Where trust is insufficient,
There will be distrust.

How weighty their words!
Their work is accomplished, their affairs completed,
Yet the people all say, “We are naturally thus.”

Chapter Eighteen
When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness.
When cleverness and knowledge arise, there is great artifice.
When the six relations are not in harmony, there is filial piety and compassion.
When the state is benighted and disordered, there are loyal ministers.

Chapter Nineteen
Cut off sageliness, cast away knowledge—
The people will benefit a hundredfold.
Cut off benevolence, cast away righteousness—
The people will return to filial piety and compassion.
Cut off skill, cast away profit—
There will be no thieves or bandits.
These three, as cultural refinements, are insufficient;
Thus, let there be that to which they belong:
Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity,
Reduce self-interest, diminish desires.

Chapter Twenty
Cut off learning, and there will be no worries.
How great is the difference between compliance and flattery?
How vast is the distance between good and evil?
What others fear, one cannot but fear—
Vast and boundless, it is not yet ended!
The multitude bustle and rejoice,
As if feasting on the grand sacrifice,
As if ascending the springtime terrace.
I alone remain still, showing no sign,
Like an infant who has not yet learned to smile,
Weary and forlorn, as if with no place to return.
The multitude all have more than enough,
While I alone seem to have lost everything.
What a fool’s heart I possess—so muddled!
The common folk are bright and clear,
While I alone am dull and dim.
The common folk are sharp and discerning,
While I alone am dull and obscure,
Vast as the sea,
Drifting as if without end.
The multitude all have their uses,
While I alone am stubborn and coarse.
I alone differ from others,
Yet I value the nourishment of the Mother.

Chapter Twenty-One
The bearing of great virtue
Follows only the Dao.
As a thing, the Dao is
Elusive and evanescent.
Evanescent, elusive—
Within it there are images.
Elusive, evanescent—
Within it there are things.
Dark and obscure—
Within it there is essence.
Its essence is most real,
Within it there is trust.
From ancient times until now,
Its name has never departed,
By which we may observe the origin of all things.
How do I know the form of the origin of all things?
By this.

Chapter Twenty-Two

“To yield is to be preserved whole;
To be bent is to become straight;
To be hollow is to be filled;
To be tattered is to be renewed;
To want is to possess;
To have abundance is to be perplexed.”

Thus the sage embraces the One and becomes the model for all under heaven.
He does not display himself, and so is luminous;
He does not assert himself, and so is distinguished;
He does not boast, and so achieves merit;
He does not vaunt himself, and so endures.
It is precisely because he does not contend
That none under heaven can contend with him.
The ancient saying “To yield is to be preserved whole”—
Is it an empty phrase?
Truly, to be preserved whole is to return to it.

Chapter Twenty-Three
Sparse speech accords with nature.
Fierce winds do not last the morning;
Torrential rains do not last the day.
Who brings these about?
Heaven and earth.
If even heaven and earth cannot endure long,
How much less can man?
Therefore, those who align with the Dao:
Those of the Dao are one with the Dao;
Those of virtue are one with virtue;
Those of loss are one with loss.
Those one with the Dao—the Dao delights in attaining them;
Those one with virtue—virtue delights in attaining them;
Those one with loss—loss delights in attaining them.
Where trust is insufficient,
There will be those who do not trust.

Chapter Twenty-Four
One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm;
One who strides cannot walk far;
One who displays himself is not luminous;
One who asserts himself is not distinguished;
One who boasts achieves no merit;
One who vaunts himself does not endure.
In the Way, these are called
“Superfluous food and redundant conduct.”
Some things despise them—
Therefore those with the Dao do not abide in them.

Chapter Twenty-Five
There is a thing formed in chaos,
Born before heaven and earth.

Silent, oh so vast!
Standing alone, unchanging,
Circling endlessly without weariness.
It may be called the Mother of all under heaven.
I know not its name—
I style it "Dao,"
And by force name it "Great."
Great means flowing,
Flowing means far-reaching,
Far-reaching means returning.
Thus the Dao is great,
Heaven is great,
Earth is great,
And the king, too, is great.
Within the realm, there are four greats,
And the king occupies one among them.
Man models himself on earth,
Earth models itself on heaven,
Heaven models itself on the Dao,
The Dao models itself on spontaneity.

Chapter Twenty-Six
Weight is the root of lightness;
Stillness is the ruler of restlessness.
Thus the sage travels all day
Without parting from the heavy supply wagon.
Though there be splendid sights,
He dwells serenely, transcendent.
How could the lord of ten thousand chariots
Treat his person lightly before all under heaven?
To be light is to lose one’s root;
To be restless is to lose one’s ruler.

Chapter Twenty-Seven
In skillful movement,
No tracks are left;

In skillful speech,
No flaws are found;
In skillful reckoning,
No counting rods are used;
In skillful closure,
No bolts or bars are needed, yet none can open;
In skillful binding,
No cords or knots are tied, yet none can untie.
Thus the sage is ever skillful in saving people,
And so none are abandoned;
Ever skillful in saving things,
And so nothing is discarded.
This is called inheriting enlightenment.

Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good,
And the not-good person is the resource of the good.
If one does not value one’s teacher,
Nor cherish one’s resource,
Though wise, one is greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.

Chapter Twenty-Eight
Know the masculine,
Yet hold to the feminine,
And be a valley to all under heaven.
Being a valley to all under heaven,
One’s constant virtue never departs,
And one returns to the state of infancy.

Know the bright,
Yet hold to the dark,
And be a model to all under heaven.
Being a model to all under heaven,
One’s constant virtue never errs,
And one returns to the boundless.

Know glory,
Yet hold to disgrace,
And be a valley to all under heaven.
Being a valley to all under heaven,
One’s constant virtue is then fulfilled,
And one returns to the uncarved block.

When the uncarved block is scattered, it becomes vessels;
The sage, using them, becomes a leader of officials.
Thus the great system makes no cuts.

Those who would take all under heaven and act upon it—I see they will not succeed.
All under heaven is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon.
Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it.

Thus, things may lead or follow,
may warm or chill,
may strengthen or weaken,
may be secure or imperiled.

Therefore, the sage discards excess, extravagance, and arrogance.

---

Chapter Thirty
One who assists a ruler through the Dao
does not dominate all under heaven with military force.
Such affairs tend to rebound:
where armies encamp, brambles grow;
in the wake of great armies, years of famine follow.

The good achieve their aim and stop—
they dare not seize dominance through force.
Having achieved their aim, they do not boast;
having achieved their aim, they do not vaunt;
having achieved their aim, they do not grow arrogant;
having achieved their aim, they act only when compelled;
having achieved their aim, they do not force.

When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.

The fine weapon is an inauspicious instrument—
some beings detest it,
thus one who embodies the Dao does not dwell with it.

The noble person at rest honors the left,
but in deploying troops, honors the right.
Weapons are inauspicious instruments,
not the instruments of the noble person.
Only when compelled does one employ them,
and even then, tranquility is prized.
To triumph yet not exult—
those who exult in victory delight in slaughter.
One who delights in slaughter
cannot realize their will under heaven.

Auspicious affairs esteem the left,
inauspicious affairs esteem the right.
The deputy general stands on the left,
the supreme general on the right—
this is to position them as if for mourning rites.
When multitudes are slain,
one presides over them with grief and sorrow;
when victory is won, one treats it with mourning rites.

Chapter Thirty-Two
The Dao is eternally nameless.
Though the uncarved block is small,
none under heaven can make it a servant.
If lords and kings could guard it,
the myriad things would of themselves submit.
Heaven and earth unite
to send down sweet dew,
and the people, without being commanded, distribute it evenly.

Once the system of names begins,
names too will have their limits.
Knowing the limit, one may avoid peril.
The Dao’s presence in the world
is like valley streams flowing to rivers and seas.

Chapter Thirty-Three
One who knows others is wise,
but one who knows oneself is enlightened.
One who conquers others has force,
but one who conquers oneself is strong.
One who knows contentment is rich.
One who acts with vigor has resolve.
One who does not lose their place endures.
One who dies yet does not perish enjoys long life.

Chapter Thirty-Four
The great Dao flows everywhere,
to left and right alike.
The myriad things depend on it for life, yet it does not refuse them.
Its work is accomplished, yet it claims no possession.
It clothes and nourishes the myriad things yet does not lord over them—
thus it may be called small.
The myriad things return to it, yet it does not lord over them—
thus it may be called great.
Because it never regards itself as great,
it is able to fulfill its greatness.

Chapter Thirty-Five
Hold to the great image,
and all under heaven will come to you.
They come without harm,
and find peace, safety, and great abundance.
Music and fine food
may make the passing traveler pause.
But when the Dao is spoken,
it is so bland as to seem flavorless.
Look at it—it cannot be seen.
Listen to it—it cannot be heard.
Use it—it cannot be exhausted.

Chapter Thirty-Six
To intend to contract it,
one must first surely expand it;
to intend to weaken it,
one must first surely strengthen it;
to intend to abolish it,
one must first surely exalt it;
to intend to seize it,
one must first surely give it.
This is called subtle illumination—
the hidden brightness where schemes lie concealed within, never revealed without.
The soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.
Fish must not be taken from the depths—
they must not lose their place of reliance.
The state’s sharp instruments must not be shown to others.
To show them is to risk losing them.

Chapter Thirty-Seven
The Dao ever acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone.
Should lords and kings hold fast to it,
the myriad things will transform of themselves.
Transformed, should desire arise,
I shall press it down with the nameless uncarved block.
The nameless uncarved block—
it too will be without desire.
Without desire, through stillness,
all under heaven will settle of itself.

Chapter Thirty-Eight
Highest virtue does not act as virtue—
thus it possesses virtue.
Lower virtue does not lose virtue—
thus it possesses no virtue.
Highest virtue acts without acting and without purpose.
Lower virtue acts with purpose and intention.
Highest benevolence acts without purpose,
highest righteousness acts with purpose.
Highest ritual acts, yet if none respond,
it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.

The *Hanfeizi* states: "Benevolence (*ren*) means to delight in loving others from the heart, to rejoice in their good fortune and grieve at their misfortune—an impulse the mind cannot suppress, not done for the sake of reward." It further says: "Righteousness (*yi*) is appropriateness. Acting as is appropriate, thus it is called 'highest righteousness.' It acts with purpose and intention." Wang [Bi] comments: "Ritual (*li*) exalts refined reverence; when reciprocation is lacking, resentment arises. Thus it is called 'highest ritual.' When none respond, it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along."

Therefore, the loss of the Dao gives rise to virtue;
**[Wang comments: "The greatest of all—could this not be the Dao? Though its achievements are vast and its wealth boundless, possessing the myriad things, each still attains its own virtue. Yet if it cannot employ non-action or abandon purpose as its essence, then it has lost its greatness. This is what is meant by 'the loss of the Dao gives rise to virtue.'" ]**
the loss of virtue gives rise to benevolence,
the loss of benevolence gives rise to righteousness,
the loss of righteousness gives rise to ritual.
Ritual is the thinning of loyalty and trust, the beginning of chaos.
Forethought is the flower of the Dao, the onset of folly.
Thus the great person dwells in the substantial, not the superficial;
in the fruit, not the flower.
Therefore, they discard that and embrace this.

Chapter Thirty-Nine
Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear,
Earth attained the One and became tranquil,
the spirits attained the One and became numinous,
the valleys attained the One and became full,
the myriad things attained the One and came to life,
lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.
Pushing this to its limit:
Were heaven not thus clear, it would fear splitting;
**[Without the One, it would have no means to be clear.]**
were earth not thus tranquil, it would fear erupting;
were the spirits not thus numinous, they would fear vanishing;
were the valleys not thus full, they would fear drying up;
were the myriad things not thus alive, they would fear perishing;
were lords and kings not thus noble and exalted,
**[‘Noble and exalted’ should read ‘the standard.’]**
they would fear toppling.
Thus the noble takes the lowly as its root,
the high takes the low as its foundation.
Therefore lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," "the unworthy."
Is this not taking the lowly as their root? Is it not so?
Thus, to amass many carriages is to have no carriage.
Desire not to gleam like jade or glint like stone.
**[Wang comments: "When form exhausts its substance, this is not desired."]**

Chapter Forty

The movement of the Dao is return;
its function is weakness.
All things under heaven are born from being,
being is born from non-being.

Chapter Forty-One

When superior scholars hear of the Dao, they diligently practice it;
middling scholars hear of the Dao, and it seems to exist or not;
inferior scholars hear of the Dao, and they laugh loudly at it.
If it were not laughed at, it would not suffice to be the Dao!
Thus the established sayings have it:
“The luminous Dao seems dark,
the advancing Dao seems to retreat,
the level Dao seems uneven,
supreme virtue resembles a valley,
great purity seems sullied,
ample virtue seems insufficient,
established virtue seems indolent,
substance true seems altered,
the great square has no corners,
the great vessel is late in completion,
the great tone is soundless,
the great image has no form.”
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Only the Dao is good at bestowing and completing.

Chapter Forty-Two

The Dao gives birth to the One,
the One gives birth to the Two,
the Two gives birth to the Three,
the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang,
and through the blending of qi they achieve harmony.
What people dislike are only “the orphaned,” “the widowed,” and “the unworthy,”
yet kings and dukes use these as their titles.
Thus things may be diminished yet gain,
or increased yet lose.
What others teach, I also teach:
“The strong and violent do not meet a natural death.”
I take this as the father of all teachings.

Chapter Forty-Three

The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest under heaven.
Non-being enters where there is no gap.
Through this I know the benefit of non-action.
Teaching without words,
the benefit of non-action—
few under heaven attain these.

Chapter Forty-Four

Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is greater?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Thus excessive love incurs great cost,
hoarding much incurs heavy loss.
Knowing contentment brings no disgrace,
knowing when to stop brings no danger—
this is how to endure long.

Chapter Forty-Five

Great perfection seems flawed, yet its use is inexhaustible;
great fullness seems empty, yet its use is unending.
Great straightness seems bent,
great skill seems clumsy,
great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold,
stillness overcomes heat—
purity and stillness set the standard for all under heaven.

Chapter Forty-Six

When the Way prevails under heaven,
warhorses are retired to fertilize the fields.
When the Way is lost under heaven,
warhorses breed on the outskirts.
No misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment;
no fault is greater than the desire for gain.
Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is ever content.

Chapter Forty-Seven

Without stepping outside, one knows all under heaven.
Without gazing through the window, one sees the Way of heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Therefore the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
accomplishes without acting.

Chapter Forty-Eight

In the pursuit of learning, one gains day by day.
In the pursuit of the Way, one loses day by day.
Losing and losing again,
until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, nothing is left undone.
To take all under heaven, one must act without ado.
When there is ado, it is no longer sufficient to take all under heaven.

Chapter Forty-Nine

The sage has no constant mind,
but takes the mind of the people as their own.
The good I treat as good,
the not-good I also treat as good—thus attaining virtue in goodness.
The trustworthy I trust,
the untrustworthy I also trust—thus attaining virtue in trust.
The sage, in the world,
contracts their spirit for the world to harmonize their mind.
The people all fix their ears and eyes upon them,
and the sage treats them all as children.

Chapter Fifty

Emerging into life, entering into death.

The *Hanfeizi* states: "Humans begin with life and end with death. The beginning is called 'emerging,' the end is called 'entering.'"

Of those who follow the way of life, ten or three do so; of those who follow the way of death, ten or three do so. Yet among those who live, ten or three move toward the realm of death. Why is this? Because they overindulge in the pursuit of life.

I have heard that those skilled in nurturing life, when traveling on land, do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers; when entering battle, they are not struck by armor or weapons. The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn, the tiger no place to sink its claws, the weapon no place to lodge its blade. Why is this? Because they do not enter the realm of death.

Chapter Fifty-One
The Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, things shape them, and circumstances complete them. Thus, the myriad things without exception revere the Dao and honor virtue. The Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—none commands them, yet they ever remain spontaneous. Therefore, the Dao gives them life, virtue nurtures them, fosters their growth, nourishes their maturity, refines and ripens them, shelters and protects them. It gives life yet does not possess, acts yet does not rely, leads yet does not dominate—this is called profound virtue.

Chapter Fifty-Two
The world has a beginning, which serves as the world’s mother. Once you grasp the mother, you know her children. Once you know the children, return to abide by the mother, and to the end of your days you will not be imperiled. Block its openings, shut its gates, and to the end of your life you will not toil. Open its openings, meddle in its affairs, and to the end of your life you will not be saved. Seeing the small is called clarity; guarding the soft is called strength. Employing its light, returning to its clarity, leaving no misfortune for the self—this is called following the constant.

Chapter Fifty-Three
If I were suddenly endowed with knowledge and walked the great Dao, only deviance would I fear. The great Dao is level, yet the people prefer shortcuts. The court is excessively adorned, the fields are excessively overgrown, the granaries are excessively empty. They wear embroidered garments, carry sharp swords, sate themselves with food and drink, and possess surplus wealth and goods—this is called the boastfulness of thieves. How far is this from the Dao!

Chapter Fifty-Four

The well-established cannot be uprooted; the well-embraced cannot slip away. Thus, descendants perform sacrifices without cease.

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes genuine;
cultivate it in the family, and its virtue becomes abundant;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue becomes enduring;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue becomes bountiful;
cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.

Therefore, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world.
How do I know the world is thus?
By this.

Chapter Fifty-Five
One whose virtue is profoundly embodied is like a newborn babe.
Wasps, scorpions, vipers, and snakes do not sting;
fierce beasts do not seize,
birds of prey do not strike.
Though bones are weak and sinews soft, the grasp is firm.
Unknowing of the union of female and male, the organ stirs—
this is the perfection of essence.
Crying all day without hoarseness—
this is the perfection of harmony.
To know harmony is called the constant;
to know the constant is called clarity.
To indulge life is called ominous;
to let the mind command the qi is called force.
When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called contrary to the Dao.
What is contrary to the Dao perishes early.

The wise do not speak;
those who speak are not wise.
Block the openings,
shut the gates,
blunt the sharpness,
untangle the knots,
soften the glare,
merge with the dust—
this is called profound sameness.
Thus, one cannot be drawn near,
cannot be kept distant,
cannot be benefited,
cannot be harmed,
cannot be honored,
cannot be debased.
Therefore, one is esteemed by all under heaven.

Chapter Fifty-Seven
Govern the state with uprightness,
deploy troops with cunning,
win the world through nonaction.
How do I know this is so?
By this:
The more taboos in the world, the poorer the people;
the more sharp tools the people possess, the more benighted the state;
the more skills and crafts people master, the more strange things arise;
the more laws and decrees are proclaimed,
the more thieves and bandits appear.
Thus the sage declares:
“I practice nonaction, and the people transform themselves;
I cherish stillness, and the people rectify themselves;
I engage in no affairs, and the people enrich themselves;
I am without desire, and the people simplify themselves.”

When governance is muddled, the people are simple and honest.
When governance is meticulous, the people are lacking and flawed.
Misfortune—where fortune leans;
Fortune—where misfortune lurks.
Who knows their ultimate end?
There is no constant norm.
The norm reverts to the strange,
goodness reverts to the ominous.
The people’s delusion
has endured for so long!

Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
has edges but does not wound,
is straight but not overbearing,
bright but not dazzling.

Chapter Fifty-Nine
In governing people and serving heaven,
nothing surpasses frugality.
Only through frugality
can one be said to submit early.
Early submission is called the repeated accumulation of virtue.
With repeated accumulation of virtue, there is nothing one cannot overcome;
with nothing one cannot overcome, none can fathom one’s limits.
When none can fathom one’s limits,
one can possess the state.
Possessing the state’s mother,
one can endure long.
This is called the Way of deep roots, firm foundation,
long life, and enduring vision.

Chapter Sixty
Governing a great state
is like cooking a small fish.
Wang says: Do not disturb it.
When the Dao presides over the world,
its ghosts do not manifest their numinosity.
Not that the ghosts lack numinosity—
their numinosity does not harm people.
Not only does their numinosity not harm people,
the sage also does not harm people.
As neither harms the other,
their virtues converge and return.

**Chapter Sixty-One**
A great state is the lower reaches of the river,
the confluence of all under heaven,
the female of all under heaven.
The female ever overcomes the male through stillness,
for stillness is the way of the lowly.

Thus, when a great state humbles itself before a small state,
it wins the allegiance of the small state.
When a small state humbles itself before a great state,
it wins the favor of the great state.
Therefore, some humble themselves to gain,
while others gain through humility.
A great state desires no more than to shelter and nurture others,
a small state desires no more than to serve and attend others.
When both attain what they seek,
the greater must take the lower position.

**Chapter Sixty-Two**
The Dao is the mystery of the ten thousand things,
the treasure of the good,
the refuge of the not-good.
Fine words can be traded in the marketplace,
noble conduct can elevate others.
If people are not good,
why should they be cast aside?
Therefore, when the Son of Heaven is established
and the Three Ministers appointed,
though one may offer a jade disc preceded by a team of four horses,
it is not equal to sitting and presenting this Dao.
Why was this Dao so valued in ancient times?
Did they not say: "Through it, one attains what one seeks,
and with it, the guilty may be spared"?
Thus it is prized by all under heaven.

**Chapter Sixty-Three**
Act through non-action,
attend to affairs through non-affairs,
savor the flavorless.
Regard the small as great, the few as many,
repay resentment with virtue.

Plan for difficulty while it is still easy;
undertake the great while it is still small.
The difficult affairs of the world
must begin with what is easy;
the great affairs of the world
must begin with what is small.
Therefore, the sage never attempts the great,
and thus accomplishes the great.
One who makes promises lightly will seldom keep faith;
one who takes things lightly will surely encounter many difficulties.
Therefore, the sage treats all as difficult,
and thus never meets with difficulty.

**Chapter Sixty-Four**
What is at rest is easily maintained;
what has not yet shown signs is easily forestalled;
what is fragile is easily dissolved;
what is minute is easily scattered.
Act before things arise;
govern before disorder begins.

A tree as wide as a man’s embrace grows from a tiny shoot;
a nine-tiered terrace rises from a basket of earth;
a journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet.
Those who act will fail;
those who grasp will lose.
Therefore, the sage acts not,
and so does not fail;
grasps not,
and so does not lose.

In their undertakings, people often fail when near completion.
If one is as careful at the end as at the beginning,
there will be no failure.
Therefore, the sage desires what others do not desire,
does not prize goods hard to obtain;
learns what others do not learn,
and restores what the multitude has passed over.
Thus, he aids the spontaneity of the ten thousand things
and does not dare to act.

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
Those of old who were skilled in the Dao
did not use it to enlighten the people,
but to make them simple.
The people are difficult to govern
because they are too clever.
Therefore, to govern the state with cleverness
is the state’s ruin;
not to govern the state with cleverness
is the state’s blessing.
To know these two is also a model.
Always knowing the model
is called profound virtue.
Profound virtue is deep, far-reaching,
and turns back with things.
Only then does it attain great compliance.

**Chapter Sixty-Six**

The rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys
because they excel at lying low.
Thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys.
Therefore, if one wishes to be above the people,
one must speak as though below them;
if one wishes to lead the people,
one must place oneself behind them.
Thus the sage abides above,
and the people do not feel oppressed;
abides ahead,
and the people do not feel harmed.
Thus the world delights in exalting him and never tires.
Because he does not contend,
no one in the world can contend with him.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
The world all says my Dao is great,
yet it seems unlike anything else.
Precisely because it is great,
it seems unlike anything else.
If it resembled anything,
long ago it would have become small!

I possess three treasures,
which I hold fast and guard:
the first is compassion,
the second is frugality,
the third is not daring to be first in the world.
With compassion, one can be courageous;
with frugality, one can be expansive;
not daring to be first in the world,
one can become the vessel of leaders.
Now, to abandon compassion yet seek courage,
to abandon frugality yet seek expansion,
to abandon the rear yet seek the front—
this is death.
For with compassion,
one triumphs in battle and stands firm in defense.
Heaven will save such a one,
guarding him with compassion.

A good commander is not belligerent;
a good warrior is not enraged;
one who excels in victory does not contend;
one who excels in employing others places himself below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention,
this is called employing the strength of others,
this is called matching the ultimate of Heaven.

Chapter Sixty-Nine
On the use of arms, there is a saying:
“I dare not act as host but act as guest,
dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.”
This is called marching without marching,
raising arms without arms,
seizing without an enemy,
wielding weapons without weapons.
No calamity is greater than underestimating the enemy;
underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.
Thus when evenly matched armies meet,
the side that grieves will prevail.

Chapter Seventy
My words are very easy to know,
very easy to practice.
Yet none in the world can know them,
none can practice them.
Words have their source,
affairs have their lord.
It is only through ignorance
that I am not known.
Those who know me are few,
thus I am esteemed.
Therefore the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

Chapter Seventy-One
To know yet not claim knowledge is supreme;
to claim knowledge yet remain ignorant is a flaw.
Only by recognizing this flaw as a flaw
can one avoid being flawed.
The sage is not flawed,
for he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—
thus he is not flawed.

Chapter Seventy-Two
When the people do not fear authority,
great authority will arrive.
Do not constrict their dwelling,
do not oppress their livelihood.
Only by not oppressing them
will they not be oppressed.
Therefore the sage knows himself but does not display himself,
loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Thus he discards that and takes this.

Chapter Seventy-Three

Boldness in daring leads to death;
boldness in restraint leads to life.
These two may bring either benefit or harm.
Who knows the reason for what Heaven abhors?
Even the sage finds this difficult.

The Dao of Heaven
does not contend yet excels in victory,
does not speak yet excels in response,
is not summoned yet comes of itself,
is unhurried yet excels in planning.
The net of Heaven is vast and wide,
sparse yet nothing escapes.

Chapter Seventy-Four
When the people do not fear death,
how can death be used to frighten them?
If the people were always to fear death,
then those who act perversely—
could I seize and kill them?
Who would dare?
There is always an executioner who kills.
To kill in place of the executioner
is like hewing in place of the master carpenter.
Few who hew in place of the master carpenter
do not injure their own hands.

Chapter Seventy-Five
The people’s hunger
comes from their superiors consuming too much in taxes—
thus they hunger.
The people’s unruliness
comes from their superiors’ meddling—
thus they are unruly.
The people’s disregard for death
comes from their excessive pursuit of life—
thus they disregard death.
Only those who do not make life their pursuit
are wiser than those who value life.

Chapter Seventy-Six
When people are born, they are supple and weak;
when they die, they are stiff and strong.
All things—plants and trees—
when alive are supple and fragile;
when dead, they are withered and dry.
Thus the stiff and strong are companions of death,
the supple and weak are companions of life.
Therefore when an army is strong, it will not prevail;
when a tree is strong, it invites the axe.
The strong and great dwell below;
the supple and weak dwell above.

Chapter Seventy-Seven
The Dao of Heaven—
is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down,
what is low is lifted up;
what has excess is reduced,
what is deficient is supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven reduces excess
and supplements deficiency.
The Dao of man is not so:
it reduces deficiency
to serve excess.
Who can take from their excess
to serve all under Heaven?
Only those who hold the Dao.
Thus the sage acts without claiming,
achieves without abiding,
and does not wish to display worth.

Chapter Seventy-Eight
Nothing in all under Heaven
is more supple and weak than water,
yet in attacking the hard and strong
nothing can surpass it—
nothing can take its place.
The weak overcomes the strong,
the supple overcomes the hard—
none under Heaven does not know this,
yet none can practice it.
Thus the sage says:
To bear a state’s disgrace
is to be called lord of the altars of soil and grain;
to bear a state’s misfortune
is to be called king of all under Heaven.
True words seem their opposite.

Chapter Seventy-Nine

To reconcile great resentment,
surely some resentment remains—
how can this be called good?
Thus the sage holds the left tally
yet makes no demand upon others.
Those with virtue oversee the tally,
those without virtue oversee exactions.
The Heavenly Dao shows no partiality,
yet ever accords with the good.

Chapter Eighty
Let the state be small, its people few,
so that though there be tools of ten or a hundred men’s labor,
they are not used.
Let the people regard death as weighty
and not wander far away.
Though there be boats and carriages,
there is nowhere to ride them;
though there be armor and weapons,
there is nowhere to array them.
Let the people return to knotting cords and using them.
Sweet be their food,
fine their clothing,
secure their dwellings,
joyful their customs.
Neighboring states gaze upon one another,
the sounds of their chickens and dogs heard across the way—
yet the people reach old age and death
without ever coming or going.

Chapter Eighty-One
Truthful words are not fine,
fine words are not truthful.
The good do not dispute,
the disputatious are not good.
The knowing are not learned,
the learned do not know.
The sage does not accumulate—
having acted for others, they have all the more;
having given to others, they possess all the more.
The Way of Heaven benefits and does no harm.
The Way of the sage acts and does not contend.

The closing quotation mark indicates, "From this point onward, this should serve as the concluding statement of the preceding chapter." This interpretation is precise. Though the brushstrokes of classical scholars may seem casually gathered, they are free from the flaws of carelessness or arbitrary assertion. Master Wang, steadfast in preserving his teacher’s lineage, feared its dispersal and thus recorded and preserved it. His intent was pure and earnest—truly admirable. Having borrowed the text for a mere seven days, I instructed my second daughter, Zhao Chun, to transcribe it in full, and now append this colophon before returning it. Written on the twenty-eighth day of the intercalary sixth month, the year *gengwu* (137). Postscript by Shi Guangying.
