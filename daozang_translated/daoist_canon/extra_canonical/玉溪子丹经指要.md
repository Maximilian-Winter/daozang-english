# 玉溪子丹经指要

**Preface to the Essential Teachings of the *Elixir Canon of Master Yuxi* (Volume One)**

My ancestral home lies east of the prefectural city of Yichun. My distant forebear, the Court Discussant of the Observatory, retired to cultivate the Dao and styled himself the Old Man of Wangxi (now, great clans no longer invoke their ancestral prefectures but simply call themselves "Yu Huo").

Twice he encountered the Perfected One of Pure Yang yet failed to awaken.
(First beneath the pines of Yue Mountain; again on a moonlit night at Yueyang Tower, where he heard the sound of a flute.)

Later, while traveling to Mount Nanyue to seek Lan Yangsu, he met a man on the road carrying tools for nails and hinges. The man addressed him: "Are you not Master Li? Are you going to Yue Mountain to see Yangsu?"

The Master replied, "Indeed."

The man said, "Then I beg you to deliver a message to Lan: 'The Recluse Liu inquires of the Master—how does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?'"

With that, he made a deep bow and departed.

The Master walked several *li*, troubled and disquieted. He reflected: *This man knew my name, discerned my purpose, and his words were unlike those of the common world.* He sought him again but could not find him.

Upon meeting Lan, he recounted all that had been said.

Lan asked, "Is there not a white mole between your brows?"
The Master replied, "There is."
Lan said, "This was Liu Haichan. I have nurtured the sacred embryo, and none but he could verify its fruition. Pray, repeat his words to me."

The Master said, "The Recluse Liu inquires of the Master—how does one emerge from the ten-month gestation?"

Lan clapped his hands and laughed heartily. Suddenly, a rumbling like thunder resounded from his crown, and a figure radiant as snow and moonlight—indistinguishable from Lan—ascended straight into the heavens. Lan had already departed.

The Master burned incense, sighed, and withdrew. This was the "Long-Laughing Master of Yue Mountain." (See *Records of Marvelous Encounters in Our Family* and *Gazetteer of Yichun*.)

Upon returning home, the Master gathered hagiographies of immortals, Daoist scriptures, and various philosophical texts, shut his door to visitors, and pored over them by day. Before long, he too passed away without illness. (His *Xian’guan Collection* circulates in the world.)

I am his descendant. Though I studied the Confucian classics in youth, my aspirations were unfulfilled. Yet in the canons of Daoism and Buddhism, the classics of astrology, music, medicine, and divination, I explored all without exception. My heart, however, was especially devoted to the single secret of the Golden Elixir. Thus, I traversed rivers and lakes, journeyed across mountains and plains, and even bowed to beggars to seek their instruction. My resolve unwavering, heaven guided my heart.

I encountered a perfected one within the Gui Xian precinct at the Temple of Prince Wang, and later met him again in Jiangling Prefecture. A single word from him illumined the principles of the Seven Returns and Nine Revolutions. I once sojourned in Wudang, Xiangyang, the Han River, the Jiang and Huai regions—no place I did not visit. Yet few among them were enlightened, discerning masters of the subtle mechanism. Thus, I sealed my lips and spoke not a word of the Mystery.

By the *guihai* year of the Jingding era (1263, Southern Song, Emperor Lizong), I had traveled from Jingxiang to Xingcha, not far from Languan. There, I met someone from my hometown. In conversation, I inquired after old acquaintances, only to find the strong now aged and the aged passed away. Unbidden, tears flowed.

I reflected: As the Perfected One of Ziyang said, "To plan for oneself is gain, but to begrudge the Dao is the greatest transgression." Thereupon, I opened my heart in prayer to heaven, unlocking the Golden Gate and Jade Key. Compiling these, I wrote the *Essential Pointers to the Wuzhen Pian*, the *Book of Longevity and Everlasting Vision*, and the *Treatise on Dispelling Delusion*. For those who asked about the teachings, fearing the symbols and images were not exhaustive, I further expounded the functions of the Primordial Sovereign to clarify the advance and retreat of talismanic fire—this may be said to reveal the celestial mechanism.

Those who aspire to the Way must treasure what they have attained. Let each cultivate and each achieve perfection; when merit is complete and virtue perfected, all shall together verify the fruit of immortality. Should one grow careless, calamity will swiftly manifest. Though my words are coarse and unrefined, they contain nothing beyond the practical matters of the inner chamber. Gentlemen devoted to the Way should ponder them carefully. If enlightenment comes, it is heaven’s gift—not from the paltry transmission of my lips.

In the fourth month of the cyclical year *jiazi* in the fifth year of the Jingding reign (1264), during the full moon.

**The Conjunction Diagram**
Dependent on the *kun* position’s generative body,
Sown in the *qian* house’s chamber of intercourse.
One man and one woman form heaven and earth,
Three boys and three girls share a common end.
The elixir lies in the southwest—its native land,
Where the toad’s light shines all day on the Western River.

*Diagram omitted.*

---

**The Three-Five-One Diagram**
Three, five, and one—three characters,
Rare indeed are those who understand them through the ages.
East’s three and south’s two together make five,
North’s one and west’s four complete the sum.
*Wu* and *ji* naturally reside in the generative number five,
When the three families meet, the infant is conceived.
The infant is the one containing true *qi*,
After ten months in the womb, it enters the sacred foundation.

The mind-horse returns to the spirit-chamber,
Swiftly forming the three natures.
The heart-ape guards the grotto-room,
Where spirit and essence harmonize with the five phases.
Spirit, essence, soul, and intent—
Here the four images are distinguished.
They become the purple gold frost,
Gathered to form the fetal infant.

*Diagram omitted.*

---

**I. Nine Returns and Seven Reversions**
"Returns" and "reversions" denote the principle of inversion—
They are but the reckoning of metal and fire.
Master Ziyang said:
*Seven reversions: cinnabar returns to its root,
Nine returns: golden liquid reverts to truth.
Do not fixate on the reckoning of yin and yang,
But observe the five phases as the standard.*

Metal’s number is four; multiplied by earth, it becomes nine returns.
Fire’s number is two; multiplied by earth, it becomes seven reversions.
What the *Cantong Qi* calls "the secret in lead and fire"
Is the golden elixir—
The golden elixir is the divine water of the flower pool.
The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:
*In alchemy, nothing is more luminous than metal and fire.*
And again:
*The spirit-chamber refines its essence,
Fire and metal mutually propel.
The male yang is the azure water,
The female yin is the ochre gold.*
The *Cantong Qi* says:
*Pound and blend them together,
Hold them and enter the vermilion gate.
The secret lies therein!*

Master Ziyang said:
*The White Tiger’s primary scripture is the supreme treasure,
The flower pool’s divine water is true gold.*
Now, pointing directly to clarify—
May it open the path to awakening.

Metal is true lead;
Fire is divine mercury.
True lead is the *qi* of the prior heavens,
Born from the kidneys—
Thus the alchemical canon says:
*How sublime! True lead,
Preceding heaven and earth.*
Divine mercury is the truth within nature,
Issuing from the heart.
The *qi* within the kidneys conceals true water,
The truth within nature stores true fire.
Master Shi said:
*Take the medicine from the prior-heaven qi,
Seek fire in the essence of the great yang.
Knowing how to take the medicine and seek fire,
You will surely succeed in making the elixir.*
Without true earth, they cannot unite—
Thus the return and reversion of metal and fire
Are the utmost essentials of the inner elixir.
Seek them within the body;
Apart from this, all else is not the Dao.

---

**II. The Crucible**
The crucible is the yang furnace and yin tripod,
The jade furnace and golden tripod.
It is also called the spirit-chamber,
The upper and lower cauldrons,
The yellow chamber,
The recumbent moon furnace,
The enclosure of *kan* and *li*,
Or the single aperture of the mysterious pass—
Its alternate names are too numerous to list.
This is the pivot of the returning elixir,
The treasury where spirit and *qi* return and are stored.

In truth, there are two:
One is the inner crucible and spirit-furnace,
The other is the outer crucible and its symbolic form.
At the body’s vertical center, above and below,
Facing the navel in front and the kidneys behind—
Lead and mercury converge,
A single point alights within.
Master Ziyang said:
*To ensure the Valley Spirit never dies,
Rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the foundation.
Once true essence returns to the golden chamber,
A luminous pearl will never depart.*
This is what is meant by "establishing the foundation for a hundred days."

The outer crucible and its symbolic form
Take their model from yin and yang:
Water above, fire below,
Marking the crescent, full, waning, and new moons,
Aligning with the eight trigrams and four seasons,
Drilling and gathering the five phases,
Harmonizing the four images,
Refining dragon and tiger,
Restraining soul and spirit—
Inner and outer correspond,
Inversion and ascent-descent proceed.
Heaven and earth serve as father and mother,
*Kan* and *li* as husband and wife.
Dividing the 384 lines,
Circulating the fire-times;
Moving the five stars and twenty-eight constellations,
Arranging them within the crucible.
Sealing and fortifying the embankments,
Precise to the instant.
Master Ziyang said:
*First take heaven and earth as the crucible,
Then gather the sun and moon to cook the medicine.
Once you drive the two things into the Yellow Path,
How could the golden elixir fail to form?*
Another verse says:
*The *Cantong Qi* speaks of tending the capital’s outskirts,
Congealing spirit to form the body.*
And again:
*The true person lurks in the deep abyss,
Floating and roaming within the compass’s bounds.*
This is the single aperture of the mysterious pass.

The inner and outer crucibles and their symbolic forms
Are clearly revealed.
If you seek further outside,
Or indulge in passions, desires, and delusions,
Attempting to fabricate in the realm of form—
You will be separated by a thousand miles!

---

**III. True Lead**
True lead is the *kan* male,
The infant,
The moon’s essence,
The yin tiger,
The metal duke,
Lead within silver,
White within black,
Yang within yin—
Its alternate names are many.
Called true lead,
It is in truth the single *qi* of the prior heavens,
Gathered before the Great Simplicity.
Master Ziyang said:
*Simply capture the earth’s essence to subdue the vermilion mercury.*
It meets true mercury to form the elixir,
And is restrained by true earth to unite.

---

**IV. True Mercury**
True mercury is the *li* female,
The sun’s spirit,
The radiant maiden,
The yang dragon,
Mercury within cinnabar,
The female within the male,
Yin within yang—
Its alternate names are many.
Called true mercury,
It is merely the liquid of wood.
Master Ziyang said:
*Of itself, the heaven’s spirit restrains the water-metal.*
It meets true lead to form the elixir,
And is restrained by true earth to unite.

---

**V. True Earth**
True earth is *wu* and *ji*,
The central palace,
The *kun* palace—
It is not the spleen.
When lead meets mercury,
Without true earth, they cannot fuse and congeal.
Wielding the sword and laying down the halberd,
It governs the four directions.

**The *Ancient Dragon-Tiger Classic* states:**
The four seas converge like spokes to a hub, establishing great peace—all through the virtue of earth in the central palace, the achievement of the Yellow Emperor.
*The Covenant* says: "The three things of one household all return to *wu* and *ji*."
Master Ziyang said: "This is to send them back to the earthen cauldron, firmly sealed."
As the linchpin of metal, wood, water, and fire, the work of the Five Phases is complete!

**I. The Knife-Tip (Dao Gui)**
Master Ziyang said:
*If *li* and *kan* lack *wu* and *ji*,
Though they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.
For only when each embraces true earth
Can the golden elixir return and restore.*

Master Yuzhen said: "The great medicine never departs from true *wu* and *ji*—hence the immortals call it *one knife-tip*."
The *knife* is a metaphor for metal; the *tip* (gui), for the two earths. To *drink the knife-tip* is to flow *wu* into *ji*.
Master Shizhen said: "When you know how lead and mercury unite, you may drink the knife-tip."
*The Restoration of Life* says:
*The dragon and tiger, once entwined, gaze longingly,
*Kan* and *li*, now cleansed, conceive the embryo.
A single handful of the marrow of heaven and earth—
Seek it with intent, and seize it when it comes.*
This is to drink the knife-tip in that very moment.

**II. The Matchmaker**
The *matchmaker* is a metaphor for union. When lead is cast to meet mercury, without a matchmaker, it cannot be done—this is the Yellow Dame.
(It is not the spleen.)
Master Ziyang said:
*If true lead is to retain mercury,
The sovereign must not depart from his ministers.
Wood and metal, though estranged, meet by no cause—
Only the matchmaker’s allure can bridge them.*
This, too, is the principle of flowing *wu* into *ji*.

**III. Gathering and Harvesting**
*Gathering* is to gather without gathering; *harvesting*, to harvest without harvesting.
It cannot be sought with intention, nor obtained without it.
Master Shao said:
*At winter solstice, midnight’s half,
The heart of heaven never shifts.
Where the first yang stirs,
Before the ten thousand things arise—
All begins here, the place of action.*

*The Book of Changes* says: "The Dao of *qian* becomes male; the Dao of *kun* becomes female."
Thus, at sixteen, a man’s true essence is full, corresponding to *qian*; at fourteen, a woman’s celestial water descends, corresponding to *kun*.
*Qian* embraces *jia* and *ren*; *kun* embraces *yi* and *gui*—creation has its origins here!
Master Ziyang said: "When lead appears at *gui*, gather it swiftly."
This is the end of *kun* and the beginning of *fu*, before the primordial *qi* of *taiyi* manifests. Wait for the first yang to stir, then gather it urgently.
"Gold met at a distance is not worth tasting"—lest the delicate blossom scatter carelessly.
Master Fuming the Chan Master said:
*Gathering must be secret,
The heart sincere, discerning beauty from ugliness.
The thread of intent is hard to trace—
A moment’s ease, and the cold spring is lost.*

Master Ziyang said:
*Tap the bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow the jade mushroom,
Pluck the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife-tip.*
This is the pivotal mechanism of drawing lead into the crucible—it is not the art of "refining metal with the jade woman."

**IV. Fusion and Coagulation**
An ancient song says:
*The sun is *li*, the moon is *kan*—
Their essences devour each other.*
Master Ziyang said:
*Both things are born of the child producing the mother,
The Five Phases must all enter the central palace.*
This is the union of the five stars in a string, the sun and moon as one disk.
The later Master Ma Danyang said:
*Fire arises in water—banish the heart’s scenery,
Flowers bloom in snow—extinguish the spring of intent.*
Such is the vision at the time of fusion and coagulation.
Let those who study the Dao savor this deeply!

**V. Steaming and Refining**
*The Kinship of the Three* says:
*Below lies the *qi* of the great yang,
Steaming and seething in an instant.*
And:
*Rising and roasting on the mountain of rice,
The blazing fire is set below.*
And:
*A clamor of voices, so mournful,
Like an infant longing for its mother.*
And:
*When *yinghuo* guards the west and *taibai* crosses the sky,
The killing *qi* descends—what can stand unshaken?
The fox and dog guard the rat; the crow and sparrow fear the crane.*
*The Restoration of Life* says:
*Seize the essence and marrow of the crow and hare,
Hasten to gather and refine them in the crucible.*

An ancient song says:
*The divine fire steams the lead’s *qi* away by night,
The old turtle swallows the soul of *Zhurong*.*
This is the natural principle of steaming and refining. Those who do not understand creation should not lightly discuss it.

**VI. The Union of Metal and Wood**
Metal is the nature of lead; wood, the nature of mercury. In the profound and indistinct, they defy description.
Metal within the body is firm, strong, and pure, coursing through the four limbs—this is metal’s true nature, not the nature of desire.
Wood within the interior is soft, yielding, and compassionate, like sweating at the croak of a frog—this is wood’s true nature, the very root of benevolence.
Metal’s nature, nurtured by lead, becomes supple; wood’s nature, congealed by mercury, becomes dense. When lead and mercury meet, their natures intertwine in mutual longing.
Master Zhenyi said: "The male’s nature and the female’s essence, each needing the other, embrace and exhale, gathering and generating, transforming into true essence to become the divine medicine."
Master Ziyang said:
*Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s nature yearns for wood’s kindness.
Devouring each other, yet growing closer,
Only then does the man conceive.*
*The Covenant* says: "When metal returns to its original nature, it is called the returning elixir."
And: "Metal fells, wood flourishes."
Without the matchmaker’s harmony, there would be the peril of estrangement!

**VII. The Clarity and Turbidity of the Water’s Source**
The *water’s source* is a metaphor for the heart’s source, the sea of nature. When the dragon coils and the tiger crouches, clouds disperse and mists clear—then the waves of the sea of desire are stilled, the billows of the river of love are calmed. In stillness, heaven and earth are vast; in leisure, the sun and moon are long.
Whether turbid or clear, you will see it in that moment.

**VIII. Warm Nurturing**

Eliminate passions and dispel desires, withdraw sight and return hearing, cast off the limbs, dull the senses, and remain foolish all day—never depart from this for even a moment. Like a dragon nurturing its pearl, let no interruption occur; like a hen brooding her eggs, let the warmth never cease. Laozi said: *"Concentrate your qi and attain suppleness—can you be like an infant?"* And again: *"Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish."* The secret says: *"Forget the form to nourish the qi, forget the qi to nourish the spirit, forget the spirit to nourish the void."* The true person guards the center of the compass, and the qi is like spring within the blossoms. When the seasonal cycle is complete, the embryo sheds its shell, and the spirit transforms.

**Fire and Timing**
Fire is the fire of spirit; timing is the alignment of signs. Model the cauldron and furnace upon heaven and earth, use yang as charcoal, yin as water, and let the sun and moon revolve—one cold, one hot. The central sovereign issues commands, carefully harmonizing and blending. For the numinous medicine is formless yet subtly follows the mechanism of transformation, ascending and descending in reversal. Master Cao said: *"When the qi of Li is reached in a hundred moments, cinnabar emerges from it."* There are rhythms of withdrawal and addition, advance and retreat, bathing—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, regret and misfortune arise at once. Master Ziyang said: *"Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead, without knowing the fire and timing, it is as idle as leisure. All depends on the power of maintenance—if even a hair’s breadth is amiss, the elixir will not form."* This matter belongs to the celestial mechanism and brooks no careless discussion; its general meaning is already evident in the Fuxi’s workings. The wise and discerning, by daily reflection, will naturally awaken.

Of old, the Most High Lord Lao transmitted the *"Twelve Secret Verses on the Fire and Timing of the Golden Elixir,"* which are respectfully recorded here:

The sun and moon are the essence of Qian and Kun,
Their hexagrammic cycles are most clearly marked.
(From Kun’s end to Fu’s beginning, like a linked ring)
Three and five before, three and five after—
(The waxing and waning crescents)
Five and six make thirty, returning to life—
(The lunar nodes of a month)
Life and death cycle through twelve—
(The solar terms of a year)
Twelve divided into twenty-four.
(The twenty-four solar terms completing a year’s fire and timing)
The twenty-four terms mutually shift and change,
(Revolving without end)
All phenomena, every ounce and grain, lie herein.
Mercury, one substance, divides into two,
Transforming into yin and yang, becoming *jwei* and *wei*.
*Jwei* and *wei* then unite as husband and wife,
And one perceives heaven and earth within the crucible.

This song-verse was proclaimed by the golden mouth of the Most High, revealing the subtlest principles of medicinal substances and fire-timing. It is decreed that later learners of the Dao should treat it with reverence. If any should slight or disdain it, calamity will swiftly follow—everywhere, at all times, there are divine spirits! One cannot be too cautious.

Master Pure Yang’s postscript says: *"Great indeed are the twelve verses, harmonizing with the Five Thousand Words."*

**Bathing**
The *Cantong Qi* says: *"In the second month, the elm dies; in the eighth month, the wheat sprouts. When punishment and virtue stand at the gate, beware of peril."* Master Ziyang said: *"In the months of the hare and the rooster, when the time arrives and the signs of punishment and virtue approach, this is when the golden cinnabar should be bathed. If fire is added instead, danger will surely overturn it."* Thus, at the hours of Mao and You, one should bathe to balance it, refraining from advancing the fire.

**Shedding the Embryo**
Gradually grow larger, gradually grow more numinous, gradually come to completion. Master Ziyang said: *"A fruit ripens on the branch in due time—how is the child in the womb any different?"* Master Yunfang said: *"The child is young and not yet fully formed; it must rely on the nurturing kindness of father and mother. After nine years and three years, when human affairs are exhausted, it will roam heaven and earth without dependence on kin."* Looking back at the old body, it is but a heap of dung and earth. When merit is complete and the fruit is full, one ascends to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign. This may be called *"form and spirit both wondrous, merging with the Dao in truth."* The *"Song of Breaking Delusion"* by the Most Supreme Perfected says:

A fish by the roadside still flicks its red tail—
if you would save it, swiftly return it to the depths.
A man you meet upon the path, his life near spent—
if you would save him, swiftly teach him the Way’s principle.

Byways and minor arts branch in a thousand, ten thousand strands,
but the true Dao’s work is not so vast—it lies within oneself alone.
To spare the lost from delusion, I briefly name one or two:

Circulating qi is not the Dao—
breath and pulse grow disordered.
Swallowing saliva is not the Dao—
spittle is not the water of spirit.

Visualization is not the Dao—
painting cakes cannot serve as food.
Absorbing yin is not the Dao—
essence exhausted, life follows in death.
Avoiding salt is not the Dao—
food loses all savor.
Fasting is not the Dao—
hunger and weakness harm the stomach and bowels.
Abandoning one’s wife is not the Dao—
yin and yang lose their proper place.

What, then, is the Dao?
The Great One holds true qi,
qi intermingling yet not intermingling,
ascending and descending in emulation of heaven and earth.
Two things pair and unite,
arising from the Primal Beginning—
the marvelous maiden and the infant boy,
matched to achieve the Completed Success.
These are true yin and true yang,
husband and wife sharing one meaning.
Thus there is no need to abandon—
how can solitary yang accomplish anything?

To proclaim oneself an immortal—
is the golden elixir so easily attained?
The steadfast scholar does not speak plainly,
for the Great Cavern holds profound meaning.

The five phases do not proceed in order—
the tiger is born within water.
The five phases’ inverted art—
the dragon emerges from fire.
These words are truly wondrous—
such is the power of the Great One.

Master Ziyang said:
*"Abandoning one’s wife needlessly severs yin and yang;
fasting merely leaves the stomach and bowels empty."*
These lines quote the *Song of Breaking Delusion* by the Most Supreme Perfected.
Fasting is not the ultimate Dao,
but the teaching on abandoning one’s wife holds profound truth.

Nowadays, those bound for hell,
upon seeing Ziyang’s words,
immediately misconstrue them as the "Three Peaks of Golden Flower" arts of bedchamber yoga,
adding reckless annotations to mislead later generations,
dragging scholars and gentlemen into hell.
Little do they know that the intent of the Most Supreme Perfected and Master Ziyang
concerns the union of true yin and true yang within the body.
Thus the *Cantong qi* says:
*"The male does not dwell alone,
the female does not live in solitude."*
And further:
*"Things without yin and yang defy heaven and betray the origin;
a rooster hatching eggs alone will not produce whole chicks."*
Master Yunfang said:
*"Do not claim this body is wholly the Dao—
cultivating a single element is but solitary yin."*
Bai Yuchan said:
*"Within one’s own body lies husband and wife—
to speak of this to others is to invite mockery."*
This is the meaning.

Master Ziyang said:
*"If you can seek the inverted in daily use,
the sands of the earth all become treasure."*
And:
*"If you can turn this mechanism of life and death,
disaster transforms to fortune in the palm of your hand."*
And:
*"I urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,
lest you lose our priceless treasure."*
And:
*"If you grasp the mechanism of killing and understand reversal,
you will know how harm gives rise to kindness."*
Later, he admonished:
*"If you have not refined the elixir, refine it swiftly;
once refined, know when to stop.
If you persist in grasping without restraint,
you will one day meet with ruin and disgrace."*
This discourse guards against danger and considers peril—
it concerns the mechanism of reversal.
If the mind of lust is not extinguished and the fire of desire burns below,
the great treasure will be lost, the foundation of life will crumble.
When that time comes, how can regret avail?

I reiterate this to warn those who study the Dao,
hoping all will follow the true path and together ascend the immortal ranks,
guiding those who come after,
lest one blind man lead another blind.

The *Song of Flowing Pearls* by Immortal Ge Xixi says:
*Flowing pearls, flowing pearls,
cast to me in my smallness.
Wandering the four seas,
perusing ten thousand books.
Endlessly striving, forgetting sleep and meals,
consulting all friends, burning cinnabar to exhaustion.
For thirty years, sighing daily,
now at sixty, I fear descending the three woeful paths.
Thanks to my teacher’s transmission—
the primal qi of emptiness and nothingness.
First stabilize the golden crucible,
then establish the jade furnace.
The fire of Li excites,
the water of Kan takes form.
Jade liquid irrigates,
the chamber of mystery flows with butter.
The Perfected One delivers me—
only a great man can do so.
Hold this in mind, remember this—
entrust it to my record.*

From this, it is clear that the ancients’ diligent study of the Dao
inevitably met with the guidance of a perfected being.

The path of internal elixir refinement
employs no more than the two substances, lead and mercury.
First cultivate the human Dao,
with loyalty and filial piety as the foundation,
aiding others as the priority.
Treasure this one body,
cultivating inner work and outer conduct,
eliminating desires, calming the mind and qi,
moderating diet, reducing sleep.
The supreme medicines within the body are essence, qi, and spirit—
if essence is not recklessly discharged, primordial qi blends harmoniously;
if primordial qi blends harmoniously, primordial spirit rests at ease.
When these three are firm, the crucible gradually takes shape.
Only when the crucible is complete can one speak of refinement.

Someone asked: *"What does it mean that 'following the sequence gives birth to humans, reversing it becomes the mother of the elixir'?"*
I replied: *"Following the sequence is the great principle of human relations—
essence and qi divide to form humans.
Essence and qi become things, wandering souls undergo transformation.
With a body comes suffering, and afflictions arise from this.
Reversal inverts the five phases, harmonizes the four images,
gathers the qi of undivided primordial chaos,
seizes the essence of the dragon and tiger’s first union,
enters the yellow chamber, and produces the supreme treasure.
This may be called 'formless giving rise to form, a body beyond the body.'
When merit is complete and virtue perfected, one attains the rank of superior immortal!"*

**Essential Pointers from the Jade Creek’s Elixir Canon, Scroll Three**
*Zhang Ziyang’s Song for Daoist Liu of White Dragon Cavern*

Hare runs, crow flies—both luminaries rush,
first I hear flowers bloom, then autumn frost descends.
Vainly boast of a thousand years of wealth and longevity—
it is but a lightning flash amid the clouds.
A lightning flash—how fleeting!
A hundred years, thirty-six thousand days,
between them cold and heat alternately torment,
unaware, the rosy face fades in darkness.
Even with children and grandchildren before your eyes,
all become bonds of love that entangle.
When essence is exhausted and the body withers,
who can teach you to briefly halt and extend your days?

To briefly halt and extend—yet no means exist,
inevitably the body follows the flowing waters.
Look back at the sages and worthies of old—
how many knew the art of abiding in the world?

To abide in the world—there *is* a method,
but men of this age misjudge and stray.
They scramble into the mountains seeking herbs and trees,
refining lead, restraining mercury, concocting cinnabar.

Concocting cinnabar—the matter is far otherwise.
One must seek the crimson blood within the Kan palace,
then take it to the Li position to subdue yin essence.
Harmonizing and blending follow their proper seasons.

When the season is right, employ the matchmaker:
the Metal Lord and the Maiden wed in marriage.
The Metal Lord delights in riding the White Tiger;
the Maiden ever mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form.
The Tiger comes to rest in autumn’s mountain stillness;
the Dragon stirs its body in the deep pool’s surge.
The two beasts meet and battle in a single fray,
waves surging, seething like a boiling cauldron.
Old Ding and Yellow Matron lend their mighty aid,
shaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.
In an instant the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,
and a mysterious pearl is sown within the mud.
From this root and sprout it gradually grows,
nurtured in season with the embrace of true essence.
After ten months of gestation, swallow it whole—
unaware, the mortal frame has gained its spirit.

This matter is rare in the world,
not known to common men.
If one’s past lives lacked the bone of immortals,
how could one so easily encounter it?

Having encountered it, refine it at once,
for the fleeting light is swift as an arrow.
To catch the fish, one must cast the net—
do not merely stand by the river sighing in vain.
I hear you have known the medicine for many years—
why not gather your mind and refine mercury and lead?
Let not the candle be snuffed out by the wind,
nor blame heaven for the six paths of rebirth.

Lately, men of the world are full of deceit,
all donning the robes of Daoists.
Ask them what Metal and Wood truly are—
they fall silent, mute as the stricken.
Instead, they speak of “breath refinement” and “fasting,”
claiming other schools and paths stretch long.
Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
The method of the Great One containing truth is most excellent.
Do not fault my words for their wild and coarse tone—
it is only that men of this age are hard to discern.
Only when your heart aligns with mine
do I dare pour out my inmost thoughts to you.

The Kan and Kun bodies, the Li and Qian bodies:
Qian, with its yang, joins Kun to form Kan—
this is called “flowing Wu.”
Kun, with its yin, joins Qian to give rise to Li—
this is called “returning Ji.”
All things are conceived in the Zi hour,
when Qian’s Ren and Kun’s Gui meet in the north—
thus it is called the Kan palace,
and the Kan palace is none other than the Kun palace.
The southwest is the native land,
not the Wei or Shen positions.
The primordial qi arises from this,
and the crimson blood is the body’s single spark of yang essence,
also called “yang lead,”
truly the primordial qi of the prior heaven.
The scriptures say: “How sublime!
True lead, born before heaven and earth—
this is the true lead.”
The Li position is the Qian palace.
Knowing the season, gather this yang lead
to subdue the yin essence of the Li position.
Yin essence is yin mercury,
the liquid of Wood.
When these two substances unite,
they form the inner elixir—
not the cinnabar or mercury of the world,
nor the five metals, eight stones, herbs, or trees of form.

The matching and blending follow their proper seasons.
The medicine’s flavor is mild, Metal and Water each half,
with Yellow Matron as the matchmaker,
seeking the union of bride and groom—
the key lies in knowing the season.

When the season is right, employ the matchmaker.
The *Cantong Qi* says: “From the last day of the lunar month to the dawn of the new moon,
Zhen comes to receive the tally.”
This is the moment when the first yang stirs.
At this time, the female dragon hums,
the male tiger roars,
and with the matchmaker’s aid, they naturally unite.
The matchmaker is Yellow Matron.
An ancient song says: “Three and four dwell together in one chamber,
one and two as husband and wife.
Only with a good matchmaker may they wed,
and thus their bond grows ever closer.”
Ziyang says: “Originally relying on Wu and Ji as the matchmaker,
thus husband and wife are ever joyfully united.”
And again: “One must rely on the matchmaker’s guidance.”
Master Shi says: “Who knows the use?
The gist lies with Yellow Matron.”
Thus Yellow Matron is true Earth,
and true Earth is Yellow Matron.
When the male and female unite,
hard and soft intertwine inseparably—
none but Yellow Matron can achieve this.
She is the pivot of the returning elixir,
the embankment of Metal and Water,
the Yellow Center that penetrates principle,
rightly positioned within the body,
her beauty dwelling within.
Yellow Matron, true Earth—
her great outline is now clear!

The Metal Lord and the Maiden wed in marriage.
The Metal Lord and the Maiden—
as explained below—
“wed in marriage” means uniting lead and merging mercury.
The Metal Lord delights in riding the White Tiger:
the Metal Lord is lead,
embracing the essence of Heaven’s One,
born from the moon and lodged in the west’s Geng and Xin Metal,
emerging from the Kan position—
thus it is said the Tiger is born from water,
lead within silver,
white within black,
Metal within Water.
The *Cantong Qi* says: “Metal is the mother of Water,
the mother conceals the child’s embryo.”
Water is the child of Metal,
the child hidden in the mother’s womb.
And again: “Clad in coarse cloth yet holding jade,
outwardly a madman.”
This is true lead,
truly the single qi of the prior heaven.

The Maiden ever mounts the Crimson Dragon’s form:
the Maiden is mercury,
bearing the true yang’s qi,
born from the sun and lodged in the east’s Jia and Yi Wood,
emerging from the Li palace—
thus it is said the Dragon emerges from fire,
mercury within cinnabar,
the female within the male,
the Great Yang’s flowing pearl.
The *Cantong Qi* says: “Mercury is called the flowing pearl,
the Green Dragon accompanies it.”
And the scriptures say: “Crimson marrow flows as mercury,
the Maiden plays with brightness.”
This is true mercury,
the liquid of Wood!

The Tiger comes to rest in the autumn river,
the Dragon stirs its body in the azure pool.
The autumn river is the west’s azure pool,
just as the true Dragon of the eastern sea—
when it sees the true Tiger, one rises as the other falls,
both coveting the other’s advantage.
The two beasts meet and battle in a single fray,
waves surging, seething like a boiling cauldron.
An ancient song says: “The Green Dragon pursues the Tiger, the Tiger seeks the Dragon,
the Red Bird unites with cries of joy.”

Here is the translation:

---

This is the Dragon contending with the Tiger in battle—water surging, fire erupting, the cauldron seething and boiling over, their forces overturned and restrained, at times emitting the cries of an infant. The Yellow Dame and Elder Ding lend their numinous might; the True Man of Stone says: *"The Yellow Dame’s twin breasts are fair, Elder Ding’s heart is kind and merciful. Dragon and Tiger wage their war—how could the bound lord ever know?"* The Yellow Dame was explained earlier; Elder Ding is the gentle fire.

Master Yin the True says: *"I hold the Dao of the world, endless and boundless—yet I know only how to subdue the infant’s heart."* This is the true revelation of heaven’s secret. The shaking of heaven and earth startles gods and ghosts. An ancient song says: *"The sage seizes the workings of creation, grasps sun and moon to place within the furnace. Gently stirring the essence of heaven and earth, he gathers yin and yang to rouse gods and ghosts."* Gods and ghosts are the celestial soul and earthly spirit.

In an instant, the battle ceases and the clouds disperse—clouds gather and rain scatters, all sounds return to silence, and within the palm, fortune is transformed. A mysterious pearl is planted in the mud’s depths. The *Fuming Pian* says: *"At night, chaos falls to the earth—all the ten thousand images and signs know nothing of it."* This is the single drop descending into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court is the central palace, the Yellow Chamber, the Mysterious Pass—likened to the mud’s depths.

Master Ziyang says: *"Within one double-hour, the elixir is complete—this is the elixir’s daily accomplishment."* Day by day, it grows by a grain of millet, gradually forming the mysterious pearl. The Yellow Emperor sought the mysterious pearl in the Red Waters—without the formless one, none could obtain it. This is that pearl; the formless one is without thought or care. From this, the root and sprout gradually mature. Constantly irrigated, it embraces true essence. Master Sanguzi says: *"Establish the foundation for a hundred days, nurture it through the full cycle of stars. Simply guard the essence, tone, and spirit—water will naturally moisten, fire will naturally nurture, awaiting the qi’s fullness."*

After ten months, the embryo is shed, and it is swallowed into the belly—suddenly, one senses the mortal body already imbued with spirit. Master Ziyang also says: *"A single grain of numinous elixir is swallowed into the belly."* He speaks of *shedding the embryo* and *communing with the divine and sagely*. The *Cantong Qi* says: *"Golden sand enters the five viscera, mist scatters like wind and rain."* If this is the inner elixir, why does it speak of entering the belly, the mouth, the five viscera? Later generations doubted this and took it for an external elixir. Little did they know that *form arises from the formless*—this is what is called the Returned Elixir.

True Master Unity speaks of first exploring the primal chaotic qi of heaven and earth to establish the root; then taking the essence of Qian and Kun, subtly moving its traces to form the model; following the numbers of Kan, Li, Pi, and Tai to determine punishment and virtue; stealing the mechanism of yin-yang’s transformations to complete winter and summer. Yin is born after noon, yang arises at midnight’s start—thus Qian and Kun serve as the crucible and vessel, Kan and Li as the medicinal substances, the remaining sixty hexagrams as the fire times. Refining, nurturing, and subtly seizing the work of transformation—like fruit growing on a branch, the child within the womb, after ten months of fire times and qi’s fullness, suddenly sheds its spirit to enter the true embryo, uniting with heaven.

Thus it speaks of entering the mouth, the belly, the five viscera. The *Cantong Qi* says: *"It resembles a chicken’s egg, white and black aligned, a single inch in length and breadth, as the beginning. The four limbs, five viscera, sinews, and bones are all complete. After ten months, it emerges from the womb."* This is *form arising from the formless*, a body beyond the body. Clinging to the old frame traps one in darkness; emerging from the ninth mud allows roaming heaven and earth. One’s name is inscribed in the immortal register, one’s title is True Man—this is the time when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name established.

This matter is rare in the world, not something ordinary people can know. If one lacks the immortal bones of past lives, how could one easily encounter it? Having encountered it, one should swiftly refine it—time flies like an arrow. To catch the fish, one must cast the net; do not stand by the abyss and sigh in vain. I hear you have known the medicine for many years—why not gather your heart and refine mercury and lead? Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind, for the six paths of rebirth leave no room for complaint.

These words admonish Immortal Liu, urging him to gather his heart and refine mercury and lead. From this, it is clear that the inner elixir must be refined within oneself—it is not a matter of external medicine. Recently, worldly people have grown cunning, competing to don Daoist robes and claim the Way. Ask them what metal and wood are—they fall silent, mute and ashamed.

Metal and wood are explained in the *Essential Pointers*: *"Without knowing this, one cannot speak of the Returned Elixir."* Yet they speak of breath cultivation and fasting, claiming other schools and doctrines are profound. Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*? *"The Great One embraces true qi—this method is strongest."* The myriad minor side paths, though countless, have nothing to do with the Way of Golden Liquor and the Returned Inner Elixir. What is called the Dao? The Great One embracing true qi, the five stars aligning in a string, the sun and moon conjoining—this is how the inner elixir is formed, how the Dharma-body emerges. There is no second gate.

Do not fault my words for their crudeness—it is only because the world lacks discernment. Only when your heart aligns with mine will I dare pour out my thoughts for you.

**Regulating the Center Diagram**
*Preface to the Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram*

Three thousand six hundred methods, dozens of schools for nurturing life—all are side paths, nothing but crooked trails. Take, for example, breath cultivation to inflate the empty belly, the *Elbow-Behind Flying Golden Essence*, absorbing and grinding to move the river chariot, holding the breath as fire times, inhaling the clear and exhaling the turbid, connecting to realms and lamenting flows, guiding the turtle and turning the perch, mirroring forms to seek liberation, storing the chimney, guarding the brow’s center—all are adding heads atop heads, stirring trouble where there is none, overturning order and deviating from the utmost truth.

Thus, the hundred vessels boil over, the three fields collapse into chaos. What was meant to grant eternal life instead harms it. This is truly going against the harmony of heaven and earth, failing to align with nature’s intent. After simplifying and studying the *Cantong Qi* for thirty years, I have grasped its mysteries. Drawing from the threads of the alchemical classics, I composed the *Twelve-Character Formula of the Regulating the Center Diagram* to transmit to those who study the Dao. It takes rectifying the heart and sincerely cultivating intention as its foundation, the central pillar—abiding in the center to govern the external.

With the eight characters as auxiliaries, one regulates and governs the four seasons, responding to the internal from the external. Above, it aligns with the heart of heaven; in the middle, it examines human affairs; silently, it accords with creation, following the course of yin and yang. Externally, it models the five phases; internally, it orders the five viscera—thus forming the endless cycle of daily use.

It does not rely on action, nor does it depend on visualization. Serenely, in great stillness, it unites the primal mechanism. One must only sever cravings, stabilize the heart and qi, reduce thoughts, moderate diet, regulate breath, guard against drowsiness, and restrain the senses—nurturing the harmony of heaven. Within the four dignified postures, one merges with nature, without any complexity or difficulty.

For those who have already established the *yinqie* (the alchemical crucible), this serves to harmonize with the firing process and nurture the sacred embryo. For those who have not yet established the *yinqie*, this strengthens the primal qi, nourishes the spirit, and serves as the gradual foundation for its establishment. As for depletion, loss, illness, and affliction, this method dispels sickness, fortifies the primal, and serves as the art of supplementation, longevity, and life-nurturing—truly the gateway of simplicity!

**The Regulating the Center Diagram**
To "regulate the center" is to dwell within a compass, neither in the middle nor within or without—neither clinging to images nor attaching to things. It resides in the center of the body, the center of intention, like the self within a great mirror. Simply rectify the heart and sincerely cultivate intention as the central pillar. When all distractions vanish, the true person appears—like a fish in the deep abyss, swimming freely yet never leaving the square inch. This is the true person abiding in the profound depths, floating and guarding the regulated center.

When joy, anger, sorrow, and delight have yet to arise, at this moment, one may reside in the regulated center, floating and swimming while subtly governing the four seasons to rectify creation. Within the four dignified postures, one must not lose proper measure! When things come, respond and then pass, returning to the center—never disturbing the central pillar. Within the center, always maintain emptiness, not a speck of dust standing. Over time, neither indulgent nor restrained, one naturally attains its benefits.

Its essential subtlety lies in the six yin returning to *Kun*, all things reverting to the origin, the *Fu* hexagram’s first sprouting. The eldest son succeeds the father’s body; where the solitary yang stirs in concealment, before the myriad things are born—all arises from this point, the place of activation.

At this time, sit cross-legged in great stillness, concentrate the spirit within, and regulate the breath to be continuous. Silently guard it, and a single qi emerges from the formless void—dim and obscure, without color or shape, manifesting in the profound darkness of *Kun* and *Gui*, born within the kidneys to nurture the primal essence, replenish and sustain the primal qi, ceaselessly strengthening day by day. First, it dispels illness; next, it returns to infancy. Accumulated, it becomes the foundation of the inner elixir!

Master Tuzhen said: "This is the primal qi replenishing the primal qi—how could it be mere common cinnabar?" This is the supreme method of supplementation.

**Morning Layering (Zhaotun)**
The *Zhaotun* embodies the beginning of the noble one’s governance, the first sprouting of the myriad things—the inception of benevolence. At the *zi* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the kidneys. It comes unbidden, and one should treasure and nurture it. Regulate the breath so the ears do not hear it; simply listen to its gentle, continuous flow, harmonizing with nature, resonating with the key of heaven and earth. Over time, kidney qi merges with heart qi, the two qi interacting to descend sweet dew and produce the mysterious pearl!

**Evening Enveloping (Mumeng)**
"Enveloping to nurture correctness" is the sagely work, not losing the heart of the infant. At the *wu* hour, the qi of initial generation resides in the heart. Without thought or worry, in utter stillness, inwardly illuminate and unite with it. One should sit in quietude to gather it. Over time, heart qi naturally merges with kidney qi, accomplishing the work of *jiji* (completion and benefit).

Humans reside within the three powers, their body equaling heaven and earth, thus corresponding to the qi of heaven and earth and aligning with the essence of the true one. A person’s primal qi spans eight hundred and ten *zhang*, resembling the bellows and key. Thus, the great movement of primal qi follows heaven, and the lesser movement follows the sun. Yet people cannot embody and emulate heaven and earth, leading to rupture, damage, and the scattering of spirit—deviating from them on their own. How could heaven and earth deviate from them?

If one can follow its principles and grasp its mechanism, one may accord with the work of creation and engage in elixir refinement—the inner cultivation of the Dao of long life and enduring vision. Beyond humans, all are endowed with turbid confusion within the primal qi, merely transformed things. How could they govern the primal qi?

The *Cantong Qi* states:
"In spring and summer, rely on the inner body, from *zi* to *chen-si*;
In autumn and winter, employ the outer use, from *wu* to *xu-hai*."

It also says:
"Rewards and punishments correspond to spring and autumn;
Dusk and dawn follow cold and heat.
The line statements hold benevolence and righteousness,
Timely expressing joy and anger.
Thus responding to the four seasons,
The five phases attain their principles."

Therefore, *zi-chou-yin* correspond to spring, *mao-chen-si* to summer, *wu-wei-shen* to autumn, and *you-xu-hai* to winter.

*Zi-chou-yin* align with spring, when wood governs—wood embodies benevolence, the time of the myriad things’ arising. Thus, the two characters *xihe* (radiant harmony) nurture it, flourishing like spring ascending a terrace. *He* (harmony) is beauty—central yellow penetrating principle, rightly positioned in the body, flowing through the four limbs, manifesting in undertakings, the utmost beauty. Like an infant not yet laughing, crying without hoarseness—this is the utmost harmony. Unaware of the union of male and female, yet the genitalia stir—this is the utmost essence.

*Mao-chen-si* align with summer, when fire governs—fire embodies ritual, the time of the myriad things’ flourishing. Thus, the two characters *zhonghe* (central harmony) nurture it. Once harmonized, without excess or deficiency, this is called the center, where emotions and nature roam freely without turbulence.

*Wu-wei-shen* align with autumn, when metal governs—metal embodies righteousness, the time of yellowing grass and falling leaves, the harvest of the myriad things. Thus, the two characters *lianjing* (gathering and stillness) nurture it, fulfilling the nature of the myriad things.

The *you-xu-hai* align with winter, when water governs—water embodies wisdom, the time of the myriad things returning to their roots, when primordial *qi* begins its solemnity. Thus, the two characters *liansu* (gathering and solemnity) nurture it, aligning with the *qi* of Heaven and Earth.

The *Cantong Qi* states: "The true person abides in the deep abyss, floating and roaming while guarding the compass’s center." The true person is none other than the one true self: when congealed, it becomes spirit; when employed, it becomes mind; when still, it becomes nature. Neither moving nor still, empty yet spiritually penetrating—this is also called the true heart. It roams within the compass’s center, within the square and circle’s rules, serving as the master of creation. Its movements never err, centrally attuned to the four seasons, reliably nurtured to become true earth.

Issuing commands and decrees, it nurtures primordial *qi*, regulates and preserves primordial essence, transforming and generating purity. It harmonizes the five phases without coercion, thereby connecting with the harmony of Heaven and Earth. Thus, rectifying the heart and sincerifying the intent enables selflessness.

Only then are *Qian* and *Kun* at peace while *Kan* and *Li* unite, yin and yang harmonize so the myriad things flourish, the three luminaries align in proper measure, and great peace is achieved. Thereafter, the state prospers and the people are at ease, and the hundred bones are all ordered.

**Explanation of the "Spring in the Qin Garden" by the Pure Yang True Person**

The *Qin Garden Spring* lyric by the Pure Yang Wondrous Dao True Person encapsulates the supreme principles of returning the elixir, disseminated throughout the world. Though commentaries abound, they often remain pedantic and overelaborate—how could they grasp that this bit of immortal method lies beyond the three thousand six hundred gates? Thus, one must meet heart with heart, intent with intent. Only when one reaches the delight of that realm does one trust that it arises naturally.

One might say the essential Dao is not complex, the practice is effortless—free from the web of doubts, one enters the gate of myriad wonders. Here I have composed sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, pairing each with a verse by Master Tongning, totaling twenty pounds in weight, with direct annotations to reveal the profound mechanism. May the reader savor them carefully: grasp one corner, and all corners become evident.

**Preface by Yuxi the Late Learner of Yichun, during the Purification Festival of the Bingyin year of the Xianchun era**

**Lyrics for the Qin Garden Offering**

Lifting the topic at hand is itself the affair of the Dao-heart.
Hark!
On a fine night of clear brightness,
In the primordial chaos of the infant child,
One attains the delight within the stringless zither—
The notes and tones are not for outsiders to know.

Sevenfold return of the elixir, gold reverts to its original nature:
This is the sevenfold return, achieving success through earth,
Called the ninefold return.
When emotion merges with the sea of nature, it is called union;
The furnace refines golden radiance, termed the return.
Nurtured wholly by the power of true earth,
The refined spiritual essence emerges from the dusty world.

For the practitioner, the great Dao resides solely within the self;
The inner elixir must be refined a hundred times.
The Great One divides into three, yet one is obtained;
The great medicine is sought only within the body.
Pitiful are the myriad thousands who take it all for pleasure and ease.

First, refine the self and await the moment.
Refining the self begins with subduing the heart;
Gathering the medicine has its own season.
Turning the mechanism sets one apart from the vulgar;
The heart is serene and still, like an infant.
Observe closely: the Creator originally has no thing—
When spring arrives in Jiangnan, flowers bloom of themselves.

At the first stirring of the true yang,
Kun transforms into Fu—
Is this not the heart of heaven and earth revealed?
Sitting in stillness upon the rush mat, thoughts cease;
The spirit’s abode breathes in and out, gradually slowing.
Warm, misty qi returns to the celestial valley—
Know this as the time when the one yang returns.

In the depths of night, the water clock endures:
The depths of night are midnight,
When within the clepsydra one first senses the lengthening hours.
Vapor rises in waves, all sounds are clear;
Within the body, the winter solstice arrives at the third watch.
Who can fathom such delightful savor?
Only the sound of the bronze clepsydra’s dripping is heard.

The lead cauldron, warm and gentle—
The cauldron is not of metal, the furnace not of the moon.
Li arises from below Kan, Dui resides within the cauldron.
The jade hare’s decoction boils and surges;
The golden furnace’s fire blazes, its light resplendent.
Who in the profound darkness recognizes the existence within nothingness?
Within lies golden radiance, the foundation of the sage.

Light pierces the curtains—
The original spirit generates yang;
The spirit’s light flickers, the heart illumines inwardly,
All returns to the primal void.
At first, the azure qi—color yet not color—
Emerges from the dragon tower to return to the phoenix palace.
Beneath the lapis lazuli screen, candles glow in mutual brilliance;
By the Jiang’s head, the rain has just ceased.

Creation hastens swiftly:
Husband and wife return to the chamber.
When the moon reaches the yang palace,
Amidst the peach-blossom waves,
Dragon and tiger meet.
Red and black converge, unknown to the world;
All relies on Wu and Ji as the matchmaker.
A full ladle of the marrow of heaven and earth—
Seek it with intent and sip it in.

The work of advancing the fire is like navigating peril.
Fire arises within water, flowers bloom within thunder;
One must remain vigilant, applying skillful means with stability.
Within the realm of primordial chaos, qi is misty and warm;
On the branch of red apricot, it is the second month of spring.
Simply secure the golden gate firmly shut—
The turning mechanism is ever the treasure within the house.

By the winding river, the moon’s radiance is serene and bright—
A crow takes flight.
The oxherd and weaver girl share affection;
The Dao is fundamentally like the tortoise and snake,
Innately so.
When the yang crow meets the new moon, they unite in beauty;
The two qi mutually support and revolve.
This is the mutual affinity of lead and mercury—
Do not mistake it for the nine bends of the small intestine.

Master Xiaozhen’s verse says:
Above the winding river, the magpie bridge spans;
The oxherd and weaver girl’s bond—
This is the Dao itself.
The great medicine, the golden elixir, is born from this.
If you do not believe, knock upon the gate of Jia and Yi—
The twin youths will naturally guide you on your way.
The gate of Jia and Yi is like the gate of Wu and Ji.
This principle is profoundly deep and far-reaching,
Difficult to express with brush or tongue—
Yet it is merely the affair of the body itself.

Hark!
To know the path beneath the mountain,
Ask those who come and go.

At that time, one drinks the knife and measure:
The two earths are Wu and Ji;
The golden blade is lead and mercury.
Dragon coiled, tiger crouched, they guard the center;
Li and Kan unite, the light of sun and moon.
After drinking, one awakens and returns to the grotto palace—
In the flowery pond, the lotus fragrance is rich.

Who would believe a child is nurtured within nothingness?
Within the body, yin and yang;
Within the pot, sun and moon.
All immortals and sages—
Originally, there is no difference.
If one is not of this realm,
How can I explain it?

Refine essence to nurture the spiritual root, refine qi to nurture the spirit;
The merging of lead and mercury gestates the true body.
Suddenly, one emerges through the crown of the mud-pill palace—
Only then does one trust that the immortals do not deceive.

Discern the clarity and turbidity of the water’s source,
The separation of wood and metal—
Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is difficult to know.
Lead sinks, silver floats;
The clear is above, the turbid below.
The clear is golden radiance, the turbid is leaden essence.
To merge golden radiance with the liquid of wood—
This is the wondrous method of employing lead.
When the two substances meet, emotion and nature blend;
When the millet pearl forms, wood and metal separate.
Without a teacher’s guidance,
This matter is difficult to know.
Clear and turbid, sinking and floating, share a single source;
To take the clear and discard the turbid is even more profound.
The blending and separation must be distinguished—
The wonder lies in a single word from a true teacher.

The Dao is subtle and mysterious, the heavenly mechanism deep and distant;
To begin practice swiftly is still too late.
Only when one reaches the point of shame in learning
Does one realize one’s skill is not refined.

As Master Baiyun said:
Those who slander it are like grasping a giant melon stem to sweep Kunlun;
Those who taste it are like swans drinking from the vast sea.
The views of the well-frog and fence-sparrow—
How could they know the vastness of sea and sky?

Diligence without encounter—
One must eventually encounter it;
To encounter it and not refine it is utter folly.
Cherish each moment, do not let time pass in vain.
One must awaken swiftly and practice urgently—
When will the precious pearl in hand become bright?
If the hut is ruined, how can it be rebuilt?

Within the millet pearl, the world is vast;
The immortals and perfected ones enter it with vigor.
How many gaze in vain, merely admiring—
Sighing in vain that the heavens are high and unattainable.

Master Changchun’s verse says:
Sun and moon swiftly fly above the crown;
Time swiftly passes before the eyes.
Turning to look back, one is already old—
To begin practice swiftly is still too late.

During the Shaoxing era, in the southern part of Yichun City, the household of Prefect Wei was often shrouded in mystery. One day, a strange man entered directly into the study and called out, "Prefect Wei, come and speak with me." At that time, Wei was napping during the day, and his attendants dared not inform him. The stranger then inscribed a *ci* poem on the wall before leaving, titled *Sumuzhe*. When Wei awoke and saw it, he deeply regretted it, sending people to search for the man, but he could not be found. The poem read:

Gold surges through the waters, aligning with the Dipper;
Jade locks and golden gates—
Guardian spirits stand watch.
Crimson waters, cinnabar terraces,
Dragons and tigers roam,
Myriad forms in solemn array,
Vigorously casting forth the pearl.

Drink from the sacred spring, refine the fire’s timing,
The Great One’s furnace opens,
The elixir ripens, divine radiance shines through.
Fleeting fame and profit soon fade—
Begin practice swiftly,
Seek the existence within nothingness.
The path to Penglai—
Rely on three thousand deeds fulfilled,
Striding alone upon the clouds to return.

The *Scripture of the August Void* states: "Those who wish to cultivate the Dao must first establish merit. Thus, the Celestial Emperors, the exalted Lords of Heaven, the Perfected Ones, and the Divine Immortals all ascend to the sacred and true ranks through meritorious effort. Heaven records merit, and those in the world who cultivate the true and sincere resolve—once merit is complete and virtue perfected—shed their mortal forms to become immortals, immortals transform into Perfected Ones, and Perfected Ones attain boundless freedom, merging with the natural. When dissolved, they become qi; when at rest, they become human. With divine powers unrestrained, they transform without form, soaring through the Three Realms, traversing the hidden and obscure. Those who practice refinement must first cherish essence and treasure qi, anchoring the mind and concentrating spirit to establish the foundation of nurturing. Then, entering seclusion for three thousand days, internal work must not be lacking, until the embryo is fully formed, transcending to the primordial origin. External conduct also aids this, aligning with the Dao of Heaven. Thus, merit is never too much, and deeds are never too vast. With three thousand merits fulfilled, one becomes an immortal in the Great Veil; with three thousand deeds accomplished, one becomes a guest in the Great Veil."

Master Zhongli said: "Merit without conduct is like having no feet; conduct without merit leaves one unable to advance. Only with both merit and conduct complete are the feet fully prepared—who then can say one has no share in becoming a divine immortal?"

Moreover, in cultivating the Dao and attaining the Way, one first resides in Penglai, Fangzhang, or Yingzhou, becoming a free-roaming immortal. The Supreme One, the Primordial Lord, then summons one to receive the chart, inscribing one’s name in the immortal register, ascending step by step to the sacred rank, paying homage to the Jade Emperor, and bearing the title of Perfected One. One must further guide and enlighten those who come after, spreading teachings and transformations, until reaching the state of no cultivation and no attainment—this is called the natural.

A poem by a High Perfected One reads:
In the tenth month, the fire’s timing is cast aside,
Internal work is counted in three thousand days.
Further relying on external conduct to align with the Dao of Heaven,
Transcending to the primordial origin, one attains the rank of Supreme Immortal.

On the day when Master Quanzhen, Wa Zhang, attained the Dao, he composed the *Ci of Untying the Pendant*, saying:
Cultivators of the Way,
Your meritorious efforts are no small matter.
Discern the reversal and inversion of the Five Phases,
The wondrous principle is profoundly abstruse.
Within the jade furnace, dragons coil and tigers crouch,
In the golden tripod, the supreme treasure is refined.
The yang spirit departs the body,
Vast and obscure,
In an instant, it roams the Three Isles.
Once entry and exit are mastered,
Restrain and hold fast,
Seek further mysteries,
Merge with true emptiness—
The Great Void is the ultimate end.

Five Secret Poems:

**I**
Hiss and exhale—three feet, yet no trace,
Released and gathered swiftly as the wind.
Among a hundred thousand, select one or two,
This Dao is entrusted to you alone.

**II**
Extended like lightning, round as the moon,
Not for men—do not draw near.
To realize Buddhahood or become a Perfected One,
These subtle wonders require a master.

**III**
Severing nails and cutting iron, dispelling delusion,
The wondrous use, freely applied, comes from the master.
Returning at will, filling the sleeves,
Cherish and nurture it like a grandson.

**IV**
Radiance blazes, pressing upon the body,
Bones tremble, hairs stand on end—what is to be done?
If you are truly a man, you will not fear,
With a single flourish, the truth is revealed at once.

**V**
Among a hundred thousand, one or two,
A single flourish must align with the hearts of sages and worthies.
The Red Youth manifests divine auspices,
Withered wood blooms, iron turns to gold.

**Eulogy for the Portrait of the Pure Yang Immortal**
Supreme virtue defies description,
Primordial merit governs nothing—
What need for verses or praises?
Heaven is impartial,
Only virtue is aided;
The sagely teacher is never far.

With the bearing of a phoenix and the essence of a dragon,
A true Confucian of his generation,
His beard like a coiled dragon, his moon-like visage—
A descendant of Tang officials.
Awakened by the dream of yellow millet,
He severed the endless cycle of life and death.
Once the elixir was complete, he sought only to deliver others,
His rank exalted, ever aiding the drowning.
In the south, he refined gold lead and wood mercury;
In Bianjing, he tasted jade nectar and *suka*.
Spreading the One Vibration to perfect the true,
Countless living beings relied on his grace.
Wielding the Three Swords as admonitions,
Dark and countless disciples received his love.
At times, he wandered amidst white reeds and red dreams;
At times, he dwelled in the Purple Palace and Clear Capital.
Letting go of all, he beheld the Great Void,
Yet still stood in attendance in the Hall of Luminous Understanding.
Throughout the land, his noble demeanor was longed for,
His divine traces shone across the realm.

Master Guo on Mount Ao longed to return—
The master spoke of himself thus.
Daoist Peng still awaited enlightenment—
This was Peng Chongyang.

For eons, I have been foolish and deluded,
Entangled in habitual tendencies.
Since gaining discernment,
I have never measured my strength,
Indulging in every pursuit—
Only the Dao of immortals and Buddhas
Have I not yet inquired into.

My elder, Lord Yue Suchan of Changsha, a descendant of officials, shared my passion,
And we became friends despite the difference in age.
I knew he was a dharma-friend of Peng Chongyang and Hu Guchan,
All three having received the oral transmission of the Golden Elixir from Master Yuxi.
One day, as we spoke of the frontier,
He suddenly stood and spoke earnestly:
"In my daily visits to friends and searches for teachers,
I have spared neither body nor life.
Later, I met Master Yuxi,
And though you and I have only shared simple affections and casual discourse,
The time for learning the Dao has its own causes and conditions.
Since you have reached this point,
The time is now!
Wait for an auspicious day to transmit the teachings."
Thus, in the *chen* hour of the *jiazi* day,
He secretly imparted a few words,
Encouraging me to try them out.

Within less than a month, the elixir path proved efficacious—what was called "golden light suffusing the body," "jade towers and crimson palaces," "dragon and tiger, infant and maiden," all appearing in a fleeting trance with vivid clarity. Upon hearing this, Master Yue stroked his tears and sighed: "Since I first heard the Dao, my body has been plagued by fleshly ailments, preventing me from gathering my strength. Thus, I have yet to begin the work of stoking the fire. You, however, were born with immortal bones—this is no trifling matter. I dare not claim to be your teacher. Instead, I point to one among them who bears an uncanny resemblance to Master Yuxi. Simply don the robes and cap to capture the master’s likeness, and take him as your teacher. I now entrust you solemnly with all the master’s handwritten texts and these ten volumes."

Later, I heard from the slightly acquainted Administrator Shu Zong: "The master once stayed in my family’s home. When my father, the Pacification Commissioner, completed his term, we traveled together back to Huai, with the master lodging and dining in the kitchen boat, tethered by an iron chain to the stern of our vessel. As we neared Zhenzhou, a sudden storm arose, and the chain snapped—both boat and belongings vanished into the surging waves. Two days later, the master appeared at Yangzi Bridge, clutching a small bundle of clothes. As our boat was being woven together, he bid my father farewell in person before departing. Only then did we realize the master had attained the Dao of entering water without drowning. My family sighed in awe endlessly."

Since receiving the transmission, fifty-five years have passed, and now, at ninety, I have labored to depict the immortal’s likeness at the end of the preface to these ten volumes, committing them to woodblocks to ensure their wide dissemination. On this day of the fourteenth year of the Zhizheng era, Wang Junzhang of Zhongyang, with incense lit, respectfully inscribes this.
