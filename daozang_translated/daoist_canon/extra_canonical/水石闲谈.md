# 水石闲谈

**Idle Chatter on Water and Stone**

**(1)**
Master Zhang said: The common folk speak of "ten years of study, ten years of qi-cultivation," separating reading and qi-cultivation into two distinct matters—this is not the learning of the sages and worthies. For reading refines principle, and qi-cultivation tempers nature; the work of nature and principle lies precisely in the unobstructed parallel of reading and qi-cultivation. The Proclaimed Sage said, *"Learn and practice it at due times."* Herein lies the ceaseless refinement and tempering of nature and principle to purity.

**(2)**
Master Zhang said: Tao Yuanming reclined beneath his north window, calling himself a man of the era of Fuxi. This alone suffices to reveal his lofty integrity and unyielding spirit, his resolve to uphold the ethos of a bygone dynasty—only his words were so transcendent that others failed to perceive it.

**(3)**
Master Zhang said: The Daoist hopes that scholars will swiftly complete their reflections on worldly success, fulfill their human duties, and then promptly let go. One who retires boldly after achieving success has seized the moment. Those who drown in the arena of fame and fortune, clinging endlessly, are fools.

**(4)**
Master Zhang said: Within self-cultivation lies great learning; in harmony resides true nature. You must tolerate what others cannot tolerate, endure what others cannot endure—then the mind grows ever more serene, and nature ever more pure.

**(5)**
Master Zhang said: Fame and achievement, great or small, must be advanced or withdrawn in due time. How can one know the right moment? Simply reflect calmly amid worldly success: *"My fame and achievement extend no further than this."* If you can ascend thus, you have grasped the timing. Yet if there remains no end in sight, it is better to fall short than to overreach. Han Xin was not Peng Yue’s equal, Yuan Zhen not Bai Juyi’s—both were blinded by their insatiable pursuit of fulfillment. Had Zhang Liang or Bai Juyi harbored even a trace of ambition for advancement, Zhang might have easily risen again to the rank of chief minister, and Bai might have been promoted to prime minister. Yet who could guarantee they would not have met the same ignoble end as Han Xin or Yuan Zhen? Thus, only those who know when to advance and retreat deserve to be called wise.

**(6)**
Master Zhang sighed deeply: The boundless passage of years drifts like shadows in the current. I have seen countless men in the world chase fame and fortune—some seize high office in an instant, others amass wealth in a few years—but among thousands, barely a handful succeed. Even if they do, lofty titles and great power cannot overawe the King of Hell; gold and jade cannot buy exemption from impermanence. Some may live in wealth and longevity, others in nobility and ease, yet all end beneath the poplar trees of the grave, where autumn winds wail and the chill pierces the soul. If their descendants are unworthy, the estate crumbles in the blink of an eye—what benefit was there? Moreover, those who rise suddenly to great wealth or high rank often fear slander, false accusations, and malicious gossip. Should they fail to do good, they invite curses—some wither at a word, others fall into ruin at a breath. The world rejoices, every heart exults. Yet Heaven’s retribution is clear; it is not swayed by human speech. If one can see through these illusions and let them go, one will naturally cease to envy others’ wealth or status. Seek instead the principle of contentment with one’s fate, uphold the Dao of self-cultivation. While others clamor, I remain silent; while all are vexed, I alone am at peace. Why trouble oneself with others’ success or failure, prosperity or poverty, or the injustices perceived by onlookers?

**(7)**
Master Zhang said: Human lifespan is fixed for the superior, fixed for the inferior, but uncertain for the mediocre. The mediocre, neither wholly good nor wholly evil, cannot be prolonged by Heaven nor cut short—thus they are left to live and die as fate decrees. Preservation leads to life; neglect leads to death. Therefore, self-cultivation is paramount. Cultivate the self and accumulate merit and virtue to aspire to longevity and enduring vision. As for the inferior, burdened with many faults and evils, even self-cultivation cannot grant them long life. Their essence and qi are stripped away, and death is their punishment. The superior are different. If the superior pursue longevity, they may attain it; if they choose not to, their upright qi still sustains them among the ranks of spirits. Otherwise, they may reincarnate into a family of benevolence and goodness. Such is the principle of Heaven—what is difficult to understand?

**(8)**

Zhang Zi said: Since ancient times, in moments of loyalty, integrity, chastity, and martyrdom—when one sacrifices oneself to fulfill benevolence—there appears the vision of the Seven-Return Elixir. When the heart remains unmoved and the will undivided, the vast and upright qi arises within, generating its rectitude. No matter the blades, saws, cauldrons, or boiling oil, all are seen as mere demonic trials; unwavering, one gathers and preserves righteous qi, consolidating it without dissipation until it solidifies into indestructible firmness. At this stage of the firing process, the radiant qi of the hero endures for ten thousand years without fading. When Daoist adepts enter the chamber to tend the furnace, they must possess this very resolve.

**(9)**
Zhang Zi said: While one’s parents are alive, one should seize the time to fulfill filial piety to the utmost; otherwise, once their countenance is gone, remorse and sorrow in hindsight bring inexpressible grief. Today, in the autumn mountains and forests, those observing mourning rites hear my words:
*"Again, the autumn winds sweep through the woods.
Beyond azure clouds, the heart longs for kin.
Yellow reeds and white grass wither in frost—
Tears pour into the Yellow Springs, fathoms deep!"*

Recite this poem and try—can one not be stricken with sorrow?

**(10)**
Zhang Zi said: In the matter of filial piety, each must fully exert their innate goodness, and though not identical in form, they converge in the single word "filial." To avoid disappointing one’s family’s expectations, one should return home to serve and support them; to seek the righteousness of illustrious renown, one should pledge oneself to the imperial path. If one wishes to preserve the body as filial devotion, one should reduce desires and purify the heart—empty talk alone is of no benefit. You, my disciples, have not yet achieved illustrious renown, and your time at home is scant; thus, it would be better to reduce desires and purify the heart, embodying the teachings of the two sages, Zeng and Meng. If one does not purify the heart and reduce desires, one merely indulges in vain hopes for fame, yet fame is not attained; vain hopes for profit, yet profit is not secured; vain hopes for all things, yet nothing is gained. Body and spirit wither, the parents’ countenance has not yet aged, yet the child already bears the appearance of exhaustion. This is to speak of filial piety, yet filial piety will not endure long—it only brings parents worry over illness, concern over distant travels. Should misfortune strike and the child die, it only adds to the parents’ grief, forcing them to bury their own. Reflecting on this, where does filial piety lie? Would one not become a lifelong sinner? My Way takes purifying the heart and reducing desires as its foundation, for it is truly the method of preserving the body. If one further tempers this with a gentle demeanor, respectful bearing, and sincere intent, then one will have attained filial piety.

**(11)**
Zhang Zi said: After Confucian scholars achieve the rank of *maocai*, many end up settling into the path of tutoring in private academies.

Know that relying on a tutor’s stipend for one’s parents’ support is also a provisional means of the Confucian school. Yet Confucius and Mencius bequeathed poetry and books to later generations not to teach men to fish for profit. As for the custom of remuneration in later ages, even using such funds to serve one’s parents is but a minor application yielding minor results. Still, one must not be insatiably greedy, scheming for the ease of descendants and turning poetry and books into a den of profit—lest one become a sinner against the sages.

**(12)**
Zhang Zi said: Those who wish to fulfill loyalty and filial piety, to establish great integrity, must first purify the heart and nurture qi. Without a true heart and true qi, one cannot fulfill loyalty and filial piety or establish great integrity. For loyalty and filial piety arise from the true heart, while great integrity originates in true qi. To attain true heart and true qi, one should take stillness as the foundation, for only then can one preserve the true heart and cultivate true qi.

**(13)**
Zhang Zi said: One should seek inner joy, not outer joy. Confucius’s joy lay within—this is inner joy. If one merely covets externals, seeking outer joy, one only invites vexation.

**(14)**
Zhang Zi said: Many Confucian scholars’ households suffer from seminal emission disorders. Though this stems from impure heart-fire, it is also caused by all-night conversation and endless reading, which exhausts the qi of the cinnabar field, scattering it at the corners of the mouth. Thus, essence loses its companion, giving rise to seminal emission. Those who wisely preserve the body should speak less and read with moderation.

**(15)**
A young man suffered from lethargy and weakness. Zhang Zi said: "You should take advantage of these clear winter days to move small stones and build a low wall, or carry a mountain hoe to clear away withered grass—stop before you grow hungry. Do this daily, moving leisurely, like a gardener, and the qi and blood throughout your body will flow freely without stagnation."

**(16)**
Zhang Zi said: "Heroic individuals do good and perform good deeds solely for the peace of their own hearts, without harboring any thought of borrowing virtue to seek blessings. The luminous Lord on High merely follows the Dao of blessing the good and punishing the licentious in dealing with ordinary people, not in dealing with heroes. While doing good and receiving blessings is fitting for heroes, it is not something all heroes necessarily attain. Yet their resounding deeds, their virtuous actions and noble conduct, endure through heaven and earth for a thousand years without decay. The incense of their spirit is offered in the unseen realm—is this not how Heaven repays heroes? Observing the loyal ministers, filial sons, righteous scholars, and benevolent men of antiquity who met untimely ends in service to loyalty, I am both moved and enlightened."

**(17)**
Zhang Zi said: "For Confucians, reading to establish character is an urgent task, yet the Way of preserving the body encompasses the cultivation of character within it. To preserve the body, one must eliminate arrogance, extravagance, dissipation, and licentiousness, sweeping away perverse conduct—thus, preserving the body inherently includes establishing character. The Way of preserving the body was transmitted by Master Zeng and later expounded and magnified by Mencius. Nurturing the heart and reducing desires, maintaining resolve and guarding the qi—these are the guiding principles of preserving the body. Moreover, the Dao of cultivating the true self takes this as its proper gateway. Yet the human heart is obscured: when it hears of preserving the body, it dismisses it as commonplace; when it hears of cultivating the true self, it deems it extraordinary. For those who seek to cultivate the true self and awaken to the Dao, the path is already arduous indeed."

Master Zhang said: "Should the teachings of Confucius and Mencius vanish for a single day, the world would have no good people; should the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi vanish for a single day, heroes would have no path of retreat."

Layman Wang remarked that abstaining from meat was merely a way to eliminate flesh-eating. Master Zhang replied: "Flesh and vegetables are not the same. Daoists proscribe the five pungent plants—leeks, scallions, garlic, onions, and mustard greens—all of which are acrid and foul, disturbing the qi. The character for 'pungent' (荤) is composed of 'zhou' (州) and 'jun' (军), as if to say 'soldiers among the grasses,' for they are inherently aggressive. Those who cultivate qi must avoid them. Buddhists emphasize a plain diet, for it entails abstaining from killing and releasing life; thus, they reject all meat from animals. Yet worldly people eat plainly only on the first and fifteenth days of the lunar month, while indulging in rich foods at other times—such plainness is no plainness at all. For those who would eliminate flesh through a plain diet, I say: better to cultivate the heart than merely the mouth. Heed the gentleman’s counsel to keep distant from the kitchen. Nurturing qi naturally nurtures the belly; follow the perfected one’s prohibition against foul odors."

Master Zhang addressed two Daoist priests, Renru and Shouru, saying: "All people attend to external matters, but they must also attend to their inner cultivation. Cultivate inner purity and richness, and external blessings will follow. Stealing a moment of leisure amid busyness grants a moment of nourishment; reading for a day in stillness brings a day’s benefit. If one only chases outward things, the root is lost, and one grows ever more shallow."

Master Zhang said to Zhuo’an: "Preserving the body rests on calming the heart and nurturing the kidneys. When the heart is calm, the fire of *li* does not flare outward; when the kidneys are nurtured, the water of *kan* does not overflow. If fire does not flare outward, there will be no illness of restless spirit, and the heart grows ever calmer. If water does not overflow, there will be no peril of seminal leakage, and the kidneys grow ever clearer. When the kidneys are clear, the fire of life does not surge upward; when the heart is calm, the fire of spirit can shine downward. Spirit and essence congeal and intermingle, forming fetal breathing—this can dispel illness and prolong life."

On the third day of the third month, the disciples in the mountains bathed by the banks of the Jin River, felt the wind beneath the verdant woods, and listened to the cuckoo’s call. Suddenly, a leaf fell to the ground, folded like a letter. Opening it, they found inside something resembling *zilan* orchid, wrapped within.

The locals were asked, and they replied: "It is the *Du Yu* pearl." When asked what it was used for, they said: "We do not know." Just then, Master Zhang, wearing a bamboo hat, strolled over leisurely and said to the two or three disciples: "Do you wish to know the story of the *Du Yu* pearl? After the King of Shu entered the mountains, the people of Shu longed for him, so the king commanded the *Zi Gui* to bestow these pearls upon the people of Shu. The *Zi Gui*—the king’s avian messenger—was originally called the *Xie Bao*. The king said, *'Zi Gui, return to my kingdom and console my people.'* Thus, the *Xie Bao* was also named *Xie Bao* (Repayment), for *Du Yu* commanded it to repay the people’s gratitude.

These pearls may be red, yellow, blue, or purple—no single color is fixed. They can ward off malevolent spirits in households. When encountering such spirits, one must secretly raise the pearl and cast it, and the spirits will disperse. However, no one must perceive this; silently recite: *'King of Shu, King of Shu, Pearl Radiance, Pearl Radiance, cast out the ghost, the ghost departs, slay the ghost, the ghost perishes. I wield the sacred pearl, its rays ever bright. Where yin does not end, yin ends and yang returns. By the command of the Primordial Master of the Nine Heavens, swiftly, swiftly, as the statute decrees!'*

It is also said that the number of pearls can divinely foretell the abundance or scarcity of the year’s harvest."

Master Zhang said: One should nurture the body in stillness, act according to one’s station, and remain content with circumstances—thus the heart and nature become harmonious, and the spirit and qi serene and unadorned.

Master Zhang, on being insulted, said: You must strictly discipline your young son; if his nature and temperament are spoiled, when he grows up you will resent him—this is loving him only to abandon him.

Master Zhang, accompanied by Yunshi, Zhuo’an, and others, ventured into the chaotic mountains on a winter’s cold day and heard the murmuring whispers of ghosts. Inquiring of the local earth deity, he learned they were the ancestral spirits and paternal souls of the dead. Amidst the gloom and desolation, graves lay desolate, coffins crumbled, and the garments and skeletal remains suffered the cold’s intrusion. Who could witness this without a shudder of sorrow and a pang of grief? This is why the ancients practiced grave-visiting and offered winter garments.

Master Zhang said to the mountain dwellers: In summer, one should rise early to attend to tasks, then seek a slightly cool place after sunrise to collect the mind in quiet sitting. Never sleep during the intense heat of midday—if sleep does not dull the senses, it may be tolerable, but if it induces stupor, the essence-fluid will transform into sweat and escape. What a pity! What a pity!

Master Zhang said: Yesterday, while traveling through Liangjie Mountain, I saw an old woman sitting on a cliff, laughing and then weeping. I suspected a fox spirit, but she soon fell from the cliff and died. Drawing near, I saw she had been struck by lightning—she was a thousand-year-old raccoon-dog demon. I did not understand her purpose, so I asked the Fire Chariot Spirit-Official, who replied that she had once devoured humans, and thus was struck down. If such creatures exist in Liangjie Mountain beneath the bright sky of day, how much more must lurk in the depths of remote and desolate mountains!

Master Zhang sighed and said: People rush about from dawn to dusk, always saying they have no choice. But what truly leaves them no choice? Only that their hearts harbor this "no choice," so they constantly speak of having no choice. Yet if they have no choice now, they will surely have a choice in the future—when they are old and dead, that is what "having a choice" means. What "no choice" remains then? You who possess wisdom and discern the subtlest signs, put an end to this now.

Master Zhang addressed those treating consumptive exhaustion: To manage illness, one must have a tranquil heart, an even heart, a patient heart—never seek swift results. If medicine does not worsen the condition, that is swift enough. Then, slight improvement on the first day, slight improvement on the second, gradual improvement by the third—though slow, this is immeasurably better than daily decline and imminent death.

---

Master Zhang wandered above the clouds of Mount Yue, resting at the Pavilion of Whispering Winds. Addressing his disciples, he said: Today, the mountains are clear and the world serene; the heart roams far, the place lies remote—truly a rare scene. Let each of you compose a new poem, then invite Hanxuzi to play the zither once more, to stir our poetic inspiration. Is this not joyous? Even if one cannot play the zither, one must learn to listen well, to dissolve all murky, swirling desires and muddled, deluded thoughts. Listening quietly to the zither’s sound is like wandering in the distant past, where all noise fades, the mind soars freely, transcending the mundane—cool and virtuous, profound and serene. It is as if I, too, am playing the zither, forgetting worldly affairs, meeting Yu and Zhou of old, encountering Confucius and Mencius. Boya and Ziqi would follow after. Only then is one a refined recluse; otherwise, one is but a vulgar, shallow person—unworthy of such company!

I deeply cherish this autumnal qi, so pure and solemn. How I long to carry a flask of wine, a zither, and a flute, ascending the highest peak, laughing as I gaze upon the vast earth and rivers—mist curling, clouds drifting, watching the warm sun over villages, the distant, rippling rivers. Then, the flute’s notes rise from the treetops, the zither’s sound emerges from the rocks, and the wine’s fragrance mingles among the crimson springs and jade peaks. Mountain birds sing freely, emerald hues scatter down—what bliss! Do any of you share this delight?

Master Zhang said to an elderly Daoist: "At your age, you must settle your heart and ground yourself in practice. Let worldly affairs be governed by the three words 'pay them no mind,' and all myriad thoughts will melt like ice. Every person’s body contains apertures, and within each aperture resides vital qi. Without this vital qi, how could one preserve the physical form? It is merely that qi arises without people knowing to quietly observe it.

Now, I shall tell you eight idle words to serve as your evening drum and morning bell:
*One must grasp some apertures, know some omens, preserve some spirit, and cultivate some qi—then you will think with clarity, see through illusions, act with efficacy, and become a true person.*
This is casual talk, yet it is precisely what you ought to study with wholehearted devotion.

Stability is the heart; stillness is the spirit. Though apertures exist, if the heart is not settled within them, how can one perceive the omens?"

---

Master Zhang said to the mountain-dwelling Daoist followers: "Master Hui’s invitation to the Dao is infused with boundless compassion. While it may be difficult for people to succeed, this is the shared malady of millennia of learning. Yet with soaring aspirations, the Dao will not obstruct the heroic. What one fears is weakness and listlessness; if you rouse your spirit, the patriarchs will surely aid you in silence."

---

Master Zhang said to the mountain recluses: "To be called a recluse in the mountains, one must know the joy of mountain forests. Yet this joy does not lie in the mountains and forests themselves, but in having the means to delight in them—only then do the mountains and forests enhance that joy. To be at ease with the mountains and forests in emptiness and stillness, in seclusion and refinement, in simplicity and tranquility—this is what it means to truly delight in the joy of mountains and forests."

---

Master Zhang said: "To be able to attain leisure in an instant is the mark of a master. If you say, 'Wait a moment, let me first put aside my affairs for a few days, then I will slowly seek understanding,' this is but the talk of mediocre men and the mindset of fools."

---

Master Zhang said to Yuanyangzi: "If you can sever worldly attachments and withdraw from the red dust, your life’s course can be settled today. From now on, you will wander freely, forever without peril. How joyful life becomes at this point! Fine weather, beautiful mountains and waters, elegant pavilions, good friends, and splendid scenery—from this day forward, you may receive, embrace, and realize them all."

---

Master Zhang said: "The geography of immortals must be comprehended alongside the Dao of inner alchemy."

Master Zhang remarked of Yuanyangzi’s Yiyun Mountain Villa: "This dwelling, nestled between two mountains, neither engulfing nor expelling, now opening, now closing, employs the method of *yizhan* to construct a home of peace—truly the great central pole between the Yellow Court below and the Pass of Origin above. Such celestial subtleties, who else understands them?"

---

Master Zhang said: "Mountains still, most fitting for discoursing on the supreme Dao; heart clear, only loving the fragrance of fame and incense—this is the wondrous scene before us. I have casually composed these two lines; let Yuanyang continue them for me."

---

Master Zhang addressed the Daoist followers: "One must leave the household while in the household, transcend the dust while in the dust, attend to affairs without clinging to them, and engage with things without attachment—only then is one a seed of the Daoist family. There is no need to be bound by inaction, nor mired in the contemplation of affairs."

---

Master Zhang, clad in a leaf-woven cloak, roamed carefree beyond the clouds. One day, the sound of stamping songs arose from the mist. His disciples listened, for it lamented the difficulty of transmitting the great Dao and the idle passing of days by those in yellow caps. The song went:

*"Time flies swiftly,
Yet the study of Dao lags behind.
Amid flowing waters and empty mountains,
I walk alone in reflection.
I fear only the scenes before my eyes—
In an instant, breath may cease in my throat,
And all becomes a dreamless void.
While alive, a dreamless void;
Upon waking, naught but walking corpses of flesh.
I fear most when impermanence arrives,
And cold bones evoke sorrow.
Then, through kalpas of rebirth,
One remains utterly unaware—
Like rain striking the flower branches."*

---

Master Zhang took up Han Xian’s fisherman’s drum, beating time to convey the sentiment as he sang *The Song of Desolation Across the Dusty Sea*:

*"Flying Dragon Lad, roaming the heavens,
Never speaking but of loyalty and filial piety,
Coming and going all to Penglai Isle.
Seeking to transmit the Dao, he seeks men,
Yet sighs how karmic ties never align,
And how few in life ever turn back.
A candle in the wind, a boat on the water—
So easily snuffed out, so swiftly swept downstream.
In the gardens of power and profit,
Which families’ bonds endure?
All turn to enmity in the end.
In a blink, impermanence seizes them,
And bleak mist and creeping vines bury their skulls.
Woodcutters pass to and fro,
Shepherd boys wear smooth the gravestones.
Ask the rustic: ‘Whose tomb is this?’
A few words—ignorant, ignorant—
And ghostly tears drip in the dark.
Alas! The crane-riding immortal departs—let it be."*

---

Master Zhang emerged from the Pure Subtlety Heavenly Realm and entered the serene depths of a distant mountain, where several disciples brewed spring water in warm fellowship. The Master said, "Now I present *The Primordial Immortal’s Song* in jest to Yuanyang. Let all here sing it, that it may become a fine tale of forests and springs." At that moment, Li the Mountain Recluse struck bamboo to summon the tortoise, Yang the Scholar sounded the zither to call the wind, and Liu the Rustic tapped clappers to guide the drifting clouds. Then they sang for the Master:

*"Yuanyang Daoist, truly carefree,
Seeking the Dao, he cast off office like worn-out sandals.
Eight years widowed, dreaming of solitary roosting,
Night’s chill seeping through iron pillow and cold mandarin-duck quilt.
His face shows white in beard and brow,
Yet his years still hold a spark of life.
I urge you: find the Yellow Matchmaker soon,
Take a lovely wife.
Man and woman, fire and water—
Yang as yin, harmonizing spirit and qi.
The Heavenly Terrace Immortal’s tender groom,
Old Zhang Guolao’s fair bride.
Fair bride, tender groom,
In the bridal chamber, unaware of heaven or earth.
Nature and fate entwined, life shared to the eyebrows.
In utter merging, then you’ll see your true heart;
In fleeting vagueness, then you’ll grasp your true intent.
This love of the Dao is your first step on the immortal’s ladder.
Laughing, I pass it to you—
Sanfeng Daoist, dashed off in a flourish."*

As the song ended, the pavilion before them gleamed under a white moon, the sky beyond the tower stretched in deep blue. Seated in a circle upon the stone altar, they looked at one another and smiled.

Zhang Zi says: The *Book of Documents* states, "Poetry expresses the will." The commentary explains: "That which resides in the heart is the will; that which issues forth in speech is poetry." Thus we know the will is the numinous essence within the human heart, while poetry is but the overflow of that numinous essence. The immortals’ seven reversions and nine refinements cultivate this empty, wondrous nature to forge the eternal, deathless Valley Spirit—visible beyond the light and qi of sun and moon as form, yet hidden within them as formless. Where the spirit reaches, poetry arises; though songs and verses differ, each reveals its own distinct numinous nature.

I have often wandered with the immortals through open wilds, emerging and vanishing amid mist and rosy clouds. Whenever I encounter the transcendent verses of the Perfected, I commit them to heart and preserve them in writing, gathering them into works like *Leisurely Talks Among Water and Stone*.

(2)
Master Lü’s poetry lifts the brush to lofty heights, its voice ringing clear. His verses on roaming are too beautiful to count. Here I record a few to show how his numinous nature differs from others’.

*"A Visit to Yueyun Immortal Abbey on the Seventh Night"*:
First the feast on Mount Goushi ended,
Then I returned to wander this ancient temple.
A sparse wind stirs the leafy courtyard,
Fine rain graces the autumn of bean blossoms.
Distant peaks gather their clouds at last,
The long sky suddenly clears its mist.
Such coolness now—
A jade flute leans against the high tower.

*"Passing the Tower of Wuchang City"*:
Wuchang’s walls and gates stand as before,
The people of Chu dwell near the water’s edge.
Beyond the balustrade, the great river washes day and night;
Within the pavilion, a long sword leans against the clouded sky.
A poet sits and whistles beneath the moon of South Tower,
A fisherman sings home through the mist of West Ford.
The old man playing the flute is even more at ease—
His bright recitation echoes a thousand years.

*"Six Quatrains on Roaming Mount Lu with Han Qingfu"*:
Beyond the clouds, Lu Mountain’s nine folds rise green,
I open the window to face the peaks and read the *Yellow Court*.
Who knows the scene within?—
I toss the scroll and plunge into the emerald screen.

After rain, fresh bamboo’s green soaks the senses,
I hasten deep into the path to escape the red dust.
Han’s flute and Lü’s pipe play in harmony,
One melody, two incarnations of immortal sound.

Where is joy not joy?
On earth as free as in heaven.
A waterfall flows upward three hundred feet—
In an instant, pure qi fills the cliffside.

I sing as I please, write as I please,
Scraping away moss to reveal jade’s highs and lows.
Suddenly, the sound of a temple drum drifts through the mist—
Lush woods lead past Tiger Creek.

A single word flies with each written character,
A yellow crane at the sky’s edge carries me home.
Before the altar, only one guest remains—
My heart like idle clouds, I enter the emerald haze.

I call the sleeping dragon from the sea gate,
In an instant, rain pours from the edge of the sky.
A long sword flies once more into the vastness—
I watch as the southeast darkens with tree shadows.

All are clear and bright, lovely beyond compare.

Those whose nature and spirit most closely resemble Master Hui include none other than Han Qingfu, who has a poem titled *"Idle Humming"* that reads:
*"Quietly holding a stringless zither,
Gently blowing a holeless flute.
One strum and heaven and earth grow clear,
One breath and heaven and earth expand.
One breath, then one strum—
All are immortal melodies."*

His *"Matching Lü Dongbin"* goes:
*"Tigers at the gate and cranes in the hut,
Jade pipes winding like bamboo flutes in harmony.
I come not as a wanderer of clouded peaks,
But to inscribe the meandering flow of Xiang’s waters."*
His words are all bold and vast.

(4)

Lan Caihe styled himself Master of the Long Whistle. His quatrain *"Answering a Query on the Immortal’s Abode"* reads:
*"With a final tap of the song, I ascend,
The old master of Mount Yue’s long whistle.
When asked where I dwell these days—
In heaven’s jade capital, where immortals reside."*

(5)

Once, I saw the linked verses *"Treading Songs in Guanzhong"* by Han, Lan, Cao, and He:
*"The cosmos vast as a jade flask,
A lone man idly hums with clappers in hand.
Spring in Chang’an fades with wind and rain,
Petals carpet the earth as I stroll at ease."*
Truly, they capture the joy of carefree companionship, where one song lingers in three sighs.

(6)

Kunlun’s Magu styled herself the Jade City Immortal. Her poetry excels in rich resonance. Her *"Three Quatrains on Yueyun Altar"* read:
*"Riding phoenix and harnessing simurgh, she descends from the Jade City,
Laughing to see the moon’s clear light beyond the clouds.
Ten thousand miles of Kunlun’s celestial winds escort her,
Jade pendants and girdle ornaments sway with their chiming sound."*

*"Treading blue clouds, she crosses seas and mountains,
A jade flute in hand, her mind at ease.
From the clouds emerges a golden rosy cloak—
All along the way, clear chanting brings her here."*

*"At Yueyun Altar, she visits the Recluse,
Two or three disciples strike the Daoist chime.
Wind’s roar blends with the clouds’ soft murmur,
Bright lanterns on pavilions glow crimson through the night."*

She also has *"Three Hymns of Pacing the Void"*:
*"I, a Kunlun maiden and wandering immortal,
Have witnessed the sea transform into mulberry fields.
With the divine reach of the eight directions, I play at leisure,
My girdle ornaments chiming at the edge of the azure vault."*

*"Golden blossoms high in my coiled hair,
I bid farewell to the Western Pond and Mother’s home.
Gentle celestial winds stir my sleeves and sash,
As I pace the void, prostrating before the purple cloud chariot."*

*"Brewing the wine of long life is no difficulty,
For in my hand lies the magic elixir.
I am, after all, a daughter of heaven’s immortals—
Drunk, I lodge with Chang’e in the vast cold palace."*

The Azure City Immortal Maiden once studied under the transcendent Miaogu. One day, master and disciple paced the void and descended upon the brocade-like Jiang River. The transcendent inscribed these lines:

*"Behold the river’s tide—its force vast and wild,
Stirring the mountain clouds to pale and drift.
Across the stream, lanterns flicker in the dim,
A fresh verse flows straight from my brush’s tip.
My thoughts linger, I open the lattice to gaze—
How crisp and refreshing this pavilion stays."*

The Maiden responded in kind:
*"Waters stretch boundless, mountains loom untamed,
Before the pavilion, their grandeur unconfined.
After the rain, frogs’ drums resound in chorus bright,
Along the way, the tide’s roar as the moon ascends the height.
From the moon I come, by the clouds I peer—
The evening breeze carries a cool, refreshing cheer."*

The ethereal immortal Qingyi was renowned in the Tang as a master of poetry, his nature and spirit ever free and untethered, often descending to the mortal realm. His *"Descending at the Double Clarity Pavilion on the Purification Festival"* reads:

*"I read to surpass the ancients of old,
Sword in hand, I sought the lords’ favor bold.
Yet trifles displeased me, so I chose instead
To drown in wine and hide ‘midst the brewers’ shed.
The eras of Yellow Emperor and Yao are not far,
While Qin and Han rush past like a swift current’s scar."*

Swift pass the matters before my eyes,
All cares dissolved in boundless ease.
A wanderer who chants by mountains old,
I favor Xie’s tower, its heights untold.
A hundred thousand verses I compose,
Entrusting them to heaven and earth’s repose.
I hold my own true sovereign within—
Vast and free, to Yingzhou I return again.

Today we speak of the Purification rite,
Yet all dissolves like wine in cup’s light.
The Sea Immortals summon with inscribed bamboo,
And on the wind I traverse ten realms anew.
Eastward to the Three Divine Mountains I roam,
With host of immortals, through the void we roam.
A single draught—five thousand measures flow,
My belly swells with rivers of verse aglow.
To the Land of Nothing-Whatever I go,
By the sea’s edge, a long whistle I blow.

The *"Cave-Heaven Song"* declares:
"Seek the numinous elixir ‘midst sea and peak,
Yet the elixir seeks not sea nor mountain meek.
Heaven and earth move the bellows’ breath,
But the bellows are not heaven and earth’s sheath.
The golden cinnabar was ever mine to claim,
For immortals must be forged from heroes’ flame.
Last night I drank before the Queen Mother’s face,
As clouds proclaimed the ripened peaches’ grace.
Li Taibai’s long whistle, Anqi’s song resound—
What can the host of immortals do but astound?
I shall ride the horned dragon through the Six Directions’ span,
Where empty vastness leaves no trace of mortal man.
A great wind blows from the north’s domain,
Parting the layered clouds like frost and rain.
Oh, to have wine fall like the pouring rain,
Drunk from the sky without end or gain!
Oh, to have wine gush forth like a spring,
Lying on earth, gazing where the heavens swing!
Mad verses, clapping hands, shoulders squared high,
Who is this man?—Li Qinglian am I!"

Master Dongpo’s immortal genius stands peerless beside Taibai’s,
Riding the wind, whistling to the moon—his spirit ever abides.
His poem *"Jiangshang Sends Off Autumn"* reads:
*"Fleeting, the distant autumn clouds,
Vast, the autumn waters’ flow.
Beyond green hills and crimson trees,
Wild geese drift past passes and rivers low.
North of Jì, the cold grows sharp,
While south of the Yangtze, the air turns mild.
The little springtime of late autumn arrives—
Greeting and parting swiftly coincide!"*

His inscription for *"Portrait of Han Qingfu"* declares:
*"A palace attendant once bore incense,
Born of a vice-minister’s noble line.
His carefree heart forgot wealth and rank,
From childhood, he sought mist and clouds divine.
A bowl planted with seeds of long life,
A garden sown with flowers that never fade.
With the Eight Immortals, he shares eternal years,
Through ten thousand kalpas, cinnabar he’ll hold.
First, he knelt to the horse at Blue Pass,
Then hid the crimson fire-crow in his breast.
For a thousand autumns, uncle and nephew stand wise—
Confucian and Daoist paths, boundless, they’ve pressed."*

His *"Self-Portrait in Straw Hat and Clogs"* proclaims:
*"A mountain man’s old ways are wild and free,
Drunk, he sketches his hat and clogs with glee.
Fine verses now and then may serve as face,
His idle heart never parts from wine’s embrace.
At the tower’s top, he summons monks to moon-gaze,
Through valley mists, he seeks anglers’ ways.
Coming and going as he pleases, self-content,
A long whistle—he vanishes into the forest’s rent."*

His *"Passing East Peak"* observes:
*"Long absent from East Peak’s height,
Yet rivers and mountains remain the same sight.
Fallen plantains carpet the ground,
Snow’s intent invites Chan insight."*

His two *"Impromptu Verses at Lake Mouth"* sing:
*"Wisps of mist, rippling waves so slight,
Beyond the Water-Heart Pavilion, painted boats alight.
Jade flutes drift ten leagues—whose barge hears
The song of Red Maid as oars pause in flight?"*

*"Wind slants, rain fine, the kudzu robe light,
Two or three silver knives gleam bright from the water’s height.
I love the lotus’s fragrance, unbroken, sweet,
Where bamboo’s west runs deep—someone walks discreet."*

His *"Ode to the Rain that Sharpens Swords"* resounds:
*"Jingzhou’s rain falls thick as grease,
To temper heroes’ blades with ease.
Most haunting, the waters beneath Wuchang’s wall—
A thousand autumns, they roar like thunder’s thrall."*

His *"Ode to the White Radish"* quips:
*"Purer than snow, whiter than frost,
In the old garden’s winter, its fragrance is lost on none.
Yet I laugh at the mountain monks, so long austere—
Boiled with lard, they still cannot taste its sun!"*

His *"Self-Gift"* declares:
*"Through life, I’ve never worn a frown,
Today, Dongpo becomes a carefree immortal’s crown.
I leave my traces in rivers and hills,
My name forever hung in clouds’ gown."*

His six-line *"Visiting the Heart-Mountain Chamber of Pure Dao"* intones:
*"Qi keen, spirit clear—the Dao abides,
Mountains empty, men still, the zither’s notes glide.
A mat wreathed in tea smoke, curling slow,
Three parts of wine’s leisure—endless flow."*

His lyric *"A Few Words"* whispers:
*"Cool shade winds,
Winds through fallen flowers, the window’s edge finds.
Beyond, the isle’s faint tide sighs.
The bird’s cry fades—
A single bamboo slants just right where it sways.
Kingfishers’ emerald voices trill till dawn’s light,
Yet I’ve just woken from a single night’s delight."*

Such limpid, lush strokes—his genius undiminished,
None but a true immortal could have penned them.

Shao Yaofu was a Confucian immortal. Once, he manifested his transformation in the scholarly world, composing *"Chant on Observing the Yijing"*:

*"Fuxi, the great sage, drew the trigrams to transmit through ages.
The mechanism of yin-yang’s transformations—
Qian and Kun stand as the Yijing’s ancestors.
I dwell in my Peaceful Joy Nest,
Heaven and earth my companions.
Piercing the hearts of sages and worthies,
I find my place in tranquil contentment."*

Vast and boundless, had these lines been placed in the *"Striking the Earth"* collection, they would have stood no differently.

Bai Yuchan was a transcendent talent of the Daoist school. His inscriptions on steles in famous mountains and his poetic tributes are abundant. Whenever he encountered lofty recluses or carefree scholars, he would invariably present them with poems. His *"Inscribed at the Hall of Ease"* reads:

*"Wind sighs through the grove,
Bamboo thick before the window.
Rare to find a man of pure heart,
Together we speak on an autumn eve’s glow.
Wine in hand, drunk in the thatched hall,
Incense burning as we read the *Zhouyi*.
When Qiong Mountain’s immortal comes,
Host and guest’s joy knows no bounds."*

His *"Presented to the Recluse of Yuanyang Mountain"* goes:

*"Returning to the mountain, your traces hidden in discourse on long life,
Day by day, you wander with idle clouds at ease.
Everywhere, reflected light returns in illumination,
Morning after morning, facing scenes, you forget emotion.
Sweeping away the dust of labored dreams,
Inscribing heaven and earth to scatter the traveler’s name.
Do not say the seclusion’s alchemy is bitter—
Roaming the void, the mind clears itself to emptiness."*

(12)

Zhang Ziqiong was a native of Raozhou. In the early Yuan dynasty, he attained the Dao, and his poetry often displayed a refined and vigorous style. His six-line *"Self-Presentation"* reads:

*"The heart like a bell’s toll on a snowy night,
The bearing akin to plum blossoms in frosty skies.
Wandering idly where white clouds run deep—
Who knows the carefree ease of the immortal’s life!"*

His *"Ode to Embryonic Breathing"* goes:

*"Neither forced nor forgotten, the subtle art of breath,
Cultivation demands mastery of this skill.
Harmonizing the two agents to birth embryonic breathing,
Then within its midst, set the cauldron and furnace."*

(13)

Qiu Changchun’s *"Autumn Crossing at Yueyun Tower"* says:

*"The vast sky’s wind fills the tower to the brim,
Clouds from the peaks surge through groves and hills.
Where rain’s echoes mingle with eaves bells,
A single courtyard lies serene in autumn’s hush."*

His verse brims with an elegant and unrestrained spirit.

(14)

Zhang Ziyang’s *"Self-Congratulation on Longevity"* poem declares:

*"The sea’s tally spans ten thousand ages of fleeting time,
Eight hundred springs have passed since attaining the Dao.
Parting with a child who rides a crane away,
The void shatters to reveal the whole self."*

None but the highest immortals could compose such lines.

The Venerable Ancestor Xiyi possessed primordial qi in its undifferentiated state. His *Five-Absolute Verse in Reply to a Query on His Surname* reads:

*"A single qi sifts through past and present,
Yin and yang’s transformations wondrously unfold.
Ask my name or surname—
A sleeping lout, old Xiyi."*

My master, Fire Dragon, was not overly fond of composing poetry, for he held fame in low regard. Here I record one of his *Occasional Verses*:

*"My Daoist name by chance matches Zheng Huolong,
My true name hides within the Great Void.
Since delivering Sanfeng,
I’ve returned east of Penglai’s Weak Waters."*

(17)

The Immortal Feixia was my tenth-generation disciple, a woman who ascended through space after ingesting divine elixir. Once she descended upon Zixiao Abbey in Yunnan, leaving behind a quatrain signed simply "Feixia" before departing. It reads:

*"Long I dwelt in Jade Tower by Jasper Pool,
Then rode a colored crane down to the sacred hills.
Should mortals ask my surname—
I once cradled golden cinnabar, serving Lord Mu."*

Lu Qianxu of Huaidong, having attained the Dao under Patriarch Lü during the Jiajing era, left behind a vast corpus of writings, including:
*Two fascicles of* Laozi Yuanlan,
*One fascicle each of* Ce-Shu on the Yin Fu Jing *and* Ce-Shu on the Cantong Qi,
*One fascicle of* Jindan Jiuzheng Pian,
*One fascicle of* Ce-Shu on Ziyang’s Four Hundred Characters,
*Eight fascicles of* Fanghu Waishi,
*And eight fascicles of* Nanhua Fumo.

Recently, among my fellow disciples, there is one called Baibaizi, who annotated the *Daode Jing* under the title *Donglai Zhengyi*. Qianxu inscribed it with these lines:

*"One commentary unlocks the Dao’s profound depths,
As purple qi once more arrives from the east.
A true scholar who plucks the zither and pipes,
A master orator expounding sutras and scriptures.
I sit in Square Pot, gazing upon the azure sea,
While you ascend Round Peak, towering over Penglai."*

This morning we sit together in the riverside pavilion,
reciting the *Nanhua* and laughing at our own folly.

This is because Baibaizi has also composed works such as *Round Peak Outer History*, *Discourses on the Apertures of the Dao*, and *Miscellaneous Explications of the Woken-to-Reality and the Cantong Qi*.

**Part One**
Someone asked: The art of planchette divination is but a minor skill, yet its enthusiasts abound, and its proponents flourish—whence does this art originate? Is it entirely trustworthy or not?

Master Zhang replied: Long ago, Master Hui wished to elucidate this mystery with Han San and other disciples but ultimately left the explanation unfinished. Today, I shall clarify it.

The term *ji* (planchette) means *ji* (to examine), for examination verifies truth. The *Shuowen* states: "Divination is used to resolve doubts." Thus, its radical derives from *zhan* (to divine), while its phonetic component comes from *yao* (隐), the ancient form of *yin* (hidden). The *Erya*’s "Explicating Words" says: "*Yin* means *zhan* (to divine)." The commentary explains: "*Yin* means to assess." The subcommentary adds: "Diviners observe omens to discern fortune or misfortune, but they must first assess and deliberate." I say: If divination’s words require further assessment, they differ not from undivined matters—so why divine at all? Yet there is a hidden meaning within.

Heavenly immortals and earthly transcendents dislike speaking of misfortune or blessing; they only urge people to cultivate themselves and await their fate. Thus, their admonitions and teachings are never hidden, nor are their discourses on the elixir path. Even when prescribing remedies to save others, they conceal nothing. But for all other inquiries—such as questions of fortune or failure—they invariably hide their meaning. This concealment is merely a pretext to avoid answering. For if they clearly foretold misfortune, those destined for blessing might grow reckless in joy, turning fortune into calamity; or those fated for misfortune might become paralyzed by fear, inviting disaster in their dread. How can fortune be summoned? Only by doing good may one attract auspiciousness.

Their hidden language is meant to be self-evident without explanation, yet the purpose of concealment extends further. After achieving the Dao, immortals leave no shadow when walking in sunlight, make no sound when passing through metal or stone—ordinary people cannot perceive them. Thus, in planchette divination, they inscribe dragon-like, serpentine scripts in myriad forms to demonstrate their indestructibility.

Yet planchette divination is a borrowed art. Since ancient times, true adepts have dismissed it as the practice of mere magicians. Why, then, do immortals now descend to wield the stylus? Because in recent times, this art has become fashionable, and nobles and commoners alike often believe in and favor it. Immortals, whose urgent task is to enlighten and awaken the world, thus employ the planchette to subtly guide all people—turning the false into the real.

However, those who practice planchette divination fall into two categories: one excels, the other fails. The superior excel through virtue, sincerity, and karmic affinity. Even if they lack skill in planchette divination, immortals still wish to guide them—how much more so if they understand the art? They are led by their own momentum, and without talismans or invocations, high transcendents naturally descend to their chambers.

The inferior fail through malice, deceit, and greed. Even if they excel in planchette divination, immortals will not approach them—how much less if they act with irreverence? The planchette is manipulated to deceive them, and reckless use of talismans and incantations instead invites ghosts into their chambers.

Since we have leapt beyond the Five Phases, neither heaven nor earth can constrain us, nor can yin and yang mold us. Even if we wished to summon immortals, we would do so with reverence—what need have we for talismans and incantations? Ah! This is why magicians deceive the foolish and why immortals despise magicians.

Today, I speak of the planchette through the planchette itself—let this serve as its instruction.

**Part Two**
Someone asked further: If the proper way to invoke the planchette is through virtue, sincerity, and karmic affinity—not through talismans and incantations—why then does the Southern Palace Daoist tradition employ talismans and incantations to command spirits?

It is said: Though the Southern Palace school uses talismans and incantations, these are transmitted by high transcendents for relieving distress and eliminating harm. Such secret manuals are not found in the world of mortals. Even if one obtains them, they must be used with a heart devoted to benefiting others to achieve profound merit. If employed for selfish ends, the Heavenly Emperor will strike them down with thunderbolts, ending their life and revoking their arts.

Thus, even the Southern Palace’s talismans and incantations require reverence and sincerity to be effective. How can the vulgar planchette’s talismans and incantations be mentioned in the same breath—especially when coupled with irreverence and insincerity? From this, you may enlighten yourselves.

**Part Three**

Master Zhang says: Heaven originally has no mind to reward good or punish evil—thus, whether blessings descend or calamities fall, it is man who summons them. If Heaven had a mind to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, then blessings and calamities would descend in accord with man’s own awareness. One who consistently practices goodness will receive fortune—this is an inevitable principle; even if misfortune befalls, it will be but momentary. One who consistently does evil will incur disaster—this is an inevitable consequence; even if fortune comes, it too will be fleeting. Why abandon self-reflection and seek answers elsewhere?

Yet I observe the benighted masses: when they pray to gods, they seek divination slips and cast lots; when they entreat immortals, they invoke planchette and spirit-writing, as if gods and immortals must know their fortune. Later, if the outcome matches their hopes, they believe; if not, they doubt. Yet their doubt and belief alike remain the old folly of fools. Gods and immortals indeed know fortune and misfortune—yet why must they reiterate what the human heart already knows?

Those whose prayers to gods or immortals prove accurate do so for a reason: the good inquire about blessings, and blessings arrive; the wicked fear calamity, and calamity befalls—it is as if some alignment occurs. Yet this is not the efficacy of divination slips, lots, planchette, or spirit-writing. Those whose prayers prove inaccurate do so for a reason as well: the good inquire about misfortune, yet no misfortune can befall them; the wicked seek fortune, yet no fortune can be granted—it is as if some opposition occurs. Yet this is not the failure of divination slips, lots, planchette, or spirit-writing. All divination in the world follows this pattern—why can one not discern this for oneself?

Throughout my life, I have disliked people seeking divination slips, casting lots, invoking planchette, or summoning spirit-writing. I only wish that each person cultivate virtue and constantly engage in self-examination.

---

Master Zhang says: Immortals possess the wish to deliver others, and thus some borrow spirit-writing to expound the Dao and discourse on the origin of things. Immortals possess a heart that cherishes others, and thus some borrow spirit-writing to exhort goodness and admonish evil. Immortals possess the intent to save others, and thus some borrow spirit-writing to prescribe remedies and administer healing. Yet if one speaks of determining fortune and misfortune, that lies in the goodness or evil of human conduct—this I have already made clear in the previous chapter and will not repeat here.

What is truly strange are those in the world who set up spirit-writing to seek geomantic insights or invoke it to discern the will of Heaven. These are all remnants of the fangshi’s old ways. The upright gods of the upper realms perceive their deceit, and none can escape Heaven’s punishment.
