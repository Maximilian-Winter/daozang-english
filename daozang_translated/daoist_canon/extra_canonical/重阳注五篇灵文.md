# 重阳注五篇灵文

**The Holy Annotation of Master Zhongyang on the *Five Chapters of Sacred Texts***

**Preface**
This text is the supreme treasure of *Jindan* [alchemical elixir]. It cannot be passed on to just anyone. If one of the highest caliber—great virtue’s heir—encounters this book, it is the true path to immortality.

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
Immortals are divided into five ranks. *Gui xian* [ghostly immortals] are unworthy of pursuit; *ren xian* [human immortals] need not be discussed. *Di xian* [earthly immortals] dwell in the world for many years. *Shen xian* [spiritual immortals] emerge and vanish beyond measure, hidden yet manifest, possessing a body beyond the body. Those who can dual their essence—these are called *shen xian* [spiritual immortals].

*Tian xian* [celestial immortals] stand above *shen xian* [spiritual immortals]. Seekers of the Dao/Way should not be content with mediocre or lower ranks. They must study the supreme and ultimate truth of the highest vehicle, the wondrous Dao/Way beyond compare.

To penetrate the mysteries of Heaven and Earth’s yin-yang, to grasp the transformations of the Five Phases [wood, fire, earth, metal, water]. The words *yin* and *yang* hold the greatest principle—Heaven, Earth, sun, moon, and the Five Phases all arise from them.

When the *Tai ji* [Supreme Ultimate] was divided, the pure *qi* ascended to form celestial phenomena; the turbid *qi* descended to shape terrestrial forms. The essence of wood and fire became the *Tai yang* [Greater Yang, the sun]; the splendor of metal and water became the *Tai yin* [Greater Yin, the moon]. Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon are born from the interplay of these two *qi*, transforming into existence.

These two *qi* circulate endlessly between Heaven and Earth, generating all things. Yet, as for human life—it draws upon the father’s vital essence and the mother’s blood, Heaven’s *yang qi*, Earth’s *yin qi*, the sun’s *yang hun* [soul], the moon’s *yin po* [spirit], fire’s *yang shen* [spirit], and water’s *yin jing* [essence]. Within a single human body, the transformations mirror those of Heaven and Earth, sharing the same *qi*.

Heaven and Earth are humanity’s grand progenitors. Those who awaken transcend the yin-yang of Heaven and Earth; those who remain deluded sink into the suffering of the myriad phenomena. To be unbound by the Five Phases’ constraints and yin-yang’s shackles—this is the highest rank of *tian xian* [celestial immortals]. Those who fail to awaken descend with the Creator, alas!

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
*Tian xin* [Heavenly Mind] is the true, wondrous heart of *Miao yuan* [profound unity]. The *Shi jie* [Buddhist teachings] call it the *Miao ming zhen xin* [wondrously clear true mind]. The mind is inherently wondrous and clear, untouched by defilement, pure and unadulterated. The slightest attachment is called delusion.

This mind is the root of the *Tai ji* [Supreme Ultimate], the formless void, the origin of yin-yang, the heart of Heaven and Earth—thus it is called *Tian xin* [Heavenly Mind]. The *Yuan shen* [Primordial Spirit] is the unborn, unending, incorruptible true essence, not the errant heart of thought and fancy. *Tian xin* [Heavenly Mind] governs the *Yuan shen* [Primordial Spirit], while the *Yuan shen* [Primordial Spirit] manifests the wondrous workings of *Tian xin* [Heavenly Mind].

Thus, the *Ru ru* [thusness, immovable] *Miao yuan Tian xin* [wondrously unified Heavenly Mind] is the master, while the *Bu huai bu mie* [unperishable, unobscured] *Ling miao Yuan shen* [wondrously subtle Primordial Spirit] is its function.

The Three Treasures [Buddha, Dao, Patriarch] serve as its foundation: the outer Three Treasures are not lost, and the inner Three Treasures are naturally harmonized.

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
The inner Three Treasures are *jing* [essence], *qi* [energy], and *shen* [spirit]; the outer Three Treasures are the ears, eyes, and mouth. One must seal them shut—do not let them leak.

If the eyes gaze upon colors, the spirit leaks through the eyes;
if the ears listen to sounds, the essence leaks through the ears;
if the mouth speaks, the *qi* leaks through the mouth.
When sight, hearing, and speech are stirred by external forces, the essence, energy, and spirit are daily consumed within. Gradually, one weakens and ages; when exhausted, death follows.

The Three Treasures are preserved when:
the eyes do not wander in vain,
the ears do not listen in vain,
the mouth does not speak in vain—
this is called the outer Three Treasures not leaking.
The eyes do not see, and the spirit remains in the heart;
the ears do not hear, and the essence remains in the kidneys;
the mouth does not speak, and the *qi* remains in the *Dan tian* [elixir field]—
this is called the inner Three Treasures naturally contained.

At first, one attains harmony between Heaven and humanity. The *qi* of the primordial Dao/Way naturally returns to its source.

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
*Tian* [Heaven] refers to the *qi* of the primordial Dao/Way;
*Ren* [humanity] refers to the form of the post-heavenly body.
Those who cultivate immortality must, in all their actions—whether moving, resting, sitting, or lying—nurture the *Ru ru bu dong Tian xin* [immovable Heavenly Mind] and the *Ling miao bu mie Yuan shen* [unobscured Primordial Spirit]. Thus, the eyes will not wander in vain, the ears will not listen in vain, and the mouth will not speak in vain. The inner truth responds externally, and the primordial *qi* naturally harmonizes, returning to my body from the void.

Yet, within a human’s inner and outer self, the Four Great [elements] above and below are all post-heavenly yin-yang. Only the primordial point of supreme *yang qi* remains, hidden in the unfathomable depths, utterly subtle and wondrous, difficult to seek or perceive.

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
Within a human body, there are the four limbs and myriad bones externally, and the five viscera and six bowels internally. Even tears, saliva, *jin jing* [semen and vaginal fluids], *qi*, blood, and fluids—all are tangible forms, belonging to post-heavenly turbid yin. This single point of supreme *yang qi* is the primordial *Zhen yi* [true unity] *qi* of the Dao/Way, called the *Tai yi* [Great Unity] *Han zhen qi* [containing true *qi*].

The "dim and indistinct" refers to the source of the primordial Dao/Way’s emergence. To reveal this supreme *yang qi* of the Dao/Way, there is no other method—only the practice of stillness.

The Dao/Way of stillness lies in dispelling delusive thoughts. Observing that the body is entirely empty, motionless and tranquil, suddenly the true *yang* appears in the dim and indistinct—sometimes present, sometimes absent, unfathomable, beyond sight or measure, neither inner nor outer, arising without knowing how. Thus it is.

Master Zhongyang’s Holy Annotation says:
All things carry yin within and embrace *yang*. Though a human’s Four Great [elements] belong to turbid yin, within lies a point of primordial *Yuan yang* [original *yang*], inherently endowed with innate knowledge and ability, inherently wondrous and clear.

Yet, the seven emotions and six desires assault from within, while cold, labor, heat, and toil strike from without, scattering the primordial *yang* and leaving one unaware, descending with the transformations of fate!

To know and cultivate—retracting sight and listening, forgetting external things while embracing the true—sight and hearing do not leak through sounds and colors; the wondrous and subtle do not leak through thoughts and fancies. The true essence is naturally preserved, and the primordial spirit is naturally replenished. The inner truth responds externally, and the primordial *qi* emerges from the void, illuminating the *Jindan* [alchemical elixir] within the body. Thus, though it comes from without, it is truly born within.

The mother-*qi* conceals the child-*qi*, the spirit embraces the *qi*, and the *qi* embraces the spirit. At this juncture, the *dantian* grows warm, the three passes ascend and descend in harmony, the upper and lower merge in balance—*tíhuò* [clarified butter] pours upon the crown, sweet dew showers the heart, the celestial *jiǔtiān* [wondrous music] resounds ever in the ears, the supreme treasure of the *xuánzhū* [mysterious pearl] is ever seen in the eyes. This is the true manifestation—no mere metaphor.

*"True essence returned to the Yellow Room of Gold,*
*A single bright pearl forever undivided."*

Is this idle speech? If the primordial had no dependence on the subsequent, how could it be summoned and gathered? If the subsequent fails to grasp the primordial, how could it transform and adapt? This is the emergence of being from non-being, and non-being from being. Non-being stirs into form through the impetus of being; being awakens to subtlety through the resonance of non-being. The *qi* of the two heavens—primordial and subsequent—responds like echoes to sound.

The Venerable Lord of Double Yang’s sacred annotation states:
*The primordial enters the formless void;
The subsequent lingers in tangible form.
The primordial is the heart—true, pure, wondrous, and clear;
The subsequent is the body—complete and solemn in its fullness.*

The primordial’s wondrous, clear, and true nature is inherently pure and untainted. From beginningless time, a single thought has hung like a pearl, until today. If it fails to summon the subsequent’s complete form, then the yin-spirit remains solitary and refined. The subsequent’s complete form, if it lacks the primordial’s wondrous and subtle essence, cannot transform or awaken to subtlety—how then could it transcend the mundane and attain sainthood?

For life and nature are the root of spirit and *qi*. *Qi* is the water of Heaven’s One; spirit is the True One containing essence. Nature is the form within non-being; life is the void within being. Life without nature lacks vitality; nature without life cannot stand. Non-being is the primordial nature, the spirit of True Unity; being is the subsequent life, the *qi* of True Unity’s essence.

This tangible yin-substance, born from a single point of formless yang-*qi*, harbors within its tangible form the formless true essence. Only through refining and purifying can the mysterious pearl manifest. Once the pearl appears, it returns to the furnace—being and non-being merge, the two *qi* harmonize, like shadow following form, like echoes to sound. Naturally, the heart congeals while the form dissolves; bones and flesh melt away, form and spirit both attain marvelous transformation, merging with the Dao in truth.

The Venerable Lord of Double Yang’s sacred annotation states:
*The elixir lies within; the medicine comes from without—*
*Yet it is truly born from within.*

Why? For the spirit arises from form. Since this substance exists, a point of the primordial is present in every person, inherently possessed by all.

The worldly folk are lost in the true, following their passions instead.
Once their emotions and circumstances grow intimate,
They drift in the river of love, lost in the depths of desire.

Yet those who truly observe and awaken,
Having met a genuine teacher,
Are shown the primordial **Dao/Way** of the single **qi**—
The medicine comes from without, depending upon form to arise.

The method of acquisition is simply this:
To forget emotions, forget form,
To abandon will and embrace emptiness,
With not a thought arising,
In stillness reaching utter quietude,
When suddenly the celestial light itself emanates—
Neither within nor without,
As if something exists,
Now revealed, now concealed,
Thus the **mysterious pearl** takes form.

How does the **mysterious pearl** come to take form?
It is because, in stillness and quietude,
The spirit clings to the **qi**,
The **qi** condenses and the essence solidifies,
Coalescing into a single grain of **elixir**—
Forever residing within the **elixir field**,
Its outer manifestation the **mysterious pearl**’s luminous form,
Like a lamp’s light within a chamber,
Illuminating the brilliance beyond the window.

*"The Celestial Root wanders through the Moon’s Cavern,*
*Thirty-six palaces bloom with eternal spring.*
*Wait for that single point to return on its own,*
*Within the body, transforming into four seasons’ spring."*

Nurturing the **elixir furnace**,
Light pierces the curtains—
This is called the **mysterious pearl**,
The external medicine,
The primordial true essence.

True **yang**-**qi** is the fire of **Dao/Way**,
Lead meeting **geng** gives birth—
At this time, it is fitting to dwell in stillness,
Only then can one acquire and return it.

When one perceives the **elixir field**’s fire blazing,
Both kidneys’ **qi** warm,
The Three Passes ascending and descending,
A single **qi** harmonizing and surging—
Like **tíróu** (clarified butter) pouring upon the crown,
Sweet dew nourishing the heart,
Inner visions boundless,
Words fail to describe them fully.

The primordial **yang**-**qi** gives birth,
At the moment of **One Yang Stirring**,
It further generates heaven and earth,
Distinguishing **Kàn** and **Kūn**—
The time of **Returning Yang** and **Changing Bones**.

From the union of parents’ essence,
The embryonic form gradually matures over ten months,
**Qi** full and form complete, giving rise to the body—
That single point of luminous essence, primordial **yang**-**qi**,
Is already contained within.

Once this body exists,
Then **yin** is bound to **yang**,
Within the Five Phases,
Death and life, nobility and lowliness,
None can escape it.

Having obtained the primordial true **yang**-**qi**,
Returned to the body as the **elixir furnace**,
Engaging with the posterior true **yin**-**qi**,
The two **qi** intermingle,
Forming the **embryonic body** of the immortal.

Refining the Five Phases in reverse,
Counteracting the workings of **Creation**—
At the juncture of **thirty-six thousand breaths**,
Not deviating by a hair’s breadth,
Only then is the **fire candidate** achieved,
Not diminished by a thread.

Requiring ten months’ labor to complete,
The **embryonic body** sheds and ascends—
The Five Phases cannot constrain,
**Yin** and **yang** cannot mold.

The whole body’s turbid **yin**,
Completely transformed into pure **yang**,
Breaking free from the cage,
Scattering boundlessly in carefree ease!

**Editor’s Note:**
This section first speaks of the origin of **external delight**,
Then the method of acquisition,
Next the **Small Heavenly Cycle**’s practice,
And its boundless inner visions.

Again, the **Great Heavenly Cycle**’s practice of ten months,
The **spirit’s** transcendent visions—
Three years of **nursing the elixir**,
Nine years of **facing the wall**,
Breaking free from the cage,
Becoming the **carefree Heavenly Immortal**—
Yet its beginning is with the primordial true **yang**-**qi**,
As the **elixir**’s mother.

**Iddhi** (超凡功力) arises from refining oneself to mastery,
Only then can one achieve the primordial **Creation**.

The **mysterious pearl** takes form,
**Great Unity** (太乙) contains the true essence—
Form and spirit both attain marvelous transformation,
Merging with the **Dao/Way** in truth.

All this unfolds naturally,
Without contrivance or effort.

The Venerable Lord of **Double Yang**’s sacred annotation states:
*"Within the twenty-six hours,*
*Reverse and cultivate—*
*Do not follow the familiar path of emotions,*
*Hold fast to the **Dao/Way**’s thought,*
*The eyes do not wander after colors or scenes,*
*The ears do not chase after sounds or circumstances,*
*The nose does not linger upon fragrances or filth—*"

The tongue does not wander after flavors or sensory realms;
The body does not succumb to tactile desires or sensory realms.
The mind does not follow emotional or familiar realms.

Awareness remains ever luminous,
Luminous yet ever serene.
Thus, by not yielding to human emotions and familiar realms,
Over time, the natural **Dao/Way**’s essence becomes pure and true—
Refining oneself is refining the mind.

The mind is **li** (離), **li** being the realm of one’s own **earth** (土).
When the mind is refined and unmoved,
This is called **leaving the palace** (離宮) and practicing **meditation** (修定).
**Meditation** brings **qi** into harmony,
Harmony brings bodily ease,
Ease fills the body with **jing-qi** (精氣),
Fullness causes **lead** (鉛) and **mercury** (汞) to congeal,
Congealment brings forth **Creation** (造化) naturally,
The **mysterious pearl** (玄珠) takes form,
**Great Unity** (太乙) contains the true essence—
**Gold liquid refines the form** (金液鍊形),
Bones transmute into **cold jade** (寒琼),
Form and spirit both achieve marvelous transformation,
Merging with the **Dao/Way** in truth—
All this unfolds naturally.

If one does not diligently uphold and guard,
Subduing the mind and refining the nature,
There will be no natural attainment of **Dao/Way**.

Yet this practice requires a resolute and fearless heart,
A will to abandon life and forget death,
Only then can one achieve mastery.

When the heart is slain, the spirit becomes alive—
This is what is meant.

**Chapter One: The Jade Liquid Chapter**
The spirit does not depart from **qi**,
**Qi** does not depart from the spirit.
Breathing in and out, returning to a single source,
It cannot be grasped by the body,
It cannot be manipulated by effort.
Surrender the will to emptiness,
Serene yet ever luminous,
Body and mind in non-action,
While the spirit and **qi** naturally act.

Like the heavens and earth in non-action,
Yet all things naturally transform and nurture.
The Venerable Lord of **Double Yang**’s sacred annotation states:
*"Primordial **yang**-**qi** (先天一氣) emerges from emptiness,
Two **qi**s intermingle, naturally the spirit embraces **qi**,
**Qi** embraces the spirit—
The **qi** of the **First Heaven** (先天) and **Second Heaven** (後天) intermingle and support each other,
Naturally as indistinct as drunken dreams,
Uncontrived and effortless, without a trace of manipulation.
Inhale, and it is **qi**;
Exhale, and it is the spirit—
Spirit exhales, **qi** inhales,
Ascending and descending without cease,
Returning to its original source,
Refining and congealing into the **elixir**,
Forming its embryo.
Body and mind in great **meditation** (大定) and non-action,
While the spirit and **qi** naturally act—
Surrender the will to emptiness,
Do not dwell on thoughts,
Like the heavens and earth’s **meditation** (定) and stillness,
Naturally the **yang**-**qi** ascends and **yin**-**qi** descends,
Called the **receding moon and advancing moon** (往月來),
And thus **Creation** (造化) nurtures all things.
The Venerable Lord of **Double Yang**’s sacred annotation states:
When refining oneself reaches mastery,
The practice of stillness endures long,
Naturally the spirit and **qi** unite.
The spirit belongs to the **south** (南方), the **fire** (火) of **li** (離);
**Precise essence** (精) belongs to the **north** (北方), **water** (水) of **kǎn** (坎).
The **hun** (魂) belongs to the **east** (東方), **wood** (木) of **zhèn** (震);
The **pò** (魄) belongs to the **west** (西方), **metal** (金) of **duì** (兌).
The mind belongs to the **center** (中央), **earth** (土) of **kūn** (坤).
This is called the **Central Palace of Yellow Court** (中宮黃庭),
The **Primordial Pass** (先天玄關) is **gān** (干).
When the spirit and **qi** unite,
The spirit enters **qi**,
Naturally the Five Elements and Four Symbols converge—
This is the function of **kǎn-lǐ** (坎離) intermingling.
**Pure yin** (純陰) is refined by **fire** (火),
Meaning the spirit descends and illuminates the **kūn** (坤) Palace,
Obscure and mysterious,
Yet the true **qi** emerges naturally—
This is called **One Yang Reborn** (一陽生而為複).
**Chapter Two: The Birth of the Medicine Chapter**
The spirit guards the **kūn** (坤) Palace,
True **fire** (真火) comes naturally.
The **kūn** (坤) Palace is the birthplace of the medicinal elixir,
The source of the **yin-yang** (陰陽) intermingling.
The Venerable Lord of **Double Yang**’s sacred annotation states:
*"The **kūn** (坤) Palace is the **Yellow Court** (黃庭) within the human body.
It is below the heart, above the kidneys,
West of the liver, east of the lungs—
Before the kidneys, behind the navel wheel,
The hollow center where true **qi** (真氣) arises.
From the parental womb, the essence of one’s body,
Its connection like a ring,
Its whiteness like silk,
First forming the **Three Elements** (三元),
Then the **Two Kidneys** (兩腎),
The kidneys formed, gradually the **Two Eyes** (兩目),
Then the **Two External Kidneys** (兩外腎).
The **Three Talents** (三才) complete,
The **Five Zang** (五臟) and **Six Fu** (六腑),
The **Four Limbs** (四肢) and **Hundred Bones** (百骸),
Gradually take form.
This hollow center is the **Palace of Ancestral Qi** (祖氣之宮),
Thus called the **kūn** (坤) Palace—
**kūn** (坤) means to bear and nurture all things,
Truly the birthplace of the medicinal elixir,
The realm of **yin-yang** (陰陽) intermingling.
The spirit guards the **kūn** (坤) Palace,
Day and night without pause,
The **original spirit** (元神) descends and illuminates,
Returning light to stillness and **meditation** (定),
Reversing **Creation** (造化),
Opening the **Heavenly Gate** (天關),
From which the great medicine arises,
And the **elixir** (金丹) congeals.
If true **fire** (真火) does not refine,
Then **lead** (金) and **water** (水) remain mixed;
If the mind is not wholly focused,
Then **yang**-**fire** (陽火) scatters aimlessly,
And the great medicine will never arise—
How then can the primordial **Dao/Way** be attained?
With prolonged refining,
**Water** (水) sees **fire** (火) and naturally transforms into **One Qi** (一氣),
Ascending and perfuming,
The **River Vehicle** (河車) transports it,
Circulating endlessly—
True **jing** (精) arises from this,
And **original qi** (元氣) takes its embryonic form.
Breathing in and out unites,
Pulse ceases, **qi** halts,
Stillness generates **meditation** (定),
Within great **meditation**,
Primordial **One Qi** (先天一氣) emerges from emptiness,
Thus the **mother qi** (母氣) of the primordial.
While the **post-heavenal child qi** (後天子氣) lies dormant,
Follow its natural course,
Do not seek haste—
The primordial **Dao/Way** will naturally manifest.
The Venerable Lord of **Double Yang**’s sacred annotation states:
*"The **fire** (火) of the **kūn** (坤) Palace is the **fire** of the **True Person** (真人).
Always illuminate the **kūn** (坤) Palace with the spirit,
Refining **yin-yang** (陰陽),
**Jing** (精) transforms into **qi** (氣).
Focus the mind with unwavering resolve,
In all activities—walking, standing, sitting, lying—
Guard it intentionally, never allowing it to scatter.
If no progress is seen after long practice,
It is due to the mind’s chaos.
If refining endures long,
**Jing** (精) is refined by **fire** (火),
Naturally transforming into **One Qi** (一氣),
Day by day, **Three Reflections** (三震),
Resonance ascends to the **mud pellet** (泥丸),
Transforming into **sweet dew** (甘露),
Descending to the **Double Tower** (重楼),
Congealing into **jing-liquid** (精液),
Returning to the **kūn** (坤) position,
Nurturing the **original qi** (元氣),
Gradually growing robust—
Spirit exhales, **qi** inhales,
Naturally embracing and nurturing,
Circulating endlessly—
When **qi** and pulse cease,
Stillness and **meditation** (定) arise.
Within great **meditation**,
Sudden movement occurs—
This is the emergence of primordial **One Qi** (先天一氣),
From the **gān** (干) Palace,
Like a mother’s love for her child,
Naturally sensing and uniting—
The spirit’s transformation is unfathomable,
Listen to its natural course,
Do not seek haste—
When the time comes, **qi**-transformation will naturally show its effects."*

「The **Celestial Light** is the **Spirit Light**. With prolonged stillness, the Spirit Light shines forth, and stillness brings forth the Spirit’s clarity—penetrating within and without, manifesting outwardly. Colors and forms cannot obstruct it; desires and passions cannot hinder it. Thus, one naturally perceives objects through walls and foreknows past lives.

At the beginning of **Chaos** (混沌), before Heaven and Earth were distinguished, **primordial darkness** (玄) and **primordial brightness** (黄) intermingled. When the time of **Qi-transformation** (氣化) arrives, movement arises within **Great Meditation** (大定). Only at this point of movement does one recognize the **Creative Process** (造化). If there is a single entity—whether manifest or hidden, neither fully within nor fully without—this is the **Great Elixir** (大药) beginning to form; it must not be hastily gathered.

If even a single thought arises, the **True Essence of Heaven** (天真) will be lost!

The **Venerable Annotation of the Emperor of Double Yang** (重陽帝君聖注) states:
*"Heaven’s light and clear **Qi** reside above, its hue **primordial darkness** (玄); Earth’s heavy and turbid **Qi** resides below, its hue **primordial brightness** (黄). Before Heaven and Earth were distinguished, they were a unified **Qi**, with **primordial darkness** and **brightness** undivided, and **clear** and **turbid** yet undefined, merging into **Chaos** (混沌). When **Qi-transformation** arrives, the **clear Qi** ascends to become Heaven, and the **turbid Qi** descends to congeal as Earth. Earth’s **Qi** rises, Heaven’s **Qi** descends—the two **Qi**s intermingle and transform, giving birth to all things. So too is the function of **purity and stillness** (清净).

The **True Essence of Primordial Yang** (先天真陽) and the **True Essence of Posterior Yin** (後天真陰) merge as one, just as **primordial darkness** and **brightness** intermingle in Heaven and Earth. Suddenly, within **Great Meditation**, movement arises, and the **Creative Process** manifests—like the distinction of Heaven and Earth, where **Kūn** (坤) and **Gān** (干) are established.

If there is a single entity—whether manifest or hidden—this is the **Primordial Pearl** (玄珠) taking form. Though it seems to be outside, closing the eyes reveals it clearly; though it seems to be inside, opening the eyes shows only purity. When it has form, others cannot see it; when it has no form, only you perceive it clearly. Hence, it is called the **Formless Primordial Pearl** (無象玄珠).

This is the **Great Harmony Elixir** (大樂) beginning to sprout. Its **Elixir** is still tender; thus, it must not be gathered. If one rashly seizes it with delusion, one will lose the **Primordial Pearl** and squander the **True Essence of Heaven**’s most precious treasure, falling into **demonic frenzy** (魔狂), with **Qi** and breath in disarray—an irredeemable state. **Life’s Essence** (命寶) must not be trifled with; this is its meaning!

**Chapter Three: Gathering the Elixir**
Guard the Spirit in the **Gān Palace** (干宮), and the **True Qi** will naturally return. The **Gān Palace** is the source of the **Creative Process**, the origin of the birth of the physical form. To know this and refine it is to be a **Sage**.

The **Venerable Annotation of the Emperor of Double Yang** states:
*"The **Kūn Palace** (坤宮) belongs to Earth as **Yin**, corresponding to the human **posterior Qi** (後天) with its finite form; the **Gān Palace** belongs to Heaven as **Yang**, corresponding to the human **primordial Qi** (先天) without beginning or end. The **Gān Palace** is the **void and formless** (虛無) **primordial gateway** (玄關), a single aperture—truly the source of the **Creative Process**.

From the **void** to the **form**, this is called **Creative Process** (造); from the **form** to the **void**, this is called **transformation** (化)—a cycle of **Creative Process** and **transformation**. Initially, one receives **Qi** from the **void and formless** aperture and is born; finally, one dissipates the **essence** into the **six thieves** (幻妄六賊) and dies. The **Creative Process** revolves endlessly—countless **eons** (劫) pass!

First, the Spirit congeals in the **Kūn Palace**, refining **Yin Essence** (陰精) into **Yang Qi** (陽氣), which ascends and permeates, carried by the **River Vehicle** (河車) in ceaseless circulation. Next, the Spirit congeals in the **Gān Palace**, gradually refining and congealing, gradually gathering and forming—a **Primordial Pearl** (玄珠) emerges, as large as a millet grain, ever-present before you. Once obtained, it is forever yours. The **True Qi of Primordial Void** (先天虛無真氣) naturally returns to it.

Wait until its **lead-light** (鉛光) shimmers like the moon’s image; wait until its **mercury-Qi** (汞氣) soars like the sun’s radiance. When the sun and moon converge in one place, a single luminous point—round and radiant, shining brightly above and below—emerges, with **internal truth** (內真) and **external response** (外應). The **Qi of Primordial Void** arises from the **void** itself, thus it is the **mother-Qi** (母氣), while the **child-Qi** (子氣) lies dormant within. They naturally sense and unite.

The marvel of the **Creative Process** lies in the **Elixir** coming from without, not through artificial contemplation.

The **Venerable Annotation of the Emperor of Double Yang** states:
*"The adept of **True Essence** (修真之士) receives Heaven and Earth’s **Yin** and **Yang Qi** to be born. The **True Yang Qi** within the body is **lead** (鉛), **essence** (精), and **Kān** (坎); the **True Yin Qi** within the mind is **mercury** (汞), **Spirit** (神), and **Lí** (離).

The symbolism states: *The human body shares the same essence as Heaven and Earth’s **Qi**.

Once the **Great Elixir** begins to sprout and the **Primordial Pearl** takes form, the **True Qi** within the adept grows robust. At this juncture, the **Spirit within Essence** descends to unite with **Kān**; the **Spirit within Essence** ascends to unite with **Lí**. Internally, **Spirit** and **Essence** merge within; externally, **Yin** and **Yang** merge without. Inner and outer clarity shines forth—above and below—transforming into a **Bright Pearl** (明珠), round and radiant, ascending and descending through the **three pass gates** (三關), rotating endlessly like a wheel, in ceaseless circulation.

Such a vision is the moment when **internal Spirit** and **Essence** harmonize, when **metal** (金) and **wood** (木) intermingle, and **water** (水) and **fire** (火) are aroused within. This is the moment when **True Treasure** (真寶) resides within, thus its image responds externally. Without personally cultivating the **true realm** (真境), how could such a scene arise?

The **Qi of Primordial Void** is the **mother-Qi**; the **Qi of Posterior Essence** is the **child-Qi**. They naturally unite, returning to the marvel of the **Creative Process**, and thus the **Elixir** comes from without.

The **mother-Qi** is **Heaven’s Qi**; the **child-Qi** is **human Qi**. If one maintains **purity and stillness**, all of Heaven and Earth will return to them. **Heaven’s Qi** returns to a single body, becoming a **Natural Person** (自然人). Then, one takes **Heaven’s Qi** to govern the **Nine Heavenly Souls** (九天魂)—this is the meaning of **kindred harmony** (同類).

The **Primordial Kūn** and **Posterior Gān** (先坤後干) is also called **moving the furnace and changing the cauldron** (移爐換鼎). This is the **true essence** (真竅妙) of the **Golden Elixir** (金丹) and the **secret method** (秘訣) of **Primordial Fire’s Refining** (元天火候).

When first refining the **Elixir**, one seeks it in **water** (水), only to end in **stubborn emptiness** (顽空), ultimately achieving nothing. One must use one’s **True Qi** to resonate with the **most refined essence** of Heaven and Earth, applying the principle of **Yang Burner** (陽燧) to **water and fire** (水火) to sense and communicate. The **Venerable Annotation of the Emperor of Double Yang** states:

*"When first refining the **Elixir**, one must first have the Spirit illuminate the **Kūn Palace**, using **fire** to refine the **medicine** (药), and the Spirit to govern **Qi**. Once the **True Qi** arises, one then guards the **Gān Palace**, suspending the embryo within the **cauldron** (鼎), forming the **Primordial Pearl**, refining it into the **Great Elixir**, and swallowing it into the abdomen. It then transmutes one’s own **Yin Qi** into the **form of Gān Yang** (干陽之體)—this is the **true void’s** (真空) wondrous application."*

The people of this age do not comprehend the wondrous application of the **true void** (真空). Without encountering a **sage of ultimate attainment** (至人) for transmission, they rely on hearsay and blindly refine, seeking the Elixir in water—water being the realm of **obscure and murky** (杳冥). Forgetting both mind and body within this murk, how could they not fall into **stubborn emptiness** (顽空)? Ultimately, they will never achieve the **Elixir**.

The **Yang Burner** (陽燧) is the **Fire Pearl** (火珠), the **True Palace of the Great Yang** (太陽正宮). One directs the **Fire Pearl** toward the sun to ignite it; the **Water Pearl** (水珠) is the **True Palace of the Great Yin** (太陰正宮), directing the **Water Pearl** toward the moon. Though Heaven and Earth are suspended in vast separation, within a moment, one naturally attains **water and fire**. Even objects that receive **Qi** unevenly can resonate with the sun and moon—how much more so the human, the **root of all things** (萬物之靈根)?

Within **stillness and composure** (靜定), does one not resonate with the **marvelous transformations** within the body, forming the **Golden Elixir**?

**Chapter Four: Obtaining the Elixir—Divine Guard of the Mysterious Palace**
Guard the **Mysterious Palace** (玄宮) with the **Spirit**, welcome the **Feminine Chamber** (牝府) with the **Mind**—when **Spirit** and **Mind** unite, the **Primordial** (先天) is naturally attained. In **dim and obscure** (恍恍惚惚, 杳杳冥冥) states, a **point of red light** flashes into the **Lower Elixir Field** (下元). One’s **True Qi** gathers naturally, **Yin** embraces **Yang**, **Yang** stirs **Yin**, and the **most refined essence** emerges, waves surging in the **Sea of Vitality**. Rising from the **Great Mysterious Pass** (太玄關) into the **Mud Pillow** (泥丸), it transforms into **Golden Elixir**, swallowed into the abdomen—fragrant, sweet, and crisp. **Ten thousand pores** bloom with vitality, the body radiates light. At this point, **Heaven and Earth unite in copulation** (乾坤交媾), and the **mystery of eternal attainment** is revealed. All depends on **warding off peril and guarding against danger**, sealing tightly to prevent leakage, fostering **nourishment and warmth**.

The **Venerable Annotation of the Emperor of Double Yang** states:
*"The **Mysterious Palace** (玄宮) is the **Mysterious Pass** (玄關), where the refining of **glutinous rice** (黍米) occurs. It is also called the **Suspended Embryo Cauldron** (懸胎鼎), the **Cinnabar Cauldron** (朱砂鼎), and the **Gān-Kūn Cauldron** (干坤鼎)—these are but different names. Earlier, when speaking of **Gān-Kūn**, it referred to the **initial Elixir refining**, using **Gān-Kūn** as the **cauldron-vessel**. First, one condenses the **Spirit** and gathers it at the **Kūn position**. Within stillness arises movement—extracting **Yang** from within **Yin**, called **Freeing the Marrow** (免髓). When **True Qi** ascends, it rises into the **Gān Palace**; movement followed by stillness—merging **Yin** within **Yang**, called **Black Liver** (烏肝). These two substances blend and refine into the **Willful Pearl** (如意之珠). This is the **union of Kān-Lǐ** (坎離交媾), the emergence of the **Jǐ Flower** (癸花), the first appearance of **True Lead** (真鉛), the **Primordial** beginning to manifest, the moment when **One Yang first stirs**—like the **third day of the moon’s cycle**, when the moon emerges in the **Gēng sign** (庚之象), the very **active childbirth hour** (活子時).

Divide this hour into **six watches** (六候). The **first watch** is when the **Elixir is obtained**. Having obtained the **first watch’s Elixir**, one should enter a **quiet chamber**, using **natural fire** to refine further, entering the **Dui-Ding** (兑丁) phase. A **half-moon** appears—at this time, there are **Dragon’s roars and Tiger’s howls**. **Lead and Mercury** may leak; it all depends on **cleansing the mind and purifying thoughts**, bathing and reinforcing defenses. Gradually passing the **thirteenth day**, **Gān-Jiā** (干甲) is born—this is the **fifteenth day**. This day is **full and complete**, the **time of Gān-Kūn**. **Yīn-Yù** (鄞鄂) is formed, the **Mysterious Female** (玄牝) is established, the **Golden Flower** (金花) appears, and the **Three Yangs** (三陽) are complete. The moon is full in the **Jiā direction**, corresponding to the **Gān symbol**. Fearful that the **Golden Elixir** may drift too far, this is precisely the moment when **sun and moon both shine brightly**—the **second watch** for obtaining the **Elixir**.

The **fourth watch** has its own marvelous applications, symbolizing the **first half of the month**. Within the **half-moon’s glow**, there are **Dragon’s roars and Tiger’s howls**—one must consider **warding off peril and guarding against danger**.

After the **Embryonic Sage** (仙胎) forms, by the **eighteenth day**, in the **Xùn-Yīn** (巽陰) position, there are the **mysteries of defending the city and waging battle**. Next, refining the **second Yin**, on the **twenty-third day**, the **washing of the heart and bathing in the Gǒn-Earth** (艮地) has its applications. Having refined the **three Yins**, the **Yang Spirit** emerges—this is the **mystery of reinforcing the dikes and ensuring passage**.

These are the **first three threes** and **last three threes** of the **four watches**, the **logic of the two watches** for obtaining the **Elixir**.

**Divine Guard of the Mysterious Palace, Welcoming the Feminine Chamber**—these two lines are the **incantation for gathering the Elixir**. When within the **Mysterious Palace**, the **most refined essence** emerges, and the **True Lead’s Qi** manifests as a **wheel of bright moon**; the **True Mercury’s fire** appears as a **wheel of red sun**. Within the sun and moon, each emits **two Golden Flowers**, vast as **Red Mountains**, golden-red in hue. At this moment, neither **too old nor too young**, one must **urgently gather and take them**. How does one gather and take? The **incantation says**: *"Only welcome the Feminine Chamber."* Naturally, in **dim and obscure** states, a **point of red light** flashes into the **Lower Elixir Field**, meeting the **True Yin**. **Yin** gathers naturally, **Yin** stirs **Yang**, **Yang** embraces **Yin**, and **Yin-Yang** surge, waves crashing in the **Sea**. From the **Great Mysterious Pass** to the **Tailbone Spine**, passing the **Jade Pillow**, it transforms into **Golden Elixir and Nectar**, swallowed into the abdomen—fragrant, sweet, and crisp. The ears hear **drumbeats**, **ten thousand sounds** like thunder, **Heaven’s Pinion Music**—neither **zither nor se**, neither **flute nor shawm**, but a **wondrous sound unlike any other**: like **cold springs rinsing jade**, like **golden plates clanging in emptiness**, like **autumn cicadas drawing silk**, like **wind rustling green pines**. **Línláng resounds**. There are **crowds of crows cawing**, **birds chirping in harmony**. The mouth is filled, the eyes dazzled, the heart joyful, the mind delighted—truly the **Land of Ultimate Bliss**, the **Celestial Palace’s Marvelous Realm**. **Worldly mortals**, like the **blind and deaf**, cannot perceive it. With **body and mind in purity**, the **ten thousand passes** harmonize, **ten thousand pores** bloom with vitality, the body radiates **ten thousand rays of light**, and a **round light** appears within, bearing the **image of an infant**—this is the **Yang Spirit’s manifestation**. All depends on **warding off peril and guarding against danger**; one must not stray far. **Chapter Five: Nourishment and Warmth** follows.

The **Spirit dwells in the Yellow Chamber**, and the **Golden Embryo** forms naturally. The **Yellow Chamber** is the space beneath the **Heavenly Stem (干)** and above the **Earthly Branch (坤)**, the marvel within the **circular measure (规中)**. Within the **twelve hours**, ever-mindful, **light contained and radiance hidden**. In **moving, standing, sitting, or lying**, ever-present like a hen brooding her egg, like a dragon nurturing its pearl. **Embrace the Primordial, guard the One**—the **Preheaven Essence-Spirit and Essence-Qi** merge moment by moment, transforming gradually.

Only **calm the spirit and rest**, and **fire moves without effort**; in **a hundred days**, the **function manifests**; in **ten months**, the **embryo is complete**, the **Yin soul dissolves**, and the **Yang Spirit appears**. After **a thousand days**, **nurture the fire to sufficiency**, exhaust all **Yin impurities**, the body becomes **pure Yang**, the **infant form manifests**, a **second body beyond the physical**, like **mist and clouds**, the **Spirit harmonized with the Great Void**. When **hidden**, form merges with spirit; when **manifest**, spirit merges with **qi**. **Treading sun and moon without trace**, piercing **metal and stone without hindrance**.

After **three years of nurturing**, the **infant matures**; do not stray far. Until **nine years**, it **unites with the Great Void**, form and spirit both perfected, **aligned with the Dao/Way and True Reality**. Though **heavens, earth, mountains, and rivers** may crumble, **this Dao/Way-body endures through cataclysms**. Concealed among mortals, **accumulating merit and practice**, **lifting heaven and earth**, **grasping Yin and Yang**—thus **Yin and Yang cannot forge or constrain**.

The **Dao/Way of Heavenly Immortals** is now complete!

**The Holy Annotation of the Emperor of Double-Nine** states:
The **Yellow Chamber** is the **Yellow Court Palace (黄庭宫)**, thus beneath the **Heavenly Stem (干)** and above the **Earthly Branch (坤)**, within the **circular measure (规矩)**. The **Golden Embryo** is the **Immortal Embryo**; gold is **unyielding and unbreakable**, this being the **Primordial Spirit**. This **Primordial Spirit** is **indestructible and immortal**, a **pure, subtle, and wondrous** essence—**as firm as gold, as sharp as steel**, **clear as crystal, bright as a full moon**, its **luminosity unwaning**, yet lost through **a single deluded thought**. It arises from **illusion and transformation**.

Now, having cultivated the **five-sections’ oral precepts**, attaining the **returning elixir Dao/Way**, one must **refine the union of presence and absence**, **cast black to form red**, and **complete the Immortal Embryo**. Returning to **original True Constancy**, merging with **Primordial Beginning’s marvelous function**, the **Golden Embryo forms naturally**. The **marvel within the circular measure** is **guarded by the Spirit**. Within the **Yellow Chamber**, the **mind must not scatter**. In the **twelve hours**, ever-mindful, **light contained and radiance hidden**, **eyes withdrawn, ears gathered**, ever-present like a hen brooding her egg, like a dragon nurturing its pearl.

The dragon nurtures the **pearl beneath its throat**; with **mind and intent unbroken**, **spirit transforms it**, and the pearl **emits light**. As the **light endures**, the pearl becomes a **small dragon**, soaring through the **Great Void**, now **released, now withdrawn**—when mortals see it, it is the **form of the dragon**, the **Spirit of the dragon**. The **Spirit’s transformations**—**summoning clouds, bringing rain, shedding bones to fly**—this is the **Spirit-Dragon**. Thus it can **expand or shrink**, **conceal or reveal**. In **action**, it **splits mountains, raises tides**, **summons clouds, evokes mist**, **drags lightning, thunders**. In **stillness**, it **hides in deep springs**—a **Yang numinous essence**.

The **Golden Elixir Dao/Way** for those who **pursue Heavenly Immortality** follows this principle. Initially, **embrace the Primordial, guard the One**, nurturing the **Preheaven millet-grain**—the **Essence-Spirit’s marvelous pearl**. The **Scripture of Passage** says:
*"The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable suspended a **treasure pearl**, five zhang above the earth, within the void. **Ten thousand saints and true ones** emerged from its mouth, **boiling and surging**, then re-entered through its mouth."*

Nurturing it long, the **Primordial Spirit millet-grain** naturally **meets and transforms**, like **new moon to crescent, half-moon to full**. **Gold light emerges**, **sun and moon unite in a single orb**, **lead and mercury merge**, and the **Immortal Embryo forms**. After **three years of nurturing**, the **infant matures**. Until **nine years**, the **practice is complete**, **Yin dross exhausted**. **One Spirit can transform into ten thousand spirits**; form and spirit both perfected—**emerging without trace, refining without end**—the **Spirit merges with the Great Void**, returning to the **True Dao/Way of the Non-Ultimate**, uniting with the **Primordial Beginning’s marvelous realm**.

Observe **heaven and earth within profound mystery**—like **a single millet grain in the Great Granary**, **a single cloud in the Great Void**! What **Five Phases** can bind it? What **Yin-Yang transformations** can alter it? Here, **heaven and earth are lifted by me**, **Yin and Yang grasped by me**—**eternal without end**, enduring through **cataclysms**, **aligned with the Dao/Way and True Reality**. **Awe-inspiring! Awe-inspiring!**

The compiler explains: The *Production of Elixirs* chapter states: **"The Yellow Court Palace lies *before the inner kidneys and behind the navel wheel, at the hollow orifice of the central void*."** Master Liu Hua-yang of the True Dao/Way declares: **"The orifice is the Dantian; above it is the Golden Cauldron, slightly above the cauldron is the Yellow Court; below the orifice is Guanyuan. The ancients said, ‘Above is the Yellow Court, below is Guanyuan,’ and so it is."** Further, he says: **"The Yellow Court, Golden Cauldron, Dantian, and Guanyuan—these four orifices are indistinct in form. If one seeks them by fixating on form, one will err!"** Thus, the Yellow Court, Golden Cauldron, Dantian, and Guanyuan merge as one: **when the *qi* is active, the orifice forms; when the mechanism ceases, it vanishes into obscurity.** Beginners cannot distinguish them, nor need they distinguish them.

Master Liu further declares: **"The Dantian’s orifice is *right behind the kidneys, slightly forward of the inner kidneys, seven parts in front and three behind, suspended in the center as a hollow cavity*."** This aligns precisely with what the Emperor of Double Yang indicated, thus revealing Master Liu’s teachings had their own foundation.

**For those who cultivate the Dao/Way, it is like a dragon nurturing a pearl.** With time, **the Spirit undergoes full transformation**, **manifesting and concealing at will**—this is called the **Spirit Dragon**. Just as ordinary mortals, through cultivation, attain the principle of becoming Heavenly Immortals, **the explanation is rendered with such intimacy!**

The *Scripture for Transcending Mortals and Granting Infinite Life*—**"The Supreme Lord’s Mystic Essence Scripture of the Spiritual Treasure for Transcending Mortals"**—is said to have been composed by the **Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable** during the early **Lónghàn** era. The *sutra* can be recited and invoked, and it also **prolongs the Elixir and extends vision**.

The phrase **"The Primordial Beginning Heavenly Venerable suspends a single precious pearl, five zhang above the earth"** refers to **only those who truly cultivate and truly verify** can speak of this.

What is meant by **"lifting heaven and earth, grasping Yin and Yang"**?
It is the same as **Master Wu Chong-xū’s** **"harmonizing the Heavenly and Earthly"**—**the True Dao/Way of the Non-Ultimate**.

After the adept attains the rank of Heavenly Immortal, **a single luminous Spirit shines steadfastly for eight thousand kalpas**, its **enlightened radiance enveloping the Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds**. Within this luminous sphere, **all flying birds and walking beasts, all human movements and thoughts—whether benevolent or malevolent—are exposed without concealment**.

**Wherever in heaven and earth there are conditions unfit for human survival, the adept modifies them**; **wherever in phenomena there are threats to human life, the adept reverses the Yin-Yang mechanisms beforehand to eliminate them**—this is what is meant by **lifting heaven and earth, grasping Yin and Yang**.
