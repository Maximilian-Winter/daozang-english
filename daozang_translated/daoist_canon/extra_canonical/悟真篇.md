# 悟真篇

**Preface to *Awakening to Reality***

Alas! The human body is hard to obtain, yet time slips away with ease. Who can fathom the span of life or escape the retribution of karma? If one does not awaken in time, content merely to await the end, a single misguided thought at the crossroads will plunge one into the three evil destinies, where eons may pass without hope of deliverance. When that time comes, though one may repent, what use will it be?

Thus, the sages of Daoism and Buddhism opened the gate of expedient means in the study of *xing* and *ming*, teaching people to cultivate the seed of transcendence and escape the cycle of birth and death. Buddhism takes emptiness and quiescence as its essence; if one attains sudden enlightenment and perfect comprehension, one may directly cross to the other shore. Yet if habitual defilements remain unexhausted, one still clings to conditioned existence. Daoism regards refinement and nurturance as the truth; if one grasps its pivotal essence, one may ascend to sagehood in an instant. But if one fails to awaken to the original nature, one remains mired in the illusory form.

Next, the *Book of Changes* contains sayings on exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining destiny, while the *Analects* speaks of "having no preconceptions, no predeterminations, no obstinacy, no ego"—these are Confucius’ profoundest insights into the mysteries of *xing* and *ming*. Yet why are his words so often brief and lacking in detail? It is because he sought to order human relationships and propagate the teachings of benevolence, righteousness, ritual, and music—all active endeavors. Thus, he never explicitly expounded the Dao of non-action, but concealed the arts of destiny within the images of the *Changes* and mingled the methods of nature within his subtle words.

As for *Zhuangzi*, who exhaustively explored the nature of freedom from worldly entanglements, and *Mencius*, who excelled in nurturing the vast *qi* of integrity—both came close to the crux of the matter. Later, during the Han, Wei Boyang drew upon the *Changes* to elucidate the principle of yin-yang union in the *Can Tong Qi*, clarifying the workings of the Great Elixir. In the Tang, Master Zhong of the Loyal Lineage, in the preface to his recorded sayings, expounded the words of Laozi and Zhuangzi to reveal the root and branches of the supreme Dao. Is this not proof that though the teachings diverge into three, the Dao ultimately returns to one?

Yet how lamentable that later generations of Daoist and Buddhist practitioners, each clinging to their own sect, have disparaged one another, causing the essential purport of the three traditions to be lost amid heterodox paths, unable to merge and return to unity!

Moreover, people today assume that the Daoist path emphasizes the cultivation of *ming*, yet they do not understand that the methods of cultivating *ming* branch into two: those that are easily encountered but difficult to perfect, and those that are difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. Practices such as refining the *qi* of the Five Sprouts, absorbing the radiance of the Seven Luminaries, visualizing and massaging, inhaling the pure and exhaling the turbid, reciting scriptures and mantras, sprinkling water and chanting talismans, clicking the teeth to gather spirits, abandoning wives and fasting, concentrating the spirit and holding the breath, directing thoughts between the brows, replenishing the brain and returning essence, or practicing the arts of the bedchamber—along with ingesting and refining minerals, herbs, and other substances—all belong to the category of what is easily encountered but difficult to perfect.

The above methods, in their approach to cultivating the body, are generally fragmented and incomplete. Though one may expend great effort, no verifiable results are obtained. If one diligently applies oneself with bitter resolve, practicing day and night, one may at best avoid illness and prevent untimely misfortune. Yet if one ceases practice even for a day, previous efforts gradually dissipate. Such methods merely prolong the years without hope of true accomplishment. How can one expect to attain permanence, reverse aging, transform the body, and ascend in flight? It is truly pitiable!

Most practitioners in recent times cling to delusions and fail to awaken to the truth of the wondrous method, instead blaming the immortals for deceit. Little do they know that those who attain the Dao all do so through the refinement of the Golden Elixir. Fearing the leakage of celestial secrets, the sages concealed the truth beneath a veil of symbolic names. Among these methods, only breath-holding resembles the seated meditation of the Two Vehicles: if one can forget scheming and still the mind, one may enter samadhi and project the spirit. Yet the spirit belongs to yin, and the dwelling of the body is hard to stabilize, necessitating constant migration. Without mastering the way of returning mercury and lead, how can one reverse the bones, transform the yang, and ascend to heaven in broad daylight?

The refinement of the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir, by contrast, is difficult to encounter but easy to perfect. One must thoroughly comprehend yin and yang, deeply penetrate the workings of creation, then pursue the two *qi* along the Yellow Path, unite the three natures in the Primordial Palace, gather the Five Phases, harmonize the Four Images, where dragon chants and tiger roars, husband sings and wife follows, the Jade Crucible simmers, and the Golden Furnace blazes—only then can the Mysterious Pearl take form and the Great One return to truth. All this may be accomplished in a brief moment, yet it secures boundless ease and joy for eternity.

As for guarding against danger and anticipating peril, one must be cautious in the operations of withdrawal and addition; in nurturing the upright and maintaining fullness, the key lies in embracing the feminine and holding to the One. Naturally, the *qi* of yang rebirth arises, and the form of yin dissolution is shed. Once the nodal phases are complete, one casts off the womb and transforms the spirit, the name is inscribed in the immortal register, and the title of Perfected One is conferred—this is the moment when the great man’s work is accomplished and his name is established.

Yet today’s scholars take lead and mercury as the two *qi*, designate the viscera as the Five Phases, divide heart and kidneys into *kan* and *li*, regard liver and lungs as dragon and tiger, employ spirit and *qi* as mother and child, and grasp fluids as lead and mercury. Unaware of sinking and floating, unable to distinguish host and guest, how is this different from mistaking another’s wealth for one’s own or calling a child of another surname one’s own? How can they fathom the subtleties of metal and wood overcoming one another or the mysteries of yin and yang interpenetrating?

All this is like the sun and moon losing their path, lead and mercury placed in separate furnaces—how can one expect to congeal the Returned Elixir? It is truly difficult!

From youth, I have been fond of the Dao and traversed the scriptures of the Three Teachings, extending even to legal codes, mathematics, medicine, divination, military strategy, astronomy, geography, and the arts of fortune and misfortune, life and death—nothing has escaped my careful study. Yet regarding the method of the Golden Elixir, though I have perused all the classics and the songs, poems, treatises, and concordances of various schools, all speak of the sun’s essence and moon’s spirit, the metal tiger and wood dragon, mercury and cinnabar, silver and lead, *li* and *kan* as male and female, capable of forming the Golden Liquor and Returned Elixir. None, however, reveal what true lead and true mercury truly are, nor do they explain the methods of fire phases, the measures of refinement, or the aims of nurturing and preservation.

Moreover, later generations of deluded practitioners, indulging their fanciful interpretations, have wantonly annotated the sacred teachings of the ancients, introducing myriad errors and distortions.

Not only have they thrown the immortal classics into chaos, but they have also led later students astray. As for myself, having never encountered a perfected one nor received oral instructions, I grew restless in sleep and meals, my spirit withering away. Though I sought answers across mountains and seas, consulting both the wise and the foolish, none could truly comprehend the essential teaching or illuminate the depths of my heart.

Later, in the year *Jiyou* of the *Xining* reign (1069), while accompanying Minister Lu of the Dragon Diagram to Chengdu, my unwavering resolve and deep sincerity moved a true immortal to bestow upon me the secret instructions on the Golden Elixir’s ingredients and fire phases. His words were concise, his essentials uncluttered—pointing to the stream to reveal the source, speaking one to awaken a hundred. Like mist dispersing to reveal the sun’s brilliance, or dust settling to expose a mirror’s clarity, they aligned with the immortal classics as if matching tally tokens.

I observed that of those who pursue immortality, eight or nine in ten do so; yet scarcely one or two grasp its true essence. Having received this authentic transmission, how could I dare conceal it? I poured forth all I had gained, composing eighty-one regulated verses titled *Awakening to Reality*. Among them are sixteen quatrains in seven-character lines, reflecting the number of the two eights; sixty-four jueju, arranged according to the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi*; one five-character verse, symbolizing the singularity of the Great One; and twelve additional *Xijiangyue* lyrics, corresponding to the twelve months of the year. Within these are fully expounded the hierarchy of the crucible, the weights of the ingredients, the progression and retreat of the fire phases, the precedence of host and guest, the interplay of existence and non-existence, and the auspices of fortune and misfortune.

Yet after completing the collection, I realized it spoke only of the arts of nurturing life and securing the body, leaving the original awakening of the true nature unexplored. Thus, I delved into Buddhist scriptures and the *Transmission of the Lamp*, where I found that even the patriarchs had attained enlightenment through a bamboo’s strike. This moved me to compose thirty-two additional pieces—songs, odes, poems, and miscellaneous verses—which I appended to the end of the scroll. Here, at last, the Way of realizing the fundamental and illuminating the nature is made complete.

May those of shared aspiration who read this perceive the root through the branches and abandon delusion to follow the real.

**Scroll One: Sixteen Seven-Character Quatrains**

**(Marking the count of two eights and one jin)**

**I**
Not seeking the great Dao to escape delusion’s way,
Though burdened with talent, how can one be a true man?
A hundred years of life—spark struck from stone,
A lifetime’s fate—bubble afloat on water.
Only craving fame and profit, chasing glory’s sheen,
Unheeding how the form withers, darkly sere and dry.
Ask then: though gold be piled like mountains high,
Can impermanence be bought to grant a single "no"?

**II**
Though man’s life may span a hundred years,
Short or long, poverty or ease—none can foreknow.
Yesterday through streets he galloped proud,
Today in coffin lies his sleeping shroud.
Wife and wealth abandoned, no longer his to hold,
Karmic deeds advance—no self-deceit can hide.
If the great elixir is not sought, how chance to meet?
Meeting yet not refining—foolish folly indeed.

**III**
To learn immortality, learn the Heavenly Immortal’s way,
For only the Golden Vessel is most true and sure.
When the two meet, nature and feeling unite,
Where the Five Phases are whole, tiger and dragon coil.
Originally through *xu* and *ji* they wed as matchmakers,
Thus husband and wife in joyous union stay.
Awaiting only merit’s completion to ascend the Jade Towers,
Amid ninefold rosy clouds, riding the auspicious radiance.

**IV**
Three, five, one—three characters in all,
From ancient times to now, few truly understand.
East’s three and south’s two together make five,
North’s one and west’s four share the same.
*Xu* and *ji* dwell in the generative number five,
When the three families meet, the infant is conceived.
The infant is the One, containing true qi,
Ten months’ gestation complete—entering the sage’s foundation.

**V**
Grasses and trees, yin and yang—both must align,
If one is lacking, no fragrance will rise.
First unfurl green leaves, yang taking the lead,
Then bloom red blossoms, yin following after.
The common way is but this in daily use,
Yet who knows the true source’s reversal and return?
I say to all who study the Dao:
Without knowing yin and yang, do not act in vain.

**VI**
Within yang, yin’s essence lacks firmness,
Cultivating one alone leaves the body frail.
Exhausting form with exercises—none is the Dao,
Ingesting qi, dining on mist—all is madness.
The world vainly seeks lead and mercury’s taming,
When will they witness tiger and dragon’s descent?
I urge you: exhaustively seek your birth’s origin,
Returning to the root, restoring the source—this is the Medicine King.

**VII**
Every person possesses the elixir of long life,
Yet deluded fools cast it aside in vain.
When sweet dew descends, heaven and earth unite,
Where yellow sprouts arise, *kan* and *li* intertwine.
The well-frog claims no dragon’s cave exists,
The hedge-sparrow disputes the phoenix’s nest.
When the cinnabar ripens, gold fills the house of itself—
Why seek herbs to burn and thatch?

**VIII**
Cease refining the Three Yellows and Four Spirits,
Seeking myriad herbs is not the true way.
Yin and yang, matched in kind, return to mutual resonance,
Two eights in balance naturally unite as kin.
At the pool’s bottom, the sun’s red dispels yin’s specters,
On the mountain’s peak, the moon’s white brings fresh elixir sprouts.
If men would know true lead and mercury,
They are not mere cinnabar or quicksilver.

**IX**
This method is true, yet within it truer still,
For it arises from my singular difference from others.
I know the inversion comes from *li* and *kan*,
But who discerns the floating and sinking to fix host and guest?
The golden crucible seeks to retain mercury within cinnabar,
The jade pool first receives silver from water.
The divine work of firing is not a day’s labor—
Behold: in the deep pool, a single moon’s wheel appears.

**X**
To know where the medicine’s river-source arises,
The moon in the southwest is its native land.
When lead meets *gui*’s birth, swiftly gather it,
Gold at full moon’s distance is not fit to taste.
Send it to the earthen crucible, seal fast,
Then into flowing pearls let them pair and unite.
The medicine weighs two jin—two eights required,
Harmonizing fire and timing, entrusting to yin and yang.

**XI**
Tiger leaps, dragon soars—waves surge rough,
At the center’s rightful place, the mysterious pearl is born.
Fruit on the branch awaits ripening in time,
The child in the womb—how could it be different?
North and south schools reverse the hexagrams’ signs,
Dawn and dusk’s firing accords with the celestial pivot.
Know that the great hermit dwells in the marketplace—
Why must one guard solitude in deep mountains?

**XII**
Not knowing the inversion within the mysterious,
How can one plant lotuses in fire?
Lead the White Tiger home to rear,
Bear a bright pearl round as the moon.
Vainly tending the elixir furnace, watching the fire’s timing,
Simply settle the spirit and breath, entrusting to nature.
When the host of yin is wholly stripped away, the cinnabar ripens,
Leaping from the cage to live ten thousand years.

**XIII**
Yellow sprouts and white snow are not hard to find,
But the adept must rely on deep virtue and conduct.
The Four Images and Five Phases wholly depend on earth,
The Three Primes and Eight Trigrams—how could they leave *ren*?
Refining into the numinous treasure is hard to recognize,
Dissolving yin’s demons, ghosts dare not invade.
Wishing to leave secret formulas among men,
Yet not one encounter proves a knowing friend.

**XIV**
Diligently seek true lead with intent,
Lest time slip by too easily.
Simply capture earth’s *po* to tame cinnabar’s mercury,
Naturally heaven’s *hun* will subdue water’s gold.
This may be called Dao so lofty dragons and tigers submit,
Worthy of saying virtue so weighty ghosts and spirits revere.
Already knowing life spans equal heaven and earth,
No cause for affliction to rise in the heart.

**XV**
Not recognizing true lead as the primal ancestor,
All efforts applied are but wasted toil.
Renouncing wives vainly severs yin and yang,
Fasting empties the bowels—all in vain.
Grasses and trees, yin and yang—all are dregs,
Clouds and mist, sun and moon—belong to the turbid.
Even adding breathing exercises and visualization,
All differ from the work of the golden elixir.

**XVI**
Ten thousand scrolls of elixir scriptures speak the same,
The Golden Vessel alone is the root and source.
Relying on *kun*’s position to form the body,
Planted in *qian*’s house, the organs of resonance.
Marvel not that the celestial mechanism is wholly revealed,
Only because scholars are all benighted and dull.
If one can grasp the meaning within these verses,
At once they will meet the Three Purities’ Most High Lord.

**Scroll Two: Sixty-Four Seven-Character Quatrains**

**(By Hexagram and Number)**

**I**
The Dao from emptiness gives birth to the primal qi,
From this single qi arise yin and yang.
Yin and yang unite to form the Three Bodies,
The Three Bodies engender the flourishing of the ten thousand things.

**II**
The ten thousand things, teeming, each return to the root;
Returning to the root and reviving life is everlasting.
To know constancy and return to the origin—few comprehend,
While reckless action invites misfortune, as all have heard.

**III**
Simply take the gate of death as the gate of life,
Do not cling to the gate of life and call it the gate of death.
If one grasps the mechanism of killing and reversal,
Only then will one know that harm conceals grace.

**IV**
Fortune and misfortune from of old intertwine,
Like echo and shadow following one another.
If one can turn this mechanism of life and death,
Disaster transforms to blessing in the space between palm and hand.

**V**
To secure the Valley Spirit and never die,
One must rely on the Mysterious Female to establish the root.
Once true essence returns to the golden chamber,
A single luminous pearl will never depart.

**VI**
The gate of the Mysterious Female is rarely known in the world,
Do not mistakenly apply it to mouth and nose.
Even with a thousand years of breathing exercises,
How can one seize the golden horse and grapple the hare?

**VII**
Few know that different names arise from the same source,
These two mysteries within mysteries are the essential mechanism.
To preserve life and perfect form, discern gain and loss—
The purple-gold elixir is most wondrous and rare.

**VIII**
Not recognizing yin and yang, nor host and guest,
How can one know which is distant and which is near?
In the chamber, vainly sealing the Gate of Tailbone,
How many in Jambudvīpa have been led to ruin?

**IX**
First observe heaven to understand the Five Thieves,
Next examine earth to pacify the people.
Only when the people are at peace and the state prosperous should one wage war,
After war’s end can the sage be seen.

**X**
In deployment, distinguish left and right armies,
Though they may be host and I the guest.
I urge you: in battle, do not underestimate the foe,
Lest you lose our priceless treasure.

**XI**
The Three Powers plunder one another in their time,
This is the mechanism of the immortals’ virtue and power.
Once the myriad transformations are at peace and all concerns cease,
The hundred bones are all ordered, and non-action is realized.

**XII**
The *Yinfu*’s treasured words exceed three hundred,
The *Daode*’s numinous script fills five thousand.
Immortals of past and present are without number,
Yet all from this point reach the true essence.

**XIII**
The *Cantong Qi*, scriptures, and songs expound the utmost truth,
Yet fire-phases are not set down in writing.
To know the oral instructions that penetrate the mystery,
One must discuss them carefully with an immortal.

**XIV**
Though your wisdom surpasses Yan and Min,
Without a teacher’s transmission, do not force guesses.
For elixir scriptures lack oral instructions,
Where then can you congeal the numinous embryo?

**XV**
Dreaming of thirst, I ascended Xihua to the nine heavens,
Where a perfected one bestowed upon me the *Zhixuan* chapter.
Its essentials are few, with little speech,
Only teaching one to refine mercury and lead.

**XVI**
Do not use common lead—use true lead,
Yet even true lead, once used, must be discarded.
This is the true and wondrous secret of using lead:
To use lead is not to use it—this is the truth.

**XVII**
When bamboo is split, it must be mended with bamboo;
To hatch a chicken, one must use an egg.
All other methods are vain toil,
How can they compare to true lead, which contains the sacred mechanism?

**XVIII**
Do not hide in the mountains before refining the returning elixir,
For all before and after in the mountains is not lead.
This supreme treasure exists in every household,
Yet people of this age fail to recognize it fully.

**XIX**
"Empty the heart and fill the belly"—both meanings run deep,
But to empty the heart, one must first know the heart.
Better to refine lead and first fill the belly,
Then guard the hall filled with gold.

**XX**
The sun dwelling in *Li*’s position becomes female,
The moon paired with the Toad Palace is male.
If one does not grasp this inversion,
Do not presume to speak of lofty matters with limited insight.

**XXI**
The *Zhen* dragon’s mercury emerges from *Li*’s land,
The *Dui* tiger’s gold is born in *Kan*’s direction.
These two things arise as the child produces the mother,
The Five Phases must all enter the center.

**XXII**
If *Li* and *Kan* lack *Xu* and *Ji*,
Though they contain the Four Images, the elixir will not form.
Only because each holds true earth,
Can the golden elixir return and revert.

**XXIII**
Fire born of wood inherently conceals its edge,
Without understanding, do not forcefully drill.
Disaster arises from this—it harms oneself,
One must subdue it to seek the Metal Lord.

**XXIV**
The Metal Lord is originally the Eastern House’s son,
Sent to dwell in the Western Neighbor to lodge and grow.
If you recognize and summon him to return and nurture,
Pair him with the Maiden to forge a bond.

**XXV**
The Maiden wanders in all directions,
Her forward path must be short, her rearward long.
Returning, she enters the Yellow Dame’s abode,
To wed the Metal Lord as her old husband.

**XXVI**
Take the solid center from *Kan*’s position,
To transmute the yin within *Li*’s palace.
From this, it transforms into *Qian*’s vigorous body,
Hidden or soaring—all is governed by the heart.

**XXVII**
First take *Qian* and *Kun* as the crucible and vessel,
Next gather the hare and crow to cook the medicine.
Once these two are driven into the Yellow Path,
How can the golden vessel fail to be born?

**XXVIII**
Establish the furnace and set up the vessel according to *Qian* and *Kun*,
Refine the essence to subdue the po and hun.
Gathering and dispersing, misty and dense, they transform,
Dare one treat such mysteries as trivial?

**XXIX**
Swallowing saliva and absorbing qi are human practices,
Only with medicine can creation and transformation arise.
If the crucible lacks a true seed,
It is like boiling water and fire in an empty cauldron.

**XXX**
Even if you recognize cinnabar and black lead,
Without knowing the fire-phases, it is all in vain.
It all depends entirely on the power of cultivation—
A hair’s breadth of delay, and the elixir will not form.

**XXXI**
Black containing white is the elixir’s mother,
Yang concealing yin is the sacred embryo.
The Great One in the furnace must be guarded with care,
The Three Fields gather treasures like the Three Terraces.

**XXXII**
Within the indistinct, seek the image,
Within the profound darkness, find the true essence.
From this, being and non-being mutually enter,
Without seeing, how can one imagine it complete?

**XXXIII**
The eldest son suddenly drinks wine from the west,
The youngest daughter first blooms flowers in the north.
Once the Green Maiden meets him,
All is sealed at once in the Yellow House.

**XXXIV**
On Mount Hua’s peak, the male tiger roars,
In Fusang’s sea, the female dragon sings.
The Yellow Dame herself knows how to mediate,
Sending them to become husband and wife with one heart.

**XXXV**
The White Tiger of the Western Mountain rages,
The Green Dragon of the Eastern Sea cannot be withstood.
Seize them with both hands and make them fight to the death,
Transforming into a sheet of purple-gold frost.

**XXXVI**
The Red Dragon and Black Tiger, each in west and east,
The Four Images intersect in *Xu* and *Ji*.

**XXXVII**
Since filth is now transformed to function,
Who says the golden elixir cannot be achieved?

**XXXVIII**
The moon at heaven’s edge, half a wheel bright,
Already the dragon’s chant and tiger’s roar arise.
Best now to refine the dual eights with diligence,
Within one double-hour the elixir is complete.

**XXXIX**
Resplendent, the golden elixir forms in a day—
The ancient immortals’ words are truly worth heeding.
Those who speak of nine years or three years
Are merely procrastinating to extend their days.

**XL**
Striking bamboo to summon the turtle to swallow jade mushrooms,
Strumming the zither to call the phoenix to drink the knife’s measure.
Of late, golden light shines through the body,
No longer speaking of these principles to ordinary folk.

**XLI**
Within the crescent-moon furnace, jade buds sprout,
In the cinnabar tripod, mercury lies level.
Only after the fire’s force is harmonized
Does the yellow sprout gradually grow.

**XLII**
Do not cling to the labor of the elixir hearth—
To refine the medicine, seek the crescent-moon furnace.
There exists a natural true fire’s season;
Why rely on kindling or forced breath?

**XLIII**
Between the waning and waxing moon’s phases,
The medicine’s flavor is balanced, its qi complete.
Once gathered and returned, it is forged within the furnace,
Forged and nurtured as if simmering fresh delicacies.

**XLIV**
In the hare and rooster’s months, at their appointed time,
Punishment and virtue arrive at the gate—such is the medicine’s image.
At this point, the golden elixir should be bathed;
If fire is added, it will surely topple into danger.

**XLV**
Ou Ye personally transmitted the sword-forging method,
Moye’s metal and water tempered softness and hardness.
Once refined, it understands human intent,
Slaying demons a thousand miles away in a flash of lightning.

**XLVI**
Harmonizing lead and mercury to form the elixir,
Neither great nor small harms the two realms’ wholeness.
If one asks where true lead is found,
The toad’s radiance shines all day upon the Western River.

**XLVII**
On the fifteenth of the eighth month, admiring the toad’s glow,
It is precisely when the golden essence is robust and flourishing.
When the first yang arises in revival,
One may then advance the fire without delay.

**XLVIII**
As soon as the first yang stirs to begin the elixir,
The lead tripod glows warmly behind the curtain.
At the moment of receiving qi, it is easily recognized,
But in drawing and adding, tending the fire, guard against peril.

**XLIX**
Sun and moon meet once every thirty days,
Exchanging time for days by the method of divine work.
Defending the city or waging wild battles, knowing fortune and misfortune,
One gains numinous cinnabar filling the tripod with red.

**L**
The mysterious pearl takes form as yang arises,
Yang at its peak, yin wanes, gradually stripping away form.
In the tenth month, frost flies, the elixir ripens,
At this time, even spirits and ghosts must be startled.

**LI**
After drinking at Jasper Pool, the moon’s radiance clears,
Mounting a golden dragon to visit the Purple Tenuity.
From then on, after meeting the assembled immortals,
The seas and fields, hills and valleys may shift at will.

**LII**
Do not exert clever deceit as effort,
Recognize the other family’s deathless method.
In the gourd, swiftly add the wine of extended life,
In the tripod, gather the essence of returned souls.

**LIII**
Snow Mountain’s single flavor is the finest ghee,
Poured into the Eastern Sun’s crucible of transformation.
If it passes beyond Kunlun to the northwest,
Zhang Qian first meets Ma Gu.

**LIV**
Thunder roars, refining the golden-water method,
Fire erupts on Kunlun, yin and yang conjoined.
If these two substances harmonize,
Naturally the elixir matures, fragrance suffusing the body.

**LV**
To know the method of refining and nurturing the returned elixir,
One must plant the seed in one’s own garden.
Without forced breath or exertion,
Naturally the fruit ripens, the numinous embryo forms.

**LVI**
Before refining the returned elixir, refine it swiftly;
Once refined, one must know when to stop and be content.
If one’s heart remains insatiable in holding abundance,
One will inevitably one day suffer distress and humiliation.

**LVII**
Only after adversity and prosperity pass through myriad things’ fullness,
Do difficulty and simplicity receive their seals, upholding generation.
In this, attaining the meaning, one must forget images;
If one exhaustively investigates the hexagrams, one vainly labors the emotions.

**LVIII**
The hexagrams’ established methods are originally forms,
Attaining the image, forgetting words, the intent becomes clear.
The deluded people of the world cling only to images,
Yet practice hexagram qi, hoping for ascension.

**LIX**
Heaven and earth’s fullness and emptiness have their times;
Only by discerning ebb and flow does one grasp the mechanism.
From of old, *geng* and *jia* clarify the mandate,
Slaying the Three Worms, the Dao may be attained.

**LX**
When the Four Images converge, the mysterious body is complete,
Where the Five Phases are whole, purple light shines.
Shedding the embryo, entering the mouth, one becomes divine and sagely,
Countless divine dragons all lose their astonishment.

**LXI**
Medicine meets its kindred qi to form an image,
The Dao resides in emptiness, uniting with spontaneity.
Swallowing a single grain of numinous elixir,
One then knows my life is not ruled by heaven.

**LXII**
The great Dao’s cultivation has ease and difficulty,
One knows it depends on me, yet also on heaven.
If not for accumulating deeds and bestowing hidden virtue,
At every move, hordes of demons would obstruct the path.

**LXIII**
Only when the mind-monkey is stilled and the square-inch mechanism,
Three thousand merits and deeds align with heaven.
Naturally there is a tripod to refine dragon and tiger,
Why cling to home, yearning for children and wife?

**LXIV**
Cultivation blends with the world, yet harmonizes its light,
Round when round, square when square.
Concealed or revealed, contrary or compliant, none can fathom,
How can one make others see one’s conduct and concealment?

**Five-Character Quatrain (On the Image of the Supreme Unity)**
*(Omitted as the original text cuts off mid-line.)*

A maiden dons azure robes,
A gentleman wears plain silk.
Seen, they cannot be used;
Used, they cannot be seen.
In fleeting glimpses they meet,
In profound obscurity they transform.
A flash—flame soars aloft,
And the true adept appears.

**Twelve *Xijiang yue* Lyrics**
*(Xijiang yue: "West River Moon." West is the direction of metal; river, the body of water; moon, the function of the elixir. Twelve lyrics to correspond with the twelve months of the year.)*

**I**
The inner elixir mirrors the outer,
The inner flows free, the outer must likewise flow.
The cinnabar head blends in perfect accord,
Nurtured by twofold action, warm and gentle.
Within, the natural true fire,
In the crucible, blazing and ever red.
The outer furnace’s regulation demands diligence,
For nothing surpasses the wondrous true seed.

**II**
This elixir, most divine and sacred,
Yet your meager share is hard to dissolve.
Harmonize lead and mercury without delay,
Soon you’ll witness the form of the dark pearl.
If a steadfast seeker refines it,
Why not dwell in the marketplace or court?
The work is easy, the medicine not distant—
Revealed, it moves one to laughter.

**III**
The White Tiger’s first classic is a treasure,
The Flowery Pond’s divine water, true gold.
Know then that the highest good’s source runs deep,
Unlike common medicinal substances.
Should you seek to refine the ninefold cycle,
First refine the self and hold fast the heart.
Follow the time to gather, fix the floating and sinking,
Advance the fire, beware of grave peril.

**IV**
Seven returns—cinnabar reverts to its root,
Nine reversions—golden liquid returns to truth.
Do not rely on the *yin* and *zi* to count *kun* and *shen*,
But observe the five phases’ completion as the standard.
It is but a single taste of mercury,
Circulating through all the celestial stems.
When yin and yang’s numbers are fulfilled, it attains the divine,
Entering and exiting without leaving the Mysterious Female.

**V**
The Oxherd and Weaver Girl’s bond accords with the Dao,
Tortoise and Serpent naturally hold their endowments.
The Toad meets the new moon, joining in beauty,
The two qi mutually support and revolve.
All is the marvelous work of heaven and earth—
Who grasps this true essence?
When yin and yang are blocked and divided, it becomes a fault,
How then to attain heaven’s eternity and earth’s permanence?

**VI**
If you would have true lead retain mercury,
Within the family, do not stray from the minister.
Wood and metal, though separated, have no cause to meet—
A matchmaker must be employed to draw them together.
Wood’s nature loves metal’s righteousness,
Metal’s sentiment cherishes wood’s kindness.
They swallow and gulp each other, yet grow intimate,
Only then does the man conceive.

**VII**
Whose is the sixteen-year-old radiant maiden?
Where is the third dragon’s gentleman?
They call themselves Wood’s liquid and Metal’s essence,
Meeting Earth, they form a third lineage.
Further refined by Ding’s forging,
Husband and wife at last unite in joy.
The river chariot dares not pause even briefly,
Conveyed to the summit of Kunlun’s peak.

**VIII**
Heaven and earth have just passed through closure and opening,
From dawn to dusk, know well the *zhun* and *meng*.
Spokes gather at the hub, ever paying homage,
The wonder lies in the art of withdrawal and addition.
Attain the One, and all affairs are complete—
Do not divide north, south, east, or west.
Reduce and reduce again, guard your prior work,
The life-treasure must not be lightly toyed with.

**IX**
At the winter solstice, the yang returns,
Each thirty-day period adds a yang line.
In the moon’s *fu* hexagram, the new moon surpasses the dawn,
After the full moon, the *qian* hexagram ends its omen.
The sun further divides cold and heat,
Yang arises again at midnight.
After noon, one yin departs at dawn—
Refining the elixir, know dusk and dawn.

**X**
If you cannot distinguish the five phases and four images,
How can you tell cinnabar from mercury, lead from silver?
Before you’ve heard of the firing times for the elixir,
You rashly call yourself a great hermit.
Unwilling to reflect on your own errors,
You even teach others your mistaken path.
Leading them astray into eternal delusion,
How can you bear such deceit?

**XI**
Within the male, the female essence resides,
True yin embraces yang’s essence.
When the two blend, the medicine is complete,
Transmuting the hun, ling, po, and shen.
Trust in the single grain of golden elixir—
A serpent swallows it and instantly becomes a dragon.
A chicken consumes it and transforms into a phoenix,
Soaring into the sacred realm of true yang.

**XII**
Virtue’s cultivation surpasses eight hundred,
Hidden merits accumulate to three thousand.
Equalizing self and others, kin and foe,
Only then does one fulfill the immortal’s original vow.
The tiger brother cannot harm you with blades,
The inconstant fire-house cannot entangle you.
After the treasure talisman descends, you ascend to heaven,
Steadily riding the simurgh’s chariot and phoenix’s carriage.

**One Further Lyric**

**(On the Intercalary Month as Symbol)**
The elixir is the supreme treasure of the colored body,
Refined, it transforms endlessly.
Further, on the nature, one investigates the true source,
Mastering the wondrous function of non-arising.
No need to await another life or future rebirth—
In this very moment, attain the Buddha’s divine powers.
Ever since the Dragon Girl achieved this merit,
Who since has been able to follow in her footsteps?

**Five Quatrains**
*(On the Five Phases as Symbol)*

**I**
Though you comprehend the true suchness of nature,
You still must cast off the body and abandon the human form.
Why not also refine the great medicine,
Instantly transcending the leakless to become a true person?

**II**
Rebirth, possession-stealing, and relocation—
The old dwelling is but the fool of cause and effect.
If you master the subduing of the dragon and taming of the tiger,
When will the house of true gold ever wither?

**III**
Mirroring form, closing breath, and contemplating spirit—
At first, the path is arduous; later, it becomes smooth.
Though in an instant you may roam ten thousand lands,
Alas, if the house is broken, you must still move.

**IV**
The Śākya’s teaching urges cultivation of the Land of Bliss,
Only because the Land of Bliss is the golden realm.
For the most part, among forms and appearances, only this is real;
The other two are not true—vainly do they measure.

**V**
Common sayings often speak of uniting with the supreme Dao,
One should seek within it with care.
If you can invert the ordinary in daily use,
All the dust and sand of the great earth become treasures.

**Appendix: Reading the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi***
The wondrous function of the great elixir follows Qian and Kun,
As Qian and Kun move, the Five Phases divide.
When the Five Phases flow forward, the common Dao has arising and ceasing;
When the Five Phases reverse, the elixir’s body is eternally numinous and enduring.
From the first sign in the formless,
The Two Modes arise from the One Root.
The Four Images do not depart from the Two Bodies,
The Eight Trigrams mutually beget as parent and child.
The ten thousand images arise from change and movement,
Fortune and misfortune, regret and remorse—here they divide.
The common people use it daily yet do not know,
The sage alone can fathom its origin.
Thus, the marvelous Dao of the *Yi* exhausts the principles of Qian and Kun,
And so it entrusts its image to this text.
When Pi and Tai alternate, yin and yang now rise, now fall;
When Zhun and Meng arise, movement and stillness are in morning and dusk.
Kan and Li are the male and female, water and fire;
Zhen and Dui are the dragon and tiger, po and hun.
Abiding in the center, the yellow skirt is supremely auspicious;
Encountering Kang, there is no position, no honor.
Having not yet carefully observed the end and beginning of the ten thousand things,
One again meets with Gou, revealing the return of the two qi.
The moon’s waxing and waning correspond to the flourishing and decline of spirit;
The sun’s rising and setting accord with the cold and warmth of construction and defense.
The words were established to clarify the image,
Once the image is grasped, the words are forgotten.
It is like setting up an image to point to the meaning—
When the true meaning is realized, the image is discarded.
Those who understand value simplicity and ease;
Those who are deluded grow ever more confused and entangled.
Thus, the adept who cultivates the true
Should not, in reading the *Cantong Qi*, cling to images or grasp at words.

**Song for Master Liu of White Dragon Cave**
Jade flows, gold flies—the two luminaries rush,
No sooner do flowers bloom than autumn frost arrives.
Vainly do they boast of Peng Zu’s thousand years—
It is but a lightning flash in the clouds.
A lightning flash—how fleeting!
A hundred years amount to thirty thousand days,
During which cold and heat alternately torment,
Unnoticed, the youthful face fades in darkness.
Even with children and grandchildren before your eyes,
Affection and love only deepen the entanglement.
When vitality is exhausted and the body withers,
Who can devise a way to briefly delay?
Briefly delay—yet there is no method,
Inevitably, the body returns to flowing water.
Just look at the sages and worthies of old—
How many have managed to remain in the world?
To remain in the world—there is a way,
Only because people of this age lack the capacity.
They race into the mountains to seek herbs and trees,
To subdue lead and refine mercury, to congeal cinnabar.
To congeal cinnabar—this matter is far removed,
One must seek the crimson blood within Kan.
Seize it, bring it to Li’s position to restrain yin essence,
Blend and harmonize—there is a proper season.
When the season is right, employ the matchmaker:
The Metal Elder and the Alchemical Maiden wed.
The Metal Elder prefers to ride the white tiger,
The Alchemical Maiden always mounts the red dragon’s body.
The tiger comes to sit quietly in the autumn mountains,
The dragon stirs in the depths of the pool.
The two beasts meet and battle,
Waves surge and boil like a cauldron.
The Yellow Dame and Ding the Elder lend their numinous power,
Shaking heaven and earth, startling gods and ghosts.
In an instant, the battle ends, clouds and rain disperse,
A mysterious pearl is planted in the mud.
From this, the root and sprout gradually grow,
Nurtured in season, embracing true essence.
After ten months, the fetus is shed—swallow it,
Unnoticed, the mortal body already possesses numinosity.
This matter—rare in the world,
Not known to ordinary people.
If in past lives you lacked the bone of immortality,
How could you easily encounter it?
Having encountered it—refine it at once,
For the light and shadow press on like an arrow.
To catch the fish, you must cast the net;
Do not merely stand by the river and sigh in vain.
I hear you have known the medicine for many years—
Why not gather your mind and refine mercury and lead?
Do not let the candle be blown out by the wind,
Lest you blame heaven for the six paths of rebirth.
Lately, people in the world are full of deceit,
All donning Daoist robes and calling themselves adepts.
Ask them what metal and wood are—
They fall silent, mute as if afflicted.
Yet they speak of refining qi and fasting,
Claiming other schools and paths are long.
Have you not seen the *Song of Breaking Delusion*?
The method of embracing the true within the Great One is most excellent.
Do not fault my words for being wild and coarse—
It is only because people of this age are hard to discern.
Only when your heart is one with mine
Dare I pour out my thoughts to you.

**Song of Stone Bridge**
My home lies north of Stone Bridge,
Where mountains guard and waters seal, ancient trees stand dense.
Beneath the bridge, the ravine’s waters flow to Kunlun,
Below the mountain, the spring’s drink is fragrant and rich.
My dwelling within the mountains is truly worthy of praise,
Everywhere, I plant the unadorned flower.
North of the mountain, a cave harbors a fierce tiger,
Emerging from its den, it roars, stirring wind and mist.
South of the mountain, the pool’s depths hide a flood dragon,
Rising in clouds, it descends rain, veiling the peaks in haze.
The two beasts meet and battle,
The primal pearl lies hidden—an auspicious sign.
The scene is enviable—I secretly rejoice,
Pouring my own wine, growing pleasantly drunk.
Drunk, I pluck a stringless zither,
Its notes, one by one, teach with care.
Alas, in drunkenness, none understand,
Muddled and silent, as if foolish.
Gazing upward, I observe the marvelous workings of creation—
The sun still sets in the west, the moon still rises in the east.

Heaven is earth, earth is heaven,
Inversion and reversion of yin and yang accord with nature.
Discern where the Five Phases reverse and overturn,
And you shall ascend in rosy clouds to the Grotto-Heaven.

A golden chamber, jade rafters,
Jade maidens and golden lads attend before you day and night.
The Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper are arrayed in clarity,
The myriad phenomena manifest boundlessly.

No day nor night, only ceaseless continuity,
Gathering and dispersing, drawing and adding—fire and timing complete.
Should you ask where the Golden Elixir truly lies,
Seek a master to reveal the lead within the water.

Wood engenders fire, metal engenders water,
Water and fire must distinguish fore and aft ranks.
To discern floating and sinking, know host and guest,
Lead, silver, cinnabar, and mercury then meet in union.

There is firmness and softness—do not grow complacent,
Know contentment, ever content, return to the root.
The myriad spirits all celebrate the era of Great Peace,
When the nation prospers and the people rejoice.

This matter is well worth pondering,
Those of the same Dao know this truth.
Later generations who study the cultivation of reality
Speak only of preserving and nurturing, of circulating qi.
Before your eyes, it seems so easy,
Yet those who attain it are wondrous beyond compare.
First, it banishes illness and extends years,
Then, through firing and refining, transforms the body into yang.

Learners of the Dao, turn your thoughts inward,
Do not inquire of side doors or minor methods.
They know only how to deceive others in the moment,
Unaware that their own bodies wither in obscurity.

I urge later students to be bold and resolute,
Do not idly abandon home to dwell in distant lands.
The wondrous Dao is not apart from your own body,
How could it lie in a thousand mountains or ten thousand streams?

Do not procrastinate, do not indulge in baseness,
Hasten to seek a master and grasp the primordial intent.
If in this life you do not study and cultivate,
Who knows what womb you may enter in the next?

If you have the heart, persevere to the end,
For the great matter of life is none other than birth and death.
If Heaven should betray one of Daoist heart,
I would be consigned to the three evil paths as a lowly ghost.

*Awakening to the True Nature School*
*Four Quatrains*

The Tathāgata’s wondrous body pervades the Ganges’ sands,
The myriad phenomena stand in serried ranks, unobstructed.
When you comprehend the true Dharma-eye of perfect interpenetration,
You will know the three realms are your home.

Gazing, you cannot see its form,
Yet when you call, it responds.
Do not say this sound is like an echo in a valley—
If there were no valley, what sound would there be?

One thing contains hearing, seeing, awareness, and knowing,
For all dust-bound realms reveal its mechanism.
Yet even this wondrous one thing is not truly existent—
On what do the four depend?

Without moving a step, you reach the Western Heaven,
For all directions sit plainly before your eyes.
The light behind your neck is still illusion,
Clouds beneath your feet do not make you immortal.

*Eulogy on the Nature-Ground*

Buddha-nature is neither same nor different,
A thousand lamps share one light.
Add to it—can you truly augment?
Subtract from it—can you truly diminish?
Taking and forsaking both pass without fault,
Burning and drowning cause no harm.
The dharmas of seeing, hearing, knowing, and perceiving—
Not one can be fathomed.

*Eulogy on Arising and Ceasing*

Seeking birth, it is originally unborn,
Fearing cessation, it has never briefly ceased.
Eyes see, yet do not compare to ears hearing,
Mouth speaks, yet how does it rival the nose’s telling?

*Eulogy on the Three Realms as Mind Alone*

The three realms are the wondrous principle of mind alone,
The myriad things are neither this nor that.
Not one thing is not my mind,
Not one thing is my self.

*Eulogy on Seeing the Mind in All Things*

See the thing, and you see the mind,
Without things, the mind does not appear.
Within the ten directions’ passage and obstruction,
The true mind is all-pervading.
If you give rise to intellectual understanding,
You fall into inverted views.
When you behold phenomena without mind,
Only then do you see the bodhi face.

*Eulogy on Equalizing Things*

I am not different from others,
Yet others’ minds differ from mine.
People have near and far,
I have no this or that.
Beasts of land and water, birds in flight—
I regard them as one body.
Noble and base, high and low,
Are like hands and feet to me.
I am not even I,
How could there be a you?
When both this and that are gone,
All bubbles return to water.

*Eulogy on the Mind Here and Now as Buddha*

Buddha is mind, mind is Buddha,
Yet mind and Buddha have always been illusory things.
If you know there is no Buddha and no mind,
Only then is this the Dharmakāya Buddha.

The Dharmakāya Buddha has no form,
A single orb of radiance contains the myriad phenomena.
The formless form is the true form,
The signless sign is the true sign.
Neither form nor emptiness, nor non-emptiness,
Neither movement nor stillness, nor coming nor going.
No difference, no sameness, no being, no non-being,
Hard to grasp, hard to relinquish, hard to hear or hope for.
Within and without, round and bright, everywhere interpenetrating,
One Buddha-land lies within a single grain of sand.
One grain of sand contains the great thousandfold world,
One body and mind are ten thousand in unison.
To know this, you must master the mindless Dharma,
Unstained and unobstructed—this is pure karma.
Good and evil, a thousand kinds, yet nothing is done,
This is the true meaning of *namo* and Mahākāśyapa.

*Eulogy on the Mindless*

How laughable, my mind—
Stubborn and coarse.
Stolid and drifting,
It entrusts things to their own course.
It does not understand cultivation,
Nor does it commit offenses.
It does not benefit others,
Nor does it seek for itself.
It does not uphold precepts,
Nor does it observe taboos.
It knows nothing of rites and music,
Nor does it practice benevolence and righteousness.
Of all human abilities,
It has mastered not one.
When hungry, it eats;
When thirsty, it drinks.
When tired, it sleeps;
When awake, it walks.
When hot, it wears light clothes;
When cold, it covers itself.
Without thought, without worry,
What sorrow? What joy?
No regret, no scheming,
No thought, no intent.
All worldly glory and shame
Are but a travelers’ inn.
Birds roosting in trees and woods
May be likened to this.
Coming, it does not forbid;
Going, it does not stop.
It neither avoids nor seeks,
Neither praises nor blames.
It does not loathe the ugly,
Nor does it admire the beautiful.
It does not hasten to quiet chambers,
Nor does it shun bustling markets.
It does not speak of others’ faults,
Nor does it boast of its own rightness.
It does not favor the noble,
Nor does it slight the lowly.
Loved ones and enemies,
Great and small, inner and outer—
Sorrow and joy, gain and loss,
Reverence and contempt, peril and ease—
The mind does not regard them as two,
But meets all with equanimity.
It does not strive for blessings first,
Nor does it initiate calamity.
It responds only when moved,
And rises again when pressed.
It does not fear blades,
How could it fear tigers?
It follows things in their naming,
Why cling to labels?
The eye does not pursue forms,
Sounds do not enter the ear.
All that has appearance
Is but delusion and falsehood.
Male and female forms and voices
Are not fixed entities.
Forms and appearances are mindless,
Unstained and unobstructed.
Free and at ease,
Nothing can burden it.

The wondrous awakening shines perfectly, illuminating both within and without.
It envelops the six directions, without near or far.
This light is not light—like the moon reflected in water.
To grasp or reject it is difficult; what comparison could suffice?
Understanding this wondrous function, one transcends all bounds.

Someone asked of its essence—it is only this.

**Heart Sutra Verse**
The aggregates, truths, senses, and objects—form and emptiness—
None of these dharmas can be spoken.
Deluded views are wholly extinguished,
The quiescent essence abides thus.

**Verse on Sin and Merit**
All day walking, yet never walked.
All day sitting, yet never sat.
Cultivating goodness brings no merit,
Committing evil incurs no sin.
If one has not yet awakened to the mind,
Do not cling to these words and act recklessly.
After death, you must face King Yama—
How can you escape the cauldrons, pestles, and mills?

**Verse on Perfect Penetration**
Seeing true emptiness, emptiness is not empty;
Where is perfect clarity not all-pervading?
Senses, objects, mind, and dharmas—all are without substance.
Only in wondrous function do we know their unity with things.

**Verse on Following Conditions**
The myriad things lie before you,
Following their movement or stillness, wielding their power.
Perfect clarity, concentration, and wisdom remain unstained—
Like water-born lotuses, dry of themselves.

**Precious Moon Verse**
A single bright moon hangs in the empty sky,
Its pure light illumines all lands without obstruction.
Gather it, yet it does not accumulate; strike it, yet it does not disperse.
Advance, yet it does not proceed; retreat, yet it does not recede.
That is not distant, this is not near;
Outer is not external, inner is not within.
Within sameness there is difference, within difference there is sameness—
Tell me, can the marionette understand this?

**Song of the Pearl**
The poor man’s pearl in his robe,
Originally perfect and luminous.
Not knowing to seek it himself,
He counts the treasures of others.
Counting others’ treasures brings no benefit,
Only teaching you to waste effort in vain.
Better to recognize your own jewel—
Worth countless millions in gold.
This precious pearl shines most brightly,
Illumining the three-thousandfold great-thousand worlds.
Never has it lacked even a fraction,
Yet it is obscured by floating clouds.
Since recognizing this mani-pearl,
Who still cherishes bubbles, illusions, or flowers?
The Buddha’s pearl and my pearl are one;
My nature returns to the Buddha-nature sea.
Pearl is not pearl, sea is not sea—
The mind’s vastness effortlessly contains the Dharma-realm.
Let the clamorous dust fill your eyes,
Perfect concentration and wisdom remain ever at ease.
Not emptiness, not form—
Within and without, radiantly unobstructed.
The six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,
Self-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?
Seeing is completion; all affairs are finished.
Abandoning learning, acting without effort, passing the days.
Still as an unborn infant,
Movement and rest follow conditions without fixation.
Not cutting off delusion, not cultivating truth—
The mind of truth and delusion is but dust.
From the beginning, all dharmas are without form;
Within formlessness, there is the Dharma-body.
The Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha—
Neither human nor thing.
Vastly filling heaven and earth,
It is only subtlety, indistinctness, and vagueness.
Stains do not defile it; its light shines of itself.
No dharma does not arise from the mind.
If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—
Thus we know sin and merit are originally formless.
No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—
The wise vision of a true person naturally differs.
Speaking, it roars like a lion,
Not like the wild fox debating birth and extinction.

**Song Pointing to Chan Delusion**
The Tathāgata’s Chan-nature is like water:
When the body is still, wind and waves cease of themselves.
In movement and rest, it remains serene and clear—
Not only when sitting is it thus.
People today seek realization through silent sitting,
Not knowing it lies entirely in seeing the nature.
If the nature is clear within seeing,
Seeing itself settles within the nature.
When concentration matures, wisdom’s function is boundless—
This is called the supernatural powers of all Buddhas.
If one seeks to fathom its essence and function,
One sees only the emptiness of the ten directions.
Within emptiness, not a single thing exists,
Nor subtlety, indistinctness, or vagueness.
Seeking these elusive qualities,
One errs and loses the way.
Yet even these two words—erring and losing—
Cannot be grasped as evidence.
The original mind is itself empty space—
How could gain or loss ever touch it?
Simply cast aside all dharmas,
Leaving nothing remaining.
Suddenly, perfect clarity manifests—
Then you are no different from the Buddhas.
The physical body is my fetter;
For now, blend with the light and mingle with the world.
In all actions, be without mind—
Why contend over right and wrong, honor and disgrace?
This life is but a temporary abode;
The host of the inn is Vairocana.
Vairocana neither comes nor goes—
Thus we know birth and extinction are without residue.
If asked what Vairocana is like,
It is only that which has form that is not it.
Before your eyes, dusts and karmas abound—
Dusts and karmas are neither the same nor different.
Seeing these dusts and karmas,
Each is Śākyamuni, each is Kāśyapa.
If they differ, the myriad sounds all resound;
If they are the same, a single wind gathers all.
To recognize the mani-pearl,
Do not say you must attain the Dharma to know it.
When ill, use medicine to cure it;
Once healed, what need is there for medicine?
When the mind is deluded, borrow the Dharma to illuminate it;
When the mind awakens, the Dharma is no longer needed.
Like a tarnished mirror polished—
Stains and grime naturally vanish.
All dharmas are fundamentally false,
Thus we are taught to leave all forms behind.
When all forms are left behind, what remains?
This is called the supreme, true reality.
If you wish to adorn the Buddha-land,
Practice equality, compassion, and relief of suffering.
Though the bodhisattva’s original vow is profound,
Do not grasp at existence within forms.
This is the perfect union of merit and wisdom—
In the future, you will receive prediction first.
The slightest dust of permanence or annihilation brings defilement—
Then you have no affinity with the Buddhas.
Turning the thoughts of deluded sentient beings,
All are stained by the habits of dust and desire.
Only because of excessive attachment to emotions
Do they constantly take birth in wombs, eggs, transformation, or moisture.
To learn the Way, you must be fiercely resolute,
Your heart of non-emotion hard as iron.
Even if you have children, wives, and concubines,
What difference is there between them and others?
Always guard a single sphere of light,
Seeing no objects of desire to contemplate.
All dharmas are instantly unattached—
What need is there to speak of hell or heaven?
Then my life is in my own hands,
In emptiness, neither ascending nor descending.
Appearing and disappearing in the Buddha-lands,
Never leaving the original seat of bodhi.
The thirty-two transformations of Avalokiteśvara—
I too shall realize them within.
Manifestations beyond conception
All arise from the nature of freedom.
Not empty, not form—
Within and without, radiantly unobstructed.
The six supernatural powers are wondrously boundless,
Self-benefiting and benefiting others—how could they be exhausted?
Seeing is completion; all affairs are finished.
Abandoning learning, acting without effort, passing the days.
Still as an unborn infant,
Movement and rest follow conditions without fixation.
Not cutting off delusion, not cultivating truth—
The mind of truth and delusion is but dust.
From the beginning, all dharmas are without form;
Within formlessness, there is the Dharma-body.
The Dharma-body is the natural, true Buddha—
Neither human nor thing.
Vastly filling heaven and earth,
It is only subtlety, indistinctness, and vagueness.
Stains do not defile it; its light shines of itself.
No dharma does not arise from the mind.
If the mind does not arise, dharmas naturally cease—
Thus we know sin and merit are originally formless.
No Buddha to cultivate, no Dharma to expound—
The wise vision of a true person naturally differs.
Speaking, it roars like a lion,
Not like the wild fox debating birth and extinction.

I am a Chan practitioner of no-mind,
In all matters, making no distinctions.
Once a black ox,
Today wholly white.
Sometimes I sing and laugh alone,
Others say I lack sense.
How would they know that beneath this coarse robe,
Lies a priceless treasure?

Should you see me speak of emptiness,
It would be like swallowing a date whole.
This Dharma only Buddhas can know—
How could the deluded grasp its surface?

There are also those who study Chan,
Merely learning to spar with words and lips.
They boast of my quick replies,
Yet do not recognize the true host.
This is but gleaning branches and leaves,
Failing to fathom the root.
With the root, branches and leaves flourish;
Without the root, they cannot endure.

Some flaunt their grasp of the luminous pearl,
Yet remain entangled in self and other.
Compared to my wondrous awakening at the source,
They are as distant as a thousand miles.
Such people are pitiable and laughable,
Having spent years studying the Dao in vain.
Too proud to seek guidance,
They waste their lives in futility.

This stems from dull roots and heavy karmic delusion.
If they fail to awaken in this life,
How will they escape sinking in the next?

*Reading the Song of Ancestral Courage from Chan Master Xuedou’s Collection*

A single stream from Caoxi divides into a thousand branches,
Reflecting past and present without hindrance.
Yet recent scholars do not trace the source,
Mistaking a hoofprint’s puddle for the great ocean.

Master Xuedou grasped the true essence,
Striking the Dharma drum with thunderous roars.
The lion king emerges from its den with a mighty roar,
All beasts and demons tremble in fear.

Sometimes in song, sometimes in verse,
He earnestly points the way for the lost.
His words are bold, his meaning profound,
Striking jade and ringing gold through the ages.

Alas, the deluded cling to appearances,
Chasing after words and counting names.
The true suchness of the Dharma is beyond speech,
Neither low nor high, without bounds.
Neither form nor emptiness, nor duality—
The ten directions’ dust and realms are one perfect circle.

True samadhi makes no distinction between speech and silence,
Neither grasped nor abandoned.
Simply not clinging to any appearance—
This is the true conduct of the Tathagata.

To dispel delusion, one opposes it with truth,
Yet if delusion does not arise, truth also fades.
Only when both truth and delusion are seen as non-dual,
Does the true mind become unobstructed.

Unobstructed, one attains freedom—
A single awakening dissolves eons of transgressions.
Without effort, one realizes bodhi,
Henceforth forever liberated from the sea of birth and death.

My teacher’s words flow freely of late,
Leaving a model for the world.
Last night, I summoned him,
Pierced his nostrils and hung him on a staff.
When asked about the supreme truth,
He replied, “All speech is slander.”

**On Precepts, Samadhi, and Wisdom**

Precepts, samadhi, and wisdom
Are the wondrous functions within the Dharma.
Though Buddhas and ancestors have spoken of them,
The unenlightened cling to their words.

Now, briefly expounded to aid awakening:
When mind and environment are both forgotten, and not a single thought arises—this is precepts.
When awareness is perfectly luminous, inwardly and outwardly radiant—this is samadhi.
When responding to conditions, with inexhaustible marvelous function—this is wisdom.
These three depend on one another, each both substance and function.
They are never apart, even for an instant.

Like the sun relying on light to illuminate,
And light relying on illumination to shine—
Without light, there is no illumination;
Without illumination, there is no shining.
At their root, precepts, samadhi, and wisdom are one nature;
Light, illumination, and shining are one sun.
If even the one is not truly one,
How can the three be three?
When both three and one are forgotten,
There is only profound clarity and purity.

**Twelve Lyrics to the Tune of "Moon over the West River"**

Illusions need not be forcibly extinguished,
Nor truth sought with desperate longing.
The original source and self-nature—Buddha’s cultivation is one;
Delusion and awakening are not bound by before or after.

Awakening—Buddha is realized in an instant;
Delusion—one drifts for ten thousand kalpas.
If but a single thought aligns with true cultivation,
All sins as countless as the Ganges’ sands are wiped away.

It is inherently neither birth nor extinction,
Yet one clings to distinctions of arising and ceasing.
Even sin and merit have no root—
How could the wondrous essence ever increase or diminish?

I possess a luminous mirror,
Long obscured by dust and dimness.
Today, polished to brilliance, it illumines heaven and earth—
Ten thousand images stand revealed, none can hide.

My nature enters the nature of all Buddhas,
And the nature of Buddhas everywhere is thus.
Like the cold moon’s reflection in a cold spring,
One moon appears in a thousand pools.

Small as an invisible hair’s tip,
Vast as the filling of the three thousand worlds.
High or low, it naturally conforms to square or round—
Why speak of long or short, deep or shallow?

Dharma after dharma—originally no dharma;
Emptiness after emptiness—yet not emptiness.
Stillness and clamor, speech and silence—all are fundamentally the same;
Why labor to explain dreams within dreams?

In use, there is no use;
In effortless effort, effort is applied.
Like a fruit ripening naturally red—
Ask not how it was cultivated or sown.

Good and evil forgotten in an instant,
Glory and decay no longer concern the heart.
Darkness and light, concealment and display—let them drift as they will;
Eat when hungry, drink when thirsty, as one’s portion allows.

The spirit serene, profoundly still—
Yet one may sit, lie, sing, or chant without hindrance.
A pool of autumn water, deep and clear as jade—
Though wind stirs, be not startled; let it be.

Facing circumstances, no need to forcibly extinguish;
Provisional names are but skillful means for bodhi.
Form and emptiness, brightness and darkness—originally equal;
Truth and illusion need not be divided into two.

Awakening is the Pure Land at once—
No need for distant India or Cao Creek.
Who says the Land of Ultimate Bliss lies in the western heavens?
When realized, Amitābha manifests in the world.

Self and others, sentient beings and lifespan—
Why distinguish high or low, near or far?
The Dharma illumines all without exception;
Thought after thought, no need to seek.

Seeing—what has ever truly seen?
Hearing—what was never heard?
All functions arise without mutual knowledge—
Who can obstruct you in life or death?

Clinging to forms while practicing generosity,
Its karmic reward remains within the realms of gods and humans.
Like shooting an arrow upward at floating clouds—
It falls only when its force is spent.

How much better to embody the true mark of non-action,
Returning to the source, reverting to simplicity and purity.
Forgetting circumstances, exhausting passions—let nature take its course,
To realize the forbearance of the unborn Dharma.

When fish and rabbit are in hand,
The trap and snare are naturally forgotten.
The raft for crossing the river, the ladder for ascending the sky—
Once arrived, all are cast aside.

Before awakening, one relies on words;
Upon awakening, words become false.
Though these four lines speak of non-action,
Even these must be transcended.

Awakened, seek not quiescent extinction—
Follow conditions and guide the deluded.
Cutting off eternalism and annihilationism, offering guidance—
Skillful means point to the ultimate reality.

The five eyes, three bodies, four wisdoms,
Six perfections, myriad practices—all cultivated in harmony.
A single perfect radiance, a flawless mani jewel,
Benefiting others while sustaining oneself.

I see people today speak of nature,
Boasting with glib tongues, quick to respond.
Yet when confronted with circumstances, they grow confused—
How are they different from the foolish?

What is spoken must be practiced;
Only then is speech and action without flaw.
Wielding the sword of wisdom to sever the mani—
This is called the Tathāgata’s true wisdom.

To realize the wondrous Dao of the unborn,
Nothing but seeing one’s true mind.
The true body is without form or sound—
Only the pure Dharma-body remains thus.

This Dao is neither non-existent nor existent,
Nor is it to be sought in the middle.
Abandoning both extremes and the center—
Seeing this is called the supreme grade.

**Postscript**

I observe that human life arises from deluded emotions, giving rise to this body.
With this body comes suffering;
If there were no body, whence would suffering arise?

To escape suffering,
Nothing surpasses embodying the supreme Dao.
To embody the supreme Dao,
Nothing surpasses illuminating the original mind.

Thus, the mind is the essence of the Dao,
And the Dao is the function of the mind.
If one can examine the mind and observe nature,
The luminous essence manifests naturally,
And the effortless function arises spontaneously.
Without applying contrived effort, one instantly transcends to the other shore.

If not for the mind-mirror shining brightly,
The divine pearl resplendent and clear,
How could all appearances instantly dissolve,
Not a speck of dust adhere,
The mind’s source be free,
And the certainty of the unborn be attained?

Those who illuminate the mind and embody the Dao
Are not burdened by the body,
Nor disturbed by circumstances.
How could blades or weapons harm them?
How could tigers or rhinoceroses endanger them?
How could great fires or floods cause concern?

The awakened one’s mind, like a mirror reflecting circumstances,
Discerns without grasping.
Responding to conditions, harmonizing without leading—
Thus, they overcome phenomena without injury.
This is the wondrous Dao of the supreme, utmost truth.

Originally, the Dao has no name—
The sage forcibly named it.
Originally, the Dao has no words—
The sage forcibly spoke of it.

Yet if names and words were silenced,
Later generations would have no means to recognize its essence and return to truth.
Thus, the sage established teachings and set forth words to reveal the Dao.
The Dao is revealed through words,
And words are forgotten in the Dao.

Alas, this Dao is most wondrous and subtle,
Yet the world’s people, dull in root-nature,
Cling to their bodies, loathe death, and delight in life—
Thus, they ultimately struggle to awaken.

The Yellow Emperor and Laozi, pitying their attachments,
Used the art of cultivating life,
Following their desires to gradually guide them.
The essence of cultivating life lies in the golden elixir,
And the essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water and flower pool.
Thus, the teachings of the *Dao De Jing* and *Yin Fu Jing* flourished in the world,
For people delight in life.

Yet their words are veiled and their principles profound.
Though scholars recite their texts,
None grasp their meaning.
Without encountering a true master to transmit the oral instructions,
Even with a hundred conjectures,
One can never apply the work or accomplish the task.
Is this not why seekers are as numerous as ox hairs,
While those who attain are as rare as qilin horns?

In the *jiyou* year, I met my teacher in Chengdu,
Who transmitted the elixir method to me.
Since then, three transmissions to unworthy recipients,
Three encounters with calamities—
Each lasting no more than twenty days.
Recently, I recalled my teacher’s admonition:
“One day, if someone comes to loosen your bonds and remove your shackles,
You must transmit it to them.
All others are not permitted.”

"Afterward, desiring to absolve myself from the ledger of names, yet fearing that later generations would not trust this Dao, I composed the *Wuzhen Pian*, setting forth the origins and completion of the elixir method. Once it was published, seekers flocked in throngs. Seeing their earnestness, I could not bear to refuse, and so I selected from among them to transmit the teachings. Yet those to whom I transmitted were none of great influence or mighty power, none capable of upholding peril or rescuing the drowning, none magnanimous and exceptional, none benevolent and enlightened in the Dao.

At first, I suffered calamities once, then twice, yet my heart remained unenlightened. Only upon the third did I awaken to my past errors. Thus I know the Great Elixir’s method is most simple and most easy—even the dull and ignorant, if they practice it, may instantly ascend to the realm of sages. This is why Heaven guards it in secrecy, forbidding its careless transmission to the unworthy.

Yet I, Boduan, disobeyed my teacher’s words, repeatedly leaking Heaven’s mysteries. Because I possess a body, I have each time borne Heaven’s reproof and suffering. So profound and swift is Heaven’s admonition—how dare I not tremble with fear and reproach myself? From this day forward, I shall seal my lips and bind my tongue. Though cauldrons and boiling oil stand before me, though blades press upon my neck, never again shall I dare speak of it."

Within this *Waking to Reality* are sung the subtle principles of the Great Elixir, its medicinal substances, and the firing times—all set forth in exhaustive detail. Should some devoted seeker, long possessing the bone of immortality, peruse these verses, their wisdom and discernment will naturally awaken, enabling them to trace the text and fathom its meaning. What need have they for this Boduan’s humble oral instruction? In such a case, the transmission is Heaven’s gift, not Boduan’s presumptuous imparting.

As for the hymns at the work’s close, which discourse upon seeing one’s nature—these are none other than the supreme, wondrously awakened Dao spoken of above. Yet the Dao of non-action takes the salvation of beings as its first priority; though its secrets be revealed, no fault can ultimately attach to it. Alas, common folk differ in the depth of their karmic conditions and the sharpness of their innate faculties. Even should they hear a single note, they will scatter into divergent views. Thus the Dharma treasures expounded by Śākyamuni and Mañjuśrī are nothing but the One Vehicle, yet as listeners comprehend according to their capacity, they naturally form the distinctions of the Three Vehicles.

Hereafter, should any person of keen and swift faculties encounter this work, they will recognize that Boduan has received the supreme, wondrous essence of the One Vehicle from Bodhidharma and the Sixth Patriarch. For such a one, a single word may awaken them to the ten thousand dharmas. If, however, residual habitual tendencies remain, they will revert to middling or inferior views—yet this is no fault of Boduan’s.

Written on the day *wuyin* in mid-summer of the year *wuwu*, the first of the Yuanfeng era, by Zhang Boduan Pingshu. Second preface.
