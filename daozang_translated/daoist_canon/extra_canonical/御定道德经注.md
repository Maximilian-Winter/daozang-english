The Imperial Preface to the *Daoist Classic* in the *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*

We have heard that the Dao existed before Heaven and Earth, serving as the origin of the myriad things. Its ceaseless transformations defy all naming. Only the perfected person embodies the Dao within, and thus their virtue becomes the profound virtue, their words the sagely words. Laozi’s Dao pervades Heaven and humanity, his virtue transcends all categories. His book of over five thousand words elucidates the principles of purity, stillness, and non-action. Yet its profound relevance to the self and the mind, its clarity on human relations and things, are seldom truly understood in the world.

We once observed his admonition to Confucius: *"As a child, do not act for oneself; as a minister, do not act for oneself."* And when Confucius answered Zengzi’s inquiry on ritual, he repeatedly said, *"I heard this from Lao Dan."* Is this not because when one attains purity and stillness through non-action, loyalty and filial piety arise spontaneously, and ritual and music harmonize all under Heaven? The praise of Laozi as *"like a dragon"* is indeed well-founded.

Since the time of Heshang Gong, commentators have been numerous. Some interpret the text as alchemy, others as stratagem—these are but shallow insights groping at the sage’s meaning, missing it entirely. The annotations of the Kaiyuan and Hongwu eras, though each offers insights, do not fully illuminate the text’s entirety. We recognize that the sagely words are profound and distant, while later scholarship has branched into many paths. Without grounding in principle, errors will only multiply. Thus, We have extensively consulted various interpretations, pruning the superfluous and discarding the extraneous, compiling a single annotation. In principle, We have sought simplicity and clarity; in phrasing, concision and fluency. Whether this aligns with the original intent of the text remains uncertain. Yet Laozi’s work was never about empty nihilism or annihilation, nor was it mere discourse on stratagems or numerology. This annotation, in addressing the principles of daily conduct, the cultivation of the mind, and the governance of the state, may not diverge entirely from the original path. Thus, We inscribe this preface at the beginning to clarify the great principles.

In the thirteenth year of the Shunzhi reign, cyclical year bingshen, first day of the mid-spring month, preface inscribed.

*Imperially Authorized Annotations on the Dao De Jing*
**Daoist School**
*Abstract*

Your ministers respectfully note: The *Dao De Jing* in two scrolls was reverently compiled in the thirteenth year of the Shunzhi reign by Grand Secretary Cheng Kegong, who, upon receiving the *Imperially Composed Preface*, elucidated that this work is fundamentally neither a doctrine of emptiness and annihilation nor a discourse on stratagems and numerology. The annotations therein comprehensively expound upon the principles of daily conduct, the cultivation of the mind, and the governance of the state, such that the hidden dragon’s path shines forth with luminous clarity.

Since the time of Master Heshang and thereafter, those who have annotated and recorded this text number over eighty, amassing more than three hundred scrolls. Among them, some have provided exegeses, others commentaries; some have furnished phonetic glosses, others parsed its chapters and verses; some have composed genealogies, others transmitted its teachings. These annotators include eminent officials such as Yang Hu and Su Zhe, renowned scholars like Wang Bi and Wang Su, reclusive worthies such as Yan Zun, Sun Deng, Tao Hongjing, Dai Kui, and Huangfu Mi, as well as Daoist adepts like Ge Hong and Du Guangting. Many have offered profound insights, while emperors such as Liang Wudi, Tang Minghuang, Song Huizong, and the Hongwu Emperor of Ming have each contributed their own annotations. Though their interpretations vary in depth and shallowness according to their individual understanding, none have fully captured the original intent of Lao Dan, lingering instead between divergence and convergence, revelation and obscurity.

The present annotation, however, draws from the essence of these many sources, distilling them into a concise and lucid exposition. It truly suffices to enrich the mind and broaden the principles of governance, transcending mere inquiry into the doctrine of purity and non-action.

Respectfully submitted for imperial review in the eighth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.

**Chapter One**
The Dao that can be spoken is not the constant Dao.【The first "Dao" refers to the Dao of conduct—what can be enacted. The "constant Dao" is the true, unchanging Dao.】
The name that can be named is not the constant name.【The first "name" refers to the name of discourse—what can be articulated. The "constant name" is the name of the constant Dao.】
The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.【The nameless is the Dao, by which Heaven and Earth are born.】
The named is the mother of the myriad things.【The named is what the Dao generates, by which the myriad things are transformed and born.】
Thus, in constant non-desire, observe its mystery.【"Constant non-" follows the Dao’s non-being. "Observe" means to examine. "Mystery" refers to the Dao’s subtle essence.】
In constant desire, observe its boundaries.【"Constant having" follows the Dao’s being. "Boundaries" refer to the Dao’s limits.】
These two emerge together yet bear different names.【"These two" refer to being and non-being. They emerge from the Dao yet differ in name according to time.】
Together they are called the Profound.【All things distant and boundless in color must be profound; thus, the character "profound" depicts the Dao’s ineffability.】
Profound and ever more profound—the gateway of all mysteries.【Profoundity is already ultimate; profound and ever more profound renders even "profound" insufficient to name it. Thus, it is the source from which all mysteries emerge. All the Dao under Heaven that can be enacted is not the true, constant Dao. All names under Heaven that can be articulated are not the names of the constant Dao. Therefore, the nameless Dao is formless and undifferentiated, and Heaven and Earth begin here. As for the named, it nurtures endlessly, and the myriad things are born from it. The Dao’s being and non-being encompass all thus. Those who attain the Dao inwardly observe their mind, and the mind is without mind; outwardly observe their form, and the form is without form—this is called "constant non-." It is the desire to examine the Dao’s subtle essence. As for applying it to the Five Constants and enacting it in the hundred practices, nothing exists without it at all times—this is called "constant having." It is the desire to examine the Dao’s boundaries. Yet being and non-being are not two distinct things; they emerge together from the natural Dao yet differ in name according to time. Some in the world take being as the Dao, some take non-being as the Dao, some take neither being nor non-being as the Dao, and some take both being and non-being as the Dao. All cling to distinctions and fail to grasp the fusion of being and non-being.】

【Only when being and non-being fuse is it called the Profound. Yet even the Profound is insufficient to exhaust it; profound and ever more profound, it is the source from which all mysteries emerge, and no Dao under Heaven surpasses it.】

**Chapter Two**
When all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness arises.【True beauty is unknowable. When all know beauty as beauty, it is no longer beauty.】
When all know goodness as goodness, non-goodness arises.【True goodness is unknowable. When all know goodness as goodness, it is no longer goodness.】
Thus, being and non-being give rise to one another.【All things under Heaven are born from being; being is born from non-being.】
Difficulty and ease complete one another.【What is deemed difficult becomes easy; what is deemed easy becomes difficult.】
Long and short shape one another.【Only with long is short seen; only with short is long seen.】
High and low incline toward one another.【The low look up to the high; the high return to the low.】
Sounds harmonize with one another.【This sings, and that responds; that sings, and this responds.】
Front and back follow one another.【One deems oneself ahead, yet is there not one ahead of me? Then I am behind. One deems oneself behind, yet is there not one behind me? Then I am ahead.】
Therefore, the sage abides in non-action and attends to affairs without interference.【Abiding in the constant Dao, affairs are managed through non-action.】
He practices the teaching without words.【Abiding in the constant name, teaching is conveyed without speech.】
The myriad things arise yet he does not refuse them.【"Arise" means to move. "Does not refuse" means neither refusing nor forbidding.】
He gives life yet does not possess.【"Does not possess" means not claiming virtue as one’s own.】
He acts yet does not rely.【"Does not rely" means not depending on one’s abilities.】
He accomplishes yet does not dwell.【"Does not dwell" means not claiming achievement as one’s own.】
Only because he does not dwell does he not depart.【"Does not depart" means things cannot leave him. The five thousand words of Laozi can ascend to the subtle and descend to the manifest. Through them, one seeks the Dao and attains the Dao; through them, one governs the state and the state is governed; through them, one cultivates the self and the self is at peace. His words on the constant Dao apply to these three. This chapter speaks of the matters of human nature and emotion. What people call beauty and goodness arise from emotion; what pleases emotion is deemed beautiful, yet it may not be truly beautiful; what pleases emotion is deemed good, yet it may not be truly good. Why is this? Emotion causes it. Human nature is largely the same, yet emotions differ. With differing emotions externally affected by things, likes and dislikes become entangled. Without a guiding principle, all know beauty as beauty yet do not realize that the name of ugliness arises from beauty; all know goodness as goodness yet do not realize that the name of non-goodness arises from goodness. No thing under Heaven lacks its opposite: being and non-being give rise to one another, difficulty and ease complete one another, long and short shape one another, high and low incline toward one another, sounds harmonize, and front and back follow one another—where there is one, there is not the absence of the other. The sage, knowing this, seeks to restore nature and must transform emotion. Thus, he embodies the natural Dao, engaging in non-action and practicing the teaching without words. What is beautiful is indeed beautiful, yet the ugly is also transformed into beauty; what is good is indeed good, yet the non-good is also transformed into goodness. Thus, in application, nothing is discarded; in teaching, no one is abandoned. The myriad things each follow their nature as if they had never been compelled. Therefore, the myriad things arise together, and I arise with them, yet do not refuse them; the myriad things live together, and I live with them, yet do not possess them. When I act, it is not my action but simply following things. Thus, I act yet do not rely. When I achieve, it is not my achievement but merely responding to things. Thus, I accomplish yet do not dwell. Only by not dwelling do the myriad things look up to him as to Heaven and Earth and cherish him as a father and mother, with no thought of leaving him.】

】Chapter Three
Not exalting the worthy prevents the people from contending.
[For if the worthy are exalted, the people will feel shame at not equaling them and so come to contend.]
Not prizing rare goods prevents the people from stealing.
[For if rare goods are prized, the people will suffer from lack and so come to steal.]
Not displaying what may be desired keeps the heart from confusion.
[Desires such as exalting the worthy and prizing goods—all contention and theft arise from seeing what may be desired.]

Thus, in the governance of the sage:
He empties their hearts and fills their bellies.
[Removing cravings, the heart remains empty; desires are exhausted, principle returns, and the belly is full.]
He weakens their ambitions and strengthens their bones.
[Harmonizing and restraining ambition, keeping it ever weak, so that without desire one naturally becomes firm and the bones strong.]

He constantly keeps the people without knowledge and without desire, so that those with knowledge dare not act.
[He constantly leads the people to set aside cleverness and sever cravings; even those with knowledge dare not undertake anything.]

Acting through non-action, there is nothing that is not well governed.
[When governance reaches the point of non-action, the world is without disorder.

The sage sees that knowing beauty gives rise to ugliness, knowing goodness gives rise to its opposite, and so does not dare to awaken knowledge in the world. As for the worthy, it is not that he discards and does not employ them, but rather that he does not boastfully exalt them to provoke the people’s competitive hearts—thus the people return to their natural state and do not contend. As for goods, it is not that he abandons and does not gather them, but rather that he does not prize them to provoke the people’s greedy and thieving impulses—thus the people rest in simplicity and do not steal.

The ardent knight pursues fame; the greedy man pursues wealth—disorder arises from these. Now, if the worthy are not exalted, then the desirability of fame is not seen; if goods are not prized, then the desirability of profit is not seen, and the heart is not deluded and confused.

Thus, in the sage’s governance, he keeps the heart ever empty and the belly naturally full—for through clarity and stillness, the Dao comes to gather. He keeps ambition ever weak and the bones naturally strong—for through desirelessness, one becomes firm of itself.

If the people live with desires and without knowledge, that is all. The sage only does not awaken their boundless knowledge, and so does not guide their endless desires. The people all return to floating simplicity and embrace the uncarved; even those with knowledge dare not undertake anything—thus the world all returns to non-action, and there is nothing that is not well governed.

How, then, does one bring the people to this state of no desire and no knowledge? It is simply that the sage himself maintains that he has never had knowledge and has never seen anything in the world that may be desired.】

Chapter Four

The Dao is empty, yet its use is never exhausted—
[The Dao originally has no name, thus it is empty and becomes the gate of all wonders; its use is inexhaustible, and none can fill its measure.]
Abysmal, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things—
[The abyss is the deepest place; the Dao is the mother of the myriad things, thus called their ancestor.]
It blunts their sharpness,
[When the mind extends outward and enters things, it becomes sharp—thus it must be blunted.]
Untangles their tangles,
[When things enter and entangle the mind, it becomes tangled—thus it must be untangled.]
Softens their brilliance,
[The brightness of its original nature is softened so it does not dazzle.]
Mingles with their dust,
[The杂 of the common folk is mingled with so it is not set apart.]
Deep and clear, it seems to endure—
[Profoundly clear, as if something abides there.]
I do not know whose child it is—it seems to precede the Lord of Creation.
[I do not know from whence the Dao arises—does it not seem to exist before the Lord? The Lord is the master who gives life to things.]

[The Way of non-action is fundamentally utterly empty, yet when applied to the manifold of existence, even the vastness of heaven and earth and the breadth of people and things cannot exceed its reach. The more it is used, the more inexhaustible it becomes. Things may be full, but the Dao is never full; things arise from the Dao, yet the Dao is never a thing. Abysmal indeed—it seems the ancestor of the myriad things.

All people possess the Dao, yet only the sage can preserve it whole. How is it preserved? By blunting its sharpness, lest it fall into delusion; by untangling its tangles, lest it become entangled with things. Not falling into delusion and not becoming entangled with things, defilement is removed and brilliance arises. Yet if one were to display this brilliance, it would be to set oneself apart from others with intention. Thus, one softens its brilliance, allowing the purest light to respond to the most杂 dust without any lack of use—how could the Dao abandon the myriad things?

Only when the Dao is thus preserved does it remain profoundly clear and ever-abiding. Though it abides, people do not recognize it, hence it is said to "seem to endure." Though the Dao abides, it ultimately cannot be named, hence it is said, "I do not know whose child it is." Yet it cannot be said to be nothing—thus it is said, "Does it not seem to precede the Lord?" The Lord is the master who gives life to things, with all transformations following after. Yet the Dao precedes even the Lord—then none can precede it.]

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent, treating the myriad things as straw dogs. The sage is not benevolent, treating the hundred clans as straw dogs. [Straw dogs are figures woven from grass, used in sacrifices and discarded once the ritual is complete—thus they are things utterly devoid of intentionality.]

Between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? [The bellows is the instrument used in smelting to produce wind. The *tuo* is the outer casing that receives the *yue*; the *yue* is the inner pipe that stirs the *tuo*.] Though empty, it does not collapse; though in motion, it yields ever more. [Only because it is hollow and never exhausted does its movement produce such wondrous extension.]

Much speech leads to frequent exhaustion—better to guard the center. [The center means neither leaning nor bias, which is to say, the Dao.]

[The Dao precedes even the Lord, yet its origin remains unknown. Thus, the sage practices non-action and nothing is left untended; achievements are accomplished yet not dwelt upon—how could one harbor the slightest thought, saying, "I am benevolent toward the hundred clans"? Heaven and Earth embody this Dao: in giving life to things, they do so by not giving life. The sage embodies this Dao: in governing the world, they do so by not governing. Why? The myriad things share the same body as Heaven and Earth; the hundred clans share the same body as the sage. Heaven and Earth, the sage—within, they do not perceive a heart capable of benevolence; without, they do not perceive things to be the objects of benevolence. Regarding themselves as straw dogs, how then do they regard the myriad things and the hundred clans? No differently.

Only by not considering themselves benevolent does their benevolence become boundless. Thus, between Heaven and Earth, is it not like a bellows? Only because it is empty yet uncollapsed does its movement yield ever more. Those who embody this Dao practice non-action, and in speech, too, there is nothing to be said—this is already evident. Utterances arise from sound, yet what gives rise to these words cannot itself be spoken. None are exempt from this truth, yet people often rely on speech and thus reach exhaustion. This is because their hearts lean toward being or non-being, cling to grasping or relinquishing, and fail to accord with the Dao. Only by neither leaning toward being nor non-being, neither clinging to grasping nor relinquishing, and thus according with the Dao—this is called guarding the center. Therefore, much speech leads to frequent exhaustion; better to guard the center, which knows no exhaustion.]

The Valley Spirit never dies—this is called the Mysterious Female.
【The valley is used as a metaphor, for it is empty yet able to receive; receiving yet not possessing, its subtlety is unfathomable—hence "Valley Spirit." The Dao is fundamentally true and constant, never perishing—hence "never dies." The Female gives birth to things, like what is called a mother. It is called "Mysterious" because one sees its giving birth but not how it gives birth.】
The gate of the Mysterious Female—this is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.
【It means that Heaven and Earth are born from this.】
Subtle and continuous, it seems to exist; in its use, it is not exhausting.
【"Subtle and continuous" means unbroken and uninterrupted. "Seems to exist" means it exists yet cannot be seen. If one can be like this, though using it all day, one does not grow weary.】

【People know that Heaven and Earth give birth to the myriad things, yet do not know that Heaven and Earth themselves are born from the Dao. How do I perceive the spirit of the Dao? Take the valley as an analogy: the valley is utterly empty yet still has form; the Valley Spirit, however, is empty and formless. Empty and formless, it has no being—how could it have death? Without death, there is no birth; what does not give birth can give birth—this is called the Mysterious Female. The Mysterious Female is the union of being and non-being; the Female is that which gives birth. The Dao’s giving birth to Heaven and Earth arises from this alone—hence it is called the Root of Heaven and Earth. If it were to cease, would it still come ceaselessly, as if existing? Then how could one perceive its existence? If one can be like this, the formed body may be made empty like a valley, the formless heart may be made still like a spirit, and in one’s use of it, there is no deliberate effort—merely a perfect accord. What exhaustion could there be? This chapter is the source from which the work of self-cultivation arises, though Laozi’s original intent was not primarily to expound on self-cultivation.】

Chapter Seven
Heaven is eternal, Earth everlasting. The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting is that they do not live for themselves—thus they can live long.
【"Do not live for themselves" means only giving life to things without cherishing their own life.】
Therefore, the sage places himself behind, yet finds himself ahead; sets himself aside, yet finds himself preserved.
【"Places himself behind" means putting oneself after others. "Sets himself aside" means diminishing oneself to enrich others. "Finds himself ahead" means no one can surpass him. "Finds himself preserved" means nothing can harm him.】
Is it not because he is selfless? Thus he can fulfill his self.
【"Self" refers to the person. Placing himself behind, he finds himself ahead; setting himself aside, he finds himself preserved—hence it is said he fulfills his self. The previous chapter spoke of the Dao giving birth to Heaven and Earth; this chapter speaks of Heaven and Earth giving birth to the myriad things, and the sage bringing success to the people. Nothing is as long-lived as Heaven and Earth. The reason Heaven and Earth can be eternal and everlasting is precisely that Heaven bestows and Earth gives birth, bestowing without cease, giving birth without limit—never for a day cherishing their bestowal, never for a day slackening their giving birth. This is called "not living for themselves." The myriad things all rely on them for life—thus they can live long. The sage is likewise: knowing this heart is constantly true and unchanging, vast and boundless in measure with Heaven and Earth, he sees nothing to cherish in this body. The movement of his single heart knows no action that is not good, no conduct that does not benefit. Because he does not perceive himself as having a body, none among those in the world with bodies can compare to him. Thus great virtue must obtain its reward, must obtain its position, must obtain its fame, must obtain its longevity—this is called placing himself behind yet finding himself ahead, setting himself aside yet finding himself preserved. The sage’s heart is luminous, penetrating, impartial, and all-embracing—utterly without self-interest. It is not that he seeks to fulfill his self, yet his self is fulfilled by it. This is the natural course of the Dao.】

Chapter Eight

The highest virtue is like water.
Water benefits the myriad things yet contends with none,
dwelling in places all others disdain—
thus it approaches the Dao.

It abides in good earth,
its heart is good depth,
its giving is good kindness,
its speech is good trust,
its governance is good order,
its service is good ability,
its movement is good timing.
Only because it does not contend
does it remain free from blame.

The sage, having placed himself behind and set himself aside, how could he be seen to contend for any virtue? That which alternates between yin and yang is called the Dao; to embody it is called virtue. The highest virtue is the virtue of the Dao—not what the world commonly recognizes as virtue. Thus it resembles water: though it irrigates and cleanses, performing the work of benefiting all things, it dwells in the low, filthy places all others shun—thereby approaching the virtue of one who has attained the Dao.

Water unites the seven virtues yet does not contend, and the sage emulates it. Thus his dwelling is secure, and his dwelling is good earth; his mind is settled and still, and his heart is good depth; his kindness blankets the world, and his giving is good kindness; his words are measured and careful, and his speech is good trust; he governs the state, and his governance is good order; he responds to all things with perfect adaptability, and his service is good ability; he moves in step with the seasons, and his movement is good timing. When men possess virtue yet cannot avoid reproach, it is because they contend. The sage embodies all virtues yet does not regard himself as capable, and so in all the world there is nothing he contends for, and in all the world there is none who reproaches him.

Chapter Nine

To hold and act upon it is not as good as ceasing;
to measure and sharpen it cannot be long preserved.
【When full, it must overflow—fearing its overflow, one supports it from the sides with branches, saying, "To hold sharpness is to invite breaking." Fearing its breakage, one regulates and restrains it with moderation, saying, "To measure."】
Gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them—
【a warning against greed.】
Wealth and honor breed arrogance, and one thereby invites misfortune—
【a warning against pride.】
To retire when merit is achieved and fame is attained is the Dao of Heaven.
【When merit is achieved and fame is attained, to ever maintain a mind of humility and retreat—this is called the Dao of Heaven.】

【This chapter speaks of the Dao of preserving the self. To know that fullness must overflow and thus seek to secure it is not as peaceful as not being full. To know that sharpness must break and thus seek to measure it beforehand is not as enduring as not being sharp. Thus, to be full yet not overflow is how one long preserves wealth; to hold and fill it is to have gold and jade fill the hall, yet none can guard them. To be exalted yet not imperiled is how one long preserves honor; to measure and sharpen it is to invite wealth and honor to breed arrogance, thereby courting misfortune. Therefore, only when merit and fame are achieved and one constantly maintains a mind of humility and retreat—this is how one acts without self-interest yet fulfills one’s self-interest. Is this not attaining the Dao of Heaven?】

Chapter Eleven

Can you carry your soul and embrace the One without separation?
【*Carry* here means to bear; *soul* refers to the hun and po. *Embrace the One* means to unite and become one.】
Can you concentrate your qi and attain suppleness, becoming like an infant?
【An infant knows nothing, yet its qi is perfectly concentrated; it can do nothing, yet its qi is perfectly supple.】
Can you cleanse and purify your profound vision without flaw?
【*Profound vision* refers to the insight of the profound and wondrous. When it is clung to, flaws inevitably arise, so one must cleanse and purify it.】
Can you love the people and govern the state without action?
【To love with attachment is not true love for the people; to govern with busyness is not true governance of the state. Only through purity and non-action will the people naturally transform.】
Can you open and close the gates of Heaven while remaining feminine?
【The *gates of Heaven* refer to the heart. Its comings and goings leave no trace—this is called the opening and closing of the gates of Heaven. To speak of *feminine* is to emphasize guarding stillness and nurturing movement.】
Can you comprehend the four directions without knowledge?
【Within and without are clear, the center is empty and open—thus one does not cling to knowledge, and so it is called *without knowledge*.】
To give life and nurture, to give life yet not possess, to act yet not rely, to grow yet not dominate—this is called profound virtue.
【*Not dominate* means not regarding oneself as capable of control. Though possessing great virtue, none can fathom it—thus it is called *profound virtue*.】

【The hun is the yang aspect of a person, the po the yin. Thus, the po is tied to things, while the hun is spirit. The sage’s nature is settled, and spirit is congealed, not swayed by things; spirit is ever-present, bearing the po. The common person is enslaved by things, their nature disturbed and spirit scattered. Their ears and eyes are wearied by sounds and sights, their nose and mouth labored by scents and flavors—thus the po must bear the spirit. Therefore, the teaching is to embrace the spirit and carry the po, so that the two do not separate. This is indeed the sage’s way of securing the self and attaining long life and enduring vision—its Dao also lies herein.

When the spirit is not governed, qi scatters: the strong become belligerent, the weak become fearful, neither knowing why. When the spirit is governed, qi is concentrated, undivided, and attains suppleness without resistance—who but an infant could achieve this? The sage, outwardly not carried away by the po, inwardly not driven by qi, thus transcends into profound vision. If this insight is not forgotten, if there is clinging or indulgence, can one be free from affliction? Thus, one must also cleanse and purify even this profound vision, lest it become a source of affliction.

Yet if one mistakenly takes this to mean studying emptiness and extinction, one does not understand: *carrying the soul* does not mean silent inaction—it is to love the people and govern the state *without action*. This is what is meant by *acting without action*. *Concentrating qi and attaining suppleness* does not mean stifling closure—it is to open and close the gates of Heaven *while remaining feminine*. This is what is meant by *the male guarding the female*. *Cleansing and purifying profound vision* does not mean obscuring darkness—it is to *comprehend the four directions without knowledge*. Like a mirror responding to things, it does not seek to reflect—this is what is meant by *knowing without knowledge*.

The sage’s Dao is sufficient to give life to and nurture the myriad things, yet it does not possess, does not rely, does not dominate. If not for profound virtue, deep and far-reaching, who could attain this?】

Thirty spokes share a single hub—
it is in their *nothingness* that the use of the cart lies.
[The spokes are the wheel’s limbs; the hub is what holds the axle at the wheel’s center. “In their nothingness” refers to the hollow of the hub. Only when the hub is empty can the cart move—hence it is said that the use of the cart lies in this.]

Knead clay to make a vessel—
it is in its *nothingness* that the use of the vessel lies.
[Knead: to blend; clay: earth. Blended earth forms a vessel, and the vessel’s emptiness allows it to hold things.]

Carve doors and windows to make a room—
it is in their *nothingness* that the use of the room lies.
[Carve: to bore through. Doors allow entry and exit; windows allow light to pass. Only when the room is empty can people dwell within.]

Thus, *being* is what brings advantage,
[Having this cart, this vessel, this room—these provide what benefits the world.]
while *nothingness* is what brings use.
[The cart’s turning axle, the vessel’s holding of things, the room’s entry, exit, and passage of light—all depend on their empty spaces. Thus, nothingness is what brings use to the world.]

---

This chapter speaks of the marvel of *being* and *nothingness* as one. The world knows only that *being* brings use, yet does not realize that *nothingness* moves *being* to its use—this is a divine insight. Consider how one rides in a cart: only when the hub has an empty space can the cart be used. In daily life, one uses vessels: only when the vessel has an empty space can it be used. For dwelling, one uses rooms: only when the room has an empty space can it be used. In all three, it is in their *nothingness* that their use lies—and from this, the principles of the world may be broadly inferred. Thus, without *being*, *nothingness* has no means to apply its advantage; without *nothingness*, *being* has no means to achieve its use. Clearly, *being* and *nothingness* are originally one. To know that the two cannot be separated is to reach the ultimate of the Dao.

The five colors blind the eyes.
[Blind: to be confused in seeing.]
The five tones deafen the ears.
[Deafen: to be confused in hearing.]
The five flavors dull the palate.
[Dull: to lose the true taste.]
Racing and hunting madden the heart.
[Madden: to unsettle the spirit.]
Rare and precious goods hinder conduct.
[Rare and precious goods: things not used in daily life. Hinder conduct: to harm virtue.]

Thus, the sage attends to the belly, not to the eyes.
[The belly is within—it receives without taking, accepts without retaining. The eyes are without—they covet and cannot be filled, seeing more and more yet never satisfied.]
Therefore, he rejects the latter and embraces the former.
[The latter: the eyes; the former: the belly.]

---

This chapter speaks of the sage’s guard over the self. The perfected person’s nature is settled within: the eyes discern colors, the ears judge sounds, the mouth harmonizes flavors, hunting is done in season, and precious goods are used as needed—responding to circumstances without confusion, for he has attained correctness. But if there is no center within, one is swayed by things, so that the five colors are enough to blind the eyes, the five tones enough to deafen the ears, the five flavors enough to dull the palate, hunting enough to disorder the heart, and rare goods enough to damage conduct—all losing their proper measure, the outer senses muddied and true nature dissolved. The sage only guards what is within and does not pursue what is without, allowing the heart to receive things without being swept away by contact. Thus, he attends to the belly and not to the eyes. Having rejected the latter to embrace the former, his center remains deep and still, clear and undisturbed.

Favor and disgrace both bring alarm.
[Favor: honor and esteem.]

Favor is honor and esteem, disgrace is lowliness and baseness—both bring alarm, as in a state of unease. "Favor and disgrace both bring alarm" means that alarm at favor is like alarm at disgrace. "To value great calamity as one values the body" means to fear the body as one fears great calamity.

What is meant by "favor and disgrace both bring alarm"? Favor is above, disgrace is below. People know disgrace as below but do not know that disgrace arises from favor—thus disgrace is not truly below, but favor is. To gain it brings alarm, to lose it brings alarm: this is called "favor and disgrace both bring alarm." Knowing favor as below, one gains it with unease, and when one loses it, it is as if nothing has been lost.

What is meant by "to value great calamity as one values the body"? The reason I have great calamity is that I have a body. Great calamity—illness and disease attack from within, while favor and disgrace, gain and loss assail from without—all arise only because this body exists. When I have no body, what calamity could I have? "No body" means forgetting the body. Knowing the body is not substantial and forgetting it, all great calamities vanish.

Thus, one who values the body for the sake of the world may be entrusted with the world. To value is to cherish one’s own body. Not guarding the body for the world, the world may instead be entrusted to one’s care. One who loves the body for the sake of the world may be relied upon with the world. To love is to treasure one’s own body. Treasuring the body for the world, the world may instead be entrusted to one’s care.

The sage, not harming the inner by the outer, guards what is within. Alarmed by favor as by disgrace, fearing the body as great calamity—how so? Favor and disgrace are not two things: favor precedes disgrace. Thus, what is below arises from what is above. Gaining it brings alarm, losing it brings the same alarm—never resting in favor, ever alarmed by disgrace. The body is the root of great calamity. Able to forget the body, no harm can assail it. Then the body seems as if nonexistent, and calamity does not arise. Extending this principle: valuing the body for the world, the world may be entrusted; loving the body for the world, the world may be relied upon. Only by not possessing the body can one traverse the world without encumbrance.

Chapter Fourteen

What cannot be seen is called "even."
What cannot be heard is called "rare."
What cannot be grasped is called "subtle."
These three cannot be further questioned, so they merge into one.

Above, it is not bright; below, it is not dark. Ceaselessly flowing, it cannot be named and returns to nothingness. This is called the formless form, the imageless image—called "elusive and evanescent."

Meeting it, one does not see its head; following it, one does not see its rear. Holding to the ancient Dao to steer the present being, one can know the ancient beginning. This is called the thread of the Dao.

This chapter describes the tracelessness of the Dao. The Dao is without sound or scent, born before heaven and earth—how could it be seen, heard, or grasped? Only because it cannot be seen is it called "even"; because it cannot be heard is it called "rare"; because it cannot be grasped is it called "subtle." Yet if one seeks to question these three, even the wise cannot name or describe them. Merging into one, they reveal only that the Dao cannot be divided.

Gazing upward, one does not see its brightness; gazing downward, one does not see its darkness. Flowing without cease, when named, it returns to nothingness. Returning to nothingness, yet it seems to exist—formless form, imageless image—thus called "elusive and evanescent." Profound indeed! The Dao fills heaven and earth yet cannot be grasped.

To meet it is to find no beginning; to follow it is to find no end. This is what is meant by the Dao being nowhere yet nowhere absent. Without beginning or end, it is neither ancient nor present. Yet tracing things to their origin—is this not ancient? Observing things as they are now—is this not present? The one who attains the Dao, holding to the ancient to steer the present, knows the ancient beginning, and the unending thread of the Dao is therein.

The ancients who were adept as scholars guarded subtlety, penetrated mystery, and delved so deeply as to be unknowable. Precisely because they were unknowable, one could only forcefully describe their demeanor—unknowable, thus beyond depiction, yet compelled to depict it nonetheless.

They were cautious as if fording a river in winter, hesitant as if wary of neighbors on all sides, solemn as if guests, fluid as melting ice, unadorned as uncarved wood, vast as an empty valley, and undifferentiated as turbid waters—such were their ways.

Who can, from turbidity, gradually clarify through stillness? Who can, from tranquility, gradually quicken through movement? Those who preserve this Dao do not seek fullness. Only by not being full can one remain worn yet not newly made.

This chapter speaks of those who attain the Dao and employ emptiness. The ancients who excelled as scholars thereby perfected sageliness and exhausted spirit. Their entry into the Dao’s workings—from guarding to subtlety, from subtlety to the utmost, and from the utmost to the profound—became so deep as to be unknowable. Once unknowable, how could one possibly describe them? If compelled, they were like those fording a river in winter; if fearful of being seen, like those wary of neighbors; if dignified, like guests; if apprehensive, like treading on ice; if simple, like uncarved wood; if receptive, like an empty valley; if undifferentiated, like turbid waters—yet none of these seven comparisons could fully capture them.

Perhaps they were like clarity itself. Worldly scholars are muddled by turbidity—who can, like them, embrace turbidity and through stillness gradually clarify? Perhaps they were like vitality itself. Those who wither in stagnation—who can, like them, abide in tranquility and through movement gradually quicken? All who preserve this Dao remain fundamentally empty and never full, thus appearing worn yet never newly made. Worn yet never new, enduring for a thousand ages as one day, the Dao is thereby brought to great completion.

Chapter Sixteen: Attaining the Utmost of Emptiness

Attaining means to push to its limit. To attain emptiness to its utmost is to conceal all that exists within the nonexistent. Abiding in stillness with steadfastness—steadfastness meaning firmness. To abide in stillness to the point of steadfastness is to contain all movement within stillness.

The myriad things arise together; I thereby observe their return. Arising means movement; return means reverting to their origin. When the myriad things arise, there must be return. Emptiness taken to its utmost, stillness made steadfast—through these, I observe their arising and also observe their return.

Now, the things flourish and flourish, each returning to its root. Flourishing describes their state of arising. Returning to the root is like blossoms and leaves that grow from the root and return to the root. Returning to the root is called stillness. Those who seek stillness by halting movement, calming thoughts, and forcing restraint do not attain true stillness. Returning to the root is reverting to the natural—this alone is true stillness.

Stillness is called reverting to destiny. Human beings are still by nature at birth—is this not the inherent state of the mandate bestowed? In stillness, one perceives this nature and thereby reverts to destiny. Reverting to destiny is called constancy. Abiding in constancy without disturbance—this is the so-called constant Dao.

Knowing constancy is called clarity. Without obstruction from things, one thereby generates clarity. Not knowing constancy, acting recklessly—this brings misfortune. Not knowing the constant Dao and acting recklessly invites calamity.

Knowing constancy brings capacity. Knowing constancy dissolves distinctions between self and other, perceptions of good and evil—is this not the capacity to embrace all things? Capacity brings impartiality. Impartiality brings kingship. Kingship accords with Heaven. Accord with Heaven is the Dao. As for the Dao, it is enduring. Truly constant and unchanging, how could it not endure?

To the end of one’s days, no peril. To preserve the body and life to the end is to court danger.

To preserve the Dao without desire for fullness is to value attaining emptiness. Emptiness necessarily brings stillness. When attainment reaches its limit and abiding in stillness is steadfast, the myriad things all lie within the scope of observation. In their arising, I observe their return.

Indeed, though things are born in flourishing multiplicity, in the end each returns to its original ground—thus it is called returning to the root. Having returned to the root, movement reaches its extreme and the time of stillness arrives. Within this utmost stillness, the inherent principle of things is thereby restored—hence it is called reverting to destiny. As for reverting to destiny, it is constant and unchanging. To know this constant, unchanging Dao is called clarity.

Only those who do not know this constant, unchanging Dao harbor reckless thoughts and reckless actions, all straying from the Dao and treading peril. Knowing constancy, the heart becomes as vast as Heaven and Earth—what thing cannot be embraced? Having this capacity, what affair is not impartial? To rule all under Heaven is to embody this impartial Dao. Ruling through impartiality accords with Heaven; accord with Heaven is the Dao.

This Dao is the so-called constant, unchanging Dao. One who attains this constant Dao of humanity will, to the end of their days, dwell in the Dao—what peril could there be?

**Chapter Seventeen**

In the highest state, the people know not that they are governed. ["Highest state" refers to the most supreme; "know not that they are governed" means mutual forgetting and wordless understanding, unaware of how this comes to be.] Next, they draw near and praise. [When the Dao and virtue decline and benevolence and righteousness become manifest, the people grow close to benevolence and praise righteousness.] Next, they fear. [When benevolence and righteousness are not practiced and government takes shape, the people fear its severity.] Next, they scorn. [When punishments and laws fail to restrain their hearts, rulers resort to cunning tactics, and the people scorn them.] Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust. [Only when those above lack self-trust and repeatedly change their methods of governance do the people begin to distrust them.] How cautious they are with their words! ["Cautious" means hesitant; the sage, overflowing with self-trust, still values their words highly, not uttering them lightly, so that the people naturally trust them.] When merit is achieved and affairs are completed, the hundred clans all say, "We are naturally thus." [The people are at ease in their lives, merit is accomplished, the great Dao is universally realized, and affairs are settled.]

**Chapter Eighteen**

When the great Dao is abandoned, there is benevolence and righteousness. [When the great Dao flourishes, there is no name for benevolence and righteousness, yet they are practiced within it. When the great Dao declines, benevolence and righteousness are named.] When wisdom and intelligence emerge, there is great deceit. [Wisdom is for knowing, intelligence for discerning; when knowing and discerning are combined, deceit increasingly arises.] When the six relations are not harmonious, there are filial piety and parental kindness. ["Six relations" refers to father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife. Only when the six relations are disharmonious do the names of filial sons and kind fathers appear.] When the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers. [When ruler and minister share the same virtue, there is no name for loyal ministers. Only when the state is in turmoil do loyal ministers emerge.]

**Chapter Nineteen**

Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the people will benefit a hundredfold. [Sageliness and wisdom are insufficient to know the Dao; if the people come to know the names of sageliness and wisdom, they will surely gallop in their thoughts and actions, bringing harm.] Abandon benevolence, discard righteousness, and the people will return to filial piety and parental kindness. [Benevolence and righteousness are originally within the great Dao; if the people usurp the names of benevolence and righteousness to pursue their private ends, there will surely be those who are unfilial and unkind.] Abandon skill, discard profit, and there will be no thieves or bandits. [Skill is for facilitating affairs, profit for aiding others; neither is intended for theft, yet without skill and profit, thieves and bandits cannot act.] These three are insufficient as cultural refinements, so let them have something to adhere to. ["Adhere" means to attach; the following "plainness and simplicity" are what they should adhere to. Sageliness, wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit—these three arise as the world increasingly refines its culture, hence these names. Such refinements are insufficient to govern the world, so they should be made to adhere to something.] Manifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, diminish desires. ["Plainness" is undyed silk; "simplicity" is uncarved wood. To manifest plainness and embrace simplicity is to keep the heart free of selfishness and desires naturally diminished.]

**Chapter Twenty**

Abandon learning, and there will be no worries. [Learning that reaches the point of no learning is true abandonment of learning. Without thought and without action, one can be without worry.] How far apart are compliance and flattery? How great is the difference between good and evil? [Compliance and flattery are both responses; compliance is respectful, while flattery is careless. Good surpasses evil just as compliance surpasses flattery—they are not far apart.] What people fear, one cannot but fear. How vast and boundless it is! ["What people fear, the sage also fears," yet what they fear is great and limitless—vast and boundless, without boundaries.] The multitude are joyous, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice, as if ascending a spring terrace. [Joyous, they are immersed in their pleasures; feasting on a grand sacrifice suggests its richness, ascending a spring terrace its delight.] I alone am tranquil, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. ["Tranquil" means still; "sign" means budding. An infant is newly born.]

The child grows slightly older. Adrift, I seem without destination—like a chariot that, once home, is no longer ridden; adrift, it advances yet retreats, without a place of return.

The multitude all have surplus, while I alone seem forgotten. My heart is that of a fool—ah! Forgotten means lost. Each prides themselves on what they know, thus calling it surplus; the sage, though knowing nothing, is truly without knowledge, thus seeming forgotten. The heart of a fool means knowing nothing.

Vast and undifferentiated—ah! The multitude are bright and clear; I alone seem dim. The multitude are sharp and discerning; I alone am dull and unknowing. Dim means self-concealing; sharp and discerning means priding in cleverness; dull and unknowing means acting without contrivance.

Fleeting—ah!—like darkness. Still—ah!—like having no place to rest. The multitude all have their uses; I alone am stubborn and coarse. I alone differ from others in valuing the nourishment of the Mother.

The perfected one, having abandoned sagely wisdom, benevolence, righteousness, skill, and profit, returns to plain simplicity. In the world, what is there to learn? Only by learning nothing does one achieve the ultimate learning, and things are no longer worthy of concern. The reason worldly people are so troubled and full of worries is that their hearts cannot forget—most of all, the distinction between good and evil. Thus, to say good surpasses evil is like saying compliance surpasses flattery, not realizing that both are equally without substance. It would be better to discard even the name of goodness, so that this heart may be vast and unburdened.

Yet the sage does not willfully indulge their desires; they follow what people fear, and I too fear it—indeed, fearing all things without limit. How vast and boundless it is! The multitude, in their worldly pleasures, are like those feasting on grand sacrifices or ascending spring terraces; the sage is not so. In stillness, they peacefully abide in simplicity, without a single budding thought, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile. In movement, they drift, neither advancing nor retreating, without a place of return or trace to cling to—this is how they differ from the multitude.

People, seeing only their own strengths, seem to have surplus, while the sage, embracing all things, is truly empty and hollow, transcending as if forgotten—ah! Is this not the heart of a fool? How utterly undifferentiated and unknowing! Thus, people see clearly, while the sage alone seems dim; people scrutinize things, while the sage alone acts without contrivance. People all display their abilities as if they had uses, while the sage alone is stubbornly coarse, applying nothing. All these differences from others arise from relinquishing learning and taking the Dao as their foundation, like an infant feeding from its mother—ah! What worry could an infant feeding from its mother have?

**Chapter Twenty-One**
The bearing of great virtue follows only the Dao. The Dao as a thing is only vague and elusive. Elusive—ah!—vague—ah!—within it are images. Vague—ah!—elusive—ah!—within it are things. Profound—ah!—obscure—ah!—within it is essence. Its essence is most true; within it is reliability. From ancient times to the present, its name does not depart, by which we observe the beginnings of the multitude. How do I know the beginnings of the multitude are so? By this.

To relinquish things and abandon knowledge, reaching the state of stubborn coarseness—this is the bearing of utmost virtue. From what does it arise? Only from following the Dao. The Dao as a thing is elusive and seemingly present, vague and seemingly absent. When vague and elusive, it is not dark, yet one suspects the presence of things—thus, within it are images. Images are suspected to be things yet are not things. When elusive and vague, it is not bright, yet one suspects the absence of things—thus, within it are things. Things are suspected to be absent yet are present.

Yet it is not merely conjectured to contain things—within it is essence. Essence is what obtains the Dao’s singularity without admixture. It is the subtlest of what is within the coarse. Only the absence within presence becomes the essence within presence. Only because it is true does it not persist in being nor perish in non-being—this is called reliability. Thus, though ancient and present times differ, the Dao does not depart. Only because it never departs can it observe the beginnings of all things and become the mother of the myriad beings.

The sage, able to observe the beginnings of all things and know their origins, does so by embodying this Dao.

**Chapter Twenty-Two**
To yield is to be preserved whole.
[The sage acts only in accord with principle—where principle resides, though the path be winding, it remains unobstructed. Thus, in harmony with things, he preserves their wholeness.]

To bend is to be upright.
[Though principle may seem bent, it is the ultimate straightness under heaven.]

To be hollow is to be filled.
[What the multitude gathers toward is lowliness—thus it must be filled.]

To be worn is to be renewed.
[Clarity and scrutiny are not the Dao. Obscurity and simplicity may seem worn, yet from them all things arise.]

To be few is to attain; to be many is to be confounded.
[The Dao is but one. Grasping the one, nothing is left ungrasped. To learn much without unifying it is to be confounded.]

Thus, the sage embraces the one and becomes the model for all under heaven.
[The one is the Dao. To embrace the one is to remain ever with the Dao.]

He does not display himself, and so is luminous.
[He sees through the eyes of all under heaven, yet does not see through his own—thus nothing escapes his perception.]

He does not assert himself, and so is distinguished.
[He affirms what all under heaven affirm, yet does not affirm himself—thus nothing can surpass his affirmation.]

He does not boast, and so achieves merit.
[He ascribes merit to all under heaven, yet does not claim it for himself—thus he has merit.]

He does not exalt himself, and so endures.
[He entrusts ability to the myriad things, yet does not exalt himself—thus he endures.]

Only because he does not contend does the world not contend with him.
[The sage attains the one and is without self; without self, he does not contend.]

The ancient saying, "To yield is to be preserved whole," is no empty phrase. Truly, wholeness is restored to him.
[What is called "wholeness" inwardly preserves the self, outwardly preserves things—both self and things are preserved, returning to their nature. Such wholeness is vast indeed.]

[To know the origins of the myriad things is to embrace the one. Embracing the one, one can yield, bend, be hollow, be worn. Things cannot remain forever yielding—thus to yield is to be preserved whole. Things cannot remain forever bent—thus to bend is to be upright. To be hollow is to be filled; to be worn is to be renewed. To be few is to attain; to be many is to be confounded—this is the principle of nature. The sages of old became the ancestors of the myriad things because they embraced the one. Embracing the one, they remained ever with the Dao, thus did not display themselves but relied on others’ perceptions, did not assert themselves but relied on things’ affirmations, did not claim merit but relied on others’ achievements, did not exalt themselves but relied on others’ abilities. Only by not contending with things did the world not contend with them. The sage acts in accord with principle, rooted in ultimate wholeness, yet also yields to nurture it—thus his wholeness is vast indeed.]

**Chapter Twenty-Three**
Sparse speech is natural.
[The principle of heaven and earth is inherently natural. Thus, the term "natural" is not verbose—yet the principle of heaven and earth is fully expressed in it.]

Whirlwinds do not last the morning; sudden rains do not last the day. Who brings these about? Heaven and earth. If even heaven and earth cannot endure long, how much less can man?
[From dawn to dusk is a morning; from early to late is a day. Whirlwinds and sudden rains do not arise from constancy—thus they cannot endure.]

Therefore, those who align with the Dao are one with the Dao; those who align with virtue are one with virtue; those who align with loss are one with loss.
[Dao is practice; virtue is attainment. Only those who align with the Dao can be without self—thus when practice is possible, they practice without resistance; when attainment is possible, they attain without resistance; when loss is possible, they lose without resistance. "One with" means to follow and not resist.]

Those one with the Dao—the Dao delights in attaining them. Those one with virtue—virtue delights in attaining them. Those one with loss—loss delights in attaining them.
[When practice is possible, they delight in attaining it; when attainment is possible, they delight in attaining it; when loss is possible, they delight in attaining it. Whether acting or ceasing, gaining or losing, they delight in it—this is the mark of one who knows the Dao.]

Where trust is insufficient, there is distrust.
[Yet entering the Dao values trust. If trust is incomplete, there arises an inability to trust oneself.]

[The sage does not contend because the principle of heaven and earth is inherently natural. Thus, the Dao of nature is not verbose—yet the principle of heaven and earth is fully expressed in it. The world rarely trusts this, preferring action. Where there is action, there must be cessation—how can it endure? Even whirlwinds and sudden rains cannot endure, as is evident. Those who align with the Dao are not thus. Aligning with the Dao is natural. Naturalness means there is fundamentally nothing to attain—what loss could there be? Without attainment or loss, they follow the world’s gains and losses—thus success and failure, poverty and prosperity all come of themselves, without contrivance. There is nothing they are not one with, nothing they do not delight in. Those who do not know the Dao lack firm trust in it; when they encounter loss, they doubt—thus they grow ever more distrustful. Only those who trust the Dao can speak of the Dao of self-doubt.]

**Chapter Twenty-Four**
One who stands on tiptoe does not stand firm; one who strides does not walk.
[Raising the heels is called "tiptoeing"; stretching the feet is called "striding." To stand and seek height is to harm one’s standing; to walk and seek breadth is to harm one’s walking.]

One who displays himself is not luminous; one who asserts himself is not distinguished; one who boasts has no merit; one who exalts himself does not endure. In the Dao, these are called "excess food" and "superfluous conduct"—things some despise. Thus, those with the Dao do not abide in them.
[Superfluous growths are excrescences; conduct should be "form," but here it is written as "conduct." Leftover food is despised; excrescent forms are deemed ugly.]

[The sage acts in accord with nature and does not display himself, assert himself, boast, or exalt himself—having witnessed the harm of contention. No one is incapable of standing or walking, yet if one deems standing insufficient and adds tiptoeing, walking insufficient and adds striding, none will fail to lose their standing or walking. Those who display themselves, assert themselves, boast, or exalt themselves are likewise. In the Dao, they are but excess food and superfluous conduct. Common people may crave them, yet the sage also adopts them—this is excess food. What is inherently absent in nature yet is occasionally indulged—this is superfluous conduct. Excess food and superfluous conduct are despised by things—thus it is fitting that those with the Dao do not abide in them.]

**Chapter Twenty-Five**
There is a thing, formless yet complete, born before heaven and earth.
[Subtle principle eternally abides—thus it is called "a thing." The myriad ways cannot divide it—thus it is called "formless yet complete." The Dao gives birth to heaven and earth—thus it is said to be born before them.]

Silent and void, it stands alone and does not change; it circulates without end and does not weary. It may be called the mother of all under heaven. I do not know its name—calling it "Dao."
[Silence is absence of sound.]

Silent—this is absence of form. Vast and without peer—this is called "standing alone." Unchanging through ancient and modern times—this is called "not changing." Present in all places—this is called "circulating." Wherever it is, all is pervaded—this is called "not wearying." That it may be called the mother of all under heaven means that all things under heaven arise from it. Not knowing its name, it cannot be named—yet forced to give it a name, call it "great." Great—this is called "flowing." Flowing—this is called "far-reaching." Far-reaching—this is called "returning."

[As a thing, the Dao—when employed, it fills the six directions; when withdrawn, none know its whereabouts. How could such greatness be named? It is merely forced to be named. Great—then it flows without end, thus "great" is called "flowing." Flowing—then it reaches afar without obstruction, thus "flowing" is called "far-reaching." Yet returning to its root, it has never departed from one’s own body—thus "far-reaching" is called "returning."]

Thus the Dao is great, heaven is great, earth is great, and the king is also great. Within the realm, there are four great ones, and the king occupies one of them. Man models himself on earth; earth models itself on heaven; heaven models itself on the Dao; the Dao models itself on spontaneity.

[Within the realm, once heaven and earth are distinguished, there are four great ones, and the king occupies one of them. The king embodies the perfection of human Dao. Man models himself on earth—where earth reaches, man reaches. Earth models itself on heaven—where heaven reaches, earth reaches. Heaven models itself on the Dao—where the Dao reaches, heaven reaches. The Dao takes non-method as its method. Non-method is simply spontaneity—thus it is said the Dao models itself on spontaneity.]

[This chapter speaks of the greatness of the Dao and how the king can match it. The Dao is neither clear nor turbid, neither high nor low—its body is complete in undifferentiated wholeness. In man, it is called nature. Thus it is said, "There is a thing, formless yet complete." None know its origin, for it abides in tranquil constancy, and heaven and earth are born within it. Silent—without sound; vast—without form. It stands alone without peer and never changes. It circulates through all beings without wearying. Stooping to transform and nurture the myriad things, it is their mother. The Dao is originally nameless, yet the sage sees that nothing does not arise from it—thus he names it "Dao." Seeing that nothing surpasses it, he forces a name upon it, calling it "great." Calling it "great," yet it flows without end—thus "great" is called "flowing." Calling it "flowing," yet it reaches everywhere without obstruction—thus "flowing" is called "far-reaching." Calling it "far-reaching," yet in a single thought, nothing is not contained—thus "far-reaching" is called "returning." Such is the greatness of the Dao. Thus within the realm there are four great ones, and the king models himself on all of them: modeling himself on earth, like earth’s impartial bearing; modeling himself on heaven, like heaven’s impartial covering; modeling himself on the Dao, like the Dao’s impartial generation and completion. Thus when joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure are in accord with the mean, this suffices to position heaven and earth and nurture the myriad things—how could matching the Dao be difficult for the king?]

**Chapter Twenty-Six**

The heavy is the root of the light; the still is the lord of the restless. [The root is the foundation. "Restless" means excessive movement and disturbance. The heavy can govern the light; the still can govern the restless—thus it is said, "The heavy is the root of the light; the still is the lord of the restless."] Therefore the sage, though traveling all day, does not part from the heavy baggage train. Though there may be splendid sights and tranquil dwellings, he remains detached and aloof. [In ancient times, whether on auspicious journeys or military campaigns, there were always supply wagons following behind to carry the travelers’ clothing, food, and implements. Because of their weight and burden, they were called the "heavy baggage train." "Splendid sights" refers to dazzling and flourishing spectacles. "Tranquil dwellings" means peaceful abodes; "detached and aloof" describes being elevated and free from attachment.] How could the lord of ten thousand chariots treat his own person lightly before the world? To be light is to lose the root; to be restless is to lose the lord.

[To "use one’s person to guard the world" means to exhaust oneself in trivial matters for the sake of the world. In guarding, one loses one’s own foundation; in restlessness, one loses what one should master. This chapter speaks of the Dao of governing the world: in response, one first feels the heavy, then later responds. What is responded to arises from what is felt—thus the heavy is the root of the light. The still employs things; the restless is employed by things. The restless is always employed by the still—thus the still is the lord of the restless. Therefore, though the sage’s conduct throughout the day may be simple and frugal, he still does not part from the heavy baggage train—this shows that the light cannot be without the heavy. Though there may be splendid sights sufficient for enjoyment, he must have a tranquil dwelling of detachment—this shows that the restless cannot be without the still. How much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots—can he afford not to be still and heavy? Only when pressed does he act; only when unavoidable does he rise—this is heaviness. To act through non-action is stillness.]

If one is otherwise—allowing trivial matters to entangle even a single thing—this is sufficient to be enslaved by it. How then can one govern the world?

**Chapter Twenty-Seven**
The good at traveling leaves no wheel tracks—
[Moving in accord with principle, thus leaving no trace.]
The good at speaking leaves no flaws or blame—
[Speaking only when the time is right, so that one’s words fill the world without a single fault.]
The good at reckoning uses no counting rods—
[The numbers of the ten thousand things all arrayed before one; knowing without calculation, what need is there for counting rods?]
The good at shutting uses no bolt or bar yet cannot be opened;
The good at binding uses no cords or knots yet cannot be undone.
[The *jian* is the wooden bar that blocks a door—horizontal is called *guan*, vertical is called *jian*. *Jie* means to tie or fasten. The person of perfect virtue, in relation to the ten thousand things, is like a mother to her child: though she lets them roam, they do not leave. Thus, without bolts she can shut, without cords she can bind.]

Therefore, the sage is always good at saving people—thus there are no abandoned people;
Always good at saving things—thus there are no abandoned things.
This is called "veiling one’s illumination."
[The sage, with the constancy of true goodness, saves people—every person is within the scope of education, thus none are abandoned. With the constancy of true goodness, he saves things—every thing is within the process of transformation and nurturing, thus none are abandoned. *Xi ming* means the sage conceals his illumination and does not display it.]

Thus, the good person is the teacher of the not-good;
The not-good person is the resource of the good.
If one does not value one’s teacher, does not cherish one’s resource—
Even the wise are greatly deluded.
This is called the essential mystery.
[The good person is the teacher of the not-good—this means the not-good can become good. The not-good person is the resource of the good—this means the not-good can assist the good. Yet the sage is without intention toward things: though the good may serve as teachers, he does not know their teaching as something to be valued; though the not-good may serve as resources, he does not know their assistance as something to be cherished. The sage’s mystery is such that even the wise cannot fully comprehend it—thus it is called the essential mystery.]

[This chapter speaks of the sage’s conduct: though still and heavy, in truth it cannot be named. Good at traveling, good at speaking, good at reckoning, good at shutting, good at binding—all are constancy in goodness. Only with constancy in goodness does one neither increase on account of people nor decrease on account of things. Yet people and things, though constant, lose their true constancy—thus the sage always saves them with true constancy. Saving people with true constancy, there are no abandoned people; saving things with true constancy, there are no abandoned things. For people and things alike possess this illumination—only the sage, with the illumination of knowing constancy, saves them at the moment of their shared reality. Thus his illumination is concealed and not visible—this is called *veiling one’s illumination*. Therefore, the good person is the teacher of the not-good; the not-good person is the resource of the good. How could the not-good be abandoned? Yet the sage forgets self and forgets things, not knowing the teacher as something to be valued, not knowing the resource as something to be cherished. Good and evil both forgotten, all is blended and transformed by the Dao. Even the wise cannot fully comprehend this—is this not returning to the root, reverting to the origin, and alone beholding the mystery of the Dao?]

**Chapter Twenty-Eight**
Know the masculine, guard the feminine—
Be the world’s valley.
Being the world’s valley,
Constant virtue does not depart,
And one returns to the state of infancy.

Know the white, guard the black—
Be the world’s model.
Being the world’s model,
Constant virtue does not err,
And one returns to the boundless.
[The masculine is strength and vigor; the feminine is softness and weakness. *Know* implies the capacity for action; *guard* implies the power of mastery. The valley is where water gathers. Constant virtue is constant Dao. At the beginning of life, constant virtue is complete within; when led astray by things, it departs day by day. Thus, when constant virtue does not depart, one returns to the state of infancy.

The white is brightness and clarity; the black is obscurity and darkness. The *model* is the standard by which the world patterns itself.]

Without error, without deviation—
Returning to the boundless, even infancy is no longer worth speaking of.

Know the honored, guard the humble—
Be the world’s valley.
Being the world’s valley,
Constant virtue is fulfilled,
And one returns to the uncarved block.
[The honored is esteem and exaltation; the humble is lowliness and abasement. The valley, too, is where water gathers. *Fulfilled* means constant virtue is not merely without error. The *uncarved block* is the wholeness of the real, the undifferentiated state of things.]

When the uncarved block is hewn, it becomes vessels.
The sage employs it as the chief of officials—
Thus, great governance requires no cutting.
[Once the uncarved block is split, there are vessels. The sage embraces the uncarved block and thus uses this wholeness to become the chief of officials. *Great governance* is that which governs without governing. *Cutting* means division and fragmentation.]

This chapter speaks of the sage’s use of non-being to govern being, the Dao of uniting with the mysterious. For among the world’s affairs, there are those that cannot be accomplished by softness alone, those that cannot be ordered by obscurity alone, and those that cannot be achieved by remaining below alone—this is why the sage must know the masculine, know the white, know the honored. Yet hardness does not arise from hardness but from softness; clarity does not arise from clarity but from obscurity; loftiness does not arise from loftiness but from lowliness—this is why the sage must guard the feminine, guard the black, guard the humble. The sage guards these to become the valley, the valley, the model, so that all under heaven return to him. Precisely because this true and constant virtue has never departed—
Ah, the state of infancy!

The Unbounded is the Uncarved Block, the true Way inherent in the genuine person—thus it is spoken of as "returning." Only when the Uncarved Block scatters does it become vessels. The Dao belongs to what is above form; vessels belong to what is below form. When the sage employs what is above form to govern what is below form, this Uncarved Block becomes the ruler. For to control things, one must divide, yet the great governance that does not divide—this is what is meant by "embracing the Uncarved Block so the people correct themselves."

**Chapter Twenty-Nine**
Those who would take the world and act upon it—I see they will not succeed. The world is a sacred vessel; it cannot be acted upon. Those who act upon it ruin it; those who grasp it lose it. Thus, among things, some advance while others follow, some exhale warm breath while others blow cold, some are strong while others weak, some bear while others destroy. Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity.

**Chapter Thirty**
Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do not use arms to strengthen the world. Such affairs readily rebound. Where armies have encamped, brambles grow.

**Chapter Twenty-Nine (continued)**
To govern it by improper means is thus impossible. Those who act seek completion, yet precisely thereby bring about failure. Those who grasp seek attainment, yet precisely thereby incur loss. Truly, all things possess their own natural dispositions, hence the differences in sequence, warmth and cold, hardness and weakness, movement and stillness. Guiding them according to their tendencies is simple and effortless, and principle is naturally attained. Violating their nature and acting upon them is burdensome and laborious, and things grow ever more disordered. Therefore, the sage eliminates excess, eliminates extravagance, eliminates extremity, preventing things from reaching excess and harming others—thus the world remains free from calamity.

**Chapter Thirty**
Those who assist a ruler with the Dao do not use arms to strengthen the world. Such affairs readily rebound. Where armies have encamped, brambles grow. [*"Rebound" means retaliation with arms in kind. Where troops are stationed, the people’s affairs are abandoned, fields go untended, and after warfare, the dominance of killing qi injures the harvest.]

The adept acts with resolve and nothing more, daring not to seize strength. [The adept in warfare acts with decisiveness alone, aiming solely to overcome the enemy as a last resort, not relying on it to seize power.] Resolute yet not boastful, resolute yet not vaunting, resolute yet not arrogant, resolute yet acting only when unavoidable—this is resoluteness without force. [Not boasting of one’s ability, not vaunting one’s achievements, not arrogant in one’s power, such resoluteness always arises from necessity—this is the way of resoluteness without force.]

When things reach their prime, they age—this is called "not following the Dao." What does not follow the Dao perishes early. [That things grow strong and then age is their nature, yet the Dao values guarding softness as strength. Thus, affairs that do not follow the Dao should be abandoned early and not pursued.]

[The ruler practices non-action, so those who assist a ruler with the Dao likewise do not use arms to strengthen the world. For if one subdues the world with the Dao, the world dares not resist; if one coerces the world with arms, it will surely resist and oppose. Moreover, with heaven’s timing and earth’s advantages, harm may yet arise. Thus, the adept in warfare overcomes the enemy and nothing more—it is not relied upon to seize power. Yet even when the aim is solely to overcome the enemy, one must not boast, not vaunt, not grow arrogant. If the heart truly acts from necessity and not to seize power, this is the Dao. The Dao values guarding softness as strength, which is how one endures without peril. To abandon softness and employ strength is to invite aging—how can this be a constant way? Thus, one should abandon it early and not use arms to strengthen the world.]

**Chapter Thirty-One**
Fine weapons are inauspicious instruments; some things detest them. Therefore, those who possess the Dao do not dwell in them. [*"Fine weapons" means skill in warfare. "Do not dwell" means using them to resolve difficulties but not making them a constant practice.]

The noble person at rest values the left; in warfare, values the right. [The left pertains to yang, yang governs generation; the right pertains to yin, yin governs sternness and killing.] Weapons are inauspicious instruments, not the instruments of the noble person. When unavoidable, one employs them, with tranquility as the highest aim. To conquer yet not delight in it—those who delight in it take pleasure in killing. Those who take pleasure in killing cannot realize their ambitions in the world. [*"Tranquility" means calmness. "Not delight" means not considering it good.]

Auspicious affairs exalt the left; inauspicious affairs exalt the right. The deputy general stands on the left; the supreme general stands on the right. This means that in terms of rank, the lower is placed above. [The deputy general’s position is below the supreme general, yet the deputy stands on the left while the supreme stands on the right—by rank, the lower is thus placed above.] Precisely because weapons are instruments of misfortune, they are arranged according to mourning rites. Mourning rites exalt yin. When many are killed, one weeps in sorrow; when victorious in battle, one arranges it according to mourning rites. [This chapter speaks of warfare as a ruler’s last resort. Those who delight in it wield inauspicious instruments, which some things detest, so those who possess the Dao do not make it a constant practice. In peacetime, the left is valued; in warfare, the right—precisely because weapons are inauspicious and not what the noble person delights in. When unavoidable, one employs them, and tranquility is the highest aim. Tranquility is the root of victory. Yet if the noble person conquers and delights in it, this is taking pleasure in killing. How can one who takes pleasure in killing realize ambitions in the world? Thus, auspicious affairs exalt the left, inauspicious affairs exalt the right. In warfare, the deputy general stands on the left, the supreme general on the right—this is arranging it according to mourning rites. When many are killed, one weeps in sorrow; even in victory, one arranges it according to mourning rites, showing that weapons are used only when unavoidable, not with delight.]

**Chapter Thirty-Two**
The Dao is eternally nameless. [The "eternal Dao" is the "constant Dao" of the first chapter; "nameless" is the "nameless" of the first chapter.] Though the Uncarved Block is small, the world does not dare to treat it as a subject. [The nameless Uncarved Block is likened to something small.] If lords and kings can guard it, the myriad things will of themselves submit. [To "guard" is to preserve this Uncarved Block; "submit" means to serve.]

Heaven and earth unite to send down sweet dew; the people, without command, of themselves attain balance. [*"Command" means orders; "balance" means universality.] When the beginning of order arises, names come into being. Once names exist, [*"The beginning of order" means the Uncarved Block dispersing into vessels, and vessels having names.] one must also know to stop. [To "stop" is not to pursue names but to return and stabilize with the Uncarved Block.] Knowing to stop is how one avoids peril. The Dao’s presence in the world is like rivers and valleys flowing into the Yangtze and the sea. [Rivers and valleys are the branches of water; the Yangtze and the sea are the convergence of water.]

[This chapter speaks of the cyclical nature of Dao and vessels. The Dao cannot be named; likened to the Uncarved Block, it may be called small, yet heaven and earth begin with it, the myriad things arise from it—who in the world would dare treat it as a subject? If lords and kings can guard this Dao, the myriad things will of themselves submit. Their submission is like heaven and earth’s qi uniting as one to send down sweet dew. If lords and kings embody the supreme Dao to govern things, they do not command yet attain balance, like the dew—who can perceive its form? When the myriad things arise, the Uncarved Block disperses into vessels, and vessels have names. The sage does not pursue names and forget the Uncarved Block, so they are given a stopping point—stopping means returning to the Dao. This is how one navigates ten thousand changes without peril. It is like rivers and valleys branching yet inevitably taking the Yangtze and the sea as their source—thus vessels are merged into the Dao and still stabilized by the nameless Uncarved Block.]

**Chapter Thirty-Three**
One who knows others is wise; [The heart can discriminate.] one who knows oneself is enlightened. [The heart is without obstruction.] One who conquers others has strength; [Contending in power externally.] one who conquers oneself is mighty. [Overcoming one’s selfishness.] One who knows contentment is rich; [Finding sufficiency in what one encounters brings constant abundance.] One who acts with perseverance has resolve; [Not contending with things, yet unceasingly strengthening oneself.] One who does not lose their place endures; [Preserving what they preserve, not swayed by things.] One who dies yet does not perish is long-lived. [With true nature profound and unchanging, one dies yet does not perish. This chapter speaks of the sage’s Dao: turning the light inward, observing within, and finding all sufficiency in oneself. For when the heart of discrimination is not eliminated, one may know others yet not know oneself. But with the enlightenment of knowing the constant, one knows oneself clearly.]

The strength of contending horns may prevail, yet to conquer others without conquering oneself is beyond the reach of mere force. Only the power of self-mastery transcends such strength.

Those who covet and admire see only insufficiency; I, perceiving no lack, am rich. Those who chase after things are ensnared by them, while I, steadfast in personal cultivation without respite, cannot be robbed of my resolve. Things change endlessly, yet the heart never loses its place—remaining unlost, it endures. Life and death are vast transformations, yet one’s nature never perishes—remaining unperished, it is long-lived. To endure and to be long-lived—is this not to be beyond birth and death? The perfected person’s actions are as nothing to the myriad things.

---

**Chapter 34**
The great Dao flows freely, unbound to left or right. [It is without attachment.] It nurtures and sustains the ten thousand things, relying on it to live, yet does not claim credit. Its work is complete, yet it does not take possession. Nurturing the ten thousand things without acting as their master, [without the mind of dominion,] it may be called small. [Abiding in constant emptiness, it seems slight.] Yet the ten thousand things return to it without knowing their master—it may be called great. [Embracing all without exclusion, it seems vast.] Thus the sage never claims greatness and thereby achieves greatness.

[This chapter speaks of the boundless nature of the Dao’s essence, which, like flowing water, is unattached and may turn left or right, pervading all without limit. Since it pervades all, every thing is born of the Dao—how could it refuse them? Yet having given life, it does not claim credit, for the Dao nurtures the ten thousand things without the mind of dominion. Precisely because it is empty and unattached, it is without desire and may be called small; yet the ten thousand things return to it as their master, and it may also be called great. However, great and small are not fixed names—only by being small can it be great. Thus the sage never claims greatness and thereby achieves greatness.]

---

**Chapter 35**
Hold fast to the great image, and all under heaven will come to you. [The great image is the imageless image, which is the Dao. "Come" means to return.] They come without harm, abiding in peace and security. Music and fine food may make a passing traveler pause, but the Dao, when spoken, is bland and without flavor—seen, it is not enough to be visible; heard, it is not enough to be audible; yet its use is inexhaustible.

[All things rely on the Dao to live, so when the sage holds to this Dao, all under heaven naturally return to it. Returning without harm, the sage brings all to rest in peace and security. Offering music and delicacies may detain a passing traveler, but how does this compare to the Dao’s spoken words? Though seemingly flavorless, its invisible and inaudible nature pervades past and present, its use unending. This reveals that tranquility and non-action constitute the great image.]

---

**Chapter 36**
If you wish to contract something, you must first expand it; if you wish to weaken something, you must first strengthen it; if you wish to abolish something, you must first exalt it; if you wish to seize something, you must first give it. This is called subtle illumination. [Subtle illumination means that though it seems obscure, it is in fact clear.] The soft overcomes the hard; the weak overcomes the strong. As fish cannot leave the depths, the sharp instruments of state should not be displayed to others.

[This chapter speaks of the principle of cyclical rise and fall and the sage’s mastery of the heart. When one says "if you wish," it is a tentative phrase; when one says "you must first," it is an established phrase. From its expansion, one knows its contraction; from its strength, one knows its weakness; from its exaltation, one knows its abolition; from its giving, one knows its seizure. Like the sun’s decline at noon or the moon’s waxing and waning, this is an inevitable principle—though subtle, it is perfectly clear. Those who see form regard hardness and strength as capable of overcoming softness and weakness, but those who understand principle realize that softness and weakness overcome hardness and strength. Just as fish cannot leave the depths, humans cannot depart from softness and weakness. When fish remain hidden in the deep, their softness and weakness allow them to live; if they leap onto dry land, there is no hope for survival. The sage retreats into modesty and compliance, yet can turn heaven and earth—how could he display his sharp instruments for others to see? For the harm of hardness and strength is greater than that of blades, hence the analogy to sharp instruments.]

---

**Chapter 37**
The Dao constantly takes no action, yet there is nothing it does not do. If lords and kings can guard it, the ten thousand things will transform of themselves. If, in their transformation, desires arise, I will pacify them with the nameless uncarved block. [Desires arise; to pacify means to press down and still them.] The nameless uncarved block is itself without desire. Without desire, through tranquility, all under heaven will rectify itself.

[This chapter speaks of the Dao’s non-action as its essence and its "nothing not done" as its function, uniting them in mutual forgetting. Non-action that accomplishes all is the intent of acting without acting. If lords and kings can guard this non-action, they need not seek to transform the ten thousand things, for the things will transform themselves. The transformation of the ten thousand things begins with non-action but gradually leads to action, which inevitably becomes chaotic. The sage, knowing this, pacifies the arising with the nameless uncarved block. Yet if there is even a thought of using the uncarved block, it is no longer the true uncarved block. Thus, by desiring nothing, one attains perfect tranquility. When all under heaven is not tranquil, it stems from desire. Without desire, tranquility naturally prevails—could there be anything under heaven that does not return to rectitude?]

The *Imperially Commissioned Annotations on the Dao De Jing*, Lower Scroll, Chapter Thirty-Eight

The highest virtue does not act as virtue—thus it possesses virtue.
The lesser virtue does not lose virtue—thus it lacks virtue.
[Not acting as virtue is mutual forgetting that transforms;
Not losing virtue is clinging without transformation.]

The highest virtue practices non-action and acts without contrivance.
The lesser virtue acts with deliberate effort.
[Contrivance implies intent;
Acting without contrivance is action without intent,
While acting with contrivance is action with self-consciousness.]

The highest benevolence acts without contrivance;
The highest righteousness acts with contrivance;
The highest propriety acts, yet none respond—
Then it rolls up its sleeves and drags them along.
[None respond: coercing the people when they do not follow.
"Drags along" means pulling and tugging to compel them,
Illustrating the intent to force compliance.]

Thus, when the Dao is lost, virtue arises;
When virtue is lost, benevolence arises;
When benevolence is lost, righteousness arises;
When righteousness is lost, propriety arises.
Propriety is the attenuation of loyalty and trust—and the beginning of chaos.
Foreknowledge is the flower of the Dao—and the inception of folly.
[Foreknowledge is the exercise of cunning.]

[Flowers are but floating forgetfulness.
Thus, the great man abides in thickness, not in thinness;
Dwells in substance, not in flower.
Therefore, he rejects that and selects this.

[Thickness and substance attend to the inner;
Thinness and flower attend to the outer.
To "reject that and select this" means not to pursue the trappings of propriety and righteousness, but to embrace the Dao.
At the outset of this chapter, Laozi speaks of "highest virtue" not as separate from the Dao, but as the Dao itself.
"Without" and "not present"—this is called the Dao;
What one attains—this is called virtue.
"Highest virtue" is the virtue of attaining the Dao;
"Lower virtue" is the virtue that arises after losing the Dao.
"Highest virtue" requires no thought or effort, for the Dao suffices of itself—thus it is said to "have virtue."
"Lower virtue" strains to seek and barely avoids loss—what virtue is there in this? Thus it is said to "have no virtue."
"Highest virtue" does not lose the Dao, and the Dao is ever non-action, without the intent of non-action.
"Lower virtue" does not lose virtue, but virtue entails action, leaving traces of its intent.
Even in benevolence and righteousness, one cannot escape acting—
Their distinction lies in this: benevolence excels through non-action, while righteousness achieves through action.
As for propriety, its methods of enactment are most elaborate.
When enacted yet unanswered, it rolls up its sleeves and forces compliance—
Forcing compliance, it drifts ever farther from the Dao.
Thus, from the Dao it descends fivefold to propriety.
Propriety ostensibly cultivates loyalty and trust to quell disorder,
Yet when forced compliance meets no response, punishments, weapons, and manifold coercions arise.
Thus, propriety becomes the attenuation of loyalty and trust—and the beginning of chaos.
Just as cunning, meant to guide the foolish, multiplies and confounds the true origin,
Becoming empty and insubstantial, it reverses into the flower of the Dao—and the inception of folly.
Therefore, the great man abides in thickness, not in thinness;
Dwells in substance, not in flower.
He discards false benevolence, abandons righteousness, severs propriety, and forsakes cunning,
Setting his resolve upon the great wholeness of the Dao—
This is called "rejecting that and selecting this."]

**Chapter Thirty-Nine**

Of old, those who attained the One:
Heaven attained the One and became clear;
Earth attained the One and became tranquil;
The spirits attained the One and became numinous;
The valleys attained the One and became full;
The myriad things attained the One and came to life;
The lords and kings attained the One and became the standard for all under heaven.
This is the culmination of attainment.

[Culmination: the utmost extreme.
It means that in reaching this extreme, all are alike.]

If heaven had nothing by which to be clear, it would fear splitting;
If earth had nothing by which to be tranquil, it would fear erupting;
If the spirits had nothing by which to be numinous, they would fear vanishing;
If the valleys had nothing by which to be full, they would fear drying up;
If the myriad things had nothing by which to live, they would fear perishing;
If the lords and kings had nothing by which to be noble and exalted, they would fear toppling.

[Perishing: withering and decay.
Toppling: falling.]

Thus, nobility takes lowliness as its root;
Exaltation takes humility as its foundation.
[There has never been nobility that did not arise from what is noble in itself;
There has never been exaltation that did not emerge from what is high in itself.]

Therefore, the lords and kings call themselves "the orphaned," "the widowed," and "the unworthy."
Is this not taking lowliness as their root? Is it not so?
Thus, when one enumerates the parts of a carriage to their utmost,
There is no carriage.
[Utmost: to reach the limit.
A carriage is a general term; if one enumerates its components—wheels, spokes, hubs, rails—there is no carriage left.]

One does not desire to be resplendent like jade,
Nor to be dull like stone.
[Resplendent: gleaming.
Dull: inert and solitary.
This chapter speaks of the marvel of attaining the Dao.
The Dao is but One.
Heaven’s clarity, earth’s tranquility, the spirits’ numinosity,
The valleys’ fullness, the myriad things’ vitality,
The lords and kings’ preservation of rectitude—
All, in their utmost attainment, issue from this single source.
Without it, heaven would split, earth would erupt,
Spirits would vanish, valleys would dry up,
The myriad things would perish, and lords and kings would lose their exalted station.
For those who would be lords and kings, to perpetuate their nobility,
There is no alternative but to attain the Dao.
Yet where does the Dao reside?
Invisible to sight, intangible in grasp—it is the most subtle under heaven.
Yet precisely in its subtlety lies its manifestness,
Just as nobility takes lowliness as its root, and exaltation takes humility as its foundation.
Consider the lords and kings: in calling themselves "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy,"
Do they not abide in lowliness? And is not the root of nobility here?
Extend this to the utmost, as in enumerating the parts of a carriage:
When each component is counted, the carriage itself ceases to be.
The Dao, too, defies naming—it is like this.
How can one point to it as resplendent like jade or dull like stone,
And thereby distinguish noble from base?]

**Chapter Forty**

**Chapter Forty-One**

The movement of the Dao turns back upon itself—*turning back means returning, returning to stillness.*
The function of the Dao lies in weakness.
All things under heaven arise from Being,
And Being arises from Nonbeing.
*—The above spoke of nobility taking lowliness as its root and exaltation taking humility as its foundation; here, it again takes up movement and stillness, strength and weakness, and further extends this to the origin of Being and Nonbeing. When one’s nature returns, stillness is achieved. Yet when stirred, it responds and penetrates all things under heaven—thus movement arises. The Dao is formless and soundless, the weakest under heaven, yet in its movement through heaven and earth, none can surpass its strength. Hence it is said: "The movement of the Dao turns back upon itself; the function of the Dao lies in weakness." Only after heaven and earth exist do the myriad things come to be—thus it is said: "Things arise from Being." Yet the origin of heaven and earth lies in the Great Void—this is called "Being arises from Nonbeing." As Being and Nonbeing give rise to one another, all is subsumed under the Dao, returning to the discourse in the first chapter on the named and the nameless.*

When superior scholars hear the Dao, they diligently practice it.
When middling scholars hear the Dao, they hold it as if it exists, as if it does not.
When lesser scholars hear the Dao, they laugh loudly at it—
If they did not laugh, it would not suffice as the Dao.
*—Those who diligently practice it hear and necessarily believe. Those who hold it as if it exists, as if it does not, both believe and doubt. Those who laugh do so because they fail to grasp its depth; only when the most ignorant ridicule it does the loftiness of the Dao become apparent. Hence, if they did not laugh, it would not suffice as the Dao.*

Thus, established sayings declare:
*—Established sayings refer to the words set forth by the ancients, as in the following lines—*

The luminous Dao seems obscure;
Advancing in the Dao seems like retreating;
The level Dao seems uneven—*meaning it harmonizes light with dust, blending with the world.*
Supreme virtue seems like a valley;
Great purity seems sullied—*sullied means defiled.*
Vast virtue seems insufficient;
Established virtue seems negligent—*negligent means careless.*
Unalloyed truth seems tarnished—*tarnished means altered.*
The great square has no corners—*the great square refers to the Great Void; corners are the directions of east, west, south, and north.*
The great vessel is late in completion;
The great tone is soundless;
The great image has no form.
The Dao is hidden and nameless.
Yet only the Dao is good at bestowing and bringing to completion—*bestowing means responding to others’ needs and ultimately returning to fulfillment.*

*—This chapter speaks of the difficulty of the world’s belief in the Dao, thus citing the ancients’ discourse on the Dao. Superior scholars know both subtlety and manifestness, so upon hearing the Dao, they diligently practice it. Middling scholars stand between subtlety and manifestness, so upon hearing the Dao, they waver between belief and doubt, holding it as if it exists, as if it does not. Lesser scholars know only manifestness and not subtlety, so upon hearing the Dao, they simply laugh. Only when the most ignorant ridicule it does the loftiness of our Dao become evident—hence, if they did not laugh, it would not suffice as the Dao. Did the ancients who established these sayings not declare: The luminous Dao seems obscure—though it illuminates all, it is not glaring. Advancing in the Dao seems like retreating—though it appears to halt, none advance more swiftly. The level Dao seems uneven—it harmonizes with right and wrong, erasing distinctions between self and other. Supreme virtue seems like a valley—it constantly abides in lowliness, receiving without overflowing. Great purity seems sullied—though dwelling in filth, it remains ultimately unstained. Clothing the world without claiming its benevolence—this is why vast virtue seems insufficient. Nurturing the myriad things as if without intent—this is why established virtue seems negligent. Unalloyed truth does not yield to externals; not yielding to externals means following one’s own course—hence it seems altered. The great square has no corners—this is the Great Void, beyond the directions of east, west, south, and north.*

The Great Void is utterly boundless, without edges or corners—thus the great square has no angles. Like a clumsy craftsman shaping the world, it does not seek quick results—hence the great vessel is late in completion. With the teaching of no-words, it stirs the myriad things, never resorting to petty speech—thus the great sound is silent. In affairs of no-affair, its function remains unseen—hence the great image has no form. In non-action, its essence is unrecognized—thus the Dao is nameless. Only that which excels in aiding and lending to the myriad things without demanding repayment—therefore the myriad things receive their life and formation yet do not know its virtue. Thus it is said: Only the Dao excels in lending and forming.

---

**Chapter Forty-Two**
The Dao gives birth to the One; the One gives birth to the Two; the Two gives birth to the Three; the Three gives birth to the myriad things.
When it is the Dao, the One has not yet arisen. Once there is the One, the Two appears. Where there is yang, there is yin; with yin and yang, there is their interaction—is this not the Three? From the Three, all things emerge without exception.

The myriad things bear yin and embrace yang.
All things have their backs turned to stillness (yin) and their fronts facing activity (yang).

They are harmonized by the qi of the Void coursing between yin and yang.

What people despise are "orphaned," "widowed," and "unworthy," yet kings and lords use these as their titles.
Thus, things may be diminished yet gain, or increased yet lose.

What others teach, I also teach: "The strong and overbearing do not meet a natural death." I take this as the father of all teachings.

---

**Chapter Forty-Three**
The softest under heaven gallops through the hardest. That which has no form enters where there are no gaps.
Through this, I know the benefit of non-action. The teaching of no-words and the benefit of non-action—few in the world can attain them.

Those who study the Dao, knowing the peril of overbearing strength, understand that nothing surpasses the use of softness. Thus, the hard is easily broken, while the soft endures. With the softest advancing through the hardest—like water penetrating stone—one sees that nothing can resist softness. Clinging to form leads to resistance and obstruction; reaching the formless enters into the most solid—like qi pervading the body, as if nothing can withstand it. Observing this, one sees that non-action accomplishes everything—this is the supreme principle. Thus, without speaking, the teaching spreads; without acting, achievements are realized. Who in the world can match this?

---

**Chapter Forty-Four**
Fame or self—which is dearer?
Self or wealth—which is weightier?
Gain or loss—which is more harmful?
Thus, excessive attachment必 incurs great cost. Hoarding much必 leads to heavy loss.
Knowing contentment avoids disgrace. Knowing when to stop avoids danger. This is how one endures long.

---

**Chapter Forty-Five**
Great perfection seems flawed—yet its use is inexhaustible.
Great fullness seems empty—yet its use never ends.
Great straightness seems bent. Great skill seems clumsy. Great eloquence seems inarticulate.
Restlessness overcomes cold. Stillness overcomes heat. Clarity and stillness govern the world rightly.

---

**Chapter Forty-Six**
When the world follows the Dao, warhorses are retired to fertilize fields.
When the world abandons the Dao, warhorses breed in the wilds.
No crime is greater than indulging desires. No disaster is greater than discontent. No fault is greater than the desire to possess.
Thus, the contentment of knowing contentment is true contentment.

When the world has the Dao, swift horses are sent back to plow the fields. When the world lacks the Dao, warhorses are born in the countryside. No sin is greater than having desires one should not. No misfortune is greater than not knowing contentment. No calamity is greater than the desire to acquire. Therefore, knowing contentment’s contentment is always content.

**Chapter Forty-Seven**
Not stepping beyond the door, one knows the world.
Not peering through the window, one sees the Dao of Heaven.
The farther one goes, the less one knows.
Thus, the sage knows without traveling,
names without seeing,
and accomplishes without acting.

This chapter speaks of the sufficiency of the nature’s essence. Though the world is vast, it is but human sentiments and the principles of things. Though one does not step beyond the door, one may yet know them. The Dao of Heaven, though profound in its yin-yang transformations, may yet be seen without peering through the window. If one must go forth to seek knowledge, how much can the feet’s reach encompass? Thus it is said: *The farther one goes, the less one knows.* The sage, abiding in the Dao, knows all without traveling; rooted in the heart, names all without seeing. Thus, all under heaven may be known, and the mysteries of the Dao may be named. Knowing and naming, one accomplishes without acting—letting things follow their natural course.

**Chapter Forty-Eight**
In the pursuit of learning, one daily accumulates.
In the pursuit of the Dao, one daily diminishes.
Diminish and again diminish, until one reaches non-action.
Through non-action, there is nothing left undone.
Thus, those who would take the world do so always through non-affair.
When there is affair, it is not sufficient to take the world.

This chapter speaks of the Dao’s transcendence of action. Learning seeks knowledge, hence daily accumulation. The Dao seeks the removal of delusion, hence daily diminution. If one diminishes and again diminishes until non-action is reached, then reverently governing oneself while entrusting the generation and completion of the myriad things—this is how nothing is left undone. Those who take the world merely receive its submission; if there is no affair, how could there be action? If one harbors the intent to take, then there is the affair of taking, and the world does not submit.

**Chapter Forty-Nine**
The sage has no constant heart,
but takes the heart of the common people as his heart.
The good, I treat with goodness;
the not-good, I also treat with goodness—thus virtue is goodness.
The trustworthy, I trust;
the untrustworthy, I also trust—thus virtue is trust.
The sage, in the world, is unassuming for the world, blending his heart.
The common people all fix their ears and eyes upon him,
and the sage treats them all as children.

This chapter speaks of the sage’s forgetting of the heart. Having no constant heart, he takes the hearts of the common people as his heart—like a mirror, which has no form of its own but takes the form of what it reflects. Thus, the good, I treat with goodness; the not-good, I also treat with goodness—goodness and not-goodness lie with them, while my treatment of them is the same. This may be called the virtue of goodness. The trustworthy, I trust; the untrustworthy, I also trust—trustworthiness and untrustworthiness lie with them, while my trust in them is the same. This may be called the virtue of trust. Thus, the sage is unassuming for the world, blending his heart, so that the good and trustworthy do not become self-satisfied, and the not-good and untrustworthy do not abandon themselves. The common people fix their ears and eyes upon him, observing the sage’s likes and dislikes, yet the sage treats them all as infants—unassuming toward them, not proud of himself, free from resentment, and at ease. All is forgotten, and the world is settled.

**Chapter Fifty**
Emerging into life, entering into death.
Of life’s followers, there are thirteen;
of death’s followers, there are thirteen.
Of those whose lives lead them to death’s ground, there are also thirteen.
Why is this? Because of the thickness of their self-preservation.
Now, it is heard that those skilled in nurturing life,
when traveling on land, do not encounter rhinoceroses or tigers;
when entering battle, do not avoid armor or weapons.
The rhinoceros finds no place to thrust its horn,
the tiger finds no place to sink its claws,
weapons find no place to lodge their blades.
Why is this? Because there is no ground of death in them.

This chapter speaks of the Dao of nurturing life. To use things and absorb their essence for one’s nourishment is to be among life’s followers. To indulge in sounds, colors, scents, and flavors to one’s own harm is to be among death’s followers. Knowing the distinction between life and death yet acting without rest, hastening to one’s end—these are those whose lives lead them to death’s ground. Taking the number of those born in heaven and earth, of ten parts, three belong to life, three to death, and three lead to death’s ground. The remaining one is the Dao of neither life nor death. Why do those who follow life and death not escape life and death? Because they forget their own existence and, prizing life excessively, make it thick. Thus, life itself becomes the ground of death. Those skilled in nurturing life, inwardly seeing no self and outwardly seeing no things—what rhinoceros, what tiger, what armor or weapons are there? Only seeing horns with no place to thrust, claws with no place to sink, blades with no place to lodge. Why? Because there is no ground to contain them. Thus it is said: *Because there is no ground of death in them.*

**Chapter Fifty-One**

The Dao gives them life—
*from emptiness and profundity, the source of all things’ arising.*
Virtue nurtures them—
*from great harmony and intermingling qi, the means by which all things are sustained.*
It shapes them into forms—
*gathering to become visible things.*
It completes them through momentum—
*growing of itself, maturing of itself, the natural unfolding of their power.*

Thus, the myriad things without exception honor the Dao and prize virtue. The Dao’s honor, virtue’s prizing—
*none commands it, yet it is ever spontaneous.*
*All things honor the Dao because it gives life; they prize virtue because it sustains them. None commands it, yet none ceases to act.*

Thus, the Dao gives them life—
*endowing them with its essence is called life.*
Virtue nurtures them—
*enveloping them in its qi is called nurturing.*
It makes them grow—
*bringing their forms to fulfillment is called growth.*
It rears them—
*fostering their capacities is called rearing.*
It brings them to maturity—
*weighing their completion is called maturity.*
It ripens them—
*measuring their use is called ripening.*
It nourishes them—
*preserving their harmony is called nourishment.*
It shelters them—
*warding off harm is called shelter.*
*These seven phrases exhaustively describe the Dao’s subtle work of perfecting the myriad things.*

Giving life yet not possessing,
acting yet not relying,
growing yet not dominating—
this is called *mysterious virtue*.
*Though the Dao gives life, it does not claim possession; though it acts, it does not presume upon its power; though it fosters growth, it leaves things to their nature, never controlling them. Such virtue is beyond human comprehension.*

*This chapter speaks of the Dao’s giving life to the myriad things. The Dao is the mother of all things—without the Dao, nothing is born; without virtue, nothing is sustained. From their taking form to their unfolding power, from growth to completion, all is governed by the Dao and virtue. The Dao’s honor, virtue’s prizing—nothing surpasses this. Yet it does not exalt itself for its honor, nor value itself for its prizing. Its bestowal upon things arises not from intent toward them. None commands it, yet it is ever spontaneous. From birth to nurture, from growth to maturity, from nourishment to shelter—all is spontaneous. Yet it gives life without possession, acts without reliance, fosters growth without domination. What else could this be called but *mysterious virtue*?*

**Chapter Fifty-Two**

The world has a beginning,
which serves as the world’s mother.
*Nameless, it is the beginning of heaven and earth; named, it is the mother of the myriad things. When the Dao is still nameless, it is that upon which things rely to begin; when it has a name, it is that upon which things rely to be born.*

Having attained the mother, one knows her children;
having known the children, one returns to guard the mother—
to the end of life, no peril.
*Mother refers to the Dao; children refer to the myriad things.*

Block the openings, close the gates—
throughout life, no toil.
Open the openings, further affairs—
throughout life, no deliverance.
*When the heart stirs within and one indulges it, this is called “having openings”—one then blocks them and allows no passage. When things draw one outward and one accepts them, this is called “having gates”—one then shuts them and admits nothing. Those who can do this live without labor and accomplish without striving. But if one opens the openings to further affairs, one sinks into ruin with no hope of rescue.*

Seeing the small is called clarity;
guarding the soft is called strength.
*What cannot be perceived by the eye is called small; what cannot be seized by force is called soft.*

Use its light, return to its clarity—
leave no disaster to the self.
This is called *following the constant*.
*Light is the function of clarity; clarity is the essence of light. Using its light to return to clarity is to revert to stillness—how could disaster arise? “Following the constant” means preceding clarity, as in “concealed and not revealed.”*

The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth;
the named is the mother of the ten thousand things.
The Dao is ever nameless, yet serves as the mother of the world—why?
For while the named is the mother of the ten thousand things,
it is not yet sufficient to be the mother of the world.
The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,
and thus from Heaven downward, all things are born of the nameless.
Hence it is said: “The world has a beginning that serves as the mother of the world.”

The sage embodies the Dao to employ things,
having grasped the mother, thereby knows the child—
all is clearly perceived without exception.
Though wisdom may employ them,
it does not forget the Dao through things,
and thus ever guards the mother.
Then who in the world could harm that from which I arise
with that which arises from me?
This is why one remains unharmed throughout life.

How does one guard it?
It is simply a matter of shutting the openings and closing the gates.
When the heart stirs within and one indulges it,
this is called “having openings.”
With openings, the heart goes forth to engage with things.
But if I shut the openings and do not let them through,
they do not go forth.
When things entice from without and one accepts them,
this is called “having gates.”
With gates, things enter and disturb the heart.
But if I close the gates and admit nothing,
things do not enter.
Within, nothing goes forth; without, nothing enters.
Though the ten thousand things teem and transform before one,
how could there be any toil?

Yet if one forgets the Dao and pursues things,
opening the openings without shutting them,
advancing affairs without reducing them,
one will sink into ruin throughout life—
and none can fathom the cause.
Only one who guards the mother
can alone perceive what cannot be seen by the eye—
hence “seeing the small is called clarity.”
Only one who guards the mother
can alone hold fast to what cannot be seized by force—
hence “guarding the soft is called strength.”
Having used its light to illuminate its defenses,
one returns to its clarity to revert to stillness.
Then one never opens the openings or advances affairs
to the point of irretrievable ruin—
how could disaster arise?

Such is the clarity of knowing the constant—
profound and deep, unseen.

**Chapter 53**

Should I possess even the slightest knowledge
and walk the great Dao, I would fear only action.
[Those who embody the Dao have no knowledge, no action,
no defenses against action—yet things transform of themselves.
Now, should one possess even the slightest knowledge
and walk the great Dao, one would engage in contrivance and construction,
departing from naturalness—how could this not be fearful?]

The great Dao is utterly level,
yet the people prefer byways.
[The great Dao is smooth and plain,
but those in the world who do not understand it
deem it circuitous and distant,
preferring shortcuts in pursuit of quick gains.]

The court is excessively adorned,
[fond of construction and embellishment;]
fields lie deeply overgrown,
[usurping the people’s time;]
granaries are utterly empty,
[abandoning fundamental occupations;]
they wear embroidered robes,
[fond of extravagance and artifice;]
bear sharp swords,
[fond of martial prowess;]
surfeit themselves with food and drink,
[fond of gluttony and drunkenness;]
hoard surplus goods,
[fond of amassing wealth—]
this is called the "bandit’s lead flute."
Is this not far from the Dao?
[A *yu* is the leader of the five tones;
when the *yu* sounds, all instruments harmonize.
The "bandit’s lead flute" means bandits follow in its wake.]

[To "see the small is called clarity"—yet this is not true clarity.
For the noble person in relation to the Dao,
if there is no knowledge and no action,
then even myriad changes arrayed before them
cannot disturb their mind—what fear could there be?
Should I, with a mind of even the slightest knowledge,
walk the great Dao,
my knowledge would be limited while the Dao is boundless,
and I would tremble in fear that my actions would fall short—
how could there be no path of peril?
The great Dao is utterly level,
yet the people prefer byways—
those who prefer byways make knowledge their thief.
Thus, when they adorn their courts,
external embellishments arise;
when fields lie waste and granaries are empty,
those who neglect their work multiply.
They then don embroidered robes to impress others,
bear sharp swords to intimidate the crowd,
and amass food, drink, and goods without purpose—
this is the "bandit’s lead flute."
How could this be the Dao?]

**Chapter 54**

What is well established cannot be uprooted;
what is well embraced cannot slip away.
Thus descendants’ sacrifices never cease.
[All things established by construction
are not without uprooting—
only those who practice the Dao,
establishing it in constancy and nothingness,
can be well established without uprooting.
All things held fast by grasping
are not without slipping away—
only those who practice the Dao,
embracing spirit in stillness,
can be well embraced without slipping.
That sacrifices never cease speaks to its unbroken transmission.]

Cultivate it in the self, and its virtue becomes real;
cultivate it in the family, and its virtue overflows;
cultivate it in the village, and its virtue endures;
cultivate it in the state, and its virtue abounds;
cultivate it in the world, and its virtue becomes universal.
[Real means true and without falsity.
Overflow means accumulated and with surplus blessing.
Enduring means extending to others and reaching far.]

Where abundance reaches others, its flourishing grows ever greater;
where universality reaches others, its pervasiveness grows ever more complete.

Thus, observe the self through the self,
observe the family through the family,
observe the village through the village,
observe the state through the state,
observe the world through the world—
[observe the self through the Dao of the self,
observe the family through the Dao of the family,
and by extension, the village, state, and world are all likewise.]

How do I know the world is thus?
By this.
[By this—meaning the Dao.
Observing through the Dao, there is nothing in the world that is not so.]

[This chapter speaks of the practice of virtue. In the world, nothing established does not uproot, nothing embraced does not slip away—only the sage, harmonizing the truth of human nature and discerning the falsity of things, relinquishes externals to cultivate the self. Their virtue fills and accumulates, truly without anything established yet their establishment cannot be uprooted; truly without anything grasped yet their embrace cannot slip away. This is why their transmission endures through generations without end.

Those in the world who speak of cultivating virtue may practice it in the world, state, or family yet fail to recognize that its root and truth lie in the self. Or they may cultivate it in the self yet cannot extend it to family, state, or world, not realizing that only by proceeding from family to the world can their virtue’s reach become universal.

How, then, does the sage cultivate it?
It is simply this: observe the self through the self.
What does it mean to observe the self through the self?
Observe from whence all that the self possesses arises,
and you will know the source of the self’s being.
Then observe from whence the self’s power of observation arises,
and you will know the source of observation itself.

Extend this to observing the family through the family,
the village through the village,
the state through the state,
the world through the world—
none are otherwise.
How, then, do I know the world’s thusness?
Simply by this Dao.
Is it not because the essence of this Dao encompasses all,
and the function of this Dao reaches everywhere?]

Chapter Fifty-Five

One whose virtue is profoundly accumulated resembles an infant—
[Such virtue is stored and nurtured without outward display.
"Profound" means ultimate; when virtue is contained to its utmost,
it is like an infant.]

Poisonous creatures do not sting them,
fierce beasts do not seize them,
birds of prey do not strike them.
[Poisonous creatures—such as scorpions—use their tails to deliver venom, called *stinging*.
Fierce beasts—such as tigers and leopards—use their claws to grasp, called *seizing*.
Birds of prey—such as eagles and ospreys—use their talons to strike, called *striking*.]

Their bones are weak, their sinews soft, yet their grip is firm.
They know not the union of male and female, yet their organ stirs—
such is the perfection of their essence.
[The grip of four fingers around the thumb is called *firm grip*.
The infant’s organ is the yang aspect; both firm grip and stirring arise from the abundance of essence and qi.]

They cry all day yet do not grow hoarse—
such is the perfection of their harmony.
[Hoarseness means a rasping voice.
Not growing hoarse arises from the absence of joy or anger, for their qi is fundamentally harmonious.]

To know harmony is to be constant.
[To understand this principle of perfect harmony is to abide in constancy without change.]

To know constancy is called clarity.
[To understand this principle of constancy is to attain clarity in the Dao.]

To forcefully augment life is called ominous.
[Life cannot be forcibly augmented; striving to do so harms it, hence it is called a portent of misfortune.]

To use the mind to direct qi is called coercion.
[Using the mind to direct qi is to stir it, hence it is called violent.]

When things reach their prime, they age—
this is called not following the Dao.
What does not follow the Dao perishes early.
[Coercion inevitably leads to fracture, just as things at their prime inevitably age.
None of these accord with the Dao, so they swiftly perish—cease them before they arise.]

[The noble person cultivates virtue and naturally comes to embody it.]

At the dawn of human life, one’s virtue and nature are most profound. Yet as one grows, the ears and eyes turn outward while the mind’s perceptions turn inward—thus what was once profound becomes shallow. Those who practice the Dao reduce and reduce again until virtue returns to its original state. Hence it is said: *"One who embodies profound virtue is like a newborn babe."*

The newborn has no mind; without mind, nothing can oppose it. Thus, venomous creatures do not sting it, fierce beasts do not seize it, and birds of prey do not strike it—how could harm come to it? The infant does not grasp intentionally, yet its fists remain clenched; it does not know the union of male and female, yet its organ stirs—this is because its essence is full, not because of any deliberate thought. If the infant were to possess even the slightest awareness of taking or giving, its nature would no longer be unified but coarse. Could it remain thus?

Moreover, it feels neither joy nor anger, so though it cries all day, its voice does not grow hoarse—this is because its mind remains unmoved and its qi harmonious. If the infant were to feel joy or anger, its qi would turn harsh and lose harmony. Could it remain thus? Therefore, one who understands the principle of supreme harmony may be called constant. One who understands this constant Dao may be called clear.

Knowing constancy, one follows nature without forcibly augmenting life. Acting without contrivance, moving without fixed direction—why would one use the mind to direct qi? Life cannot be augmented; to desire augmentation is to invite calamity. Qi detests reckless action, and if the mind further compels it, violence becomes extreme.

To attain emptiness and abide in softness—this is the Dao. The Dao endures, and the body does not perish. But to become full and rigid is to become a mere thing. Things reach their prime and then age—such is their way. Thus, cease such actions before they arise.

Chapter Fifty-Six

Those who know do not speak;
those who speak do not know.
[This means the Dao cannot be contained in words.]

Block the openings,
[the heart does not issue forth;]
shut the gates,
[things do not enter.]

Blunt the sharpness,
[temper what is within;]
untie the tangles,
[order what is without.]

Soften the light,
[restrain what is in oneself;]
mingle with the dust,
[follow what is in things.]

This is called the mysterious sameness—
[no issuing forth, no entering,
no within, no without,
no self, no things.
This is what is meant by the principle of supreme sameness, thus and so.]

It cannot be made close,
cannot be made distant;
[it covers all things equally—who is close, who is distant?]

It cannot be benefited,
cannot be harmed;
[it regards compliance and opposition equally—what is benefit, what is harm?]

It cannot be honored,
cannot be debased;
[it knows no glory or disgrace—what is honor, what is debasement?]

Therefore, it is honored by all under heaven.
[This is why the Dao is honored by all under heaven.]

[To know constancy is to reach the utmost of knowledge.
Reaching the utmost of knowledge, one accomplishes in silence and nothing is unordered.]

What room is there for speech? If one cannot but speak, this shows one has never truly known. Blocking the senses and closing the gates was already set forth in Chapter Fifty-Two—yet there, the Dao was condensed into purity and stillness to block the roots of craving and delight, while here, the Dao is upheld in wordlessness to accord with the principle of diminishing hearing and discarding sight. The Dao is formless; it cannot be seen with the eyes or transmitted by the mouth. This is how the perfected person’s mind merges with the Dao’s mystery, naturally blocking the senses and closing the gates.

Blunting sharpness, untying tangles, blending radiance, and merging with dust were already set forth in Chapter Four—yet there, the Dao was applied to enact its work, while here, the person is taken as the basis to clarify conduct. When the perfected person shares a single mind with all under heaven yet remains without knowledge, and shares a single body with the Dao yet remains without form, how can there be any mind of sharp advance or tangled disorder? How can any intent of radiance or dust, of distinction, arise? This is called the Dao of merging being and non-being, the principle of supreme sameness, thus and so.

Thus, there is nothing excessively close, nothing excessively distant—so it cannot be made close or distant. Not pursuing profit, not avoiding harm—so it cannot be benefited or harmed. Not glorying in success, not shamed by failure—so it cannot be honored or debased. That which can be made close or distant, benefited or harmed, honored or debased is valued in things, and things can debase it. That which cannot be made close or distant, benefited or harmed, honored or debased is valued in oneself, and things cannot debase it. Is it not fitting that it be honored by all under heaven?

Chapter 57
Govern the state with uprightness, employ the military with stratagem.
[The sage pacifies the distant and cherishes the near, never intending to use force—only when unavoidable does he resort to punitive expeditions. Thus, governing the state must be done with uprightness, employing the military must be done with stratagem.]

He who takes the world without contention
[remains vast and unoccupied, and the world of itself submits to him.]

How do I know that the world is so?
[How do I know that non-action suffices to take the world? The following text accordingly sets forth the harm of action to make it clear.]

The more taboos there are in the world, the poorer the people grow.
[When those above abound in taboos, the conditions below cannot ascend, and the people become impoverished and without recourse.]

The more sharp instruments the people possess, the more benighted the state becomes.
[Sharp instruments are cunning and schemes. When the sage is above, he constantly ensures the people remain without knowledge or desire. When the people abound in schemes, their superiors become blinded and benighted.]

The more people value skill and craft, the more strange things arise.
[When people neglect fundamental occupations and pursue peripheral skills, useless and extraordinary things proliferate.]

The more laws and decrees are promulgated, the more thieves and bandits appear.
[When one fears the people’s deceit and fraud and enacts many laws to overcome them, the people find no place for their hands and feet and daily fall into banditry.]

Therefore the sage says:
I practice non-action, and the people of themselves are transformed.
I delight in stillness, and the people of themselves are upright.
I engage in no affairs, and the people of themselves become prosperous.
I have no desires, and the people of themselves become simple.
[This is the proof that non-action suffices to take the world.]

[This chapter speaks of governing the state. Those who govern the state must not be constantly and long desirous of employing uprightness rather than stratagem. Uprightness establishes the enduring norm for all ages. Employing the military is an unavoidable affair, thus one uses stratagem rather than uprightness. Stratagem responds to the exigencies of the moment. Now, he who does not govern the state with cleverness is the state’s blessing. Governing the state without employing cleverness means that non-action suffices to take the world—this is clear. How then do I know that non-action suffices to take the world? Precisely because action does not suffice to take the world that I know it. Only when one departs from non-action and arrives at action do the following arise in the world: many taboos to avoid what is detested, leading to widespread loss of livelihood and increasing poverty among the people; many sharp instruments to pursue what is desired, making the lower ranks inscrutable and the state increasingly benighted. When the people grow poorer, they devise more cunning schemes; when the state grows benighted, strange things compete to arise—this is the reason laws and decrees proliferate. Yet laws forbid only what falls under their purview and cannot forbid what lies beyond their reach; decrees are enforced only where they are heeded and cannot be enforced where they are ignored—this is why thieves and bandits abound. In such cases, all are the faults of employing action to take the world. Therefore the sage says: I practice non-action, and the people of themselves are transformed; I delight in stillness, and the people of themselves are upright; I engage in no affairs, and the people of themselves become prosperous; I have no desires, and the people of themselves become simple—this is the proof that taking the world is always accomplished through non-action. From non-action comes delight in stillness. Only through non-action do the people of themselves transform and abandon skill and craft; through delight in stillness do the people of themselves become upright and thieves and bandits vanish. From non-action and delight in stillness come non-affairs and non-desire. Through non-affairs do the people of themselves become prosperous and free from the poverty of taboos; through non-desire do the people of themselves become simple and free from the benightedness of sharp instruments. Such is the Dao.] Chapter 58

The governance is dull and murky, and the people are simple and content—dull and murky means not employing keen perception; simple and content means finding joy in themselves. The governance is sharp and exacting, and the people are lacking and deficient—sharp and exacting means being vexatious and oppressive; lacking and deficient means being insufficient.

Disaster, ah!—fortune leans upon it.
Fortune, ah!—disaster lurks within it.
Who knows their ultimate end?
There is no fixed norm.

The norm reverts to become the strange;
the good reverts to become the ominous.
The people’s delusion—
how long it has endured!

Thus the sage is square but does not cut,
has edges but does not wound,
is straight but does not stretch,
is luminous but does not dazzle.

Governing the state with uprightness and taking the world through non-affairs, the governance becomes dull and murky, and so the people remain simple and untainted by shallowness. Governing the state with cunning and making the world through affairs, the governance becomes sharp and exacting, and so the people become lacking and fail to preserve their simplicity. Why is this? Because times have beginnings and ends, and the world undergoes transformations—what is thwarted in one age may be fitting in another. What is thwarted is what the world calls disaster, yet what is fitting is where fortune leans. What is fitting is what the world calls fortune, yet what is thwarted is where disaster lurks. In this, none can know the limit or the end—who indeed can fix it?

Moreover, what is now upright may later become perverse; what is now perverse may elsewhere become upright. The same holds for good and ominous—thus the world’s fortune and disaster, uprightness and perversity, good and ominous cannot truly be fixed. Since the people first gained knowledge, they have been deluded and clung to distinctions—how long it has been! Why then burden them further with sharp and exacting governance, preventing them from returning to their simplicity?

Thus the sage is square but does not cut, so he does not impose a single judgment to benefit the world; has edges but does not wound, so he overcomes things without harming them; is straight but does not stretch, so he can bend to preserve integrity and straighten the crooked; is luminous but does not dazzle, so he employs his light yet ultimately returns to clarity. This is no other than embracing the dull and murky while abandoning the sharp and exacting. Chapter 59

Governing people and serving Heaven—nothing surpasses frugality. [Outwardly for governing people and inwardly for serving Heaven, nothing compares to frugality. Frugality means vigilance within and restraint without, where the inner heart does not wander and the outer mind does not arise.]

Only frugality is called "early compliance," which is termed "layering virtue." [Compliance means inwardly submitting the heart and outwardly submitting the form—early, without delay. Only by layering virtue does one first accumulate and then nurture with frugality, thus further accumulating it.]

Layering virtue leads to invincibility; being invincible means none can fathom its limit. [Invincibility means nothing can overcome it; none can fathom its limit means its use is inexhaustible.]

None can fathom its limit, and thus one may possess a state; possessing the mother of the state, one may endure long. [The Dao is the mother of all things; thus, attaining the Dao, one may possess a state and endure long.]

This is called "deep roots and firm foundation, the Dao of long life and enduring vision." [Roots and foundation are the primordial qi. Roots run deep and cannot be obstructed; the foundation is firm and cannot be uprooted—thus one may indeed attain long life and enduring vision.]

[This chapter speaks of governing people and serving Heaven. If one governs people without employing what makes them human, the people cannot be governed. If one serves Heaven without employing what makes it Heaven, Heaven cannot be served. The spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, transforming and nurturing the myriad things—this is called "sharing the name of the Lord." What makes humans human and Heaven Heaven is this. The pure and unadorned Dao guards only the spirit; guarding it without loss, one becomes one with it—how then could people not be governed or Heaven not be served? Thus it is said: nothing surpasses frugality.

Only by being frugal with one’s spirit and not squandering it can one achieve early compliance. If one is not frugal and expends it to the point of spiritual exhaustion and vital depletion, even if one wishes to return to one’s spirit, there will be no way to enter—is this not too late? Thus it is said: only frugality is called early compliance.

Human life is inherently sufficient in virtue. If one can truly be frugal and achieve early compliance, one gains daily enrichment and fullness. Thus it is said: this is termed layering virtue. Layering virtue means no one can afflict and nothing can harm—where then could one not prevail? If there were something one could not prevail over, the Dao would have its limit; being invincible, who could know its limit?

Thus, one may indeed possess a state. The Dao is the mother of all things; attaining its mother, one knows its children; knowing its children, one preserves its mother—body and life are not endangered. Thus it is said: one may endure long.

Therefore, frugality as the Dao is called deep roots and firm foundation, the Dao of long life and enduring vision. The spirit is the root of life; being frugal and storing it, the roots deepen and life endures. Long life is the foundation of vision; guarding and protecting it, the foundation is firm and vision endures.]

Chapter 60

Governing a great state is like cooking a small fish. Cooking a small fish—if one stirs it, it breaks apart; governing a great state—if one disturbs it, it falls into chaos. Stillness and non-action, tranquility and non-interference—this is the Way of governing a state.

With the Dao one oversees the world, and its spirits do not act as spirits. It is not that its spirits are not spirit-like, but that their spirit-like power does not harm people. It is not that their spirit-like power does not harm people—even the sage does not harm them. Since the sage does not harm people, their spirit-like power does not harm people. As the two do not harm one another, their powers intermingle and return together.

The reason spirits and demons do not harm one another is due to the presence of the sage above; thus, their powers intermingle and return to the sage.

Attaining the mother of the state to govern it, though the state be great, there is nothing to observe. Cooking a small fish—one cannot stir it; governing a great state—one cannot trouble it. Troubling it wearies the people; stirring it breaks the fish apart—this is the inevitable principle.

The sage, overseeing the world with the Dao, practices non-action and non-affair, so that people externally have nothing to disturb them and internally have nothing to fear. Then, nothing can encroach upon them. When this reaches its utmost, even its ghosts do not act as spirits. Why is this said? The Way of ghosts is not without spirit-like power, yet the reason they do not act as spirits is that yin and yang are harmonious and still, the six qi are balanced, the myriad things are all as they should be, and the multitudes of living beings do not die prematurely—thus, their spirit-like power does not harm people.

Yet it is not merely that their spirit-like power does not harm people. The reason they do not harm people is that the sage, overseeing the world with the Dao, ensures people do not lose their nature through excess, do not alter their virtue, and do not disrupt the harmony of yin and yang with great joy or great anger. Thus, the sage also does not harm people.

If the sage were to fail to preserve people’s uncarved simplicity and harm them, causing people to lose their nature, so that the four seasons fell out of order and the harmony of cold and heat was disrupted, then the harm done to people would be great. How could the spirits then refrain from harming people?

Only when governance is great and affairs are subtle, when spirits and the sage do not harm one another, do people’s hearts intermingle and return to them. Without utmost virtue, how could this be so?

**Chapter 61**
The great state is the lower current—
[All under heaven flows toward the great state as all waters rush to the lower current.]
All under heaven converges—
[Convergence means defense.]
All under heaven is the female—
[The great state takes the female as its position.]
The female overcomes the male with stillness—
[The female moves, the male is still; stillness receives benefit, thus it is said the female overcomes.]
Stillness is below—
[The moving is below, the still is below; thus stillness is below.]
Therefore, if the great state humbles itself before the small state, it gains the small state’s allegiance—
[Humbling is self-effacement; gaining the small state means the small state submits to it.]
If the small state humbles itself before the great state, it gains the great state’s acceptance—
[Gaining the great state means the great state embraces it.]
Thus, some humble themselves to gain—
[Humbling to gain the small state’s submission.]
Some humble themselves and are gained—
[Humbling to be embraced by the great state.]
The great state desires only to nurture others—
[Nurture means to care for them.]
The small state desires only to serve others—
[Serving the great state to secure its own peace.]
Both obtain what they desire, so the greater should be the one to humble itself.
[This chapter uses the great and small states as metaphors for those who know the Dao: they should be humble and still. If the great state can lower itself, it can unite all under heaven in convergence. Its humility is like the female, which overcomes the male through stillness. Only stillness and humility allow the female to prevail. Those who follow the Dao emulate this. Thus, when the great state humbles itself before the small state, it necessarily gains the small state’s allegiance; when the small state humbles itself before the great state, it necessarily gains the great state’s acceptance. Whether humbling to gain or humbling to be gained, each secures the other’s heart. The great state desires only to nurture others; the small state desires only to serve. When both can humble themselves, each obtains what it desires. Therefore, those who know the Dao and are great should take humility as their proper course.]

**Chapter 62**
The Dao is the profound mystery of the ten thousand things—
[The innermost chamber is deep and can conceal.]
The treasure of the good—
[The worthy take the Dao as their treasure.]
The refuge of the unworthy—
[The unworthy are preserved by the Dao.]
Fine words can be traded in the marketplace—
[Market means to sell.]
Exalted conduct can be imposed upon others—
[Those whose conduct is exalted are revered by others.]
Why would one who is not good be cast aside?
[Those who possess the Dao have a capacity like heaven and earth, thus they do not cast aside the unworthy.]
Therefore, in establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, though one may offer a large jade disk followed by a team of four horses, it is not as good as sitting and presenting this Dao—
[A large jade disk is a precious treasure; a team of four horses is fine steeds. Though one may present these, they are not as valuable as presenting the Dao.]
Why did the ancients value this Dao?
Did they not say: through seeking, one obtains—
[That is, the treasure of the good.]
Through it, one with transgressions is spared—
[That is, the refuge of the unworthy.]
Thus it is prized by all under heaven.
[This chapter speaks of the value of the Dao. The Dao is the source of the ten thousand things, like the innermost chamber that conceals things. The good take the Dao as their treasure; the unworthy are preserved by the Dao. In the Dao, there is originally no distinction between good and unworthy. In the world, fine words can be traded, and exalted conduct can be imposed upon others. Those who possess the Dao are not merely comparable to fine words or exalted conduct. Even if others are not good, the Dao naturally preserves them—why would they be cast aside? In establishing the Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Dukes, the intent is to save others through the Dao. Though one may present precious jade and fine steeds, it is not as good as presenting this Dao. Why did the ancients value this Dao? Because the good naturally attain their goodness, and even the unworthy are moved to reform and avoid transgression. Thus, it is prized by all under heaven.]

**Chapter 63**
Act without acting—
[Only by acting without acting can one achieve all things.]
Attend to affairs without affairs—
[Only by attending to affairs without affairs can one accomplish tasks.]
Taste without tasting—
[Only by tasting what is attached to taste can one know taste.]
Great and small, many and few—
[This encompasses the quantities of all things.]
Repay resentment with virtue—
[Forgetting resentment, one sees only virtue and not resentment.]
Plan for difficulty while it is easy—
[Plan before difficulty arises.]
Act on the great while it is small—
[Act before it becomes great.]
The difficult affairs of the world necessarily arise from the easy;
The great affairs of the world necessarily arise from the small—
[Arise means to begin.]
Thus the sage never acts on the great and so can accomplish the great—
[Acting on the great while it is small, thus not acting on the great but accomplishing greatness.]
One who makes promises lightly will surely lack trust—
[Speaking lightly, one may not fulfill them.]
One who treats things lightly will surely encounter many difficulties—
[Seeing things as easy, one may not complete them.]
Thus the sage treats things as difficult—
[Treats them as difficult before they arise.]
And so ultimately encounters no difficulty—
[Ultimately, no difficulty appears.]
[This chapter speaks of the Dao residing in non-action, not in careless intent. Act in what is non-action, attend to what is non-affair, taste what is non-taste. When all under heaven is clear and still, nothing is not upright. The sage, facing the myriad things—great and small, many and few—cannot enumerate them. Even regarding resentment: the world repays resentment with resentment; the sage responds with virtue, embracing and transforming. How can resentment be repaid? Extending this principle, how can one fear encountering difficulty or neglecting the great? Yet the world is not without difficulty or great affairs. If one plans only after difficulty arises or acts only after it becomes great, it cannot be planned or accomplished. If one plans for difficulty while it is easy and acts on the great while it is small, nothing will not be achieved. Only by knowing that difficulty necessarily arises from the easy and the great necessarily arises from the small can the sage act on the great while it is small, not acting on the great in its greatness. This is what is meant by "never acting on the great and so accomplishing the great." One who makes promises lightly will exceed what is proper and lose trust. One who treats affairs lightly will often fail to complete them. The sage, before affairs arise, always treats them as difficult—not making them difficult, but treating them as difficult while they are easy, not waiting until they are difficult. Thus, ultimately, there is no difficulty.]

Chapter Sixty-Four

What is at rest is easy to hold;
When it is at rest, it is easy to hold—when danger arises and one seeks to hold it, it becomes difficult.
What has not yet shown signs is easy to plan for;
What has no form is easy to plan for—when affairs have no form, they are easy to plan for. Once their form appears, planning becomes difficult.
What is fragile is easy to break;
Fragile means not yet firm. *Pan* means to break.
What is at the point of arising is easy to prevent;
*Fang* means not yet manifest.
Act on things before they arise;
If one does not take them as things to be acted upon, the world will ultimately know no trouble. Once trouble arises, the more one acts, the more trouble there will be.
Govern before disorder arises;
If one governs with non-governance, the world governs itself. Once disorder has arisen, the more one governs, the more disorder there will be.
A tree of arm-spanning girth grows from the tiniest shoot;
A tree of arm-spanning girth is great indeed. *Haomo* refers to the moment of its first sprouting—showing that the great arises from the small.
A nine-tiered terrace rises from a mound of earth;
*Pilei* means to accumulate earth from level ground—showing that height arises from the low.
A journey of a thousand *li* begins beneath one’s feet;
*Beneath one’s feet* refers to the moment one first sets out—showing that the distant arises from the near.
Those who act fail in it;
Those who act upon things, seeking to complete them, bring about failure instead.
Those who grasp lose it;
The more firmly one grasps, the more easily one loses.
Thus the sage, through non-action, knows no failure; through non-grasping, knows no loss.
In their undertakings, the people always fail when on the verge of success.
Be as cautious at the end as at the beginning, and there will be no failed affairs.
Thus the sage desires not to desire, and does not prize goods hard to obtain;
Taking non-desire as desire, he never prizes goods hard to obtain.
He learns not to learn, returning to what the multitude pass by;
Taking non-learning as learning, he remedies the multitude’s error of pursuing the superficial and multiplying affairs.
He relies on the self-so of the ten thousand things and does not dare to act.
This chapter illuminates the subtlety of the Dao’s foreknowledge. Only when at rest is it easy to hold; only when not yet showing signs is it easy to plan for; only what is fragile is easy to break; only what is at the point of arising is easy to prevent. Thus, in affairs, one should act before they arise; in governing disorder, one should act before it begins. Now, a tree of arm-spanning girth is the greatest, yet it arises from the small; a nine-tiered terrace is the highest, yet it rises from the low.

And it arises from the low; a journey of a thousand *li* is the farthest, yet it begins with a single step. Thus one knows that the coming of order and chaos, fortune and misfortune—all their subtleties arise in this way, yet none can be grasped with deliberate intent. The world does not understand this, believing that non-action fails to accomplish, that non-grasping fails to secure, and so persists until defeat and loss are inevitable. The sage alone acts through non-action, grasps through non-grasping—how then could defeat or loss ever reach him? The people in their affairs commonly fail at the point of near-completion, for they act with deliberate intent. But to act through non-action and thereby maintain vigilance—if one is as vigilant at the end as at the beginning, there can be no failure. Thus the sage desires non-desire, learns non-learning, inwardly and outwardly empty and luminous, vast and free of action, relying solely on the self-so of the ten thousand things to accomplish his work. This is nothing other than his ability to illumine their subtleties.

**Chapter Sixty-Five**
Those of old who were adept in the Dao did not use it to enlighten the people but to make them simple. The people are difficult to govern because of their many wiles. Therefore, to govern the state with wiles is the state’s bane; to govern the state without wiles is the state’s blessing. To know these two is also a model. To know the model is called profound virtue. Profound virtue is deep, far-reaching—so deep it penetrates below, so far-reaching it encompasses all. It moves counter to things, yet attains great compliance.

---

**Chapter Sixty-Six**
The reason rivers and seas can be kings of the hundred valleys is that they are good at placing themselves below. Thus they can be kings of the hundred valleys. Therefore, if the sage wishes to be above the people, he must in his speech place himself below; if he wishes to lead the people, he must in his person place himself behind. Thus, though he dwells above, the people do not feel his weight; though he stands before, the people do not feel harmed. Therefore the world delights in exalting him and never tires of it. Because he does not contend, no one in the world can contend with him.

**Chapter Sixty-Seven**
All under heaven say that my Dao is great and seems to resemble nothing. Precisely because it is the Dao, it seems to resemble nothing. If it resembled anything, long before now it would have been small.

Now, that all under heaven say my Dao is great yet seems to resemble nothing—this is no cause for wonder. I possess three treasures, which I hold fast and cherish:

The first is called *compassion*—love for all things.
The second is called *frugality*—restraint and moderation.
The third is called *not daring to be first in the world*—refusing to contend with others.

Through compassion, one attains courage—for compassion is yielding, and yielding overcomes the rigid, thus it is courage.
Through frugality, one attains abundance—for frugality avoids waste, and without waste, one is ever sufficient, thus it is abundance.
Through not daring to be first in the world, one becomes the completion of all vessels and their leader—for *vessel* means form, and *leader* means ruler. Whatever achieves form, I call its ruler; thus it is the completion of all vessels and their leader.

Now, if one abandons compassion yet seeks courage,
abandons frugality yet seeks abundance,
abandons humility yet seeks precedence,
this is death.

For in battle, compassion brings victory;
in defense, it brings firmness.
Heaven will save such a one, guarding them with compassion.

This chapter expounds how the Dao sustains the world. When people see that my Dao is great yet claim it resembles nothing, what could the Dao resemble? The Dao transcends all things, and thus nothing resembles it. If it resembled anything, then something would exist outside the Dao—how then could it be great? Therefore, only because the Dao is great does it seem to resemble nothing. If it resembled anything, long before now it would have been small.

Indeed, the reason the Dao is so great is that I possess three treasures, which I hold and cherish. The first is compassion; the second, frugality; the third, not daring to take precedence in the world. These three are what the people of the world do not value. What they value are courage, expansiveness, and bold advancement. Yet who knows that through compassion one attains courage, through frugality one attains abundance, and by not daring to take precedence one becomes the completion of all vessels and their leader? Now, if one abandons compassion and frugality, forsaking humility to pursue courage, abundance, and precedence, one will surely be resented by others—such a one is but a corpse awaiting death. For compassion as the Dao treats all things as parents love their children; though one may die for it, one does not refuse. Thus, in battle, it brings victory; in defense, it brings firmness. Heaven will save such a person, guarding them with compassion. If one is compassionate in all things, then all things will become one’s protectors.

**Chapter Sixty-Eight**
The skilled warrior is not martial;
The skilled fighter is not enraged;
The skilled conqueror does not contend;
The skilled employer of others places himself below them.
This is called the virtue of non-contention;
This is called employing the strength of others;
This is called matching Heaven—
The ultimate of antiquity.

---

**Chapter Sixty-Nine**
In the use of arms, there is a saying:
I dare not act as the host but prefer to be the guest;
I dare not advance an inch but would rather retreat a foot.
This is called advancing without advancing,
Repelling without arms,
Seizing without enemies,
Wielding without weapons.
There is no greater disaster than underestimating the enemy;
Underestimating the enemy nearly costs me my treasures.
Thus, when evenly matched armies meet,
The side that grieves will prevail.

---

**Chapter Seventy**
My words are very easy to know and very easy to practice,
Yet none in the world can know them or practice them.
Words have their lineage;
Affairs have their ruler.
It is only because of ignorance that they do not know me.
Those who know me are rare—
Thus I am esteemed.
Therefore, the sage wears coarse cloth while holding jade.

---

**Chapter Seventy-One**
To know yet to seem not to know is supreme;
Not to know yet to claim to know is a flaw.
Only by recognizing this flaw as a flaw
Can one avoid the flaw.
The sage is without flaw
Because he recognizes the flaw as a flaw—
Thus he is without flaw.

---

**Chapter Seventy-Two**
When the people do not fear authority,
Then great authority arrives.
Do not constrict their dwelling;
Do not stifle their livelihood.
Only by not stifling them
Will they not be stifled.
Therefore, the sage knows himself but does not display himself;
Loves himself but does not exalt himself.
Thus, he discards the latter and embraces the former.

**Chapter Seventy-Three**
To be brave in daring is to invite death;
To be brave in not daring is to live.
These two may bring either benefit or harm—
Yet what the Dao abhors,
Who knows the reason?
Thus even the sage finds it difficult.

The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory;
Does not speak yet excels in response;
Is not summoned yet arrives of itself;
Is unhurried yet excels in planning.
The net of Heaven is vast and wide—
Though its mesh seems loose, nothing slips through.

**Chapter Seventy-Four**
If the people do not fear death,
How can death be used to frighten them?
If one could make the people always fear death,
Then those who act perversely—
Could I seize and kill them, who would dare resist?

Yet there is always One who presides over killing.
To kill in place of this One
Is like taking the place of a master carpenter to hew wood—
Few who do so avoid injuring their own hands.

**Chapter Seventy-Five**
The people’s hunger
Comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—
Thus they starve.
The people’s unruliness
Comes from their rulers’ meddling—
Thus they are hard to govern.
The people’s disregard for death
Comes from their rulers’ lavish self-indulgence—
Thus they treat death lightly.
Only those who do not strive to preserve life
Are wiser than those who prize life.

**Chapter Seventy-Six**
When alive, humans are supple and weak;
When dead, stiff and strong.
When alive, plants are tender and fragile;
When dead, withered and dry.
Thus the stiff and strong are companions of death;
The supple and weak are companions of life.
Therefore, when weapons are strong, they do not prevail;
When trees are strong, they are felled.
The strong and great dwell below;
The supple and weak dwell above.

**Chapter Seventy-Seven**
The Dao of Heaven—
Is it not like the drawing of a bow?
What is high is pressed down;
What is low is lifted up.
What has excess is reduced;
What is deficient is supplemented.
The Dao of Heaven reduces excess
And supplements deficiency.
The way of humans is not so:
It reduces the deficient
To serve the excessive.
Who can take their excess
And offer it to the world?
Only those who possess the Dao.
Thus the sage acts without presuming,
Accomplishes without claiming credit—
Is it not that he does not wish to display his worth?

**Chapter Seventy-Eight**
Nothing in the world is softer or weaker than water,
Yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong—
For there is nothing that can replace it.
Thus the weak overcomes the strong;
The soft overcomes the hard.
None in the world does not know this,
Yet none can practice it.
Therefore the sage says:
“One who bears the state’s disgrace
Is called the lord of the altars of soil and grain;
One who bears the state’s misfortunes
Is called the king of all under Heaven.”
True words seem contrary.

**Chapter Seventy-Nine**
When great resentment is reconciled,
Some resentment necessarily remains.
How can this be considered good?
Thus the sage holds the left tally
And does not demand from others.
Those with virtue oversee the tally;
Those without virtue oversee exactions.
The Dao of Heaven shows no partiality—
It always aligns with the good.

**Chapter Eighty**
Let the state be small, its people few.
Let there be tools enough for tens or hundreds,
Yet let them not be used.
Let the people regard death as weighty
And not wander far.
Though there be boats and carriages,
None will ride them;
Though there be armor and weapons,
None will display them.
Let the people return to knotting cords for records.
Let them savor their food,
Admire their clothing,
Feel at ease in their homes,
Delight in their customs.
Though neighboring states are within sight,
And the sounds of their dogs and chickens are heard,
The people will grow old and die
Without ever visiting one another.

**Chapter Eighty-One**

Truthful words are not fine;
Fine words are not truthful.
[Truthful words are those of substance; fine words are those of ornament.]
Good words are not contentious;
Contentious words are not good.
[Good words are those of purity; contentious words are those of display.]

The knowing are not broadly learned;
The broadly learned do not know.
[Knowing is to know the Dao; broad learning is to know many things.]

The sage does not accumulate.
[Empty as a valley.]
Having acted for others, they possess even more;
Having given to others, they have even greater abundance.
[They employ their abilities to act for others;
They extend what they have to give to others.]

The Dao of Heaven benefits and does not harm.
[To intentionally benefit things is to bring both harm and benefit;
The movement of Heaven is without intention—only its benefit is seen.]
The Dao of the sage acts and does not contend.
[Intentional action gives rise to contention;
Action without intention—where is there contention to be found?]

[The *Daodejing* takes non-contention as its central theme,
Thus, in concluding the text, it employs truthfulness to instruct people
and returns to the principle of non-contention.
Truthfulness can be relied upon and needs no embellishment—
hence, truthful words are not fine.
Fine words, however, are overly adorned and cannot be trusted.
Goodness accords with principle and needs no display—
hence, good words are not contentious.
Contentious words, however, are overly emphatic and cannot be good.
Knowing the constant is singular and needs no broad learning—
hence, the knowing are not broadly learned.
Those who are broadly learned, however, wander externally and may not know the Dao.
The Dao of the sage is to reject sagacity and discard knowledge,
emptied and open in all four directions—this is non-accumulation.
Yet in supplying the needs of the myriad things with perfect emptiness,
acting for others brings ever greater possession,
and giving to others brings ever greater abundance—
this is the marvel of emptiness that does not deplete and movement that ever arises.

For the sage shares the workings of Heaven.
The Dao of Heaven, though it possesses fine benefits, does not speak of them—
thus, only its benefit is seen, without harm.
The Dao of the sage acts without acting exhaustively
and never relies on what it possesses—
thus, it does not contend with things,
and none in the world can contend with it.
This is how the Dao of the sage aligns with Heaven
and why non-contention is its treasure.]
