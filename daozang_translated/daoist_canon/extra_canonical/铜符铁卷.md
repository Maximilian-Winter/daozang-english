**"The Copper Talisman and Iron Scroll: Master Formula of the Three Primordial Elixirs**

When the Jade Purity bestows the decree of immortal office,
It governs the Southern Cauldron, mastering the transformation of all things.
The crimson script is profound and hidden in Pengyi’s chamber,
The dark arts are most forbidden beneath the azure sky’s verdant expanse.

Eight myriads, four thousand—one kalpa’s legacy—
Passed down through celestial talismans, inscribed by the Fire Record’s chronicle.
In the year of *Gēng-Jiǎ* (庚甲), chaotic *qi* dissolves,
As myriad heavenly assemblies rejoice in their grand celestial halls.

Prostrating in reverence before the Great Dao,
Ten thousand sages and true ones abide in profound stillness.
Gazing afar upon the Crystal Terrace, guests of Jade Purity,
The brows remain unfurrowed, yet the heart is heavy with concealed sorrow.

After long deliberation, the Nine-Six Gates are raised,
And the crane’s flight is heard as it seeks the turtle’s upward gaze.
The Great Dao spreads, filling the heavens above,
Your ranks of immortals rejoice without bound.

When the Three Kalpas of the Dragon and Han dynasties conclude,
The Mystic Palace unfolds its vast and auspicious domain.
The Eastern and Western Hua ascend in turn,
The Grand Sovereign of the Great Unity, *Zhēn Mǔ* (谌母), is transmitted.

Receiving the august decree of the Second Eight,
Most profound, most wondrous, most subtle and hidden.
It can make the dusty world flow with jade nectar,
And swiftly summon the immortal to the Celestial Pool.

The Pearl Terrace descends the Copper Talisman and Iron Scroll,
Imperially bestowed to *Zhēn Mǔ* (谌母) for her knowledge.
The Great Dao’s True Person expounds the Dao’s immortal secrets,
Interpreting the orthodox teachings: mercury and lead in harmony.

Lead ascends like snow-waves, pearls roll in flight,
Yet when lowered, it rests as true earth in slumber.
Earth, in response to the talisman’s decree, bears emerald leaves,
Each blossom a golden flower, rising in purple mist.

The purple mist ascends to the Lingxiao Hall,
Continuously linked, like scattered petals of water.
The sun and moon cast their radiant light upon the Great Thousand,
The *Xùn* (巽) wind blows, revealing golden flowers.

Without the rolling pearls, one cannot measure the lead,
As living beings gather their essence to ward off perilous battles.
The solar spirit is about to depart, the lunar deity is full,
Resplendent solar spirits, nine myriads in glory.

The four quarters are enveloped by the True Lead’s fusion,
Lead containing five colors—who could ever perceive?
Refining lead without measuring the True Transmission,
One cannot find *Gēng Jīn Huà* (庚金华) without obstruction.

Harvesting the True Lead of *Xīn Jīn* (辛金), a single essence,
Then returning to the Ash Pool for further purification.
Ascending and descending in tumultuous flux,
Do not let the *Rén Huā* (壬花) be disordered by black clouds.

Extracting the celestial spirit, seizing the solar mist,
Within the Water Crystal Palace—there lies my true abode.
Retrieving the rolling gold to restore the sacred form,
Why toil endlessly across the vast expanse of the world?

Mercury dies, becoming lead, which then transforms into earth,
The white gold vessel—the ancestor of the elixir’s foundation.
Exhausting the celestial spirit and terrestrial essence,
The Primordial Origin calls this the *Dān Mǔ* (丹母).

Mercury accumulates ninety-nine times, returning as sand,
The Dragon emerges from the east, the Tiger from the west.
In the Jin dynasty, the enlightened king preserved filial virtue,
His golden sinews and jade bones granted to his descendants.

The incantation commands the water to subdue the demonic leader,
His manifest and covert virtues benefit all under heaven.
Take the Iron Scroll’s decree of the Heavenly King,
And the Copper Talisman’s subtle secrets, passed orally to you.

The Jade Purity wishes to see the virtuous and meritorious,
His broad brows unfurl, his face bright with joy.
The Great Obstruction is sealed within a jade casket,
A radiant pearl shatters the world, revealing its hidden citadel.

Swiftly seize the famous mountain’s jade hare,
Dazzling the sun, capturing it—no further debate.
When the solar spirit is exhausted, the thousand mountains turn white,
Why fret over trifles when the body is already shadowed?

Simply boil millet to nourish the spirit-*qi*,
Observing the celestial timing, leaning toward the Five Tombs.

The malevolent dragon spews forth the Three Rivers’ waters,
Its venomous *qi* scatters, staining the world’s dust.
If you do not command it to aid in calamity,
The skeletal city and blood sea will grieve your heart.

Hasten to refine it in the Cauldron Pool’s furnace,
Crafting the sun and moon’s essence with cunning.
Dao methods number in the thousands and ten thousands,
Yet among them, this one alone is supreme.

Twelve celestial talismans, nine white snows,
Three cycles and five revolutions—named Heavenly Blue.
One grain, one dose, three periods later,
The body’s nine orifices shine with radiant clarity.

White snow enters the mouth, the body sprouts feathers,
The talisman is swallowed, the feet generate clouds.
Gradually, the Three Yangs open, heralding auspicious days,
The transient life, like rotting grass, meets the spring’s rebirth.

When virtue is high and practice complete, one receives celestial rewards,
Ascending the ancestral hall, filling the home with transcendence.
Attending the early court of the Supreme Sovereign,
He casts down golden seals, jade decrees, and celestial scriptures—
The Five Peaks welcome him.

Leisurely observing the Verdant Realm’s empty hymns,
The *Sháo* (韶) music resounds, yet the *qi* remains dense.
Since the day the Five Clouds ascended in glory,
The fragrance of heaven has filled the chamber—
A scent known through ancient and modern times.

The Nine-Six celestial secrets are entrusted to me,
Treasure them in hidden chambers, do not hold them lightly.
The Perfect Ones imparted it to King Wu of the Chu (吴王李),
Yet when rejected, the thunder-fire descended immediately.

The Golden Elixir is transmitted from the Mystic Origin,
The Five *qi* disperse, yet one essence remains.
It is not the Three-One method of the swallow’s call,
Nor the saliva from turning one’s head inward.
It is not the *Guī Dān* (闺丹) art of consorting with women,
Nor the cinnabar elixir forged from arsenic ore.

Lead is the Primordial Spirit, silver is its form,
When form and spirit unite, they become the True One.
When the Primordial Spirit meets the True Form,
Then observe the Primordial Spirit in the Great Purity.

**The Precious Pagoda Formula**
Ancient method of nine tiers—
The void’s utmost, where medicines cannot reach—
Now reduced for practical use.
Or seven tiers, or five,
Each chamber six inches high,
Beneath placed the *Péng Hú* (蓬壶) vase,
With male and female *zǐkǒu* (子口) openings,
Each tier possessing subtle orifices,
To facilitate the ascent of Dragon and Tiger *qi*,
And ensure their stable union.

Sitting above the pool,
An iron ring is suspended from the ceiling beam,
Secured firmly,
Then the internal fire is ignited.
When the fire nears the *Péng Hú* (蓬壶),
A waist-high iron frame is raised,
Enveloping the fire’s force,
So that the secondary fire does not intrude upon the Precious Pagoda,
And the *Zhūquè* (朱雀) easily finds its place.

The lead is inserted at the upper gate, half an inch thick,
Its height extending to the base of the vessel.
Three sides are fortified with three supports,
Each as thick as a finger joint,
Now the fire’s power is strong.

In antiquity, it was transmitted to use a bellows to subdue the flame,
Later generations opened the wind gates,
For the sake of human convenience,
Not necessarily adhering to the old ways.

Yin and Yang are its Dao,
Adaptability is its method,
Opening and closing the wind,
Not allowing fierce gusts to disturb the cauldron’s pool,
Constantly ordering attendants to patrol,
Lest any unforeseen disaster occur—
Yet even in ordinary practice,
Though it takes a hundred days of labor,
It is the foundation for ascending to heaven.

**The Formula for Extracting True Lead**
First, extract mountain lead sand—several hundred pounds—
And pound it into powder.
Then take the mineral’s upper layer of clay soil,
For every pound of lead,
Add four ounces of salt,
Pound it ten thousand times.
Weigh out one pound of lead powder,
Wrap it in paper in multiple layers,
Seal it externally with salt clay,
Five or six divisions thick,
And dry it thoroughly under the sun."

Thus, three to five hundred [pellets],
Insert into the furnace and calcine them.

The furnace’s form resembles a large steamer,
Six to seven feet in height, a circumference of ten feet,
With bellows installed below, flames ascending from the hearth.
Spread a foot of charcoal at the base,
Then layer lead-sand pellets upon the charcoal,
Alternating layers of charcoal and pellets.

When the fire burns until the interior and exterior glow red,
Extinguish the flames and let the furnace cool,
Then cover it with damp earth.
The lead below solidifies into a single mass;
Breaking open the pellets, it emerges like raw silver ore—
This is called *Ganfu* [Dry Father].

Take this *Ganfu* to refine into *liujin* [mercury],
For then the elixir gains vitality—
Not mere lead ore mixed with clay,
Otherwise its essence will dissipate into nothingness.
Without a master’s transmission,
If one acts recklessly, it will surely lead to ruin.

The supreme elixir’s sole ingredient is refined lead.
If this treasure is obtained, all matters are complete.

This is the primordial *True One Water* of the Preheaven,
Its quantity multiplied manyfold,
To serve as the foundation for the sacred ash’s construction.

Extracting one part of true earth-water,
Its worth exceeds a pound of gold.

Now, the divine mechanism awaits the subsequent great method.

**Ancient Xi-Huang’s Method for Refining the Divine Elixir**
*Earth Element’s Initial Step, Golden Cauldron’s Divine Chamber.*

Upper and lower strings [of the furnace],
Each weighing one *jin*.
As with the Nine Cauldrons, Seven Cauldrons,
Five Cauldrons, or Three Cauldrons—
The heart follows the great method’s prescribed measures.

If using eight *liang* of white gold [silver],
Take thirty-six *jin* of black lead infused with *fuyi* [subdued qi].
For eight to nine *liang* or seventy-two *liang*,
Extract according to the Nine Pools.

Fear not the lead’s qi is insufficient—
The divine essence descends sparingly,
Making it difficult to harmonize with Heaven and Earth’s seals.
Half a *jin* to eight *liang*—
Now, refine nine *liang* to produce one *liang*,
To dissipate excess qi.

First, seek the *Earth’s Soul*—
The *Earth’s Soul* is white gold [silver].
Next, take the *Heaven’s Spirit*—
The *Heaven’s Spirit* is yellow gold [gold].
Yellow gold produces *zhushasha* [cinnabar sand],
The essence of the sun.
White gold generates flowing pearls,
The essence of the moon.
When spirit and soul unite,
The essence and brilliance spontaneously coalesce into one.

Seizing the complete function of Heaven and Earth’s sun and moon—
This is the sacred ancestor’s *Xuanyuan’s* wondrous application.
The Sage knows that divine substances conceal in the North,
Coming here to forge the elixir’s head.
Worldly gold, though of pure yang essence,
Even after a hundred refinements, will never absorb qi.
As for copper and tin,
Their nature is excessively dry,
Making it difficult to encounter the *Golden Lord*—
If encountered, their form will surely be damaged.

Only white gold,
In its singular affinity, rejoices in harmony.
Golden flowers bloom, pearls flow,
Precious pearls emerge radiant among them.
True yin and true yang,
Their lights intermingle, their bodies unite.
Skillfully applying the *Zhoutian* [Postheaven] measures,
Filling the five colors with central yellow,
Naturally, yang arises from true earth—
Earth flourishes, metal thrives.
Borrowing the *Water Tiger* to nurture and give birth to the *Shenlong* [Divine Dragon],
Five-colored scales shimmer,
Golden ointment, jade-like body,
Ever luminous and enduring,
As the ancestral elixir for ascending to heaven—
The more it is refined, the more potent it becomes;
The more it is tempered, the more wondrous it grows.

Thus, there are the *Yin Pool* and *Yang Cauldron*.
Since lead does not endure refining,
Establish methods and symbols to determine its floating and sinking nature.
Construct the cauldron as yang,
So that the yang spirit ascends to the celestial realm above.
Fashion the pool as yin,
So that the yin soul descends into the underworld below.

The *One-Nine* method’s efficacy lies in lead,
The *Two-Nine* method’s efficacy lies in the mother [mercury].
All other formulas omit the mother—
The elixir’s gate suffers in vain,
How can *Renji* [metal and water] be divided?
The aged and brittle transform into yin earth,
Using lead requires secret transmission.
Initially, gold refines lead,
Floating and sinking reveal the truth.
Preheaven and Postheaven,
Recognizing their inner essence,
No need to seek cave-dwelling immortals.
Like an infant searching for its wet nurse,
Cycle after cycle, passing through the *Xuan* [Mysterious] Gate.
The medicine is true *mercury*,
The gold elixir is the divine elixir.
One mother bears nine children,
Each transmitting their own branches and leaves.
Virtue is insufficient to encounter [it],
Karma is insufficient to hear [it].
This is the obscure, hidden true method—
Child, commit it to memory.

**Method for Establishing the Furnace and Cauldron**
Offerings to the Nine Celestial Lords of the Five Soils,
The Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper’s True Immortals,
And the Furnace’s Chief Spirit overseeing the elixir’s refinement.
The Five Deities of Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth,
Attend with incense, lamps, and offerings,
Devoutly petitioning the Supreme Truth.

Preparations include tongs, keys, and other tools,
Accumulating black tiger iron pools and precious pagodas,
Amassing them to prevent loss or damage.

Within the furnace, the wind inlet and door should be
As large as a chicken egg—
Do not make it overly wide.
If too wide, the wind’s force weakens,
And the true qi will not ascend.

The pool’s base has three supports,
Not made of iron, but fired from magnetic soil,
Arranged in a *brand* character.
Externally, secure it with salt clay,
Firm and unbroken.

Place the pool in the upper chamber,
Supported by a heavy frame,
With iron rings suspended high on the ceiling beams.
Ensure the inner fire cover is secure,
Preventing flames from nearing the cauldron.

Separately, create pathways for adding and reducing fire,
For adjusting the process as needed.

**Secret Method of the Nine Earth Pools**
*Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls*

Two by two, the Pengluo Platform,
The Eight Treasures’ Radiant Yang Hall.
Ten Thousand Saints reverence the Central Emperor,
The Primordial Heavenly King manifests.
The King strides across the elixir’s terrace,
Commanding the Golden Lord to refine.
A single chant summons all true beings,
Golden light pervades the world.
Cautiously await the Northern Homeland’s demon,
Washing out the Celestial Garden’s dawn.
The effort lies with the elixir adept—
Abandon the old, welcome the new transformation.
Seize the *Gan’s* dazzling spirit-soul,
Do not let dark clouds disrupt [it].
Producing night-illuminating pearls,
Five colors radiant in fragments.
Above and below, let the wind circulate,
Golden dates, the face of an infant.
*Xiqi’s* yin turbidity arrives,
Deploying the *Hechē* [River Chariot] to turn.
Purple qi enters the upper chamber,
Parent and child no longer meet.
Initially producing longevity’s bloom,
Easily leading to scattered spirit.
Directly pointing to the *Hunwen*—
Named *Qing’ai* [Green Dust].

「The First Pool’s Lead Refinement Method: Use one *jin* of pure mountain gold, white as snowflakes, crushed into sixteen pieces.
On days when the sun and moon align in the same wall, when the five stars join in a single pearl, or when *Gan* and *You* (申酉) signify the gold’s vigor, place the pool and cauldron securely, open the wind gate, and introduce the *Wenwu* (文武) fires.
With gentle *Wen* (文) fire warming the pool, first cast in half a *jin* of lead, refining the ash into a solid treasure. Strengthen the foundation to prevent collapse or waste.
When the pool turns red, use nine *hu* of purified *Fuxi* lead (伏气净铅), each *hu* divided into three portions of sixty-five *zhu* (斛/株), each *zhu* as one pool, totaling nine pools with eighty-one *jin* of lead—matching the ninety-nine revolutions of the *Zhou Tian* (周天).
Insert each gold piece into the pool, then apply fierce *Wu* (武) fire to melt them into essence.
Wait only until the blackness fades and the essence reveals itself, appearing and disappearing in two cycles.
The vermilion light flickers half-illuminating the void—auspicious qi rises, floating in purple haze. Gradually add lead, letting it drip until exhausted; then replenish.
As celestial hosts rise and fall in constant motion, the treasure moon and golden flowers burst forth. Again, add lead by the *zhu*.
Do not stray from the center—
When *Gui* (癸) water is fully consumed, the "sea gold" (海金) emerges. Swiftly add lead essence, and *Ren* (壬) water ascends.
A gentle breeze scatters the golden flowers,
Yet the excess reveals *Geng* (庚) as *You* (酉) child.
Use three strong men to assist, taking turns in rotation.
Diet and rest must align with the *Bamen* (八门) openings and closings.
Add lead into the charcoal, boiling and refining with vigor.
Let the *Zhuhu* (朱雀) blaze the void,
While the purple deity’s auspicious qi ascends—
Golden date flowers bloom in crimson flames,
Generating light and essence like lightning.
Do not add lead too hastily—
Haste will prevent the *Jinwu* (金乌) from emerging from the sea.
Nor too slowly—
Slowness risks harming the *Yutu* (玉兔)’s form.
When water and fire intertwine sufficiently, without form or substance, the essence solidifies.
*Ren* water, meeting gold, naturally ascends to the *Nihuan* (泥丸) apex,
Condensing into the "sunlight pearl" (昱日流珠).
After all lead is consumed, withdraw the fire and seal the gate.
Secure the gold and replenish the water,
Then add three *qian* and four *fen* of lead.
Preserve the spirit and stabilize the form—
Do not disturb the pool or cauldron.
Once cooled, remove the *Ren* water from the cauldron,
Called the *Qing’ai* (青埃).
Or seal it in a gold or magnetic box,
Lest the qi escape. Leave it for later generations to blend with their *Yuanpei* (元配).
With bronze seals and iron scrolls,
And comrades of shared intent, guard the *Ziyang* (紫阳) Palace.
Black becomes red as the elixir,
Red becomes black as the *Weng* (翁).
The harmony of heaven and earth’s marrow—
This alone is the Dao of the elixir.
At the *Yumen* (禹门), draw three waves of water,
Letting droplets fall into the void.
On the palace’s summit, pearls roll like sunlight—
Their hue resembles purple-gold and crimson.
Within the pool, jade nectar churns,
Blown by the *Xun* (巽) wind.
The *Yutu* (玉兔) resides in *You* (酉),
The *Jinwu* (金乌) ascends to the east.
Dragon and tiger gaze from afar,
Uniting in the *Jingyang* (景阳) Palace.
Extract the lead’s treasure,
Do not rush the fire’s timing.
Calcined, the golden pearls roll—
Each pearl’s qi surges upward.
Before your eyes, red and yellow appear,
Seal the *Huagai* (華蓋) tightly.
When the lead’s impurities are exhausted,
The pool’s clarity rises, and pure essence descends.
Directly pointing to the *Hunwen*—
Named *Huangqing* (黄轻).

The Second Pool’s Lead Refinement Method follows the same principles,
But use a new pool and new cauldron, securing it as before.
Keep the *Shengmu* (圣母) unshaken—
If there’s any loss, replenish it fully.
Introduce the *Wenwu* fires,
Cast in half a *jin* of water-lead.
Strengthen the foundation.
Half the lead is consumed,
And the *Shengmu* is within.
Apply fierce fire to melt it—
The golden essence becomes clear and bright,
The *Zhuhu* (朱雀) emerges from the southern garden.
Swiftly add lead essence,
Do not let the fire rage too fiercely;
Last night’s child just parted from its mother,
Today’s younger sibling follows the same.
Add lead by the *zhu* and *bu*—
No distinction between black tortoise and lead,
Nor between flames of varied hues;
On the purple-gold platform, frost condenses,
Before the white jade hall, the mother gazes with one eye.
*Bingding* (丙丁) ascends in measured strides,
Lead drips into the bones.
After all lead is consumed,
The mirror remains pristine and dust-free.
Withdraw the fire and seal the gate.
Add the "secure lead" (安全之铅) of two *qian* and three *fen*,
Boiled in a cold furnace overnight.
Gently tap to retrieve the pearls rolling on the cauldron’s surface,
Called the *Huangqing* (黄轻).
Seal them separately, then shift to a new pool and cauldron.

With bronze seals and iron scrolls,
The Great Dao is without complication—
Lead and mercury are two kinds.
Lead treats mercury with kindness,
Mercury treats lead with righteousness.
The divine elixir is one flavor of lead,
Holding within it the *Xiantian* (先天) qi.
The *Bingding* (丙丁) partners mediate,
Transforming the *Huangpo* (黄婆) power.
Transport relies on the *Hechē* (河车),
Mercury absorbing lead’s essence.
In rising and falling,
One follows the other.
The *Huagai* (華蓋) renews daily,
Pearls are called "as one wishes" (如意).
Yellow cranes fill the sky in flight,
Green heavens crackle with thunder.
*Qianjin* (乾金) reveals purple brilliance,
Do not let lead fall short.
Now, open the four gates,
Seal above the *Xuanqiao* (玄窍).
Disturb the lead’s qi,
And the golden pool must be sealed tight.
Such is the fire’s alchemy—
Without form or substance.
Directly pointing to the *Hunwen*—
Named *Jinyue* (金液).

The Third Pool’s Lead Refinement Method follows the same principles as before.
Secure the pool with a three-legged stand,
Place the cauldron on top, and seal it firmly.
The sacred body remains unharmed—
Any loss must be fully replenished.
Within the *Zhujī* (筑基) pool, ignite fierce flames.
Three *Wen* and three *Wu* fires nurture the yellow sprout,
Lead ascends and descends in cycles—
Flames blaze, essence does not falter;
Lead begins without form,
Gold reverses to its original state.
Follow the prescribed measures when adding lead,
Treating it with utmost care.
The green dragon retreats three times,
The white tiger flips its body to return to earth.
Add lead essence in cycles—
Start and end as before.
In the western pool, the sun and moon meet,
Seizing the pure fragrance to depart.
Dragon’s mist glows red like fire,
True fire engulfs the dragon’s mist.
After all lead is added,
Withdraw the fire and halt the furnace.
Add the "secure lead" (安全之铅) of one *qian* and two *fen*.
The first three pools represent the eldest son’s manifestation,
*Zhen* (震) and *Geng* (庚) receiving the talisman—
A total of seven *qian* of secure lead, corresponding to the seven-day return of the *Tianfu* (天符).
The subsequent six pools will not use this method.»

Withdraw the fire and let the furnace grow cold,
Extract the *rénshuǐ* (壬水) from the crucible above—
Called **"Jīnyè" (金液)**—seal it clearly and replace with a fresh pool for further work.

**Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls**
Eastward, the Sun’s crystal emerges,
Its radiance dazzling and bright.
Illuminating all under heaven,
Its dew enters the jade city’s waves.

Day and night it turns east and west,
Setting in the west, rising again in the east.
The Great Mother of the Sun opens and closes,
All things receive its luminous essence.

The marrow of Heaven and Earth—
The root of the Dao of Immortal Elixir.

In the *Kūn* (坤) month, as the moon wanes,
Darkness deepens, embodying the *Tàiyīn* (太阴).
A faint star glimmers in the southwest,
While the Sun traverses the eastern land,
The Moon gradually moves southward.

By the seventh and eighth days, its light floats within,
Gradually filling a *hú* (斛) measure.
Half black, half white—
The white is the essence of gold.

Without the power of the *Sānjiǎo* (三足), the Moon’s brilliance would not arise.
At the fifteenth day, over *Jiǎdì* (甲地),
The elixir’s light fills the Jade Capital.

Directly pointing to *Hánwén* (函文), it is called **"Hóngxiá" (红霞)**.

The fourth pool’s lead and fire regimen
Follows the same as before.

Do not disturb the Sacred Embryo;
Wait for the Mother to enter the pool,
Then ignite the Great Fire with wind.

Proceed with lead as before—
No *xùntǒng* (荀筒) may be used.
Three days, three fusions yield True Lead—
Only when yin and yang are resolved does it emerge.

Again, advance the lead *yáo* (爻),
Each step continuous.

The Golden Elixir relies on *Gēngxīn* (庚辛) power—
Without *Rén*, *Gēng* cannot form; without *Guǐ* (癸), it cannot separate.

Observe the lead and *rénshuǐ*—
Their interplay refines the white gold.
When metal and water unite,
Common sons become sacred descendants.

The Mother melts in the Hua Pool—
Each must be distinctly observed.
Five-colored radiance arises,
Enveloping it in crimson mist.

Hour by hour, scenes gleam like gold and jade,
Day by day, the flowers bloom anew in form.

Begin only with silver and lead,
Dispersing lead and mercury,
Exhausting every *tǔzhū* (土铢),
Leaving the furnace cold through the night.
Extract the *rénshuǐ* from the crucible—
Called **"Hóngxiá" (红霞)**—record it, replace the pool, and refine anew.

**Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls**
Black lead is Heaven’s essence,
White gold is Earth’s fluid.
Black hides within water, bearing yang;
White holds fire’s qi.

Black and white alternate, returning to their proper places.
Their natures intertwine—
The *Dānjīng* (丹经) calls them kindred.

Black submits to white as master,
Yin pairs with yang as consort.
When yin and yang merge in chaos,
Petals of gold bloom emerald-green.

The Treasure Moon fills the *Dāntián* (丹田),
Boiling fiercely in the crucible’s heat.
Do not seal—open the Heavenly Aperture,
Let it breathe in and out.
In the midst of churning—
The tortoise hides itself.

The secret incantation’s marvel,
The fire’s measure lies in its signs.

Nurturing the Sacred Descendant within the common—
All else is but this singular treasure.

**A Daily Birth of Sons**
Each day a son is born—
Each son dwells in his own chamber.

*"Direct-Pointing Scroll"*—named *Liújīn* (流金)
The fifth pool’s lead-refining fire:
Harvesting the pool’s cauldron—
Each step identical.

The Holy Mother enters the pool,
Wind opens the golden elixir.
Cast lead as before,
Ever add charcoal within.

The Golden Sage, refined a hundred times, grows in spirit—
Only true lead ascends and descends.

Again, lead beads advance,
Yellow and white merge in chaos.
Boiling with talisman-fire, the Three Yang circulate,
Nine nines—pearls flow, the Mother-Yin departs.

Recognize lead and gold—
Neither yellow nor purple.

The sun-soul enters Chang’e’s hall,
Seeking mid-autumn’s fragrant blossom.
Lead exhausted, *Rén* ascends—
*Xīn* gold reveals itself.

From the cold pool, it’s taken—
Named *"Liújīn"*—stored for another refining.

**Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls**
One true essence is gathered—
The *Dantai* Mother shifts to Yin.

One Mother bears six sons,
The *Fúshāng* sun now shines.
Each pool mirrors its beginning,
Each cauldron grows stranger and new.

Ascending to the Crimson Silk realm,
Each grain of *qi* rises pure and clear.
Do not let lead bury mercury—
False claims of lingering *qi* are deceit.

The *Xùn* wind rages—
*Liújīn* permeates the body, luminous.
Not rigid or harsh in nature—
From here, the Yellow Vehicle is born.

*Guǐ* submits to *Rén* as master,
*Rén* to *Guǐ* as guest.
All follows the Great Dao’s law—
*Rén* and *Guǐ* determine floating and sinking.
Discard the turbid below,
Light and pure—spirit ever refined.
Such floating-sinking methods—
Unmatched in the world.

Fire’s suffusion is complete—
Each grain of Heaven’s rice turns azure-green.

*"Direct-Pointing Scroll"*—named *Rénhuā* (壬华)
The sixth pool’s lead-refining fire:
Weighing and measures—
All follows the same great principle.
Divide the lead by measure—
No need for old tricks;
Transformation lies in human action.
After refining two or three pools,
Its marvels arise naturally.

If pearls flow sparingly, the Spirit-Fire does not rise.
If refining is incomplete, the numinous does not appear.
Kindle the embryo-fire,
Let yellow clouds fill the marsh.
Yin reaches its peak—yang is born,
Upper and lower gates open.
Fine light flashes—
Dew drips upon the Yellow Court.
The infant manifests—
Light follows spirit’s birth.
Lead reaches the crown—
Order it to spread in all directions,
For proper function.
Only when nourishment is full
Should one approach the furnace—
Evil *qi* cannot enter.

Lead exhausted, withdraw the fire,
Take the *Rén* water from the cauldron’s top—
Named *"Rénhuā"*—stored for another refining.

**Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls**
The Primordial Dao’s root,
The Jade-Purity’s single gate.
Beyond this method, none are true.
Refine the lead’s treasure within,
Extract the silver’s essence—
Flooded waters stall the wheel,
Not as perilous as harming gold.
Pearls drift in ceaseless flow,
Mysterious auspicious *qi* ascends.
Child and Mother regard each other,
Yellow and white devour in confusion.
Dazed, emotions stir—
Threefold, ninefold cities.
Pure white reveals the treasure,
Azure-green departs from Yin.
Washed free of lead and mercury’s bones,
Naturally the essence crystallizes.
Lotus blooms in murky water,
Waves surge in endless teeming.
Beyond true lead and mercury,
No heed to external sounds.
The Iron Scroll’s intent,
The Dan-Door listens closely.

*"Direct-Pointing Scroll"*—named *Rénhuā* (壬花)
The seventh pool’s lead-refining fire—same as before.
Martial fire dissolves the Holy Mother,
Awaiting crimson light to enfold the Treasure Moon—
Then introduce each grain of lead.
Permeating the body, crimson jade,
Internally and externally pure white—
Gold is born after lead,
Yang produced within lead.
Fire consumes gold,
Gold subdues wood—flourishes.
Blue, red, black, white—
All return to central yellow.
Follow their signs,
Observe the phenomena.
Each pool scatters purple dust,
Each fire ignites its pattern-light.
Piercing the *Huàgài* canopy,
The chamber fills with luminous dust.
Ten thousand *li* without clouds—
Heaven in one hue.
Twelve hours reveal the sun.
Yellow Vehicle, purple dust—
All arise from here.
White snow, green ash—
Those who see it prosper.

Originally, one essence of lead-precision,
With white gold separating Yin-earth.
Gold is water’s foundation,
Water is the Dao’s pivot.
Only these two substances—
True cinnabar, true mercury—
All from silver and lead.
Formless yet symbolic,
Dark yet luminous.
Lead exhausted in the cold furnace,
Collect the *Rén* water from the cauldron’s top—
Named *"Rénhuā"*—transferred to another pool.

**Copper Talisman, Iron Scrolls**
*Bùqì* breathes life’s essence,
Containing light before Heaven and Earth.
Its root sprouts from the floating soil,
Its sprout grows in the Great Red Sky.
Eight treasures stem from this,
Only the luminous lead is black.
Now knowing Heaven and Earth’s secret—
Refining this is fertile ground.
Six Yin forge the Holy Body,
Gnarled bones return to the Yellow Springs.
The method points with mind to mind,
Mechanisms researched in detail.
Without true transmission,
All effort is in vain.
Futilely advancing Heaven’s fire,
How could the fragile endure?
Hard and soft have exterior and interior,
Yin and Yang follow Nature’s decree.
Within the cauldron—Heaven in Earth,
In the pool—Earth beneath Heaven.
Pure white on the Jade Terrace,
Substance as clean as silk.
The Mother cradles seven or eight sons,
Spirit ever more refined than before.
The Perfected One receives the transmission—
A worthy cause, a destined fate.
If you know to exchange bones,
Nánchāng leaves you to your leisure.

*"Direct-Pointing Scroll"*—named *Zǐjīnliú* (紫金硫)
The eighth pool’s fire and cauldron—
Both renewed.
Nine *liǎng* of lead, eight *liǎng* of foundation,
Refined as before.
Now the technique is pure—
Knowing ascent and descent,
Excess and deficiency, each in measure.
If pearls flow sparingly, seek the Dry Father,
*Xīn* gold’s loss is supplemented.
Gold flowers are the pool’s medicine—
Harvesting *Jīnhuā* requires no more words.
One method divides lead’s *Rén* and *Guǐ*,
One method washes gold’s turbid Yin.
Each time lead is the medicine,
Extracting medicine is extracting lead.
Understanding lead’s purpose—
The elixir’s spirit is not lead.
Like sun and moon exchanging light,
Steal only its spirit,
Not its form.
Using spirit, discarding form—
Thus attaining longevity.

Lead exhausted, take the *Rén* water from the cauldron’s top—
Named *"Zǐjīnliú"*—refined in another pool.

From black, extract black’s marrow;
From white, take white’s oil.
Black and white merge as one—
Oil and marrow thicken naturally.

Infant enters the Purple Palace,
Fair maiden descends the Heavy Tower.
Coal sears the Central Yellow Treasure,
Refining *Zǐjīnliú* to perfection.

Deploy the Long Serpent Array below,
Riding the phoenix through azure expanse.
At the Jade Pool’s first bath—
Unfulfilled, nurture three cycles.

Seize the Southern Vermilion Bird,
True earth buries it as a mound.
Fire’s measure follows One and Two,
Methods echo prior seeking.

Three *Rén* and one *Guǐ*—one *liǎng* each,
Nine *Yáng* suffice to gather.
Eighty-one times nine—
Insufficient to match prior extraction.

Plundering the Nine-Six count,
West Mountain ghosts weep in sorrow.
Reversed and upright—logic inverted,
Tail becomes head, head becomes tail.

Directly pointing to *Hánwén*—
Called *Miàolíngshā*.
**Ninth Pool’s Fire and Method:**
Refining lead is the same.

Entering the Holy Mother’s dissolution,
Red light envelops the Treasure Moon—
Then introduce the lead crucible.
Mercury overstepped—
Divine secret of immortals.

Summoning dragon essence,
Relying on tiger marrow.
No lead form used—
Only lead *qi*.

How to obtain lead *qi*?
First seek its kindred.
Kindred is gold—
Gray Pool’s intent.

Layered firecraft,
Externally encasing the cauldron.
Pearls yield gold’s portion—
Not like worldly lead.

Fire reveals its difference,
Gold reveals its stillness.
From One to Nine—
Called refining complete—
The work of refining essence into *qi*.

One Pool to Nine Pool—
Each *Rén* water sealed apart.
Holy waters stored abundantly,
For later use.

So-called "obtaining medicine, forgetting age,"
Refining lead without measure—
This is the living method.

Cold furnace opened—
Mother’s body white as snowflakes—
Then it’s good, named *"Miàolíngshā"*.
If green-yellow,
Not true lead *qi*—
*Guǐ* water yet exhausted.
Must fiercely boil and calcine,
Waves surging, billowing—
Only then does true *qi* reside.

Later: methods for nurturing *Chìwén*,
Returning soul, transforming bone.

**Human Element’s Nine-Crucible Secrets**

**First Crucible**
Human Element’s first elixir,
Nine nines pass the lead barrier.
Reusing *Qīngdū*’s essence,
Returned and restored again.
*Xīnjīn* like snow,
*Rén* water turns to smoke.
Child and Mother balanced—
Five fives nurture celestial hue.
Thunder’s three cycles of fire,
Dividing embryo above and below.
Avoid worldly distractions,
Steadfast resolve, firm heart.

One *Yáng* first revives the sun—
God and soul entwined in thread.

Add four *liǎng* of top fire for seven days,
Six *liǎng* for the next seven,
Half a *jīn* for the final seven,
Nurture twenty-five days.

Remove to bright furnace—
First gentle, then fierce—
Calcine sixty-six times (thirty-six hours),
Crucible fire uniform,
Cool fully by day.
Open the crucible—
Transformed into red mist,
Above forming substance,
Like red jade, purple powder.
*Xīnjīn* below forms a cake—
White exterior, yellow interior.

Refine further—
One month per crucible,
Ancestral *qi* initially transmitted,
Barely parted from the Mother.
God-*qi* chaotic,
Soul and spirit unstable—
Unfit for alchemical activation.
Seek another nurse,
Will transcending.

As an elite divine talisman,
With power to revive the dead.

---
**Second Crucible**
Human Element’s second elixir,
Radiant beyond *Yǔmén* Pass.
Reusing *Xīyí*’s place,
Falling at night, returning at dawn.
Day-soul seen in mist,
Moon-shadow fills autumn sky.
Brothers balanced—
Five fives complete *Chìwén*.

Thirty-six hours of fire,
Dividing One, Two, Three.
First child—empty, bone-like;
Second child—will firm.
Two *Yáng* revive—
Opens like a rooster’s egg yolk.

Given: copper talisman scroll,
Silver-lead crucible, tongs.

**Method:**
Prior elixir gold (one *jīn*)—
Now not diminished, do not disturb the embryo.
Take first crucible’s *Qīnggōng*,
Mix with second Pool’s pearls—
Two *jīn* total, blend evenly.
Layer above and below the embryo,
Secure and stabilize.
Fire as before, nurture fully by day.
Fierce fire separates the embryo—
Heaven, Earth, Human: Three Powers aligned.

First child—*Qīnggōng* like ash,
Empty—no *qi*.
Second child—water-crystal yellow sprout,
Gradually rising, free of worldly dross—
Called true lead.
Use this as the longevity vessel—
Three *qián* of *Qīnggōng*,
One *liǎng* of *Fúguāngshā*,
Add three days of *Bǐng* fire.
*Qi* exhausted, form yellow—
Take one *qián* of *shā*,
One *liǎng* of dry *gōng*.
With one *qián* of *gōng*, forge ten *liǎng* of copper.
Such divine transformations boundless—
This is the ancestral foundation.

---
**Third Crucible**
Human Element’s third elixir,
Soars beyond *Dòuniú* Pass.
Reusing *Hùndùn*’s place,
Dragging the White Ox back.
Golden goose flees its cave,
Vermilion phoenix nests in the *Dāntián*.
Raw and ripe balanced—
Ancestors rise from *Huángquán*.
Sixty-six hours of fire—
River flows, murmuring.
One and Two—jade-like,
Two long—strength unyielding.
Three *Yáng* revive—
Opens as green *zhǐlián* lotus.

Copper talisman, iron scroll’s intent—
*Wútóng*’s phoenix and *luán*.
**Method:**
Prior elixir gold (one *jīn*),
Mix with second Pool’s pearls and third Pool’s gold liquid—
Two *jīn* total, blend evenly.
Layer above and below the Holy Mother,
Secure as before.
Gentle fire nurtures,
Child and Mother steamed.
Fierce fire calcines,
Returning soul, transforming bone.
Day complete, whole cycle—
Retain the young, discard the old,
Second child unused.

**Sixth Method (of *Rényuán* Elixir):**
To obtain the death of cinnabar (*zhūshā*),
First, the black lead (*hēiqiān*) must die.
Lead essence, one pure substance—
Cinnabar inverted, mercury flows.

Take two *qiān* of the two,
Subdue the male with one *liǎng*.
Three days of sufficient fire—
The male truly dies.

One *qiān* of dead male,
One *liǎng* of dry mercury.
One *qiān* of dead mercury transforms ten *liǎng* of iron—
Eternal treasure, saving the world and aiding the perilous,
Boundless blessings, cycle upon cycle, nurturing life.
Cycle upon cycle, life upon life.

**Fourth Method (of *Rényuán* Elixir):**
Four *dǒng* (*Rényuán* Elixir of the Four Cauldrons),
Ninety-nine times the hook and wither (*gōu wěi*) pass.
Using the intent of the green dust (*yì qīng āi*),
Vermilion bird (*zhūquè*) advances to the Western River.
Purple Palace (*zǐfǔ*) and Flowered Pool (*huápí*) lengthen,
Yellow sprouts fill the Jade Field (*yùtián*).
Balanced entry and retreat—
Warmly nurturing the infant’s face.

Bone vast, spirit robust,
Confronting frost and cold with solemnity.
Father young, son old—
Heaven’s Dao/Way naturally cycles.

After the Four *Yáng* revive—
Midway, yellow and white jade.
**Method:**
Prior elixir gold (one *jīn*),
Spirit gradually lengthens,
Differing from before, each cauldron distinct.
Mix the Four Cauldrons’ *Rén* water (*rénshuǐ*) with Five Pools’ flowing gold (*liújīn*),
Layering old and young.
Fire nurtures the Prior Elixir gold—
The method of separating the fetus (*fēntāi*),
As before.
When the day is complete, open and take,
Withdraw the Four Cauldrons’ clamorous dust (*xiāo chén*).
Three *qiān* subdue the female yellow (*qí huáng*) with one *liǎng*,
Opening *qi* to die.
Take one *qiān* of the dead female,
Transforming one *liǎng* of lead into silver.
Dissolve the silver,
Then add seven *fēn* of refined female yellow (*líng qí*),
Forming superior gold of the upper color (*shàng sè*).
With this gold, construct the divine chamber (*shénshì*),
Nurturing eight *dàn* (*shí*), each with transformations.

**Fifth Method (of *Rényuán* Elixir):**
Five *dǒng* (*Rényuán* Elixir of the Five Cauldrons),
Each cycle as before.
Abandoning the divine chamber’s place (*shénfáng*),
Clouds and mists fill the mountains and rivers.
Water tiger (*shuǐhǔ*) does not look back,
Fire dragon (*huǒlóng*) struggles to emerge from the spring.
Balanced, step-by-step entry—
Virtue/power (*dé*) nurtures the vast and boundless (*hàorán*).
Mercury lengthens, red as cinnabar (*hónglì*),
Lead withers, its face no longer fresh.
The method of extracting lead and adding mercury,
Father and son do not pass on.
After the Five *Yáng* revive—
Moon’s shadow fills the Southern Garden.

Mix the Five Pools’ flowing gold (*liújīn*) with Six Cauldrons’ *Rén* essence (*rénhuá*),
Layering old and young.

The method of separating the fetus (*fēntāi*),
As before.

**Sixth Method (of *Rényuán* Elixir):**
Six *dǒng* (*Rényuán* Elixir of the Six Cauldrons),
The hook and wither (*guān guò*) pass again.
Sprinkled in the Hall of Light (*Míngtáng*),
Pearls return to their child.
Mercury, eight hundred years old,
Still requires half a *jīn* of lead.
Balanced entry and retreat—
Golden rooster (*jīnwū*) surges from the Great Abyss (*dàyuān*).
Do not rush the *yin* talisman (*fú*),
The *yang* fire blazes forth.
Shortened fierce fire, lengthened gentle fire—
Radiance fills the Great Thousand (*dàqiān*).
After the Six *Yáng* revive—
Fragrant breath, sweet and refined.
**Method:**
Prior elixir gold (one *jīn*),
Move into a new cauldron.
Mix the Five Cauldrons’ flowing gold (*liújīn*) with Six Pools’ *Rén* essence (*rénhuá*),
Three *jīn* total, blend in one place.
Fire nurtures as before—
The method of separating the fetus (*fēntāi*), identical in all respects.
During the fierce fire phase,
Extreme caution is required,
Lest the divine *qi* be harmed and flee—
Then all prior efforts are ruined.
If the cauldron is sturdy and sealed with utmost care,
Then the *yang* light naturally enters the golden vessel.
True father, true mother,
United in body, transmitting spirit—
Must use the talisman’s fire to restore and return to origin.
Gold generates water essence (*shuǐyè*),
Cycle upon cycle, blending.
When the day is complete, take it down,
Extract the celestial soul (*tiān hún*).
Subdue arsenic (*dǎn fán*) like a cat seizing a mouse,
Transforming iron and tin (*tiě xī*) like wind sweeping clouds.
The body of the Prior Elixir gold and silver is eternal—
Even more, when exposed to fire, red light ascends,
In darkness, like dawn’s radiance, clear and bright,
Not like worldly treasures.

**Seventh Method (of *Rényuán* Elixir):**
Seven *dǒng* (*Rényuán* Elixir),
Golden rooster (*jīnwū*) enters Broad Cold (*Guǎnghàn*).
The *Tàijí* revolves in cycles,
Sealing and binding ever stricter.
*Qián* generates *Xùn* and *Gèn*, *Kūn*;
*Kūn* generates *Zhèn* and *Duì*, *Qián*.
Divine fire enters balanced—
Adjustments must be thorough.
Hibiscus (*fúróng*) begins to bear fruit,
Grain upon grain in the golden dish.
Piercing the mirror of human and heavenly realms (*rén tiān jìng*),
Eclipsing the moon, devouring the sun’s liver (*tài yáng gān*).
After the Seven *Yáng* revive—
Mysterious, mysterious, mysterious again.
**Method:**
Prior elixir gold (one *jīn*),
Mix the Six Cauldrons’ *Rén* essence (*rénhuá*) with Seven Pools’ *Rén* flowers (*rénhuā*),
Blend in one place, enter the cauldron, and seal.
Fire nurtures as before.
Withdraw the Six children,
Subdue realgar (*pí xiāng*), opening *qi* to die—
Thus, the eight *dàn* return to truth (*guī zhēn*), each with transformations.
Lead essence subdues mercury essence,
Gold and silver form in an instant.
**Secret it!**
**Caution it!**

---

**Eight Cauldrons**
The *Rén* essence of the Eight Cauldrons elixir,
Floating bright as the moon at its fullest.
An aged pearl-shell cradles the pearl,
A luminous mirror, a crystal dish.
Clouds withdraw beyond the celestial void,
The infant reveals the Great Thousand.
Jade-like adjustments enter smoothly—
Forty-nine days of refining and transformation.
The formless is true mercury,
The true form is true lead.
Two substances, one *jīn* in weight,
At noon, when the sun stands high.
After the Eight *Yáng* revive—
Red fruits, green branches overturned.
Thus, the true method is applied,
Leaping beyond the ocean’s vast expanse.
**Method:**
One *jīn* of prior elixir gold—already formed as the *gēng* body—
Take the Eight Cauldrons’ wulong sulfur (*wúlóng wúlóng liú*),
The Nine Pools’ wondrous mercury essence (*língmiào shā*),
Together three *jīn*, blended as one.
Nurture with fire—its method and timing as before, no need to repeat each detail.
The embryo’s marvel and the *gui*’s mystery are beyond words,
Pouring, drenching, nurturing—
Golden bamboo shoots and yellow sprouts all emerge from this refining.
Three transformations yield gold and iron,
Rubble naturally becomes treasure.

The Nine *Yáng* complete the sacred embryo,
The elixir mother attains full truth.
When the *yīn* is exhausted and the *yáng* pure,
The embryo is cast off, divine transformation.
Within and without, all is pure gold—
Piercing clarity like water-crystal,
Resembling the sun at its first rising,
Golden stars radiant, divine waters vast,
Dazzling the eyes, five-colored clouds arise,
Fragrant breezes waft through the nostrils.
Red *liúlí* and crimson amber—
From seven returns and nine renewals,
Refining *qi* to divine essence.
Black gold refines to white gold,
White gold becomes yellow gold,
Yellow gold as the master medicine.
True mercury of this world,
Used as the progenitor for ascending elixirs.
If one wishes to ingest it,
Suspend it in a well for seven days,
To dissipate its fire-toxicity,
Then cook it into golden chestnuts,
And announce to the Highest Emperor of Heaven and Earth,
Choosing a day to bathe in purity,
Facing east at dawn and dusk.
Serve it with clear water,
One grain per day—
In a hundred days, form and bones are renewed,
Naturally harmonizing with divine *qi* and spirit,
Soul and vital essence unified.
After three cycles,
All nine orifices of the body shine with light.
By this stage of elixir cultivation,
All matters are complete.

One cycle to nine cycles—
Ninety-nine, eighty-one *cíhé* (magnetic boxes) seal it tight,
Outside with *rén* essence fluid pearls,
Layered above and below.
The *yīn* furnace nurtures it,
Revealing its three colors and four forms of divine medicines.
Pools differ distinctly,
Cauldrons radiate brilliance.
Seek again a worthy companion,
Choose a sacred mountain,
Build a hall of rites,
And cast the divine chamber.
Upper and lower double crucibles,
The Hall of Illumination and the Virtue of the Pure,
All planted within the secret range of the divine elixir.
In the Eastern Jin, Emperor Wu practiced the Way of Properness (*Dàozhèngxíng*),
And thus the *Qīnmǔ* (elixir mother) emerged,
The True Lord bestowed it upon *Wú Měng*,
Who passed it to *Xiè Qiān* and *Shèng*,
Now riding the jade palanquin and dragon chariot,
Wearing the golden crown and celestial garments,
Forever as a subject of the Golden Gate.

The divine formula remains in the world,
Transmitted to the worthy and bestowed upon the virtuous,
Not to be carelessly revealed or leaked.
The gods and immortals toiled through countless hardships,
Only to refine lead and gold in the end.

The **Heavenly Primordial Secret Formula**

The divine elixir, the great medicine,
Must be sought in gold and earth.

Bright dust passes through the chinks,
All drawing from the *Lí* talisman.

Eighty-one *Qián* talismans,
Seventy-two *Kūn* strategies.

Eight measures of water to eight measures of gold,
How could they be deficient?

Half pure, half turbid,
Clouds and mists naturally unite.

A single drop of gold yields clarity,
A single talisman of fire brings brilliance,
The oral formula must be precise,
And the technique flawless in execution.

Lean upon the balance of the Tiger,
And submit to the standard of the Nine Dragons.

Thus embodying the *Qián* and *Kūn* forms,
Thus displaying the radiance of the Sun and Moon.

The *Xīyí* and *Hébì* [1] manifest,
And all phenomena appear in attendance.

Refinement follows strict measures,
Every grain must adhere to the law.

Prepare the ritual implements within the hall,
And first arrange the basin and crucible to left and right.

A true friend attends with devotion,
Loyal, upright, gentle, and kind.

Before constructing the divine chamber, return to the golden crucible,
And first visit worthy companions to lay the sacred foundation.

The Dragon and Tiger bow in reverence,
The Tortoise and Serpent lie in wait.

Following the mysterious techniques,
There is never a single failure.

Maintain unwavering sincerity,
And remain steadfast without deviation.

Why need the Celestial Golden Crow descend?
Why not seize the Jade Hare from mortal realms?

Refine the floating *Lí* [2] into true earth,
And produce the wish-fulfilling gem.

Swallow one grain to ascend the heavens in radiance.
Before attaining the boundless virtue of the *Yīn* [3],
At the moment of refining, no need for concern.

I shall now reveal my threefold method,
With no word concealed—bestow it upon you.

Nurture the Dao’s root from early days,
And it will naturally manifest in time.

Do not speak lightly of heavenly secrets,
Nor let the unworthy mock its form.

**Water and Fire Principles**
The elixir’s fire must be the **Five Convergences’ True Fire** [4].
Not common flame.

True fire relies on the sun’s essence;
The Yellow Emperor took fire with the *Yángyǐng* mirror [5],
While the *Yīnyǐng* mirror is hard to obtain,
And red gold can also draw fire from sunlight.

In essence, the sun is heaven’s true fire,
Its vitality self-sustaining, its radiance self-revealing.
Each day is so, each month likewise—
If fire is taken by chiseling wood or stone,
Its nature is harsh and violent,
Not in accord with nature’s intent.

Better to wait until noon, when fire is at its peak,
And use a fire mirror to draw it from the sun.

Borrowing the sun’s fire is also called **True Fire**,
Hence the term **"Sun-Soul"** (*Rìhún*)* [6],
To symbolize true mercury (*Zhēnggǒng*)* [7],
And as the true seed,
Sufficient for the elixir’s divine purpose—
Why cling rigidly to the *Yángyǐng* mirror?

Water must be drawn from the **Square Pearl** (*Fāngzhū*)* [8].
The Square Pearl is the moon’s luminous essence ascending,
Condensing into shape within water—pure *Yīn*.

On the fifteenth night of the eighth month,
Between the hours of *Hài* and *Zǐ* [9],
When the moon’s brilliance is at its height, take it.

Beyond the Mid-Autumn Festival,
No other month suffices.

If virtue and conduct are incomplete,
And *Yīn* deeds are insufficient,
Or one has not yet practiced sincerity toward heaven,
Then many cloudy, rainy days will arise—
Where will the water come from?

Even if true water is obtained,
A single night’s harvest—
How much could it yield?

To cultivate the void, there is no divine medicine—
Fire lies below, water is diminished.
Each day and night,
Refill and adjust, using ten *jīn* of water,
A year requires over two thousand five hundred *jīn*.

Yet Mid-Autumn yields only two hours—
How could it suffice for two thousand five hundred *jīn*?

Without this water,
The pairing of Sun-Soul and Moon-Soul is incomplete,
And heaven’s water and fire are misaligned.
If common water is used,
It is not the true seed—
The student is at a dead end.
Would that not be a mistake?

Now I open the door of convenience,
And reveal the path to heavenly ascent.

Water indeed is the moon’s *Yīn* essence,
Heaven’s **One Primordial’s Divine Water** (*Tiānyīshénshuǐ*)* [10],
Flowing and condensing from the **Divine Dragon** (*Shénlóng*)* [11].

Each year, in the pure *Yáng* month of the fourth,
When the Divine Dragon transforms,
Its water holds power.

When heavy rains fall, collect them in magnetic vessels,
Cover tightly, lest dust fall—
Thus securing the year’s supply.

There is no month without rain at all,
This too is the adept’s wondrous adaptability—
Why cling rigidly to the Square Pearl?

**Earthly Veins Principles**
To refine the elixir, choose a sacred mountain,
A blessed land of towering peaks and encircling winds;
Sit facing south, toward noon,
So the Golden Crow and Jade Hare
Rise in the east and set in the west,
Turning left and right in their cycles.

Lakes and marshes must be pristine,
Bamboo and trees must be pure and strange.
Dragons coil in layers beside the hall,
Tigers’ wings stack in tiers within the divine chamber;
The **Black Tortoise** (*Xuánwǔ*)* [12] hides behind the screen,
The **Vermilion Bird** (*Zhūquè*)* [13] strides in orderly ranks.

Avoid the passage of dust and vulgarity,
Sever ties with ordinary friends;
Cultivate the realm of the **Island of Immortality** (*Qióngdǎo*)* [14],
And shun the filth of mortal remains.

Observe the celestial waters above,
And examine the earthly veins below.

The sun’s marvelous beasts cry out at dawn,
While strange creatures pass at their appointed hours.
Hidden scriptures and veiled histories,
Mushrooms spring from guests’ abandoned robes—
Only then may the **Alchemical Hall** (*Dāngōng*) be established.

Naturally, **Dao Saints** (*Xiānshèng*) descend,
Earthly deities gather in reverence,
No end to blessings, endless joy in rebirth.
The **Hall’s alignment** (*Gōngshì zhíyì*) is true and just—

When the **Tripod** (*Dǐng*) follows the medicine’s placement,
And the chamber conforms to the Tripod’s design:
One room, one Tripod,
Three Tripods, three chambers.
Rise sixteen feet, span fourteen feet wide.

Leave the four corners empty,
Double galleries stretch in procession.
Not the grandeur of **Cloud-Harvesting Towers** (*Qíyún Zháixīng*) or **Carved Beams and Painted Pillars** (*Diāoliáng Huàdòng*),
Yet windows face all four directions—
Some sealed, some open.

Pierce the roof to **venture the qi** (*Cǎo tóng qì*),
Invite auspicious blessings to summon fortune.
The ground lies flat as a palm,
No incline, no depression.
Cracks or blockages—
Do not permit foulness to enter.

The number of Tripod chambers,
Measure and act accordingly.
For each Tripod’s labor,
All must harmonize—
**Heaven, Earth, Sun, Moon, the Three Talents** (*Sāncái*), **Four Seasons**,
**Five Phases** (*Wǔxíng*), **Seven Celestial Officials** (*Qīzhèng*), **Eight Trigrams** (*Bāguà*), **Nine Palaces** (*Jiǔgōng*), **Ten Stems** (*Shí gān*),
**Twelve Branches** (*Shí'èr zhī*), **Twenty-Four Qi** (*Èrshísì qì*), **Seventy-Two Phenomena** (*Qīshí'èr hòu*), **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Èrshíbā xiù*),
All **manifestations** (*Wànxiàng*) born in creation.

The **Trigram** (*Guà*) faces south, an entrance opened.
The **kitchen** (*Pú*) and **bathing chamber** (*Yùshì*).

「Slightly distant, another structure is built.
Firmly uphold the **威严** (*wēiyán*—majesty and solemnity), as if facing a sovereign saint.
The **坛台** (*tántái*—altar platform) must be upright and just.

For the **旺方** (auspicious direction), select the finest yellow soil,
Steam-refine and compact it into solidity.
Then employ the **塑工** (modeling artisans) to ensure its firmness and durability.
Wait until it is thoroughly dry before proceeding, without haste.

The altar is divided into three tiers, corresponding to the **Three Talaments** (*Sāncái*—Heaven, Earth, and Man).
The lower tier rises **one foot two inches** (12 inches), with **Eight Gates** (*Bāmén*—eight openings),
each gate **eight inches** high and **three inches** wide,
each fashioned as a **土门** (*tǔmén*—earthly gate) for opening and closing,
and each equipped with a pathway.

Pierce the center of the platform, leaving a hollow core **five inches** in diameter,
also divided into eight angles, inscribed with the **Eight Trigrams** (*Bāguà*—乾, 坤, 震, 巽, 坎, 离, 艮, 巽).
Water is the **first**, fire the **second**, wood the **third**, metal the **fourth**, earth the **fifth**.

The middle tier rises **one foot three inches** (13 inches),
with a central hollow of **five inches**,
its shape circular, aligning with the **Heaven’s Round** (*Tiānyuán*—天圆) principle,
and a perimeter of **one foot six inches** (16 inches),
a horizontal diameter of **five feet three inches** (53 inches),
depicting the **Twenty-Eight Constellations** (*Èrshíbā xiù*—二十八宿),
as well as the **Seventy-Two Phenomena** (*Qīshí'èr hòu*—七十二候) of the **Four Seasons**.

Place the **太乙神** (*Tàiyě Shén*—Grand Unity Spirit) upon the platform.
The furnace stands **one foot six inches** (16 inches) tall,
with walls and base each **six inches** thick.
Within, the **明堂** (*Míngtáng*—Luminous Hall) has a horizontal diameter of **seven inches** (7 inches),
and a height of **four inches** (4 inches),
its body continuous with its base, rising **two feet** (24 inches).
From the base to the top, a **five-inch** (5 inches) hollow aligns with the platform’s core.

Construct an earthen partition within the furnace,
leaving space for fire in the center,
with a base **three inches** thick and a diameter of **six inches** (6 inches).
The furnace must be **half exposed, half concealed**,
while the platform above bears the **Four Symbols** (*Sìxiàng*—青龙, 白虎, 朱雀, 玄武),
and the **Twelve Monthly Guards** (*Shí'èr yuè jiāng*—十二月将) are arranged below.

On the eaves’ east and west sides,
paint the **Sun and Moon** (*Rìyuè*—日月),
emblematic of the **金鸟玉兔** (*Jīnniǎo Yùtù*—Golden Bird and Jade Hare).

The **神炉** (*Shénlú*—Divine Furnace) must be crafted on days when:
the **Yellow Dao** (*Huángdào*—黄道) and **Heavenly Virtue** (*Tiāndé*—天德)
align with the **Monthly Virtue** (*Yuèdé*—月德),
and the **auspicious hour** (*shàngjī*—上吉) is chosen.
From the **旺方**, take **pure yellow, true-colored soil** (*zhēnghuáng zhèngsè tǔ*—正色之土),
wash it to the finest particles,
steam and bake it until pliable,
then pound with paper-fiber pestles to mold it thoroughly.

Add **white 蟮土** (*báichángtǔ*—white serpentine soil), fine sand, and **代赭磁石** (*dàizi chíshí*—red ochre and lodestone),
taken at the **Four Harmonizing Hours** (*Sìhuà*—四化) and **auspicious constellational timing** (*hòu jí shí*—吉时),
then shape it while still damp, ensuring it sets dry.
Afterward, fire-refine it and seal it atop the platform.

The **鼎器** (*Dǐngqì*—Cauldron Vessel) must be upright and just.
The cauldron’s body is **one foot two inches** (12 inches) tall,
uniformly **one inch one fen** (1.1 inches) thick,
divided into three levels.
From its rim to its base, it also follows three tiers.
The **内明堂** (*Nèi Míngtáng*—Inner Luminous Hall) has a horizontal diameter of **one inch six fen** (1.6 inches),
while the rim’s diameter is **seven inches** (7 inches),
and beneath, the **鳌足** (*Áozú*—Tortoise Feet) rise **three fen** (0.3 inches).

One method uses clay soil, but fearing it may not suffice,
cast it instead from **nine-nine refined iron** (*jiǔjiǔ liànjìng rèn*—九九炼净熟铁),
ensuring no leaks or uncleaned pores.
Choose a **Five Star Conjunction Day** (*Wǔxīng liánzhū rì*—五星联珠日)
or a **Day of Solar-Lunar Unity** (*Rìyuè hébì rì*—日月合璧日) for casting.
Prepare many to allow for replacement, avoiding hasty or careless work.
Upon completion, announce to the **师真** (*Shīzhēn*—Master of the Dao),
and place the cauldron within the furnace for **one year**.

A single cauldron must not be reused.
The **坎鼎** (*Kǎn Dǐng*—Water Cauldron) is set inside the **离鼎** (*Lí Dǐng*—Fire Cauldron),
with water stored **eight inches four fen** (8.4 inches) high.
The vessel is **one foot five inches** (15 inches) in circumference,
**five inches** (5 inches) in diameter,
with a rim **one inch two fen** (1.2 inches) thick,
and its belly to navel **one inch two fen** (1.2 inches) deep,
crafted from **赤金** (*Chìjīn*—pure gold).

The **坎离二鼎** (*Kǎnlí Èr Dǐng*—Water and Fire Cauldrons)
must interlock securely,
their **拔支** (*Bázhī*—protruding shafts) finely crafted.
Ensure absolute stability and seamless alignment,
then apply **thoroughly dried fine clay** (*jīngrèn xì ní*—极熟细泥).
Employ the **塑工** once more.
Construct with utmost precision, avoiding any negligence.
After drying and purging the **浊汁** (*zhuózhī*—impurities),
cast with **金汁** (*Jīnzhī*—golden liquid).

The **坦郭** (*Tǎn Guō*—Flat Enclosure) must be upright and just.
The **垣郭** (*Yuánguō*—surrounding walls) secure the cauldron,
using soil gathered from the **Five Directions** (*Wǔfāng*—五方),
refined by water-filtration (*fēiguò*—飞过),
and kneaded with *lù* paste into solid blocks.
Pound and refine until firm and mature,
its form resembling a **锅釜** (*guōfǔ*—cauldron or pot).
Its height is **nine inches** (9 inches),
its thickness **nine fen** (0.9 inches).
The **离鼎** (*Lí Dǐng*—Fire Cauldron) is **one inch nine fen** (1.9 inches) wide,
its mouth slightly open and rounded.
Gather soil on **土日** (*Tǔrì*—Earth Day),
and cast it on **火日** (*Huǒrì*—Fire Day).
Below, model **eight pillars** (*Bāzhù*—八柱),
ensuring their absolute firmness.
Another name for this is **丹龟** (*Dānguī—Cinnabar Tortoise*),
its **坎离之气** (*Kǎnlí zhīqì*—Water and Fire Qi)
converging within its layers.

The **神室** (*Shénshì*—Divine Chamber) must be upright and just.
Refining the **Great Elixir** (*Dàyào*—大药) relies entirely on the **奇器** (*Qíqì*—wondrous vessels) of this chamber.
Even a slight deviation in measurement
poses great difficulty in alchemical transformation.
First, construct the **电式** (*Diànshì*—Lightning Mold),
modeling it with thoroughly dried fine clay,
then use its precision to gauge the cauldron’s proportions—
height, thickness, width, and circularity.

Follow the **Great Dao** (*Dàdào*—大道),
employing **玄水** (*Xuánshuǐ*—Mysterious Water) as prescribed,
and refine it over a long duration.
Beside it, leave a **穴** (*xué*—cavity),
ensuring the **固济** (*Gùjì*—stable alchemical process) is properly set.
Burn with fire until a **清汁** (*qīngzhī*—pure liquid) forms,
then pierce with an iron rod to drain it into the mold.
Cast two vessels separately, ensuring they fit perfectly together.
**乾 above, 坤 below**,
forming **中黄** (*Zhōnghuáng*—Central Yellow),
transforming **阴阳** (*Yīnyáng*—Yin and Yang) principles.
Leave a **one-inch** (1 inch) hollow in the center,
where **灵汞** (*Línggǒng*—Spiritual Mercury) generates—
when formed, it becomes the **玄牝** (*Xuánpìn*—Mysterious Female),
and when united, it becomes the **太极** (*Tàijí*—Supreme Pole).

Craft the **铸室** (*Zhùshì*—Casting Chamber) during **金旺** (*Jīnwàng*—Metal Auspicious) days and months.
On the **third month’s 庚日** (*Gēngrì*—Geng Day),
prepare and cast the lower mold.
Use only the **九池九鼎** (*Jiǔchí Jiǔdǐng*—Nine Pools and Nine Cauldrons),
and cast the **金母** (*Jīnmǔ*—Metal Mother).
Refine **one catty of pure gold** (*jìngjīn yījīn*—净金一斤),
until the casting yields only **fifteen taels** (*shíyǒu*—十五两).

After casting, the **真气** (*Zhēngqì*—True Qi) leaks severely,
and if the cauldron is immediately placed in the furnace,
the **金精** (*Jīnjīng*—Gold Essence) may solidify too soon,
while the **玉液** (*Yùyè*—Jade Fluid) develops tardily,
rendering transformation impossible—
all prior labor would be wasted in vain.
Instead, use **壬水** (*Rénshuǐ*—Ren Water) gathered beforehand,
filling the cauldron internally and externally,
and nurturing its Qi abundantly.
Then place it in the **磁鼎** (*Cídǐng*—Magnetic Cauldron) to solidify,
using **平火** (*Pínghuǒ*—gentle flame) to temper and nourish for **one hundred days**.
Each month, replace the water **three times** (*sānjiēqì*—三接气),
until the spirit is fully complete and the essence firmly established.

After one hundred days,
use **六一泥** (*Liùyīní*—Six-to-One Clay),
**石膏** (*Shígāo*—gypsum),
**枯樊** (*Kūfán*—dried mulberry bark) calcined,
**代赭黄** (*Dàizi huáng*—red ochre yellow),
**丹赤** (*Dānchì*—cinnabar red),
**石脂** (*Shízhī*—mineral pitch),
and **重罗灰粉** (*Chóngluó huīfěn*—double-sifted ash powder)
to seal the mouth’s fissures,
binding it with **十字扎** (*Shízì zhā*—cross-woven silver threads).

Externally, use **圣金** (*Shèngjīn*—Sacred Gold) and **圣银** (*Shèngyín*—Sacred Silver)
to craft a protective **包胎** (*Bāotāi*—outer casing),
wrapping it layer upon layer,
ensuring no deviation.
The **雌雄子口** (*Cíxióng zǐkǒu*—female and male orifices)
must align perfectly,
its form resembling a **鸡子** (*Jīzǐ*—chicken egg)—
**outerly round, inwardly square**.

Thus, it can receive the **精灵** (*Jīnglíng*—Essential Spirits) of Heaven and Earth,
and the **育养** (*Yùyǎng*—nourishment) of Water and Fire.
The mold is crafted from **圆转** (*Yuánzhuǎn*—circularly turned clay),
cast on **土日** (*Tǔrì*—Earth Day),
its height **four inches** (4 inches),
all measurements taken with the **周尺** (*Zhōuchǐ*—standardized ruler).

**符镜直义**
Eight mirrors hang in the cardinal directions, each twelve *chi* in diameter.
Leaning against the house’s cauldron-altar, four swords are suspended at the corners—
the mirrors and swords forged at their rising and setting.

At the third watch of the *Yǐhài* hour, each attends to their duties in advance.
Maintain solemn stillness, as though facing deities.

Wrap them in pure yellow silk, placing them before the Sacred True Position,
reciting morning and evening salutations.

When the Earthly Branch *Tǔ* aligns with the Heavenly Stem *Líng* and the Emperor’s day of power,
at the first stir of *Yīnyáng* (one *yang*’s birth),
install them in the Elixir Chamber.
To the cauldron’s left and right, erect the Five Sacred Peaks.

First, refine the five colored soils, molding the Five Peaks’ forms and spirits until dry.
Flatten the King’s Cauldron’s base like a mountain, sealing its seams,
then daily offer sacrifices.

When the Water and Fire circulate, each fulfills its role.

---

**陈设直义**
Construct the Elixir Hall, build the altar platform, erect the cauldron, and install the furnace,
choosing auspicious earth and timing.

Hang the Three Celestial Treasures (mirrors) to dispel malevolent forces.
Insert swords at the four corners to subdue spirits.

The *Treasure Mirrors* are mirrors:
- *Heaven’s Mirror* cast on *Jiāzǐ* days (the first *yang* of the *liúliú* cycle),
  forged when *Yellow Dao* aligns with metal and stone—
  the *Mingtáng* (Bright Hall) is then cast at the hour of great perfection.
- *Earth’s Mirror* cast on *Rénzǐ* days, at the midpoint of the solar term.
- *Human Mirror* cast on *Bǐngzǐ* days, at the solar term’s exact center.
Each exceeds twenty-four *cùn* in diameter.

Swords are forged on *Shuāngjiàng* (Frost’s Descent) days,
with ancient blades being most auspicious.

Four talismanic slips, cast when *Tàiyǐ* descends to the palace or on metal-stone days.
The four-directional talismanic seals and five-colored banners follow strict patterns—
the banners match the Five Directions’ hues, each two *zhàng* long,
tightened beneath the mirrors and atop the layered roofs.

The Twelve Celestial Stems’ talismans, iron-strip talismans, four-wall talismans,
the Three Platforms’ seals, the Eight Trigrams’ array,
Laozi’s Blockade-Talisman, the Twenty-Eight Constellations’ symbols,
and the Four Symbols (Metal Rooster, Jade Hare)—
all these talismans appear in the scriptures and histories.

Within each palace, enshrine:
- The Elixir Master, *Zhōutiān Mièhuà Zhēnrén* (True Person of Heaven’s Transcendent Transformation),
- *Jiǔyáng Wēidé Jìshēng Dùsǐ Zhēnrén* (True Person of the Nine Suns’ Virtue, Saving Life and Death),
- The *Day Palace’s* Taiyang Fire Virtue Star Lord,
- The *Moon Palace’s* Dayuan Water Virtue Star Lord,
- *Tàiyǐ Zhǔzǎi Gāoshàng Dìshī Yuánjūn* (Highest Imperial Teacher, Sovereign of the Supreme Dao),
- The Twelve Celestial Stems’ Native Star Lords,
- *Zhèngyī Lónghǔ Xuántán Zhào Tiānjun* (Heavenly Lord Zhao of the Orthodox Dragon-Tiger Mystic Platform),
- The Swift Messengers of the Celestial Hosts,
- The Transmitting Masters of Scripture and Teaching across generations,
- The Elixir Hall’s Attendants, and the Local Land and City Deities.

Facing the cauldron, at each of the twelve hours,
rotate the incense trays; never extinguish the lamps.

Place the Fire Tray in the northeast corner, forged in copper,
weighed precisely to determine its measure.
Use seasoned charcoal for the fire to avoid explosions.

Place the Water Tray in the southwest corner, with eight ladles for adding water.
A *looking basin* holds used water; a *filling basin* holds reserved water.

Within each palace, employ two assistants to manage water, fire, and the copper hourglass,
adding and drawing water according to the *Bāmén* (Eight Doors) evasive method and *Sānqí* (Three Odds).

When *Jiānshí* (Heavenly Birds) begins, cast the *Yīnyáng Èrduàn* (Two Evasions).
If *Jiǔtiān* (Nine Heavens) aligns with the *Zhen* trigram, hang an eastern talisman
and suspend one mirror on the east, with a thread dangling beneath it.
If *Jiǔtiān* aligns with the *Xùn* trigram, hang a southeast talisman
and suspend one mirror in the southeast corner.
The remaining six directions follow similarly.

The central yellow talisman is hung when *Tiāndé* (Heaven’s Virtue) aligns with *Yuèdé* (Lunar Virtue)
at the first moment of the *Zǐ* hour, suspended from the roof’s center.

The four-directional talismans are installed on *Sìqī* (Four-Sevens) days,
while also offering prayers to the Primordial Lord and swearing oaths before the Celestial Messengers.

---

**洁净直义**
Before refining the Great Elixir, curb lust, abstain from killing,
practice benevolence, observe fasts and purifications,
cleansing body and mind.

Only then ascend the platform, arrange the Patriarchal deities’ positions,
offer incense and lamps, and pray earnestly for divine aid.

Await the month of *Yīnyáng Lái Fù* (Return of One *Yang*) and its birth hour,
then proceed according to ritual.

Avoid monks, nuns, women, chickens, and dogs—impurities that invite divine wrath
and hinder elixir success.

Each day, the true disciples perform rites, assessing merit and fault.
Secure doors and windows; use the copper hourglass for timing.
One oversees finances and meals; another manages water and the Great Furnace.
Attendants chant incense and report; others tread the *Gāng* (Hexagram) and arrange the *Dǒu* (Cauldron).

Reward diligence, punish laziness—neither movement nor stillness is careless.
With harmonious *qi*, proceed unhurried.

Avoid cutting hair or breaking teeth; swear blood oaths at the *Léijiāng* (Thunder Official’s) desk,
vowing to refine the transcendent cinnabar together,
and attain the Immortal’s Free Assembly.

On completion, ascend to the Jade Empyrean.

---

**卦象直义**
Heaven and Earth transform through *Yīnyáng*.
*Yáng* transforms, *Yīn* unites—rooted in *Qián* and *Kǔn*.

*Qián* uses nine; *Kǔn* uses six—each with six lines.
*Qián*’s six nines yield fifty-four strategies;
*Kǔn*’s six sixes yield thirty-six strategies.
Doubled across the four seasons, they total:
*Qián*’s two hundred sixteen, *Kǔn*’s one hundred forty-four—
three hundred sixty, marking the solar cycle.

The Sage condensed years into months, months into days, days into hours,
dividing each hour into two *qì* (energetic phases) of the twenty-four *jì*,
or six *hòu* (phenological stages) of the seventy-two *hòu*.
From *Zǐ* to *Sì*: winter solstice to summer solstice;
from *Wǔ* to *Hài*: summer solstice to winter solstice.

Refining the Great Elixir across the twelve hours,
advancing and retreating *Yánghuǒ* (Yang-Fire) and *Yīnfú* (Yin-Talismans),
exhaling cold and warm breaths.

Channeling into the Central Palace’s Divine Chamber,
mutual generation and transformation produce True Essence.

Each day and night, two talismanic hexagrams align—
seven hundred twenty hexagrams in a year,
four thousand three hundred twenty lines total,
corresponding to four thousand three hundred twenty years of cosmic *qì*.
Thus, within each hour, the talismanic fire advances and retreats,
seizing the pristine *qì* of four thousand three hundred twenty years
and returning it to the Divine Cauldron.

The fundamental count of the talismanic fire aligns with the four hexagrams of **乾 (Qián, Heaven)**, **坤 (Kūn, Earth)**, **坎 (Kǎn, Abyss)**, and **离 (Lí, Flame)** as its core, while the remaining sixty hexagrams serve as its application. The lines total **三百六十 (sānbǎiliù, three hundred sixty)**, each line representing one star, each star corresponding to one *铢 (zhū, grain)*. At the hour of **子 (Zǐ)**, the Yang-Fire advances **三十六铢 (sānlìzhū, thirty-six grains)**, with **二十四铢 (èrshísìzhū, twenty-four grains)** constituting one *两 (liǎng, ounce)*, and the remaining **十二铢 (shí'èrzhū, twelve grains)** as half an ounce. Thus, in the hour of **子**, one attains **Yang-Fire** of one and a half *两*, the first six hours belonging to Yang. Its total count reaches nine, and so the Yang-Fire advances nine *两* in sequence, amounting to **二百一十六体 (èrbǎiyīshíliù tǐ, two hundred sixteen lines)**.

The remaining **少阳 (Shàoyáng, Lesser Yang)** and **少阴 (Shàoyīn, Lesser Yin)** counts, spanning five days, do not fall under the standard reckoning. The Yin-Talismans, from **午 (Wǔ)** to **亥 (Hài)**, all belong to Yin, their lines also diminishing to **一百四十四铢 (yībǎisìshízhū, one hundred forty-four grains)**, totaling six. Six marks the strategy of **老阴 (Lǎoyīn, Elder Yin)**.

At **午 (Wǔ)**, the Yin-Talismans retreat **二十四爻 (èrshísìyáo, twenty-four lines)**, each line as one *铢 (zhū, grain)*, twenty-four grains making one *两 (liǎng, ounce)*. Thus, in the six Yin-hours, one attains fire of six *两*, totaling **一百四十四铢 (yībǎisìshízhū, one hundred forty-four grains)**. The first six Yang-hours yield nine, the latter six Yin-hours yield six—the interplay of **Yang-nine and Yang-six** is thus complete.

In sum, **三百六十支 (sānbǎiliùzhī, three hundred sixty branches)** coalesce into the **神室 (Shénshì, Divine Chamber)**’s one *斤 (jīn, catty)* in essence and application. Now, nine and six total **十五两 (shíwǔliǎng, fifteen ounces)**, while **乾 (Qián, Heaven)** and **坤 (Kūn, Earth)** serve as the **鼎器 (Dǐngqì, Cauldron Vessels)**, and **坎 (Kǎn, Abyss)** and **离 (Lí, Flame)** as the **药物 (Yàowù, Medicinal Substances)**. The **二十四爻 (èrshísìyáo, twenty-four lines)** correspond to one *两 (liǎng, ounce)*.

For those who follow in refining the Great Elixir, adhering to the Master’s intent: fire is the parent of the elixir, the elixir the offspring of fire. Passed down from mouth to mouth, from heart to heart, one must focus solely on fire.

**逊 (Xùn)** said: *"The Divine Chamber holds one catty, and the fire’s count also equals one catty—neither may be neglected. Now the fire is only fifteen ounces, what then is its purpose?"*

**元君 (Yuánjūn, Primordial Lord)** replied: *"The advancement and retreat of talismanic fire within the Cauldron follow the waxing and waning of the lunar light in the heavens. Thus, a day has twelve hours, a year has twelve months, each hour mirroring a month. The first seven and a half days are spring, the latter seven and a half are summer—the breath of generation; the middle seven and a half days are autumn, the last seven and a half are winter—the breath of destruction. Hence, fire is limited to fifteen ounces, aligning with the exact count of the moon’s full radiance. If one adds an ounce, the Elder Yin oversteps its domain, invading the Yin-lands and causing the soul to perish—fire is transmitted, but not the elixir."*

The true mechanism of talismanic fire lies within the interplay of nine and six. In the hour of **子**, the fire is at its peak—contemplate its intent. Ritual purity is the direct path.

Now, the method of refining the elixir suffices for a year, yet only **十月 (shíyuè, the tenth month)** yields the completed elixir—why so? It is because in the **二八 (èr-bā, second and eighth)** months, each has its own pause and respite.

The **二月 (èr yuè, second month)**, ruled by the **兔 (tù, Hare)**, sees Yang-*qi* flourishing while Yin-*qi* first emerges—at the time when **榆荚 (yújiá, elm seeds)** begin to fall, one restrains the **卯木 (mǎo mù, Wood of the Hare)** fire and augments the **水 (shuǐ, Water)** to ensure safety. The **八月 (bā yuè, eighth month)**, ruled by the **鸡 (jī, Rooster)**, sees Yin-*qi* flourishing while Yang-*qi* first emerges—at the time when **荠麦 (jìmài, bittercress and millet)** gradually sprout, one restrains the **酉金 (yǒu jīn, Metal of the Rooster)** water and enhances the **火 (huǒ, Fire)** to secure stability.

In refining the Great Elixir, one must rely on fire, and the standard of hexagram lines determines its exact count. Otherwise, the days of its proper measure will be lost.

The fire, though advancing by fifteen *liang* at a time, only after a hundred days penetrates the core of the golden cauldron. Subtle yet taking form, it gestates the golden elixir.

After refining one cauldron externally for over a hundred days, open it to observe the golden elixir—whether like a lamp’s blossom or cloud formations, with the five *xiàng* (symbols) fully manifest, announcing to the Supreme Emperor and High Immortals. Take and ingest one *jiǔ* (ninth), and after a hundred days of gathering essence and accumulating *qi*, prolonging life and extending years.

Still, nurture it warmly until the full cycle of the Microcosmic Orbit is complete. When ten months of work are fulfilled, without substance generating substance, forming the *Tāi* (Great Harmony) rice and mysterious pearl, only then is it the true elixir.

One cauldron of refined *línggǒng* (spirit-mercury), when ingested, will forever solidify the form.

All friends should redouble their diligence in cultivation, until the three-year spirit-elixir, the nine-year white snow, the twelve divine talismans, when rubble turns to gold and withered bones become flesh—form and spirit both perfected, all virtues complete. Flowers bloom, fruit ripens, and one wanders in delight through the Supreme Clarity.

You should treasure these three volumes of sacred scripture, for their words are exhaustive and their meaning complete. I now return to the Jade Capital.
