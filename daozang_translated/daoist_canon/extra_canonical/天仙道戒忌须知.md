**The Heavenly Immortal’s Dao: Essential Prohibitions and Cautions**

**First: On Knowing When to Cease**

The Master of Niwan states: *"Without knowing when to cease, the will has no foundation, and one’s direction becomes confused and wavering."* The Elder of Great Emptiness says: *"To learn immortality, one must learn the way of the Heavenly Immortal, for the Heavenly Immortal is the ultimate destination of the immortal’s Dao. Knowing when to cease prevents one from being misled by the methods of Earthly or Water Immortals, ensuring that one’s efforts remain pure. The study of the Heavenly Immortal is the study of the heart. To focus solely on cultivating the heart is to know when to cease. The heart of the Heavenly Immortal is wondrously luminous, perfectly awakened, truly constant, and silently generative—vast beyond all bounds, yet minute beyond all interiors. Whether in movement or stillness, sitting or lying down, if one loses this essence, one must immediately turn inward in reflection. Even a slight delay in this awareness and illumination is called ‘delusion in cessation,’ which is a prohibited transgression on the path of the Dao.*

*One must understand that this body is not truly one’s own—nothing exists that does not arise from the wondrous presence of this heart, emerging from its wondrous absence. If I gather each and every thing back to its origin, then this body becomes whole and firm, and this heart becomes complete. This is what the Confucian tradition calls ‘complete reception, complete return.’ To cultivate and restore in this way is what the ancients called ‘lesser knowledge of cessation.’ For those who know this, their awareness and movement arise purely from the Heaven of Principle, yet they still rely on awareness and illumination to maintain unity, and thus retain the dualistic perception of self and dharma. If one can forget both self and dharma, emerging from non-being into being, abiding in serene constancy and attaining cessation, the ancients called this the path of ‘self-liberation’—the people of the Heavenly Immortal’s realm. Yet this cannot yet be called the cessation of the Heavenly Immortal.*

*The heart of the Heavenly Immortal perceives this body as a world, or the world as this body; it sees a single body and lifetime as a speck of dust, or encompasses within a speck of dust countless worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, while the body itself becomes as vast as those countless worlds. In every world, before every sentient being, it may erect the great banner of the Dharma, or conceal and reveal itself, teaching and guiding all beings—human and non-human alike—to reach the shore of the Dao, without the heart being attached to merit. Its words and actions arise as if not from itself, as if emerging from the worlds it encompasses. In every world, before every being, each one’s heart speaks and acts of its own accord, with no involvement from the self. Only then is the heart truly realized. Through such cultivation, diligent and unceasing, one returns ever more clearly, ever more purely and refined. Such is the heart and realm of the Great Luo Heavenly Immortal. To establish one’s will in this knowledge is called ‘supreme, great knowledge of cessation.’ What has been described above pertains to the School of Nature, which aids in the cultivation of destiny. Destiny cannot stand without Nature, and thus this has been explained in detail."*

*"As for the principles of refining destiny, the ultimate goal is the exhaustion of yin and the purity of yang. Spiritual powers and flight are not the aim. The objects of refinement are essence, qi, and spirit. My teacher spoke of primordial essence and postcelestial essence, and likewise of primordial and postcelestial spirit and qi. The methods of refining them each have their own definitive point of cessation.*

*Examining postcelestial essence—tangible and substantial—it resembles essence but is not true essence, being derived from food and drink. Before it is transformed into blood in the Crimson Palace, it disperses through the four limbs and the organs. If it is not refined at the Sea of Qi, it cannot be transformed into ordinary qi, rising to the brain and descending to the heart to become fluid and blood, reaching the kidneys. Then, ascending to the navel for harmonization, it follows the qi back to the Sea of Qi for a great refinement. If it fails to become qi, how can it rise to the brain and transform into Jade Fluid? Refining tangible essence without following this sequence is called ‘delusion in not knowing when to cease.’ If one stops before it is fully transformed into Jade Fluid, this also cannot be called ‘knowing when to cease.’*

*As for primordial essence, it is true essence. Yet its nature is yin, transformed from the lung qi of the body. The method of refining it involves passing through the kidneys and navel, descending to the Sea of Qi for refinement, then ascending to the navel to harmonize with earth. Descending through the Tailbone Gate, it rises to the summit for gathering. When the qi of the Celestial Stem illuminates it, it immediately transforms into Golden Fluid, descending smoothly into the Crimson Palace. At first, it is extremely cool, refreshing the organs, but in an instant, it transforms into hot qi, warming the entire body. When this warm qi pervades and harmonizes with the Mysterious Pass, one feels a sense of inhalation and exhalation within—this is the clear sign of nursing the infant. Those who refine true essence without following this method are deluded in not knowing when to cease. Even if one follows the method but stops before harmonizing with the Mysterious Pass, this cannot be called ‘knowing when to cease.’*

*As for primordial qi, it is the fire of yang, yet its true nature is yin. Postcelestial qi is the fire of yin, yet its substance and nature are yang. Primordial qi requires no refinement—knowing the method of nurturing it, one connects with the true qi of creation and draws upon it endlessly. Primordial qi arises from the Kun Palace; when Qian responds to Kun’s qi, it is formed, and thus its true nature is yin. Postcelestial qi arises from the Dui direction; Dui exhausts the qi of Zhen to enact its movement, and thus its nature and substance are yang. What is the method of nurturing it? Purify my marrow, still my heart, and refrain from exerting hidden abilities. What is the method of refining it? Apply the method of nurturing with focused spirit and settled thoughts, using the light of the eyes to constantly survey the Sea of Qi. Then, the lower extreme naturally becomes hot and boiling. Not only is ordinary qi transformed into true qi, but ordinary fluid is also transformed into ordinary qi. It becomes like clouds or mist, protecting the Mysterious Pass below and ascending the Spine Ridge above. Following the pervasion of true qi, it rises to the brain. When the grace of the Celestial Stem adds its qi-illumination, it too can directly transform into Jade Fluid. Is this not fortunate?"*

This Jade Fluid, when drawn to irrigate my Crimson Palace, brings unparalleled coolness and revives the springtime of the viscera. When used to moisten the Earth Cauldron, the Cinnabar Field becomes warm and moist, descending to penetrate the Mysterious Pass. The Infant is nourished, and harmony suffuses the entire body—this marks the culmination of the first stage in refining qi. Persisting in this practice, its secrets lie in nothing beyond this.

Those who refine qi by following this method and these principles may be said to have attained the wisdom of knowing when to pause. Yet during the ascent and descent of its circulation, obstructions or stagnations may arise—binding like a cord or constricting like a net—causing pain or numbness. For these, there exists another method of cessation.

**Second: Essential Prohibitions and Precautions**
The Master of Mud-Pill Palace states: "The meaning of these passages differs from the intent of *On Dispelling Doubts in Immortal Cultivation*. Here, the emphasis lies in prohibitions and precautions, rather than profound operative principles. It concerns the thoroughness of learning versus the precision of focus. Should there be any interruption or lack of dedication, even with true transmission, it is as if one had never heard it—spirits and deities despise this. Not only is it of no benefit, but the luminous laws of the Mysterious remain in force, and one cannot escape karmic retribution in the unseen realms. How can one not fear this? How can one not be vigilant?"

Master Tai Xu says: "Those who cultivate the Dao are as numerous as ox hairs, but those who achieve it are as rare as rabbit horns—this refers precisely to such learners. Otherwise, from ancient times to the present, those who have attained the Dao, even within my own knowledge, would fill volumes. How could the metaphor of 'rabbit horns' apply? The harm of interruptions and lack of focus stems entirely from unclear understanding of inherent nature and principle, and the obstruction of desires. Or it may arise from clinging to fixed views..."

Or it may stem from deluded perceptions leading to erroneous awakenings; or from impatience with hardship; or from regarding the Dao as loftily profound; or from doubting its simplicity; or from fearing that the master’s transmission is incomplete, or that one’s companions are unworthy; or from the sudden onset of chronic illness; or the emergence of new ailments; or from witnessing the untimely death of a revered figure; or from hearing of the fame of external teachings; or from advancing prematurely and inviting illness; or from reckless actions that breed disaster; or from family obstructions; or from waiting for the right time and missing the opportunity. The demonic obstacles are manifold, yet the failure in cultivation is the same—how lamentable indeed!

**Third Caution: Never Deem Insufficiency Sufficient**
Master Ni Wan says: "To deem insufficiency sufficient is the common affliction of Dao cultivators across the ages. Its root lies in ignorance, stemming from the lack of sagely teachers and virtuous companions."
Master Tai Xu says: "For this very reason, in the principle of *knowing when to stop*, I have already hinted at the boundary one should not transgress—a wake-up call for such practitioners."

**Fourth Caution: Disbelief in Cause and Effect**
Master Ni Wan says: "Disbelief in cause and effect is the malady of the enlightened, and it is most pernicious. Even if one attains the supreme Dao, without comprehension of inherent nature and principle—due to shallow reflection—one remains confined to emptiness and quiescence, ultimately becoming a follower of the Lesser Vehicle. For the ignorant and those mired in habit, the calamities are boundless—how can one not fear this?"
Master Tai Xu says: "Cause and effect are like shadow following form. Those who deny this principle not only sever their own path forward but also cut off their path of return. Even if one steadfastly upholds emptiness and quiescence without violating other precepts, I know that upon the exhaustion of their karmic blessings at life’s end, they will surely dissolve into motes of dust, scattered into the void."

The Mountain of Self and Others Looms High.

Master Ni Wan says: "When the mountain of self and others looms high, private desires run rampant. Even with diligent cultivation, one inevitably attaches to demonic paths." Master Tai Xu says: "If the sense of self and others is not eradicated, the four marks of existence remain intact. Afflictions and disputes will never cease; this is an inevitable consequence. Anger and resentment will multiply. Even if one knows how to refine qi to perfection, one merely becomes a member of the demonic household—just as my teacher foretold."

**Sixth Admonition: Lustful Thoughts Must Be Severed.**

Master Ni Wan says: "If lustful thoughts are not severed, even with diligent cultivation, it is like steaming sand to make rice—utterly without principle." Master Tai Xu says: "The arising of lustful thoughts stems from the river of desire. Failing to sever the precept of lust, the fire of human desire burns fiercely, scorching the true path. One falls into the realm of aquatic beings, and the calamity is no small matter. Moreover, in the Dao of elixir refinement, preserving essence is the foremost gate. If essence is depleted, qi is depleted; if qi is depleted, spirit wanes; if spirit wanes, the true fire weakens. The furnace and stove will grow cold, and the host of yin forces will run amok, leading to illness and certain death.

If certain scholars, constrained by conventional views, argue that of the three forms of unfilial conduct, having no descendants is the gravest, and that we, born into the Confucian tradition, cannot simply abandon this path—then we may petition the Emperor of Heaven to open a living path. For those determined cultivators, when spirit is complete and essence is full, if they wish to first extend their lineage, this may persuade obstinate Confucians. They are permitted to seek offspring once or twice, and it is certain that the child born will be male. However, upon the first conception, they must immediately sever and uphold the precept. They must not linger or violate the precept; those who do will be demoted into the realm of birth, flowing into the pit of desire, and will suffer all manner of retribution.

My teacher deemed this correct, and upon reporting it to Ancestor Lü, Ancestor Lü approved it. It has been recorded in the archives of the Three Heavens and proclaimed to the Nine Realms. Yet this is a secret teaching; those who know of it must not recklessly disclose its origins, lest they invite slander."

*(Xie’s Note: In today’s world, with its even greater complexities, once one enters the confines of marriage, this method of the ancient sages cannot adequately resolve the aftermath. One must understand that the variables after marriage are far greater than before. Either do not marry, or marry a like-minded cultivator. Otherwise, it is very difficult to escape. Life is filled with endless tasks; if one waits to pursue immortality only after all worldly affairs are settled, I fear this will become nothing but an excuse for procrastination. Years and days pass swiftly, intentions and form race with time, and before one knows it, hair turns white, complexion fades, and a lifetime yields no achievement.)*

Alas! Heaven and earth are but illusions; the myriad existences are not real. All forms arise and continue due to the causes and conditions of habitual karma—this is truly suffering. Yet people’s failure to sever lustful affairs stems from deep attachment. Those who speak of lineage and succession do so merely as an excuse. Otherwise, medical texts confirm that those with few desires often have more sons. What they call "sensuality" is not true sensuality but rather the unchecked blazing of desire.

The method to sever it lies in a single word: *fear*. This may bring benefit. Through diligent effort, one reaches purity. After three hundred days, this fire will no longer blaze. Thus, the ancients would hang a skull, contemplate a rotting corpse, display sacred images, recite scriptures and mantras, perform prostrations, or form companionships—all to restrain this single thought. Yet nothing surpasses placing oneself in emptiness and gathering the mind in nothingness, leaving the six senses and six dusts with no foothold. Simply employ the first secret of our Master Laozi, "roaming the mind in the primordial"—how effortless and simple!

I urge the determined scholars of this world to diligently apply this teaching. The Dao of elixir refinement will then swiftly come to fruition—what greater benefit could there be?" The Master said: "Indeed, what you have spoken is correct."

**Seventh Admonition: Stinginess and Boastfulness Must Be Eradicated.**

Master Ni Wan says: "If stinginess and boastfulness are not eradicated, the sense of self and others grows vast. This is the source of karmic cause and effect, where accounts are recorded in abundance, retributions remain unbalanced, cases are difficult to settle, and liberation is endlessly delayed. One may even transform into karmic obstacles—such examples abound in ancient and modern times."

Master Tai Xu says: "One must understand that almsgiving and salvation are inherent duties. A lifetime of stinginess causes one to miss good affinities. If one gives but retains the thought of regret, this is called backsliding, and merit diminishes—is this not lamentable? If one harbors boastful thoughts, arrogance and dominance run wild. Not only is merit erased, but the roots of karma are planted—how can one not fear this? This is why my teacher spoke these painful words above.

To cultivate the Dao, one must accumulate merit. To accumulate merit, how can one do so without almsgiving and ascetic practice? Moreover, good affinities are easily lost and difficult to obtain. Encountering them and acting is benevolence; acting without boasting is righteousness; enduring insults and slander without regret is virtue; bestowing kindness and planting virtue without attachment is the Dao.

Alas! Heaven grants me strength and bestows upon me the opportunity—how can I then allow stinginess and boastfulness to arise? The determined scholars of old heard and believed, and what they believed, they practiced without fail. The determined scholars of today consider skepticism wisdom and scrutiny clarity. Thus, they may devise plans to establish merit and virtue, yet ultimately, no merit or virtue is accumulated. They are ignorant of what merit and virtue truly are—nothing more than the perfection of the mind’s inherent nature and celestial goodness.

Therefore, the determined scholars of old simply exhausted their hearts and strength. Upon hearing, they acted, never calculating the truth or falsity of others. Thus, their merit and virtue accumulated and perfected easily. If one insists on doubt, there is nothing in this world that cannot be doubted. To wait for certainty before acting is to never act at all. Moreover, one fears that those awaiting aid may perish before help arrives—some die, some fail—is this not lamentable? Those who are stingy and boastful are unworthy of discussing the Great Dao."

Though they may cultivate with great diligence, I firmly declare that they remain ultimately confined within the pit of birth and death, transformed into seeds of karmic debt—how can one not be wary of this!

*(Xie’s note: The reason the wealthy possess wealth is that the natural workings of creation borrow their hands to relieve the impoverished, not to mock or deride them. The reason the strong possess strength is that the natural workings of creation borrow their hands to aid the weak, not to bully or toy with them. Power, wealth, knowledge, and experience all arise from the differing karmic conditions of each person. Yet when one examines their essence, all lives are equal—there is fundamentally no high or low, noble or base. To humiliate others is to humiliate the human nature of life itself, and since one is also human, it is to humiliate one’s own dignity. Those who make no progress in cultivation should reflect deeply upon this.)*

**Eighth Caution: The Arising of Thoughts of Gain and Loss**
Master Niwan said: “Those who entertain thoughts of gain and loss have never been able to follow the ancient resolve without recklessly imposing their own contrivances. The harms they bring about are beyond counting.”

Master Taixu said: “One must understand that human nature is fundamentally good, and the heavenly principle is fully present. ‘Gain’ and ‘loss’ are terms spoken only in reference to human affairs. What we cultivate is the Dao. The Dao is called ‘cultivation’ because delusion obscures our minds, illusion obstructs our nature, the Three Corpses and Nine Worms, the Seven Emotions and Six Desires, conspire together to harm our bodies—thus, we must engage in cultivation to secure peace. Cultivation means nothing more than removing these delusions and obstructions. When delusion is gone, truth remains; when obstruction is gone, clarity emerges. Truth and clarity are complete and inherent—there has never been any loss, so where could gain come from? Once this principle is thoroughly understood, how can there be any gain or loss? If there is not even existence, how can the mind be moved by delusion? The inner turmoil of conflict is but one’s own self-inflicted sorrow.

I hold that for every part of desire removed, the mind gains a part of clarity; for every ten parts of desire eradicated, the mind gains ten parts of clarity. I urge scholars to diligently eliminate desire and dispel delusion, to clarify their mind and nature, and thereby attain the wondrous clarity of perfect enlightenment. If one does not believe this and remains trapped between the anxieties of gain and loss, I know not what their ultimate fate shall be. I can only leave it to them. How can one not be wary of this?”

**Ninth Caution: The Interval Between Movement and Stillness**
Master Niwan said: “The human body inherently encompasses both movement and stillness. Movement pertains to spirit; stillness pertains to essence. The movement and stillness of qi are governed by spirit. Thus, when the body moves, spirit commands qi, qi follows spirit, and together they guide essence in motion. When the body is still, spirit directs essence through qi, leading qi to rest within the qi cavern.

Our wondrous, clear, and perfectly awakened mind-nature is originally without movement or stillness—how could there be any coming or going? Alas, why should the body’s movement and stillness create a gap in the cultivation of our minds? This is merely a failure to reflect deeply.”

Elder Taixu said: “Profound indeed are the Master’s words, revealing what none before have revealed, and mercifully guiding those who come after. How dare I, a humble disciple, not follow and expound upon them in detail?

I have heard from the Master that the dedicated practitioners of old never neglected their cultivation, whether in walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, each with its own method of practice. Thus, they achieved seamless continuity between movement and stillness, attaining the verifiable results of a hundred days of foundation-building, ten months of fetal perfection, and three years of nurturing refinement.

Examining movement, we speak of walking and standing. Standing is to stand firm; walking is to step forward. Examining stillness, we speak only of sitting and lying down. Though the method of refinement is singular, there are four loci for its application.

What is the one method? It is simply the gathering of spirit. (This single phrase encompasses the myriad methods of refinement and alchemical transformation described in countless texts.)

What are the four loci? When walking, gather spirit at the Yongquan acupoints of both feet; when standing, gather spirit at the Sea Bottom; when sitting, gather spirit at the Crimson Palace; when lying down, gather spirit at the Earthly Abdomen.

However, when sitting while conversing or standing while responding to others, the practice differs from solitary sitting or standing. When sitting, first gather spirit from the Sea Bottom, drawing it upward along the back, like the flame of a Buddha statue. This ensures composure during conversation. (In my humble opinion, one should also direct qi toward the guest’s front, enveloping their back from below the ground, then drawing it back.) Speech will then flow with measured clarity. (This enveloping must be executed with swift spiritual agility: upon seeing the guest, direct spirit behind them, enveloping from below the ground so that the qi mechanism ascends behind you, then envelop the guest again, as if encasing them in an egg, with both of you within. Thus, the wondrous application lies in the harmonious gathering of spirit throughout the body.)

When standing, first gather spirit at the soles of both feet, pressing down gently with force while responding orally. (This may also be done as in sitting practice.) The spirit will then remain settled and not scatter.

Lying-down practice has two methods: the Sleep of Xiyi and the Sleep of Huanyang. Xiyi was the honorific bestowed upon Ancestral Master Chen Tuan. Huanyang was the title of the Elder Lord Li of Mount Mao—this being the Elder Lord of the Cypress Tree, not the Elder Lord transformed by the Supreme. Each sleeping method possesses its own marvels.

For the Sleep of Xiyi, if lying on the left side: bend the left arm, using the palm to support the face, parting the thumb and forefinger so that the left ear rests in the gap between them, leaving the ear’s orifice unobstructed. Straighten the waist and back, bend the left thigh, and extend it to the Earthly Abdomen, resting comfortably upon the bedding. (In my humble opinion, the waist, abdomen, and right thigh should incline slightly toward the supine side, allowing the qi of the Elixir Field to flow freely.) Extend the right thigh alongside the left foot. (In my humble view, the right thigh should be slightly elevated and parted to avoid pressing against the kidneys, ensuring proper comfort.) Place the right palm over the navel, gathering spirit behind it. Envision the body’s luminous clarity, as if floating upon still water with an abyssal void below. The bedding and body transform into a white qi, like an egg, within which one sleeps. This is the method for lying on the left side; the same applies when lying on the right.

For the Sleep of Huanyang, one does not lie on the side but elevates the upper body with padding, approximately half a foot or three inches higher than the lower body. Lie supine, clench the fists, extend the arms straight, and part them in an open posture, as with the thighs, keeping them one or two inches from the scrotum. Seal the mouth, close the eyes, and still the mind. After about ten breaths, envision a misty vapor, like clouds or fog, enveloping the body inside and out. With intention, gather and retain this vapor at the Crimson Palace. (This gathering should be done with a state of near-forgetfulness. One may feel the chest becoming stiff or overheated, even unbearably so—this is the vapor, warmed by the heart’s fire, about to transform into blood. Only then should the following method be applied, allowing the blood to return to the kidneys.)

With the eyes inwardly gazing at the chest, back, and bedding below, perceive an abyssal void. (Thus, the heated blood flows from behind the heart and before the spine, dividing into two paths along the left and right, circulating into the waist and kidneys—a sign of blood transforming into essence.) Do not exert too much effort; remain relaxed yet attentive. (This “attentiveness” is the same as the “observing and guarding” described in *Discerning Delusions in Immortal Cultivation*.)

The subtleties within are too numerous to recount in full. (They are akin to those described in my annotations above.)”

The essential principles herein lie in eight methods for generating blood and two for transforming it into essence. As for the nine techniques pertaining to sleeping alongside another—lest they mislead later learners into heterodox paths—I dare not expound upon them.

*(Xie’s note: When man and woman sleep together, they should face one another; when persons of the same sex share a bed, they must turn their backs. The core secrets therein are not to be recklessly disclosed. Yet those who have acquired and perused this book are surely of proper lineage or enlightened and discerning scholars; thus, they may inquire of their own masters. I shall not presume to describe these methods here.)*

In the first *bingwu* year of the cycle, on the first day of the tenth month, Lazy Cloud attended upon the Elder of Great Emptiness, who recounted the *Precious Principles of the Celestial Immortal’s Dao Path* and the *Essential Prohibitions of the Celestial Immortal’s Dao*. When the discourse reached the section on "Intervals of Movement and Stillness," Lazy Cloud’s heart stirred. The Elder of Great Emptiness was a divine being, an emanation of the Southern Marchmount, with a mark on his left hand reading *Sovereign of Great Emptiness* (the script resembled seal characters yet was animated, with a soaring, coiling vitality; its hue was pure vermilion, visible only when he washed his hands at the moment of his passing)—hence his name. Lazy Cloud, moved in heart, entreated to transcribe the Elder’s words into this book, to transmit them to those in the world with karmic affinity.

The Elder of Great Emptiness said: “If you are willing to record them, why should I withhold? Soon they shall circulate widely throughout the lands north and south of the Great River. Though the time is not yet ripe.” He rose and chanted:

*“In the imperial year three six,
Then two three more pass by.
North of the Divine River’s shore,
South of Lou and Gong’s abode.
A humble rustic, barefoot son of heaven,
There the transmission began.
From him the secrets first were spread.”*

When the chant ended, he continued: “Though the attainment is not difficult, and many have heard of it, each must gauge their own nature and capacity, for their cultivation will differ, and so too their realization. All who read this book are of our fellowship—take care not to abandon yourselves.”

After a pause, he added: “My master arrived yesterday and said I shall soon answer the Emperor’s summons; my departure is near.” He rose again and chanted:

*“Seventy-nine years in the world,
Time not to be idly spent.
Glad to complete my true countenance,
Spiritually attaining the Heaven of Great Emptiness.”*

When the chant concluded, he smiled, took out paper, and said: “Copy it down.” Thus, beginning with the *Precious Principles of the Dao Path*, Lazy Cloud transcribed each section in order. By the time he reached "Intervals of Movement and Stillness," it was already the full moon.

The Elder of Great Emptiness said: “Why not compile the verses chanted on the first day into a complete text and append them to this section, as a testament for future initiates, a token of karmic connection?” Lazy Cloud rose and compiled them, then presented the work.

The Elder of Great Emptiness said: “Well done.” Then he added: “Continue the transcription for me.” He dictated:

*“What I have set forth is not fully recorded in other texts. Those who obtain it must not treat it lightly. To receive and not practice, to practice without diligence, to be diligent yet inconsistent—all are forms of disdain. Failing to achieve the Dao in life, on such-and-such a day (the original text reads: the full moon of the tenth month in the *bingwu* year of the Qianlong reign), the Master of Indifference (Indifference being the name of his studio, the *Indifferent Realm* of Kaihua Monastery in She Village, Gui’an County, where the Elder of Great Emptiness ascended) charged this upon me. Recorded by Lazy Cloud.”*

Alas!

Eleven days later, the Elder of Great Emptiness indeed departed this world.

This year, the *wuyin* year, Lazy Cloud, wandering as a guest, found himself at the Lougong work site. Awakened, he transcribed these records to bestow upon those of karmic affinity. He appended a few more lines at the end of the passage, saying:

**Tenth: Prohibitions and Taboos One Must Know**
*To act without following others.*

The Master of the Mud-Pill Palace said: “To act without following others is not the resolve of one content with their lot, but the conduct of those who delight in novelty and pursue the strange. Though they may escape the calamities of kings by chance, the laws of Heaven will surely not tolerate them. Thus, the statutes decree: even a single transgression incurs a three-year penalty of stagnation. This is because their nature delights in seclusion and perversity, refusing the middle path, and the disasters they bring are most severe. Hence, the punishment is heavy and no leniency is granted. How can one not take heed?”

The Elder of Great Emptiness said: “What my teacher has spoken is true and not false. The recluses of antiquity lived in the world yet forgot the years; their names are recorded in the annals, shining brightly for all to see—over a thousand of them. Yet today, they mingle unseen among the dusty world, some as monks sustained by desolate temples, others as companions to tattered beggars. The most exalted hide their traces on Mount Emei, Cock’s Foot Peak, Mount Taihua, or the most remote corners of the Zhongnan Mountains, where jackals and wolves are their only company. They sit in meditation for hundreds of springs and autumns, their bodies buried beneath fallen leaves, thorny brambles choking the paths, fearing nothing so much as being known. These are the great adepts of the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming.

Those who once displayed many wondrous signs—how boundless were their years of stagnation and penalty! I know this to be true, I have seen it with my own eyes. Yet I cannot bear to reveal their names.”

I fear that those in the world with aspirations may become deluded and misuse these arts, bringing no small harm upon themselves—thus I do not hesitate to speak at length for their sake. Let the determined take heed: be cautious, and never act against the natural course of things.”

At that moment, the Elder of Sea Remnant interjected, “Divine powers and magical arts are what perfected beings of this world rely upon to accumulate merit and cultivate conduct—this is recorded in detail in the annals. Master, do you caution against them because the written records are not entirely trustworthy, or is there a deeper meaning in your extreme admonition?”

The Elder of Great Emptiness replied, “You are too confused to grasp this, yet if I do not explain, I risk misleading those who come after. Have you seen an egg hatch into a chick?”

“Yes,” he answered.

“Have you seen one whose form is incomplete yet prematurely breaks free from its shell?”

“I have not.”

“The transformation of an egg follows its own Dao; the completion of its form follows its own principle; the breaking of the shell comes at its proper time. If the time is not yet ripe and one forces change, or if the time for change has not come and one forces formation, or if the form is not yet firm and one forces the breaking of the shell—those not yet transformed will die, those not yet fully formed will wither, and those whose time has not come will fall ill. What I spoke of earlier concerns those whose forms are already complete and firm, yet whose time has not yet arrived—thus their suffering is no more than this. Yet even so, their affliction is already grave! Alas!”

The chick, like all things, transforms from non-being into being, nurtured until its form is complete—its task already fulfilled. Yet whether broken by heaven or by man, the harm or benefit remains as such.

Now, our Dao is the Dao of immortality. From being it transforms into non-being, refining the solid to return to the void, dispelling delusion to revert to truth, gathering the nature to return to its source, transmuting yin to become yang. Through myriad practices and secrets, one neither abandons nor clings to the physical form, living freely and purely, serene and undisturbed, neither fully present nor entirely absent, utterly refined and unadulterated. One no longer regards the five viscera and six bowels as mere viscera and bowels, nor the four limbs and hundred bones as mere limbs and bones. In vision, only a perfect, radiant sphere remains—first forming the realm of water and moon, then the world of golden sands, and finally the realm of crimson and violet purity.

Suddenly, the manifested realm contracts, shrinking to the size of a grain of rice or millet. I then gather it with true intent, drawing it into the Mysterious Pass as a magnet draws iron, penetrating the Mysterious Womb. This is the wondrous function of settling the spirit and entering sagehood, allowing not a trace of impure qi or the slightest mingling of unrefined ordinary essence, qi, or spirit from my body.

When the Mysterious Pass first opens, a single impure practice reveals the esoteric and arcane. My immortal embryo is not yet formed, true qi is still faint, and though the true spirit is complete, the defilements of the mundane remain stubborn, with little radiance to be found. This esoteric and arcane practice is when the true spirit commands the consciousness, marshaling my ordinary qi to externally align with the celestial and terrestrial *killing qi* of the Big Dipper to perform deeds. Its numinous efficacy lies in borrowing the authority of the Celestial Emperor, so that the qi of heaven and earth cannot but converge. Yet those who come to converge are none other than the Six Heavenly Demon Kings, who, obeying the Emperor’s decree, dispatch their demonic qi to assemble. Within me, the spirits that feign obedience while fearing righteousness—whose hearts are not yet rectified—heed the summons and inevitably comply. Thus, their actions are invariably efficacious and verified.

It must be understood that those who practice such methods have not yet attained profound cultivation, their true qi is insufficient, their true spirit still faint, their mind and nature not yet perfected, and their deluded thoughts still ablaze. Thus, this reckless refinement arises from nothing more than vain desires for superiority, fame, marvels, and wonders, or the foolish impatience to test and taste. Those demonic spirits know this all too well, and so they entice the inner demons to band together and seize control of my body. The practitioners, unaware, have already fallen prey to demonic possession. From then on, they act without restraint, and the more their methods grow in numinous efficacy, the more they believe their past cultivation was mistaken. Thus, they deceive themselves and others—an inevitable outcome.

If, however, their Dao-root is deep and robust, and they encounter a perfected one who awakens them with a shout, returning to the true Dao and cultivating with vigor, they may yet achieve the formation and emergence of the immortal embryo. Yet the final step of pulverizing and completing all—this single stroke—may remain unattainable for hundreds or thousands of years. Why is this so?

The karmic delusions of the past, accumulated like mountains and seas, must dissolve and sins be absolved before the celestial decree descends. Only then is this barrier broken—how can one not take heed!

Hailiu, you must understand: when inner cultivation reaches completion, merit and conduct become naturally sufficient. You breathe as one with the Creator, thoughts move and spirits respond, spirit congeals and qi guards—like the mind commanding the fingers, the fingers obey without fail. Could such numinous power not be vast? What need is there for methods? What need for techniques?

Those who remain obscured and fail to attain the spirit’s clarity, who have yet to penetrate the Way, are but ordinary emotions and thoughts. Purify these ordinary emotions and thoughts, then direct them with singular resolve to return to the true—thus does numinous power arise of itself.

The Elder Hailiu rejoiced. Master Lanyun thereupon inscribed these words.

(Afterword by Xie: This passage contains many inner visions beyond the reach of brush and ink, beyond the grasp of conjecture—realms such as the Moon-in-Water, the World of Golden Sand, the Crimson-Purple Realm of Purity. The profound principles and states unfold in perfect order, serving as the true seal of the celestial immortals. This must not be overlooked.)

**Cautions and Prohibitions, Chapter Eleven**

Indulgence in idleness.

Master Niwan said: "Those who indulge in idleness are no true aspirants, nor can they be compared to those who seek self-cultivation. How lamentable! Even if the sages were to return, they could scarcely guide such men toward the Dao. Their bodies are purely yin, for their refinement is ever outstripped by their indolence. Alas, what more can I say?"

Elder Taixu said: "How compassionate! That my master disdains to instruct them is itself the deepest teaching. Those of a placid nature suffer from sloth—they seem enlightened yet remain unenlightened, appear content yet know no true contentment. Such mediocrities, with their meager talents, mingle among the gates of the mysterious. Their efforts are truly pitiable." (Xie’s note: Reading this, I cannot help but break into a cold sweat.)

"My master pities them deeply, hence his sharp admonitions. Those who immure themselves in withered trees and empty halls are legion. I say such men merely fail to grasp the secrets of practice! To knowingly place oneself amid the arena of afflictions while clinging to idle ease, yet still scrutinize gains and losses with care—this is the mark of a great spiritual friend. Over time, as others recognize their cultivation, they may yet be moved from ignorance to wisdom. By examining the merits and flaws of this disposition, refining the inner self through diligent effort, who is to say this is not the grand thoroughfare to celestial immortality?

Why is this so? Once you have entered the gates of the mysterious, take care not to squander your days in vain. If you wish to spend your years in tranquil repose, my judgment is that you will fritter away hundreds and thousands of lifetimes. As for this idle ease, it is never truly attainable—this is precisely the intent behind my master’s sharp rebuke!

Alas! Lacking both talent and strength, yet straining to be diligent, illness will surely follow. Better to work within one’s capacity and mold it into a vessel of accomplishment. Just as birds and swans differ in nature, each possesses its own secret path of refinement. No one is born in vain—all may attain the Dao. Do not abandon yourselves to fate!"

**Cautions and Prohibitions, Chapter Twelve**

To achieve results within a set timeframe—Niwanshi said: "That one may achieve results within a fixed period is but the claim of a single school, not a universal principle. For endowments vary, and the dull and the wise differ. To insist on achieving results by a deadline is to invite harm without exception."

Taixu the Elder said: "The master’s words strike the mark. Whether one drinks water or broth, one knows its warmth or chill for oneself—the master cannot dictate it to the disciple, nor the father to the son. Endowments differ, and the wise and dull are not the same. Proceed as is fitting, and even if the time is not yet come, it is enough. If the way is not fitting, though the time has passed, the practice does not cease. The numbers seven and nine are but labels for the old and young, not deadlines for achievement. Thirty-six turns to the left, thirty-six to the right—this is the same as saying six of one and half a dozen of the other. Extending this logic, one need not be rigidly bound. It is like traveling a road: one measures distance by paces and strides, and the method is thus established. For those who take this path, they simply walk it, with arrival as the ultimate aim. Why must one scrutinize the steps of those who tread the mud? Steps vary in size, and their counts differ—is it not delusion to calculate distance by counting steps?

The Way of Celestial Immortality is alive and fluid—it cannot be discussed by those who cling to rigid forms and fixed texts."

**Chapter Thirteen: Essential Prohibitions and Taboos**
*Self-Imposed Boundaries of Purity and Defilement*

Master Niwan states: “Purity and defilement reside in the heart; external circumstances have no part in them. Yet among those of this world who aspire to the Dao, many falter and fail due to such delusion—how laughable indeed.”

Master Taixu remarks: “Profound are these words! ‘Purity and defilement reside in the heart; external circumstances have no part in them’—this is an immutable truth. To fixate on external conditions and draw boundaries is but the folly of those who consume antiquity without digesting it. Know this: all acts of purifying, expelling defilement, and the like—whether washing the face to cleanse the heart or burning incense to refine the nature—are of this principle.

Yet how absurd are those who, abandoning rites of mourning, go out of their way to avoid graves! They claim that scriptures warn that seeing a corpse within forty-nine days bars one from attaining the Dao. Little do they realize this teaching originates from the school of *li song*—a veiled critique of those who traffic in yin and yang, making a livelihood of funerals and burials, dwelling day and night amid such affairs, their entire lives steeped in the stench of death. Truly, such people lack the capacity to achieve the Dao.

However, if practitioners of yin-yang arts were to sincerely recite the *Tai Xuan Jade Classic*, and further, to daily contemplate the mind’s essence, not only would their own bodies become pure, but all they encounter would transform, and what they preserve would become spirit. What greater merit could surpass this? This is what is meant by ‘forging ghostly affinities below’—it too yields a measure of attainment.

Moreover, if the heart transcends the cycle of birth and death, what place remains for purity or defilement? Alas, since birth and death are no more, how can purity or defilement exist?

Now, the school of *li song* rightly demands inner and outer refinement; the slightest laxity undermines reverence. Hence the rites of burning incense and offering sacrifices, the practices of bathing and changing garments. But for those who cultivate the Dao, who abide in undivided integrity, who tread the path of Celestial Immortality—vast and boundless as the void—what fear is there of inauspicious defilement? What taboo could possibly apply?

Yet if one lacks the Dao and feels affected by such things, there is a method: recite the *Tai Xuan Jade Classic* while holding the secret, and visualize the radiance of compassion—like the sun or moon—illuminating the Golden Court. Even if affected, no harm shall come.

Never should one, out of self-imposed restrictions, wait until the seven-week mourning period concludes before paying respects, thereby neglecting great rites. Nor should external factors obstruct one’s progress in cultivation.

This is the merciful teaching our master has revealed to guide others.”

**Cautionary Precepts to Know, Fourteenth: Clinging to the Ancient While Binding the Present**

Master Niwan said: “As times shift and the world changes, so too does the qi’s movement compel it. Those who cling to the ancient while binding the present know only how to cherish antiquity but fail to digest its essence. This must be guarded against.”

Master Taixu said: “Indeed, the ways of old have long ceased to function in the world. Take, for instance, the transmission of the Dao—there are circumstances where ancient methods cannot be applied, yet few understand this. Once, in a certain place, a certain master transmitted a certain Dao to a disciple. The rites and ceremonies were not fully observed, yet the transmission was completed. Another arose to reproach them, saying: ‘This Dao was passed down from such-and-such an ancestor, received from such-and-such a teacher. The rites were thus, the ceremonies so—how weighty they were! Yet now, this master transmits to this disciple in such a simplified, even irreverent manner. How can this be?’ The master wished to explain but could not, and to this day, the matter remains a subject of gossip.

Alas! The reproach was not without reason. Yet how could the critic know that the circumstances of past and present differ? The Classic says: ‘Rites, rites—are jade and silk all there is to them?’ The ancient sages valued ritual forms precisely to gauge the sincerity of the recipient’s devotion. Today, however, it is otherwise. If one calculates the rites to determine the transmission, one will only summon contention and stagnation. Moreover, one may even slander the Dao because of the rites.

Alas! It should be known that the master’s disregard for ritual in transmission was an act of revering the Dao, not disrespecting it. Applying this principle to the matter of clinging to the ancient while binding the present, there is indeed much that must be guarded against.

Alas! The world rushes on—those who cling to antiquity do not truly understand it. Examining closely, most who invoke the past to bind the present do so falsely. Their hearts and conduct are even more unworthy of inquiry.”

*(Xie’s Note: Though we now live in an era where science and technology flourish, when transmitting methods or imparting cultivation techniques, there are still many who rigidly adhere to ancient forms, demanding that disciples ascend altars and swear oaths. This only breeds resentment among learners, failing to inspire reverence for the Dao and instead provoking slander. Many practitioners have written to me, vehemently condemning such practices. Thus, I deeply understand the harm of clinging to the ancient while binding the present and urge fellow cultivators to reflect.)*

**Cautionary Precepts to Know, Fifteenth: The Body, Mind, and Intent**

Master Niwan said: “Those who master the three through reversal attain immortality; those who submit the three to pursuit remain bound to the human realm. Thus, one must guard against letting the body, mind, and intent follow their own course.”

Master Taixu said: “Profound are the master’s words! The body, mind, and intent may be called qi, spirit, and essence—or Heaven, Earth, and Water—for they contain this principle within. Thus, essence arises from the mind, spirit is possessed by intent, and qi is borne by the body, yet in truth, the mind governs all.

To master the three through reversal means to use the mind to govern intent, intent to govern the body, the body to stabilize resolve, resolve to stabilize spirit, and spirit to stabilize qi. Through mutual governance and stabilization, desires are purified, principles are refined, and unity is achieved—this is the Dao of immortality.

To submit the three to pursuit means only to let the mind follow intent, the body submit to intent, and intent submit to the mind. Through mutual submission and pursuit, desires flare while principles perish, giving rise to a thousand postures and ten thousand forms—this is the way of the human realm.

Alas! One must understand that the Dao of Celestial Immortality employs reversal as its function, just as Heaven and Earth take their positions—only then is there harmony. Even Water and Fire, Wood and Metal possess the marvel of mutual union, while Water and Earth share the merit of harmony. Extending this principle, all things employ reversal as their function. This is why our master so earnestly admonishes us.”

**Cautionary Precepts to Know, Sixteenth: Neglect of Ritual and Etiquette**

Master Niwan said: “This can be seen outwardly as proof of inner cultivation—it is precisely the manifestation of reverence, sincerity, and devotion in both inner and outer realms. How can one afford to neglect it? A determined cultivator who violates this will surely fall into demonic paths. Must one not be guarded against it? This is not the same as the misguided notion of ‘excessive deference.’”

Master Taixu said: “Those who violate this precept are mostly of the sort who appear enlightened but are not. Such individuals have cultivated little merit in past lives and possess only meager talent and intelligence. Having met with misfortune and failed to find their place, they are rarely understood. When they offer reverence and respect, others do not reciprocate; some even mock them. Gradually, they reverse their conduct entirely. Then, meddlesome admirers praise them, saying: ‘So-and-so is truly talented—even the ancient recluses and eccentrics could not surpass them!’ The ignorant of the world echo this praise, bestowing upon them the fine names of ‘liberation,’ ‘serene detachment,’ and ‘aloof nobility,’ mutually reinforcing one another. Word of this reaches the ears of unworldly cultivators, who then imitate them from afar. This is how, in this degenerate age, the neglect of ritual and etiquette has become a pretext for preserving one’s ‘true nature.’

Learners must indeed guard against this! Otherwise, they will surely fall into the demonic path of arrogant self-indulgence. One must be consistent in both inner and outer conduct, yet also know when to stop according to one’s station.

Thus, when occupying a position of honor, one should observe the rites of forgetting rank; when in a humble or junior position, one should fulfill the duties of a disciple. In interactions with peers, one should ensure that ritual propriety is not lacking—this is sufficient.

Our Dao is the great Dao of Celestial Immortality. It does not shun people nor flee the world, so social interactions cannot be neglected. When bells and drums resound within the palace, their echoes reach beyond. Take care that the noble gentlemen of the four directions, upon hearing and seeing, do not depart with unfavorable impressions.

Moreover, the Celestial Immortal’s practice is to embed the firing times within one’s movements, whether sitting, standing, or walking—how can one be careless? When one should sit while conversing, there are methods for sitting while talking. When walking while conversing, there are methods for walking while talking. When standing while conversing, there are methods for standing while talking. If others sit, one sits; if they rise, one rises; if they stand, one stands; if they walk, one walks.”

In all the circling and bowing of ritual exchanges, subtle and wondrous secrets reside within. One may practice the oral formulas of one’s art and refine one’s essence and qi at any place and time, while also carefully examining whether one’s practice is relaxed or strained. How could one carelessly perform the outward forms of social courtesy while neglecting the inner cultivation of divine skill? Thus, the precepts of the Celestial Immortal number as many as three thousand eight hundred, each a fine and detailed injunction.

For the more still the mind becomes, the more perfectly round it grows, attaining the marvel of effortlessly conforming to every rule without need for conscious attention. Yet one must, in ordinary times, minutely observe and embody these principles, so that when the moment of social engagement arrives, one will not find the rituals burdensome. Therefore, the determined scholars of old never neglected the forms of rising, standing, sitting, and walking in their households at all times, precisely to refine the oral formulas of rising, standing, sitting, and walking. When they emerged to engage with others—whether serving superiors, interacting as equals, or facing subordinates—they naturally achieved perfect harmony with the proper measures and secrets.

This is what is meant by “the great hermit in the marketplace.” Today, however, people assume that the household has no fixed norms and thus grow lax in their limbs and posture. They do not realize that the saying “the household has no fixed norms” does not refer merely to morning and evening duties. Rather, every great and small ritual must be made consistent within and without, free from any imbalance, hence the term “no fixed ritual.” Confucius’ appearance—calm and joyful—was precisely the subtle application of this embodied awareness in moments of leisure and repose. It can be grasped in the mind but not conveyed in words. Take care not to mistake leisure and repose as an excuse to neglect the essential work of natural reverence.

As the Record says: “At all times, think of fulfilling loyalty; in retreat, think of correcting faults.” This does not refer solely to matters of governance. Know that the success or failure of governance arises from the single mind. In all actions—moving, stopping, sitting, rising—if one knows the secret of settling the spirit, then the spirit will abide in the body and not fly off elsewhere. When one stands in court, matters will be naturally clear, decisions sound, responses harmonious, and conduct upright. In all exchanges and courtesies, humility will be fittingly modest, reverence fittingly composed, deference fittingly proper, eloquence fittingly lucid, discourse fittingly fluent, conduct fittingly correct, and integrity fittingly genuine.

For the Dao of the Celestial Immortal is this: in obscurity, one perfects oneself alone; in prominence, one benefits all under heaven. In stillness, one becomes a sage; in transformation, one becomes an immortal or buddha. All this begins and ends with the single work of the mind, culminating in a great transformation that does not cling even to itself—this is the learning of the Celestial Immortal. Who could say that ritual propriety may be neglected?

If ritual is performed merely as ritual, it becomes empty form. Outward reverence with inner laxity is still negligence—this must be taken as a strict warning, my disciples, take heed.

*(Xie’s note: In movement, stillness, sitting, and rising, the aim is to settle the spirit within, for what is within naturally manifests without. Thus, inner calm produces outward reverence, inner harmony produces outward respect, and ritual propriety is achieved. But how does one settle the spirit within? Fellow practitioners may refer to the passage on “intervals between movement and stillness,” where they will surely grasp the meaning without need for further elaboration.)*
